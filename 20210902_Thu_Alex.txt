[00:00.000 --> 00:26.200]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:26.200 --> 00:32.280]  Corey Diggs recently published a comprehensive report on the business behind the vaccine
[00:32.280 --> 00:33.580]  passport.
[00:33.580 --> 00:39.840]  It includes every facet of banking and big tech, including IBM, who did virtually the
[00:39.840 --> 00:46.400]  same thing during World War II, and in trust, a company run by the prominent Nazi quant
[00:46.400 --> 00:47.560]  family.
[00:47.560 --> 00:51.520]  Her extensive research spells out the plan very clearly.
[00:51.520 --> 00:55.800]  The QR code will be the so-called mark of the beast.
[00:55.800 --> 00:59.600]  Just like livestock, and no longer free.
[00:59.600 --> 01:05.360]  The QR code has already become the standard for DNA data storage.
[01:05.360 --> 01:12.360]  We can now scan a specimen's QR code and extract the entire genomic map.
[01:12.360 --> 01:15.720]  And we can create a creature from this data.
[01:15.720 --> 01:22.000]  George Church of Nebula Genomics explains how his company has the ability to read ancient
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.680]  DNA, write and edit it with CRISPR.
[01:25.680 --> 01:28.280]  We can read the woey mammoth genome, which is pretty amazing.
[01:28.280 --> 01:30.360]  These things have been extinct for a long time.
[01:30.360 --> 01:35.080]  We can read the ancient DNA, and we can now write it, can edit the elephant genomes with
[01:35.080 --> 01:36.280]  CRISPR again.
[01:36.280 --> 01:37.280]  And we've done this.
[01:37.280 --> 01:41.160]  We've made 15 edits so far of bringing back extinct DNA.
[01:41.160 --> 01:48.560]  He said in a 2013 interview with Der Spiegel that DNA can be assembled into an embryo
[01:48.560 --> 01:51.840]  and planted inside of a human woman.
[01:51.840 --> 01:59.280]  Church's Nebula Genomics wants to give people the opportunity to sell their genetic information
[01:59.280 --> 02:01.520]  for digital tokens.
[02:01.520 --> 02:07.520]  And he has Hollywood's Morgan Freeman to help promote and normalize his radical modern-day
[02:07.520 --> 02:10.880]  Frankenstein work.
[02:10.880 --> 02:16.160]  Stamping a human's DNA genome onto their mark is one thing.
[02:16.160 --> 02:22.440]  But in order to store a person's entire life onto a single QR code and have it utilized
[02:22.440 --> 02:28.080]  efficiently across the entire web, they are using the blockchain.
[02:28.080 --> 02:33.280]  Blockchain technology allows information to be stored by a tamper-proof ledger that others
[02:33.280 --> 02:37.080]  on the chain can monitor and validate in real time.
[02:37.080 --> 02:41.560]  And it is being adopted in nearly every major industry.
[02:41.560 --> 02:46.560]  With the help of Big Pharma and the media, the bankers are corralling everyone inside
[02:46.560 --> 02:54.360]  their rentals, wired up to the Internet of Things with a QR digital ID that holds their
[02:54.360 --> 03:03.840]  entire DNA genome on the blockchain and managed by artificial intelligence, just as the Rockefeller
[03:03.840 --> 03:10.800]  Foundation announced in their 2020 publication Mapping an AI Future and the UK Ministry of
[03:10.800 --> 03:21.640]  Defense in their 2021 publication Human Augmentation, The Dawn of a New Paradigm, marked like livestock
[03:21.640 --> 03:24.240]  and no longer free.
[03:24.240 --> 03:27.760]  Unless of course we all say no.
[03:27.760 --> 03:42.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.680]  The mark of the beast has arrived in the United States and Canada as well as Europe, Australia
[03:48.680 --> 03:49.680]  and New Zealand.
[03:49.680 --> 03:54.960]  They are announcing that you must have the QR code, that you have had all the injections.
[03:54.960 --> 03:59.600]  They're now saying every five to six months, now they're saying every month.
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.000]  And they're saying if you take two pills per day, Pfizer has announced they're in charge
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  of the planet.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.760]  Even if you have a clip of Trump, I forgot to play this weekend, we'll pull it up where
[04:08.760 --> 04:13.640]  he was on national TV and said, yeah, you know, Pfizer, they really run the FDA now.
[04:13.640 --> 04:14.640]  He said it very cryptically.
[04:14.640 --> 04:17.200]  He said, you ought to look into that to the reporter.
[04:17.200 --> 04:19.920]  So we're going to queue that up and play that next segment.
[04:19.920 --> 04:21.760]  But this is it.
[04:21.760 --> 04:22.840]  So I hope you'll fight back.
[04:22.840 --> 04:27.160]  I hope you'll share with your sheeple friends out there before it's too late because I know
[04:27.160 --> 04:29.960]  you're awake, but a lot of your friends and family may not be just like we all have those
[04:29.960 --> 04:33.760]  folks in our circle of people we know.
[04:33.760 --> 04:37.560]  I hope you'll go to Band-Aid video, but I hope you'll get the Greg Rees report.
[04:37.560 --> 04:38.560]  It's now the feature video.
[04:38.560 --> 04:42.600]  It just went live five minutes ago and I hope you'll share the living daylights out of it.
[04:42.600 --> 04:44.960]  The mark of the beast is here.
[04:44.960 --> 04:47.000]  It has arrived.
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.480]  And will you roll over to it?
[04:48.480 --> 04:49.560]  And I want to explain, we come back.
[04:49.560 --> 04:53.120]  What happens once you accept the mark of the beast?
[04:53.120 --> 04:59.360]  Oh, well, with that comes death and hell and just absolute enslavement.
[04:59.360 --> 05:02.600]  In these insane times, I wouldn't mess around.
[05:02.600 --> 05:05.640]  I wouldn't screw around with your health and your immune system.
[05:05.640 --> 05:11.480]  I would do everything you can to boost your body's natural defenses and at the same time,
[05:11.480 --> 05:15.880]  support those that are fighting the globalist and fighting to stop new lockdowns and tyranny.

[06:24.840 --> 06:40.520]  Well, now evil is out of the open, it has reared its stinking, fetid head, and humanity
[06:40.520 --> 06:45.920]  has a real shot at opposing it and fighting it.
[06:45.920 --> 06:51.400]  Before I play a clip today of President Trump coming out a few days ago and saying, you
[06:51.400 --> 06:59.040]  know, Pfizer really runs the FDA and the governments of the world and people want to look at Pfizer
[06:59.040 --> 07:01.000]  and the booster shots.
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.920]  So he's starting to edge up towards taking on the fraud.
[07:04.920 --> 07:09.200]  He knows he's been set up and he needs to do it.
[07:09.200 --> 07:16.840]  That will take Trump from being a figure pushed off to the side, still getting some good Republicans
[07:16.840 --> 07:21.560]  elected, still has incredible power to being the populist he was meant to be.
[07:21.560 --> 07:26.960]  People will forgive him in a moment for being conned by Fauci and others and lying to him
[07:26.960 --> 07:28.520]  about the vaccine's efficacy.
[07:28.520 --> 07:30.240]  It's now admitted it doesn't work.
[07:30.240 --> 07:34.080]  In fact, the majority of sick, I have new articles from around the world, have taken
[07:34.080 --> 07:36.080]  the injections.
[07:36.080 --> 07:37.760]  It's just amazing.
[07:37.760 --> 07:38.760]  He has to do that.
[07:38.760 --> 07:43.360]  We've got to recruit Trump over to our side again, and that's why I took him to the woodshed
[07:43.360 --> 07:48.640]  last week, and I'm told directly, folks, talk to the president, former president, the election
[07:48.640 --> 07:54.400]  is stolen from him, that it got to him, you know, hearing that I blew up at him because
[07:54.400 --> 07:55.400]  I like Trump.
[07:55.400 --> 07:56.400]  I love Trump.
[07:56.400 --> 08:01.360]  I think Trump's a good man, but I care about people not dying a lot more, and let me explain
[08:01.360 --> 08:03.280]  something to you.
[08:03.280 --> 08:07.240]  I stayed up till two in the morning last night with this stack of news and information that's
[08:07.240 --> 08:08.240]  right here.
[08:08.240 --> 08:11.560]  Two in the morning.
[08:11.560 --> 08:16.840]  My wife went to bed about 9 o'clock, children went to bed about 9 o'clock, went to bed early
[08:16.840 --> 08:22.520]  last night, and I stayed up till 2 a.m., and then I got in here about an hour before the
[08:22.520 --> 08:28.080]  show, and I haven't even had time to go back through all of this.
[08:28.080 --> 08:29.640]  I mean, I tried the last hour.
[08:29.640 --> 08:34.960]  I'm going to have to, during breaks and things go back through it because it's so bombshell,
[08:34.960 --> 08:41.600]  and this is directly from the Singaporean government, the Israeli government, and more
[08:41.600 --> 08:46.920]  than eight other governments that I went to their own government websites, and usually
[08:46.920 --> 08:49.080]  they're run by John Hopkins.
[08:49.080 --> 08:52.200]  That works for Bill Gates, the Rockefeller Foundation, and I want to explain, when they
[08:52.200 --> 08:56.080]  show the number of deaths after you take a vaccine or they show the number of hospitalizations
[08:56.080 --> 09:01.360]  or heart attacks or blood clots, that's like crosshairs on a rifle when the sniper pulls
[09:01.360 --> 09:05.760]  the trigger and then uses the optics to see if he's shot you or not, or it's like the
[09:05.760 --> 09:14.120]  gun camera on a F-16 recording of its sidewinder missile hits the other aircraft.
[09:14.120 --> 09:17.640]  To John Hopkins, they know about the deaths, they know about the heart attacks.
[09:17.640 --> 09:23.560]  To them, that's a targeting computer, and so they're watching just like a B-17 pilot
[09:23.560 --> 09:29.680]  would have a bomb site on their aircraft, and then they're releasing bombs as they
[09:29.680 --> 09:35.880]  go to different targets, and then seeing if they hit their targets, and then ready going
[09:35.880 --> 09:39.960]  back to the squadron behind them, okay, we hit that target, we didn't hit that target,
[09:39.960 --> 09:43.960]  so you'll go ahead and re-hit that target or don't re-hit that target.
[09:43.960 --> 09:45.320]  I mean, that's what they're doing.
[09:45.320 --> 09:47.200]  These are targeting systems.
[09:47.200 --> 09:52.640]  Imagine the movie Predator, when it aims its laser gun, it goes, you see that vector spot
[09:52.640 --> 09:58.320]  going on people, and that's what that is, so John Hopkins is the targeting crosshairs
[09:58.320 --> 10:02.200]  on you and your family, and you go to their numbers and you're like, oh my god, they run
[10:02.200 --> 10:07.600]  the world numbers for the UN, Israel has the most deaths, and the most illnesses, and they're
[10:07.600 --> 10:12.600]  the most vaccinated in the world of any large country, and it's heart attacks in 12-year-olds
[10:12.600 --> 10:14.320]  that are taking the shot.
[10:14.320 --> 10:19.280]  It's heart attacks in 25-year-olds, totally healthy, I mean, people are dying, people
[10:19.280 --> 10:27.440]  are just excruciating pain, their hearts just swell up and bust open, and I have, when put
[10:27.440 --> 10:35.720]  the headline up for the day show, CDC documents that the CDC put out themselves that have
[10:35.720 --> 10:42.440]  been hiding in plain view where they admit heart attacks and microcard idiots and all
[10:42.440 --> 10:49.720]  the rest of this in their own admission, so the show headline today is Absolute Global
[10:49.720 --> 10:52.720]  Bomb Show.
[10:52.720 --> 11:05.000]  FDA, top FDA scientists have now come out and admitted that the COVID-19 vaccines are
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.680]  poisoning adults and children, as there's the headline, Breaking Mega Bomb Show.
[11:10.680 --> 11:16.440]  Top FDA scientists warn COVID vaccines are poisoning adults and children, and here's
[11:16.440 --> 11:17.440]  what's amazing.
[11:17.440 --> 11:24.760]  All this new news and all the statistics and the graphs of all the most vaccinated countries
[11:24.760 --> 11:30.320]  with the most death, with the most illness, and it's in the vaccinated, and then they're
[11:30.320 --> 11:34.800]  on the news going, well, it's not as, first, it's 100% effective to stop COVID, but their
[11:34.800 --> 11:37.160]  own internal documents a year and a half ago, they said it's not going to work, it's a gene
[11:37.160 --> 11:40.680]  therapy, they'll have to have basically shots every few months, 10 shots a year.
[11:40.680 --> 11:44.040]  That's how I knew this was coming, but like, how did Jones know it's 10 shots a year?
[11:44.040 --> 11:48.640]  That's what they originally were saying, well, it'll be about 10 shots a year.
[11:48.640 --> 11:52.960]  Within three shots, you basically have one-sixth of the immune system you had previously, and
[11:52.960 --> 11:56.640]  when you keep doing it, it just turns your immune system completely off, which is the
[11:56.640 --> 12:02.280]  same thing HIV does, and by the way, this virus has HIV delivery system in it.
[12:02.280 --> 12:08.880]  So the wild virus did what this does, but at a much lower scale, the virus they released,
[12:08.880 --> 12:14.760]  they made Chimera, but into the wild, but now the vaccine, all the scientists that weren't
[12:14.760 --> 12:19.200]  on their payroll went, top horologies, Nobel Prize winners went, this will cause the spike
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.760]  protein to grow all over the body, the spike proteins would drive cancer, you'll get cancer
[12:23.760 --> 12:31.320]  in the lymph nodes, in the heart, in the liver, in the uterus, in the testicles, and a bunch
[12:31.320 --> 12:36.280]  of other places, you'll get expansion, you'll get blood clots in the lungs, and all of that
[12:36.280 --> 12:42.680]  happened, and so now Israel started giving the, quote, booster shots first, and now they've
[12:42.680 --> 12:49.120]  got, again, massive new deaths and illnesses in those that did it.
[12:49.120 --> 12:54.000]  Now remember, this is the other gigantic issue, I'm going to go over all this today, two days
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.840]  ago, the number one and number two scientists at the FDA over vaccines, they had a vaccine
[12:59.840 --> 13:04.360]  program and his deputy, one's been there 35 years, one's been there 12 years, they're
[13:04.360 --> 13:09.080]  the head guys, they're pro-vaccine people, they said, hey, you can't have the CDC in
[13:09.080 --> 13:13.360]  the White House running this, you shouldn't give it to under 12, and we're against these
[13:13.360 --> 13:20.800]  booster shots, it's not going to work, that's going to discredit us, and they said, we don't
[13:20.800 --> 13:26.880]  care, and the head of the FDA who approved OxyCotin previously and fentanyl, we'll talk
[13:26.880 --> 13:30.360]  about a monstrous woman, by the way, four children, I forgot that part, just always
[13:30.360 --> 13:36.440]  it's worse, he overrode them and said, we're going to say it's an authorized shot when
[13:36.440 --> 13:41.640]  they never did the trials and it's not authorized, so they just discredited the whole FDA system
[13:41.640 --> 13:48.000]  further with a fake, it's approved certification, and the two top scientists have gone public
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.360]  saying in their resignation, we are mad about the authorization, it's not a real authorization,
[13:54.360 --> 13:58.160]  we're mad about the boosters and we're mad about children, we said don't do this and
[13:58.160 --> 14:03.440]  they did, that's hidden in the fine print, and said, oh, they're just mad about the booster
[14:03.440 --> 14:07.360]  schedule and when that was going to happen, no, that's the distraction, and everybody
[14:07.360 --> 14:14.600]  took the bait and just went with the booster issue, that is not as big as we've been bypassed,
[14:14.600 --> 14:20.560]  they shouldn't have done the emergency authorization saying that's an authorization, and it's attacking
[14:20.560 --> 14:28.280]  children, they've done trials now, experimentally on children, and it hurts them, it kills them,
[14:28.280 --> 14:33.600]  these babies are having convulsions, babies are dying, with their freakazoid liberal parents
[14:33.600 --> 14:37.840]  all getting off on it, being on the national news, this is child sacrifice, this is moon
[14:37.840 --> 14:44.200]  childs and by proxy, this is sick, this is a demonic spirit, ladies and gentlemen, and
[14:44.200 --> 14:47.880]  I've seen a clip of a priest making a really good point, he makes that point, we're going
[14:47.880 --> 14:53.040]  to play that clip along with Trump and more when we come back, but I have right here,
[14:53.040 --> 15:01.560]  these CDC documents from the CDC website that list more than a dozen things that they said
[15:01.560 --> 15:05.840]  that the Moderna and Pfizer and J&J is all the same thing, they make it produce spike
[15:05.840 --> 15:11.760]  protein would do, they say blood clots, strokes, microcardidus or cardiditis or however you
[15:11.760 --> 15:21.880]  say it, all right here, they predict lymphoma cancer, they predict uterine problems, because
[15:21.880 --> 15:29.600]  they know this is one of the most studied areas is vaccines for colds, and every time
[15:29.600 --> 15:33.400]  they try it, it kills the animals and kills humans and trials, and they finally found
[15:33.400 --> 15:39.200]  out why, because it's the spike protein that is poisonous, so what do they do, they souped
[15:39.200 --> 15:43.080]  up the spike protein and said it was good for you, they didn't just give you a regular
[15:43.080 --> 15:48.560]  cold shot, they had the regular spike, they created a giant rhinoceros spike with HIV
[15:48.560 --> 15:55.160]  delivery system and did that, I mean folks, this is open and shut bio warfare, and finally
[15:55.160 --> 15:56.920]  the folks found their soul at the FDA.

[17:53.960 --> 18:02.720]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists, I wanted
[18:02.720 --> 18:08.120]  to stop their agenda, I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[18:08.120 --> 18:12.960]  before they went operational, but we failed, yes a lot of people are awake, yes we're
[18:12.960 --> 18:19.480]  not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[18:19.480 --> 18:24.360]  great reset, and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[18:24.360 --> 18:28.480]  tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[18:28.480 --> 18:32.400]  the truth, so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda,
[18:32.400 --> 18:36.160]  but we've also got to get personally prepared, and one of the number one things to do is
[18:36.160 --> 18:39.880]  high quality, storeable food, we've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable

[19:00.200 --> 19:06.400]  so optimistic that he's so positive, no, it's that type of optimism that built this country,
[19:06.400 --> 19:10.440]  we would have never defeated the British 250 years ago if we didn't have a lot of optimism
[19:10.440 --> 19:15.160]  and we didn't persevere, George Washington lost most of his major battles, but he kept

[20:00.440 --> 20:17.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, from the front lines of the information war, it's
[20:17.720 --> 20:30.960]  Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen, every day I have five or six videos that follow my lap
[20:30.960 --> 20:37.760]  that I didn't even look for of mothers and fathers and sons and daughters, talking about
[20:37.760 --> 20:41.880]  how their daughter or their son or their mother or their father or their sister or their
[20:41.880 --> 20:49.160]  brother took the vaccine that's not a vaccine that is a gene therapy, a genomic injection,
[20:49.160 --> 20:56.220]  and then they die of blood clots in the brain or heart attacks or liver failure.
[20:56.220 --> 20:59.800]  And the ones we really pay attention to is we're genetically designed to deal with old
[20:59.800 --> 21:03.880]  people dying, it's not fun, but we understand it.
[21:03.880 --> 21:11.920]  But when your 25 year old son dies, a day after they take the shot, you wake up.
[21:11.920 --> 21:17.000]  And by the way, even when it's the people's official Facebook or Twitter or Instagram accounts
[21:17.000 --> 21:21.240]  and they go speaking to capital and they say my mother died, my son died, my brother died,
[21:21.240 --> 21:27.600]  they take it down because you're the victims, you've got to be suppressed and ball gagged
[21:27.600 --> 21:29.320]  while you're being murdered.
[21:29.320 --> 21:34.080]  Here's just one of the latest videos, man's son dies of enlarged heart right after shot,
[21:34.080 --> 21:35.560]  which they admit it does.
[21:35.560 --> 21:38.120]  And they wouldn't give it a Var's report though, a Var's report.
[21:38.120 --> 21:42.080]  So remember, it's about a hundred times what they're telling you, it's probably a million
[21:42.080 --> 21:46.080]  deaths in the U.S. alone, and we've had whistleblowers come forward and expose that and they're just
[21:46.080 --> 21:47.080]  getting started.
[21:47.080 --> 21:48.080]  Here it is.
[21:48.080 --> 21:52.640]  I love the hell out of my country, but I don't trust my government anymore.
[21:52.640 --> 21:59.440]  My son received the vaccine and he died a few days later.
[21:59.440 --> 22:05.600]  The only explanation I was given to me was enlarged heart, so if I have anything to say
[22:05.600 --> 22:10.920]  to anybody, look down at your child, it's not worth the risk.
[22:10.920 --> 22:16.040]  I mean, you see your baby right now, you might not see your baby tomorrow.
[22:16.040 --> 22:19.280]  I have to live with that the rest of my life.
[22:19.280 --> 22:24.200]  And that's Ernest Ramirez in Austin, Texas in front of the Texas Capitol.
[22:24.200 --> 22:28.600]  By the way, if you guys can find Ernest Ramirez, I'd like to get that man in studio and bring
[22:28.600 --> 22:33.040]  in pictures of his son and talk about him and humanize another person taken out.
[22:33.040 --> 22:37.720]  Now remember, these things are so deadly that the death is a side effect.
[22:37.720 --> 22:41.720]  It's meant to kill you in three to five years, spaced out, soft killed, they're going to
[22:41.720 --> 22:44.800]  claim unvaccinated or cause all the death.
[22:44.800 --> 22:47.120]  That's what the scientist said a year and a half ago, it's what's happening.
[22:47.120 --> 22:52.120]  But some people, it just, your body's so good and takes the order of the injection and produces
[22:52.120 --> 22:57.120]  so much spike protein that it eats holes in your arteries and veins and you die.
[22:57.120 --> 22:59.320]  And reportedly it is excruciating.
[22:59.320 --> 23:03.840]  Your heart just swells up, swells up, all of it blocks, it seizes up, and it's one of
[23:03.840 --> 23:06.800]  the most painful deaths they say you can imagine.
[23:06.800 --> 23:11.440]  Takes usually a day or two, and it is, they usually put you in a coma, I mean, it is like,
[23:11.440 --> 23:15.440]  like usually you're 60, 70, you have a heart attack, happens for about an hour, part of
[23:15.440 --> 23:20.120]  your heart freezes up, locks up, it's incredibly painful, you fall down, you pass out, that's
[23:20.120 --> 23:24.240]  not what this does, it just swells up slowly, it gets bigger and bigger, it just takes a
[23:24.240 --> 23:26.000]  day until you pass out and you die.
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.280]  I mean, you're talking about hell on earth.
[23:30.280 --> 23:34.120]  I've talked to folks that have had the vaccine, this has happened to them, and they just say
[23:34.120 --> 23:38.760]  it's indescribable, like somebody ripping your heart out of your chest for a day or two.
[23:38.760 --> 23:41.800]  And they usually know how to give you anti-inflammatories if you're getting quick enough, you don't die.
[23:41.800 --> 23:46.560]  This son, artery started blowing, guaranteed.
[23:46.560 --> 23:49.120]  That's supposed to happen when you're 70 or 80, folks, this is when your aorta is supposed
[23:49.120 --> 23:51.680]  to go to the widowmaker, not when you're 25.
[23:51.680 --> 23:58.040]  All right, let's go now to a priest talking about the devil is overplaying his hand,
[23:58.040 --> 24:01.160]  I totally agree, here it is.
[24:01.160 --> 24:08.120]  The devil is overplaying his hand, what I mean by that is, he's making himself more
[24:08.120 --> 24:19.520]  and more obvious in his activities in government, in his activities in the technocracy, in education,
[24:19.520 --> 24:25.120]  in the entertainment industry, and in culture, in the culture at large.
[24:25.120 --> 24:31.120]  I even believe, you don't have to believe this, but I believe it, that there's a demonic
[24:31.120 --> 24:33.680]  dimension to the pandemic.
[24:33.680 --> 24:40.920]  You know why I say that? Because I look at the fruit of the pandemic in the lives of
[24:40.920 --> 24:43.480]  people in our country and around the world.
[24:43.480 --> 24:47.320]  What is the most obvious fruit of the pandemic?
[24:47.320 --> 24:52.440]  I don't mean the people who get sick and die, what I'm talking about is something more widespread
[24:52.440 --> 24:53.960]  than that.
[24:53.960 --> 24:59.120]  There are many, many more people than those who get sick and die who are gripped with
[24:59.120 --> 25:07.520]  what, fear, right, and fear is one of the primary strategies and tactics of the evil
[25:07.520 --> 25:14.560]  one, trying to keep people in fear, which is the antithesis of faith.
[25:14.560 --> 25:17.280]  What's the Bible verse, maybe you guys can pull it up.
[25:17.280 --> 25:26.480]  The devil goes around like a wild beast, roaring, seeing who he may devour, because a patriot
[25:26.480 --> 25:31.720]  is either going to get to a place of safety or is going to take on the wolf, take on the
[25:31.720 --> 25:33.720]  beast.
[25:33.720 --> 25:47.840]  But a Satanist, a leftist will grovel or fall down on their back and bed, so it.
[25:47.840 --> 25:54.560]  That COVID will get you to take the shot and you take the shot it kills you.
[25:54.560 --> 26:01.440]  it makes you sick. And in the statistics, it's there, but they don't want to admit that.
[26:03.920 --> 26:06.240]  They don't want to admit that to themselves, and they will see you
[26:07.440 --> 26:10.400]  as the bad person, even though you're trying to save them.
[26:11.760 --> 26:16.720]  Because they have Stockholm syndrome. They don't oppose the beast. They don't oppose the monster.
[26:16.720 --> 26:21.760]  They get on their knees to it and then say, I'll help you get those others to eat me last.
[26:24.960 --> 26:26.960]  So here's President Trump, very tellingly,
[26:29.440 --> 26:32.320]  in a big interview a few days ago, I meant to get to it, but I saw it again this morning.
[26:32.320 --> 26:36.880]  I thought we had to play this saying, oh, Pfizer, they're really powerful. They really run things.
[26:36.880 --> 26:41.040]  People want to look into them in the booster shots. That's him edging up to the edge of this,
[26:41.040 --> 26:47.760]  where he's probably lost half his support over the vaccine. Sure, he said you shouldn't have to take
[26:47.760 --> 26:51.280]  it, but we want you to come out against the vaccine mandate. We want you to actually charge
[26:51.280 --> 26:56.800]  against the big brother system. And you could help defeat this Trump.
[26:59.760 --> 27:03.040]  And so that's what we need. And you could say, hey, I thought it was a good vaccine.
[27:03.040 --> 27:06.640]  They told me it would work, but he's too scared. He thinks they'll turn on him
[27:06.640 --> 27:13.280]  if he does that. Well, your supporters are turning on you. So you better decide which way you want
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.360]  because this is going to come out. I mean, the two head scientists, the FDA quit saying,
[27:19.360 --> 27:24.800]  don't give it to children. Don't do boasters. And we did not really authorize this. That's a lie.
[27:25.360 --> 27:28.240]  Because they understand they're not going to get away with this.
[27:29.040 --> 27:33.600]  Their rats leaving a sinking ship like the inventor of mRNA technology. I don't think he's
[27:33.600 --> 27:39.040]  a bad guy, but you know, he's, he's, he's backed away from it because he knows he's not stupid.
[27:39.040 --> 27:41.680]  And they're asking themselves, how are they going to get away with this?
[27:42.400 --> 27:46.000]  That's what everybody should be asking because the globalists have a plan. I know what it is.
[27:48.240 --> 27:56.000]  We'll talk about it next segment, but here's Trump. And I learned things. The FDA is virtually
[27:56.000 --> 28:03.600]  controlled by Pfizer. Pfizer has control, not Johnson and Johnson, not Moderna, but Pfizer has
[28:03.600 --> 28:10.560]  control over the FDA. Oh, that's a different clip the guys found. I think I sent it to Scott this
[28:10.560 --> 28:14.480]  morning. Trump. Oh, we have the other one. Go ahead and roll the other one. Here it is.
[28:15.040 --> 28:20.080]  They paused. You know, Johnson and Johnson is a great company, but it doesn't do as well as
[28:20.080 --> 28:26.960]  Pfizer with government. The people running Pfizer have a great relationship. Let me put it that way
[28:26.960 --> 28:32.000]  with government. Do you notice now they're coming in with boosters and this and that? Yes. Pfizer,
[28:32.000 --> 28:38.320]  what they did. Yeah, Pfizer runs the whole thing worldwide, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:39.440 --> 28:45.520]  Pfizer runs the whole globalist program. It's the key one. It's the Mac Daddy. It's the, it's the
[28:45.520 --> 28:50.720]  pimp supreme. And they're the ones bringing in the worldwide program they've announced. Two pills
[28:50.720 --> 28:53.920]  you'll have to take a day to be able to leave your house. We'll tell you about that when we come back.
[28:55.040 --> 29:00.480]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too. But listen,
[29:00.480 --> 29:04.800]  after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one
[29:04.800 --> 29:09.520]  thing almost everyone agrees on. It's that immune system health can literally be the
[29:09.520 --> 29:14.560]  difference between life and death. You probably already believe that. I certainly do. So here's
[29:14.560 --> 29:19.760]  the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually
[29:19.760 --> 29:25.520]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support. Now you'll have to sign a waiver,
[29:25.520 --> 29:30.800]  but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefense.com. No cures or treatments there.
[29:30.800 --> 29:36.720]  Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product
[29:36.720 --> 29:42.240]  based on that research called immune 10X. And the best part, you can go to the stronger defense

[29:59.840 --> 30:05.680]  globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their
[30:05.680 --> 30:10.960]  tracks before they went operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes,
[30:10.960 --> 30:16.320]  we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[30:16.320 --> 30:21.360]  deindustrialization great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers
[30:21.360 --> 30:26.160]  and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and
[30:26.160 --> 30:30.080]  ready to hear the truth. So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their
[30:30.080 --> 30:34.400]  agenda. We've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high
[30:34.400 --> 30:38.720]  quality, storeable food. We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices

[31:55.520 --> 32:01.120]  Record numbers of three humans across the planet from Australia to Germany to the United States
[32:01.120 --> 32:08.000]  to Canada to Mexico from Brazil to South Africa understand we're under a great reset
[32:08.000 --> 32:15.040]  viewing globalist attack. But none of our leaders other than Bolsonaro and Trump a little bit
[32:15.680 --> 32:20.960]  seem to understand that. And so no one is addressing the fact that this is a 21st century
[32:20.960 --> 32:27.440]  corporate economic war on the general population and the conversion of the planet into a high tech
[32:27.440 --> 32:35.440]  technocracy with a global IP global medical system global medical control ID and of course a
[32:35.440 --> 32:40.800]  carbon taxes that tied to that the traction every movement. This is their takeover. They
[32:40.800 --> 32:46.240]  admitted it. They've said it to know the professor Canada's on TV yesterday saying this is an
[32:46.240 --> 32:51.040]  environmental takeover plan and the whole lockdowns of just talking to prepare for climate
[32:51.040 --> 32:55.040]  lockdowns. So they're announcing their takeover. We've got to resist it and say no.
[32:55.040 --> 33:21.200]  So you're listening to the Alex Jones show live from the info wars dot com studios.
[33:21.200 --> 33:33.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. So the plan has always been to addict you to gene
[33:33.280 --> 33:38.720]  therapies that completely remove your immune system by the third boaster shot.
[33:40.320 --> 33:45.120]  Pfizer's chief scientist spokesperson has come out and said and the head of the British
[33:45.680 --> 33:50.720]  main laboratory that works for Pfizer. They've also released the same studies and I've played
[33:50.720 --> 33:54.320]  the clips here on air probably 10 times a piece. You'd like I'll pull them back up.
[33:56.320 --> 34:01.360]  And all the medical doctors I talked to know this all the virologists know this we've had them all on
[34:01.360 --> 34:07.440]  and I'll be sitting there talking to lawyers I know or accountants and they just go really Alex
[34:08.160 --> 34:13.520]  really the most the polio was caused by the polio vaccine. I go yeah here's a P most the
[34:13.520 --> 34:21.600]  polio in the world's cause of the polio vaccine. And I'll go here's Pfizer that admitting that
[34:21.600 --> 34:26.240]  their vaccines a live virus and then it sheds it and spreads it. I don't want to see it.
[34:28.560 --> 34:32.720]  People just want to wear a mask. They just want to get scared. They want to run around like idiots
[34:32.720 --> 34:38.560]  when it was a real virus they released did not spread very easily. If you were run down and
[34:38.560 --> 34:43.840]  seriously sick and old you could die you had three or four pre-existing conditions that
[34:43.840 --> 34:49.680]  was an overblown garbage. We predicted that once you got the injections it would do deadly variants
[34:49.680 --> 34:54.320]  that already tested in animals and knew it would. And they turned us all into factories
[34:54.320 --> 35:00.160]  to then release deadly spike protein that creates cancer in every mammal that comes
[35:00.160 --> 35:04.400]  in contact with it long term. And this is going to chronically infect everybody.
[35:04.400 --> 35:11.120]  And there are things that mitigate it like ivermectin and high vitamin doses and things
[35:11.120 --> 35:14.800]  like that. So people are either going to get super healthy and get their act together or
[35:14.800 --> 35:18.880]  everybody's going to start dying. And even a lot of folks that are super healthy it's still going
[35:18.880 --> 35:25.600]  to get you. You've been hit by a biological weapon ladies and gentlemen. You've been hit
[35:25.600 --> 35:31.440]  by a biological weapon that the globalist cooked up and pre-tested and I'm sorry. They wanted to
[35:31.440 --> 35:35.760]  depopulate you. They said they would depopulate you and while they depopulate you they're going
[35:35.760 --> 35:43.440]  to use the fear of the intensifying depopulation as oh god we're trying to save you during this
[35:43.440 --> 35:49.760]  cataclysm. Just three years ago the UN says disease X is coming in the next two years and it's
[35:49.760 --> 35:54.480]  caused by climate change and it's humans faults and it's going to change society and we're going
[35:54.480 --> 35:58.800]  to lock you up in your houses and give you forced injections but that's not going to work and even
[35:58.800 --> 36:03.840]  more super deadly stuff's coming and the population will be reduced by 90% soon but that's for the
[36:03.840 --> 36:12.080]  betterment of the earth. And that's why you saw two years ago AOC and other Democrats like Beto
[36:12.080 --> 36:17.120]  saying nobody's going to be here in 12 years. That was two three years ago remember.
[36:18.720 --> 36:23.200]  Why were they and the extinction rebellion or their high priest calling for the end of humans
[36:23.200 --> 36:29.280]  in the end of industrial world and blocking roads and attacking blue-collar workers. This is a death
[36:29.280 --> 36:34.400]  cult. This is a eugenics cult. Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates they all say they want to kill you.
[36:35.120 --> 36:40.720]  They all say the cult is there. You will never reverse the Great Reset. The end of industrial
[36:40.720 --> 36:47.120]  society is here. You will cleanse the earth and end the poverty and war and hunger by 2030
[36:47.120 --> 36:55.600]  because they plan to kill the vast majority of everybody by the end. They've written books.
[36:55.600 --> 37:05.760]  I've shown you the quotes. Do you understand how much danger you are in? You were under
[37:05.760 --> 37:14.640]  bio weapon attack. Synthetic bio weapon attack and you look at the left how pale they are and
[37:14.640 --> 37:19.200]  how green-skinned they are and how zombie like they are because they have turned their spirit
[37:19.200 --> 37:24.640]  over to the spirit of death. Their sacrament is abortion. Their sacrament is human animal cloning.
[37:24.640 --> 37:29.280]  Their sacrament is degradation of their bodies. Their sacrament is turning themselves over
[37:29.280 --> 37:36.560]  to just hating themselves and hating you. So let me explain this. I have stacks of news here.
[37:36.560 --> 37:40.160]  I'm going to go over and we're going to open the phones up today. I've cleared the board of guests.
[37:40.160 --> 37:51.280]  This is a systematic plan. So I told you a year and a half ago or more, I said they want 10 shots
[37:51.280 --> 37:59.600]  a year. Next they'll announce a booster by the fall. I was wrong. It was the summer of 2021.
[38:02.160 --> 38:06.240]  Then I said they'll announce that didn't work. They'll want shots every three months
[38:06.240 --> 38:15.600]  and then every month and a half or so. How did I know? It was in the public papers we showed you.
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.280]  You can type in top academics recommend 10 COVID shots a year and now we have the health minister
[38:21.280 --> 38:25.360]  in Australia saying actually it's going to be every six months. It'll be every two months. You'll
[38:25.360 --> 38:31.680]  just get used to it. I mean it's happening and they look like a mad scientist out of a movie
[38:31.680 --> 38:39.840]  because they are. These are killers. These freaking people look like Emperor Palpatine or
[38:39.840 --> 38:45.440]  something. They talk like them because they're damn evil and you better get that through your head.
[38:46.720 --> 38:51.040]  These people ain't playing games. They're a death cult. They all know what they're in on. They
[38:51.040 --> 38:55.760]  believe there's another population of humans which are in an emergency cutting operation.
[38:55.760 --> 39:02.320]  It's a very sad way afterwards but we will inherit the earth afterwards playing God.
[39:04.240 --> 39:10.240]  And so now I've got the article over headshot please. Pfizer is now developing in FullWars.com
[39:10.240 --> 39:17.440]  has a story posted a twice per day COVID pill that must be taken alongside vaccines
[39:17.440 --> 39:23.520]  and they're saying your Apple show you'll have to videotape yourself scan with the phone
[39:23.520 --> 39:32.480]  proving you've taken it and you better not have any drug avoidance. So THX 1138 is here.
[39:33.120 --> 39:38.560]  It's a Gabriel Keene article from National File. Pharmaceutical, mega corporation Pfizer
[39:38.560 --> 39:44.160]  is now developing a COVID pill that is meant to be taken alongside the COVID vaccines that they
[39:44.160 --> 39:49.040]  have already made the company a staggering amount of money. But that's only part of it. It's the
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.920]  global ID to control and track you that then have the carbon taxes attached to that's the holy
[39:53.920 --> 39:58.160]  ground with no one's talking about it except the globalists are now saying oh we're gonna
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.080]  attach it to environmental reasons have environmental lockdowns and tell you when you
[40:02.080 --> 40:06.240]  can have meat or when you can drive a car where you can go it'll authorize your trip.
[40:07.600 --> 40:13.520]  The new pill is expected to be released by the end of the year and will be required to be taken
[40:13.520 --> 40:19.520]  twice per day and notice the people adopting this are women worldwide because they think the
[40:19.520 --> 40:24.000]  government the media and big tech are their friends and so the media says men shouldn't be
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.920]  assertive men shouldn't be the leader of the household and she says so you see the women
[40:27.920 --> 40:33.040]  hopping around ordering their husbands around who step and fetch it but then when the app from the
[40:33.040 --> 40:38.560]  big tech all tells them when they can go out and how much meat they can have or if they can have a
[40:38.560 --> 40:46.640]  child or a lots of a trip and like and oh my universe is being cut out next week I'm bleeding
[40:46.640 --> 40:52.080]  out I'm 25 but it's liberal oh I took my shot oh I had a heart attack it's so liberal and so
[40:53.120 --> 41:02.480]  that's how sick this is. Success against COVID-19 will likely require both vaccines and treatments
[41:02.480 --> 41:08.640]  but see that's what the shots are is genetic treatments. Pfizer's CEO said Wednesday we're
[41:08.640 --> 41:15.680]  pleased to share we've started phase two three study on our oral antiviral candidate specifically
[41:15.680 --> 41:21.840]  designed to combat SARS-CoV-2 in on hospitalized low-risk adults and guess what is the same thing
[41:21.840 --> 41:28.800]  as ivermectin but they don't want you to know that and they say you'll have a twice a day pill
[41:28.800 --> 41:33.360]  just to make sure you don't get the COVID because there's an illness. I figured it all out folks
[41:33.360 --> 41:37.360]  from the scientists but I knew this year and a half ago but now it's confirmed. I'm going to explain
[41:37.360 --> 41:42.800]  it very slowly for everyone the bad news the good news is we know what they've done. You will be
[41:42.800 --> 41:47.600]  chronically infected that's why we have people in the office and people all over the country I know
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.640]  that got COVID a year ago got it six months ago got it a month ago got and got it again and you
[41:52.640 --> 41:56.320]  go take tests and one of them doesn't say you're positive because it's different spike proteins
[41:56.320 --> 42:01.920]  they inject people with the Pfizer with the myrmidurna with the J&J and others they all do the same
[42:01.920 --> 42:08.080]  thing it's all ordered by Fauci they already had pre-tested it you produce as a suicide bomber
[42:08.960 --> 42:15.200]  massive amounts of spike protein synthetic virus just the shell it's super poisonous and deadly
[42:15.200 --> 42:21.360]  and you just colonize everyone and your body over reacts you take steroids you beat it your body
[42:21.360 --> 42:26.640]  gets over it but it's like a poison it's not really a it's a virus that acts as a poison and then
[42:26.640 --> 42:32.880]  you just reinfect reinfect reinfect reinfect reinfect reinfect reinfect and then you're
[42:32.880 --> 42:36.880]  getting monthly shots daily pills and they had it all planned they cooked it up and released it
[42:36.880 --> 42:42.720]  on you and your family and until we stop taking the vaccines it won't stop but you understand
[42:42.720 --> 42:46.320]  they're going to keep taking more shots they'll be factories they'll get sick they'll die they'll
[42:46.320 --> 42:50.400]  make you sick and then they'll turn around and blame you the unvaccinated for everybody dying
[42:50.400 --> 42:55.920]  even those statistics show it's the vaccinated it is through our five senses that we are kept
[42:55.920 --> 43:01.600]  fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see through this illusion
[43:01.600 --> 43:08.480]  is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem consuming too much fluoride
[43:08.480 --> 43:13.760]  forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions
[43:13.760 --> 43:19.600]  natural functions which have been known for millennia the hindu chakras align with the endocrine system
[43:19.600 --> 43:25.760]  the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described as the seat of the soul
[43:25.760 --> 43:31.520]  the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen
[43:31.520 --> 43:38.160]  dimensions of reality fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy
[43:38.160 --> 43:44.480]  our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free
[43:44.480 --> 43:50.560]  and the pro pure showerhead will seal the deal get them both today for yourself or a friend

[48:27.920 --> 48:37.520]  theme its own story there it is breaking mega bomb show top fda scientists warned covid vaccines
[48:37.520 --> 48:46.080]  are poisoning adults and children cdc documents confirmed that agency leaders knew as early as
[48:46.080 --> 48:52.960]  october 2020 the experimental covered 19 gene therapy injections would cause blood clots strokes
[48:52.960 --> 48:59.680]  heart attacks and more now i'm going to open the phones up at 15 after next hour but i'm
[48:59.680 --> 49:04.880]  going to hit this really big story that i've mentioned in the in the first two segments of
[49:04.880 --> 49:13.120]  the next hour the actual cdc document from october of last year where they list heart swelling
[49:13.120 --> 49:21.600]  heart attacks strokes cancer death liquefaction of the uterus off of what their scientists
[49:21.600 --> 49:25.360]  were telling them what happened now you know why the two head virologists quit
[49:27.760 --> 49:34.160]  two days ago now you you understand the media spends that oh they quit they were arguing over
[49:34.160 --> 49:40.160]  where their booster shots were needed or not no they said we're leaving it's buried in the news
[49:40.800 --> 49:46.720]  ready yes down the air because this was not given fda approval did not go through the process they
[49:46.720 --> 49:52.320]  just reauthorized emergency use and called it approved and we don't like the white house and
[49:52.320 --> 49:57.600]  cdc making those decisions in our name and we don't like the booster shot we don't think it's
[49:57.600 --> 50:06.160]  needed and we disagree on the rollout on under 12s but if you go on instagram or facebook or
[50:06.160 --> 50:12.480]  twitter i go look at it it's literally these idiots want to take horse medicine oh they
[50:12.480 --> 50:16.960]  won't listen to all the scientists these things these vaccines totally work and they're great
[50:17.600 --> 50:20.640]  when i have and i'll show you this next hour out of israel always their places
[50:21.280 --> 50:24.240]  i already showed you yesterday out of greece in israel but there's new numbers out
[50:24.240 --> 50:31.120]  of explosions in death explosions in illness the majority of the hospitalized the majority
[50:31.120 --> 50:37.520]  of the dying took the shots i think you'll see the major media spinning oh well i guess the
[50:37.520 --> 50:47.280]  shots don't work as well as they used to don't worry won't worry we've got boosters for you
[50:47.280 --> 50:54.080]  and pills you take every day that are antivirals you're not a horse fda tells american stop
[50:54.080 --> 51:00.400]  taking dewarmer for covet it's not dewarmer it's a Nobel prize-winning drug used for hundreds of
[51:00.400 --> 51:06.640]  things called ivermectin invented by the japanese but notice the fda you go to the fda's website
[51:06.640 --> 51:12.080]  and type in ivermectin and studies and you'll get a dozens of big studies around the world
[51:12.080 --> 51:17.600]  from cambridge england you name it saying how great it is and the Nobel prize but when but the google
[51:17.600 --> 51:25.920]  puts it up front the statement about you're not a horse well wilbur a horse is a horse of course
[51:25.920 --> 51:32.800]  of course that is a horse unless the horse the famous mr. red look at that ivermectin an award
[51:32.800 --> 51:39.920]  winning drug with exceptional antiviral on and on study after study Nobel prize as antiviral
[51:39.920 --> 51:48.160]  so scientists go gee it's won a Nobel prize let's try it on our patients how do we counter that
[51:48.160 --> 51:54.960]  just say they drink cow paste don't take that stuff cow take no
[51:58.400 --> 52:03.120]  i was talking to a family member about this who's been in farming and ranching and they said yeah it
[52:03.120 --> 52:06.320]  works great on cows and horses why are they freaking out i said well it's like black eyed peas
[52:06.320 --> 52:13.280]  until the 20s people only fed black eyed peas or great tasting peas by the way i'm on the tastiest
[52:13.280 --> 52:19.120]  out there in my opinion but it was cattle feed and especially people on the north
[52:19.680 --> 52:22.960]  thought that was a funny thing because some southerners would eat black eyed peas
[52:23.520 --> 52:27.520]  but then a texas growers association ran ads i think it was the new york times in the 20s
[52:28.080 --> 52:34.560]  just a few ads saying you can look this up black eyed peas are good luck on new years
[52:34.560 --> 52:41.280]  it was just an ad pitch they came up with and people started eating them on new years i said
[52:41.280 --> 52:45.840]  god they taste good i'll eat them all the time see how that works you say where you going with
[52:45.840 --> 52:52.400]  this my point is well cows eat black eyed peas i ain't gonna eat those well a cow can get better
[52:52.400 --> 52:58.800]  without a mat didn't i ain't gonna take nothing that a cow takes we're getting hungry on those black
[52:58.800 --> 53:05.680]  eyed peas with that jambalaya or whatever that is exactly mixed with some crawdads and some
[53:06.720 --> 53:13.520]  sausage home some chicken i'm not eating in black eyed peas so again it's just a mindlessness
[53:14.320 --> 53:19.760]  that they use on the public that will i mean a cow breathes oxygen i don't i don't
[53:20.880 --> 53:25.680]  cows and horses breathe oxygen you sure as hell don't need it tie this rope around your neck get up
[53:25.680 --> 53:33.040]  on a chair and jump off of it you don't need that oxygen cows cows cows breathe on gets worse
[53:33.040 --> 53:41.440]  you know what else cows and horses do they drink water you're not going to drink water that's what
[53:41.440 --> 53:49.760]  a cow drinks and the left all freaked out joe rogan i talked to him a couple days ago he says
[53:49.760 --> 53:55.680]  they don't tell anybody yet i'm gonna make the announcement he said man i went to florida went
[53:55.680 --> 54:03.360]  to a show i just thought i was hungover and man then i had these sweats and fever and i
[54:04.160 --> 54:08.160]  sure as hell went and got tested and had covid but then i took ivermectin and all the rest of it
[54:08.160 --> 54:12.720]  and man i felt a lot better the next day two days later basically totally better he was waiting to
[54:12.720 --> 54:16.160]  see what the treatment would do till he talked about it but you know i talked to him after he'd
[54:16.160 --> 54:19.040]  already been on it for a day and was already feeling a lot better he said yeah we talked about
[54:19.040 --> 54:23.360]  you know ivermectin not great it works and i know some people very close to me that had it again
[54:23.360 --> 54:29.360]  that they said it felt like a gorilla was sitting on their chest um and as soon as they took ivermectin
[54:29.360 --> 54:33.600]  within like five hours they felt better i mean even closer to me than my parents i know someone
[54:33.600 --> 54:40.560]  that had covid but i i i i deprived the media of of that uh announcement i i don't know why yeah i
[54:40.560 --> 54:44.880]  mean of course i i had it too and i took it and knocked it out in like a day but it felt like a
[54:44.880 --> 54:50.320]  gorilla was on my chest i woke up and said whoa and i went and got tested said i didn't have it but
[54:50.320 --> 54:54.960]  that's because it's a new spike protein so that's another big thing this is this is mutating and
[54:54.960 --> 55:01.920]  so it doesn't say it's the same virus they just call it covid so ivermectin ladies and gentlemen
[55:01.920 --> 55:06.320]  and that's why i've been so pissed off about this is they're trying to suppress this information
[55:06.960 --> 55:11.040]  and they don't want people to know about these treatments and it's it's just absolutely disgusting
[55:11.040 --> 55:19.760]  and i had covid a year and a half ago as well and again it was very very mild then uh this was
[55:19.760 --> 55:24.480]  this was stronger this was more intense this time uh and that's why i looked at the statistics of
[55:24.480 --> 55:29.120]  the numbers and i knew last year was way overblown they have they have schools like i said in east
[55:29.120 --> 55:35.120]  Texas it's in the news where they've got 2 000 students and 600 were out one day i checked today
[55:35.120 --> 55:40.240]  300 400 more out so the idea that you're gonna quarantine the idea that you're gonna escape this
[55:40.240 --> 55:46.880]  you're not no one's escaping this unless you're a genetic freak no one is escaping this i hadn't
[55:46.880 --> 55:53.760]  been sick for five years before i got covid last year and then sure as hell this is a new one
[55:55.520 --> 56:02.480]  and so again i got that again woke up with a fever chills like a gorilla was sitting on my chest
[56:02.480 --> 56:15.280]  boom called in the meds and we're talking five six hours gone but that is early response
[56:16.480 --> 56:21.280]  that's what that type of stuff happens and i got a lot of enemies that always make stuff up and add
[56:21.280 --> 56:25.280]  things and things so i never got into it it was a while back this this even happened and so i've
[56:25.280 --> 56:30.080]  explained to the crew and i explained to everybody else you're not gonna escape it and you're gonna
[56:30.080 --> 56:34.400]  get sick again unless you just overload yourself with vitamins and minerals and and i'm i'm taking
[56:34.400 --> 56:37.760]  ivermectin prophylactically now because you can basically take this up all the time and it's
[56:37.760 --> 56:44.880]  anti-cancer and i get it from a doctor in fact guys will you go in my office there's a big brown

[1:00:04.160 --> 1:00:12.560]  life saver to get it out to everybody you know but first um yeah i started telling people about
[1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:22.000]  three months ago that the vaccinated with the deadly mRNA injections were off gassing incredible
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:28.320]  amounts of these spike proteins that are synthetic viruses without all the medical literature all the
[1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:33.200]  facts it's a fact we go to info wars.com there's a Harrison Smith report it's about 10 minutes long
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:39.920]  that you should watch titled this graph will get you banned and it is the cdc's own graph and john
[1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:46.480]  hopkins own graph showing right at the points of the inoculations in israel in england and then the
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:53.440]  us per country that then all these hundreds of new variants pop up and new viruses and then you
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:58.400]  look at other graphs it corresponds with illnesses and death in the hospitals and i'll show you that
[1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:05.440]  coming up next segment but they do not want that out show everybody's got it everybody's
[1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:10.400]  going to get it you're being colonized by spike proteins basically the same thing that causes
[1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:17.840]  mad cow disease okay and if you lay those time dates over we've done this we shoot another video
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:22.080]  separately greg rees is a great job you ought to do it you can lay it over all the other graphs in
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:27.680]  israel and in other places showing when the variants pop up when you get the death and you get all the
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:35.760]  hospitalizations and the illnesses right along with the vaccination points so this is powerful
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:43.680]  information and they just make jokes and go oh joe rogan took horse paste joe rogan's an idiot no
[1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:48.240]  joe rogan knows more doctors anybody i know joe rogan's obsessed with science if it's in science

[1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:24.720]  you know i'm not trying to build suspense here but i'm so fired up and so angry right now
[1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:31.200]  before i hit this news this news is so ginormous is so beyond critical
[1:06:32.400 --> 1:06:36.560]  and i did like six seven hours of research last night and quite frankly in between the
[1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:40.400]  breaks i've been so busy there's a few other documents i'm digging around for that i want to
[1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:45.760]  show you out of the most vaccinated countries in the world like israel where they had the highest
[1:06:45.760 --> 1:06:51.280]  death rates and the highest hospitalization rates and the majority of those are the vaccinated
[1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:56.320]  they're sicker than those that aren't vaccinated but the vaccinator make people sick and i want to
[1:06:56.320 --> 1:07:05.920]  show you from the cdc's own website adverse reactions that they knew the vaccine would
[1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:10.800]  cause and the VAERS reporting system shows more adverse reactions in death than all vaccines
[1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:18.320]  ever put on the system since 1986 i mean this is incredible this is an exercise in murder an
[1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:22.880]  exercise to see if they can get away with it but greg rees has been knocking it out of the park
[1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:29.520]  and he's done two reports back to back that need to go mega viral yeah of course half million views
[1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:33.600]  is great only did yesterday but it needs to get two million views the new one is the mark of the
[1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:39.760]  beast has arrived went up right at the start of the show an hour and seven minutes ago it's got 37
[1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:43.760]  thousand views it needs 37 million views if you want to win this fight so it's the featured video
[1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:47.680]  at bandot video but you can't really share bandot video on twitter or facebook or youtube or
[1:07:47.680 --> 1:07:54.560]  instagram but you can share free world news dot tv here on the alex joneshow free world news dot tv
[1:07:54.560 --> 1:07:59.040]  and i'm begging you to support those local radio stations as well tell folks about them and become
[1:07:59.040 --> 1:08:04.880]  a sponsor or support their sponsors but the mark of the beast has arrived i'm going to get into all
[1:08:04.880 --> 1:08:10.560]  of that at the bottom of the hour and and major u.s states and democrat control announcing
[1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:17.360]  the official vaccine passports and more and there's just so much to get to cdc admits vaccine
[1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:22.160]  effectiveness against hospitalizations continues to fall it was never going to work folks now they
[1:08:22.160 --> 1:08:26.080]  want you to take a daily pill to be able to leave your house told you that was coming federal judge
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:31.360]  bars western michigan university for mandating covid vaccines for athletes that's good news liberals
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:36.480]  freak out after covid positive joe rogan announced he treated himself with iver mechton successfully
[1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:44.800]  an end of the bizarre cdc rent moratorium we're going to get all that power grab and just so much
[1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:51.760]  more uh that is in my stack but i want to hit this when we come back because this has been
[1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:55.920]  hiding in plain view it's gotten almost no coverage and when it first broke we got new
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:09:05.200]  documents as well it really freaked out the system at a next level okay so oops fda accidentally
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:10.480]  reveals a list of covid vaccine side effects including heart attacks autoimmune disease and
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:14.880]  death i want to actually go through this list for you and tie it in with now what's happening
[1:09:14.880 --> 1:09:18.720]  around the world in the quote vaccinated but first here's greg rees's market the beast report
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:23.360]  and one more key report these are so important it's some of the best work we do and i hope you'll
[1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:25.680]  share them because that is how we're going to win the battle
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:40.400]  kori diggs recently published a comprehensive report on the business behind the vaccine passport
[1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:47.600]  it includes every facet of banking and big tech including ibm who did virtually the same thing
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:55.200]  during world war two and in trust a company run by the prominent nazi quant family her extensive
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:10:01.840]  research spells out the plan very clearly the qr code will be the so-called mark of the beast
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:11.120]  marked like livestock and no longer free the qr code has already become the standard for dna data
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:20.480]  storage we can now scan a specimen's qr code and extract the entire genomic map and we can create a
[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:28.000]  creature from this data george church of nebula genomics explains how his company has the ability
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:34.720]  to read ancient dna write and edit it with crisper we can read the holy man with genome which is
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:38.880]  pretty amazing these things have been extinct for a long time we can read this ancient dna and we
[1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:44.320]  can now write it can edit the elephant genomes with crisper again and we've done this we've made
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:51.840]  15 edits so far of bringing back the extinct dna he said in a 2013 interview with der spiegel
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:58.160]  that dna can be assembled into an embryo and planted inside of a human woman
[1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:06.400]  church's nebula genomics wants to give people the opportunity to sell their genetic information
[1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:13.200]  for digital tokens and he has hollywood's morgan freeman to help promote and normalize
[1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:22.480]  his radical modern day frankenstein work stamping a human's dna genome onto their mark is one thing
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:29.600]  but in order to store a person's entire life onto a single qr code and have it utilized
[1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:36.480]  efficiently across the entire web they are using the blockchain blockchain technology allows
[1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:41.760]  information to be stored by a tamper proof ledger that others on the chain can monitor and
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:49.280]  validate in real time and it is being adopted in nearly every major industry with the help of big
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:55.920]  pharma and the media the bankers are corralling everyone inside their rentals wired up to the
[1:11:55.920 --> 1:12:05.040]  internet of things with a qr digital id that holds their entire dna genome on the blockchain
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:12.400]  and managed by artificial intelligence just as the rockefeller foundation announced in their
[1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:21.040]  2020 publication mapping an ai future and the uk ministry of defense in their 2021 publication
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:31.520]  human augmentation the dawn of a new paradigm marked like livestock and no longer free unless
[1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:59.920]  of course we all say no for info wars dot com this is greg reese a story from this spring is
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:06.960]  reemerging of why argentina and brazil never made a deal with phaser for the experimental jab
[1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:13.600]  in argentina phaser requested that the government pay all compensation for any lawsuits that
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:20.560]  successfully win against phaser vaccine damages argentina's parliament responded by passing a
[1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:28.080]  new law stating that phaser needs to at least pay for its own negligence phaser rejected this
[1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:34.240]  after which argentina offered to amend the law to define negligence more clearly to include
[1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:40.560]  only vaccine distribution and delivery under negligence but phaser still wasn't happy and
[1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:47.840]  demanded the law be changed argentina refused but later agreed to buy an international insurance
[1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:55.280]  policy to pay for future vaccine lawsuits this was not specific enough for phaser they asked
[1:13:55.280 --> 1:14:01.520]  for an additional indemnity from civil cases specifically that the company would not be held
[1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:09.920]  liable for rare adverse effects or for its own acts of negligence fraud or malice phaser then
[1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:15.600]  demanded the nation's bank reserves military bases and embassy buildings as some sort of
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:22.880]  collateral against future vaccine damages in brazil phaser asked for vast money reserves
[1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:28.320]  to be put in a foreign bank account that phaser be exempt from the law of the land
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:36.000]  and exempt from any side effects and all civil liability in the united states the public readiness
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:43.920]  and emergency preparedness act or prep act gives total immunity to phaser and all manufacturers
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:49.520]  of experimental jabs so there's no reason to threaten any government agency in the us
[1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:56.640]  they always knew how dangerous and deadly the radical experimental mRNA jabs actually are
[1:14:56.640 --> 1:15:03.440]  it's what the science says the only ones who say otherwise are the bureaucrats and pop culture
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:09.840]  media agents working for big pharma by every measure this is the greatest crime committed
[1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:17.840]  by big pharma out of a long list their magnum opus for the dark arts death and depopulation
[1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:23.440]  and they were setting up governments to take the fall so that the bankers can have their great
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:32.080]  reset without any resistance for info wars dot com this is gregg reese all right folks
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:39.120]  when we come back i'm going to show you the smoking gun cdc document where they knew in
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:44.640]  october before any of the shots began exactly what would happen and it's just total premeditated
[1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:48.080]  evil then we'll tie it into the global vaccine passport now officially announced by the un

[1:17:54.160 --> 1:18:02.560]  or right issue this is a global corporate agenda 21 and 2030 great reset takeover this is a
[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:10.160]  technocracy but very few leaders orbon balsamaro and just a few others are addressing it for what
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:17.840]  it is to their people a foreign anti-human anti-family anti-god takeover of the very
[1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:23.600]  biological system of humans this is a corporate takeover of our bodies of ourselves with the
[1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:28.800]  world ID the medical tracking system that will be tied to the carbon taxes it's all been announced
[1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:34.640]  it is a dystopic nightmare and humanity is starting to organize but our leaders aren't
[1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:39.680]  we need senator paul and senator holly and others that have shown some understanding of this
[1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:45.280]  and senator cruise to organize against this foreign multinational corporate takeovers or big
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:51.280]  farm of big banks and big tech or we have no hope i've been fighting as hard as i can for almost
[1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:57.920]  28 years against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted to wake up the world and
[1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:03.200]  stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people
[1:19:03.200 --> 1:19:09.600]  are awake yes we're not getting caught flatfooted but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:14.640]  deindustrialization great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:19.440]  and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and

[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is high quality

[1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:54.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:22.560]  well there's an old saying
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  no one really knows who first said it but if a tree falls in the forest and nobody here's
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:39.120]  it make a sound did it make a sound it's another old saying that you can not tell the forest from
[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:47.360]  the trees so we have earth shattering level events taking place we know exactly what happened now
[1:20:47.360 --> 1:20:52.240]  they cooked up the spike protein how they released it to create fear to create a vaccine the scientist
[1:20:52.240 --> 1:20:56.320]  said would turn our bodies into factories of it with a live virus which they've now done
[1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:02.960]  and they've got so many lawyers and politicians and doctors and media people on board that are
[1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:08.080]  heroes that even as they and their families died as our civilization collapses they're
[1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:14.400]  going to just follow that course towards the great reset not because they're even in on the
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:19.760]  depopulation plan that the top globalist are but because they love to follow the narrative that
[1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:27.840]  they're the good guys shallow stupid spiritually dead people so here's some of the giant developments
[1:21:27.840 --> 1:21:34.320]  that tie together this is on info wars.com it's a zero head story europe cdc breaks with biden
[1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:42.720]  administration says no urgent need for covid boosters five european countries have now
[1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:47.920]  suddenly said they're ending all covid restrictions after sweden has the lowest numbers in the world
[1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:53.280]  and the lowest vaccinated and just says it's all a fraud now it's other european countries have
[1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:59.600]  have joined that but if you turn on cnn everyone loves the shot everyone's taking it worldwide
[1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:06.320]  there's no side effects it's totally great and that ties into fda and rebellion over whitehouse
[1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:11.680]  rushed booster plans it's not about the booster that was one issue it was about the fda doing
[1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:17.120]  whatever it wants at the leadership level instead of listening to scientists the head of the
[1:22:17.120 --> 1:22:23.120]  virology program and saying that there is an authorization of these franken shots these genetic
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:27.840]  therapies when it was never authorized and they've just re-extended the emergency authorization
[1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:36.320]  that level of fraud is makes the theranos lady look like a choir boy it it it makes burning
[1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:42.000]  made off look like an angel cake i mean folks i'm saying the level of this attack on this fraud
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:48.160]  and the transparency of it it is mind-blowing to me and of course they said don't give it to
[1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:53.520]  children and biden's saying no we're gonna do it so now the two scientists over it said well
[1:22:53.520 --> 1:22:58.240]  we're we're out of here and we're gonna speak out when you do it and now that's the stalemate
[1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:04.480]  and finally courage just a little bit of courage is contagious and now the eu goes yeah we're not
[1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:11.120]  gonna do that because their chief advisor of the chief eu independent regulatory board
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:20.080]  wolfgang wudarg who's been the chief guy for like 18 years said last year with dr yedon the
[1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:26.720]  former head of fizer science division vaccine division this shot is going to kill everybody
[1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:31.360]  and give them blood clots and microcard ideas and heart attacks and i've got the damn reports
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:37.920]  and what did it do it did that great job crew there's the report december 1st 2020
[1:23:39.680 --> 1:23:45.200]  so we have all the facts we have the japanese scientist we have all the evidence but what
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:52.320]  does the young turks have alex jones and joe rogan are eating horse paste yeah and horses drink
[1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:58.000]  water so i don't drink water either just just the level because they're being paid folks they're
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  giving scripts let's come out top basketball players have come out football players and said
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:07.680]  yeah i was offered $200,000 i was offered $100,000 i was offered $80,000 they've all gone public
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:11.760]  to tell you how great it is and how i took it and how i feel fine
[1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:20.640]  think about it so here's the giant news and i'll give the number dot take your calls
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:24.800]  this story came out adan salazar reported in july
[1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:29.520]  time he got a little bit of attention but not the attention it needed and now it ties in with
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:34.720]  all the israeli numbers and other numbers i'll show you record hospitalizations record infections
[1:24:34.720 --> 1:24:39.040]  record deaths let me just show you one of the graphs from john hobkins
[1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:44.640]  israel has the highest cases per million in the world
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:53.760]  if the vaccine has a success it looks like it's the opposite yeah israel has the most cases in
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:59.760]  the world azur by john one of the lowest because of course they're not vaccinating
[1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:05.120]  look it up azur by john's like we're not crazy we're not taking that china won't take it india
[1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:10.320]  won't take the fizer shots everybody's like oh um we'll pass on that you you guys enjoy it
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:15.120]  but again the main target is the west the globalist don't want free countries they're taking us down
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:18.880]  and building all the new houses and stuff for the third world populations they're going to bring in
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:28.160]  oops fda accidentally reveals list of covid vaccine side effects including micro car ideas
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:33.200]  autoimmune disease and death and we're gonna go to break i'm gonna spend the whole next segment
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:40.640]  with the actual cdc document oh don't listen to evil alex jones oh you know reuters fact-checked
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:46.560]  this and said doesn't fda documents say it can cause problems well it said that might not that
[1:25:46.560 --> 1:25:52.480]  they would so we say it's false what we believe this will cause heart attacks blood clots and other
[1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:59.120]  foreign and then then it happens and they're like well we fact-checked and you know that they

[1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:04.640]  around the world happening with the live time real numbers saying just what they said oh that's crazy

[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:16.240]  only true big independent media operation that swings for the fences and tells the truth that
[1:27:16.240 --> 1:27:20.640]  it's scared and you see all the stuff in the news attacking us and all the rig courts and all the
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:24.640]  foaming at the mouth democrats and the lies and the things they're doing try to shut us down but
[1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:31.440]  because of your support we are still on air and we have major plans to expand in the face of this
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:36.400]  tyranny uh because i was quite frankly going to cut back a few years ago and and pull back because
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:39.440]  i think i'd already done my work i've already done it i've already kind of got people awake
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:43.920]  down the new order works and i was going to kind of just remove myself maybe write a book a year
[1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:48.080]  but because of the enemy attacks and their attempts to shut us down i've committed to
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:53.520]  14 hours a day seven days a week and i'm going to start seven day a week podcast special reports
[1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:58.640]  different news bureaus all over the country okay and so that takes a lot of money to do that and
[1:27:58.640 --> 1:28:03.600]  we'll be launching a lot of things the next few months but attacking me only makes me get stronger
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:07.760]  and so i need your prayers i need your support i need you to go to infowarstore.com and by books

[1:28:52.640 --> 1:28:59.200]  rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative it hurts it stinks it's got pus coming
[1:28:59.200 --> 1:29:04.480]  out of it i go to the doctor they fix it that's not negative i'm not living in denial and so think
[1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:09.920]  of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet but now it's come to the surface
[1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:14.880]  that's actually a positive thing and so yeah trump did an overall great job they stole the
[1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:22.080]  election we can't get down about that we have forced them out in the open so now they're trying
[1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:27.040]  to suppress us because they know they've been exposed they're scared that's why instead of saying oh
[1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:31.360]  we're a bunch of losers look what happened no we're a bunch of winners they're trying to suppress us

[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:47.040]  the
[1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:11.440]  they're gonna break
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:27.440]  week. You can't stop us. We're going to put the balls to the walls. Full power. Balls
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:34.160]  to the walls. I remember growing up, this was like 10 years old. My grandma goes, that's
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:41.120]  a horrible song about sex. And I said, grandma, balls to the walls means shoving the lever
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:51.360]  down in an airplane in World War II to full power. That's what it means. You may modify
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:35:03.080]  their flesh. You may modify their flesh. You're doing this now. But we're going to get you
[1:35:03.080 --> 1:35:31.160]  in the end. Let them know. No more. God bless them. You can't stop us. All right, that's
[1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:36.640]  enough of the hymns. Let's get into it right now. I'm fired up. Sorry. I just feel the
[1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:41.480]  energy of humanity rising to the enemy. I got to feel the awakening of science. I can
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:47.440]  feel our incredible influence here. We built together contending with the evil on the space
[1:35:47.440 --> 1:35:51.760]  time continuum. Can you could feel it too? Can't you? We are the tip of the spear. That
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:56.240]  means you are the tip of the spear. Okay, so let's settle down now and get into science
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:03.400]  time, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, look, US Food and Drug Administration, October 22, 2020.
[1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:15.120]  It's an eight hour 20 plus minute video that is on YouTube. You can type that in and you'll
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:21.920]  be able to pull it up. SBER plans for monitoring COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness.
[1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:27.380]  US Food and Drug Administration. Remember, the top two scientists just left and said basically
[1:36:27.380 --> 1:36:36.640]  this isn't safe and the EU just said we need to stop the shots. No more. There it is. An
[1:36:36.640 --> 1:36:42.400]  eight hour 50 minute video. Sorry. My brain dialed down and it was a whole day. So there's
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:48.680]  the video. So people always accuse me of exaggerating. It's usually the opposite. It's usually worse
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:53.800]  than I'm telling you. There's another example of that. And so let's go over the slide they
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:57.280]  put up that freaked everybody else out. Then the media tried to say it wasn't real, but
[1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:04.480]  then the CDC had it on their website and they go, no, it's real. So let's go ahead, ladies
[1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:09.440]  and gentlemen, and let's actually go to the document. And here's the page, FDA Safety
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:15.400]  Surveillance and COVID Vaccines, Working List of Possible Adverse Outcomes. And boy, did
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:19.520]  they get it just right? Let's go ahead. And I'm going to butcher these names. I don't
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:24.680]  have, you know, I'm not too good at Latin and things like that. But I know this is named
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:30.600]  after the guy that discovered it. But the point is Gion beret syndrome acute. Dismintated
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:36.960]  in cephalopathy. This was, I mean, it just, it just goes on. I've got it boiled down here
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:43.160]  in a list that's easier for me to read here. And there's a full article has it. Oops, FDA
[1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:47.840]  actually reveals a list of COVID vaccine side effects, including microcardiitis, autoimmune
[1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:51.680]  disease and death. But let me, let me just read to you the definitions of what these
[1:37:51.680 --> 1:38:05.080]  do. This acute. Disminted in cephalophilus A D E M or acute. Demulating in the cephalophilus
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:10.360]  of this, I can't pronounce this. I'm sorry, is a rare but not rare. Now, autoimmune disease
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:17.560]  marked by sudden widespread attack of inflammation in the brain, the spinal cord. Oh, goodie.
[1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:22.640]  Kind of like a polio, they say is popping up everywhere. As well as causing the brain
[1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:28.360]  and spinal cord to become inflamed. A D E M also attacks the nerves of the central nervous
[1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:37.000]  system and damages the myelin insertions, which as a result destroys white matter in
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:46.280]  the nerves in the brain. That's not too fun. Transverse myelitis T M is a rare, but not
[1:38:46.280 --> 1:38:52.920]  now neurological condition in which the spinal cord is inflamed. All the polio like disease
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:57.480]  that the FDA a few months ago said, Oh, look for lots of the polio like disease. We don't
[1:38:57.480 --> 1:39:01.480]  know what's doing. It's in the vaccinated though, and in their children because they're
[1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:07.840]  infecting them in cephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Oh, a lot of folks die with
[1:39:07.840 --> 1:39:16.840]  the brain swelling up. That's always fun. Here's anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction
[1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:23.760]  that is rapid and onset and may cause death. It typically causes more than one of the following
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:29.000]  on itchy rash, throat, tongue swelling, shortness of breath, vomiting, lightheadedness, low
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:35.400]  blood pressure. These symptoms typically come on over minutes to hours. It kind of sounds
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:42.120]  like what the virus does. Oh, the vaccine is the virus. A mitochondrial infraction commonly
[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:49.120]  known or a mitochondrial infraction commonly known as a heart attack said over where we're
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:53.600]  like, you get a car and you get a car, you get a stroke and you get a tumor and you get
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:58.280]  a cancer and you get a heart attack and you get lung blood clots and you get your uterus
[1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:10.160]  cut out and you get lymphoma cancer. Isn't that fun? Microcardiast, precardiast, inflammation
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:14.080]  of the heart muscle. Oh, that's the one killing so many and maiming others and ruining them
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:25.080]  for life. Oh, they survive from again, folks, I'm sorry, from boycott, told Pena is a condition
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:31.280]  characterized by abnormally low levels of platelets. Oh, fun, bleeding out. Also known
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:46.120]  as thrombocytes in the blood. Here's another one. Disminted intravascular coagulation. Oh,
[1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:51.520]  this is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body, blocking small blood
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:56.120]  vessels. Gee, what do all the experts predict? Turns out the CDC knew. Well, there's the
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:41:01.400]  big one. You get a heart attack, you get a blood clot, you get to die, you get to have
[1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:09.840]  convulsions, you get an autoimmune disease, you go blind, liberal, liberal, kill your
[1:41:09.840 --> 1:41:17.640]  baby, kill grandma to take the shot and you'll die too. I mean, this is just sick. How much
[1:41:17.640 --> 1:41:22.040]  are you going to take, folks? How much? I mean, because they made a run at you. They
[1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:28.480]  think you're stupid. They keep babies alive if they're born and carbs their organs. Pedophilia
[1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:35.400]  is all over the news saying this is great. Fox News and stuff down in Houston is like,
[1:41:35.400 --> 1:41:39.200]  convicted pedophiles of the kids, well, hell, got to get them all their young. That's an
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:57.040]  actual joke. They are coming at us. They are coming at us. So there you go, ladies and
[1:41:57.040 --> 1:42:02.920]  gentlemen. Oh, I'm sorry. There's more. There's more. I didn't read all the side effects.
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:13.800]  Venous, venous, thrombolism, when a blood clot forms in the deep veins. Oh, those are
[1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:21.800]  fun. Cowasaki disease is a syndrome of unknown cause that results in a fever and main effects
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:26.920]  of children five to six. It is a form of vasculitis where blood vessels become inflamed throughout
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:36.040]  the body. Oh, wonderful. Okay. And you see all the people online getting the same thing.
[1:42:36.040 --> 1:42:41.520]  You got a cowasaki. Like I got a motorcycle. No, blood bleeding out your ass and your mouth.
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:47.760]  How's that sound? I want that. I like Fauci. Even more than Trump, Mike Lindell has been
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:53.480]  out there exposing the fact that the 2020 election was stolen and his symposium was
[1:42:53.480 --> 1:42:58.760]  amazing. 90 plus percent of the information was accurate and was damning and was groundbreaking.
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:03.960]  A few poisoned pills, a few pieces of this info were slipped in to try to discredit the
[1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:09.480]  whole thing. Folks, I'm surprised the conference even happened. They had infiltrators and others
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:14.280]  that really disrupted it and tried to shut it down because Mike Lindell is over the target
[1:43:14.280 --> 1:43:19.560]  and you're over the target when you support his important investigation that is every

[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:35.720]  going to back down until we defeat them and info wars is the tip of the spear info wars.com
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:41.620]  forward slash crypto or swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex to get involved. Thank you and
[1:44:41.620 --> 1:44:51.720]  God bless. The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:57.040]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[1:44:57.040 --> 1:45:04.080]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the bohemian grove, the club of Rome. And so even though
[1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:08.920]  it seems like the globalist are winning, the truth is they've had to come out the open
[1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:15.880]  to attack human freedom because they're actually losing. We have forced them out in the open.
[1:45:15.880 --> 1:45:20.680]  So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen. Realize humanity
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:26.840]  is winning. You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:33.080]  That is invincible. That is ethereal, timeless and unstoppable. So don't trust in man, trust
[1:45:33.080 --> 1:45:37.280]  in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action against the globalist and
[1:45:37.280 --> 1:45:42.480]  realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you. We will never back
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:45.720]  down from the globalist and we will never surrender.
[1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:50.360]  It's always critical. It's always vital. It's always essential to have enough high quality

[1:45:54.120 --> 1:45:59.760]  essential. You must have them. But in today's crazy times, it is more important than ever

[1:46:48.800 --> 1:47:02.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:24.000]  So, you've seen Bill Gates and the U.N., all these publications and articles. You'll
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:29.720]  be in the grocery store. You'll see a magazine saying, the world without humans, an incredible
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:33.280]  place. You pick it up and it's how there's too many people and what the earth would look
[1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:36.600]  like when we were gone. The trees would all go back. It'd be sort of romantic. You'll
[1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:41.400]  just crawl in a hole and die and give the world over to Bill Gates. He really cares
[1:47:41.400 --> 1:47:43.800]  about you.
[1:47:43.800 --> 1:47:51.880]  But I just covered for you the incredible news of what's happening. Here's the drug adverse
[1:47:51.880 --> 1:48:02.720]  event data from the FDA and the CDC. Ivermectin has had 1,517 events since the VAERS reporting
[1:48:02.720 --> 1:48:11.760]  system started decades ago. HCQ has had 4,966. And I guess how many of the COVID vaccines
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:20.680]  have had 384,000 adverse events and many, many deaths. And that's an old low number because
[1:48:20.680 --> 1:48:29.080]  they go to VAERS and cut out 90% of the deaths and don't count them. It's just 4,812 deaths.
[1:48:29.080 --> 1:48:36.800]  So, oh, it's horse-paced. Nobel Prize is an antiviral for humans. Horse-paced. Yeah,
[1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:43.520]  horse and horses too. Just like water is good for horses. Again, we shouldn't drink water.
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:47.720]  Horses drink water. You can drink water like horses drink. You're going to take Ivermectin
[1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:55.120]  like horses do. I mean, man, this is weird. By the way, if you talk to any farmer or rancher
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:48:59.400]  that's got horses and it's got cows, they want, if they've got a big group, if they
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:03.360]  have a small group of cows or horses, they don't have a vet do it to do themselves. But
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:08.520]  I mean, I remember getting to the vet's office at 8 to 6.30 in the morning, or it was even
[1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:15.040]  light. And I'd say go over to the warehouse and get four boxes of the horse paste or whatever.
[1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:18.720]  Ivermectin. And I remember, oh, God, this is going to be a long day. We must be doing
[1:49:18.720 --> 1:49:24.000]  a lot of cows or a lot of horses. And people didn't even have worms. They knew just give
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:28.280]  it every year to your animals because they're healthier and they're better. It's an antiviral
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:34.120]  and it's an anti-cancer. And that's a fact. It won the Nobel Prize. But again, it just,
[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:39.800]  there's such enemies of humanity trying to suppress this. They're real jerks. So I've
[1:49:39.800 --> 1:49:43.760]  got a lot of news I haven't hit. I've only scratched the surface, quite frankly, today.
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:48.640]  But that last news we covered is just so ultramassive. I want to get into the whole police state level
[1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:58.080]  rollout, the worldwide ID card systems that are being expanded as well. And now that's
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:02.200]  all being announced. If I just had that in my stack and did I just move it? I've just
[1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:06.520]  got too many articles here. It's totally insane. But I also want to give the number
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:12.400]  out and take your phone calls. Now, we had some folks left on hold, four or five callers
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:18.040]  yesterday. So let's call those folks back first, get them on the line. And then I want
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:23.240]  to hear from listeners on any subject you want to discuss. But I would certainly like
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:29.240]  to hear about your take on the CDC's own October documents predicting everything that indeed
[1:50:29.240 --> 1:50:34.120]  happened just like the head EU advisor predicted it. But he said, don't do it. That was the
[1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:44.360]  difference with their regular advisers. So again, the prestige, the prestige of the
[1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:48.960]  scientists that said, don't do this. And then everything they said happened is incredible.
[1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:54.400]  So we have a lot of moral good scientists. Again, former head of the science division
[1:50:54.400 --> 1:51:01.920]  actually ran the science division of Pfizer. Dr. Yedon with Woodard said, do not do this.
[1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:06.120]  It's going to cause all the things that happened. The blood clots, the heart attacks. But the
[1:51:06.120 --> 1:51:10.800]  CDC knew to before they wrote that December emergency injunction to the EU, which they
[1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:18.760]  didn't follow, was a lawsuit by their own top advisor and the former head of Pfizer science.
[1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:25.960]  They went ahead with it. And the CDC, it turns out in October, said the exact same stuff
[1:51:25.960 --> 1:51:30.200]  in their own secret report that they leaked later and later published. And now their own
[1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:35.760]  scientists have left. How big a deal is that? We're not just going to let that fall by
[1:51:35.760 --> 1:51:40.120]  the wayside. We're not just going to have that be a blip on the radar screen. This is
[1:51:40.120 --> 1:51:45.480]  a huge, huge deal. Yesterday, I did an hour on this. We posted it's got like 200,000 views.
[1:51:45.480 --> 1:51:52.360]  It needs 10 million views. But I'm going to do it for you, for myself, for our own future.
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:56.120]  I'm going to do a short report on this that's just three or four minutes very concise for
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:51:59.920]  the documents. I'm also going to do one on, and I'm going to do it later next hour because
[1:51:59.920 --> 1:52:04.160]  I've already shoveled through my papers. You can't find the ones I was about to head.
[1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:08.200]  The world ID that's been announced, that's been rolled out by the UN now being adopted
[1:52:08.200 --> 1:52:14.000]  in Europe, Australia and in states in the United States and in Canada. What it means
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:17.040]  if you accept it? Because they're going to start saying where you can go, what you can
[1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:22.240]  do, what you can buy, according to quote, carbon footprint. And they've said that. This
[1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:27.040]  is not my opinion. But these idiots thinking, oh, I get my freedom back if I just accept
[1:52:27.040 --> 1:52:31.080]  this. Okay, I take a shot. I get a QR code. Okay, I can go where I want. I can do what
[1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:38.000]  I want. What fools? Once you do that, you are literally taking something that lowers
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:41.080]  your immune system, where you got to have this stuff for the rest of your life. You
[1:52:41.080 --> 1:52:45.200]  get sicker and sicker. They admit they want you to take daily pills. You got to videotape
[1:52:45.200 --> 1:52:49.960]  yourself taking with a phone to go out. This is a dystopia. This is a nightmare plan and
[1:52:49.960 --> 1:52:55.840]  it's been announced. And then they're going to say, oh, you get this much meat allotment.
[1:52:55.840 --> 1:53:00.680]  You get, you get to go. They call it carbon rations. This is all the official plan in
[1:53:00.680 --> 1:53:05.440]  class swabs on documents, the UN. And now the EU's announced it. And now last week and
[1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:10.720]  this week, I played the clips. Trudeau said, we're going to apply these lockdowns for the
[1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:15.960]  climate that it's already been announced. And we'll be sitting here in six months when
[1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:21.640]  they started going out at Alex Jones is like, he's got to be one of them. How did he know
[1:53:21.640 --> 1:53:25.400]  Trudeau got up on TV and said it? I mean, and again, I'm not trying to take away from
[1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:30.640]  the fact that I'm smart. I'm ahead of the curve. I care. But I mean, this, I'm so angry
[1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:36.600]  at our political establishment that's not pure evil. Like Senator Paul and Senator Cruz
[1:53:36.600 --> 1:53:41.480]  and Holly. I mean, this is world government corporate governance, world ID in their own
[1:53:41.480 --> 1:53:46.800]  words to track and trace with social credit score and put carbon taxes through the corporations
[1:53:46.800 --> 1:53:51.160]  and through all the systems where the government's passing or not. It is a total takeover with
[1:53:51.160 --> 1:53:56.440]  children's cartoons in the UK and Canada. Australia saying a global UN food council
[1:53:56.440 --> 1:54:00.320]  will control your smartphone and tell you when you get meat, where you can go, what
[1:54:00.320 --> 1:54:05.320]  jobs you have, you'll get meat once a year, all of this. No cars allowed on and on and
[1:54:05.320 --> 1:54:14.600]  on. And I'm sitting there watching the damn plan unfold in real time. And our leaders
[1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:19.920]  are light years behind on this. And you know what? I think they know, and I think they
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:24.280]  know it's too dangerous to come all the way out. And so they're just going to go along
[1:54:24.280 --> 1:54:28.200]  with it. And so it's up to us to do it. They're not going to do it. Rand Paul knows all this.
[1:54:28.200 --> 1:54:34.840]  Holly knows all this. Cotton knows all this. They all know. They all know. Yeah. Top bioethicist
[1:54:34.840 --> 1:54:39.080]  works for the Rockefeller Foundation says we're going to engineer humanity with a vaccine
[1:54:39.080 --> 1:54:44.040]  so you can't eat meat. By the way, one of the side effects of the COVID vaccine is that
[1:54:44.040 --> 1:54:49.840]  a meat allergy. And I mean, they put everything into this baby. And it's just the opening
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:54.480]  salvo. And now they'll have the precedent to put in your body what they want, when they
[1:54:54.480 --> 1:55:05.880]  want, how they want. So it's very, very frustrating. The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:18.440]  Alex 877-789-2539 and we will go to your phone calls. And like I said, I've got all the world
[1:55:18.440 --> 1:55:21.960]  ID stuff I'm going to get to at the bottom of the hour, how we counter it, what it's
[1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:27.120]  going to look like, how we stop it. And for folks that want news on Afghanistan, which
[1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:31.800]  is just part of a global stabilization program, it was always the plan. They, the globalist
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:35.880]  always ran the telebond since the 70s. They always turned them loose. They flew into safety
[1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:39.600]  after 9-11, the airlift of evil, 30,000 of them. They allowed them to attack all those
[1:55:39.600 --> 1:55:46.520]  countries like Egypt and Syria and Libya before that. And they, Obama was just helping them
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:49.480]  a few years ago and then Trump said he wouldn't do it. And the Russians said, okay, we'll
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:55.120]  come in and kill them. And they did. And so that's really what went on. So of course
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:58.200]  they're going to give them aid. Of course they're going to give them weapons. You've
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:04.240]  got to prop up these pedophiles. The Taliban aren't, all of them are into pedophilia, basically.
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:10.040]  When I said 90%, that's an understatement. The religion of that form of Islam is sex
[1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:15.560]  with little boys down to age two. That, and the CIA likes that too, so they supply them.
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:19.040]  They all go in there and screw little kids together. That's, that's what you do when
[1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:22.680]  you're in the new old order. And so I keep explaining this to everybody and now it's
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:27.000]  all over the news. Like five years ago I talked about, yeah, you know, the Taliban all keep
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:30.640]  like five-year-old boys as sex toys. I'd be like, how dare you, Islam doesn't allow
[1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:39.280]  that. No, Islam hypocritically kills men that have sex with each other. Me, adult men above
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:44.420]  the age 15, you have sex with another man. They kill you. They throw you off a cliff,
[1:56:44.420 --> 1:56:52.920]  but they screw kids. It's what they do. Okay? In fact, it's in the Quran. It says, if you
[1:56:52.920 --> 1:56:58.680]  are a shepherd and there are no women, then why with a boy? That's the religion is screwing
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:02.440]  little boys. I'm going to say it again. The religion is raping boys. The religion is
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:08.240]  raping boys. Boy rape, boy rape, boy rape. And Muhammad's married a nine-year-old. Okay?
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:15.240]  That's what it is. So, oh, Muhammad, oh, we worship you. Burn in hell, all of you. Burn.
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:21.360]  Burn in hell, Fauci. Burn. Gates, burn. Ha, ha, ha. You and your pedophile armies will
[1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:29.240]  burn. You will burn in hell. Ha, ha, ha. Get you, don't you worry. We'll be back with
[1:57:29.240 --> 1:57:31.240]  the next hour, scum.
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:40.720]  Hey, Alex. Welcome. Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason
[1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:44.400]  and amongst all this stupidity. Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold
[1:57:44.400 --> 1:57:50.960]  of you for a year. Okay? I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that
[1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:56.400]  will never go away. Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two
[1:57:56.400 --> 1:58:01.800]  years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from
[1:58:01.800 --> 1:58:07.560]  the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24, verse
[1:58:07.560 --> 1:58:14.360]  9. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you. And ye shall be hated
[1:58:14.360 --> 1:58:20.320]  of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended and shall betray one
[1:58:20.320 --> 1:58:24.480]  another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at, brother. And that's
[1:58:24.480 --> 1:58:28.880]  because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say. And that's
[1:58:28.880 --> 1:58:34.160]  why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[1:58:34.160 --> 1:58:41.040]  In late August, info or saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that
[1:58:41.040 --> 1:58:47.280]  the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[1:58:47.280 --> 1:58:52.480]  and financial collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been
[1:58:52.480 --> 1:58:56.160]  something that's important to have. It's a check box that everybody needs to have taken
[1:58:56.160 --> 1:59:01.400]  care of right along with water filtration, self defense and a relationship with God.
[1:59:01.400 --> 1:59:05.680]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in now. We're ready
[1:59:05.680 --> 1:59:10.400]  to ship to you within 24 hours of your order. It's high quality. It's very, very low cost
[1:59:10.400 --> 1:59:15.760]  at info or store.com because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages
[1:59:15.760 --> 1:59:19.560]  and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place. So
[1:59:19.560 --> 1:59:25.800]  lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and from the info or at info or store.com.
[1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:29.680]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self sufficient and not under their
[1:59:29.680 --> 1:59:36.520]  control. So get prepared now at info or store.com.
[1:59:36.520 --> 1:59:58.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show on the first part of the journey. I was looking
[1:59:58.040 --> 2:00:09.960]  at it. I don't want to play a few key clips here that are very important. I'm going to
[2:00:09.960 --> 2:00:12.880]  come back from break and go right to your phone calls. And then I did find all my articles
[2:00:12.880 --> 2:00:17.000]  about the global ID and the rest of it and how they're implementing it and how to stop
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:19.560]  it. So I want to let you know what's going to happen if you do put up, whether you let
[2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:24.640]  them put the chains on, things don't get better. But here's a few people fighting back. Here's
[2:00:24.640 --> 2:00:30.920]  a clip where a mother explains that they're not going to master children anymore. Clip
[2:00:30.920 --> 2:00:35.120]  nine. And then we also have folks fighting back and getting their exemption because they
[2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:39.440]  have natural immunity, which is 13 times better on average. And it's totally criminal to try
[2:00:39.440 --> 2:00:42.360]  to make somebody do something on top of when they already have natural immunity. Here it
[2:00:42.360 --> 2:01:02.240]  is.
[2:01:02.240 --> 2:01:05.760]  In fact, we're done asking for permission. That's right. We are going to be unmasking
[2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:12.800]  our children today. The pandemic is over. The parents are done. We're done asking you
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:18.800]  public servants for permission. We are done. You can all wear your mask. In fact, you can
[2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:23.520]  wear two masks and three masks. You can wear gloves. You can have plexiglass. You can do
[2:01:23.520 --> 2:01:27.840]  whatever you need to do to keep you safe. But we, the parents believe we have a choice
[2:01:27.840 --> 2:01:32.800]  for our children. And I don't know who you think you are, that you think that you have
[2:01:32.800 --> 2:01:38.520]  more of a say than us, the parents and our doctors. I don't know who any of you think
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:46.560]  you are. I really don't. It ends today. We are declaring our freedom tonight. We do not
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:54.160]  consent to the lies, fear, mongering and abuse. You all know it's abuse. This is tyrannical
[2:01:54.160 --> 2:01:59.000]  leadership and poor leadership. None of you are willing to stand up for our children.
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:04.120]  This is why we are all here tonight, as we're fed up. We're done asking for permission. We're
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:12.920]  done playing games. The pandemic is over. We are done. Andre, we're done. See the chairs
[2:02:12.920 --> 2:02:18.320]  that you're sitting in? We own those chairs. See these lights? We pay for the lights, not
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:24.760]  you. And I'm going to let you know. Emily, you're up in 2022. Greg, you're up in 2022.
[2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:30.680]  Marla, you're up in 2022. And Jodi, you're up in 2024. I know that myself, I would love
[2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:38.520]  to run for school. And I know many, many others. I'm going to replace all of you. So I'm going
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:43.320]  to promise you tonight that I will campaign against what I will, I will fundraise against
[2:02:43.320 --> 2:02:48.840]  you and I will make sure that none of you ever serve in a public space ever again. That's
[2:02:48.840 --> 2:02:51.840]  right. The time is up.
[2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:56.720]  Todd, along those lines, dissenters say the jury's still out. You just, you just mentioned
[2:02:56.720 --> 2:03:00.960]  that Israeli study a number of studies are touting natural immunity. What do you believe
[2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:06.480]  that means for call supporting vaccine passports and vaccine credentials?
[2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:13.080]  It's completely ridiculous. There are, there have now been 15 studies of the compare natural
[2:03:13.080 --> 2:03:19.760]  immunity with vaccines and every, an all 15 have shown that in the range of 90 to 95 percent
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:25.880]  protection, which is what the mRNA vaccines are at their peak. And now as we know, they
[2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:32.080]  wane very quickly. Another study from Israel found that vaccine protection wanes 40 percent
[2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:39.600]  a month. Natural immunity wanes 5 percent a month. And then, and so, and so, and we
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:44.160]  know that it's much better than the more mediocre vaccines like Johnson and Johnson, which
[2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:48.520]  even in the clinical trials was only about 66 percent protection.
[2:03:48.520 --> 2:03:53.760]  There is literally no doubt about this anymore. It's also very clear that natural immunity
[2:03:53.760 --> 2:04:00.000]  as we saw in the Israeli study is very resistant to, to, to variants such as the Delta variant
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:04.960]  because it recognizes the entire protein, whereas the vaccine is only used to target
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:10.400]  this narrow spike protein. And now we're actually vaccinating people against a spike protein
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:15.160]  that is now extinct and not only now extinct, it's been extinct for several generations
[2:04:15.160 --> 2:04:21.960]  of variants. And so, natural immunity has proven itself on, on this. And as we see more
[2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:25.480]  and more breakthrough infections throughout the country, there are more breakthrough
[2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:34.600]  infections in a month. There are 35,000 breakthrough infections a week is what the CDC estimated.
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:37.160]  There have been more breakthrough infections just this spring than that.
[2:04:37.160 --> 2:04:43.160]  And here the guy goes, the jury's still out. Total horse crap. The jury's not out.
[2:04:43.160 --> 2:04:47.840]  Just a week ago we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock and it was
[2:04:47.840 --> 2:04:52.720]  only half of the order we wanted to get. But because we won't cut corners on the quality
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:57.200]  of what goes into it, the factory can only get limited supplies. So again, it was half
[2:04:57.200 --> 2:05:02.280]  the order we wanted. But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33 percent off so everybody
[2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:06.080]  on the fence will get it. It's critical for your immune system and your whole body. All
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:09.880]  the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals and a bunch of key amino acids at
[2:05:09.880 --> 2:05:16.040]  mfowarstore.com. So while supplies last until it runs out, we're selling it for 33 percent
[2:05:16.040 --> 2:05:21.680]  off and it'll be months till more comes in. So get yours today at mfowarstore.com because
[2:05:21.680 --> 2:05:25.440]  it's not just a great product. We need those funds to keep operating as well. We're all
[2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:30.280]  in a catch-22. But we have another great product, hair and beard formula that's really a great
[2:05:30.280 --> 2:05:35.120]  multivitamin mineral system that's one of the best multivitamin mineral systems out there.

[2:05:39.080 --> 2:05:42.680]  for women, great for children, but it's designed for men in mfowarstore.com.
[2:06:09.080 --> 2:06:30.520]  It's such a beautiful song. You know, I can't help but get fired up in the face of this
[2:06:30.520 --> 2:06:35.320]  attack. I'm just like a dog when I see somebody approaching my territory and attacking me.
[2:06:35.320 --> 2:06:42.640]  I get my hackles up and start snapping. It's time, though, to get down on our knees to
[2:06:42.640 --> 2:06:48.640]  God and begin to pray and really seek repentance, seek that quiet place, the most high that
[2:06:48.640 --> 2:06:52.840]  King David talked about. And I get in that quiet place the most high and see things
[2:06:52.840 --> 2:06:59.760]  so clearly. But when I get up here on air and just cover all this news, I get angry because
[2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:03.360]  I know this stuff backwards and forwards, up one side, down the side, just like a lot
[2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:08.160]  of you do. And I see all these lazy people in the system just following scripts they're
[2:07:08.160 --> 2:07:16.680]  given for money, but they're taking part in Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030, which is the public
[2:07:16.680 --> 2:07:22.200]  goal of the megabanks who took the world over through fraud and now don't want us around.
[2:07:22.200 --> 2:07:25.960]  They've got automation, they've got computers, and they've got their argument. There's too
[2:07:25.960 --> 2:07:28.840]  many people and they've got their argument that we don't care and we're stupid. And if
[2:07:28.840 --> 2:07:35.120]  we don't stand up to them, we do kind of deserve what happens. I don't, you don't, but the
[2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:39.120]  sheep will do, but still doesn't matter. If we're going to save ourselves, we got to
[2:07:39.120 --> 2:07:46.880]  save them. And the children don't deserve this happening to them. And God's watching
[2:07:46.880 --> 2:07:53.800]  us. All right, I want to go to your phone calls. James and Riley and Laura and Jordan
[2:07:53.800 --> 2:08:02.800]  and Alan and Kyle and Sonny and Josh and Emmanuel and many, many others here today. And then
[2:08:02.800 --> 2:08:09.080]  as I said, there are large quadrants of news that I have not gotten to on critical race
[2:08:09.080 --> 2:08:16.080]  theory and on China, male girly behavior banned, China cracks down on sissy men, says it's
[2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:21.440]  CIA propaganda to destroy the family and their country, which it is. If you want to be a
[2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:27.800]  sissy man, that's up to you, but they're doing it to undermine the culture and undermine
[2:08:27.800 --> 2:08:32.560]  the society and China funds Hollywood owns four of the six production houses. And that's
[2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:39.240]  why they fund race war and cystification. By the way, you saw the little comedy thing
[2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:44.960]  with the sake, Jen sake and that weird guy, the long fingernails. I mean, that guy looks
[2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:48.280]  scary as hell. He doesn't look a feminine. It's like a woman. I wouldn't turn my back
[2:08:48.280 --> 2:08:53.840]  on that guy. Would you like that got to be your accountant? How about your kid's babysitter?
[2:08:53.840 --> 2:09:04.560]  He's a deranged lunatic. And I'm not saying ban it. I'm saying that when it's being pushed,
[2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:08.920]  it's a destroy civilization and that's why it's there. And we have Hillary's own emails
[2:09:08.920 --> 2:09:14.160]  with the head of a major university psychology department and she's losing the election. It's
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:18.880]  about six months. The election and they go, what are we going to do? Increase the culture
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:21.720]  war? And she says, well, we've already increased it to like as high as we go. He goes, no,
[2:09:21.720 --> 2:09:30.880]  we can do it much higher. Attack all the foundations. And that means your jobs, women's spaces,
[2:09:30.880 --> 2:09:35.080]  men's spaces, children's spaces. It's all about you don't get any space. You don't get
[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:38.680]  any rest. You don't get any dignity. You don't get your own area. You don't get your own
[2:09:38.680 --> 2:09:46.480]  autonomy. Psychology today, feminizing boys as we masculinize girls, but the girls really
[2:09:46.480 --> 2:09:57.120]  aren't masculine. They are worker bees of the system. It's a scientific plan. I mean,
[2:09:57.120 --> 2:10:07.000]  well, you talk about a magic trick, turning everybody into this guy. Okay, let's go ahead.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:12.800]  I mean, the Taliban would have fun with him. Let's go ahead and take some calls here. Talk
[2:10:12.800 --> 2:10:18.600]  to Jordan in New Jersey, a pharma scientist. Let's talk about vaccines. Why took the vaccine?
[2:10:18.600 --> 2:10:21.320]  Tell us what happened. Thanks for calling, Jordan.
[2:10:21.320 --> 2:10:27.240]  Thank you, Alex. I'll try to see as brief as possible. Well, I took it back in March.
[2:10:27.240 --> 2:10:32.760]  I had been out of the pharmaceutical industry for a number of years. I became an attorney,
[2:10:32.760 --> 2:10:37.560]  and I saw immediately some neurocognitive issues. I don't know how else to describe
[2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:46.520]  it. She also had the irregular menstrual cycle as well, and she had been in an IED for,
[2:10:46.520 --> 2:10:53.160]  I forget how long, you know, not even having her period. Total Stockholm syndrome, anything
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:54.880]  more?
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:11:00.960]  Man, what is going on with our phone system? This happened yesterday at the end of the
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:05.360]  show, and it just happened again. Well, at least he got part of it in. We may have to
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:09.600]  go back to analog phone lines. Who knows? Make sure nobody's messing with the phone
[2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:14.160]  system on the other side, please, for God's sakes. Okay, let's go to Josh in Florida.
[2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:18.960]  Sir, call back. We'll get you back on air. I apologize. Josh in Florida, go ahead.
[2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:26.840]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to make a comment on the state of the Internet and how this
[2:11:26.840 --> 2:11:36.200]  all ties in to everything with the COVID pandemic. So, in the past, they would do death by a
[2:11:36.200 --> 2:11:44.360]  thousand cuts. Now we're in a modern siege where it's more like death by a thousand
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:53.400]  stabs, where each stab can be the end. This is all tie-in.
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:12:00.960]  Okay, there's definitely something wrong with our phone system. So, this is two days
[2:12:00.960 --> 2:12:05.760]  in a row. I'm going to put the order in to have an engineering crew come in here and
[2:12:05.760 --> 2:12:10.680]  put seven analog phone lines in, because I don't know what's going on around this haunted
[2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:15.160]  house, and I'm not mad. We've been having a lot of technical stuff, and I want to just
[2:12:15.160 --> 2:12:21.840]  explain this to listeners here. We have to build our own infrastructure. Satellite up
[2:12:21.840 --> 2:12:27.400]  links, encoders, servers, systems. We have to hide what companies we've got, where we
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:32.960]  put them up because we're hunted, we're attacked, we're sued to shut us down. Remember, your
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:36.680]  iPhone has a trillion dollars of investment in it. Google has trillions of investment
[2:12:36.680 --> 2:12:41.840]  in it. We have tens of millions of investment that you've supported us with to build our
[2:12:41.840 --> 2:12:46.160]  own infrastructure, our own TV, radio, network system, our own crew, our own people, and
[2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:50.720]  I'm very, very, very, very thankful. And we're trying to upgrade our equipment. We've upgraded
[2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:54.800]  a bunch of it in the last month, and we have a lot of systems that network things, and
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:13:00.600]  I think that may be it. So we may have to go back to analog phone lines, because I'm
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:03.720]  not going to accept the thing where we can't take calls. That's just not going to happen.
[2:13:03.720 --> 2:13:12.880]  I want to take your calls. The caller was making incredible points, and obviously we've
[2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:20.480]  got an issue, so I'm going to try as best I can. Let me just go ahead and hit some of
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:28.040]  this other news here quickly, okay? Male girly behavior banned China crackdown kicks
[2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:35.000]  sissy men off TV. Former House Committee votes to require women to register for the military
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:42.320]  draft. Total slavery. You have a right now, women to be a slave. All inclusive university
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:49.560]  cultural center host barbecue intended for everyone but white people. That happens at
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:54.360]  every major university now teaching you racism. And that whites are bad. DHS fears Taliban
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:14:05.000]  takeover could inspire uprising by US insurrectionist and white supremacist CNN claims. CNN claims.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:09.120]  They had one anonymous post somewhere saying, man, look at that Taliban. Boy, they sure
[2:14:09.120 --> 2:14:14.280]  kicked the US government's ass so can we. That turns into the main new threat for ejection
[2:14:14.280 --> 2:14:19.040]  is veterans, gun owners and conservatives. They say we are now the Taliban, even though
[2:14:19.040 --> 2:14:24.160]  it's the globalist funding and running and arming the Taliban. See the inversion of reality,
[2:14:24.160 --> 2:14:30.520]  and of course the Taliban are pedophiles like the Democrats. Wow, can't make this up. Biden
[2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:36.080]  had meant to help build new border facilities on Tajikistan and Afghan border to respond
[2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:40.560]  to security threats, but we don't get a border. Of course, they're going to use that border
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:46.480]  to actually bring the Afghans in to Europe. The UN sets those up as the invasion point.
[2:14:46.480 --> 2:14:50.640]  Right administration sending Afghans to swing states where they will be housed and fed. And
[2:14:50.640 --> 2:14:54.640]  of course, Democrats in the New York Times says let anybody, including someone that just
[2:14:54.640 --> 2:14:59.720]  got here a day ago, vote. Whoever said you need to be a citizen to vote. And boy, they're
[2:14:59.720 --> 2:15:04.840]  going to one of these Afghans just shot up a police station and killed a lady and a bunch
[2:15:04.840 --> 2:15:08.240]  of stuff in Dallas, but you didn't ever hear about it on the news. This happened two days
[2:15:08.240 --> 2:15:16.160]  ago. DHS fears Taliban takeover can inspire. Yeah, right. A new survey of Biden's job approval
[2:15:16.160 --> 2:15:22.400]  rating is out. It's not looking good in swing states. But it doesn't matter. He has electronic
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:25.700]  voting fraud and it's ballot stuffing with all they're going to have all those mail-in
[2:15:25.700 --> 2:15:29.840]  ballots again. They're going to shut us down next year for sure during the whole election.

[2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:52.680]  message you'll hear this year. Here's why. We now have a small number of solar generators

[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:18.200]  enemy and trying to stop their agenda, and we've also got to get personally prepared.

[2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:45.960]  Do you think it's a bad trait of Mike Lindell that he's so optimistic that he's so positive?
[2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:50.800]  No. It's that type of optimism that built this country. We would have never defeated
[2:18:50.800 --> 2:18:55.840]  the British 250 years ago if we didn't have a lot of optimism and we didn't persevere.
[2:18:55.840 --> 2:19:00.440]  George Washington lost most of his major battles, but he kept fighting for six years and finally
[2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:05.000]  we won. Well, Mike Lindell has been fighting as a man in the arena and he's continuing
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:09.960]  to expose serious issues in the 2020 election. We need to keep him in the fight. Plus, he's
[2:19:09.960 --> 2:19:14.360]  got hundreds of incredible, made in American products, not just pillows, not just towels,
[2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:20.400]  not just sheets, not just beds. And he's got up to 66% off at mypillow.com with promo code

[2:20:00.120 --> 2:20:10.120]  Moving through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:17.640]  I think somebody's hacked into the digital phone system. We've had stuff like this before
[2:20:17.640 --> 2:20:21.160]  and they're hanging up on people when we go to them. We're rebooting the system and changing
[2:20:21.160 --> 2:20:26.520]  the passcode. Change the passcodes around here on a more routine basis, but people get attached
[2:20:26.520 --> 2:20:32.280]  to passcodes. That's okay. It's Tim Koskay. He runs death camps too. That's all that matters.
[2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:36.120]  He's liberal and he's got a special shot for you and your family. I'm going to get to Tim
[2:20:36.120 --> 2:20:40.360]  Cook and Apple. They're helping organize with Google all the phone apps with the UN and
[2:20:40.360 --> 2:20:44.800]  the Rockefeller Foundation where you won't be able to leave your house or start a car
[2:20:44.800 --> 2:20:50.840]  by food unless you're in good steds with them. We're going to be talking about how liberal
[2:20:50.840 --> 2:20:59.440]  it all is in just a minute. Speaking of liberal, we spa transgender. Hold on. You guessed it.
[2:20:59.440 --> 2:21:07.080]  Turns out to be a registered sex offender facing multiple and decent exposure felonies.
[2:21:07.080 --> 2:21:14.400]  He went to a gym spa into the women's bathroom where they have a hot tub in front of an eight-year-old
[2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:20.600]  girl and her mother and grandmother. I guess the mother, you bathe naked in there. He came
[2:21:20.600 --> 2:21:25.560]  in there with his dingaling and just said, you started telling him, you like my dingaling?
[2:21:25.560 --> 2:21:31.200]  He talked to him about his Johnson and showed it to him and freaked him out. Then the Antifa
[2:21:31.200 --> 2:21:38.040]  came and beat people with lead pipes and stabbed people because they protested. Antifa with
[2:21:38.040 --> 2:21:44.640]  all their big bathomet tattoos and all the rest of it. They just came and stabbed and
[2:21:44.640 --> 2:21:52.360]  beat with lead pipes their heroes. Oh, those evil Asian women in an Asian spa. They thought
[2:21:52.360 --> 2:21:57.640]  they'd go steam and hot tub with their family and sit around and bond as women. But guess
[2:21:57.640 --> 2:22:02.760]  what? A registered sex offender that likes to expose himself. The old perverts with the
[2:22:02.760 --> 2:22:11.480]  trenchcoats. Those are heroes now. In California, you can give people HIV and hepatitis. You
[2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:20.000]  don't get in trouble on purpose. It's so progressive. Yes, the transgender and individual who sparked
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:25.400]  massive protest and public debate after they flaunted their male genitals. Oh, but they're
[2:22:25.400 --> 2:22:30.120]  women. They're women. So it's okay. In front of women and underage girls in Los Angeles,
[2:22:30.120 --> 2:22:34.200]  we spa have been found to be registered sex offenders. And guess what's happening all
[2:22:34.200 --> 2:22:39.760]  over California and other states? That's what's happening in California and all those other
[2:22:39.760 --> 2:22:44.760]  states. They're Democrat. They're having per prison four, five, six, seven, eight, 10,
[2:22:44.760 --> 2:22:52.080]  12, 14 babies born. And it says in the news, a woman not a woman pregnant. Because if you'll
[2:22:52.080 --> 2:22:55.360]  accept that you'll you'll drink Kool-Aid with cyanide and you'll do whatever you're told.
[2:22:55.360 --> 2:23:02.520]  You'll take vaccines that don't protect you, that kill you and demand more. And so when
[2:23:02.520 --> 2:23:08.320]  I got arrested for DWI, which they dropped because I blew under like I told the police.
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:14.800]  It's legal to be in a restaurant and drink maybe a glass and a half of sake. I mean,
[2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:19.960]  it was a little bottle to me and my wife, tiny little bottle hours before. And I said,
[2:23:19.960 --> 2:23:26.120]  officer, I had to have a bottle of sake, small sake, boom, arrested. But that's not the story.
[2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:32.400]  When I get down to downtown jail, I'm sitting there back then shaved head beard. I built
[2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:37.720]  like a gorilla and the woman looks right at me and says, are you a man or a woman or
[2:23:37.720 --> 2:23:42.280]  what sex are you? And I said, I'm a man sort of giggling. She goes, don't giggle. It's
[2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:48.960]  not funny. Are you transgender? And I said, actually, I am transgender. She goes, don't
[2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:51.600]  mess with me. If you really are, we're gonna put you with the women. I said, yeah, of course
[2:23:51.600 --> 2:23:56.240]  I'm joking. So you guys are a bunch of weirdos, man. So I'm not saying they're all bad. The
[2:23:56.240 --> 2:24:02.320]  point is, is that it's a freak show. And she said later, she goes, well, after I blew
[2:24:02.320 --> 2:24:05.840]  under and all of it, she goes, well, I understand. I just have to ask those questions. It's
[2:24:05.840 --> 2:24:09.040]  horrible. The men that say they're women and we got to put them in with the women and they
[2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:11.720]  said, and they have so sexually assault them and stuff, but I'm not supposed to talk about
[2:24:11.720 --> 2:24:18.160]  it. No kidding. I mean, because I was in there with a bunch of pretty mean dudes. I mean,
[2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:23.600]  there was methods, drug addicts and guys in there for armed robbery and stuff. And you
[2:24:23.600 --> 2:24:30.120]  know, it was, it was not fun. And I was only in there overnight. And I wish I'd have got
[2:24:30.120 --> 2:24:34.560]  drunk before I got out there. It was super boring just sitting there all night. No TVs,
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:40.760]  no nothing. You're just locked up. And it's a side issue. It's just totally insane that
[2:24:40.760 --> 2:24:46.000]  that's the freak show of virtue signaling. What gender are you?
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:50.320]  All right, let's continue here and I'm going to hit the big news. We come back and they
[2:24:50.320 --> 2:24:53.960]  rebooted the phones. We'll see if they work when I go back. I apologize. The listeners
[2:24:53.960 --> 2:25:01.880]  Reddit band's vaccine skeptic sub Reddit just days after CEO promised to defend descent.
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:06.400]  Yeah, you can't tell your stories of death or show even the foreign statistics or national
[2:25:06.400 --> 2:25:10.320]  numbers or even CDC documents. You got to just sit there and let us bully you into submission
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:14.920]  into death. After all, I mean, Leonardo DiCaprio needs to be able to go to a national park
[2:25:14.920 --> 2:25:20.960]  and not have any people there. You know, Leonardo DiCaprio's into eugenics, into world government,
[2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:25.720]  into Klaus Schwab personally vacations with him. He'll be an enemy in the future. He'll
[2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:32.840]  be long after Schwab's gone. We'll be fighting him. Be real nice to him and see him in person.
[2:25:32.840 --> 2:25:38.600]  Let him kill you. Okay. He's better than you. He's a Hollywood star. Why? He's a little
[2:25:38.600 --> 2:25:44.680]  kid. Probably got passed around back then back with Titanic time. James Cameron wants
[2:25:44.680 --> 2:25:49.240]  world government eugenics and the population. Oh, yeah, he's involved. I guess that's probably
[2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:56.920]  you turned old Leonardo onto the club, the club we ain't in the club where we all die.
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:05.720]  Now, when we come back, because I still got some time here, but I'm going to come back
[2:26:05.720 --> 2:26:10.280]  and eat some time on this and I'll go to your calls. The Orwellian vaccine passport agenda
[2:26:10.280 --> 2:26:16.040]  relies on the lie of the social contract. Very important article by Brandon Smith. Alt
[2:26:16.040 --> 2:26:20.760]  that market.us. We're going to cover that. North Korea rejects offer of nearly three
[2:26:20.760 --> 2:26:27.240]  million Sinovac COVID-19 shots. So China's refused all of ours and now North Korea won't
[2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:33.840]  trust China. I wonder what they know that we don't know. Old Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il's
[2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:43.040]  little darling son. But when we come back, the vaccine passport nightmare system and
[2:26:43.040 --> 2:26:50.640]  more, the information they don't want you to know. Separately, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:54.000]  I just want to stay in the fight. It's all I care about. I am more committed now than
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:57.360]  ever because now I know I was right about everything. And now I know the globalists
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:01.880]  are as bad as we thought they were. They're worse. And I know that we've had a big effect.
[2:27:01.880 --> 2:27:05.400]  I know the globalists are in trouble. I know their agenda is not going well. That's why
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:11.680]  they went ahead and went all out with this bum rush. And I know that I've already paid
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:16.520]  quite a bit and I'm going to pay more for what I've done. So I want to make sure we
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:20.120]  win. This is really personal for me. I know it's personal for you. They're coming after
[2:27:20.120 --> 2:27:24.720]  you and your family. So there isn't a place you can spend money to get better products
[2:27:24.720 --> 2:27:28.960]  that make your life better. And at the same time, funding an organization dedicated to
[2:27:28.960 --> 2:27:32.840]  take on the globalists. And I'd love to be way out in the black and have a whole bunch
[2:27:32.840 --> 2:27:38.080]  of extra money to try to do that. But what happens is when I bring sponsors on, that
[2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:41.640]  just brings down how much we sell in the shopping cart. So I'm just always like in this
[2:27:41.640 --> 2:27:47.760]  equilibrium zone of projects I could do that would really devastate the globalists, but
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:54.080]  I don't have the cashola. So go get your vitamin mineral fusion. Go get your natural defense.

[2:30:50.160 --> 2:30:56.880]  we're under a great reset UN globalist attack. But none of our leaders other than Bolsonaro
[2:30:56.880 --> 2:31:03.000]  and Trump a little bit seem to understand that. And so no one is addressing the fact
[2:31:03.000 --> 2:31:09.040]  that this is a 21st century corporate economic war on the general population and the conversion

[2:31:21.800 --> 2:31:27.360]  movement. This is their takeover. They admitted it. They've said it to know the Prime Minister
[2:31:27.360 --> 2:31:32.640]  Canada's on TV yesterday saying this is an environmental takeover plan. And the whole
[2:31:32.640 --> 2:31:37.320]  lockdowns of just talking to prepare for climate lockdowns. So they're announcing their takeover.
[2:31:37.320 --> 2:31:41.920]  We've got a resistance. They know I'm not funded by George Soros. I'm not funded by
[2:31:41.920 --> 2:31:45.520]  the Democratic Party. I'm funded by you. We got great products you need. We got great

[2:32:42.080 --> 2:33:05.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[2:33:05.920 --> 2:33:11.320]  It's Alex Jones. Okay, we got the phone system back up and I think I'm just gonna open the
[2:33:11.320 --> 2:33:15.160]  phones up again tomorrow, but the whole four hours. I want to take a lot of your calls
[2:33:15.160 --> 2:33:19.080]  and I'm sorry we didn't get to you. Things have glitches, things have issues, but Jordan
[2:33:19.080 --> 2:33:23.960]  was able to get back in the pharma scientist called back and I believe the memory you were
[2:33:23.960 --> 2:33:30.680]  talking about a girlfriend or somebody close to you. She has had major health problems
[2:33:30.680 --> 2:33:35.960]  since she took the vax brain fog, uterine problems and then the phone system kicked
[2:33:35.960 --> 2:33:42.120]  you off. Go ahead, Jordan. Thank you, Alex. Glad I got back through. So in any event,
[2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:46.440]  you know, she, she had all of it. She had the false positive on the breast cancer screen.
[2:33:46.440 --> 2:33:52.040]  She had the kidney reexamination. You name it. The one thing she didn't have, thank God
[2:33:52.040 --> 2:33:57.600]  was a cardiac arrest or anything of that nature or stroke. Although she is now having
[2:33:57.600 --> 2:34:02.320]  some, some strange effects there, but it led me to do a lot of research and put on my
[2:34:02.320 --> 2:34:07.080]  old information pharmaceutical, information scientists pharmaceutical hat. And I just
[2:34:07.080 --> 2:34:10.440]  want to share this with everybody. I talked to Owen Troyer on the war room about this
[2:34:10.440 --> 2:34:18.600]  in the past. And I want everybody to be alerted to the N3 program. That's N is in Nancy 3
[2:34:18.600 --> 2:34:24.720]  program by DARPA who heavily funded these Moderna shots. Okay. There's a whole team
[2:34:24.720 --> 2:34:31.080]  of people, one of whom was Charles Lever who Dr. Merritt has pointed out on numerous occasions
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:37.200]  on various platforms. Are you still there, Alex? I am, brother. Okay. So this whole
[2:34:37.200 --> 2:34:43.360]  Lever thing is part of the, it's the talent, the Chinese have a program that Lever was
[2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:49.600]  a part of, as well as other notable scientists in nanotechnology. Okay. Now the N3 program
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:55.640]  is part of, it flows out of the brain initiative started by Obama during the Obama administration.
[2:34:55.640 --> 2:35:01.000]  I urge everybody look into all of this. Now there's multiple different projects that all
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:05.480]  has to do with the singularity by and large and the internet of things and all the rest
[2:35:05.480 --> 2:35:09.360]  of it. Sure. And how big is it? I know you're going that the Japanese have now confirmed
[2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:13.800]  and canceled the Moderna shot because it has liquid nano metal in it and it's killing people.
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:18.040]  Looks like we put too much of the metal in. But what I've scientists have told me is they're
[2:35:18.040 --> 2:35:25.000]  basically putting a trackable digital plug into all of us. Correct. That is, and I, and
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:28.760]  I verify the research and I'm going to launch my own website and I'll try to get through
[2:35:28.760 --> 2:35:34.680]  to your own and announce it so that it's a resource of published papers of these people.
[2:35:34.680 --> 2:35:41.840]  Now it's the thousand talents program by China and all this stuff is also involved with Dastic
[2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:46.680]  and the rest of it. Now the key to the N3 is that they plan in their plan and this is,
[2:35:46.680 --> 2:35:50.440]  you can go look this up. If you search this on the internet because they just, I remember
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:55.920]  Obama, Obama puts tens of billions into the brain and advanced interfaces and nano tech
[2:35:55.920 --> 2:36:02.680]  for the brain. I remember Obama launches the brain program with MIT. Yes. And this is part
[2:36:02.680 --> 2:36:06.720]  of what they're doing and this ties into the transhuman aspect of it. You're right about
[2:36:06.720 --> 2:36:12.160]  it killing people, but the people that survive, they want them to be fully integrated, right?
[2:36:12.160 --> 2:36:17.080]  And to do testing on them. So they're using us as guinea pigs. That's exactly what they're
[2:36:17.080 --> 2:36:21.440]  doing. This is a transhumanist revolution. Schwab said we are going to take over your
[2:36:21.440 --> 2:36:26.600]  body and your very sales. This is a rape. Yes. And what, what they did with these,
[2:36:26.600 --> 2:36:32.920]  these, um, brain research through advanced, innovative, neuro technologies or the brain
[2:36:32.920 --> 2:36:38.120]  initiative. Correct. And N3 is the DARPA program and they dumped and it's public fact. They
[2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:41.880]  dumped hundreds of thousands. It's not millions or hundreds of millions of dollars into Moderna
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:47.160]  who never released a product to market until this. And then Moderna releases it and Japan
[2:36:47.160 --> 2:36:52.120]  bans it because it's got liquid nano metal in it. Yes. And, and, and, and what they,
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:56.560]  they stated in their own research in their own public documents, they do news reports
[2:36:56.560 --> 2:37:01.120]  to tell is a big company in this, but everybody look up B, A, T, E, L, L, E. Okay. They're
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:04.160]  taking over the next phase of this because of what happened with Lieber. So they had
[2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:07.600]  to cut out part of Harvard and MIT because it was compromised by the Chinese because
[2:37:07.600 --> 2:37:11.840]  there's two different factions here of these gold copies or multiple ones. Right. So what,
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:17.240]  what the plan was to insert DNA in a specific neuron, right? Or R, R, N, in this case, M
[2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:21.880]  RNA, right? And have them make proteins. So the protein spikes are not just to kill
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:25.960]  people. They have cytotoxic effects. You're right. Everybody's right about that. But the
[2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:30.280]  proteins themselves set up what's called a PPI. It's a protein, a protein interface
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:34.560]  system. So, and this is so that the first type of protein absorbs light when a neuron
[2:37:34.560 --> 2:37:39.160]  is fired. Okay. To detect, detect a neural activity. And this is the looser phase thing.
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:43.920]  This is all being injected in everybody to, to, to, to track neural activity and to also
[2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:49.280]  manipulate it. So this is very important. Everybody knows that this is part of this
[2:37:49.280 --> 2:37:54.120]  program and this whole Japanese disclosure is hugely important. And, and this is a weakness
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:37:57.640]  and this has to be exploited by every info warrior out there. And I just wanted to get
[2:37:57.640 --> 2:37:59.800]  that through to you, Alex. And I'm glad I was able to get a hold of you.
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:03.520]  I'm glad you called, brother. You should come on as a guest sometime, send us your information.
[2:38:03.520 --> 2:38:06.680]  I get his information. Because everything you're saying, I've already read the report,
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:10.880]  you're a scientist. So you can, you can come on and explain it to us. But people, this
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:15.520]  is a year of 2021. They're really making this move. And so Moderna obviously is the most
[2:38:15.520 --> 2:38:20.680]  magnetic injection, same stuffs in the Pfizer. And the best we can tell is it's some kind
[2:38:20.680 --> 2:38:26.720]  of metal ring structure protein that grows in the body. So they, it doesn't just travel
[2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:31.480]  around. You notice they give you a big injection. Most vaccines are tiny bit. This is a lot
[2:38:31.480 --> 2:38:36.600]  because they are loading you up and then it replicates in your body. And those that doesn't
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:42.480]  take too, or those that overproduce die. Those that underproduce have the cell matrix grow
[2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:50.160]  in you. This is unbelievable, folks. This is real. This is the, this is the total takeover.
[2:38:50.160 --> 2:38:58.400]  Graphene based micro monitors constructed by micro scales. Yep. And that's what DARPA's
[2:38:58.400 --> 2:39:02.880]  been up to. So I mean, they don't want to just rape your children. They don't want to just
[2:39:02.880 --> 2:39:10.280]  rape your privacy. They are raping you. And there they are producing the black material,
[2:39:10.280 --> 2:39:14.160]  the little nanoparticles to track you, put it in your body. And I remember back with
[2:39:14.160 --> 2:39:20.280]  the H1N1, the year before they put H1N1 out, quote, is a simulant virus in the flu. And
[2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:25.200]  then it created the flu the next year. That came out in the news. Yeah, there they are
[2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:30.760]  with the graphite, the graphene oxide creating the black metal substance they put in your
[2:39:30.760 --> 2:39:34.440]  injections. Wow. That guys remind me at the end of the show to shoot a special report
[2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:39.600]  on this and give this to Gregory's. Spanish study finds Pfizer vaccine contains high levels
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:45.360]  of toxic graphene oxide, which is where they're making the Moderna shot is in Madrid. And
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:48.840]  that's what you take here, which what you take in Japan. I mean, folks, they just think
[2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:55.520]  you're an idiot and they can kill you. I mean, it's just very able. Okay, they want to merge
[2:39:55.520 --> 2:39:58.520]  with machine. They said they're going to merge with silicon. They're testing it on us. They're
[2:39:58.520 --> 2:40:02.240]  going to find out who can survive, who can do it. Then they're going to basically kidnap
[2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:07.000]  you, suck your blood out, create an immortal cell line that is able to merge with machine
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:10.560]  and then give it to themselves. That's just one little side things. I didn't say that's
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:14.560]  scary. That's the truth. They will murder you and your family. That's their main goal.
[2:40:14.560 --> 2:40:19.600]  But become God in the process in the sacrifice of you and your family. All right, Michael
[2:40:19.600 --> 2:40:23.640]  got cut off yesterday when the phone system failed. He's back on. Glad he got on. Michael
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:27.080]  and Mass about genetic rewrite. That's exactly where we are. You had a question and you got
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:31.320]  cut off. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, thanks for getting me back on again. I knew you didn't hang up
[2:40:31.320 --> 2:40:36.520]  on me because I had you on my TV. But anyways, so yeah, can you hear me? I can't. But yeah,
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:41.480]  thanks, Alex. Anyway, so like, yeah, when you say like a genetic rewrite of the planet,
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:46.240]  like I remember you just like reposted that like alien covenant special you did like like
[2:40:46.240 --> 2:40:50.640]  a couple of years ago, but you reposted it and you referred to it in there too. So like,
[2:40:50.640 --> 2:40:55.000]  I was just wondering if you could like tie that together. Like what, like, what do you
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:59.360]  mean by that? Like what's the connection that they were really telling us in alien covenant
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:03.880]  and Prometheus? And how does that tie into like the vaccine to like this vaccine now?
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:08.320]  Can you like kind of yeah, that was that was I did that alien covenant report eight years
[2:41:08.320 --> 2:41:15.200]  ago, nine years ago. And of course, got banned off YouTube, but it's posted it posted it banned
[2:41:15.200 --> 2:41:20.040]  on video now. And in that movie, they tell you what they really think. And they think
[2:41:20.040 --> 2:41:27.560]  we came from aliens from Sirius. That's in all the Babylonian and Egyptian carvings.
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:32.840]  And before the director came out and said it, I said that this is their religion is
[2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:38.200]  Transpermia and all this other stuff. And so they believe aliens made us that the aliens
[2:41:38.200 --> 2:41:42.800]  are us. And that they have to depopulate the earth before the aliens will come and give
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:47.760]  them advanced life. So that's why in the next episode of the Prometheus movie, you know,
[2:41:47.760 --> 2:41:53.360]  it's the extermination of that planet of humanoids by their own species. And so it's all like
[2:41:53.360 --> 2:41:58.520]  modifying our DNA, like with this first, like with this vaccine, they're marking us
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:02.120]  for death. I mean, they're preparing it's a binary weapon. They're also testing to see
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:06.720]  who they can merge it with. And they're just they believe that playing God means you build
[2:42:06.720 --> 2:42:12.080]  worlds, you destroy worlds. I'm gonna hold you over. Get to understand every culture gets
[2:42:12.080 --> 2:42:15.800]  taken over by this group, and then they do human sacrifice. They they and then finally
[2:42:15.800 --> 2:42:22.160]  they want to kill themselves as well to then merge with the new silicon planet they're
[2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:27.720]  building. And so all of that is basically an allegory in these films. We'll come back
[2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:32.360]  and explain it all. Look, their main mission is murder you and your family, murder you
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:40.840]  and your family. Even more than Trump, Mike Lindell has been out there exposing the fact
[2:42:40.840 --> 2:42:47.360]  of the 2020 election was stolen. And his symposium was amazing. 90 plus percent of the information
[2:42:47.360 --> 2:42:53.960]  was accurate and was damning and was groundbreaking. A few poison pills, a few pieces of this info
[2:42:53.960 --> 2:42:58.000]  were slipped in to try to discredit the whole thing. Folks, I'm surprised the conference
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:02.840]  even happened. They had infiltrators and others that really disrupted it and tried to shut
[2:43:02.840 --> 2:43:08.600]  it down because Mike Lindell is over the target. And you're over the target when you support
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:13.960]  his important investigation, that is every Americans right to do to contest an election.
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:17.120]  If you think that there was issues, look what the Democrats have done over the years. And
[2:43:17.120 --> 2:43:21.520]  he's continuing his investigations and continuing his work. So it's more important than ever
[2:43:21.520 --> 2:43:26.360]  to support what he's doing at my pillow dot com and to support info wars at the same time
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:32.480]  with promo code Alex up to 66% off on hundreds of amazing made America products at my pillow

[2:44:57.560 --> 2:45:04.920]  addressing it for what it is to their people. A foreign anti human anti family anti God
[2:45:04.920 --> 2:45:10.360]  takeover of the very biological system of humans. This is a corporate takeover of our
[2:45:10.360 --> 2:45:14.960]  bodies of ourselves with the world ID the medical tracking system that will be tied
[2:45:14.960 --> 2:45:21.000]  to the carbon taxes. It's all been announced. It is a dystopic nightmare and humanity is
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:25.880]  starting to organize but our leaders aren't. We need Senator Paul and Senator Holly and
[2:45:25.880 --> 2:45:30.760]  others that have shown some understanding of this and Senator Cruz to organize against
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:35.800]  this foreign multinational corporate takeovers or big pharma, big banks and big tech or
[2:45:35.800 --> 2:45:41.400]  we have no hope. Just a week ago, we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion
[2:45:41.400 --> 2:45:45.920]  back in stock and it was only half of the order we wanted to get. But because we won't
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:50.640]  cut corners on the quality of what goes into it, the factory can only get limited supply.

[2:46:40.320 --> 2:46:55.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show final segment of this hour. I'm going to host some
[2:46:55.280 --> 2:46:59.760]  of the next hour of the J dark takes over the last 45 minutes. The war room three punitive
[2:46:59.760 --> 2:47:04.000]  day with Owen shroyer every day we're on air is a blessing every day that you realize you
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:09.040]  are the info war and tell folks how you're listening and how they can tune in is amazing.
[2:47:09.040 --> 2:47:13.040]  Okay, briefly next hour and I'm going to get into some of the world ID and how it's rolling
[2:47:13.040 --> 2:47:18.080]  out and how to stop it in my view. And what will happen if we don't stop it? Because it's
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:23.360]  the big enchilada. It's the big issue. And Greg Reese's amazing report that's posted
[2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:29.160]  at info wars.com or it should be if it's not the market, the beast has arrived is so incredibly
[2:47:29.160 --> 2:47:35.840]  important. But let's go back to Michael and mass. Michael, they believe that depopulating
[2:47:35.840 --> 2:47:42.240]  us again is an act of God. And Ray Kurzweil and all them say, we will depopulate you.
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:47.600]  We must do this to become the gods. I don't believe in God. I will become a God. He goes
[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:53.120]  and I will step on you like a bug. Or maybe I'll keep you like a houseplant. And so if
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:59.360]  we roll over to these psychos, then then then we deserve what we get. But yeah, you've heard
[2:47:59.360 --> 2:48:03.040]  me talk about a genetic reroute of the planet. They say over saving the earth, get rid of
[2:48:03.040 --> 2:48:06.880]  the humans. They don't care about toxic waste or death. They say they're going to build
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:12.200]  any worlds they want. They talk about it. They're transhumanist literature that they're
[2:48:12.200 --> 2:48:18.000]  going to be gods. But they all say we must first transcend humanity. The carbon life
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:21.200]  form is horrible. That's why they have Wall Street Journal articles about looking forward
[2:48:21.200 --> 2:48:25.600]  to the end of humanity. COVID has showed us we're failed. We're never going to rise again.
[2:48:25.600 --> 2:48:29.760]  We must give up our bodies. That's what they're up to. Anything else, Michael?
[2:48:29.760 --> 2:48:35.520]  Yeah, I was just going to say, I think your analysis about, because most of the papers
[2:48:35.520 --> 2:48:41.680]  for COVID, it seems like it's a two to a five year plan. So what I think is going to happen
[2:48:41.680 --> 2:48:46.640]  is this winter, when everyone's immune systems down from no sunlight, vitamin D, and then
[2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:51.040]  the vaccine lowering their immune system, they're going to spike the death rate this winter,
[2:48:51.040 --> 2:48:56.080]  just like they did in spring 2020. You know how it was like coronavirus death in spring 2020?
[2:48:56.080 --> 2:49:01.040]  One. And then the next day, it was like $10,000. Like they just spike it. Exactly. But sir,
[2:49:01.040 --> 2:49:07.520]  sir, let me just tell you, let me just tell you, the life expectancy of the US just went down
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:13.040]  in the last six months, two years. It didn't go down last year. It just went down two years,
[2:49:13.040 --> 2:49:19.280]  just from the amount of death from the vaccines and the shedding. I mean, a January 6th lawyer
[2:49:19.280 --> 2:49:22.320]  is now in a ventilator. I have a zero hedge article. I'll cover next segment.
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:28.320]  Schools everywhere are closing. People are deadly all over. They have a gorilla on their chest.
[2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:32.800]  This is real. And it's mainly vaccinated people. People have been around vaccinated people.
[2:49:32.800 --> 2:49:36.640]  So you're going to see way more debt this winter and this fall than you saw last year.
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:41.280]  I totally agree with you. And it's all engineered. They're going to blame the unvaccinated when
[2:49:41.280 --> 2:49:46.240]  it's them, people like Mitt Romney, though, the shedders that have taken the aborted fetal tissue,
[2:49:46.240 --> 2:49:53.360]  grown, cloned human genomes and are now the cancer factories. I mean, Mitt Romney is a
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:58.560]  demonic being now that's taken on the body of dead children and producing cancer. He's literally
[2:49:58.560 --> 2:50:04.400]  like a big black smokestack just belching satanic evil while that Satanist tells you
[2:50:04.400 --> 2:50:08.800]  that you are the devil and tells you that you're bad and you're infecting people
[2:50:08.800 --> 2:50:14.240]  when he is nothing but an antichrist puppet. I appreciate your call. All right, let's go to
[2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:19.760]  Frank in South Africa. Frank, you're on the air. Welcome. Hi, Alex. How are you?
[2:50:20.400 --> 2:50:24.640]  Man, I'm just watching the depopulation began, brother. Everything they foretold, it's happening.
[2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:30.720]  Okay. So let me just say this. I just want to say first things first. I honestly believe that you
[2:50:30.720 --> 2:50:35.520]  truly are God sent. Second of all, I do want to tell all the people out there, please, if you can,
[2:50:35.520 --> 2:50:40.720]  you have to support Alex, Mike Lindell, all of these guys because everything that's happening
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:46.400]  around us, this was ordained by God. So that's the first thing. Next thing I want to say, Alex is
[2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:51.600]  I've been following the Illuminati now probably for about 21 years. I've been following you for 20
[2:50:52.240 --> 2:50:57.600]  and I've been trying to convert people for two decades now. And unfortunately, over the last
[2:50:57.600 --> 2:51:02.160]  six months, I have lost every single friend I've ever had. I've had fights with family because
[2:51:02.960 --> 2:51:06.960]  everybody's just going for the vaccine. They just falling in line with the system because
[2:51:06.960 --> 2:51:11.040]  it's spiritual. It's spiritual. They're locked in a spiritual bondage.
[2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:15.600]  Well, look, here's the thing that I've been studying the Bible and I've been comparing
[2:51:15.600 --> 2:51:20.080]  the Bible to world events my entire life. Everybody thinks I'm crazy. Nobody understands
[2:51:20.080 --> 2:51:24.880]  what's going on except for literally like five people. My dad, unfortunately, is one of them.
[2:51:25.440 --> 2:51:29.760]  Me and him have never been close in our lives. And the truth is, let me say it like this.
[2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:36.560]  What's really happening is this all started in 2020. 2030 is the end of the line for these guys
[2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:41.120]  or for us depending on what happens. But look, we do know what happens there and Jesus is going
[2:51:41.120 --> 2:51:46.720]  to come back. No, you're right. The globalists all say by 2047, they must have defeated us.
[2:51:46.720 --> 2:51:51.840]  All humans must be exterminated and merged with Lucifer's machine or they're going to be destroyed.
[2:51:51.840 --> 2:51:56.960]  They say they must kill everyone by, they say they say we will be complete. Humans will be
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:04.400]  eradicated by 2047. Let me say it like this. I do want to have a lot more of conversation with you.
[2:52:04.400 --> 2:52:09.520]  Like I can speak for hundreds of hours about this topic, but there's just too many things to
[2:52:09.520 --> 2:52:13.760]  cover in such a short space of time. So I just want to make it short. My question to you is like,
[2:52:14.320 --> 2:52:18.000]  what would you want me to tell you about the future? Because I'll tell you.
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:21.920]  Well, brother, I'm glad. I think, I mean, if you say tell you about the future, I think we also
[2:52:21.920 --> 2:52:27.680]  determine the future. We're on a path. Satan has his plan, God has his plan and we work through that
[2:52:27.680 --> 2:52:33.360]  and it's a test, but I really appreciate you calling and listening for 20 years. You want to
[2:52:33.360 --> 2:52:40.720]  comment on the mark of the beast and this whole system? Yes. So look, obviously the system started
[2:52:40.720 --> 2:52:46.960]  a long time ago. Computers was basically the birth of AI because the beast that we read of in the
[2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:52.800]  Bible is actually AI. And what's happening is this black matter that they've been farming at CERN
[2:52:52.800 --> 2:52:59.200]  for the last few years is now actually alive because that's how demons come from into dimensionals,
[2:52:59.200 --> 2:53:05.200]  into our physical reality. Now they're fusing it with human DNA. So what the VAX project is all
[2:53:05.200 --> 2:53:09.920]  about is they're vaxing as many as they can. And I promise you, let's start following up. Where are
[2:53:09.920 --> 2:53:13.920]  all the corpses going and happening? Because I believe they're going to use those corpses to
[2:53:13.920 --> 2:53:20.160]  examine what happened to the DNA because they are looking for compatibility. They're dying.
[2:53:20.160 --> 2:53:24.640]  Their genes and their race is dying. They've been interbreeding for too long through the bloodline.
[2:53:24.640 --> 2:53:29.600]  They are dead and dying. And now they want fresh meat. You know, this is how... And that's why all
[2:53:29.600 --> 2:53:34.240]  the royals and Rothschilds all say we want to get rid of all humans. They just sort of London
[2:53:34.240 --> 2:53:39.360]  Guardian headline saying we want all humans exterminated. That's the headline. We are going...
[2:53:39.360 --> 2:53:44.800]  I mean, they're doing it. But because they don't see themselves as human. There it is. I campaign
[2:53:44.800 --> 2:53:49.520]  for the extinction of the human race. With us gone, other species will have a chance to recover.
[2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:53.360]  That's just making you feel guilty so you die. They want to take everything over.
[2:53:53.360 --> 2:53:55.920]  You think a psycho that wants to kill all humans cares about the earth?
[2:53:56.880 --> 2:54:01.360]  Not at all. Look, actually what they're doing to the earth is called terraforming. So what they're
[2:54:01.360 --> 2:54:05.680]  doing is they spraying chemicals. They actually what they're doing is they're loading it with lead.
[2:54:05.680 --> 2:54:10.960]  And I'll tell you why. Because a David Ike mentioned something many years ago, and he talked about
[2:54:10.960 --> 2:54:17.040]  how they basically copper blood so they can live in a much thinner oxygen atmosphere than humans
[2:54:17.040 --> 2:54:22.880]  can. So that's why they polluting the air because they're climatizing, first of all, our genetics.
[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:27.840]  Well, there's no doubt they want lower oxygen levels. The earth's never had this low oxygen levels
[2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:31.600]  or this low carbon dioxide. I mean, it's gone up the last 100 years. But before that,
[2:54:31.600 --> 2:54:36.080]  carbon dioxide was hundreds of times higher. Oxygen was way higher. We lived longer. You're
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:38.800]  absolutely right. God bless you, Frank. I got to get to everybody, okay?
[2:54:40.560 --> 2:54:44.560]  Wow, there's so many big new articles at m4wars.com. Outrage parents address school board after
[2:54:44.560 --> 2:54:49.840]  Project Veritas exposes a Marxist teacher indoctrinating them. And here's the big
[2:54:50.720 --> 2:54:53.280]  article here saying kill all humans on earth, London Guardian.
[2:54:54.960 --> 2:54:56.880]  And of course, that's right before they release the bio weapon.
[2:54:56.880 --> 2:55:02.400]  Or right after they started in January 10th last year. Thank you, sir, for the call.
[2:55:03.600 --> 2:55:11.440]  Great points. Okay, who's up next here? That would be Justin in California. Justin, go ahead.
[2:55:13.360 --> 2:55:18.880]  Hey, sir. Thank you. Colin from San Diego. And I first wanted to talk about the county
[2:55:18.880 --> 2:55:24.160]  commissioner meeting that we just had, where they were discussing the misinformation about COVID.
[2:55:24.160 --> 2:55:32.160]  And then I wanted to run an idea by you after that. Go ahead, sir. Cool. So I have a couple
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:37.040]  bullet points here. First of all, Nathan Fletcher is the chairman of our county commissioner board.
[2:55:37.040 --> 2:55:41.280]  And he actually has a profile page on the World Economic Forum. So I'm not sure how many people
[2:55:41.280 --> 2:55:45.680]  know about that. But it's kind of interesting to check that out. He's also known campaign
[2:55:45.680 --> 2:55:50.080]  contributions from George Soros to this man. And when we were all down there, you could just tell
[2:55:50.080 --> 2:55:54.560]  that he wasn't listening to anything that any of us were saying. We had hundreds of speakers that
[2:55:54.560 --> 2:56:00.960]  signed up, waited all morning, all day to speak to this man, to this board. And you could tell it
[2:56:00.960 --> 2:56:06.320]  was just, you know, going right through him. He didn't care what we had to say. And I wanted
[2:56:06.320 --> 2:56:11.600]  to point out that out of all those people that were there to speak, there was no pro speakers
[2:56:11.600 --> 2:56:18.320]  for the agenda item that he was proposing. There was no pro speakers in person. They only called
[2:56:18.320 --> 2:56:22.320]  in. And every one of them, I listened to every one of these calls from home, I was down there in
[2:56:22.320 --> 2:56:27.520]  the morning, I went home, listen to every one of them on the live stream with my AirPods in.
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:33.440]  Not one of the only people that called in to voice their support, they were all medical
[2:56:33.440 --> 2:56:39.760]  professionals. They were all representing some some sort of medical, you know, establishment,
[2:56:39.760 --> 2:56:45.920]  some sort of critical care center, some something a doctor's association, they were they were all
[2:56:45.920 --> 2:56:52.400]  obviously paid by or by by big pharma. And even they showed video, they had these video segments
[2:56:52.400 --> 2:56:57.120]  that they showed, and it was just junk, it was peer propaganda. And anyone that has eyes to see
[2:56:57.120 --> 2:57:03.680]  can tell that it was propaganda. It was so obvious. And the against, this is the other thing I want
[2:57:03.680 --> 2:57:07.440]  to point out, there are several that called in against that that would have been on our side,
[2:57:08.080 --> 2:57:12.400]  basically saying, and if anyone doesn't know what this was about, it was basically saying that the
[2:57:12.400 --> 2:57:18.320]  county commissioner board or the county can can now determine what is misinformation. So, if we
[2:57:18.320 --> 2:57:21.600]  say I've run that's right, they now officially come out and want to make it illegal to have free
[2:57:21.600 --> 2:57:28.160]  speech. Thank you for the call. The purpose of fear is to call us into action. And there is plenty
[2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:34.400]  to be afraid of today. Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating
[2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:39.840]  experimental injection, because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[2:57:39.840 --> 2:57:45.360]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked
[2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:51.360]  up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken
[2:57:51.360 --> 2:57:56.720]  from the spell, we know this is all really happening. And it's unbelievably unsettling to see. But
[2:57:56.720 --> 2:58:02.640]  there is only two things to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game. If enough
[2:58:02.640 --> 2:58:08.240]  people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[2:58:08.240 --> 2:58:13.600]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end. And so we must prepare, get up to a years
[2:58:13.600 --> 2:58:20.000]  worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios,
[2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:28.800]  and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com. In late August, info or saw an explosion of
[2:58:28.800 --> 2:58:35.040]  orders. Because our audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing the planet
[2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:41.200]  by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[2:58:41.200 --> 2:58:44.800]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[2:58:44.800 --> 2:58:49.120]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[2:58:49.840 --> 2:58:54.320]  self defense and a relationship with God. But now more than ever, you need to get your
[2:58:54.320 --> 2:58:58.880]  storable food orders in now. We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[2:58:58.880 --> 2:59:04.320]  It's high quality. It's very, very low cost at infoorstore.com. Because in the future,
[2:59:04.320 --> 2:59:08.960]  you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases
[2:59:08.960 --> 2:59:13.600]  that are already taking place. So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund
[2:59:13.600 --> 2:59:19.920]  the info war at infoorstore.com. That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient
[2:59:19.920 --> 2:59:35.840]  and not under their control. So get prepared now at infoorstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:50.800 --> 3:00:16.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome into the fourth hour. J. Dyer has come up about 15 minutes.
[3:00:16.240 --> 3:00:21.040]  I'm finishing up with your amazing phone calls right now. I'm sorry this is so dystopic. I'm
[3:00:21.040 --> 3:00:27.520]  sorry it's so scary. I hadn't even read this article about Paul Ehrlich who wrote Ecoscience as
[3:00:27.520 --> 3:00:33.120]  the textbook for fluoride in the water and poison vaccines co-written with John P. Holder in the
[3:00:33.120 --> 3:00:38.400]  White House Science Hour of Obama. This is just as humans are a horrible species, kill everyone,
[3:00:38.400 --> 3:00:43.520]  kill all the children, kill, kill, kill. And how beautiful that is. Don't go to space,
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:48.880]  don't have new technology, just kill everybody. Because humans are, I mean, they want you to
[3:00:48.880 --> 3:00:54.240]  believe that and take that on so they can just brush you aside. And you wonder, oh, but the
[3:00:54.240 --> 3:00:58.480]  very same people love you so much and want you to take a shot because they care about you.
[3:01:00.640 --> 3:01:08.240]  And I guess paradoxically, if we let less night, who's like drooling over, you know,
[3:01:08.240 --> 3:01:15.120]  all of us dying, you're like, I got a vasectomy. It just looks like a pervert to me. These people
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:18.160]  are all about just sick freaks who get off on death and now they're going to control everything.
[3:01:18.880 --> 3:01:23.920]  Hey, how about you just blow your head off, buddy? How about you just take a,
[3:01:23.920 --> 3:01:27.040]  take a shotgun and blow your own head off? I'm not going to hurt you. I don't want to harm
[3:01:27.040 --> 3:01:33.680]  against you. I'm just saying, if we all need to die, how about you die? And the voluntary human
[3:01:33.680 --> 3:01:40.640]  extinction movement, he runs that and the media praises him and he praises extinction rebellion.
[3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:44.720]  Yeah, but none of you guys want to go extinct, do you? You freaking vampire.
[3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:50.000]  Let's talk to Laura in the great state of Texas. Laura, go ahead. Welcome.
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:02:02.640]  Hey, Alex. Hi. Hey, my brother today is going up against the board of commanders in the Air Force.
[3:02:03.840 --> 3:02:12.800]  He's an officer and he objects to the COVID vaccine and based on religious reasons.
[3:02:12.800 --> 3:02:25.840]  And I'm very upset because, you know, the Afghan Taliban in the PG media commander was talking about
[3:02:25.840 --> 3:02:34.240]  how they are given a choice is the vaccine. Seven thousand of them were brought over here in Washington
[3:02:35.520 --> 3:02:39.440]  and they're giving us all that they get a choice, which they should. They should be brought here,
[3:02:39.440 --> 3:02:43.680]  by the way. But yeah, they don't have to take it. But our military that's captive slaves do. Yeah,
[3:02:43.680 --> 3:02:49.440]  because it's not our military. It's run by globalists. Yes, exactly. And my brother,
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:59.760]  he refuses and there's a lot of military that are refusing and resigning. There's even military
[3:02:59.760 --> 3:03:05.040]  doctors coming out saying like 80 percent of our military are coming back with tumors.
[3:03:05.040 --> 3:03:12.000]  Well, here's what's going on. After you win a war, you usually spike the cannons that they're
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:17.440]  spiking your brother. And so they give them special shots that are even more deadly. And
[3:03:17.440 --> 3:03:24.160]  you understand this isn't our government anymore. It's long gone. And that the arguments is the
[3:03:24.160 --> 3:03:27.920]  laws there that just don't let them know about the proper exemption law. This is still an
[3:03:27.920 --> 3:03:31.840]  experimental shot. You can't give troops an experimental shot. That's what they did the
[3:03:31.840 --> 3:03:38.320]  quote announcement that it's authorized because it's not an authorized shot. They just created a new
[3:03:39.040 --> 3:03:45.040]  designation re extending the emergency authorization that is not an approved drug. That's why the two
[3:03:45.040 --> 3:03:51.360]  heads of the FDA virology quit. So your brother needs to know that information. He needs to do it.
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:55.600]  He needs to do a written order and a written response back to them. And he's to go up the
[3:03:55.600 --> 3:04:00.640]  chain of command. They're going to trick him to refuse his direct officer. I mean, he should
[3:04:00.640 --> 3:04:10.400]  know all that if he's an officer. He actually is a security officer in the Air Force. And he's
[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:20.080]  way he got a bachelor in law. So he knows he actually trains other troops, you know, that's
[3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:23.440]  great, Laura. Well, listen, we're all under attack, you know, not just your brother. So
[3:04:23.440 --> 3:04:27.600]  pray for him. Pray for the world. But yeah, this is it. This is the takedown of America. This is
[3:04:27.600 --> 3:04:31.680]  the soft kill of our country. The breakdown of supply chains. I mean, this is it. We're under
[3:04:31.680 --> 3:04:36.320]  attack. This is World War four. We'll be right back. Thank you. In these insane times, I wouldn't

[3:05:50.000 --> 3:05:54.400]  male, female, you name it. We love God and love justice. We're all brothers and sisters together,
[3:05:54.400 --> 3:06:00.160]  but I want to be 100 trillion percent clear. I don't say any of this stuff to be shocking.
[3:06:00.160 --> 3:06:09.440]  I don't say any of this to be a shock jock. I'm about 98% accurate. I've made a few mistakes over
[3:06:09.440 --> 3:06:14.080]  the years. I've been sucked into honey traps, political honey traps. I've been sucked into fake
[3:06:14.080 --> 3:06:18.400]  stories to kill other real stories. And I've learned how the tricks work. And I've got a lot
[3:06:18.400 --> 3:06:22.800]  of knowledge now and I'm learning more all the time. It's a process. And I'm just very thankful
[3:06:22.800 --> 3:06:29.680]  to all of you over the years being supportive and keeping us on air. And I know it's hard to
[3:06:29.680 --> 3:06:36.480]  deal with this. And I know it's hard to come to grips with it. I've only just now in the last year
[3:06:36.480 --> 3:06:42.080]  and a half, almost two years now of this globalist attack, come to grips with what we're facing. And
[3:06:42.080 --> 3:06:47.920]  I just gave it to God and prayed to God. And God's really energized me. I've been given a lot more
[3:06:47.920 --> 3:06:51.840]  strength and I think it's your prayers out there too. So thank you because this has been rough.
[3:06:52.640 --> 3:06:56.720]  And I don't give the enemy attention. I don't talk about what they do to me behind the scenes.
[3:06:56.720 --> 3:07:03.600]  It's been substantive. But I just take it now. I'm not a masochist, a sadomasochist. I don't like
[3:07:03.600 --> 3:07:13.040]  pain. But I just take the attacks and the pain now as I'm over the target. And that's just what
[3:07:13.040 --> 3:07:19.440]  this comes down to is that I've now passed the threshold where the pain has become actually
[3:07:19.440 --> 3:07:25.440]  pleasure. And I get God's miracle. It's amazing. And I'm getting stronger all the time. I'm not
[3:07:25.440 --> 3:07:30.480]  all the way there yet, but I'm basically almost, and it's all, it's God, a hundred percent of your
[3:07:30.480 --> 3:07:35.760]  prayers, like a force field. I mean, I'm 10 times stronger than I was five years ago. And it's
[3:07:35.760 --> 3:07:40.880]  exponential. And quite frankly, I can't even handle the level of discernment. I know you're
[3:07:40.880 --> 3:07:46.560]  feeling it too. You're experiencing and the enemy knows we've got that relationship with God, the
[3:07:46.560 --> 3:07:51.040]  Creator of the universe, that we're resonating with all the good that God created and that we're
[3:07:51.040 --> 3:07:55.600]  getting closer to God. And that's why they're panicking and wanting to kill everybody. And so
[3:07:55.600 --> 3:08:00.320]  we cannot let them get us down. We cannot let them get us depressed. It's very sad. They're
[3:08:00.320 --> 3:08:04.880]  killing people. It's very sad. They're attacking. It's very sad. All this is happening. But
[3:08:05.840 --> 3:08:11.200]  we became decadent. We forgot God and God is going to let the dust be judged. And out of that,
[3:08:11.200 --> 3:08:15.120]  we're going to be much stronger. They put a graph up that I've seen many times. It's a meme over
[3:08:15.120 --> 3:08:23.200]  the last few years about hard times make strong men, strong men make good times, good times make
[3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:33.200]  weak men, weak men make hard times. And it just, it's true. It's true. And when you see the spirit
[3:08:33.200 --> 3:08:38.640]  of laziness and the spirit of selfishness in people, they just don't, they don't understand it
[3:08:38.640 --> 3:08:43.600]  because they've been raised in front of a television set. It's not their fault. And it's so important
[3:08:43.600 --> 3:08:47.680]  to forgive our minion level enemies. I don't mean the globalists that know what they're doing, but
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:51.920]  the average leftist is a sad, desperate prisoner
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:08:59.360]  who is imagining through reflected glory with their two or three worthless degrees and all
[3:08:59.360 --> 3:09:03.520]  the shots they're getting and everything that's happening to them that, that, that they're part
[3:09:03.520 --> 3:09:09.600]  of the system at their winners. They just don't understand it. So we've got to reach out to those
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:15.680]  that want to hear the truth, but also not be hateful towards the demon possessed, you know,
[3:09:15.680 --> 3:09:21.440]  minions because they're gone folks. They're people we lost. They were spiritually aborted.
[3:09:22.640 --> 3:09:27.840]  And, and it's, it's, it's a loss. It's, it's God's not happy about it. And we shouldn't sit there and
[3:09:27.840 --> 3:09:33.600]  look at the horrible state they're in and feel good about ourselves. We could be like that at any time
[3:09:33.600 --> 3:09:38.400]  if we don't have the Holy Spirit, it's got to be constantly entering us, constantly blocking the
[3:09:38.400 --> 3:09:43.520]  enemy just constant. That's what you've got to constantly just have it like it's like water,
[3:09:43.520 --> 3:09:47.360]  just like a big imagineer. When you see a big flood gate open and water is like,
[3:09:48.240 --> 3:09:49.840]  that's the spirit of God you want to feel is like,
[3:09:51.520 --> 3:09:56.080]  and if you don't feel that, you need to really get, get to praying folks because
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:10:00.560]  the enemy's coming in like a flood, but the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[3:10:00.560 --> 3:10:04.400]  I'm not talking about your little devil church, your Glitterburg church or any of that stuff.
[3:10:04.400 --> 3:10:10.080]  I'm talking about the God of the universe and you better get under those wings and you better do it
[3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:16.240]  fast because this is it. I mean, it's on and they're not going to back off now. The extermination
[3:10:16.240 --> 3:10:21.200]  is just going to accelerate. Bible says Satan will kill one fourth of the earth, conservatively,
[3:10:21.200 --> 3:10:27.760]  with pestilence. And that's about where this is going right now. And we're the main target
[3:10:27.760 --> 3:10:34.080]  as Christian nations, the remnant, because this was a Christian country and Europe was Christian,
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:39.360]  the devil is trying to destroy those areas because of the ideas. All right, let's go to your phone
[3:10:39.360 --> 3:10:44.880]  calls. Who's been holding the longest here? That would be Tyson in Kansas. Go ahead, Tyson.
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:54.320]  Hello. Yes, sir. Welcome. Hi, Alex. I'm calling because it's actually been several weeks. I
[3:10:54.320 --> 3:11:00.400]  wanted to call sooner, but I hadn't had the time off during the day. I got a phone call
[3:11:00.400 --> 3:11:07.200]  from somebody who was claiming to be working with some sort of like sub organization under
[3:11:07.200 --> 3:11:11.520]  Planned Parenthood. And I asked them several questions and they said that they were also
[3:11:11.520 --> 3:11:17.040]  working in conjunction with something I believe it was called been a few weeks since I've seen
[3:11:18.240 --> 3:11:22.080]  websites. So forgive me if I get the name wrong. I think it was called knock on every door,
[3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:29.520]  which was some sort of anti-Trump organization. Yeah, that's contact tracers. It's all the
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:34.160]  Democratic Party. It's all the Clinton Global Initiative and Google. And they've got, yeah,
[3:11:34.160 --> 3:11:38.960]  they've got all those different names and they're targeting red areas and swing states.
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:42.640]  Then the same people put on a different ball cap and they go in their contact tracers.
[3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:46.640]  It's kind of like in the movie Romancing the Stone where the evil colonel is a police officer. He's
[3:11:46.640 --> 3:11:51.280]  also a general. He's also a businessman. They just put different hats on. And then they're just,
[3:11:51.280 --> 3:11:56.080]  they're getting intel for a laptop computer in their car or an iPad that they load intel
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:11:59.280]  in on you. Yeah, I would not open your door. I would not talk to them.
[3:12:00.480 --> 3:12:03.760]  Yeah, I was wondering where they got the information from because somehow they knew
[3:12:03.760 --> 3:12:07.920]  that I would be somebody who was not vaccinated. And I asked them where they got,
[3:12:09.040 --> 3:12:12.400]  where they got my number and everything. And they said it was in the public domain. I'm just
[3:12:12.400 --> 3:12:17.760]  thinking it's funny. I mean, Planned Parenthood former head is the CNN anchor that says,
[3:12:17.760 --> 3:12:21.680]  take people's children away forcefully. I mean, they didn't get to abort you and your
[3:12:21.680 --> 3:12:26.400]  mama, bro, they're coming to abort you now. You understand that? Yeah, I do understand that.
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:31.520]  And they asked me and they asked if I was vaccinated. If I needed information on areas
[3:12:31.520 --> 3:12:35.120]  where I would just hang up on them. I would give those enemies no information.
[3:12:36.240 --> 3:12:39.840]  I gave them false information. I told them that we were all vaccinated,
[3:12:40.480 --> 3:12:44.880]  but which I don't know what they'll do with that now that that's out on the airway. But
[3:12:45.760 --> 3:12:49.360]  yeah, it was pretty disturbing. And when I tried to call the number back even,
[3:12:49.360 --> 3:12:54.080]  it was just a little recorded voice that said, thank you for calling Planned Parenthood.
[3:12:54.080 --> 3:12:58.560]  Sure, you know, you know what lazing a target is, right? That's when they send the military
[3:12:58.560 --> 3:13:03.120]  and the advanced guys, the scouts to mark where targets are so they can drop bombs.
[3:13:03.120 --> 3:13:09.200]  Those are just average $20 an hour people that go out and then put data in a database for later
[3:13:09.200 --> 3:13:13.520]  real contact tracers to come drag you and your family out. And they're already preparing them
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:16.720]  and getting and they want that image of dragging away who they want, when they want.
[3:13:16.720 --> 3:13:23.040]  Yeah, it's pretty, pretty disturbing. I can't believe they contacted me.
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:26.400]  I don't want to be traced or anything. So
[3:13:27.360 --> 3:13:30.640]  Hey, brother, I love you and I appreciate your call. I'm going to get one more in here and I'm
[3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:35.360]  sorry to I got time for Catherine. I got time for Daniel. I got time for Liberty dog.
[3:13:35.360 --> 3:13:40.000]  Whoever I don't get to, we'll call you back tomorrow to the answer. Let's go to Daniel's
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:44.960]  been home along. Let's go ahead Daniel in Texas. Hey, Alex, I just wanted to let you know I was
[3:13:44.960 --> 3:13:51.760]  in a Sam's club about a month ago now. And there was a robot, an autonomous robot scrubbing the
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:57.440]  floor. Oh, yeah. And I said to one of the workers there, I said, Hey, that's going to take your job
[3:13:57.440 --> 3:14:02.400]  because I know, huh? And then when I was leaving, and then, you know, there's a little checkout
[3:14:02.400 --> 3:14:08.080]  people that check your receipt. I said, Hey, are you guys unionized? And he said, Oh, well,
[3:14:08.080 --> 3:14:11.760]  you need to do something about these robots. They're going to take your job. I'll find another job,
[3:14:11.760 --> 3:14:18.240]  bro. And I go, Okay, yeah, none of them, none of them have any life force or survival instinct.
[3:14:19.040 --> 3:14:23.440]  Right. And the other thing is I have some pollen blocks today. I've been, I never had
[3:14:23.440 --> 3:14:26.560]  ever suffered from allergies. I'm going to give that a try. And I've heard a lot of good things
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:30.640]  about it. And the last thing is I've been listening to you since you were on the cover of Texas
[3:14:30.640 --> 3:14:37.120]  Monthly was that 2008. And now suddenly the last 18 months, I don't seem so crazy to a lot of people.
[3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:40.640]  Well, God bless your brother. And I love you. And I appreciate you holding to say that. All
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:44.080]  right, Catherine and Liberty dog, I'll call you back tomorrow. I didn't want to take any more time
[3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:49.520]  from Jay Dyer. He is really does his research on the Great Reset and the globalist population
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:54.800]  operations he takes over right now. But like the caller said earlier, think of how big it is
[3:14:55.440 --> 3:15:00.640]  that Japan is withdrawn the entire Moderna deal, because it's all got liquid nano metal in it.

[3:19:55.760 --> 3:20:00.480]  Alex Jones show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis. And today I want to cover the
[3:20:00.480 --> 3:20:06.080]  totality of the lockstep document. We've heard it mentioned many, many, many times, at least probably
[3:20:06.080 --> 3:20:11.840]  a hundred times or more in the last year because of its predictive accuracy and power. We've covered
[3:20:11.840 --> 3:20:18.160]  the SPARS document extensively. But I want to take you through each section of the lockstep
[3:20:18.160 --> 3:20:23.200]  document, which actually, if you want to know, is called scenarios for the future of technology
[3:20:23.200 --> 3:20:28.880]  international development. So it's not actually called lockstep. What lockstep is is one of the four
[3:20:28.880 --> 3:20:37.920]  future potential scenarios that they see likely playing out. So this was a 2010 Rockefeller
[3:20:37.920 --> 3:20:42.480]  Foundation document about a plan. It's a planning exercise. And if you don't know what that is,
[3:20:42.480 --> 3:20:47.520]  that's basically in the corporate world or in military. They do these kind of actuaries or
[3:20:47.520 --> 3:20:54.240]  they do war games. They do future potential scenarios to give their stakeholders and the
[3:20:54.240 --> 3:20:58.880]  people invested in their, say, corporation or in their philanthropy in this case. So called
[3:20:59.680 --> 3:21:05.840]  a way to plan for these different scenarios. Now, another mistake that we don't need to make is to
[3:21:05.840 --> 3:21:10.880]  think that lockstep is just simply the one that they chose, right? Oh, there's no others. It's
[3:21:10.880 --> 3:21:17.520]  just that they chose lockstep amongst the four there. Actually, there's elements in each of
[3:21:17.520 --> 3:21:23.440]  these scenarios that can be also integrated into the phase that we're living in now or perhaps in
[3:21:23.440 --> 3:21:29.040]  the future they might use smart scramble or they might use hack attack if in fact these are war
[3:21:29.040 --> 3:21:34.720]  game scenarios. And I think that they are. So even though they're called planning exercises or
[3:21:34.720 --> 3:21:40.640]  fictional future scenarios, we know that that's precisely what the purpose of a war game is,
[3:21:40.640 --> 3:21:46.240]  of a planning exercise is to have a prepared response for those scenarios. And in fact,
[3:21:46.240 --> 3:21:52.160]  if you can control the scenarios, how much better will your response be? And so they even say that
[3:21:52.160 --> 3:21:58.160]  our goal here is to help out philanthropic stakeholders. What has Klaus been talking about
[3:21:58.160 --> 3:22:04.560]  so much lately? Klaus Schwab, of course, he talks about stakeholder capitalism and that really is
[3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:09.440]  moving away from the idea of the individual and rather that everyone has a duty to everyone else,
[3:22:09.440 --> 3:22:14.480]  you see. Oh, you're not just a stakeholder in some company or some bank or whatever. No,
[3:22:14.480 --> 3:22:18.640]  see now because you're connected to everyone else, you have a duty to everyone else. So it's
[3:22:18.640 --> 3:22:25.840]  another way to basically engineer this system into a kind of collectivism. And so the document
[3:22:25.840 --> 3:22:32.800]  begins by saying not only are we pro-poor here, we're going to make the world better by helping
[3:22:32.800 --> 3:22:37.920]  the poor. And I guess it doesn't make sense because one way to help the poor is to get rid of poor
[3:22:37.920 --> 3:22:42.080]  people and to get rid of people. I mean, there won't be any suffering if there's no people,
[3:22:42.720 --> 3:22:46.080]  right? I mean, that's literally the argumentation that they're kind of presenting here is that
[3:22:46.080 --> 3:22:51.520]  we're going to fix poverty by removing the people. Then there won't be poor people, you see.
[3:22:52.720 --> 3:22:58.720]  And so they go through the introduction talking about how this is really geared towards
[3:22:58.720 --> 3:23:02.880]  world government. In fact, there's a recommendation of several books that they tell you to read at
[3:23:02.880 --> 3:23:08.880]  the beginning to help further illuminate this document. And one of those is from the World Bank,
[3:23:08.880 --> 3:23:12.560]  one of those is from the Rand Corporation, and one of them is called the New Invisible College,
[3:23:12.560 --> 3:23:18.800]  which is odd because this brings to mind the Royal Society, the original Invisible College,
[3:23:18.800 --> 3:23:24.400]  where we get modern scientism. The first thing they outline in the document before they get
[3:23:24.400 --> 3:23:29.360]  into the first scenario, which is lockstep, is that the Rockefeller Foundation and the Global
[3:23:29.360 --> 3:23:36.480]  Business Network want to number one combat population growth. Overpopulation, okay,
[3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:40.800]  right there on page 13. We're overpopulated. That's the number one problem. And as we've seen,
[3:23:40.800 --> 3:23:45.680]  as you guys know, this is, I think, about the 50th global elite document that I worked through,
[3:23:45.680 --> 3:23:51.360]  including many other books and texts. And that's always present. There's always crisis,
[3:23:51.360 --> 3:23:58.240]  there's always evolution, there's always destructive shocks, and how to solve those problems.
[3:23:58.240 --> 3:24:04.080]  In many cases, the elite themselves promote the scenarios that lead to the problems, right?
[3:24:04.080 --> 3:24:10.560]  Problem reaction solution. So that's necessary for managing the world in terms of managed
[3:24:10.560 --> 3:24:16.240]  and controlled crises. So the document begins by talking about disruptive shocks. What kind of
[3:24:16.240 --> 3:24:24.320]  things can occur to be disruptive shocks to the existing system? And really, it's lockstep,
[3:24:24.320 --> 3:24:28.080]  the first scenario, that's going to have the most important disruptive shock
[3:24:29.440 --> 3:24:37.520]  that we're all really familiar with now, our best friend, Mr. Kofit 19, the last year plus
[3:24:37.520 --> 3:24:41.760]  of what we dealt with. So let's get into lockstep, the first and most important of these scenarios.
[3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:46.640]  But let's remember that the other scenarios are not mutually exclusive. There's elements that can
[3:24:46.640 --> 3:24:51.680]  be used in these other scenarios. And as we'll see, some of what's mentioned, including things like
[3:24:51.680 --> 3:24:57.440]  potentially cyber polygon or the recent ransomware attacks, they're actually mentioned in
[3:24:58.560 --> 3:25:04.800]  the hack attack scenario. And so the first descriptor that they give of what the lockstep
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:13.360]  scenario is, is a top down, tight control by governments everywhere. So this is the key feature.
[3:25:14.720 --> 3:25:23.200]  Lockstep will give an outline for 2010 to 2025 and then 2025 to 2030. Agenda 2030,
[3:25:23.200 --> 3:25:27.600]  if it's in perfectly with many other white paper documents that we've seen, especially the plans
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:33.840]  like agenda 2030. So you're going to notice that what you hear here is no different than the Club
[3:25:33.840 --> 3:25:40.720]  of Rome's document, the first global revolution, right? Limits to growth. Those are key documents
[3:25:40.720 --> 3:25:47.040]  that dealt with how to move away from a growth based system to an expansionary system to an
[3:25:47.040 --> 3:25:52.080]  austerity system. And they say in that document that the excuse that will come up with literally
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:57.520]  is the excuse we will use is pollution over population. They're talking about humans being
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:04.080]  the pollutants, not trash. Humans are the trash. The trash of the planet is what the document's
[3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:11.200]  saying. So they're saying we're going to literally have to bring this in at least by 2030. If things
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:16.720]  don't get on point, we may have to see some disruptive shocks. Now they don't say, oh,
[3:26:16.720 --> 3:26:22.080]  we're going to leak this from Wuhan. We are going to then introduce the global biometric ID. Now,
[3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:26.960]  they don't say it that way. There's plausible deniability in that this is just simply a war game.
[3:26:26.960 --> 3:26:33.200]  Yes, exactly. Extinction Rebellion placed into this perfectly. But what is amazing about lockstep
[3:26:33.200 --> 3:26:41.200]  and what really raises eyebrows is on the very first page, we see a bio leak out of China.
[3:26:41.920 --> 3:26:47.200]  Why isn't that interesting? How do they know that a bio leak would come out of China? And
[3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:52.720]  not only that, it says this pandemic that will set off the domino scenario of lockstep
[3:26:52.720 --> 3:26:59.120]  will first of all disrupt supply chains. Wow, amazing. So in other words, they knew that there
[3:26:59.120 --> 3:27:04.160]  would be these disruptive shocks as the document calls it to supply chains. It says then as a
[3:27:04.160 --> 3:27:11.440]  result, flights will be shut down. China is key to this scenario. And the most amazing thing
[3:27:11.440 --> 3:27:15.840]  in all of this document, I think, is the next page. Okay, so if we come over to the very next
[3:27:15.840 --> 3:27:23.360]  page, we see that there's a mandated global face mask. There are mandated temperature checks
[3:27:23.360 --> 3:27:28.080]  everywhere. And all this does is hype up the hypochondria and everybody getting scared, right?
[3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:33.760]  Freaking out. This is the whole of 2020. There's mandates, pandemic mandates.
[3:27:35.040 --> 3:27:45.200]  And the crazy, crazy, crazy part is this. As a result of this, biometric IDs will be necessary
[3:27:45.200 --> 3:27:57.440]  for all. So out of the controlled chaos of lockstep, the mandated global IDs, what did we just see?
[3:27:57.440 --> 3:28:05.200]  August 27th, right? The World Health Organization moving towards digital documentation of COVID-19
[3:28:05.200 --> 3:28:11.200]  set vaccine certificates or nothing new. They try to give us pause. Well, we've done this kind of
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:18.160]  thing before. And here it is. Literally, what's written in this 2010 document, global biometric
[3:28:18.160 --> 3:28:25.200]  IDs tracking your health status, medical tyranny, literally three or four days ago, what, the 27th?
[3:28:25.200 --> 3:28:30.960]  Same, this very thing. And they even say, don't make it a vaccine status. You know, listeners
[3:28:30.960 --> 3:28:37.200]  call into the cell when they thank me. And it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg
[3:28:37.200 --> 3:28:43.200]  you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth. And we're all
[3:28:43.200 --> 3:28:48.000]  this together. And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:51.920]  buy them or we won't be here on air. But it's true for the only media organization in the United
[3:28:51.920 --> 3:28:56.640]  States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:28:56.640 --> 3:29:00.480]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups.
[3:29:00.480 --> 3:29:04.640]  And we're still here. And as this whole new world order comes out and we open,
[3:29:04.640 --> 3:29:08.640]  our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's why America
[3:29:08.640 --> 3:29:12.720]  has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations enslaved. And America is still
[3:29:12.720 --> 3:29:17.920]  quasi free. You can't have info wars has been proven right, be on air with all the craziness
[3:29:17.920 --> 3:29:22.480]  that's about to unfold. Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all
[3:29:22.480 --> 3:29:27.360]  and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more.
[3:29:27.360 --> 3:29:29.440]  They're wonderful products and they support the info we're thanking.
[3:29:29.440 --> 3:29:36.000]  Thank you. I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:41.680]  to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before
[3:29:41.680 --> 3:29:46.880]  they went operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught
[3:29:46.880 --> 3:29:52.720]  flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[3:29:52.720 --> 3:29:57.600]  great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[3:29:57.600 --> 3:30:01.760]  tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[3:30:01.760 --> 3:30:06.080]  the truth. So we've got an information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda. We've
[3:30:06.080 --> 3:30:09.840]  also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality

[3:31:30.760 --> 3:31:35.160]  Just a week ago we got a new shipment of vitamin mineral fusion back in stock.
[3:31:35.160 --> 3:31:38.200]  and it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[3:31:38.200 --> 3:31:39.720]  But because we won't cut corners
[3:31:39.720 --> 3:31:41.720]  on the quality of what goes into it,
[3:31:41.720 --> 3:31:43.560]  the factory can only get limited supplies,
[3:31:43.560 --> 3:31:45.720]  so again, it was half the order we wanted.
[3:31:45.720 --> 3:31:49.120]  But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off,
[3:31:49.120 --> 3:31:51.120]  so everybody on the fence will get it.

[3:32:30.440 --> 3:32:33.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:32:41.440 --> 3:32:44.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:32:44.440 --> 3:32:47.440]  I'm your guest host, J. Dyer, Jason Alstass.
[3:32:47.440 --> 3:32:48.440]  If you want to support my work,
[3:32:48.440 --> 3:32:51.440]  you can subscribe to my website to get part two
[3:32:51.440 --> 3:32:54.440]  access of all of the best hair and beard products.
[3:32:54.440 --> 3:33:00.440]  And also, if you want to support my work, you can subscribe to my website to get part two access
[3:33:00.440 --> 3:33:03.440]  of all the archives of the last several years of interviews,
[3:33:03.440 --> 3:33:05.440]  last several years of lectures on documents,
[3:33:05.440 --> 3:33:07.440]  just like what we're seeing today with lockstep.
[3:33:07.440 --> 3:33:10.440]  Now what I was saying at the end of that break was,
[3:33:10.440 --> 3:33:12.440]  the digital certificate, it says,
[3:33:12.440 --> 3:33:17.440]  should never be required in regard to a smartphone or a computer.
[3:33:17.440 --> 3:33:20.440]  In other words, don't make people have to have a phone or a computer
[3:33:20.440 --> 3:33:23.440]  to have this World ID health card,
[3:33:23.440 --> 3:33:28.440]  because that would exclude a large portion of the planet still who don't have phones, right?
[3:33:28.440 --> 3:33:31.440]  So in other words, it needs to be integrated in multiple ways.
[3:33:31.440 --> 3:33:36.440]  Perhaps the Gil Bates Foundation's Gavi Tattoo, right?
[3:33:36.440 --> 3:33:41.440]  Perhaps Nanotech, perhaps the recent news from DARPA that we can,
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:46.440]  you know, put Nanotech into the blood and the Nanotech can tell you your health status
[3:33:46.440 --> 3:33:48.440]  and what diseases you have, right?
[3:33:48.440 --> 3:33:51.440]  I'm sure everybody saw that recent news story.
[3:33:51.440 --> 3:33:56.440]  So the World Health Organization's stipulations wanted to be open
[3:33:56.440 --> 3:34:01.440]  to the possibility of integrating any of these things in ways to track
[3:34:01.440 --> 3:34:04.440]  and control everyone through their health ID.
[3:34:04.440 --> 3:34:06.440]  So make no mistake about it, it's not just about the Cofid,
[3:34:06.440 --> 3:34:10.440]  it's also about the global ID, you see.
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:14.440]  And in bits, yes, this is Bill Gates, this is Rockefeller.
[3:34:14.440 --> 3:34:17.440]  And remember, what did we see last year on the Gavi website?
[3:34:17.440 --> 3:34:21.440]  It will be linked probably to a tattoo, okay?
[3:34:21.440 --> 3:34:25.440]  So there's a lot of different ways that this biometric ID mentioned
[3:34:25.440 --> 3:34:29.440]  in the 2010 lockup document could play out.
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:35.440]  Now, another interesting element that is on this very page here, page 19,
[3:34:35.440 --> 3:34:39.440]  is that they recognize that when these mandates are put in place,
[3:34:39.440 --> 3:34:44.440]  governments will not ease up, they will keep those controls that they have.
[3:34:44.440 --> 3:34:49.440]  So the elite know that when you give over this power to the government,
[3:34:49.440 --> 3:34:53.440]  to the state, to the private corporate state, they don't let you have it back.
[3:34:53.440 --> 3:34:55.440]  Oh, we promised, right?
[3:34:55.440 --> 3:34:57.440]  Two weeks to flatten the curve, remember this?
[3:34:57.440 --> 3:34:59.440]  Oh, they're going to give it back.
[3:34:59.440 --> 3:35:02.440]  If we just keep, if we, the 50th vaccine that we get,
[3:35:02.440 --> 3:35:05.440]  they're going to give us one hour outside, right?
[3:35:05.440 --> 3:35:07.440]  That's what they're doing now in Australia.
[3:35:07.440 --> 3:35:10.440]  They're saying, if you get your monthly stabby,
[3:35:10.440 --> 3:35:13.440]  we'll let you have an hour outside, like kids on the playground, right?
[3:35:13.440 --> 3:35:17.440]  We're rewarded like a kid on a playground to get a, what, an hour outside.
[3:35:17.440 --> 3:35:19.440]  I mean, this is madness. This is crazy.
[3:35:19.440 --> 3:35:23.440]  And when you talked about this a year ago, as most of us in this sphere of things,
[3:35:23.440 --> 3:35:25.440]  this audience did, everybody, oh, that's crazy.
[3:35:25.440 --> 3:35:27.440]  They'll never do that. They'll never do that.
[3:35:27.440 --> 3:35:30.440]  They wrote a whole white paper saying they're going to do it.
[3:35:30.440 --> 3:35:33.440]  What do you mean they never do it? They're doing it right now.
[3:35:33.440 --> 3:35:35.440]  And so people have just given up.
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:39.440]  They've given it, they've gone into an apathetic, catatonic state of fear.
[3:35:39.440 --> 3:35:42.440]  And a lot of times that's what fear does, right?
[3:35:42.440 --> 3:35:45.440]  It's almost like a PTSD thing where it puts you in a catatonic state.
[3:35:45.440 --> 3:35:47.440]  So people have just given up, oh, okay, whatever.
[3:35:47.440 --> 3:35:51.440]  I'm going to, I'm going to do the monthly vaccines that Bill Gates tells me to, right?
[3:35:51.440 --> 3:35:56.440]  And he, we said last year, we have to go to top channel year.
[3:35:56.440 --> 3:35:57.440]  We have to go to every month.
[3:35:57.440 --> 3:36:01.440]  We're going to have to have a new vaccine about every month to get the numbers down,
[3:36:01.440 --> 3:36:02.440]  get those numbers down.
[3:36:02.440 --> 3:36:05.440]  The numbers getting down are not the sick.
[3:36:05.440 --> 3:36:07.440]  It's not the dead. It's you.
[3:36:07.440 --> 3:36:08.440]  You're the numbers.
[3:36:08.440 --> 3:36:12.440]  We have to get one of these numbers to bow down to zero.
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:14.440]  I wonder what he's talking about, right?
[3:36:14.440 --> 3:36:20.440]  So amazingly, not, and this is an element that I've never heard anybody talk about,
[3:36:20.440 --> 3:36:29.440]  which is that in lockstep, it actually says they know that when the government has these
[3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:34.440]  strict top down controls in place, that everybody's going to be really mad about it.
[3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:41.440]  And they know that everyone will clamor to get rid of their public corrupt officials.
[3:36:41.440 --> 3:36:43.440]  That brings to mind what's in spars.
[3:36:43.440 --> 3:36:48.440]  Remember the spars document says something exactly, you know, almost exactly the same as that,
[3:36:48.440 --> 3:36:53.440]  that the public health officials will take the fall, right?
[3:36:53.440 --> 3:36:56.440]  And that one, it's the CDC heads and people like that.
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:37:00.440]  In this document, it's the corrupt government leaders who don't want to let go of their,
[3:37:00.440 --> 3:37:07.440]  you know, 1984 technocratic control, the people will rebel and the document actually says
[3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:14.440]  that's a good thing because when the people are furious at their governments and they clamor
[3:37:14.440 --> 3:37:18.440]  for a new savior, we will provide the solution.
[3:37:18.440 --> 3:37:21.440]  That's why Klaus was saying, Reese, we know you're angry.
[3:37:21.440 --> 3:37:23.440]  We know you want to be free.
[3:37:23.440 --> 3:37:25.440]  We will have the saviors for you.
[3:37:25.440 --> 3:37:28.440]  We will provide the salvation for you.
[3:37:28.440 --> 3:37:29.440]  We know you're angry.
[3:37:29.440 --> 3:37:31.440]  That's what we wanted to do.
[3:37:31.440 --> 3:37:33.440]  We wanted to provoke you.
[3:37:33.440 --> 3:37:37.440]  And when you're provoked and you clamor against our national governments,
[3:37:37.440 --> 3:37:40.440]  we will provide the global solutions.
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:42.440]  Literally, it's right here.
[3:37:42.440 --> 3:37:46.440]  This almost reads like Klaus wrote this.
[3:37:46.440 --> 3:37:52.440]  I mean, I don't, he didn't write it, but I'm saying it's literally like you're reading what Klaus says, right?
[3:37:52.440 --> 3:37:57.440]  It's amazing the degree to which these things harmonize.
[3:37:57.440 --> 3:37:59.440]  And it's almost like Cobra Commander, right?
[3:37:59.440 --> 3:38:03.440]  I mean, when I hear Klaus talking, it's literally like Cobra Commander level plans.
[3:38:03.440 --> 3:38:06.440]  We live in a GI Joe episode, right?
[3:38:06.440 --> 3:38:11.440]  Except the good guys are actually, you know, what we think are the good guys, right?
[3:38:11.440 --> 3:38:13.440]  They basically work for Cobra, right?
[3:38:13.440 --> 3:38:16.440]  Just like James Bond, you think he's the good guy.
[3:38:16.440 --> 3:38:18.440]  Actually, MI6 runs Spectre, right?
[3:38:18.440 --> 3:38:20.440]  That's the real world, right?
[3:38:20.440 --> 3:38:28.440]  And so in reality, you know, GI Joe, right, if Joe Biden, GI Joe Biden is actually run by Cobra.
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:31.440]  He's run by Klaus and these these figures, right?
[3:38:31.440 --> 3:38:39.440]  I'm being silly here, but they mentioned that as a result of the anger at the top-down control,
[3:38:39.440 --> 3:38:44.440]  people will move towards nationalist movements and they will clamor for a solution
[3:38:44.440 --> 3:38:47.440]  and the global elite will provide the global governance solution.
[3:38:47.440 --> 3:38:52.440]  In fact, they even said that there will be, there will be the terrorist movements amongst the national,
[3:38:52.440 --> 3:38:55.440]  we will say is that everyone is a nationalist, is a terrorist.
[3:38:55.440 --> 3:38:56.440]  That's precisely what we see now.
[3:38:56.440 --> 3:39:01.440]  Oh, if you want, if your pro-nation state, if your pro-local government, oh, you're a terrorist, you're a terrorist,
[3:39:01.440 --> 3:39:04.440]  you don't follow the UN, you're a terrorist.
[3:39:04.440 --> 3:39:13.440]  And then they even propose a scenario where when the world was locked down, people noticed less climate emissions.
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:15.440]  It even hints at climate lockdowns.
[3:39:15.440 --> 3:39:18.440]  It doesn't say climate lockdowns, but it hints at that because they say,
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:25.440]  India realized that as a result of lockdowns and no cars traveling, that there were no CO2 emissions, blah, blah, blah.
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:28.440]  So they banned cars.
[3:39:28.440 --> 3:39:35.440]  So the great reset is piggybacking on the pandemic.
[3:39:35.440 --> 3:39:38.440]  Oh, yeah, he wrote a whole book on that.
[3:39:38.440 --> 3:39:53.440]  When we see the pandemic providing a break for the mother nature, then we can bring in this justification of austerity and climate lockdown.
[3:39:53.440 --> 3:40:04.440]  So get ready because it's going to transition out of COOFID stuff, probably, and it'll transition into global health, bio health, mother nature health.
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:07.440]  Oh, see, we gave mother nature a rest.
[3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:14.440]  And if we really want to give her a rest, then we need to get rid of all of the people on her back who are going to make her tip over, right?
[3:40:14.440 --> 3:40:18.440]  Like the Greeks just to say, too many humans on the back of Gaia, right?
[3:40:18.440 --> 3:40:20.440]  We're going to make her tip over something, right?
[3:40:20.440 --> 3:40:30.440]  And so lockstep ends by saying that potentially you could have a collapse of governments in the national since by 2025, 2026.
[3:40:30.440 --> 3:40:34.440]  And again, as a result, we can roll in as this equals.
[3:40:34.440 --> 3:40:51.440]  Next, I want to move to the technology because this is an interesting element, too, that a lot of people don't bring up in the lockstep section is that we know that there's social distancing and all this stuff that was kind of a sigh up to get us all atomized and to separate us from loved ones and all that.
[3:40:51.440 --> 3:40:59.440]  But what lockstep hints at in their headlines section is that this will allow for the rollout of the bots.
[3:40:59.440 --> 3:41:03.440]  Ah, you see, social distancing was about the bots.
[3:41:03.440 --> 3:41:10.440]  Yes, it had a deleterious effect on our psychology as humans needing human to human contact.
[3:41:10.440 --> 3:41:16.440]  But the real solution was the AI bots.
[3:41:16.440 --> 3:41:31.440]  Yeah, so if you look, there's this Italy right rolls out bots, they combat the immigrant scenarios with immigrant caregivers using robots.
[3:41:31.440 --> 3:41:34.440]  So if you guys saw it by the other day, Jason Burma shout out to Jason Burma.
[3:41:34.440 --> 3:41:48.440]  The other day did a whole video on this very thing about how they're rolling out AI bots as caregivers in hospices in hospitals for elderly that are dying because oh, you can't touch your loved ones.
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:50.440]  You might contract the coup.
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:42:02.440]  Johnny five will be your your minister at death right so confess your sins to Father Johnny five and I hope you've been good because you know, that's all you get.
[3:42:02.440 --> 3:42:08.440]  You're going to have to confess to your bitch bot who will make you his bitch.
[3:42:08.440 --> 3:42:09.440]  This is J. Darv J's analysis.
[3:42:09.440 --> 3:42:10.440]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:42:10.440 --> 3:42:12.440]  We'll cover the last two sections.
[3:42:12.440 --> 3:42:13.440]  There you go.
[3:42:13.440 --> 3:42:17.440]  Yeah, of the last couple sections in lockstep.
[3:42:17.440 --> 3:42:20.440]  When we get back, don't go anywhere.
[3:42:20.440 --> 3:42:28.440]  This is the Alex Jones show and be sure and support Alex and all those in all media in the info war store.
[3:42:28.440 --> 3:42:32.440]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid April 2021.
[3:42:32.440 --> 3:42:38.440]  And I just want to say something I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[3:42:38.440 --> 3:42:43.440]  It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you the listeners of the show.
[3:42:43.440 --> 3:42:49.440]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you, whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[3:42:49.440 --> 3:42:56.440]  You got red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[3:42:56.440 --> 3:43:02.440]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years and it's crazier things are.
[3:43:02.440 --> 3:43:04.440]  I want to keep working into the future.
[3:43:04.440 --> 3:43:07.440]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:43:07.440 --> 3:43:13.440]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:43:13.440 --> 3:43:15.440]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[3:43:15.440 --> 3:43:19.440]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[3:43:19.440 --> 3:43:23.440]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[3:43:23.440 --> 3:43:38.440]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support us. God bless.
[3:43:53.440 --> 3:44:03.440]  So we've got a information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[3:44:03.440 --> 3:44:05.440]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:44:05.440 --> 3:44:08.440]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[3:44:08.440 --> 3:44:12.440]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infoarstore.com.
[3:44:12.440 --> 3:44:18.440]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[3:44:18.440 --> 3:44:23.440]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[3:44:23.440 --> 3:44:51.440]  Believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infoarstore.com.
[3:44:51.440 --> 3:44:58.440]  So no one is addressing the fact that this is a 21st century corporate economic war on the general population
[3:44:58.440 --> 3:45:04.440]  and the conversion of the planet into a high tech technocracy with a global ID, global medical system,
[3:45:04.440 --> 3:45:12.440]  global medical control ID, and of course a carbon taxes that tied to that, the tractor every movement.
[3:45:12.440 --> 3:45:16.440]  This is their takeover. They admitted it. They've said it.
[3:45:16.440 --> 3:45:21.440]  But no, the Prime Minister of Canada is on TV yesterday saying this is an environmental takeover plan
[3:45:21.440 --> 3:45:25.440]  and the whole lockdowns have just taught you to prepare for climate lockdowns.
[3:45:25.440 --> 3:45:50.440]  So they're announcing their takeover. We've got a resistance to say no.
[3:45:50.440 --> 3:46:19.440]  We've got a resistance to say no.
[3:46:19.440 --> 3:46:29.440]  We've got a resistance to say no.
[3:46:29.440 --> 3:46:39.440]  We've got a resistance to say no.
[3:46:39.440 --> 3:46:49.440]  We've got a resistance to say no.
[3:46:49.440 --> 3:46:53.440]  Welcome back to the Outstanding Show in this final segment.
[3:46:53.440 --> 3:46:56.440]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:46:56.440 --> 3:47:00.440]  We probably won't get through the whole document, but we'll get through most of the important sections.
[3:47:00.440 --> 3:47:06.440]  If you want the full breakdown, you can go over to my YouTube channel or to my website where I'll be doing a full analysis
[3:47:06.440 --> 3:47:13.440]  in the next couple of days of this document. We did the first half on my YouTube channel, but the tech control section.
[3:47:13.440 --> 3:47:22.440]  So as we move through lockstep, we have the notion of the main thing that will come into play through the lockstep scenario
[3:47:22.440 --> 3:47:26.440]  will be the total tech control and surveillance of all areas of life.
[3:47:26.440 --> 3:47:38.440]  That will include the antisocial behavior policing at public venues, at airports, the control of all goods through pandemic scares,
[3:47:38.440 --> 3:47:42.440]  which lead to a reorientation of the logistics of all supply chains.
[3:47:42.440 --> 3:47:47.440]  So they even talked about all the disruptive shocks and the change to supply chains.
[3:47:47.440 --> 3:47:53.440]  And they don't say this, but I mean, this could suggest, oh, you're only going to get your food now from Amazon and Walmart.
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:57.440]  I mean, it doesn't say what, but it says it's limiting now where you get your goods.
[3:47:57.440 --> 3:48:01.440]  And this will be controlled via basically DARPA chips and this kind of stuff.
[3:48:01.440 --> 3:48:07.440]  And then it even predicted the rise of teleconferencing, Zoom, Skype type things are all business now.
[3:48:07.440 --> 3:48:10.440]  Business meetings are going to are conducted via Zoom and Skype.
[3:48:10.440 --> 3:48:12.440]  We saw that happen last year.
[3:48:12.440 --> 3:48:18.440]  And then lastly, they consider the possibility of a fractured internet, which they don't go into a lot of detail about.
[3:48:18.440 --> 3:48:25.440]  However, the later scenario of the hacking as if global cyber polygon hacking becomes a major problem.
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:33.440]  That is about a future where everybody's now so online that our lives are disrupted via backdoor hacking.
[3:48:33.440 --> 3:48:41.440]  Now, they don't say backdoor hacking, but I'm sorry, I happen to think that if you know about, you know, the history of the promise software and this kind of stuff,
[3:48:41.440 --> 3:48:55.440]  the NSA building backdoors into the chips for decades, then most likely that's what's going to be going on is that, you know, we know who the number one culprit is when we see the key infrastructure, so-called hacked, right?
[3:48:55.440 --> 3:49:10.440]  And it says at the end of lockstep, the main achievement here will be that a mass global pandemic will allow for a global reorganization of society, reset of society.
[3:49:10.440 --> 3:49:16.440]  Exactly. Reorganization of all areas of life and all society.
[3:49:16.440 --> 3:49:26.440]  Now, the next scenario, which they call clever together, which is really a laughable kind of social justice dominant world scenario.
[3:49:26.440 --> 3:49:29.440]  It's really fake and grave, you know what I mean.
[3:49:29.440 --> 3:49:37.440]  But all the companies here have not just the CEO, every corporation in this scenario has a carbon officer.
[3:49:37.440 --> 3:49:47.440]  So there's the CEO, and then right next to him is the carbon officer who controls and limits every company's green, you know, violations basically.
[3:49:47.440 --> 3:49:57.440]  And in order to have this, the whole society will require a total surveillance, total information awareness network, and it will all be linked via the UN.
[3:49:57.440 --> 3:50:07.440]  It says the bottom is talking. So the nightmare here, they say, is that in this future scenario, giant pharmaceutical companies will play a key role.
[3:50:07.440 --> 3:50:13.440]  They will be focused on implementing effective vaccination strategies for the whole world.
[3:50:13.440 --> 3:50:25.440]  And basically it will be an NWO run by NGO, non-governmental organization, New World Order, literally an NGO of NWO.
[3:50:25.440 --> 3:50:29.440]  It will be a world focused on the green agenda and the green gospel.
[3:50:29.440 --> 3:50:32.440]  There will be total carbon controls and limits.
[3:50:32.440 --> 3:50:41.440]  The privatized corporate government will be the real government, and they will bypass the older ideas of a democratic elected structure.
[3:50:41.440 --> 3:50:49.440]  So we've heard right, Klaus famously in that quote that's on his Wikipedia page, we will subvert the democracies and take over.
[3:50:49.440 --> 3:51:01.440]  That's literally what this section is talking about, a private, corporate, unelected global government that will bypass anything to do with you or your industry decisions.
[3:51:01.440 --> 3:51:04.440]  And it will all be run through non-governmental organizations.
[3:51:04.440 --> 3:51:07.440]  That's the role of philanthropy.
[3:51:07.440 --> 3:51:11.440]  The role of philanthropy is really just a cloak for global government.
[3:51:11.440 --> 3:51:18.440]  That's it. That's all it is. It's the wealthiest people on the planet creating socialist smart cities.
[3:51:18.440 --> 3:51:24.440]  That's my note on this page. What is the green carbon agenda scenario like?
[3:51:24.440 --> 3:51:29.440]  Oh, it's going to be great. You're all going to live in a giant pod smart city.
[3:51:29.440 --> 3:51:32.440]  Yes, your services will be rationed.
[3:51:32.440 --> 3:51:35.440]  So if you're bad, you don't get water and food.
[3:51:35.440 --> 3:51:37.440]  By the way, the food that you get is fake meat.
[3:51:37.440 --> 3:51:39.440]  I forgot to mention that.
[3:51:39.440 --> 3:51:52.440]  So the food here is literally that they've invented a fake meat, which Gil Bates and, you know, Richard Branson, all these people working towards Cargill, Tyson, making fake meat.
[3:51:52.440 --> 3:51:58.440]  It will be rationed. Remember the planopolis videos that Alex has played for the last 15 years, right?
[3:51:58.440 --> 3:52:05.440]  Planopolis literally telling you that in the smart city, because everything in your life is tracked and traced, your energy is controlled.
[3:52:05.440 --> 3:52:13.440]  Remember that control of energy is not just about gasoline or nuclear energy or electricity.
[3:52:13.440 --> 3:52:18.440]  Control of energy is all energy, all biological life.
[3:52:18.440 --> 3:52:26.440]  And that's why Klaus is saying that when we take over, we're going to take over biology.
[3:52:26.440 --> 3:52:34.440]  We will get in your body. It will be a synthetic rewrite of all of reality, including your biology to control your energy.
[3:52:34.440 --> 3:52:41.440]  And yes, the smart cities are socialist, AI smart cities.
[3:52:41.440 --> 3:52:48.440]  And then they give these goofy scenarios of, you know, oh, what's a fictional scenario of a scientist, right?
[3:52:48.440 --> 3:52:54.440]  Who lives in Africa, a scientist in Africa, invents, you know, fake meat and it goes global.
[3:52:54.440 --> 3:52:59.440]  By 2023, all meat is fake meat. Nobody eats cows anymore, right?
[3:52:59.440 --> 3:53:09.440]  You eat beef jerky, you just eat fake meat, and then they invent a fake fuel, which supplants fossil fuels, which, by the way, I don't think oil is ground up dinosaurs.
[3:53:09.440 --> 3:53:15.440]  Oil is not dinosaur juice. It's kind of ridiculous, right? I don't know what oil is, but I don't think it's dinosaur juice.
[3:53:15.440 --> 3:53:19.440]  Then that goes on. Briefly, I'll touch on the hacker scenario.
[3:53:19.440 --> 3:53:22.440]  That's okay. Well, what about a world where hackers run everything?
[3:53:22.440 --> 3:53:28.440]  Now we're starting to sound like maybe the scenario that they've been using more recently, right?
[3:53:28.440 --> 3:53:40.440]  The cyber polygon ransomware hacking scenario where, like 9-11, we see a world in which there's an economic collapse and then isn't this interesting?
[3:53:40.440 --> 3:53:44.440]  The U.S. pulling out of Afghanistan. I thought that was odd that they threw that one in there.
[3:53:44.440 --> 3:53:47.440]  The U.S. pulls out of Afghanistan. Isn't that interesting?
[3:53:47.440 --> 3:53:52.440]  And then what happens? Oh, the teleman convector. This is 2010, remember?
[3:53:52.440 --> 3:54:00.440]  So, realize then, the scenarios are not mutually exclusive. They can have different types of cards that they play, right?
[3:54:00.440 --> 3:54:07.440]  It makes me think of the Illuminati card deck, and I'm only being tongue-in-cheek, not totally serious here, but it kind of is like that, right?
[3:54:07.440 --> 3:54:13.440]  I mean, couldn't you see, you know, Klaus and, I don't know, Gil Bates playing cards?
[3:54:13.440 --> 3:54:17.440]  It's like they're playing cards and they've got the Illuminati card.
[3:54:17.440 --> 3:54:23.440]  They're like, oh, yes, I would have played the Necronomicon card, right?
[3:54:23.440 --> 3:54:28.440]  So then he promotes occultism or something like that. I'm being silly, but you get the idea, right?
[3:54:28.440 --> 3:54:32.440]  Which is, you know, about the Illuminati card deck, right?
[3:54:32.440 --> 3:54:36.440]  They have all these different scenarios where it's like that you can play the scenario.
[3:54:36.440 --> 3:54:40.440]  Now, I'm being silly, but in a way, that's kind of how this stuff operates.
[3:54:40.440 --> 3:54:47.440]  Like, I see the scenarios in lockstep like that. Like, let's roll out, you know, the next thing in this scenario.
[3:54:47.440 --> 3:54:50.440]  Like, let's roll out some fake Republicans, right?
[3:54:50.440 --> 3:54:55.440]  Oh, yes, those would be great. We would have the rhinos that we control, right?
[3:54:55.440 --> 3:55:00.440]  And then, then we can use the Vatican. Let's roll out the Vatican, right?
[3:55:00.440 --> 3:55:06.440]  So let's roll out the Vatican. The pope will promote the great reset and the stabius in your arms.
[3:55:06.440 --> 3:55:12.440]  Anyway, back to this document. I'm being silly, but quite literally this scenario is about,
[3:55:12.440 --> 3:55:17.440]  as a result of the hacking, there's global crises, global collapses, food shortages, etc.
[3:55:17.440 --> 3:55:24.440]  And so once again, what does it lead to? It leads to total control, total top-down surveillance,
[3:55:24.440 --> 3:55:26.440]  everybody being tracked and traced.
[3:55:26.440 --> 3:55:31.440]  As a solution, again, two problems that they initiate.
[3:55:31.440 --> 3:55:38.440]  They promote consumerism and then you're bad for consuming.
[3:55:38.440 --> 3:55:43.440]  But what was most interesting about the hack attacks section was, guess what pops up here?
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:47.440]  Synthetic biology. The very thing that Klaus talks about all the time.
[3:55:47.440 --> 3:55:56.440]  It's a synthetic biology. Now, when they talk about synthetic biology, it's everything from GMOs to fake meat,
[3:55:56.440 --> 3:56:03.440]  to synthetic silicon humans, going in your body to make use of that.
[3:56:03.440 --> 3:56:09.440]  That's literally, it encompasses all of that, right?
[3:56:09.440 --> 3:56:18.440]  So in other words, synthetic biology, which the next page mentions as GMOs, as biology,
[3:56:18.440 --> 3:56:22.440]  is also listed as a potential bio weapon.
[3:56:22.440 --> 3:56:27.440]  They say the terrorist should get ahold of the synthetic biology and becomes a bio weapon.
[3:56:27.440 --> 3:56:30.440]  And they even mention vaccines. Interesting.
[3:56:30.440 --> 3:56:33.440]  I didn't think vaccines could be that kind of a thing, but actually in this scenario,
[3:56:33.440 --> 3:56:37.440]  they say terrorists might get ahold of vaccines, right?
[3:56:37.440 --> 3:56:43.440]  And then it's tainted and now no one trusts vaccines because of the terrorists.
[3:56:43.440 --> 3:56:48.440]  They even give a minority report scenario where everybody's retinas are tracked and traced.
[3:56:48.440 --> 3:56:55.440]  There's a global database on everybody's retinas, literally what's in minority report, right?
[3:56:55.440 --> 3:56:59.440]  So you get the idea, right? That's the essence of what's in lockstep.
[3:56:59.440 --> 3:57:03.440]  There's a couple more scenarios of virtual worlds that they propose.
[3:57:03.440 --> 3:57:08.440]  But this is, again, a key document that shows it's not just a plan,
[3:57:08.440 --> 3:57:18.440]  but it's a war-gamed exercise that is also a plan as well as these other exercises that I think they're using now.
