[00:00.000 --> 00:17.980]  The destruction of America from within has been going on for over 200 years.
[00:17.980 --> 00:24.680]  Seven years after the American Revolution, the Paris Peace Treaty of 1783 established
[00:24.680 --> 00:30.480]  the King of England as the Prince-Elector of the United States, and America continued
[00:30.480 --> 00:33.160]  paying debts to the Crown.
[00:33.160 --> 00:37.840]  During the War of 1812, the British torched the White House.
[00:37.840 --> 00:44.480]  The Act of 1871 created a separate corporate government for the District of Columbia, allowing
[00:44.480 --> 00:51.480]  it to operate with its own laws outside of the U.S. Constitution, creating the Corporation
[00:51.480 --> 00:57.400]  of the United States, and a new city-state for the Old World Order, with its financial
[00:57.400 --> 01:03.040]  capital in the City of London, its religious capital in Vatican City, and its military
[01:03.040 --> 01:05.880]  capital in the District of Columbia.
[01:05.880 --> 01:09.200]  These city-states have their own sovereignty.
[01:09.200 --> 01:16.480]  In 1913, the Federal Reserve Act gave full control of America's wealth to a private corporation
[01:16.480 --> 01:19.720]  beholden to the City of London.
[01:19.720 --> 01:25.800]  During the Nuremberg trials, only 19 were found guilty, while hundreds of Nazi war
[01:25.800 --> 01:31.840]  criminals were given jobs in the United States military-industrial complex.
[01:31.840 --> 01:37.960]  If you were to search online for just about any Middle Eastern country in the 1950s, you
[01:37.960 --> 01:43.840]  will see what the region looked like before British Petroleum, the CIA, and the Mossad
[01:43.840 --> 01:50.640]  turned it into a hellhole of radical Islamic rule. Placing psychotic puppets in power,
[01:50.640 --> 01:56.880]  the Old World Order then used it as a catalyst for the war against terror, which was then
[01:56.880 --> 02:03.160]  used to destabilize the region and create the catalyst for mass migration into Europe
[02:03.160 --> 02:04.720]  and America.
[02:04.720 --> 02:10.360]  Many Americans refused to recognize the endless crimes against humanity being committed by
[02:10.360 --> 02:15.760]  our own government, and so, by default, they blindly supported.
[02:15.760 --> 02:20.760]  Even when the American government is caught funding bio-weapons labs around the Russian
[02:20.760 --> 02:26.600]  border, many Americans turn a blind eye, and so now the majority of the world stands with
[02:26.600 --> 02:31.760]  Russia and see America as the main threat against humanity.
[02:31.760 --> 02:38.360]  A new video produced by Russia's Wagner Private Military is now recruiting Americans to join
[02:38.360 --> 02:44.240]  them in their fight against the United States, pointing out how the United States has become
[02:44.240 --> 02:50.440]  a force of evil and is no longer what our forefathers intended it to be.
[02:50.440 --> 02:56.560]  You were a hero to your country, giving your best years in the army. You dreamed of defeating
[02:56.560 --> 03:09.760]  evil. You dreamed of doing much to make America great again.
[03:09.760 --> 03:17.800]  But in reality, you saw criminal odors, the destruction of nations, the death of civilians,
[03:17.800 --> 03:23.160]  and all for the will of a bunch of families who thought they were earthly gods, deciding
[03:23.160 --> 03:46.560]  who would live under the Europe and who would be destroyed.
[03:46.560 --> 03:52.280]  You began to realize that this is the side of evil. This is not the America the founding
[03:52.280 --> 03:58.920]  fathers dreamed of. It has become the focus of the evil that is destroying the whole world.
[03:58.920 --> 04:11.400]  And today, the only country fighting this evil is Russia.
[04:11.400 --> 04:16.600]  If you're a true patriot of the very future Great America, join the ranks of the warriors
[04:16.600 --> 04:28.120]  of Russia. Help defeat evil or it will be too late for everyone.
[04:28.120 --> 04:33.000]  If Americans were as righteous as we think we are, then we would not stand for such a
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.240]  corrupt government, wreaking havoc on the rest of the world in our name. Instead, most
[04:39.240 --> 04:43.920]  of us are content fighting each other and turning a blind eye.
[04:43.920 --> 05:00.920]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[05:00.920 --> 05:23.320]  What
[05:23.320 --> 05:26.320]  Like, chip shape for the ladies, mate.
[05:26.320 --> 05:28.320]  Diet force is the go.
[05:28.320 --> 05:31.320]  You have to get the diet force and have it to a day.
[05:31.320 --> 05:32.320]  And just keep acting.

[05:34.320 --> 05:35.320]  X7 diet force.

[05:39.320 --> 05:40.320]  Diet force.

[05:42.320 --> 05:43.320]  I can guarantee you that.
[05:43.320 --> 05:44.320]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[05:44.320 --> 05:45.320]  Oh, ho!
[05:45.320 --> 05:46.320]  God bless Australia.
[05:46.320 --> 05:47.320]  We'll be right back, folks.
[05:47.320 --> 05:48.320]  Don't go anywhere.
[05:48.320 --> 05:49.320]  Infowarsstore.com.
[05:49.320 --> 05:50.320]  Diet force.
[05:50.320 --> 05:52.320]  Let's get it now.
[06:20.320 --> 06:28.320]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:28.320 --> 06:30.320]  All right, I took off three broadcast days
[06:30.320 --> 06:32.320]  to spend time with my family.
[06:32.320 --> 06:36.320]  I took off five broadcast days.
[06:36.320 --> 06:38.320]  A month before that, a lot of people say,
[06:38.320 --> 06:40.320]  Alex, you're usually working seven days a week.
[06:40.320 --> 06:42.320]  What have you been doing when things are so intense
[06:42.320 --> 06:43.320]  and so crazy?
[06:43.320 --> 06:45.320]  I've been on there 28 years.
[06:45.320 --> 06:47.320]  And I really care deeply about the news,
[06:47.320 --> 06:49.320]  the information, probably more than most people on air.
[06:49.320 --> 06:52.320]  I think that's a conservative way to put it.
[06:52.320 --> 06:55.320]  But at the same time, when the times are so incredibly dire,
[06:55.320 --> 06:58.320]  and I've really not spent enough time with my family
[06:58.320 --> 07:02.320]  for many, many years, I am making my family the priority.
[07:02.320 --> 07:05.320]  And I am also getting my family ready for future
[07:05.320 --> 07:11.320]  bioweapon releases and for more lockdowns in World War III.
[07:11.320 --> 07:13.320]  And I would advise everybody else out there
[07:13.320 --> 07:15.320]  to be getting yourselves ready as well.
[07:15.320 --> 07:17.320]  Because if we don't back the globalist off
[07:17.320 --> 07:19.320]  with what they're doing right now,
[07:19.320 --> 07:23.320]  we're going to look back on the terrible times
[07:23.320 --> 07:26.320]  we've seen the last three years as a walk in the park.
[07:26.320 --> 07:28.320]  And I know it's not a cakewalk for people
[07:28.320 --> 07:31.320]  that have been injured or killed by these deadly shots,
[07:31.320 --> 07:34.320]  but it's just simply an insane moment.
[07:34.320 --> 07:37.320]  I got to the point where I couldn't ever get away
[07:37.320 --> 07:38.320]  from the broadcast.
[07:38.320 --> 07:39.320]  I couldn't stop reading news.
[07:39.320 --> 07:42.320]  I couldn't stop having everything that was going on
[07:42.320 --> 07:43.320]  at every moment.
[07:43.320 --> 07:46.320]  And I realized that I'd been staring into the abyss too long
[07:46.320 --> 07:49.320]  and just had to get back closer to God,
[07:49.320 --> 07:52.320]  closer to family, and to really focus and research
[07:52.320 --> 07:54.320]  and meditate on the big picture.
[07:54.320 --> 07:56.320]  And I've written a lot of notes the last few months
[07:56.320 --> 07:57.320]  on those subjects.
[07:57.320 --> 08:00.320]  And I intend very soon to be doing
[08:00.320 --> 08:03.320]  some PowerPoint style presentations that are big picture
[08:03.320 --> 08:06.320]  and where we've been, where we are, where we're going,
[08:06.320 --> 08:10.320]  and of course still doing the show six days a week as well.
[08:10.320 --> 08:15.320]  But I desperately needed to focus
[08:15.320 --> 08:19.320]  more on my family and get more into balance
[08:19.320 --> 08:23.320]  so that I could really then have a fresh perspective
[08:23.320 --> 08:25.320]  on understanding where we are right now.
[08:25.320 --> 08:29.320]  And so now I am in a crank back up my workload
[08:29.320 --> 08:32.320]  and it'll be, I guess, tomorrow or so.
[08:32.320 --> 08:34.320]  So I'm a little bit behind on this
[08:34.320 --> 08:35.320]  because of all the stuff going on.
[08:35.320 --> 08:37.320]  We also have ice storms in Texas.
[08:37.320 --> 08:40.320]  So part of the crew couldn't get into the office today
[08:40.320 --> 08:44.320]  and be able to help me do a special live show tonight
[08:44.320 --> 08:46.320]  at 6 p.m. that I was going to announce today and do
[08:46.320 --> 08:48.320]  for two hours, commercial free,
[08:48.320 --> 08:50.320]  with special guest analysis and news.
[08:50.320 --> 08:52.320]  But I barely got out of where I live
[08:52.320 --> 08:54.320]  because there's some hills with the black ice
[08:54.320 --> 08:57.320]  and a lot of the crew is just frozen in.
[08:57.320 --> 09:00.320]  It's supposedly going to thaw tomorrow morning
[09:00.320 --> 09:02.320]  so we shouldn't have as many issues with the personnel.
[09:02.320 --> 09:04.320]  We've got a skeleton crew in here that got in.
[09:04.320 --> 09:09.320]  Most areas that are flat, no real ice, easy to get to work.
[09:09.320 --> 09:10.320]  But if you live in the hills
[09:10.320 --> 09:12.320]  and about half of Austin's extremely hilly,
[09:12.320 --> 09:16.320]  if you've got a big road or a big hill
[09:16.320 --> 09:18.320]  or a big overpass by your house
[09:18.320 --> 09:20.320]  and they haven't had a chance to salt it,
[09:20.320 --> 09:22.320]  you're not going to get out of your home
[09:22.320 --> 09:25.320]  without having a very good chance of having a wreck.
[09:25.320 --> 09:29.320]  I went ahead and did drive over the black ice
[09:29.320 --> 09:30.320]  and get up the hill,
[09:30.320 --> 09:34.320]  but the car did have a little bit of an issue
[09:34.320 --> 09:36.320]  and so I could see why I'm not going to demand
[09:36.320 --> 09:39.320]  that my crew that lives in similar areas
[09:39.320 --> 09:42.320]  or similar type terrain be here.
[09:42.320 --> 09:45.320]  But I am here and so tonight I won't be going live
[09:45.320 --> 09:47.320]  at 6 p.m. with a new special show.
[09:47.320 --> 09:49.320]  I'm going to be announcing some of the things
[09:49.320 --> 09:50.320]  we're going to be doing.
[09:50.320 --> 09:51.320]  And we've got a lot of initiatives
[09:51.320 --> 09:53.320]  that have been very pregnant for a long time
[09:53.320 --> 09:54.320]  that are behind schedule,
[09:54.320 --> 09:56.320]  that are going to be launching here very, very soon.
[09:56.320 --> 09:59.320]  I don't always get things done on time,
[09:59.320 --> 10:02.320]  but I always end up doing what I say I'm going to do
[10:02.320 --> 10:04.320]  and I couldn't do this without you
[10:04.320 --> 10:06.320]  and I'm very, very thankful for all of you
[10:06.320 --> 10:07.320]  and the family that is Info Wars
[10:07.320 --> 10:10.320]  because you realize that if you're going to have a free future
[10:10.320 --> 10:13.320]  and a decent future and control your destiny,
[10:13.320 --> 10:16.320]  you need Info Wars and I understand if I'm going to be free
[10:16.320 --> 10:18.320]  and my family is going to be free, I need you.
[10:18.320 --> 10:21.320]  And so this is really a symbiotic connection we have.
[10:21.320 --> 10:24.320]  The news is so over the top as usual
[10:24.320 --> 10:27.320]  that it's mind-blowing.
[10:27.320 --> 10:31.320]  So when I took off the weekend and Monday and Tuesday,
[10:31.320 --> 10:35.320]  I still did hours of research a day or more,
[10:35.320 --> 10:38.320]  especially once my wife and children went to sleep at night.
[10:38.320 --> 10:41.320]  I did some research and so I've really last four or five days
[10:41.320 --> 10:44.320]  of news here, it's all extremely important
[10:44.320 --> 10:46.320]  and I'm going to do my best here to just go ahead
[10:46.320 --> 10:48.320]  and start plowing directly into it.
[10:48.320 --> 10:50.320]  Let me tell you what's coming up.
[10:50.320 --> 10:54.320]  We now know more of why Russia wanted to invade Ukraine.
[10:54.320 --> 10:57.320]  Russia had said this about a year ago
[10:57.320 --> 11:02.320]  on the eve of their invasion that came on February 24th, 2022.
[11:02.320 --> 11:06.320]  It's now February 1st, 2023, so a little under a year ago.
[11:06.320 --> 11:09.320]  They said Ukraine is trying to acquire nuclear weapons
[11:09.320 --> 11:12.320]  and Ukraine is covertly preparing to join NATO
[11:12.320 --> 11:15.320]  and NATO forces are already on the ground
[11:15.320 --> 11:18.320]  moving up against the Russian border.
[11:18.320 --> 11:22.320]  That is now all admitted in Al Jazeera and BBC and CNN
[11:22.320 --> 11:24.320]  like it's a good thing.
[11:24.320 --> 11:27.320]  And buried in the articles, Ukraine's like,
[11:27.320 --> 11:29.320]  we've been trying to get nukes for years.
[11:29.320 --> 11:33.320]  Ukraine may seek nuclear weapons if left out of NATO,
[11:33.320 --> 11:36.320]  diplomat says, here is the Hill newspaper,
[11:36.320 --> 11:38.320]  to prevent the next Ukraine we need to clarify
[11:38.320 --> 11:40.320]  about the role of nuclear weapons.
[11:40.320 --> 11:42.320]  That's like Sean Penn saying let's use nuclear weapons.
[11:42.320 --> 11:45.320]  Russia says real danger of Ukraine acquiring nuclear weapons
[11:45.320 --> 11:48.320]  requires response.
[11:48.320 --> 11:53.320]  Only nuclear weapons give Ukraine security, guarantees.
[11:53.320 --> 11:57.320]  Hashtag Ukraine is now demanding nuclear weapons
[11:57.320 --> 11:59.320]  and it just goes on from there.
[11:59.320 --> 12:03.320]  US accuses Russia of violating major nuclear treaty.
[12:03.320 --> 12:07.320]  For folks that don't study military history
[12:07.320 --> 12:11.320]  or threat escalation, this is exactly how
[12:11.320 --> 12:14.320]  all the experts agreed this would probably start going.
[12:14.320 --> 12:17.320]  If it began to escalate, it would just continue to escalate
[12:17.320 --> 12:22.320]  into regional nuclear war and then full-bore planetary nuclear war.
[12:22.320 --> 12:25.320]  And Pakistan will hit India vice versa,
[12:25.320 --> 12:27.320]  China will get involved.
[12:27.320 --> 12:30.320]  The whole thing is just countdown to extinction.
[12:30.320 --> 12:33.320]  So all the distractions and all the sports
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.320]  and all the Hollywood shows and all the Avenger programs
[12:37.320 --> 12:41.320]  and all the fantasy land and all the tabloid crap
[12:41.320 --> 12:46.320]  doesn't matter, doesn't even show up on a Richter scale
[12:46.320 --> 12:49.320]  in my view compared to this.
[12:49.320 --> 12:51.320]  And this is going downhill very, very quickly.
[12:51.320 --> 12:54.320]  They follow a formula of we'll never give them tanks.
[12:54.320 --> 12:56.320]  We'll just give them armored vehicles.
[12:56.320 --> 12:57.320]  OK, we'll give them medium tanks.
[12:57.320 --> 12:59.320]  We'll never give them heavy tanks.
[12:59.320 --> 13:00.320]  OK, we'll give them some heavy tanks.
[13:00.320 --> 13:01.320]  OK, we'll give them tons of heavy tanks.
[13:01.320 --> 13:03.320]  OK, we'll never give them aircraft.
[13:03.320 --> 13:04.320]  We'll give them some aircraft.
[13:04.320 --> 13:06.320]  We won't give them the most high-tech aircraft.
[13:06.320 --> 13:08.320]  Well, maybe we'll give them the most high-tech aircraft.
[13:08.320 --> 13:09.320]  Yeah, we'll give them the most high-tech aircraft.
[13:09.320 --> 13:12.320]  We'll never have airmen in most aircraft.
[13:12.320 --> 13:15.320]  Well, yeah we're going to have our troops there.
[13:15.320 --> 13:18.320]  Yeah, our troops are there helping them operate equipment.
[13:18.320 --> 13:21.320]  Yeah, we're going to move nuclear weapons into Ukraine.
[13:21.320 --> 13:22.320]  Yes, we may use tactical nukes on the Russians.
[13:22.320 --> 13:27.360]  them first. And then having US senators with both parties on TV saying, you know, let's
[13:27.360 --> 13:34.440]  go ahead and nuke Russia. I mean, this is absolute complete and total crazy town, the
[13:34.440 --> 13:42.520]  very essence of Armageddon. Armageddon is looming. So this just speaks for itself. If there's
[13:42.520 --> 13:46.000]  really nothing else you can say about it, other than I'll open the phones up to get
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.720]  your tag on World War Three and can it be averted? I mean, it's not that I have a feeling
[13:50.720 --> 13:56.040]  of resignation. It's just that I see not our audience of great activists, but the general
[13:56.040 --> 14:00.520]  public somewhat awakened poll showed I didn't trust the government of the media and those
[14:00.520 --> 14:05.440]  covered was a fraud. And we're talking up the 80% now. Okay, so yeah, big awakening.
[14:05.440 --> 14:12.320]  But what does it do if your eyes wide open, if they're wide shut, and you know what's
[14:12.320 --> 14:16.840]  going on, but you don't realize how much peril you're in, because you've lived in comparative
[14:16.840 --> 14:22.080]  liberty and freedom and security for so long? I mean, this is just unbelievable. And then
[14:22.080 --> 14:26.720]  there's cherries on top like this one. Prestigious liberal watchdog condemns New York Times,
[14:26.720 --> 14:32.640]  Russiagate coverage says they premeditatedly fabricated evidence. Well, Adam Schiff faked
[14:32.640 --> 14:37.680]  a whole bunch of fake text messages in the in the January 6 committee, and then misrepresented
[14:37.680 --> 14:44.800]  stuff I said and did. Yes, they fabricate stuff because they get away with it. But we'll
[14:44.800 --> 14:52.840]  be getting to that. Also, I mean, on the COVID front, the rats have left the sinking ship.
[14:52.840 --> 14:59.600]  And now the ship is sinking completely. We have the director of the CDC task force on
[14:59.600 --> 15:03.760]  vaccines saying it is killing people and hurting them. There's a cover up. That's the video
[15:03.760 --> 15:10.200]  to talk for four hours about that just one video. prestigious top insurance analysts
[15:10.200 --> 15:15.920]  find 7% increase in mortality for each covid shot you take, whether it's Pfizer or Moderna.
[15:15.920 --> 15:19.680]  And that's what we've said. Most people will take in that new take on take two. That's
[15:19.680 --> 15:23.360]  13 to 14% the global average of increased death. See right there.
[15:23.360 --> 15:30.000]  It's up in the 20s when you take the fourth one. If you take the fifth one, I mean, you
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.760]  are getting the dough now very quickly. We've got Congressman Massey saying with Democrats
[15:36.760 --> 15:40.480]  are in full retreat, the whole covid last collapse, public's turned against them. That's true.
[15:40.480 --> 15:45.680]  But again, what do we do? I mean, that's just three articles out of like 45. I've got here
[15:45.680 --> 15:50.200]  literally in the stack on that. I mean, it's all bombshell on top of bombshell on top
[15:50.200 --> 15:55.600]  of bombshell as we march headlong into what can only be described as the end of the world.

[19:00.720 --> 19:08.160]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist. I have come from nowhere to
[19:08.160 --> 19:14.080]  the very heights of politics not just in America but the world. We are engaging the globalist
[19:14.080 --> 19:19.360]  at point like range in the information war. But I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've
[19:19.360 --> 19:24.760]  persevered. But the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason you have
[19:24.760 --> 19:30.280]  the success we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order
[19:30.280 --> 19:37.680]  you've ever had. We are now entering the final mile of the marathon. And that's why today
[19:37.680 --> 19:41.280]  it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to
[19:41.280 --> 19:46.400]  continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify that I bless you all.
[19:46.400 --> 19:51.800]  I salute you. I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we
[19:51.800 --> 19:56.640]  are over the target and this is happening. The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's
[19:56.640 --> 20:02.080]  our fight. God bless you all.
[20:02.080 --> 20:07.960]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[20:32.080 --> 20:51.800]  You have found it, ladies and gentlemen, the broadcast. The enemies of freedom are battling
[20:51.800 --> 20:56.920]  to take off the air because they want to silence those that stand up for the people of this
[20:56.920 --> 21:01.640]  planet. Let me do this. Let me mention some of the other news and then I'm going to start
[21:01.640 --> 21:07.120]  plowing in to the COVID news and I'm going to give the number out and I'm going to take
[21:07.120 --> 21:13.720]  calls on the World War III situation where you think that is going specifically on that
[21:13.720 --> 21:20.600]  topic and on the poison shot topic specifically. But look at some of these other headlines
[21:20.600 --> 21:28.800]  here in the stack. This is so huge. It's out of the gateway pundit. Hunter Biden was receiving
[21:28.800 --> 21:33.360]  classified State Department briefings on a regular basis. He used to promote Biden family
[21:33.360 --> 21:39.160]  business where he was selling the knowledge to the Communist Chinese. And now the feds
[21:39.160 --> 21:46.240]  have raided the Biden's Beach House. Another raid. F.A. agents swarmed Joe Biden's Beach
[21:46.240 --> 21:55.880]  House as the slow roll continues. And of course, what were they doing with some of the new
[21:55.880 --> 22:00.520]  funding that Hunter Biden was getting as well? The millions of dollars. They were studying
[22:00.520 --> 22:08.640]  splicing gain of function viruses together in Ukraine. I mean, you can't make this up.
[22:08.640 --> 22:16.240]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, they're figuring out a kill us and terrorizes into their control.
[22:16.240 --> 22:20.640]  While they divide and conquer us, we have on average two police officers a day being
[22:20.640 --> 22:24.920]  murdered in America. The police aren't perfect or some bad ones. There's some good ones,
[22:24.920 --> 22:30.360]  but you have, of course, the Trey Nichols story where they're trying to create a race
[22:30.360 --> 22:38.280]  war in this country and CNN and others are saying Van Jones and others are saying that
[22:38.280 --> 22:46.400]  it was white supremacism is why the black officers beat the guy to death. Yes, because
[22:46.400 --> 22:51.000]  they were white supremacists. We have the national statistics. We've covered them many
[22:51.000 --> 22:57.320]  times. I'm not trying to single anybody out. It's a fact. On average, 11 times crimes are
[22:57.320 --> 23:01.480]  committed against whites by blacks for every time a white commits a crime against a black
[23:01.480 --> 23:07.440]  person, a violent crime. And in some areas, it's 20 to one or higher. And that's still
[23:07.440 --> 23:12.800]  a small minority of black folks that are doing it. Only black males, 13 to age about 25 come
[23:12.800 --> 23:16.320]  from fatherless homes that are brought up in a gangster culture by the gangs. You see
[23:16.320 --> 23:21.520]  that with all these other gangs with MS 13 and recruiting young people to go out and do
[23:21.520 --> 23:27.080]  this type of crap. But the point is that when Antifa was burning things down a few weeks
[23:27.080 --> 23:32.520]  ago in Atlanta and black cops were mainly the guy stopping them, we're having Molov
[23:32.520 --> 23:37.080]  cocktail thrown at them. They're calling them racist too. And so you have to understand
[23:37.080 --> 23:40.600]  that they're creating this climate of a collapsed society. They're letting criminals of all
[23:40.600 --> 23:46.800]  colors out if they commit violent crimes or violent crime, knowing it'll spur an intensification.
[23:46.800 --> 23:50.680]  And then they can come in and quote reform the police by turning them into pure globalist
[23:50.680 --> 23:56.200]  operatives. So the message is when cops get mad situations, which are questionable, they're
[23:56.200 --> 23:59.640]  always going to be prosecuted even if they're innocent, unless they've gone into the George
[23:59.640 --> 24:05.400]  Soros leftist DA system of control, then they can do all the things they want. And if you
[24:05.400 --> 24:09.880]  think American cops have problems, wait to live under a communist or authoritarian or
[24:09.880 --> 24:18.200]  totalitarian system with the police. But opinion, the police who were killed, Nichols, Tyrae
[24:18.200 --> 24:24.720]  Nichols were black, but they might still have been driven by racism. That's right, ladies
[24:24.720 --> 24:31.200]  and gentlemen. Meanwhile, the police guard CNN facilities all over the country will be
[24:31.200 --> 24:36.680]  Goldberg on her program. The view said, do we need to see white people also get beaten
[24:36.680 --> 24:41.960]  before anybody will do anything? We're seeing plenty of white people getting beat. Let me
[24:41.960 --> 24:45.800]  show you a latest video here in the US of a white guy laying there doing nothing being
[24:45.800 --> 24:50.480]  tasered and attacked by a dog. And five police jump on him and kick him in the face because
[24:50.480 --> 24:55.440]  he's an agony. I think this is wrong. This is stupid. And they should get in some trouble
[24:55.440 --> 25:01.520]  for this. We need to know the full details. I still haven't come out. But the reason I
[25:01.520 --> 25:13.400]  raise this, the reason I raise this is it's not just that it's 10 to 11, 11 to one black
[25:13.400 --> 25:19.520]  on white crime. That's a national statistic. I can't hide that. If you're a white male,
[25:19.520 --> 25:27.440]  particularly, you were twice as likely to be killed by the police per capita. That means
[25:27.440 --> 25:31.600]  ratio to ratio. Not because there's more white people here twice as likely. Now, if you're
[25:31.600 --> 25:37.160]  a white male, you were twice as likely to be killed by the police of your black male.
[25:37.160 --> 25:41.560]  You know why that is? The cops slow roll the black areas. They're predominantly black.
[25:41.560 --> 25:47.360]  They know they'll go to jail. That's why you hear the recordings and Philly and Chicago
[25:47.360 --> 25:51.640]  and Dallas where you'll hear white and black cops. You can hear their accents. And there's
[25:51.640 --> 25:55.000]  a shootout between gangs. They go, just let them do it. We're not going to get in the
[25:55.000 --> 26:02.440]  middle of it. Let them kill each other. Now, if it's a white person, the cops will use
[26:02.440 --> 26:07.040]  what their old tactics that are designed to get them home alive at night. And some can
[26:07.040 --> 26:11.680]  say they're militaristic and pretty brutal. And that whole threat continuum, that escalation
[26:11.680 --> 26:16.640]  of when they either make a mistake and shoot an innocent person or you resist or they think
[26:16.640 --> 26:21.360]  you're resisting or they think you've got a gun and you don't, they kill you. The world's
[26:21.360 --> 26:24.960]  not a perfect place. That happens and when the police are wrong, they should get in trouble
[26:24.960 --> 26:32.360]  for it. But it's just not true. It's not true that you're more likely if you're a black person
[26:32.360 --> 26:36.680]  to be killed by the police than if you're white. It's just not true. You're twice as likely
[26:36.680 --> 26:41.000]  to be killed if you're a white male because the cops know they're not going to get in
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.560]  trouble if they beat the limits, not out of you or if they kill you, especially if they
[26:47.560 --> 26:53.040]  have a reason to. But now even when they have a reason to, they get in trouble. So again,
[26:53.040 --> 26:58.120]  they are not enforcing in predominantly minority areas, particularly black areas. And that's
[26:58.120 --> 27:03.800]  why crime has skyrocketed. You see it in Minnesota. You see it all over the place where the city
[27:03.800 --> 27:07.800]  councils will fire a third of the cops, half the cops, but then double their own security
[27:07.800 --> 27:14.720]  detail, double their own security detail. Whereas you see all these videos when the police are
[27:14.720 --> 27:19.840]  dealing with black males, they literally, it's like they're at a daycare center or something.
[27:19.840 --> 27:24.280]  Please put the knife down. Please put the gun down. Please don't aim the gun at me. Okay,
[27:24.280 --> 27:29.000]  you're aiming the gun at me. I'm going to shoot you. Okay, boom, boom, boom. And still
[27:29.000 --> 27:35.080]  there's riots, still there's insanity, still there's crazy tone. And I'm done talking about
[27:35.080 --> 27:40.920]  that subject. But if I wanted to show you police being killed, but I can show you those videos
[27:40.920 --> 27:44.360]  all day, especially when the black lives matter stuff was going on, people were just going
[27:44.360 --> 27:49.320]  picking off cops everywhere. Do we humanize them when they're being killed? No, we should.
[27:49.320 --> 27:54.000]  But I try not to show the black people killing white people. I try. But you know what, maybe
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.760]  we should because the media covers it up. I even have mainstream news articles in Germany
[27:58.760 --> 28:03.600]  and the US and UK saying, Oh, we're not going to show when a quote minority kills a white
[28:03.600 --> 28:09.840]  person or stabs a white person, because that adds the racism. No, that shows this open season
[28:09.840 --> 28:14.520]  on white people and it needs to stop. And that's what's been set up in this country.
[28:14.520 --> 28:20.000]  And no one can deny the statistics. No one can deny the facts, but I don't care if you're
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.720]  black or white or older, younger, gay or straight or purple polka dot it. When you go through
[28:25.720 --> 28:31.880]  TSA, they grab your junk, they get all over you. They get in, you know, and I'm not saying
[28:31.880 --> 28:38.960]  they're all bad people, but the administration of it, internal set points in America. But
[28:38.960 --> 28:42.840]  meanwhile, the border is wide open. It just the duck doesn't fly. It doesn't even quack.
[28:42.840 --> 28:48.520]  It doesn't even swim. It's not a duck. The dog doesn't hunt. It's just a fraud. We're
[28:48.520 --> 28:52.960]  setting up internal checkpoints with the borders wide open. Riddle me that, Batman. We'll be
[28:52.960 --> 29:11.840]  right back with more news straight ahead. Stay with us. Hey, what's up on? Hey, McBreen.

[33:07.040 --> 33:34.680]  Jones. If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info
[33:34.680 --> 33:53.640]  war.com studios it's Alex Jones. In 2020 Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum warned
[33:53.640 --> 34:01.240]  of an impending cyber attack that will take down all of society. We all know that still
[34:01.240 --> 34:10.320]  pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which
[34:10.320 --> 34:19.680]  would bring to a complete halt to the power supply transportation hospital services our
[34:19.680 --> 34:28.980]  society as a whole. In 2022 Joe Biden stated that sending tanks to Ukraine is called World
[34:28.980 --> 34:35.200]  War 3. The idea the idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes
[34:35.200 --> 34:42.480]  and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews just understand
[34:42.480 --> 34:49.840]  don't kid yourself no matter what you all say that's called World War 3. Earlier this
[34:49.840 --> 34:57.240]  month managing director of the World Economic Forum Jeremy Jergens says that a catastrophic
[34:57.240 --> 35:03.680]  cyber event will likely occur in the next two years. The most striking finding that we
[35:03.680 --> 35:11.720]  found is that 93% of cyber leaders and 86% of cyber business leaders believe that the
[35:11.720 --> 35:19.840]  geopolitical instability makes a catastrophic cyber event likely in the next two years.
[35:19.840 --> 35:26.160]  This far exceeds anything that we've seen in previous surveys. This week a German foreign
[35:26.160 --> 35:32.560]  minister casually stated that they are at war with Russia and therefore I've said already
[35:32.560 --> 35:39.160]  in the last days yes we have to do more to defend Ukraine yes we have to do more also
[35:39.160 --> 35:45.520]  on tanks but the most important and the crucial part is that we do it together and that we
[35:45.520 --> 35:53.600]  do not do the blame game in Europe because we are fighting a war against Russia and not
[35:53.600 --> 36:02.600]  against each other thank you. President Joe Biden responds by sending 31 M1 Abrams tanks
[36:02.600 --> 36:09.760]  to Ukraine. Today I'm announcing that the United States will be sending 31 Abrams tanks
[36:09.760 --> 36:17.800]  to Ukraine. And now all of the media is warning of nuclear war or a Russian cyber attack.
[36:17.800 --> 36:24.560]  That'll be the first time they actually discuss it in Congress when we are hit with a massive
[36:24.560 --> 36:32.520]  cyber attack from Russia in response. If you are not suspicious by now then you are not
[36:32.520 --> 36:38.680]  paying attention. Our government is not at war with Russia they are at war with the American
[36:38.680 --> 36:45.400]  people and in order to build back better they need their cyber attack now they have a cover
[36:45.400 --> 36:52.880]  story and the media is sticking their finger into the PTSD wounds of all Americans so
[36:52.880 --> 37:00.480]  that we do nothing but sit at home in fear and wait for the end. Reporting for Infowars
[37:00.480 --> 37:09.880]  this is Greg Rees. Now if you go back to that piece we did that was released a week before
[37:09.880 --> 37:16.040]  the 2016 elections and it has quotes from Hillary Clinton saying if we are hit by a
[37:16.040 --> 37:19.800]  cyber attack by Russia that's an act of war and we will use nuclear weapons against them.
[37:19.800 --> 37:23.480]  Well that's a perfect way to set Russia up. I'm not saying Russia wouldn't launch a cyber
[37:23.480 --> 37:28.000]  attack but how do you prove it? You get all the Vault 7 documents that Edward Snowden
[37:28.000 --> 37:34.720]  released remember that's like 10, 15 year old material. It talks about the CIA using
[37:34.720 --> 37:40.480]  computer programs to frame people to launch cyber attacks from another country. They have
[37:40.480 --> 37:44.920]  a pretext to go after them and they've been really set in the table psychologically for
[37:44.920 --> 37:50.160]  that that it's going to be a cyber attack that's the pretext to escalate this war.
[37:50.160 --> 37:53.520]  So I have a special guest from the John Burns Society joining us in the third hour to deal
[37:53.520 --> 37:58.520]  with the constitutional conventions that they have a right wing Republican movement that
[37:58.520 --> 38:04.440]  looks right wing on the surface pushing and we have article 5 of the Constitution to be
[38:04.440 --> 38:08.440]  able to have constitutional conventions. I'm not saying we should never have one but the
[38:08.440 --> 38:13.000]  groups behind pushing it's pretty dangerous and I want to tie that in to Senator John
[38:13.000 --> 38:19.840]  Kennedy not John F. Kennedy the current Senator John Kennedy when he questioned Biden's judicial
[38:19.840 --> 38:25.920]  nominee last week and we'll cover this in the third hour and it was a judge and they
[38:25.920 --> 38:32.840]  couldn't say what the article 2 or article 5 was. This is a lawyer and a judge and the
[38:32.840 --> 38:38.200]  media is like oh it's a gotcha moment people would know that folks a first year law student
[38:38.200 --> 38:42.520]  would be flunked out in a test if they didn't answer the entire constitutional questions
[38:42.520 --> 38:51.400]  correctly and when I saw the clip last Friday I thought to myself well wait what is article
[38:51.400 --> 38:58.800]  2 that's the executive branch that establishes executive and article 5 that's a con con article
[38:58.800 --> 39:04.680]  5 con con constitutional convention and of course it is I mean the fact that I'm not
[39:04.680 --> 39:10.440]  even a lawyer or in government and I know this but they don't teach any of this in schools
[39:10.440 --> 39:16.920]  anymore and I know you know that that's why we're in so much trouble and it's also in
[39:16.920 --> 39:22.920]  the Constitution there's an article in the Constitution and I'll be honest with you my
[39:22.920 --> 39:29.480]  memory fails. Guys look up what article in the Constitution deals with declaration of
[39:29.480 --> 39:34.440]  war and it explains that Congress has to vote it has to be done because they didn't want
[39:34.440 --> 39:38.720]  to have a president who could just launch wars on his own that would be a dictator. The president
[39:38.720 --> 39:44.480]  executes a war once a war is going but Congress has to declare the war. Well we're in a war
[39:44.480 --> 39:50.760]  with Russia the fact to a war but has it been announced and the answer is no it has not
[39:50.760 --> 39:54.480]  been announced and so that's another one of the big topics in fact I'll pull up during
[39:54.480 --> 39:58.320]  the break I'll come back with it. What article in the Constitution deals with declaration
[39:58.320 --> 40:02.400]  of war I know the procedures but quite frankly ten years ago I knew all this stuff there's
[40:02.400 --> 40:06.720]  so much stuff now I just my head swims with the information I think you're the same way
[40:06.720 --> 40:13.360]  there's just so much at a certain point I'm like I just know this is unconstitutional
[40:13.360 --> 40:16.640]  that's sure enough you go read it and there it is right there so I remember what it says
[40:16.640 --> 40:29.120]  I just can't remember what amendment it is. Declaration of War Clause 11, 12, 13 and 14.
[40:29.120 --> 40:34.120]  Yeah but what article is it? I'm going to talk about the clauses of the article. That's
[40:34.120 --> 40:38.720]  what I was going to say article one was the declaration of war but I couldn't remember
[40:38.720 --> 40:50.480]  that's article one. Sub chapter 8 C11-3 declaration of war. Yeah guys print me that off I want
[40:50.480 --> 40:56.840]  to cover that because I mean this is just insane. Alright we're going to go to break
[40:56.840 --> 41:01.120]  I'm going to come back and hit all the incredible when I say incredible each day as we've seen
[41:01.120 --> 41:07.720]  it's not hype when I say this the poison shot news becomes so crazy that that's why I had
[41:07.720 --> 41:12.560]  to take time off the fact that this is all out in the open and no one's going to prison
[41:12.560 --> 41:16.680]  and they're normalizing killing us in mass and even their own executives and own board
[41:16.680 --> 41:24.840]  heads and the head of the vaccine program Tom Shimabukuro just admitted COVID-19 vaccines
[41:24.840 --> 41:29.400]  are causing debilitating illnesses and it just goes on and on from there this will take a
[41:29.400 --> 41:33.080]  couple segments to get to but I'm going to cover everything in this stack and then we're
[41:33.080 --> 41:39.800]  going to take your phone calls the toll free number to join us on the war and how do we
[41:39.800 --> 41:43.760]  stop it where do you see this going that gets into cyber attacks economic war the war on
[41:43.760 --> 41:51.200]  food it's a huge area and then also the poison COVID shots and how far is this going to go
[41:51.200 --> 41:55.800]  is just everything comes out hundreds of bombshells a day I mean hundreds I can't even keep track
[41:55.800 --> 42:01.400]  of it what's going to unfold here and how do you see the globalist extricating themselves
[42:01.400 --> 42:05.480]  from this because as Congressman Massey said the public's totally turned against him it's
[42:05.480 --> 42:09.800]  over 80 percent now they've lost all confidence the Democratic Party has seen as a criminal
[42:09.800 --> 42:16.080]  institution now he's absolutely right so what do you call this no man's land or this purgatory
[42:16.080 --> 42:26.960]  we're in right now toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 877-789 Alex
[42:26.960 --> 42:33.920]  on those two gigantore issues that are the pretext for the castle society the central
[42:33.920 --> 42:40.080]  bank digital currencies the social credit scores the carbon taxes the vaccine passports
[42:40.080 --> 42:44.120]  that's he and then of course world war three is all encompassing it's just massive massive
[42:44.120 --> 42:48.840]  subjects that come together to bring in the new world order we're going to take calls
[42:48.840 --> 42:55.080]  in the second hour stay with us info wars dot com and band on video or critical coordinates

[47:26.400 --> 47:31.360]  so as negative as all this news is we cover here on the alex jones show it's because I
[47:31.360 --> 47:34.480]  believe in humanity I believe you know the truth about how bad things are you'll you'll
[47:34.480 --> 47:38.600]  stand up make a change and that that's happening the power structure admits and all the studies
[47:38.600 --> 47:43.280]  and polls that vast majority of people don't trust the system they're turning against globalism
[47:43.280 --> 47:50.320]  they're turning against unelected international bodies of the WEF but is that enough and is
[47:50.320 --> 47:54.600]  it happening quick enough that that's that's really the issue and we have another five
[47:54.600 --> 47:58.680]  ten years to fully educate everybody else and the answer is no so I look at all these
[47:58.680 --> 48:03.000]  clips I set the crew and if I try to plan it'll take an hour so let me just show you
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.880]  the clips show you the articles show you what they say and move on to the next if you want
[48:06.880 --> 48:11.480]  to watch them you can find them most of them are on info wars dot com or you can just search
[48:11.480 --> 48:15.360]  the headline and you'll be able to find it online easily on twitter or instagram or facebook
[48:15.360 --> 48:19.680]  or youtube but let's just do this let's just read some of these headlines breaking director
[48:19.680 --> 48:27.440]  of cdc vaccine task force tom shimabuko just admitted covid-19 vaccines are causing debilitating
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.160]  illnesses wouldn't even admit it it's in the documents but there it is why would they suddenly
[48:32.160 --> 48:39.720]  admit that boosted our sickest patients top insurance analysts find seven percent increase
[48:39.720 --> 48:46.280]  that's seven percent increase in aggregate mortality that's dying for each c 19 received
[48:46.280 --> 48:55.760]  covid-19 dose received josh sterling the more doses you have in a u.s. region the bigger
[48:55.760 --> 49:01.560]  increase in mortality if you're over the age of fifty and you took all five doses that's
[49:01.560 --> 49:08.040]  a thirty five percent increase in death you know that's a five minute video you guys just
[49:08.040 --> 49:11.120]  queue it up where he reads that people need to actually hear this I don't want to just
[49:11.120 --> 49:16.040]  say I'm you know say I'm saying I want you to hear that he's arguably the most respected
[49:16.040 --> 49:21.480]  insurance company statistician and we just played the clip yesterday with the big MIT
[49:21.480 --> 49:26.160]  top statistician super respected means right up there at the top worldwide saying there's
[49:26.160 --> 49:33.240]  no doubt massive increase in death doesn't lie that's the facts the biden winehouse of
[49:33.240 --> 49:37.280]  democrats are in full retreat they've lost the confidence of the american people over
[49:37.280 --> 49:42.120]  their handling of covid-19 the american people can't wait until may 11th in demand action
[49:42.120 --> 49:47.240]  now that's when biden supposedly going to end the covid emergency which he said was

[50:26.040 --> 50:31.640]  government watchdog group let's continue fiser made a really weird admission in a statement
[50:31.640 --> 50:38.200]  following project veritas report where the executive the head of mrna worldwide admits
[50:38.200 --> 50:45.240]  that they're creating weaponized viruses now why is that so huge well because they didn't
[50:45.240 --> 50:49.160]  deny that the guy was the head of their program or worked there but they had surrogates for
[50:49.160 --> 50:54.720]  almost a week say it was fake but it wasn't fake most of this work is conducted this

[51:14.680 --> 51:20.760]  assessment of any viral activity in cells let's double speak they have weaponized it
[51:20.760 --> 51:28.880]  and they put it in there and see what those are cells as a oa 88 graduate of uts mwc this

[51:34.200 --> 51:41.840]  couldn't finish residency or get board certified and is picked up by fiser as a rnd director
[51:41.840 --> 51:48.720]  to be stung in a honey trap where he spills the beans about fiser real intentions for
[51:48.720 --> 51:57.440]  vaccines wow it took fiser this long to figure out that jordan walker in the photo below
[51:57.440 --> 52:03.760]  does not exist but now they admit he does exist and here's the photo on the fiser website
[52:03.760 --> 52:08.800]  they took off of him in a white lab coat with a stethoscope with the rest of the fiser salesman
[52:08.800 --> 52:12.520]  remember he said i'm not a scientist i'm not a doctor i'm a salesman when veritas can

[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.400]  but I want to play this one now in the short segment and come back to write your phone
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:13.280]  calls on the huge world war three news the poison shot news and the committee of 300
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.640]  news I want to get into and more but here is top insurance analyst finds a 7% increase
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:23.920]  in aggregate mortality for each COVID-19 dose you take here it is together an analyst that
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:31.160]  uses CDC data from the United States that compares the vaccination status ranked by the number
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:37.480]  of doses across regions in the United States and then compares that to whether to the amount
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:44.760]  of increase or decrease in mortality this year versus last mm-hmm and if the vaccine
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.160]  was helpful well if the vaccine was neutral there would just be no relationship between
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:53.400]  these two things mm-hmm if the vaccine was helpful reducing all cause mortality you would
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:58.560]  see that the more doses a region in a state state of Vermont or Maine or Hawaii or you
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.720]  know Connecticut or something someplace that's pretty highly vaccinated you would see lower
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:08.120]  levels of mortality year over year because people got more vaccines than in other places
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.440]  which we didn't do as much for whatever reason and you would see an improvement and you would
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:17.040]  see a line that slopes down the right instead when we did that analysis and we cut it a
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.640]  number of different ways we did it by different type of city and region and and we did it
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.120]  by age group as well so so we did some thoughtful to make sure there wasn't a bias in it but
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:30.200]  no matter which way you do it what you end up seeing is that the chart goes the line
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.680]  that you create a regression line goes up into the right which is to simply to say that
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:39.320]  the more doses on average you have in a region within the United States the bigger increase
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:46.960]  in mortality that region has had in 2022 when compared to 2021 and so that is a aggregate
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:52.880]  statistical tool that largely I mean it exactly confirms the conclusion out of the UK data
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.200]  it's a different way of doing it it's a totally different data set but ultimately it leads
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.840]  to a very similar mathematical conclusion which is a really unfortunate one because you know
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:05.120]  obviously hundreds of millions of us have have you know either with personally or our
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.400]  friends and family and all society have to now deal with these consequences of what are
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.320]  the long-term health consequences relating to these you know and I'm obviously hopeful
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.280]  that we can as a society start to focus on those because that's that's that's the opportunity
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.040]  to try to solve this problem is focusing on health.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.360]  There's something that's a bit unintuitive but I think you you're arguing that it kind
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.320]  of tells the same story one of them is that what you just described this regression line
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:38.160]  the more boosted people are the mortality among those groups is increases right but
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:44.000]  in the UK data I think you said that it's the single the the it's the first shot that
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.680]  actually shows the highest mortality so how do these how are these things not in opposition
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.360]  to each other.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:59.840]  It's a really good question Jan the they have to do with how the data is structured on an
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:05.500]  individual basis I think you can make a better prediction for an actual person's mortality
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:13.440]  risk based on the UK data which is to say that if you took one dose and stopped which
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.600]  is what that means because it wasn't a design study it's an observational study it's literally
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:23.480]  just did you stop at one dose then we can infer that based on the statistics we have
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.280]  from the UK that you're likely to have substantially higher elevated mortality.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:36.560]  The reason that we speculate or I think intuitively that explains that is that these people stopped
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.360]  because they were injured on the first dose or something basically they said okay I'm
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.200]  not doing this within 21 days they were supposed to get a second dose and they said no I'm
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:50.000]  not going to do that in the US that's about 12% of Americans what the data here would
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.200]  suggest is that if the relationships in the UK are same in the US that's you know 12 those
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:01.760]  people would have 145% higher mortality rate and the reason that that doesn't carry on
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.640]  to the US data in aggregate is because when you look at individual when you look at big
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:11.800]  groups of people the little individual signal there of their behavior is washed out because
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:15.760]  really what we're just saying is well were there more doses in Georgia than there were
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:21.280]  in Alabama or you know Vermont versus Maine or something like that and in that case it's
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.440]  all just you know it's just a question of what's the aggregate level of dosing in which
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:31.240]  case if you use the regression line on that sort of data you end up being able to very
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:36.120]  clearly draw like a conclusion that says you know the slope of the line is basically how
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.120]  much mortality increase you're getting from every dose and so it's about a 7% increase
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:46.120]  in aggregate mortality from US data per dose and if you're over the age of 15 you took
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:05:15.880]  all five doses there would be a 35% increase.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:20.440]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth well this is concentrated chicken broth the

[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:50.720]  shot on average a seven percent increase in mortality in just the first year directly
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:56.960]  correlated country by country Pfizer and Moderna because they're averaging together our evidence
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:03.240]  is Moderna's far worse it's quibble for the Pfizer's with the exact same cocktail GMO cocktail
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:10.760]  gene editing manipulating mRNA that is so huge and on average if you take five shots
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:19.080]  is a 35% increase in your death and your mortality I just played the full clip earlier top insurance
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:25.840]  analyst finds a 7% increase in aggregate mortality for each COVID-19 vaccine injection John Sterling
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.200]  hands down with the most respected out there the MIT scientists we played clips of yesterday
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:35.200]  who's one of their most respected statisticians found the same numbers and they crunch them
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.200]  different ways different methodologies and keep finding the same number the insurance
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.480]  companies knew this a year and a half ago folks we've been telling you before they even
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:47.360]  started the shots for two and a half years this was going down or longer now but here's
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:52.840]  a just an excise clip if you missed it Mr. Sterling no matter which way you do it what
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:57.520]  you end up seeing is the chart goes the line that you create a regression line goes up
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.240]  into the right which is to simply to say that the more doses on average you have in a region
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:08.520]  within the United States the bigger increase in mortality that region has had in 2022 when
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:14.120]  compared to 2021 and so it's about a 7% increase in aggregate mortality from US data per dose
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:23.280]  and if if you're over the age of 15 you took all five doses that'd be a 35% increase all
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:31.080]  right so there you go ladies and gentlemen do I need to play the MIT top statistician
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:37.200]  from yesterday say the same thing or how about the other experts we had on years ago say
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:43.080]  the same thing to see they had rat studies and rats only live really less than 10% of
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:51.240]  the time a human does but four or five years dog lives on average 15 cat lives on average
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:56.360]  about 15 humans 75 on average rats three four five years depending on them same thing with
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:04.520]  mice we know with the octopus matter of their huge North Atlantic octopus Arctic octopus
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:09.040]  is the biggest 10 feet long or little mini tiny ones they all live three years and three
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:13.880]  months and died no matter what interesting thing about that but the point is is that rats
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:19.040]  and rodents are the closest they've learned with whatever kills them kills us pigs are
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.000]  also very close to us the way things affect them something our genetics are similar just
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.480]  that our physiology how we operate remember the UT study of a coronavirus mRNA shot that
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:33.000]  Fauci tested with under Obama the national initiative at the University of Texas Galveston
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.400]  the rats lived half as long half as long as they normally they lived two years and change
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.840]  on average some died right away some died in two weeks some died in a month some died
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:46.720]  in three months but if you if you if you lay that over the data that's what we're seeing
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:51.080]  is a lot of death right up front but in the aggregate even more death over time later
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:55.360]  if you add all that death together it's much higher than right away it's not designed to
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.160]  kill you right away and make it obvious but they made it a little too strong it's a soft
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:03.760]  kill weapon and so we sit up here and talk about this all being confirmed and how we're
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:08.080]  vindicated that's why they want to shut us down that's why they weaponize the CIA against
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.760]  us that's why they lie about us everywhere and say things that are completely not true
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.240]  and just increase the lives of daily basis because they're all going to go to prison
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.440]  ladies and gentlemen when you see a hit piece or lies about us or lies about somebody else
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:25.000]  like Tucker Carlson that is an attempt to intimidate us and bully us and make us go
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.640]  away I've had the plaintiff's lawyers tell us point blank they said it on the news if
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:36.280]  Mr. Jones just goes off the air we'll leave him alone but we want him off the air and
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:43.280]  they told me that my lawyers are like well that was in you know private mediation you
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.240]  can't say that and I'm like well you're not supposed to say in a mediation go off the
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.920]  air we'll leave you alone but I didn't have to violate the mediation rules they said it
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:55.920]  on the damn air they said it in countless interviews and again it's all nakedly hidden
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:01.640]  of course these lawyers are just mercenaries being supported by the system and the media
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.280]  and the whole corrupt culture but don't they get this is going to hurt them as well no
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:11.960]  they don't they can't see two feet in front of their face and they don't see how they're
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.920]  being destroyed by all this at the same time so I actually feel sorry for these people
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:22.840]  but I feel more sorry for all of us being drug-owned long by their ignorance because
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:27.080]  I go on Twitter a lot and read the comments I go on YouTube and read the comments and
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:32.600]  you'll see a video of well I had the video I guess we could play it I was looking at
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:39.040]  this morning of the head of the US vaccine board saying yeah it looks like it's really
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:42.880]  hurting people and looks like we got lied to about this and this is a big scandal we
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.280]  should probably pull this and then about a third of the comments are like oh it's the
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.560]  anti-vaxxers they're all nuts what do they do listen to Alex Jones and I mean this is
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:59.280]  insurance company numbers these are real numbers these are MIT these are top universities top
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:06.640]  companies top organizations and it's the same numbers worldwide on average at two shots worldwide
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:12.080]  increase in death 13 percent well this top statistician just saying the clip we played
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:18.640]  averages 7 percent that's 14 he's finding 14 the other numbers I saw were 13 notice
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:23.080]  I just harped that 13 number all day long two shots 30 percent increase you take five
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:33.600]  shots 35 percent increase in death I mean what the hell this is insane and we're just
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:39.360]  marching into this Armageddon the full clips on info wars dot com but here's congressman
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:44.800]  massy one of the best probably the best congressman we've got other than like MTG but really truly
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.520]  nonpartisan talking about the fact the American people have woken up and they're down with
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:56.640]  this I mean if you think it's a coincidence I think you're a coincidence theorist it is
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.040]  it is no coincidence that the while we were debating these very measures the executive
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:07.360]  branch went into full retreat on this they're trying to they're actually trying to save
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:11.960]  I think the other side the aisle from taking a tough vote giving that saving some face
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:16.080]  so that they can vote against it because well the timing is not right and then there was
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:22.200]  the argument made tonight on this bill and the one preceding it that does something similar
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:28.800]  that we should wait until we have committees formed the American people cannot wait another
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:37.280]  week they cannot wait another day livelihoods have been ruined so many people have suffered
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:45.120]  because this has gone on too long the president said what was it the CBS 60 minutes months
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:52.040]  ago that the pandemic is over and now he's saying well we need just 60 more days 60 more
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.160]  days to pull this off now that you all have this idea that we should end it I think I'll
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:04.800]  end it and I need 60 days I would like to ask Mr. Larson the president these statement
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:10.760]  administrative policy says he needs 60 days he wants to honor his previous commitment to
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:17.280]  give at least 60 days notice prior to termination why does why is he then going to go 100 days
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:23.480]  from now to do it what's the haven't spoke to the president about that my guess is that
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:30.240]  since the national emergency order signed by the previous president was on March 13th
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:37.440]  2020 that about 60 days from March 13th is around May 11th and that'd be my only speculation
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:46.440]  I was so I'll give it a try I'm trying to I see that the things are going to expire
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:57.120]  on March 1st and April 11th so if he's going 60 days from April 11th April he goes on to
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:02.120]  say so no this is based on science you just feel like it no it's based on control and
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.440]  trying to continue to make the troops take it and trying to continue to make school children
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:11.520]  take it and medical workers and so many other industries and groups and it's about the national
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:17.960]  emergency authorizes Pfizer and Moderna to be putting this experimental shot out there
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.320]  and so they haven't yet gotten the FDA board to give it regular approval that's years out
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:28.080]  they'll never get it now they just want to inject as many boobs as many ignorant people
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.640]  as many victims I mean little children aren't idiots they're not boobs and so they're just
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:39.040]  trying to hit us right up into the bell with every punch to the gut and the chin and the
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:45.440]  head and the eye and the kidneys they can get and it's mass murder I'm gonna go to break
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:56.160]  Alberto Buck Brad John Obadi Bart Jason Peter clown car Kathy danger calls the order received
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:04.400]  straight ahead I talk a lot about the great successes info wars this had I don't think
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:10.640]  anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:16.400]  the crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have

[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:05.160]  for keeping us on the air leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:34.120]  it's Alex Jones you know when I was a little kid
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:40.520]  and they had this song on the radio was a hit song I thought it sounded cool but a little
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:45.000]  bit corny so anything about rising up to the challenge and starting on the streets and
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.040]  went all the way to the top it's still not giving up and what it's all about and I can
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:56.320]  tell you I can tell you 40 years later at 48 by 49 I totally understand what it's all
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:00.600]  about I gotta tell you I'm not fighting in risk of my life and going through all this
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:06.360]  hell because I want to be famous or I want to be Tom Brady or I want to be any of those
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:10.240]  people I'm doing it because we have to fight these people and we have to take them down
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:16.040]  if we have any future I wouldn't go a cup of coffee during the break and every time
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:21.640]  I go in there no matter what channel is on it's Tom Brady retiring now look I don't think
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:27.160]  it's Tom Brady I like he means a great football player the greatest ever the goat but I mean
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:31.000]  we've got we're on the verge of World War three we have millions dying from poison
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.960]  shots worldwide hundreds of thousands every few weeks getting maimed here in the US alone
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:42.280]  we have the insurance company and MIT numbers and and it's still not the focus or the media
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:49.400]  makes it the focus to care about Tom Brady I don't give a rat's petunia about Tom Brady
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:55.360]  in a situation like this and it's because more people know about Tom Brady than about
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:01.480]  poison shots or more people care about Tom Brady is why we're in this trouble while our
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:05.120]  industrial capacity shut down and I got a bunch of news on that but let's go to your
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:11.960]  phone calls right now Alberto in Nevada thank you so much for calling in on this Wednesday
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:16.560]  February 1st broadcast you want to talk about the massive escalation in Ukraine go ahead
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:27.240]  yes sir so I was calling about that I actually have suspicions of Russia actually working
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:34.200]  with Putin or not not Russia but rather the Ukraine working with Putin and I feel like
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:40.960]  there there's like serious money being you know handled there as far as I mean they're
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.880]  saying something like eight out of ten dollars going in get stolen a lot of it laundered
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:49.320]  back here but you're saying you think it's a deal between Putin and Zelensky to keep
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:53.480]  the war going and then basically pocket the money I I mean I would put anything past anybody
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:58.120]  these days and I think it's certainly our job the question we've been lied to so much
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.080]  people call that a conspiracy theory I'm not saying you're right I'm just saying you have
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:06.880]  a right to ask those questions and everybody should look at every angle yeah I mean that's
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:15.240]  that's a huge that's a huge incentive at least for per Putin to or not putting I keep confusing
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:21.880]  Zelensky with Vladimir Zelensky yes yes sir and I'm pretty sure they're they're they're
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:26.360]  doing something there well there's no doubt Zelensky has an incentive to set up a dictatorship
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:30.520]  in a new NATO base and then he is stealing amongst the money but I don't think the Russians
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:35.440]  in the Ukrainian leadership or buddy boys or pals I think this is a very very real war
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:39.960]  and extremely dangerous what do you think yeah I think that's that's absolutely true
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:45.240]  I mean no doubt about it I mean there's there's a there's casualties on both sides so there's
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:49.160]  definitely some sure I get what you're saying you're saying Zelensky's making money well
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.960]  there's no doubt you're right about that I appreciate your call Buck in Wisconsin thanks
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:24:00.240]  for calling hey mr. red pill what's up doc I wanted to first talk about a crucial point
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:06.320]  here about like how you were groundbreaking with releasing information about the Ukraine
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:12.240]  bio labs and how it's like a super Slavic genetic holocaust and I think it's important
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:19.760]  to focus on that because they're targeting that which is like a huge Christian contingent
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:25.800]  many European and American and other half genetic hapler groups around the world could
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:31.000]  also be affected and it's important to figure out with Mike Adams yeah I was about to say
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.600]  Mike Adams is really pioneered that it's been vindicated two years after he first broke
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:40.400]  the labs for what you're getting to is race specific bio weapons or bio weapons that
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:45.440]  are designed to only hit certain genetic groups and we know that is the very research that
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:50.280]  the Pentagon and others have been illegally conducting in Ukraine yeah that's one reason
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:56.000]  Putin says he went in was that and because Ukraine won a nuclear weapons Ukraine denied
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.920]  that Ukraine I started to start the show Ukraine now admits they've been seeking nuclear weapons
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:07.120]  that Putin told the truth yeah then with further with the Biden blunders in Ukraine you know
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:13.480]  thanks Biden for making drone air warfare and now with tank warfare with the Russian
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:20.240]  Terminator tank you know it has like a fully automated robotic turret has like two 30 millimeter
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:25.480]  cannons two automatic grenade launchers and two double rocket launchers and they shoot
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:31.520]  like depleted uranium rounds so it's like gonna mess up the soil and affect grain supplies
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:37.280]  I think those same grain supplies are affecting the chickens even you know with grain being
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:43.080]  sent from over there subpar grain and then the chickens have problem oh there's no doubt
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.120]  that the chicken feed has been adulterated and that chicken production is of eggs is
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:55.400]  way down it's not a theory it's directly causal scientists have looked at it and egg production
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:59.160]  I mean I've heard of noticing a year ago that eggs got smaller and smaller no matter what
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.200]  brand I was trying to buy so they've been feeding them less feed or the feed isn't as
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.680]  good and now folks have noticed that if they put one group of chickens outside and make
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:11.720]  them free range or make their own old-fashioned chicken feed the chickens are having eggs
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:15.480]  but if they're fed the chicken feed that always worked it doesn't work anymore so it just
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.880]  shows the total breakdown of civilization and society and that's what you know you're
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:24.400]  going to do to depression but groups are hiding it and they're all cutting corners basically
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:29.640]  I appreciate your call great points Brad and Pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:36.920]  hey thanks Alex to your point on the organic information that keeps flowing out about the
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:41.880]  shots I appreciate you pointing that out because it is a groundswell just keeps coming out like
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:46.200]  you said every day more and more and imagine being the people in the corporate media still
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:50.520]  defending it the executives are saying it's bad the board members the FDA are saying they got
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.920]  lied to they're all leaving the sinking ship but there are leftists still defending it
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:58.440]  along with Trump over on the other side being a jackass what do you make of that
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.720]  Trump's killing killing me man and you and everybody who backed him
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:08.280]  and he just and I think he took money didn't he Alex I think he took money from big pharma
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.600]  which I mean I mean he did take a million bucks for his campaign from Pfizer but it's true so
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:18.040]  there you go he's a money grubber I mean he always has been and so I mean I think it's bigger than
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:23.400]  that because both the other party got even more I was like five million for visor just for for
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:29.320]  for Biden and for Hillary before that it was even more he's pigheaded he doesn't want to admit
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:34.680]  he got bamboozled into the shot he just hopes it blows away he hopes it goes away no it's not
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:40.920]  going away Trump it's not going away yeah and I think he should step step aside he's already
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:46.520]  compromised there he's already he's got some baggage the republicans don't even want to back
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:52.440]  him when the election was clearly his and he's he's a little too old now he needs to step away
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:56.280]  yeah let me do this brad because you called in about globalists will watch world war three to
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:59.400]  cover tracks stay there don't hang up I want to come back to you because I don't want to cut your
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:03.480]  short but but I just I just had an idea here and I'm sure all of you've already thought this
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.960]  because sometimes I'm really ahead of the curve sometimes I'm like man you're dumb do you realize
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.520]  folks that it's only the democrats and the deep staters and socialists and communist parties
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:19.000]  and WEFers worldwide that are supporting the poison shots and covering up and Trump
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:25.160]  Bolsonaro came out against the shot two years ago DeSantis over a year ago and and I mean
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:30.280]  I mean and it's so sad because I still like Trump I don't think he's an evil person he
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:34.440]  the globalists hate me because I supported him they legitimately hate his guts he really was
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:37.720]  president he really was trying to call the shots but doesn't mean he's perfect
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:45.720]  this blind spot of where Trump now is aligned with all the mask heads and all the democrats
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:48.920]  you say well he wasn't for the mask he wasn't for shots it doesn't matter
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:55.160]  he is supporting the freaking things now saying they saved lives they didn't Trump is wrong
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.920]  we'll be right back stay with us
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:06.120]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars this had I don't think anybody can deny it and it is

[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:13.480]  to the very heights of politics not just in America but the world we are engaging the globalist
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:19.720]  at point-blank range in the information war but I don't deserve the credit yes I've persevered
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:25.720]  but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason we've had the success we're
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:31.720]  having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had we are now
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:38.360]  entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important than ever to

[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:20.120]  the new world order it's alex jones from the front lines of the information war it's alex
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:33.640]  jones i'm going through hell in the last seven years seven and a half years supporting trump and
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.400]  I don't screen your phone calls when we have a topic I want you to call about the topic
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:45.640]  and it was funny I was already about to speak out about trump today I looked at all the stacks I
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:50.120]  just said look I got other stuff to do I'm not gonna do it but now I am and then I'm gonna go back
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:55.160]  to the caller so you can make us Russia points Brad in Pennsylvania we'll do an overhead shot here
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:34:02.920]  here's just some of the history of it this is a trump in November of 2016 right after he was
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:09.880]  elected okay US president elect Donald Trump has said vaccines cause autism and he couldn't be more
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:14.200]  wrong so here they are demonizing him when he was right then he meets with bill gates a few months
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:24.040]  later bill gates trump super interested in universal flu vaccine that's m n r a
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:43.800]  m n r a m n r a and m n r a m r n n a having one of those one of those moments
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:52.520]  so frustrating here's another exclusive trump to order drive for improved flu vaccine so
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:59.880]  so first he's against it the word is bearing on hurt from it I'm confirmed that then he meets with
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:05.080]  bill gates and then he supports the universal flu vaccine right after he gets into office
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:11.080]  and then we get hit with what we got hit by all right let's go back to your calls Brad shifting
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:15.240]  gears to Russia for those that just joined us Ukraine may seek nuclear weapons if left out
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:20.360]  of NATO diplomat to prevent the next Ukraine we need to clarify the role of nuclear weapons
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:25.400]  of the hill Russia says real danger of Ukraine acquiring nuclear weapons required response
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:32.440]  that is how fast this situation is wildly escalating Brad make your points thank you for
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:38.440]  holding yeah thanks Alex my my feeling is they kind of converge these two issues with the all the
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.520]  all the negative information coming out against the deep state on the vaccines on the on the
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:50.040]  covid shots you can't they can't contain it so what what's a good smoke screen for them once that
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:57.880]  this builds up into a crescendo world war three so and we all know our government you know they've
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:02.200]  got bunkers underground they're ready to go I don't think they care about us I think they're
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:06.280]  we're expendable that's my feeling you pointed this out on one of your shows before you went on
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:11.640]  vacation last week they're they're ready to go underground and leave us out here to die that's my
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:19.560]  feeling I agree with you so how do we stop it we just keep pushing what you're doing that's why
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:25.000]  info wars is so important I mean you you're here for a reason at this point in time you and you
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.680]  know what you've been talking about it how you know but you the fact you've been you named your
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.760]  company free speech systems it's all brilliant everything info wars everything you've done
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:38.120]  is leading up to this point in time and and I can't thank you enough I've been following you for
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:42.520]  since right after 9-eleven and brother I can't thank you and never keep me on air it is you the
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:47.080]  listeners word of mouth prayer and by the great products it keeps us here so I'm in your hands
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:52.120]  you're in my hands let's let's let's let's fight together god bless you powerful points obadiah
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:58.520]  in Las Vegas says no way out of world war three and we are on the wrong side give us your view
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.960]  yeah obviously we're on the wrong side Sodom and Gomorrah don't have a thing on the west
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:10.120]  this civilization and over there in Russia they're invoking the power of god saying that
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:16.600]  they're fighting anti christ stateness and they're ready to die you know what I mean they're on
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:20.920]  there on their nightly news they're ready to die and they say what's a world without Russia
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:28.760]  so nuclear war is going to happen and I mean with with the way that are with the way that this
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:36.280]  government runs they'd be the ones to drop the bomb on us and blame it on Russia oh I agree with
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:42.280]  you will it be a cyber attack or will it be a false flag nuclear attack in fact in my deep
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:47.400]  research the last month taken off time to really sit in a room at a desk for sometimes five hours
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:54.360]  at a time with just a glass of ice water or iced tea that's my main analysis is everything
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:59.320]  they're setting up is for martial law and one way or another they want to go to full war to knock
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:05.640]  out civilization above ground and then re-emerge with their new technocracy and so that's why I've
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:12.760]  just got it I don't even say I'm even angry now I'm very sad and then very frustrated that so many
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.000]  people that have gone along with this are not cared or not been involved are destroying their own
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:23.240]  future by not stopping this does that make sense yeah it does and I mean I think the best thing
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:27.960]  that you can do is get people prepared for nuclear war because you got a bunch of people who claim to
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:33.080]  believe in the bible and our churchgoers but they're just playing religion they're just playing
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:37.080]  churchianity they think that they're going to get raptured out of here and that we're not going to
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:43.880]  go through the tribulation john nelson darby and cyrus gofield were con artists it was just a big
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:49.640]  scam to get people to go a long way what they were pushing there's some of the still filled bible
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:53.880]  and that and there's a pre-tribulation and so many christians who are good people get mad at me
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:58.120]  and say I'm bad like I don't plan to be the most holy person I don't plan to have all the answers
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:03.240]  but anybody can read revelation the anti christ rages war on the saints overcomes them for a
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:08.760]  short time then you have armageddon christ returns the archangel bound satan there's a thousand-year
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:15.800]  reign and they let satan out again I mean a five-year-old can read that after christ defeat satan at
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:21.960]  the battle of armageddon the dead in christ arisen so they have all these major tv movies
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:26.360]  about oh the airplanes fall in the sky because the pilot disappears and we all get beamed up
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:32.200]  like a star trek episode that's not in the bible but so many christians are scared even though the
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:37.000]  mark of the beast is here and world governments here and transmutations and all the genetic
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.960]  engineered kameer is here and the human clones and all of that is here everything's being fulfilled
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:46.360]  world governments being fulfilled and they're like oh well just praise god it means the world's
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:49.400]  about to end but they don't understand they're gonna have to go through this but they'll be in
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:56.440]  denial the whole time bowling down to anti christ exactly or they'll be able to or to be real easy
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:02.360]  to fall for the the whatever that blue project blue beam project oh they're definitely priming
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:08.040]  things for a fake alien invasion right and the other thing man and i'm saying this from a point of
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:16.520]  love i i'm a big time supporter got reset wars got the coins that i agreed with i'm i got i'm
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:24.440]  pumped up on my 1776 testosterone boost nitric boost thank you but but about eight to ten months
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:30.840]  ago you said that you're giving donald trump three months to come out against the vaccine
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:37.960]  not only has he not come out against the vaccine but he told you to stop to stop supporting him
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:43.880]  and that he's on the side of the vaccine so where is this jihad that you spoke of because there's
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:50.280]  babies out here dying now new obadiah obadiah i think you're absolutely right um and i think
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:56.840]  you're saying is true i mean but i just criticized trump and said i'm disgusted by it and that and
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:02.200]  that it's terrible that he basically is with the democrats and the deep state only shot so i i i
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:07.400]  i think i should go further and i think you're right the question is how do i do that but i i think
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:12.760]  in fairness what did i just do before i went to your call yeah yeah you did but i mean at
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:17.960]  at the end of it you said you still like trump well i mean i don't think i don't think he's
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:22.440]  i don't think he's consciously part of it and okay well then you're you're on the air uncensored
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:27.480]  obadiah what what should i what what what do we do just i mean i'm i mean i've already said i'm
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:31.080]  pissed at trump i've already i mean i'm here saying it's terrible every day i mentioned what he's
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:37.400]  doing is wrong yeah you start calling for that floor to be hung tried and hung because what he did is
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:43.640]  commit war crimes and just because he doesn't consciously do it that and that's even up for
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:50.360]  debate because his mentor was roi kong people need to do the research into roi kong he was the
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:56.280]  he was the jeffrey ebbstein of the boy listen i hear you that it's getting very concerning about
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:00.360]  trump i'm not gonna call for trump to be killed a i think that would not be a good thing and then
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:05.720]  we got to get put in jail uh but but but let's just pull back from this that's why i said tried
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:11.480]  that's why i said tried convicted and then hung because if if i went out and i was drinking and
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:19.320]  driving like an idiot and i killed some people on accident would i still go to prison no you're
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:24.840]  out you go to jail for manslaughter i appreciate your call look we open the phones up you got a
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:30.760]  hunger to speak out against trump knock yourself out i mean i agree with you not about executing trump
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:35.000]  uh i i really went to bat for trump he did a lot i mean look he's coming out against world war
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.400]  three right now i get that clip ready from like saturday guys i'm going to play it i didn't see it
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.200]  my stack but i said it to you trump says we gotta stop world war three who else is saying that i mean
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:47.720]  so it's it's kind of a balance here and that's why i'm not throwing the baby completely out of the
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:52.200]  bathwater i'm criticizing you know i'm set it's terrible but he's done so much other good stuff
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:56.680]  i'm saying he's not the biggest fish to fry okay like bill gates is
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:05.800]  why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing info wars attacking myself and the

[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:06.600]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:22.680]  i'm going to criticize trump where he's wrong but when he supports good policies like
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:27.960]  stopping transgenderism mutilation of our children or trying to defend our borders or
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:35.240]  trying to stop world war three i'm going to support him but i am very upset with
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:39.960]  trump and i've made all that absolutely clear i'm just not making him the enemy or who we
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:44.760]  should go after it's bill gates it's claus schwaab it's barack obama it's their controllers
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:51.160]  and but i'm rapidly as i said i would pulling away from trump because of this and i've been
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:55.880]  very clear about that it doesn't mean i completely trust his sanity either with some of his background
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:01.000]  so i'm not into a lesser of two evils things i'm just saying are you gonna vote for the democrat
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:08.760]  nominee in the year and a half 2024 i mean seriously guys that's what i'm talking about here
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:14.200]  so i'm a purist when it comes to ideas of liberty i'm just being completely honest here
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:20.280]  here's trump on world war three through weakness and incompetence joe biden has brought us to the
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:25.560]  brink of world war three we're at the brink of world war three just in case anybody doesn't know it
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:31.240]  but as president i will bring back peace through strength peace through strength what had never
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:38.520]  happened if i was president there would not have been a war with russia in ukraine zero chance
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:42.520]  that lindsay would be happy with that that's better than any alternative wouldn't have happened
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:48.680]  and i will say this even now despite tremendous loss of lives and destruction of much of that
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:54.440]  country i would have a peace deal negotiated within 24 hours you could make a peace deal you could
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:49:01.800]  make a deal for both right now 24 so again i'm not endorsing tromb on the boys and shots i'm

[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:49.320]  yes sir alex add war crimes to a long list of a of offenses by joe biden this is an attempt to kill
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:55.560]  our old our young men because the average gi is probably about 19 years old what do you think alex
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:01.960]  i agree with you they're hitting our troops with them it debilitates them makes them sick
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:06.760]  and kicks the smartest ones out by attrition that's what the critical race theory all of
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:12.680]  it's about is purging the military there's no doubt they did it and i i feel they prefer your
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:17.720]  typical meat grinder like vietnam as opposed to nuclear war so that we won't notice
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:25.400]  i agree with you let me ask you this is where the subject of trump what do we do about trump
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:30.600]  should i make him my main focus or my instinct is criticizing be upset with him let him learn
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:36.120]  how he's destroying his base he's almost making himself obsolete and redundant and vestigial
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:42.120]  is what i see i think it's time to declare political war on trump he has betrayed us these
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:47.640]  vaccines are killing our young people and our old people you know i'm going to do open phones
[01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:53.720]  in the next few days i'm in fact i'm going to do tomorrow night a commercial free show six
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:53:00.600]  p.m after oh and show ends for two hours on the subject of trump and what we do with him
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:05.880]  because the callers want it i want it too i just i'm such a loyal person you know i'm critical of
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:12.360]  him i just it's so sad that he's destroying himself like this uh and is he blackmailed
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:19.400]  what do you think is happening i don't know alex but this blood is all over his red tie
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:27.240]  well said thank you mark jason in the great state of texas go ahead sir howdy alex yes sir
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:33.640]  so yeah i kind of agree with the first caller i forget his name but uh i kind of had the same
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:38.360]  feeling about that i think uh what's his name's linds he's kind of playing like a double agent
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:43.160]  type thing here i mean he goes and asks this idiot for money all the time and he gives it to him
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:47.000]  you know and then who knows what the hell they're doing with it and then rushes making record
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.760]  profits on oil rushes doing great during all this exactly so i think he i think he is playing
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:57.800]  us both or you know playing both both hands here but uh yeah forget the caller's name and he was a
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:03.560]  caller from vegas yeah yeah it's not gonna be good though i think they're luring us in with this
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:09.480]  kind of phony bs here with this russia crap and then we can't see the fox in the handhound and
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:14.520]  we're gonna have china we're gonna have iran north kree all these people coming in from the back
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:21.080]  because if you didn't notice uh iran is sending warships they're hitting brazil i did notice
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:26.920]  that you notice israel just bombed iran this weekend exactly we're gonna be in oh man it's
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:34.280]  not gonna be good so get ready people and also when the power goes out make sure you're fully
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:39.000]  stocked and don't be going to know heating or cooling center either because that's gonna be the
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.240]  end for you there too like they have a germany oh sorry you don't have power anymore but come to
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:47.560]  the heating center the government building has power i mean they're just domesticating us and
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:53.480]  by the way we're on that in austin the power's out all around us red lights are out we've still got
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:58.680]  power and we got a generator in case it goes out but this is the new normal thank you jason
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:04.200]  let's talk to peter in washington thanks for holding go ahead thanks alex you're the tip of
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:10.040]  the spear in the info war and the tip of the wef's attack on the on the american public and the
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:15.960]  free people to the west has been the vaccine the way you determine how to just stop uh world war
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:22.600]  three and find who the allies are is find who opposed the covid vaccines the lockdowns the
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:28.360]  mandates and who were the first people to clue in that they were such a tremendous danger if you
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:34.120]  find those people you'll find the people who aren't on the wef uh controlled and by the way
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:37.800]  that's what the globalists did it was to find out who's on board with them i agree absolutely
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:44.680]  a threat is a gift they've shown us through their actions that they are a danger the key thing about
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:53.320]  trump is he is the luke warm on this issue and he should be spat out if you're going to stop war
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:57.160]  three you're going to number one reason you're going to do is because you care about children
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:01.800]  if you don't care about the children dying right now from the vaccine you are the luke warm
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:08.840]  and there is no ground there is no space for a person who will not oppose the vaccine and
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:16.440]  then claim they're going to stop war three i really believe that if we ally with the free
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.640]  peoples of the world like the indians who oppose the vaccine the japanese who recognize the danger
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:29.640]  of the vaccine if we pair with those people we can find a way to lower the temperature in russia
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:34.760]  and in the ukraine now i agree that's why i always talk about the poison shot with war
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:39.000]  it's all a globalist agenda i agree we've got a good chance of stopping this i mean the globalists
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.600]  are upset people are waking up faster than they thought look at all these different government
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:46.280]  board members and people going public all over the world saying oh we were wrong it's deadly
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:51.080]  they know they're about to go to jail bill gates and people like albert borla they think they're
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:58.440]  protected but their minions are blinking because most of them weren't read it on the full thing
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:04.600]  now they can see it's a setup and that's a threat that everyone should take and take to the
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:10.200]  bank that we need to resist the calls for greater war and i think the key is they're not interested
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:15.960]  in a nuclear war they're interested in creating fertile ground for a false flag nuke because if
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:20.840]  they get that false flag nuke in the west they can do all the tyranny that they get in australia
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:24.920]  and they get in new zealand in the united states and they can bring it in permanently that's what
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:30.680]  the deep state wants a giant cyber attack and or nuclear attack that's a false flag i think that's
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:35.960]  a consensus of the audience i agree with you that's what i was planning to present really tomorrow
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:39.240]  night i wasn't tonight but everything's high stuff should limit the crib at tomorrow night
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:45.480]  six o'clock we're talking about false flags more and trump all right thank you peters clown car

[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:49.720]  should have fulfilled the stuff he said he was going to do the first time during the swamp locker
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:55.800]  up build the wall love set now i would want a translator out there in russian and maybe one
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:02.600]  in chinese to repeat what i say right now because i think we need a good solid fight so it's time for
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:08.760]  a war alex uh i hate to say it but there's not going to be any peace unless there is a war i mean
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:14.840]  people are so complicit in their everyday conveniences they they just comply oh listen you just
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:19.480]  got to wear a mask but you could still get the food all right i'll do it oh you can still go to

[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:35.240]  like you said we're being sucker punched with so many different combinations hey look we're going
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:41.160]  to war oh my god this is naked people dancing in the library you know like it's it's like you're
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:45.720]  getting hit left and right to the point you don't even know what's up what's down anymore we need a
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:53.240]  good war that's what we need so i think that if we do it the way that they plan which is either
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:59.000]  nuclear war or this you know shutting down the grid and most of us are prepared i think the good
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:05.640]  10th percent alex is actually the info warriors no i agree that's why they hate this broadcast
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:10.360]  they hate you they hate that we've organized a group of people that know the truth you know it's
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:15.160]  funny i as an info warrior alex i thought it was kind of funny how they tried to make you look bad
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:19.400]  and that's how you know who was really bullying you by the way they tried to make you look bad
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:24.360]  and they said he sends naked pictures to alex stone like that was really gonna offend us as
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:30.040]  info warriors like really you know and it wasn't even a naked picture it was my wife in a bikini
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:36.440]  exactly so you know any other thing about the 35 percent of people that are you know dying from
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:41.560]  the thing so if they showed the states and they could show it state by state and they'd be able
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:47.800]  to show which is a red and blue state so they actually did target people and what's scary is the
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:53.080]  more they lie they don't stop they just double down with more lies it's getting crazy and and not
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:57.640]  only that but i know i'm i don't know if you'd say rats because it's easier for people to comprehend
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:03.480]  but i believe it was ferrets that they tested on and every one of them 100% all died yeah every
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:07.960]  once they were released out into the public and real quick um tattoos when you have a heart attack
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:14.120]  do they disappear no well because the guy who they show who said you know oh i'm gonna thank

[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:46.040]  they're hiding where he's at but i'm saying we've been lied to so much it's completely reasonable

[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:48.840]  tyranny this is the folks so you wanted to come on issue an emergency warning we're glad we got him
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:54.520]  as a guest on a concon which is article five and on the latest globalist threat the oncoming
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:59.320]  anti-police onslaught the north american union and more i'm gonna do my best here we cover these
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:06.360]  subjects try to give them the floor to run through this but christian that's gotta blow you away to
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:12.360]  see a attorney general that they're trying to confirm into a high level uh power and judgeship
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:19.000]  of the federal government not knowing basic stuff that you know 30 40 years ago a ninth grader would
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:24.120]  know uh i know i was taught that in school the news i had to look some of it up to remember all of it
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:28.920]  but they don't know when war is supposed to be cleared any of it what do you make of this
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:37.560]  well uh alex thank you for having me on of course uh it's clearly a plot to destroy the republic as
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:42.760]  we say by putting people in power who can be as you said earlier and the sort of the segment
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:47.080]  easily manipulated to doing the bidding of those who are really in power because you have people
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:50.680]  who don't know what they're talking about they don't know the constitution and they're expected
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:56.840]  to rule on matters that are pertinent to the constitution uh this is a recipe for disaster
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:03.880]  and it's intentional and we know that's from the left putting in complete completely ignorant
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:08.600]  people but it seems from the right we have a lot of movements to undermine things posing as
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:14.360]  conservative or populist or constitution so let's dive into the great articles and reports
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:18.120]  you guys have been warning about for a long time it's really coming to a head now and some of the
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:22.840]  groups behind an article five constitutional convention why don't you explain that to people
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:30.840]  mr. Gomez yeah so uh to answer the question posed by senator john kennedy to the woman being
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:35.960]  potentially confirmed to the uh to the courts what is article five well article five is simply
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:40.760]  the amendment article of the constitution it's the article that explains procedure for how the
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:45.480]  constitution can be amended or changed and there's two methods really to amend the constitution
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:50.840]  according to article five the first method the one that's been used for all the current 27 amendments
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:54.920]  that are part of the constitution including the bill of rights the first 10 is when two-thirds of
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:11:00.520]  the house of representatives and tutors of the us senate uh propose the amendment pass it then it
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:05.800]  goes to the states and three-fourths of the state's ratify it and uh the second method that's never
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:12.600]  been used is when the congress calls the convention on the application of uh three-fourths of i'm
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:18.840]  sorry of two-thirds of the state so 34 states apply for convention 34 out of 52 thirds and then
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:24.600]  congress calls the convention um and then at the convention delegates they are me delegates who
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:31.000]  represent the sovereign will of the people at large propose amendments to the constitution uh except
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:37.560]  if they if they only do propose amendments and they limit themselves to only that action then of
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:41.720]  course they can continue with the article five procedure of having three-fourths of the state's
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:48.920]  ratify it but at that convention they could also seize the opportunity to write a whole new constitution
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:54.840]  or as we see all the time in congress they add an amendment to a bill and the amendment guts the
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:12:00.920]  text of the of the the original text of the bill so one amendment can totally alter the constitution
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:05.000]  and whether it's a few words in the second amendment saying something to the effect of uh
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:10.120]  that right the right to bear arms to not be infringed while serving in the in the national
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:14.120]  guard or in the military i mean they could put a couple words there and totally alter the meeting
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:21.240]  or they can um just gut whole amendments entirely and propose new amendments that empower the federal
[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:26.280]  government to do things that it currently doesn't do and so that's from from the time of mr welch and
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:32.120]  your founding you guys have always warned of this and just as you warned now there are powerful groups
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:36.440]  trying to position this as a way to defeat the globalists on the left but you guys have warned
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:43.640]  it's a trojan horse yes yes uh back in the 1970s and 80s of course the big push was for a balanced
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:51.160]  budget amendment and by 1982 uh there were 32 states that had uh live applications for a constitutional
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:56.520]  convention ostensibly for the purpose to introduce a or propose a balanced budget amendment of the
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:01.400]  constitution and we uh sounded the alarm then started it started to fill a shaft with eagle form
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:07.560]  they were also uh vocal at the time so together uh we sounded the alarm and uh we got a lot of
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:11.960]  rescission resolutions passed at the state legislature and what a rescission is is it's a
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:18.120]  resolution the state passes that basically revokes their previous application for the convention
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:23.080]  and we got the number down and now there's new groups that have emerged in the battle
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:28.760]  uh in 2013 uh mark mechler of the convention i'm sorry mark mechler of tea party patriots
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:33.080]  started the convention of states project which has been the leading uh organization
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:40.840]  proposing or proposing to legislators that they should apply for a convention uh and there's
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:46.040]  other groups too on the left like wolf pack but but c os convention of states is the largest what
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:51.400]  most well-funded organization that gets celebrity uh endorsements and so forth that's really pushing
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:55.880]  this but if you listen to what mark mechler says about the convention uh he uses a lot of false
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:00.040]  premises he says things that are inaccurate about the convention and most people don't know about
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:05.880]  article five or they know very little and they go with what he says and they end up passing these
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:11.880]  resolutions so the john berg society is active uh across the country in legislatures with our
[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:18.680]  members testifying in front of committees to either stop uh the the passage of these resolutions
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:23.640]  that apply to congress for the convention and we also have um members working on convincing
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:28.760]  your state legislators to introduce resolutions to rescind their state's past applications
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:33.400]  and i want to talk about that but if it's in the constitution and we're constitutionalist
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:38.120]  there's a place for it what is the place for it and why are you guys so concerned about this i
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:42.040]  agree with you that from the left and the right some of these globalist forces are always pushing it
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:48.040]  i think the argument is we need to enforce the constitution and the bill of rights we don't need
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:54.040]  to rewrite it or have new rules because we already haven't it's not being enforced so enforce the
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:58.840]  laws that are there why would we put ourselves in this big emergency where god knows what's
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:04.120]  going to happen once we're in that position yeah absolutely you asked a really good question like
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:08.680]  why why why is article five it's part of the constitution so could it really be that bad
[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:15.000]  yeah and that's a valid question um the founding fathers included um article five the whole article
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.320]  five whether you're proposing the amendments out of congress or via a convention they entered
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:24.200]  they added that in the constitution specifically for the correction of errors you can read um
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:29.480]  um federalist papers and notes from the convention and they refer to the purpose of the amendment
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:36.760]  procedure as a way to to fix any errors or defects should they be found that's an at the time clause
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:41.560]  that was vestigial we left uh i mean because it's the same thing with twitter now lets you amend a
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:48.200]  bad tweet for 30 minutes so you're saying it was kind of vestigial uh yeah an example a perfect
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:53.000]  example of an error or defect but the constitutional was that when the constitution hold on tell us
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:58.120]  i'm not only come back this is important

[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:05.560]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:22.280]  an article five constitutional convention is being advertised by the left and right as the
[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:27.640]  answer to all our problems they don't follow the constitution to begin with so why should
[02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:34.520]  we create a concon when we have all the tools we need christian gum as is a researcher and
[02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:39.720]  author and host at jbs.org and he's been raising the alarm about this we're getting to an example
[02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:42.760]  before we hit the break that i want to shift gears into the next big globalist assault
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:46.920]  they've taken over the district attorney's almost every town and city of any size
[02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:50.600]  now they want to control the police we'll talk about that key piece of this in a moment
[02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:54.760]  the jbs.org has been worrying about for decades and decades and decades please continue
[02:20:56.360 --> 02:21:03.080]  yes so before the break you asked uh in part part of the question was uh why was the article five
[02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:08.040]  added to the constitution specifically the convention clause and the founders included
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:11.800]  the amendment procedure in the constitution placed there was a flaw or defect and a perfect
[02:21:11.800 --> 02:21:17.160]  example of there being a flaw or defect in the constitution was that after the constitution came
[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:21.480]  out of the convention there was no bill of rights there was no guarantee for the unalienable rights
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:26.200]  of americans and this was a huge debate uh at the time in fact when the state of new york
[02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:31.720]  ratified the u.s constitution there were those who did not want to ratify the constitution
[02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:37.160]  and part of their objection was the lack of protection on our individual god given rights
[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:42.360]  they did pass that new york state did ratify the constitution but then they also applied
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:48.520]  for a convention right away under article five a convention of deputies from the several states
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:53.080]  as they called it so they wanted a convention of deputies under article five to amend the
[02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:58.280]  constitution and they in their application resolution that new york state passed back
[02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:05.000]  at the time they said that they that the purpose was to protect the unalienable rights of of
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:09.560]  the american people essentially so what they wanted was a bill of rights and of course congress
[02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:14.520]  uh james maneson actually warned in a letter to toberville um that was written at the time he
[02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:20.120]  warned against her being another second general convention especially through the article five
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:25.480]  process because he warned that he would bring out the partisans of both sides it would be
[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:29.960]  highly contentious and he was uh concerned about what what the results of such a convention would
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:37.080]  be so congress in its wisdom did pass uh they proposed 12 amendments and 10 of those uh became
[02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:42.040]  the the first 10 the bill of rights uh because those were needed protections and i think we could
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:45.880]  all agree the second amendment uh were better off with it than without it because the left
[02:22:45.880 --> 02:22:50.840]  today wants to get rid of the second amendment they could get rid of it in a in a in a regular con
[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:59.800]  con or or an article five yes the uh uh yes uh that is something that very well could happen at
[02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:04.120]  an article five convention of course mark mechler and those on the right who advocate for the
[02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:08.760]  convention they say well you name me the three the three fourths of the states that would ratify
[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:14.280]  that but here's the thing three fourths of the states is no guarantee for the prevention of
[02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:18.760]  bad amendments to be ratified to the constitution but plus it's all in the constitution militarized
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:23.400]  declaration of independence what is mechler what do they want out of a concon because we already
[02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:29.000]  have all the stuff is just ignoring it yeah well it's uh if you look at mechler's application he
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:34.200]  he says he wants term limits they want fiscal restraint amendments and and these things that sound
[02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:38.520]  good and of course as we've written in plenty articles on the new american dot com and on the
[02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:43.160]  jbs.org as well we've discussed how some of these amendments are really just short-sighted band date
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:48.360]  sort of band-age amendments that really would not fix the problem like term limits for example
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:52.600]  it sounds positive but at the end of the day if you had term limits that also gets rid of the
[02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:57.800]  good congressman too and it never deals with the actual source of the problem which is a lack of
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:01.560]  education both from the part of those elected to congress and those on the part of the voters
[02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:05.080]  okay so let's get close though because you got some other big topics to it and i totally agree with
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:10.040]  you let's talk about the war on police police aren't perfect they're people but but when you
[02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:13.720]  got zord soros the whole deep state going after police what's really going on there
[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:20.120]  well we know that the the globalists um have been wanting to have a national police force
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:24.040]  in the united states and if you look at the police forces around the world whether it's
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:30.040]  mexico germany many countries they don't have local autonomous local police departments so
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:35.720]  with with regards to the use of this incident that's that's happened in memphis and the tragic
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:41.640]  killing of this uh uh tirade this individual there this is an opportunity that's being exploited
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:47.240]  by those who already have an end goal in mind which is of course a national police force because
[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:53.800]  when you have a national police force it makes it easier to enforce the dictates of the central
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:59.560]  government if you will the national government um because you would have police force police members
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:02.200]  who could come from different states or different cities and who don't know who don't
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:07.000]  have standardized as long as they're globalist police following globalist orders they can kill
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:10.760]  whoever they want do bad things will never be prosecuted the media will never attack them
[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:17.000]  i remember back in the late 60s the john bursa society copied uh the the the the memorandum
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:25.080]  and put out pamphlets of uh the national uh regulation 7277 where the federal government
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:29.560]  admitted they were to get rid of local police and create a federal police under the un so this
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:34.200]  has been something they've been trying for a long time yeah absolutely the united nations
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:39.560]  goal has been to disarm nations since the very beginning uh you go back to the baruch plan which
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:45.240]  was a plan to give the un the u s atomic bomb and of course all these various un uh treaties on
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:50.440]  firearms they want to the end goal for the un is to make sure that the population globally
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:55.640]  is disarmed and the us with the second amendment is a huge obstacle in that regard look at australia
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:00.600]  as you've talked about a lot in your program in the past uh they have uh they don't have the right
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:05.960]  to bear arms their weapons their ability to freely own a firearm did no longer exist in that country
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:10.440]  and once they do that here in the us if if they ever accomplish that which i don't see that happening
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:14.760]  because the american people are not gonna willingly surrender their firearms but if
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:20.200]  if they did accomplish that hypothetically then what would stop the un from imposing a tyrannical
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:26.120]  system look at katanga look at un peacekeepers and what they do in in africa and hady and even
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:30.440]  in south america where un forces are deployed and how they rape innocent defenseless people
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:37.320]  and that's the plan it's on screen freedom from war the united states program for general
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:41.640]  complete disarmament of peaceful world first you disarm the people then the police then you have
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:45.960]  a federal police force under the un and who criticizes our police who criticizes our border
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:52.680]  patrol the un and the democrats bring them in to oversee operations so people laugh at this but
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:57.800]  look how we're already under the wef and the un control the pandemic response they brag about it
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:04.360]  so we're already here yeah absolutely and of course you mentioned who would protect our
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:09.640]  borders well part of the plan right now uh that the globalists are pushing is to eliminate the
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:14.280]  borders of the u.s with mexico and the u.s of canada through a north american union of course
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:19.320]  they may not be calling it a north american union but that is the objective they they won a european
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:24.840]  union style arrangement here in north america and for all of the americas and i'm not just talking
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:30.520]  about what former mexican president besente fox said numerous times on january 10th uh just a few
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:37.640]  weeks ago uh biden uh just in chudeau of canada and president um manuel lopez um obrador uh
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:42.440]  met in mexico's city for the north american leader's summit and at that summit they released the
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:48.200]  declaration of north america but there are various uh key things that the president of mexico uh
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:54.040]  president um and this manuel lopez lopez obrador said he's very open about the fact that they want
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:28:01.080]  a um a union for for the americas well security union a few months ago he said let's just merge
[02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:09.240]  our countries yes in fact out when before biden arrived on january 9th president obrador tweed
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:13.640]  this tweet is in spanish and i can read spanish and of course there's also google extensions
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:18.680]  where you can translate it but in english his tweet read welcome home president biden you are
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:23.160]  our friend and so are the american people together we can promote a new stage in the
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:28.920]  nations of the continent based on mutual respect and assistance there are unbeatable conditions
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:35.480]  to consolidate the integration of the americas and he said other quotes like that too uh the
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:41.160]  following day in his own speech obrador said uh as a matter of priority we address the economic
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:48.040]  and commercial integration as as i have already expressed of the entire american continent um
[02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:59.160]  in fact obrador suggested that there hold on stay there let's come back this is key we'll be right back
[02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:05.000]  i talk a lot about the great successes info wars this hand i don't think anybody can deny it and it

[02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:28.520]  state department i'm not just spouting stuff off to act smart the same agenda since the end of world
[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:33.240]  war two by these globalists is being put forward over and over again and there were a bunch of
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:38.440]  patriots in the late 50s early 60s that saw this they weren't right wing they weren't left wing
[02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:43.240]  they were americans they were academics they were veterans they were former intelligence people
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:46.760]  they were they were they were they were patriots and they saw it and they fought back that's why
[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:51.560]  i've said i'm not a member of the john bert society but i wouldn't know what i knew i wouldn't have
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:56.440]  been where i've gone my dad wouldn't have been awake my my that's on my dad's side of the family
[02:33:56.440 --> 02:34:03.320]  my uncle my mother's brother wouldn't have been awake because he was in army special operations
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:09.160]  and i ran contra and as an officer and he saw what was going on because he knew about the john
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:13.720]  bert society and and it read their writings and if you don't have this knowledge folks nothing
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:19.800]  makes sense and i've talked to generals and i've talked to full bird kernels i've talked to
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:23.800]  former deputy heads of major agencies i've talked to heads of agencies like general flinn
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:30.840]  and they all recognize the john bert society trailblazed where we are you know going back just
[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:34.520]  a few minutes from the john bert society i want to hit this final point on the north american union
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:38.440]  they were already getting into christian gomez researcher and author at jbs.org
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:45.720]  what would america in the world be like without mr welch and without the john bert society and
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:50.200]  you might tell folks where the name comes from so you get a little idea this goes back to china and
[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:54.600]  kind of where we are today because the past is the present those that know no history do repeat it
[02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:59.480]  because the past is a continuum of where we're at people think of the past is some boring thing no
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:01.880]  you know the past understand the present and the future
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:09.080]  yeah so actually john birch has a connection to uh to your home state of texas because he was um
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:13.560]  when he was trained to be a missionary he was originally a missionary he was under the
[02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:19.560]  pastorship of j frank norris the nana pennant baptist pastor in dallas texas and he was sent
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:23.640]  under his authority to go to china to be a missionary to spread the gospel of salvation
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:29.160]  through jesus christ to the chinese people while he was there world war two broke actually the
[02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:35.640]  japanese were already at war with mainland against the mainland chinese and when the u s entered the
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:43.880]  war on the u s entered china to help the chinese to fight off the japanese invaders um uh john birch
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:48.920]  who was already doing mission work behind enemy lines in the japanese occupied part of china
[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:53.320]  he was there when colonel du little and his raiders flew off an american aircraft carrier
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:57.480]  and they didn't have enough fuel to turn back because they had to leave uh the carrier earlier
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:02.360]  because the japanese had spotted the carrier group so after they raided tokyo with the with the
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:08.360]  bombing there they crash landed in japanese occupied um china du little and his uh and the
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:13.800]  other pilots of the other bombers and it was john birch who helped rescue du little and his men
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:21.080]  out of japanese occupied uh the chinese japanese occupied china into the american uh area that
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:26.120]  was you know controlled by by the americans and allied forces so that took the that got the
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:29.880]  attention of the u.s military and said hey we really have it we already have a chaplain but
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:36.360]  we could use you as an intelligence officer um he wasn't officially part of the os s but he did
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:40.920]  work with them in being an intelligence officer because they need the language and the lay of
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:46.520]  the land there in china um however right after the war officially ended a few days later he was
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:50.840]  sent on a mission with some nationalist chinese forces and some korean forces who were fighting
[02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:56.520]  with the chinese against the japanese and they were they were stopped by chinese communists
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:37:03.400]  and uh they executed uh john birch uh and he was the first casualty of world war three of the cold
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:11.640]  war the war against the war of freedom versus communism and uh the u.s state department covered
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:18.200]  it up they said that he had died prior to the ending of hostilities with japan output his john
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:22.680]  birch's parents and georgia received the letter that he from him written after the day he supposedly
[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:27.720]  had died and that led them on a trail with the help of robert welch to uncover the truth and so
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:33.400]  robert welch when he learned this story named the john birch society after the first victim of of
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:39.160]  communism which goes back to the original treason ticking out shank high shack and put in the
[02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:45.480]  communists in command by 49 and the whole new world order system today yes i i recommend that all
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:50.760]  re of your viewers uh get the book uh may god forgive us by robert welch about what happened
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:54.360]  in china but let's talk about robert welch what a genius i wish he was here with us today
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:59.640]  people think alex jones is tomorrow is today well that's just because i read what welch
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:07.640]  was gonna happen this guy was a genius yes uh uh he he was uh he graduated college at a very young
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:15.720]  age and he started the john birch society in in 1958 to expose the the globalist new world order um
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:21.320]  the the movement for a one world government uh back in back in 58 when nobody else was talking
[02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:27.480]  about this about this topic about the threat of the united nations most americans in 1958
[02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:31.640]  i just thought that the un was a great way to prevent another war of course since the un's
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:36.360]  founding we've had we've seen nothing but perpetual warfare and robert welch warned about
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:43.080]  the federal reserve as well and uh and the the move towards uh well we already had fiat currency
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:47.320]  at the time but he even warned against not not having a gold standard richard nixon we know
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:51.480]  he was a great businessman and industrialist everything but how do you have such forward
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:59.000]  looking understanding of things well um robert welch was of course very intelligent he was also
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:04.040]  very well connected probably in part from the business uh aspect of as a candy maker he knew a
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:08.680]  lot of uh uh people but he was friends with uh senator joe mccarthy there's a photo actually
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:15.320]  down the hallway of robert welch with joe mccarthy in 1957 um prior to the founding of of the john
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:22.040]  birch society so they were really close so after joe mccarthy is um uh after his passing sadly uh
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:27.720]  jbs came on the scene to continue the work of exposing the communist and globalist infiltration
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:33.240]  of our of our government and total indication all right well i i appreciate you joining us
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:37.560]  but like you said the north american union is back on as a security perimeter part of the reason
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:41.880]  biden is destroying the borders create a big enough crisis so they can create this north american
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:46.600]  security perimeter which will then be run by the un just like to do in europe they'll bring even more
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:50.680]  people they control so again we get they've shut them down in lockdowns they're in poverty and they
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:54.440]  want a permanent underclass i'm on enemies with all these poor people but they're being used as a weapon
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:00.680]  yeah absolutely i i just want to say about the article five convention if i could touch
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:08.440]  to that one more time on our website shop jbs.org we sell the july 11 2022 issue of the new american
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:13.640]  a special report on concon we have a sale it's currently available for 25 cents a copy i encourage
[02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:19.080]  all your readers uh after all your viewers to get a copy and read it uh and to use that in their
[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:24.920]  education efforts awarded against an article five convention my dad was awake my uncle was
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:28.280]  awake on the other side of the family because the writings of the john birch society but he
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:32.600]  hasn't been doing since i guess the early 90s or whatever it was i knew people that would just buy
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:39.000]  truckloads of these at cost big nice color magazines hand them out to everybody and the info was
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:43.800]  again over the horizon understanding so again slowly tell folks where they can buy these at cost
[02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:48.600]  i'm guessing 25 cents for a big magazine that sounds like cost or below cost and and get these
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:55.560]  and just hand them out to everybody because they have a big effect yes shop jbs.org and
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:41:01.240]  there is a tab there as well for the actually that on the screen that uh that you can purchase as a
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:07.720]  pdf download that particular one that's from 2019 um that is our our issue about the usmc
[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:13.400]  i wrote the cover story there uh warning against the uh the north american union how the usmca
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:18.440]  it specifically is uh leading us towards a north american all right the minute we have left how would
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:22.680]  you describe the it seems like there's a big awakening happening populace and nationalist
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:27.080]  anti-globalist everywhere wef half the attendees didn't go there i don't want to say we're winning
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:32.520]  but it's got to be exciting to see this big of a understanding in a large minority of people
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:39.320]  or do you disagree how would you describe the political climate right now i'm optimistic alex
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:43.960]  that more and more people are waking up uh you know we do interviews all the time as well as do
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:48.680]  you but one of the interviews that encourages me is one that my colleague alex newman did with a
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:53.080]  state representative of a state senator from the state of montana who actually had sponsored a
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:56.760]  convention of states resolution thought it was a good idea and then when he learned the truth about
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:02.040]  it uh he withdrew his support of his own bill so and it was because of the efforts of the john
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:07.960]  birch society educating um that that particular legislator there in montana uh brad tashita is
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:13.640]  the person beautiful we gotta know we're eternal spirits that god made and john birch was a great
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:18.840]  patriot and reportedly he did he just execute him they think he probably tortured him quite a bit
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:25.000]  beforehand but he's got to be looking down from heaven proud of all of us and that his life wasn't
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:30.200]  just thrown away for nothing it's it's it's given america a forward-looking view to know what was

[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:46.760]  while i had that very informative guest on go ahead hey god bless you alex it was worth holding
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:52.600]  it was great to talk to you um i was calling because i'm having a back surgery on monday
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:58.120]  and it's kind of a two-parter here the first part is i filed the short term disability claim with
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:03.320]  work and something i found extremely interesting is for all the people screaming that there are no
[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:07.720]  vaccine injuries or there's nothing with the covet vaccine you know all these people dying
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:13.560]  suddenly as you know completely normal um every single page that i clicked through as i was phoned
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:19.800]  out the short term disability claim asked me if it was due to a covet nineteen vaccine related
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:24.840]  injury um so i think it's really interesting that the short term disability claims have now
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:30.200]  been updated to address these covet vaccine injuries even though nobody is being injured by
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:37.080]  the covet covet uh vaccines according to mainstream media the second part of this that was also
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:43.000]  interesting was as they did my pre-operative screening with the hospital the nurse had asked
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:48.040]  me um she said here it says that you're not uh vaccinated against covet have you been vaccinated
[02:50:48.040 --> 02:50:53.640]  you know since they had that information i said no i have not she said good she said that uh that's
[02:50:53.640 --> 02:50:59.240]  coming from a medical professional and it's the best thing that you could have done then she asked
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:03.880]  me my blood type and i told her i was o negative with the universal donor and she said you have
[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:09.800]  million dollar blood because you don't have the vaccine and you're the universal donor so it's
[02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:15.720]  um it's interesting to see how things have changed over the last year where before we were being
[02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:21.320]  um ostracized based on the fact that we weren't willing to take this clot shot and now we're
[02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:25.080]  actually getting some well it's funny you say that because that's one of the topics i'm going to try
[02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:30.520]  to do longer form topics and back them up and get into it on this new show i'm about to launch
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:36.440]  tomorrow night six p.m and info wars dot com you'll you'll you'll see it in the feeds but i'll
[02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:42.360]  announce the website a lot of this stuff tomorrow but what you just said is so important i've been
[02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:49.000]  talking to heavy hitters okay i mean billionaires and and they've been saying the future is going to
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:54.520]  be pure bloods and people paying to have blood that didn't take the mRNA stuff and so you're saying
[02:51:54.520 --> 02:51:58.360]  you went to the hospital or being pre-screened they were basically already saying that to you
[02:51:59.400 --> 02:52:04.840]  yes they called it million dollar blood verbatim was uh the term that the nurse yeah the next big
[02:52:04.840 --> 02:52:09.720]  gold rush is going to be those that aren't infected with mRNA here's the problem they're
[02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:15.160]  injecting cows with it they're in so they're it's seeping into everything god bless you i appreciate
[02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:20.360]  your call so that guy just hit next level info that i was planning to cover tomorrow that's why
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:26.040]  i love taking the calls thank you so much for calling john all right it isn't about credit
[02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:32.200]  it isn't about giving dr john colman attention and saying what a wonderful person he was even though
[02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:40.280]  he was an amazing person it's about knowing that people like john welch 60 years ago and people
[02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:47.720]  like dr john colman 30 years ago 40 years ago were laying out was going to happen and then
[02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:55.960]  you think alge jones is amazing and that i'm able to predict stuff 25 years before because i researched
[02:52:55.960 --> 02:52:59.960]  these guys and went and saw it actually happening i didn't just believe them i went out and verified
[02:52:59.960 --> 02:53:04.200]  it did research and you know we get some credit but it's not about credit it's about being right and
[02:53:04.200 --> 02:53:11.800]  saying hey so i remember before i even went on air in like 1994 i was handed a copy of this book
[02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:21.560]  by a local activist the first name was kelly i forget his last name but i was a city council
[02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:26.600]  meeting and i was speaking out for the second amendment against land grabs under agenda 21
[02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:31.480]  that was happening even before they do the name of it and this guy walks over and he goes i'm
[02:53:31.480 --> 02:53:36.360]  going to give you this book young man and it was all torn up and the cover was half falling off and
[02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:43.000]  it was the committee of 300 that had just been published two years before 92 and i read this
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:47.560]  book and i said i don't know this guy was really an oss or am i six i don't know if he's really
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:52.120]  accurate but then i saw everything he said was starting to happen and of course years later it
[02:53:52.120 --> 02:53:58.360]  came out he was who he said he was he was in british intelligence he was read into this as one of the
[02:53:58.360 --> 02:54:03.640]  people working with one of these guys i interviewed him probably more than 10 times last time i tried
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:09.000]  to get him on you know he was too sick to come on but but the point is is that he wrote conspirators
[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:16.760]  hierarchy the story of the committee of 300 dr john colman 1992 i had copies of the book around the
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:21.000]  office i guess people run off with them or whatever there's updated editions of it i'm not making money
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:24.360]  so
[02:54:25.320 --> 02:54:32.520]  form folks win win but here's page 164 of dr john colman's book now this is one page
[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:39.800]  i bought it on kendall this weekend and reread half of it laying there in bed my wife getting
[02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:44.360]  mad at me for keeping them keeping them you know tabloid on while i was reading like 2 a.m she goes
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:51.960]  go to sleep but there i was reading and this guy wrote this in 92 he started writing it like an 88
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:59.240]  and of course the proofs in the pudding every word of it has come true and it's coming true
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:10.520]  so listen to this page 164 of the story of the committee of 300 youth in asia for the terminally
[02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:18.440]  ill and aid shall become compulsory no cities no cities shall be larger than a predetermined

[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:33.880]  if the one they are in becomes overpopulated other non-essential workers will be chosen at random
[02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:40.040]  and sent to underpopulated cities to fill quotas you're what you're going to be as a kid will be
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:46.120]  decided everything's to be predetermined at least four billion useless eaters this is back

[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:47.240]  level of one billion of which 500 million will consist of chinese and japanese races selected
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:53.320]  because they are people who have been regimented for centuries see how china's the model for control
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:58.280]  and who are accustomed to obeying authority without question from time to time there shall be

[03:00:53.640 --> 03:01:01.080]  to save the earth because painkillers are bad would you accept less anesthetic during your
[03:01:01.080 --> 03:01:09.160]  operation to save the planet it would cut greenhouse gases by 0.1 percent total crap
[03:01:11.080 --> 03:01:16.360]  that's the type of stuff that they're pushing tropical depression climate changes dramatic
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:22.840]  impact on mental health it's the globalist with the psychotropic and the crime and the tyranny
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:27.400]  and all of it that's designed to make you depressed oh no it's climate change that's making you sick

[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:54.840]  number one you can't balance a budget number two you lend before paying your bills you have to take
[03:01:54.840 --> 03:02:00.040]  from others people to pay your bills your debt is over 30 trillion meaning our government
[03:02:02.280 --> 03:02:06.600]  us has world's highest rate of children living in single-parent households
[03:02:06.600 --> 03:02:14.280]  pure research we're not attacking single parents mainly mothers but the goal was to isolate children
[03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:24.120]  and control them and you're statistically way more likely to not do well to end up in jail to be
[03:02:24.120 --> 03:02:32.280]  destroyed if you don't cover two parent home mission completed to destroy the united states and other

[03:06:42.920 --> 03:06:50.440]  surveillance strategies that are underway right now and he is going to be talking about the vaccine
[03:06:50.440 --> 03:06:56.120]  passport the digital identity how social credit system is actually being built here in the west
[03:06:56.120 --> 03:07:00.600]  and then of course central bank digital currency we might get into all of that who knows how far
[03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:06.760]  will go and i also just want to say thank you to amon for coming on and talking about this
[03:07:06.760 --> 03:07:15.160]  welcome amon javi how are you good thanks for having me kate tell you absolutely you know you
[03:07:15.160 --> 03:07:22.680]  have um you have been the one one of the most instrumental uh people in putting in the camera
[03:07:22.680 --> 03:07:30.200]  imaging into the cell phones and it corrects me if i'm wrong but this is this is why you're talking
[03:07:30.200 --> 03:07:35.240]  out about this why you're talking about where this technology leads us this technology that's
[03:07:35.240 --> 03:07:40.680]  been developed in the camera phones is very very interesting and fascinating when it comes to the
[03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:45.800]  overall kind of scope of what's happening right now facial recognition and all the rest why are
[03:07:45.800 --> 03:07:51.160]  you speaking out what what what prompted you to speak out and and and tell people exactly what's
[03:07:51.160 --> 03:08:00.120]  going on with us oh i think at a very high level i'm a lover of freedom and liberty and whenever i
[03:08:00.120 --> 03:08:06.600]  see that being infringed you know i speak up and given the fact that i came from silicon valley
[03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:12.920]  and i developed uh and helped develop a lot of the tech that's being used unfortunately now for
[03:08:12.920 --> 03:08:18.360]  surveillance even though i was working on consumer electronics i started to connect the dots over the
[03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:25.320]  years and then when covid was announced everything you know all the entire big picture came you know
[03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:31.960]  and fitted in perfectly and so as a result of which you know it was my um it has to be done
[03:08:31.960 --> 03:08:37.640]  the information needs to be fed with the world so that the world can you know act accordingly
[03:08:38.920 --> 03:08:44.440]  for sure so let's let's dive in um when you're talking you give presentations all over the
[03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:51.160]  country about this and uh let me say there there's we hear all the buzzwords vaccine passport digital
[03:08:51.160 --> 03:08:57.000]  identity social credit system obviously the central bank digital currency where do you
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:01.880]  want to start what do you want people to understand first about what is coming and how they do it
[03:09:04.600 --> 03:09:09.960]  i think let's let's start from the fact that what people can actually see with their eyes
[03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:18.440]  and okay i was in china in 2019 fall for an optical international optics conference
[03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:22.680]  and i was shocked this was in shenzhen which is kind of one of the ultimate smart cities
[03:09:22.680 --> 03:09:27.560]  that has already been built i was shocked at the amount of surveillance infrastructure that
[03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:32.360]  was already in place and people were getting tracked in real time with all sorts of cameras
[03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:38.840]  both you know license plate readers the distribution cameras infrared cameras and so much more and
[03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:43.480]  this was at intersections on their roads when they were driving whether they were entering
[03:09:43.480 --> 03:09:50.280]  a building inside conference rooms everywhere so it kind of dawned on me that i had started
[03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:56.200]  to see some of that in u.s airports over the years especially since 9 11 and then so my antennas
[03:09:56.200 --> 03:10:01.960]  went up when i returned to america and i was extremely fine tuned to seeing any infrastructure
[03:10:01.960 --> 03:10:06.760]  going up and of course uh you know with the 5g microwave towers coming up and things started
[03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:13.880]  to look ugly i started to you know connect more dots on how the camera infrastructure is going to
[03:10:13.880 --> 03:10:20.280]  be expanded they're going to collect data this is much more than surveillance so people should
[03:10:20.280 --> 03:10:26.120]  know that whenever a camera goes up it's not for your safety for your security it is to collect
[03:10:26.120 --> 03:10:33.000]  data on every human being every object every automobile every activity in the world so they're
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:40.200]  so they're putting up these uh cameras as an all-seeing eye and so i think that's where people
[03:10:40.200 --> 03:10:45.480]  should start to look within their neighborhoods within at intersections when they're driving
[03:10:45.480 --> 03:10:52.760]  and look at all the major retailers every single major retail store from walmart to target to you
[03:10:52.760 --> 03:10:58.120]  know home depot they've started to put cameras uh they're tracking you throughout the store and
[03:10:58.120 --> 03:11:04.440]  they're collecting data on view and what you're buying and your carbon credits are being updated
[03:11:04.440 --> 03:11:11.240]  in real time you're not being told that but that system has already started so i think the surveillance
[03:11:11.240 --> 03:11:16.680]  infrastructure of data collection is the first thing people need to understand and then i can
[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:25.240]  move to a concept called smart cities so what they are building and this is when i say they
[03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:32.920]  this whole agenda is coming from the united nations the united nations uh in the name of climate action
[03:11:32.920 --> 03:11:39.160]  and climate change they have something called the 17 sustainable development goals and it's really
[03:11:39.160 --> 03:11:45.160]  important that you know people educate themselves on the 17 sustainable development goals they sound
[03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:51.560]  really cute they sound innocuous and good for the planet but they use inversion language
[03:11:51.560 --> 03:11:58.120]  and they're using the sdgs of the sustainable development goals in order to implement a smart
[03:11:58.120 --> 03:12:04.440]  city agenda where at the high level the smart cities are about collecting data for optimal
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:10.360]  efficiency of movement and people within cities to keep them safe and secure to provide them with
[03:12:10.360 --> 03:12:18.280]  optimal energy to keep people from being hungry etc etc but really these smart cities with the
[03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:27.560]  cameras sensors led lights and microwave towers are all interconnected as part of a 5g and 6g
[03:12:28.120 --> 03:12:33.880]  platform where a smart city is really an invisible concentration camp for those who cannot see the
[03:12:33.880 --> 03:12:40.040]  cameras and for those who chose to see the cameras and the infrastructure it's not invisible at all
[03:12:40.680 --> 03:12:46.600]  so see smart cities are really human containment zones or concentration camps and they've already
[03:12:46.600 --> 03:12:52.120]  started to have discussions in many many parts of the world particularly in UK Canada and Australia
[03:12:52.120 --> 03:12:58.040]  about 15 minute cities so the goal is to limit the movement of people to 15 minutes from where
[03:12:58.040 --> 03:13:04.760]  they live and anytime you want to go beyond that you have to take permission and in Oxford in UK
[03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:12.360]  they introduced the 15 minute cities which they plan to put into effect in 2024 and you are only
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:18.120]  allowed to leave your district twice a week and even for leaving your district twice a week you
[03:13:18.120 --> 03:13:23.000]  have to get a permission so that's where we are going with the surveillance and data collection
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:27.640]  infrastructure which is going to be really a smart city infrastructure which are going to be
[03:13:27.640 --> 03:13:33.560]  prison camps so people should understand all the chaos that they're doing with the prison system
[03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:39.800]  and about you know the social justice for prisoners or prison reform that they've been
[03:13:39.800 --> 03:13:44.520]  talking about for years and it has nothing to do with prison reform they want to release all the
[03:13:44.520 --> 03:13:49.640]  prisoners put them into smart cities and then make every human being a prisoner in smart cities
[03:13:50.200 --> 03:13:55.400]  all jails and prisons will be closed in a few quarters so this is where the agenda is going
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:14:01.800]  with smart cities yes in fact in my state people might not realize this but just google your state
[03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:07.560]  and 15 minute city they already started building one of these in in our city and ironically enough
[03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:12.920]  they moved a prison took the property and then now they started building it in my state of
[03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:17.960]  utah i mean we have a complete nimrod governor who licks biden's boots any chance he gets
[03:14:17.960 --> 03:14:23.800]  and so this 15 minute city is going in and this might be going on in in in your state too wherever
[03:14:23.800 --> 03:14:29.560]  you're listening to the show from so realize that we're seeing the city's play out in real time that
[03:14:29.560 --> 03:14:34.920]  are ahead of the game and already already implemented but there are ones being built all over all over
[03:14:34.920 --> 03:14:42.200]  the place correct that's right every country in the world is implementing it some faster than others
[03:14:42.920 --> 03:14:49.080]  pretty much every city will eventually build it it's very easy to go and google and get the list of
[03:14:49.080 --> 03:14:53.240]  all the cities that have already signed up to be smart cities and they're getting
[03:14:53.240 --> 03:14:58.760]  tons and tons of infrastructure money from the feds and it's being printed and essentially the
[03:14:58.760 --> 03:15:05.640]  currency is being diluted in order to build our own prison camps and also destroy the car the currency
[03:15:05.640 --> 03:15:13.000]  for every you know central bank in the world and i can also know in the in the next phase i will
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:19.080]  link up smart cities to your face and your digital id and to the central banking currency
[03:15:20.120 --> 03:15:25.480]  wow and that's where the camera technology that amon worked on is is leading us to and i also
[03:15:25.480 --> 03:15:30.920]  wanted to say these cameras went up the 5g towers went up with um right in the middle of the blovid
[03:15:30.920 --> 03:15:36.040]  fake covid pandemic because of course we were preoccupied with it and so it seems you know
[03:15:36.040 --> 03:15:41.080]  they always want a dual a dual thing coming in so that we are preoccupied don't fight the cameras
[03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:46.360]  don't see what's going on and even in your state of montana you saw all of these uh new lights go
[03:15:46.360 --> 03:15:57.160]  up on the highways camera systems will be right back on the ellix jones show
[03:15:57.160 --> 03:16:03.560]  they want the planet for themselves my friends if we're so stupid we let them kill us we deserve it
[03:16:03.560 --> 03:16:20.120]  except the children don't deserve it do they and i looked and behold a pale horse and he
[03:16:20.120 --> 03:16:34.280]  that sat on the horse was named death another translation is i looked and behold a pale horse
[03:16:36.120 --> 03:16:42.200]  and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him a book of revelation
[03:16:44.200 --> 03:16:47.880]  very serious times to be alive folks they're not just doing this is one off this is the
[03:16:47.880 --> 03:16:51.800]  beginning of the rest of our lives this is our fight and i'm proud of humanity
[03:16:51.800 --> 03:16:55.800]  the globalists even admit it's leaked they're very upset that they're losing and and that this
[03:16:55.800 --> 03:16:59.800]  hasn't gone the way they thought it would i have an extremely important message to all of my

[03:20:13.960 --> 03:20:18.200]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm kate dally from kate dally radio dot com i have a
[03:20:18.200 --> 03:20:23.720]  special guest in this hour you really need to pay attention because all that's being talked about
[03:20:23.720 --> 03:20:28.760]  these are the steps being implemented right now and it's not some futuristic thing it is now
[03:20:29.320 --> 03:20:34.120]  in fact let's talk about facial recognition technology with my guest amon jobby who is a
[03:20:34.120 --> 03:20:40.200]  computer scientist and veteran silicone valley camera and image specialist on the great reset
[03:20:40.200 --> 03:20:46.680]  surveillance strategies let's talk facial recognition amon yeah so i just finished talking
[03:20:46.680 --> 03:20:53.720]  about you know smart cities and the infrastructure before i talk about facial recognition i want
[03:20:53.720 --> 03:21:01.320]  to introduce a concept called the digital identity or the digital id and i read about it in a 2018
[03:21:01.320 --> 03:21:07.480]  world economic forum paper and for those who are not familiar with the world economic forum it's a
[03:21:07.480 --> 03:21:14.920]  private corporation just like the united nations they published a paper on the digital id where
[03:21:14.920 --> 03:21:22.120]  they said that this is a new social contract in the particular chapter of the world it's a social
[03:21:22.120 --> 03:21:28.600]  contract that nobody has asked for and nobody signed up for but they want to plant a digital id
[03:21:28.600 --> 03:21:35.400]  on everything every object every person in the world and this digital id is going to be linked
[03:21:35.400 --> 03:21:43.480]  to your biometrics and specifically your face so in order to access things in life in the future
[03:21:43.480 --> 03:21:51.000]  once the digital id system comes into play you will need your face or biometrics to unlock access
[03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:57.320]  to your bank account to the internet to getting food to go shopping to drive your car to start
[03:21:57.320 --> 03:22:03.400]  your car to pay your taxes everything in life right and so this digital id is linked to your
[03:22:03.400 --> 03:22:09.640]  face primarily and this is done through facial recognition technologies and these technologies
[03:22:09.640 --> 03:22:15.240]  are usually sold to us like the carrots so when apple came out with the face id to unlock your
[03:22:15.240 --> 03:22:20.440]  unlock your phone it was really convenient because now you don't have to press a four or six digit
[03:22:20.440 --> 03:22:26.200]  code on your phone every time you want to unlock it and so these technologies come in as carrots
[03:22:26.200 --> 03:22:32.440]  but then downstream these technologies are used as sticks to basically enslave you downstream so
[03:22:32.440 --> 03:22:38.360]  people should be very aware when they sign on to new devices and new technologies so they should
[03:22:38.360 --> 03:22:43.640]  actually see technology that is linked to your digital id and on the other side of the digital
[03:22:43.640 --> 03:22:51.080]  id is linked to a new type of currency called the central banking digital currency and most
[03:22:51.080 --> 03:22:57.560]  countries in the world if not all are right now in the process of finalizing what their cbdc is
[03:22:57.560 --> 03:23:03.720]  going to be so let me break down what cbdc is it's going to be a new type of digital currency
[03:23:03.720 --> 03:23:10.840]  it's not going to be based on the value you create or the value you exchange with other people who
[03:23:10.840 --> 03:23:17.320]  create value just like you know today's currency is mostly it will be linked to three components
[03:23:18.200 --> 03:23:24.360]  one is your carbon tracker or your carbon score based on what you use and what you consume
[03:23:24.920 --> 03:23:29.800]  where you drive how far you drive etc the other is going to be a social credit which has already
[03:23:29.800 --> 03:23:35.560]  been unveiled in china and they're already computing our social credits and carbon credits
[03:23:35.560 --> 03:23:41.400]  already in the us it's not that it hasn't started they just haven't given us an app to tell us that
[03:23:41.400 --> 03:23:48.040]  we have a social score and a carbon score they are also tracking everybody's medical history
[03:23:48.040 --> 03:23:54.760]  and in particular your covid jab status and your booster status so the long-term goal once the cbdc
[03:23:54.760 --> 03:24:03.080]  is unveiled it will be used to enslave you because it's a currency of compliance it's not a currency
[03:24:03.080 --> 03:24:10.280]  based on the value you create and once the cash the current fiat currency is like the us dollar
[03:24:10.280 --> 03:24:19.560]  or ico inflated and lose all value ultimately you will be required to move to the cbdc uh
[03:24:19.560 --> 03:24:28.200]  and it's it is the responsibility and for every freedom loving person to not sign on to the
[03:24:28.200 --> 03:24:35.240]  digital id and not sign on to the cbdc system and start thinking differently as opposed to
[03:24:35.240 --> 03:24:41.400]  becoming a slave what i call is we are now in the process of transitioning from a dead slavery
[03:24:41.400 --> 03:24:47.400]  system to an identity slavery system and so it's really important to get out of both these systems
[03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:55.000]  and try and find the better words and absolutely i think one of the other things i i'll go ahead
[03:24:56.200 --> 03:25:01.480]  no geofencing i was just going to talk about yeah they started using that with the umbral
[03:25:03.080 --> 03:25:10.200]  okay with what system sorry the amber alert system they were using it in my state to override
[03:25:10.200 --> 03:25:15.320]  the system to use it for surveillance i live near a border and so if you got close to the border you
[03:25:15.320 --> 03:25:21.240]  got an alert on your phone and so the geofencing aspect is a is another part of this uh you might
[03:25:21.240 --> 03:25:29.080]  want to speak about that so geofencing is a term essentially literally it means an invisible fence
[03:25:29.880 --> 03:25:35.240]  beyond which an object or a person cannot go right so it's an invisible fence around it so it's like
[03:25:36.120 --> 03:25:41.160]  it's how the implementation of your 15 minute city and your smart cities and the prison is going
[03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:48.120]  to be done but how is it actually done right how is it implemented the smart cities another integral
[03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:55.800]  part of smart cities is led lighting so people should be aware of how many led smart lights and
[03:25:55.800 --> 03:26:01.400]  smart holes that have been put up in neighborhoods and cities and downtown and even on highways
[03:26:01.400 --> 03:26:08.360]  and freeways all around the country in the world and these led lights are not innocuous they are
[03:26:08.360 --> 03:26:15.320]  essentially full-blown computers and they are wireless nodes of the smart city infrastructure
[03:26:15.320 --> 03:26:21.480]  and network they communicate with each other wirelessly as well as some of the major ones
[03:26:21.480 --> 03:26:26.520]  they communicate with fiber optics underground which are then connected to the 5g microwave
[03:26:26.520 --> 03:26:32.360]  towers so it's all part of the infrastructure and with the sensors that are attached to these
[03:26:32.360 --> 03:26:38.760]  smart lights and the cameras that are in retail stores and intersections and in public roads
[03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:45.880]  they basically form this entire network of surveillance and data collection so one of the
[03:26:45.880 --> 03:26:53.880]  key things to understand is that data is the lifeblood of smart cities or concentration camps
[03:26:54.520 --> 03:26:59.400]  so they are just sucking up all the data they're tracking you they're scoring you they're analyzing
[03:26:59.400 --> 03:27:06.200]  you they're monitoring you they're monetizing you and they are managing you so really think about
[03:27:06.200 --> 03:27:12.600]  what i'm saying and revisit the video later if you have to and so geo fencing is the ability of
[03:27:12.600 --> 03:27:18.520]  artificial intelligence based on your behavior and compliance which is directly connected to your
[03:27:18.520 --> 03:27:25.560]  central banking digital currency to shut you off to limit your movements and to cut off your currency
[03:27:25.560 --> 03:27:31.480]  if you are not compliant and your currency won't work where they don't want it to work so that is
[03:27:31.480 --> 03:27:37.640]  essentially geo fencing in like two minutes and they are also there's a concept in cyber security
[03:27:37.640 --> 03:27:44.840]  called zero trust and zero trust is an a kind of an underlying mechanism by which geo fencing is
[03:27:44.840 --> 03:27:51.800]  actually implemented so the default is we don't trust you so as a US citizen you are effectively
[03:27:51.800 --> 03:27:58.280]  a criminal and an enemy of the state we don't trust you and in order for you to do anything in life
[03:27:58.920 --> 03:28:04.280]  from getting a glass of water to buying beef to getting into your car to driving to Lake Tahoe
[03:28:04.280 --> 03:28:10.360]  or wherever you're going you have to keep proving to us that you're a good doobie and you have to
[03:28:10.360 --> 03:28:16.360]  have enough credits on your central banking digital currency through compliance to the state and the
[03:28:16.360 --> 03:28:23.080]  state being artificial intelligence. Wow we're gonna head off to a break in just a moment but in
[03:28:23.080 --> 03:28:28.920]  word on the street is that may or June they might try to come up with a new blovid so that they can
[03:28:28.920 --> 03:28:34.200]  have a diversion to be able to put in the next layer of digital currency maybe screw up the
[03:28:34.200 --> 03:28:39.240]  accounts in the United States probably blame it on Russia as they usually do and then we'll be
[03:28:39.240 --> 03:28:44.440]  carrying out that false flag to implement another stage of this and maybe maybe you can speak to
[03:28:44.440 --> 03:28:48.440]  that when we get back but they always have to have a diversion that way you people don't fight it
[03:28:48.440 --> 03:28:52.840]  but the through the chaos you'll want to have that in place right that's what they think we'll

[03:33:04.680 --> 03:33:19.960]  back here with you on the alex jones show i uh i want to i just lost my earpiece but that stuff
[03:33:19.960 --> 03:33:25.160]  kind of happens doesn't it when you're live listen my guest is amon jobby and what an amazing
[03:33:25.800 --> 03:33:30.760]  amazing whistleblower silicon whistleblower and let me tell you um as he worked on the cell phone
[03:33:30.760 --> 03:33:36.600]  camera technology he has a lot to say about facial recognition as it will be the the tool
[03:33:37.160 --> 03:33:43.320]  to monitor track also to uh let you know who's coming who's going and also you know Ukraine
[03:33:43.320 --> 03:33:47.800]  i've i've wondered how much money is being diverted over there and money laundered into
[03:33:47.800 --> 03:33:52.920]  creating a smart country the country on a hill there's been new video that has come out where
[03:33:52.920 --> 03:33:58.360]  the money going to hack puppet zolensky is more about uh not more but a part a portion of that
[03:33:58.360 --> 03:34:03.080]  going toward a smart country smart city to rebuild you know the rebuilding efforts
[03:34:03.080 --> 03:34:07.320]  uh that the government likes to do when they rebuild they rebuild it into the smart city
[03:34:07.320 --> 03:34:11.400]  that they were desiring four years ago as they were announcing that just something to think about
[03:34:11.400 --> 03:34:17.160]  but as they transform all of this the esg uh social credit scoring system is in play right now
[03:34:17.160 --> 03:34:22.280]  for companies that if you invest in woke companies and you take those pension funds and you invest
[03:34:22.280 --> 03:34:27.080]  them into woke companies you know you get a better score so it's already in play and those are the
[03:34:27.080 --> 03:34:31.960]  kinds of things that are already here that we're already dealing with uh facial recognition all
[03:34:31.960 --> 03:34:37.800]  of it i think we just don't realize how implemented it really is and and like amon said when you start
[03:34:37.800 --> 03:34:44.360]  to see these lights pop up on the most desolate streets these led lights um these street lights
[03:34:44.360 --> 03:34:49.080]  all of these things that are being implemented and going up and we don't connect the dots enough
[03:34:49.080 --> 03:34:56.920]  so amon talking about um you know the the facial recognition and that camera technology
[03:34:56.920 --> 03:35:02.600]  is instrumental right in the way that it was done for facial recognition correct i because
[03:35:02.600 --> 03:35:06.600]  everybody thinks oh i have a camera on my phone to take photos but it was much more than that
[03:35:08.280 --> 03:35:14.760]  yeah it's basically again as i said you know the technology creeps in for consumer convenience
[03:35:14.760 --> 03:35:21.480]  and safety and security but it's most of these technologies have a diabolical uh you know end
[03:35:21.480 --> 03:35:28.680]  game attached to this and we in silicon valley you know i was there for over 25 years you know
[03:35:28.680 --> 03:35:32.760]  we are building tech that the consumers love and enjoy you know from video games to video
[03:35:32.760 --> 03:35:38.680]  streaming and cameras and photography and so much more and it does help the consumers but then it's
[03:35:38.680 --> 03:35:46.520]  ultimately used to enslave them um but you brought up esg uh i don't know how many people
[03:35:46.520 --> 03:35:52.840]  really understand her what is esg and how it's implemented but it stands for environmental
[03:35:52.840 --> 03:36:01.960]  social and governance and it is how corporations are being used as the police to enforce the
[03:36:01.960 --> 03:36:09.400]  green agenda from the sustainable development goals so every corporation gets a higher score
[03:36:09.400 --> 03:36:15.960]  if they are aligned to the sggs on the environmental side they will only choose supplier that are
[03:36:15.960 --> 03:36:23.480]  further you know working towards the sggs if they choose suppliers that are not adhering to the sggs
[03:36:23.480 --> 03:36:31.080]  their esg score will go down so it's a sort of uh you know corporate communitarianism so to speak
[03:36:31.080 --> 03:36:36.760]  and communitarianism is an interesting word i was introduced to that word only about a year ago
[03:36:37.400 --> 03:36:43.880]  even though i'd read about it i'd never really studied it but it's a way to you know take the
[03:36:45.640 --> 03:36:51.640]  take the worst of communism and the worst of crony capitalism and assign a predetermined solution
[03:36:51.640 --> 03:36:58.520]  in a sense and that is where the world is headed and it's not going to be done by you know people
[03:36:58.520 --> 03:37:06.120]  with guns it's going to be enforced it's becoming a it's going to become a snitch society and corporations
[03:37:06.120 --> 03:37:13.400]  are being used as the front for public private partnerships so it sounds really nice just as
[03:37:13.400 --> 03:37:18.840]  if the government is leveraging the the wealth of corporations in order to do all these good things
[03:37:18.840 --> 03:37:28.760]  in the world and esg also the social aspect of esg is about the narratives so black lives matter you
[03:37:28.760 --> 03:37:35.160]  know lgbtq funding what all type of advertising advertisements they do the consumer companies
[03:37:35.160 --> 03:37:41.720]  and stuff and governance stands for what all systems and uh departments they have in place
[03:37:41.720 --> 03:37:50.360]  in internally in their corporations to enforce the e and s aspects of the agenda wow and ai
[03:37:54.040 --> 03:38:00.040]  yeah so you broke up sorry you broke uh you want to talk to talk about the ai being in the ai coming
[03:38:00.040 --> 03:38:08.120]  in is uh yaji so the exactly so there are this is what so what's what's being done right now
[03:38:08.120 --> 03:38:15.080]  now is a digital transformation so if people read papers coming from the world economic forum as well
[03:38:15.080 --> 03:38:22.520]  as corporate speak and read you know papers from consulting companies like mckenzie and deloitte
[03:38:22.520 --> 03:38:29.800]  and you will see a digital transformation is taking place and what is a digital transformation
[03:38:29.800 --> 03:38:36.040]  that is not about going taking analog signals and digitizing them the digital transform
[03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:43.400]  transformation is about conditional access remember talk to you about zero trust so conditional
[03:38:43.400 --> 03:38:51.080]  access is about whether you can or cannot and by default you we have zero trust and you cannot
[03:38:51.080 --> 03:38:56.920]  access anything and you have to have that currency of compliance to your face and face recognition
[03:38:56.920 --> 03:39:06.440]  to access something so it all ties in it all ties in wow uh all right so people out there are probably
[03:39:06.440 --> 03:39:10.120]  wondering what they're going to do right now you'd like to probably be in a bunker when
[03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:14.200]  you're hearing all of this and i understand that the rural communities in the rockefeller report
[03:39:14.200 --> 03:39:19.640]  of 2010 stated that you know if you lived in a rural community your internet access would be
[03:39:19.640 --> 03:39:25.160]  limited or halted you'd have the most terrible aspects of life living trying to live off of
[03:39:25.160 --> 03:39:31.160]  this type of a 15-minute sector idea and that living rurally would be so much harder you wouldn't
[03:39:31.160 --> 03:39:36.680]  have the benefits but you certainly maybe could live outside the system i don't know
[03:39:39.880 --> 03:39:45.560]  well you should live out of outside the system if you don't want to be an eternal slave it's not
[03:39:45.560 --> 03:39:55.960]  it's not going to be easy which requires a lot of courage ingenuity and strong networks in your local
[03:39:55.960 --> 03:40:05.480]  areas and a lot more so you know we have a choice that's going to come up in a year or two or less
[03:40:05.480 --> 03:40:13.400]  or more depending on where you are is do you want to enter this you know new slavery system
[03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:21.000]  of perpetual compliance and limited mobility or do you want to find ways to resist and fight it
[03:40:22.120 --> 03:40:28.600]  and while the fight is not going to be easy the more people that wake up and rise up and come
[03:40:28.600 --> 03:40:36.280]  together in local areas i am of the belief that it can be undone it's not going to be easy but it
[03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:43.640]  can be done and you know over here in northwest montana we are trying to raise awareness as much
[03:40:43.640 --> 03:40:52.360]  as possible and see what we can do there right i mean it would be very difficult you'd have to set
[03:40:52.360 --> 03:40:56.760]  up a barter system there would have to be a lot of people and i think right now while they're so
[03:40:56.760 --> 03:41:03.320]  busy implementing all of these things we should be so busy really in more of an underground way
[03:41:03.320 --> 03:41:08.760]  developing cities that will work for us without all of this and i like you said there's always ways
[03:41:08.760 --> 03:41:14.760]  we're we're a people that that obviously we can think we can put things together and maybe it's
[03:41:14.760 --> 03:41:19.400]  a little more on the down low but we need to be implementing some strategy and some plans because
[03:41:19.400 --> 03:41:23.720]  they're awfully busy implementing their own strategies and they're putting them in daily you
[03:41:23.720 --> 03:41:28.920]  see more and more towers going up six g coming you see more and more surveillance kicking in
[03:41:28.920 --> 03:41:33.480]  and you don't see any of the politicians fighting it on any realm whatsoever both sides are in on this
[03:41:34.840 --> 03:41:42.280]  yeah those are just two heads of the same snake so it's not even worth discussing politics but i
[03:41:42.280 --> 03:41:47.720]  think it's important to understand we are not putting this these systems together the systems
[03:41:47.720 --> 03:41:53.880]  are already in place all they are doing is pulling back the curtains and step by step
[03:41:53.880 --> 03:42:01.960]  step unveiling it in a slow and steady timeline so that most people who are not aware of what's
[03:42:01.960 --> 03:42:09.080]  going on they don't really see it as obvious things happening right so and it's some simple
[03:42:09.080 --> 03:42:15.160]  things like they use qr codes they use qr codes earlier and people don't understand how qr codes
[03:42:15.160 --> 03:42:21.720]  are used and they scan the qr codes and they don't understand that these qr codes have are tracking
[03:42:21.720 --> 03:42:28.280]  you and they will be used to geofence you later downstream so absolutely if the systems are already
[03:42:28.280 --> 03:42:33.960]  in place we're going to come right back with a monjabi and talk about a few more things you might
[03:42:33.960 --> 03:42:38.520]  want to be aware of as well there's so much to understand on this because like you said it's
[03:42:38.520 --> 03:42:43.720]  there and now it's starting to be pulled back so you can see it and it is scary it is scary what
[03:42:43.720 --> 03:42:48.360]  they've been busy doing and implementing to work against us with zero trust it's the patriot act
[03:42:48.360 --> 03:42:52.200]  you're a criminal until otherwise noted we'll be right back on the alex joe show

[03:45:32.360 --> 03:45:36.840]  cannot stay on air if you do not support us i know you spread the word i know you pray for us
[03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:41.000]  and that's wonderful keep doing it but most viewers and listeners never go to info wars
[03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:45.560]  store dot com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life all at the same
[03:45:45.560 --> 03:45:49.800]  time keep us on air i know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products in
[03:45:49.800 --> 03:45:54.760]  foreshore dot com if just one percent more of you took action that went in foreshore dot com
[03:45:54.760 --> 03:45:59.480]  our funding problems will be over please take action now the good news is the real red pill
[03:45:59.480 --> 03:46:03.560]  plus after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients are unavailable
[03:46:03.560 --> 03:46:08.360]  but supply chain right now is finally back in stock in the last month the bad news is we did
[03:46:08.360 --> 03:46:13.480]  a limited run of it and it's almost sold out so we're in late january when i'm cutting this
[03:46:13.480 --> 03:46:18.120]  only seven days left to get the real red pill plus with all the key ingredients like pregnant

[03:46:30.360 --> 03:46:35.320]  about it from a research scientist and a medical doctor who had a similar formula five years ago
[03:46:35.320 --> 03:46:39.480]  we simply made it stronger and we have great reviews from listeners get the real red pill
[03:46:39.480 --> 03:46:45.080]  plus for a limited time it's about to end at info wars store dot com for 50 off you need to try the
[03:46:45.080 --> 03:46:49.400]  real red pill plus right now plus it funds the info war the only way we fail is if you don't take
[03:46:49.400 --> 03:46:55.400]  action real red pill plus now available at 50 off at info wars store dot com for only a few more days
[03:46:55.400 --> 03:46:57.400]  next week
[03:46:58.680 --> 03:47:04.680]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:47:12.440 --> 03:47:16.600]  welcome back to this last segment of this hour on the alex jones show i'm kate dally from
[03:47:16.600 --> 03:47:22.280]  kate dally radio dot com my guest is a mon jobby whistleblower silicon valley talking about where
[03:47:22.280 --> 03:47:30.120]  the tech takes us the ai everything i first want to ask you though puke ray technology p u k e
[03:47:30.120 --> 03:47:36.280]  does you want to speak to that for just a moment what is that sure just but before i speak to that
[03:47:36.280 --> 03:47:43.160]  i don't consider myself a whistleblower i'm not blowing any whistles i can be called an insider
[03:47:43.160 --> 03:47:50.120]  having worked in silicon valley for well over two decades but puke ray is somebody from van
[03:47:50.120 --> 03:47:57.960]  couver had sent me a photograph you know almost 10 months ago and i this these are these screens
[03:47:57.960 --> 03:48:03.720]  looking lights that were installed all over their city and i dug deeper and came across a project
[03:48:03.720 --> 03:48:11.560]  that dhs had funded uh an optical communications in company about 15 years ago and it was called
[03:48:11.560 --> 03:48:20.040]  the led incapacitator and it was given the name puke ray so what it works is it has uh it has led
[03:48:20.040 --> 03:48:26.520]  uh red green and blue led light syndrome and they can be manipulated at a very very high
[03:48:26.520 --> 03:48:34.840]  frequency and different colors can be generated and by the time a human brain and i adapts to one
[03:48:34.840 --> 03:48:41.960]  color the colors will change and imagine doing this millions of times a second so your brain
[03:48:41.960 --> 03:48:49.720]  basically cannot adapt to that and it can cause intracranial pressure and spinal damage and it will
[03:48:49.720 --> 03:48:56.040]  cause nausea at the very least and it could eventually kill a person so these are technologies
[03:48:56.040 --> 03:49:01.800]  that have been funded by you know big brother three letter agencies and this this tech was then
[03:49:01.800 --> 03:49:07.400]  taken to pen state about 10 years ago uh into a new department that was formed and i don't know
[03:49:08.120 --> 03:49:14.840]  well how far ahead or how fine fine tuned that technology is but it's a good point you brought
[03:49:14.840 --> 03:49:20.280]  up because it's important to understand that these led lights that have been sold to the public
[03:49:20.840 --> 03:49:26.760]  for energy conservation in the name of climate action they are actually extremely nefarious
[03:49:26.760 --> 03:49:34.360]  they are harmful for human health they are really bad for your eyesight and can cause retinal
[03:49:34.360 --> 03:49:41.640]  damage and a whole lot more and many of these led lights have been retrofitted with uh you know
[03:49:41.640 --> 03:49:48.280]  400 volts type of antennas in them as well as many of them have drone charging stations at the top
[03:49:48.840 --> 03:49:55.000]  so the future is not looking good because there's going to be aerial drone police and autonomous
[03:49:55.000 --> 03:50:00.600]  drones that are going to be buzzing all over the world you know and giving instructions like they
[03:50:00.600 --> 03:50:08.440]  started in Chinese Chinese cities already so that's you pray for you okay and can incapacitate humans
[03:50:08.440 --> 03:50:13.000]  be weaponized is your probably your overall point on that and they can use those anytime
[03:50:13.000 --> 03:50:17.480]  but we don't realize the kinds of lights they're putting in and i'm so glad you're covering that
[03:50:17.480 --> 03:50:24.040]  let's talk about ai um because ai a little bit deeper because ai is such a big portion of this
[03:50:24.040 --> 03:50:28.920]  and we don't realize we don't realize how much has already been done with ai because we're probably
[03:50:28.920 --> 03:50:33.320]  ahead about 50 years than what we actually realize i think where we are right now
[03:50:33.320 --> 03:50:41.480]  right so artificial intelligence or ai is as i was talking about the digital transformation
[03:50:41.480 --> 03:50:44.920]  there are five pillars to the digital transformation and i'll try and make it
[03:50:45.640 --> 03:50:52.280]  non-technical for the average listener but there's the internet of things or iot that i think is
[03:50:52.280 --> 03:50:58.440]  quite prevalent in today's lingo so the internet of things are the nodes like cameras and sensors
[03:50:58.440 --> 03:51:07.320]  that are connected to the internet on a 5g or a 6g network the data collected from these nodes
[03:51:07.320 --> 03:51:12.360]  or the iot is goes to the cloud so the cloud is the second pillar of the transmission where the
[03:51:12.360 --> 03:51:19.240]  data is stored and then ai is all the smart algorithms that are running on the in the cloud
[03:51:20.040 --> 03:51:27.160]  on the data forcing the data analyzing the data logging the data scoring the data and doing analytics
[03:51:27.160 --> 03:51:34.680]  and intelligent storage that's for the third pillar of the transformation is ai which is the
[03:51:34.680 --> 03:51:41.720]  think of it as the brain behind everything and then once ai processes all the relevant data
[03:51:41.720 --> 03:51:47.400]  it's then put into something called a blockchain and blockchain is a digital ledger technology
[03:51:47.400 --> 03:51:53.880]  where relevant pieces of data are stored so when you know when the cameras are tracking
[03:51:53.880 --> 03:51:59.800]  you think of it as it goes to the cloud it analyzes your good behavior or bad behavior the
[03:51:59.800 --> 03:52:05.880]  things you do the things you eat and it goes and puts all the interesting data on a blockchain
[03:52:05.880 --> 03:52:10.680]  which is linked to your digital ID so the blockchain is the fourth pillar of the digital
[03:52:10.680 --> 03:52:17.880]  transformation and then the fifth one is the security guards the zero trust security guards
[03:52:17.880 --> 03:52:24.280]  so that's cyber security so depending on what your data is and how your digital ID is linked to
[03:52:24.280 --> 03:52:30.840]  your cvdc on the blockchain you may or may not be allowed access to whatever it is in life so this
[03:52:30.840 --> 03:52:36.120]  is how the artificial intelligence plays a central role in the digital transformation
[03:52:37.240 --> 03:52:45.320]  for ai to get smarter and have more control over you through this transformation it needs more
[03:52:45.320 --> 03:52:54.120]  and more and more data so think of it as ai is the beast system and the beast needs food the more
[03:52:54.120 --> 03:53:01.640]  food it gets the smarter and more powerful it gets and the data conduits for the food are the
[03:53:01.640 --> 03:53:09.960]  sensors the cameras the led lights the smart city infrastructure and the 5g and 60 uh microwave
[03:53:09.960 --> 03:53:19.240]  towers and the infrastructure so the only way to starve the beast is by cutting down the data
[03:53:19.240 --> 03:53:24.840]  or starving the data by removing or undoing the smart city infrastructure because that is what
[03:53:24.840 --> 03:53:31.800]  we can see it's what we can touch and it's what we can undo so it's really important to raise
[03:53:31.800 --> 03:53:40.600]  awareness this entire infrastructure has been put up without the public's knowledge no public
[03:53:41.480 --> 03:53:47.000]  was consulted in any part of our country or the world we didn't ask for this infrastructure
[03:53:47.000 --> 03:53:51.640]  of surveillance and data collection but it's been put up and it's been put up without our
[03:53:51.640 --> 03:54:00.920]  permission on our land to harm humans and harm animal health and harm the natural nature and
[03:54:00.920 --> 03:54:07.480]  itself so it's really a diabolical agenda that people need to recognize and do something about
[03:54:07.480 --> 03:54:15.400]  it in your local neighborhoods so working with um and fighting against the city councils implementing
[03:54:15.400 --> 03:54:19.720]  the cities and counties implementing this in your local neighborhood is imperative we've
[03:54:19.720 --> 03:54:23.560]  gone way too long putting our heads in the sand trying to raise families and work and i know there's
[03:54:23.560 --> 03:54:28.920]  a lot of stress out there except that we have not been vigilant in stopping the cities and counties
[03:54:28.920 --> 03:54:33.720]  from doing this because basically we're telling them to build a prison for us an invisible prison
[03:54:33.720 --> 03:54:38.120]  we're saying go ahead and build it if we don't show up we don't fight this and it's the cities
[03:54:38.120 --> 03:54:43.320]  they're reliant on the cities to be able to put all this infrastructure in so we have got to fight
[03:54:43.320 --> 03:54:50.680]  it and get the infrastructure out or not let them put this up correct that's right but that's
[03:54:50.680 --> 03:54:56.520]  partially right it's not just the cities so the way it's being done is it's being done through
[03:54:56.520 --> 03:55:02.760]  infrastructure bills and the comet bills that were signed uh you know pre-biden by trump and
[03:55:02.760 --> 03:55:07.960]  then infrastructure bills signed by biden so there was a lot of you know hundreds of billions of
[03:55:07.960 --> 03:55:15.080]  dollars of money and then it was pumped through public private partnerships in the name of
[03:55:15.080 --> 03:55:22.440]  sustainability so it includes a class of companies that are the telecom companies or the tower
[03:55:22.440 --> 03:55:30.280]  companies it includes money given by these companies through local contractors who install
[03:55:30.280 --> 03:55:38.120]  all this equipment at night when people are asleep it includes making deals with the department of
[03:55:39.000 --> 03:55:44.440]  transportation in every state that's at the state level where they've gone and given money to the
[03:55:44.440 --> 03:55:50.200]  states in exchange for that money they give up rights and they say we'll install all this
[03:55:50.200 --> 03:55:55.720]  very nice infrastructure for high speed connectivity and for better roads and better you know traffic
[03:55:55.720 --> 03:56:03.720]  system etc and then at the local level they use the electric companies as well as city council
[03:56:03.720 --> 03:56:09.240]  and county commissions so these LED lights for instance and the sensors and all they are
[03:56:10.040 --> 03:56:16.760]  they are under this jurisdiction of multiple bodies but fundamentally they've gone up where
[03:56:16.760 --> 03:56:21.720]  contracts have been signed and it's really important to get to the heart of those contracts
[03:56:21.720 --> 03:56:28.760]  and see how states and local neighborhoods have given up our land rights and our participation
[03:56:28.760 --> 03:56:34.600]  rights as free people to the feds and the feds are really being controlled by the united nations
[03:56:34.600 --> 03:56:41.240]  charter we are cattle we should just start moving right now if we do not fight this if we do not
[03:56:41.240 --> 03:56:45.720]  try to stop this and if you don't know what geo fencing is climate action climate lockdown

[03:57:03.320 --> 03:57:07.640]  those are so i'm going to have to have you back them on because there's way too much to talk about
