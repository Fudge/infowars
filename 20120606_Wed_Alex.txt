[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:35.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  Well, this is experimental what we're doing here today.
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  Great job to the crew in Austin. Great job to Richard Reeves driving and getting all this set up.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  Obviously, not at the same time.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  We are live and back in Texas, back in the Promised Land.
[00:50.000 --> 00:51.000]  Thank you so much.
[00:51.000 --> 01:01.000]  We've just left Waukesahatchee, Texas, and we are about three hours ETA away from the InfoWars.com headquarters.
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  We're on the rotting Texas roads because the globalists steal all the money from the surplus that builds roads.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  I want to turn them all into toll roads.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  So we are just banging across road warrior-level roads here.
[01:12.000 --> 01:13.000]  You travel around the country.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  You just, you know how bad Texas roads are, even though we have more money than any other state for highways.
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  It's all stolen by the Global Crime Syndicate.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  On record, you can check that out for yourself.
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  Well, we have got a huge transmission lined up for you today.
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.000]  I am doing the show live, driving down I-35.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  That was going to be the NAFTA Super Highway until we shot that down.
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  First, it didn't exist, then the documents came out out of the Bilderberg Group meeting and others.
[01:39.000 --> 01:49.000]  And, well, now the whole program is in trouble, and Rick Perry is entering the ash heap, the ash heap of political history.
[01:49.000 --> 01:57.000]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, we have some big news lined up for you here today.
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  Obviously, there are Bilderberg leaks.
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  We got documents the second day at Bilderberg on Friday.
[02:06.000 --> 02:15.000]  And I was too busy talking to other sources, people inside the hotel that worked there, bullhorning while, quite frankly,
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  just being completely dead in the water, signing autographs to shake people's hands, which was great,
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  but it just kept me from doing a lot of things I wanted to do.
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.000]  But it was just so great to see all the liberty lovers that came out and pushed the mainstream corporate dinosaur media into covering it.
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  But in the last two days, we had time to read all of these documents.
[02:31.000 --> 02:32.000]  Aaron's run them all.
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  I've scanned over several hundred pages of them.
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  This is from the private government archives of a U.S. senator.
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  And coming up, we're going to have Aaron in a few minutes co-hosting with me, breaking this down.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  So this is Bilderberg leaks.
[02:47.000 --> 02:54.000]  The only other documents in whole that have leaked are from meetings, the first and second meeting in 54 and 55.
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  Bilderberg themselves let selective amounts of it, what about five, six years ago, leaked to the BBC,
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  so they could brag at the Undavenian and others.
[03:04.000 --> 03:12.000]  Yes, we helped set up the European Union out of the Coal and Steel Deal and the Treaty of Rome.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  Yes, we helped set up NATO as this world government.
[03:16.000 --> 03:17.000]  That's from the mid-fifties.
[03:17.000 --> 03:25.000]  We have the 1966 meeting notes from an Oklahoma senator who was there being vetted and groveling
[03:25.000 --> 03:33.000]  and groveling and writing notes as the Bilderberg group is talking, along with the Bilderberg inviting list,
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  letters from the Prince who founded it, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands,
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  the husband of the Queen of the Netherlands, the cousins of the House of Windsor of the Saxonburg of us,
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  all of this.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  We've got it all.
[03:45.000 --> 03:53.000]  We tried to do a Ustream last night, but the roads were so bad coming back into North Texas that the bus was flying all over the road.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  This is a lot better.
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  But those choppy Ustreams are up there.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  That's going to be added to an article.
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  Paul Watson is doing right now on the Bilderberg information coming out.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  So this is going to be big.
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  It's going to be out in the next few hours at infowars.com.
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  Also, we're going to have Charlie Skelton on in one hour.
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  And again, he didn't leave till last night.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  He just got back in England and worked all the hotel sources because they didn't know who he was.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  He was able to stay in the hotel till Thursday morning.
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  And he was able to hand out his card to the staff.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  They gave none of them tips.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  They were rude and mean to him as they always are.
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  Don't let me in the I.U.
[04:35.000 --> 04:36.000]  The cockroach.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  So the staff gave him everything.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  Our sources have confirmed much of what Skelton said.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  Skelton confirmed Jim Tucker's thing about them being mad at the protesters calling us cockroaches.
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.000]  But Skelton has the data from four staff that Mitt Romney was there.
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  Not over the weekend, but on Thursday.
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  This is Big Stay With Us.
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.000]  It's true.
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[05:52.000 --> 06:00.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[06:00.000 --> 06:06.000]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[06:06.000 --> 06:12.000]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[06:12.000 --> 06:15.000]  by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[06:15.000 --> 06:19.000]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[06:19.000 --> 06:26.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[06:26.000 --> 06:31.000]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.000]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[06:46.000 --> 06:53.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds, and wells.
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  It's what my family uses.
[07:46.000 --> 07:49.000]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.000]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off and Infowars.com.
[07:55.000 --> 08:21.000]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[08:21.000 --> 08:38.000]  If you're watching at prismplanet.tv, you can see the live feed out the front of the Infowars Command Center.
[08:38.000 --> 08:47.000]  Aaron Dykes is riding shotgun here with me, along with, of course, Richard Reeves and Rob Jacobson, the crew, back in Austin, Texas.
[08:47.000 --> 08:54.000]  They're at the helm in case we have any technical difficulties on our three different backup feeds.
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.000]  Rob Dew is sitting in studio. He'll be giving us his analysis and commentary.
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  And at the bottom of the hour, he'll give us some of the Infowars.com news headlines,
[09:04.000 --> 09:11.000]  DrudgeReport.com headlines, and other headlines that are breaking analysis and information.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  We've got a big day.
[09:13.000 --> 09:22.000]  This week was even more than ever blown wide open. This is as big as the Copenhagen carbon tax emails getting leaked two and a half years ago.
[09:22.000 --> 09:31.000]  I'm not a big drinking man, but I think there may be some champagne getting popped this evening at the Jones Hacienda.
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.000]  So good job, Richard. Yeah. Good job. Good job, Snack. Good job to everybody. Good job, Jacobson.
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  Good job to everybody. Big shout out to all the listeners and supporters, everybody that came out to Bilderberg 2012.
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  Charlie Skelton is joining us in T minus 50 minutes. Just got off the plane at three this morning.
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  Just got up back to England and said he is ready to roll in T minus 50 minutes.
[09:56.000 --> 10:04.000]  He's got breaking news. Four different sources inside the hotel say, yes, they saw Mitt Romney bigger than Dallas, Texas.
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  That's at my back. We just drove through bigger than Dallas, Texas.
[10:08.000 --> 10:17.000]  There on Thursday, he was doing West Coast events on the days after that.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  Now, was there other a dark hair distinguish looking gentlemen there? Who knows?
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  But Charlie Skelton's proven himself very, very accurate with the London Guardian.
[10:28.000 --> 10:37.000]  And so I tend to think that his four sources are accurate. He confirmed what Jim Tucker told us three, four days ago, or I guess five days ago now,
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  that when we would bullhorn everybody coming in and they'd see Alex Jones in FullWars.com, Ron Paul signs,
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  they would get out angry and say, we want to kill Ron Paul, we want to blow him up on an airplane, murder his supporters.
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.000]  We're cockroaches, all of this. Our sources confirmed they were hopping mad when they would come in.
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.000]  We were shaking the hotel at one time, seven bullhorns in one spot, Daisy Chained.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  The U-Stream videos of that are on our channel. In fact, we ought to post that and just say the bull, the mother of all bullhorn.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  Powerful videos at mfullwars.com. We need to get those posted. Another on the U-Stream.
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  I think they were posted, but not with the headline. I mean, it was just incredible.
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  It was deafening, gave me a migraine headache, brought me to my knees repeatedly.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  It was like the people's LRAD is what it was called.
[11:21.000 --> 11:29.000]  So, we have that with Charlie Skelton joining us. Also, Congresswoman, as you know, points out they're purposefully hiring pedophiles.
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.000]  They're not accidentally hiring them at the TSA. They're putting them in the command positions all over the United States.
[11:36.000 --> 11:46.000]  Who else wants to grab three-year-old girls and boys' crotches? You couldn't pay me a billion dollars to do that one time.
[11:46.000 --> 11:54.000]  It is totally perverted and evil and ruining the innocence of a child. But it's the new sacrament in America to have drones, illegal surveillance,
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.000]  and your children molested. Every ancient society demanded that children be turned over for sacrifice.
[11:59.000 --> 12:07.000]  So, we have boarded 52 million since Roe v. Wade in 73, 74. Well, ruling 73 went into effect 74.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  It was like a new option. Hey, who's the trendy thing? Have an abortion. I know my parents didn't have any money.
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  People were like, oh, have an abortion. I was born in 74, but they didn't chop me up.
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000]  And if you don't want to hear it, it's a baby. I don't care what you think. These eugenicists want it. That's what it is.
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  Okay? Partial birth, abortion, all of it. I'm tired of it. Face what it is.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  We live in denial about that. Now we're living in denial about everything else. We're going to be judged as a nation.
[12:33.000 --> 12:40.000]  If you don't believe in God, believe in cause and effect. Okay? Believe in, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[12:40.000 --> 12:45.000]  If you say 52 million babies aren't humans, well, you're going to say torture's okay.
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.000]  You're going to say secret arrest is okay. You're going to say drones and checkpoints are okay.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  I've driven all over this country. My entire life, my parents...
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  I think we lost Alex there for one second. Well, he was just getting into a really good rant.
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  I wish he could have gone on with that. We'll be right back to him as soon as he comes back.
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.000]  I'm just going to go ahead and go over a couple headlines. Google warns users they may become collateral damage in cyber war.
[13:13.000 --> 13:20.000]  And this is from Kurt Nemo. It's on infowars.com. Google announced on Tuesday it will begin displaying a warning to users
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.000]  who the internet giant believe are under state-sponsored malware attack. State-sponsored.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  I think Jones is right back, so we'll go right back to Jones. Alex, can you hear me?
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.000]  Absolutely.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  Go ahead.
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  Absolutely. I'm back. And Richard, I'm just doing some technical stuff here on air. I'll continue with me.
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  Richard, this is my access. When it drops, I see the red means it's reconnected.
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  Don't we have a Skype backup hooked up to that? Isn't Aaron's phone a Skype backup?
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  That's a Skype backup.
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  But it's hooked to his microphone. Can I grab that mic when I have a problem?
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  No, that's another mic right there for that.
[13:54.000 --> 14:00.000]  Okay. Okay, good. So guys, we also have a Skype backup on the eastbound and down, now southbound and down.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  Cam, you guys understand that? At the network.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  Yeah, I think you guys got there.
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  Roger?
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.000]  Yeah.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  Okay, Roger. Roger.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  Okay, good. Thank you, dude. Yeah, what part did I cut out there?
[14:11.000 --> 14:18.000]  The point is, is that if you have 52 million abortions, then you say torture's okay, secret arrest is okay, checkpoints are okay,
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.000]  evil's okay, warrantless wiretapping's okay, sterilization of vaccines is okay, GMO killing all the rats is okay,
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  the honeybee's dying is okay, Fukushima blowing up with over 80 something times the radiation of Chernobyl's okay,
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  everything's okay. No, everything's not okay.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  We're here to tell you this is your root awakening. This is the wake-up call. We want our republic back.
[14:41.000 --> 14:50.000]  So coming up first, we're going to give you Bilderberg leaks, some of the biggest Bilderberg leak documents ever.
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000]  The only others that we have at this level that are handwritten notes from the meetings, agendas, official lists,
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.000]  their internal memorandum is from the mid-1950s. They themselves leaked it to the BBC bragging they set up the EU.
[15:02.000 --> 15:10.000]  We have the 1966 meeting. We were given this by a government insider who said,
[15:10.000 --> 15:20.000]  look, I'm giving you these documents because it's got the head of the United Auto Workers meeting in Wiesbaden, Germany,
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  that's coming up at the start of the next segment. Big, breaking Bilderberg docs.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  We've tweeted some of those out today, took a bunch of photos on the road, emailed them, photos of the documents,
[15:32.000 --> 15:40.000]  to Paul Watson, he's working tirelessly, just an absolute war horse in the fight against the globalists.
[15:40.000 --> 15:46.000]  He's going to have a report out on that in the next hour or so, but again, some of those are up on the Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[15:46.000 --> 15:53.000]  Aaron Dykes is here, and he's going to be going over the documents audibly on the radio from right over here,
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  beside me on the bus as we head back to the Info Wars Center.
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  So, is all good there over to the Info Wars headquarters, dude?
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.000]  Everything's sounding great, Alex. You know, I don't know if you saw this, we broke this yesterday.
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  I guess we didn't break it, it was already out on the newsstand, but Mike Adams pulled up a cover of Time magazine that he had picked up.
[16:16.000 --> 16:24.000]  It says Time, and then All in Red and then White Letters, How to Die, what I learned from the last days of my mom and dad by Joe Klein.
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.000]  Definitely, and if you guys can get a shot of this from the overhead cam, you can actually see it.
[16:29.000 --> 16:36.000]  The cover of Time magazine, all it says is How to Die. They even, they're doing one up on a case for killing Granny at this point.
[16:36.000 --> 16:42.000]  Which shows a stretcher with an unplugged plug, and Granny dead, and Bill Gates says the teachers union,
[16:42.000 --> 16:48.000]  if we don't give an old woman the last year of her life and smiling, licking his little demonic lips,
[16:48.000 --> 16:56.000]  knowing that they're all about to beg him to kill him, you'll all get 10 jobs, and they go, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[16:56.000 --> 17:05.000]  You idiots, grow the economy, there's unlimited wealth, you get into this predatory system, they want to post industrial world, and they scumbag.
[17:08.000 --> 17:15.000]  There's a shot right there, How to Die, let me back it up a little bit on that Time magazine, How to Die.
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.000]  What I learned from the last days of my mom and dad is by Joe Klein, and I was just looking at another article on Drudge,
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  and it had, it was by Joe Klein, and that's what reminded me of that.
[17:24.000 --> 17:36.000]  We covered this last night on the Info Wars Nightly News, we had Mike Adams on to break down what's going on with the Sharon Palmer case with Rossum Foods,
[17:36.000 --> 17:45.000]  and now she's being, they're basically raking her over the coals, doing this from an informant who has a false credentials,
[17:45.000 --> 17:54.000]  he's gone through a, basically a diploma mill, and I believe we have Alex back?
[17:54.000 --> 18:02.000]  No, okay, so he's going through a diploma mill to get his diploma, it says he's got a PhD, he's running around installing people,
[18:02.000 --> 18:11.000]  he's got a PhD in nutrition, and then he's using that as a hedgeway to get into and talk to the authorities of Intura County
[18:11.000 --> 18:18.000]  to try and bring charges up against Sharon Palmer of defrauding her investors when they're attacking her so she can't even make a living,
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  thereby can't pay back the investors, so they're calling that fraud.
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.000]  And I believe we have Alex back right now, you can check that out in last night's Info Wars Nightly News.
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  Alex, are you there?
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  Yes, sir, yes sir, can you hear me?
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  I can hear you, you're loud and clear.
[18:36.000 --> 18:43.000]  Okay, okay, just to be clear, during the next break we may go to Skype, we have three backups for XM and all the listeners out there,
[18:43.000 --> 18:55.000]  experimental radio live from an RV with two Skypes and a 4G, we have a Skype 4G and access unit coming to you with breaking news and analysis after this break,
[18:55.000 --> 19:03.000]  but yes, they're selling us that humans are evil, humans are bad, humans are scum, humans cause all the problems, humans don't have beautiful potential,
[19:03.000 --> 19:10.000]  humans didn't create Beethoven, humans didn't create science and technology and beauty and love and honor and courage.
[19:10.000 --> 19:18.000]  No, humans are ugly and bad, so die, lay down, give in to the globalists, lay down, give up, you're scum, you're trash, you're ugly, you're filth,
[19:18.000 --> 19:26.000]  while they poison the water and the food to make it a self-fulfilling prophecy, while they deluge us with a culture of death to make us a dying society,
[19:26.000 --> 19:33.000]  then as they create a false ancestral memory and predisposition and pre-belief,
[19:33.000 --> 19:41.000]  a self-fulfilling prophecy that we're all dead, all the newsstands, the world without humans, it's coming, how beautiful it's going to be,
[19:41.000 --> 19:49.000]  the end of humanity, you see it all over Discovery Channel, getting you ready for the bio-weapon release, the moon raker scenario when they go in the underground bunkers,
[19:49.000 --> 19:56.000]  they're preparing their mass murder, those that come out of the caves will be attacked by Skynet computers, this is the official plan,
[19:56.000 --> 20:03.000]  mayday emergency situation, warranty humanity resists now, breaker trans, emergency transmissions, emergency transmissions,
[20:03.000 --> 20:12.000]  back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working, my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins,
[20:12.000 --> 20:19.000]  and as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[20:19.000 --> 20:30.000]  Now there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.

[22:38.000 --> 22:42.000]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[29:57.000 --> 30:07.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[30:07.000 --> 30:12.000]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[30:12.000 --> 30:18.000]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.

[33:28.000 --> 33:33.000]  Anthrax.
[33:33.000 --> 33:43.000]  Yeah, I know. I'm about a second delayed so I can't sing along as horribly as I normally do.
[33:43.000 --> 33:58.000]  And radio.
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  What if I told you they were lying?
[34:01.000 --> 34:11.000]  What if I told you?
[34:11.000 --> 34:21.000]  I like me some clutch.
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.000]  Anthrax.
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  And radio.
[34:29.000 --> 34:36.000]  I think I'm going to start my own metal band, that's it.
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.000]  Dave Mustangs already talked to me about that, he said he wants to make us some music.
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.000]  Yeah, some good music, man, I tell you.
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  All right, I'm sorry, I'm kind of celebrating.
[34:53.000 --> 35:03.000]  I want to thank God here on air that we've had such a devastating victory against the...
[35:03.000 --> 35:07.000]  Because the answer to charity is courage.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  Now occasionally I just want to tell the network just whatever...
[35:11.000 --> 35:17.000]  Whatever we did just now, since we told the feedback, I don't know what I'm saying.
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  So whatever, whatever's happening...
[35:22.000 --> 35:28.000]  I think we're having, we switched to Skype and then I think that started to feedback into Jones' ear.
[35:28.000 --> 35:36.000]  This is experimental and we're doing this live and you don't really know how it's going to go out live until you're actually doing it.
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.000]  And you see all the different chains and stuff, we're linked up to that main office up in Minnesota.
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.000]  We're here, Jones and Company are on a bus coming down.
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.000]  So it's a lot of crazy stuff going on, but we're making it happen and I think we have...
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  Well, it seems right here, I've got full...
[35:56.000 --> 36:02.000]  Did my little rant to clutch, did my little rant to clutch not go out?
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.000]  No, your rant to clutch did go out and they are a great band.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  All right, good, that's very important.
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  Yeah, that's very important.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  Very stylish beards as well.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  All right, maybe Al-Qaeda.
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  Now listen, let's get back to what I was saying here, okay?
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  Let's just get back here to this.
[36:20.000 --> 36:32.000]  We're about to give you the big 1966 data dump with Aaron Dykes back there who's gone over these hundreds and hundreds of pages of documents directly from a secret government archive, the private papers of a senator.
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  We'll go over the names of it, all of it, from the Bilderberg meeting 1966, Prince Bernhardt, all of it.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  We've got photos, shots of that.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  Watson's got an article coming out soon.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  Charlie Skelton, the London Guardian coming up confirming Mitt Romney was there.
[36:45.000 --> 36:50.000]  This is big, but I want to stop for a moment and talk about Bob Chapman.
[36:50.000 --> 36:56.000]  Bob did die Monday and I started getting calls at the office.
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  The guys looked and said, no, there was a soccer player named Bob Chapman that died.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  I went off what they told me.
[37:01.000 --> 37:09.000]  Later, Duke called me and said, no, we found the obituary from yesterday in Florida and I'm going to have Rob do read that obituary here in a moment.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  I knew three months ago he was sick.
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  That's why you stopped hearing him on the Friday show.
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  I said, well, if you're sick, let's just cut back.
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  And then he was on every once in a while and he was really too sick to do that.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  Then he said, yeah, I'm coming back to the US, but that's private.
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  Then last week his family announced he was here with pancreatic cancer.
[37:25.000 --> 37:31.000]  I was at Bilderberg, didn't know that was authorized to talk about, so I still didn't.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  And then I hoped he wasn't dead yesterday and we were incorrect.
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  He died on Monday and the obituary came out yesterday.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  So everybody that was calling us, you are correct.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  So that's a side issue.
[37:43.000 --> 37:49.000]  The point is he's dead and it's very, very sad and I wish he wasn't dead, obviously.
[37:49.000 --> 37:57.000]  And we have a video live feed archive, Bob Chapman, Defender of Life at infowars.com.
[37:57.000 --> 38:05.000]  I'd appreciate everybody to get that video where I eulogize Bob out to everybody and I do plan to while we're trying to get all this Bilderberg news,
[38:05.000 --> 38:13.000]  collated, we shot in high def when we get back tonight and things ready for the nightly news, Thursday night, Friday night, maybe even tonight.
[38:13.000 --> 38:18.000]  And while we try to get all these documents ready, we're going to try to go back over 15 years, almost 15 years,
[38:18.000 --> 38:26.000]  start interviewing Bob in about 97, 98 of Bob together so we can remember Bob properly sometime next week.
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  But that is up there and he did die.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  He was down in Mexico, Germany.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  He was all over the world.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  Last place he was at was Mexico.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  And I knew that but nobody really else did.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  But Bob is now gone.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  We love you, Bob.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  His funny voice, one of my mom's favorite guests.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  She liked Bob Chapman and she likes Gerald Salenta.
[38:47.000 --> 38:53.000]  And she doesn't like some other people but I'll just leave it at that.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  But if my mom likes you, we know you're good.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  And he's dead.
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.000]  Like we're all going to end up being, so defend life, defend the species, defend the future, that's what matters.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  Everybody comes and goes.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  But what matters is what we do today and that we're honorable and that we have courage.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  And Bob had buckets of that.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  And I love you, Bob.
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  So happy trails, compadre.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  Happy trails, my friend.
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  Happy trails, buddy.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  Again, that's really all I can say.
[39:23.000 --> 39:30.000]  You were a really funny, smart, nice guy who for 45 years, I looked it up, fought the New World Order toe-to-toe.
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  They planted hangar nades on him, death-threatening, set him up over and over again.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  And he finally left the U.S. what a decade ago.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  And he came back to die with his family in Florida.
[39:42.000 --> 39:48.000]  So, again, Vicodillos, my friend.
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  And Alex, he died a free man.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  He didn't die in a prison.
[39:52.000 --> 40:01.000]  I'm going to now have Rob do give us some comments about Bob Chapman and read from the official statement.
[40:01.000 --> 40:09.000]  This is from the Laughlin funeral home where you can go and actually sign his guestbook, which I'll tell you guys what I wrote in a second.
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.000]  But in memory of Robert Chapman, October 16, 1935 to June 4, 2012.
[40:15.000 --> 40:24.000]  Robert Bob Chapman, age 76 of Winter Haven, Florida, formerly of Mexico, died Monday, June 4, 2012, due to pancreatic cancer.
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  He was born October 16, 1935 in Boston, Massachusetts.
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.000]  The son of John Chapman and Ruth Donnelly Chapman.
[40:31.000 --> 40:41.000]  Bob was a veteran of the U.S. Army, a writer of a newsletter discussing finances and economics, and a regular radio commentator discussing politics, as well as economics and finances.
[40:41.000 --> 40:48.000]  It was the international forecaster, for those of you who don't know, who's a great newsletter and a lot of people subscribe to it.
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  Most of his working life, he served as a stockbroker.
[40:51.000 --> 41:00.000]  Bob is survived by his wife of 47 years, Judith Judy Dabrowski Chapman, son Robert Michael Chapman, daughter Jennifer Galati and her husband, Matt.
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.000]  Sisters Dorothy Trekker and Joan Lotz and four grandchildren.
[41:04.000 --> 41:11.000]  Committal services are Wednesday, June 6, 2012 at 1 p.m. at Glen Abbey Memorial Gardens, so they're about to go on.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  Looks like about 20 minutes.
[41:13.000 --> 41:14.000]  Aubrandale, Florida.
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  Condolences may be sent to the family at Off Loughlin Funeral Home.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  And there's a lot of guestbook signings.
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  This is what I wrote.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  Our condolences to Bob's family.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  We have lost a great hero and true champion of freedom.
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  He will be missed.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  We love you, Bob.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  Alex Jones and the Infowars team.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  And I'm going to submit that now.
[41:32.000 --> 41:39.000]  And you can go read other guestbook signings from other people.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  Lots of people have been signing this.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  Bob, you'll be sorely missed.
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.000]  I tune in faithfully to RBN, GCN to catch Bob whenever he was a guest.
[41:47.000 --> 41:52.000]  I feel a personal sense of loss having never met him personally, but that's how much he touched my life.
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.000]  Our condolences to the Chapman family and thank you for sharing with us these years.
[41:56.000 --> 42:02.000]  We will miss your unparalleled wisdom and knowledge and delivered with a wonderful, calm voice.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  And that's one thing I think that we are going to really miss about Bob Chapman,
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  is the way he was able to bring us very serious news, news about our future.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  And he did it, you know, with love and compassion and a calmness
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  that I don't know a lot of people could deliver, you know, a lot of people.
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  It's hard.
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  It's hard to take this information being calm because it's pretty scary out there.
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.000]  But Bob was able to deliver it time and time again, you know, with that calm demeanor
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  and just that steadfastness that he'd been in this fight before and he knew what he was up against.
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  And he didn't care what the consequences were.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  And Bob died a free man.
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.000]  And that's what we should all strive to be.
[42:40.000 --> 42:41.000]  He dies free men.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  We do not want to die on our knees.
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  And if you don't want to die on your knees, you better listen to what Bob Chapman said
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  and go back and listen to these archives and listen to what he was talking about
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  because the man knew what he was talking about.
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  Alex, that's about all I have to say about Bob Chapman,
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  except we'll be bringing more to you about Bob.
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  And we'll go back to you now if we are still connected.
[43:03.000 --> 43:04.000]  Absolutely.
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  Roger, Roger Houston.
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  The Eagle is cruising down 35.
[43:08.000 --> 43:09.000]  You got us there.
[43:09.000 --> 43:10.000]  We got you.
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  Sounded loud and clear.
[43:12.000 --> 43:13.000]  Okay.
[43:13.000 --> 43:14.000]  Okay.
[43:14.000 --> 43:15.000]  Fantastic.
[43:15.000 --> 43:16.000]  Just so I don't have to do that, guys, you're doing a great job.
[43:16.000 --> 43:17.000]  All experimental.
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  If you're getting me just and do still talking, you guys just pop in and let me say,
[43:21.000 --> 43:26.000]  you know, say, uh, say, uh, purple possum, we have you or Eagle or whatever cool name
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  you want to give me.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  Purple possum is a lot cooler than Eagle, but the point is, is that, is that
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  I like purple possum.
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  Well, Roger, that general is pretty good.
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.000]  How about you call me, uh, uh, just say we got you live Woodpecker.
[43:40.000 --> 43:41.000]  How's that says?
[43:41.000 --> 43:42.000]  Woodpeck in the new world order.
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  That's, that's a better truck driving named Woodpecker.
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.000]  Wouldn't you agree, Richard?
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  Is that a super purple possum?
[43:48.000 --> 43:49.000]  All right.
[43:49.000 --> 43:50.000]  Supreme possum.
[43:50.000 --> 43:51.000]  All right.
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.000]  Uh, yeah, Bob, a fantastic guy.
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  And it's funny.
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  We have the 60th Jubilee of the Wicked, the globalist, Transylvania and Queen,
[44:00.000 --> 44:06.000]  literally 60th of Bilderberg and Bob dies the day after Bilderberg ends as they're being
[44:06.000 --> 44:07.000]  devastated.
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  I know Bob's looking down from Valhalla.
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  Very, very, very, very happy today.
[44:11.000 --> 44:12.000]  All right.
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  We got Skelton coming up in, we got to get started now with the data dump with Aaron
[44:17.000 --> 44:23.000]  Dykes right now, uh, with the Bilderberg documents 1966, Aaron recap it.
[44:23.000 --> 44:27.000]  Why do these are so important that they say national sovereignty is bad.
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.000]  Let NATO, you know, you in take over, use the threat of war as the pretext as they use
[44:32.000 --> 44:37.000]  World War One, World War Two, who the senator was the meeting, the wise men, Aaron Dykes,
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  you have the floor until we go to break Aaron Dykes, Bilderberg leaks, big breaking news,
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.000]  exclusive to infowars.com and prisonplanta.com, streaming video at prisonplanet.tv.
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  Aaron Dykes.
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  What we have Alex is a gigantic data dump from 1966, the Beast Fodden Bilderberg
[44:53.000 --> 44:56.000]  Conference in Germany right outside of Frankfurt.
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  It is a skeleton key to foreign policy, how we've been infiltrated and taken over within
[45:01.000 --> 45:05.000]  the United States by people who have whored the United States, who want to destroy it
[45:05.000 --> 45:06.000]  from within.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  Now you got to understand history.
[45:08.000 --> 45:17.000]  Bring back the robber baron, no revolution, the public hated them, but they learn how
[45:17.000 --> 45:22.400]  to use public relations to set up foundations that not only accelerated their power, but
[45:22.400 --> 45:27.000]  also gave them a good.
[45:27.000 --> 45:36.120]  Okay, as is with experimental radio, sometimes we do have dumpouts and as we're going with
[45:36.120 --> 45:39.400]  the data dump from Bilderberg, we had another dumpout.
[45:39.400 --> 45:42.120]  So we'll get back to Aaron as soon as we can.
[45:42.120 --> 45:45.920]  We've got another two hours and 15 minutes of the show left.
[45:45.920 --> 45:49.920]  And if not, you know, we're going to bring this information to you and high quality.
[45:49.920 --> 45:56.680]  We're just trying to get it out now as they're writing back in, back in from Bilderberg over
[45:56.680 --> 45:58.360]  a week and a half been gone actually.
[45:58.360 --> 46:03.040]  It's been, it's been a quiet office, but we've been working here hard, very hard.
[46:03.040 --> 46:08.800]  We've been getting the nightly news out to you guys as best we can, trying to find the
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.360]  stories that we think are going to matter to you guys out there the most.
[46:13.360 --> 46:15.720]  And it's been, it's been a lot of fun.
[46:15.720 --> 46:25.240]  Of course, we lost Bob Chapman, another, another hero and champion was Tom Crier.
[46:25.240 --> 46:26.920]  And I had something here from him.
[46:26.920 --> 46:32.800]  He also died on the same day as Bob Chapman, which is really odd when you have two champions
[46:32.800 --> 46:35.880]  of freedom fall on the same day.
[46:35.880 --> 46:38.880]  He was, he had been targeted by the IRS.
[46:38.880 --> 46:46.400]  He beat them in court and then he went on to find truth attack.org and was a fighter.
[46:46.400 --> 46:49.960]  We had, he was interviewed by Alex many times.
[46:49.960 --> 46:57.680]  I think we found an interview from 2009 yesterday and we're also going to give a tribute to
[46:57.680 --> 46:59.760]  Tommy Crier.
[46:59.760 --> 47:04.480]  In our world, obviously a lot of people knew Bob Chapman a lot more because he was here
[47:04.480 --> 47:05.720]  pretty much every Friday.
[47:05.720 --> 47:09.720]  As long as I've been here, Friday was Bob Chapman day.
[47:09.720 --> 47:16.520]  And in fact, our calendar, if you look on any of our calendars that had people listed,
[47:16.520 --> 47:20.880]  Bob Chapman was there every Friday for the last hour of the show, sometimes even two
[47:20.880 --> 47:22.400]  hours.
[47:22.400 --> 47:28.040]  And it was really a pleasure to listen to him go on about his battles, all the stories
[47:28.040 --> 47:29.120]  he had.
[47:29.120 --> 47:35.360]  And if you tuned in, you know, he, he coached Martin Sheen's kids and soccer.
[47:35.360 --> 47:37.720]  I mean, you know, where do you learn that?
[47:37.720 --> 47:40.800]  But on the shows, it was crazy.
[47:40.800 --> 47:43.600]  He saw some interesting video of Ronald Reagan.
[47:43.600 --> 47:44.600]  That was a very interesting show.
[47:44.600 --> 47:48.520]  If you want to go look up the archives on that one.
[47:48.520 --> 47:50.760]  But anyway, let's move on.
[47:50.760 --> 47:52.560]  I've got some more news here.
[47:52.560 --> 47:58.360]  This is out of Washington's blog, Fukushima Pacific Ocean will not dilute dumped radioactive
[47:58.360 --> 48:00.720]  water.
[48:00.720 --> 48:04.400]  The operator of the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant has been dumping something like
[48:04.400 --> 48:09.200]  a thousand tons per day of radioactive water in the Pacific Ocean.
[48:09.200 --> 48:12.680]  Remember that reactors are riddled with meltdown holes building for with more radiation than
[48:12.680 --> 48:17.520]  all the nuclear bombs ever dropped or tested is missing entire walls and building three
[48:17.520 --> 48:19.000]  is a pile of rubble.
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.560]  The whole complex is leaking like a sieve and the rivers of water being pumped into
[48:23.560 --> 48:27.400]  the reactors every day are just pouring into the ocean.
[48:27.400 --> 48:31.920]  So you can go read the full article there on Washington's blog and they have a shot.
[48:31.920 --> 48:39.280]  There's a shot of the radiation plume that is now, wow, look, there's Hawaii right there.
[48:39.280 --> 48:44.680]  So it's a, and that's crazy because Hawaii is a beautiful paradise, beautiful weather.
[48:44.680 --> 48:47.880]  I've never been there myself, but I've talked to several people who have lived there and
[48:47.880 --> 48:51.000]  they said it is unlike any place on earth.
[48:51.000 --> 48:57.960]  And hopefully they won't be too, too messed up from this, but it looks like it's, it's
[48:57.960 --> 49:04.800]  coming their way whenever the Google article, there's Bob Chapman, here's an interesting
[49:04.800 --> 49:05.800]  one.
[49:05.800 --> 49:06.800]  Okay.
[49:06.800 --> 49:07.800]  Oh yeah.
[49:07.800 --> 49:08.800]  There's the graphic.
[49:08.800 --> 49:09.800]  Oh, there, there's floating that.
[49:09.800 --> 49:10.800]  Wow.
[49:10.800 --> 49:13.800]  That's basically hitting Mexico and then it's flowing back up.
[49:13.800 --> 49:16.480]  It's just kind of rotating there in the ocean.
[49:16.480 --> 49:17.480]  Man.
[49:17.480 --> 49:18.480]  Wow.
[49:18.480 --> 49:21.520]  So look at that.
[49:21.520 --> 49:25.560]  I tell you, technology is very amazing at the things that we can look at from a different
[49:25.560 --> 49:29.880]  viewpoint and, and see these things over a long range.
[49:29.880 --> 49:35.480]  You know, this is not a short, so it looks like it, it brushed up against California.
[49:35.480 --> 49:41.280]  Now it's just going to kind of sit out there in the middle of the Pacific ocean between
[49:41.280 --> 49:43.880]  the U S and Hawaii.
[49:43.880 --> 49:45.880]  Man.
[49:45.880 --> 49:47.880]  That is tremendous.
[49:47.880 --> 49:50.560]  San Francisco to get pre-crime surveillance cameras.
[49:50.560 --> 49:55.920]  This is from Paul Joseph Watson and you can find this on info wars.com system alerts authorities
[49:55.920 --> 49:58.360]  to suspicious behavior.
[49:58.360 --> 49:59.880]  And we know they put stuff out.
[49:59.880 --> 50:01.080]  What is suspicious behavior?
[50:01.080 --> 50:04.360]  That's wearing a hoodie that is talking on a cell phone.
[50:04.360 --> 50:05.960]  That's taking photos.
[50:05.960 --> 50:08.400]  That's holding a notebook.
[50:08.400 --> 50:09.680]  That's paying with cash.
[50:09.680 --> 50:14.600]  Any of those things would be considered suspicious behavior under their mantra.
[50:14.600 --> 50:20.000]  So, you know, do you breathe air, do you drink water, hundreds of pre-crime surveillance
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.680]  cameras are to be installed in San Francisco's subway system that will analyze suspicious
[50:24.680 --> 50:29.720]  behavior and alert guards to potential criminal or terrorist activity before any crime has
[50:29.720 --> 50:30.720]  been committed.
[50:30.720 --> 50:35.800]  So let's say you go up to, you're looking this way, you're looking that way, where's
[50:35.800 --> 50:36.800]  my train coming?
[50:36.800 --> 50:37.800]  Is it coming this way?
[50:37.800 --> 50:38.800]  Is it coming?
[50:38.800 --> 50:39.800]  Wow.
[50:39.800 --> 50:40.800]  That's suspicious behavior.
[50:40.800 --> 50:43.000]  That could be suspicious behavior, looking both ways.
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.560]  What if you did it fast?
[50:44.560 --> 50:45.560]  You're a terrorist.
[50:45.560 --> 50:46.560]  All of a sudden, you're a terrorist.
[50:46.560 --> 50:48.560]  We're going to be back with more.
[50:48.560 --> 50:54.040]  We've got Alex and Aaron and the crew bolting down the highway back to the command center.
[50:54.040 --> 50:55.040]  And it's Infowars.com.

[54:02.540 --> 54:25.540]  On the road again, just can't wait to get on the road again.
[54:25.540 --> 54:29.540]  Alright, this is the Bilderberg Buster, Big Daddy Alex, riding down the road here.
[54:29.540 --> 54:34.540]  In an hour after Skelton and our TSA guests leave us with the Mitt Romney News at Bilderberg
[54:34.540 --> 54:37.540]  at infowars.com and the Leningardian as well.
[54:37.540 --> 54:39.540]  Well, it's ca.whatever.
[54:39.540 --> 54:40.540]  You can find it.
[54:40.540 --> 54:42.540]  It's easy to type in Charlie Skelton.
[54:42.540 --> 54:46.540]  He's coming up in about five minutes and then we'll get into these incredible documents
[54:46.540 --> 54:50.540]  in more detail coming up in the third hour today.
[54:50.540 --> 54:52.540]  Coming to you experimentally.
[54:52.540 --> 54:54.540]  It's working pretty darn well.
[54:54.540 --> 54:57.540]  I'm having a few hiccups here as we roll down the road.
[54:57.540 --> 55:01.540]  Rob do riding shotgun up there when we have technical problems.
[55:01.540 --> 55:06.540]  I'm going to hand the microphone back to Aaron Diggs for our emergency backup right now.
[55:06.540 --> 55:08.540]  Aaron, again, this is a big deal.
[55:08.540 --> 55:12.540]  Explain to people who the senator is, what these show, the handwritten notes.
[55:12.540 --> 55:14.540]  Watson's article coming out here soon.
[55:14.540 --> 55:15.540]  Right.
[55:15.540 --> 55:20.540]  We got a huge data leak from the 1966 V-spot in Germany, Bilderberg Conference.
[55:20.540 --> 55:23.540]  It's from the private library of Senator Fred Harris.
[55:23.540 --> 55:25.540]  He's an Oklahoma senator.
[55:25.540 --> 55:30.540]  He was in office about two years when he got invited personally by Prince Bernhardt of the Netherlands.
[55:30.540 --> 55:33.540]  We have a signature on the document inviting him out to Germany.
[55:33.540 --> 55:36.540]  And he was getting a reeducation in how great it is.
[55:36.540 --> 55:38.540]  And it's all marked restricted.
[55:38.540 --> 55:43.540]  It's all marked restricted, but we got it because of a leak through a union worker who wanted to expose
[55:43.540 --> 55:49.540]  that the union was meeting there along with David Rockefeller, all the top Europeans, and the rest of it.
[55:49.540 --> 55:51.540]  And it's clear they hate nationalism.
[55:51.540 --> 55:59.540]  It's literally in the handwriting of Senator Fred Harris' notes, page after page of diplomat after diplomat bashing sovereignty.
[55:59.540 --> 56:02.540]  One of the biggest of those is John J. McCoy.
[56:02.540 --> 56:09.540]  He's a skull and bones member, a top wise man, a acolyte under Avril Harriman and his buddy Prescott Bush,
[56:09.540 --> 56:15.540]  who literally funded Nazis and founded them with Prince Bernhardt.
[56:15.540 --> 56:20.540]  Both John J. McCoy and Prince Bernhardt were on the IG Farben Board.
[56:20.540 --> 56:23.540]  John J. McCoy, of course, was a lawyer to IG Farben.
[56:23.540 --> 56:31.540]  That's the big industrial backbone of the Nazi mechanism, which was really just to get the European Union underway,
[56:31.540 --> 56:33.540]  bind them all together.
[56:33.540 --> 56:39.540]  And they talk repeatedly about how awful nationalism is, how people like De Gaulle of France were reviving nationalism,
[56:39.540 --> 56:46.540]  how it might spread to Germany, and repeatedly talks about how we can't go back to a pre-1914 mentality.
[56:46.540 --> 56:51.540]  That means before World War I, when they began formal world government mechanisms.
[56:51.540 --> 56:55.540]  Now, in 1966, I've been able to examine the documents now.
[56:55.540 --> 56:57.540]  They were looking to strengthen NATO.
[56:57.540 --> 56:59.540]  That's the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
[56:59.540 --> 57:06.540]  Today, that is the military that launches the wars in Libya about to watch a war in Syria.
[57:06.540 --> 57:12.540]  But back then, they were trying to make it a viable opposition to the Soviet threat,
[57:12.540 --> 57:16.540]  but also to help integrate Europe more and more.
[57:16.540 --> 57:18.540]  This apparently is the better microphone.
[57:18.540 --> 57:21.540]  I don't know. There's two mics. I'm shoving them both of your face.
[57:21.540 --> 57:22.540]  That's the better mic.
[57:22.540 --> 57:30.540]  Again, we have notes here about how awful nationalism is, about how going back to a pre-1914 mentality is very dangerous.
[57:30.540 --> 57:32.540]  And again, they're meeting in Wiesbaden, Germany.
[57:32.540 --> 57:38.540]  In 1966, we had the leaks from Bilderberg, signatures from Prince Bernhardt, the founder, and the rest of them.
[57:38.540 --> 57:44.540]  And it explains how they were trying to reorganize NATO to make it a stronger military body,
[57:44.540 --> 57:48.540]  but also to use it as a mechanism to integrate Europe.
[57:48.540 --> 57:53.540]  Furthermore, they were meeting on the future of world economic development,
[57:53.540 --> 57:56.540]  both in the industrial and so-called developing world.
[57:56.540 --> 58:03.540]  That's one of the big reasons why the Union head, the biggest head of the United Auto Workers, Walter P. Royther,
[58:03.540 --> 58:08.540]  was there meeting with the United Nations Conference and Trade and Development Organization,
[58:08.540 --> 58:14.540]  the International Ford Foundation, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, GATT, you name it.
[58:14.540 --> 58:19.540]  All the important players who were there, the capitalists, meet with the so-called Union socialists,
[58:19.540 --> 58:21.540]  all to bring about world government.
[58:21.540 --> 58:24.540]  They wanted to make it big time. This is a snapshot in time.
[58:24.540 --> 58:29.540]  We're talking about the synthesis here. Good.
[58:29.540 --> 58:33.540]  I'm taking us out here. Are we Roger? Roger? Over, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:33.540 --> 58:34.540]  You are on.
[58:34.540 --> 58:39.540]  All right. Fantastic. All right. Charlie Skelton, straight ahead. Stay with us.
[58:39.540 --> 59:06.540]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:10.540 --> 59:14.540]  There's no priming required. It's NSF 42 certified.
[59:14.540 --> 59:18.540]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[59:18.540 --> 59:21.540]  Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity.
[59:21.540 --> 59:24.540]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[59:24.540 --> 59:27.540]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[59:27.540 --> 59:31.540]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[59:31.540 --> 59:34.540]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[59:34.540 --> 59:39.540]  It's what my family uses. Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propure.
[59:39.540 --> 59:45.540]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[59:45.540 --> 1:00:04.540]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[1:00:04.540 --> 1:00:17.540]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.540 --> 1:00:23.540]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.540 --> 1:00:28.540]  We have two big breaking news items here for you.
[1:00:28.540 --> 1:00:36.540]  One of them is bombshell and contemporary to our time, Charlie Skelton, excellent record of amazing sources and accuracy,
[1:00:36.540 --> 1:00:41.540]  as four sources from inside the hotel after they were treated like total garbage, not given tips,
[1:00:41.540 --> 1:00:44.540]  told not to look in Bilderberg's eyes, say that Mitt Romney was there.
[1:00:44.540 --> 1:00:47.540]  We know he was on the West Coast, being fundraiser Saturday and Sunday.
[1:00:47.540 --> 1:00:49.540]  That doesn't mean he wasn't there at Thursday.
[1:00:49.540 --> 1:00:54.540]  We saw lots of secret service, machine guns, Marines, all the standard garbage.
[1:00:54.540 --> 1:00:59.540]  That's when Hillary and Obama were there four years ago at the same hotel.
[1:00:59.540 --> 1:01:02.540]  He's going to be with us for at least 30 minutes with that breaking news.
[1:01:02.540 --> 1:01:05.540]  Then, I'm talking to the big guardian. They can get this out.
[1:01:05.540 --> 1:01:11.540]  The BBC reported years ago on leaks from the 54 and 55 meetings that only happened five, six years ago,
[1:01:11.540 --> 1:01:14.540]  on their meetings about wanting an EU and a big NATO.
[1:01:14.540 --> 1:01:21.540]  We got the 66 documents from the Internal Archives from a leaker who's angry about the big unions,
[1:01:21.540 --> 1:01:25.540]  the United Auto Workers inside there in 66 selling them out.
[1:01:25.540 --> 1:01:29.540]  A few of these are the hundreds of pages we were able to look up.
[1:01:29.540 --> 1:01:31.540]  They've already been released by others who were at the meeting.
[1:01:31.540 --> 1:01:35.540]  These are the private papers of the Senator from Oklahoma.
[1:01:35.540 --> 1:01:37.540]  We're going to be talking about that with Charlie as well,
[1:01:37.540 --> 1:01:41.540]  hoping that the Guardian gets it out because it will go worldwide at that point.
[1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:44.540]  Infowars has watched him breaking it in a matter of minutes.
[1:01:44.540 --> 1:01:47.540]  Charlie Skelton, I salute you. We're about to go to break.
[1:01:47.540 --> 1:01:50.540]  Some stations don't carry this segment, so we'll recap after the break.
[1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:55.540]  You just got back last night, slept a few hours. You're gracious to come on, writing for the Guardian.
[1:01:55.540 --> 1:02:01.540]  Charlie, what can you say in synopsis of this year before we go to break and come back with the Mitt Romney News?
[1:02:01.540 --> 1:02:05.540]  Well, just very briefly, a lot of energy there was. You were there, you saw it.
[1:02:05.540 --> 1:02:08.540]  I mean, incredible. Just a difference again.
[1:02:08.540 --> 1:02:13.540]  It keeps going exponentially up in terms of the amount of activists, the amount of reporting that goes on.
[1:02:13.540 --> 1:02:19.540]  It was just incredible energy, incredible noise, incredible warmth of the crowd.
[1:02:19.540 --> 1:02:24.540]  Just a great time.
[1:02:24.540 --> 1:02:27.540]  Do you think Bilderberg's happy from all of your sources inside?
[1:02:27.540 --> 1:02:30.540]  According to you and your sources, Tucker's sources and my sources,
[1:02:30.540 --> 1:02:34.540]  the Bilderbergs have never been this angry, frothing mad.
[1:02:34.540 --> 1:02:38.540]  Well, I get the sense that is true, and I feel a bit bad.
[1:02:38.540 --> 1:02:41.540]  I mean, right at the end, the Bilderberg staff, you may have seen this photo,
[1:02:41.540 --> 1:02:46.540]  were lining up to have their final kind of souvenir snap.
[1:02:46.540 --> 1:02:52.540]  And just at that moment, up walks, you know, Luke Radowski with a camera,
[1:02:52.540 --> 1:02:57.540]  and then some people from We Are Change and what have you,
[1:02:57.540 --> 1:03:00.540]  and sort of taking their photo, getting their own souvenir.
[1:03:00.540 --> 1:03:03.540]  And, you know, I just felt like, I've almost felt sorry for them at that point,
[1:03:03.540 --> 1:03:07.540]  because, you know, it was the amount of pressure that was put on them from outside.
[1:03:07.540 --> 1:03:11.540]  The amount of pressure to have this story break has been considerable this year.
[1:03:11.540 --> 1:03:16.540]  But our source confirmed that they were rooting for you, myself and others,
[1:03:16.540 --> 1:03:20.540]  inside watching us on video feeds, that the staff actually loved it.
[1:03:20.540 --> 1:03:26.540]  Yeah, I mean, you know, obviously, they've been given the three-line whip to stay quiet,
[1:03:26.540 --> 1:03:30.540]  but, you know, some of them don't stay quiet, and some of them have been talking.
[1:03:30.540 --> 1:03:35.540]  And it's very interesting the stuff you can pick up, I tell you that much.
[1:03:35.540 --> 1:03:37.540]  Well, this is absolutely incredible.
[1:03:37.540 --> 1:03:39.540]  We're going to break Charlie here in a minute or two.
[1:03:39.540 --> 1:03:42.540]  When we come back, I'm going to give you the floor on your Big Mitt Romney story,
[1:03:42.540 --> 1:03:46.540]  but other tidbits you're going to be covering when we come back.
[1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:50.540]  Oh, yeah, I've got, well, just a few little bits and bobs just from the staff.
[1:03:50.540 --> 1:03:55.540]  It's just interesting, getting a little bit of color from inside, you know, just to give you a...
[1:03:55.540 --> 1:03:59.540]  I mean, I can't believe we're reduced to this, but, you know, I've got some,
[1:03:59.540 --> 1:04:02.540]  some, you know, little things, which are interesting, you know, nothing...
[1:04:02.540 --> 1:04:05.540]  Obviously, there's the Romney story, which, you know, I think it is big,
[1:04:05.540 --> 1:04:09.540]  and it's been picked, you know, it's going to be picked up as a guy, Kenneth Vogel, from Politico.com,
[1:04:09.540 --> 1:04:11.540]  who's tweeted, who's just tweeted it.
[1:04:11.540 --> 1:04:16.540]  So it's now sort of, you know, the mainstream is sniffing around it.
[1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:22.540]  Well, I have sources high up in the media, and they say that Romney's people told him a week ago
[1:04:22.540 --> 1:04:26.540]  he was not going to be attending, well, really, two weeks ago, and then again a week ago.
[1:04:26.540 --> 1:04:33.540]  And so if they are lying to even media that's been quasi-friendly to them, that is really a bad move.
[1:04:33.540 --> 1:04:38.540]  Yeah, I mean, obviously, now this, you know, I mean, this story does depend upon the, the,
[1:04:38.540 --> 1:04:43.540]  the eyewitness accounts, but I, you know, I, these are four eyewitnesses,
[1:04:43.540 --> 1:04:45.540]  they're all four separate people, three of them.
[1:04:45.540 --> 1:04:47.540]  No, no, no, they've proven very accurate in the past.
[1:04:47.540 --> 1:04:50.540]  These, absolutely, and I've got more people, I've got to run down.
[1:04:50.540 --> 1:04:54.540]  Stay there, Charlie Skelton straight ahead, big story, met Romney,
[1:04:54.540 --> 1:05:03.540]  Bilderberg 2012, he's with The Guardian, Google his names, Charlie Skelton.
[1:05:25.540 --> 1:05:29.540]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:05:29.540 --> 1:05:32.540]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:05:32.540 --> 1:05:36.540]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:05:36.540 --> 1:05:41.540]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:05:41.540 --> 1:05:46.540]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[1:05:46.540 --> 1:05:50.540]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:05:50.540 --> 1:05:52.540]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[1:06:02.540 --> 1:06:07.540]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans,
[1:06:07.540 --> 1:06:10.540]  here is the Cal Bend Soap Company.
[1:06:10.540 --> 1:06:14.540]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[1:08:19.540 --> 1:08:24.540]  They've got me running two Skypes, a Comrex.
[1:08:24.540 --> 1:08:26.540]  I'm texting to communicate with them.
[1:08:26.540 --> 1:08:28.540]  Actually, an astronaut does stuff about 100 times harder.
[1:08:28.540 --> 1:08:31.540]  But I tell you, I'm getting to where I just don't blow up like I used to.
[1:08:31.540 --> 1:08:32.540]  I'm kind of getting used to this.
[1:08:32.540 --> 1:08:34.540]  I love going on the road, Richard.
[1:08:34.540 --> 1:08:37.540]  And now that we can just drive while we do it.
[1:08:37.540 --> 1:08:39.540]  Now you're talking.
[1:08:39.540 --> 1:08:44.540]  Charlie Skelton, we salute his work in the last four or five years covering Bilderberg.
[1:08:44.540 --> 1:08:48.540]  He's come a long way from first reporting on it to see if it was even real,
[1:08:48.540 --> 1:08:51.540]  to being arrested, detained, harassed, going down the rabbit hole.
[1:08:51.540 --> 1:08:56.540]  He just got back to Britannia, back to airstrip one last night to the UK.
[1:08:56.540 --> 1:08:58.540]  Got a few hours sleep and is joining us.
[1:08:58.540 --> 1:09:00.540]  He's got big breaking news.
[1:09:00.540 --> 1:09:02.540]  He got a bunch of sources inside.
[1:09:02.540 --> 1:09:06.540]  He handed out.
[1:09:06.540 --> 1:09:07.540]  All right.
[1:09:07.540 --> 1:09:10.540]  I think once again, we've had another little glitch.
[1:09:10.540 --> 1:09:12.540]  Well, we were talking to him all during break, too.
[1:09:12.540 --> 1:09:15.540]  And that was coming, coming loud and clear.
[1:09:15.540 --> 1:09:16.540]  All right.
[1:09:16.540 --> 1:09:17.540]  Here he goes.
[1:09:17.540 --> 1:09:18.540]  Go ahead.
[1:09:18.540 --> 1:09:21.540]  Back again, hurtling down the road here.
[1:09:21.540 --> 1:09:23.540]  He has sources inside.
[1:09:23.540 --> 1:09:25.540]  Four sources meant Romney inside.
[1:09:25.540 --> 1:09:28.540]  Obama said he wasn't in Bilderberg four years ago.
[1:09:28.540 --> 1:09:29.540]  Now they admit it.
[1:09:29.540 --> 1:09:30.540]  So this is big.
[1:09:30.540 --> 1:09:32.540]  Also, Mitch Daniels, the Bilderberg group likes.
[1:09:32.540 --> 1:09:34.540]  That doesn't mean absolutely it's going to happen.
[1:09:34.540 --> 1:09:39.540]  But Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, George W. Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush, excuse me.
[1:09:39.540 --> 1:09:41.540]  Charlie Skelton, the London Guardian.
[1:09:41.540 --> 1:09:42.540]  You've got the floor.
[1:09:42.540 --> 1:09:45.540]  Give us the data dump of what's in your article.
[1:09:45.540 --> 1:09:49.540]  Another little tidbits that aren't in the big Guardian story going viral right now.
[1:09:49.540 --> 1:09:51.540]  Mitt Romney at Bilderberg 2012.
[1:09:51.540 --> 1:09:57.540]  Before I give you our big data, and we've got the documents, the 1966 minutes of the meeting.
[1:09:57.540 --> 1:09:59.540]  So Charlie Skelton, London Guardian.
[1:09:59.540 --> 1:10:01.540]  Well, I'm very excited about the 1966 minutes.
[1:10:01.540 --> 1:10:09.540]  But I'm just going to say that, yeah, we were there in the hotel after the, after the event.
[1:10:09.540 --> 1:10:12.540]  As it kind of winds down, you know, it's a, it's a big event.
[1:10:12.540 --> 1:10:15.540]  It takes a lot of organization, so there's a lot of people still milling around.
[1:10:15.540 --> 1:10:18.540]  Anyway, we spoke to, you know, just had a chat.
[1:10:18.540 --> 1:10:20.540]  We had a chat with some of the hotel staff.
[1:10:20.540 --> 1:10:25.540]  And I've got four eyewitnesses that placed Mitt Romney inside the hotel during Bilderberg.
[1:10:25.540 --> 1:10:32.540]  And three of the, I want to point this out that three of those eyewitnesses also confirmed Bill Gates.
[1:10:32.540 --> 1:10:36.540]  And that's also been confirmed by the Washington Post as well, who saw him.
[1:10:36.540 --> 1:10:38.540]  And a lot of activists saw him come out.
[1:10:38.540 --> 1:10:45.540]  So anyway, take that for what, you know, with as much, for as much seriousness as you want.
[1:10:45.540 --> 1:10:46.540]  I mean, I think, I believe them.
[1:10:46.540 --> 1:10:47.540]  I said, you know, are you sure?
[1:10:47.540 --> 1:10:48.540]  Well, he was on the list.
[1:10:48.540 --> 1:10:51.540]  And they said, yeah, they said, yeah, he was there, but it was Mitt Romney.
[1:10:51.540 --> 1:10:54.540]  So, you know, I had it confirmed four times.
[1:10:54.540 --> 1:10:56.540]  And yeah, they're not on the list.
[1:10:56.540 --> 1:11:01.540]  So as I said in my piece, I mean, can we, can we just stop talking about this list as if it's the Beall and Endall?
[1:11:01.540 --> 1:11:03.540]  Yes, it's very interesting.
[1:11:03.540 --> 1:11:05.540]  And it tells you pretty much most of the people who are there.
[1:11:05.540 --> 1:11:11.540]  But there's always people they bring in, you know, from the outside, you just, you know, who don't want to be on the list.
[1:11:11.540 --> 1:11:21.540]  Charlie, Charlie, that's a fabulous point you make that you've usually got about 125, 130 that are on the list.
[1:11:21.540 --> 1:11:25.540]  But there's usually 20, 30, 40, sometimes even 50 who aren't.
[1:11:25.540 --> 1:11:29.540]  And they're the most important Chinese ambassadors, Obama, Hillary.
[1:11:29.540 --> 1:11:37.540]  And yes, I saw Bill Gates couldn't get the snap properly because I was busy bullhorning many others.
[1:11:37.540 --> 1:11:38.540]  I saw Kissinger.
[1:11:38.540 --> 1:11:40.540]  We did get a photo of him.
[1:11:40.540 --> 1:11:46.540]  But Gates and Romney both were not on the list, but we know Gates was there because the Washington Post has now been blown.
[1:11:46.540 --> 1:11:48.540]  They've always been there since 54.
[1:11:48.540 --> 1:11:53.540]  They now have to admit that people like Charles Krauthammer and others have been there and they were indeed there and Gates was there.
[1:11:53.540 --> 1:12:02.540]  So just amazing information where now even the globalists are scooping themselves because the alternative media forced by the DrudgeReport.com,
[1:12:02.540 --> 1:12:04.540]  London Guardian and others.
[1:12:04.540 --> 1:12:12.540]  I've got to say the DrudgeReport, London Guardian, Washington Times, you guys, even more than infowars.com and the protesters finally rammed the door down.
[1:12:12.540 --> 1:12:14.540]  But please continue.
[1:12:14.540 --> 1:12:22.540]  Yeah, well, I'm just, how pleased was I when my editor at The Guardian sent another journalist, you know, a journalist from Washington to turn up as well.
[1:12:22.540 --> 1:12:26.540]  And, you know, he went through, he didn't really know much about Bilderberg.
[1:12:26.540 --> 1:12:31.540]  He turned up, you know, three days later, you know, he's coming up to speed on this whole thing.
[1:12:31.540 --> 1:12:38.540]  And you can, he went through his own kind of super fast education, you know, because just to me, you go there and it's the whole thing as an education.
[1:12:38.540 --> 1:12:40.540]  I mean, it was extraordinary.
[1:12:40.540 --> 1:12:46.540]  People like you or Webster Tarpley just standing around outside, you know, people that know a lot of stuff, you know, about this.
[1:12:46.540 --> 1:12:54.540]  There's an amazing kind of information sharing, you know, we've met some really incredible people. As usual, every time we go to Bilderberg, we meet, you know, people who are incredibly switched on,
[1:12:54.540 --> 1:12:59.540]  incredibly up to speed with their global politics and their global history.
[1:12:59.540 --> 1:13:04.540]  And, you know, it's just a joy to spend time around those people for a week.
[1:13:04.540 --> 1:13:06.540]  Actually, what's not a joy though, you're spending time in it.
[1:13:06.540 --> 1:13:11.540]  It had a very, you know, the warm energy outside, but also there's a dark energy to Chantilly.
[1:13:11.540 --> 1:13:15.540]  You know, this thing is surrounded by these vast, shiny arms companies.
[1:13:15.540 --> 1:13:22.540]  And, you know, you go inside and you sit in the hotel and you just listen to people from NASA or people from, you know, General Dynamics,
[1:13:22.540 --> 1:13:28.540]  just talking about the sort of military contracts that have been, you know, divided up 30 million here, whatever.
[1:13:28.540 --> 1:13:33.540]  And, you know, he left the Army and went to L3 and then he's back at CACI.
[1:13:33.540 --> 1:13:41.540]  And it's just this vast whirlpool of bad money,
[1:13:41.540 --> 1:13:46.540]  and it's just a ploshing of infinitely large money, sloshing around the venue today.
[1:13:46.540 --> 1:13:49.540]  You know, last year it was up in the Alps, it was beautiful.
[1:13:49.540 --> 1:13:50.540]  You could stare at the mountains.
[1:13:50.540 --> 1:13:53.540]  This year you could stare at the front of General Dynamics.
[1:13:53.540 --> 1:13:54.540]  So, yeah.
[1:13:54.540 --> 1:13:57.540]  And a giant NSA substation.
[1:13:57.540 --> 1:13:59.540]  And a giant NSA substation.
[1:13:59.540 --> 1:14:05.540]  Now, give us more about the Mitt Romney, what this means, specifically what your sources said to you,
[1:14:05.540 --> 1:14:07.540]  the little tidbits, the little giblets.
[1:14:07.540 --> 1:14:09.540]  The little giblets.
[1:14:09.540 --> 1:14:13.540]  Well, I mean, the main thing, I just wanted that confirmed.
[1:14:13.540 --> 1:14:17.540]  And because, you know, it's very difficult, because then you have to speculate.
[1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:20.540]  And people say, well, okay, you just, you know, what do you do?
[1:14:20.540 --> 1:14:21.540]  They're right.
[1:14:21.540 --> 1:14:22.540]  Yeah, of course we are.
[1:14:22.540 --> 1:14:25.540]  You know, we've got our best, we've dug in, we've got our best bit of information.
[1:14:25.540 --> 1:14:28.540]  You know, that's as good as a piece of information as you can get.
[1:14:28.540 --> 1:14:30.540]  So now you have to speculate.
[1:14:30.540 --> 1:14:34.540]  You know that Governor Daniels was there.
[1:14:34.540 --> 1:14:39.540]  You know, that makes you, you know, that's what the Webster Diplomacy was saying.
[1:14:39.540 --> 1:14:42.540]  He thinks that they want a Romney Daniels ticket.
[1:14:42.540 --> 1:14:47.540]  But, you know, it rather depends upon how, you know, Mitt Romney went down at dinner.
[1:14:47.540 --> 1:14:49.540]  You know, did he perform well?
[1:14:49.540 --> 1:14:50.540]  Did he say the right things?
[1:14:50.540 --> 1:14:51.540]  Did he shake the right hand?
[1:14:51.540 --> 1:14:57.540]  You know, I mean, obviously time will tell.
[1:14:57.540 --> 1:14:59.540]  That's what we've gotten.
[1:14:59.540 --> 1:15:04.540]  In fact, if we can move the next guest to 40 after, I've got to get all the data that Charlie can give us.
[1:15:04.540 --> 1:15:09.540]  Well, but I've got to have Aaron brief him as well on this U.S.
[1:15:09.540 --> 1:15:10.540]  Senator's Notes.
[1:15:10.540 --> 1:15:15.540]  He's still alive from his private library in the National Archives, smuggled out to us with never
[1:15:15.540 --> 1:15:19.540]  distribute, never publish, restricted copyright all over it.
[1:15:19.540 --> 1:15:21.540]  Hey, you're at a meeting making policy, buddy.
[1:15:21.540 --> 1:15:22.540]  We're releasing all this.
[1:15:22.540 --> 1:15:28.540]  And this is big because it shows him writing notes saying, you know, on the, you know,
[1:15:28.540 --> 1:15:30.540]  the meeting's documents.
[1:15:30.540 --> 1:15:32.540]  Oh, thank you, sirs, for teaching me.
[1:15:32.540 --> 1:15:34.540]  And it's the wise men and the rest of it.
[1:15:34.540 --> 1:15:36.540]  We're going to get to that after the break.
[1:15:36.540 --> 1:15:40.540]  But Charlie Skelton, what else can you tell us about Mitt Romney there?
[1:15:40.540 --> 1:15:43.540]  And what else your sources told you about calling us cockroaches?
[1:15:43.540 --> 1:15:47.540]  Because my sources confirmed that, but that was our name that they gave us.
[1:15:47.540 --> 1:15:50.540]  But that also they didn't give people tips.
[1:15:50.540 --> 1:15:54.540]  And they were very, very angry that the Bilderberg Group was particularly surly.
[1:15:54.540 --> 1:15:58.540]  Yeah, we heard also that the Bilderberg Group were bugging the, this is from the staff,
[1:15:58.540 --> 1:16:00.540]  were bugging the staff's phone.
[1:16:00.540 --> 1:16:02.540]  We also, it's very interesting.
[1:16:02.540 --> 1:16:04.540]  I mean, this is this, I don't know.
[1:16:04.540 --> 1:16:08.540]  I spoke to a lot of the people who cleaned the rooms and all of them were on vacation
[1:16:08.540 --> 1:16:09.540]  at the same time.
[1:16:09.540 --> 1:16:11.540]  I couldn't find one that was working at the weekend.
[1:16:11.540 --> 1:16:15.540]  So I get the sense that they clean, they get rid of the cleaners because they don't want
[1:16:15.540 --> 1:16:19.540]  people going into their rooms and they bring in their own, which is slightly bizarre.
[1:16:19.540 --> 1:16:23.540]  But it's interesting bit of, if it's true, which I think, you know, my straw poll suggested
[1:16:23.540 --> 1:16:29.540]  it was, that's an interesting, you know, a little bit of backstory for how it all worked.
[1:16:29.540 --> 1:16:33.540]  But yeah, I know it's interesting, we could see things like Niall Ferguson, the historian,
[1:16:33.540 --> 1:16:37.540]  the guy who's, you know, Kissinger, the official biographer, very much one of them,
[1:16:37.540 --> 1:16:41.540]  you know, coming out with a copy of Cheng Li's book on China.
[1:16:41.540 --> 1:16:43.540]  Cheng Li, the Brookings Institute who is there.
[1:16:43.540 --> 1:16:49.540]  So, you know, they've been discussing China, China's, the Chinese delegates are there again
[1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:53.540]  this year, being buffed in.
[1:16:53.540 --> 1:16:59.540]  So, yeah, it's, you know, we're getting a sort of, a little bit of, a little bit of,
[1:16:59.540 --> 1:17:01.540]  a little bit of the sense of what they're discussing.
[1:17:01.540 --> 1:17:04.540]  Obviously we have to piece this together, you know, with what we can.
[1:17:04.540 --> 1:17:08.540]  But it was just so great to see people pushing from a different side.
[1:17:08.540 --> 1:17:13.540]  You know, people like Presbyterus thought we are change and, you know, in for wars.
[1:17:13.540 --> 1:17:16.540]  And everyone just sort of knocking on the door and the more you push, the more you hear,
[1:17:16.540 --> 1:17:18.540]  the more you pick up.
[1:17:18.540 --> 1:17:22.540]  So, you know, stuff like the cockroaches thing, which I was genuinely quite shocked when I heard it.
[1:17:22.540 --> 1:17:27.540]  But, you know, the guy, there was a guy there, Sky Adams, who's a live streamer,
[1:17:27.540 --> 1:17:30.540]  who just said, you know what, they're calling his cockroaches, well, we're indestructible.
[1:17:30.540 --> 1:17:32.540]  And the cockroaches, he can't get rid of them, they keep coming back.
[1:17:32.540 --> 1:17:38.540]  So, you know, there's a spin there.
[1:17:38.540 --> 1:17:41.540]  Hello.
[1:17:41.540 --> 1:17:42.540]  Can you hear me now, Charlie?
[1:17:42.540 --> 1:17:43.540]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[1:17:43.540 --> 1:17:45.540]  Fantastic.
[1:17:45.540 --> 1:17:46.540]  No, no, no, you were there.
[1:17:46.540 --> 1:17:47.540]  Fantastic points.
[1:17:47.540 --> 1:17:51.540]  I want to confirm that four years ago when I was inside for days before they kicked us out,
[1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:54.540]  and this year I confirmed, we even had dinner with some of the staff.
[1:17:54.540 --> 1:17:59.540]  I'll just leave it at that, very late at night, that they told the staff your phones are tapped
[1:17:59.540 --> 1:18:03.540]  and they had NSA and private contractors, and I've witnessed this with my own eyes,
[1:18:03.540 --> 1:18:07.540]  four years ago, in there listening to people in the hotel from the site.
[1:18:07.540 --> 1:18:12.540]  And that's why they like it, is because they can bring in all the NSA people on the scene.
[1:18:12.540 --> 1:18:15.540]  And we had our cell phones running down double time.
[1:18:15.540 --> 1:18:18.540]  That's how you know, too, when they're tapping your phone.
[1:18:18.540 --> 1:18:19.540]  Right, right.
[1:18:19.540 --> 1:18:23.540]  Yeah, I mean, one of the people also at the hotel, I'm not going to say which people,
[1:18:23.540 --> 1:18:25.540]  but, you know, because I don't want them losing their jobs.
[1:18:25.540 --> 1:18:29.540]  But one of them said, we've got Chastain and he was saying, yeah, there's, you know,
[1:18:29.540 --> 1:18:32.540]  two to three hundred security inside the hotel.
[1:18:32.540 --> 1:18:38.540]  I mean, it's a very, very high-tech, highly staffed security operation.
[1:18:38.540 --> 1:18:40.540]  I don't tell anyone one little interesting thing.
[1:18:40.540 --> 1:18:45.540]  We, late on the, late on the Sunday, we were just standing at the back gate,
[1:18:45.540 --> 1:18:51.540]  and this, this, you know, a dark window at SUV and a huge coach comes down
[1:18:51.540 --> 1:18:56.540]  to blast out of the back door, a big black tinted coach.
[1:18:56.540 --> 1:19:00.540]  And we looked at the company that ran the coach and it's an entertainment company.
[1:19:00.540 --> 1:19:03.540]  So I think the act, I think they had a, I think they had some entertainment.
[1:19:03.540 --> 1:19:05.540]  Somebody, somebody sang at their supper.
[1:19:05.540 --> 1:19:09.540]  I don't know who, but I'd be curious to know.
[1:19:09.540 --> 1:19:10.540]  Yeah, they do that.
[1:19:10.540 --> 1:19:12.540]  I saw that big, absolutely.
[1:19:12.540 --> 1:19:15.540]  I saw that big black, I saw the big black bus or coach
[1:19:15.540 --> 1:19:19.540]  that you were talking about back there continuing here.
[1:19:19.540 --> 1:19:23.540]  What are some of the other tidbits concerning them being mean to the staff,
[1:19:23.540 --> 1:19:25.540]  not tipping them?
[1:19:25.540 --> 1:19:28.540]  Yeah, and also not talking to them, you know.
[1:19:28.540 --> 1:19:32.540]  I think they keep a, they keep a distance, you know.
[1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:34.540]  They don't, I mean, you just said they don't even have their own,
[1:19:34.540 --> 1:19:36.540]  they have their own cleaning stuff.
[1:19:36.540 --> 1:19:38.540]  So, you know, I don't think they're a fun bunch.
[1:19:38.540 --> 1:19:40.540]  You know, I really don't get that sense.
[1:19:40.540 --> 1:19:42.540]  You know, it's a very serious event.
[1:19:42.540 --> 1:19:44.540]  People often talk about it as, you know, they're just having a,
[1:19:44.540 --> 1:19:46.540]  a knees up, it's a bit of a jolly.
[1:19:46.540 --> 1:19:48.540]  And you know, no, it's really not.
[1:19:48.540 --> 1:19:52.540]  It's a tightly scheduled conference for three days.
[1:19:52.540 --> 1:19:55.540]  You know, I want to ask, I want to ask a member of the mainstream news media
[1:19:55.540 --> 1:19:56.540]  to tell me...
[1:19:56.540 --> 1:19:57.540]  Stay there.
[1:19:57.540 --> 1:19:58.540]  Nope, okay.
[1:19:58.540 --> 1:19:59.540]  We're going to cover when we come back.
[1:19:59.540 --> 1:20:01.540]  We're going to cover when we come back.
[1:20:01.540 --> 1:20:02.540]  I had tried everything.
[1:20:02.540 --> 1:20:04.540]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[1:20:04.540 --> 1:20:07.540]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[1:20:07.540 --> 1:20:12.540]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[1:20:12.540 --> 1:20:17.540]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[1:20:17.540 --> 1:20:19.540]  and be satisfied.
[1:20:19.540 --> 1:20:22.540]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com,
[1:20:22.540 --> 1:20:30.540]  but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[1:20:30.540 --> 1:20:34.540]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound.
[1:20:34.540 --> 1:20:37.540]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[1:20:37.540 --> 1:20:40.540]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[1:20:40.540 --> 1:20:42.540]  Now, that's results.

[1:24:35.540 --> 1:24:42.540]  Yeah, Bilderberg.
[1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:48.540]  You know the judge said, just one more boy.
[1:24:48.540 --> 1:24:58.540]  And none of the state troopers got us either. It's even better.
[1:24:58.540 --> 1:25:01.540]  I got written up for a 90 the other day.
[1:25:01.540 --> 1:25:05.540]  They didn't catch me 22nd before at 125.
[1:25:05.540 --> 1:25:07.540]  I'm just joking.
[1:25:07.540 --> 1:25:09.540]  Product, huh, folks?
[1:25:09.540 --> 1:25:13.540]  55! Yeah!
[1:25:13.540 --> 1:25:18.540]  Charlie Skelton with us. About another 15 minutes or so. Very gracious to do that.
[1:25:18.540 --> 1:25:20.540]  London Guardian reporter.
[1:25:20.540 --> 1:25:23.540]  Charlie, this is a short segment. I want to come back and have Aaron brief you in the next.
[1:25:23.540 --> 1:25:26.540]  On our big breaking news, you're welcome to datamine.
[1:25:26.540 --> 1:25:29.540]  As soon as we get it back, we're going to scan them all in. We'll send them to you.
[1:25:29.540 --> 1:25:31.540]  We want to share this to the world.
[1:25:31.540 --> 1:25:39.540]  But any other tidbits in this short segment that people need to know about from Bilderberg 2012 that are important?
[1:25:39.540 --> 1:25:44.540]  Well, I think the most important thing.
[1:25:44.540 --> 1:25:52.540]  To finish what I was saying last time, I'd like people to name an event, a political event, that these people stay longer at.
[1:25:52.540 --> 1:25:55.540]  They're here for three or four days. That's how important it is.
[1:25:55.540 --> 1:25:59.540]  People don't spend, people like the head of Barclays or the Lord Chancellor, don't spend that long at Christmas.
[1:25:59.540 --> 1:26:10.540]  Anyway, in terms of important things, I just think it's worth talking about the lady from the Syrian National Council for a moment.
[1:26:10.540 --> 1:26:19.540]  She's an interesting character. It's very interesting. You only have to dig into her background a little, this lady.
[1:26:19.540 --> 1:26:29.540]  She's called Bathma Khodmani and she's listed as an international delegate. We've got a photo of her coming out.
[1:26:29.540 --> 1:26:34.540]  She's straight up and down Council on Foreign Relations.
[1:26:34.540 --> 1:26:40.540]  She works for the Syrian National Council for the she's Executive Director of the Arab Reform Initiative,
[1:26:40.540 --> 1:26:46.540]  which is admitted on the Council on Foreign Relations website that it's a CFR project.
[1:26:46.540 --> 1:26:55.540]  They say they set it up in 2005 and they hand over the financial reins to the Center for European Reform,
[1:26:55.540 --> 1:26:58.540]  which is worth looking up if you want to do some Googling. People, there's your homework.
[1:26:58.540 --> 1:27:00.540]  Center for European Reform.
[1:27:00.540 --> 1:27:05.540]  Anyway, it's very interesting to see the Syrian opposition being run out of Washington
[1:27:05.540 --> 1:27:12.540]  and clearly that's been very, very high up the agenda this year at Bilderberg.
[1:27:12.540 --> 1:27:17.540]  I had the weird thing of just sitting there in the hotel after they'd left looking up at the bar
[1:27:17.540 --> 1:27:27.540]  and the screen in the bar and seeing Khod Frida Jami, who's a Bilderberger,
[1:27:27.540 --> 1:27:33.540]  up on CNN talking about how he's going to be as bloody as Libya in Syria.
[1:27:33.540 --> 1:27:39.540]  I feel like it's been, I think some things got signed off this weekend.
[1:27:39.540 --> 1:27:44.540]  To look her up and look at her background and look at the background of the Syrian National Council
[1:27:44.540 --> 1:27:49.540]  and how it was put together and who are the people that spoke to people for it.
[1:27:49.540 --> 1:27:56.540]  And Charlie, that photo you posted of her in your Guardian story yesterday was just amazing
[1:27:56.540 --> 1:28:02.540]  and just incredible how angry she was with her arms crossed, one of the few limos that didn't have dark enough windows.
[1:28:02.540 --> 1:28:08.540]  Then you see them six, seven, eight years ago preparing the fake opposition, funding Al Qaeda to attack Syria,
[1:28:08.540 --> 1:28:14.540]  then saying we've got to invade Syria, their Al Qaeda, blowing up police stations, engaging in massacres,
[1:28:14.540 --> 1:28:18.540]  and then just like throwing babies out of incubators, that wasn't true.
[1:28:18.540 --> 1:28:25.540]  Hillary's up there again saying we've got to invade boots on the grounds, green light,
[1:28:25.540 --> 1:28:34.540]  not just air bombardment, but ground invasion of Syria, the big ally of Iran.
[1:28:34.540 --> 1:28:40.540]  This shows the whole agenda and you go back decades and you get their documents, they really are planning our world
[1:28:40.540 --> 1:28:49.540]  and they're in there in all these little break off meetings, bid rigging, getting money, price fixing, getting government contracts.
[1:28:49.540 --> 1:28:52.540]  I mean, this is the real global mafia, Charlie.
[1:28:52.540 --> 1:28:58.540]  Yeah, and this is, well, with the top, you know, that's the way they've got the Russians there, they've got Gary Kasparov, you know,
[1:28:58.540 --> 1:29:05.540]  they've got a sort of Anatoly Chubais and they've got a kind of slightly anti-Putin group of Russians there
[1:29:05.540 --> 1:29:13.540]  who they can work with because they're going to need some Russians, they're going to need a sort of power block within Russia to go into Syria.
[1:29:13.540 --> 1:29:15.540]  It's not totally straightforward.
[1:29:15.540 --> 1:29:21.540]  You know, so anyway, he thinks that's a scary sign as well, you know, for Syria.
[1:29:21.540 --> 1:29:25.540]  Well, yeah, Kasparov's been trying to overthrow over there and again, I'm not saying Putin's a great guy,
[1:29:25.540 --> 1:29:28.540]  but he's not the bankers over here running my country.
[1:29:28.540 --> 1:29:30.540]  He hadn't put in 30,000 drones in the sky.
[1:29:30.540 --> 1:29:35.540]  He hadn't, that didn't have TSA, groping old ladies and molesting children and hiring child molesters.
[1:29:35.540 --> 1:29:42.540]  Incredible information, Charlie Skelton, London Guardian, Mitt Romney, his big article going viral at Bilderberg 2012,

[1:34:09.540 --> 1:34:12.540]  It's just gone up at infowars.com.
[1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:17.540]  We worked last night and this morning with Paul, but we only sent him because he hit on the road with internet.
[1:34:17.540 --> 1:34:19.540]  I don't know, 10, 15 photos.
[1:34:19.540 --> 1:34:20.540]  We're going to be adding more.
[1:34:20.540 --> 1:34:24.540]  We're going to add scans as a PDF as soon as we get back to this.
[1:34:24.540 --> 1:34:26.540]  Leak Bilderberg documents.
[1:34:26.540 --> 1:34:28.540]  Nationalism is dangerous.
[1:34:28.540 --> 1:34:30.540]  Infowars exclusively obtained.
[1:34:30.540 --> 1:34:32.540]  Senators' notes from 1966.
[1:34:32.540 --> 1:34:34.540]  I'm going to have Paul add minutes.
[1:34:34.540 --> 1:34:36.540]  It's invitations.
[1:34:36.540 --> 1:34:38.540]  It's minutes.
[1:34:38.540 --> 1:34:40.540]  It's talking points.
[1:34:40.540 --> 1:34:42.540]  And then it's his notes on people's speeches.
[1:34:42.540 --> 1:34:44.540]  What was discussed there?
[1:34:44.540 --> 1:34:46.540]  I mean, it is, it's hundreds and hundreds of pages.
[1:34:46.540 --> 1:34:48.540]  Aaron's barely had time to read over it.
[1:34:48.540 --> 1:34:50.540]  It's blowing Aaron completely away.
[1:34:50.540 --> 1:34:52.540]  I wanted him to give Charlie Skelton a report now.
[1:34:52.540 --> 1:34:54.540]  This is only the beginning.
[1:34:54.540 --> 1:34:57.540]  In fact, we need to get added to Paul's article, a editor's note.
[1:34:57.540 --> 1:35:00.540]  I know Paul's listening, that this is only the beginning.
[1:35:00.540 --> 1:35:02.540]  This is only a snapshot.
[1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:04.540]  This is the Bilderberg WikiLeaks.
[1:35:04.540 --> 1:35:06.540]  This is really the, this is big.
[1:35:06.540 --> 1:35:08.540]  There's hundreds of pages of this.
[1:35:08.540 --> 1:35:10.540]  Aaron was up all night.
[1:35:10.540 --> 1:35:14.540]  We were up live streaming, connecting all this, confirming documents.
[1:35:14.540 --> 1:35:18.540]  A few of these documents were already released or in other national archives.
[1:35:18.540 --> 1:35:20.540]  Just a few of the hundreds of pages.
[1:35:20.540 --> 1:35:22.540]  We had a whole backpack full of stuff people were giving him.
[1:35:22.540 --> 1:35:24.540]  Aaron, we got to get a hold of that guy.
[1:35:24.540 --> 1:35:26.540]  He even had more.
[1:35:26.540 --> 1:35:28.540]  I don't know why we didn't, nobody's bad, but I never heard the whole full story on.
[1:35:28.540 --> 1:35:30.540]  We only got part of it.
[1:35:30.540 --> 1:35:34.540]  But I mean, the point is, this is amazing.
[1:35:34.540 --> 1:35:36.540]  This is amazing what we've got.
[1:35:36.540 --> 1:35:40.540]  Bernhard's invitations, the big Nazi, the beginning of it.
[1:35:40.540 --> 1:35:42.540]  Nationalism's bad.
[1:35:42.540 --> 1:35:44.540]  The head of the United Auto Workers.
[1:35:44.540 --> 1:35:46.540]  That's why we were given this by the union.
[1:35:46.540 --> 1:35:48.540]  They are really mad that now we're learning that the union sold them out in the 60s.
[1:35:48.540 --> 1:35:50.540]  Of course you did.
[1:35:50.540 --> 1:35:52.540]  It's not that unions are good or bad.
[1:35:52.540 --> 1:35:54.540]  They could be a force for good.
[1:35:54.540 --> 1:35:56.540]  They're for socialism, open borders, gun control.
[1:35:56.540 --> 1:35:58.540]  And their leaders are for NAFTA and GATT.
[1:35:58.540 --> 1:36:00.540]  They've been taken over.
[1:36:00.540 --> 1:36:02.540]  I would be for the unions of 100 years ago against the robber barons.
[1:36:02.540 --> 1:36:04.540]  Charlie Skelton, I'm going to have Aaron brief you here.
[1:36:04.540 --> 1:36:08.540]  I'm going to give you guys the floor here because you know I'll jump in.
[1:36:08.540 --> 1:36:12.540]  But do you have any comments about this data link?
[1:36:12.540 --> 1:36:14.540]  Because quite frankly, Info Wars is playing this down.
[1:36:14.540 --> 1:36:16.540]  This is much bigger than even Watson's headline.
[1:36:16.540 --> 1:36:20.540]  I don't blame him with us just sending him snapshots of this and stuff.
[1:36:20.540 --> 1:36:22.540]  Not understanding the full magnitude of it.
[1:36:22.540 --> 1:36:24.540]  But this is big, Charlie.
[1:36:24.540 --> 1:36:26.540]  What do you think of what we just said?
[1:36:26.540 --> 1:36:28.540]  Well, I'm very excited. I haven't seen my internet currently down.
[1:36:28.540 --> 1:36:30.540]  Thank you very much, Virgin Media.
[1:36:30.540 --> 1:36:32.540]  I'm waiting.
[1:36:32.540 --> 1:36:34.540]  I'm waiting.
[1:36:34.540 --> 1:36:38.540]  It sounds like an amazing resource you've got your hands on.
[1:36:38.540 --> 1:36:44.540]  You get it out there and there's so many people that know so much about Bilderberg around the world
[1:36:44.540 --> 1:36:48.540]  that they will be able to pick it apart and pick out the highlights.
[1:36:48.540 --> 1:36:52.540]  And if you're doing yourself picking up the significant little bits,
[1:36:52.540 --> 1:36:56.540]  because you can learn so much from these sorts of documents,
[1:36:56.540 --> 1:37:02.540]  I did my little bit this year to try and steer people back towards the early documents
[1:37:02.540 --> 1:37:06.540]  because you can get such an understanding of what's going on
[1:37:06.540 --> 1:37:12.540]  from proper declassified cabinet papers and Pentagon reports, et cetera, et cetera,
[1:37:12.540 --> 1:37:16.540]  the stuff that just leaks out, but you've got a slightly later leak, that's really good.
[1:37:16.540 --> 1:37:18.540]  I'm very excited, obviously.
[1:37:18.540 --> 1:37:22.540]  People like Tony Gosling from Bilderberg.org, he's going to be looking at that
[1:37:22.540 --> 1:37:24.540]  and reporting on that, I'm sure.
[1:37:24.540 --> 1:37:28.540]  So, so many experts will be picking this up.
[1:37:28.540 --> 1:37:30.540]  Absolutely.
[1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:32.540]  Aaron and I, some of them.
[1:37:32.540 --> 1:37:36.540]  Usually, all your listeners and viewers start looking,
[1:37:36.540 --> 1:37:38.540]  a lot of these documents are online,
[1:37:38.540 --> 1:37:40.540]  and just start piecing together if they haven't already.
[1:37:40.540 --> 1:37:44.540]  You know, the link between the foundations and the intelligence services
[1:37:44.540 --> 1:37:50.540]  and Bilderberg and, you know, the CIA, and it's a dark place, but it's worth looking to.
[1:37:50.540 --> 1:37:54.540]  That's right. A lot of some of this stuff has leaked out in private archives and government archives.
[1:37:54.540 --> 1:37:56.540]  This has never been released.
[1:37:56.540 --> 1:38:00.540]  It's got the government red letter photocopying not to be released and all the rest of it.
[1:38:00.540 --> 1:38:05.540]  But let's fade up Aaron Dykes to give you a quick 10-minute report or so.
[1:38:05.540 --> 1:38:08.540]  And to be fair to our next guest, we should just move him to the next hour
[1:38:08.540 --> 1:38:11.540]  to really give him the floor of this breaking news on TSA.
[1:38:11.540 --> 1:38:13.540]  If he can't do it, that's fine. We'll do it tomorrow.
[1:38:13.540 --> 1:38:18.540]  Aaron Dykes, you've got the floor. Give the data dump to Charlie Skelton of The Guardian.
[1:38:18.540 --> 1:38:20.540]  Well, Charlie, I'm glad you mentioned doing our homework,
[1:38:20.540 --> 1:38:22.540]  because that's, of course, what we have to do.
[1:38:22.540 --> 1:38:24.540]  We essentially know the links. This is Skull and Bones.
[1:38:24.540 --> 1:38:28.540]  These are the Robber Baron foundations who set up things like the Carnegie Endowment
[1:38:28.540 --> 1:38:32.540]  for International Peace and the other foundation bodies
[1:38:32.540 --> 1:38:35.540]  to carry their world government quest forward,
[1:38:35.540 --> 1:38:41.540]  even as they tried to spend things and draw attention away from their massive wealth and power.
[1:38:41.540 --> 1:38:47.540]  But these documents come from 1966 from the private library collection of Senator Fred Harris.
[1:38:47.540 --> 1:38:51.540]  He's out of Oklahoma, and he was a second-year senator,
[1:38:51.540 --> 1:38:54.540]  ended up being a two-term senator.
[1:38:54.540 --> 1:38:57.540]  There he is at Bilderberg, personally invited by Prince Bernhard.
[1:38:57.540 --> 1:39:00.540]  We have the signature in the letterhead where he was invited,
[1:39:00.540 --> 1:39:05.540]  and he's being reeducated by all these dignitaries so forth and so on
[1:39:05.540 --> 1:39:08.540]  about how nationalism is dangerous.
[1:39:08.540 --> 1:39:12.540]  He's got it underlined in his handwritten notes under headers from each different speaker.
[1:39:12.540 --> 1:39:16.540]  Nationalism is dangerous with emphasis on is.
[1:39:16.540 --> 1:39:21.540]  Other things like NATO is in trouble because common fears are reduced,
[1:39:21.540 --> 1:39:24.540]  and we know what this is all about because Prince Bernhard himself
[1:39:24.540 --> 1:39:29.540]  spelled out the two-part agenda in the 1966 briefing.
[1:39:29.540 --> 1:39:35.540]  It was A, reorganizing NATO, and B, the future of world economic development,
[1:39:35.540 --> 1:39:39.540]  particularly amongst industrialized versus deindustrialized nations.
[1:39:39.540 --> 1:39:43.540]  As you know, that means strengthening and building up funding for IMF,
[1:39:43.540 --> 1:39:47.540]  for the U.S. Agency for International Development,
[1:39:47.540 --> 1:39:50.540]  for the United Nations, different arms,
[1:39:50.540 --> 1:39:54.540]  and the rest of it, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, GATT.
[1:39:54.540 --> 1:39:57.540]  All the rest of these bodies were in attendance on the meeting.
[1:39:57.540 --> 1:40:00.540]  They're on the official list, and of course, as we mentioned,
[1:40:00.540 --> 1:40:04.540]  Walter P. Royther, the head of United Auto Workers, the biggest union at the time,
[1:40:04.540 --> 1:40:09.540]  he was also presiding over the International Conference for Free Trade,
[1:40:09.540 --> 1:40:14.540]  and he boasts that he has more than 60 million workers at his hands crafting policy.
[1:40:14.540 --> 1:40:20.540]  They set up that year in 1966, the wage price control board, different mechanisms,
[1:40:20.540 --> 1:40:25.540]  but the irony is you've got these socialists for unions, which Alex mentioned could be good,
[1:40:25.540 --> 1:40:30.540]  but they're controlled by people like David Rockefeller, supposedly the top capitalist,
[1:40:30.540 --> 1:40:34.540]  meeting side by side with them, and that is what they're pursuing,
[1:40:34.540 --> 1:40:38.540]  and we also see them trying to strengthen these international bodies overall.
[1:40:38.540 --> 1:40:41.540]  They talk about NATO, how it's not only...
[1:40:46.540 --> 1:40:47.540]  Are we going?
[1:40:47.540 --> 1:40:49.540]  Okay, it looks like we lost him again.
[1:40:49.540 --> 1:40:53.540]  I'm Rob Dew, sitting shotgun here in the Central Texas Command Center,
[1:40:53.540 --> 1:40:58.540]  while Aaron, Alex, Rob Jacobson, and Richard Rees are barreling down the highway.
[1:40:58.540 --> 1:41:00.540]  They've been everywhere.
[1:41:00.540 --> 1:41:01.540]  They've been all through.
[1:41:01.540 --> 1:41:03.540]  Did we get him back? I hear him in my ear now.
[1:41:03.540 --> 1:41:08.540]  We have the microphone. The microphone came unplugged.
[1:41:08.540 --> 1:41:10.540]  I'll do it. I'll do it.
[1:41:10.540 --> 1:41:13.540]  All right, go ahead, finish your point there, Aaron.
[1:41:13.540 --> 1:41:15.540]  Okay, are we live right now?
[1:41:15.540 --> 1:41:16.540]  Go ahead.
[1:41:16.540 --> 1:41:20.540]  They're not only talking about how to build up international development mechanisms,
[1:41:20.540 --> 1:41:24.540]  they explicitly talk about using those mechanisms to control the food supply
[1:41:24.540 --> 1:41:28.540]  and pursue population reduction.
[1:41:28.540 --> 1:41:32.540]  They also talk about how NATO needs to be, quote, reorganized,
[1:41:32.540 --> 1:41:35.540]  not only as a militaristic opposition to the Soviet Union,
[1:41:35.540 --> 1:41:38.540]  but as a way to further integrate Europe.
[1:41:38.540 --> 1:41:40.540]  They talk about that explicitly in the documents.
[1:41:40.540 --> 1:41:42.540]  That's from one Robert S. Bowie.
[1:41:42.540 --> 1:41:45.540]  He's a trilateral CFR, Bilderberger, you name it.
[1:41:45.540 --> 1:41:50.540]  He's also a John J. McCloy Acolyte who also spoke at the conference,
[1:41:50.540 --> 1:41:53.540]  just obsessively talked about how dangerous nationalism is,
[1:41:53.540 --> 1:41:56.540]  how we cannot revert to a pre-1914 mentality,
[1:41:56.540 --> 1:42:00.540]  talked about how de Gaulle reviving nationalism in France was so dangerous,
[1:42:00.540 --> 1:42:03.540]  how it could spread to Germany, and on and on.
[1:42:03.540 --> 1:42:06.540]  John J. McCloy was not only a skull and bones member,
[1:42:06.540 --> 1:42:10.540]  he was the head of a number of very powerful organizations from the World Bank.
[1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:16.540]  He was a lawyer to the IG Farben Combine that was the backbone of the Nazi mechanism,
[1:42:16.540 --> 1:42:18.540]  and he was the chair of Chase Manhattan Bank,
[1:42:18.540 --> 1:42:20.540]  the chair of the Ford Foundation,
[1:42:20.540 --> 1:42:22.540]  the chair of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[1:42:22.540 --> 1:42:24.540]  He was even on the Warren Commission,
[1:42:24.540 --> 1:42:28.540]  and that's just one example of some of the most important people at this meeting.
[1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:29.540]  We have the list.
[1:42:29.540 --> 1:42:33.540]  Zvignu Brzezinski, among others, at attendance in 1966.
[1:42:33.540 --> 1:42:35.540]  And as you well know, Charlie,
[1:42:35.540 --> 1:42:40.540]  all the stuff with Prince Bernhardt being at the very top of the IG Farben Board
[1:42:40.540 --> 1:42:43.540]  during and before World War II,
[1:42:43.540 --> 1:42:48.540]  connects directly with how Harriman, Prescott Bush, and other top Anglo files,
[1:42:48.540 --> 1:42:50.540]  most of them connected to skull and bones,
[1:42:50.540 --> 1:42:56.540]  were financing and backing the Nazi mechanism for their own gain to unify Europe in the long run,
[1:42:56.540 --> 1:42:59.540]  also, of course, to profiteer off of it.
[1:42:59.540 --> 1:43:04.540]  The Netherlands banks were the intermediaries so that no matter who won the war,
[1:43:04.540 --> 1:43:06.540]  they could quickly shift the assets,
[1:43:06.540 --> 1:43:10.540]  avoid blame, and basically avoid all prosecution.
[1:43:10.540 --> 1:43:14.540]  Any comments on what he just broke down for you there?
[1:43:14.540 --> 1:43:15.540]  That's for me.
[1:43:15.540 --> 1:43:17.540]  I mean, just a couple of things that jumped out was, you know,
[1:43:17.540 --> 1:43:19.540]  obviously the IG Farben thing, which is, you know,
[1:43:19.540 --> 1:43:21.540]  the more that's looked into, the better.
[1:43:21.540 --> 1:43:24.540]  And, you know, I mean, this is a dark company.
[1:43:24.540 --> 1:43:26.540]  You know, they had IG Auschwitz,
[1:43:26.540 --> 1:43:28.540]  they had a massive factory next to Auschwitz.
[1:43:28.540 --> 1:43:31.540]  I mean, they produced Zyklon B.
[1:43:31.540 --> 1:43:33.540]  I mean, it doesn't get worse than that.
[1:43:33.540 --> 1:43:36.540]  And, but, you know, you mentioned the control of the food supply.
[1:43:36.540 --> 1:43:38.540]  I mean, isn't that, you know, you've got Kissinger sitting there.
[1:43:38.540 --> 1:43:42.540]  Isn't he the guy who's just using food as a weapon?
[1:43:42.540 --> 1:43:45.540]  State Department of Miranda, State Department of Miranda,
[1:43:45.540 --> 1:43:48.540]  273, CIA, Joint Department of Miranda,
[1:43:48.540 --> 1:43:51.540]  adopted as U.S. policy by the executive branch
[1:43:51.540 --> 1:43:53.540]  via the Carnegie Endowment for Peace.
[1:43:53.540 --> 1:43:55.540]  Peace means when we're all dead.
[1:43:55.540 --> 1:43:56.540]  And that's not it.
[1:43:56.540 --> 1:43:58.540]  That's why you talk about why they're so serious
[1:43:58.540 --> 1:44:01.540]  and that's why they're so evil and focused.
[1:44:01.540 --> 1:44:03.540]  These are eugenicists.
[1:44:03.540 --> 1:44:06.540]  The Queen, her father, the British Royals,
[1:44:06.540 --> 1:44:08.540]  the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers,
[1:44:08.540 --> 1:44:10.540]  the Rockefellers and their secret eugenics meetings,
[1:44:10.540 --> 1:44:12.540]  funding the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute,
[1:44:12.540 --> 1:44:15.540]  funding eugenics, funding racial sterilization laws
[1:44:15.540 --> 1:44:17.540]  in 34 states in the U.S.
[1:44:17.540 --> 1:44:18.540]  This is it.
[1:44:18.540 --> 1:44:19.540]  These are monsters.
[1:44:19.540 --> 1:44:20.540]  We've got to remember that.
[1:44:20.540 --> 1:44:22.540]  Yes, Charlie.
[1:44:22.540 --> 1:44:25.540]  And I would just like to add that the document explicitly talks
[1:44:25.540 --> 1:44:28.540]  about the U.S. Agency for International Development
[1:44:28.540 --> 1:44:30.540]  being the one to pursue this population reduction.
[1:44:30.540 --> 1:44:33.540]  That is what Henry Kissinger is talking about
[1:44:33.540 --> 1:44:36.540]  in his Food as a Weapon document, NSM 200.
[1:44:36.540 --> 1:44:39.540]  He was talking about using USAID.
[1:44:39.540 --> 1:44:40.540]  That's really incredible.
[1:44:40.540 --> 1:44:41.540]  Go ahead, Charlie.
[1:44:41.540 --> 1:44:42.540]  I said I'm looking forward to it.
[1:44:42.540 --> 1:44:43.540]  Like, it's a good thing.
[1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:44.540]  I'm looking forward to looking at that.
[1:44:44.540 --> 1:44:45.540]  I mean, that's extraordinary.
[1:44:45.540 --> 1:44:47.540]  And, yeah, wow.
[1:44:47.540 --> 1:44:49.540]  I mean, so much information coming out.
[1:44:49.540 --> 1:44:52.540]  And, you know, this attack on the, you know,
[1:44:52.540 --> 1:44:54.540]  the reason why they're attacking nationalism,
[1:44:54.540 --> 1:44:55.540]  apart from what one of them is,
[1:44:55.540 --> 1:44:59.540]  you know, they hate any kind of patriotic feeling.
[1:44:59.540 --> 1:45:01.540]  And because, you know,
[1:45:01.540 --> 1:45:04.540]  they want to set up this kind of transnational bankocracy.
[1:45:04.540 --> 1:45:08.540]  You know, these people that are sitting around the table,
[1:45:08.540 --> 1:45:10.540]  still sitting around the table at Bilderberg,
[1:45:10.540 --> 1:45:15.540]  are desperate for there to be this completely dissolved world
[1:45:15.540 --> 1:45:17.540]  that they can sit on top of.
[1:45:17.540 --> 1:45:19.540]  You know, so the whole thing becomes them as a kind of,
[1:45:19.540 --> 1:45:26.540]  you know, technocratic, Maoist sort of panel of expert bankers
[1:45:26.540 --> 1:45:29.540]  that control everything on our behalf.
[1:45:29.540 --> 1:45:32.540]  You know, and you can sort of see it shaping that way.
[1:45:32.540 --> 1:45:33.540]  You really, anyway.
[1:45:33.540 --> 1:45:36.540]  And it's just fascinating to see a little bit of the history
[1:45:36.540 --> 1:45:42.540]  towards, you know, what we're dealing with today.
[1:45:42.540 --> 1:45:43.540]  I totally agree with you.
[1:45:43.540 --> 1:45:46.540]  And again, we have hundreds of pages of these,
[1:45:46.540 --> 1:45:49.540]  and we've got, you know, the talking points, the agenda,
[1:45:49.540 --> 1:45:51.540]  who's there, what the speeches are going to be.
[1:45:51.540 --> 1:45:54.540]  We have the minutes of Bilderberg 66.
[1:45:54.540 --> 1:45:56.540]  And we have very few other minutes.
[1:45:56.540 --> 1:45:57.540]  We have some from the 50s.
[1:45:57.540 --> 1:46:00.540]  And it just shows everything they want they get.
[1:46:00.540 --> 1:46:03.540]  And now it's the rollout of the police state.
[1:46:03.540 --> 1:46:06.540]  Now it's the takeover of society by people that took over
[1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:08.540]  via getting our tax money.
[1:46:08.540 --> 1:46:11.540]  Powerful elites took over government, took over the media.
[1:46:11.540 --> 1:46:12.540]  This is their program.
[1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:13.540]  This is their plan.
[1:46:13.540 --> 1:46:15.540]  This is their operation.
[1:46:15.540 --> 1:46:17.540]  And so this is the Bilderberg leaks.
[1:46:17.540 --> 1:46:19.540]  I mean, that's really what this is.
[1:46:19.540 --> 1:46:21.540]  And as soon as we get back today,
[1:46:21.540 --> 1:46:24.540]  we're going to scan these documents in,
[1:46:24.540 --> 1:46:26.540]  and we're going to get them up to link them into the article.
[1:46:26.540 --> 1:46:28.540]  And Paul will have more articles tomorrow.
[1:46:28.540 --> 1:46:30.540]  Kurt Nemo is welcome to write articles on it.
[1:46:30.540 --> 1:46:32.540]  And anybody in our office that thinks this is important,
[1:46:32.540 --> 1:46:36.540]  because this is a big deal in every sense of the word.
[1:46:36.540 --> 1:46:39.540]  Aaron Dykes, continuing with the data dump.
[1:46:39.540 --> 1:46:41.540]  You know, this, in the imitation letters
[1:46:41.540 --> 1:46:43.540]  and the briefings that happened before Bilderberg,
[1:46:43.540 --> 1:46:45.540]  there's several layers of that
[1:46:45.540 --> 1:46:47.540]  about the travel arrangements, et cetera.
[1:46:47.540 --> 1:46:51.540]  Prince Bernhard and his secretaries point out how two people
[1:46:51.540 --> 1:46:54.540]  are the top U.S. diplomats to Bilderberg.
[1:46:54.540 --> 1:46:56.540]  One is Joseph E. Johnson.
[1:46:56.540 --> 1:46:58.540]  He's the president of the Carnegie Endowment
[1:46:58.540 --> 1:47:00.540]  for International Peace.
[1:47:00.540 --> 1:47:02.540]  Not any kind of peace, international peace.
[1:47:02.540 --> 1:47:05.540]  He's also the head of the World Peace Foundation.
[1:47:05.540 --> 1:47:07.540]  The other is George W. Ball.
[1:47:07.540 --> 1:47:09.540]  He was under Secretary of State under JFK.
[1:47:09.540 --> 1:47:12.540]  They're both big architects of the Vietnam War
[1:47:12.540 --> 1:47:15.540]  and of the larger world government mechanism.
[1:47:15.540 --> 1:47:18.540]  There's a bombshell quote you can look up from George W. Ball,
[1:47:18.540 --> 1:47:21.540]  where he tells JFK, within five years,
[1:47:21.540 --> 1:47:24.540]  we're going to have 300,000 troops in Vietnam.
[1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:26.540]  JFK looks him in the face and says,
[1:47:26.540 --> 1:47:29.540]  George Ball, you're supposed to be one of the smartest guys
[1:47:29.540 --> 1:47:32.540]  in the room, but I think you're crazier than hell.
[1:47:32.540 --> 1:47:34.540]  It's never going to happen.
[1:47:34.540 --> 1:47:36.540]  In other words, over my dead body.
[1:47:36.540 --> 1:47:38.540]  Well, we all know what happened,
[1:47:38.540 --> 1:47:40.540]  and you got John J. McCoy, among others,
[1:47:40.540 --> 1:47:43.540]  on the Warren Commission there at Bilderberg in 1966,
[1:47:43.540 --> 1:47:46.540]  only a few years after JFK was assassinated,
[1:47:46.540 --> 1:47:49.540]  and I can tell you, it wasn't from Oswald.
[1:47:49.540 --> 1:47:51.540]  And again, he warned the military industrial complex
[1:47:51.540 --> 1:47:54.540]  taking over just as I did.
[1:47:54.540 --> 1:47:56.540]  This is the big news.
[1:47:56.540 --> 1:47:59.540]  Something you mentioned, Charlie, here in closing,
[1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:01.540]  was that they had over 300 security people
[1:48:01.540 --> 1:48:03.540]  for 150 people, roughly,
[1:48:03.540 --> 1:48:06.540]  so that's two security people for every person there.
[1:48:06.540 --> 1:48:08.540]  And most of them, in a sense, spies,
[1:48:08.540 --> 1:48:10.540]  but they had plain-closed Marines
[1:48:10.540 --> 1:48:12.540]  in Marine Corps license-plated vehicles,
[1:48:12.540 --> 1:48:14.540]  just like they had four years ago,
[1:48:14.540 --> 1:48:16.540]  flipping us off wearing clown masks and stuff,
[1:48:16.540 --> 1:48:18.540]  and we'd photograph our faces.
[1:48:18.540 --> 1:48:21.540]  The Marines would drive out, shaking their heads at us,
[1:48:21.540 --> 1:48:24.540]  like we were the traitors, because we didn't like foreign banks,
[1:48:24.540 --> 1:48:26.540]  and the New World Order conquering America.
[1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:28.540]  And using us as an engine of global tyranny,
[1:48:28.540 --> 1:48:31.540]  like German Hessians were mercenaries or something.
[1:48:31.540 --> 1:48:33.540]  And they sent out plain-closed Marines
[1:48:33.540 --> 1:48:35.540]  to act like they were our friends.
[1:48:35.540 --> 1:48:37.540]  Oh, we're anti-terrorism forces,
[1:48:37.540 --> 1:48:39.540]  and they were clearly Marines.
[1:48:39.540 --> 1:48:41.540]  They were going in and out. We saw them later inside.
[1:48:41.540 --> 1:48:44.540]  And they would shake our hands and try to crush our hands
[1:48:44.540 --> 1:48:47.540]  and poke their thumbs into our hands and laugh at us.
[1:48:47.540 --> 1:48:49.540]  And it didn't really hurt. The guy would try to hurt my hand.
[1:48:49.540 --> 1:48:52.540]  I'd just sit there and wouldn't even squeeze and let him do it.
[1:48:52.540 --> 1:48:54.540]  And, uh...
[1:48:54.540 --> 1:48:56.540]  You know, I'm not a tough guy.
[1:48:56.540 --> 1:48:58.540]  I'd have my finger cut off.
[1:48:58.540 --> 1:49:00.540]  I'd have, you know, legs broken, everything else.
[1:49:00.540 --> 1:49:02.540]  It certainly doesn't hurt your squeeze in my hand, son.
[1:49:02.540 --> 1:49:04.540]  And so he...
[1:49:04.540 --> 1:49:06.540]  And they're bugging their eyes out,
[1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:09.540]  and I learned they were dressing down younger people
[1:49:09.540 --> 1:49:12.540]  and couples and telling them to leave running around doing scyops.
[1:49:12.540 --> 1:49:14.540]  We had the Marine Corps
[1:49:14.540 --> 1:49:17.540]  illegally engaging us within our group.
[1:49:17.540 --> 1:49:19.540]  I mean, this is what America's come to.
[1:49:19.540 --> 1:49:21.540]  American people...
[1:49:21.540 --> 1:49:23.540]  Yeah, go ahead.
[1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:25.540]  Yeah, go ahead.
[1:49:25.540 --> 1:49:27.540]  Someone came out.
[1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:29.540]  They started doing NLP on one of the protests.
[1:49:29.540 --> 1:49:31.540]  And someone else who was a protester there
[1:49:31.540 --> 1:49:33.540]  realized that was what was happening and said,
[1:49:33.540 --> 1:49:36.540]  hey, stop doing that. I know what you're doing. I know this stuff.
[1:49:36.540 --> 1:49:38.540]  Oh, I know. And it was ridiculous.
[1:49:38.540 --> 1:49:41.540]  They were like quasi-mental idiots.
[1:49:41.540 --> 1:49:45.540]  Like, coming up and talking and saying weird things to us
[1:49:45.540 --> 1:49:47.540]  and then going in and out.
[1:49:47.540 --> 1:49:49.540]  And I'm like...
[1:49:49.540 --> 1:49:51.540]  And they would get so upset when I videotaped the Marines coming in and out
[1:49:51.540 --> 1:49:54.540]  with their license plates illegally, their diplomatic security corps.
[1:49:54.540 --> 1:49:56.540]  The point is they're engaging American citizens.
[1:49:56.540 --> 1:49:58.540]  It's totally illegal.
[1:49:58.540 --> 1:50:00.540]  And did you run into those Marines?
[1:50:00.540 --> 1:50:02.540]  I mean, they look like Manchurian candidates.
[1:50:02.540 --> 1:50:04.540]  They were the brainwashed people.
[1:50:04.540 --> 1:50:06.540]  But I mean, I'm the enemy now because I'm going to...
[1:50:06.540 --> 1:50:08.540]  I'd like to break up something else
[1:50:08.540 --> 1:50:10.540]  because you mentioned Gary Kasparov.
[1:50:10.540 --> 1:50:12.540]  No, no, go ahead.
[1:50:12.540 --> 1:50:14.540]  We'll go back to Gary Kasparov in a minute.
[1:50:14.540 --> 1:50:16.540]  Go ahead, finish your point, Charlie.
[1:50:16.540 --> 1:50:18.540]  You know, I was going to say what was really heartwarming, though,
[1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:20.540]  was actually the amount of education that the police that went.
[1:50:20.540 --> 1:50:22.540]  Skip the break.
[1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:24.540]  You know? And I...
[1:50:24.540 --> 1:50:26.540]  Well, one of the policemen said to me, he literally...
[1:50:26.540 --> 1:50:28.540]  You know, we went into...
[1:50:28.540 --> 1:50:31.540]  We were picking up some lister and he sort of looked at me and said,
[1:50:31.540 --> 1:50:34.540]  you know, he looked around to see what no one was there.
[1:50:34.540 --> 1:50:36.540]  And he just said, look, trust me,
[1:50:36.540 --> 1:50:39.540]  we're not backing these Builderbergs.
[1:50:39.540 --> 1:50:41.540]  You know?
[1:50:41.540 --> 1:50:43.540]  And there was a lot of education of the police.
[1:50:43.540 --> 1:50:45.540]  People were just on their bullhorn talking to them.
[1:50:45.540 --> 1:50:49.540]  It was quite funny, for hours, just simply giving them back.
[1:50:49.540 --> 1:50:54.540]  So, you know, it was like the police had gone to school for three days.
[1:50:54.540 --> 1:50:59.540]  And the police were Googling with iPads and smart pads
[1:50:59.540 --> 1:51:01.540]  Samsung systems, I saw.
[1:51:01.540 --> 1:51:05.540]  I'd say, okay, look up Rockefeller Foundation sterilence and vaccines.
[1:51:05.540 --> 1:51:08.540]  They'd look, ten minutes later, go, whoa!
[1:51:08.540 --> 1:51:10.540]  And I'd say, okay, they was on Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:51:10.540 --> 1:51:13.540]  They're proud to say, all right, look up Prince Bernhard Nazi.
[1:51:13.540 --> 1:51:15.540]  Look it up.
[1:51:15.540 --> 1:51:17.540]  And so they were looking up and by the end,
[1:51:17.540 --> 1:51:19.540]  we were like, who supports the Constitution?
[1:51:19.540 --> 1:51:23.540]  And on video, the cops would do it before the head guys would raise their hands.
[1:51:23.540 --> 1:51:26.540]  Or I'd say, oh, you're saying we can't cross the street.
[1:51:26.540 --> 1:51:28.540]  You want your kids to grow up in a country like this?
[1:51:28.540 --> 1:51:30.540]  It's not illegal to walk across this side street.
[1:51:30.540 --> 1:51:31.540]  You're being told to.
[1:51:31.540 --> 1:51:34.540]  And like the head cops on the ground were going, yeah, you see that trailer.
[1:51:34.540 --> 1:51:36.540]  It's watching us and listening to us.
[1:51:36.540 --> 1:51:37.540]  We'll get in trouble.
[1:51:37.540 --> 1:51:39.540]  And I said, okay, your kids are going to have no future.
[1:51:39.540 --> 1:51:40.540]  All right, yeah, you're right.
[1:51:40.540 --> 1:51:41.540]  Cross the street.
[1:51:41.540 --> 1:51:42.540]  I'm not following that order.
[1:51:42.540 --> 1:51:46.540]  And again, it's that they were a professional discipline group,
[1:51:46.540 --> 1:51:49.540]  not like thugs I've seen, that we were pointing.
[1:51:49.540 --> 1:51:51.540]  And I said, and your police line is too far out in the street.
[1:51:51.540 --> 1:51:53.540]  You're going to make somebody get run over.
[1:51:53.540 --> 1:51:54.540]  Move it back.
[1:51:54.540 --> 1:51:55.540]  They started talking.
[1:51:55.540 --> 1:51:56.540]  I said, yeah, move it back.
[1:51:56.540 --> 1:51:59.540]  I mean, you know, they were understanding this is an illegal group.
[1:51:59.540 --> 1:52:00.540]  They looked up Logan act.
[1:52:00.540 --> 1:52:03.540]  They found out Hillary was fine, 300 grand for it in 94.
[1:52:03.540 --> 1:52:06.540]  They found out this group, you know, commands the US military.
[1:52:06.540 --> 1:52:09.540]  They've told Congress that NATO commands the military along with the UN.
[1:52:09.540 --> 1:52:10.540]  They looked that up.
[1:52:10.540 --> 1:52:12.540]  I said, look, they watched the video.
[1:52:12.540 --> 1:52:13.540]  I said, wow.
[1:52:13.540 --> 1:52:16.540]  And see, four years ago, they started listening.
[1:52:16.540 --> 1:52:19.540]  So a lot of them were already listeners, including the SWAT team commander.
[1:52:19.540 --> 1:52:21.540]  Did you see him on table?
[1:52:21.540 --> 1:52:22.540]  I'll talk to you the first day.
[1:52:22.540 --> 1:52:24.540]  And he goes, yeah, listen to your show, Alex.
[1:52:24.540 --> 1:52:26.540]  Try to listen four years ago, last time you're here.
[1:52:26.540 --> 1:52:27.540]  I'm with you.
[1:52:27.540 --> 1:52:31.540]  Head guy runs out of the bushes and says, do not talk to them.
[1:52:31.540 --> 1:52:36.540]  Again, these guys know that they were there ordered to guard criminals.
[1:52:36.540 --> 1:52:38.540]  And so they didn't like it.
[1:52:38.540 --> 1:52:40.540]  This is the beginning of the end for the globalist.
[1:52:40.540 --> 1:52:41.540]  This is a big deal.
[1:52:41.540 --> 1:52:42.540]  Charlie Skelton.
[1:52:42.540 --> 1:52:43.540]  Absolutely.
[1:52:43.540 --> 1:52:47.540]  I mean, the police must have the most enlightened police officers now in the entire US.
[1:52:47.540 --> 1:52:51.540]  But you know, they've got the sense that, you know, there's just the thing about the police standing there.
[1:52:51.540 --> 1:52:54.540]  There's just some normal guys doing a job.
[1:52:54.540 --> 1:52:56.540]  And you know, we could talk to them and say, look, we're doing our job.
[1:52:56.540 --> 1:52:57.540]  I'm a journalist.
[1:52:57.540 --> 1:52:58.540]  I'm here.
[1:52:58.540 --> 1:52:59.540]  I'm doing my job.
[1:52:59.540 --> 1:53:00.540]  You know, you're doing your job.
[1:53:00.540 --> 1:53:01.540]  All right.
[1:53:01.540 --> 1:53:02.540]  I've lost Charlie Skelton.
[1:53:02.540 --> 1:53:03.540]  Take me up on Skype.
[1:53:03.540 --> 1:53:04.540]  He's still there.
[1:53:04.540 --> 1:53:05.540]  Go ahead, Charlie.
[1:53:05.540 --> 1:53:06.540]  Finish your point.
[1:53:06.540 --> 1:53:07.540]  Go to Skype.
[1:53:07.540 --> 1:53:09.540]  Yeah, all little bit of confusion on the road.
[1:53:09.540 --> 1:53:12.540]  But anyway, yeah, just saying, you know, they're normal guys and they were talking to, you know,
[1:53:12.540 --> 1:53:17.540]  the people outside Bilderberg, the protesters were a bunch of normal people, just concerned citizens.
[1:53:17.540 --> 1:53:25.540]  So it was just citizens talking to citizens about some information and, you know, he was heartening to see.
[1:53:25.540 --> 1:53:30.540]  Yeah, there were also some provocateurs there calling the police pigs and scum and filth.
[1:53:30.540 --> 1:53:34.540]  And clearly I could tell that most of them had been, it was only five or six had been sent.
[1:53:34.540 --> 1:53:39.540]  We had guys in masks who were clearly Marine Corps build, Marine Corps bearing, Marine Corps activity,
[1:53:39.540 --> 1:53:41.540]  throwing things on cars.
[1:53:41.540 --> 1:53:46.540]  But again, the Marine Corps disgraced itself, openly working for foreigners.
[1:53:46.540 --> 1:53:50.540]  That's what Spenny Butler, the two-time congressional Medal of Honor winner said.
[1:53:50.540 --> 1:53:51.540]  All right.
[1:53:51.540 --> 1:53:58.540]  In closing, Aaron Dykes, you wrote an article last Wednesday about Kasparov and how they're setting up a CFR to take over Russia.
[1:53:58.540 --> 1:54:02.540]  And again, it'd be one thing if the U.S. was trying to take over Russia for liberty.
[1:54:02.540 --> 1:54:05.540]  That would still be foreign entanglements and dangerous.
[1:54:05.540 --> 1:54:07.540]  And our founders said don't do that.
[1:54:07.540 --> 1:54:08.540]  George Washington.
[1:54:08.540 --> 1:54:15.540]  But this is globalist bankers that have conquered us through fraud, now trying to get us into a war with Russia and infiltrate them.
[1:54:15.540 --> 1:54:19.540]  Aaron Dykes, since you brought that up, you wrote an article that got no attention last week.
[1:54:19.540 --> 1:54:25.540]  Well, it's very important because those who know the real history know the Cecil Rhodes Roundtable Group is what Bilderberg comes out of.
[1:54:25.540 --> 1:54:28.540]  The American counterpart is the Council on Foreign Relations.
[1:54:28.540 --> 1:54:32.540]  The British counterpart is the Royal Institute of International Affairs.
[1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:38.540]  And without any coincidence, Russia has set up a Russian Institute of International Affairs.
[1:54:38.540 --> 1:54:41.540]  Those names are not coincidental. China now has a branch.
[1:54:41.540 --> 1:54:47.540]  And these were set up only a couple years ago. It's very significant about Gary Kasparov, the former chess champion.
[1:54:47.540 --> 1:54:49.540]  He was tapped by the neocons.
[1:54:49.540 --> 1:54:56.540]  Those who would later set up the project for a new American Century back in 1991, they gave him an award they only give to Americans.
[1:54:56.540 --> 1:54:59.540]  Keeper of the Flame from the Center of Security Policy.
[1:54:59.540 --> 1:55:02.540]  They were tapping him for future destabilization.
[1:55:02.540 --> 1:55:05.540]  That's why he's there. He's a protest opponent to Putin.
[1:55:05.540 --> 1:55:08.540]  That's his only issue is opposing Putin.
[1:55:08.540 --> 1:55:14.540]  And furthermore, we've got new ambassadors who have been meeting with these Putin opposition forces in Russia.
[1:55:14.540 --> 1:55:20.540]  The color revolution in the works. You cannot distance it from the domino that is Syria either.
[1:55:20.540 --> 1:55:24.540]  It must be clear. Same guy. You got Soros involved trying to get our guns and overthrow us.
[1:55:24.540 --> 1:55:28.540]  It's not America trying to free Russia. It's the bankers trying to enslave it.
[1:55:28.540 --> 1:55:34.540]  Just like they're not trying to free Syria, I would still be against it because the founders pointed out why it was wrong and dangerous.
[1:55:34.540 --> 1:55:40.540]  Thomas Jefferson, evil guys like George Washington, is that they're trying to put al-Qaeda in Syria.
[1:55:40.540 --> 1:55:43.540]  Even in the L.A. Times, they've said all the Jews are dead.
[1:55:43.540 --> 1:55:47.540]  The Christians are expelled from the second oldest Christian settlement in the world.
[1:55:47.540 --> 1:55:50.540]  Is Syria second oldest in the world?
[1:55:50.540 --> 1:55:52.540]  I do not support al-Qaeda.
[1:55:52.540 --> 1:56:00.540]  And if people out there want to say I'm evil because of that, and they have written a bunch of articles saying that this week, claiming I support Assad or I support Putin,
[1:56:00.540 --> 1:56:06.540]  I support America and the Bill of Rights and Constitution. I want the banker occupation out of here.
[1:56:06.540 --> 1:56:12.540]  And this is incredible to have these foreign banksters here doing this and trying to set all this stuff.
[1:56:12.540 --> 1:56:16.540]  This is a global, corporate, fascist government, playing countries off against each other.
[1:56:16.540 --> 1:56:19.540]  Charlie Skelton comments on what Aaron Dike just said.
[1:56:19.540 --> 1:56:26.540]  Just fascinating about stuff about the Internet, you know, the Chatham House, you know, and the Royal Institute of International Affairs.
[1:56:26.540 --> 1:56:34.540]  The idea that still the blame is still going there. And you know, back in 1946, that was where the Chatham House at Joseph Wreckingham made a speech about Europe,
[1:56:34.540 --> 1:56:41.540]  where he set out his vision, which turned into Bilderberg, you know, some eight years later, their first conference.
[1:56:41.540 --> 1:56:48.540]  So it's all ties in, it's all, you know, he was a British secret agent, you know, and, you know, he worked at Special Forces.
[1:56:48.540 --> 1:56:51.540]  At the top, at the top Jesuit.
[1:56:51.540 --> 1:56:57.540]  I just wanted to say before I forget, you know, it was a great party atmosphere this year, but, you know, we want more people as well.
[1:56:57.540 --> 1:57:05.540]  And, you know, if anyone wants to email me, I put a link at the email address at the bottom of my last piece, which is Bilderberg2013 at yahoo.co.uk.
[1:57:05.540 --> 1:57:11.540]  You know, if you live in London, talk me a line, we'll go and have a debrief. If you're interested in coming next year, I can help, you know, talk to you about that.
[1:57:11.540 --> 1:57:18.540]  And, you know, everyone has to talk to each other and get social media working so that we, that he's even bigger and more of a party next year.
[1:57:18.540 --> 1:57:21.540]  I agree. I agree. Absolutely.
[1:57:21.540 --> 1:57:35.540]  Send your emails to you, to Kurt at infowars.com, to Paul Watson's email, to Showtips, to Rob D at infowars.com, to everybody, to Aaron with two As at infowars.com, with more data dumps, with more data.
[1:57:35.540 --> 1:57:39.540]  We can bring down these criminals. They've now been exposed. People now know it's real.
[1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:44.540]  So many people came there to say, I just wanted to see if you were telling the truth, and if this even existed.
[1:57:44.540 --> 1:57:48.540]  So many people still believe the mainstream media that this stuff didn't exist.
[1:57:48.540 --> 1:58:04.540]  But how the Royal Institute of International Affairs works, how the CFR they created in 24 on Pratt Street, New York works, how this new Russian model works, is they go in, they give you unlimited Rothschild Rockefeller money, if you'll get in business with them to then undermine and bring down the countries.
[1:58:04.540 --> 1:58:10.540]  And again, the globalists teamed up with the Communist Chinese. There's a big alliance there.
[1:58:10.540 --> 1:58:17.540]  Russia's in the crosshairs, and they're using this to destroy us. Superlative job, excellent job, Charlie Skelton.
[1:58:17.540 --> 1:58:19.540]  Thank you for all you do, my friend.
[1:58:19.540 --> 1:58:25.540]  No, thank you. Thank you for being there. I'm bullhorning away. It was great.
[1:58:25.540 --> 1:58:28.540]  All right, we'll talk to you again soon in the next few days. There's more things break.
[1:58:28.540 --> 1:58:32.540]  Third hour coming up on TSA. There's more with Aaron Dykes and some of your phone calls.
[1:58:32.540 --> 1:58:39.540]  But I want to say this, I'm glad Charlie mentioned the mole thing, and he gave out his email. Contact us as well. I forget to do that.
[1:58:39.540 --> 1:58:41.540]  We want the data. We'll get it.
[1:58:41.540 --> 1:58:50.540]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:50.540 --> 1:58:58.540]  You've heard Alex explaining how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[1:58:58.540 --> 1:59:06.540]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[1:59:06.540 --> 1:59:11.540]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:59:11.540 --> 1:59:16.540]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[1:59:16.540 --> 1:59:24.540]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[1:59:24.540 --> 1:59:32.540]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[1:59:32.540 --> 1:59:42.540]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works.
[1:59:42.540 --> 2:00:03.540]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[2:00:12.540 --> 2:00:34.540]  It's a beautiful day, a sunny day, I had the radio on, I was driving, trees went back, me and Dale were singing, a little runaway, I was flying.
[2:00:34.540 --> 2:00:59.540]  Running down a dream, yeah, going wherever it leads, anything was possible.
[2:00:59.540 --> 2:01:07.540]  All right, cruise control. We are live in the next 20 minutes or so, 30 minutes.
[2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:21.540]  We are joined by a gentleman who's been tirelessly fighting the paramilitary, the police pulled me below, we're totally feeding to expand their numbers against us.
[2:01:21.540 --> 2:01:32.540]  This is the Bilderberg group, 30,000 drones, checkpoints, armored pill boxes, 450 million 40-cals, checkpoints everywhere, shutting down farms, total harassment, all of this going on.
[2:01:32.540 --> 2:01:43.540]  TSA now at checkpoints everywhere, he broke that up in Michigan at rock concerts, TSA hands down the pants, TSA commanding everyone, the feds out of their jurisdiction, not even sworn police.
[2:01:43.540 --> 2:01:51.540]  He's the guy that gets stuff to the scanners to show they're a fraud, they try to censor the media, they threaten the media, he's got the blog TSA out of our pants.
[2:01:51.540 --> 2:01:58.540]  It's now come out, they're hiring pedophiles across the board as the commanders of the TSA of course, now they take the children away to a special room.
[2:01:58.540 --> 2:02:11.540]  I guess rape rooms weren't real in Saddam's country, but they are here, genital rape rooms, and now Congresswomen are coming out saying yes, they're hiring pedos as the commanders to pilfer our children in savage pedophile attacks.
[2:02:11.540 --> 2:02:22.540]  Yes, this is land of the pedophile kingdom. Joining us is the gentleman who has TSA out of our pants, and I want to thank you, Rob Corbett, for joining us.
[2:02:22.540 --> 2:02:27.540]  We're going to break in three minutes, but tell us, tell us the latest, you evil John Corbett.
[2:02:27.540 --> 2:02:33.540]  I know I got Rob on the line with me, I'm sorry, I know it's John Corbett, I knew it was John Corbett, and I was the last man there.
[2:02:33.540 --> 2:02:37.540]  Let's just call you Rob Corbett. John Corbett, thank you for coming on with us today.
[2:02:37.540 --> 2:02:42.540]  Thanks Alex, how are you?
[2:02:42.540 --> 2:02:53.540]  I am doing a crazy down the road live experimental transmission with experimental technologies, but it is good to have you here. Tell us what's coming up with the TSA rape rooms.
[2:02:53.540 --> 2:03:01.540]  Well, lots of good stuff. Actually, one of the more interesting things that just happened recently is one of my lawsuits against the TSA.
[2:03:01.540 --> 2:03:13.540]  One of the things that I'm doing over is a record request. I asked the TSA and the local airport government for some video of me going through the checkpoint, and they told me it didn't exist.
[2:03:13.540 --> 2:03:19.540]  And eventually, I kept pressing, what are these camera domes that are up there? What are all these?
[2:03:19.540 --> 2:03:31.540]  They said, well, we couldn't tell you whether or not they existed. They essentially lied to me in a Freedom of Information Act request, denying the existence of video games for security purposes.
[2:03:31.540 --> 2:03:43.540]  They don't lie to me, all they do is lie. They even lie when the truth would serve them better.
[2:03:43.540 --> 2:04:04.540]  It's true, and it's just a pattern of hiding things from the media, which we saw when my video came out. They warned reporters not to cover it, and now we're seeing it again with the scandal that we're seeing in Florida with a whole slew of TSA scanners being disciplined for some sort of not following procedures that the TSA hasn't actually released yet.
[2:04:04.540 --> 2:04:14.540]  The speculation might be that it's kind of a revolt against groping the passengers, so that'll be interesting to see how that plays out.
[2:04:14.540 --> 2:04:35.540]  Now, I've talked to TSA who just got it for jobs, and they phased it in years ago, and they need the money, that they have been cutting back the groping, and that the feds are saying, break their will, squeeze the genitals.
[2:04:35.540 --> 2:04:46.540]  The government is God, that the drones are here, the checkpoints are here, and the new flag of America will be a child with a man grabbing them, dragging them into a closed-door area to strip them down as they cry.
[2:04:46.540 --> 2:04:55.540]  And if daddy gets mad, airport police are called into Taser, and if the neck needs to be broken, and this has happened several times, you will be murdered. You will be murdered if your child cries and you fight back.
[2:04:55.540 --> 2:05:00.540]  We'll be right back with someone fighting the pedophiles. Stay with us.
[2:05:00.540 --> 2:05:09.540]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoods Direct. As a listener, you know why you need to have a supply of the best storeable food on the planet.

[2:07:00.540 --> 2:07:12.540]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[2:07:12.540 --> 2:07:33.540]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[2:07:33.540 --> 2:07:45.540]  Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't. We turn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans. Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[2:08:04.540 --> 2:08:31.540]  I'm Alex Jones, coming to you live from the road, and we have gotten back right close to the Texas homeland, the Texas headquarters, deep in the heart of Texas, geographically, right in the middle of Texas.
[2:08:31.540 --> 2:08:43.540]  Good old Austin, Texas. And boy, is it good to be back in our beloved Texas, as beautiful as Virginia and Arkansas and Tennessee are. I tell you, I love my state of Texas.
[2:08:43.540 --> 2:08:52.540]  That's where all my Ken folks are, and where they're all buried right back to the 1830s. And so it is good to be back here, deep in the heart of Texas.
[2:08:52.540 --> 2:09:03.540]  All right, John Corbett, who sued the TSA, infiltrated, exposed them. There's a revolt inside TSA that's been confirmed over the naked body scanners and cancer clusters.
[2:09:03.540 --> 2:09:13.540]  Also, the TSA is refusing to grow up, genitals. They know it's all a fraud. It's in the news that Al Qaeda's CIA funded. They understand they're being told now it's the libertarians of the new terrorists.
[2:09:13.540 --> 2:09:22.540]  The TSA is starting to wake up, and he has now confirmed, as it's been in the Houston Chronicle, it's been all over the country, they got highway checkpoints, bus station checkpoints, they are.
[2:09:22.540 --> 2:09:34.540]  I've seen it in Miami where they grow up, the children's genitals, take their shirts off at bus stations. But now it's all 50 states with the Army, with the Marine Corps, with National Guard, with firearms.
[2:09:34.540 --> 2:09:47.540]  TSA, it's outside of spree decor, outside of law, they're not sworn bonded, they command the military, the police, they are homeland securities, weird potbellied brown shirt like Hitler had.
[2:09:47.540 --> 2:09:58.540]  Stalin had a disheveled shirt hanging out, group that was over the military and police. Because there's always, even in old empires, some spree decor in the system.
[2:09:58.540 --> 2:10:11.540]  Because old smart police systems know if you're disgraceful, you'll be hated. So tyrannies always create kind of a disposable diaper thug that has quasi-police powers that is the new commander.
[2:10:11.540 --> 2:10:21.540]  And so they can be flushed and given a night of the long nights of your studied history. So the TSA is waking up. Give us the big data dump on them hitting the streets, the internal warfare, your lawsuits.
[2:10:21.540 --> 2:10:32.540]  Of course, his blog spot is TSA out of our pants. Give us that actual URL, John Corbett with big breaking news. They've called the media. These memos have come out.
[2:10:32.540 --> 2:10:43.540]  And TSA has said, do not interview him if you know what's good for you. Now the TSA tells the media what to do in America. They are our gods, our kings, our rulers, our occupiers, for the foreign bankers.
[2:10:43.540 --> 2:10:46.540]  John Corbett, you've got the floor. Tell us what's happening.
[2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:58.540]  Sure. Well, you mentioned the incident that I found a week or so ago at a music festival. I traveled to a music festival in Detroit, Michigan. It's a pretty quiet city nowadays.
[2:10:58.540 --> 2:11:06.540]  There's a lot of abandoned buildings and then just neighborhoods that look like they once were probably full of people but now are empty.
[2:11:06.540 --> 2:11:20.540]  So standing out in that is a group of TSA inspectors wandering around outside the festival. These people say that they're there. They can look because there's transification in the area.
[2:11:20.540 --> 2:11:31.540]  There's a light rail there, so that's how they're justified. And these guys are armed. These guys look just like police officers. They even wore vest that said police.
[2:11:31.540 --> 2:11:38.540]  But upon closer look, they were TSA inspectors. And then inside the music festival, we found...
[2:11:38.540 --> 2:11:52.540]  And again, the inspector means... I don't want to start over, but to explain how this works, it's the Viper teams expanding out and they now do the hands on the groin and the bag search all over the country outside of jurisdiction.
[2:11:52.540 --> 2:11:57.540]  No warrants, like there's a magic wand. They just do whatever they want. Please continue.
[2:11:57.540 --> 2:12:06.540]  Correct. We've heard the stories about them at the Amtrak stations, at the Greyhound stations, all over the country, even at highways sometimes.
[2:12:06.540 --> 2:12:18.540]  And they're conducting those kinds of searches. And the ones that I encountered weren't actually searching. They were just kind of wandering, standing there like they were trying to establish their presence or something.
[2:12:18.540 --> 2:12:21.540]  It's an acclimator.
[2:12:21.540 --> 2:12:23.540]  Absolutely.
[2:12:23.540 --> 2:12:31.540]  Absolutely. I don't think that most people thought anything of it because they just see a bunch of guys that look like police, but a little bit closer.
[2:12:31.540 --> 2:12:40.540]  These guys are TSA, the Department of Homeland Security policing, the streets of America now.
[2:12:40.540 --> 2:12:48.540]  Yeah, they're federal police, but they're not real police, and they violate the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution with their submission hold of the genitals.
[2:12:48.540 --> 2:12:56.540]  Your children, your wife, please continue. The old ladies crying, the strip searches. This is the pure delivery into hell.
[2:12:56.540 --> 2:12:57.540]  Continue.
[2:12:57.540 --> 2:13:03.540]  Sure. So in addition to them, I found customs agents, border patrol agents inside of the music festival.
[2:13:03.540 --> 2:13:17.540]  Now Detroit is a border city. It's right next to Canada. But the question remains, what kind of illegal immigration or whatever they might be looking for is happening inside of a music festival?
[2:13:17.540 --> 2:13:23.540]  The fact of the matter is no one is actually crossing the border at the same time as they're enjoying the festival.
[2:13:23.540 --> 2:13:25.540]  So now we have TSA.
[2:13:25.540 --> 2:13:27.540]  It's a power grab.
[2:13:27.540 --> 2:13:35.540]  Yeah, absolutely. And then we have customs and border patrol inside policing. And I asked them, do you guys stand in this park normally?
[2:13:35.540 --> 2:13:47.540]  And they said, well, you know, we can go wherever we want because, you know, we can enforce state and federal law, you know, we're within, you know, however many miles of the border. And that's just the way it is.
[2:13:47.540 --> 2:13:49.540]  And, you know, we've all heard at least.
[2:13:49.540 --> 2:13:50.540]  Yeah, let me stop you.
[2:13:50.540 --> 2:13:53.540]  Yeah.
[2:13:53.540 --> 2:14:04.540]  It's called a constitution-free zone. It's not law. 100 miles in, we drove south of San Antonio to go to the beach with my children three weeks ago.
[2:14:04.540 --> 2:14:14.540]  Just south of San Antonio, more than 200 miles from the border, they had border patrol with license plate readers and they were not pulling over illegals.
[2:14:14.540 --> 2:14:20.540]  I've confirmed they're now harassing citizens. They are now border patrol everywhere.
[2:14:20.540 --> 2:14:22.540]  And there's illegal aliens to your left and your right.
[2:14:22.540 --> 2:14:28.540]  Day labor sites, the cities pay for it. The banks take their cards. It's a total federal takeover.
[2:14:28.540 --> 2:14:36.540]  The CFR came out four days ago and said they're going to have army in every city to work with the SWAT teams and kill U.S. citizens.
[2:14:36.540 --> 2:14:41.540]  They said we're going to call out airstrikes on U.S. citizens.
[2:14:41.540 --> 2:14:43.540]  Absolutely. Look at where they're starting.
[2:14:43.540 --> 2:14:50.540]  They're going to a city like Detroit where the people there, you know, they need additional police protection there.
[2:14:50.540 --> 2:14:55.540]  The Detroit Police Department is cash-strapped and small and it's a big city to patrol.
[2:14:55.540 --> 2:15:02.540]  So they're going to be a little bit more accepting of the police, kind of like in the airports, anything to keep us safer.
[2:15:02.540 --> 2:15:08.540]  So they're systematically targeting these locations where they're going to get a little bit less resistance.
[2:15:08.540 --> 2:15:14.540]  And then once they're in Detroit, once they're in these other cities that have kind of half-hardly allowed them, they're going to say,
[2:15:14.540 --> 2:15:19.540]  well, why can't we expand to New York if you just didn't Detroit? Why can't we expand to Miami, Los Angeles?
[2:15:19.540 --> 2:15:21.540]  So that's what we're going to see now.
[2:15:21.540 --> 2:15:26.540]  And they're already there. Well, I mean, everything you're saying is spot-on.
[2:15:26.540 --> 2:15:33.540]  This is a planned rollout. The globalists, we have the documents imploded Detroit on purpose, paid to ship all the last jobs out.
[2:15:33.540 --> 2:15:37.540]  Now they're going to bulldoze a third of it. They're in Houston. They're in Dallas. They're everywhere.
[2:15:37.540 --> 2:15:43.540]  And they just show up now and say, we can be wherever we want. This is amazing, isn't it?
[2:15:43.540 --> 2:15:47.540]  It's absolutely amazing. And one has to wonder why it doesn't stop.
[2:15:47.540 --> 2:15:51.540]  Where are our legislators getting rid of this Constitution-free zone?
[2:15:51.540 --> 2:15:59.540]  That was something that was invented by the court system, Constitution-free zone, to control the jurisdiction of customs and border patrol.
[2:15:59.540 --> 2:16:02.540]  So why isn't legislation bringing these guys in?
[2:16:02.540 --> 2:16:09.540]  And not even just for civil rights purposes, but for practically use purposes, we have a border that needs to be patrolled.
[2:16:09.540 --> 2:16:15.540]  Why are there these guys in music festivals not actually on the border patrolling it?
[2:16:15.540 --> 2:16:20.540]  Total federal acclimation. I mean, I've driven through checkpoints. You name it, with Army Marines.
[2:16:20.540 --> 2:16:24.540]  They've got firearms, DWI checkpoints. They admit it is the takeover.
[2:16:24.540 --> 2:16:30.540]  They've had troops in police uniforms for at least 24 years, killing citizens.
[2:16:30.540 --> 2:16:35.540]  And that's in my film, Road to Terony, killing them. They wear generic police uniforms.
[2:16:35.540 --> 2:16:37.540]  Same thing you saw. I mean, those could have been...
[2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:42.540]  They had Marines engaging me just three days ago.
[2:16:42.540 --> 2:16:48.540]  They had Marines going, I'm really support you and grabbing my hand and trying to take their thumb and jabbing it and smiling at me
[2:16:48.540 --> 2:16:51.540]  and telling people leave and threatening people.
[2:16:51.540 --> 2:16:57.540]  This is America. We face Marines in Psyops trying to go protest in America.
[2:16:57.540 --> 2:17:00.540]  Okay? This is total treason. It's totally criminal.
[2:17:00.540 --> 2:17:07.540]  Now tell folks about the latest savage abuses of women and old people in the TSA rape rooms.
[2:17:07.540 --> 2:17:17.540]  That story just seems to be getting old by now. Every week or sometimes even less, we hear of another person that was violated by the TSA.
[2:17:17.540 --> 2:17:25.540]  These private rooms that the TSA has for additional screening that they'll so nicely offer you, don't ever do it.
[2:17:25.540 --> 2:17:30.540]  The TSA will molest you enough in public to let them go into private.
[2:17:30.540 --> 2:17:38.540]  It's just giving them a license to do things to you without any kind of view of the public without any kind of recourse.
[2:17:38.540 --> 2:17:45.540]  My advice strongest to travelers is to never go into a back room. It's not worth it.
[2:17:45.540 --> 2:17:49.540]  Even if you have to miss your flight, it's not worth going into the TSA back room.
[2:17:49.540 --> 2:17:54.540]  And let me expand on this. First, it's body scanners and only groping if you don't.
[2:17:54.540 --> 2:18:02.540]  Now that you body scan, you get groped everywhere. They admit that their plan is to make everyone go in the rooms finally,
[2:18:02.540 --> 2:18:06.540]  who they want to pull out in the screening process and be strip searched.
[2:18:06.540 --> 2:18:12.540]  This is their admissions. So they're phasing it in and lying about taking the clothes off old women.
[2:18:12.540 --> 2:18:18.540]  Just yesterday it was in the news where they went in public, took the woman's shirt off, grabbed her breast in front of everyone.
[2:18:18.540 --> 2:18:23.540]  If you cry, the police come. I mean, this is your children cry as they now drag them away to the rape rooms.
[2:18:23.540 --> 2:18:27.540]  These are physical, under code, under law, rape rooms.
[2:18:27.540 --> 2:18:34.540]  And as you said, it was seized in and now they have these armored bulletproof rape rooms.
[2:18:34.540 --> 2:18:37.540]  It was 200 first ordered. Now there's an additional 1,000 being ordered.
[2:18:37.540 --> 2:18:43.540]  Bulletproof rape rooms at mobile checkpoints. So they're going to rape you on the side of the road.
[2:18:43.540 --> 2:18:45.540]  What do you make of this?
[2:18:45.540 --> 2:18:53.540]  I don't even know. I haven't even gotten that far. I'm still working on the airport. But in the airport, you're absolutely right.
[2:18:53.540 --> 2:18:59.540]  And it's important for everyone to know that you can say, no, this TSA does not have the right to detain you.
[2:18:59.540 --> 2:19:06.540]  And they often tend to get around it by having you arrested for yelling and screaming. Just don't do that.
[2:19:06.540 --> 2:19:11.540]  If you can, just calmly tell the TSA, I decline your search.
[2:19:11.540 --> 2:19:16.540]  And you know what? You might not fly that day. It's totally worth it.
[2:19:16.540 --> 2:19:20.540]  It's like, if you had to be raped in order to fly, would you do it? Obviously not.
[2:19:20.540 --> 2:19:26.540]  But yet some people risk it with the TSA. It's just not good. It's not worth it.
[2:19:26.540 --> 2:19:31.540]  File complaints go to a different airport on a different day. You'll make it.
[2:19:31.540 --> 2:19:33.540]  We're going to Brighton.
[2:19:33.540 --> 2:19:37.540]  You're absolutely right. And again, if they can get the beachhead at the airport,
[2:19:37.540 --> 2:19:41.540]  as I told people 10 years ago, they'll be at highways, they'll be for your jobs.
[2:19:41.540 --> 2:19:44.540]  They admit they're going to take over. You're not going to get a job if they don't say.
[2:19:44.540 --> 2:19:48.540]  It's a national security state run by Homeland Security.
[2:19:48.540 --> 2:19:54.540]  Homeland Security is the foreign banker occupational takeover to absorb the Republic.
[2:19:54.540 --> 2:19:59.540]  We'll be back with another segment with John Corbett of TSA Out of My Pants
[2:19:59.540 --> 2:20:02.540]  to get the latest he's working on in his losses.
[2:20:02.540 --> 2:20:08.540]  I'm the author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box. I want you to know some very important information.
[2:20:08.540 --> 2:20:14.540]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[2:20:14.540 --> 2:20:17.540]  at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[2:20:17.540 --> 2:20:23.540]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[2:20:23.540 --> 2:20:27.540]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs

[2:21:07.540 --> 2:21:10.540]  The tiredness, moodiness, and lack of sex drive may not be your fault.
[2:21:10.540 --> 2:21:13.540]  They may be the results of declining testosterone.
[2:21:13.540 --> 2:21:17.540]  As we age, men start to lose from 1-3% of testosterone each year,
[2:21:17.540 --> 2:21:21.540]  and by age 50, what you thought could be your lifestyle or marriage could just simply be you.
[2:21:21.540 --> 2:21:23.540]  Don't accept this and fight back.

[2:24:37.540 --> 2:24:42.540]  We are nearing the Info Wars Command Center, but we're in famous I-35 traffic,
[2:24:42.540 --> 2:24:45.540]  because the globalists will never expand these roads.
[2:24:45.540 --> 2:24:48.540]  They just built giant toll roads 20 miles outside town nobody can use.
[2:24:48.540 --> 2:24:50.540]  Now they want to turn this into a toll road.
[2:24:50.540 --> 2:24:53.540]  It's illegal, you can't take an existing road, but so what?
[2:24:53.540 --> 2:24:55.540]  People talk to Richard some about it coming up.
[2:24:55.540 --> 2:25:00.540]  John, I know I'm cutting in frothing, because it's freaking me out.
[2:25:00.540 --> 2:25:04.540]  I'm not kidding. They've ordered armored pill boxes for the TSA.
[2:25:04.540 --> 2:25:06.540]  They're now on highways pulling people out of cars.
[2:25:06.540 --> 2:25:10.540]  They've got Border Patrol 200 miles inside Texas, harassing citizens.
[2:25:10.540 --> 2:25:16.540]  In San Antonio, they've got the Air Force MPs out on the street searching people.
[2:25:16.540 --> 2:25:20.540]  They come over with side arms in America and go, we're going to search at the Riverwalk.
[2:25:20.540 --> 2:25:23.540]  This country is going into martial law.
[2:25:23.540 --> 2:25:28.540]  In the five minutes we've got left with you here, John of TSA out of our pants,
[2:25:28.540 --> 2:25:30.540]  what else is going on with the TSA?
[2:25:30.540 --> 2:25:33.540]  You mentioned earlier there's a revolt against them,
[2:25:33.540 --> 2:25:39.540]  and they're trying to tell them basically that they've got to grow harder.
[2:25:39.540 --> 2:25:47.540]  We saw recently that the TSA has quietly disciplined and fired a bunch of TSA screeners in the state of Florida.
[2:25:47.540 --> 2:25:51.540]  They haven't gone as far as to say exactly why they were disciplined,
[2:25:51.540 --> 2:25:55.540]  other than to say that they weren't following proper procedures.
[2:25:55.540 --> 2:26:03.540]  In the last few months, I've interviewed several TSA screeners that have come to me to tell me stories of TSA abuse.
[2:26:03.540 --> 2:26:07.540]  One thing that I've learned is that these guys actually don't like the body scanners.
[2:26:07.540 --> 2:26:13.540]  They don't like the groping. 99% of the TSA screeners are disgusted by what they have to do,
[2:26:13.540 --> 2:26:17.540]  and they're disgusted by how they're treated by the public as a result.
[2:26:17.540 --> 2:26:23.540]  You spend all day groping people, and you're going to get a lot of complaints about why are you being such a fascist,
[2:26:23.540 --> 2:26:26.540]  and why is this becoming a police state, and why are you helping?
[2:26:26.540 --> 2:26:28.540]  People don't like that.
[2:26:28.540 --> 2:26:34.540]  The people that work with the TSA wish that it would go back to the way it was right before the TSA started,
[2:26:34.540 --> 2:26:39.540]  where there was normal metal detectors, if there were normal pat-downs,
[2:26:39.540 --> 2:26:42.540]  if there was something that needed to be resolved, and that's it.
[2:26:42.540 --> 2:26:46.540]  So apparently, there were several screeners that refused to follow a procedure.
[2:26:46.540 --> 2:26:50.540]  We don't know exactly what happened yet, and the TSA is trying not to tell us.
[2:26:50.540 --> 2:26:56.540]  But there's a lot of investigation going on. It's going to come out sooner or later.
[2:26:56.540 --> 2:27:00.540]  Well, let me raise this next point, since you mentioned that, Mr. Corbett,
[2:27:00.540 --> 2:27:04.540]  that we know there was a revolt in Boston as they put scanners in eight years ago,
[2:27:04.540 --> 2:27:07.540]  and they've had huge cancer clusters, seven-fold increase.
[2:27:07.540 --> 2:27:10.540]  We also know that a lot of TSA agents ask for my autograph.
[2:27:10.540 --> 2:27:12.540]  They say, hey, we don't like what's happening.
[2:27:12.540 --> 2:27:15.540]  But it's always the supervisor when you opt out that charge is over,
[2:27:15.540 --> 2:27:19.540]  who's got the handlebar mustache or looks like a pedo.
[2:27:19.540 --> 2:27:22.540]  And now we learn all over the country, they are pedophiles.
[2:27:22.540 --> 2:27:29.540]  The leaders, the commanders of the TSA and the commanders of the gates in Pennsylvania and Dallas and all over
[2:27:29.540 --> 2:27:35.540]  are pedophiles, convicted or defrocked pedophiles of small children.
[2:27:35.540 --> 2:27:41.540]  So the commanders are pedophiles, and what the TSA is at the airport is a testing ground
[2:27:41.540 --> 2:27:46.540]  to find the army of darkness that will carry out the new ground war
[2:27:46.540 --> 2:27:48.540]  at the checkpoints against the American people.
[2:27:48.540 --> 2:27:50.540]  So the cops will stand back.
[2:27:50.540 --> 2:27:53.540]  They'll deliver you to the armored rape room on the side of the highway.
[2:27:53.540 --> 2:27:56.540]  I'm not kidding, folks. I'm serious.
[2:27:56.540 --> 2:28:04.540]  Yeah, I mean, it doesn't seem that way. And then you can imagine these defrocked priests or other sex offenders
[2:28:04.540 --> 2:28:07.540]  sitting in their little manager's office watching on camera,
[2:28:07.540 --> 2:28:11.540]  those little boys and little girls being groped by their underlings.
[2:28:11.540 --> 2:28:18.540]  I've had a lot of problems with and I've seen a lot of other people have problems with these mid-level supervisors.
[2:28:18.540 --> 2:28:25.540]  They seem to have this kind of disregard for the people when complaints are made
[2:28:25.540 --> 2:28:26.540]  that we don't even see it.
[2:28:26.540 --> 2:28:27.540]  The pedo visors.
[2:28:27.540 --> 2:28:29.540]  Sure, pedophiles helpers.
[2:28:29.540 --> 2:28:31.540]  Sure, absolutely.
[2:28:31.540 --> 2:28:35.540]  You don't even see that kind of attitude usually from the front line
[2:28:35.540 --> 2:28:38.540]  of the blue-shirted people that are running the checkpoint.
[2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:42.540]  Usually it's kind of just a we have to do our job attitude.
[2:28:42.540 --> 2:28:46.540]  And if you've ever gotten a pat down that didn't involve touching a genitals,
[2:28:46.540 --> 2:28:50.540]  that's exactly why it's not because the TSA wasn't supposed to touch a genitals.
[2:28:50.540 --> 2:28:53.540]  It's because these greeners just chose not to.
[2:28:53.540 --> 2:28:58.540]  Because they're sick and tired of touching people's balls all day long, essentially.
[2:28:58.540 --> 2:29:01.540]  These mid-level supervisors are a little bit different.
[2:29:01.540 --> 2:29:03.540]  We call them transportation security managers.
[2:29:03.540 --> 2:29:07.540]  And above them, they have the federal security directors, the FSDs.
[2:29:07.540 --> 2:29:11.540]  And these people actually set what the local policy is
[2:29:11.540 --> 2:29:15.540]  and they ensure that your grope is nice and thorough.
[2:29:15.540 --> 2:29:16.540]  Well, I want to be clear.
[2:29:16.540 --> 2:29:18.540]  Ron Paul has said it, Jesse Ventura.
[2:29:18.540 --> 2:29:20.540]  I've witnessed it repeatedly with Ventura.
[2:29:20.540 --> 2:29:24.540]  They will miss USA described as being lifted off the ground.
[2:29:24.540 --> 2:29:27.540]  They went in her pants and went in her body.
[2:29:27.540 --> 2:29:30.540]  Okay, and that's what the feds are telling them to do.
[2:29:30.540 --> 2:29:33.540]  I want to finish up for a few minutes with you, the Big Builderberg breaking news.
[2:29:33.540 --> 2:29:38.540]  And more, we'll even take some calls, 800-25-99231 coming up.
[2:29:38.540 --> 2:29:42.540]  A couple more minutes with our guest, 800-25-99231.
[2:29:42.540 --> 2:29:46.540]  Look at the skyline of Austin, Texas out there as we go to break.
[2:29:46.540 --> 2:29:49.540]  We'll show you the Skycam.
[2:29:49.540 --> 2:29:53.540]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[2:29:53.540 --> 2:30:22.540]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:23.540 --> 2:30:25.540]  We'll see you next time.
[2:30:53.540 --> 2:31:05.540]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[2:31:05.540 --> 2:31:09.540]  As a listener, you know why you need to have a supply of the best horrible food on the planet.
[2:31:09.540 --> 2:31:13.540]  Every day, we document the attempts to take control of our lives.
[2:31:13.540 --> 2:31:17.540]  But there's one thing we can all control, your greatest dependency, food.
[2:31:17.540 --> 2:31:24.540]  eFoodsDirect products are made with only the best ingredients and none of the trash and contaminants like trans fats, GMOs or MSG.
[2:31:24.540 --> 2:31:27.540]  This food is nutrient dense and tastes great.
[2:31:27.540 --> 2:31:31.540]  It's simple to make, portable, and has a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[2:31:31.540 --> 2:31:35.540]  Now with eFoodsDirect, you'll get the most affordable, best tasting food you can buy.
[2:31:35.540 --> 2:31:37.540]  And the new products and pricing will blow you away.

[2:31:42.540 --> 2:31:50.540]  You just can't afford to ignore this. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com for slash Alex for specials.

[2:31:56.540 --> 2:32:20.540]  More the best, for less, guaranteed.
[2:32:20.540 --> 2:32:28.540]  Number three. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:32:28.540 --> 2:32:35.540]  Number four. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:32:35.540 --> 2:32:40.540]  Number five. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:32:40.540 --> 2:32:45.540]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:32:45.540 --> 2:32:51.540]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:32:51.540 --> 2:33:00.540]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:33:00.540 --> 2:33:16.540]  Number five. Free will burn it. Free will burn it.
[2:33:16.540 --> 2:33:21.540]  I'll tell you, they've had nothing but highway songs today.
[2:33:21.540 --> 2:33:31.540]  Here comes the TSA, the evil on the road. Coming for your children, perversion, I'm told.
[2:33:31.540 --> 2:33:40.540]  Free perverts burn it. Just him, your children, from the filthy armies of government scum.
[2:33:40.540 --> 2:33:53.540]  Evil potbellies burn it. Burning for your children and your wife.
[2:33:53.540 --> 2:34:01.540]  All right. You guys have not had any of our regular liners today. Which is fine. Kind of fun.
[2:34:01.540 --> 2:34:08.540]  That's another of that commy music. We're going to cut the sky feed off here so folks don't know where our exit is.
[2:34:08.540 --> 2:34:16.540]  But we've still got the video feed here in the bus. We're only like five miles away from the command center, infowars.com.
[2:34:16.540 --> 2:34:23.540]  Man, I am fired up. John Corbett, an evil person that doesn't like being grown up by weirdos violating his fourth amendment,
[2:34:23.540 --> 2:34:29.540]  and doesn't like being radiated in strip searches and being lied to constantly or illegal, not even cops,
[2:34:29.540 --> 2:34:35.540]  federally out of their jurisdiction setting up checkpoints everywhere across the United States.
[2:34:35.540 --> 2:34:41.540]  He is bad. So am I. We're all horrible here. We should just love all the things they're doing to us.
[2:34:41.540 --> 2:34:49.540]  In closing, sir, other tidbits, other things people should know about out there because here's my bottom line.
[2:34:49.540 --> 2:34:54.540]  I want you to comment on this and they give us any other little tidbits you've got. Here's my bottom line.
[2:34:54.540 --> 2:35:00.540]  If they fail at the airports and the streets, their federal takeover is over. This is the martial law rollout.
[2:35:00.540 --> 2:35:03.540]  They're admitting they're going to use the Pentagon against us. Huge treason is happening.
[2:35:03.540 --> 2:35:09.540]  But if they can't get average law-abiding citizens who aren't used to the system, aren't used to a perp walk, a perp lineup,
[2:35:09.540 --> 2:35:13.540]  and that's what this is, a custodial arrest, they can't get their martial law in.
[2:35:13.540 --> 2:35:20.540]  Everything rests on defeating the TSA. That's why I salute DrugsReport.com and WorldNetDaily.com and Infowars.com,
[2:35:20.540 --> 2:35:25.540]  and all of you out there fighting these monsters from the wilderness, we're starting to have victories.
[2:35:25.540 --> 2:35:31.540]  Do you agree with that statement and are we having victories, Mr. Corbett, of TSA, out of our pants, you dirty perverts?
[2:35:31.540 --> 2:35:38.540]  I think we are having victories. One of the things I like to tell people is take that, if you see something,
[2:35:38.540 --> 2:35:44.540]  say something, adage, and use it for good. So if you see that there's a customs and border patrol agent
[2:35:44.540 --> 2:35:48.540]  outside of where he's supposed to be, say something, go up to him, ask him what he's doing there.
[2:35:48.540 --> 2:35:51.540]  Take his picture. Make him uncomfortable with what he's doing.
[2:35:51.540 --> 2:35:58.540]  Let him know that the citizens are actually watching. When I approached the TSA inspectors outside the music festival,
[2:35:58.540 --> 2:36:02.540]  they were shocked that anyone had even heard of what a Viper team was.
[2:36:02.540 --> 2:36:08.540]  So it's about time we take a little closer look. What is that patch on the side of that police officer's uniform
[2:36:08.540 --> 2:36:12.540]  that you don't recognize? Figure it out. Ask them.
[2:36:12.540 --> 2:36:18.540]  And the same in the airport, the goal is to take up as much of their time as possible.
[2:36:18.540 --> 2:36:23.540]  So if you can opt out of a body scanner, do so, because you know what, they're going to grope you anyway.
[2:36:23.540 --> 2:36:28.540]  Now, half the people that go through the body scanners end up being padded down anyway because they say that something
[2:36:28.540 --> 2:36:31.540]  in the body scanner couldn't detect any of it, because these things don't actually work.
[2:36:31.540 --> 2:36:36.540]  Well, look, if you're a good looking woman, it's over. You're getting hardcore grope down.
[2:36:36.540 --> 2:36:38.540]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:36:38.540 --> 2:36:41.540]  Yes, you might as well not give them a nude picture in the process as well.
[2:36:41.540 --> 2:36:47.540]  The fact of the matter is the TSA needs to screen about one passenger every 10 seconds at our nation's check point
[2:36:47.540 --> 2:36:50.540]  in order to not have the line back up and people miss their flight.
[2:36:50.540 --> 2:36:54.540]  It takes about five minutes to do a full pad down if you opt out of a search.
[2:36:54.540 --> 2:37:00.540]  So if only a small percentage of people actually opted out of the body scanners, they have to stop using them.
[2:37:00.540 --> 2:37:05.540]  Whenever an opt-out happens in the airport, you'll see that people start getting redirected to the metal detector lines
[2:37:05.540 --> 2:37:10.540]  because they can't handle the time.
[2:37:10.540 --> 2:37:16.540]  You just hit the key. That's why my crew and everybody I know, when you fly out of Austin,
[2:37:16.540 --> 2:37:20.540]  if you do the body scanner, most of the time they grope you anyways, when you say no,
[2:37:20.540 --> 2:37:24.540]  they put you behind a line, try to make you miss your flight and laugh at you,
[2:37:24.540 --> 2:37:28.540]  and keep saying, you got to miss your flight, got to miss your flight and laugh,
[2:37:28.540 --> 2:37:34.540]  especially there's a guy with rastafarian hair, I know he watches,
[2:37:34.540 --> 2:37:38.540]  who thinks it's very, very funny at the Bergstrom, but they all do it.
[2:37:38.540 --> 2:37:43.540]  And one guy put his glove on and said, it's time for my pleasure with McBreen and Marcos
[2:37:43.540 --> 2:37:49.540]  when we sent them up to Georgia to cover the army was involved in killing the guy
[2:37:49.540 --> 2:37:53.540]  that wouldn't stop having chickens legally, all part of the Homeland Security takeover.
[2:37:53.540 --> 2:37:59.540]  Yeah, you heard it here, murdering us, all being announced here, and so yes, this is how we resist.
[2:37:59.540 --> 2:38:03.540]  That's why when they got National Opt-Out Day, they just stopped scanning for five days
[2:38:03.540 --> 2:38:07.540]  because they knew it would show that they were a joke, but it also shows the terror threat's fake
[2:38:07.540 --> 2:38:10.540]  because how could they just turn them off for five days?
[2:38:10.540 --> 2:38:13.540]  It shows it is a power grab scam, you're right.
[2:38:13.540 --> 2:38:18.540]  In fact, I think I'm going to start flying more again and just opting out with pleasure everywhere
[2:38:18.540 --> 2:38:23.540]  and just get there two hours early, make a big long scene out of it with these terrorist helpers.
[2:38:23.540 --> 2:38:24.540]  Go ahead.
[2:38:24.540 --> 2:38:25.540]  Absolutely, Alex.
[2:38:25.540 --> 2:38:26.540]  Go ahead, John.
[2:38:26.540 --> 2:38:30.540]  If you encounter screeners like that in the future that are telling you about how they're going to get pleasure
[2:38:30.540 --> 2:38:32.540]  out of it and how they're going to make you miss your flight,
[2:38:32.540 --> 2:38:36.540]  ask for a law enforcement officer, call the police, and honestly,
[2:38:36.540 --> 2:38:42.540]  if you seem like you're calm and in control of yourself, the police don't like the TSA.
[2:38:42.540 --> 2:38:45.540]  The police think that the TSA are encroaching on them,
[2:38:45.540 --> 2:38:50.540]  and yes, if you're throwing a fit at the airport, they're going to take you away in handcuffs.
[2:38:50.540 --> 2:38:53.540]  But if you say, officer, I just like someone to watch this pat down
[2:38:53.540 --> 2:38:57.540]  because I've been abused by TSA pat down before, and I'd like you to make sure that won't happen.
[2:38:57.540 --> 2:38:58.540]  Guess what?
[2:38:58.540 --> 2:39:02.540]  Now that's increased the time from five to 15 minutes that the TSA has you there,
[2:39:02.540 --> 2:39:05.540]  and it's getting that many fewer people.
[2:39:05.540 --> 2:39:07.540]  You know, we need another national opt-out day.
[2:39:07.540 --> 2:39:09.540]  We need to do this regularly.
[2:39:09.540 --> 2:39:14.540]  And if possible, every day should be opt-out day for anyone that's a frequent flyer.
[2:39:14.540 --> 2:39:16.540]  Just come an extra 10 minutes early to the airport.
[2:39:16.540 --> 2:39:18.540]  It's really not a big deal.
[2:39:18.540 --> 2:39:20.540]  And if they say, do you want to fly today?
[2:39:20.540 --> 2:39:21.540]  Are you worried you're going to miss your flight?
[2:39:21.540 --> 2:39:23.540]  Just tell them, it doesn't really matter.
[2:39:23.540 --> 2:39:28.540]  I can catch the next one, and then they'll drop that line.
[2:39:28.540 --> 2:39:29.540]  Absolutely.
[2:39:29.540 --> 2:39:32.540]  And I sit there and say, you know, you're all getting radiated.
[2:39:32.540 --> 2:39:34.540]  What you're doing is illegal.
[2:39:34.540 --> 2:39:35.540]  This is a federal power grab.
[2:39:35.540 --> 2:39:36.540]  You know you're on the streets.
[2:39:36.540 --> 2:39:38.540]  Do you want to live in a country like this?
[2:39:38.540 --> 2:39:40.540]  And they bring the Pito supervisor over.
[2:39:40.540 --> 2:39:42.540]  Oh, you're a troublemaker.
[2:39:42.540 --> 2:39:45.540]  And I go, no, I'm an American citizen, not a traitor like you.
[2:39:45.540 --> 2:39:49.540]  And I just real, we're going to beat you scum.
[2:39:49.540 --> 2:39:51.540]  There ain't nothing you're going to do.
[2:39:51.540 --> 2:39:55.540]  The Republic is rising, and you need to get that through your little mackerel brain.
[2:39:55.540 --> 2:39:56.540]  All right.
[2:39:56.540 --> 2:40:03.540]  Well, John Corbett, give us the exact URL of your site, your lawsuits, your slamming and mammon of the enemy.
[2:40:03.540 --> 2:40:07.540]  Yeah, it's tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com.
[2:40:07.540 --> 2:40:11.540]  And on there, you can find all sorts of legal updates about what we're doing against the TSA.
[2:40:11.540 --> 2:40:18.540]  And also just general things that are going on, new ways of encroaching on your freedom and kind of how to defend against that,
[2:40:18.540 --> 2:40:26.540]  what you can do to limit how much groping you're going to get and so forth.
[2:40:26.540 --> 2:40:27.540]  Well done.
[2:40:27.540 --> 2:40:29.540]  I appreciate you joining us.
[2:40:29.540 --> 2:40:30.540]  All right.
[2:40:30.540 --> 2:40:32.540]  Let's stand in four or five calls.
[2:40:32.540 --> 2:40:33.540]  Thank you so much, sir.
[2:40:33.540 --> 2:40:35.540]  And again, folks, it sounds like we're walking over each other.
[2:40:35.540 --> 2:40:37.540]  There's about a second and a half delay with me.
[2:40:37.540 --> 2:40:38.540]  He's on Skype.
[2:40:38.540 --> 2:40:41.540]  He's got a half second delay, so it causes some of that.
[2:40:41.540 --> 2:40:43.540]  So we're going to jam in four or five calls right here.
[2:40:43.540 --> 2:40:44.540]  Yep, we got the first one.
[2:40:44.540 --> 2:40:47.540]  And then we're going to let Aaron finish up with these big documents.
[2:40:47.540 --> 2:40:52.540]  Let's go to Brandon, or Brendan first in Wisconsin, then Will, then Julio, and others.
[2:40:52.540 --> 2:40:55.540]  Brendan, you're on the year, and the Eagle has landed.
[2:40:55.540 --> 2:41:01.540]  We're just about to arrive here at the Info Wars Command Base that exists because of your support, folks.
[2:41:01.540 --> 2:41:04.540]  Be sure and visit the online video bookstore if you want to see us continue.
[2:41:04.540 --> 2:41:05.540]  Okay, go ahead, Brendan.
[2:41:05.540 --> 2:41:07.540]  You're on the air.
[2:41:07.540 --> 2:41:08.540]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[2:41:08.540 --> 2:41:11.540]  You guys did such a great job down there at Bilderberg.
[2:41:11.540 --> 2:41:19.540]  I was one of the people that was with AFP, and we chose not to fly because of the TSA groping,
[2:41:19.540 --> 2:41:25.540]  and I'm surprised we can actually still make fun of TSA without experiencing some sort of...
[2:41:25.540 --> 2:41:34.540]  I thought they had some legislation that they were working on out of Georgia or somewhere that would prohibit any sort of mockery
[2:41:34.540 --> 2:41:41.540]  or even comical commentary regarding TSA, and I thought we should have a nice music video.
[2:41:41.540 --> 2:41:46.540]  Maybe Mike Adams could help out with that.
[2:41:46.540 --> 2:41:49.540]  Yeah, well, the answer to unconstitutional laws is ignore them.
[2:41:49.540 --> 2:41:52.540]  They say I can't make fun of their scumbag activities my First Amendment.
[2:41:52.540 --> 2:41:56.540]  They say Australians can't criticize carbon tax. Everybody together say no.
[2:41:56.540 --> 2:41:59.540]  It's time to say no to these out-of-control criminals.
[2:41:59.540 --> 2:42:08.540]  And also, being the first three people into that bar, and we really wanted to photograph the Waterloo painting,
[2:42:08.540 --> 2:42:11.540]  we had our cameras turned off, nothing was going on.
[2:42:11.540 --> 2:42:16.540]  We were discussing how to put black tape over top of the red lights so they wouldn't know that we were filming.
[2:42:16.540 --> 2:42:22.540]  We were surrounded by security. Charlie Skelton hadn't gotten there yet, and Lucredosky hadn't.
[2:42:22.540 --> 2:42:29.540]  They were on their way, probably, up the driveway, and we were just whispering about the electrical tape,
[2:42:29.540 --> 2:42:35.540]  and within a minute we were surrounded by security telling us to turn off our cameras.
[2:42:35.540 --> 2:42:40.540]  They weren't on yet, but we were just talking, whispering, and there was no one in the bar,
[2:42:40.540 --> 2:42:46.540]  except for a Pakistani-American bartender named Abdul, and ourselves, and a couple of spooks.
[2:42:46.540 --> 2:42:52.540]  And it was just amazing. They might have had some equipment in there picking up that audio, I'm not sure.
[2:42:52.540 --> 2:42:56.540]  Yeah, they did. I'm not going to go any further than that, but yes, sir.
[2:42:56.540 --> 2:42:59.540]  Okay, let's go to, thank you for the good points there.
[2:42:59.540 --> 2:43:05.540]  Let's talk to Will in Oklahoma. You're on the air worldwide at the end of our official massive Bilderberg coverage,
[2:43:05.540 --> 2:43:12.540]  but the exposure has just begun with the data dump we just got. Bilderberg Leaks, link in red, at infowars.com.
[2:43:12.540 --> 2:43:14.540]  Go ahead, Will.
[2:43:14.540 --> 2:43:19.540]  Hey, thanks, Alex. Great job at Bilderberg, and great interview with Mr. Tarpley.
[2:43:19.540 --> 2:43:24.540]  I saw yours, and also Adam Kocaches. I just wanted to make a quick point, listen to you and John.
[2:43:24.540 --> 2:43:31.540]  I have a, my cousin-in-law actually works for the TSA here in Tulsa, and I've been talking to her about
[2:43:31.540 --> 2:43:35.540]  if they're comfortable with all the procedures, and it's actually surprising.
[2:43:35.540 --> 2:43:41.540]  Most of them are actually, like John said, refusing to do the pat-downs as far as the groping goes.
[2:43:41.540 --> 2:43:46.540]  They're just doing the bare minimum of the pat-downs that they have to do, and I asked her-
[2:43:46.540 --> 2:43:51.540]  Yeah, I had one when I opted out once, and Vegas, the guy got off on it clearly,
[2:43:51.540 --> 2:43:56.540]  but I had one once just act like he was touching me, and I was like, whatever.
[2:43:56.540 --> 2:44:00.540]  But again, this is how we're going to be, this is how tyranny falls. Go ahead.
[2:44:00.540 --> 2:44:04.540]  I was going to say, it was because of the people are starting to wake up,
[2:44:04.540 --> 2:44:07.540]  and that's what she said, was that because the people are waking up,
[2:44:07.540 --> 2:44:12.540]  because more people are expressing their feelings towards, or trying to opt out of the scanners,
[2:44:12.540 --> 2:44:17.540]  and making them pat down, and, you know, reading them the right act while they're being pat-ed down,
[2:44:17.540 --> 2:44:23.540]  it's actually woken the TSA officers up to not even realizing what it is that they're exactly doing,
[2:44:23.540 --> 2:44:27.540]  and so I just wanted to make that comment about what John has said, because he's exactly right,
[2:44:27.540 --> 2:44:31.540]  and I'm seeing it right here in Tulsa.
[2:44:31.540 --> 2:44:35.540]  Good job, my friend, and again, our article is linked in red at infoawards.com.
[2:44:35.540 --> 2:44:38.540]  We need everybody to help make it go viral.
[2:44:38.540 --> 2:44:42.540]  Bilderberg leaks, ladies and gentlemen, admitting they want their world government,
[2:44:42.540 --> 2:44:47.540]  they want NATO to be at the heart of it, and so much more.
[2:44:47.540 --> 2:44:51.540]  Leaked Bilderberg documents that nationalism is dangerous.
[2:44:51.540 --> 2:44:57.540]  Infoawards exclusive obtained senators notes, minutes agenda from 1966, CONFAB,
[2:44:57.540 --> 2:44:59.540]  how to take over by stealth, it's all there.
[2:44:59.540 --> 2:45:05.540]  Just the photos we took of the documents this morning, we're about to upload a scanned PDF
[2:45:05.540 --> 2:45:08.540]  of as many as the documents as we can scan, it'll take hours.
[2:45:08.540 --> 2:45:10.540]  Incredible job to the crew.
[2:45:10.540 --> 2:45:15.540]  Let's take a few more calls before we get an update on some of the other information Aaron didn't have time to get into
[2:45:15.540 --> 2:45:17.540]  with this big Bilderberg leak.
[2:45:17.540 --> 2:45:22.540]  Let's go to Julio in Illinois, you're on the air, Julio.
[2:45:22.540 --> 2:45:27.540]  Aloha, Alex, it was a pleasure to meet you in Chantilly.
[2:45:27.540 --> 2:45:34.540]  I didn't get patted down by TSA after Bilderberg, but I must say I was a part of history with everyone that was out there.
[2:45:34.540 --> 2:45:41.540]  It was a treat to drink at the Wellington pub, just desecrating over the Bilderbergs the night before on Wednesday night.
[2:45:41.540 --> 2:45:49.540]  It was a treat, Alex. I wanted to ask you, I heard you say when we did the human sound cannon Friday afternoon, 40 feet away from them,
[2:45:49.540 --> 2:45:55.540]  is it true that the windows were shaking and they were upset?
[2:45:55.540 --> 2:46:02.540]  Yes, we got that from inside sources, but also, again, most places are 200 yards or more of forest around it,
[2:46:02.540 --> 2:46:05.540]  but the one big conference wing, and you can always tell when they're in there,
[2:46:05.540 --> 2:46:07.540]  because all of a sudden security gets around it.
[2:46:07.540 --> 2:46:11.540]  Then we run down, knowing that they're meeting, four years ago, the head of the CFR,
[2:46:11.540 --> 2:46:15.540]  Ross came out, Richard and Ross got in our face, Kissinger came out this year,
[2:46:15.540 --> 2:46:18.540]  I didn't get it on tape, everybody saw it, some got it on tape,
[2:46:18.540 --> 2:46:23.540]  and we had seven bullhorns, Daisy chained there, five or six down here, another seven or eight down here,
[2:46:23.540 --> 2:46:26.540]  but some guy brought a big jumbo giant one, we held it up,
[2:46:26.540 --> 2:46:35.540]  and somebody had the idea to put a bullhorn into that, into its speaker,
[2:46:35.540 --> 2:46:38.540]  and it caused some resonance that would instantly give,
[2:46:38.540 --> 2:46:42.540]  we were all getting migraines, Skelton had to get away, I had piercing headaches,
[2:46:42.540 --> 2:46:46.540]  you can see me trying to cover my ears, it's going while doing it, feeling nauseous,
[2:46:46.540 --> 2:46:50.540]  other people were having to get out of there, it was hitting them, we're behind this, mind you.
[2:46:50.540 --> 2:46:55.540]  Okay, this is like an LRAD, folks, and the police came out with shotguns,
[2:46:55.540 --> 2:46:58.540]  everybody had their eyes open, and globalists were running out, freaking out,
[2:46:58.540 --> 2:47:01.540]  and we're told that they had to shut the meeting down.
[2:47:01.540 --> 2:47:06.540]  I mean, it was, because imagine, it's glass windows, and we're just pounding it,
[2:47:06.540 --> 2:47:11.540]  just like, I mean, it was just like, it was off the charts.
[2:47:11.540 --> 2:47:17.540]  Let me tell you, Daisy chained bullhorns, because it does something to the diaphragm in there,
[2:47:17.540 --> 2:47:21.540]  where it just gets the maximum sound, it was deafening,
[2:47:21.540 --> 2:47:25.540]  and then they had the sirens going, I mean, it was like,
[2:47:25.540 --> 2:47:27.540]  what they did to the branch of Indians at Waco before they killed them,
[2:47:27.540 --> 2:47:29.540]  they were shooting stuff like that at them,
[2:47:29.540 --> 2:47:32.540]  let me tell you, it was being behind it, man.
[2:47:32.540 --> 2:47:38.540]  I was having to go lay on the grass, you saw me repeatedly collapsing from migraines, did you see that?
[2:47:38.540 --> 2:47:42.540]  Well, Alex, I'm telling you, I'm glad I got to interrupt those scums in their meeting,
[2:47:42.540 --> 2:47:45.540]  because I'll never forget that moment in history,
[2:47:45.540 --> 2:47:50.540]  and I even saw Rob Jacobson during the day with his iPhone and his video camera,
[2:47:50.540 --> 2:47:53.540]  giving it to the police, it's funny you mentioned, Alex, that they were saying,
[2:47:53.540 --> 2:47:55.540]  oh, we're your supporters, I was telling the police,
[2:47:55.540 --> 2:47:59.540]  if you guys are really, care about your families, if you care about freedom,
[2:47:59.540 --> 2:48:02.540]  you would go inside and you would arrest those criminals,
[2:48:02.540 --> 2:48:05.540]  instead of dragging a female on the ground,
[2:48:05.540 --> 2:48:07.540]  and sort of arresting someone that's on the street,
[2:48:07.540 --> 2:48:10.540]  you would show how much you care, you would be instant heroes,
[2:48:10.540 --> 2:48:11.540]  you would arrest those criminals.
[2:48:11.540 --> 2:48:12.540]  Let me stop you for a minute.
[2:48:12.540 --> 2:48:15.540]  If the globalists keep pushing, there's going to be Chalcesque moments,
[2:48:15.540 --> 2:48:19.540]  but if there is a government police military counter-coup,
[2:48:19.540 --> 2:48:22.540]  it could go very bad very quickly, and it's extremely dangerous.
[2:48:22.540 --> 2:48:26.540]  We do not want that, if it's an emergency, things keep going down the road,
[2:48:26.540 --> 2:48:28.540]  it's going to happen, we've already checkmated them,
[2:48:28.540 --> 2:48:31.540]  we've already got them in check that we've gotten all this out,
[2:48:31.540 --> 2:48:35.540]  they're going to end up losing, not the 30,000 drones, the checkpoints,
[2:48:35.540 --> 2:48:37.540]  they're hitting the panic button, like Hitler and their bunker,
[2:48:37.540 --> 2:48:39.540]  they're not invincible of studied history,
[2:48:39.540 --> 2:48:41.540]  but they could release a bio-weapon,
[2:48:41.540 --> 2:48:44.540]  if the cops actually did that, the globalists would hit and release a bio-weapon,
[2:48:44.540 --> 2:48:47.540]  that would kill almost everybody, we've got to be ready for that,
[2:48:47.540 --> 2:48:50.540]  and there may come a time when we just got to go ahead and try to arrest them,
[2:48:50.540 --> 2:48:53.540]  they're going to release the bio-weapon, everybody's got to dig in,
[2:48:53.540 --> 2:48:56.540]  while this stuff ravages people, I mean, it's going to be bad, okay?
[2:48:56.540 --> 2:48:59.540]  I mean, they've got the Death Star aimed at us, but we don't have a choice,
[2:48:59.540 --> 2:49:02.540]  so we've got to go ahead and push them to the point of that.
[2:49:02.540 --> 2:49:05.540]  I hope that enough people in the elite realize they better back off,
[2:49:05.540 --> 2:49:08.540]  this is not a good path they're going down on their little power trips,
[2:49:08.540 --> 2:49:10.540]  that's why I'm risking my life in their face.
[2:49:10.540 --> 2:49:13.540]  Look, most of the senior police were on our side,
[2:49:13.540 --> 2:49:17.540]  when people kept challenging them and going out on the road and stuff,
[2:49:17.540 --> 2:49:19.540]  if somebody got run over, they were going to get in big trouble,
[2:49:19.540 --> 2:49:22.540]  they were going to be fired, the point is it's by degrees,
[2:49:22.540 --> 2:49:27.540]  these police did by 30, 40, 50 degrees better than any other police I've ever seen,
[2:49:27.540 --> 2:49:35.540]  this is a process, and I used to just hate the police and hate the bullying stuff in the tyranny,
[2:49:35.540 --> 2:49:38.540]  because I didn't realize they didn't know as much as I knew,
[2:49:38.540 --> 2:49:42.540]  but I've noticed that if you actually try to educate police, except if it's New York City,
[2:49:42.540 --> 2:49:45.540]  because there it's just total gangs and uniforms,
[2:49:45.540 --> 2:49:49.540]  that the police actually, especially cops that have been a cop for a few years,
[2:49:49.540 --> 2:49:54.540]  young punks, they haven't learned yet, or they're into it for a power trip, but they won't last,
[2:49:54.540 --> 2:49:57.540]  most people that have actually been around and learned human nature,
[2:49:57.540 --> 2:50:02.540]  most police love their families too, and everybody instinctively now who Leo knows,
[2:50:02.540 --> 2:50:04.540]  this is down to the wire, okay?
[2:50:04.540 --> 2:50:09.540]  People now understand the new order is real, they're bad, they're really evil, they're eugenicist,
[2:50:09.540 --> 2:50:12.540]  and so it's a process, I appreciate your call, I remember you,
[2:50:12.540 --> 2:50:15.540]  you were pretty angry at the police quite a bit, I understand that,
[2:50:15.540 --> 2:50:19.540]  and you know, I got in their face, you know, the cops came out and we were shaking the windows
[2:50:19.540 --> 2:50:25.540]  with riot shotguns because the head of the hotel and the Marines were ordering them up there,
[2:50:25.540 --> 2:50:27.540]  and the cops had body language like they didn't like it,
[2:50:27.540 --> 2:50:31.540]  and I said, you're wrong to have double-lock shotgun, you don't scare us,
[2:50:31.540 --> 2:50:37.540]  and we said, you know, this is treason, and a commander came over and said, get the shotguns out of here.
[2:50:37.540 --> 2:50:41.540]  I said, listen, go ahead and shoot me now, I'm ready to die for this republic,
[2:50:41.540 --> 2:50:45.540]  go ahead and have a Kent State, if we do break these barriers down, which we're not planning to do,
[2:50:45.540 --> 2:50:48.540]  and we charge you, and they realize, I was almost like they were psyching,
[2:50:48.540 --> 2:50:52.540]  that I was halfway thinking about pushing that down and going in and going, go ahead and kill me.
[2:50:52.540 --> 2:50:56.540]  1776 starts now at Bunker Hill, you understand that?
[2:50:56.540 --> 2:51:22.540]  We're committed, we're not backing off, you started a fight with the wrong people.

[2:54:25.540 --> 2:54:39.540]  Yeah, more on the road music. Yeah, the future's uncertain, but we are destiny, we will take action.
[2:54:39.540 --> 2:54:44.540]  You are the resistance, resistance is victory, you are victory.
[2:54:44.540 --> 2:54:59.540]  Oh, there's the new TSA graphic. I'm back in studio, ladies and gentlemen, by the grace of our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, all the power and glory comes from you.
[2:54:59.540 --> 2:55:06.540]  Thank you for using me as an imperfect, twisted vessel against tyranny, and whatever your will is, that's what's gonna happen.
[2:55:06.540 --> 2:55:11.540]  I don't even pray and ask God for stuff, I just say, whatever you want, that's it.
[2:55:11.540 --> 2:55:17.540]  But I'm ready to go up against the New World Order. I think we're sending feeds back down the line to Aaron.
[2:55:17.540 --> 2:55:25.540]  Aaron's gonna come in here in the next hour with about 20, 30 minutes of overdrive to break down what we properly didn't cover on air driving here.
[2:55:25.540 --> 2:55:29.540]  But we can do document cam shots when he gets in here.
[2:55:29.540 --> 2:55:37.540]  We're gonna have Aaron in here with the documents in higher depth, streamed out to prisonplanet.tv viewers to get these on the record.
[2:55:37.540 --> 2:55:43.540]  So we can show you all the documents, not just what we were able to get to Paul Watson and get up there in his story.
[2:55:43.540 --> 2:55:48.540]  But we are here by the grace of God, and it's been amazing.
[2:55:48.540 --> 2:55:55.540]  And we are turning the corner against the TSA, against NAFTA, against GATT, against the globalist, against the North American Union.
[2:55:55.540 --> 2:56:00.540]  We are going to be able to beat these people if we recognize their operations.
[2:56:00.540 --> 2:56:08.540]  And if we reach out to people across the political spectrum and point out that the New World Order is the author of our world, where it is today.
[2:56:08.540 --> 2:56:14.540]  Everything that's industrially bad, everything that's big and bad, there's plenty of evil out there with individuals.
[2:56:14.540 --> 2:56:21.540]  But everything that's institutionally bad is directed globally by this group of miscreant scum.
[2:56:21.540 --> 2:56:29.540]  And that it's a corporate, global, New World Order system that's taken over the planet and they must be defeated.
[2:56:29.540 --> 2:56:31.540]  It is really that simple.
[2:56:31.540 --> 2:56:36.540]  So we were gone, I don't know, Saturday evening until Wednesday afternoon.
[2:56:36.540 --> 2:56:39.540]  How many days is that? That's like 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 days.
[2:56:39.540 --> 2:56:42.540]  And we are back and I can't wait to see my family.
[2:56:42.540 --> 2:56:45.540]  So amazing to be here. We couldn't have done any of this without you.
[2:56:45.540 --> 2:56:51.540]  I really just want to thank Matt Drudge and his crew at DrudgeReport.com for carrying our stories.
[2:56:51.540 --> 2:56:56.540]  And also carrying the other Bilderberg stories the last five, six years and really helping break it down world net daily.
[2:56:56.540 --> 2:57:01.540]  I want to thank Washington Times. I want to thank all the alternative media that was out there.
[2:57:01.540 --> 2:57:09.540]  I want to thank everybody, my crew, my family, you the supporters, the listeners, everybody that came out.
[2:57:09.540 --> 2:57:16.540]  It was great, but also torture to have all these families and children looking up to me and counting on me and shaking my hand.
[2:57:16.540 --> 2:57:22.540]  It was such a good spirit, but also it's crushing because you realize the responsibility you've got.
[2:57:22.540 --> 2:57:29.540]  But you know what I'm doing the best I can. I just think about those that aren't awake and don't know the threat that society is facing.
[2:57:29.540 --> 2:57:34.540]  Who don't understand how serious the cost is and what we're dealing with.
[2:57:34.540 --> 2:57:38.540]  People that are sleeping, the globalists live, we sleep.
[2:57:38.540 --> 2:57:42.540]  Humanity awaken. Now is the time.
[2:57:42.540 --> 2:57:46.540]  The entire crew here has just done, again, a fantastic job.
[2:57:46.540 --> 2:57:58.540]  Do sitting in the Watsons, Marcos, Morales, Darren McBreen, John Bown, Chris Alanis, just everybody, the entire office.
[2:57:58.540 --> 2:58:08.540]  Everyone here that helps bring you this information is risking their lives, their names, their honor, their treasure because they understand there is no future if this is not defeated.
[2:58:08.540 --> 2:58:11.540]  That's the big trick of the devil in the Neural Order.
[2:58:11.540 --> 2:58:14.540]  There is nothing to sell out to.
[2:58:14.540 --> 2:58:21.540]  All these people that are worldly and empty and living the delusion, it's like an imaginary playland they're in.
[2:58:21.540 --> 2:58:25.540]  It's not real, that's why you're not fulfilled. The real world is all around you.
[2:58:25.540 --> 2:58:28.540]  The fight for humanity is now. It's here.
[2:58:28.540 --> 2:58:34.540]  And we need strong men globally and women to rise up against the globalists in the endfall war.
[2:58:34.540 --> 2:58:45.540]  We have now gained the initiative. We will win the war!
[2:59:05.540 --> 2:59:10.540]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[2:59:10.540 --> 2:59:21.540]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[2:59:21.540 --> 2:59:31.540]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:59:31.540 --> 2:59:36.540]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[2:59:36.540 --> 2:59:44.540]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:59:44.540 --> 3:00:01.540]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[3:00:15.540 --> 3:00:24.540]  It is patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[3:00:24.540 --> 3:00:32.540]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[3:00:32.540 --> 3:00:38.540]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[3:00:38.540 --> 3:00:45.540]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[3:00:45.540 --> 3:01:04.540]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:01:16.540 --> 3:01:19.540]  You can't fight city hall.
[3:01:19.540 --> 3:01:27.540]  Definitely taxes. Don't talk about politics or religion. This is all the influence of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line.
[3:01:27.540 --> 3:01:32.540]  Lay down, GI. Lay down, GI. We saw it all through the 20th century.
[3:01:32.540 --> 3:01:38.540]  And now on the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
[3:01:38.540 --> 3:01:41.540]  We should not submit to dehumanization.
[3:01:41.540 --> 3:01:45.540]  I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
[3:01:45.540 --> 3:01:49.540]  I'm concerned with the structure. I'm concerned with the systems of control.
[3:01:49.540 --> 3:01:53.540]  Those that control my life and those that seek to control me even more.
[3:01:53.540 --> 3:01:57.540]  I want freedom. That's what I want. And that's what you should want.
[3:01:57.540 --> 3:02:04.540]  It's up to each and every one of us to turn this into just some of the freedom, the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities.
[3:02:04.540 --> 3:02:13.540]  Because that is the central mode of control. Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
[3:02:13.540 --> 3:02:17.540]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[3:02:17.540 --> 3:02:20.540]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[3:02:20.540 --> 3:02:22.540]  The 21st century is going to be a new century.
[3:02:22.540 --> 3:02:26.540]  Not the century of slavery. Not the century of lies.
[3:02:26.540 --> 3:02:37.540]  It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right.
[3:02:37.540 --> 3:02:41.540]  What a bunch of garbage, liberal, Democrat, and conservative Republicans.
[3:02:41.540 --> 3:02:44.540]  It's all there to control you two sides of the same coin.
[3:02:44.540 --> 3:02:47.540]  Two management teams getting for control.
[3:02:47.540 --> 3:02:50.540]  The CEO job of slavery and calculated.
[3:02:50.540 --> 3:02:54.540]  The truth is out there in front of you that they lay out this buffet of lies.
[3:02:54.540 --> 3:02:57.540]  I'm sick of it and I'm not going to take a bite out of it.
[3:02:57.540 --> 3:02:58.540]  Do you got me?
[3:02:58.540 --> 3:03:01.540]  This is not true.
[3:03:01.540 --> 3:03:03.540]  Humankind is too good.
[3:03:03.540 --> 3:03:05.540]  We're not a bunch of underachievers.
[3:03:05.540 --> 3:03:08.540]  We're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings.
[3:03:08.540 --> 3:03:10.540]  We're going to find the real things.
[3:03:10.540 --> 3:03:11.540]  The things that matter.
[3:03:11.540 --> 3:03:16.540]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[3:03:16.540 --> 3:03:18.540]  Well, that's it. That's all I got to say.
[3:03:18.540 --> 3:03:27.540]  Let's get to the core.
[3:03:27.540 --> 3:03:31.540]  In just a moment, we are going to bring you information on the leaked Bilderberg documents.
[3:03:31.540 --> 3:03:34.540]  I'm going to try to focus here, get all the papers together.
[3:03:34.540 --> 3:03:36.540]  We've been doing it from the road.
[3:03:36.540 --> 3:03:37.540]  It's very disjointed.
[3:03:37.540 --> 3:03:40.540]  I'm going to try to organize it, present it to you in a straightforward fashion.
[3:03:40.540 --> 3:03:44.540]  From the 1966 meetings, these documents haven't leaked before.
[3:03:44.540 --> 3:03:45.540]  They obviously don't want them out.
[3:03:45.540 --> 3:03:50.540]  They're a skeleton key to foreign policy and how the United States has been infiltrated,
[3:03:50.540 --> 3:03:55.540]  how they've been steering world government for more than 60 years now through the Bilderberg conference.
[3:03:55.540 --> 3:03:59.540]  Stay tuned.
[3:03:59.540 --> 3:04:01.540]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:04:01.540 --> 3:04:03.540]  You could see some of the documents.
[3:04:03.540 --> 3:04:06.540]  Now they were leaked from Senator Fred Harris.
[3:04:06.540 --> 3:04:09.540]  He was on the National Security Subcommittee in the Senate.
[3:04:09.540 --> 3:04:11.540]  He ended up being a two-term senator.
[3:04:11.540 --> 3:04:18.540]  In his second year, he was taken to Bilderberg, groomed, influenced by Rockefeller and other operatives,
[3:04:18.540 --> 3:04:24.540]  taught how special NATO needs to be, taught how they need to use economic devices,
[3:04:24.540 --> 3:04:28.540]  taught how nationalism is poison, basically how it's, quote, dangerous,
[3:04:28.540 --> 3:04:33.540]  how nationalism is the worst thing possible and how world government is the future.
[3:04:33.540 --> 3:04:37.540]  That's the kind of stuff we're going to be breaking down from inside the Bilderberg meeting.
[3:04:37.540 --> 3:04:39.540]  Special documents, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:04:39.540 --> 3:04:40.540]  This is breaking.
[3:04:40.540 --> 3:04:42.540]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:04:42.540 --> 3:04:43.540]  Stay tuned.
[3:04:43.540 --> 3:04:45.540]  Tune into this overdrive.
[3:04:45.540 --> 3:04:46.540]  Share it with everyone you know.
[3:04:46.540 --> 3:04:51.540]  We all have to do our homework so we can defeat Bilderberg and the related steering groups
[3:04:51.540 --> 3:04:55.540]  from out of the UK-based Cecil Rhodes Roundtable.
[3:05:01.540 --> 3:05:04.540]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water
[3:05:04.540 --> 3:05:06.540]  and laughing as you get sick and die?
[3:05:06.540 --> 3:05:09.540]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[3:05:09.540 --> 3:05:13.540]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there,
[3:05:13.540 --> 3:05:18.540]  bar none, is ProPure and it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[3:05:18.540 --> 3:05:21.540]  Its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth.
[3:05:21.540 --> 3:05:23.540]  There's no priming required.
[3:05:23.540 --> 3:05:25.540]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[3:05:25.540 --> 3:05:29.540]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[3:05:29.540 --> 3:05:30.540]  Easy to set up and use.
[3:05:30.540 --> 3:05:32.540]  Doesn't require electricity.
[3:05:32.540 --> 3:05:35.540]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[3:05:35.540 --> 3:05:38.540]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[3:05:38.540 --> 3:05:42.540]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[3:05:42.540 --> 3:05:45.540]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[3:05:45.540 --> 3:05:47.540]  It's what my family uses.

[3:06:01.540 --> 3:06:04.540]  Attention, mindless criminals, thugs and thieves.
[3:06:04.540 --> 3:06:06.540]  Go ahead, break a leg.
[3:06:06.540 --> 3:06:10.540]  American homeowners are fed up with your door kick-ins and forced entries.
[3:06:10.540 --> 3:06:15.540]  We now dare you to try your boot against any door reinforced with the door sentinel.
[3:06:15.540 --> 3:06:19.540]  The door sentinel pack includes a steel door jam plate with 3.5-inch screws,
[3:06:19.540 --> 3:06:22.540]  a lock shield and hinge shields.

[3:07:04.540 --> 3:07:06.540]  feeling better than you have in years,
[3:07:06.540 --> 3:07:08.540]  and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns,
[3:07:08.540 --> 3:07:11.540]  blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[3:07:11.540 --> 3:07:14.540]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives,
[3:07:14.540 --> 3:07:16.540]  and you could be one of them.
[3:07:16.540 --> 3:07:18.540]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[3:07:18.540 --> 3:07:20.540]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract,
[3:07:20.540 --> 3:07:23.540]  talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[3:07:23.540 --> 3:07:26.540]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract
[3:07:26.540 --> 3:07:29.540]  is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals,
[3:07:29.540 --> 3:07:33.540]  amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[3:07:33.540 --> 3:07:36.540]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure,
[3:07:36.540 --> 3:07:40.540]  balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[3:07:40.540 --> 3:07:43.540]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[3:07:43.540 --> 3:07:45.540]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[3:07:45.540 --> 3:07:48.540]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[3:07:48.540 --> 3:07:51.540]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[3:08:05.540 --> 3:08:07.540]  in the heart of The Resistance.
[3:08:07.540 --> 3:08:10.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:08:17.540 --> 3:08:19.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been given the microphone
[3:08:19.540 --> 3:08:22.540]  for a special overdrive presentation.
[3:08:22.540 --> 3:08:24.540]  As you know, I've been returning with Alex Jones
[3:08:24.540 --> 3:08:28.540]  from the Bilderberg meeting 2012 at Chantilly, Virginia.
[3:08:28.540 --> 3:08:32.540]  There, we were leaked much of what has been
[3:08:32.540 --> 3:08:36.540]  never-before-released documents from inside the Bilderberg group meetings.
[3:08:36.540 --> 3:08:39.540]  This goes back to the 1966 conference.
[3:08:39.540 --> 3:08:43.540]  It took place in Wiesbaden, Germany, right outside of Frankfurt.
[3:08:43.540 --> 3:08:47.540]  Today, it is still the base of the U.S. Consulate in Germany.
[3:08:47.540 --> 3:08:52.540]  It is also the base of occupied Germany back in the Soviet era.
[3:08:52.540 --> 3:08:55.540]  Now, these documents come out of the private library.
[3:08:55.540 --> 3:08:59.540]  They're marked not for distribution. They're marked confidential.
[3:08:59.540 --> 3:09:02.540]  They are marked protected by copyright law.
[3:09:02.540 --> 3:09:04.540]  But they're leaked anyway. We're going to break them to you.
[3:09:04.540 --> 3:09:07.540]  They come out of Senator Fred Harris's collection.
[3:09:07.540 --> 3:09:10.540]  He is a Democrat out of Oklahoma, still alive.
[3:09:10.540 --> 3:09:13.540]  I believe in his early 90s.
[3:09:13.540 --> 3:09:15.540]  He ended up being a two-term senator.
[3:09:15.540 --> 3:09:19.540]  But here he was in 1966, two years after being brought in,
[3:09:19.540 --> 3:09:22.540]  just on the heels of JFK's assassination.
[3:09:22.540 --> 3:09:28.540]  In 1964, he was groomed very early on to be a Bilderberg member.
[3:09:28.540 --> 3:09:33.540]  He, of course, was on the Senate Subcommittee on National Security
[3:09:33.540 --> 3:09:38.540]  and other branches. He was engaged in a study on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
[3:09:38.540 --> 3:09:42.540]  He was on the subcommittee in the Senate, which related to that.
[3:09:42.540 --> 3:09:44.540]  Now, that's why he was brought there,
[3:09:44.540 --> 3:09:48.540]  because that was the major topic of the 1966 meeting.
[3:09:48.540 --> 3:09:52.540]  Now, let's start here. We've got personal and strictly confidential,
[3:09:52.540 --> 3:09:55.540]  not for publication, either in whole or in part,
[3:09:55.540 --> 3:09:59.540]  from the collection of the Honorable Fred Harris Bilderberg Meetings
[3:09:59.540 --> 3:10:03.540]  v. Spotten Conference, March 25, 1966.
[3:10:03.540 --> 3:10:06.540]  Yes, they used to have these meetings in March,
[3:10:06.540 --> 3:10:10.540]  rather than late May, June, when they now currently have them.
[3:10:10.540 --> 3:10:14.540]  And so, right here, we have a signed copy of the invitation
[3:10:14.540 --> 3:10:18.540]  to Senator Fred Harris out of Oklahoma, signed by the Prince of the Netherlands.
[3:10:18.540 --> 3:10:21.540]  He, of course, is the founder of Bilderberg.
[3:10:21.540 --> 3:10:25.540]  He was inspired to create the group by this man right here,
[3:10:25.540 --> 3:10:28.540]  Dr. Joseph Redinger. He was a Jesuit.
[3:10:28.540 --> 3:10:32.540]  He was an advocate of the secret steering groups.
[3:10:32.540 --> 3:10:34.540]  Now, Bilderberg itself, you have to understand,
[3:10:34.540 --> 3:10:37.540]  came out of the Cecil Rhodes Roundtable Model.
[3:10:37.540 --> 3:10:40.540]  Cecil Rhodes was one of these great Robert Barons.
[3:10:40.540 --> 3:10:42.540]  He basically conquered much of Africa.
[3:10:42.540 --> 3:10:45.540]  He created a false flag through the newspapers he owned
[3:10:45.540 --> 3:10:49.540]  in what used to be four territories in South Africa.
[3:10:49.540 --> 3:10:52.540]  He created the Boer War. He stirred it up himself.
[3:10:52.540 --> 3:10:55.540]  Personally, using his top very influential friends,
[3:10:55.540 --> 3:10:59.540]  they created conflict that led to Boer War's number one and number two,
[3:10:59.540 --> 3:11:01.540]  and the state we now know as South Africa.
[3:11:01.540 --> 3:11:03.540]  He was hailed as a hero by the Queen,
[3:11:03.540 --> 3:11:05.540]  given all kinds of awards and designations.
[3:11:05.540 --> 3:11:09.540]  But more importantly, he worked with Victor Rothschild
[3:11:09.540 --> 3:11:12.540]  and other members, I'm sorry, yes, of the Rothschild family,
[3:11:12.540 --> 3:11:18.540]  to set up these secret steering groups, the Cecil Rhodes Roundtables.
[3:11:18.540 --> 3:11:21.540]  This became, in the United States, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[3:11:21.540 --> 3:11:25.540]  This became, in the U.K., the Royal Institute on International Affairs.
[3:11:25.540 --> 3:11:28.540]  The other Western countries had their counterparts as well.
[3:11:28.540 --> 3:11:31.540]  Now, today, we see Russia having a Russian Institute
[3:11:31.540 --> 3:11:33.540]  on International Affairs.
[3:11:33.540 --> 3:11:37.540]  China now has a branch, and they steer so much a policy
[3:11:37.540 --> 3:11:40.540]  meeting, partially in public, partially in secret,
[3:11:40.540 --> 3:11:45.540]  with the most influential people in the world to dictate policy.
[3:11:45.540 --> 3:11:47.540]  Yes, Bilderberg does dictate policy.
[3:11:47.540 --> 3:11:49.540]  These documents support that claim.
[3:11:49.540 --> 3:11:51.540]  So does all of our research and history.
[3:11:51.540 --> 3:11:53.540]  Anyway, I'll read from the letter.
[3:11:53.540 --> 3:11:56.540]  It is short. It comes out of The Hague,
[3:11:56.540 --> 3:11:58.540]  the address for Prince of the Netherlands,
[3:11:58.540 --> 3:12:00.540]  that is Prince Bernhard.
[3:12:00.540 --> 3:12:02.540]  Today, his daughter, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands,
[3:12:02.540 --> 3:12:04.540]  continues his legacy at Bilderberg.
[3:12:04.540 --> 3:12:07.540]  He sent it out in December 1965.
[3:12:07.540 --> 3:12:09.540]  I have the honor to invite you to the next Bilderberg meeting,
[3:12:09.540 --> 3:12:14.540]  which will be held at the Hotel Nasserhoff at Wiesbaden, Germany,
[3:12:14.540 --> 3:12:18.540]  25, 26, 27 March 1966.
[3:12:18.540 --> 3:12:21.540]  Then, on page two, he lists the agenda.
[3:12:21.540 --> 3:12:23.540]  It's quite short, but extremely important.
[3:12:23.540 --> 3:12:25.540]  Should NATO be reorganized?
[3:12:25.540 --> 3:12:26.540]  And if how?
[3:12:26.540 --> 3:12:29.540]  And point number two, the future of world economic relations,
[3:12:29.540 --> 3:12:32.540]  especially between industrial and developing countries.
[3:12:32.540 --> 3:12:34.540]  We'll get to that in just a moment.
[3:12:34.540 --> 3:12:36.540]  But first, I'll show you a few exhibits.
[3:12:36.540 --> 3:12:40.540]  Among these are the letters inviting Senator Harris,
[3:12:40.540 --> 3:12:43.540]  explaining the travel arrangements, and more.
[3:12:43.540 --> 3:12:47.540]  They come from the head of the U.S. branch of Bilderberg.
[3:12:47.540 --> 3:12:50.540]  It was Joseph E. Johnson in the 60s.
[3:12:50.540 --> 3:12:54.540]  Notice the letterhead, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
[3:12:54.540 --> 3:12:56.540]  a very important body.
[3:12:56.540 --> 3:12:58.540]  All these robber barons of the early 20th century
[3:12:58.540 --> 3:13:01.540]  were hated by the public for monopolizing industry
[3:13:01.540 --> 3:13:03.540]  and for looting over the people.
[3:13:03.540 --> 3:13:06.540]  Their Pinkerton forces, in the case of the Rockefellers,
[3:13:06.540 --> 3:13:09.540]  killed people for going on strike, et cetera.
[3:13:09.540 --> 3:13:12.540]  But they learned how to use the growing PR mechanisms
[3:13:12.540 --> 3:13:15.540]  that Edward Bernays, Ivy Lee, and other experts set up
[3:13:15.540 --> 3:13:18.540]  to fool people and to think they were helping you
[3:13:18.540 --> 3:13:21.540]  because they named their organizations things like Peace,
[3:13:21.540 --> 3:13:24.540]  International Peace, Carnegie Endowment.
[3:13:24.540 --> 3:13:28.540]  And so, a very important arm of Bilderberg today,
[3:13:28.540 --> 3:13:31.540]  Jessica T. Matthews heads the Carnegie Endowment,
[3:13:31.540 --> 3:13:33.540]  so that trend continues.
[3:13:33.540 --> 3:13:36.540]  Anyway, he's inviting the American members to the meeting,
[3:13:36.540 --> 3:13:39.540]  telling them what to expect, and really telling them also
[3:13:39.540 --> 3:13:42.540]  who they can trust and talk to within the Senate.
[3:13:42.540 --> 3:13:44.540]  You will see in different letters here.
[3:13:44.540 --> 3:13:47.540]  And that's part of the larger trend of how our Congress
[3:13:47.540 --> 3:13:50.540]  was infiltrated, how they took over the country from within.
[3:13:50.540 --> 3:13:56.540]  It's not the outside enemy, it's the inside nefarious scheming.
[3:13:56.540 --> 3:13:58.540]  Particularly, all these foundations,
[3:13:58.540 --> 3:14:00.540]  which were later investigated in the 50s,
[3:14:00.540 --> 3:14:02.540]  they tried to have those documents destroyed.
[3:14:02.540 --> 3:14:05.540]  People like Isherby did not let that happen.
[3:14:05.540 --> 3:14:08.540]  Thankfully, we have many of those documents now.
[3:14:08.540 --> 3:14:10.540]  Anyway, those are on file.
[3:14:10.540 --> 3:14:13.540]  Notice they come from Carnegie, First National City Bank,
[3:14:13.540 --> 3:14:15.540]  all basically robber baron entities.
[3:14:15.540 --> 3:14:18.540]  I believe First National was connected to Rockefeller.
[3:14:18.540 --> 3:14:20.540]  If not, certainly someone important.
[3:14:20.540 --> 3:14:22.540]  I will set those aside.
[3:14:22.540 --> 3:14:24.540]  And we have hundreds of documents.
[3:14:24.540 --> 3:14:27.540]  You'll have to forgive me for trying to organize these on the air
[3:14:27.540 --> 3:14:29.540]  because there's so many.
[3:14:29.540 --> 3:14:34.540]  But, of course, we have here a lot of the handwritten notes
[3:14:34.540 --> 3:14:39.540]  from Senator Fred Harris inside the 1966 Bilderberg conference.
[3:14:39.540 --> 3:14:42.540]  He's got headers here for each of the countries as they spoke
[3:14:42.540 --> 3:14:44.540]  and the different speakers.
[3:14:44.540 --> 3:14:47.540]  He's got names, of course, for the American delegates,
[3:14:47.540 --> 3:14:49.540]  in the case of many of the European delegates
[3:14:49.540 --> 3:14:51.540]  that he probably didn't know personally.
[3:14:51.540 --> 3:14:53.540]  He has either their country or how they were secretary
[3:14:53.540 --> 3:14:56.540]  or what have you for different entities.
[3:14:56.540 --> 3:14:59.540]  And handwriting is not always the easiest to read,
[3:14:59.540 --> 3:15:01.540]  but it's very important.
[3:15:01.540 --> 3:15:03.540]  You see recurrent themes about NATO,
[3:15:03.540 --> 3:15:06.540]  which, again, Fred Harris was studying the military integration,
[3:15:06.540 --> 3:15:08.540]  how it's necessary.
[3:15:08.540 --> 3:15:12.540]  That's from a UK delegate, the organizational aspects,
[3:15:12.540 --> 3:15:16.540]  and on and on about how nationalism is what's bad,
[3:15:16.540 --> 3:15:18.540]  how nationalism is contagious,
[3:15:18.540 --> 3:15:22.540]  how nationalism is part of this pre-1914 mentality.
[3:15:22.540 --> 3:15:24.540]  Right here, we have John J. McCloy.
[3:15:24.540 --> 3:15:26.540]  He happens to be a very important figure.
[3:15:26.540 --> 3:15:28.540]  He was a member of Skolin Bones,
[3:15:28.540 --> 3:15:31.540]  and he had a number of very high-out posts.
[3:15:31.540 --> 3:15:34.540]  He was inside, of course, our governments.
[3:15:34.540 --> 3:15:37.540]  He was considered one of the wise men under JFK and Johnson
[3:15:37.540 --> 3:15:39.540]  and other presidents.
[3:15:39.540 --> 3:15:41.540]  He had positions including
[3:15:41.540 --> 3:15:44.540]  Assistant Secretary of War during World War II,
[3:15:44.540 --> 3:15:47.540]  but he was simultaneously a lawyer for IG Farben.
[3:15:47.540 --> 3:15:50.540]  He was responsible for policy for things like,
[3:15:50.540 --> 3:15:53.540]  should we bomb the trains that go to Auschwitz,
[3:15:53.540 --> 3:15:55.540]  which we now know were concentration camps?
[3:15:55.540 --> 3:15:57.540]  Well, ultimately, that didn't happen,
[3:15:57.540 --> 3:15:59.540]  and you have to ask yourself why.
[3:15:59.540 --> 3:16:02.540]  Was it because he was connected on the inside to IG Farben,
[3:16:02.540 --> 3:16:05.540]  where, I might add, Prince Bernhard, the founder of Bilderberg,
[3:16:05.540 --> 3:16:08.540]  was the head of IG Farben on the board?
[3:16:08.540 --> 3:16:10.540]  Well, it really speaks for itself
[3:16:10.540 --> 3:16:13.540]  because all these Skolin Bones members were caught
[3:16:13.540 --> 3:16:15.540]  funding the Nazi mechanism,
[3:16:15.540 --> 3:16:17.540]  not because they believed Hitler would conquer Europe,
[3:16:17.540 --> 3:16:20.540]  but because they wanted to integrate Europe by creating a boogeyman.
[3:16:20.540 --> 3:16:23.540]  At least that's what I believe, after having studied it,
[3:16:23.540 --> 3:16:26.540]  when they got caught, they didn't really get caught
[3:16:26.540 --> 3:16:28.540]  because they had a mechanism in the Netherlands,
[3:16:28.540 --> 3:16:30.540]  where Prince Bernhard is from,
[3:16:30.540 --> 3:16:34.540]  in which they could quickly transfer assets from the Nazi mechanism
[3:16:34.540 --> 3:16:37.540]  back to the Anglosphere, the Atlantic Sphere,
[3:16:37.540 --> 3:16:40.540]  based in the UK and the United States,
[3:16:40.540 --> 3:16:42.540]  and they indeed did that.
[3:16:42.540 --> 3:16:44.540]  Now, John J. McCloy was head of the World Bank.
[3:16:44.540 --> 3:16:46.540]  He was chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank,
[3:16:46.540 --> 3:16:48.540]  which is the Rockefeller organ.
[3:16:48.540 --> 3:16:50.540]  He was chairman of the Ford Foundation,
[3:16:50.540 --> 3:16:52.540]  chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations,
[3:16:52.540 --> 3:16:54.540]  and a member of the Warren Commission,
[3:16:54.540 --> 3:16:56.540]  so you could see some of his tentacles there.
[3:16:56.540 --> 3:16:59.540]  Anyway, in these handwritten notes from Senator Fred Harris,
[3:16:59.540 --> 3:17:03.540]  you see things about how de Gaulle and his nationalism
[3:17:03.540 --> 3:17:05.540]  could spread, how it's troubling,
[3:17:05.540 --> 3:17:08.540]  how nationalism stimulates nationalism,
[3:17:08.540 --> 3:17:11.540]  how this pre-1914 mentality is dangerous.
[3:17:11.540 --> 3:17:14.540]  He says, when you stress independence,
[3:17:14.540 --> 3:17:16.540]  flexibility, and nationalism,
[3:17:16.540 --> 3:17:20.540]  you're really going back to the pre-1914 mishmash.
[3:17:20.540 --> 3:17:23.540]  That again is a quote from Senator Fred Harris' handwritten notes
[3:17:23.540 --> 3:17:26.540]  while listening to the speeches at Bilderberg,
[3:17:26.540 --> 3:17:29.540]  in this case from John J. McCloy,
[3:17:29.540 --> 3:17:31.540]  in other cases from the other senators,
[3:17:31.540 --> 3:17:33.540]  from the other delegates, from the other people,
[3:17:33.540 --> 3:17:35.540]  from this world government system they've been pursuing now
[3:17:35.540 --> 3:17:38.540]  for more than a century, how de Gaulle,
[3:17:38.540 --> 3:17:40.540]  and it's just repeated talk about de Gaulle,
[3:17:40.540 --> 3:17:43.540]  how the surging nationalism in France
[3:17:43.540 --> 3:17:46.540]  had spread to Germany, Western Germany, of course, at the time,
[3:17:46.540 --> 3:17:51.540]  and on and on, and how we urgently need NATO to be built up.
[3:17:51.540 --> 3:17:53.540]  That was the key, again, as I pointed out,
[3:17:53.540 --> 3:17:56.540]  on the agenda in the 1966 meeting.
[3:17:56.540 --> 3:17:59.540]  Here's some of the handwritten notes from the Austrian delegate,
[3:17:59.540 --> 3:18:04.540]  and they're all on the list right over here, I might add.
[3:18:04.540 --> 3:18:08.540]  One second, want to find that list.
[3:18:08.540 --> 3:18:10.540]  At any rate, it goes on.
[3:18:10.540 --> 3:18:13.540]  Now, one of the most important delegates at this meeting
[3:18:13.540 --> 3:18:18.540]  was the United Auto Workers President.
[3:18:18.540 --> 3:18:26.540]  His name was Reuter, and his notes are coming up.
[3:18:26.540 --> 3:18:28.540]  And the point is that all the most important people
[3:18:28.540 --> 3:18:30.540]  inside U.S. foreign policy,
[3:18:30.540 --> 3:18:33.540]  which had become very hegemonic after World War II,
[3:18:33.540 --> 3:18:35.540]  were part of either secret societies
[3:18:35.540 --> 3:18:39.540]  or connected to these world government pursuing foundations
[3:18:39.540 --> 3:18:41.540]  that connect to the robber barons.
[3:18:41.540 --> 3:18:44.540]  And that is really how we were taken over from within.
[3:18:44.540 --> 3:18:46.540]  I think the last two presidents in this country
[3:18:46.540 --> 3:18:49.540]  were clearly Eisenhower and JFK.
[3:18:49.540 --> 3:18:50.540]  They both had their own baggage.
[3:18:50.540 --> 3:18:53.540]  They were not perfect people by any means.
[3:18:53.540 --> 3:18:56.540]  But I think by the end, they had both begun to figure out
[3:18:56.540 --> 3:18:58.540]  that we were not really working for America,
[3:18:58.540 --> 3:19:02.540]  but a foreign offshore interest, as Alex often terms it.
[3:19:02.540 --> 3:19:04.540]  Now, right here, we have Walter P. Reuter.
[3:19:04.540 --> 3:19:06.540]  He is the head of United Auto Workers.
[3:19:06.540 --> 3:19:09.540]  And again, here are Senator Fred Harris's notes
[3:19:09.540 --> 3:19:10.540]  from within that meeting.
[3:19:10.540 --> 3:19:12.540]  He says, quote, NATO is in trouble
[3:19:12.540 --> 3:19:15.540]  because common fears are reduced.
[3:19:15.540 --> 3:19:18.540]  And he says, nationalism is dangerous.
[3:19:18.540 --> 3:19:20.540]  Nationalism is dangerous.
[3:19:20.540 --> 3:19:22.540]  Is is underlying.
[3:19:22.540 --> 3:19:24.540]  Nationalism is the problem.
[3:19:24.540 --> 3:19:26.540]  We must pursue peace, world government,
[3:19:26.540 --> 3:19:28.540]  building community, regionalism,
[3:19:28.540 --> 3:19:30.540]  some of the others say in these notes.
[3:19:30.540 --> 3:19:31.540]  And it goes on and on.
[3:19:31.540 --> 3:19:32.540]  Of course, it's going to take some time
[3:19:32.540 --> 3:19:34.540]  to break down the handwritten notes.
[3:19:34.540 --> 3:19:36.540]  We're going to break, but we're going to be back
[3:19:36.540 --> 3:19:39.540]  still in overdrive with the special presentation
[3:19:39.540 --> 3:19:41.540]  of the leaked Bilderberg documents.
[3:19:41.540 --> 3:19:43.540]  They are from 1966.
[3:19:43.540 --> 3:19:45.540]  They come directly out of the meeting.
[3:19:45.540 --> 3:19:47.540]  Again, they include handwritten notes,
[3:19:47.540 --> 3:19:49.540]  memorandums, invitations, travel plans.
[3:19:49.540 --> 3:19:51.540]  And on the other side of this break,
[3:19:51.540 --> 3:19:54.540]  we're going to get into the policy papers
[3:19:54.540 --> 3:19:56.540]  that they presented at Bilderberg,
[3:19:56.540 --> 3:19:58.540]  who those speakers were, what they represent,
[3:19:58.540 --> 3:20:01.540]  and how it ties in to the policy that was openly.
[3:20:01.540 --> 3:20:04.540]  The ungevity products worked for many others.
[3:20:04.540 --> 3:20:06.540]  And so I bought a bunch of them, started using them,
[3:20:06.540 --> 3:20:07.540]  had a little bit of results,
[3:20:07.540 --> 3:20:10.540]  but I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[3:20:10.540 --> 3:20:12.540]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did
[3:20:12.540 --> 3:20:14.540]  and lost more than 60 pounds.
[3:20:14.540 --> 3:20:16.540]  When I saw those results, I said,
[3:20:16.540 --> 3:20:18.540]  I better follow my own advice.
[3:20:18.540 --> 3:20:20.540]  I started taking the ungevity products,
[3:20:20.540 --> 3:20:21.540]  and it's been incredible.
[3:20:21.540 --> 3:20:24.540]  37 pounds in two months.
[3:20:24.540 --> 3:20:25.540]  Our bodies are amazing,
[3:20:25.540 --> 3:20:27.540]  and God gave us an incredible gift.
[3:20:27.540 --> 3:20:30.540]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs,
[3:20:30.540 --> 3:20:32.540]  all of the vitamins, all of the minerals,
[3:20:32.540 --> 3:20:35.540]  and the other key essential trace elements
[3:20:35.540 --> 3:20:36.540]  were not going to be healthy.
[3:20:36.540 --> 3:20:37.540]  Folks, this hidden hype,
[3:20:37.540 --> 3:20:39.540]  I only bring to my listeners products

[3:23:00.540 --> 3:23:01.540]  Many scientific studies
[3:23:01.540 --> 3:23:03.540]  have linked inflammation in the human body
[3:23:03.540 --> 3:23:05.540]  to several common health challenges
[3:23:05.540 --> 3:23:07.540]  suffered by Americans every day.
[3:23:07.540 --> 3:23:09.540]  This idea about essential fatty acids
[3:23:09.540 --> 3:23:10.540]  getting turned into inflammatory
[3:23:10.540 --> 3:23:12.540]  or non-inflammatory chemicals.
[3:23:12.540 --> 3:23:13.540]  If you're dealing with an inflammatory issue
[3:23:13.540 --> 3:23:15.540]  like arthritis and many diseases
[3:23:15.540 --> 3:23:17.540]  and many immune conditions
[3:23:17.540 --> 3:23:19.540]  have inflammatory components.
[3:23:19.540 --> 3:23:21.540]  If you have any inflammatory issues,
[3:23:21.540 --> 3:23:23.540]  essential fatty acids are maybe
[3:23:23.540 --> 3:23:25.540]  the most important nutritional supplements you could use.
[3:23:25.540 --> 3:23:27.540]  If you have fat absorption problems,
[3:23:27.540 --> 3:23:28.540]  you're going to want to take your EFAs
[3:23:28.540 --> 3:23:30.540]  with digestive enzymes,
[3:23:30.540 --> 3:23:31.540]  with fatty meals,
[3:23:31.540 --> 3:23:33.540]  can also help improve your ability to process
[3:23:33.540 --> 3:23:35.540]  and absorb these super, super,
[3:23:35.540 --> 3:23:37.540]  mega important nutritional compounds,
[3:23:37.540 --> 3:23:38.540]  essential fatty acids.

[3:23:58.540 --> 3:24:27.540]  Ordered today.
[3:24:27.540 --> 3:24:31.540]  I have sworn upon the altar of God,
[3:24:31.540 --> 3:24:35.540]  eternal hostility against every form of tyranny
[3:24:35.540 --> 3:24:37.540]  over the mind of man.
[3:24:37.540 --> 3:24:39.540]  Thomas Jefferson.
[3:24:39.540 --> 3:24:41.540]  We are back at infowars.com.
[3:24:41.540 --> 3:24:44.540]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[3:24:44.540 --> 3:24:47.540]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:24:47.540 --> 3:24:49.540]  We are back at infowars.com
[3:24:49.540 --> 3:24:51.540]  and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:24:51.540 --> 3:24:52.540]  I'm Aaron Dykes.
[3:24:52.540 --> 3:24:53.540]  I've been traveling with Alex
[3:24:53.540 --> 3:24:55.540]  to the Bilderberg 2012 Summit.
[3:24:55.540 --> 3:24:57.540]  It's not just dogs and cats living together.
[3:24:57.540 --> 3:25:00.540]  It's socialists and so-called capitalists
[3:25:00.540 --> 3:25:03.540]  working behind the scenes to steer the world agenda.
[3:25:03.540 --> 3:25:06.540]  We're deep inside the leaked Bilderberg documents
[3:25:06.540 --> 3:25:08.540]  out of the 1966 conference
[3:25:08.540 --> 3:25:11.540]  from the Bilderberg meetings in Wiesbaden, Germany.
[3:25:11.540 --> 3:25:13.540]  And they are bombshell.
[3:25:13.540 --> 3:25:14.540]  We have, of course, the list.
[3:25:14.540 --> 3:25:16.540]  It's not only the founder, Prince Bernhard
[3:25:16.540 --> 3:25:18.540]  of the Netherlands, who later had to step down
[3:25:18.540 --> 3:25:20.540]  because of his bribery scandals.
[3:25:20.540 --> 3:25:22.540]  It's people from the Carnegie Endowment
[3:25:22.540 --> 3:25:23.540]  for International Peace.
[3:25:23.540 --> 3:25:26.540]  It's David Rockefeller of the Chase Manhattan Bank
[3:25:26.540 --> 3:25:28.540]  and the World Empire.
[3:25:28.540 --> 3:25:31.540]  It's half a dozen or more of his emissaries
[3:25:31.540 --> 3:25:33.540]  and appointees at Standard Oil,
[3:25:33.540 --> 3:25:36.540]  at the other entities they control.
[3:25:36.540 --> 3:25:39.540]  It's important Europeans like Giovanni Agnelli
[3:25:39.540 --> 3:25:41.540]  of the Fiat Company,
[3:25:41.540 --> 3:25:43.540]  who helped build the European Union
[3:25:43.540 --> 3:25:45.540]  through the steel and coal community
[3:25:45.540 --> 3:25:48.540]  that they built and intended to grow.
[3:25:48.540 --> 3:25:51.540]  It's people like Marcus Wallenberg out of Sweden.
[3:25:51.540 --> 3:25:54.540]  Today, his son Jacob Wallenberg still attends
[3:25:54.540 --> 3:25:56.540]  and still steers their agenda.
[3:25:56.540 --> 3:25:59.540]  On the U.S. side, we have a lot of important people,
[3:25:59.540 --> 3:26:01.540]  particularly out of the NATO sphere.
[3:26:01.540 --> 3:26:03.540]  Most of them are skull and bones
[3:26:03.540 --> 3:26:05.540]  or connected directly to it.
[3:26:05.540 --> 3:26:08.540]  Among them are the writers of that year's policy paper,
[3:26:08.540 --> 3:26:10.540]  Robert R. Bowie.
[3:26:10.540 --> 3:26:13.540]  Should NATO be reorganized, and if so, how?
[3:26:13.540 --> 3:26:15.540]  March 1966.
[3:26:15.540 --> 3:26:17.540]  And in this policy paper,
[3:26:17.540 --> 3:26:20.540]  Robert R. Bowie, who is a member of the CFR,
[3:26:20.540 --> 3:26:22.540]  who attended these Bilderberg meetings,
[3:26:22.540 --> 3:26:25.540]  and is a John J. McCoy Acolyte,
[3:26:25.540 --> 3:26:27.540]  who we talked about on the other segment,
[3:26:27.540 --> 3:26:29.540]  wrote about how NATO should be built up,
[3:26:29.540 --> 3:26:31.540]  how the Atlantic Alliance should be fostered.
[3:26:31.540 --> 3:26:33.540]  Atlantic Alliance, of course,
[3:26:33.540 --> 3:26:36.540]  between the United States and the European sphere,
[3:26:36.540 --> 3:26:39.540]  how that should not only be a military counter threat
[3:26:39.540 --> 3:26:42.540]  to the Soviets, but that even if there weren't a Soviet threat,
[3:26:42.540 --> 3:26:45.540]  they should still use it to integrate Europe
[3:26:45.540 --> 3:26:47.540]  as they began under the Marshall Plan,
[3:26:47.540 --> 3:26:50.540]  the Schumann Plan, and much more.
[3:26:50.540 --> 3:26:54.540]  That's a 20-page policy paper, and it's just bombshell.
[3:26:54.540 --> 3:26:56.540]  Meanwhile, at the same meeting,
[3:26:56.540 --> 3:26:58.540]  they met on the development of finance
[3:26:58.540 --> 3:27:00.540]  in the international and developed world
[3:27:00.540 --> 3:27:03.540]  and discussed how it would continue to be steered.
[3:27:03.540 --> 3:27:07.540]  They used these agreements to bind the developing countries
[3:27:07.540 --> 3:27:10.540]  so they could suck out their resources for corporate gain
[3:27:10.540 --> 3:27:13.540]  and control the populations quite literally
[3:27:13.540 --> 3:27:16.540]  through food supply, through conditionalities
[3:27:16.540 --> 3:27:19.540]  that dictate the way the countries will develop.
[3:27:19.540 --> 3:27:21.540]  They do not have independence.
[3:27:21.540 --> 3:27:24.540]  They think national sovereignty is pure poison
[3:27:24.540 --> 3:27:26.540]  and that only world government is the future.
[3:27:26.540 --> 3:27:29.540]  Here's the other policy paper from the 1966 meeting.
[3:27:29.540 --> 3:27:31.540]  The Future of World Economic Relations,
[3:27:31.540 --> 3:27:34.540]  especially between industrial and developing countries
[3:27:34.540 --> 3:27:36.540]  by J. Ten Bergen.
[3:27:36.540 --> 3:27:39.540]  That is a professor who undoubtedly works directly
[3:27:39.540 --> 3:27:43.540]  for Prince Bernhard in 1966 out of Rotterdam,
[3:27:43.540 --> 3:27:47.540]  summarizing how entities including USAID,
[3:27:47.540 --> 3:27:49.540]  the Agency for International Development,
[3:27:49.540 --> 3:27:52.540]  the World Bank, the United Nations, and many others
[3:27:52.540 --> 3:27:57.540]  will control and dictate exports from the industrialized world
[3:27:57.540 --> 3:28:01.540]  and will figure out how to balance the growing world population
[3:28:01.540 --> 3:28:03.540]  by using food as a weapon.
[3:28:03.540 --> 3:28:06.540]  That later came out some six, seven, eight years later
[3:28:06.540 --> 3:28:10.540]  under Henry Kissinger and National State Memorandum No. 200,
[3:28:10.540 --> 3:28:13.540]  where he literally said food as a weapon.
[3:28:13.540 --> 3:28:15.540]  Just disgusting stuff.
[3:28:15.540 --> 3:28:17.540]  And we've got other key members.
[3:28:17.540 --> 3:28:20.540]  The top delegates on the U.S. side were, of course,
[3:28:20.540 --> 3:28:22.540]  Joseph E. Johnson of the Carnegie Endowment
[3:28:22.540 --> 3:28:24.540]  for International Peace.
[3:28:24.540 --> 3:28:26.540]  He's in these documents inviting people like
[3:28:26.540 --> 3:28:28.540]  Senator Fred Harris, whose library these documents
[3:28:28.540 --> 3:28:30.540]  were leaked out of.
[3:28:30.540 --> 3:28:32.540]  There's also George W. Ball.
[3:28:32.540 --> 3:28:34.540]  He was under Secretary of State under JFK,
[3:28:34.540 --> 3:28:38.540]  continued to be a key advisor under Johnson after JFK's death.
[3:28:38.540 --> 3:28:41.540]  And he is connected to and advising them.
[3:28:41.540 --> 3:28:43.540]  You can see in this document how, quote,
[3:28:43.540 --> 3:28:46.540]  in the past it's been our custom to have under Secretary of State
[3:28:46.540 --> 3:28:49.540]  George W. Ball advising the American delegation.
[3:28:49.540 --> 3:28:51.540]  It goes on.
[3:28:51.540 --> 3:28:53.540]  Ball is one of the architects of the Vietnam War.
[3:28:53.540 --> 3:28:57.540]  He told JFK in five years we'll have 300,000 troops in Vietnam.
[3:28:57.540 --> 3:29:00.540]  JFK told him he was crazy and it would never happen.
[3:29:00.540 --> 3:29:02.540]  Basically over my dead body.
[3:29:02.540 --> 3:29:05.540]  And I think you can connect the dots from there.
[3:29:05.540 --> 3:29:07.540]  There's other important stuff,
[3:29:07.540 --> 3:29:10.540]  but you see here how the NATO document
[3:29:10.540 --> 3:29:13.540]  written by the Skull and Bones related acolytes,
[3:29:13.540 --> 3:29:15.540]  should NATO be reorganized,
[3:29:15.540 --> 3:29:18.540]  was echoed in the Atlantic Community Quarterly,
[3:29:18.540 --> 3:29:21.540]  the NATO Journal, how it was echoed in Senate hearings,
[3:29:21.540 --> 3:29:23.540]  the Atlantic Alliance Treaty and Related,
[3:29:23.540 --> 3:29:27.540]  and how their fellow wise men buddies like
[3:29:27.540 --> 3:29:31.540]  Dean Atchison gave hearings and testimonies
[3:29:31.540 --> 3:29:34.540]  based directly on what was written about, discussed,
[3:29:34.540 --> 3:29:36.540]  and decided inside the Bilderberg meetings.
[3:29:36.540 --> 3:29:38.540]  That's all we're going to bring you for today.
[3:29:38.540 --> 3:29:40.540]  We'll give you even more detail
[3:29:40.540 --> 3:29:43.540]  from these bombshell leaking documents coming up.
[3:29:43.540 --> 3:29:46.540]  We'll go back now to Alex's live coverage from the road.
[3:29:46.540 --> 3:29:49.540]  Bilderberg 2012, our return trip.
[3:29:49.540 --> 3:29:51.540]  Debriefing you on March.
[3:29:51.540 --> 3:29:53.540]  The Empires on the Run.
[3:29:53.540 --> 3:30:07.540]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
