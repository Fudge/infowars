[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:23.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.000 --> 00:33.000]  Well, this is going to be an incredibly jam-packed Friday transmission of the highest import, obviously.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  It is already the second day of March, 2012.
[00:38.000 --> 00:50.000]  In the last month, over and over again, I said that I saw clear evidence of a purge coming against what is seen as anti-establishment.
[00:50.000 --> 00:58.000]  There are power struggles within the left and right Democratic Republican Party kind of servant class of the big offshore megabanks.
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  And a lot of the different power structure media people hate each other, for whatever reason.
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  So they're struggling like two different mafias over the switches.
[01:09.000 --> 01:19.000]  And there are some people who actually believe in their ideology and who do not like corruption, like Andrew Breitbart.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  And I had said, get ready.
[01:22.000 --> 01:35.000]  I'm seeing different telltale signs, a whole spectrum of them, and calls for stage terror attacks to be blamed on opposition to Obama.
[01:35.000 --> 01:43.000]  That's public memos that I'm saying that we're entering a prime zone for political purging.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  Then you saw Judge Napolitano axed.
[01:48.000 --> 01:55.000]  Then you saw Pat Buchanan, same week, axed, MSNBC.
[01:55.000 --> 02:09.000]  There is all sorts of scuttlebutt I'm getting from behind the scenes from big folks in talk radio that they're getting major pressure to back off Obama
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  and to back off criticisms of government-run healthcare.
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  Because Obama is so unpopular. I mean, he's in freefall, and he's the establishment's guy.
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  Who's who they put the money on?
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.000]  And Obama has been smart. He's pumped hundreds of billions of dollars, well trillions to the big foreign banks,
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  but hundreds and hundreds of billions to every big city mafia there is.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  Acorn was just one small part of that.
[02:35.000 --> 02:41.000]  Were they saying eight to ten billion a year?
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  And so Obama wouldn't even need to call the hit on Breitbart.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  He wouldn't even need to have his mafia handlers, the Chicago mob that runs him publicly on record.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  I mean, look at all those associates.
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  They wouldn't even need to call for the hit.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  He wouldn't even need to say, boy, it'd be great if Breitbart went away.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  It just happens because Breitbart made so many enemies because he knew how to go out with undercover reporters
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  and infiltrate these groups and just absolutely destroy big-setting machines.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  And you can say he did it because he was moral.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  You can say he did it because he was competitive and wanted to be number one.
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  You cannot deny that big mainline Republicans do not go after the big machines.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  Because back in the 80s and things, Republicans and Democrats would blow each other's aircraft up.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  I mean, there have been so many cases of senators, house members being killed.
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  There's a reason politics got, you know, the rhetoric's heated, but when it comes to going after real corruption, they can.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  It's like fast and furious.
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  I told you six months before it happened, I said, if they keep calling the attorney general in,
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  he's just going to say, hey, Bush was doing the same thing, shipping guns into Mexico, which was going on under other programs.
[03:57.000 --> 04:04.000]  We reported on it almost seven years ago with inside sources like Celica Steel, former DEA agent.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  The difference is Bush didn't blame the Second Amendment with it.
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.000]  Bush was shipping them down there to try to control different cartels because the big banks are laundering the money.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  Obama went one step further because they are radical.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  They want a hot takeover of this country.
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.000]  They went from using Homeland Security, quote, on the Muslims to Godowners, conservatives, libertarians.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  So I'm not saying Republicans good, Democrats good, Democrats bad, Republicans bad.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  I'm saying there's fights in the power structure.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  And now the consensus is emerging.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  We'll cover it after the break that, of course, Andrew Breitbart was killed.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  Of course he was.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  Of course he was.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Now the smoking gun has come out.
[04:50.000 --> 04:57.000]  Not only did he say he was going to release this video that would destroy Obama and other material dealing with communist connections,
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.000]  but he did something more. He was going to release it March 1st.
[05:01.000 --> 05:04.000]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[05:07.000 --> 05:12.000]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[05:12.000 --> 05:19.000]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  Now there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com,
[05:22.000 --> 05:30.000]  but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  Now that's results.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfowarsTeam.com
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  and to order just three of their products.
[05:49.000 --> 05:55.000]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite almost immediately.
[05:55.000 --> 06:21.000]  Start your journey to health and wellness today, InfowarsTeam.com.
[06:25.000 --> 06:29.000]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[06:29.000 --> 06:34.000]  And put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  Blue Diamond Gusset's got it, other stone.
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  We turned jeans inside out, Diamond Gusset Jeans,
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar Protection,
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  opportunity and recognized risk.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  Saving means to make money.
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  and twice as good as what you're using now.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  that contain no useless dyes,
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  that give you rashes, itching sores,
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  If you want something better,
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  if you want something you've never had before,
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  you have to do something you've never done before.
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  Getting a free catalog is easy
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  by calling 800-340-7091
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  or see Calben on the web at 5starsoup.com.

[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  by calling 800-340-7091
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  or see Calben on the web at 5starsoup.com.
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.000]  There are massive geopolitical developments taking place.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  Huge developments in the economy with Bernanke saying
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  we're headed towards the edge of a cliff.
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  Yeah, and they've been pushing us the entire time
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  so they can destroy society
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  and buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  There are admissions of plans for civil unrest
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  and the arrest of political dissidents.
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  All of this is coming out.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  Everything is being revealed
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  because we're right up to the uncloking point
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  of the takeover by a global corporate fascist system
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  through the giant big government systems
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  that these corporations have lobbied for
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  and that they've got their personnel in place for.
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  Of course, Sheriff Arpaio is bringing out
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  what we exposed a year ago
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  and that is that the long-form birth certificate
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  is a forgery.
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  It is a fake and a bad fake.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  A ridiculous fake.
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  And of course, we have videos out there
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  and reports with millions of views and reads.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  Breaking that down, if that listener is saying,
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  cover it, cover it, cover it, we've been covering.
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.000]  And the fact that Arpaio is covering it,
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  I mean, what does that signify?
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  But the birth certificate issue
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  and the fact that his forensic team
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  says that it's a clear fraud,
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  in fact, a shoddy fraud,
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  as I said when all of this first happened.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  That day, we did an analysis
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  that turned out to be absolutely on target.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  We were the first to notice it was in multiple layers,
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  not just in the program,
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  but had been created in layers.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  That shoddily done.
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  And so, yes, it's back
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  and people aren't believing it.
[09:56.000 --> 09:57.000]  People aren't believing anything
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  that comes out of this liar-in-chief.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  Everything Obama does is a lie.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  He is a mafia frontman
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.000]  for the Chicago mob.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  There is no doubting that.
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  Now, I'm going to get into Andrew Breitbart,
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  but there is a connection between the birth certificate
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  and Andrew Breitbart's untimely death
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  and big breaking news on that front.
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  And I'm going to go over it right now.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  You know that the White House
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  one week before the release
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.000]  of Where's the Birth Certificate
[10:27.000 --> 10:28.000]  by Dr. Jerome Corsi,
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  who's joining us in the last 30 minutes
[10:30.000 --> 10:31.000]  of the broadcast today,
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  the guy that swift-boated John Kerry,
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  so the system's scared of him.
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  Multiple number one New York Times bestseller.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  And the information in that book was accurate.
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  That's why they were so scared of it.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  When Corsi was about to release that book
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  through World End Daily,
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  one week before the White House,
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  after two-plus years of not releasing it,
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  released the birth certificate.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  And there's sworn affidavits on record
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  from people that worked in that Bureau of Vital Statistics
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  in Hawaii that said they'd looked.
[11:08.000 --> 11:09.000]  It was not there.
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.000]  The colleagues had looked.
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  It was not there.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  The governor had told multiple newspapers
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  that he'd gone in to put it to bed
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  and the governor's allowed to go in and look at that
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.000]  and not show it to the public,
[11:20.000 --> 11:21.000]  but at least say I've seen it.
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  And it wasn't there,
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  and then it was going to be a big issue.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  That came out months before.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  So this had built to a head.
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  On top of that, Bush, during the campaign,
[11:31.000 --> 11:32.000]  even though he was leaving office,
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  turned out diplomatically
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  had the U.S. Ambassador to Kenya
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  say please go look at his birth certificate,
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  and they said it's been removed,
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  probably destroyed.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  Now, folks, that's hiding in plain view right there.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  That's one-plus-one equals two.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  Not even two-plus-two equals four.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  It's so easy.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  In fact, it's not even one-plus-one equals one or two.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  It's just looking at the number one.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  It is as plain as the nose on your face.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  This is not rocket science.
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  If it was removed,
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  and they believe criminally and destroyed,
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  then he was born in Kenya.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  Because it's not going to be cut out of the book
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  if it wasn't there.
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  If he was born in the United States in Hawaii,
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  it wouldn't be cut out of the book in Kenya.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  And then, of course, he flies over there to see this
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  and gets arrested.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  Put on house arrest at his hotel room for three days
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  to let him fly back.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  Because there's a new sheriff in town.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  Obama's the president now.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  He put his cousin, Odinga, in charge,
[12:39.000 --> 12:45.000]  a known communist slash Muslim.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  And when Odinga couldn't win the presidency,
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  the emails are public.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  When Senator Obama told him,
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  have your people riot and then demand a seat in government.
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  So they created a prime ministership just for Odinga.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  This is all on record.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  So, yes, we've covered this at Nazion.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  Because I saw this meme on the comments on YouTube
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  and on my site.
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.000]  You're not covering it.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  You're covering up the birth certificate.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  And quite frankly, I'm not somebody who's prodded
[13:15.000 --> 13:16.000]  into covering something,
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  unless I've already covered it.
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.000]  Well, I see some new facets, and then I discuss it.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  Or maybe it's COINTELPRO on purpose.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  You know, Alex works for Obama.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  He's covering up for him.
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  I mean, I see that as a meme out there.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  Or I work for the Russians,
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  because I've gone on Russian TV.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  It's like I've gone on Japanese and British TV.
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  Back when I was exposing 9-11 as a false flag event,
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  used to take our liberties any way you cut it.
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  People would say,
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  he was secretly trained in Afghanistan.
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.000]  He's a Muslim and all this stuff.
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  I mean, it's just cartoon level.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  The traders are the megabanks.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  That's the big threat.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  Okay?
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  I'm an American.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  I'm as American as you can get.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  So, Americana, my pedigree is ridiculous.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  And I won't even get into it here.
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  You don't get more USA, more America than Alex Jones.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  It just doesn't happen.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  And I think that's the reason, historically,
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  genetically, everything that I'm here today
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  fighting the New World Order.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  Because I didn't pay attention to my pedigree
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  when I was first waking up to liberty.
[14:28.000 --> 14:29.000]  I didn't like tyranny.
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.000]  And there's a reason.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  My ancestors didn't like tyranny by Mexico.
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  My ancestors were at the heart of founding this state.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  My ancestors were at the heart of the Mayflower
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  on both sides of my family.
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  My ancestors were at the heart of the Revolutionary War
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  against the British.
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  My ancestor was at the heart of invitting the stock exchange.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  My ancestors were at the heart of every big movement
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.000]  and every big change for good.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  There's a lot of truth to what the elites say
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  about who your ancestors are, where you come from.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  But the elites, they come from inbred psychopaths
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  who are always sucking off of everybody.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  My ancestors are people that resist tyranny unto death
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  and never back off and never falter.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  If people think the death threats I get
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  and the dirty tricks and the state police making more than
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  10 calls in the last three days to my local affiliate
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  trying to get me kicked off the air.
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  If you think that'll make me back off or be scared,
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  you got another thing coming,
[15:30.000 --> 15:38.000]  you anti-American globalist traitorous garbage.
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  But it is, it is, it is a flaming joke
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  when people say I am anti-American.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  America is the bill of rights, constitution,
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  declaration of independence, private property,
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  the family, due process of law.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  That's what America is.
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  And it grows out of the Magna Carta in England 1215,
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  paid for in blood.
[16:00.000 --> 16:06.000]  Freedom is not free.
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  It's just that simple.
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  And I will tell you now, before I get to the huge news
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  on the Breitbart front,
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  that the consensus from multiple national talk show hosts
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  I've talked to and from others in media
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  that are very close to the late Breitbart,
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  I will leave it at that.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  About as close as you can get, I'll just leave it at that.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  The consensus is he was murdered behind the scenes
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.000]  and the consensus is without anybody even having
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  to discuss things, forget the maneuvers, go straight at them.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  Everybody's just going to intensify
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  and nobody's backing off.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  And if the system thinks killing him
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  is going to make everybody run,
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  they've got another thing coming.
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  If they do start killing,
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.000]  if you start seeing people like Matt Drudge die,
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.000]  people like Michael Savage die,
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  people like myself die,
[17:10.000 --> 17:13.000]  and others, you know there's a purge going on
[17:13.000 --> 17:19.000]  and do whatever you think you need to do at that point.
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  I happen to know that Michael Savage
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  has a whole bunch of bodyguards.
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  I knew this a long time ago
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  and it confirmed it from other sources.
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  Now he's in the news saying he told Breitbart
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  to get bodyguards and he basically has them.
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.000]  And I don't care, but Watson was playing me
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  in the audio this morning.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  He reads our articles in full on air
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  and never even says where they come from.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  And then complains that Rush Limbaugh
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  and others rip him off, which they do.
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  But I only listened to Savage who don't have time.
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  He is an interesting talk show host, very intelligent.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  I think he's the best of the big mainstream host out there.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  I don't agree with a lot of what he says or does,
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  but he is a very intelligent person.
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  And he just reads our articles every day on air
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  and never gives us credit, which is fine
[18:00.000 --> 18:05.000]  to me.
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  But then a caller calls in and calls me
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  a globalist agent and Savage doesn't disagree with him.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  I mean, that's really uncool to read our articles
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  every day on air and then let a caller claim
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  I'm like a commie or something.
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  I mean, that's just not right.
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  But the point is, Savage...
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  No one has reported this.
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  Broadcast from six different locations
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  and is hiding and wearing disguises running around
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  and believes people are trying to kill him.
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  And I think it's true from what I've been told and heard.
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  Savage has bodyguards and broadcasts
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  from six different locations
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  and drives around in armored cars basically
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  and is even afraid most of the time to go out on his boat now,
[18:43.000 --> 18:44.000]  which is his favorite thing.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  That's why he lives in San Francisco.
[18:46.000 --> 18:47.000]  I mean, not me.
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.000]  I'm not going to live like that.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  I went and spoke to 800 people and 1,100 people
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  and no security, no bodyguards.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  You know, the venues had their little security guards
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  like ushers because I'm not going to live in fear.
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.000]  Now, I mean, I understand the strategy of, you know,
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  surviving and being able to cover things,
[19:03.000 --> 19:04.000]  but I'm not, you know what?
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  I'm just not, you know what?
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  I'm 100% straight on to the New World Order.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  I'm coming in hard and that's the end of it.
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.000]  I'm charging.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  And that's what I'm doing
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  because that's the only thing that feels good.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  If the minute I start giving in to fear,
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  I just can't handle it.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  I'm all in.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  My family, me, everything.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  Not compromising, not backing off
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  because there's a power structure in this country
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  and the Republicans want America to be this big empire
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  and corporate welfare and the rest of it,
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  but the Democrats are the side of the New World Order
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  that really do want to break up the whole family,
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  reeducation camps,
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  Shea Guava, a total takeover.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  And when we come back,
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  I'm going to tell you why finally,
[19:48.000 --> 19:49.000]  from Michael Savage,
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  do you name it they're coming out saying
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  that clearly Breitbart was killed
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  because Breitbart was going to release
[19:55.000 --> 19:58.000]  the fact that Obama is a terrorist.
[19:58.000 --> 20:01.000]  He was going to release it yesterday with the proof.
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  Folks, have you lost your power
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  because there's never been a better time
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[20:15.000 --> 20:16.000]  Here's why.
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  Solar power generators are now available
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  from our friends at Solutions from Science,
[20:21.000 --> 20:22.000]  one of our oldest sponsors.
[20:22.000 --> 20:26.000]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power
[20:26.000 --> 20:27.000]  when you need it most.
[20:27.000 --> 20:28.000]  Unlike gas generators,
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  a solar generator runs quietly,
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  emits no fumes,
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  and produces electricity from the sun.
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  It's like having an electric power plant
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  running quietly in your own own.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  Whether it's ice storms,
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.000]  brownouts, or blackouts,
[20:40.000 --> 20:41.000]  you'll never have to suffer
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  through painful power outages again.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  When the power goes out this winter,
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  you'll be ready with a solar power generator
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  from Solutions from Science.
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.000]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  That's MySolarBackup.com
[20:54.000 --> 21:20.000]  or call 877-327-0365.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  Have you ever wondered why bank stockbrokers
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  They've been available since 1986,
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  yet the financial industry won't recognize
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  the value of gold for your retirement.
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments,
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  yet no word about IRAs.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement,
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  call 800-686-2237.
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.000]  and low returns.
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[21:52.000 --> 22:00.000]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  Hey there, you've reached Claire.
[22:02.000 --> 22:03.000]  Leave me a message.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.000]  Claire, it's Anne.
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  we talked about before?
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.000]  The all-natural one.
[22:08.000 --> 22:09.000]  Ambron?
[22:09.000 --> 22:10.000]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  Not only did Ambron stop my hot flashes,
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  but since I started the Ambron program,
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  I have lost so much weight.
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[22:19.000 --> 22:20.000]  It's gone.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[22:22.000 --> 22:23.000]  I feel great.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.000]  Give me a call.
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  is hormonal imbalance.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  Until you balance your hormones,
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  Ambron restores hormonal balance naturally,
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  so the weight can just fall off.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  Plus, Ambron eliminates other symptoms
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  of hormonal aging too.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  So with your hormones in balance,
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  you can feel great and finally lose the weight.
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  Be one of the first 50 callers right now,
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  and I'll send you a complimentary risk-free trial
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  with a 30-day supply free.
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  Call 1-800-839-2959.
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  That's 1-800-839-2959.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  1-800-839-2959.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  kicks in the door of a dark house
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  that looks like no one is home.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  Make it look like someone is home watching television
[23:13.000 --> 23:14.000]  with fake TV.
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  Fake TV is a small electronic device
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  that makes the same light as a real television.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer,
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  but is far more convincing to burglars.
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm,
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  Use it any time you're away from home.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95,
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  go to faketv.com
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  or call 1-877-5 FAKE TV.
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95,
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  so get one for you and one for a loved one
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  Call 877-5 FAKE TV
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  or go to faketv.com
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.000]  faketv.com The Burglar Deterrent.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  Alright, we're back live here.
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  This situation with right-bark dying is extremely suspicious.
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  He went into a bar in his neighborhood
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  and had reportedly two glasses of red wine.
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.360]  He did not appear to have any health problems or to be drunk.
[24:30.360 --> 24:36.640]  He had a political discussion with a big advertising executive that he just met who's on record
[24:36.640 --> 24:39.720]  in the news talking about it and left.
[24:39.720 --> 24:40.720]  And then collapsed.
[24:40.720 --> 24:43.160]  He was taken to the hospital and they say he was dead.
[24:43.160 --> 24:47.560]  Now, he did have some heart problems in the past.
[24:47.560 --> 24:51.080]  People do die at 43 sometimes, though it's rare, but here's the deal.
[24:51.080 --> 24:54.760]  We now have had time to forensically go over this, which others aren't doing.
[24:54.760 --> 24:56.320]  That's why we're breaking all this.
[24:56.320 --> 25:03.280]  And if you go to DrudgeReport.com who's covering it, the top story at DrudgeReport.com is the
[25:03.280 --> 25:04.360]  Breitbart.
[25:04.360 --> 25:08.440]  Wait till they see what happens March 1st.
[25:08.440 --> 25:15.240]  And again, we'll put that article up on screen for viewers.
[25:15.240 --> 25:20.040]  But if you go to the DrudgeReport, you can see it up there in the top left-hand corner.
[25:20.040 --> 25:24.280]  Andrew Breitbart, wait till they see what happens March 1st.
[25:24.280 --> 25:27.160]  He said that about a week before he died.
[25:27.160 --> 25:30.240]  Also they're doing what they were supposed to do now.
[25:30.240 --> 25:37.600]  See, another big telltale sign that this was some kind of assassination is that within
[25:37.600 --> 25:47.400]  two hours of he being dead, within two hours of him being dead, they said natural causes,
[25:47.400 --> 25:48.680]  LA times and others.
[25:48.680 --> 25:52.360]  And then they said, well, we don't know why he died, but it's natural causes.
[25:52.360 --> 25:56.220]  Within two hours and that was being put out.
[25:56.220 --> 25:57.680]  That is always the telltale sign.
[25:57.680 --> 26:05.520]  You noticed with every other death, whether it's Michael Jackson or whether it's Whitney
[26:05.520 --> 26:10.240]  Houston, it takes weeks if not maximum six days like Whitney Houston.
[26:10.240 --> 26:12.760]  So out of the gates, it's natural.
[26:12.760 --> 26:21.080]  Now a couple weeks before, in early February, he says, I'm going to release footage of him
[26:21.080 --> 26:25.960]  in college, palling around with the weathermen and people like that.
[26:25.960 --> 26:33.760]  And there's a new article at infowars.com, Breitbart's footage shows Obama palling around
[26:33.760 --> 26:34.760]  with terrorists.
[26:34.760 --> 26:36.440]  This just broke.
[26:36.440 --> 26:41.400]  Obama's weather underground friends wanted communist dictatorship set up in America.
[26:41.400 --> 26:45.640]  And it shows them hanging out with the guy that openly called for this.
[26:45.640 --> 26:50.680]  The footage that Andrew Breitbart planned to release just hours after his ultimate death
[26:50.680 --> 26:55.760]  would have proven hugely damaging to President Obama's reelection hopes because it shows
[26:55.760 --> 27:01.560]  Obama's, Obama fraternizing with the weather underground terrorist whose goal it was to
[27:01.560 --> 27:06.080]  set up a communist dictatorship inside the United States.
[27:06.080 --> 27:13.120]  Now, the Breitbart site is saying that it will be released soon and the Associated Press
[27:13.120 --> 27:14.800]  is also picking up on that.
[27:14.800 --> 27:16.880]  But will it be the full footage?
[27:16.880 --> 27:19.600]  It's kind of like Eyes Wide Shut.
[27:19.600 --> 27:20.960]  The director had final cut.
[27:20.960 --> 27:26.440]  He refused to cut 24 minutes of it, Stanley Kubrick, and he died of a heart attack the
[27:26.440 --> 27:30.320]  day after he refused and said he would sue them if they didn't go along with it.
[27:30.320 --> 27:31.880]  What did it show?
[27:31.880 --> 27:35.600]  Elite families engaging in human sacrifice, which we know that type of stuff goes on.
[27:35.600 --> 27:36.600]  That's just what the elites are into.
[27:36.600 --> 27:38.520]  Oh, in fact, I've got an article about that today.
[27:38.520 --> 27:41.640]  We'll be covering later in the mainstream news.
[27:41.640 --> 27:43.800]  So all of this is going on.
[27:43.800 --> 27:47.720]  He says, I'm going to release footage.
[27:47.720 --> 27:51.000]  I'm going to release this footage soon.
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.800]  He comes out, he says this.
[27:55.800 --> 27:59.120]  He says, I'm going to release this footage.
[27:59.120 --> 28:00.440]  It's going to really hurt Obama.
[28:00.440 --> 28:02.000]  We're going to vet him this time.
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.800]  This time we're going to look at his real past.
[28:05.800 --> 28:08.240]  Obama is pumping trillions to foreign banks.
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.640]  Obama is giving billions here, 500 million there, billions to Acorn, you know, half billion
[28:13.640 --> 28:19.000]  to this group who never built a single, you know, energy system, alternative energy system,
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.760]  just total looting, total payoffs, shipping guns into Mexico that's killing cops, killing
[28:23.760 --> 28:26.800]  border patrol, killing thousands of Mexican citizens.
[28:26.800 --> 28:30.200]  They estimate shipping narcotics in.
[28:30.200 --> 28:34.520]  That's in the federal court cases, Chicago Tribune, El Paso times, months after we broke
[28:34.520 --> 28:37.040]  it.
[28:37.040 --> 28:46.680]  And now this group of known mafia criminals who killed cops, who exposed Oklahoma City
[28:46.680 --> 28:51.000]  as an inside job and threatened others that I've interviewed.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.200]  You quit investigating our involvement or you and your wife are dead.
[28:54.200 --> 28:58.360]  This is the type of stuff that's got the system scared because if we just start standing up
[28:58.360 --> 29:01.680]  to the bullies and saying, okay, go ahead and kill me, what's he going to do?
[29:01.680 --> 29:03.200]  They can't get us all.
[29:03.200 --> 29:06.680]  And let me tell you, this is going to backfire on them.
[29:06.680 --> 29:13.800]  All the Arkinsides and the rest of it, you know, when I was like seven, eight years ago,
[29:13.800 --> 29:16.760]  Rush Limbaugh started talking nice about Bill Clinton and saying, oh, I met him in a steak
[29:16.760 --> 29:17.760]  house.
[29:17.760 --> 29:18.760]  He's nice.
[29:18.760 --> 29:19.760]  Bill Clinton started saying nice things about him.
[29:19.760 --> 29:24.600]  So when you get to that superpower level, these guys start getting scared and they want
[29:24.600 --> 29:26.120]  to play paddy cake with each other.
[29:26.120 --> 29:29.680]  But if you're an Alex Jones, if you're a Michael Savage, if you're an Andrew Bytebar, if you're
[29:29.680 --> 29:35.640]  a Matt Drudge that they can't control, you are enemy number one.
[29:35.640 --> 29:39.960]  I mean, look, it's come out that the White House spies on Matt Drudge and his website
[29:39.960 --> 29:44.320]  and Homeland Security that he sets the media agenda and they don't like that.
[29:44.320 --> 29:47.880]  Let me tell you, pray for us all folks.
[29:47.880 --> 29:50.160]  And if anything happens to us, they killed us.
[29:50.160 --> 30:00.680]  We're on the March, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.680 --> 30:05.760]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[30:05.760 --> 30:10.400]  good sized meal that I was still starving, and my research led me to a well-known fact
[30:10.400 --> 30:14.640]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[30:14.640 --> 30:20.040]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[30:20.040 --> 30:25.080]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[30:25.080 --> 30:26.080]  be healthy.
[30:26.080 --> 30:32.080]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[30:32.080 --> 30:36.280]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and
[30:36.280 --> 30:40.080]  once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[31:00.280 --> 31:06.120]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[31:06.120 --> 31:10.680]  Whether you're struggling with food costs which are being blown up by gas costs now

[32:00.400 --> 32:05.040]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[32:05.040 --> 32:09.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:09.360 --> 32:13.680]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[32:13.680 --> 32:15.000]  allows you to have.
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.640]  That's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[32:19.640 --> 32:20.740]  is coming.
[32:20.740 --> 32:25.080]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[32:25.080 --> 32:29.080]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:29.080 --> 32:32.560]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[32:32.560 --> 32:36.280]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[32:36.280 --> 32:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[32:41.000 --> 32:44.800]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[32:44.800 --> 32:46.180]  to my oldest sponsors.
[32:46.180 --> 32:50.440]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[32:50.440 --> 32:52.440]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[32:52.440 --> 33:00.840]  Remember the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:00.840 --> 33:09.520]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:09.520 --> 33:18.040]  Now remember, the White House even came out a week before the release of the book exposing
[33:18.040 --> 33:22.000]  that he didn't have a birth certificate and the governor saying he'd gone and looked
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.800]  for it, it wasn't there and all the rest of it.
[33:24.800 --> 33:25.800]  They released it.
[33:25.800 --> 33:29.160]  The White House releases it because they were so concerned.
[33:29.160 --> 33:33.160]  Then they had Vanity Fair announce that the book had been discredited and recalled that
[33:33.160 --> 33:37.080]  they were offering everybody's money back as a black op to really try to kill the book
[33:37.080 --> 33:41.480]  and bankrupt the publisher because you don't just pay for the recall, they were seeing full
[33:41.480 --> 33:42.480]  retail value.
[33:42.480 --> 33:48.480]  So you sell it for $10 to the bookstore, they sell it for $25, you're totally out the money.
[33:48.480 --> 33:55.760]  They tried to create a run on recall, the reverse of a run on a product.
[33:55.760 --> 34:03.040]  And so undoubtedly, Andrew Breitbart signed his own death sentence and it's been declassified,
[34:03.040 --> 34:08.800]  the CIA, but also huge corporate hit men groups, many different nations.
[34:08.800 --> 34:15.160]  There are scores of different chemicals and compounds that metabolize out by the time
[34:15.160 --> 34:16.920]  they kill you.
[34:16.920 --> 34:19.640]  And they could tailor them for health problems you've already got.
[34:19.640 --> 34:23.400]  I mean, this is on record for 100 years.
[34:23.400 --> 34:28.960]  They can throw nicotine on you and it will go through your skin.
[34:28.960 --> 34:31.600]  The mobster generally be wearing a glove though because if it gets on them, it'll kill them.
[34:31.600 --> 34:35.320]  Your nicotine, it'll go right through the skin, make you have a heart attack, especially
[34:35.320 --> 34:38.680]  if you've got heart problems.
[34:38.680 --> 34:44.200]  They could put, you know, shake their hand and they've got thin gloves you can't even
[34:44.200 --> 34:48.760]  see and they just put it on there, shake your hand, person goes, takes a little glove, it's
[34:48.760 --> 34:53.560]  a one side glove off, boom.
[34:53.560 --> 34:55.200]  This is all on record.
[34:55.200 --> 34:59.720]  So he goes in a bar by his house where they know he goes almost every day, talks to people,
[34:59.720 --> 35:05.840]  puts that drink, drinks two glasses of wine, goes home to go to sleep to release the footage.
[35:05.840 --> 35:09.160]  And by the way, I've been pointing this out since yesterday and now talk show hosts are
[35:09.160 --> 35:12.920]  repeating it because it is common sense, but they're leaving something out.
[35:12.920 --> 35:17.160]  Everybody's saying if they release all the footage and release his communist connections
[35:17.160 --> 35:21.320]  to terrorists and the fact that he hung out with terrorists is basically a terrorist,
[35:21.320 --> 35:30.240]  terrorist, if all this is released, then we know it wasn't a hit folks, it was supposed
[35:30.240 --> 35:31.240]  to be released.
[35:31.240 --> 35:35.120]  Now, now listen to me because you're getting breaking analysis here that I've seen no one
[35:35.120 --> 35:37.480]  else say it was supposed to be released.
[35:37.480 --> 35:46.360]  He said yesterday, March 1st, now Fox News and others are reporting that the Breitbart
[35:46.360 --> 35:50.240]  folks they had on Hannity last night are saying it'll be released within two weeks.
[35:50.240 --> 35:57.840]  Why do you need two weeks to release something that was going to be released yesterday?
[35:57.840 --> 36:00.920]  You better believe an organization that big will be infiltrated.
[36:00.920 --> 36:06.400]  You better believe that people are being offered things, people are being threatened because
[36:06.400 --> 36:10.040]  this is about trillions of dollars and who gets it?
[36:10.040 --> 36:13.800]  The Republicans are just as bad in many cases as the Democrats, but they fight with each
[36:13.800 --> 36:22.800]  other over being in charge so they can distribute all of that largesse in different nepotism
[36:22.800 --> 36:25.360]  ways and others.
[36:25.360 --> 36:28.960]  Congress people say, well, we're allowed to insider trade, we're allowed to give pass
[36:28.960 --> 36:33.480]  laws, to give government contracts to companies we own or that we're principals in or that
[36:33.480 --> 36:36.200]  our wives or brothers or cousins own.
[36:36.200 --> 36:39.800]  Of course, it's illegal, but Congress gets caught doing it and they say, well, we're
[36:39.800 --> 36:43.720]  just allowed to now, we're allowed to torture, we're allowed to launch wars without Congress
[36:43.720 --> 36:44.720]  or Congress.
[36:44.720 --> 36:45.720]  Congressional approval, Obama says.
[36:45.720 --> 36:50.680]  We're allowed to have anti-gun regulations that aren't law, the ATF said last year.
[36:50.680 --> 36:56.280]  We just do what we want now or the UN says I can.
[36:56.280 --> 36:59.320]  You see, once they start getting rid of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution and we let
[36:59.320 --> 37:02.720]  them get away with getting rid of a few of them, now they're getting rid of the entire
[37:02.720 --> 37:03.720]  Bill of Rights.
[37:03.720 --> 37:09.560]  They're like, well, sky's the limit and here's the big question I want to ask everybody
[37:09.560 --> 37:13.800]  to listen to me very, very carefully.
[37:13.800 --> 37:14.800]  This is important.
[37:14.800 --> 37:19.720]  In fact, do me a favor, Curt Nemo's right next to us in his office.
[37:19.720 --> 37:22.560]  Will you call him in here please because I meant to tell him this before the show and
[37:22.560 --> 37:24.800]  I got stuck in other meetings.
[37:24.800 --> 37:29.960]  So just call Curt in here, we'll have a total transparency meeting right now in front of
[37:29.960 --> 37:30.960]  everybody.
[37:30.960 --> 37:31.960]  Okay.
[37:31.960 --> 37:33.460]  He's at lunch.
[37:33.460 --> 37:35.160]  Oh, that's right.
[37:35.160 --> 37:37.760]  I saw him updating and doing stuff this morning.
[37:37.760 --> 37:39.520]  He's, that's right.
[37:39.520 --> 37:41.360]  He's out doing stuff right now.
[37:41.360 --> 37:43.320]  Get me Watson on the line.
[37:43.320 --> 37:47.720]  Get me Watson on the line right now here on air, please.
[37:47.720 --> 37:48.720]  Thank you.
[37:48.720 --> 37:54.280]  I'm going to say this here in front of the whole world right now.
[37:54.280 --> 38:01.640]  Because Obama demanded the NDAA and demanded that the section be added by the Senators
[38:01.640 --> 38:08.960]  to allow him to secretly arrest, torture, disappear, kill Americans.
[38:08.960 --> 38:10.800]  In fact, guys, I meant to have you pull this up.
[38:10.800 --> 38:12.520]  We'll just do all this on air.
[38:12.520 --> 38:19.760]  Type in the Atlantic, that's a big liberal establishment publication in Google Web.
[38:19.760 --> 38:27.720]  Type in the Atlantic and the headline, Why Obama Can Kill Americans.
[38:27.720 --> 38:32.520]  Why Obama Can Kill Americans is from October of last year, 2011.
[38:32.520 --> 38:35.880]  It's just one of hundreds, but that's the first one that comes up.
[38:35.880 --> 38:40.440]  The Atlantic, Why Obama Can Kill Americans.
[38:40.440 --> 38:44.880]  And they go on to explain before the NDAA was ever passed that Obama was killing citizens
[38:44.880 --> 38:50.640]  overseas without judge, without trial, without declarations of war, and that his lawyers
[38:50.640 --> 38:56.800]  argued then we can kill citizens even in the U.S. without even letting anybody know.
[38:56.800 --> 39:09.800]  Now, because there is a NDAA, because there is a National Defense Authorization Act, just
[39:09.800 --> 39:19.400]  because it even exists, there it is, the secret memo that explains why Obama can kill Americans,
[39:19.400 --> 39:22.000]  the Atlantic.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.440]  The Department of Justice produced it prior to the assassination of Amaral Alaki, but
[39:26.440 --> 39:27.440]  they won't release it.
[39:27.440 --> 39:31.880]  Well, they've said publicly, we'll kill citizens for any reason, including if they don't
[39:31.880 --> 39:32.880]  turn their guns in.
[39:32.880 --> 39:33.880]  They said they can kill anybody.
[39:33.880 --> 39:35.920]  They said they can kill a million people.
[39:35.920 --> 39:37.340]  The President is God.
[39:37.340 --> 39:39.920]  He can launch wars without congressional approval.
[39:39.920 --> 39:41.640]  He can torture people.
[39:41.640 --> 39:42.640]  He can do anything.
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.720]  This is just like Hitler announcing he was the Fuhrer, the leader.
[39:47.720 --> 39:55.720]  Now, Obama demands in the NDAA, listen to me carefully here, this is important.
[39:55.720 --> 39:59.240]  I'm risking my life to tell you this.
[39:59.240 --> 40:15.440]  The NDAA, Obama demanded by Senator Graham Williams, Senator Graham, Lindsey Graham,
[40:15.440 --> 40:23.040]  of course Senator Joe Lieberman, Senator John McCain, and others.
[40:23.040 --> 40:30.280]  And they're on record, we played the clips at Naus, he demanded that the provision for
[40:30.280 --> 40:40.080]  him to arrest, kill, torture, disappear, black bag, no one ever knows where Johnny goes.
[40:40.080 --> 40:42.760]  Nobody knows where your wife goes, nobody knows where you go.
[40:42.760 --> 40:45.880]  He demanded and said, I'll veto if it's not in there.
[40:45.880 --> 40:49.520]  And then when Obama came out and said, I'm going to veto this, this is terrible, take
[40:49.520 --> 40:59.560]  it out, the senators came out and said, you are the one that demanded this, here is the
[40:59.560 --> 41:04.720]  White House legal letterhead where your lawyer said you wanted this.
[41:04.720 --> 41:08.680]  And Obama said, well, I did, but let's not discuss it, I'm still going to veto it.
[41:08.680 --> 41:12.000]  That way that killed opposition, because people are like, well, he's going to veto it, we
[41:12.000 --> 41:13.080]  shouldn't have to fight it.
[41:13.080 --> 41:14.080]  That kills debate.
[41:14.080 --> 41:18.720]  It passes, he signs it, as I told you he would do.
[41:18.720 --> 41:26.120]  Now listen to me carefully, again, this is teleprompter free, I'm drawing all this data
[41:26.120 --> 41:30.080]  up right out of my memory, you can go look up everything I'm saying here.
[41:30.080 --> 41:34.960]  That's why sometimes there's fits and starts here, because I'm, this is real analysis here,
[41:34.960 --> 41:42.800]  this isn't a big scripted deal, this is research.
[41:42.800 --> 41:49.280]  Our 11 came out, they all came out and said, we were ordered by the White House to do this.
[41:49.280 --> 41:55.280]  And everybody's like, Alex, stop saying Obama's going to sign it, he promises to not sign
[41:55.280 --> 41:56.280]  it.
[41:56.280 --> 41:57.280]  And people were shocked when he signed it.
[41:57.280 --> 42:04.400]  I know their tricks, it's military, it's military to say cease fire and then launch
[42:04.400 --> 42:07.040]  your offensive during the cease fire.
[42:07.040 --> 42:09.720]  Everything they do is pure deception, pure evil.
[42:09.720 --> 42:12.120]  If you're going to kill 10 people, why not kill a million?
[42:12.120 --> 42:15.680]  If you're going to rob one bank, why not rob 50?
[42:15.680 --> 42:19.360]  If you're going to torture kids in Abu Ghraib in front of their parents with battery acid,
[42:19.360 --> 42:21.880]  raping them, why not do it to Americans?
[42:21.880 --> 42:26.840]  You're dealing with abject criminals whose back is against the wall, who have engaged
[42:26.840 --> 42:31.120]  their new world order and by sheer momentum think they're going to carry it out, imploding
[42:31.120 --> 42:36.120]  countries by design, announcing private world government, announcing censorship, announcing
[42:36.120 --> 42:40.680]  federalization of all police, the state police are so bold, they're calling up trying to get
[42:40.680 --> 42:46.560]  my show shut down on 590 a.m. in Austin because I dared send reporters out and cover a fleet
[42:46.560 --> 42:52.280]  of gunboats they're buying against the people.
[42:52.280 --> 42:55.280]  They're calling the hosts, they're calling the producers, they're calling up trying to
[42:55.280 --> 42:56.400]  intimidate people.
[42:56.400 --> 42:57.400]  Why would they do that?
[42:57.400 --> 43:00.880]  Because they've been given a green light, this ain't America anymore.
[43:00.880 --> 43:04.760]  They've been told you're little polepots, you're little Kim Jong-il's, you're little hitlers
[43:04.760 --> 43:05.760]  now.
[43:05.760 --> 43:09.080]  Now get out there and crack heads, get out there and taser, get out there and boss, get
[43:09.080 --> 43:13.080]  out there and brutalize, get out there and scare them, get out there and let them know
[43:13.080 --> 43:18.400]  we own this country now, we work for foreign banks, ooh raw, down with America, yeah well
[43:18.400 --> 43:23.360]  America says down with your new world order and it's time for police and military and
[43:23.360 --> 43:25.680]  all the rest of you to really start speaking out.
[43:25.680 --> 43:29.960]  If you stand for this country, when the evil's out in the open, when the president takes
[43:29.960 --> 43:34.720]  orders from the UN and sits on the Security Council illegally violating Article 1, Section
[43:34.720 --> 43:38.960]  9, which is high treason, when they're killing people out in the open the day there's
[43:38.960 --> 43:40.480]  supposed to release stuff.
[43:40.480 --> 43:44.440]  And then tell us like children, nothing to worry about within an hour and 50 something
[43:44.440 --> 43:48.120]  minutes of him being dead, that's the telltale proof right there they killed him.
[43:48.120 --> 43:51.800]  And then of course it came out, he was gonna release it as a surprise yesterday.
[43:51.800 --> 43:57.280]  Of course it came out, it shows Obama with top communist killers and known bombers.
[43:57.280 --> 44:01.400]  Of course it, who do you think the new world orders got working for him?
[44:01.400 --> 44:05.000]  Obama's so blackmailed, he'll do whatever he's told.
[44:05.000 --> 44:11.360]  That's why Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mob boss now, the man in Chicago in meetings literally
[44:11.360 --> 44:16.120]  cracks his knuckles and tells Obama to shut up in front of congressional delegation, shocking
[44:16.120 --> 44:17.120]  everyone.
[44:17.120 --> 44:22.160]  Because Obama's nothing but a dirty little commie new world order stooge with a bunch
[44:22.160 --> 44:25.120]  of new world order CIA parents.
[44:25.120 --> 44:30.160]  Because they don't work for America, they work for the foreign banks that want communism
[44:30.160 --> 44:34.760]  to get rid of our private property to hand it over to George Soros and the rest of them.
[44:34.760 --> 44:39.920]  And I told you that the Murdochs would flee England, they're selling their houses, they're
[44:39.920 --> 44:43.560]  pulling out, they've got their whole family out of England.
[44:43.560 --> 44:47.120]  Told you weeks ago that was gonna happen, they fled yesterday.
[44:47.120 --> 44:49.400]  I told you they may indict him here.
[44:49.400 --> 44:56.720]  This is a purge, this is a Stalinistic purge that they are beta testing right now in America
[44:56.720 --> 44:59.480]  and they could kill anybody.
[44:59.480 --> 45:03.080]  They could kill Glenn Beck, they could kill me, they could kill Rush Limbaugh, they could
[45:03.080 --> 45:05.520]  kill Matt Drudge, they could kill Michael Savage.
[45:05.520 --> 45:09.480]  Michael Savage has been in hiding for months saying he's being followed and threatened
[45:09.480 --> 45:13.160]  and hit men are after him, it's true.
[45:13.160 --> 45:16.960]  Some of the people on his network think he's nuts, he's not nuts.
[45:16.960 --> 45:20.920]  This is real, ladies and gentlemen, you're like, but he's saying Rush Limbaugh's good?
[45:20.920 --> 45:24.000]  No, it's a power structure takeover.
[45:24.000 --> 45:29.720]  The new world order doesn't want to share with the Republican wing of the theft machine.
[45:29.720 --> 45:32.920]  It's not hardcore enough.
[45:32.920 --> 45:35.480]  This is an internal battle.
[45:35.480 --> 45:38.320]  And there are people who genuinely don't like the new world order.
[45:38.320 --> 45:40.400]  Matt Drudge has gone off the reservation, folks.
[45:40.400 --> 45:44.080]  He's talking about the TSA, the new world order, Breaking Bilderberg videos, linking
[45:44.080 --> 45:49.600]  to our video, front page of the head of Google at it.
[45:49.600 --> 45:53.240]  They understand America's being destroyed.
[45:53.240 --> 45:57.840]  And so I'm telling you, those of us, everybody has to circle the wagons against this because
[45:57.840 --> 45:58.840]  I have seen this.
[45:58.840 --> 46:03.960]  I told you they were looking at a perch.
[46:03.960 --> 46:10.680]  And days, days before he's killed, he says, I got stuff, we'll bring down Obama.
[46:10.680 --> 46:13.480]  And now we learn he was going to release it yesterday.
[46:13.480 --> 46:20.200]  Let's play from the grave this video clip from CPAC and he said the same thing in a
[46:20.200 --> 46:22.280]  bunch of other meetings a few weeks ago.
[46:22.280 --> 46:27.720]  Here's Breitbart, Andrew Breitbart saying, I've got the goods on Obama and now we've
[46:27.720 --> 46:28.720]  got more.
[46:28.720 --> 46:29.720]  We're going to cover it in a moment.
[46:29.720 --> 46:30.720]  Here it is.
[46:30.720 --> 46:33.520]  And so what do we get now in Barack Obama?
[46:33.520 --> 46:35.860]  Well, I've got videos, by the way.
[46:35.860 --> 46:38.160]  This election, we're going to vet him.
[46:38.160 --> 46:39.640]  I've got videos.
[46:39.640 --> 46:53.480]  This election, we're going to vet him from his college days to show you why.
[46:53.480 --> 47:02.280]  To show you why racial division and class warfare are central to what hope and change
[47:02.280 --> 47:05.320]  was sold in 2008.
[47:05.320 --> 47:07.400]  The videos are going to come out.
[47:07.400 --> 47:13.440]  The narrative is going to come out that Barack Obama met a bunch of silver ponytails back
[47:13.440 --> 47:21.760]  in the 1980s, like Bill and Bernadine Dorn, who, equally radical, said one day we're going
[47:21.760 --> 47:26.960]  to have the presidency and the rest of us slept while they applauded and they applauded
[47:26.960 --> 47:31.560]  and they applauded and they oversaw hundreds of millions of dollars in the Annenberg challenge
[47:31.560 --> 47:33.760]  and they had real money.
[47:33.760 --> 47:34.760]  Okay.
[47:34.760 --> 47:35.760]  Okay.
[47:35.760 --> 47:41.400]  Now we are learning the details and it's up at infowars.com.
[47:41.400 --> 47:47.200]  Breitbart's footage shows Obama palling around with terrorist Obama's weather underground
[47:47.200 --> 47:51.920]  friends, wanted communist dictatorships set up in America.
[47:51.920 --> 47:55.640]  He planned to release it yesterday, release it now.
[47:55.640 --> 48:08.000]  I want to know why his associates are at Fox Nation and the rest of it, Breitbart buddy,
[48:08.000 --> 48:17.800]  will release Obama college tapes very soon, within a week or two, within a few weeks.
[48:17.800 --> 48:18.800]  And who does it show him with?
[48:18.800 --> 48:26.280]  A bunch of known convicted terrorists, people that bombed police stations, people that,
[48:26.280 --> 48:31.720]  I mean, we're talking about real, real terrorists.
[48:31.720 --> 48:40.160]  I mean, here's Breitbart saying, I'm going to swiftboat you, I'm coming after you, I'm
[48:40.160 --> 48:43.480]  going to get you, I'm going to release it March 1st.
[48:43.480 --> 48:47.640]  And we've got the quotes, our article, by the way, is the sixth hottest Alexa search
[48:47.640 --> 48:48.640]  on the web.
[48:48.640 --> 48:53.400]  Five or six times you've had the number one story on the web and let's drive it to number
[48:53.400 --> 48:54.400]  one.
[48:54.400 --> 48:58.440]  Breitbart's footage shows Obama palling around with terrorists, that's our newest article,
[48:58.440 --> 49:05.120]  but the one that's the sixth biggest story on the web right now, top linked at drudgerport.com.
[49:05.120 --> 49:09.520]  Breitbart, wait till they see what happens March 1st, you can go there and see where
[49:09.520 --> 49:10.520]  he said that.
[49:10.520 --> 49:15.840]  He's going to release it March 1st, he's dead, he was the boss of the place and now
[49:15.840 --> 49:20.840]  it's not being released for a week or two, or it'll be out in the next few weeks.
[49:20.840 --> 49:22.440]  Those are the two quotes.
[49:22.440 --> 49:23.440]  Why?
[49:23.440 --> 49:27.000]  There's a bunch of national media's calling up, talking into waiting, or we'll have a
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.480]  big special, that's stalling, or threats are going on, I don't know.
[49:31.480 --> 49:37.520]  Release it now, don't really, a couple weeks means they're in talks to edit it, or talks
[49:37.520 --> 49:41.800]  to change it, you watch, and I think they're sophisticated enough to know other media wants
[49:41.800 --> 49:45.420]  to get it, pay for it, and then change it.
[49:45.420 --> 49:47.920]  It all needs to be released.
[49:47.920 --> 49:55.000]  If you're sitting on stuff about Obama, it needs to be released now.
[49:55.000 --> 49:59.760]  This is the reality, Breitbart, wait till they see what happens March 1st.
[49:59.760 --> 50:04.880]  Now here's the biggest news, and I'm going to get one of my writers to a story on this.
[50:04.880 --> 50:08.640]  Did Obama use NDAA to kill Breitbart?
[50:08.640 --> 50:16.080]  When the president demands the power to kill people, including in America secretly, just
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.400]  because someone wants that power is the evidence, it's like trying to hire a hit man, well that
[50:20.400 --> 50:21.800]  right there is a crime.
[50:21.800 --> 50:24.480]  It's a crime to try to say I can secretly arrest people.
[50:24.480 --> 50:28.520]  He wants that piece of paper to go to special forces, to go to corporate hit men, because
[50:28.520 --> 50:31.720]  this is all bureaucratic, and he didn't want to be blackmailed, and say okay, you've got
[50:31.720 --> 50:34.800]  authorization to kill people, now go kill Breitbart.
[50:34.800 --> 50:35.800]  His handlers do.
[50:35.800 --> 50:41.280]  See, they all want it legal, well you can't legalize torture or killing like that.
[50:41.280 --> 50:46.880]  But the point is, Obama has to be the prime suspect in any political death, because he
[50:46.880 --> 50:52.720]  shot the power to kill US citizens, and I know Breitbart, myself, Drudge, and others are

[53:00.360 --> 53:03.920]  IRS, the three most dreaded letters of the alphabet.
[53:03.920 --> 53:08.280]  If you owe back taxes, have unfiled tax returns, are receiving threatening letters or have
[53:08.280 --> 53:13.280]  IRS agents coming to your home or place of business, you need an experienced IRS agent
[53:13.280 --> 53:14.560]  fighting on your side.
[53:14.560 --> 53:21.160]  Call the tax relief division of the law offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978 spearheaded
[53:21.160 --> 53:22.880]  by a former IRS agent.
[53:22.880 --> 53:27.400]  We know how to negotiate a reduction in the tax you owe, stop wage garnishments, lift bank
[53:27.400 --> 53:30.560]  levies and negotiate an affordable repayment plan.

[53:54.200 --> 53:57.480]  Again that's 800-652-6978.
[53:57.480 --> 54:02.440]  Actual results based on individual client circumstances.
[54:02.440 --> 54:08.480]  Okay, again it's all coming down to a head.
[54:08.480 --> 54:14.240]  There's all these official White House advisors and memos and even internal fundraiser notes
[54:14.240 --> 54:20.080]  saying don't worry, there'll be a new Oklahoma City, we're going to blame it on our opposition.
[54:20.080 --> 54:23.240]  And who do they talk about in the opposition, Glenn Beck, Alex Jones.
[54:23.240 --> 54:26.800]  And Glenn Beck got so concerned, he came out and said, they're planning the Democrats
[54:26.800 --> 54:29.040]  a new Oklahoma City to blame me.
[54:29.040 --> 54:31.960]  Well, in those memos I mentioned too, buddy.
[54:31.960 --> 54:38.320]  Again, this is way past being a talk show host, way past being a big shot.
[54:38.320 --> 54:40.440]  That's not why I'm doing this.
[54:40.440 --> 54:42.080]  This is life and death now.
[54:42.080 --> 54:43.920]  And this is about not backing off.
[54:43.920 --> 54:47.000]  And they're going to gut our country if they win.
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.600]  Now the footage that was going to be released was communist training meetings with Obama
[54:51.600 --> 54:56.920]  and top communists, all funded by big banks who want to get rid of freedom, about sending
[54:56.920 --> 55:00.640]  Americans to reeducation camps and killing the rest.
[55:00.640 --> 55:04.200]  And I've been told by communists, we're going to kill you and we're going to send you to
[55:04.200 --> 55:08.640]  reeducation camps and I've been told by others I'll be sent to a reeducation camp and if
[55:08.640 --> 55:12.360]  I don't reeducate, I'm dead.
[55:12.360 --> 55:13.760]  Communists killed a lot more than Hitler, folks.
[55:13.760 --> 55:15.200]  These are dangerous people.
[55:15.200 --> 55:19.120]  Now here's Larry Grathwald, FBI agent.
[55:19.120 --> 55:26.440]  This is in the video at infowars.com right now, talking about the people, William Ayres
[55:26.440 --> 55:30.440]  and others, what they would discuss.
[55:30.440 --> 55:32.960]  And this is what they're setting up the FEMA camps for everything.
[55:32.960 --> 55:35.680]  The schools are already reeducation camps of a type.
[55:35.680 --> 55:37.200]  Here is part of that video.
[55:37.200 --> 55:38.200]  Get this out to everybody.
[55:38.200 --> 55:40.200]  Here it is.
[55:40.200 --> 55:47.760]  Again, I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[55:47.760 --> 55:54.640]  You know, we become responsible then for administrating, you know, 250 million people.
[55:54.640 --> 55:58.600]  And there was no answers.
[55:58.600 --> 56:01.920]  No one had given any thought to economics.
[56:01.920 --> 56:04.960]  Are you going to clothe and feed these people?
[56:04.960 --> 56:09.480]  The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese
[56:09.480 --> 56:14.840]  and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United
[56:14.840 --> 56:15.840]  States.
[56:15.840 --> 56:20.960]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called
[56:20.960 --> 56:23.720]  the counter-revolution.
[56:23.720 --> 56:30.240]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating
[56:30.240 --> 56:37.400]  and establishing reeducation centers in the Southwest, where we would take all the people
[56:37.400 --> 56:44.400]  who needed to be reeducated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were
[56:44.400 --> 56:45.400]  going to be.
[56:45.400 --> 56:50.400]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't reeducate that
[56:50.400 --> 56:53.600]  are diehard capitalists?
[56:53.600 --> 56:57.560]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[56:57.560 --> 57:02.160]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million
[57:02.160 --> 57:05.960]  people in these reeducation centers.
[57:05.960 --> 57:08.640]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[57:08.640 --> 57:10.640]  25 million people.
[57:10.640 --> 57:16.600]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which-
[57:16.600 --> 57:17.600]  Now go back.
[57:17.600 --> 57:18.600]  Let's play the rest.
[57:18.600 --> 57:19.600]  Back it up.
[57:19.600 --> 57:42.200]  All right, that's from 1982, Documentary, at infowars.com, we have the full interview
[57:42.200 --> 57:43.200]  there.
[57:43.200 --> 57:46.040]  And again, he was an FBI informant, FBI agents also recorded this.
[57:46.040 --> 57:47.640]  But this is where Obama was.
[57:47.640 --> 57:50.320]  He was in these meetings.
[57:50.320 --> 57:53.320]  And that's what Breitbart was going to release.
[57:53.320 --> 57:56.080]  And they're going to stage terror attacks and they're going to blame it on us and they're
[57:56.080 --> 57:57.920]  going to arrest us.
[57:57.920 --> 58:00.560]  And most of the police are going to follow their orders.
[58:00.560 --> 58:04.200]  And at that point, you know, you can't go to the camp.
[58:04.200 --> 58:08.560]  And I'm sorry for the moron police when you do follow your orders, but you now work for
[58:08.560 --> 58:10.440]  basically Stalin.
[58:10.440 --> 58:11.720]  And they've got you all ready for war.
[58:11.720 --> 58:15.760]  They told you the war is coming with the right wing extremists, the Ron Paul conservatives,
[58:15.760 --> 58:16.760]  the libertarians.
[58:16.760 --> 58:19.000]  They've said we're going to be bombing you and attacking you.
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.680]  Now, the feds are going to bomb you to get you to then attack us.
[58:22.680 --> 58:24.920]  And then there'll be a real war.
[58:24.920 --> 58:29.680]  And you're going to get defeated, by the way, the globalist banker forces.
[58:29.680 --> 58:31.000]  We knew this was coming.
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  We warned everybody.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.680]  They're probably still going to go ahead with it all, and they're going to probably poison
[58:34.680 --> 58:36.760]  and kill a lot of the leadership that's going to fight them.
[58:36.760 --> 58:43.600]  But in the end, we will defeat you.
[58:43.600 --> 58:49.440]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:43.960 --> 59:54.040]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[59:54.040 --> 1:00:05.560]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:10.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:11.360]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:13.720]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:17.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.720 --> 1:00:22.360]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.360 --> 1:00:27.960]  Well, have you ever wondered how the New World Order would try to take over our republic?
[1:00:27.960 --> 1:00:29.640]  You're seeing it right now.
[1:00:29.640 --> 1:00:34.760]  Staging terror attacks, blaming it on real Americans that are trying to save the country.
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:38.800]  Building re-education camps, turning the public schools into brainwashing centers, getting
[1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:44.640]  all the major academia prepared for mass arrest of citizens, training the police for it, getting
[1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:48.760]  laws passed saying you could secretly arrest citizens and kill them.
[1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:53.080]  And then the day, a big report's supposed to come out, proving that the president worked
[1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:57.960]  with the weathermen as a terrorist, basically, or terrorist sympathizer, fellow traveler,
[1:00:57.960 --> 1:00:58.960]  the guy dies.
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:03.040]  And within hours, they tell you it's natural causes.
[1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:06.480]  But now, the coroner and the medical examiner's office has said, no, we don't know why, dad.
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:14.360]  We're doing autopsy, duh, duh, the telltale sign is when all the corporate or media comes
[1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:20.480]  out and says natural causes within an hour and 50-something minutes, the LA Times and
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:21.480]  others.
[1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:26.600]  I mean, he's at the hospital, they find out.
[1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:34.000]  And then they get an article written in two hours, and it was all over the news, oh, yes.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.240]  And then what I thought was going to happen is started, they're going to have to wait
[1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:40.880]  a couple of weeks to release that footage that he was going to release.
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:47.640]  He said yesterday, he's dead now, it's not going to get released right now, kind of need
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:53.880]  to be some changes to what gets released, uh-huh, don't worry, I guess everybody involved will
[1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:54.880]  be okay now.
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:02:02.160]  You don't want to end up like Breitbart, and see, for me, that's so alien to be intimidated.
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:07.800]  In fact, it's the opposite, I feel so alive, I really enjoyed driving into work this morning.
[1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:12.240]  I love life so much, I just love being alive and conscious of my children.
[1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:17.840]  I love life so much that I am so ready for these maggots to kill me.
[1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:21.120]  And they'll probably try to do it where it looks like I died of drugs or something, who
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:22.120]  knows what they'll do.
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:26.760]  I'm not even worried about it, because the fight will go on, and that means that's probably
[1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:34.560]  why they may not kill me, but I've always told people that they kill you when you've
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:38.640]  got a smoking gun, and I'm just, my smoking gun is all their public crimes, and I'm here
[1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:45.040]  exposing it, but I've told people hundreds of times on air, if you've got smoking gun
[1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:51.360]  footage or documents, or you work in a classified area, don't start contacting media, asking
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:55.080]  what they want to do with it, because the phones are all being listened to, everything's
[1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:57.040]  being tracked.
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.360]  I'm going to tell you something here that's common sense, but I'm going to explain it
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:00.360]  to you.
[1:03:00.360 --> 1:03:06.320]  Ahmad Salam, to give you a real world example, was a security agent for the CIA and part
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:08.480]  of the Egyptian security force.
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:13.720]  He was hired to run a bunch of patsies for what he was told was a sting to cook a bomb,
[1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:15.200]  detonate, or train the driver.
[1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:18.680]  First he was hired, told you'll build an inert bomb, we're going to stop most of them extremists.
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:21.760]  Then you're going to build a real bomb that'll get a better conviction in New York.
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:23.000]  Now you're going to have a fake detonator.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  Now it's real.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.440]  He said, okay, they're going to bomb at this day, let's bust them.
[1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:27.960]  Two days before, they said no.
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:33.120]  He gets smart enough to record them, he knows they're setting them up.
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:38.640]  He went down to the New York Times.
[1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:42.600]  That morning, like two days after, he called, he was in hiding.
[1:03:42.600 --> 1:03:47.040]  He called all the media, CBS, New York Times, a bunch of other little media showed up, because
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:51.400]  the reporters weren't all agents, they were compartmentalized, and showed the tapes, gave
[1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:58.200]  them all copies, gave a press conference on the steps, and said, you know, I'm in danger,
[1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:03.720]  here's the name of the FBI people, I work for them, they let this happen, and I didn't
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:06.280]  want to go ahead with a real bomb.
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:08.560]  They paid him what was it, a million two to make him shut up.
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:12.200]  So instead of being killed or put in prison, he got a million two.
[1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:14.480]  And believe me, they probably got bodyguards protecting him now.
[1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:18.800]  They don't want him to die, because it'll become obvious they killed him now.
[1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:23.680]  Dead men tell no tales, I'm going to try to explain that to people.
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:28.680]  And
[1:04:28.680 --> 1:04:33.800]  Breitbart had a lot of power, he knew he had limbaugh behind him, and drudge and others.
[1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:37.640]  But you notice drudge is reclusive and hides out, he knows how dangerous this is.
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:44.800]  Breitbart's just running around, in the middle of everywhere, and just asked for it.
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:48.800]  And well, I guess I asked for it too, because I'm just not going to live in fear.
[1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:52.960]  But I tell you, it makes me think, you know, that I'm in a restaurant or something.
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:56.640]  I've had secured people tell me, do not go to the same restaurant more than once, because
[1:04:56.640 --> 1:04:58.040]  they love to kill you that way.
[1:04:58.040 --> 1:05:01.280]  We'll be right back.
[1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:05.320]  I had tried everything, I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting
[1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:07.960]  weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[1:05:07.960 --> 1:05:12.480]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[1:05:12.480 --> 1:05:18.120]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:19.120]  and be satisfied.
[1:05:19.120 --> 1:05:23.640]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at InfoWarsTeam.com, but I want to point out
[1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:31.200]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:36.000]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound, when I started taking
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:40.920]  the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two
[1:05:40.920 --> 1:05:41.920]  months.
[1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:42.920]  That's results.
[1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:48.760]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of
[1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:54.200]  their products, and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite

[1:05:59.680 --> 1:06:02.160]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:06.120]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[1:06:06.120 --> 1:06:07.720]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:11.800]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[1:06:11.800 --> 1:06:12.800]  or gold?
[1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:13.800]  It's true.
[1:06:13.800 --> 1:06:16.720]  Seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible
[1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:18.360]  that could even happen again.
[1:06:18.360 --> 1:06:22.520]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:23.520]  seeds.

[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.480]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:41.760]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.

[1:06:49.040 --> 1:06:57.560]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:00.040]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:07:00.040 --> 1:07:06.160]  Folks, Iran and the Middle East nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[1:07:54.240 --> 1:08:10.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:11.520]  You want answers?
[1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:13.640]  Well, so does he.
[1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:17.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:17.840 --> 1:08:24.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:27.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're fighting real bona fide tyranny.
[1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:30.440]  Our police are being federalized.
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:34.360]  Member of Congress for an article before of yesterday saying STSA is now going into all
[1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:38.800]  50 states, setting up checkpoints, they're not even bonded peace officers.
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:42.680]  The under federal command, they are commanding sworn police officers.
[1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:44.520]  The entire Bill of Rights has been overthrown.
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:48.800]  They're attacking countries without congressional approval.
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:53.400]  The Bill of Rights is in tatters, total surveillance, drones being launched.
[1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:55.360]  It is crazy land.
[1:08:55.360 --> 1:09:03.520]  But all over the country, from Maryland to Utah, state legislatures are moving to block
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:08.880]  the NDAA, to block the TESA, to point out that the Bill of Rights of Constitution is
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:09.880]  still there.
[1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:15.760]  Now, I'm going to open the phones up on Breitbart's death, and the fact that they now are not
[1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:19.920]  releasing the footage for a few weeks, they got to edit that down, that he was going to
[1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:20.920]  release yesterday.
[1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:22.920]  And that's one of the top stories on the web.
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:26.280]  Breitbart's footage shows Obama palling around with terrorists.
[1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:27.960]  It was to have been released yesterday.
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:32.000]  We've now confirmed, and our story is the top story on DrudgeReport.com.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.600]  It's at infowars.com.
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:37.080]  We should red-link that article.
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:41.520]  And it says, the mysterious death of Andrew Breitbart, he said, wait till they see what
[1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:42.520]  happens March 1st.
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:43.720]  He said that a week ago.
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:45.680]  Well, it didn't get released.
[1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:49.120]  And now the people that worked for him are saying it'll be a few weeks.
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:52.120]  Why is something going to be changed?
[1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:57.640]  He said this would bring Obama down, showed him, quote, palling around with terrorists
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:02.680]  that were planning in meetings to put Americans in reeducation camps.
[1:10:02.680 --> 1:10:04.080]  There's those camps again.
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:08.360]  Of course, that's just FBI informants and agents who were there at the meetings watching
[1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:09.360]  this.
[1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:13.800]  Listen, I flew down a communist about six months ago to be in a film.
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:14.800]  And it was so shocking.
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:18.880]  This is a prominent person that I don't even think I'll put it in the film.
[1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:22.360]  Because the guy somehow, because I don't like wars, thought he could confide in me.
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:23.720]  I was saying, we need blood.
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:24.720]  We're going to take over.
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:27.200]  We're going to be building reeducation camps.
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:29.680]  And I'm sitting there.
[1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:34.560]  I mean, it's just these people are out of control, folks.
[1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:39.920]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:41.400]  It's just so out of control.
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:44.320]  Now joining us are people that are fighting back against this.
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:47.840]  And then I'm going to open the phones up, open them up now.
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:52.960]  What's your take on Breitbart, Ron Paul, everything that's going on, the internet censorship is
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:55.240]  starting, the calls for shutting down dog radio.
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:56.240]  I mean, it's all on.
[1:10:56.240 --> 1:10:59.960]  And then once a war starts, they'll be able to get the public in line because we're in
[1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:02.360]  a war, which is the health of the state.
[1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:05.400]  The authoritarians have always said, I mean, you notice what's happening.
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:07.760]  World governments being announced, they're bankrupting Europe.
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:08.760]  We're next.
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:10.240]  Gas prices are exploding.
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:11.240]  It's on.
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:14.080]  I mean, I'm white knuckle here.
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:15.160]  This is not entertainment.
[1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:16.360]  This is not a joke.
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:18.480]  America is being taken over by authoritarians.
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:19.800]  This is real.
[1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:22.040]  This is real.
[1:11:22.040 --> 1:11:23.040]  It's all true.
[1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:24.040]  It's all in your face.
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:25.040]  I was right about everything.
[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:26.040]  I wish I wasn't.
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:27.040]  I'm freaked out.
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:34.640]  I can't believe it's worse than I even thought.
[1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:40.600]  Maryland Delegate, that's state rep, Glenn Glass and joined by legislative aide Aaron
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:42.200]  Jones.
[1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:46.680]  They are introducing legislation, three bills to stop TSA groping, a bill that would force
[1:11:46.680 --> 1:11:51.000]  TSA to privatize screening at airports and a bill that would allow Marylanders to opt
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:54.280]  out of the smart meter program, which tracks everybody.
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:11:57.480]  They're trying to put them in houses and charge homeowners for them and now admit they're
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:11:59.480]  going to control what you use and track you.
[1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:03.880]  I mean, remember five years ago, we were conspiracy theorist, all right, I'm ranting.
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:07.680]  But they're taking action and it's through the states saying no.
[1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:09.400]  The feds may declare there's no state power.
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:12.920]  That's because they're tyrants taken over by a corporate takeover.
[1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:17.480]  We've got to have the police, the military, the state reps, just be Americans.
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:20.400]  I mean, you're looking at pure tyranny in your face.
[1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:21.640]  Be an American.
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:23.200]  Just be a decent person.
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:24.200]  It's not hard.
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:27.040]  They say you're radical if you're just a decent American.
[1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:28.120]  But we're the good guys.
[1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:30.560]  We're not the bad guys.
[1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:33.640]  And the good news is military and police are waking up in a sewer of the states.
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:35.280]  Maryland delegate, Glenn Glass is on.
[1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:38.880]  Glenn, I know I'm ranting here, but I mean, do you agree that these are crazy times we're
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:39.880]  entering right now?
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:40.880]  Yes, it is.
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:41.880]  Very crazy time.
[1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:42.880]  All right.
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:44.080]  Well, you guys got the floor.
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:49.320]  Tell us about your piece of three pieces of legislation that could be a bellwether, a
[1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:53.880]  chain reaction, a domino effect across the country and break it down for us.
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:54.880]  Okay.
[1:12:54.880 --> 1:12:55.880]  Just real quick.
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:56.880]  I'm right here.
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:01.080]  I represent the great state of Maryland, the old line state.
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:04.600]  It's a wonderful state and we just want to keep it that way.
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:07.200]  And I'm honored to talk to you, Alex.
[1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:15.840]  I started listening to you over the summer and almost every night I look at the videos
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:19.240]  and listen to you and I've learned a lot.
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:20.760]  So I just want to say I'm honored to talk to you.
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:21.760]  God bless you, sir.
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:22.760]  I'm honored to have you.
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:24.120]  I'm glad I didn't.
[1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:26.480]  Real fast, we have four TSA bills.
[1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:27.480]  Four, okay.
[1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:28.480]  And four anti-TSA bills.
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:32.440]  And I'm here with, he's not my legislative aide.
[1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:34.800]  He works for another delegate, Aaron Jones.
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:38.700]  He's actually on the same line, so he's listening right now.
[1:13:38.700 --> 1:13:43.120]  So and we also have a smart meter opt out bill.
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:46.320]  And just real fast, I mean, there's people all over the state of Maryland.
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:50.640]  They don't like the smart meters and I would like to put in the bill to make them illegal,
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:55.560]  I have to get through what I can get through right now and what they really are is spy meters
[1:13:55.560 --> 1:14:02.240]  I've you know big brother meters anti-american meters awesome exactly get what you can get now so people can opt out
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:06.800]  That'll fry their program right there. Please continue. Yeah, so anyway, just a simple opt out bill
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:09.280]  It gives people the right to opt out of smart meters
[1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:14.720]  I even called the different utility companies around here and they say well, you know
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:18.360]  I went I talked to one lady and I talked to their boss and then another boss and they said well
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:21.400]  You have to have these put in your house. There's nothing you can do about it
[1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:26.280]  And then I didn't know I was a doctor at that time and then they came into my office and they said well
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:27.600]  What we're going to do is
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:30.960]  You know it's going to save you money, but you're going to
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:34.920]  You're going to be forced to have these smart meters in your house
[1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:40.920]  And you're going to have to pay for it and what they're going to do is you're going to raise the rates to make people pay for it
[1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:43.800]  And I have a problem with that and smart meters
[1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:49.200]  So anyway, just a simple opt out bill and that's what we're doing and people all over the state of Maryland are sick and tired of it
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:53.000]  And they don't want these smart meters. Yeah, all this tyranny is incredibly unpopular
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:58.840]  I've seen polls of like 97% in California don't want the smart meters, but they cram them down their throat
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:04.760]  They didn't ask us and I'm so busy. I didn't fight it. They threw one on our building a year ago and I'm in a lease building
[1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:07.840]  I don't have any choice. We didn't have the money to buy a building this size
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:10.760]  And I'm over in an industrial area
[1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:14.880]  Tell us about that the TSA legislation any time
[1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:20.240]  Aaron Jones who's helped craft some of this legislation wants to pop in just jump in Aaron
[1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:28.000]  Okay, I'll just what I'll do is let me just I'll speak on one bill quickly and then he can jump in and talk about war detailed bill
[1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:30.600]  Yes, sir
[1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:33.640]  The one the first one I want to talk about it's HB
[1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:42.240]  1106 and it just simply it's prohibiting a public servant from conducting a specific inappropriate search of a minor
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:50.920]  Without probable cause that the minor is concealing contraband or a weapon or without the consent of the parent or guardian of the minor
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:54.040]  establishing penalties for a violation of the act
[1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:59.600]  So basically it just it's prohibits the inappropriate search of minors. That's just one bill
[1:15:59.600 --> 1:16:05.160]  That addresses that one issue. By the way, that law is already on the books in most states
[1:16:05.160 --> 1:16:07.120]  That's why at these courthouses with the scanners
[1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:10.840]  They won't put people under 18 through them. The TSA is already breaking a bunch of laws
[1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:16.800]  Absolutely, so we we kind of we didn't want we wanted to kind of split it up a little bit and just
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:22.080]  Hoping and praying that we can get something and we got an AG opinion down here and
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:27.600]  We are also they said that we may be able to force the TSA to privatize
[1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:29.600]  in the airport
[1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:33.640]  So and the difference is that's not perfect, but it'll bring in competition
[1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:40.600]  So that they just aren't one big arrogant, you know block that can do whatever they want. Yes, sir
[1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:47.080]  So that's that's the two bills and Aaron's on the phone and maybe he can be a talk to you a little bit about the other
[1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:52.400]  Bill that's more detailed. Sure. Very exciting Aaron. Tell us about some of the work you're doing there in the Legislature
[1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:57.600]  Hi, Alex. Yeah, it's an honor to be on your show as well. Thank you. Listen to you for a few years, you know
[1:16:57.600 --> 1:17:02.640]  I want to say that you know getting this broadcast out really making a difference because you know, you woke me up
[1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:06.960]  You know, I helped with the Tea Party movement back in 2009, you know
[1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:10.800]  And then from there learned about the FEMA camps and everything else and that's that's what's fueling me
[1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:15.200]  You know, I'm just like you you got to do some about this and that's that's why I'm out here
[1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:17.500]  so talk quickly about the
[1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:24.180]  The main TSA bill that we have the main anti TSA bill it's a perfectly 1-1-1-1
[1:17:24.900 --> 1:17:26.900]  HB 1-1-1-1 and
[1:17:27.460 --> 1:17:33.140]  Essentially what that does and again, it's delegate glass had mentioned, you know, we have the Asian opinion it
[1:17:33.700 --> 1:17:37.420]  Takes the TSA out of the Maryland airport. It's kind of similar to what?
[1:17:38.420 --> 1:17:42.620]  What we've seen previously in other states with legislation that had you know
[1:17:42.620 --> 1:17:48.180]  I'm anti TSA legislation. In fact, it was modeled after David Simpson's bill
[1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:54.780]  So essentially what we're doing is we want to we want to go back through the original way that
[1:17:55.300 --> 1:18:00.860]  Security was handled before, you know, human security is a 2001 authorization act and all that stuff
[1:18:00.860 --> 1:18:06.380]  You know, we need to put it back into the hands of private security, which is handled by the airport
[1:18:06.380 --> 1:18:12.900]  So this bill takes it out. We have another bill HB 1245. It's delegate glass that alluded to, you know
[1:18:12.900 --> 1:18:16.460]  We put the we put the security force back in there, you know, and then
[1:18:17.020 --> 1:18:21.940]  As we are also saying we have contingency bills, you know, so we have the main bill here kick the TSA out
[1:18:22.180 --> 1:18:29.220]  That doesn't make it. We got three other bills which take segment this bill, you know, we take we handle children
[1:18:29.660 --> 1:18:31.420]  We say minors can't be searched
[1:18:31.420 --> 1:18:37.020]  We have another bill which privatized the airport and then we have another bill which says that the TSA
[1:18:37.260 --> 1:18:42.100]  Would have to be at least at the very least would have to be trained by the state of Maryland
[1:18:42.100 --> 1:18:48.820]  They have to learn the Constitution they have to learn the exact same procedures that say a Maryland state trooper would have because they're in your state
[1:18:48.820 --> 1:18:55.140]  And what's beautiful is even though the stuff didn't pass Texas it almost did it it puts out the story the moral authority
[1:18:55.140 --> 1:19:00.340]  It exposes what they're doing and just resisting gains momentum and exposes what they're doing
[1:19:00.340 --> 1:19:02.540]  You guys are doing an incredible job. This is so exciting
[1:19:03.220 --> 1:19:05.220]  Thank you
[1:19:06.140 --> 1:19:13.420]  And then also if I could quickly just add to as you said earlier in in before you introduced us we do have
[1:19:14.540 --> 1:19:20.100]  Anti-NDA a legislation in as well. I have a different delegate working on that delegate McDermott
[1:19:20.540 --> 1:19:26.500]  And he's from from northern north eastern Maryland and well, this is breaking news
[1:19:26.500 --> 1:19:30.660]  I knew about Utah and a few other states. I didn't know about Maryland. This is oh, yeah, this is breaking news
[1:19:30.660 --> 1:19:36.020]  So so we're gonna have legislation to block the NDAA stay there incredible gentleman one more quick segment
[1:19:36.020 --> 1:19:37.300]  I know you've got to get back to work
[1:19:37.300 --> 1:19:43.940]  But we're gonna come back in a few minutes and break that down and then tell folks where they can go to find the legislation
[1:19:43.940 --> 1:19:46.980]  That's been introduced so we can show it to other state legislatures
[1:19:48.100 --> 1:19:53.700]  Around the country. We have the moral authority. We're in the right. We're saying no to these usurpers
[1:19:53.700 --> 1:19:59.500]  We'll be right back with Marilyn delegate Glenn glass join my legislative aide Aaron Jones. Stay with us

[1:24:55.540 --> 1:25:04.540]  Let's go back to Marilyn Delegate, Glenn Glass and also legislative aide for another member of the state house who's helping get these bills crafted
[1:25:04.540 --> 1:25:09.540]  Erin, Glenn, wow Erin you just brought up NDAA
[1:25:09.540 --> 1:25:12.540]  I knew some others, I didn't know that bill's about to come out
[1:25:12.540 --> 1:25:14.540]  Tell us about that please
[1:25:14.540 --> 1:25:19.540]  Yeah, actually I'd like to throw it back to Delegate Glass for now, he's got a committee hearing that he's got to run to
[1:25:19.540 --> 1:25:21.540]  Sure, finish your point then sir, go ahead
[1:25:21.540 --> 1:25:27.540]  Yes sir, hey Alex, this is Delegate Glass at Glenn Glass again, I have to split
[1:25:27.540 --> 1:25:36.540]  Head down to committee hearing of two bills, but real fast, yeah, Delegate McDermott introduced the bill and he's a great fighter here in Maryland
[1:25:36.540 --> 1:25:43.540]  Hopefully he can call him one day, he's amazing, but yeah we don't want the military to use their troops on Maryland citizens
[1:25:43.540 --> 1:25:46.540]  I was in the army and it would break my heart to see that happen
[1:25:46.540 --> 1:25:50.540]  So we're gonna do whatever we can to stop that from happening with this bill
[1:25:50.540 --> 1:25:55.540]  And Erin's just gonna talk a little bit more about that, but I have to go, I just wanted to say thank you so much
[1:25:55.540 --> 1:26:01.540]  Maryland is a free state and we're fighting to keep it free and I appreciate you and everything that you're doing
[1:26:01.540 --> 1:26:04.540]  Thank you sir, God bless you, amazing
[1:26:04.540 --> 1:26:09.540]  Everybody's got to get behind your legislation, thank you so much, we'll find out those numbers, we'll talk to you soon
[1:26:09.540 --> 1:26:14.540]  I definitely want to get him on for like maybe the Sunday show and he's not in session that way
[1:26:14.540 --> 1:26:18.540]  Now going back to Erin, Erin you've got the floor for the three or four minutes, we've got left
[1:26:18.540 --> 1:26:23.540]  How do we get behind this legislation nationwide so it passes and then duplicates?
[1:26:23.540 --> 1:26:27.540]  Yeah, actually I want to talk on that for a minute too
[1:26:27.540 --> 1:26:34.540]  Now recently Utah has just gotten out and they actually used a very similar version of the house joint resolution that we put out
[1:26:34.540 --> 1:26:41.540]  So I know it's definitely getting out there, you can go to actually Road Island Liberty Coalition
[1:26:41.540 --> 1:26:46.540]  That's where I got the idea for some of the parts of the house joint that I put together
[1:26:46.540 --> 1:26:53.540]  This stuff can be found on www.riliberty.com
[1:26:53.540 --> 1:27:01.540]  And the bill is putting in conjunction with the 10th Amendment Center as well and they're doing great work over there
[1:27:01.540 --> 1:27:07.540]  So it shows the power of people putting out ideas that's being picked up by legislatures
[1:27:07.540 --> 1:27:14.540]  Oh absolutely, I know a number of delegates that go on to the 10th Amendment Center, they look and see what the issues are
[1:27:14.540 --> 1:27:21.540]  And then of course there's staff like me that comes out and says, hey these are big issues, they're very important
[1:27:21.540 --> 1:27:30.540]  I mean I can't think of anything more important going on right now other than maintaining our posthee commentatus, maintaining our right to habeas corp.
[1:27:30.540 --> 1:27:35.540]  Those are just fundamental rights that we've had for 800 years in a western civilization
[1:27:35.540 --> 1:27:41.540]  And to see those things being undermined by Congress is appalling, I don't know what to say
[1:27:41.540 --> 1:27:45.540]  I'll say this, it's bad but it's been a big wake up call
[1:27:45.540 --> 1:27:54.540]  And Texas almost unanimously passed the bill out of the house to stop the TSA groping which is already illegal, police can't do that
[1:27:54.540 --> 1:28:00.540]  And it got killed when the feds threatened a blockade of air travel
[1:28:00.540 --> 1:28:04.540]  Well let them bring the blockade, I mean force their hand
[1:28:04.540 --> 1:28:09.540]  And there's going to be a state that ends up standing up and it may be Maryland, it may be Utah
[1:28:09.540 --> 1:28:13.540]  How do we get behind this legislation, what's its chances right now passing
[1:28:13.540 --> 1:28:16.540]  So they haven't even given us a bill hearing yet
[1:28:16.540 --> 1:28:22.540]  Now the bill hearing is set, it's sent to say a house current resolution
[1:28:22.540 --> 1:28:29.540]  It goes through a committee we have here in the state legislature called the House Rules and Nominations Committee
[1:28:29.540 --> 1:28:34.540]  And they hear all the house current resolutions and a lot of times they'll do them all on the same day
[1:28:34.540 --> 1:28:39.540]  But we have one of the few house current resolutions that has not been scheduled to hearing yet
[1:28:39.540 --> 1:28:46.540]  So what we really need is just an outcry, you know nationwide, hey, Maryland, let's defend this
[1:28:46.540 --> 1:28:50.540]  Let's get you guys a bill hearing, you know, let's have this heard, let it have its day
[1:28:50.540 --> 1:28:53.540]  So the leadership's trying to keep it from coming to the floor
[1:28:53.540 --> 1:28:56.540]  It seems that way, because everything else has been scheduled to hearing
[1:28:56.540 --> 1:29:00.540]  And we have one of the few house current resolutions that does not have a hearing yet
[1:29:00.540 --> 1:29:05.540]  So we need this to go viral, we need people to start talking up about Maryland and getting this out there
[1:29:05.540 --> 1:29:10.540]  Do you need to get, obviously, what, contact the Legislative Affairs Committee Chairman?
[1:29:10.540 --> 1:29:17.540]  Yeah, or you could just contact, you know, any delegate, there's a number of delegates that are on that committee
[1:29:17.540 --> 1:29:21.540]  A lot of them are also on the Appropriations Committee
[1:29:21.540 --> 1:29:28.540]  Well, look, Glenn, I want to get you back up, you and the representative, the delegate in the next few weeks
[1:29:28.540 --> 1:29:32.540]  Aaron, thank you, thank you so much for coming on, thank Glenn for coming on
[1:29:32.540 --> 1:29:35.540]  And we'll talk to you soon, God bless
[1:29:35.540 --> 1:29:36.540]  Sounds good, bye
[1:29:36.540 --> 1:29:39.540]  Very exciting, that was Maryland delegate Glenn Glass

[1:33:16.540 --> 1:33:18.540]  Monday through Friday
[1:33:18.540 --> 1:33:21.540]  From 11am to 2pm
[1:33:21.540 --> 1:33:23.540]  Central, we're here live
[1:33:23.540 --> 1:33:27.540]  We've got Bob Shatman joining us for 30 minutes on the economy and world events
[1:33:27.540 --> 1:33:33.540]  Dr. Jerome Corsley joining us to give us his take on Andrew Breitbart
[1:33:33.540 --> 1:33:37.540]  I don't know what his take is, but it'll be foul play because he's smart
[1:33:37.540 --> 1:33:42.540]  I'd say 90% chance they killed him because he was about to release that video
[1:33:42.540 --> 1:33:45.540]  Proving that Obama was actually in the communist groups
[1:33:45.540 --> 1:33:49.540]  Calling for reeducation and secret arrest and overthrow of the US government
[1:33:49.540 --> 1:33:51.540]  Which they've done now
[1:33:51.540 --> 1:33:55.540]  The government's up there, but it's been overthrown, it's been completely... there's no debating
[1:33:55.540 --> 1:33:57.540]  This is treason out in the open
[1:33:57.540 --> 1:34:01.540]  They got the cops all trained for war with us
[1:34:01.540 --> 1:34:05.540]  Once they get us in a fight with the police, then the cops will take it personal
[1:34:05.540 --> 1:34:07.540]  And then the full civil war will be on
[1:34:07.540 --> 1:34:09.540]  And the Globals will sit back laughing at us
[1:34:09.540 --> 1:34:11.540]  We'd rather not have that happen
[1:34:11.540 --> 1:34:15.540]  But he was going to release the footage yesterday and died
[1:34:15.540 --> 1:34:17.540]  Died
[1:34:17.540 --> 1:34:20.540]  I'd say 90% chance they killed him
[1:34:20.540 --> 1:34:24.540]  And the biggest piece of evidence is how within hours
[1:34:24.540 --> 1:34:27.540]  We're saying nothing to worry about, move along, it's natural causes
[1:34:27.540 --> 1:34:29.540]  Let's go to your phone calls on this subject
[1:34:29.540 --> 1:34:34.540]  And then I'm going to get into
[1:34:34.540 --> 1:34:38.540]  India resists call to cut Iranian oil imports
[1:34:38.540 --> 1:34:42.540]  Ron Paul warming to political VP slot
[1:34:42.540 --> 1:34:47.540]  I am the one person who can take young people away from Obama
[1:34:47.540 --> 1:34:51.540]  Oil leaps to highest level since mid-2008
[1:34:51.540 --> 1:34:54.540]  Therefore Pio says Obama's birth certificate a forgery
[1:34:54.540 --> 1:34:58.540]  And that there is probable cause for a larger investigation
[1:34:58.540 --> 1:35:02.540]  No kidding, it looks like it was made with crayons or something
[1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:06.540]  We've got all of that to report on
[1:35:06.540 --> 1:35:10.540]  Scientists are shocked to find antibiotics, alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia
[1:35:10.540 --> 1:35:13.540]  Yeah, because most of it's generally chemical
[1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:20.540]  And antibiotics a lot of times will reduce a forever reason
[1:35:20.540 --> 1:35:23.540]  Swelling of the brain, I've had brain surgeons on to break this down
[1:35:23.540 --> 1:35:27.540]  Because the body sees toxins and things, almost like it sees bacteria or viruses
[1:35:27.540 --> 1:35:29.540]  And swells
[1:35:29.540 --> 1:35:33.540]  And so you take antibiotics, it can cause a shrinkage
[1:35:33.540 --> 1:35:38.540]  And so people then stop thinking that they're Joan of Arc or whatever
[1:35:38.540 --> 1:35:41.540]  Or that the new world orders after them, even when it is
[1:35:41.540 --> 1:35:45.540]  Can you imagine all this crazy stuff going on today, how rough it is for schizophrenics?
[1:35:45.540 --> 1:35:50.540]  And how many people think it calls schizophrenic really aren't
[1:35:50.540 --> 1:35:53.540]  But there's that news, this is really not new information
[1:35:53.540 --> 1:36:00.540]  Also the telegraph newspaper and others are now reporting on what we reported on
[1:36:00.540 --> 1:36:05.540]  Days ago that the major journal of bioethics globally is calling for the right
[1:36:05.540 --> 1:36:09.540]  For government and parents to kill children up to age three because they're not humans
[1:36:09.540 --> 1:36:15.540]  This is not a baby in the womb, well go ahead and how are they going to kill three-year-olds?
[1:36:15.540 --> 1:36:21.540]  I guess you like, you know, they're in their cute little dress or their little overalls
[1:36:21.540 --> 1:36:25.540]  And they're saying I want to go play, I want to have fun, look at the puppy, look at the doggie
[1:36:25.540 --> 1:36:30.540]  And what do you do, just shoot them in the head, maybe chop them up because they're not humans
[1:36:30.540 --> 1:36:35.540]  In fact that's what Dr. Peter Singer said, he said they're like mackerel, they just have no value
[1:36:35.540 --> 1:36:40.540]  Roaches, you know, old people, you know, trash
[1:36:40.540 --> 1:36:48.540]  And so all of you that saw our article on, what was it, Tuesday, it was Monday
[1:36:48.540 --> 1:36:52.540]  And couldn't believe it when we linked to the big medical journals saying it
[1:36:52.540 --> 1:36:56.540]  And you said this is satire, Jones is nuts, bunch of mainstream news today
[1:36:56.540 --> 1:37:03.540]  Saying it's time to start killing up to three, you're like that's crazy, yeah, it's crazy
[1:37:03.540 --> 1:37:07.540]  It's crazy to have TSA on highways now groping people
[1:37:07.540 --> 1:37:11.540]  It's all going to get a lot more crazy, Stalin killing 30, 40 million people
[1:37:11.540 --> 1:37:16.540]  Hitler killing tens of millions, Mao killing over 60 million, it's crazy
[1:37:16.540 --> 1:37:20.540]  The Aztecs cutting people's hearts out every day when the sun came up, it's crazy
[1:37:20.540 --> 1:37:23.540]  That's what happens when you let the crazy people take over
[1:37:23.540 --> 1:37:25.540]  It's whole tyranny, all right, let's go to your phone calls
[1:37:25.540 --> 1:37:33.540]  Herb in Washington, you're on the air, welcome
[1:37:33.540 --> 1:37:36.540]  Hey, buddy, you're on the air worldwide transmitting, can you hear me?
[1:37:36.540 --> 1:37:40.540]  Yes, I can hear you, Alex, this is Herb, the wild Mormon, up here in Seattle
[1:37:40.540 --> 1:37:44.540]  And I'm doing the best I can, I got me a little one watt, a radio station
[1:37:44.540 --> 1:37:49.540]  And you can even see me on TV if you want, and I got three super bullets for you, buddy, you ready?
[1:37:49.540 --> 1:37:50.540]  Yes, sir
[1:37:50.540 --> 1:37:56.540]  Okay, the first one is, have you considered that there have to be copies of this material out there?
[1:37:56.540 --> 1:37:59.540]  I'll bet you they're seeing a couple of weeks because there's somebody out there
[1:37:59.540 --> 1:38:02.540]  Making some sort of a bit torn file right now as we speak
[1:38:02.540 --> 1:38:04.540]  What do you think about that?
[1:38:04.540 --> 1:38:06.540]  We'll never know because they could edit it down
[1:38:06.540 --> 1:38:11.540]  I said yesterday, if they don't release it right away, that gives them time to edit it
[1:38:11.540 --> 1:38:15.540]  They're not just going to kill him and then just let it come out
[1:38:15.540 --> 1:38:19.540]  That means they've got infiltrators in there, that means they're going to try to manage it
[1:38:19.540 --> 1:38:21.540]  And I said, if they don't release it right away, it stinks
[1:38:21.540 --> 1:38:24.540]  I know how this stuff works, and it's not just that
[1:38:24.540 --> 1:38:29.540]  He had a bunch of other info and said he was going to vet an attack dog, Obama
[1:38:29.540 --> 1:38:34.540]  He was saying, I'm going to swiftboat you, and they said, you die
[1:38:34.540 --> 1:38:37.540]  And again, he was going to release it yesterday
[1:38:37.540 --> 1:38:40.540]  He said he was going to destroy Obama
[1:38:40.540 --> 1:38:43.540]  90% chance they killed him, and it might not even be that Obama knows
[1:38:43.540 --> 1:38:47.540]  There's all sorts of special interests getting billions of bucks
[1:38:47.540 --> 1:38:51.540]  Individually from our tax money that Obama hands out
[1:38:51.540 --> 1:38:54.540]  Like all of America's like Chicago Mafia run now
[1:38:54.540 --> 1:39:00.540]  And so that's why there's a lot of people that wanted him dead
[1:39:00.540 --> 1:39:03.540]  I agree on that, but bullet point number two
[1:39:03.540 --> 1:39:07.540]  Tomorrow is the caucuses up here in Washington
[1:39:07.540 --> 1:39:10.540]  And we need to get as many around Paul supporters as we can to the caucuses
[1:39:10.540 --> 1:39:13.540]  It's an open system just like it's supposed to be in Iowa
[1:39:13.540 --> 1:39:16.540]  You don't have to be a Democrat or a Republican to attend
[1:39:16.540 --> 1:39:18.540]  So it doesn't matter what party you belong to or like
[1:39:18.540 --> 1:39:20.540]  You can show up and cast your voice
[1:39:20.540 --> 1:39:23.540]  Paul has said that, and the headline is
[1:39:23.540 --> 1:39:26.540]  Paul threatens to take over Washington caucus and they should
[1:39:26.540 --> 1:39:29.540]  But what is your gut on Andrew Breitbart?
[1:39:29.540 --> 1:39:32.540]  That's what we open the phones up on
[1:39:32.540 --> 1:39:34.540]  It's got to be dirty
[1:39:34.540 --> 1:39:40.540]  I just can't see him not having copies of this stuff out there to protect himself
[1:39:40.540 --> 1:39:42.540]  I hear you and I appreciate the call
[1:39:42.540 --> 1:39:45.540]  But here's the point
[1:39:45.540 --> 1:39:47.540]  That we need to make to everybody
[1:39:53.540 --> 1:39:56.540]  It's too convenient that he said, I'm going to get you Obama
[1:39:56.540 --> 1:39:59.540]  I'm releasing in March 1st and he dies that day
[1:39:59.540 --> 1:40:03.540]  If you had some hard issues, bad ticker, whatever
[1:40:03.540 --> 1:40:06.540]  It's too coincidental
[1:40:06.540 --> 1:40:10.540]  But that, I wouldn't be 90% with just that evidence
[1:40:10.540 --> 1:40:14.540]  I'm 90% sure because of the way they handled it
[1:40:14.540 --> 1:40:18.540]  The propaganda rollout is what always lets you know
[1:40:18.540 --> 1:40:21.540]  And the fact that within less than two hours
[1:40:21.540 --> 1:40:24.540]  They came out all over the news and said natural causes
[1:40:24.540 --> 1:40:26.540]  And then said, but we don't know what they are
[1:40:26.540 --> 1:40:28.540]  When that's not how it works for the medical examiner
[1:40:28.540 --> 1:40:31.540]  The medical examiner couldn't even be there in two hours
[1:40:31.540 --> 1:40:34.540]  You know, the coroner's got to go check, got to decide
[1:40:34.540 --> 1:40:36.540]  Look at it, decided it was going to be an autopsy
[1:40:36.540 --> 1:40:39.540]  Then the medical examiner has to certify that
[1:40:39.540 --> 1:40:41.540]  It's not just one guy
[1:40:41.540 --> 1:40:43.540]  Because you can pay off one coroner
[1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:45.540]  You've got to have the medical examiner sign off
[1:40:45.540 --> 1:40:47.540]  And medical examiners are powerful
[1:40:47.540 --> 1:40:50.540]  They're like the sheriff when it comes to medical issues
[1:40:50.540 --> 1:40:54.540]  And it was the medical examiner in Los Angeles, the same town
[1:40:54.540 --> 1:40:57.540]  On record, that said no
[1:40:57.540 --> 1:41:01.540]  RFK was shot in the back by a different caliber
[1:41:01.540 --> 1:41:04.540]  He was not shot by Sir Hans, Sir Hans' weapon
[1:41:04.540 --> 1:41:06.540]  And then it even came out, who shot him
[1:41:06.540 --> 1:41:10.540]  And the LAPD wanted to go after him and they were shut down
[1:41:13.540 --> 1:41:16.540]  So that's why medical examiners are important
[1:41:16.540 --> 1:41:19.540]  RFK was shot from behind multiple times
[1:41:19.540 --> 1:41:21.540]  Sir Hans, Sir Hans had his arm pinned the whole time
[1:41:21.540 --> 1:41:23.540]  He was shooting a locale or a firearm
[1:41:23.540 --> 1:41:25.540]  Go look it up, there's copies of the medical examiner report
[1:41:25.540 --> 1:41:28.540]  The coroner and the medical examiner
[1:41:28.540 --> 1:41:32.540]  It's like the medical examiner is like the police chief of the coroners
[1:41:32.540 --> 1:41:35.540]  Well, some areas they call the coroner, the medical examiner, it varies
[1:41:35.540 --> 1:41:37.540]  But you've got people that do the autopsy
[1:41:37.540 --> 1:41:39.540]  And the coroner or the medical examiner signs off
[1:41:39.540 --> 1:41:45.540]  But in general parlance, they call someone that's doing the body work at coroner
[1:41:45.540 --> 1:41:48.540]  But the point is, I'm going to go to your phone calls
[1:41:48.540 --> 1:41:50.540]  I'm going off into factoid land
[1:41:50.540 --> 1:41:53.540]  Doug in Maryland, you're on the air, go ahead
[1:41:53.540 --> 1:41:55.540]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[1:41:55.540 --> 1:41:56.540]  Good
[1:41:56.540 --> 1:42:01.540]  Hey, when the Breitbart news broke yesterday
[1:42:01.540 --> 1:42:05.540]  I mean, myself and my co-workers just shook our heads
[1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:10.540]  As there's no doubt, he had to be removed
[1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:16.540]  He had information on Obama and he had to be removed
[1:42:16.540 --> 1:42:20.540]  It's funny, you had those delegates from Maryland
[1:42:20.540 --> 1:42:24.540]  Because I'm coming from Maryland as we speak
[1:42:24.540 --> 1:42:27.540]  But those delegates from Maryland need to hear this
[1:42:27.540 --> 1:42:32.540]  Out here in eastern Maryland, there is a private club
[1:42:32.540 --> 1:42:35.540]  Called the Private Affair
[1:42:35.540 --> 1:42:39.540]  You can go to Google and Google the website and you'll find it
[1:42:39.540 --> 1:42:43.540]  And what that is, it's some kind of freaky
[1:42:43.540 --> 1:42:48.540]  Waveswapper Swinger Club for these Washington elites
[1:42:48.540 --> 1:42:53.540]  That come up 95 and go to the Private Affair
[1:42:53.540 --> 1:42:58.540]  This club is hidden inside a junkyard
[1:42:58.540 --> 1:43:02.540]  It is guarded by off-duty Maryland state police
[1:43:02.540 --> 1:43:05.540]  And off-duty local police
[1:43:05.540 --> 1:43:07.540]  Let me stop you, Maryland police actually
[1:43:07.540 --> 1:43:10.540]  About three years ago, the big scandal, running prostitutes
[1:43:10.540 --> 1:43:12.540]  And there was a bunch of deaths associated with it
[1:43:12.540 --> 1:43:15.540]  And that was DC Madame's stuff
[1:43:15.540 --> 1:43:17.540]  She was telling people, I have more names
[1:43:17.540 --> 1:43:19.540]  And I'm like, they're going to kill you and they did kill her
[1:43:19.540 --> 1:43:22.540]  So I don't know about the particular place you're talking about
[1:43:22.540 --> 1:43:23.540]  We had to look into that
[1:43:23.540 --> 1:43:26.540]  But yeah, they got these wife-swapping deals all over the place
[1:43:26.540 --> 1:43:29.540]  It's real popular, sounds like a nightmare to me, man
[1:43:29.540 --> 1:43:33.540]  But anyways, it's not like I'm some dog that just...
[1:43:33.540 --> 1:43:38.540]  I don't understand it, but side issue
[1:43:38.540 --> 1:43:40.540]  It just sounds like a nightmare to me
[1:43:40.540 --> 1:43:42.540]  But to each their own, whatever
[1:43:42.540 --> 1:43:44.540]  The point is, is that you've got all that going on
[1:43:44.540 --> 1:43:46.540]  You've got all that happening
[1:43:46.540 --> 1:43:48.540]  And yes, I mean, I know prostitution, all of it
[1:43:48.540 --> 1:43:50.540]  The few times I've been in DC
[1:43:50.540 --> 1:43:53.540]  I mean, the level of beautiful women, the cream of America
[1:43:53.540 --> 1:43:55.540]  They like super models
[1:43:55.540 --> 1:43:57.540]  When I'm in Georgetown and other areas
[1:43:57.540 --> 1:43:59.540]  Just packing into limos, politicians pulling up
[1:43:59.540 --> 1:44:02.540]  Secret service saying, what are you looking at?
[1:44:02.540 --> 1:44:04.540]  Just trying to eat at restaurants, anywhere
[1:44:04.540 --> 1:44:06.540]  Just beautiful women everywhere
[1:44:06.540 --> 1:44:09.540]  Servicing the lobbyists and the politicians
[1:44:09.540 --> 1:44:11.540]  And it just shows what our country's become
[1:44:11.540 --> 1:44:13.540]  I appreciate your call
[1:44:13.540 --> 1:44:15.540]  Let's talk to Carl in Oregon, you're on the air
[1:44:15.540 --> 1:44:16.540]  Go ahead
[1:44:16.540 --> 1:44:18.540]  Welcome back to the Central...
[1:44:18.540 --> 1:44:20.540]  Come in there, T-Rex
[1:44:20.540 --> 1:44:22.540]  I have a comment, I have a question
[1:44:22.540 --> 1:44:24.540]  And a little bit of concern
[1:44:24.540 --> 1:44:26.540]  And a statement to make about the Breitbart incident
[1:44:26.540 --> 1:44:27.540]  Go ahead
[1:44:27.540 --> 1:44:29.540]  Okay
[1:44:29.540 --> 1:44:31.540]  First of all, history repeats itself
[1:44:31.540 --> 1:44:34.540]  Always from Julius Caesar to Abraham Lincoln
[1:44:34.540 --> 1:44:36.540]  To JFK to RFK
[1:44:36.540 --> 1:44:38.540]  Same thing
[1:44:38.540 --> 1:44:40.540]  It's a little bit more covert
[1:44:40.540 --> 1:44:43.540]  Because they're using some type of high-tech
[1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:46.540]  System however they pulled it off
[1:44:46.540 --> 1:44:48.540]  It's going to take a bit of time to be able to
[1:44:48.540 --> 1:44:50.540]  Find out how they did it
[1:44:50.540 --> 1:44:53.540]  Well, my dad is a dentist, oral surgeon, a physician
[1:44:53.540 --> 1:44:55.540]  And he was showing me documents
[1:44:55.540 --> 1:44:57.540]  That the CIA, this is declassified
[1:44:57.540 --> 1:44:59.540]  Have these sound wave systems
[1:44:59.540 --> 1:45:01.540]  That you can't even hear
[1:45:01.540 --> 1:45:03.540]  Except your teeth will chatter
[1:45:03.540 --> 1:45:05.540]  And they love to use them on older people
[1:45:05.540 --> 1:45:07.540]  Like housing mubarak
[1:45:07.540 --> 1:45:09.540]  All these guys where they take down their country
[1:45:09.540 --> 1:45:11.540]  They then have a stroke that day
[1:45:11.540 --> 1:45:13.540]  And they can hit them from even a couple hundred yards
[1:45:13.540 --> 1:45:16.540]  With this and it vibrates the carotid arteries
[1:45:16.540 --> 1:45:19.540]  That are full generally of all the detritus
[1:45:19.540 --> 1:45:22.540]  All the cholesterol and scale
[1:45:22.540 --> 1:45:24.540]  And then that goes into your brain
[1:45:24.540 --> 1:45:27.540]  And yes, they do have systems they can shoot at a heart
[1:45:27.540 --> 1:45:29.540]  And kill you dead in a hammer
[1:45:29.540 --> 1:45:32.540]  And they admit they've got these
[1:45:32.540 --> 1:45:35.540]  They use lower versions of them
[1:45:35.540 --> 1:45:37.540]  With the sound cannons, the microwave guns
[1:45:37.540 --> 1:45:40.540]  That all comes out of technology to kill people
[1:45:40.540 --> 1:45:42.540]  Covertly, so yes, that's on record
[1:45:42.540 --> 1:45:44.540]  And I'm telling you folks, if they kill me
[1:45:44.540 --> 1:45:46.540]  If I die of a heart attack or drug overdose
[1:45:46.540 --> 1:45:48.540]  I don't use illegal drugs
[1:45:48.540 --> 1:45:50.540]  I don't use prescription drugs
[1:45:50.540 --> 1:45:52.540]  Other than like aspirin or Tylenol
[1:45:52.540 --> 1:45:54.540]  Sometimes when I have a headache
[1:45:54.540 --> 1:45:56.540]  I don't even hardly drink very much
[1:45:56.540 --> 1:45:58.540]  I drink like two cups of coffee a day
[1:45:58.540 --> 1:46:00.540]  And I'm in good shape and my family
[1:46:00.540 --> 1:46:03.540]  Have constitutions of mules
[1:46:03.540 --> 1:46:06.540]  Okay, so I'm not going anywhere
[1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:08.540]  Sorry, go ahead
[1:46:08.540 --> 1:46:10.540]  I'm concerned about fritz, fritz
[1:46:10.540 --> 1:46:12.540]  I went in tune to the grocery store
[1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:14.540]  He shopped at the local grocery store that I went to
[1:46:14.540 --> 1:46:16.540]  I passed right by him, he didn't know who I was
[1:46:16.540 --> 1:46:18.540]  Obviously I try to say hello, he seemed kind of somber
[1:46:18.540 --> 1:46:20.540]  Maybe he's a little bit worried, I'm concerned about him
[1:46:20.540 --> 1:46:23.540]  He's going to be a guest coming up on the show pretty soon, isn't he?
[1:46:23.540 --> 1:46:24.540]  Yes
[1:46:24.540 --> 1:46:27.540]  Alright, so you didn't call in though about Breitbart?
[1:46:27.540 --> 1:46:30.540]  I did, yeah, that's what my take on that is
[1:46:30.540 --> 1:46:32.540]  Is that history repeats itself
[1:46:32.540 --> 1:46:34.540]  I mean, it's just different forms
[1:46:34.540 --> 1:46:37.540]  That you use now in these days as you just mentioned
[1:46:37.540 --> 1:46:41.540]  Is more covert means, or use some type of weapons
[1:46:41.540 --> 1:46:43.540]  Like electronic weapons
[1:46:43.540 --> 1:46:45.540]  Or however they're used, or chemicals
[1:46:45.540 --> 1:46:47.540]  Or whatever they put in our water
[1:46:47.540 --> 1:46:49.540]  Or food or vaccines
[1:46:49.540 --> 1:46:51.540]  No, it's on record, they've got thousands of different systems
[1:46:51.540 --> 1:46:53.540]  I mean, just to kill Castro
[1:46:53.540 --> 1:46:55.540]  They came up with hundreds of different covert means
[1:46:55.540 --> 1:46:57.540]  I appreciate your call
[1:46:57.540 --> 1:47:00.540]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ivan in Florida
[1:47:02.540 --> 1:47:03.540]  How you doing?
[1:47:03.540 --> 1:47:05.540]  Good, go ahead
[1:47:05.540 --> 1:47:07.540]  Pretty good, I like your show in Orlando
[1:47:07.540 --> 1:47:09.540]  Pretty good
[1:47:09.540 --> 1:47:11.540]  This call is about Andrew
[1:47:11.540 --> 1:47:14.540]  Yeah, I absolutely think he was definitely killed
[1:47:14.540 --> 1:47:16.540]  No doubt in my mind
[1:47:16.540 --> 1:47:17.540]  Another question
[1:47:17.540 --> 1:47:21.540]  How hard would it be to get that footage of his
[1:47:21.540 --> 1:47:24.540]  And expose it on your show?
[1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:27.540]  Well, obviously that's very valuable footage
[1:47:27.540 --> 1:47:29.540]  For media outlets, for their traffic
[1:47:29.540 --> 1:47:31.540]  And how they fund themselves and pay their staff
[1:47:31.540 --> 1:47:33.540]  So it's going to be released by the Breitbart folks
[1:47:33.540 --> 1:47:35.540]  Which is great, they're the ones that went out and got it
[1:47:35.540 --> 1:47:38.540]  I mean, they do real hard investigative
[1:47:38.540 --> 1:47:41.540]  Undercover people, you know, they do
[1:47:41.540 --> 1:47:43.540]  Gathering the data, that's why they're so big
[1:47:43.540 --> 1:47:45.540]  And that's why it's so dangerous
[1:47:45.540 --> 1:47:48.540]  Is that when you start really digging into
[1:47:48.540 --> 1:47:51.540]  Original research, and when I stuck into Bohemian Grove
[1:47:51.540 --> 1:47:54.540]  The death threats, the dirty tricks were immediate
[1:47:54.540 --> 1:47:59.540]  Because it was original, hardcore, real, journalistic proof
[1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:01.540]  When I got from law enforcement, good police officers
[1:48:01.540 --> 1:48:04.540]  State police, and then later federal marshals
[1:48:04.540 --> 1:48:06.540]  Internal homeland security documents
[1:48:06.540 --> 1:48:09.540]  I got threatened, dirty tricks, immediately
[1:48:09.540 --> 1:48:11.540]  Immediately
[1:48:11.540 --> 1:48:14.540]  And then it totally freaked out one of the people
[1:48:14.540 --> 1:48:17.540]  Because they didn't know that when they gave us the info
[1:48:17.540 --> 1:48:20.540]  They were already under surveillance and got in trouble for it
[1:48:20.540 --> 1:48:22.540]  Of course, it's all surveilled
[1:48:22.540 --> 1:48:24.540]  That's the point, people are like, well what do I have to hide?
[1:48:24.540 --> 1:48:26.540]  You know, why do I care if I'm surveilled?
[1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:29.540]  Because the crooks are going to use it to stop you from doing right
[1:48:29.540 --> 1:48:33.540]  But so, you're a Big 810 Lister there in Orlando
[1:48:33.540 --> 1:48:35.540]  We're number one, and you came out to the event
[1:48:35.540 --> 1:48:37.540]  I want to thank you for doing that, sir
[1:48:37.540 --> 1:48:38.540]  Thank you
[1:48:38.540 --> 1:48:40.540]  Anything else?
[1:48:40.540 --> 1:48:41.540]  No, that's it
[1:48:41.540 --> 1:48:43.540]  Alright, God bless you, I appreciate your call
[1:48:43.540 --> 1:48:46.540]  Let's go ahead now and take another call here
[1:48:46.540 --> 1:48:50.540]  Let's talk to Jonathan in Kansas Disagree
[1:48:50.540 --> 1:48:52.540]  So we'll skip ahead to him and then go to Mike
[1:48:52.540 --> 1:48:54.540]  Go ahead, Jonathan, you're on the air
[1:48:54.540 --> 1:48:57.540]  Well, it's not necessarily disagreeing me, it's a criticism
[1:48:57.540 --> 1:49:00.540]  Alex, you cannot waste any time
[1:49:00.540 --> 1:49:05.540]  You need to get Wayne Madsen on and get him to bet everything he has
[1:49:05.540 --> 1:49:11.540]  This time around is probably the most dangerous for him ever
[1:49:11.540 --> 1:49:16.540]  And instead of precedents with Breitbart, he's, you know...
[1:49:16.540 --> 1:49:18.540]  Now, I hear you, let me just stop you for a minute
[1:49:18.540 --> 1:49:21.540]  He's been going to Chicago and all over tracking the same mafia ties
[1:49:21.540 --> 1:49:24.540]  And I agree, he was told by a high level government source
[1:49:24.540 --> 1:49:27.540]  That he has been shingled out to die
[1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:29.540]  But then a lot of times they don't find the right hitmen
[1:49:29.540 --> 1:49:31.540]  Or it doesn't really happen
[1:49:31.540 --> 1:49:34.540]  And then he left the country for four or five months and then came back
[1:49:34.540 --> 1:49:35.540]  Call Chris in here
[1:49:35.540 --> 1:49:37.540]  Look, we're on the same page
[1:49:37.540 --> 1:49:41.540]  I called Chris last night and this morning and said, get Wayne Madsen on
[1:49:41.540 --> 1:49:43.540]  I may be able to interview him on the nightly news tonight
[1:49:43.540 --> 1:49:44.540]  But we were unable to get Madsen
[1:49:44.540 --> 1:49:48.540]  I said, get me Jerome Corsi and get me Wayne Madsen
[1:49:48.540 --> 1:49:51.540]  Come on in, what did...
[1:49:51.540 --> 1:49:53.540]  Because I can't really see through the window
[1:49:53.540 --> 1:49:55.540]  Were you able to get ahold of Madsen?
[1:49:55.540 --> 1:49:57.540]  Did he answer his phone?
[1:49:57.540 --> 1:50:00.540]  So you have called him?
[1:50:00.540 --> 1:50:02.540]  Okay, yeah, because he's key
[1:50:02.540 --> 1:50:05.540]  He's key, key, key
[1:50:05.540 --> 1:50:07.540]  I agree with this caller
[1:50:07.540 --> 1:50:09.540]  I absolutely agree with this caller
[1:50:09.540 --> 1:50:10.540]  So he hasn't been called yet
[1:50:10.540 --> 1:50:12.540]  He's going to be called right now
[1:50:12.540 --> 1:50:15.540]  Because I said get me both of them and they got the other
[1:50:15.540 --> 1:50:17.540]  I guess they were going to get him on Monday or so
[1:50:17.540 --> 1:50:20.540]  But yes, we'll end up getting him here on the show for you
[1:50:20.540 --> 1:50:22.540]  I mean, look, we can't do it all, man
[1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:24.540]  There's lots of what I want to do
[1:50:24.540 --> 1:50:27.540]  And then by the time I get on air
[1:50:27.540 --> 1:50:29.540]  There's just so much
[1:50:29.540 --> 1:50:31.540]  You see what I'm saying?
[1:50:31.540 --> 1:50:33.540]  Yes, no, I'm not blaming you
[1:50:33.540 --> 1:50:35.540]  I'm just saying it's so urgent
[1:50:35.540 --> 1:50:39.540]  Outside of that, this is some dangerous times
[1:50:39.540 --> 1:50:42.540]  And also, there's some news that just came out
[1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:43.540]  It says that...
[1:50:43.540 --> 1:50:45.540]  I think this is in California
[1:50:45.540 --> 1:50:47.540]  In El Segundo, I think
[1:50:47.540 --> 1:50:50.540]  It says that Chevron got away with
[1:50:50.540 --> 1:50:52.540]  Not paying millions of their taxes
[1:50:52.540 --> 1:50:54.540]  None of the rich pay tax
[1:50:54.540 --> 1:50:56.540]  They lobby to get higher taxes on you
[1:50:56.540 --> 1:50:58.540]  And then it gets paid to them and government contracts
[1:50:58.540 --> 1:51:00.540]  That's how it all works
[1:51:00.540 --> 1:51:01.540]  That's the New World Order
[1:51:01.540 --> 1:51:02.540]  You don't need me to tell you
[1:51:02.540 --> 1:51:05.540]  That humanity is in a deep crisis
[1:51:05.540 --> 1:51:06.540]  Everyone can feel it
[1:51:06.540 --> 1:51:09.540]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place
[1:51:09.540 --> 1:51:11.540]  Between the forces of freedom
[1:51:11.540 --> 1:51:15.540]  And those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement
[1:51:15.540 --> 1:51:18.540]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising
[1:51:18.540 --> 1:51:20.540]  But take heart for every action
[1:51:20.540 --> 1:51:23.540]  There is an equal and opposite reaction
[1:51:23.540 --> 1:51:26.540]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted
[1:51:26.540 --> 1:51:28.540]  They're losing the Info War
[1:51:28.540 --> 1:51:30.540]  We are in an information war
[1:51:30.540 --> 1:51:32.540]  And we are losing that war
[1:51:32.540 --> 1:51:34.540]  The globalists are scared
[1:51:34.540 --> 1:51:35.540]  They've overreached
[1:51:35.540 --> 1:51:39.540]  The future of the Info War is in your hands

[1:54:31.540 --> 1:54:34.540]  So I can show folks this with a document cam shot
[1:54:34.540 --> 1:54:38.540]  If they're watching on prisonplanet.tv
[1:54:38.540 --> 1:54:42.540]  The news is getting so hectic, everything's getting so crazy
[1:54:42.540 --> 1:54:46.540]  That I don't even plug sponsors or books or videos on air
[1:54:46.540 --> 1:54:50.540]  You listen to other talk shows, every five minutes they're plugging this sponsor, that sponsor
[1:54:50.540 --> 1:54:53.540]  This book, that video
[1:54:53.540 --> 1:54:55.540]  You don't really even hear me do that anymore
[1:54:55.540 --> 1:54:59.540]  And then we lose revenue and can't fund this operation
[1:54:59.540 --> 1:55:03.540]  So when you buy books, when you buy videos, when you buy materials from us
[1:55:03.540 --> 1:55:07.540]  You not only get tools that will help wake people up
[1:55:07.540 --> 1:55:15.540]  But you also, in a big, big way, fund our operation
[1:55:15.540 --> 1:55:18.540]  I mean, you don't have to be out there risking your life
[1:55:18.540 --> 1:55:20.540]  Because you're not prominent enough for that to happen
[1:55:20.540 --> 1:55:23.540]  They want this idea that you're all in danger, you're all scared
[1:55:23.540 --> 1:55:25.540]  Your bureaucrats will threaten you
[1:55:25.540 --> 1:55:27.540]  Look, they're not going to kill you at the level you're at
[1:55:27.540 --> 1:55:30.540]  You start getting to my level, Breitbart's level, stuff like that
[1:55:30.540 --> 1:55:34.540]  That's when you got to worry, Matt Drudge, look out
[1:55:34.540 --> 1:55:38.540]  Because he can set the agenda, he's under government surveillance, that's admitted, that's been in Congress
[1:55:38.540 --> 1:55:43.540]  They do not like the fact that he can expose the TSA, the naked body scanners
[1:55:43.540 --> 1:55:45.540]  Bilderberg, they don't like it
[1:55:45.540 --> 1:55:48.540]  They don't like the fact that no one believes them anymore
[1:55:48.540 --> 1:55:55.540]  They don't like the fact that the alternative media has taken over
[1:55:55.540 --> 1:55:57.540]  And they're panicking
[1:55:57.540 --> 1:56:02.540]  So I want to just point out, people, we're at a critical juncture right now
[1:56:02.540 --> 1:56:06.540]  So please support our sponsors, please buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts
[1:56:06.540 --> 1:56:08.540]  And be part of the Info Wars Army to wake up America
[1:56:08.540 --> 1:56:11.540]  You start wearing a t-shirt, an infowars.com t-shirt
[1:56:11.540 --> 1:56:13.540]  You're going to meet like-minded people
[1:56:13.540 --> 1:56:16.540]  Now I want to show folks on the document camera, they're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv
[1:56:16.540 --> 1:56:19.540]  Do not just go to infowars.com and click on the store link
[1:56:19.540 --> 1:56:21.540]  We are doing something at cost
[1:56:21.540 --> 1:56:24.540]  And because the shopping cart is designed, it has to have money in it
[1:56:24.540 --> 1:56:26.540]  It just has to have some type of purchase
[1:56:26.540 --> 1:56:29.540]  It's one pinning, and then you pay for the shipping and handling
[1:56:29.540 --> 1:56:33.540]  But it is at cost, it's not like the vitamin things where you just pay for shipping and handling
[1:56:33.540 --> 1:56:35.540]  And the shipping and handling is $20
[1:56:35.540 --> 1:56:38.540]  It's, what is it, $5.95?
[1:56:38.540 --> 1:56:41.540]  In fact, I forget, it's up on the side, I meant to have that pulled up
[1:56:41.540 --> 1:56:43.540]  We go to the shopping cart and show people
[1:56:43.540 --> 1:56:46.540]  This is what it costs me, because you get a couple hundred
[1:56:46.540 --> 1:56:51.540]  Of the, you are the resistance, infowars.com
[1:56:51.540 --> 1:56:53.540]  Business cards, color business cards
[1:56:53.540 --> 1:56:56.540]  That have the websites on the back and you are the resistance on the front
[1:56:56.540 --> 1:56:58.540]  A citizen rule book
[1:56:58.540 --> 1:57:01.540]  It's got the Declaration of Independence, Pillar Rights, Constitution
[1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:04.540]  All in it
[1:57:04.540 --> 1:57:06.540]  If you guys want it, you just go to the shopping cart
[1:57:06.540 --> 1:57:09.540]  And you go to the front page and it'll be right there as top items
[1:57:09.540 --> 1:57:11.540]  In fact, I can just show people right now
[1:57:11.540 --> 1:57:13.540]  How much?
[1:57:13.540 --> 1:57:16.540]  $4.95, so less than I thought
[1:57:16.540 --> 1:57:20.540]  $4.95, and they calculated this where it is at cost
[1:57:20.540 --> 1:57:24.540]  At cost, two bumper stickers
[1:57:24.540 --> 1:57:27.540]  A couple hundred cards, it's a couple hundred, no, it's a hundred
[1:57:27.540 --> 1:57:31.540]  Again, I end up not doing plugs for things
[1:57:31.540 --> 1:57:33.540]  And then never even intending to plug it
[1:57:33.540 --> 1:57:35.540]  And then I'm here just half cocked
[1:57:35.540 --> 1:57:37.540]  Not even knowing what I'm promoting here
[1:57:37.540 --> 1:57:40.540]  I just came up with this plan a few weeks ago to get the word out
[1:57:40.540 --> 1:57:44.540]  So again, we've got the cards printed up
[1:57:44.540 --> 1:57:47.540]  We've got a hundred cards, a citizen rule book
[1:57:47.540 --> 1:57:49.540]  Two bumper stickers, $4.95
[1:57:49.540 --> 1:57:53.540]  That is, at cost, a great little Info Wars weapons package
[1:57:53.540 --> 1:57:56.540]  And we extended it until the end of Sunday
[1:57:56.540 --> 1:57:58.540]  And then it is over until next Christmas
[1:57:58.540 --> 1:57:59.540]  Because it's been so popular
[1:57:59.540 --> 1:58:04.540]  All of my films, all of my films, all of my films
[1:58:04.540 --> 1:58:08.540]  All 18 of my films and Jason Burmes' Invisible Empire New Order Defined
[1:58:08.540 --> 1:58:11.540]  Citizen rule book, bumper stickers, all of it
[1:58:11.540 --> 1:58:15.540]  For $99.95, normally $380 smackers
[1:58:15.540 --> 1:58:17.540]  So that will run through the weekend
[1:58:17.540 --> 1:58:19.540]  So gas, my BFG2 bomber
[1:58:19.540 --> 1:58:21.540]  I'm going to take off and bomb the globalist again
[1:58:21.540 --> 1:58:23.540]  But even the gas you give us
[1:58:23.540 --> 1:58:26.540]  You get Info Weapon bombs back as well
[1:58:26.540 --> 1:58:29.540]  It's just symbiotic, figure eight, eternity of resistance
[1:58:29.540 --> 1:58:33.540]  Infinity of resistance, all of it at InfoWars.com
[1:58:33.540 --> 1:58:35.540]  Get in there, refuel our tanks big time
[1:58:35.540 --> 1:58:37.540]  All your purchases are basically donations
[1:58:37.540 --> 1:58:39.540]  Right to the front line of the InfoWars
[1:59:08.540 --> 1:59:12.540]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[1:59:12.540 --> 1:59:14.540]  That contain no useless dyes
[1:59:14.540 --> 1:59:17.540]  Perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials
[1:59:17.540 --> 1:59:20.540]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[1:59:20.540 --> 1:59:23.540]  That give you rashes, itching sores
[1:59:23.540 --> 1:59:25.540]  And deteriorating clothing called lint
[1:59:25.540 --> 1:59:26.540]  If you want something better
[1:59:26.540 --> 1:59:28.540]  If you want something you've never had before
[1:59:28.540 --> 1:59:30.540]  You've had to do something you've never done before
[1:59:30.540 --> 1:59:32.540]  Getting a free catalog is easy
[1:59:32.540 --> 1:59:35.540]  By calling 800-340-7091
[1:59:35.540 --> 1:59:38.540]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com
[1:59:38.540 --> 1:59:40.540]  Take charge of your health now
[1:59:40.540 --> 1:59:43.540]  By calling 800-340-7091
[1:59:43.540 --> 2:00:06.540]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com
[2:00:13.540 --> 2:00:17.540]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[2:00:17.540 --> 2:00:22.540]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[2:00:22.540 --> 2:00:27.540]  All right, Bob Chapman of theInternationalForecaster.com
[2:00:27.540 --> 2:00:29.540]  Always an invaluable analyst joins us
[2:00:29.540 --> 2:00:31.540]  Then Jerome Corsi is going to be popping in
[2:00:31.540 --> 2:00:33.540]  To give us his take on Andrew Breitbart
[2:00:33.540 --> 2:00:38.540]  And on Sheriff Arpaio saying the birth certificate is a forgery
[2:00:38.540 --> 2:00:40.540]  That's professional, forensics department
[2:00:40.540 --> 2:00:43.540]  He's got a big sheriff's department there in Phoenix
[2:00:43.540 --> 2:00:45.540]  And they came out and went over the same evidence
[2:00:45.540 --> 2:00:47.540]  We showed you back when this broke last year
[2:00:47.540 --> 2:00:49.540]  But I want to get into the economy right now
[2:00:49.540 --> 2:00:52.540]  And then get Bob Chapman, who was in intelligence
[2:00:52.540 --> 2:00:55.540]  They've tried to kill him before on Breitbart
[2:00:55.540 --> 2:00:57.540]  Who said he was going to release the video
[2:00:57.540 --> 2:00:59.540]  Of Obama in communist meetings
[2:00:59.540 --> 2:01:01.540]  And, quote, destroy him
[2:01:01.540 --> 2:01:05.540]  He was going to release it yesterday, he died that night
[2:01:05.540 --> 2:01:08.540]  After going to a restaurant and having two glasses of wine
[2:01:08.540 --> 2:01:09.540]  Very suspicious
[2:01:09.540 --> 2:01:11.540]  But Bob, what do you make of Bernaki saying
[2:01:11.540 --> 2:01:13.540]  Everything's wonderful, we're not going to have QE3
[2:01:13.540 --> 2:01:15.540]  Now admitting this week in a speech
[2:01:15.540 --> 2:01:18.540]  The Associated Press ran with it
[2:01:18.540 --> 2:01:22.540]  That, hey, we're at the edge of a financial cliff
[2:01:22.540 --> 2:01:25.540]  Yeah, who took us to that cliff? Bob Chapman
[2:01:25.540 --> 2:01:28.540]  Well, it certainly wasn't me
[2:01:28.540 --> 2:01:33.540]  That said, I think the sterling part
[2:01:33.540 --> 2:01:36.540]  Of the interviews with Congress this week
[2:01:36.540 --> 2:01:40.540]  Was Ron Paul holding up the Silver Eagle
[2:01:40.540 --> 2:01:44.540]  You know, like, this is real money and you're a liar
[2:01:44.540 --> 2:01:47.540]  And, you know, that's a real precedent
[2:01:47.540 --> 2:01:51.540]  And what happens to liars is that
[2:01:51.540 --> 2:01:54.540]  And I found this out when I was a little kid
[2:01:54.540 --> 2:01:56.540]  You keep on telling lies and you get a count
[2:01:56.540 --> 2:01:59.540]  Ten new ones that cover the one old one
[2:01:59.540 --> 2:02:03.540]  And after a while it grows like topsy and you can't handle it
[2:02:03.540 --> 2:02:07.540]  This is a position that Bernaki and many others are in government today
[2:02:07.540 --> 2:02:12.540]  Because now there are people saying things like Ron Paul did
[2:02:12.540 --> 2:02:17.540]  In reference to Mr. Breitbart
[2:02:17.540 --> 2:02:20.540]  Very simply, that's why I don't live there
[2:02:20.540 --> 2:02:23.540]  You come up with things like that and you never know
[2:02:23.540 --> 2:02:25.540]  Whether they're going to decide to whack you
[2:02:25.540 --> 2:02:28.540]  And it's pretty obvious, I mean, I didn't know that
[2:02:28.540 --> 2:02:31.540]  The man had anything wrong with him
[2:02:31.540 --> 2:02:35.540]  So with that said, he probably went in the restaurant
[2:02:35.540 --> 2:02:38.540]  They know he went there, perhaps because he liked the place
[2:02:38.540 --> 2:02:41.540]  No, he went there all the time, he lived right down the street
[2:02:41.540 --> 2:02:43.540]  He went there all the time
[2:02:43.540 --> 2:02:47.540]  So they had somebody inside put something in the drink and dead he is
[2:02:47.540 --> 2:02:49.540]  And of course, that idiot's going to get killed
[2:02:49.540 --> 2:02:52.540]  I mean, anybody who knows about hit men in history
[2:02:52.540 --> 2:02:55.540]  Big hits, they always kill the hit man
[2:02:55.540 --> 2:02:58.540]  If you're killing just some low level person, they're not going to kill you
[2:02:58.540 --> 2:03:01.540]  When you're killing major media figures and it's political
[2:03:01.540 --> 2:03:06.540]  They're probably going to kill whoever was dumb enough to do the job
[2:03:06.540 --> 2:03:09.540]  That's probably true as well
[2:03:09.540 --> 2:03:13.540]  Although sometimes it is and it all depends on the situation
[2:03:13.540 --> 2:03:17.540]  There's probably a hit man to the CIA working in the United States
[2:03:17.540 --> 2:03:19.540]  As we all well know now
[2:03:19.540 --> 2:03:22.540]  Which is not something that went on years ago
[2:03:22.540 --> 2:03:25.540]  But it shows you what happens when you speak up
[2:03:25.540 --> 2:03:29.540]  You're going to be very careful and you can't speak up
[2:03:29.540 --> 2:03:33.540]  And think you're going to get away with it with somebody like the president
[2:03:33.540 --> 2:03:38.540]  We're going to show you pictures of our dear friend, the president of the United States
[2:03:38.540 --> 2:03:41.540]  At Communist Party meetings
[2:03:41.540 --> 2:03:47.540]  It's just like the picture of Martin Luther King at a Communist Party meeting
[2:03:47.540 --> 2:03:54.540]  It never left him, it was at his side following him all the way through his career
[2:03:54.540 --> 2:03:56.540]  He used that to blackmail Obama
[2:03:56.540 --> 2:03:59.540]  That's undoubtedly going on and that's why he's so bad
[2:03:59.540 --> 2:04:04.540]  He's a puppet, but he is a totally blackmailed puppet
[2:04:04.540 --> 2:04:06.540]  Well, I think you're right about that
[2:04:06.540 --> 2:04:11.540]  And I think Mr. Arapeo's move in the position he's in
[2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:19.540]  Which is very, very important because he is professional people who have looked at the situation
[2:04:19.540 --> 2:04:22.540]  And said, no, this isn't real
[2:04:22.540 --> 2:04:28.540]  And so now we have a prominent, if not controversial person
[2:04:28.540 --> 2:04:32.540]  Who likes to speak and likes to talk
[2:04:32.540 --> 2:04:36.540]  He's up front there and he's going to take them on
[2:04:36.540 --> 2:04:39.540]  Yeah, if I was Arapeo, I'd be watching it
[2:04:39.540 --> 2:04:42.540]  And we know there's been attempts on him from the grapevine, I've been told
[2:04:42.540 --> 2:04:47.540]  Stay there, just a few months after Arapeo said he would investigate
[2:04:47.540 --> 2:04:50.540]  Because the state house was looking at it in Arizona
[2:04:50.540 --> 2:04:53.540]  And they've upgraded him over civil rights violations
[2:04:53.540 --> 2:04:56.540]  I mean, if there's no proof to it, why are they trying to set him up?
[2:04:56.540 --> 2:04:59.540]  Again, their response is the proof of the guilt
[2:04:59.540 --> 2:05:28.540]  We'll be right back
[2:05:29.540 --> 2:05:31.540]  We'll be right back
[2:06:00.540 --> 2:06:03.540]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones
[2:06:03.540 --> 2:06:06.540]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings
[2:06:06.540 --> 2:06:08.540]  Opportunity and recognized risk
[2:06:08.540 --> 2:06:10.540]  Saving means to make money
[2:06:10.540 --> 2:06:13.540]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars
[2:06:13.540 --> 2:06:15.540]  And give you good old-fashioned real soaps
[2:06:15.540 --> 2:06:19.540]  That are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now
[2:06:19.540 --> 2:06:22.540]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[2:06:22.540 --> 2:06:24.540]  That contain no useless dyes
[2:06:24.540 --> 2:06:27.540]  Perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials
[2:06:27.540 --> 2:06:30.540]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[2:06:30.540 --> 2:06:33.540]  That give you rashes, itching sores
[2:06:33.540 --> 2:06:35.540]  And a tolerating clothing called lint
[2:06:35.540 --> 2:06:38.540]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before
[2:06:38.540 --> 2:06:40.540]  You've had to do something you've never done before
[2:06:40.540 --> 2:06:42.540]  Getting a free catalog is easy

[2:08:02.540 --> 2:08:06.540]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines
[2:08:06.540 --> 2:08:08.540]  The Information War continues
[2:08:08.540 --> 2:08:12.540]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:08:12.540 --> 2:08:18.540]  All right, we've got callers from Oregon, Pennsylvania, Ohio, the UK, Maryland
[2:08:18.540 --> 2:08:21.540]  We'll go to you with Bob Chapman of internationalforecaster.com
[2:08:21.540 --> 2:08:23.540]  News has been breaking, I've been out of town
[2:08:23.540 --> 2:08:25.540]  He hasn't been with us in about two weeks
[2:08:25.540 --> 2:08:29.540]  And we've only got him for 30 minutes because I got to get coursing on in the last 30
[2:08:29.540 --> 2:08:31.540]  And we really appreciate Bob joining us
[2:08:31.540 --> 2:08:35.540]  Bob, recapping the economy, then I want to go back into Breitbart
[2:08:35.540 --> 2:08:36.540]  What that signifies for you
[2:08:36.540 --> 2:08:41.540]  But how big of a deal is it that Ron Paul is now saying you're a liar, Bernanke
[2:08:41.540 --> 2:08:46.540]  Stop making fun of people that are concerned about inflation, you know it's higher
[2:08:46.540 --> 2:08:51.540]  The fact that they're so disrespected, the fact that Brzezinski's new book says
[2:08:51.540 --> 2:08:54.540]  The number one issue facing the elite is we don't trust him anymore
[2:08:54.540 --> 2:08:59.540]  And of course he says in the book, I was reading this quote last night, it blew me away
[2:08:59.540 --> 2:09:07.540]  He was saying that 20 years ago it was easier to control a million people than it was to kill them
[2:09:07.540 --> 2:09:09.540]  Now it's easier just to kill them than to control them
[2:09:09.540 --> 2:09:12.540]  And he's not saying it's easy to kill us, that's hard
[2:09:12.540 --> 2:09:16.540]  He's saying it's impossible to get them to buy our bull anymore
[2:09:16.540 --> 2:09:21.540]  So they've lost the info war, so that's why they're suddenly arming to the teeth against us
[2:09:21.540 --> 2:09:23.540]  But that's not going to work
[2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:27.540]  I mean, look at Europe when they suck everything dry, the police are turning against them
[2:09:27.540 --> 2:09:31.540]  The firemen, the bureaucrats, this is a nasty system
[2:09:31.540 --> 2:09:34.540]  And now the oil prices are exploding
[2:09:34.540 --> 2:09:38.540]  Now the Federal Reserve is in trouble
[2:09:38.540 --> 2:09:42.540]  The world government's being announced, but we were there exposing it beforehand
[2:09:42.540 --> 2:09:45.540]  So people know it's not just some new solution they thought up
[2:09:45.540 --> 2:09:49.540]  Where do you see the world right now, Bob Chapman?
[2:09:49.540 --> 2:09:54.540]  Well, I think the situation with Ron Paul, as you asked earlier
[2:09:54.540 --> 2:10:00.540]  Is that people are starting in prominent places to speak out
[2:10:00.540 --> 2:10:04.540]  In very plain English, Mr. Bernanke, you're a liar
[2:10:04.540 --> 2:10:09.540]  I mean, that's enough to fool anybody, I've never seen anything like that happen in the House or Senate before
[2:10:09.540 --> 2:10:15.540]  There's all kinds of rules that you must be nice to them and ask them tough questions occasionally
[2:10:15.540 --> 2:10:18.540]  So I think that's a turning point
[2:10:18.540 --> 2:10:23.540]  You and I have been watching Brzezinski very closely for some years
[2:10:23.540 --> 2:10:27.540]  And yes, you're right, they're terrified, they don't know what to do
[2:10:27.540 --> 2:10:34.540]  And then on top of the tremendous amount of money that's being put into the system
[2:10:34.540 --> 2:10:39.540]  We have a system in Europe, which is the European Central Bank
[2:10:39.540 --> 2:10:44.540]  Borrowing almost $1.4 trillion on the Federal Reserve
[2:10:44.540 --> 2:10:46.540]  They're crazy
[2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:50.540]  Now that's going to last about a year and a half and it's going to come unglued again
[2:10:50.540 --> 2:10:54.540]  What are they going to do? Another $1.4 trillion? Probably
[2:10:54.540 --> 2:10:57.540]  And that means there's going to be lots of inflation
[2:10:57.540 --> 2:11:02.540]  And that means people are going to be very unhappy and gold and silver are going to go up
[2:11:02.540 --> 2:11:06.540]  And just to be clear what Bob's talking about
[2:11:06.540 --> 2:11:13.540]  Ron Paul tells Bernanke he killed the dollar, that's Forbes, and in there he called him a liar
[2:11:13.540 --> 2:11:17.540]  We haven't even played that clip, we linked to it a few days ago at infowars.com
[2:11:17.540 --> 2:11:23.540]  But the gloves are coming off
[2:11:23.540 --> 2:11:30.540]  And then to attack Ron Paul, they put out this meme that he's working with Mitt Romney
[2:11:30.540 --> 2:11:34.540]  And that he's never run an ad against Mitt Romney, I went and looked
[2:11:34.540 --> 2:11:38.540]  And Steve Watts wrote an article about it, he's run three different ad packages against Romney
[2:11:38.540 --> 2:11:43.540]  And spent over a third of his attack ad money on Romney in the last six months
[2:11:43.540 --> 2:11:46.540]  And has been running ads for two weeks against Romney
[2:11:46.540 --> 2:11:49.540]  It's just all a hoax
[2:11:49.540 --> 2:11:54.540]  It's just more lies and lies and lies, and you can expect it ladies and gentlemen
[2:11:54.540 --> 2:11:57.540]  So look at everything on both sides
[2:11:57.540 --> 2:12:07.540]  Today we're looking at Senator Kerry and Graham talking about how the Saudis they thought were involved in 9-11
[2:12:07.540 --> 2:12:13.540]  Now I don't have any inside information, I don't know exactly what's going on
[2:12:13.540 --> 2:12:16.540]  But it looks like they're setting the Saudis up
[2:12:16.540 --> 2:12:21.540]  So you can put that in the back of your mental chamber and let's see what happens
[2:12:21.540 --> 2:12:24.540]  But there's no reason whatsoever for them to do what they've done
[2:12:24.540 --> 2:12:30.540]  In supposedly exposing the possibility that Saudi Arabia was in on 9-11
[2:12:30.540 --> 2:12:32.540]  Or maybe they were
[2:12:32.540 --> 2:12:35.540]  Well of course they were working with the west to supply the Patsies
[2:12:35.540 --> 2:12:38.540]  And that's why 15-19 came from there
[2:12:38.540 --> 2:12:41.540]  And the head of the U.S. Embassy was ordered to let the hijackers in
[2:12:41.540 --> 2:12:44.540]  But it was our criminal government running it as well
[2:12:44.540 --> 2:12:49.540]  But again, the word is they do plan to double-cross Saudi Arabia
[2:12:49.540 --> 2:12:54.540]  And I think this speaks volumes to it
[2:12:54.540 --> 2:12:57.540]  I had to shove that in there because it's very important
[2:12:57.540 --> 2:13:02.540]  Because you know, if we're going to take down Saudi, the whole Middle East is coming down
[2:13:02.540 --> 2:13:06.540]  Let me ask you this question, well that's what Lindsay Williams says his old company told him
[2:13:06.540 --> 2:13:10.540]  He said two years ago he's going to start in the Middle East, the Saudis will be last
[2:13:10.540 --> 2:13:14.540]  And sure enough it's happening and oil's going up like he said a little bit later than he said
[2:13:14.540 --> 2:13:17.540]  Oil leaps to highest level since mid-08
[2:13:17.540 --> 2:13:20.540]  Let's expand on that though, getting back to Breitbart
[2:13:20.540 --> 2:13:24.540]  Look, they say he had some heart problems before
[2:13:24.540 --> 2:13:27.540]  Okay fine, 43 people do have heart attacks at that age
[2:13:27.540 --> 2:13:33.540]  He says, I'm going to get you Obama, I've got video you in college with your commie friends
[2:13:33.540 --> 2:13:37.540]  Now we've dug up other quotes last week where he said it's them with terrorists
[2:13:37.540 --> 2:13:40.540]  That's him at communist meetings, this is going to destroy him
[2:13:40.540 --> 2:13:44.540]  That's our story, it's now up at Drudge Top, one of the top stories on the web
[2:13:44.540 --> 2:13:48.540]  It says number six on Alexa, we'll check, it'll probably be number one soon
[2:13:48.540 --> 2:13:54.540]  We've had that a few times, the point is the number of people killed by government is well known
[2:13:54.540 --> 2:13:57.540]  The fact that they have systems to give you heart attacks is well known
[2:13:57.540 --> 2:14:01.540]  The fact that he goes to this neighborhood bar, he goes to routinely
[2:14:01.540 --> 2:14:04.540]  Drinks two glasses of wine over two hours, was not drunk
[2:14:04.540 --> 2:14:07.540]  Look, completely normal, people were there and talked to him
[2:14:07.540 --> 2:14:11.540]  He had long political conversations, said I'm going to bed, leaves right at midnight
[2:14:11.540 --> 2:14:16.540]  And drops, pretty much drops dead on the street, goes into cardiac arrest they say
[2:14:16.540 --> 2:14:21.540]  Then they're not sure, goes to the hospital, and within two hours they already are saying
[2:14:21.540 --> 2:14:24.540]  It's a heart attack and natural causes when they never do that
[2:14:24.540 --> 2:14:27.540]  With Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, it takes a week at least
[2:14:27.540 --> 2:14:31.540]  So we've got all that going on, and it's the fact that they were saying
[2:14:31.540 --> 2:14:37.540]  How he died within a few hours is the fact that they were trying to get ahead of the story that he was killed
[2:14:37.540 --> 2:14:42.540]  That for me is a big smoking gun, but then Bob, he was going to release the video we now learn
[2:14:42.540 --> 2:14:49.540]  This is confirmed, he was going to release the video March 1st, the hours before he's killed
[2:14:49.540 --> 2:14:54.540]  So he's killed in the early morning hour specific time of March 1st
[2:14:54.540 --> 2:14:58.540]  The day he was going to go public and release it and was all excited
[2:14:58.540 --> 2:15:02.540]  I mean, the chances of that, Bob, what do you say to that?
[2:15:02.540 --> 2:15:04.540]  A million to one
[2:15:04.540 --> 2:15:12.540]  The big question is, is there more than one copy of the video, and who has them?
[2:15:12.540 --> 2:15:17.540]  Well, he was going to release it that day, and I said yesterday, if the Breitbart people come out and say
[2:15:17.540 --> 2:15:21.540]  We'll release it in a few weeks, you know, they've been told to go edit it and cut certain stuff out
[2:15:21.540 --> 2:15:24.540]  Not a good sign they're announcing it's going to be in a few weeks now
[2:15:24.540 --> 2:15:26.540]  Why wasn't it released yesterday?
[2:15:26.540 --> 2:15:32.540]  Why isn't it being released now when he's the biggest story out there?
[2:15:32.540 --> 2:15:35.540]  That's business time
[2:15:35.540 --> 2:15:36.540]  I will tell you
[2:15:36.540 --> 2:15:38.540]  I just don't know
[2:15:38.540 --> 2:15:44.540]  I will tell you behind the scenes, people very close to him are saying that they're gut as he was killed
[2:15:44.540 --> 2:15:46.540]  Michael Savage has said that too
[2:15:46.540 --> 2:15:51.540]  And Michael Savage, I know from insiders, has bodyguards and broadcasts from like six different locations
[2:15:51.540 --> 2:15:53.540]  And literally thinks they're trying to kill him
[2:15:53.540 --> 2:15:56.540]  That's what they do this month ago and then again weeks ago
[2:15:56.540 --> 2:16:01.540]  That Michael Savage is in hiding right now
[2:16:01.540 --> 2:16:03.540]  Well, that's understandable
[2:16:03.540 --> 2:16:10.540]  And that's what I'm doing as well
[2:16:10.540 --> 2:16:11.540]  I'll tell you
[2:16:11.540 --> 2:16:14.540]  I know how these people act, you know, I used to work for them
[2:16:14.540 --> 2:16:18.540]  And I don't have to be told twice about something
[2:16:18.540 --> 2:16:23.540]  I'm not dumb
[2:16:23.540 --> 2:16:25.540]  What did they say we're going to kill you?
[2:16:25.540 --> 2:16:28.540]  Oh, yeah
[2:16:28.540 --> 2:16:29.540]  Absolutely
[2:16:29.540 --> 2:16:32.540]  I've been threatening a lot, I guess I'm just...
[2:16:32.540 --> 2:16:35.540]  I don't know what it is, Bob, it's just that if they kill me, they kill me
[2:16:35.540 --> 2:16:37.540]  I don't know how to explain it, I'm not worried about it
[2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:40.540]  I love life, but I just...
[2:16:40.540 --> 2:16:43.540]  Man, getting killed in the service of liberty, that's kind of cool
[2:16:43.540 --> 2:16:48.540]  I do the same thing, look at what I'm doing at 77 years old for goodness sake
[2:16:48.540 --> 2:16:51.540]  And why?
[2:16:51.540 --> 2:16:53.540]  Because they care about other people, just like you do
[2:16:53.540 --> 2:16:55.540]  And many of the other people out there
[2:16:55.540 --> 2:16:58.540]  And so we keep on giving it to them
[2:16:58.540 --> 2:17:00.540]  And if we get killed, we get killed
[2:17:00.540 --> 2:17:02.540]  It's the price we have to pay
[2:17:02.540 --> 2:17:06.540]  Well, I don't blame you, they tried to set you up, tried to plant hand grenades on you
[2:17:06.540 --> 2:17:10.540]  I mean, I know that I think if there's much stuff happening to me as you
[2:17:10.540 --> 2:17:13.540]  I might leave the country, but I just still...
[2:17:13.540 --> 2:17:15.540]  I don't know, it's kind of exciting
[2:17:15.540 --> 2:17:19.540]  I guess I'm like a moth to flame, I'm just not worried about it
[2:17:19.540 --> 2:17:25.540]  You know, Alex, if I wanted you, they would have done it already
[2:17:25.540 --> 2:17:28.540]  Well, that's what I've said over and over again
[2:17:28.540 --> 2:17:32.540]  You're such a thorn in their side
[2:17:32.540 --> 2:17:35.540]  That it just goes without saying
[2:17:35.540 --> 2:17:40.540]  I think you've built up some kind of immunity that we just don't quite understand yet
[2:17:40.540 --> 2:17:45.540]  Well, I think what it is, is I mainly just analyze stuff that's already out there
[2:17:45.540 --> 2:17:50.540]  What I've seen people get killed over is when they have a particular breaking smoking gun
[2:17:50.540 --> 2:17:55.540]  DC Madame, Breitbart, Vince Foster, that's when they kill you
[2:17:55.540 --> 2:18:01.540]  When you're prominent and have the information that can bring them down, that's why they come after you
[2:18:01.540 --> 2:18:04.540]  That's right
[2:18:04.540 --> 2:18:08.540]  It's just like pointing a gun at them and daring them to shoot back
[2:18:08.540 --> 2:18:12.540]  Yeah, I mean, I never act wild and crazy on purpose either
[2:18:12.540 --> 2:18:14.540]  That's just who I am, and I think there's kind of that crazy factor
[2:18:14.540 --> 2:18:18.540]  Like the Native Americans thought the wild guy was like holy or whatever
[2:18:18.540 --> 2:18:22.540]  But I think the biggest thing is highlighting, underlining
[2:18:22.540 --> 2:18:25.540]  If they kill me, it highlights and underlines everything I've said, Bob
[2:18:25.540 --> 2:18:31.540]  My work is so prolific and so on target that if they kill me, they know it'll create a cult
[2:18:31.540 --> 2:18:35.540]  And I think that's why I'm not dead. I think they learned that when they kill people
[2:18:35.540 --> 2:18:37.540]  Just because they don't like what they're saying, it backfires
[2:18:37.540 --> 2:18:41.540]  But I think they had to kill Breitbart because he said, I'm bringing you down, Obama
[2:18:41.540 --> 2:18:45.540]  I got you at the commie meetings where they were discussing reeducation and arresting America
[2:18:45.540 --> 2:18:48.540]  And overthrowing the government
[2:18:48.540 --> 2:18:52.540]  And people think I'm wild, I mean, he was in their face, man
[2:18:52.540 --> 2:18:57.540]  They were scared of him. He took upwards of 8 billion a year away from Acorn Bob
[2:18:57.540 --> 2:19:02.540]  It might not even have been Obama. Think of all those mob groups that lost that money
[2:19:04.540 --> 2:19:08.540]  You're absolutely right. And you're right about yourself, too
[2:19:08.540 --> 2:19:12.540]  In relation to government and those who control government
[2:19:12.540 --> 2:19:17.540]  But, you know, there's so many things going on out there
[2:19:17.540 --> 2:19:21.540]  We talk about Iran and Syria and now Saudi Arabia
[2:19:21.540 --> 2:19:27.540]  And the stories about the finances of both the United States and England and Europe
[2:19:27.540 --> 2:19:31.540]  And, you know, they keep on crashing down this path
[2:19:31.540 --> 2:19:36.540]  And it brings you back to Brzezinski. They don't know what to do
[2:19:36.540 --> 2:19:42.540]  They're absolutely totally befuddled because of talk radio on the internet
[2:19:42.540 --> 2:19:46.540]  And we've said this so many times, we're killing them
[2:19:46.540 --> 2:19:49.540]  Yeah, and Breitbart was really killing them
[2:19:49.540 --> 2:19:52.540]  And so, because he was exposing all their mafia stuff, they just whacked him
[2:19:52.540 --> 2:19:57.540]  I mean, that's it. He should have used the material without bragging about it
[2:19:57.540 --> 2:20:00.540]  That's what got him killed. I'm sure they killed him
[2:20:00.540 --> 2:20:20.540]  After I'd backstay with us
[2:20:31.540 --> 2:20:35.540]  We need your help to spread the word like never before
[2:20:35.540 --> 2:20:38.540]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle
[2:20:38.540 --> 2:20:41.540]  Between the forces of freedom and darkness
[2:20:41.540 --> 2:20:45.540]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[2:20:45.540 --> 2:20:49.540]  And their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[2:20:49.540 --> 2:20:51.540]  And ultimate extermination
[2:20:51.540 --> 2:20:54.540]  The war is here. It's an info war
[2:20:54.540 --> 2:21:00.540]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984
[2:21:00.540 --> 2:21:03.540]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid?
[2:21:03.540 --> 2:21:06.540]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off of your teeth
[2:21:06.540 --> 2:21:09.540]  Both as a vapor and as particles into your body?
[2:21:09.540 --> 2:21:13.540]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally
[2:21:13.540 --> 2:21:17.540]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%
[2:21:17.540 --> 2:21:22.540]  Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function
[2:21:22.540 --> 2:21:27.540]  The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione
[2:21:27.540 --> 2:21:30.540]  The number one super food that helps turn on all 10 trillion cells of your body
[2:21:30.540 --> 2:21:35.540]  To produce glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass fed cows
[2:21:35.540 --> 2:21:38.540]  After investigating most high end whey proteins on the market
[2:21:38.540 --> 2:21:42.540]  Only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete
[2:21:42.540 --> 2:21:47.540]  And in our opinion the most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey
[2:21:47.540 --> 2:21:49.540]  It is one world whey

[2:22:00.540 --> 2:22:03.540]  In the past I've taken a lot of different vitamins
[2:22:03.540 --> 2:22:06.540]  Some through health food stores, some that friends recommend
[2:22:06.540 --> 2:22:09.540]  Colleen talking about her experience with Super Sea Veg
[2:22:09.540 --> 2:22:12.540]  And with the Super Sea Veg I was seeing a lot better results
[2:22:12.540 --> 2:22:18.540]  Super Sea Veg with Vita D and Sea Cal is the most powerful dietary food supplement in the world today
[2:22:18.540 --> 2:22:19.540]  Something else comes close
[2:22:19.540 --> 2:22:23.540]  Super Sea Veg is a whole food that makes me feel good
[2:22:23.540 --> 2:22:25.540]  Think of Super Sea Veg as the un-vitamin
[2:22:25.540 --> 2:22:28.540]  I have taken other things and they just didn't work
[2:22:28.540 --> 2:22:30.540]  This seems to work for me
[2:22:30.540 --> 2:22:33.540]  And Super Sea Veg comes with a 90 day money back guarantee
[2:22:33.540 --> 2:22:39.540]  Store bought vitamins do not have the supplement and the full whole feeling I have from Super Sea Veg

[2:23:37.540 --> 2:23:40.540]  For being sent to a FEMA refugee camp

[2:23:43.540 --> 2:23:45.540]  Have already seen in the last four months

[2:24:25.540 --> 2:24:27.540]  Welcome to Oregon, and then we'll go to Sam in the UK
[2:24:27.540 --> 2:24:29.540]  Mike, go ahead, you're on the air
[2:24:29.540 --> 2:24:30.540]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[2:24:30.540 --> 2:24:31.540]  Pretty good
[2:24:31.540 --> 2:24:33.540]  Thank you for taking my call
[2:24:33.540 --> 2:24:35.540]  So many things to talk about
[2:24:35.540 --> 2:24:40.540]  But first, you know, what would Jesse say your best friend?
[2:24:40.540 --> 2:24:43.540]  Five words, no such thing as a coincidence
[2:24:43.540 --> 2:24:48.540]  And I believe, you know, that to be very true in this case
[2:24:48.540 --> 2:24:51.540]  About Brian Bart or Brian Bart
[2:24:51.540 --> 2:24:53.540]  You know, this whole world's a stage
[2:24:53.540 --> 2:24:58.540]  And, you know, we're pointing out all these problems at the top
[2:24:58.540 --> 2:25:02.540]  But I think the real solution to these problems is
[2:25:02.540 --> 2:25:05.540]  You know, within our individual communities
[2:25:05.540 --> 2:25:07.540]  You know, the people are awakening
[2:25:07.540 --> 2:25:11.540]  And, you know, we're dealing with an incredible system
[2:25:11.540 --> 2:25:14.540]  That has order and a lot of time ahead of us
[2:25:14.540 --> 2:25:16.540]  So we should use their order
[2:25:16.540 --> 2:25:18.540]  And there are already existing rules
[2:25:18.540 --> 2:25:21.540]  Well, I hear you, let me get Bob's take on that
[2:25:21.540 --> 2:25:23.540]  Bob, I see it like this
[2:25:23.540 --> 2:25:25.540]  It's just like the idea of too big to fail
[2:25:25.540 --> 2:25:27.540]  The banks set up the fraud, they get control of the government
[2:25:27.540 --> 2:25:30.540]  They hold us hostage, threatening to take down the system
[2:25:30.540 --> 2:25:31.540]  Even as they do it
[2:25:31.540 --> 2:25:33.540]  Well, it's like the crime
[2:25:33.540 --> 2:25:38.540]  Obama is openly engaging in more just flat out big city mafia
[2:25:38.540 --> 2:25:41.540]  Bid rigging and handing his buddies contracts
[2:25:41.540 --> 2:25:43.540]  And nothing's even built with the money
[2:25:43.540 --> 2:25:45.540]  I mean, it's just all out in the open now
[2:25:45.540 --> 2:25:46.540]  What comes next?
[2:25:46.540 --> 2:25:48.540]  And it's too big to fail
[2:25:48.540 --> 2:25:51.540]  There's such criminality now across the system
[2:25:51.540 --> 2:25:54.540]  That no one can rat out anybody else
[2:25:54.540 --> 2:25:56.540]  And so nobody can say no
[2:25:56.540 --> 2:25:59.540]  And it's like a bunch of weevils eating all the grain
[2:25:59.540 --> 2:26:03.540]  And Breitbart was trying to expose us as they just killed him
[2:26:03.540 --> 2:26:08.540]  I mean, what do you do when the corruption becomes too big to fail?
[2:26:08.540 --> 2:26:10.540]  I think you do what the gentleman said
[2:26:10.540 --> 2:26:14.540]  Work from the bottom up, that's what Joe Rpo is doing
[2:26:14.540 --> 2:26:17.540]  And yes, it's a national issue
[2:26:17.540 --> 2:26:20.540]  But that is from the bottom up
[2:26:20.540 --> 2:26:26.540]  And so let's get more of law enforcement to do such kinds of things
[2:26:26.540 --> 2:26:28.540]  And people have a lot more respect for them
[2:26:28.540 --> 2:26:31.540]  And they'll be a lot happier with them
[2:26:31.540 --> 2:26:34.540]  Exactly, people are going to start liking the police again
[2:26:34.540 --> 2:26:38.540]  When they start actually going after the bad guys, not working for them
[2:26:38.540 --> 2:26:39.540]  That's right
[2:26:39.540 --> 2:26:43.540]  And you can include the CFTC and the SEC in there
[2:26:43.540 --> 2:26:44.540]  Now known as Finnera
[2:26:44.540 --> 2:26:52.540]  You know, six years after they packaged the mortgages into bonds
[2:26:52.540 --> 2:26:57.540]  The rating companies and their conspirators with them
[2:26:57.540 --> 2:27:00.540]  The major firms on Wall Street
[2:27:00.540 --> 2:27:04.540]  Everybody buys these things, 60% of them in Europe
[2:27:04.540 --> 2:27:06.540]  And what happens?
[2:27:06.540 --> 2:27:08.540]  They're not AAA, they're AAAB
[2:27:08.540 --> 2:27:12.540]  The difference between a 10 and a 4 can be invest
[2:27:12.540 --> 2:27:21.540]  Now, the SEC made it quite clear in their investigation of Goldman Sachs
[2:27:21.540 --> 2:27:25.540]  This is only a civil investigation
[2:27:25.540 --> 2:27:30.540]  So all that can happen to you is you get fined, I don't know, maybe a billion dollars
[2:27:30.540 --> 2:27:32.540]  That's because it's all their guys
[2:27:32.540 --> 2:27:34.540]  And the firm pays the fine
[2:27:34.540 --> 2:27:40.540]  It's like the commodities trading investigator was part of the Corazine scam
[2:27:40.540 --> 2:27:42.540]  It's just the mafia runs the country
[2:27:42.540 --> 2:27:44.540]  Let's talk to Sam in the UK
[2:27:44.540 --> 2:27:45.540]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman
[2:27:45.540 --> 2:27:47.540]  Go ahead, Sam
[2:27:47.540 --> 2:27:48.540]  Hey, Alex
[2:27:48.540 --> 2:27:51.540]  I mean, why don't you just release the video, man?
[2:27:51.540 --> 2:27:53.540]  I mean, what's all these playing games?
[2:27:53.540 --> 2:27:56.540]  I mean, you know, why is he announcing that he's going to announce it?
[2:27:56.540 --> 2:27:58.540]  Why don't you just release it?
[2:27:58.540 --> 2:28:01.540]  Well, you notice he got blamed for hacking Weiner's account
[2:28:01.540 --> 2:28:02.540]  And turned out that wasn't true
[2:28:02.540 --> 2:28:03.540]  Weiner was lying
[2:28:03.540 --> 2:28:05.540]  And he's hyped things a lot before
[2:28:05.540 --> 2:28:06.540]  He'd done this over and over again
[2:28:06.540 --> 2:28:09.540]  He got confident and thought he was bulletproof
[2:28:09.540 --> 2:28:12.540]  And he was going to release it yesterday morning and got killed
[2:28:12.540 --> 2:28:13.540]  I agree
[2:28:13.540 --> 2:28:17.540]  If I ever got something like that, it'd be out in hours
[2:28:17.540 --> 2:28:20.540]  I don't notice, I don't announce a lot of stuff when it's breaking news
[2:28:20.540 --> 2:28:21.540]  I just release it
[2:28:21.540 --> 2:28:23.540]  Because that's when it's dangerous
[2:28:23.540 --> 2:28:25.540]  Bob, do you think Kuber has got to him?
[2:28:25.540 --> 2:28:27.540]  Or do you think he had a death wish?
[2:28:27.540 --> 2:28:29.540]  Because I don't think I'm bulletproof
[2:28:29.540 --> 2:28:30.540]  I'm just committed
[2:28:30.540 --> 2:28:31.540]  What do you think was going on there?
[2:28:31.540 --> 2:28:33.540]  Why didn't he just release it?
[2:28:33.540 --> 2:28:36.540]  Well, I think he wanted some notoriety
[2:28:36.540 --> 2:28:38.540]  A little sensationalism
[2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:42.540]  And he wanted to be more noticed as someone who was important
[2:28:42.540 --> 2:28:44.540]  In uncovering things like that
[2:28:44.540 --> 2:28:46.540]  I think there was a number of reasons
[2:28:46.540 --> 2:28:50.540]  But I would have done it the way that you just described it
[2:28:50.540 --> 2:28:51.540]  Here we have it
[2:28:51.540 --> 2:28:53.540]  There it is, it's out in the public
[2:28:53.540 --> 2:28:55.540]  Two days later
[2:28:55.540 --> 2:28:58.540]  And yeah, we're going to bury it
[2:28:58.540 --> 2:29:00.540]  After the fact
[2:29:00.540 --> 2:29:02.540]  Because then they're not going to kill you
[2:29:02.540 --> 2:29:03.540]  That's what I've learned
[2:29:03.540 --> 2:29:06.540]  If you have something they know could really hurt them
[2:29:06.540 --> 2:29:08.540]  And you hold on to it
[2:29:08.540 --> 2:29:10.540]  The hit men are coming
[2:29:10.540 --> 2:29:11.540]  I mean, it's just you're dead
[2:29:11.540 --> 2:29:13.540]  If you mess with the latest families
[2:29:13.540 --> 2:29:14.540]  You're dead
[2:29:14.540 --> 2:29:19.540]  I mean, even Barbara Bush said that on Larry King
[2:29:19.540 --> 2:29:22.540]  He said, what do you think people are messing with your family?
[2:29:22.540 --> 2:29:23.540]  Like your granddaughters
[2:29:23.540 --> 2:29:24.540]  He said, I will kill you
[2:29:24.540 --> 2:29:25.540]  I will have you killed
[2:29:25.540 --> 2:29:26.540]  And he went, what do you mean?
[2:29:26.540 --> 2:29:28.540]  She goes, you heard me, I'll have you killed
[2:29:28.540 --> 2:29:30.540]  I mean, that's just how they are
[2:29:30.540 --> 2:29:32.540]  And so you got to know when to hold them
[2:29:32.540 --> 2:29:33.540]  Know when to fold them
[2:29:33.540 --> 2:29:34.540]  Know when to walk away
[2:29:34.540 --> 2:29:35.540]  Know when to run
[2:29:35.540 --> 2:29:37.540]  Charge straight in, cover the info
[2:29:37.540 --> 2:29:39.540]  But there's certain little rules
[2:29:39.540 --> 2:29:41.540]  Don't hold on to bombshell info
[2:29:41.540 --> 2:29:43.540]  And don't mess with people's families
[2:29:43.540 --> 2:29:44.540]  It's the same thing with my family
[2:29:44.540 --> 2:29:46.540]  You mess with my family
[2:29:46.540 --> 2:29:48.540]  It's going to look like the movie Terminator
[2:29:48.540 --> 2:29:50.540]  Thank you, Bob
[2:29:50.540 --> 2:29:51.540]  We're on the march
[2:29:51.540 --> 2:29:54.540]  The Empire's on the run
[2:29:54.540 --> 2:30:23.540]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:30:24.540 --> 2:30:27.540]  He's the first person to ever call it
[2:30:27.540 --> 2:30:28.540]  A survival seed bank
[2:30:28.540 --> 2:30:30.540]  And it can produce an endless supply
[2:30:30.540 --> 2:30:33.540]  Of nutrient dense food for you and your family
[2:30:33.540 --> 2:30:34.540]  And here's the best part
[2:30:34.540 --> 2:30:36.540]  These seeds have not been genetically modified
[2:30:36.540 --> 2:30:37.540]  In any way
[2:30:37.540 --> 2:30:38.540]  And you actually get enough seeds

[2:33:15.980 --> 2:33:22.060]  joining us, I really want to get his take on Breitbart's death. Also, Arpaio, the sheriff
[2:33:22.060 --> 2:33:28.860]  confirming World Net Daily and Dr. Corsi's research and of course our research. The first
[2:33:28.860 --> 2:33:34.740]  day it came out we did the analysis here because we've got Photoshop experts and people with
[2:33:34.740 --> 2:33:39.180]  media degrees from major universities here and it was ridiculously fake and we blew
[2:33:39.180 --> 2:33:46.340]  up the different typeset. They didn't even use the same type and we confirmed that it
[2:33:46.340 --> 2:33:52.660]  was identical letters which a typewriter doesn't do when it slaps down. The ink always, it's
[2:33:52.660 --> 2:34:03.340]  like a fingerprint or snowflake, it's slightly different. It was a Photoshop deal and remember
[2:34:03.340 --> 2:34:07.180]  this is a group that shipped guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment. I mean they're
[2:34:07.180 --> 2:34:14.300]  criminals. Before we go back to our next guest and your calls, a couple of program notes.
[2:34:14.300 --> 2:34:16.780]  I'm going to do the nightly news tonight. I've been out of town as you know for a week
[2:34:16.780 --> 2:34:21.940]  and a half. We did a beta test of a road tour. I just went to Dallas in Orlando. Big success
[2:34:21.940 --> 2:34:25.900]  and I do plan some more in the future is the question is will I have time to go on the
[2:34:25.900 --> 2:34:33.300]  road before everything goes to hell in a handbasket. But we're going to premiere my Dallas speech
[2:34:33.300 --> 2:34:39.500]  tonight after the news. I'll do the news. I'm going to interview Wayne Madsen who was
[2:34:39.500 --> 2:34:45.820]  told by a government source and a federal informant separately that they had shot judge
[2:34:45.820 --> 2:34:49.380]  role in the Congresswoman because they were meeting discussing Fast and Furious and I
[2:34:49.380 --> 2:34:52.780]  separately later confirmed that with another source. He was told get out of the country
[2:34:52.780 --> 2:34:57.380]  or they're going to kill him and he's been going to Chicago investigating all the mafia
[2:34:57.380 --> 2:35:05.660]  connections and the connections to communist and he's been threatened. And believe me the
[2:35:05.660 --> 2:35:09.340]  Chicago mob will kill you and that's a big part of who runs Obama. And these are just
[2:35:09.340 --> 2:35:12.460]  murderous people that are out of control. We got to start saying no sometime though.
[2:35:12.460 --> 2:35:18.420]  They can't get us all. And so we're going to premiere my speech tonight after the news.
[2:35:18.420 --> 2:35:24.540]  It's all coming up at PrismPlanet.tv and we're running 15 day free trials. You're 15 cents
[2:35:24.540 --> 2:35:29.260]  a day when you do get a monthly membership. Finance is much of what we do. And then of
[2:35:29.260 --> 2:35:35.140]  course just like the new film New World Order blueprint of Mad Men. I premiered it at these
[2:35:35.140 --> 2:35:40.140]  events. I premiered it a few days ago at PrismPlanet.tv. And then yesterday we put it up on the
[2:35:40.140 --> 2:35:45.020]  YouTube channel for everybody. You see it first but you're really funding this alternative
[2:35:45.020 --> 2:35:49.580]  media organization that is really hurting the globalist. And we're risking our lives
[2:35:49.580 --> 2:35:56.020]  doing this. Make no mistake. So again if you're not a PrismPlanet.tv member now is the time.
[2:35:56.020 --> 2:36:00.860]  Now speaking of being in danger, the guy we've got on the line doesn't really talk about this
[2:36:00.860 --> 2:36:05.020]  but he had a high level, highest level security clearance with the State Department, counter
[2:36:05.020 --> 2:36:11.200]  terrorism obviously in intelligence work and but he won't talk about it. Dr. Jerome
[2:36:11.200 --> 2:36:15.980]  Of course he also of course Harvard educated in finance and worked at the highest levels
[2:36:15.980 --> 2:36:19.260]  of that so he can speak to what's happening with the banks right now as well. And you
[2:36:19.260 --> 2:36:22.580]  can say what you want about him. He is an American firster. He doesn't like the New
[2:36:22.580 --> 2:36:26.740]  World Order. He does, you know, he talks about agenda 21. He talks about the North American
[2:36:26.740 --> 2:36:32.940]  Union. He's been very effective. And the White House one week before his book came out announced
[2:36:32.940 --> 2:36:38.260]  his book had been recalled through Esquire which wasn't true. And had Obama come out
[2:36:38.260 --> 2:36:42.740]  and released the fake birth certificate. So they're concerned about this type of stuff.
[2:36:42.740 --> 2:36:47.700]  And so this birth certificate thing and our Pio ties in as well to Breitbart because Breitbart
[2:36:47.700 --> 2:36:53.020]  has the footage and said he was going to release it. This is hiding in plain view. We just
[2:36:53.020 --> 2:36:56.420]  dug it up and posted it. So it's one of the top stories on the web today. The top political
[2:36:56.420 --> 2:37:01.900]  story number six on the web. The top story on Drudge Report that he said I'm going to
[2:37:01.900 --> 2:37:08.660]  release the film of Obama at communist meetings where they're discussing reeducation, overthrow
[2:37:08.660 --> 2:37:12.580]  the U.S. government, everything. I'm going to release it March 1st. Turns out he said
[2:37:12.580 --> 2:37:16.460]  this in three separate interviews and a speech. Not just the speech you've all seen where
[2:37:16.460 --> 2:37:19.420]  he said I'm going to release footage. We're going to vet him. He's not going to get away
[2:37:19.420 --> 2:37:26.060]  with it this time. So he was going to swift boat Obama who's already politically garbage.
[2:37:26.060 --> 2:37:29.860]  You know, he's not the chosen one anymore. You got all these memos coming out by the
[2:37:29.860 --> 2:37:34.380]  operatives. Even in the financial times of London saying Oklahoma City blamed on the
[2:37:34.380 --> 2:37:41.540]  right wing would really help Robert Shapiro and others. We're at a key juncture here.
[2:37:41.540 --> 2:37:47.220]  Okay. And they fired Napolitano. They fired Buchanan the same week. I've talked to folks
[2:37:47.220 --> 2:37:50.660]  at the highest levels of talk radio. They say they're being threatened not to mess with
[2:37:50.660 --> 2:37:55.220]  Obama. Rupert Murdoch is being blackmailed. I'm really giving Jerome a briefing here.
[2:37:55.220 --> 2:38:01.380]  I'm sure he knows most of this, but I want to get a stake on it. The Rupert Murdoch,
[2:38:01.380 --> 2:38:06.260]  I told you they would flee England. They're selling their stuff, selling their new papers,
[2:38:06.260 --> 2:38:10.420]  selling their houses. His son has fled. They're in the news today saying he may be indicted
[2:38:10.420 --> 2:38:15.980]  here. Obama is using spying and paying off police that's standard at that level of media
[2:38:15.980 --> 2:38:19.700]  to get news stories. I'm not saying it's good, but that's like a crooked toenail compared
[2:38:19.700 --> 2:38:23.980]  to launching wars, like congressional approval, shipping guns into Mexico to blend the Second
[2:38:23.980 --> 2:38:28.380]  Amendment. All the rest of the serious crimes, you know, half billion bucks to a energy company
[2:38:28.380 --> 2:38:32.860]  that doesn't exist. All of this is coming out and the president's got the power of the
[2:38:32.860 --> 2:38:36.900]  executive right now. So he can use this and he's got the NDAA, the power to kill American
[2:38:36.900 --> 2:38:41.980]  citizens and the hit teams can be told you're sanctioned now. And they got systems to stop
[2:38:41.980 --> 2:38:47.260]  your heart chemicals, sound wave systems that cause your heart to go into cardiac arrest.
[2:38:47.260 --> 2:38:51.580]  That's declassified. So Breitbart says, I'm going to release this footage. All of this
[2:38:51.580 --> 2:38:55.500]  is coming out and he dies hours before it does when he says he's going to bring down
[2:38:55.500 --> 2:39:02.620]  Obama. And so I happen to know that's why you're suddenly seeing news corps. People
[2:39:02.620 --> 2:39:06.860]  like Huckabee say Obama's a good Christian, a loving good man. I've talked to national
[2:39:06.860 --> 2:39:12.100]  talk show host off record. Obviously can't tell you the sources, but I was told this
[2:39:12.100 --> 2:39:17.220]  months ago and now I've been confirmed from a separate source. Michael Savage fears for
[2:39:17.220 --> 2:39:21.780]  his life since he's getting death threats. This is internal and it has bodyguards. He's
[2:39:21.780 --> 2:39:25.420]  now admitted this yesterday. So I can talk about it. He has bodyguards and told Breitbart
[2:39:25.420 --> 2:39:31.540]  get some and is broadcasting from different locations saying they're out to get him. Okay,
[2:39:31.540 --> 2:39:36.860]  and he's not a paranoid guy. Love him or hate him. He's a really smart guy. This is real.
[2:39:36.860 --> 2:39:42.980]  Okay. This is real. This is a push going on and attempt to take over. Now I've said that.
[2:39:42.980 --> 2:39:48.180]  I don't know Dr. Jerome Corsi's take on all this. I've given him a five, six minute take
[2:39:48.180 --> 2:39:54.180]  on what I see going on and there's a purge going on. People that are left at news corps
[2:39:54.180 --> 2:39:59.460]  are being told back off. Obama is holding them hostage with threats of indictments for
[2:39:59.460 --> 2:40:06.780]  news corps activities. All our Pio announces he's going to investigate Obama. He gets SWAT
[2:40:06.780 --> 2:40:12.900]  team, you know, rated, investigated for civil rights stuff. It's on. It's on. And I don't
[2:40:12.900 --> 2:40:16.500]  know what we should do about this because I'm not even aligned with Limbaugh and all
[2:40:16.500 --> 2:40:20.420]  these people, but I'm telling you, they're being targeted as well. And I talk to people
[2:40:20.420 --> 2:40:26.340]  highest level that know Breitbart very well and they believe he was killed off record.
[2:40:26.340 --> 2:40:29.700]  Not just Savage and WorldNet Daily saying they think it happened. I've talked to people
[2:40:29.700 --> 2:40:35.060]  that know him very well. I was leaving it at that and they have said, yeah, he made
[2:40:35.060 --> 2:40:40.460]  some people mad. And the word is, this is a message to everybody. Now I've said it.
[2:40:40.460 --> 2:40:43.420]  That's the intro. Dr. Corsi, what's your take on what I just said?
[2:40:43.420 --> 2:40:49.140]  Well, first of all, I've been listening to it intently and I can really have tolerably
[2:40:49.140 --> 2:40:56.100]  agreeing with about everything you're saying. First of all, I've got solid intelligence
[2:40:56.100 --> 2:41:00.860]  that people at Fox are told, for instance, that they ever discussed the Berther story.
[2:41:00.860 --> 2:41:09.020]  They're off the air. They're done. I mean, don't dare do this. I'm not quite ready to
[2:41:09.020 --> 2:41:16.900]  print it yet because I had to give the information over to the sheriff's posse. This is information
[2:41:16.900 --> 2:41:25.100]  the sheriff's posse has been developing as well. I think the squashing of the birth certificate,
[2:41:25.100 --> 2:41:32.860]  the Obama lack of documentation as to who he is, is a story the White House has sat
[2:41:32.860 --> 2:41:38.860]  on Fox and others and say, if you do this, you're done. And if the White House turns
[2:41:38.860 --> 2:41:44.580]  on a news agency, I mean, there's any number of ways they can go. Remember, this is the
[2:41:44.580 --> 2:41:50.580]  White House that had Robert Bauer and Anita Dunn in the White House. Anita Dunn and Robert
[2:41:50.580 --> 2:41:58.860]  Bauer were married. Robert Bauer was the attorney from Perkins Coy that did all of the defense
[2:41:58.860 --> 2:42:04.980]  of Obama on the birth certificate lawsuit. He first worked at Perkins Coy and then when
[2:42:04.980 --> 2:42:09.260]  Obama got elected, he brought him to Perkins Coy and put him in the White House as White
[2:42:09.260 --> 2:42:16.060]  House counsel. Anita Dunn was his wife. She was in the White House. Anita Dunn was the
[2:42:16.060 --> 2:42:23.060]  one who was going public criticizing Fox. Anita Dunn had to finally withdraw. She had
[2:42:23.060 --> 2:42:28.100]  to leave the White House because she just was getting too outrageous at her attacks
[2:42:28.100 --> 2:42:36.100]  on Fox. And by the way, Robert Bauer left the White House unexplained reason. They said
[2:42:36.100 --> 2:42:41.580]  it was going to work on the campaign. Within days of when the long form birth certificate
[2:42:41.580 --> 2:42:46.780]  was released, and I published the news I had, the intelligence I've had on that, is that
[2:42:46.780 --> 2:42:52.380]  Bauer knew it was a fake. When they finally released this electronic document, the White
[2:42:52.380 --> 2:42:57.020]  House is calling it Obama's birth certificate. Robert Bauer's, I believe, said, I'm out
[2:42:57.020 --> 2:43:03.340]  of here. I don't want to be involved now and what I know is a criminal fraud.
[2:43:03.340 --> 2:43:08.020]  Now, I want to get back into the birth certificate and obviously you have the White House responding
[2:43:08.020 --> 2:43:12.340]  to you the week before and then doing the old and rotten thing. I mean, they're concerned.
[2:43:12.340 --> 2:43:15.980]  They wouldn't be doing all of this if it wasn't a big deal. But expanding on that, you have
[2:43:15.980 --> 2:43:19.620]  the Kenyan government saying, well, the evidence of his birth has been removed. Well, that's
[2:43:19.620 --> 2:43:24.420]  evidence it was there. I mean, if he was born there, then it would have to be removed. If
[2:43:24.420 --> 2:43:28.140]  he wasn't, it wouldn't be their period. And they said evidence of fraud as you broke and
[2:43:28.140 --> 2:43:32.020]  the White House confirmed that. But let's go back to Andrew Breitbart. I mean, what
[2:43:32.020 --> 2:43:36.540]  was he thinking as saying, I'm going to prove he's hanging out with communists and we got
[2:43:36.540 --> 2:43:42.980]  footage and I'm going to release it March 1st. And then he's, I mean, I guess he underestimated
[2:43:42.980 --> 2:43:49.060]  just how evil they were. I mean, this just reeks of a killing. And the way they announced
[2:43:49.060 --> 2:43:53.180]  that he had died within two hours from natural causes, they never do that.
[2:43:53.180 --> 2:44:01.020]  Well, in fact, if you watched the press conference yesterday from Sheriff Arpile, I announced
[2:44:01.020 --> 2:44:06.380]  at the press conference, Sheriff asked me to that Breitbart called the sheriff just hours
[2:44:06.380 --> 2:44:12.300]  before he died. The two of them had a conversation. Breitbart was interviewing Sheriff Arpile.
[2:44:12.300 --> 2:44:17.940]  I handed the phone to Sheriff Arpile. We got Breitbart and Sheriff Arpile together on a
[2:44:17.940 --> 2:44:25.660]  landline and they talked for about 12 or 15 minutes. And so, you know, the fact was that
[2:44:25.660 --> 2:44:31.700]  Breitbart, Breitbart knew Arpile was going to be coming out with a press conference on
[2:44:31.700 --> 2:44:36.500]  March 1. And I'm sure I told him it's TPAC. We've been...
[2:44:36.500 --> 2:44:41.820]  Oh, wait a minute. My gut told me they were connected. It was March 1st, the press conference.
[2:44:41.820 --> 2:44:46.780]  He was involved. They knew if Breitbart started going with the Berther issue, that would be
[2:44:46.780 --> 2:44:47.780]  over for Obama.
[2:44:47.780 --> 2:44:51.700]  Well, you know, you had Breitbart and Arpile talking.
[2:44:51.700 --> 2:44:57.980]  Oh, boy. Well, what do you think about this reported footage? Now they're saying two weeks.
[2:44:57.980 --> 2:45:02.260]  If it was going to come out yesterday, why would they need two weeks now to release it
[2:45:02.260 --> 2:45:05.060]  unless there's pressure to redact what's going to be released?
[2:45:05.060 --> 2:45:10.540]  I don't know. I mean, the guys developing the film, I trust. I mean, these are good
[2:45:10.540 --> 2:45:19.260]  guys. And I know they have a plan to continue with Breitbart's operation. It's Solov who's
[2:45:19.260 --> 2:45:26.020]  probably going to end up the CEO is developing these films. And I don't know what's on these
[2:45:26.020 --> 2:45:31.100]  films. I have no clue what's on these films. I've not seen them.
[2:45:31.100 --> 2:45:34.500]  Well, he gave hints. He said it's Obama and basically in communist meetings.
[2:45:34.500 --> 2:45:38.940]  Well, you know, these are things I think are going to be very important to see and to get
[2:45:38.940 --> 2:45:47.420]  out because also yesterday, Sheriff Arpile announced, I mean, it's Mike Zolo, the chief
[2:45:47.420 --> 2:45:52.540]  you know, the lead investigator. And by the way, we just published an e-book on questions
[2:45:52.540 --> 2:45:58.060]  of ineligibility. Mike Zolo and I are releasing a great deal of the information that Sheriff
[2:45:58.060 --> 2:46:05.700]  is willing to release about the investigation, the Arpile investigation on Obama's eligibility
[2:46:05.700 --> 2:46:11.900]  but not just the birth certificate, the Selective Service Registration Card, which is forged
[2:46:11.900 --> 2:46:16.900]  missing records and travel records from the immigration and naturalization service in
[2:46:16.900 --> 2:46:18.540]  and out of Hawaii. That's right.
[2:46:18.540 --> 2:46:22.660]  The week that Obama was born. That's right. Explain to people, it's the missing records.
[2:46:22.660 --> 2:46:29.480]  It's the proof of cover-up is the proof of guilt. Yeah. And we just wrote this e-book,
[2:46:29.480 --> 2:46:36.180]  question of eligibility, question of eligibility under my name, Jerome Corsi and Mike Zolo,
[2:46:36.180 --> 2:46:41.940]  D-U-L-L-O. We lay all this out just like we did at the press conference. Now, you know,
[2:46:41.940 --> 2:46:47.220]  another question I think is, and we've, so we've developed, Mike Zolo said at the press
[2:46:47.220 --> 2:46:57.940]  conference, this investigation has developed information about Ayers and Obama. Again,
[2:46:57.940 --> 2:47:02.740]  explosive. We're getting ready to release that. Oh boy. Well, why don't you give us
[2:47:02.740 --> 2:47:07.660]  a hint now so they don't right-bark you? Well, I mean, you know, look, what I'll do
[2:47:07.660 --> 2:47:10.820]  is I'll tell you, well, you know, once we're ready to release it, I'll come back on your
[2:47:10.820 --> 2:47:17.340]  show. Make sure you get it first. We'll publish it in W&D that day. I'll be on your show and
[2:47:17.340 --> 2:47:21.980]  release it to you. What's the timeframe on that? I mean, because whatever you guys are
[2:47:21.980 --> 2:47:27.060]  working on, they're scared of it. I'd say about 10 days. I'd say about 10 days. Sharon
[2:47:27.060 --> 2:47:32.700]  for Pyle is going to have another explosive announcement. And I'll be... Well, how obvious
[2:47:32.700 --> 2:47:36.340]  is it when our Pyle started investigating him, what, six months ago, because the state
[2:47:36.340 --> 2:47:40.060]  legislature and others, you know, were trying to look at the eligibility and he's got a
[2:47:40.060 --> 2:47:44.140]  big investigative force. It's a big county with Phoenix there. I mean, all of a sudden
[2:47:44.140 --> 2:47:48.820]  the feds write him right after he starts investigating. How obvious is that? They are scared.
[2:47:48.820 --> 2:47:54.460]  Well, you know, what people should realize is that what Sharon for Pyle has launched
[2:47:54.460 --> 2:48:00.740]  here is a game changer because, you know, they're done debating the law enforcement
[2:48:00.740 --> 2:48:05.500]  team and the sheriff's, our Pyle's office at Phoenix is done debating whether it's
[2:48:05.500 --> 2:48:10.740]  the scanner or that scanner or, you know, how many layers. They've developed probable
[2:48:10.740 --> 2:48:15.140]  cause. They're not going to debate that evidence with anybody. They've developed probable cause.
[2:48:15.140 --> 2:48:20.820]  Now, you know, it's down to fine suspects and see who actually committed the crimes they've
[2:48:20.820 --> 2:48:26.500]  identified. And it is a crime in that state because Obama's trying to get elected there.
[2:48:26.500 --> 2:48:31.980]  Well, there's, you know, several issues. One is the internet because these, you know, the
[2:48:31.980 --> 2:48:39.820]  first certificate was put out over the internet and over television, including internet television,
[2:48:39.820 --> 2:48:45.660]  as well as broadcast and cable TV for the press conference, April 27th, 2011 at the White
[2:48:45.660 --> 2:48:54.060]  House. And in Arizona, the president has to get on the state ballot at the state decision
[2:48:54.060 --> 2:48:59.380]  and the state here in Arizona has to make a determination of birth credential. Now, you
[2:48:59.380 --> 2:49:04.380]  know, if we said there's was announced yesterday at the press conference at Phoenix, I've been
[2:49:04.380 --> 2:49:10.780]  working with the investigation to hand over my information. I've agreed that the new information
[2:49:10.780 --> 2:49:16.940]  I develop about Obama is going to go to the investigation. So, you know, and again, it's
[2:49:16.940 --> 2:49:21.460]  not a jury course, the investigation. These are tough law enforcement guys. They take
[2:49:21.460 --> 2:49:25.820]  what I've got, but I don't know all the things they're working on. I don't vote or
[2:49:25.820 --> 2:49:30.500]  deliberate with them. I was not in the room. Well, I watched his forensics people in the
[2:49:30.500 --> 2:49:34.140]  press conference. I want, and they were just, it was, they were totally convinced this was
[2:49:34.140 --> 2:49:38.940]  not an act. They were showing the evidence and it's just, there it is. And look, the
[2:49:38.940 --> 2:49:43.140]  before the policy got the sheriff could have been, they were talking with experts around
[2:49:43.140 --> 2:49:48.540]  the world that can reveal those until they get into a trial setting on the computer,
[2:49:48.540 --> 2:49:54.860]  on, you know, the characteristics of Obama's birth certificate released at the PDF file
[2:49:54.860 --> 2:50:00.140]  on that selective service card to watch the press conference or read this e-book. Okay,
[2:50:00.140 --> 2:50:06.220]  they got all the photographs of the e-book, the question of eligibility. If you take a
[2:50:06.220 --> 2:50:12.220]  look at it, they even figured out the date stamp, the post office date stamp that was
[2:50:12.220 --> 2:50:19.220]  used to forge Obama's selective service registration card. Incredible. And they proved it was a
[2:50:19.220 --> 2:50:25.420]  forgery working in conjunction with former postal officials who were in the post office
[2:50:25.420 --> 2:50:34.100]  in 1980 and the two digit years stamp that was used on Obama's selective service card
[2:50:34.100 --> 2:50:39.020]  is a forgery was never used officially in the post office. One like that doesn't exist.
[2:50:39.020 --> 2:50:43.820]  Unbelievable. It's, and now we know why they wanted to put an illegal alien basically in
[2:50:43.820 --> 2:50:50.340]  there. An illegal is because they could blackmail him. I mean, this is, this is, and now this
[2:50:50.340 --> 2:50:54.860]  blackmailed puppet is trying to bring down the entire country. And Andrew Breitbart was
[2:50:54.860 --> 2:50:58.900]  about to release information and they killed him better than a hammer. Dr. Jerome Korsy's

[2:54:03.220 --> 2:54:10.220]  All right, final segment. I'll be back for a big, extended, special, InfoWars Nelly News this evening.
[2:54:10.220 --> 2:54:17.220]  We're with Dr. Jerome Corsi right now. Doc, look, we know there's political hits that go on.
[2:54:17.220 --> 2:54:23.220]  We know that he brought down Acron, which caused, you know, cost these big-city mafia outfits,
[2:54:23.220 --> 2:54:28.220]  upwards of $8 million a year. We know that they were scared of Breitbart.
[2:54:28.220 --> 2:54:33.220]  I know that you've been working with him. I know that they're scared of you.
[2:54:33.220 --> 2:54:42.220]  Do you ever fear for your life? I mean, what's your gut on how he died the day he said he was going to release this bombshell video?
[2:54:42.220 --> 2:54:49.220]  I mean, that's pretty obvious right there. I mean, what's your gut tell you about what happened here?
[2:54:49.220 --> 2:54:59.220]  I don't know. I mean, this is, you've got, I've been so involved with the Arpaio investigation that, you know, Breitbart's death was absolutely shocked to me.
[2:54:59.220 --> 2:55:05.220]  I mean, I was floored when I heard this yesterday. I was, I didn't, totally unbelievable.
[2:55:05.220 --> 2:55:10.220]  At first I didn't believe it. I thought it was a joke. I thought it was Andrew with another one of those jokes, you know.
[2:55:10.220 --> 2:55:22.220]  And of course, I really realized talking to, talking to my editor in New York who did the, this e-book, you know, the question of eligibility, the one we just got out yesterday.
[2:55:22.220 --> 2:55:27.220]  And my editor told me Breitbart was dead and I said, I cannot believe that.
[2:55:27.220 --> 2:55:39.220]  Now, it is prompted discussion with me and, you know, the Amish Sheriff's enforcement group, we've had discussions internally here.
[2:55:39.220 --> 2:55:46.220]  You know, advising me to be by security ought to be really beefed up.
[2:55:46.220 --> 2:55:51.220]  Oh no, that's news. So, so even the sheriff's department is thinking they smell something.
[2:55:51.220 --> 2:56:00.220]  You know, the sheriff's department is feeling that everybody's security at this point for this investigation being undertaken needs to be the tightest possible.
[2:56:00.220 --> 2:56:04.220]  And Alex, I've got, I made time for you today. I've got another interview coming and hold on.
[2:56:04.220 --> 2:56:08.220]  I hate to do this. I've made time for you today. I'm going to have to go.
[2:56:08.220 --> 2:56:13.220]  No, no, I understand. We'll have to get you back on maybe Sunday to break this down.
[2:56:13.220 --> 2:56:21.220]  Alex, I'm just going to have to go, Alex. I made, I always, no matter what I'm doing, I squeeze time.
[2:56:21.220 --> 2:56:26.220]  No, no, that's fine. I understand. The show's over anyways. How about we call you back later and get you back on Sunday?
[2:56:26.220 --> 2:56:28.220]  That'd be, I'd be delighted to do that.
[2:56:28.220 --> 2:56:32.220]  Okay. Thank you so much. Dr. Jerome Corsi, there he goes. Got him on short notice.
[2:56:32.220 --> 2:56:41.220]  Well, there you have it. That was breaking news right there. The sheriff's department is obviously not stupid out there in Phoenix.
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:50.220]  This is real folks. And I wish that the evidence didn't point towards them killing him.
[2:56:50.220 --> 2:56:56.220]  And, you know, I yesterday, I called Paul Watson in the morning and I just said, this stinks to high heaven.
[2:56:56.220 --> 2:57:03.220]  He was about to bring out a bunch of info. And then we find out he was going to release it that day.
[2:57:03.220 --> 2:57:08.220]  And now we learn it's about Obama at communist meetings.
[2:57:08.220 --> 2:57:14.220]  The people that control Obama want to keep him in there so he can just keep robbing and stealing and no bid contracts.
[2:57:14.220 --> 2:57:19.220]  And I'm not saying the Republicans are good either. It's just that this is the devil we've got in there right now.
[2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:26.220]  And it just goes on and on and on. I'm not going to sit here with a group of known liars who tell me within just two hours.
[2:57:26.220 --> 2:57:32.220]  Oh, hey, he died of this. Go to sleep. Nothing happened. Well, now they're saying there's going to be a medical examiner.
[2:57:32.220 --> 2:57:37.220]  Autopsy. Obviously there should be. If I drop dead in the street folks demand an autopsy.
[2:57:37.220 --> 2:57:45.220]  43 years old. And he could have died naturally. It could be a bizarre, bizarre, bizarre coincidence.
[2:57:45.220 --> 2:57:49.220]  That he was just about to release all this and say it was going to bring Obama down and this happened.
[2:57:49.220 --> 2:57:56.220]  But does your gut tell you that? Does your gut tell you that? No.
[2:57:56.220 --> 2:58:05.220]  We got to most the calls. Lord willing, I'll be back this Sunday live 4 to 6 p.m. Central on your local AM and FM dial or on the audio streams at info wars.com.
[2:58:05.220 --> 2:58:15.220]  And of course, a lot of stations, you know, carry the next hour as well, like XM. XM takes two of the hours live.
[2:58:15.220 --> 2:58:20.220]  Then we rear the first hour and fourth hour. Because I used to do four hours and they're still set to that.
[2:58:20.220 --> 2:58:30.220]  I can certainly do 10 hours on a day like this. It's creepy, but we got to stand up against these criminals because they want to totally take over our society.
[2:58:30.220 --> 2:58:40.220]  We got to decide which side we're on. I'll see you tonight on the news as well. 7 o'clock Central at prisonplanet.tv. More coming up.
