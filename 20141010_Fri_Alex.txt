[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.240 --> 00:19.800]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.800 --> 00:33.480]  Texas Alex Jones I'm gonna try to be as professional as I can today and try to
[00:33.480 --> 00:38.640]  hit all these balls that are getting shot out of this out of this picture
[00:38.640 --> 00:45.240]  machine at us something I haven't covered the last few days only focusing on
[00:45.240 --> 00:49.440]  Ebola or mainly focusing on Ebola and the economy and things like that is
[00:49.440 --> 00:54.600]  Ferguson and St. Louis have blown up cops more cops have been shot more
[00:54.600 --> 01:00.680]  protesters have been shot one being killed two days ago and now angry
[01:00.680 --> 01:06.800]  protesters target quote wealthy whites vandalized homes burn US flags assault
[01:06.800 --> 01:12.240]  reporters call for officers death so this is just absolutely spiraling out of
[01:12.240 --> 01:17.760]  control and the photos and videos of the flag burning and all the rest of it is
[01:17.760 --> 01:23.920]  just over the top so we're gonna get into some of that today where our
[01:23.920 --> 01:28.160]  reporters obviously were on the ground in the middle of all that and quite
[01:28.160 --> 01:32.680]  frankly we saw a lot of bad behavior by the protesters and a lot of bad behavior
[01:32.680 --> 01:36.160]  by the police but the feds posing as saviors when they gave the police the
[01:36.160 --> 01:43.160]  training but now the last few weeks the police I'm getting shot at and shot and
[01:43.160 --> 01:51.200]  that's escalating things so I would expect to see looters being killed and
[01:51.200 --> 01:58.000]  more and more the looters are giving the First Amendment a very very bad name to
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.120]  say the least again that's just a side note I haven't covered that I've been
[02:02.120 --> 02:07.640]  remiss I have a tendency when I've got something so giant and so massive to not
[02:07.640 --> 02:12.280]  talk about it now I've tried to psychoanalyze what that is and it's
[02:12.280 --> 02:17.440]  because I don't feel like I can properly break down how big something is
[02:17.440 --> 02:22.760]  until we've put it on paper as an article on info wars.com or prison
[02:22.760 --> 02:33.200]  planet.com Dr. Edward group is one of the most successful supplement
[02:33.200 --> 02:38.280]  nutraceutical formulators in the country and he helps us formulate our line
[02:38.280 --> 02:43.960]  for info wars life.com and he said he could come in he flew into Austin late
[02:43.960 --> 02:51.560]  last night he was in Las Vegas for the big internal research medical

[02:58.720 --> 03:02.760]  supplement development and there were just medical doctors nutritionists
[03:02.760 --> 03:07.640]  pharmacists just crawling all over the place but really they had impromptu
[03:07.640 --> 03:13.760]  breakaway meetings and he met with multiple senior level current and former
[03:13.760 --> 03:18.920]  border patrol agents and ICE agents and then had dinner with him he was there
[03:18.920 --> 03:26.920]  for days and the information he just gave us is that there are people coming
[03:26.920 --> 03:30.240]  in and it's actually in the news today strangely enough that they're getting
[03:30.240 --> 03:33.320]  people coming in from West Africa that are sick but they won't say what they
[03:33.320 --> 03:38.720]  have obviously folks West Africa has hundreds of millions of people Nigeria's
[03:38.720 --> 03:42.880]  got like 200 something million alone in it they're all trying to basically get

[04:17.200 --> 04:21.720]  worked with the CDC the CDC doesn't even want it known that's a full-on
[04:21.720 --> 04:25.520]  emergency and they actually are responding the first time they've ever
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.280]  seen them hundreds of vans black and white vans and there are people in full
[04:30.280 --> 04:34.120]  hazmat suits just grabbing these people throwing them in them disappearing and
[04:34.120 --> 04:37.320]  the border patrols where they're going they're supposed to put that down under
[04:37.320 --> 04:43.160]  federal law they just go don't worry about it and there's just vans everywhere
[04:43.160 --> 04:48.360]  and so we're gonna send reporters down to the hot zones I want to send bigs

[08:19.080 --> 08:28.640]  the GCN radio network
[08:28.640 --> 08:32.880]  Dr. Edward group is joining us in studio in the next failure he just returned
[08:32.880 --> 08:38.520]  from a giant insider based in the country trade convention on supplements in
[08:38.520 --> 08:42.480]  Las Vegas he met with current and former senior members of the board of
[08:42.480 --> 08:48.560]  patrol and ice that were there trying to research Ebola and they also talked
[08:48.560 --> 08:52.000]  about Zach Taylor so he came in and said one of the names that's looking to is
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.560]  Zach Taylor he's confirmed a lot of this we pulled up a video minutes ago
[08:56.560 --> 09:00.480]  during the break of Zach Taylor the former deputy head of the board of
[09:00.480 --> 09:03.640]  patrol the head of the board of patrol Union now the head of the former board
[09:03.640 --> 09:08.200]  of patrol Union he's been on the broadcast talking about the plan to
[09:08.200 --> 09:12.800]  collapse the country collapse the border asymmetrical warfare he's confirming
[09:12.800 --> 09:16.560]  that the board patrol already knows that they believe they're finding cases of
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.640]  Ebola on the border as Southcom came out two days ago and said they believe is
[09:21.640 --> 09:24.480]  going to happen they're getting ahead of it because they know the board of
[09:24.480 --> 09:28.720]  patrol is leaking the information to warn the American people because overall
[09:28.720 --> 09:33.760]  it's a loyal federal agency and one of the few that's constitutional you read
[09:33.760 --> 09:39.000]  the Constitution government supposed to issue the money and control the border
[09:39.000 --> 09:47.000]  and have a Navy but his sources and he's going to be in studio with us in the
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.360]  second hour Paul Watson's doing an article right now have witnessed people
[09:53.360 --> 09:57.600]  with Ebola like symptoms vomiting blood coming out of their rear ends blood
[09:57.600 --> 10:02.560]  coming out of their eyes coming across from West Africa and the Middle East and
[10:02.560 --> 10:10.160]  they are being scooped up by CDC huge teams of vans they've never before even
[10:10.160 --> 10:14.920]  seen the CDC down there and the word is oh no the CDC's responding they just
[10:14.920 --> 10:19.720]  don't want to panic that's why they're saying everything's fine and that they
[10:19.720 --> 10:24.520]  are scooping people up left and right on the Texas New Mexico Arizona and
[10:24.520 --> 10:34.440]  California border that is scary and groups back there and here's some of the
[10:34.440 --> 10:37.440]  names I don't use this name you can use that name and one of the people they
[10:37.440 --> 10:40.880]  said that we should talk to Zach Taylor he's got other sources I go Zach Taylor
[10:40.880 --> 10:44.000]  I ran over here and I said what's the name of the guy we have on it was the
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.320]  former head of the board patrol deputy of the board patrol and then the head of
[10:47.320 --> 10:51.160]  the Union oh that's Zach Taylor again Zach Taylor so we need to try to get him
[10:51.160 --> 10:57.480]  on and then Watson comes up and goes if you've seen this this is a CDC release
[10:57.480 --> 11:01.680]  admitting they're gonna have sealed plastic coffin liners that can hold up
[11:01.680 --> 11:06.320]  to four dead bodies for an Ebola outbreak and it and remember what they
[11:06.320 --> 11:12.520]  store outside the CDC in Atlanta was the millions of plastic coffins that they
[11:12.520 --> 11:18.520]  then scooped up and hid I did a whole TV show with Jesse Ventura on that and we
[11:18.520 --> 11:22.200]  even talked about Ebola if I remember correctly being one of the reasons
[11:22.200 --> 11:29.160]  unbelievable this is all about to break at info wars dot com and prison planet
[11:29.160 --> 11:32.680]  dot com it's breaking here on the radio but we're we're putting it together in
[11:32.680 --> 11:36.920]  text form and it'll be out in the next hour a basic report Watson will then
[11:36.920 --> 11:44.080]  expand on it they're all in their meeting right now so this is all this is
[11:44.080 --> 11:51.360]  all unfolding now
[11:54.040 --> 12:03.880]  obviously this is very very serious news and on the backdrop of this we have
[12:03.880 --> 12:09.800]  the headline illegal immigration jumps for third straight year under Obama while
[12:09.800 --> 12:16.040]  Jay Johnson yeah yeah Johnson says Americans are susceptible to claims
[12:16.040 --> 12:21.000]  that we have an open porous border well we see the border patrol being ordered
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.400]  to give them vouchers and load the illegals with their families on the
[12:25.400 --> 12:28.120]  buses to go anywhere they want we see the illegals getting free health care
[12:28.120 --> 12:32.040]  everywhere I'm not even against the individuals fleeing hellish third-world
[12:32.040 --> 12:36.400]  conditions except their users political tools but let's be honest this is going
[12:36.400 --> 12:42.440]  on and the fact that you keep denying it only discredit you that's Jay Johnson in
[12:42.440 --> 12:49.200]  cns news and the washington times while they let the planes fly in while
[12:49.200 --> 12:54.560]  airport workers in new york and other major cities legority and other areas
[12:54.560 --> 13:00.680]  are refusing to work and refusing to clean the planes and now tsa people are
[13:00.680 --> 13:06.080]  starting to go off the job because they don't want to be touching people when
[13:06.080 --> 13:09.640]  they make other flight connections coming in from countries that are
[13:09.640 --> 13:16.480]  collapsing six countries two of them near collapse estimated 1.4 to 5 million
[13:16.480 --> 13:19.640]  to get Ebola they can't go anywhere else they can't go to neighboring
[13:19.640 --> 13:24.640]  african countries those have been sealed the Liberian president seats more
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.320]  power to fight virus restrict movement public gatherings which is what you've
[13:28.320 --> 13:32.840]  got to do to stop something like this and our government at one level lets them
[13:32.840 --> 13:38.920]  fly in but then we talk to the border patrol and we've confirmed what group
[13:38.920 --> 13:44.320]  is telling us he just got in last night from los vegas and the border patrol
[13:44.320 --> 13:48.800]  senior people are there hyper ventilating meeting with all these
[13:48.800 --> 13:53.200]  medical doctors and researchers and saying you know is there something that
[13:53.200 --> 14:02.560]  we can counter this is there something we can get so we're going to codify all
[14:02.560 --> 14:06.680]  this information get it to an article the next hour that paul watson is working
[14:06.680 --> 14:13.440]  on it'll break that info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but I've got
[14:13.440 --> 14:20.080]  the red siren the red siren is is in here going today a la drudge report dot
[14:20.080 --> 14:30.240]  com because this whole situation is so incredibly volatile and that's how
[14:30.240 --> 14:33.840]  government operates is in a schizophrenic fashion the coast guard is
[14:33.840 --> 14:36.560]  trying to board ships and check to see if people are coming in from West
[14:36.560 --> 14:41.560]  africa that's default position what you're supposed to do the marines are
[14:41.560 --> 14:45.040]  training for Ebola outbreaks and containing areas that's what you're
[14:45.040 --> 14:50.800]  supposed to do meanwhile anything obama directly controls with these agencies
[14:50.800 --> 14:55.400]  they're ordering open borders they're ordering open flights coming in when
[14:55.400 --> 15:01.720]  nobody else was doing that but then separately our border patrol sources are
[15:01.720 --> 15:06.160]  saying no they've actually got vans I mean we're talking dozens and dozens of
[15:06.160 --> 15:12.160]  vans per sector just scurrying around grabbing people and then running off with
[15:12.160 --> 15:16.120]  them to containment centers and the border patrol has to follow federal law
[15:16.120 --> 15:20.840]  about what's this person's name where are they going sign this form and the CDC
[15:20.840 --> 15:25.760]  is like no sir with guys in hazmat suits and just throws them in trucks and the
[15:25.760 --> 15:28.600]  border patrol saying where are they going and by the way they're going into the
[15:28.600 --> 15:35.160]  US and so do just ran over here instead because we're flying to see them our
[15:35.160 --> 15:38.760]  pants here and stuff breaks he goes where do I send bigs where do I send the
[15:38.760 --> 15:43.680]  the camera people we've got to wait and you got to go in there while Watson's
[15:43.680 --> 15:47.760]  debriefing group and also checking with our border patrol sources we need to get
[15:47.760 --> 15:52.600]  Don Salazar to talk to his ice sources jacarjax and his ice sources it was our
[15:52.600 --> 15:58.480]  ice and bore patrol sources that said no come to this border patrol checkpoint in
[15:58.480 --> 16:05.480]  McCallan we're ordered to do something I'm not allowed to tell you just come and
[16:05.480 --> 16:09.080]  we get there and the buses pull across from Mexico the border patrol hands them
[16:09.080 --> 16:13.440]  vouchers with the city officials of McCallan and then they load them on
[16:13.440 --> 16:17.320]  buses and ship them anywhere they want to go we've forced mainstream media to
[16:17.320 --> 16:21.480]  admit that it's an organized collapse of the country and in the border patrol
[16:21.480 --> 16:26.400]  does not like being ordered to commit crimes and that's what senior members
[16:26.400 --> 16:29.080]  have said that are current but then we're gagged on Fox News they said we
[16:29.080 --> 16:36.520]  complete the smuggling trafficking process we complete the smuggling
[16:36.520 --> 16:42.120]  trafficking process under orders and they've cut us down 70% in our
[16:42.120 --> 16:45.480]  apprehensions and the ones we do apprehend are just released and when
[16:45.480 --> 16:50.080]  violent felons build up in county and city jails we are ordered to not go pick
[16:50.080 --> 16:54.960]  them up and cities are disgorging them let me explain what that means it means
[16:54.960 --> 16:59.760]  if you are particularly a Latin American and you're running for murdering
[16:59.760 --> 17:03.600]  your wife murdering your husband robbing a bank killing a police officer
[17:03.600 --> 17:09.840]  whatever the case is kidnapping child molestation drug dealing whatever the
[17:09.840 --> 17:15.920]  cornucopia of things are if you get to El Norte baby it's party time you can the
[17:15.920 --> 17:20.080]  Mexican consulate as part of their terrorist war against the Republic with
[17:20.080 --> 17:24.760]  the globalist will give you five six seven console matriculas with any fake
[17:24.760 --> 17:28.920]  name you want any major bank will accept those car loans house loans it's all
[17:28.920 --> 17:35.400]  been greased and then you can just run around raping stealing killing DWI's
[17:35.400 --> 17:41.720]  hitting runs you're above the law well now if you've got a bunch of South

[18:06.640 --> 18:15.520]  only safer places are maybe chilly and a few other areas and that's if you're in
[18:15.520 --> 18:23.160]  a rural area so it's a beautiful beautiful continent and pen and an
[18:23.160 --> 18:27.200]  isthmus or base peninsula you call it but it is contiguous unless you talk

[18:34.680 --> 18:44.680]  is spilling into North America and so we're just reporting we're saying the
[18:44.680 --> 18:48.680]  CDC is doing nothing the CDC are letting it spread because that's all the
[18:48.680 --> 18:51.920]  indicators we have the CDC aren't going and cleaning up the apartment they're
[18:51.920 --> 18:56.800]  telling sheriff's deputies to do it how about no thank you that's not my job be
[18:56.800 --> 18:59.720]  better to leave it alone than send people that aren't prepared or trained

[24:26.800 --> 24:30.560]  Zach Taylor the head of the union for retired board patrol agents two months
[24:30.560 --> 24:34.680]  ago said the CDC was showing up on the border we've got the video clip coming
[24:34.680 --> 24:40.120]  up and just disappearing people that was never before seen all color by the
[24:40.120 --> 24:45.440]  diseases weren't coming across but at the same time they're letting people that
[24:45.440 --> 24:48.920]  are sick through that's been confirmed we've confirmed from board of patrol
[24:48.920 --> 24:55.360]  sources that it's currently going on with people with Ebola-like symptoms
[24:55.360 --> 25:01.720]  want to be clear board of patrol sources high-level board patrol sources CDC
[25:01.720 --> 25:06.480]  disappearing people with Ebola-like symptoms on border and Watson's doing
[25:06.480 --> 25:10.680]  that article right now I mean group had dinner with these people with medical
[25:10.680 --> 25:15.640]  doctors this this this is what is going on what is being said with the board of
[25:15.640 --> 25:20.680]  patrol going to medical conferences and nutraceutical conferences trying to
[25:20.680 --> 25:24.840]  find out ways to protect their agents because what would you do if there's no
[25:24.840 --> 25:29.720]  vaccine you can't trust it you would try to find compounds that could obviously
[25:29.720 --> 25:33.880]  that's what anybody with half a brain would be doing for their agents their
[25:33.880 --> 25:41.160]  families and everybody else so you got all that going on while Jay Johnson big
[25:41.160 --> 25:49.720]  brother big sister's replacement says that it is quote we have the clip of
[25:49.720 --> 25:54.680]  this that Americans are susceptible to claims that we have an open porous
[25:54.680 --> 25:58.160]  border well yeah we're susceptible to seeing the sun come up in the morning
[25:58.160 --> 26:03.720]  to and susceptible to liking football I mean I mean what are you talking about
[26:03.720 --> 26:06.720]  I mean this is a fact
[26:07.400 --> 26:12.000]  there are death panels in Obamacare fact 2 plus 2 does equal 4 fact
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  Obama's a liar and came after our guns fact stop talking to us like we're
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.480]  idiots it only discredits you morons more
[26:21.480 --> 26:27.480]  makes me so upset to see this going on immigration illegal immigration jumps
[26:27.480 --> 26:32.040]  for third straight year under Obama and that's according to Homeland Security
[26:32.040 --> 26:38.280]  and Border Patrol's own numbers you can link through to those in the Washington
[26:38.280 --> 26:42.280]  Times article but don't don't worry about the actual numbers just Jay Johnson
[26:42.280 --> 26:48.960]  you know he says so so that's just the way it is ladies and gentlemen because
[26:48.960 --> 26:52.480]  he decides what reality is remember Carl Rove said the government now controls
[26:52.480 --> 26:56.160]  reality and we'll tell you that we're always at war with these days you one
[26:56.160 --> 26:59.880]  day never war these days in the next day and that brings me to this next point
[26:59.880 --> 27:06.680]  that I'm going back into Ebola I want to play this clip coming up seeing in all
[27:06.680 --> 27:12.920]  the other state-run media channels are running around saying what's wrong with
[27:12.920 --> 27:17.920]  Turkey they won't attack ISIS that's right over their border attacking these
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.560]  innocent wonderful Kurds what is their problem and so the ambassador from Turkey
[27:22.560 --> 27:27.800]  comes out on CNN and goes when we are given authorization from the NATO and
[27:27.800 --> 27:34.760]  everyone to create a safe zone a buffer zone in Syria we will go in and we will
[27:34.760 --> 27:44.040]  take out ISIS and Assad and the regime that's Turkey armed and trained ISIS more
[27:44.040 --> 27:46.800]  than anybody else Turkey's given them in the last four years
[27:46.800 --> 27:52.080]  artillery support every couple months and fighter bomber support so I mean
[27:52.080 --> 28:00.480]  this is the triumphs of the lie the triumphs of fraud the triumph of total
[28:00.480 --> 28:06.120]  deception and confusing geopolitical and geographic and cultural issues for the
[28:06.120 --> 28:11.320]  American people the people of the West that our governments funded al Qaeda under
[28:11.320 --> 28:18.400]  other names Khorasan ISIS ISIL IS to confuse this they're in there attacking
[28:18.400 --> 28:22.280]  Assad and the government killing Christians blowing everything up Turkey
[28:22.280 --> 28:27.240]  can't get the job done so they they have ISIS turn east and going to Iraq to
[28:27.240 --> 28:30.880]  resupply and get a bunch of weapons so they can cough and go they got all these
[28:30.880 --> 28:35.040]  US trucks and armored vehicles and weapons and stingers out of US bases we
[28:35.040 --> 28:40.680]  lost yeah wink wink not been gauzing then they infiltrate that back in on a big
[28:40.680 --> 28:44.840]  jihad and we've got to go in and what I tell you that they would take large
[28:44.840 --> 28:54.200]  zones of Syria and call them buffer zones so Iraq gets part of Syria Turkey
[28:54.200 --> 28:59.160]  gets part of Syria sandwiching and stealing the country stealing the oil
[28:59.160 --> 29:03.160]  fields and then their military simulant that was their excuse to be there
[29:03.160 --> 29:07.320]  scurries off to the next country gets on the next airlift like the airlift of
[29:07.320 --> 29:11.920]  the evil out of Afghanistan in 2001 being flown over the mountains into
[29:11.920 --> 29:16.800]  Pakistan and the next they pop up in Europe or here with stinger missiles
[29:16.800 --> 29:20.160]  shooting planes down and no one will say why did you give them stinger
[29:20.160 --> 29:26.960]  missiles I want to play that clip when we come back of the Turkish ambassador it
[29:26.960 --> 29:32.760]  means so disgusting the Turkish envoy he's the ambassador to fight ISIS the
[29:32.760 --> 29:38.640]  BS ambassador getting it lined up where everyone begs them to invade Syria and
[29:38.640 --> 29:44.120]  he says to bring down the regime well we do want to go in to bring down the
[29:44.120 --> 29:47.920]  regime and we will as soon as you all beg us and then they'll be like oh thank
[29:47.920 --> 29:52.640]  you Turkey for fun we're on the mark crazy empires on the ground cut into
[29:52.640 --> 29:57.000]  chop every hat off and the GCN radio in America people go on the next ball game

[34:41.720 --> 34:47.960]  I want to play the CNN clip that I mentioned earlier with Turkey's envoy
[34:47.960 --> 34:52.920]  in the fight against ISIS that they literally armed and trained gave air
[34:52.920 --> 34:57.800]  support artillery support to but they don't totally run it so it's kind of
[34:57.800 --> 35:02.880]  running off on its own into Iraq coming back in attacking the Kurds so the
[35:02.880 --> 35:06.800]  Kurds are rioting and attacking inside Turkey Turkish newspapers say what I'm
[35:06.800 --> 35:10.680]  saying because they live there they know that Turkey runs ISIS it's really
[35:10.680 --> 35:14.880]  Al Qaeda they're killing them they better stop they're gonna burn down Turkey as
[35:14.880 --> 35:20.240]  their response protesting which I think is very legitimate to be angry and so our
[35:20.240 --> 35:25.000]  media is like yeah Turkey get in there do something so Turkey says okay we we
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.600]  do want to take out ISIS and take down the regime that means the government
[35:29.600 --> 35:34.760]  that's fighting ISIS but they want a mandate for everyone to tell them to do
[35:34.760 --> 35:39.840]  it and beg them to do it and oh look Turkey's not conquering Syria what
[35:39.840 --> 35:45.760]  they've done before no Turkey is just coming into fight Al Qaeda who they
[35:45.760 --> 35:51.520]  trained I mean this is total problem reaction solution this this is naked in
[35:51.520 --> 35:56.440]  front of everybody here is CNN's Communist News Network a discussion of
[35:56.440 --> 36:00.520]  this and this is how they fool the people of the world in this scripted
[36:00.520 --> 36:06.320]  deception ready to do everything if there's a clear strategy that after
[36:06.320 --> 36:12.880]  ISIS we can be sure that our border will be protected we don't want the regime
[36:12.880 --> 36:18.720]  anymore on our border pushing people against towards Turkey we don't want
[36:18.720 --> 36:24.280]  other terrorist organizations to be active there so we have a national
[36:24.280 --> 36:28.760]  strategy the basic parameters of this nation strategies humanitarian
[36:28.760 --> 36:35.560]  parameter which we are receiving Syrians and Iraqis we want this humanitarian
[36:35.560 --> 36:43.000]  policy on the other side of the border second military strategy security if
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.120]  there is any threat against our national security we will take all the measures
[36:46.120 --> 36:53.040]  all the measures if needed could I just be sure that I've understood you Turkey
[36:53.040 --> 36:58.400]  under certain circumstances is prepared to put boots on the ground in Syria if
[36:58.400 --> 37:06.720]  others do their own part so if the plan would be to also degrade the Assad
[37:06.720 --> 37:12.320]  regime that's one of your conditions of course of course because we believe that
[37:12.320 --> 37:18.480]  if Assad plays a stage in Damascus with this brutal policy if ISIS goes
[37:18.480 --> 37:24.840]  another radical organization may come in and that's a by the way Turkey is more
[37:24.840 --> 37:28.200]  brutal I've studied it but no one says it because they're part of NATO in the
[37:28.200 --> 37:34.080]  and then the whole fraud former seat of the Ottoman Empire talk about brutal
[37:34.080 --> 37:39.920]  Turkey sits there out of Istanbul formally Constantinople the head of
[37:39.920 --> 37:48.600]  the Byzantine Empire sacked taken over but that's another issue talking about
[37:48.600 --> 37:55.320]  Assad being brutal when democratization is what they used under Assad to
[37:55.320 --> 38:00.160]  infiltrate with the Al Qaeda forces but that's political illiteracy for you
[38:00.160 --> 38:07.440]  they know the people of the world are politically illiterate that's why George
[38:07.440 --> 38:12.200]  Bush would say that Iran was behind Al Qaeda and Muhammad Karzai would say sir
[38:12.200 --> 38:15.160]  that's not true you know because the Middle East everybody just knew that
[38:15.160 --> 38:23.960]  was ridiculous that's like saying that the San Francisco 49ers are the New
[38:23.960 --> 38:31.360]  England Patriots I mean it's a football fans it's just total bull doesn't matter
[38:31.360 --> 38:38.680]  what team you're on you know the teams the the Houston Texans are not the
[38:38.680 --> 38:42.880]  Minnesota Vikings you can call it a conspiracy theory if you want that I
[38:42.880 --> 38:47.600]  know what something is but when you know the players and you know that and it's
[38:47.600 --> 38:51.080]  so fun to know the borders and the players and the backgrounds it's so
[38:51.080 --> 38:54.400]  addicting to learn this stuff and the more you learn and get into it the more
[38:54.400 --> 38:58.880]  you want to learn that's how I can have former top CIA analyst on I'm not
[38:58.880 --> 39:02.440]  bragging and have open full discussions with them and they teach me stuff I
[39:02.440 --> 39:05.360]  teach them things and they're also impressed because they go have briefings
[39:05.360 --> 39:07.920]  with generals that don't know this stuff because the general just wants to go
[39:07.920 --> 39:11.240]  see their mistress and go play golf and get along because they're not a real
[39:11.240 --> 39:15.560]  general a real general would be studying this stuff constantly because it's so
[39:15.560 --> 39:20.600]  addicting so I'm not saying I'm that smart I'm saying anybody could learn this
[39:20.600 --> 39:24.240]  if you wanted to get into it see I don't know baseball scores of Babe Ruth I
[39:24.240 --> 39:28.840]  don't know Mickey Mantle scores I know I think he was married to Marilyn Monroe
[39:28.840 --> 39:32.240]  I do know that there was Joe DiMaggio I forget things like that are interesting
[39:32.240 --> 39:35.960]  but I don't know about you know how many you know you know what they batted a
[39:35.960 --> 39:39.720]  certain year I don't know you know about the steroid investigations in
[39:39.720 --> 39:43.160]  Congress because I don't care I don't know about all the little petty things
[39:43.160 --> 39:48.800]  that don't affect me or my family what I do know is criminals run our government
[39:48.800 --> 39:52.760]  they're six foreign banks they're shutting our liberties down and they're
[39:52.760 --> 39:57.680]  funding Al Qaeda and using them to attack Western interest as a pretext to
[39:57.680 --> 40:01.040]  take our liberties away in the name of stopping them and it's an outrageous
[40:01.040 --> 40:09.240]  criminal plan and it's totally naked now and one group knows about it now not
[40:09.240 --> 40:15.520]  lionizing not sanctifying them the military though it's just a fact the
[40:15.520 --> 40:21.200]  military even at the lowest levels is trained to know who these groups are to
[40:21.200 --> 40:26.600]  know what flags are to know what uniforms are they all know it's Al Qaeda and
[40:26.600 --> 40:30.360]  the global is screwed up because just because the American people don't know
[40:30.360 --> 40:34.480]  which end is up on average and love death panels and think two plus two
[40:34.480 --> 40:38.480]  equals whatever Obama says and are in all the hype and watch all the money the
[40:38.480 --> 40:46.520]  military and the brass right down to the enlisted people now know so I don't
[40:46.520 --> 40:49.400]  know what you're gonna do to fix that because when you shoot stuff down with
[40:49.400 --> 40:52.720]  the stinger missiles and you and you blow up a nuclear power plant or whatever
[40:52.720 --> 40:55.920]  you're planning or whatever you have your Al Qaeda people do or whatever you
[40:55.920 --> 40:59.920]  blame on them to try to grandstand and take freedom it's just it's not gonna
[40:59.920 --> 41:05.240]  happen in a vacuum okay and I just want to get that message across to you one
[41:05.240 --> 41:12.800]  more time you could shut me up kill me shut up and kill other people message
[41:12.800 --> 41:17.800]  already got sent I already blew the horn up on the castle wall already lit the
[41:17.800 --> 41:21.800]  signal fires on the mountain tops island of signal fire other people lit
[41:21.800 --> 41:27.600]  signal fires message was already sent horn already got blue alarm already got
[41:27.600 --> 41:33.960]  pulled and I can see the chain reaction there's nothing you can do to stop it
[41:33.960 --> 41:38.640]  it's gonna spread like a good virus to your infected body and it's gonna bring
[41:38.640 --> 41:43.480]  you down World War three won't save you nothing will put your system back
[41:43.480 --> 41:49.480]  together again I suggest you surrender now and hey we'll give you
[41:49.480 --> 41:55.040]  abstention we'll send you to Alba like Napoleon you can even have part of your
[41:55.040 --> 42:01.560]  money stop it we realize you're dangerous one corner so are we you could
[42:01.560 --> 42:05.440]  have had the whole world New World Order but you wanted our souls you wanted to
[42:05.440 --> 42:10.080]  run individuals lives you wanted to attack freedom you wanted to degrade
[42:10.080 --> 42:14.700]  justice you because it threatens you you didn't like it like a cockroach
[42:14.700 --> 42:22.400]  setting like a spotlight so you wouldn't give us quarter and now everyone in the
[42:22.400 --> 42:26.600]  system realizes there's no prosperity at the end of where you're taking us and
[42:26.600 --> 42:32.560]  the whole system now is turning against Goldman Sachs JP Morgan the New World
[42:32.560 --> 42:40.560]  Order the Dutch royalty the Transylvanian royalty the German royalty the Roth
[42:40.560 --> 42:46.240]  child power access the Rockefeller crime syndicate all of it is an
[42:46.240 --> 42:51.400]  abomination should out to evil using evil techniques to take control and
[42:51.400 --> 42:57.840]  once you use evil for power you can't stop using the ring of Mordor it will
[42:57.840 --> 43:10.200]  consume you and you are creatures of your father creatures of your god so we
[43:10.200 --> 43:14.840]  have that little tidbit going on and then we have the disgusting continued
[43:14.840 --> 43:23.120]  saga the most perfect beautiful example of the disgustingness of royalty the
[43:23.120 --> 43:30.520]  disgustingness of state-run hegemonic genetic
[43:32.600 --> 43:40.680]  paternal lines or maternal with that Queen of England over there North Korean
[43:40.680 --> 43:49.040]  leader Kim Jong-un misses shrine visit oh a shrine to that pile of stinking
[43:49.040 --> 43:53.600]  skulls and dehumanization and those zombies with their souls sucked out
[43:53.600 --> 43:59.200]  those poor North Koreans I mean my god if we need any reason to oppose the
[43:59.200 --> 44:04.200]  giant state and the collectivist North Korea is writ on the wall in fiery
[44:04.200 --> 44:11.400]  flaming letters it screams out like another fire on the hill the watch
[44:11.400 --> 44:19.640]  tower ablaze that this is not where we want to go he's been gone for over a
[44:19.640 --> 44:23.520]  month hasn't been seen since September 3rd well we have a video clip on that I
[44:23.520 --> 44:28.040]  want to play as they sit there with straight faces going and the brass
[44:28.040 --> 44:34.840]  feels bad being purged quits the military over there parasites on their own
[44:34.840 --> 44:39.840]  people in just a sycophantic narcissist system that's that's Hollywood
[44:39.840 --> 44:43.320]  everything is like wanting to hang out with Hollywood stars I now realize I
[44:43.320 --> 44:46.320]  was never really into it but no one would need I guess know this unless they'd
[44:46.320 --> 44:49.960]  been around it and that's the whole illusion for people's like the matrix
[44:49.960 --> 44:55.200]  would be like this total narcissist so disconnected he thought Dennis Rodman was
[44:55.200 --> 44:59.400]  cool and then they would sit around with top leaders as he smoked cigarettes
[44:59.400 --> 45:10.120]  watching basketball games I mean Buzaro Twilight Zone on PCP this is hell with
[45:10.120 --> 45:13.840]  tens of millions of people starving millions starving a year Vanity Fair
[45:13.840 --> 45:17.560]  doing a report there admitting the only meat sold on city streets was little
[45:17.560 --> 45:25.040]  baby parts and that's all the wealth he can hardly get is his long ham sweet
[45:25.040 --> 45:30.360]  pork human meat as it's known by Kipling
[45:30.360 --> 45:34.840]  Rudiger I guess they ac-pop you rise that term it was that's what was used by
[45:34.840 --> 45:40.520]  the some of the Islanders and then the ultra rich the ultra commie elite they
[45:40.520 --> 45:45.040]  have the finest steaks MRIs everything for themselves in tiny little command
[45:45.040 --> 45:49.840]  bases and they have he has a seven-story pleasure palace where they kidnapped
[45:49.840 --> 45:54.640]  Japanese and South Korean film stars and then ship them in by private jet so
[45:54.640 --> 45:59.480]  they can come in and imagine Kim Jong-un coming in or his dad Kim Jong-il
[45:59.480 --> 46:04.560]  coming in like Baron Harkinen to pull your heartplug I mean just total
[46:04.560 --> 46:11.040]  weakness piled on filth piled on failure just like a vampire with its hunchback
[46:11.040 --> 46:16.400]  leering I mean this is the spirit of the enemy no manliness no honor no
[46:16.400 --> 46:22.960]  strength I mean a real red-blooded man I don't care what color you were can you
[46:22.960 --> 46:27.840]  imagine giving a hundred Kim Jong-ils a club and getting in a getting in a
[46:27.840 --> 46:32.680]  warehouse locked up with them and you had a club what you could do to a hundred
[46:32.680 --> 46:37.840]  Kim Jong-uns I mean just the fact that he it's just it's just screaming failure
[46:37.840 --> 46:43.800]  screaming weakness and then we look at our enemies MSNBC Obama the globalist
[46:43.800 --> 46:48.520]  all these UN people they're all the same they're Kim Jong-un wannabes they're
[46:48.520 --> 46:54.240]  nobodies no one wants them no one loves them they have no power they have no
[46:54.240 --> 47:00.760]  energy they have no soul they have no renaissance they have no lightening they
[47:00.760 --> 47:06.640]  are complete pathetic maggots absolutely trying to strangle human beauty
[47:06.640 --> 47:12.720]  strangle human competition strangle our mission to colonize space strangle our
[47:12.720 --> 47:18.600]  mission to ascend into what God has planned for us these people cannot rule over
[47:18.600 --> 47:27.680]  us cannot control us it should not exist they are disease I can't even look at
[47:27.680 --> 47:31.240]  Kim Jong-un it can be like midnight I'm going coast to coast to hell and I'm
[47:31.240 --> 47:34.520]  totally exhausted I'll let you have a trade secret the old days I drink a few
[47:34.520 --> 47:38.920]  beers because they have a stimulus effect on me I don't do that anymore now I
[47:38.920 --> 47:44.560]  pull up Hollywood people are Kim Jong-un or Obama or Hillary and I instantly
[47:44.560 --> 47:50.200]  get energy just looking at these demons looking at the scum that rules over us
[47:50.200 --> 47:53.760]  through fraud and deception that's why they poison our water and dumb us down
[47:53.760 --> 47:59.480]  because any straight-backed head screwed on even half decent person would never
[47:59.480 --> 48:05.800]  live under such trash let's go to a clip of seeing in that I'm analyzing today
[48:05.800 --> 48:11.880]  here talking about another tyrannical regime when they're trying to build one
[48:11.880 --> 48:15.880]  like that here again saying our kids don't basically belong to us and men are
[48:15.880 --> 48:19.840]  inherently bad and the state is God and questioning the dear leader Obama is
[48:19.840 --> 48:25.440]  racist they would love to live in a place like this they hate your success
[48:25.440 --> 48:29.560]  they hate your strength they hate your passion they hate the fact you love God
[48:29.560 --> 48:33.080]  they hate the fact that they don't have a monopoly of weapons so they can have
[48:33.080 --> 48:37.960]  their way with us like Kim Jong-un and the demonic coderies of little demons
[48:37.960 --> 48:43.160]  that encircle him so of course he's been swallowed up or dead or committed
[48:43.160 --> 48:48.200]  suicide or been murdered in some internal coup in that hellish pit that is a
[48:48.200 --> 48:52.760]  prison for all these demons they're building their own destruction their
[48:52.760 --> 48:57.360]  own mass guillotine let's go ahead ladies and gentlemen what you're seeing
[48:57.360 --> 49:02.120]  here is the human spirit refusing to submit I am crazed and raged against them
[49:02.120 --> 49:08.320]  I am sending out this the call as a siren to warn people that their humanity
[49:08.320 --> 49:14.200]  and their free will is under attack and by the most pathetic scum that you'd
[49:14.200 --> 49:17.600]  ever just see them for one moment and never just realize what they are for
[49:17.600 --> 49:22.000]  one moment they could be swept aside and a true renaissance could begin that is
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.920]  unbelievably incredible made of our dreams made of your passion that's what
[49:27.920 --> 49:31.720]  I want you to have is control of your own destiny that's all I want and I want
[49:31.720 --> 49:36.000]  to be able to have control of my own passion and to be what I really am
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.560]  let's go to that clip
[49:37.560 --> 49:41.560]  last time the world saw North Korea's young leader Kim Jong-un he was clearly
[49:41.560 --> 49:46.240]  limping on his way according to state media to a rock concert he's a man
[49:46.240 --> 49:52.560]  whose every move has been glorified in word and music he craves the spotlight
[49:52.560 --> 49:58.360]  whether I'm a horse or hanging out with basketball star Dennis Rodney
[49:58.360 --> 50:02.600]  Kim's five-week disappearance from the public eye has fueled endless rumors
[50:02.600 --> 50:05.800]  of bad health a coup even death
[50:05.800 --> 50:11.560]  North Korea in one way is a cult and a leader has to be seen especially a new
[50:11.560 --> 50:15.960]  leader so Kim Jong-un toured around the country and then all of a sudden he
[50:15.960 --> 50:20.800]  disappeared he hasn't been seen in public since September 3 so that by itself if
[50:20.800 --> 50:24.680]  nothing more indicates that there's something really wrong family history of
[50:24.680 --> 50:29.320]  gout and diabetes other people around him's blue eyes and that recently have
[50:29.320 --> 50:33.760]  led many to speculate that he's seriously ill one story going so far as to
[50:33.760 --> 50:37.880]  test his ankles were crushed under his own weight then there's the political
[50:37.880 --> 50:41.760]  entry look at that last year uncle fell out of favor supposedly over a power
[50:41.760 --> 50:46.600]  struggle that uncle was executed some say by machine gun in fact in less than
[50:46.600 --> 50:50.160]  three years back ladies and gentlemen almost half the country's gonna live

[50:53.680 --> 50:58.160]  whole west is going the way of Kim Jong-un's toilet will be right back stay

[52:08.840 --> 52:12.200]  his two-bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[52:12.200 --> 52:16.040]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take

[54:21.320 --> 54:26.640]  more than a hundred years ago top industrial scientist mathematician
[54:26.640 --> 54:30.800]  statisticians are on record they've been literally thousands of books probably
[54:30.800 --> 54:36.920]  written I'm aware of scores in the last hundred years documenting that with the
[54:36.920 --> 54:40.960]  industrialization and development of sciences people should work two or three
[54:40.960 --> 54:46.760]  days a week able to focus on language arts raising humanities development so
[54:46.760 --> 54:50.760]  high taxes and regulations are brought in to do with the Federal Reserve calls
[54:50.760 --> 54:56.240]  stopping overheating and that's to stop areas of the economy they don't fully
[54:56.240 --> 55:02.880]  control local sectors and and one crop local economies and other things to be
[55:02.880 --> 55:08.200]  shut down basically or milk because it's not enough to have all the fiat money at
[55:08.200 --> 55:12.160]  the Federal Reserve or the IMF World Bank you've got to be able to control your
[55:12.160 --> 55:17.000]  competition that's the real power so they create artificial scarcity and that's
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.080]  what a gen of 21 and cloward and piven and all of its about is keeping the
[55:21.080 --> 55:25.480]  people under control under resources that's how you control slaves or
[55:25.480 --> 55:32.760]  sharecroppers everything I'm saying here is just common sense and it's been done

[55:38.880 --> 55:45.800]  if it continues and so that's the real crime of these people is they're trying

[55:50.160 --> 55:55.160]  running boondoggles for fake new clean technologies to just consolidate power to
[55:55.160 --> 56:01.120]  create neo feudal serfdom in the UN's own words that's the model they want in

[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:53.840]  from a trip to Africa and now his wife is sick with vomiting and diarrhea she
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.000]  went to the hospital and was tested for Ebola but was sent home the doctors were
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.040]  wearing protective gear and mask I stressed to my wife that she shouldn't
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:08.480]  go to work until they're sure she does not have Ebola but my wife was stressing
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:15.080]  that Ebola is not airborne and she just won't have physical contact oh man there
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.840]  was a chance somebody's got Ebola from West Africa you can they can touch a
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:23.000]  counter you touch it they can sneeze it's in the droplet you get it it may be
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.760]  airborne airborne technically folks this means the virus or bacteria floats
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.400]  around the air and can live it doesn't mean the person doesn't sneeze and then
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.920]  it floats into your room and you get it you understand that I told my wife in
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:42.240]  August the Canadian Health Services started on a website that it was a
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.720]  highly probable that Ebola could be airborne and they took the information
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.480]  down as an outspread fear but the possible he's still high just thought
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.600]  you might like to know this info was the alternative true media that I trust

[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.880]  of Taylor talking about it but the issue here is his name was brought up by the
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:06.280]  border patrol agents some of them senior that dr. group met with this weekend in
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:10.920]  Vegas who were at the big medical neutral medical a biggest you know supply
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:16.440]  side event in the country by the actual you know developers pharmacist
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:22.040]  scientist you name it they were there trying to find out protect themselves
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.440]  and their agents and their families they were sent there by the border patrol and
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.920]  they said well Zach Taylor warned of it months ago and I said Zach Taylor he's
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:33.240]  been on he's the union guy and then we turns out over a month ago he did this
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.080]  video that got no attention that's up on info wars dot com saying he believed
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.760]  Ebola could come across was coming across now the head of south com says it
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.560]  could be and they believe it will if it gets into South America they're now in
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.880]  the news main line news today saying they're picking up people that are sick
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.760]  out of West Africa that's in my Ebola stack I'm gonna go to that in a few
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.760]  minutes and I'll show that to TV viewers on the document cam radio listeners can
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:01.520]  go to info wars.com we have that article post I think it's AP that's AP so all of
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:07.640]  that is unfolding and happening right now and doctor group there developing
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.960]  products for us was able to talk to a lot of these senior people and medical
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:15.640]  doctors and others about what they're seeing and what's unfolding as Oklahoma
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:19.600]  City Hospital isolates a patient exhibiting possible Ebola symptoms as
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:23.160]  Ebola pops up in Spain and other areas from them bringing in these Ebola
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:30.040]  patients never before done but former Border Patrol agent Zach Taylor has
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.920]  divulged that the CDC is working with Border Patrol authorities in the
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.880]  Department of Homeland Security to literally disappear potential Ebola
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:39.080]  victims attempting to cross the border in the United States and there's no news
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.840]  coverage no paperwork signed they're putting vans and disappeared now we
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:50.080]  confirmed that there's huge forces of vans and guys in literal spacesuits like
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.320]  in Hollywood movies grabbing people the Border Patrol goes where are they going
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.960]  sign the form and they go slam the door groups gonna tell you about this so they
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.080]  brought up Taylor he was saying his name I went wait we know him went and check he
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:06.800]  confirmed this a month ago but this is currently going on so we need to get back
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:13.040]  with those sources where they suggest we go McCallan Brownsville in Texas or do
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.840]  we go to the Arizona border do we go to the California border we need to show
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:21.400]  this because because if they are doing their job that's a good thing but why
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.920]  would they be covering it up so there's not a panic
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.680]  undoubtedly you got major African countries basically on the verge of
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.080]  collapse or collapsing that's in the news at that term African countries on the
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:35.080]  verge of collapse or are collapsing now they're saying stay in your houses in
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.980]  Liberia don't know public gatherings I mean this is this is crazy you in
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:43.040]  models 1.4 to 5 million to get it by December I don't know if that's accurate
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:49.200]  but Dr. Group joins us to talk about this in the interview the 27-year border
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:55.120]  patrol veteran Taylor was first contacted nearly three months ago in July but
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:58.560]  info were separately confirmed through other sources that the process was
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.080]  ongoing in the aftermath of America's first case of Ebola which occurred in
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.400]  Dallas last week they are literally grabbing people and disappearing them
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.680]  into vans this is so big on so many fronts why would they be doing their
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:15.080]  job and doing this keeping it quiet Dr. Group but then at the same time and I
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.800]  want to hear it from your own words you know debrief you here on air we'll have
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:22.160]  you in the next hour why would they be doing that a but be then leaving the
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.080]  planes open to fly folks in and now they admit they're not doing even the heat
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:30.180]  screening they're asking do you feel okay well someone fleeing Ebola or who
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:33.520]  has it who wants treatment for them and their kids they're not gonna say hey I
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.080]  got Ebola or hey I think I got Ebola they just want to live I mean all the
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.920]  other countries have sealed their borders the other African countries have so
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.920]  what are you things going on here tell us what happened when you were in Vegas
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:49.600]  at this big trade show well there's a lot of stuff that going on that I didn't
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.720]  really know about and that's one of the reasons why that I went to Vegas because
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:58.840]  these the scientists that were coming together there were all focusing on what
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.720]  can we do about this Ebola situation at least a lot of them were and some of
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.000]  these guys I haven't met with for years and years and years but it was more of
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.680]  like a meeting of the minds and and coming together to see what's really
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.920]  going on and I was pretty shocked I have like four pages of notes that I wrote
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:18.720]  down because the stuff that I found out is not being talked about in mainstream
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.600]  media it's you have the floor go go through what the board patrol told you
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:25.120]  first what these senior agents told you and then and then and then get into the
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:30.640]  whole list well what what I was shown a video of the guy that was talking about
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:35.080]  what's going on down at the border and these guys know and have connections
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.520]  down there and what they're saying is that people are being that anybody with
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.520]  Ebola likes they were confirming Taylor they were confirming that never before
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.600]  has the CDC and the National Institute of Health worked so closely with border
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:53.280]  patrol and that they were down there grabbing individuals and putting them
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:57.080]  in vans and taking them to a quarantine location and at that locate
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:01.560]  basically nobody knows where they were taking them to nobody knows what
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.920]  they're doing with them I mean are they trying experimental vaccines on them are
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:11.040]  they you know taking their blood are they I mean who knows what's going on you
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:15.520]  know I don't know if my main focus is what we can do to educate the people
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.480]  about how to protect themselves but at the same time you have to get the
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.680]  information that's that's out there and then look at it and see if you can
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:29.960]  confirm everything you know I just flew in last night and just this morning
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:34.160]  typed up all these notes so it would be fresh on your show today to share this
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.160]  information with all your listeners because it's important to know what's
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:42.120]  going on so you can come to a conclusion on what you need to do and you know
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.720]  what's really happening because obviously when the mainstream media is out
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:50.000]  there saying one thing it's it's something else that's going on at the
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.680]  same time so other things on my list that I found was that the CDC was getting
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:03.440]  calls from doctors all across the nation I had talked to a guy that was you know
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.800]  heading up some underground stuff for a bowl and he said that doctors are seeing
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:11.720]  patients with Ebola-like symptoms and calling the CDC and about half of those
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:20.040]  calls are going unanswered or the CDC is not following up on those calls you know
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.640]  different changes that are happening with the CDC and the who changing up
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:29.080]  their website basically saying that now you know it possibly could be airborne
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.480]  which we talked about before but just think about it I mean if you cough if
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:38.280]  you sneeze those are droplets of bodily fluids I talked to one guy that was
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:43.680]  telling me that the CDC is now warning airline crews to start using masks you
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:49.360]  know why why would they be warning people to use masks if it's not airborne
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.160]  another thing that's happening is the government is cracking down on natural
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.520]  healthcare companies right now too I mean there's a big attack on anybody
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:02.640]  advertising anything about Ebola there's an attack on colloidal silver you know
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:07.360]  anything they're they're scouring the websites out there to see who's
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:11.720]  advertising anything natural against Ebola but the thing is I mean the easy
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.120]  solution is just keep your immune system strong and you should be able to to fight
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:24.200]  it off you know usually with Ebola in the past you have this was another guy
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:27.920]  that was talking about how the transmission you know the indigenous
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.280]  tribes that are in the jungle usually get Ebola from eating monkey meat or
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.160]  something like that and then they pass it to the city but the strange thing
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:41.560]  about this is three cities at about the same time the Ebola was released in the
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:46.320]  city so it's actually the the mechanism of action of spread has been reversed
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.840]  instead of jungle the city it's now city to city to city so that was an
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:55.520]  interesting point because that would make you want to look at how all of a
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:01.160]  sudden did Ebola get released inside three cities at the same time so that
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:07.400]  was a that was interesting another thing that that they were talking about
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:11.720]  somebody had some friends at Emory University and they said that it took
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:18.280]  40 bags of medical waste a day from the three infected Ebola patients that were
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:24.680]  at Emory University so you can imagine if three patients create 40 bags of
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.120]  medical waste a day what would happen with a thousand patients or what would
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:32.920]  happen with you know five thousand patients I mean there's no possible way
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:38.680]  to control that much waste and the fact that there are only four hospitals in
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:43.520]  the U.S. that are technically qualified to handle pandemic outbreak and let's
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:48.560]  just go back it used to incubate over three days now it's 21 the virus has
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:53.760]  just mutated off the chart this is this is very suspicious yes you know the
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:57.280]  Ebola virus is kind of like the influenza virus because it will mutate
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.720]  and that's a reason why you know I don't know how you're gonna possibly come up
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:08.240]  with a vaccine with a virus that mutates like the influenza but you know what's
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.840]  happening also is that if you look at what's happening in well the whole
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.600]  quarantine thing has just been completely taken out of control we
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:19.680]  should have shut our borders to any type of flights but another topic that was
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.960]  that we talked about was the fact what's going on with the military over there
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:28.440]  why are we sending military when we should be sending doctors it's a
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:33.060]  pandemic with any doctors not military so what was reported back to me was it
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:38.880]  was kind of a drill to see how to quarantine for medical martial law in
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:43.880]  the United States with their literally going door-to-door the military pulling
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:48.160]  people out that have Ebola like symptoms and our military is definitely
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:51.000]  gonna get it and then that'll be covered up they'll use them for getting
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.680]  pigs as well and they're taking them to quarantine areas and now the family the
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:58.840]  families know this too so they're trying to hide people so that what this is is a
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:04.040]  plan to see how they're going to react into the United States it's to create a
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:08.400]  cadre brigade that's why it's 5,000 to come back and train the rest of the
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:12.080]  brigades yes and now what happens when you take everybody and put them in
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.920]  quarantine well all this is how the economy collapses real fast because how
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:20.280]  does the food get from the farm nobody wants to go to work if there's a
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:24.560]  quarantine and they can't leave their own homes so you have distribution that's
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.800]  that completely comes to a halt you have food production that comes to a halt the
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.820]  food can't get to the grocery stores you know every single worker all the
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:35.920]  waste workers the government workers don't go to work and when you take
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:41.640]  everybody away from going to work we're going to break it economy starts to
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:47.480]  crash it means societal collapse level event Dr. Evergripp's our guest in

[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:46.440]  doctors scientists epidemiologists virologists border patrol pharmacists
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:50.640]  developers chemists you're there talking to them and everything you're saying is
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.040]  already been separately confirmed you were talking about how in Africa they
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.960]  call these community care centers but really they're just death camps well
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.280]  that's even been in the back of the news that they just take them and lock them up
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:05.080]  behind barbed wire and shoot them if they try to get out but notice how they
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:09.120]  call the community care center and then now this model being used on the
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:13.440]  illegals to just disappear them and not talk about it that could be anybody next
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.760]  and once they set that precedent of just go arrest this person put them in a
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:21.920]  truck it's compartmentalized that can be the smoke screen for a political purge
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:27.000]  as well we've always said a big bio scare or a bio weapon attack or a natural
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.280]  pandemic could be the cover for the takeover one of the big ones and now
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:36.680]  right on time here it is dr. group can genium well you know that's from what
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.920]  we're hearing there really just nothing more than death camps over there but you
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:43.600]  know it's the media takes the they're obviously the media is not going to come
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.360]  out and say death camps over in Africa so they're gonna they're gonna call it
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.040]  community care centers and so you know it's the spin that you're getting over
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:57.080]  here that you know we're actually there trying to help and and trying to
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.080]  contain this by the way that you do have to lock them up and and things are
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:03.920]  breaking down and sorry if there's not enough food or water but but be honest
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.720]  about the tragedy do air lifts of food don't just warehouse them and kill them
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.240]  where's Jesse Jackson when you need him yeah exactly let me see some of the
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:16.880]  others if it does collapse then they're gonna spill out one of the other one is
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.520]  ahead of south com say three days ago we're gonna play the video coming up
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:23.080]  they said they could get in the South America collapse it is gonna collapse into
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:27.200]  us so are they beefing up the border what else I want to go any back into your
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.440]  list under root but what else did the Border Patrol agents say when you were
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.480]  watching videos and talking to them were they concerned you told me that they
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:38.260]  had confirmed and seen and talked to others that had seen exactly what he was
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:42.240]  saying and that they were literally pulling up in vans and suits and throwing
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.520]  people on the backs of vans and that border patrol would say well you got to
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.760]  fill out a form and they say no we don't I mean break that down what else did they
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:52.000]  say that's pretty much it I mean the only other thing that they were talking
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.280]  about was and I haven't confirmed this is that Homeland Security restricted all
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:02.240]  of the ammunition to the Border Patrol until 2015 that was actually confirmed
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.040]  no no that was mainstream news three months ago okay so that basically they
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.560]  were just talking about they won't supply them and they can't and they can't do
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.120]  their training or anything like that Homeland Security has almost three
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:15.720]  billion rounds now but the border patrol can't have any right guys type in
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.080]  border patrol ammo shortage it was I think bright Barton AP go ahead yeah
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:23.040]  basically what they were saying is it's just strange that the the CDC and the
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.600]  National Institute of Health has never worked with the Border Patrol before and
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.560]  then all of a sudden now they're down there and they're just taking you know
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:35.720]  anybody with symptoms that the border is just wide open we know that but they're
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:39.240]  trying to pinpoint people and they're just taking them somewhere I mean I
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:41.880]  don't know where they're taking them I guess to probably you deploy them to
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.200]  each school or everywhere spread it I'm not kidding I know probably to take them
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.360]  in different areas of the United States and that's another one of the things
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.600]  that we were talking about earlier is the doctors are reporting that they're
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.200]  getting patients in different areas of the United States with Ebola like
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:02.080]  symptoms and these are doctors I mean the people I talked to are very very
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:07.600]  well versed in pandemics disease scientists I mean these are guys that
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.240]  have been around for a while just like me I've been studying natural remedies
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:15.320]  for viruses bacterias pandemics all this stuff you know for years and years
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:20.200]  and years so you know really to give everybody solutions so what they're
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:25.000]  saying is that you know they're you know these guys are these scientists are
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.600]  telling me and these doctors are telling me that their friends are actually
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.120]  seeing patients that might have Ebola like symptoms and calling the CDC and
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:36.040]  the CDC's getting about 20 to 40 calls a day like I said I you know I don't know
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.760]  how to confirm that I'm just relaying what I heard oh and imagine they're
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:44.000]  getting hundreds of false reports an hour with panic going on in the country
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.280]  but if they're bringing in Ebola patients and they've now spread it in
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:51.560]  Spain if they're letting people fly in from West Africa it's a guarantee there's
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:55.040]  got to be more cases it's a guarantee it's gonna spread I mean this is
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:02.920]  incredible how do you why do you think government's doing this well looking and
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:06.920]  analyzing what happened with the swine flu and some of the other H1N1 stuff
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:12.880]  like that I think this is this is a test and it might be the big one I mean it
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.440]  might be that this is the one that they're really they set up all those
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:20.400]  government camps for if you look at every single piece of the puzzle you know
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.400]  the board what's going on at the border all the camps that have been set up the
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.400]  fact stay there let's come back to that when we get back yeah my gut has just
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:31.200]  been off the chart concerned the last year as everybody knows and notice they're
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.080]  dropping the border they're starting war with Russia they're turning loose al
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:37.600]  qaeda they're devaluing the dollar they're shutting off the power plants
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:41.080]  they're announcing our kids belong to them they don't seem to care what we say
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:45.360]  or do they don't care how unpopular they are they laugh at us are they getting
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.160]  ready to release an airborne strain I mean there's no telling what they'll do

[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:39.760]  World War two because they were following eugenics that our own
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:44.280]  government was following in the scientific arena eugenics pretty much
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:50.360]  changed the course of history in 1851 when Galton invented it the cousin of
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:55.240]  much of the top scientists at the time but Darwin and others and they developed
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:35:00.200]  social Darwinism and that's what we live under and so just be aware of it even
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.440]  if you agree with it it's a lot of elitists and want to be elitists to
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:07.280]  agree with it just know that it's happening and it's going on and sign
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.760]  on to it officially because the reason we don't trust the system is they've
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:15.680]  proven they're bad actors that doesn't we're not talking about a cop or the
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:19.920]  board of patrol or a doctor down the road those are great people nine times
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:28.920]  out of ten we're talking about the central system the main planners and the
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:33.640]  morbidity rate is about 91% in Africa granted the immune systems are lowered
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:38.000]  it's it's society's collapsing even industrialized areas here it's over
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.040]  50% you know this guy that died in Dallas a few days ago he he had western
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:49.960]  care he reportedly had the Ebola knew it came over here he died and let me tell
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:53.400]  you it is explosive that's why it spreads so fast it's not airborne
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:57.360]  supposedly yet that just means the virus doesn't live and goes to the air a
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:02.720]  long time but it will live in a sneeze droplet a mucus droplet or a cough
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:09.200]  droplet it will live if spit or saliva on the table it will live in feces or
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:13.520]  other things for days or vomit for days it can just live inside that little
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:19.840]  capsule live inside that goo live so roaches walk through it or or bats
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:23.080]  urinate or defecate and you breathe it that's how they think it's really
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:25.840]  starting to spread in Africa they think it's the bats that would be the answer
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:29.520]  if it wasn't man-made it's what most scientists are saying look it up I'm
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:31.960]  not just saying that's in the Washington Post you name it that the real
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:34.960]  scientists saying we think it could be quasi airborne because it's not
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:38.920]  technically but the bats are go to the bathroom when they take a flight they
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:45.320]  they have them in the air and then you're breathing it and if you even get a
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:50.720]  few thousand cases in the United States it'll be total pandemonium and I love
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.080]  my family and I personally have been trying to get more sleep sun boost my
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:37:00.960]  immune system eat healthier their studies out study shows how exercise
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:05.800]  protects the brain from depression is oxygenate the cells doctor group talks
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:08.520]  about that so I want to get more into your list of what these scientists and
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:13.640]  doctors were saying at this big internal private supply side expo in Las Vegas
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:17.720]  what the board patrol told you but let's talk about doctor group because I've
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:21.080]  been following what you say for over a year now with incredible effect I mean
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:26.600]  people that see me in person TV puts 10 pounds on you but I'm still 20 30 pounds
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:30.240]  overweight but I was 80 pounds 90 pounds overweight I mean I almost have no pot
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:35.320]  belly anymore just with a survival shield nasonide on x2 exercise more
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:39.920]  purified water the DNA for the super male vitality that's got all these
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.200]  compounds known to just I mean what it's done for me and my virility is amazing
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:49.600]  but what are you doing specifically for your immune system what were the other
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:55.200]  scientists and experts you were talking to what's the cutting edge right now for
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:59.480]  folks out there that are researching this well pretty much everybody's in
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:02.960]  agreement you know what you know planning is what needs to be done
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:07.400]  everybody families just have a plan you were telling me you're getting more
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:11.400]  storeable food during the break yeah storeable food clean water things to
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:16.280]  purify your water what the NIH the who what the the medical and government is
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:21.160]  not telling people to do is looking at natural alternatives you know they're
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:25.200]  not telling you to use iodine to purify your water they're not telling you to
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:28.560]  use silver to boost your immune system I mean though they're not telling you to
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:33.600]  look for natural ways out there because what they want to be able to vaccinate
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:38.160]  you my big question isn't one of the questions we were talking about is what
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.200]  could it because with this day you want to see you're gonna probably see with
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:48.080]  the executive order a mandated vaccine so the question is you know most people
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:51.040]  out there just they just can't wait you know they're they're already fast
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:54.240]  tracking vaccines that are supposed to be ready this week they're starting trot
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:59.460]  human trials on 20 different humans and my question below Melinda Gates her
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:06.880]  involved Monsanto I mean hello sorry yes and another subject I want to get
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:11.080]  into is the rabies Ebola vaccine and that's currently in the works by the
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:16.080]  NIH and Thomas Jefferson University with GlaxoSmithKline and that's
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.440]  scheduled to be finished with fast tracking by the end of 2014 and you
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:24.600]  remember what happened with the fast tracking of the swine flu vaccine which
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:27.240]  was given to like 30 million which it turned out was a
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:30.880]  stimulant released the year before basically an attenuated virus totally
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:35.560]  fake lowering your immune system of 50% Canadian government study right and
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:39.040]  now you have a lot of the children have developed narcolepsy and there's all
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:44.560]  kinds of brain deformations because of that back on record and GSK yeah they
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:50.560]  were sued three billion dollars for that and and lost the lawsuit but what what
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:55.520]  everybody's talking about internally is you know why this is going to take
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:58.680]  place and really what to do in case it spreads in the United States and that's
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:02.720]  have a plan to get out of a well populated area you know have some land
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:06.680]  somewhere you know they were worried that possibly the borders would be closed
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:10.560]  which I don't know if that's really gonna happen if they wanted to spread but
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.280]  have a good supply of clean water clean food and your immune system have enough
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:19.400]  stocked for your family of some of the natural things that are available that
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:24.640]  work for different types of organisms what are you doing specifically for
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:29.120]  yourself what I'm doing is I have a place to go that's that you know kind of
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:32.880]  close to a national force where I can just get out of there I have clean water
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:36.960]  over there I have clean food I have clean seeds to grow my own stuff I mean I
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:41.320]  have masks that I can use I'm not really worried about it because I'm not a
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:44.760]  strengthened my immune system but I have a good supply of iodine I have a good
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:49.280]  supply of silver over there and that's really you know the the two things that
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.640]  I would focus on specifically I've got a good supply of oregano oil over there
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:58.280]  oregano works really good I've been taking that and you know all the
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:02.280]  supplements that we usually talk about you know I've got the DNA force to
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:05.760]  protect myself to protect against free radical damage you know when your
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.240]  immune system goes berserk and you have a virus then you're also going to have
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:14.160]  you know the attacking of the virus by your immune system if your immune
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:18.800]  system strong I've always been a believer that we have the strongest medicine
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:23.400]  inside our own body I mean the first place you should look is inside and ask
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:27.760]  yourself is am I clean I mean 75% of your immune systems in your gut right
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.120]  there if your gut is healthy most likely your immune system is going to be able
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:37.040]  to attack and destroy any type of invading organism oxy powder infowars
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.640]  life comm I've got to say that's your most amazing product I think overall
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:43.440]  you've developed because you guys finally convinced me to do I didn't get that
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:49.760]  the oxygen tablets released in the guts unbelievable compared to kaito sand or
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:56.440]  roughage or those herbal stuff that would like burn not this it's just just
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:01.800]  absolutely pleasant and flushes you out I mean dynamite yes you know talking
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:05.160]  about Ebola but there's so many other things that have to be I'm just talking
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:09.240]  about plushing my guts out period right I mean but when you look at just the
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:15.200]  intentional destruction of the society's guts through processed
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:19.520]  microwaved foods through aspartame artificial sweeteners all the chemicals
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:24.680]  the GMO the BT in all these crops has its own pesticide that admittedly kills
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:28.520]  our flora right and that's you're reducing everybody's immune system right
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:33.080]  there by 75% because they know that 75% of the immune system is in the gut and
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:37.320]  they know the gut controls everything that's why they never show your appendix
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:43.360]  out what's a good probiotic probiotic that I use is called lateral flora and
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:47.600]  then I also recommend I don't sell the product but it's a product by Garden of
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:51.760]  Life it's called primal defense ultra and that you can get that at Whole Foods
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:57.160]  you know I've tested a lot of probiotics out there and the ones that I I just put
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:01.760]  people on those two with the oxy powder and that pretty much takes care of the
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:05.040]  majority of gut issues they have of course I want to get them off of gluten I
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.720]  want to get them off the things that destroy your gut I want to be clear
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:10.960]  folks from sunshine to clean water we're promoting a lot of stuff that we don't
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:16.560]  even sell because this is the real deal I'm here asking questions for me because
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:21.880]  I want my kids to be healthy I want my family to be healthy right the GMO foods
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:25.680]  get them off of that then again reduce your stress levels you know stress is
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:32.280]  linked to a deficient immune system by 50% and then you know have a preparation
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:36.880]  plan so you're not in a state of fear all exactly I've got the farmhouse to run
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:41.280]  to I've got the wall and again it's not that I was living in fear if there was a
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:46.160]  5% chance this could happen I you know was somewhat ready and then as it gets
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:50.520]  more and more clear the globalist are destabilizing civilization more and more
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:53.480]  I'm going to just accelerate getting prepared because we see government
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:57.760]  and corporations digging in building underground bunkers and the Ozarks you
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:02.360]  name it like it's the end of the world Joel Scalzen we'll get him on this week
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:06.560]  to get his take on all this guys are next week or Sunday or Monday he says
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:10.280]  he's never seen elites buying bunkers and hidden redouts and it's in the news
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:14.040]  the rich are all you know running to private islands and stuff why what do
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:19.360]  they know Dr. Group well they know I don't think all of them know that the
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:24.480]  real plan involved but the you know if they know they know the world's going
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:28.000]  in an unsustainable direction they definitely know that and with this
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.400]  it's hard to tell what's going to happen with the Ebola situation but it's been
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:37.000]  verified like you said that the home and security the CDC they have the
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.640]  coffins they have all the underground facilities you know they know that the
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:44.880]  Ebola can mutate into a very out-of-control situation and they're
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:47.680]  telling us everything's fine though they're telling us everything's fine
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:51.080]  that's when you know you're in deep trouble but you know they were fear
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:54.520]  mongering I'd feel good you're like oh okay they're just fair mongering but
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:59.840]  the fact that everything's wonderful everything is awesome well yeah like
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:04.120]  they have everything under control and then you look at like the movie 28 days
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:08.200]  later which was an Ebola rabies virus and now they're looking at crossing it
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:13.400]  and right well there's a link between and this is this was what one of the
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:17.880]  things we also talked about with one of the scientists that has been doing a
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:22.640]  research with Ebola and rabies and basically he was saying there's a link
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:27.480]  between the Ebola and the rabies virus because when you combine the Ebola with
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:32.760]  the rabies one of the rabies strains it gives you zombie-like symptoms and he
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:36.120]  was talking about that that was even in mainline science a month right and
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:39.920]  that's why they were doing drills you know in case we have a scenario like
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:43.120]  that doesn't like turn you into a zombie but you act like a rabbit dog
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:47.400]  that can give people Ebola exactly which is basically a zombie and the rabies
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:51.280]  Ebola vaccine that's the one that they're doing the trials on that they're
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:56.120]  fast-tracked for 2014 with the NIH and Thomas Jefferson University they're
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:59.920]  working with Black So Smith Klein oh my god and they're scheduled to be done with
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:04.920]  trials by the end of this year with the with the rabies Ebola vaccine now why
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:10.680]  would you could why would you start giving people a rabies Ebola vaccine for
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:17.520]  a supposedly Ebola strain that's out there affecting people right now it
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:22.160]  could there be a mutation when when you line up millions of people and well
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:27.160]  that's what the rabies that's what the top brain surgeon medical doctor just
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:30.800]  last week Dr. Blalock was saying he says it's been proven that it's causing
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:35.520]  bacteria and viruses and mutated the vaccines are doing that right right
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:39.320]  that's that's the scary part of it if you inject millions of people with a rabies
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:45.120]  Ebola knowing what happens when someone you know contracts rabies Ebola when you
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:51.040]  mix the strains together that could literally create a cannibalistic you
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:55.040]  know zombie-like society and that's uncontrollable and that you would have
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:59.200]  to shoot each person which you know you know then what are you going to do with
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:03.440]  it like you said the Ebola can live in the body fluids for a long time we now
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:07.640]  learning semen for 70 days and you know think of all the time things people
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:11.320]  sneeze on they touch someone else walks by think about money alone I mean
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:14.840]  someone touches money think how many times that changes hands they don't
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:19.400]  have sterilization procedures in place for money the bathrooms the public water
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:23.320]  systems I mean yes by there's so many chemicals in the public water system
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:28.560]  anyway that it might kill it but if it mutates into airborne situations do you
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:33.680]  have a plan see that the scary thing is I would like to quarantine my family and
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:38.840]  my myself but if they're coming door-to-door military and going through
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:42.920]  your house like Nazi style and then that's perfect covered these is just on
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.640]  a list go ahead and pick up Dr. Group and his family doesn't matter if you're
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.760]  not showing symptoms plus you might not want to be around a bunch of soldiers
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:52.640]  that just rousted 500 houses that week who've probably got a bowl of themselves
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.520]  yeah they're just the soldiers just gonna spread it well now you're a
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:00.080]  terrorist right and then I'm gonna be taken away from my family and put into
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.800]  government-controlled camp somewhere we know those kids well that's why MSNBC
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:07.440]  was bitching last week they said we can't do door-to-door stuff during Ebola
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:11.000]  because of the Second Amendment and that is a point well they can I'm not going
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.200]  any FEMA camp under martial law they can do whatever they want though yeah but
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.920]  the people it's gonna blow up it's gonna blow up I mean I you know that's why
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:25.160]  they're they're trying to do the gun confiscation and everything else because
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.000]  they don't want the people to turn on them but I think you know just like what's
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  happening in Africa like we were saying this is a test the people in Africa are
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.920]  turning against them and starting to fight now they're trying to hide their
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:39.640]  family members and everything because they know if you go in as soon as they
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:43.840]  pull you out and take you to a quarantine location you're gonna get it you're done
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:47.560]  I mean what are they gonna give you they're gonna experiment with you on all
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:51.640]  kinds of vaccinations it probably gonna you know if you do survive inside the
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:55.080]  quarantined area then they're gonna use you as an experiment they're gonna be
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:57.920]  taking your blood and spinning it and you know looking at your DNA that's right
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:01.760]  the globalists are crazy scientists everything they do is an experiment man
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:05.760]  group you know your stuff briefly I want to shift gears into some of the info
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:11.520]  wars health.com info wars life.com products info wars life.com the DNA
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:16.620]  force the supermail vitality the survival shield nascent iodine X2 we're
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:19.160]  sold out of the silver bullet we got a whole bunch of it though come in about a
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:24.160]  week and a half I mean obviously I personally am trying to cleanse my body
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:28.280]  but it's ongoing separate from all of this tell folks a little bit about DNA
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:32.720]  force why it's so special and the X2. Yeah I will talk to you but you brought up a
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:35.320]  good point because one of the things that the scientists were talking about
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:40.280]  and I actually talked to somebody that said that secretly the government is
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:46.600]  buying up to 6,000 gallons they want like 6,000 gallons of silver a week for
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:52.160]  stockpiling and inside information with different agencies that are trying to
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:55.400]  stockpile a lot of silver. Is it true that there was an army study about
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:01.080]  soil silver? There was a study done in 2000 I think it was 2009 by the
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:07.280]  Department of Defense on Ebola and silver and they it was declassified and
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:10.440]  you can actually pull that article up. Why don't they want people talking about
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:15.600]  it just anybody they're so exactly I mean why it's just like we've had cures
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:19.720]  for cancer for you for you know 15 20 years but you have to go outside the

[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:05.200]  about X2 the nation I had I and about why you were telling me specifically DNA
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:09.760]  force is so important to me and system I mean I with all the research that we've
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:13.360]  done over the years on iodine is just one of the things that I think every
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:16.960]  single person needs not only for water purification because of the fact that
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:20.560]  we're all suffering from endocrine disrupting chemicals were exposed to
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:25.040]  different chemicals all day long every day in the food the water the air and
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:30.520]  thyroid problems thyroid problems are just increasing day after day after day
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:35.440]  pregnancies mental retardation you know the calcification of the pineal gland
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:39.800]  that's going on the children that are being born with mental illness are not
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:44.600]  fully deformed fully formed brains there's so many conditions that can be
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:50.480]  tracked back to iodine deficiency inside the system so we can officially say
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:55.320]  when the federal government managed to be put in IQs on record went up 15 points
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:57:00.200]  listen that's like New York Times headline and you know talk in kind of
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:03.320]  linking that to a bowl I mean remember about I think it was six months or a
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:09.080]  year ago where the Department of Defense or the military put out a request for
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:13.760]  something like 300 million doses of potassium iodide or something yeah guys
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:19.720]  type in iodine study IQ boost it's like AP Reuters business insider I want to
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:22.880]  just show TV viewers that listen all those underground facilities they're
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:26.200]  stocking up on iodine down there and they're stocking up on silver they're
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:30.720]  not stupid they know they know the things that are resistant to practically
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.680]  any type of bacteria or microbe or anything that's that can affect the
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:38.680]  human body they know how to strengthen their immune system so and plus those
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:43.640]  are very inexpensive ways to do that so my arm was chopped open on time or my
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.360]  finger was cut off they just poured that medical iodine all over it right
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:53.160]  that's what they do that yeah because it's strong you know antimicrobial but
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:58.560]  talking about just a majority of negative health conditions out there from
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:05.840]  and I mean from energy to infertility to sterility to not being able to to
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:11.160]  function mentally to stress I mean you name it you can probably link back iodine
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:15.520]  deficiency absolutely to one of guys punch up my computer you just put in
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:20.840]  iodine and the IQ discover magazine how adding iodine to salt boosted
[01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:27.080]  Americans IQ the effects of iodine on intelligence and children NCBI iodine

[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:06.720]  through them quick 800-259-92 31 dr. group let's go to kelly in texas kelly
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:11.600]  thanks for calling in you're on the air thank you so much for taking my call and
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:16.720]  I bet you both I've been doing a lot of research on this a bola and I've read
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:20.640]  that where of course you've already said colloquial silver is a good combatant
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:25.560]  to take and also that I read and I wonder if dr. group had heard about this
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:31.640]  a natural ingredient founded in foods that we eat is called selenium that could
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:38.600]  also help and also it's awful it's awful blatant that they bring patient zero
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:44.120]  over here right at the beginning of the inocule fluid inoculation season and
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:50.120]  that it's Ebola use the immune system against itself that's how it works
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:55.560]  therefore bringing down everybody's immune system 50% of Texas flu shot and
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:02:00.880]  also wanted to ask if Alex or you either one heard about the shipments of
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:06.600]  colloquial silver that were sent to Africa and stopped before anybody in the
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:12.040]  United States had it and it was sent back three times and never arrived in
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:18.160]  Africa dr. group thank you caller a lot of great points kelly actually I know
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:22.920]  the people that sent the silver over there and they had already contacted some
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:28.440]  doctors in Africa to do some testing they sent it over there it was flagged it
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:33.880]  was stopped by the government it was not allowed in the incredible and I can
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:38.320]  definitely verify that story for you I mean because then it's something that
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:42.560]  some pharmaceutical company can't patent right even though pharmaceutical
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:45.360]  companies are on record are coming out all their other patented silver stuff
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:50.760]  yeah there's no money in it you know it's it does to do silver the right way
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:55.440]  it takes a long time and really the best form of silver is going to be a high
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:03:01.920]  produced using a high volts voltage AC current so it's definitely something
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:05.760]  that I would put at the highest point on the list you mentioned selenium I would
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.200]  also say zinc you know selenium and zinc are really good for the immune system you
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:13.080]  should stock up on those as well there's a lot of different things out there
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:17.640]  vitamin what fruit is the best overall to just give you a lot of stuff
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:23.960]  acai fruit you know I kind of look at the readily available things you know in
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:30.360]  seasonal but any type of any type of live organic food that you eat especially
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:35.040]  if it's picked really fresh off the tree is going to do your body a lot of good
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:38.000]  it's gonna provide you with the nutrients and it's gonna provide you the
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.040]  enzymes and all the stuff that you need to support your immune system so it's
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:46.040]  really more but big pharma says that's not true all we need is big pharma and
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:50.600]  shots every day with it's a conspiracy theory that we even need good food or
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:54.320]  even oxygen like they're now saying oxygen may not be needed and that's a
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:58.920]  conspiracy that all we need is GlaxoSmithKline well it's just like the
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:04.760]  USDA and the government approving Dow's new herbicide yesterday the day before
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:09.520]  the 2-4-D the mixture with glyphosate after there was 80,000 scientists that
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:13.760]  wrote in and and all kinds of congressmen to to try to get it banned and
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:18.360]  what do they do they they approve it so you know the the design is for them to
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:22.160]  create these chemicals create these endocrine disruptors create all these
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:26.720]  things to actually cause you to become ill cause your immune system to go down
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:31.840]  so they can go on the back end and prescribe you medications you know
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:37.920]  doctors visits stuff that addresses doesn't ever address the root cause only
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:42.160]  addresses the symptoms and causes you to be in a dependency state to your
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:45.720]  everything they do is about the welfare all of it be dependent on them
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:50.320]  don't teach you how to fish but give you a fish tainted fish we'll be right back

[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:19.120]  deity a false God and to pull down and desecrate that God of political

[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:32.320]  streets of Ferguson were literally on fire last night and it's spread into
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:37.360]  st. Louis Curtin demo has a story on info wars.com I'm pointing out this could
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:41.960]  blow up big time over the weekend we're also going to have our reporters down
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:47.680]  the border investigating the CDC scooping up people that are ill and
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:52.880]  showing how it's wide open to Jay Johnson it says that it's not wide open so
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:56.800]  we're gonna go prove that he's a liar oops he might get me he's a big thug I
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:01.600]  have no free speech yes I do even if you say I don't I'm gonna exercise it so
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:06.200]  that's all coming up Dr. Group we're about to go right back to the calls but
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:11.640]  other points that you may have forgotten to make before we go to Karen and others
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:16.920]  well I mean no really other points that I except for the fact that we just need
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:21.320]  to watch this whole thing really closely to determine you know what's
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:26.720]  going on my now try not to be fearful and try not to create any fear mongering
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:32.000]  anything but my probably my greatest fear if you want to call it a fear is if
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.920]  we get to the point where they're coming door-to-door and they're
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:38.360]  quarantining because then you're helpless unless you know there's a mass
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:44.040]  revolution and we you know resist that but I mean for them the to have the
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:47.320]  ability they already have the executive orders in place I mean literally with a
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.600]  if you're showing signs of respiratory illness they can they can you know
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:57.800]  quarantine you know take you to wherever the local you know whatever the
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:02.280]  closest camp they have set up is I mean that's you know that's probably my
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:06.920]  biggest situation because then I'm I'm stuck I can't do anything for myself you
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:11.480]  know I'm stuck in a situation away from my family where you know I might just
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:14.560]  have to just get out of the United States if that's even possible they might
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:18.600]  lock down the borders I mean I've had calls you know a lot of people call them
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:21.720]  off is just saying what do I do I mean are am I gonna even be able to get out
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:25.720]  of the United States by the way since you mentioned that we haven't played this
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:30.240]  video clip I'm gonna play it and then go to phone calls we reported the text of
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:35.120]  this three days ago it first broke but now the video is up on info wars dot com
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:41.600]  the commanding general of South com in the world split up into regions Ebola
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:47.320]  outbreak in Central America could cause mass migration to the US and now South
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:53.720]  com is in the news today saying it could be in Brazil right now we know it's in
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:59.720]  Spain and other areas because folks are running from Africa mainly across West
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:06.440]  into the Americas and so boy I tell you that is that is not some good news if
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:11.080]  that is the case let's go ahead and play a clip of the commanding general general
[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:14.840]  John F. Kelly here it is back to the Ebola thing I'll just tell you a story I
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:19.960]  was down in Costa Rica a couple weeks ago talking to our embassy personnel one
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:23.160]  of them relayed a story to me they were standing on the border between Costa
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:27.520]  Rica and Nicaragua which is not really a border I mean it's all free flow if you
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:30.920]  don't have a the right papers you can just for a very small amount of money
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:34.560]  moved through the border but there were five or six black guys that were there
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:38.080]  at the border waiting in line to pass into Nicaragua and then on the way north
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:41.520]  and the embassy person walked over and just asked who they were and they said
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:47.000]  well we're from Liberia but on a road about a week and we're on the way to
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:52.680]  New York City illegally so they're on the network they had flown into I think
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:56.960]  Trinidad and then met up with the traffickers and now they're on the way
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:03.080]  in they could have made it to New York City and still be within the incubation
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:08.320]  period of of Ebola so I go back to this issue and I've highlighted this this
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:13.160]  issue in Washington that if it is an outbreak in the Caribbean particularly
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:18.400]  or in Central America it will it will make the 68,000 unaccompanied children I
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:25.680]  think look like a small problem. General thank you for that. That is just killing and you see
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:29.200]  guys like him that are shooting straight and he compared to the head of the CDC
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:32.400]  or Obama said there's no big deal everything's fine I mean what planet
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:36.600]  are they living on? I don't know what's going on at the the World Health
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:41.760]  Organization, the National Institute of Health, the CDC, the Homeland Security,
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:47.200]  the FEMA you know all of them it's just like they don't even know what the
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:52.360]  other one's doing I mean you know it's just a complete nightmare I mean there's
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:58.680]  there's no organization they're not even taking the proper steps to contain the
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:04.040]  waste products you know put you know the in the just the guy that died in the
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:08.080]  apartment they sent the kid one of the kids in the apartment to school it was
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:12.320]  okay for him to go to school. Didn't clean the ambulance? They're not you know
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:16.120]  they're not wiping anything down I mean. This guy's spraying bloody poop everywhere
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:20.040]  vomiting blood everywhere I'm sorry to be gross I mean these people just explode
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:24.340]  stuff and it's just all no big deal right yeah I mean I'd be surprised Dr.
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:29.560]  Griffith he hadn't spread it in Dallas. Yeah I'd be surprised too I mean we'll
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:33.640]  see in the next couple weeks I mean you know really we're gonna see what's gonna
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:38.680]  happen come about the 1st of December maybe mid-November I mean that's gonna
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:41.800]  be the the television. If it starts spreading that'll sort of happen in the
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:45.880]  next week it's a 21 day but then the government will try to cover it up. The
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:48.760]  government will try to cover it up but if you know we were looking at all the
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:52.560]  different vaccine trials and everything and everything pretty much ends to you
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:56.720]  know or starts at the beginning of the year. Looks scripted. It does look scripted.
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:04.160]  Yes so I mean everything and as a matter of fact even in 2003 the New York Times
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:10.400]  reported that there was some Ebola vaccine a test on number on in 2003. Well
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:13.680]  when I saw Bill Gates his name back then I said look out here comes Ebola on
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:17.720]  air right I mean it's just pure evil. So it's not like you know they haven't been
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:21.160]  testing Ebola vaccines they've been testing Ebola vaccines and own the
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:25.160]  patent on the Ebola strains for a long time you know and they prepared us with
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:29.320]  movies like outbreak and Ebola and all these 28 days later and all the zombie
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:33.240]  movies and all this other stuff so you know it's conditioning of the mind and
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:36.720]  then seeing how far we're gonna take it. You know doing test drugs. Yeah because
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:39.560]  they're clearly trying to have plausible deniability with open borders and the
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:43.280]  planes still come in. They clearly want to spread. Right. I mean there's no debating
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:47.000]  that now. But they're always gonna test everything. They always test everything
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.440]  in these African countries because you know these are poor families these poor
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:54.280]  environments no one's ever you know there's not a lot of media over there
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:57.800]  it's not going to get out it's kind of secretive. It's like testing it's like
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:01.080]  giving black people syphilis. Nobody will believe if they complain just shoot
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:05.360]  them up just you know. Right and a lot of the testing goes on you know back in
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:08.720]  the jungles in Africa you know the originally with that's where the
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:12.800]  Pentagon's got the testing facilities. Right the HIV testing a long time ago and
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:17.160]  the AIDS virus and all that stuff and Ebola all that's usually tested in these
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:21.160]  jungles in somewhere in Africa. Something tells me we're not gonna hear about
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:27.880]  this from Al Sharpton though. He's too busy race pimping. Well he's talking about it so.
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:31.680]  Oh Jesse Jackson says it's racist that this guy didn't get treatment. No that's
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:35.160]  what hospitals do now they just turn you away. Well the thing is all of our
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:39.280]  hospitals are already full anyway with all the degenerative diseases and the
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:42.960]  flu-like symptoms I mean and now people you know especially around Dallas and
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:46.920]  and and all throughout the United States because of the bowl if they get a cough
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:51.880]  and a respiratory situation which is actually going around now because of
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:57.280]  all the contaminated vaccines you know how do you you know there there's no
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:01.840]  room in any hospitals right now anyway if the if the Ebola thing takes on and
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:06.360]  it starts to become a real pandemic and people start coming down with it there
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:10.360]  are no hospitals to go to people there's you know this is crazy let's go to
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:14.880]  call camps I mean let's talk to Karen in Florida what's wrong with the camp don't
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:18.600]  be racist Karen you're on the air well right it's it's not a camp it's just a
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:26.280]  care center it's not a death panel it's a loving yes go ahead oh hi there Mr.
[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:32.080]  Jones welcome we're five five-year listeners and I just wanted to let you
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:37.040]  know that we also have the nation iodine the oxy powder and we also bought the
[02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:40.320]  water system thank you because that funds our operation their quality products
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:49.720]  thank you ma'am totally awesome and what we wanted to know is the gloves for
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:56.440]  money we know that the American dollar travels all over the place and we're
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:04.080]  starting to wonder when would be a good time to start using gloves for cash or
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:10.000]  you know what are we gonna do in a case like that and I think that's a good
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.960]  point if it really starts spreading you are a mask and gloves but wouldn't the
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:15.800]  Ebola down a few minutes on money I think you're talking about somebody who has
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:19.800]  it sneezing on or having their hand passing it to you at the register right
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:25.280]  dr. group you know that's a that's a good question and there's a lot of a
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:28.280]  controversy out there right now it's what one of the things we're trying to
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:33.640]  figure out is how long does the Ebola virus live in fluids like let's say for
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:37.440]  example you go to an ATM machine and you have the Ebola virus well your body
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:42.920]  fluids are gonna touch the the little pat the keypad on there how long will it
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:45.560]  live well there's a lot of different factors you know is it gonna be in
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:49.240]  contact with direct sunlight because if it's in contact with direct sunlight it
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:53.440]  will probably kill the virus the money right now you know the reports from
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:58.280]  scientists that I've talked to are coming back saying anywhere from five to
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:03.160]  20 days up to 70 days what you were talking about that the Ebola virus can
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:09.640]  live in bodily fluids outside the body now we're coming up on winter too so if
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:13.120]  you you know since you're in winter since a lot of places there's not as
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:17.200]  much sunlight it's natural that people's immune systems go down over the
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:21.080]  winter months they're not exercising they're eating Thanksgiving meals you
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:26.240]  know they're eating more sugar eats that vitamin D B12 they're lacking B12
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:30.800]  they're lacking vitamin D you know so you know it's a perfect storm really when
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:34.040]  you think about it because all these things are coming together at once at
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:39.120]  around the same time so as far as I don't have an accurate answer but I can
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:44.480]  tell you that I would just say that the Ebola virus could possibly live in
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:48.200]  fluids outside if it's not in direct so sure they're saying it may be going
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:51.760]  airborne we don't know ma'am we'll try to figure that out but it's
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:54.840]  it's definitely serious because the government is like trying to aid and
[02:19:54.840 --> 02:19:58.200]  embed it basically and by the way they do make gloves that have that are made
[02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:02.320]  we gotta go to break we gotta go back to Jay and others it's already too late

[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:06.160]  right now let's go to your phone calls jay and delaware you're on the air go
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:15.360]  ahead hello yep hey how you doing thank you alex and dr. group for your dedication
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:20.520]  thank you brother honor um my question is for dr. group and i'll take my answer
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:25.720]  off the air come at work what would you what's supplemental regiment would you
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:30.560]  recommend for someone who has hepatitis who does not want to do the
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:36.640]  interferon treatment well what i would recommend is you find a good doctor in
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:41.600]  your area maybe somebody that has experience with different types of IV
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:48.440]  bags ozone ultraviolet blood irritation somebody that can work with you that has
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:53.360]  experience in you know utilizing some of those compounds my personal
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:58.400]  experience you know just some of the things that we've used to help support
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:07.160]  people with hepatitis are reginal silver iodine i'm not saying that that's you
[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:12.960]  know obviously i can't state anything you know that would work on any disease
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:16.680]  because i've already been you know rated and almost arrested and thrown in jail
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:23.320]  for making claims but those are things it can definitely be worked on if
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:27.240]  effectively if you find the right doctor in your area no doubt about it and the
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:31.920]  interferon that they give they give in such high doses that it's it's really
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:36.160]  not it can actually be damaging to the body there was a company in switzerland
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:40.320]  that was producing a low-level interferon product that we used to use
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:44.760]  with some really good success but another thing out there that you might
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:50.040]  want to look at is called MMS is a miracle mineral supplement and read up
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:54.800]  on that as well and again though i mean no doctor can sit there over the air and
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:59.880]  specifically diagnose somebody got to test kind of look at them but thank you
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:03.840]  so much caller let's go ahead and talk to anonymous in oklahoma you're on the
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:08.200]  air hello gentlemen how are we doing today good brother thanks for calling hey
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:11.840]  i got two things for you i've got a source that works at the hospital here in
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:15.440]  oklahoma city that they recently i heard you speak about earlier saying that they
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:20.360]  were being tested for the Ebola virus yes sir that's in the CBS news report
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:24.200]  oklahoma city hospital isolates patient exhibiting possible Ebola symptoms go
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:28.520]  ahead my source on the inside says that as to work they worked there and
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:33.560]  admitting there and said that they have this individual has been tested it came
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:37.600]  back negative good she's under under a psych evaluation because this individual
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:42.360]  had said that she was exposed that intercourse with an individual who was who
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:46.280]  had thought they had Ebola and they took no uh they didn't take any precautions
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:50.320]  there's gonna be a lot of craziness that comes out of the scare as well exactly
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:52.800]  and also one more thing Alex you know how we you've talked in the past about
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:57.440]  how they project what they're gonna do before they do it with movies films you
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:01.520]  know the pain in Colorado and the airport there i don't know if you guys
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:07.880]  have been watching this it's a show on FXX called the screen it is a new take on
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:14.560]  a uh vampire story by Guillermo del Toro he's doing it the symptoms of these
[02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:18.680]  people when they're infected by this vampire they have muscle spasms and
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:23.000]  their eyes turn red the CDC is involved in this show they are completely
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:28.080]  incompetent there's one individual in the in the in the storyline who has seen
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:32.040]  what's happened he's trying to wake other people up and they basically said

[02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:47.360]  make it about the poor folks that own the property they were stored on like we
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:50.440]  were blaming them no we weren't we were just pointing out what these were being
[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:56.480]  used for what and why the CDC was storing them but before we go there they've
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:34:01.920]  had different media organizations and MSNBC come out and say that it's racist
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:08.560]  to call Ebola obola and I've been saying that for weeks you know the term
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:12.200]  Ebola many other people have we're also seeing pop-up bumper stickers and signs

[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:18.440]  and what you do is you shoot video of it and then you put it on YouTube we link
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:22.400]  to the different videos people watching by the millions you know big videos get
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:26.720]  seen a million times small ones 5,000 so what that's a big deal you go up you

[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:43.680]  you do they'll go it's horrible man and arrest them just to show how they want
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:47.560]  to violate free speech when that happens and the local news covers it then they

[02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:43.680]  do you think of this contest? Well I think it's a great contest I think as
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:48.480]  many people I mean that listen to the show should get involved in it and it's
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:52.480]  just like that's what we do every single day is answer questions about and tell
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:55.760]  people how to get involved that you know stopping this I agree with Michael
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:39:00.120]  Savage actually because you know this could be the takedown of the globalists
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:03.600]  I mean look at the military they're sending in what surprises me is that the
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:09.440]  the military personnel they sent in to Africa did so with no resistance you
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:12.360]  know we don't even know that they wouldn't tell us yeah if I was in the
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:15.640]  military and they tried to send me into a hot Ebola zone I don't know if I would
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:19.920]  you were in army special operations you would have said no well it was pretty
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:23.160]  brainwashed back then so I don't know what I would have done but I would
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:26.720]  definitely say no now that's for sure I mean I get military personnel calling me
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:30.520]  all the time saying that you know that have problems I've got a guy in Houston
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:33.760]  that's breaking out and all these weird rashes and all kinds of stuff I use them
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:39.240]  as guinea pigs you know so so yeah I would you know get as many people that
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:43.400]  can get involved and start telling people the truth about Ebola and what I
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:46.000]  mean I almost don't even want to offer money in the contest but that makes it
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:52.320]  fine this isn't fun it's war in fact I'm gonna go out Monday or maybe even today
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:56.000]  and I'm gonna hang up a bunch of these posters around town you know as a promo
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:00.280]  video for this but it's about you taking action and tying the president who's
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:04.680]  leaving the borders open and letting the flights come in to the Ebola so they
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:08.760]  get the blame they may back off if they see that you're giving pushback but if
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:13.040]  we lay there like jellyfish they'll walk all over us new story up at info wars
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:17.080]  dot com and prison planet dot com CDC mandates her medically sealed caskets
[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:20.720]  for Ebola victims revelation follows report of CDC storing thousands of
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:26.000]  airtight coffin liners in Georgia the CDC has instructed funeral homes to bury
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.200]  of all the victims that are medically sealed casket that's what we told folks
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:33.760]  five years ago a potentially disturbing revelation given reports the federal
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:37.560]  agency had previously purchased thousands of airtight coffin liners which
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:41.440]  were being stored in Madison Georgia outside Atlanta Yahoo news report
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:45.200]  reveals how the CDC is instructing funeral homes that remains should be
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:48.680]  cremated or buried promptly in her medically sealed casket which must be
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:51.880]  secured against the escape of microorganisms and have valid
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:55.520]  documentation for being airtight Dallas Institute of funeral services
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:00.080]  administrator Wayne Cavender said the CDC is worried about an epidemic but the
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:04.520]  type of caskets they were recommending were not airtight these in Georgia are
[02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:08.480]  ladies and gentlemen and you've got more from your sources they're calling them a
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:13.400]  cremation box right they're calling a multifunctional cremation containers and
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:18.240]  there's actually a patent on that you can probably bring it up there was it
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:21.120]  I can't remember what year was patented in I think it was in this there it is
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:26.720]  multifunctional cremation container and for cadaver and it breaks it down the
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:36.280]  US patent number 08 slash 069 comma 980 1995 yeah the thing with a bowl of
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:39.880]  patients is when whenever they start getting close to death though it's the
[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:46.120]  violent diarrhea the violent vomiting and the in the violent Rachel Maddow we
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:49.160]  don't call we don't have a bloody diarrhea it's called right it's called a
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:54.280]  Rachel Maddow they have violent Rachel Maddow right so I mean if you think
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:58.240]  about really how to contain it it would be almost to the point where you would
[02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:01.600]  have before the patients get to the point where they're uncontrollably
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:06.040]  bleeding before they go to uncontrollable Michael Moore they really need to be
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:09.400]  killed like before you know this is what they're saying is they need to be put
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:12.680]  in some sort of a casket or possibly quarantined or in some sort of a room
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:17.240]  with other people because that's when it really becomes a problem is towards the
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:21.560]  end when they're losing body fluids everywhere so you know the reports hey
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:24.000]  they say let everybody in how about we send all the Ebola patients to the
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  White House well there you know there you go I mean who knows what the White
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.800]  House is you know the obvious the White House isn't doing anything I mean
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:36.520]  Obama's holding meetings with all the the African leaders and everything right
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:40.880]  now or up at Martha's Vineyard for a long time it's just like they don't care
[02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:45.480]  what's going on obviously they're not out there talking about it and you know
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:48.880]  the organizations that are supposed to be holding the quarantines and helping
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:52.360]  people out aren't doing anything about it's all about fast-tracking vaccines
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:56.360]  and having something ready by the first of the year so I mean you know you know
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:43:00.000]  the predictions I mean they're predicting that in January there
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:03.920]  could be one over a million cases of Ebola one point four and one point four
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:11.640]  and five so you know it's just more of a reason to start taking responsibility
[02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:14.600]  for your own health start cleaning yourself out I totally agree let's
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:18.080]  let's go to calls now I've been hogging the time here ladies and gentlemen real
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:22.960]  fast ask your other questions Peter from Washington okay this this product I
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:29.400]  won't tell the brand is mitochondria energy optimizer and they keep bringing
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:35.920]  in new ingredients the question I have they do have bio PQQ there is 10 MG's
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:41.760]  enough daily well yes I mean what we've done with the DNA forces we've taken all
[02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:46.600]  that we've already done 15 years of research on what the best anti you know
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:51.680]  graceful aging supplements are stuff that are going to protect the root cause
[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:57.240]  of aging see companies out there are you know you might be addressing one thing
[02:43:57.240 --> 02:44:00.440]  you might be addressing another thing but what we're doing is addressing why
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:05.960]  the telomeres are shortening why the cells are replicating faster than
[02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:10.400]  normal and all that is due to too many toxic chemicals that are surrounding the
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:13.640]  cell and the extracellular fluid or chemicals that are getting inside the
[02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:18.800]  cell so our approach is you know that and we have the bio PQQ and the DNA
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:24.640]  force is to address the root cause of cellular damage and the root cause of
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:28.760]  cellular damage is too much too many chemicals and too many free radicals and
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:32.360]  that's why the antioxidant levels are there that's why bio PQQ has been
[02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:38.560]  proven in clinical trials to help stimulate nerve growth factor that's
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:42.360]  why that's why myself and others if you have damaged nerves of my torn Achilles
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:45.840]  a hand that's been broken a finger that's been chopped off I noticed when I
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:50.040]  started taking it those areas got numb and then the feeling came back more and
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:53.440]  then in my Achilles it's now like electrical and some of the feeling came
[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:58.280]  back but it's frankly quite weird and scares some people and I get why this is
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:02.200]  psychoactive this this is real nutraceutical I mean we spend hundreds
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:04.960]  of thousands of dollars just to get the stuff that goes in it they have to like
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:08.320]  sign deals with Misha Bishi and everything I mean this is not a game
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:11.800]  this is the real deal it's the real deal and I don't know what product you're
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:15.400]  talking about but I mean it's it's not about just one ingredient either it's
[02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:20.560]  about combining six or seven or eight or nine proven ingredients that all work
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:26.280]  CoQ 10 is very trans resveratrol I mean look there's there's probably 20
[02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:30.080]  different types of resveratrol out there but there's only one 99% pure
[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:35.880]  trans resveratrol you know it's like our bio PQQ and all this this is organic
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:41.240]  this is the you know manufactured America source right I mean this is all of
[02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:46.440]  the ingredients that go into this product DNA for us especially have you
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:49.600]  know years and years of clinical studies and research behind them so they
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:53.720]  are all linked on infowarslife.com in fact to be technical people should go
[02:45:53.720 --> 02:45:57.560]  there and read what's patented it what we are allowed to say no people don't
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:01.120]  aren't allowed to say this because they don't have this stuff this is real stuff
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:04.880]  thank you so much we got to move quicker to the calls folks Chris and mass
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:09.160]  you're on the air go ahead yeah I just wanted to advocate some of the products
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:14.880]  that they've really worked for me I'm a professional musician I sing and play
[02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:19.280]  guitar and gig out all the time and since you had Dr. Wallach on the show and
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:23.480]  some of the longevity products like Tangy Tangerine I had a cold in in like
[02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:28.320]  two years and you know it's just tremendously helped me you know not
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:33.960]  only that I used to get heartburn acid reflux all the time and and through
[02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:40.560]  listening to Dr. Wallach and you know using digestive enzymes probiotics and
[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:45.680]  now the the oxy powder is really pretty much cured that for myself so I just
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:49.640]  real simple you know Wallach and the organic beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0
[02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:55.040]  from infowarshealth.com you know he's saying you need 90 things trace
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:59.560]  elements and minerals and vitamins well the government's saying only a few like
[02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:03.080]  we're a plant or something and so of course stuff like that it is just so
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:09.720]  incredibly health I mean it's been a life-changing for me that the the iodine
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:13.560]  to give you a funny story I used to have in a I don't know ever since I started
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:18.240]  taking the iodine I had this in back I play guitar and I had these have this
[02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:23.680]  embarrassing work on my middle finger that I could not get rid of whether I'd
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:28.440]  try to freeze it off or or whatever and since I started taking the iodine it
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:32.560]  just the thing just magically disappeared I mean in my immune system is
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:37.000]  just so much better well look I mean if I'm no doctor scientist from all the
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:40.760]  literature I've read it simple if there's basic deficiencies if you don't
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:45.600]  have oxygen you die if you don't have item and see you get curving and die
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:50.240]  even if you don't have iodine you will die and they just keep lowering the
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:54.720]  level of what you need until someday I guess the FDA will say zero it'll be a
[02:47:54.720 --> 02:47:58.080]  thought crime if you say you need it and this is not rocket science what we
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:01.400]  promote here we just promote what we believe is the purest most powerful
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:06.560]  ancient source crystal source everything else is seaweed source look the
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:11.240]  other stuff that we and it's great does it turn into a gas in a petri dish on a
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:17.040]  hot plate the stuff we use is so pure it it it's not called aerosolizing what's
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:20.760]  the calls when something gasses it's called sublimation yes I mean it's
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:24.880]  amazing I mean it's like a purple ghost or something I mean this stuff just goes
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:28.720]  into your body I mean I don't want to go into details here but what came out of
[02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:34.120]  my skin I mean I wasn't tanning before I was just burning now I get really good
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:38.040]  tans less sun and now it doesn't happen anymore I guess I've detoxed just stuff
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:41.520]  just poured out of my skin well I don't use for every single cell in the body
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:45.880]  and it's you know it's your skin your endocrine system your neurological system
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:51.880]  all any type of cysts it's you know when you're when you take away that the big
[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:56.600]  thing is with extra extra iodine is it blocks the absorption of the harmful
[02:48:56.600 --> 02:49:00.840]  halogens like chlorine fluoride and bromine so really what you're doing is
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:03.480]  hopefully you know you're not just getting what you need you're blocking the
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:06.960]  bad stuff exactly I mean hopefully everybody's learned enough by listening
[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:11.120]  to your show to avoid fluoridated water sometimes you can't though I mean look
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:15.320]  all the drinks out there to you know the the colas and stuff those are all made
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:19.280]  with fluoridated water there's so many other sort of food have it added chlorine
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:22.720]  is out there the bromine is out there and breads I mean if you eat at a
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:27.200]  restaurant you're going to get fluoridated water look go to any coffee
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:30.200]  shop in the United States right now you know I'm not saying any names but you
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:35.320]  know the most popular ones they use tap water to brew all their coffee so when
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:39.160]  you go in for your latte or whatever your venti or you know whatever all
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:43.720]  you're doing is number one you're taking the coffee beans which are heavily
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:47.840]  sprayed by pesticides and so you're getting pesticides and then you're
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:52.480]  getting the tap water in your system so by you taking the proactive approach of
[02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:57.080]  doing this is what we're trying to get all you know people to do take a
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:01.400]  proactive approach listen I said about to find out what is the hiding in plain
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:05.080]  view most powerful stuff that they don't want people to know about and
[02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:08.760]  understand but that the elite are taking and that's what in fours life comm
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:14.240]  products are about 888253 3139 and you know a couple times a month we do we

[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:44.920]  time caller I just want to say I appreciate your show very much appreciate
[02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:49.880]  you I am less I am less afraid of Ebola I am more afraid of the government
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:56.240]  response to Ebola and kicking down our doors and hauling us off to the FEMA
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:00.040]  camps by the way of which I just discovered or heard that we have another
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:04.480]  FEMA camp that I was unaware of just just south of Phoenix here and you know we
[02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:09.000]  have a lot of FEMA camps here in Arizona so that that is scary and by the way
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:12.600]  when I when I speak to you I spoke to a couple federal agents over the weekend
[02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:16.200]  and they they get it most of the people I talk about I tell them we're living
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:21.760]  living in pre-Nazi Germany or pre-World War 2 Germany well that's the thing I'm
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:26.160]  always over the years bashing the feds and people and never really the military
[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:29.240]  but they were trained in to take us on but it was that training that woke them
[02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:35.040]  up cops feds in the military going in the order of military cops and then feds
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:38.120]  feds not so much they're more brainwashing on power trips but a lot
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:41.680]  of them compared to the public they're more away Dr. Group isn't that
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:46.720]  exciting listen when all of the you know the federal the high-level federal
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:51.960]  agents and even people in Parliament and the royal family in Europe they all
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:55.760]  know and they cut I know because they cut some of them call me I actually had

[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:05.520]  confidentiality to get treated you know to do the stuff that we were doing when
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:08.520]  we had our before our cancer clinic got raided well that even leaked out in the
[02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:12.440]  news later down in Houston I remember yeah it did and I mean I mean you could
[02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:16.680]  pull up of me the case is the FDA that have tried to you know attack me what's

[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:39.120]  broken bones I had people when I had my clinic CIA FBI training facilities that
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:42.640]  would come to me for high-tech treatments when they you know broke their arm
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:46.440]  they needed to heal it within a certain you know two weeks or whatever so no
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:51.120]  they know the high-level officials they know where to go and it's not the
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:55.480]  hospital I mean you know they know that them they know what's going on with the
[02:56:55.480 --> 02:56:59.760]  medical system they know what's going on with the pharmaceuticals they know now
[02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:04.680]  if they have some sort of a lot of times with acute injuries emergency
[02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:07.840]  situations our house was rude that's a great point but what was your other
[02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:12.720]  point I apologize yes I have a specific question for after group actually two
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:18.360]  questions doctor group I have my family oil the Reginald fact I just placed in
[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:23.920]  their other order for survival shield today and a colloidal silver at 240 parts
[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:29.680]  per million I've got boys elementary school age and of course my wife and
[02:57:29.680 --> 02:57:34.960]  I can you make a recommendation as to what dosage amount I should be giving my
[02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:39.280]  family of those three items in preparation for for something so
[02:57:39.280 --> 02:57:45.440]  virulent as Ebola and also second question I've heard the N95 mask won't
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:53.520]  protect us from Ebola so what should we be using as a mask well you know that's
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:59.080]  that's the million dollar question right there they have a recommended mask I
[02:57:59.080 --> 02:58:02.400]  forget the name of it's one of the bubble over your face yes it's a it's a
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:08.080]  biological filtration mask and from what I've heard there's you know there's some
[02:58:08.080 --> 02:58:12.560]  people are selling on eBay and Amazon you might be able to pick some up there
[02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:17.600]  some of the military style masks do I think you know is that really going to
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:20.640]  protect you I think it's going to be better to get in a force somewhere where
[02:58:20.640 --> 02:58:26.320]  there's high oxygen levels that the virus can't survive as far as the your
[02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:32.040]  questions about dosages I'm not really allowed to talk about dosages but one
[02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:36.760]  thing I do for oregano oil that I found really kicks in your immune system is
[02:58:36.760 --> 02:58:40.560]  about nine drops five times a day nine drops three times a day thank you so

[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:43.040]  final calls quick question Lucy thanks for holding her on the air with Dr. Group
[03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:51.480]  all right Lucy's gone let's talk to Carolyn in Tennessee you're on the air
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:57.840]  retired nurse yeah hi you hear me I'm on speaker I can change to not whatever
[03:00:57.840 --> 03:01:02.160]  just go ahead oh you can hear me okay you know I can't tell you how many times
[03:01:02.160 --> 03:01:05.800]  I've gone into a room two or three days and then after that they tell me the
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:10.360]  patients got tuberculosis and we need to use a mask you know the people don't have
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:14.080]  to be admitted with a diagnosis of the ball they could be admitted with a
[03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:17.760]  diagnosis of something else yes nurses are gonna be going in and out of those
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:22.240]  hospitals and taking that with them and then I'm wondering if they don't like it
[03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:26.320]  when we call in sick they don't like it one little bit so they're gonna want you
[03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:31.520]  to come in anyway and so you're coming in out now what when it gets really bad
[03:01:31.520 --> 03:01:35.040]  are they gonna start forcing the nurses and the other staff to stay in that
[03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:43.080]  hospital are they gonna say no you can't leave they they will definitely require
[03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:46.920]  the health care workers to get vaccinated with the new Ebola vaccine
[03:01:46.920 --> 03:01:51.240]  there's no doubt about that I mean but the thing is that you bring up a good
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:55.560]  point because that's another subject we talked about at these meetings I was at
[03:01:55.560 --> 03:02:01.080]  this week there are health care workers registered nurses nurses everybody in
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:05.040]  the hospital that have been calling for training they feel like they're not
[03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:09.360]  being trained they haven't been trained on how to deal with this how to protect
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:13.520]  themselves how to deal with potential patients that are coming in and they're
[03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:20.360]  calling the CDC and getting together and trying to round up training because here
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:24.520]  you have the potential for a pandemic and you have health care workers first of
[03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:28.240]  all like we said four hospitals which are really you know trained to handle
[03:02:28.240 --> 03:02:33.240]  this type of thing and now you have all these health care workers all over the
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:37.560]  United States and all over the world that haven't been trained on how to hand
[03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:41.480]  there's another point that just hit me if they to shut down flights from West
[03:02:41.480 --> 03:02:44.960]  Africa a month and a half ago like England did in France this guy would
[03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:49.200]  never have got here I mean it just shows they know the default position would
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:53.080]  stop this but they don't care the question is why I bless you man appreciate
[03:02:53.080 --> 03:02:58.360]  your call only got time for one more Jennifer sorry to Dave and Bill let's go
[03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:02.920]  ahead well I might get to Dave too but Jennifer real fast go ahead my question
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:09.840]  was Dr. Groups thought on diatomaceous earth diatomaceous earth is great I've
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:13.800]  used it for as long as I can remember I've given it to my pets it helps you
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:17.160]  know I've never given my pets any type of heartworm medication or anything like
[03:03:17.160 --> 03:03:21.880]  that those are the skeletons of diatoms yes now it's just important on where
[03:03:21.880 --> 03:03:25.760]  you get it I use perm a guard I mean they're Omri listed it's a good company
[03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:33.400]  and yes I have use it internally it's it's great for specifically worms but it
[03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:37.560]  also helps clean out your system I got a job real fast thank you Dave in Florida
[03:03:37.560 --> 03:03:43.800]  last caller go ahead hi Alex I hope you're doing well it seems you're doing
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:48.280]  well I have a question for Dr. Groups first regarding the super male
[03:03:48.280 --> 03:03:53.200]  vitality if you can just give me a quick you know maybe one paragraph
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:59.600]  explanation on why a young male like myself at 25 I will be interested or
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:04.240]  should be interested in taking a supplement like this well there's so
[03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:09.120]  many estrogen members out there already that that you may not know I mean you
[03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:12.320]  won't know till you take it but I would challenge you to get some it supports a
[03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:15.480]  broadcast regardless and I just took some more when you mentioned it because let
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:19.120]  me tell you I noticed it when I don't take it especially in the morning I'm
[03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:22.840]  sorry go ahead it just really depends on what you're exposed to and what you
[03:04:22.840 --> 03:04:26.600]  have been exposed to for your whole life you know we start really seeing a
[03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:31.240]  hormone decrease in men right around 25 to 28 years old you start seeing your
[03:04:31.240 --> 03:04:36.200]  testosterone levels go down DHEA levels go down your growth hormone levels go
[03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:40.400]  down so and at the same time we're exposed to all these phytoestrogens and
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:44.040]  we're in an estrogen dominant age sorry out of time Dr. Groups thanks for
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:48.280]  spending two hours with us great job great job of the crew if you want
