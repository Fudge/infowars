[02:02.960 --> 02:07.440]  amazing rock and roll record they didn't play the drums or learn how to play the guitar do all
[02:07.440 --> 02:12.960]  that work stand up at night government did in fact that pelican right there behind me can't
[02:12.960 --> 02:22.720]  even fly without who without Obama there I'm telling you folks the sun shines because well
[02:22.720 --> 02:28.880]  he's criticizing evil evil entrepreneurs and look at that little girl I bet she's even proud of
[02:28.880 --> 02:35.720]  what she built there but he pops up like an evil leprechaun and says no no no Kim Jong
[02:35.720 --> 02:42.960]  on did I think there is a video ladies and gentlemen up at info wars.com where I worship Kim
[02:42.960 --> 02:48.240]  Jong Il and Kim Jong Un I notice they've got to be trolls on YouTube a lot of people think I'm
[02:48.240 --> 02:55.040]  I'm serious in my worship okay if you don't understand it satire it's not like when I endorsed
[02:55.040 --> 03:01.840]  Obama two days ago in that video I mean it's wildly oh thank you for Valhalla in heaven you
[03:01.840 --> 03:06.640]  you make the grass grow the birds tweet oh thank you for going after the evil founding fathers
[03:06.640 --> 03:15.280]  and helping destroy evil America it's not serious it's called satire when I do satire it's over the
[03:15.280 --> 03:22.000]  top and it's obvious that it's satire and you know what I enjoy satire I think it's a way of not
[03:22.000 --> 03:29.040]  going completely insane with rage I know a lot of people out there do as well but that is a sad
[03:29.040 --> 03:34.880]  issue but there it is Alex worships Kim Jong Il very important video it's a 30 minutes of solid
[03:34.880 --> 03:40.000]  worship by the way by the way continuing here you've got to see it it's a little girl with
[03:40.000 --> 03:47.360]  what are those dupla blocks or whatever I know my four-year-old has those evil dupla blocks
[03:47.360 --> 03:52.240]  that's like the beginner for Legos and they get very proud and they build something but again
[03:52.960 --> 04:00.720]  the North Korea spirit that Obama channel says no no in fact in North Korea one commenter did
[04:00.720 --> 04:06.560]  point out that Alex in North Korea and by the way I've confirmed this is true if you say something
[04:06.560 --> 04:12.000]  bad about the leader you basically have given not just yourself your whole family a death warrant
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.720]  they punish entire families in North Korea if you commit a crime there or bad about the leader

[04:21.760 --> 04:27.600]  I mean the leader made the grass grow the birds I mean they actually say in North Korea that the
[04:27.600 --> 04:31.680]  leader makes it rain of course they don't government here wants to control the weather now so they can
[04:31.680 --> 04:37.600]  be god I mean TSA has to you know do things to prove you're loving people have been sent to

[08:19.920 --> 08:25.920]  against status control freaks and the mega central banks funding a giant collectivist
[08:25.920 --> 08:34.720]  drooling masses of zombie servants of control freedom we are live and transmitting worldwide
[08:34.720 --> 08:43.760]  on xm 166 blasting out on over 115 a.m. and fm affiliates global shortwave w w c r twitter
[08:43.760 --> 08:49.440]  facebook info wars dot com prison planet dot com number one talk radio podcast out there
[08:49.440 --> 08:57.120]  on roku boxy itunes number one on the audio streams on so many fronts thank you so much
[08:57.120 --> 09:03.760]  for joining us liberty is popular we're going to be talking about that coming up because
[09:03.760 --> 09:08.800]  the authoritarians want to shut down your free choice on the web because they cannot compete
[09:08.800 --> 09:14.480]  even in the stilted playing field with big mega globalist funding msnbc and the rest of them they
[09:14.480 --> 09:22.000]  are stunted jokes that almost no one watches and the people that do watch them are either wealthy
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.240]  limousine liberals who made money off government contracts who who want to just hear how they're
[09:26.240 --> 09:31.600]  superior all day and how everyone's idiots but them because you know that's that religion or
[09:31.600 --> 09:36.320]  people that are so poor from government control on the reservations they live in the plantations
[09:36.320 --> 09:42.560]  they live in that they can't buy anything from the sponsors so it has to both be uh you know uh
[09:42.560 --> 09:47.120]  billa melinda gates ads that fund these type organizations we're going to be talking about
[09:47.120 --> 09:53.200]  some of that today because because the system is panicking obama front group attacks drugs for
[09:53.200 --> 09:58.240]  linking to info wars political establishment in dc upset with internet maverick and in case you
[09:58.240 --> 10:04.880]  thought i was just joking george soros routinely gives upwards of three million dollars a year
[10:05.440 --> 10:10.000]  to think progress and i did the math when i saw this this morning i talked about it yesterday
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.840]  but watch and actually went and fared it all out i knew i'd seen it in the federal filings for
[10:13.840 --> 10:20.000]  nonprofits that poses uh watchdog groups it's run by the white house they have meetings at the
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.920]  white house same thing with media matters that poses as a watchdog i mean talk about the fox
[10:25.920 --> 10:32.000]  guarding the henhouse and this is a joke how they try to dictate reality to everyone when i did the
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.360]  math this morning on google analytics and two other systems just quickly with an online calculator
[10:37.360 --> 10:43.120]  according to alexa media matters and think progress this is the biggest audience they've
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.360]  ever had him when they get plugged on msnbc were much bigger and they're a joke but i mean it's
[10:47.360 --> 10:50.800]  important to talk about what a joke they are and how they think they dictate reality only to those
[10:50.800 --> 10:55.200]  in a trance state though people are waking up and realize you know the whole thing's a total fraud
[10:55.200 --> 11:02.720]  drudges 91 times bigger alexa you break down the numbers then both their sites combined and uh
[11:02.720 --> 11:10.000]  uh when i did the google analytics and broke down the numbers it's over 100 times so so here they
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.440]  are dictating and they say to the mainstream media they say you need to go after drudge
[11:18.320 --> 11:22.800]  for his his sneakiness linking to alex jones and joseph farah and others
[11:24.320 --> 11:28.560]  as if as if it's not out in front of the like like like they're telling you oh it exists now
[11:28.560 --> 11:35.520]  because we've done a year-long study of this evil and it just shows that total disconnect with
[11:35.520 --> 11:41.280]  reality that these people have and how they think they control reality you know what you do is you
[11:41.280 --> 11:46.080]  control our tax money and then it goes to the robber barons like soros and then he feeds you
[11:46.080 --> 11:51.120]  and they say in there we've got to get alex jones at info wars.com off of drudge because that's
[11:51.120 --> 11:56.160]  funding all of alex jones is evil i went and checked with the account yesterday i just mean
[11:56.160 --> 12:03.280]  i already basically knew but i i would estimate that it is true the drudge report probably
[12:03.280 --> 12:10.640]  advertising wise probably brings in about seven percent of the capital coming into here oh i'm
[12:10.640 --> 12:15.440]  sorry you thought we had like one sugar daddy like you do george soros or we got a couple it says
[12:15.440 --> 12:21.360]  the white house groups and people that actually work i mean the the transition team had uh i mean
[12:21.360 --> 12:26.560]  i mean actually everybody at i mean it is the white house but it just let me realize that
[12:26.560 --> 12:32.400]  this is another great success kind of like a year ago two years ago technically year and a half ago
[12:32.400 --> 12:38.800]  whatever it was in the uh spring of 2011 so year and a half ago we reported off the texas power
[12:38.800 --> 12:42.880]  commissions and others that the power plants being shut down was going to cause rolling blackouts
[12:42.880 --> 12:47.760]  and massive power increases it was all over the local papers and drudge picked up our well
[12:47.760 --> 12:52.240]  bibliographed and sourced article and the white house responded and said it wasn't true we were
[12:52.240 --> 12:59.360]  insane an evil unmentionable conspiracy site linked to by drudge they said at the white house
[13:00.400 --> 13:06.000]  the white house press secretary or communications director j carney responded and just said an
[13:06.000 --> 13:11.440]  unspeakably horrible website linked to by the drudge report yes i was so unspeakably horrible
[13:11.440 --> 13:15.520]  that you're shutting down power plants that general electric doesn't own and we had links
[13:15.520 --> 13:20.080]  where you've just given general electric waivers so they didn't have to comply with all their competition
[13:20.080 --> 13:24.400]  did and a three billion dollar power plant in corpus christi that was built over seven years
[13:24.400 --> 13:29.920]  that you won't let us turn on and now we have to buy our power from mexico during hot and cold
[13:29.920 --> 13:34.720]  periods extreme hot extreme i mean it was all it was such a devastating article and they just
[13:34.720 --> 13:42.240]  couldn't stand it to let america know they're gang raping you and so they flounder and flounce
[13:42.240 --> 13:47.760]  the white house doesn't like what we're doing so everyone remember that with the dirty tricks and
[13:47.760 --> 13:52.400]  things we go through and right on to the washington post calls up yesterday one of their senior
[13:52.400 --> 13:59.200]  writers and says uh starts getting into the fact that i'm pushing the birther thing and is that you
[13:59.200 --> 14:04.880]  know basically dangerous and and i was like my god you you got white house walking orders didn't you
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.840]  and then i had more calls coming in from national media i mean it's like somebody at the white house
[14:09.840 --> 14:14.720]  said go after this guy because we've had it happen before it's just it just you can see how they get
[14:14.720 --> 14:20.400]  the orders and then boom it just starts and then they went on the article oh it's so horrible drudge
[14:20.400 --> 14:24.880]  covers the birth certificate issue you mean how we linked to the uh associated press yesterday
[14:24.880 --> 14:33.040]  covering it i mean this is news folks this is this is news yeah there's ms nbc if you're watching
[14:33.040 --> 14:42.800]  on prism planet dot tv in gold i mean it literally isn't even registrable there is info wars many
[14:42.800 --> 14:51.920]  times bigger in red and there is a drudge report in blue that's just on alexa but i'm not i'm not
[14:51.920 --> 15:00.960]  gonna get into it anymore again this is literally like a ant telling an elephant what to do but
[15:00.960 --> 15:06.080]  but this is their attitude they are the anointed they know and they don't care if you don't want
[15:06.080 --> 15:09.680]  it they don't care they have a nine percent approval rating they don't care if you're against
[15:09.680 --> 15:15.680]  drones or the tsa they don't care when the texas legislature voted unanimously in the house to ban
[15:15.680 --> 15:21.520]  the tsa's groping people just to enforce the law what did obama say he said we're gonna put f16s in
[15:21.520 --> 15:28.480]  the air with a military blockade of an aircraft i mean you people are flaming authoritarians
[15:28.480 --> 15:35.440]  there's nothing liberal about you and again if you go to info wars dot com we have an image
[15:36.240 --> 15:39.600]  in fact i'll show people the front page of info wars dot com if you're a radio listener go there
[15:39.600 --> 15:46.080]  right now again we're streaming all this at prism planet dot tv if you go there you can see our
[15:46.080 --> 15:53.600]  little graphic that we basically knocked off somebody else's a little bit better a font there
[15:53.600 --> 16:00.000]  it says you didn't build that and the image is a real image of obama looking like some type of
[16:00.000 --> 16:09.120]  ghoulish entity uh staring at a little girl who's just built a lego tower and he's telling her you
[16:09.120 --> 16:13.040]  didn't build that i'm because that's what he's saying in fact can we queue up obama again
[16:13.040 --> 16:19.200]  the video and where he says government did it government did everything no government takes
[16:19.200 --> 16:26.480]  our tax money and gives it to select interest who's in deploy technology with backdoors in it
[16:26.480 --> 16:32.720]  which ends up i've had top scientists on like uh david stallman which end up screwing up the
[16:32.720 --> 16:37.440]  programs i mean they admit microsoft programs don't work very well because they've all got
[16:37.440 --> 16:43.040]  backdoors and i'm reporting back to microsoft that's why for a long time apple has been so much
[16:43.040 --> 16:51.120]  better not that it's even perfect but it didn't have as many backdoors built into it now it does
[16:51.440 --> 16:55.680]  let me tell you i was a pc guy for a long time in the last 10 years my wife got me on the max
[16:55.680 --> 16:59.760]  and i'm never going back now i've been getting on the linux and that's even better the problem
[16:59.760 --> 17:04.160]  is so many of the programs out there aren't open source built for it but i'm i'm slowly getting into
[17:04.160 --> 17:11.440]  linux by the way let's get dr stallman back on he's always a cornucopia of knowledge he's he
[17:11.440 --> 17:18.320]  agreed he said he'd come back on after he went to asia for a while okay so again this story is not
[17:18.320 --> 17:24.160]  about the the ant that roared over at the white house front group by the way i was on the phone once
[17:24.960 --> 17:30.400]  this is the same group whenever media matters there's got all these white house actual staff
[17:30.400 --> 17:34.000]  working there call me up and i said listen you're funded by george soros in the white house the guy
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.880]  laughs said no we're not that's a conspiracy theory and i pulled up online the federal filings
[17:38.880 --> 17:44.160]  i said george soros 3 million here 2 million there 1 million there uh this guy's white former
[17:44.160 --> 17:48.560]  white house communications director this guy's former transition director this guy was a deputy
[17:48.560 --> 17:54.000]  head of the campaign and they went oh i don't want to talk about that i mean this was the
[17:54.000 --> 18:00.400]  head guy the editor i was like dude i'm not one of these blind sheep that you can just get away
[18:00.400 --> 18:04.800]  with telling them whatever you want but see they operate in this whole world where they've

[33:55.120 --> 33:59.760]  by the way we're going to get the head guide from ministry back on the show he is a listener
[33:59.760 --> 34:05.520]  our incredible graphics guy makes a lot of their album covers kade and just amazing music imagine
[34:05.520 --> 34:11.920]  back in the 80s late 80s exposing the new world order hey we're getting close to the end of 2012
[34:11.920 --> 34:17.360]  Al thinks the world's gonna end so uh i'm gonna have him back i think right before and then right
[34:17.360 --> 34:24.480]  after when the world doesn't end oh boy i tell you who knows it might though is crazy she's globalist
[34:24.480 --> 34:31.760]  i certainly hope that's not the case but hey kim jung un is god in idly hill decide over in north
[34:31.760 --> 34:36.480]  korea even though they can't build a new ottoman build themselves or anything i thought the state
[34:36.480 --> 34:41.040]  builds everything in fact again on the front page of info wars dot com we have today's featured
[34:41.040 --> 34:45.680]  story graphic there it's a real photo of obama the little girl that says you didn't build that
[34:46.320 --> 34:51.280]  it's a little hard little lego set there and again that's how asinine what he's saying is
[34:51.280 --> 34:56.560]  that's i mean you go out and plant a garden and grow it you didn't build that you didn't grow that
[34:56.560 --> 35:00.320]  you go out and make a record you didn't do that you go out and learn how to play piano you didn't
[35:00.320 --> 35:06.160]  do that uh you uh go and take you know a couple years of uh martial arts and then learn how to
[35:06.160 --> 35:12.000]  do some pretty amazing things you didn't do that you go out and start a business a restaurant
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.080]  and bust your butt 12 14 hours a day and become successful you didn't build that
[35:16.080 --> 35:21.680]  but let me tell you when you fail investing all your money the iris still comes after you
[35:21.680 --> 35:28.080]  and takes your house then then no they want you dependent until they collapse the country and then
[35:28.080 --> 35:32.400]  all the illegal aliens and the welfare people they're up the creek without a you know what
[35:34.240 --> 35:38.800]  and of course tsa following the policy obama has legalized many of the illegal aliens they're
[35:38.800 --> 35:45.440]  allowing them to vote uh do do anything they want now the tsa is announcing that this is a story
[35:45.440 --> 35:51.360]  up at info wars dot com tsa signs off on flight school owned by illegal alien and the illegal
[35:51.360 --> 35:56.320]  aliens went to a school owned by an illegal alien i mean the only way to get rights in this country
[35:56.320 --> 36:00.960]  is to become an illegal alien because i guess the globalists are like these unoid world government
[36:00.960 --> 36:05.680]  immune people then they just see anybody they're using to bring down the us is their comrade
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.960]  so there you have it there you have it but boy as a citizen i mean i get treated like i am
[36:14.960 --> 36:20.480]  al-qaeda i mean i'm not al-qaeda i'm not being landed by you know nato ships in triple e to blow
[36:20.480 --> 36:26.640]  things up i'm not being brought in by nato to attack syria i mean i'm not i'm against amour al-akhi
[36:26.640 --> 36:32.400]  hanging out secretly at the pentagon and that's why i'm a bad man i told you all these years and
[36:32.400 --> 36:36.720]  now it's going in in europe there's tv ads here about how great it's going to be oh have you heard
[36:36.720 --> 36:41.760]  the new thing uh there's gps built into all the new cars globally it just so happened to happen
[36:41.760 --> 36:46.480]  it's not a big plan or anything and then we're going to tax you by the mile on top of your gas tax

[37:56.720 --> 38:03.440]  every day now i see prestigious respected publications that sound like alex jones has
[38:03.440 --> 38:08.000]  now taken them over but you see alex jones didn't take anything over alex jones read what the
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.960]  globalist have said and i've played the clips of all these world leaders from von rumpi to you
[38:12.960 --> 38:19.680]  name it calling for world government and i've read you the quotes i mean they've had george
[38:19.680 --> 38:24.080]  soros groups come out and say i'm lying that john p holdren called for sterilants in the water he
[38:24.080 --> 38:32.240]  just wrote four books saying it yo we show you the book the quote blow it up and they're like
[38:32.240 --> 38:38.480]  this is incredible lies the slander of this person no they think you're idiots are you idiots
[38:39.840 --> 38:44.240]  are you idiots do you like being idiots we went down and talked to obama supporters two days ago
[38:44.240 --> 38:47.200]  we're going to premiere it tonight on the nightly nose would have had it last time there's just so
[38:47.200 --> 38:52.640]  much footage and they're just like he is just so real like i met him at the fundraiser oh my gosh
[38:52.640 --> 38:57.760]  he's so good i mean this is like one of the women that got in the car with ted bundy he's
[38:57.760 --> 39:04.000]  such a nice man nice suit nice tie remember watching the ted bundy trial the second one
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.720]  after he escaped once for another murder and the judge you've seen it on tv is like you're such a
[39:08.720 --> 39:14.400]  nice young man you could have gone another path why you could have been you could have been my
[39:14.400 --> 39:20.400]  my assistant you could have been my son-in-law you're so i like you i mean these people it's like
[39:20.400 --> 39:26.800]  people have this a lot of weak-minded people do not instinctively want to run over tyrants want to
[39:26.800 --> 39:37.440]  crush them okay a lot of these cowards they have cognitive dissidents learned helplessness with
[39:37.440 --> 39:45.680]  a core of stockholm syndrome and that's what they do and when they get scared by something they
[39:45.680 --> 39:54.640]  decide to grovel to it well not me not me and by the way let me tell you how the universe works
[39:54.640 --> 40:00.560]  when you don't grovel is when you become empowered and enlightened all of you that wonder why you're
[40:00.560 --> 40:04.720]  such pathetic jellyfish you know some of the new listeners out there driving along in their cars
[40:04.720 --> 40:12.160]  whatever you wonder it's because you live in fear ladies and gentlemen and fear is infected it is
[40:12.160 --> 40:21.520]  it is it is it is transmissible it is a vector it it it spreads it is a disease but again i just
[40:21.520 --> 40:25.360]  want to notify the white house it's time to because you're the gatekeepers and you control
[40:25.360 --> 40:30.480]  reality so if you tell us that obama's against the ndaa then we learn he actually had his lawyers
[40:30.480 --> 40:36.240]  ride it and then he promises to not sign it to kill opposition and then does sign it i mean i better
[40:36.240 --> 40:41.440]  just go with the first thing i was told the ndaa is not law and obama did not sign it because i'm
[40:41.440 --> 40:51.280]  going to believe my president even though he did sign it what is that sound oh that's the sound of
[40:51.280 --> 40:56.160]  government creating milk and honey put on screen it's it's the crying when kim jong il died
[40:59.440 --> 41:01.680]  you built everything everything's collapsing
[41:01.680 --> 41:11.680]  and if i don't if i don't cry properly my me and my entire family will be executed to
[41:11.680 --> 41:22.400]  send to a forced labor camp by the way this went on for three days
[41:24.080 --> 41:29.360]  i'm sorry please get that off screen it's like nails on a chalkboard earlier you were playing
[41:29.360 --> 41:33.040]  that during a break i was like oh that's i was around the corner go that's that's fake weeping
[41:33.040 --> 41:37.200]  and wailing that's even worse you know when you catch your children doing something really bad
[41:37.200 --> 41:40.000]  they're further getting in trouble and the fake crying starts you know like stop that
[41:40.640 --> 41:47.360]  my oldest daughter all right enough of that guys the point is is that we need we where is
[41:47.360 --> 41:52.400]  george soros and white house posing as watchdog groups and then lying to the public and saying
[41:52.400 --> 41:55.920]  they're not fun about the white house or george soros because they think you're all stupid i mean
[41:55.920 --> 42:01.760]  we need them right now to go after the hill i mean ratification of law the sea advances world
[42:01.760 --> 42:05.280]  government what that doesn't exist even though the globalists are bragging in hundreds of
[42:05.280 --> 42:10.720]  publications that world government's been established ratification of law the sea advances
[42:10.720 --> 42:17.280]  world government ratification of united nations oh this is written by vice admiral robert r munrow
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.480]  oh man the extremism is just spreading and by the way he goes and quotes the actual document
[42:22.480 --> 42:27.760]  that's even that shows even more of the mental illness ladies and gentlemen in fact we need to
[42:27.760 --> 42:33.280]  just you know i now support north korea's model because obama said the state built everything
[42:33.280 --> 42:37.040]  you can go to info wars dot com and see a photo of him there you didn't build that little girl with
[42:37.040 --> 42:43.280]  the legos so we need to have this entire america which is what they're doing collapsed so they can
[42:43.280 --> 42:49.200]  bring in true communism we need to scrub and disinfect this entire thing and here's judge
[42:49.200 --> 42:55.200]  mail from caddy shack given the order because he knows best ladies and gentlemen he is such a good
[42:55.200 --> 43:05.280]  person i want the entire pool scrub sterilized and disinfected oh look look they found a little
[43:05.280 --> 43:20.160]  government minion a tsa agent it's okay nothing to worry about it's no big deal
[43:21.920 --> 43:27.920]  are you my pal denny all right now now get get boss hog ready but but let me just continue
[43:27.920 --> 43:31.120]  here ladies and gentlemen's we're gonna have they don't like i've learned the globalists don't
[43:31.120 --> 43:36.640]  like being made fun of that's the number one thing that upsets them they want to be taken very
[43:36.640 --> 43:42.000]  seriously they want you to be scared of them and they did just like george soros has think
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.040]  progress was like media it's time to go after drudge and teach him you know even though he's
[43:47.760 --> 43:53.600]  do dwarfs all of them even the new york times now it's time to show him that we know we caught him
[43:53.600 --> 44:00.400]  we caught him linking to bad people we control reality not you we do we i mean this is how
[44:00.400 --> 44:06.880]  pathetic they are call their bluff they're a bunch of chicken neck authoritarian control freaks and
[44:06.880 --> 44:12.720]  confident good winners aren't trying to control people so we just let them run the planet it's
[44:12.720 --> 44:19.920]  time intellectually politically to stop them into the ground let me continue though here it's
[44:19.920 --> 44:24.000]  it's horrible the news of the global corporate government taking over is getting out there
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.600]  how will they ever have their global corporate government when it's hiding in plain view if
[44:27.600 --> 44:32.960]  we say we don't want it but we're supposed to just have it being set up in plain view and all the
[44:32.960 --> 44:36.640]  publications saying it's great but then if you say you don't like it it doesn't exist and you're
[44:36.640 --> 44:43.280]  crazy and i'm supposed to just go oh well george soros and media matters said so so so which almost
[44:43.280 --> 44:48.720]  no one visits even look at their traffic rank it's like a small newspaper in a small town i mean
[44:48.720 --> 44:54.880]  literally a joke 50 plus employees tens of millions a year spent and they can't even get any attention
[44:54.880 --> 45:00.160]  because no one likes you no one wants to be around you everyone hates you that's why you
[45:00.160 --> 45:05.280]  want to fluoride and dump everyone down with your government schools so we're all a bunch of drooling
[45:05.280 --> 45:11.600]  sycophants lower than you because you're piles of crap and you feel bad about yourself just give
[45:11.600 --> 45:18.000]  up and realize how bug-eyed and pathetic you are just look at yourself go look at yourself in the
[45:18.000 --> 45:27.360]  mirror go out in public everyone hates you i mean it's obvious come on stop poisoning our
[45:27.360 --> 45:32.560]  water and telling us we should die and reduce our population you are projecting yourself loathing on
[45:32.560 --> 45:37.920]  us globalist and your minions okay i'm not for suicide i wish you'd wake up and join humanity
[45:37.920 --> 45:43.440]  but you know what before you kill more of us and try to trick little kids you know into taking
[45:43.440 --> 45:47.920]  Gardasil shots that ends up killing a lot of them or having 12 year olds go get abortions without telling
[45:47.920 --> 45:53.440]  their parents why don't you just kill yourselves how's that sound okay before we die how about you
[45:53.440 --> 45:59.360]  get off the planet all your reeducation can't plans and the rest of it hey you people can't
[45:59.360 --> 46:04.240]  tie your shoelaces the only reason you've gotten so much power is because you tricked good people
[46:04.240 --> 46:09.600]  and use good people's tax money to hire smart people that this country create a produced
[46:09.600 --> 46:15.280]  just rugged individuals to create your system and you've given good people false narratives
[46:15.280 --> 46:22.320]  to follow your program of evil you're authoritarian crud and everyone knows it you filthy trash
[46:23.040 --> 46:29.120]  you you are you are fellow travelers with kim jong il look at your soul all right that's enough
[46:29.680 --> 46:34.640]  now i'm sorry that you do not control reality now and i'm sorry that vice admiral robert in
[46:34.640 --> 46:39.840]  Monroe retired read the law of the sea treaty and pointed out its global government again
[46:39.840 --> 46:44.640]  it's just terrible if this is all being openly discussed now isn't it ratification of law of
[46:44.640 --> 46:52.240]  the sea advances world government ratification of the united nations ratification of the united
[46:52.240 --> 46:58.320]  nations law of the sea treaty would be a giant step towards world government the principal
[46:58.320 --> 47:03.440]  purpose of lost are to transfer technology and wealth from developed and underdeveloped nations
[47:03.440 --> 47:08.320]  and to increase exposure to international litigation consider two quotations from the
[47:08.320 --> 47:14.240]  lost preamble yeah it gives even all the major contiguous waterways like the mississippi and
[47:14.240 --> 47:20.160]  the coloradas and all of it over to international regulations that they now bring foreign law in
[47:20.160 --> 47:26.560]  that's why the the state police and the feds every couple hundred square miles are buying these big
[47:26.560 --> 47:32.320]  machine gun police boats and all this stuff i mean it's it's big time takeover it's it's it's
[47:32.320 --> 47:37.520]  fines fees federally internationally you think you know you go out on lake travis here in austin
[47:37.520 --> 47:42.640]  you get harassed by cops just how about some feds how about some tsa baby
[47:44.960 --> 47:50.160]  from the lost treaty achievement of these goals will contribute to the realization of just one
[47:50.160 --> 47:55.440]  equitable international economic order which takes into account the interest in needs of mankind as
[47:55.440 --> 48:01.120]  a whole see the globalist will speak for mankind and in particular the special interest and needs
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.560]  of developing countries yeah it transfers our wealth to globalist controlled third world countries
[48:06.560 --> 48:12.320]  the seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction
[48:12.320 --> 48:17.840]  that that's over 90 plus percent of the world's oceans and waterways turned over to the un attacks
[48:17.840 --> 48:23.440]  as well as its resources are the common heritage of mankind the exploration and exploitation of
[48:23.440 --> 48:27.840]  which shall be carried out for the benefit of mankind as a whole remember the robber barons
[48:27.840 --> 48:32.080]  created the un this is also they can shut down whoever they want just like when the rocker fellers
[48:32.080 --> 48:36.320]  would send in pinkerton people to slaughter folks to take over their own property that had gold on it
[48:37.360 --> 48:43.120]  so that's how they uh that's how they operate ladies and gentlemen oceans and seas cover 70
[48:43.120 --> 48:47.840]  percent of the earth's surface you have 76 in these decades and centuries to come the seabeds of
[48:47.840 --> 48:52.320]  this vast area more than two thirds of the planet will become the immense source of oil natural gas
[48:52.320 --> 48:58.560]  and rare essential minerals if we do if we do not ratify lost america will be free in the future as
[48:58.560 --> 49:03.760]  in the past or use our own advanced technology our entrepreneurial spirit and oh that's bad you
[49:03.760 --> 49:08.640]  didn't build that and our national vigor to develop the seabeds of these waters as we choose
[49:08.640 --> 49:16.240]  but if we ratify lost many aspects of our exploration development production of these resources
[49:16.240 --> 49:22.320]  will be controlled by the bureaucrat and bureaucracy established by this treaty as we will be required
[49:22.320 --> 49:27.520]  to pay lost many billions possibly trillions of dollars in fees royalties and profit sharing
[49:28.320 --> 49:32.800]  and it just goes on and talk about the global government sections in it and how it also puts
[49:32.800 --> 49:38.160]  the navy under un control which is banker control yes it's global government by the bankers now
[49:38.160 --> 49:43.200]  this article is important and it's up at info wars dot com but i want to direct you to this
[49:43.200 --> 49:47.360]  article that i asked paul watson the red link i was asked the guys the red link that for me
[49:47.360 --> 49:53.680]  so i've called watson thank you bankers declare us and europe conquered and it's got the video clips
[49:53.680 --> 49:59.840]  their own statements their own admissions video of it mainstream news i mean it's got
[50:01.280 --> 50:11.760]  14 links the financial times of london youtube uh roth child's websites uh scientific american
[50:11.760 --> 50:18.560]  it's all there where they say they took over and conquered through economic espionage okay
[50:18.560 --> 50:22.880]  so let me explain the bankers run the world government that exempts them from all the
[50:22.880 --> 50:27.600]  laws they put us under meanwhile they've got us giving up our rights because of al qaeda that is
[50:27.600 --> 50:33.600]  a simulant they control i understand it's fun to hate the muslims it's it's very fun and i understand
[50:33.600 --> 50:38.880]  there's a lot of extremists and stuff i get all that plash of cultures i got it the point is that

[55:03.360 --> 55:10.480]  rural secluded retreat buzzing around lovingly i mean what do you expect in a free country

[55:22.320 --> 55:29.600]  evil activity in fact other children didn't help so it should be illegal it's only be a communal
[55:29.600 --> 55:35.200]  communal exercise there as we can all join with the oneness oh oh i can't wait to have a jenna
[55:35.200 --> 55:39.680]  21 fully in charge and have daily miners that drop by my house and blast me around in home

[55:45.040 --> 55:49.120]  bossed around with people in uniforms just on a routine basis even if we try to go hide in the
[55:49.120 --> 55:54.400]  woods and camp they show up now and boss you around on your own family's property you've had for 180
[55:54.400 --> 56:00.960]  years it's so good and again i just want to apologize you know what explaining banker world
[56:00.960 --> 56:06.160]  government here's boss hog explaining why the banks will loan fiat made up money to europe and
[56:06.160 --> 56:11.920]  everybody else to pay off debts the banks created and too big to fail but the media tricks everybody
[56:11.920 --> 56:16.640]  to think that it's really their debt and points at the welfare class many of them on welfare because
[56:16.640 --> 56:22.400]  the economy has been purposely bankrupted and the jobs shipped overseas out of europe in the us
[56:22.400 --> 56:28.000]  that's the globalist plan then they foreclose on it and now can dictate to you and control you
[56:28.000 --> 56:35.920]  through money but here is here is boss hog to explain it to folks what can i ask you something
[56:35.920 --> 56:41.040]  yeah what why would you extend credit to those carnival people when you know they ain't got a
[56:41.040 --> 56:47.120]  dime in their genes all right i'll tell you because that's the best time to extend credit to anybody
[56:47.120 --> 56:57.520]  cowbell you see that lady ain't never gonna sell enough tickets to pay the rent on the fairgrounds
[56:57.520 --> 57:05.360]  what was her star attraction laid up in the hospital back in cedar city you see that promissory
[57:05.360 --> 57:12.240]  notes she signed pledges all the show's property as collateral and if she can't pay the rent
[57:12.240 --> 57:18.720]  well all i gotta do is foreclose and the whole shebang the whole carnival of thrills is mined
[57:18.720 --> 57:24.640]  for five cents on the dollar and that's what the globalist for getting grease for less than five
[57:24.640 --> 57:29.440]  cents on the dollar max keiser met with mr forbes and he was just bragging how they were taking it
[57:29.440 --> 57:37.040]  over last year when all this started over there in greece you see that's the plan ladies and gentlemen
[57:37.040 --> 57:44.560]  and that's why george soros's groups publicly say shut down info wars cut off our funding
[57:44.560 --> 57:49.680]  actually say we've got to get their funding cut well see you haven't impoverished everybody yet
[57:50.880 --> 57:54.960]  okay and the show's growing so even though we're in a depression we're getting more capital thanks
[57:54.960 --> 57:59.760]  to people buying books videos t-shirts supporting our sponsors so everybody get the word out about
[57:59.760 --> 58:04.400]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com because you see the instinct of these poverty pimps that
[58:04.400 --> 58:10.240]  poses liberals it shut people's money off what does bill deberg say they want to make people so poor
[58:10.240 --> 58:16.640]  they can't come protest them they say that every year they are angry that they can't fully bankrupt
[58:16.640 --> 58:21.840]  you and get you under their control their whole world is about impoverishing their whole world is
[58:21.840 --> 58:26.720]  about systems of hierarchical control as margaret singer said i'm not a liberal i want to kill all
[58:26.720 --> 58:30.960]  the blacks and i'm gonna pose as liberals and hire blacks to do it and black people many of them
[58:30.960 --> 58:36.400]  are taught to worship margaret singer who call them subhuman weeds again these people are not liberals
[58:36.400 --> 58:47.280]  they're monsters well they're right back this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[58:50.480 --> 58:55.040]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[58:55.040 --> 59:00.160]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[59:00.160 --> 59:05.040]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[59:05.040 --> 59:10.720]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[59:10.720 --> 59:15.120]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:15.120 --> 59:20.400]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[59:20.400 --> 59:24.960]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[59:24.960 --> 59:30.400]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[59:30.400 --> 59:34.800]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[59:34.800 --> 59:40.400]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com
[59:40.400 --> 59:45.440]  that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[59:45.440 --> 59:55.840]  backup dot com or call one eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five waging war on corruption
[59:55.840 --> 01:00:10.480]  alex jones on the gcm radio network big brother mainstream media government cover ups you want
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:21.040]  answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:41.200]  jones all right i have been ranting through the unbelievable news in the last hour of worldwide
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.880]  transmission and coming up where he was on two weeks ago with us a lot of amazing information
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.760]  we cover we're going to get into the campaign talk about obama and and and just the other
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:57.440]  worldliness of a u.s president i think mcbrain said it good in the hallway yesterday just said
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.560]  man it's just weird hearing a president badmouth entrepreneurs like that it's just because even
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.720]  though they've always prayed on us in the last few decades at least they paid lip service but now
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.920]  it's just you didn't do jack squat kim jong il did everything i mean look what he did i mean i
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:19.360]  mean literally i mean governments create nightmare scenarios over and over and over again even if you
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.520]  get a good one for a while bad people get in control anything that can give you anything you want
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:29.040]  can take it away and they're going to give you something taking from somebody else and these
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.680]  globalists are a weird group of control freak mentally ill scientists that's what what really
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.640]  runs it and that's who the robber barons you know go to these weird scientific conferences and
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.280]  worship each other and i've watched you on c-span with holdren or some scientist comes before j
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.320]  rockefeller and they start just groveling and i mean literally for like 10 minutes worshiping them
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.280]  because it's it's it's a weird cult they're into and i think it's going to give them life extension
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.720]  and all this and they've got this big plan and they they hate the general public and so they try
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:06.240]  to dump the general public down and the globalists really hate anything that's strong and they try to
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:12.480]  export these mutated hollywood cultures into the general population to wreck it and they
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.320]  write books i've seen globalists and hollywood folks write books of how they're trying to wreck
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.680]  society i mean it's just it's just a group of saboteurs so we have to sabotage their evil
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.720]  and the best way to do it is frontally charge it but also if you're in a position where you
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:34.320]  can't do that uh to basically just occasionally do what you can against them because all of that
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:47.280]  uh resistance ends up adding up building up in the sum final sum equation even i get distracted
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.760]  watching the stuff in the background people well some people like the new background others don't
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.440]  we're just building a lot of new studios here a lot of new places to shoot bringing a lot of
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:02.000]  new cameras a lot of new graphics uh getting ready to hone the official tv showdown hiring some more
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.920]  reporters so we're getting ready to hit our afterburners and go to the next level thanks
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:11.120]  to all of you supporting us because if george soros and the white house and others are squealing
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.920]  and yelling and don't like what we've done so far you're not going to like uh what we're
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:22.160]  going to do next in fact can we come back with how you like me now uh just for the white house that
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:28.240]  has its attack dogs coming after us now again people like who the white house they launch all
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.280]  these wars and drones and all this while they come after you they do that through a bunch of criminals
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:39.520]  getting together and making up a bunch of fake garbage and then through consensus so not any
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:47.120]  one of them can be blamed and go to prison though sarcosi probably will now and but individually
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.760]  they're incredibly weak it's this big crime collective that they're part of to commit all
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:57.360]  their murders and all of their atrocities and all of their abominations that uh they engage in
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.920]  they're really just a committee of cowards that's why they love drones they love killing
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.240]  people at a distance they love giving medals the people that do it they love just killing
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.480]  some innocent people and claiming it's al qaeda when they actually run al qaeda i mean this is this
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:17.440]  is uh this is what really really really excites them it's what floats their boat it's what makes
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:24.080]  their world go around uh it's what really at the core uh embodies these globalists so we got a
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:30.320]  bunch of key economic news a bunch of tsa news and we've got a top retired admiral analyzing
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.520]  all the sea treaty seeing advances world government basically ends us sovereignty to a great extent
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:40.880]  that's an important report and paul watson's report now red link at info wars dot com bankers
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:48.080]  declare u.s and europe conquered it's an amazing report with 14 instances of them saying they've
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:53.680]  conquered the planet earth through their criminal fraud it is a pure criminal evidence of their
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:59.200]  crimes with them confessing to it in their hubris and arrogant orgies of bloodlust
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.480]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs generator
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.440]  now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:16.880]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:22.080]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:28.320]  respiratory system with yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.440]  nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:39.680]  sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:45.120]  lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production

[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:11.120]  circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.520]  silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.920]  and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:25.680]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it

[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:14.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:24.800]  ladies and gentlemen it is thursday the 19th day of july 2012 joseph farrah the creator
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:31.680]  of one of the most prominent constitutional liberty-based media outlets in the world is our
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:36.080]  guest he joined us a few weeks ago for his maiden visit i don't know why the last 17 years on air
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.120]  i have never gotten him on but here he is and a lot of news got made out of his interview here
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:49.200]  two weeks ago both on the fact of drones but also on the evil of some of the george soros
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:55.200]  white house funded groups talked about mixing joseph farrah and alex jones is just i think they
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.920]  described it as you know chlorine bleach being mixed with something else and explosive it was just
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:05.280]  so horrible that we described the system as orwellian and that we talked about how crazy
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:10.960]  everything is and how obama constantly lies i mean it's it's just bad what's really bad
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:18.320]  is that info wars gets roughly five to eight times a week the traffic msnbc.com gets and the same
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:25.360]  thing for worldnetdaily.com or wnd.com what's really horrible is that the drudge report gets
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.040]  about 91 times the traffic of both of george soros white house run media matters and think
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:37.360]  progress see that's what's really horrible and dangerous is the dinosaur media is stumbling
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:46.560]  around dying in front of us but like a cornered uh rabid dog they are dangerous make no mistake
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.760]  and and they don't control the heartland of america they don't control everything but they
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:54.800]  they do control the money so they can loot that and legalize the illegal aliens and have the tsa
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.280]  open up flight schools run by legal aliens for dozens of illegal aliens but but citizens have
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.960]  got to have tsa you know grab your two-year-old daughter and drag them behind closed doors as
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:08.800]  they cry and as defrock priests have their way with them publicly uh again this is the giant
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.600]  reeducation of america that they've talked so much about and paul watson has an article
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:19.920]  banksters declare u.s and europe conquered with 14 instances of the banksters and the media announcing
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:25.280]  that we are under a global government run by megabanks but that it's a good thing but then
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:32.000]  when somebody like admiral robert r munroe in the hill uh writes about ratification of
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.120]  law of the sea advances world government now he'll have to have george soros group come out and
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:42.880]  wave a magic wand and say we control reality that's extreme so i love how the so-called liberals
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.840]  who are really just authoritarians always believe they control reality and they dictate they have
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:54.400]  this uh obsession with establishing things that they call nonpartisan uh groups that
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.120]  are betrayed and they tell you what reality is i mean imagine getting up in the morning and
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.600]  coming out starting a group and just saying we're nonpartisan and we tell you what's really
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.320]  happening and it turns out it's 180 degrees from the truth and then no one really reads them but
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:15.200]  they take themselves seriously but i guess they do have their el presidente in there so i i i guess
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:20.720]  we should watch it we and joseph era they really got upset by your statement about if obama gets
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.600]  reelected they're going to hunt us down like dogs but i noticed in the salon article and others
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.720]  almost every comment said yes let's kill alex jones and joe farrah and i saw some of the
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.360]  handles were actually writers over at salon and and they agreed that we should be killed
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:41.600]  but we're crazy to say that they're violent that that's exactly right we're the conspiracy people
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:49.040]  but it's the conspiracy is against us i mean the conspirators are are are actually the very
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:55.600]  people pointing the fingers at us uh and uh you know i have a lot of experience with what you just
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:03.360]  said in terms of the left being an authoritarian mindset uh i don't know if you you caught the
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:13.200]  piece i wrote a week or two ago uh it was a personal confession that you know as a young person uh i
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:22.080]  was actually a commie oh gosh i missed that uh you know i i mean extremist i i actually uh
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:29.200]  alex you know ran around with bernadine doran and and billy errors and jane fonda people like that
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:37.680]  back in my misguided youth so i know how this works i know what they want i can even speak their
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:44.560]  language because i'm so familiar with it and when you say you know look they're not going to be happy
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:52.400]  they're they're not angry that alex jones has a big audience they and or joe farrah they don't want
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:58.800]  us to have any audience at all they won't be happy until we got to go out on the street with a soap
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:07.440]  box and talk to people that way they want to drive all uh opposition voices not only off the internet
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.800]  but of course talk radio and the whole nine yards that is an authoritarian it's just that it's
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:17.760]  worse than authoritarian it's a totalitarian mindset by the way i thought you were being
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.400]  sarcastic and we're about to describe obama you tell us about your article tell us the headline
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.840]  we'll put it up from worldnetdaily.com i mean i get because you were very young as a conservative
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.720]  to run major newspapers and things you're saying your real education was early on you actually
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:37.920]  fell into the underworld of the uh miscreant authoritarians posing as liberals yeah the column
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:45.200]  is called confessions of a former communist and and what it's really about is the fact that you
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:52.320]  know being a part of that kind of radical extremist viewpoint and i'm talking about uh
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:59.120]  you know late sixties early seventies uh i had every advantage you could imagine they i mean
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:04.480]  people were rolling out the red carpet i was being because of my radicalism i was offered a
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:10.080]  free ride scholarship at college not because of my grades not because of anything but they like
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:15.520]  the fact that oh here's a guy here's a future leader and i really believe that you know somebody
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:21.760]  like barack obama had the same kind a little bit later you know he's a little bit older than i am
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:27.600]  or a little bit younger i should say he experienced the same thing uh i don't know who his parents
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.680]  were i don't okay if you hung around with communists i've i've interviewed a few of them and gone out
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:36.000]  to dinner with them just to see and as soon as they get three drinks in them they start going
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:42.000]  we're going to kill everybody when we take over no no no i'm not joking i mean i've had crew with me
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.880]  when well-known communists have come to town or socialists and then they say i'm really a marxist
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:52.320]  linus and when we take over we're going to kill everybody i was actually being encouraged as a
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:59.280]  teenager to go out and blow up chemical plants and oil refinery plants and things like that
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.960]  because uh they figured that well you know he's underage and if he gets caught he's not going to
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.880]  get a life sentence or the death penalty if he kills somebody i mean i i have been through it all
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:19.200]  as a as a young person uh inbred with that kind of uh mindset and so you know this is why i have
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:25.920]  an understanding of what's going on in this world today now i see a maniac like the maniacs i knew
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:32.880]  back then in the white house now how do you think that makes me feel you're concerned you know i'm
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:41.040]  not i mean he hung around with the same people i did and in fact in his case we know for a fact
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:48.000]  that the heirs family actually put him through harvard i mean this is you know i like i said i was
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.880]  offered a free ride scholarship to anteok college which was the the breeding grounds for left wing
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:01.920]  leaders the next step from there is to become a road scholar and on and on you go and um you know
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:08.320]  obama had it even better i mean he had the heirs family paying for his the his harvard education
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:15.520]  well again three separate times once i flew somebody here two other times i went out to dinner
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.800]  when i was in new york with socialist because i was invited to dinner just in you know with groups
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:24.240]  that i was already with they said oh we're not bad you know the democratic party's not bad why don't
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:30.160]  you go to dinner with us and and then after they've had a few drinks it's like this they're usually
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.560]  really wimps they're they're extremely wimpy they never really lived they're normally real
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:39.040]  sheltered it's always some elitist restaurant or some you know high-rise penthouse they're always
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:43.280]  trust fund you know type people and then they look you in the eye a lot and all three times they had
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:47.040]  big followings as well but some of these are well-known people and they start talking about
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:52.080]  alex you should just join us because we're going to kill everybody we're going to so once we get
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.120]  control we're going to kill blood is the answer and i'm like are you serious and i mean these are
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.080]  like crazy people who by the way have probably never been in a fist fight probably never helped
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:07.120]  smile on the side of the road with their head partially chopped off blood sprain no exactly
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.840]  they have no idea what they're even talking about these are the useful idiots but i mean did you
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:19.040]  experience that this lusting to kill people uh to be honest with you know i didn't i never
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:25.840]  got to that point and i can tell you that you know i crept right up to the edge but i didn't i
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:32.400]  never followed through what for instance when i attended meetings where i was instructed on
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:39.600]  how we were going to go blow up a chemical plant and i listened and something in my conscience that
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:45.520]  that don't participate in this i i i still had a conscience and i think that you know what the
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:51.920]  difference between me and uh you know some other people who never came out of that by the way this
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:58.720]  is we have to understand about you know this progressive thing this socialist thing is it's
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:09.520]  like a religion okay i never actually became a full-blown believer i guess i never it never
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:16.080]  got to me as something so visceral even though i participated in riots and demonstrations and
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:23.680]  was arrested and all kinds of things like that and talk to talk and you know walk to walk there
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:30.480]  was something preventing me from you know making that last step which is the point of no return i
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:39.920]  guess wow and now we have a president we're gonna break i want to get into uh his statement that
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:45.920]  you didn't build it if you make something or you create a song or a painting nothing he says the
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:52.640]  state did that man if you can't run against that guy and hang him with his own words then you don't
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:59.280]  deserve to be president i mean he is providing he's providing romney with more ammunition than
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.280]  and i i don't see romney utilizing it very effectively but uh that's the problem we got you
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:12.960]  know like uh do we really have an alternative here well that was my next question i mean romney in
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:19.120]  the past when he's actually in power gun control open borders abortion carbon taxes obama care
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:25.520]  he says a lot of things that are good on the surface but i mean well you know me i i wrote
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:31.440]  the book in 2008 out of the above but you know i i took him and i got i got a lot of black
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:37.360]  from a lot of friends were taking that position i i knew how bad obama was going to be but i actually
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:43.440]  thought you know mccain wasn't a whole lot better and maybe what we needed was a dose a little taste
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.840]  of the celestarianism to get the people to rise up stay there i want to hear about that when we

[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:35.680]  weren't successful somebody along the line gave you some help there was a great teacher somewhere
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:43.680]  in your life somebody helped to create this unbelievable american system that we had that
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.160]  allowed you to thrive somebody invested in roads and bridges if you've got a business
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:55.760]  that you didn't build that somebody else made that happen really the internet didn't get invented
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:01.280]  on really government research created the internet really i thought i thought that businesses
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:06.640]  created the tax base to build the roads not have it funneled uh and i guess al gore built the
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.560]  internet i thought government went on and got science already developed and deployed it and
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:16.800]  people over decades purchased computers set up their own servers paid for the telecoms to build up
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:21.600]  with our purchasing in the free market i thought that's what built that market just like organic
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:30.000]  foods was built by consumer choices uh joe if joseph era of world net daily he has really openly
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:34.960]  shown himself for people that have studied linen style and now all of them i mean this this all
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:39.840]  this comes out of hugo shah business mouth every day when they take somebody's business even small
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:45.680]  ones that nationalize it for people that don't know is that not pure uh marxism that we're hearing
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:52.640]  there yeah that's classic collectivism uh we all did it uh we we you know nobody could have achieved
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:26:00.960]  anything uh independently uh it you know we all did it everything that happened we were all responsible
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:07.040]  for it anything good that happened of course any anything that bad it happened that's uh that's
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:18.080]  usually blamed on you and me but but every every good work that happens happens because of government
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:25.360]  and uh you know that is classic marxism and you you're hearing it from you know the guy sitting
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:31.280]  in the white house i honestly i never thought i would see this day in my life and uh and but you
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:35.440]  know getting back to what we were talking about in terms of where we are now you know we're talking
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:42.080]  about 2008 my position was don't you know don't vote for either one of these guys mccain or obama
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:48.480]  because uh the likely outcome i i admitted back then would be an obama victory in fact i didn't
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:54.000]  think there was any way mccain was going to beat obama no matter what uh i mean he ran or you
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:00.240]  know the most idiotic campaign he wasn't he wasn't a defender of the constitution what reason was there
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:08.400]  to to vote for the guy affirmatively uh i mean he was responsible for you know some dreadful
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:18.480]  legislation uh the whole political uh contributions business and whatnot um so you know my position
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:24.560]  was none of the above and i predicted that obama was going to win and what would happen is people would
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:31.440]  you know it's almost like every generation has to learn a lesson over again about socialism
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:38.080]  and i thought okay we're gonna have to experience the pain here for people to wake up and predictably
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:44.480]  it happened that was the tea party movement you know and and people were out there by the millions
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:51.680]  protesting and i thought yeah i'm really good you know i i figured this out but something's
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:57.760]  happened to alex uh since 2010 it's like they all went back to sleep again because they think they
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:06.240]  elected some republicans to take over the house uh who turn out to be not much different at the end
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:12.640]  of the day than with the congress that was there before because the republicans are given obama
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:18.720]  all the money he needs but letting him borrow all the money he needs to continue these insane
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:26.240]  collectivist programs and even create some new ones like obama care and so today i think we're
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:31.920]  in a different place i you know like i said in the the last time we visited i think right now
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:38.480]  we're we're fighting for our very survival i mean it's not just our freedom we're fighting for
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:46.320]  we people like you and me we we are we are going to be facing extinction i don't say that lightly
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:51.120]  uh i've never heard you talk like this and and and this happened right at the end of the last
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:54.640]  interview so we didn't have time to have you elaborate we're about to go to break but but but
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:01.600]  but joe ferro joseph ferro start over uh when we come back from break explaining exactly what
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:06.560]  you mean by this because i don't want you to be cut short here because folks if you haven't been

[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:40.720]  set up uh gun confiscation plans in declassified army documents i mean this is real and there are
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:46.880]  a lot of scenarios where the people in charge right now may decide to go all the way so i'm
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:52.880]  going to get joseph ferro's take on that straight ahead we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:22.080]  i'm alex jones our guest is joseph farrah of world net daily
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:28.320]  there aren't many big alternative media outlets there's drudge report dot com world net daily
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:34.240]  dot com info wars dot com and present money dot com newsmax to a certain extent and and there are
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:40.320]  a lot of other great sites it's just they're not huge and we are huge and so we have the white house
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:47.120]  responding to us attacking us if you look at world net daily one week before the book where's the
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:54.000]  birth certificate came out they had said there was no long form that the receipt was it then they
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  released the new one that was totally fake i've been proven fake i'm gonna get into that new news
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.880]  that world net daily's been right on top of with joe opio and all the new demonization over that
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:09.440]  subject but one week before they come out and release the birth certificate directly aiming
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.880]  at world net daily folks if i was really born in the united states or i was who i said i was
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:20.960]  i wouldn't even respond or care or i would have released it four years ago now we know why they
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:27.040]  haven't it's because it's it's he officially put out there was on publicist for 16 years
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:31.440]  that he was born in kenya his wife said it that was a cover story they're hiding who the dad was
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.560]  so i guess he can say with a straight face it's hawaii the point is we knew a cover-up was there
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:40.800]  the records are sealed but we're going to get to that in a moment with joseph farrah my point here
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:46.160]  is they countered him they had esquire come out and say the book had been recalled and that they'd
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:51.200]  apologize and we're giving full refunds for retail costs that would have bankrupted them not just for
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:55.840]  the cost of book but what the store was going to sell it for they i mean they they acted like they
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:00.880]  were scared and they responded then they released the bin laden fable a week after that i mean they
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:08.640]  were acting like this was the end of their political careers and so joseph farrah you've never really
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:16.080]  talked like this because i've been following you since uh 1996 or 16 years ago i've never heard you
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:22.720]  talk about we're going to be hunted down if they get back in what what spectrum of data do you come
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:28.880]  to that hypothesis with because i mean i respect your your vision and and and understanding of
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:33.680]  things watching it so long even before world net daily running large papers around the country and
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.920]  running the western journalism center what are you getting at here what are you expecting you
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:42.640]  have the floor repeat what you were saying earlier yeah well first of all you know i i got a little
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:49.920]  experience we we we lived through the clinton years and that was you know when w and d was just
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:57.120]  first getting started and we saw how they came after us uh and it was pretty you know pretty
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:03.760]  brutal pretty ruthless pretty obvious with the irs attacks and so forth then you know we went
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:09.280]  through eight years of bush well you know we attacked you know we were extremely critical of
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:14.960]  bush i am looking me i never got invited to the white house uh you know even though uh
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:20.880]  you know well let's just say we were extremely critical but you know there were no consequences
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:28.320]  to us we weren't we weren't audited we weren't attacked i didn't think anybody was necessarily
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:33.920]  you know tapping my phone anymore than everybody's phone is tapped these days then we enter the
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:41.520]  ovami years and once again i mean we've we've experienced the attack uh brutally even any
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:46.400]  beyond anything we we knew during the clinton years so i know these people play for keeps now
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.720]  more specifically answered your question i want to tell you about a book that we have prepared
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:59.360]  it's coming out on august 7th it's going to be huge of 50 000 copies pre-sold and there's nothing
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:07.440]  obama can do about it this time it's called fool me twice and the subtitle is obama's shocking plan
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:13.680]  for the next four years exposed and it's written by aron kline one of our reporters he previously
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:21.440]  wrote manchurian president which was an airtime bestseller and this lays out exactly what these
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:30.160]  folks will do uh with their own words in other words you know that's what investigative reporters
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:35.440]  do they go they seek out the document uh from the committees and the organizations that are
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:40.880]  actually setting the policy for the obama administration groups like by the way the
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:47.360]  center for uh american progress that went after you and me this week that's one of them you know
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:52.960]  john pedestas group these are these are the policy makers for the obama administration
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:58.480]  these are not just cheerleaders for them these are just not people who defend what they do
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:04.240]  they actually set the policy these are the brains of the operation and so so it's worse than i was
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:08.640]  saying that that these are front groups funded you're right these are actually the people
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:15.360]  running the obama administration these are the actual bosses you could say that absolutely in
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:21.040]  fact you know i'll bet you if you could watch uh and see who's entering the white house on a daily
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.760]  base so you see john pedestas name on there probably more than sure it was the transition
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:29.920]  head and they admit millions from george soros they bet they have weekly meetings uh there with the
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:35.280]  george soros funding both groups but also media matters and so what does it mean that front and
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:40.880]  center info wars dot com at worldnet daily dot com are who they're going after on almost a daily
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:47.600]  basis it means we're hitting the mark we're we're we're on target here and we got them worried now
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:53.840]  of course what they do is they try to go after us they try to do an enrug they try to intimidate
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:39:01.840]  matt drudge from ever you know linking to any stories on your site or my site uh
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:10.400]  my feeling about that is you know matt drudge is an independent guy who has the great sense of
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.880]  news judgment he's going to do what he does and what has made him so successful regardless of
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:22.240]  anything they say or do but that's the intent the intent is to intimidate uh to you know they know
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:28.480]  that there's nothing they can do directly to alex jones or joseph era other than you know
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:34.160]  killing them to get us to stop doing that's right they know we're not going to stop and so they're
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:39.920]  they're with with shots in the dark they're going after uh you know uh you know to them the unknown matt
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:45.440]  drudge but i know you know him well uh it just shows what thugs they are and they say drudge
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:50.320]  is doing this dirty stuff we've discovered it as if it's not in public you know on the biggest
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:57.040]  site in the world let's let's uh you know let's have the media go after him oh my gosh throw us
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:01.680]  in the briar patch oh my gosh have the washington post calling me up yesterday about it throughout
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:07.600]  a big article about drudge i mean as if that's gonna hurt drudge or anybody else plus i've got
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:13.520]  syndicated talk radio you're dominating youtube dominating podcasting i mean i've got all these
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:18.240]  different tentacles as they would see it i would see it as legs it's not like they're gonna stop us
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:23.120]  just doing that and it shows how pathetic they are tens of millions a year to run it and they
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:29.120]  can't even get any traffic to their sites they're a joke it's the white house's attempt to have a fake
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:33.520]  media site i mean they're a joke well they literally have to see they understand what they
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:39.280]  have to do to get people to listen to them is they have to put a gun to their head i mean you and i
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:45.120]  we don't put a gun to anybody's head to listen to us or to come to our website and that's what the
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:50.240]  new media takeover alerts are about is where they force you to see it but i mean getting back to this
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.200]  so we're front and center on their radar screen because we're covering their takeover their police
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:41:00.720]  state their world government how they're actually funded by crony groups to shut down their competition
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:06.160]  they're very upset about us exposing them shutting down power plants they're very upset so you were
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.280]  continuing why you think we're in so much trouble if they get reelected yeah so you know a lot of it
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:18.240]  comes from the the the unbelievable you know startling uh expose that i have already read in
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:24.320]  this book fool me twice it's gonna be really really bad if obama gets elected i think it's
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:30.880]  an irreversible situation for america i think we'll be on beyond the be beyond the point of no
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:37.200]  return it's not going to be you know we'll have to go and start a new country basically or we'll
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:43.280]  have to find some states to succeed and and it'll be bloodshed even peter shiff said it may take
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:49.680]  revolution yesterday on the cnbc i mean that's radical for him i think people realize this is a
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:55.520]  desperate situation so break down some of what you found in the think jenks running obama what
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:02.720]  they're planning okay well if you think you know obama's the stroke of the pen on his you know
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:10.320]  making illegal aliens legal uh was the end of it uh coming in the second term is an expansive i'm
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:18.240]  quoting now an expansive de facto amnesty program for illegal aliens via executive order an interagency
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:24.320]  directive linked with a reduction in the capabilities of the u.s border patrol and plans to bring in
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:30.800]  untold numbers of new immigrants with the removal of caps on h1b visas and green cards
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:38.800]  the they want to transform america fundamentally well mama told us this in 2008 but they're actually
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:44.160]  going to do it if they get another chance in beginning in 20 and by the way you've been
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:48.400]  saying this in this new book because i was reading about it for three months or something
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:53.440]  they're already doing what is in the book that is even out yet legalize in the illegals shutting
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:58.960]  down border patrol stations yeah they're doing it incrementally right now they're taking baby steps
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:05.040]  but given four more years and it's a by the way it doesn't matter who's in the congress because
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:11.200]  you know what obama has shown over and over again he's willing to misuse his executive power
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:17.200]  or you know he has no he has nothing but contempt for the constitution and i don't
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.400]  think you know what i see is weak need opposition right now from the republicans who control the
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:28.320]  house and even if they control the house and the senate of obama is the president it's it's end game
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:40.880]  for us when you say hunted down like dogs elaborate on that well yeah what i'm saying there is i
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:49.600]  think that uh we will not be you know you've established a an amazing platform and and i've
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:59.280]  done okay in that department over the years i do not believe those platforms will be allowed to
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:05.200]  survive in what is coming which is which is you know basically a totalitarian police state
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:13.120]  and it could be worse than that i mean you know and quite honestly if i were you you know i take
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:22.240]  a big life insurance policy uh if obama gets reelected i know i will i'm being you know about
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:30.400]  as blunt as i can be uh i i think we have to do whatever we can to prevent that uh eventuality
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:36.560]  and if that means voting this time i hate to say it i really hate to say it against my nature to
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:41.520]  say it you didn't say that four years ago you didn't say it but i'll tell you something i'm
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:48.880]  going to go to the polls this year and i'm going to vote for a guy i really don't uh respect that
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:54.640]  really don't like don't think he's going to do you know do what he says he's going to do don't
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:45:01.360]  believe he's going to be the answer to our problem but i'm going to do that in self defense well maybe
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:06.320]  that's what ran paul was told whenever he went ahead and saddled up next to romney because i've
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:13.680]  talked to a lot of big wigs and they say look you don't get it obama is chicago communist mafia
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:21.520]  they plan a bloody takeover yep and mit romney's banker run corrupt everything but he's he's a
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:29.600]  he's a you know basically uh he's not going to kill you he's not going to kill you but what's the
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:36.960]  term he's a country club republican so so so they don't do it mafia style yeah i mean ask yourself
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:43.520]  this simple question will you uh there's a guy who's running and he's going to kill you there's
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:47.600]  a guy who's running who's not going to kill you what are you going to do are you going to sit it
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:56.080]  out i mean honestly i i just can't see that uh i i can't see doing that i'm not saying you know
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:01.920]  go out there and work enthusiastically for mit romney and he's going to solve your problem he's
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:08.880]  not well the argument i've heard from people in washington is that is that if that you can influence
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:13.120]  romney if you actually try to get in there and that's what ran paul's trying to do what do you
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.560]  think of that strategy well i i think he's right and i'd like to see ran paul's be on the vice
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:23.520]  presidential uh ticket with romney because he'd be a great influence i think he's that
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:29.600]  he's one of the shining lights uh we have uh in the senate right now and so i'd listen very
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:37.360]  carefully to what he's saying i think he knows a lot of what we're talking about i mean i understand
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:42.320]  what you're saying and i i remember clinton killin those hundreds of people all those hundreds of
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:48.160]  people dying and i know that they're gearing up for total takeover i mean look at homeland security
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:52.800]  look at the military look at the executive orders look at the preparations for gun confiscation i
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:59.280]  mean that's in the latest army training manuals joseph i mean it's it's it's i mean even the look
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:03.760]  the obama administration did the same thing already too they killed hundreds of people
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:09.360]  that's what fast and furious was it wasn't just two law enforcement officers in the us who got
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:16.640]  killed it's untold numbers of mexican citizens and peasants and probably other you i think they
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:25.120]  estimate 2400 mexico and over 200 here yeah i mean that that's a slaughter and uh and and that was
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:32.800]  an intentional policy decision that they made uh and uh and they got caught and yet there's no
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:40.480]  no so far anyway i'm i'm just done that there are no repercussions for this we have no calls for
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:46.960]  impeachment we have nobody's been indicted nobody's been charged holders still sitting there as the
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:51.520]  attorney general of the united states you know so and you know he was involved in oklahoma city
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:56.880]  just to be clear her joseph era you're you're saying following the past patterns with this
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:01.600]  type of mafia they're going to feel like they're invincible with the pardons and the rest of it
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:06.160]  in the second term and that's when they're going to let their hair down they will be invincible
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:11.360]  i have no confidence that a republican congress is going to keep them in check uh that that's
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:17.040]  the the the obvious thing that we should learn from our experience when you know when i wrote
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:22.160]  none of the above it was it for the reason that look you know essentially you don't have a clear
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:27.680]  choice here a lot of people think well you know if we have a republican congress again they're
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:33.600]  going to keep obama in check the fact though we have a republican congress right now they haven't
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:39.520]  done did least what to stop obama and they have the power why is that how can they have the secretary
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:43.920]  defense march in with the generals and say we're under nato command we don't go to congress to go
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:49.120]  to war i mean that's high treason right there how have we gotten to this point what happened to
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:54.000]  congress are they being blackmailed yeah well that that's again that's happened incrementally on
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:01.200]  both democrat and republican watches over decades you know if vietnam was a perfect example right
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:06.720]  how did we ever declare war in vietnam one of the bloodiest wars we've ever fought one of the longest
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:13.360]  wars we've ever fought didn't happen we we when you start when you ignore the constitution even in
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:22.320]  a small way suddenly you know you start taking more advantage of of the constitution and that's
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:28.400]  what we've been doing for decades and decades now and it's to the point now nobody even cares
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:33.440]  whether the president of the united states is constitutionally eligible to be there nobody cares
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:43.840]  well undoubtedly they are doing everything they can to shut this country down every policy they
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:50.640]  have is to shut down american businesses joseph why is that just to make us dependent i mean i
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:56.800]  i guess they got to bring us down before they remake us in their collectivist image well yeah i mean
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:03.600]  sure when you know when when lennon took power his job was not to you know create jobs for people
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:13.840]  uh far from it it was to total control make the population dependent on government the
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:18.320]  government is a matter of life and death with you they decide whether you're going to eat or
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:22.720]  you're not going to eat whether you get a bullet in the head or you don't get a bullet in the head
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:28.560]  and that is we're we're getting very close to that situation in america today that's what i'm saying
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:33.040]  and people don't realize historically that once you get to this point it's only a degree
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:37.760]  from where you go where we're at now where they're lined up on our borders the tyrants are
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:44.640]  politically to you you move one degree and you're suddenly in north korea and and so much of the
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:50.320]  cowardly population is going to just get behind all this because they're going to want their their
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:55.200]  freebies and that's why they've doubled the number of people on welfare in the last four years we are
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:01.520]  in so much trouble we'll talk about drones when we come back and the latest our pio knows let me

[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:49.760]  ferrah quick question here we're going to go to break and come back briefly with the big news of
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:55.680]  joe arpaio that you guys were instrumental on covering and being part of uh with dr corcy the
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:01.520]  drone i mean you live out in a rural area drone flies by you talk about it and all these groups
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:07.040]  attack you saying there's no drones uh but then i've got fox nation reporting drones will dominate
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:11.760]  the skies in two and a half years representative says that hearing and all these videos are coming
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:18.160]  in on youtube drones are all over the place joes of ferrah yeah i wish i could tell you i've had
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:23.360]  another sighting alex but it's not the case although i will say that every time i go to walk
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:31.680]  my dog now i got my iphone in my pocket and uh at least uh at least uh you know i'm thinking
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:38.720]  i'm thinking maybe i should carry a shotgun but that's usually it's just a handgun well especially
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:42.960]  like you said if they try to send one of those obama noid hit squads you know what about the
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:48.560]  killings uh uh under clinton where they would shoot the person five or six times cut their arms and
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:57.440]  legs off and fami malik would declare it a uh suicide yes it was it there was an epidemic
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:05.280]  of that kind of thing uh it started up years i mean uh you know ron ron brown who was you know
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:10.400]  supposedly killed in a plane crash but had a a bullet hole in the through the top of his head
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:18.000]  and you know uh you've been to the foster and all of those things that i mean you know it's it's
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:24.080]  we get to the side if this is the kind of world we we want to live in i continue to live in uh or
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:32.000]  not and uh i i think we're running out of time alex um and like i said it's not this presidential
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.480]  election that's going to make things right this presidential election to me is only a
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:45.200]  and only an opportunity to buy us more time uh to make things right it's like if you're being
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:51.440]  chased by 20 blood thirsty wolves through the house and you kind of throw down a bookcase
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:56.320]  that's there on the hallway in front of them that's kind of what you see romney as it was it's not
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:58:05.360]  like that that's almost a perfect analogy but listen listen why is romney laying down then
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:11.520]  i mean he just i mean obama calls him a crook when obama is involved in fast and furious
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:17.600]  yeah i mean i'm not i'm not here to to defend romney in any way shape or form i wish he'd be
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.400]  more aggressive i wish he'd see the same things we're seeing and would tell the american people
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:27.920]  but that's probably not gonna happen so it's gonna be up to you and me to remind people throughout
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:34.560]  this campaign what this choice is all about i mean when you even got rupert murdoch telling

[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:40.160]  segment real fast joseph i meant to get into this with you look you know amaral laki number three
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:45.520]  in al qaeda secretly dining at the wide at the pentagon with the secretary of the army two weeks
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:51.280]  that were 9 11 on and on and on obama has the state department get the underwear bomber on the plane
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:56.960]  that came out on c span after our eyewitnesses kurt haskel saw it using al qaeda to take over libya
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:03.280]  now syria again um i mean i know you know a lot about the middle east you cover it quite a bit
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.120]  what is going on here i mean all i know is every time i turn around the quote muslim extremists
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:17.520]  are being funded by the cia and that that definitely concerns me uh because you know this may be the
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:22.880]  only point of departure we have uh between us in terms of disagreement i actually think we
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:29.760]  are facing a real uh threat from uh it is you know islamic extremism i believe there's an
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:36.400]  effort underway to recreate the caliphate that existed up until you know the end of world war
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:40.880]  one uh but this time it's going to be very sure i know there's groups the muslim brotherhood
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:45.680]  doing that my point is our government is putting them in charge in in in egypt you name it what
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:50.640]  they think they can control them they think they can because they can't this is this is
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:55.920]  these are not people who can be confused they want to control us that's what it's all about
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:02.480]  and uh and believe me you know you don't know what tyranny is like until you live in an islamic
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:08.000]  republic uh it doesn't get any worse but that doesn't get any worse than that not the germany
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  or the soviet union uh you know these are folks who have no regard for women uh they uh you know
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.720]  that it's just but specifically we were talking there in the break what about homeland security
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.640]  my point is they're using that threat with a real exaggerated or whatever to take our rights and the
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:35.280]  whole thing's pointed at us that's right and on that point we totally agree that was a terrible
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:40.240]  terrible thing that happened during the bush administration maybe the single worst thing
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:47.440]  that george w buddy did was create that monstrosity uh because it's uh it doesn't do anything
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:54.880]  to protect us from that threat that i see that maybe you don't think is as real as i do uh but
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:03:00.080]  instead what it does is it goes after people like you and me each and every time every memo that
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:06.240]  comes out that they're all the same people like you and me uh you know returning military veterans
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:12.160]  are the threat not terrorists sure so that's my point is i don't want to hear about all day about
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:16.560]  the muslims they're going to get me when the whole thing is to take over and destroy the republic
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:21.360]  and you see that continuity between bush obama there's a larger globalist plan and they use
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:26.160]  different groups to implement it but they're just little government management teams briefly uh what
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:30.160]  do you think of our pile's announcement saying yes this is a fake birth certificate i mean we
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:35.440]  already knew that but it is newsworthy i thought it was very powerful and beyond the additional
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:41.360]  evidence that they raised with the birth certificate itself which was by the way shocking to me the
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:47.040]  fact that you know the numeric thing where fields should have been blank that weren't blank that was
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:52.560]  pretty shocking stuff but the the bigger question that i think our pale race is the national security
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:04:00.960]  issue so with hawaii what they found out about hawaii is a is a basically a factory for producing
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:07.040]  fraudulent birth certificates and handing out citizenship to people who who don't warrant it
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:13.440]  and uh you know you would think that our again our you know those republican congressmen who say
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:18.880]  they care about things like this if they're afraid of the birth their issue they would at least
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:27.280]  take a look at hawaii uh policies which are in direct violation of federal regulations
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:33.120]  and do nothing about that but of course i'm not holding my breath wow another amazing interview
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:39.440]  with joseph ferrah and one of many to come i hope of uh a society doesn't crumble around us
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.480]  a very interesting point you've raised today thank you sir all right good to be with you alec
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:47.520]  all right thank you good to be with you let me say bye to you right here at the break we're going to

[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:26.080]  time friend i've had to know him like 13 14 years leaving a sponsor on the radio show a long time
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:32.560]  ago with his gun shop and uh hardware stories one of those evil entrepreneurs and if you go to the
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:38.400]  front page of info wars dot com you can see obama talking to a child about evil entrepreneurs it's a
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:45.680]  very special image at info wars dot com for radio listeners it is a child or it's a real photo building
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:51.680]  blocks and he says you didn't build that uh no north korean leader kim jung il did because we all
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:56.960]  know government-run systems create such wondrous things in every case in history we're just supposed
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:03.760]  to ignore the nightmares that they quickly generate now bob daisy is a writer for the new american
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:09.120]  magazine and he also has to radio show tv show you name it throughout the years but he's also a

[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:21.120]  in north austin in fact many years ago when i first got on the air like 16 17 years ago he had a
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:27.280]  hardware store about 500 yards away and was one of our first sponsors and here he is with us because
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:34.480]  you know you you learn so much over the years but then you create files documents films and
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:39.120]  then you try to go back and get it all together again there's so many obama quotes cerebrating
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:43.840]  quotes eric holder quotes about we're going to ban your guns we're going to get them the cities they
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:50.240]  get control of new york chicago total gun bans they want to ban our guns i mean cerebrating some of
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:54.800]  the floor of the house before we can have a socialist america we must ban all civilian ownership of
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:10:03.200]  guns unideers september 7th uh a july 7th 2001 said civilian ownership of firearms threatens
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:08.000]  legitimate power monopoly of the state we want the total abolition state department dememorandum
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:14.640]  7277 which is still u.s policy says total global disarmament except for the un do you imagine
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:19.840]  how hellish that is so they can love us all and look bob has a copy of 7277 here i'm an
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.800]  actual i even have one of the blue booklets around here somewhere but he has a uh photocopy
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:30.880]  of one we're going to show you these exhibits if you're watching at prison planet dot tv we're
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:36.240]  fighting the prison planet at prison planet dot tv it's 15 cents a day got a 15 day free trial

[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:54.800]  show posted for you if you're not watching it live at prison planet dot tv we don't make you
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:59.040]  support us like george soros that gets banker bailout money and then funds fake media watchdog
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:04.320]  groups calling for us to be shut down run by the white house but but we're here fighting their
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:09.760]  tyranny and they don't like it so i'm going to try now to just sit back and have bob go over gun
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:16.800]  control go over the fact that this un treaty just as the law of the sea this is the hill newspaper
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:23.520]  and the big congressional newspaper vice admiral robert r munro says it will hand over our sovereignty
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:29.120]  to a global government ratification law of the sea advances world government world government is real
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:35.520]  okay and who runs it the bankers who is who is paul watson has a key article out today that is so
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:42.400]  important bankers declare u.s. and europe conquered and it's actually them saying it on video okay i
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:48.960]  mean this is this is now they've conquered the central government not us yet homeland security
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:54.640]  agenda 21 that is the implementation through homeland security the rewrite the overwrite
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:59.040]  of our once free republic so we've been warning you all these years it's getting closer and closer
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:04.000]  now we're in it i've never heard joe ferra talk like that joseph ferra earlier saying you know
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.920]  they're going to probably come kill us if obama gets reelected and that romney's horrible but
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:12.400]  you know he probably won't kill us i mean that's what people in the know are saying i mean the
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:20.480]  look the the military has declassified reeducation camps and gun confiscation that video is posted
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:26.640]  on our youtube channel it's gone totally viral with all the proof of that this is real okay this
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:30.960]  is it happened everywhere else so understand it's it's kind of like you never believe you're
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:35.840]  going to get injured or had that car wreck and you look somebody runs a red light they t-bonia
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:40.720]  you're in the hospital you know this stuff really happens most countries throughout history have
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:46.800]  fallen to tyranny most countries have fallen to tyranny it happens now the question is how
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:52.080]  bad will the tyranny be the globalist are you genesis they believe in getting rid of population
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:57.600]  so it's not just like they're ruthless and don't mind killing people killing people is the aim
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:02.720]  the famous statement of hey you got to break a few eggs and make an omelet in the ukraine when
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:06.240]  they're killing 10 million and the journalist says i don't see an omelet well it's because it's about
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:13.520]  breaking eggs so bob daisy again a national writer who researches gun issues is here and
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:18.960]  he's going to break down now the real documents what the treaty really does and what the un
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:24.320]  framers of this interpreted as because they write it vague for the general public but then you've
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:30.480]  got the heads of these agencies saying exactly what this means so here's the proof of what the
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:36.240]  un's planning with your guns and don't believe that it's beaten it's a good chance it's going to
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:41.120]  pass the senate just like india they said wouldn't pass it did or obama care wouldn't pass they do
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:48.080]  that to kill opposition bob daisy in studio break it down for us alex thank you for having me back
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:52.960]  on i haven't been here in a few years and things have changed around here and i i wanted i'm i'm
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:58.480]  very impressed with what obama has built here for you i am so impressed i really am this it's
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:03.360]  bigger it's more modern it's got more neat stuff in it obama built it i know he did and i i you
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:09.520]  know when he told me i didn't build my business too i was shocked all 34 years ago i started doing
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:15.040]  things i'm actually made my own first sign from a hardware store without a plywood and red paint
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:22.080]  you make screens doors you actually make things oh you factor window screens you know and but i
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:26.000]  always thought that we were i've always thought that i was doing that the screening table you just
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:31.600]  brought up by the way i could have swore i built it from scratch i could have swore i did that but
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:36.640]  apparently no i just moved that microphone closer to you but i didn't obama did that well apparently
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:41.200]  apparently i had a lot of help because no no obama did when i when i reached over and moved that
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:45.520]  over that was that was a government which is which is him's young ill because government's god
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:49.600]  he and he gave me power to do it it's a great segue into obama because before i talk about
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:56.080]  all this gun control stuff i want to thank president obama barack hussain barack the quack obama i
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:00.800]  would like to thank him for being the best gun salesman to come down the pike since bill clinton
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:07.920]  thank you very much have a small guns gun department in my store uh barack is the driver of gun sales
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:12.800]  in the united states of america today and uh so we'll want to thank him for that little increase
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:17.200]  in business there because i don't think anybody could have done it as well as as he has done it
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:21.280]  good good you better learn to thank him yeah well because you know and like north korea don't
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:25.920]  fold a newspaper that's got his image on it or that's death and your whole family goes to re-education
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:33.120]  camp well i look i'm glad you asked me on because you know i think you asked me on probably because
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:38.880]  you remembered that document i gave you back in 2001 from unidire that's the united's nation's
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:44.640]  institute for disarmament research what i want to say here is that anyone that's new to this
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:50.000]  debate as to whether or not the union is serious about sticking anti-second amendment stuff in
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:55.920]  that treaty all you got to do is get a historical perspective of what's going on and it's very easy
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:00.480]  to do all you got to do is go to go to the un website like i did back 14 years ago and just
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:06.960]  look around you will find more anti-freedom more anti-second amendment more anti- united states
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:11.280]  more anti-constitution more anti-billar rights stuff there then you can possibly shake a stick
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:18.320]  at i just looked into finding one one time and i gave it to you and that document was called
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:24.240]  removing military weapons from civilian hands and it was written by uh christoph carl and
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:30.800]  patricia lewis in august of 2000 unidire united nations institute for disarmament research and
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:36.800]  they define the problem and they talk about the problem is weapons small arms and they say that
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:40.240]  they're you know they're killing and maiming everybody throughout the world all by themselves
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:44.400]  they apparently they just do things all by themselves and this was a big un treaty where
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:50.080]  they were trying to ratify it before in july of 2001 and the the key sentence in this thing
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:56.320]  which is the one that screams which is the one that you've been using for over a decade
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:16:59.040]  is this sentence
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:08.160]  such weapons distort societies make it increasingly difficult for a society to rebuild itself following
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:13.360]  a period of bloody conflict but this is what it says right here these such weapons make it harder
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:21.760]  for the state to to regain the legitimate monopoly of force now if any of you people are americans
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:27.120]  and we're and have grown up in this country and we're taught things like subversive subversive
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:32.560]  literature like the constitution and the bill of rights things like that that statement
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:41.520]  is that right there the united nations their whole mantra everything they're about is 180
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:47.760]  degrees opposite to what we here in the united states hold dear and they took the guns from
[02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:53.120]  one tribe in rwanda and sat back and helped kill the other tribe because they were the landowners
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:57.520]  i mean the un's murdering people themselves all over the world with the second amendment of course
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:01.120]  we always say it's the teeth of the constitution it's the teeth of the bill of rights if you don't
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:07.680]  have that the rest of it is just you know toilet paper if you can't defend yourself but the deal
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:15.680]  is if the united nations believes that government monopoly of force is a good thing that is exact
[02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:22.320]  100 degree 180 degrees opposite of what we believe that you know when what did thomas jefferson say
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:27.120]  when the when the people have the the power the government fears the people that's good you have
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:31.360]  you have liberty and when the government's got everything and the people fear the government
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:37.120]  you have tyranny where in the world would any american glom on to the idea or agree with the
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:41.680]  idea that government monopoly of force is a good thing well where would americans think
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:45.920]  that you didn't build your business the government did i mean this is this is how out of control
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:52.320]  these people are well the actual later on in this document they talk about they can't they take a
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:58.720]  swipe at the nra now the nra of course you know in my world is kind of weak weak and wimpy
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:04.480]  relative to say gun owners of america but okay the nra has been doing a pretty good job on this
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:09.280]  except for the fact that they're an NGO at the at the u n but they talk about all these things
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:15.680]  they want to do to pick up all these guns this is about picking up not just military guns but
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:21.440]  anything that's semi-automatic got that they define semi-automatic as a military weapon and that's
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:26.160]  why even forb says it's register and ban semi-autos that's what the treaty does that they're talking
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:31.280]  about all these different ways of doing this which is to take up gun take up uh civilian weapons
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:36.080]  worldwide and they talk about brokering ammunition control they specifically mentioned
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:42.560]  uh 7.62 and 5.56 millimeter which are the most some of the most popular military rounds but then
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:47.520]  they talk about the civil society campaign and the civil and what they what they say is right
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:51.440]  here they'll stay there we're going to keep getting into the actual documents and you found a new
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:55.600]  document as well yes i can we have a copy of the united nations program for general
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:20:00.240]  complete disarmament in a peaceful world u.s government policy is try to ban our guns

[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:13.440]  conquered okay bob this is a short segment long segment coming up again you're reading from exhibit
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:20.800]  one july 2001 at the un as they're debating formulating the treaty please continue all right
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:26.160]  so what we're talking about is uh how how they want to disarm you they want to take your guns away
[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:32.640]  from you the historical context is what i'm talking about the historical context it go every it's not
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:36.880]  like something new if they do it all the time that's their thing now they've done it in countless
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:40.800]  countries they take all the guns and they line you up and kill you that's what totalitarian
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:46.880]  control freaks do i mean it's it you know don't be brain dead all right this is a this is they
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:51.520]  talk about the advantages of being able to take all the military style weapons away from civilians
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:56.400]  worldwide if a concerted campaign were to be formed to remove such weapons from civilian
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:26:01.600]  hands this would have a number of distinct advantages and one of the advantages is it
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:06.560]  would be hard for the anti-control lobby to argue against such an initiative after all
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:11.600]  who could easily justify the right for civilians to bear arms built for military purposes and
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:17.200]  thus argue taking automatic and semi-automatic weapons off the streets of cities and out of
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:26.320]  schools all right there who could argue the right of civilians to bear arms uh uh let me
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:33.680]  think uh the founding fathers now they're saying it's it's you have a right to not be in danger
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:37.520]  from them what just like chicago in new york where only the criminals have guns and you're in hell
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:42.240]  so and again the point military purposes well that's what the second amendment is all about
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:47.680]  isn't it remember the atf last year was going to ban bottom loading shotguns but which is over
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:53.280]  60 of them and said because they're non-sporting shotguns ain't for sporting no they have nothing
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:58.880]  to do with sporting i remember uh susanna hupp was testifying before a congressional committee
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:04.800]  many years ago and chuckie humor my favorite new york senator who was a congressman back then was
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:08.720]  had smoke coming out of his ears when she was talking and she said i got news for you the
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:14.000]  second amendment is not about duck hunting it's about people like us being able to protect ourselves
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:22.160]  from people like you oh and old chuckie oh man you could see the smoke coming out of it's fundamental
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:27.200]  the tyrants want to disarm people yeah and you and his tyrants that i want to talk about
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:32.560]  the big picture you you can't take the second amendment and you just read we're at the big
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:37.120]  meeting they're saying nobody should be able to have guns who could argue that who could imagine
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:41.360]  like who could imagine you built your business yeah i mean it's that crazy who could imagine
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:46.880]  you don't love north korea but what i want to talk about alex is legitimacy where you know for
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:52.560]  example i i have a problem with the nra and that they are a NGO non-governmental organization at the
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:57.760]  un because they are participating in un stuff and i know that they're getting dirt from the
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:02.480]  un and putting it out and showing people but you know my grandfather used to say i will tone
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:08.240]  down what he said but he said if you play with stuff you get some on you and that's true but i
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:14.240]  just i don't understand exactly why they do what they do being an NGO at the un i you know i have
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:20.080]  a little problem with that but the the large historical perspective that i'm talking about
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:27.200]  is where where does the un get this legitimacy what why why that's like george soros and the
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:32.160]  white house fund these watchdogs who lie and say they're not george soros funded and get caught
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:37.280]  and then they sit there posing and saying what's real and what isn't i mean we go oh you say you
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:42.960]  you know that the sky is red it must be because you said so what what gives you in this legitimacy
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:50.000]  what is the un okay the un was founded back in 45 by the roger fellers and the guy running the whole
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:54.880]  thing was alger hiss communist a communist a eastern establishment member member of the council
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:29:00.000]  on farm relations i think there was 30 or 40 council on farm relations member involved in
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:05.760]  that initial conference in san francisco alger hiss personally flew the treaty
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:11.680]  to the president to sign it and then of course he was later arrested for being we're working for
[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:18.000]  joseph stalin and given the order of the red star for bravery behind enemy lines but i digress
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:24.640]  you know but the thing is un is not legitimate it is i mean how many of the governments at the
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:30.880]  un would you say are legitimate governments that actually derive no it's a complete and total fraud
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:37.440]  but the banksters created it to transfer our liberties and freedoms into to transfer our
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:42.480]  constitution into so they could claim it was legitimate and could override us i want to get
[02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:49.120]  into the treating what you're saying though is if you if you if you if you're a tin horn dig stay

[02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:08.400]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that
[02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:13.440]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:17.200]  have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:22.000]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:28.640]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient

[02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:08.400]  lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced colloidal silver solutions
[02:32:08.400 --> 02:32:12.240]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been
[02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:17.520]  designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is mario
[02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:22.960]  safaldi and i'm the developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:27.840]  produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper
[02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:33.520]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas

[02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:41.520]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us bob daisy writer for the new
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:46.560]  american magazine good friend of mine for at least 14 years is here in studio with us okay we've
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:51.120]  been talking about the u.n. how it was founded you're welcome to get into all that but let's
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:55.280]  race through you've already covered one document let's get into seven two seven seven let's get
[02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:59.440]  into a new document you've discovered because i'm going to have my great writers you're welcome
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:05.600]  to do it too write a whole article out of this just more proof that the u.n. wants you disarmed so
[02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:10.160]  they can take good care of you like they do all over the world which means lining up and blowing
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:14.800]  your heads off before they take your property bob daisy please continue alex my point about
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:21.680]  legitimacy is that the u.n. has no legitimacy and so why do we spend so much time funding them
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:25.920]  and helping them along and all that obviously the bankers control the whole thing fine whatever
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:30.640]  but i think it's lost in the shuffle that they aren't legitimate they have no legitimacy at all
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:35.680]  and the best solution is to defund them and get out that's the best solution just kick them out
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:39.840]  because if we kicked them out we would we take away all that financial support the whole thing
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:43.520]  would collapse it's a house of cards no it's a bunch of criminals yeah it's a bunch of criminals
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:47.360]  it's a bunch of criminals they go to new york they go to bloomingdales they get a $2,000 suit
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:51.600]  they get themselves some kind of a fancy Cadillac with some flags on it a diplomatic immunity
[02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:55.280]  yeah and they can violate all the traffic laws everybody kisses their butt and and all of a
[02:34:55.280 --> 02:35:01.360]  sudden they're legitimate almost every government in the world is illegitimate because they do not
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:04.960]  have their power from the consent of the government yet you have a whole bunch of them get together
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:10.000]  that's another point obama says the government makes everything well i mean if it's a small
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  government and and it helps guard rights and is empowered and actually has the consent and is popular
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:20.720]  then occasionally it's not a bad thing but when they're not don't have the consent they're always
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:25.760]  like bone cancer i guess i guess what i'm trying to say is you know if you if you have kids and
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:29.920]  there's a daycare center that they go to would you want the president of the child molesters
[02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:35.760]  association of america run the daycare center no what the point is the u n is completely illegitimate
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:42.320]  now having said that let me go on all right that article that i was reading from a while ago was
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:47.920]  2000 2001 they do it all the time they want to take your guns away i found the new one
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:52.800]  improving the effectiveness of the program of action on small arms
[02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:59.600]  implementation challenges and opportunities written by a sarah parker unidire again uh
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:05.840]  2011 so i figured you know unidire was a good place to find a dirt on the un and sure enough
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:11.920]  it's a great place to find dirt on the un this document uh wants to improve the effectiveness
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:16.880]  of their program of action on small arms and guess what their program of action on small arms is
[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:21.680]  get rid of them get them out of civilian control as in the previous document then guys document
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:26.480]  cam zoom in even though it's on me so don't go ahead and read it okay and then we'll flip it right
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:30.400]  side up in a minute just all those documents all right this is what we're talking about improving
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:35.440]  the effectiveness of the program of action on small arms which is something they've been after
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:41.440]  all the time you cannot have an armed population and enslave them and they know this the bankers
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:46.720]  know this the un knows that everybody knows it so why don't you know it all right now what they
[02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:51.120]  talk about this is not the whole document i just printed off a few pages they talk about all these
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:57.120]  different levels of doing things in order to control small arms uh and i'll just read a couple of
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:01.440]  things marking and tracing you ever heard of that yeah marking and tracing that's what they want to
[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:06.080]  do micro stamping whatever they want to do it they want to they want to do that record keeping
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:10.720]  what do you think record key registration what do you think record keeping means is that some
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:16.720]  little bookkeeper in the back room just jotting stuff down for no reason no record keeping disposal
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:24.720]  and destruction of confiscated seized or collected small arms collected collected collected moratoria
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:29.200]  on small that's why they have these legal gun buybacks to create the image of cops and people
[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:36.320]  turning guns in yeah moratoria on small arms and light weapons manufacture which is what obama
[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:40.240]  has said he's going to go after the manufacturer what is what is that what is bloomberg doing
[02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:46.720]  shooing them that's the goal shut them down so they have a they have a kind of a a chart here
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:51.920]  of various different ways that they want to get their stuff done it's called description of
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:57.360]  implementation challenge identified implementation challenge now what is it implementation that
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:02.320]  means you want to implement this the challenges are having problems with it okay so we have a
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:07.600]  description of implementation challenge identified they have all different things listed one of them
[02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:14.480]  is that the the firearms protocol has not yet been ratified oh really one of them is greater
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:20.640]  regulation of it says greater it doesn't say greater it says regulation of firearms ownership
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:28.560]  regulation of firearms ownership what is that that's in the trading uh greater controls and
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:33.840]  responsibility this whole thing's written for individuals yeah greater controls and responsibility
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:40.560]  for firearms owners is required for firearms owners is required all right they have an
[02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:45.040]  inadequate legal framework they're complaining about keep on going record keeping they have
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:50.880]  lack of funds for an electronic database oh oh boo they don't have enough money to have their
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:56.080]  electronic database so they need to ship guns into mexico to call for here's another need national
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:39:01.680]  electronic register or database and they're talking about every nation here you know of
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:07.520]  going on down the description of implementation of challenge identified need to train law enforcement
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:13.120]  providers in weapons collection management and destruction i'm sorry let me did i did i just
[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:19.840]  read that from the unidire website hang on just say need to train law enforcement providers in
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:25.200]  weapons collection and destruction need to train the local police in confiscating guns
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:29.760]  well we have the army document they're they're training to take guns it's public they have a
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:34.960]  problem here they have lack of financial support for collection and destruction so that's a
[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:40.000]  challenge that they that they have to face at the u n they don't have they don't have enough money so
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:44.800]  they're probably gonna use the lost treaty to tax everybody so they can fund this thing i don't
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:51.200]  know uh training is needed in modern methods of destruction so they need to train some more people
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:56.000]  on how to destroy the weapons after they collect them of course in australian england they use a
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:01.040]  giant metal buzz saw and just chop them up now here's here the next one of the segments is called
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:07.680]  public awareness otherwise known as propaganda to reinforce ongoing awareness campaigns to
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:14.240]  prevent the illicit ownership transfer and use of firearms so in other words to kind you out of
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:18.880]  your guns basically and not let you sell them to your neighbor like which is banning the gun show
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:23.520]  loophole doesn't let you give a gun to your grandson like the previous document i was reading from
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:29.920]  was talking about is get rid of these things and and we need a civil society campaign because
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:33.760]  after all who could argue against taking these guns away because it's for the children
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:40.400]  it's just ongoing now let me read this part um instruction and education needed to overcome
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:47.760]  fear due to misleading information in context of civilian surrender of small arms and light
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:54.320]  weapons context of civilian surrender all over the world they come and take all the guns and
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:58.960]  then murder everybody or have the next tribe do it and wherever they're in control in countries
[02:40:58.960 --> 02:41:03.600]  they totally ban guns in new york and chicago where they're in control of bandam and we've got the
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:08.240]  attorney general saying he wants to ban them uh when he was deputy attorney general but we're
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:14.320]  supposed to ignore all of that because they go on to say we've got all the basically propagandized
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:18.320]  we've got all the basically propagandized people that we're not going to take their guns right it's
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:23.520]  it's like the movie act act where your friends where your friends don't run we are your friends
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:29.200]  blam yeah yeah that's the same thing all right now here's another one mark in the description
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:36.160]  of marking and tracing lack of regional coordination of the system for the registration of legal
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:42.400]  weapons yeah that's and again forbs did their analysis and said why all gun owners should
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:48.400]  be up in arms and it says it registers and then it bans semi-auto and and blocks importation
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:54.480]  to begin with and this is not even a big issue in america right now because george soros says
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:59.840]  it's not real he said so you know i mean if a tornado is about to hit your town just call
[02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:05.360]  soros up and say say there's no tornado and he'll say no tornado and it'll just disappear i hate to
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:09.280]  disappear no joy because just like kim jong-il i hate to disagree with mr soros but right here
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:13.440]  under the section description now he admits he wants to ban your guns but it doesn't exist if
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:18.800]  you resist him record keeping it says right here there is the need to develop a regional system for
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:28.320]  registering legal weapons in each country oh in each country there is a need can you and the treaty
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:32.240]  just leaves it wide open for the union to do ever once don't you think that if they got this they
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:36.880]  would share information in the interest of global cooperation well they said they want mexico to be
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:43.760]  able to sue because of fast and furious sue america not not the people that ship the guns down there
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:49.200]  to destabilize mexico yeah now we have another one regional security is a problem an implementation
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:54.480]  challenge uh and what this is i just i just highlighted this because it's funny uh it says
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:43:01.600]  continued unchecked outflow of guns from north america no no they did fast and furious not
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:06.240]  just blame the second amendment but to make it an international issue to get the treaty ratified
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:11.840]  yeah it's it's all part of the same thing these people do everything you name any aspect of society
[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:18.640]  any aspect of human behavior these people are on it in order to disarm you now uh this is the
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:23.920]  kicker right here you say well this is what unideers wants to do but what does this have to do with
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:28.400]  the treaty what does it have to do with this arms trade treaty that they're talking about right now
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:34.240]  up in new york what what does it have to do with it well how about this one of the questions raised
[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:39.440]  during the united air workshop was whether states would prioritize implementations of the poa that's
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:44.720]  program of action if it were a legally binding treaty as opposed to a political instrument
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:51.840]  in this regard developments with respect to a future arms trade treaty att arms trade treaty
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:58.160]  were noted some of the poa commitments relating to international transfers of small arms and
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:04.480]  light weapons may be covered and enhanced by an arms trade treaty with the added bonus that they
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:10.560]  will be legally binding so you do an arms trade treaty that's really an individual arms control
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:15.200]  disarmament treaty which is the united states program for general and complete disarmament
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:21.040]  in a peaceful world even the armies and police disarmed after they go through this tumultuous
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:25.520]  takeover period then it's only the un that's armed now let me repeat that again because that's
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:31.840]  the central reason why i'm on talking to you right now this is unidire the united state united
[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:38.160]  nations institute for disarmament research one of their paper the policy board that writes to you
[02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:42.880]  and treating and they're sitting there tagging this paper there's all their problems that they're
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:48.080]  having getting all the little gun confiscations done and they're tagging it to this future arms
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:52.720]  trade treaty which is right now and they say the bonus is we'll sneak it through in an arms control
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:45:01.200]  treaty with the added bonus that they will be legally binding now ladies and gentlemen i don't
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:07.760]  know what more you need to understand that uh this arms trade treaty is just another trojan horse
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:13.200]  well it's not even a trojan horse though it's it's just that they count on no one reading it so so
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:16.960]  show that document the document cam now you got a whole stack only got like 10 minutes of broadcast
[02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:24.880]  time left here uh 7277 tell us about that since it's right there 72 77 here's my here 72 77 freedom
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:30.640]  from war was a state department publication printed way back in the day a kind of a cooperation
[02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:35.680]  between united nations and and the united states state department state department publication
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:41.520]  72 77 flip through it very loving very very briefly what this thing is this is the policy
[02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:45.760]  of the u.s government the point here is before i read through this the point of this if you think
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:52.640]  if it says in here that the united states was agreeing in 1961 to disarm our own military do
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:59.120]  you understand that to disarm our own military to turn our nuclear arsenal over to the united
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:04.960]  nations it says that in here now if you think that the un is going to not mess with our second
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:11.120]  amendment yet they're going to disarm our military hey you're in lala land buddy now some of the
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:17.440]  stuff in this document uh again uh this thing is you can find my my shellet it's amazing i've
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:21.760]  got a copy of the original one around my son actually flip that back on to see the the intro page
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:25.440]  yeah this is second page from the second page second page start flipping through it bob okay
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:28.960]  there you go freedom from war okay you're in a right spot now okay freedom from war of course
[02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:34.960]  now i gotta go sideways because it's printed this way but this document united states program for
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:41.440]  general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world is 1961 uh the john birch society actually
[02:46:41.440 --> 02:46:45.680]  reproduced a bunch of these back in the day with the blue cover and everything that's the copy i got
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:50.560]  very evil one of my kids actually found an original at the university that he was attending many years
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:54.640]  ago in original 1961 and it's a spitting image there they didn't make any change wasn't that
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:47:00.800]  for sam houston right houston sam houston state university so yeah it's real and remember when
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:04.640]  he was going there to become a state police remember they had that whole u n function well
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:09.360]  and they were teaching folks that the communist chinese were good no what what that was yeah
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:13.760]  you got an amazing memory alex what it what it was was that they were they were had a
[02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:20.240]  display up in the the um the foyer of their main criminal justice building that was displaying
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:27.280]  the communist chinese flag and various soviet and chinese military police medallions in the
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:33.040]  showcase it's like what and and that's what that was all about and i asked him to uh
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:37.920]  um to get some pictures of that and he couldn't because they took it down and i said well why
[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:42.320]  they take it down he says he said don't worry dad it was alumni day they took it all down
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:49.440]  they didn't want the alumni seeing it but they'll put it back up tomorrow sure enough you know
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:53.920]  and there you have all this you know that you have these soviet emblems for police you know the
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:59.280]  cheka which was a pre precursor to the the i think it was the nkvd or no no continue
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:03.120]  because of the right you got like 20 documents there keep going summary disarmament goal and
[02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:08.480]  objectives this is 1961 the disbanding of all national armed forces and the prohibition
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:14.080]  of their reestablishment in any form whatsoever other than those required to preserve internal
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:20.640]  order and for contributions to united nation peace force and that's what nato is now the
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:27.200]  elimination from national arsenals of all armaments including weapons of mass destruction
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:32.880]  and the means for their delivery other than those required for united nation and there's
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:37.760]  the disarmament of the un gets to have theirs they get yeah they get the dukes we understand
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:43.120]  that the un gets the nukes now if you if you think that the this is our own government policy this
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:47.760]  is 1961 keep going keep going state department stuff i'm gonna see if i can find some more
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:51.600]  stuff i might have highlighted here they've got our helmets getting smaller the un's getting bigger
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:56.160]  yeah shows the force build up yeah and they want the russian army to go down here's now you
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:00.160]  will talk about back to the armament thing because that's what we're talking about today
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:06.480]  the manufacturer of armaments would be prohibited except for those of agreed taps and quantities
[02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:13.120]  to be used by the un peace force and all those required to maintain internal order all other
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:18.560]  armaments would be destroyed imagine a world with the un with high-tech weapons we're running

[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:50.320]  that you know the point is again i'm going history these are crazy people i'm going hurry we're
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:53.120]  almost out of time race through all these other documents but they're going to ban our guns

[02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:24.560]  listen america isn't perfect but it's been the best country the world's ever seen for liberty and
[02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:31.360]  freedom and incredible cornucopia of ideas and and it came from individuals it came from rugged
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:36.960]  individualism it came from freedom and that's why they spend all day telling you how bad america
[02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:42.880]  is and you know what if i just knew about american history i think we were bad then i studied world
[02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:48.400]  history i looked at every other country and let me tell you we have been the best we were the model
[02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:54.560]  of the world now i just got chills ladies and gentlemen we have serious tyrants in control
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:59.840]  again they're not just boss hogs that want to run things they want to reeducate to kill we've shown
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:07.120]  you their own statements they won our guns and thank god for the founders because 236 years ago
[02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:12.240]  that second amendment is there it actually came about a decade later with the bill of rise but the
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:17.200]  point is it was about guns it started when the redcoats came to confiscate guns and here we are
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:22.400]  200 plus years later with that time bomb against tyranny three four five million guns a month getting
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:27.520]  sold all-time record and people know there've been national surveys they say i don't trust this
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:32.480]  government and you know why you shouldn't because the average fbi person is not a bad person the
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:37.280]  average cop's not bad but the people running the government are enemies of this country there's a
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:41.440]  red linked article that everybody's got to get we'll do five minutes overdraft so bob can finish
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:47.040]  it's red linked bankers declare us and europe conquered guys i want to have that put back
[02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:53.120]  as the top link on featured news that article is total proof of their criminal takeover in
[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:57.040]  their own words and of course it's getting no attention and stuff that i didn't think would
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:01.120]  has gone viral and there's no controlling what goes viral whatever i want to go viral doesn't
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:07.840]  go viral whatever the point is it must go out get it out to everyone it is a confession by
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:13.520]  these criminals continuing this is the official un global declaration of human rights it gives you
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.160]  all these wonderful rights especially communism rights to other people's money you built your
[02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:23.440]  neighbor's business you painted their oil painting you made their song uh you you know you knit that
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:29.280]  dress you had that baby even though you didn't you be all of this but in the end what do they
[02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:34.800]  tell you bob what they tell you in the universal declaration of human rights again 1945 founding
[02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:39.600]  era document of the un this goes way back to the very founding what they tell you is you got all
[02:56:39.600 --> 02:56:42.960]  these glorious right by the way they don't mean any of it by the way but they tell you you've got
[02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:50.880]  all these glorious rights and then at the very last article 29 section 3 these rights and freedoms
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:54.960]  may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the united nations
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:56:59.680]  so if you disagree with the united nations if you oppose anything they want to do you have no
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:05.040]  right their purposes that means whatever the dictator in there whatever the security council obama
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:11.440]  heading it whatever they want they they're read it again they will do it to themselves too by the
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:16.240]  way these rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles
[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:20.960]  of the united nations the purposes that's whatever they want and for example this is off off topic
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:25.840]  from guns but for example several years ago there was a SARS conference in new york about the big
[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:32.640]  disease remember SARS in in asia and the united nations press corps invited some doctor from taiwan
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:39.840]  which is like oh no not not taiwan well that's no good well kofi anon kicked him out he said no you
[02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:45.520]  can't come and and because that would upset china and the press corps actually asked kofi in a press
[02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:50.560]  conference well sir why did you what about article 19 of the universal declaration which says we can
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:56.080]  trade information freely and right to travel and travel and with regard to borders so we can all
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:58:01.440]  share information sir and kofi looked at the reporter and said you must understand our
[02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:09.920]  principles and one of them is there is only one china so what what kofi this is to his own
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:14.560]  principle you're so good well oh my god it's truly that's a word for word he said that
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:22.880]  he any any implemented article 29 exactly he he oh article 29 section 3 overwrote article 19
[02:58:22.880 --> 02:58:26.800]  because article 19 says you only have freedom of the press if you if we like what you're doing
[02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:30.400]  well that's why they ban all these people from the un events
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:36.320]  stay there we'll do five more minutes folks you ignore this information at your own
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:52.240]  peril they want your guns they want you to be their slaves
[02:58:52.240 --> 02:59:10.160]  we may have to go space trucking to get off this planet away from the un find some freedom

[02:59:50.640 --> 02:59:54.080]  i'm i'm been totally shaken by obama statements that i didn't have anything to do with the
[02:59:54.080 --> 02:59:57.760]  creation of a my small business that just that just blew me away i have trouble sleeping and
[02:59:57.760 --> 03:00:02.160]  not worrying about that because i could have swore i did something i don't know what it was i did
[03:00:02.160 --> 03:00:06.800]  something you know 34 years ago i've been doing this i've been apparently i've been doing nothing
[03:00:06.800 --> 03:00:09.440]  for 30 you got a pretty big hardware store and i've been in there there's like two or three
[03:00:09.440 --> 03:00:13.840]  people sometimes running it well there's you know it's it's hey it's america you want to talk about

[03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:31.120]  evil god you're bad i'm an evil capitalist pig yes i am i am also i am also an imperialist
[03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:37.040]  exploiter of the masses thank you thank you i'm proud of it just just like okay finish finish
[03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:41.920]  up because you you didn't go research all these u n documents either no this doesn't exist short
[03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:46.240]  sorrow said something no but again my point uh the point are you proud the white house is now
[03:00:46.240 --> 03:00:50.160]  attacking me routinely i love it when they attack you alex i mean the bigger you get the more they
[03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:55.520]  attack you and then then you bigger you get anyway i'm sorry finish up they'll learn to leave you
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:01:01.440]  alone but they want nothing no at the point of the point of this thing is in in context of firearms
[03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:07.680]  anything they want you disarmed they want you to be a slave because they cannot take you over if you
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:13.520]  can defend yourself there is no legitimacy to the u n the solution is to get out of the u n
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:18.880]  defund them they will collapse of their own weight and that that cacophony of cockroaches
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:25.840]  will crawl off wherever they came from uh it's you know a cacophony of cockroaches yes okay i'm
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:34.800]  sorry i'm using big one no a gaggle of scruffulous roaches engaging in a triumphant march over the
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:39.760]  edge of the abyss yeah they'll just go back where they came from i mean the point is with the universal
[03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:44.240]  declaration you got to read it because if you read it you can read between the lines actually
[03:01:44.880 --> 03:01:49.520]  article 28 the one before 29 says that you're entitled to a new world order by the way so
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:55.840]  where they can implement all they can line you up and blow your head off and all these rides that you
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:02:00.640]  have in the k unless you're the u n biological diversity assessment from 96 the full text says
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:04.560]  they're going to establish a neo feudal system and turn the resources off and kill us i mean
[03:02:04.560 --> 03:02:09.440]  that is really fun there is you just if you read this document you're going to think it's funny
[03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:14.640]  because you're going to think well look it's it's so smiley face what it is alex this is it
[03:02:14.640 --> 03:02:23.280]  united nations is an excrement sandwich with white frosting on the outside and some blue stuff and
[03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:28.880]  some little wheat stalks and stuff it looks real real good it's all pretty it's all light blue and
[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:35.440]  all fluffy and everything but don't take a bite that's it right there don't take a bite because
[03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:41.760]  that's all it is janna poletano likes it she's a dung beetle well maybe she is but she like well
[03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:45.360]  you know she's a control freak i mean control freaks really like that kind of stuff that you
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:50.400]  know maggots and all kinds of things get in there and grow and whatnot but a regular human being
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:56.400]  when you take off that nice wedding cake frosting with a little blue little blue wheat stalks and
[03:02:56.400 --> 03:03:00.240]  stuff and a little global emblem and stuff when you take that off of there you ain't gonna like
[03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:06.560]  what you see well in the un because of its immunity it gave itself because the bankers now the bankers
[03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:10.480]  want to give their hedge funds immunity they're giving everything immunity and just declaring
[03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:17.680]  because they have guns it's total piracy flaw the jungle literally they're creating global
[03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:22.160]  government that they're exempt from i mean that's really it it's so hellish it's hard to believe
