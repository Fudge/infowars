[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:31.640]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones it is
[00:31.640 --> 00:40.720]  Wednesday the 17th day of November 2010 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours and
[00:40.720 --> 00:49.360]  we're going to have wide open phones throughout the broadcast on the economy the exploding TSA
[00:49.360 --> 00:55.520]  tyranny and the revolt against it we're gonna be breaking down what's happening in the Middle
[00:55.520 --> 01:03.320]  East politics around the world Ron Paul's golden opportunity reports the Wall Street Journal who
[01:03.320 --> 01:08.680]  better to host the debate over sound money in Congress and the Fed's most persistent critic
[01:08.680 --> 01:14.600]  in the next two days they're gonna choose the new leadership for the committees I think you
[01:14.600 --> 01:18.760]  ought to be speaker of the house but that's gonna go to Boehner but they're talking about
[01:18.760 --> 01:26.440]  Ron Paul being chairman of the banking committee so that is obviously a very very important news
[01:26.440 --> 01:34.880]  and information we're gonna be going over that today also we reported a few weeks ago about USA
[01:34.880 --> 01:42.440]  today and their breakdown that more federal workers pay tops $150,000 under Obama in just
[01:42.440 --> 01:50.600]  less than two years they've more than doubled the amount of federal employees that are making
[01:50.600 --> 02:05.960]  over $150,000 a year just just incredible and that complements this report members of US
[02:05.960 --> 02:12.000]  Congress get richer despite sour economy see who's getting richer here the government and
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.880]  the big private central banks and that's it those are the only divisions in this country
[02:19.880 --> 02:24.880]  getting wealthier and and what are the two parasitic groups government and and who was
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.960]  big government financed by who was big government created by it wasn't by the welfare mom down
[02:29.960 --> 02:34.400]  the street as the corporate media likes to tell you no it was by the big mega banks who
[02:34.400 --> 02:39.440]  own the military industrial complex that's where most of the money goes that's where
[02:39.440 --> 02:44.920]  most of your taxes go now state local federal is servicing the debt you notice your taxes
[02:44.920 --> 02:50.120]  go up up up up up up up but your services go down down down down down down down down
[02:50.120 --> 03:00.760]  we're entering the final phase now of the parasites fully gutting this society so members
[03:00.760 --> 03:06.640]  of Congress get richer despite sour economy federal workers double in the last year and
[03:06.640 --> 03:12.160]  a half the number of people getting $150,000 or more a year and of course that's the only
[03:12.160 --> 03:16.800]  major growth sector in the country is the federal government state governments are getting
[03:16.800 --> 03:21.360]  smaller now they're being sucked away and after they've bankrupted the nation fully
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.120]  they're going to get rid of the most the federal government and it'll just be the international
[03:25.120 --> 03:29.760]  bureaucracy see the global bankers we've seen do this in other third world countries they
[03:29.760 --> 03:34.000]  come in and use big government as their tool of control up front then they phase it out
[03:34.000 --> 03:42.800]  and leave a broken down society that they can more easily control they use poverty as
[03:42.800 --> 03:48.920]  a tool of control where you've got to be a TSA worker grabbing grandma's crotch to get
[03:48.920 --> 03:53.200]  your $10 an hour because there's no other jobs you've got to join the military and go
[03:53.200 --> 03:59.200]  fight for the empire this is all been written up in textbooks this is all social engineering
[03:59.200 --> 04:05.080]  imagine the most cold-blooded evil you can and then double that and you've gotten somewhere
[04:05.080 --> 04:11.120]  near the mind of the new world order fact I've engaged in an exercise I will imagine
[04:11.120 --> 04:15.640]  the most horrible wicked thing I can then search engine it and I'll find governments doing
[04:15.640 --> 04:22.320]  it out on the open or major corporations are they invent evil if you can think of it they're
[04:22.320 --> 04:27.440]  doing it and then some I here's another one government employees owe billions in delinquent
[04:27.440 --> 04:32.120]  taxes yeah I've seen those reports over the years where in some cases half of Congress
[04:32.120 --> 04:37.600]  isn't paying their taxes are as late government employees owe billions in delinquent taxes
[04:37.600 --> 04:45.960]  but don't worry nobody's gonna prosecute them but BBC more US households short on food efforts
[04:45.960 --> 04:51.160]  to extend Bush era tax cuts falter as talks are delayed Bloomberg that's just some of
[04:51.160 --> 04:56.160]  what's coming up the latest on the TSA and a lot more stay with us ladies and gentlemen

[05:01.880 --> 05:07.000]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.520]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:11.520 --> 05:16.400]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control
[05:16.400 --> 05:21.800]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[05:21.800 --> 05:27.760]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[05:27.760 --> 05:32.480]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year
[05:32.480 --> 05:36.840]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[05:36.840 --> 05:41.560]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in
[05:41.560 --> 05:45.760]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[06:06.960 --> 06:11.920]  unable to find work might not agree perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government
[06:11.920 --> 06:16.320]  employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't
[06:16.320 --> 06:20.920]  heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition
[06:20.920 --> 06:24.920]  to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a food

[08:06.440 --> 08:14.880]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network we're going to take a lot of
[08:14.880 --> 08:21.520]  your phone calls today on any issue any question any comment you've got your tsa horror story
[08:21.520 --> 08:27.040]  what you think about this huge backlash of resistance i believe you're going to see this
[08:27.040 --> 08:33.120]  on more and more fronts we're seeing protest all over california and many other states
[08:33.120 --> 08:37.920]  as citizens are having their taxes raised their property taxes increased their sales
[08:37.920 --> 08:42.000]  taxes increased they're losing their homes they're losing their jobs so they're getting
[08:42.000 --> 08:48.000]  their pay cut or they're getting their social security costs of living increased cut and
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.600]  then they find out in small towns four hundred five hundred six hundred eight hundred or
[08:53.600 --> 09:01.960]  more thousand dollars a year to city managers they're finding out about the fraud they're
[09:01.960 --> 09:09.440]  finding out about the double set of books that water districts school districts counties
[09:09.440 --> 09:14.760]  they will tell you about their budget but that's only the money they're spending as expenses
[09:14.760 --> 09:21.200]  they don't tell you about the annual comprehensive financial reports or the comprehensive annual
[09:21.200 --> 09:27.080]  financial reports where they take most the money and invested in derivatives and that's
[09:27.080 --> 09:36.240]  why calpers the retirement fund out in california is going bankrupt because they invested in
[09:36.240 --> 09:44.000]  derivatives and now that money's been stolen and so what you have is government bureaucracy
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.200]  with their pensions going up and their pay going up at the federal and state level some
[09:50.200 --> 09:54.400]  states are actually again starting to you know implode and that's a lesson to all these
[09:54.400 --> 09:58.760]  government bureaucrats they're going to be fleeced as well but it's at the expense of
[09:58.760 --> 10:06.800]  everybody else's pension everybody else's social security everyone else's dollar value
[10:06.800 --> 10:14.840]  everything must be sacrificed on this altar of government but only while government is
[10:14.840 --> 10:25.000]  useful to the offshore corporations that are sucking dry or a sanguating the wealth that
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.400]  is in this country the globalist don't just want to fleece you they want to render you
[10:30.400 --> 10:39.200]  down to be helpless domesticated bankrupt vassal serfs this is the road to tyranny this
[10:39.200 --> 10:46.600]  is the road to neo feudalistic serfdom in this high tech feudal system this technocratic
[10:46.600 --> 10:54.160]  feudal system this technotronic feudal system as the big new brzezinski and others have dubbed
[10:54.160 --> 11:00.240]  it this is their master plan but if you're aware of their plan and aware of how they
[11:00.240 --> 11:06.760]  give you a false left right paradigm as carol quigley bill clinton's mentor at georgetown
[11:06.760 --> 11:12.000]  wrote in tragedy and hope to paraphrase him in fact guys will you pull up that the carol
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.720]  quigley quote just put carol quigley quote in talks about controlling both parties but
[11:17.720 --> 11:23.120]  the pair that should pull it up but to paraphrase him you know and he was allowed into the elite's
[11:23.120 --> 11:29.000]  own internal annals to write a unofficial history for them to give to high level cia
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.520]  officers and others so they can actually understand what they were doing and how it worked and
[11:34.520 --> 11:38.760]  he said look we we want to continue to have two parties but there's really no difference
[11:38.760 --> 11:46.520]  in them there's just a rhetorical rhetoric difference in in in the the different ways
[11:46.520 --> 11:52.600]  they arrange the deck chairs on the titanic so that people think they're rebelling every
[11:52.600 --> 12:00.000]  election cycle but our agenda can just continue and it's that simple you know i talk a lot
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.400]  about the left right paradigm as the left wing of a bird and you got the right wing
[12:05.400 --> 12:10.880]  of a bird let's talk about the the the brain of the bird let's talk about the heart of
[12:10.880 --> 12:16.520]  the bird let's talk about its talons let's talk about the rest of the agenda or you
[12:16.520 --> 12:23.400]  could see it as a juggernaut or as a thousand foot colossus with its one all seeing cyclopsie
[12:23.400 --> 12:30.880]  and i the right wingers are controlled by the same system and they take a right wing
[12:30.880 --> 12:36.440]  establishment rhino step and then people wake up to that and they put the democrats
[12:36.440 --> 12:43.600]  back in power and so it then takes a step and it just goes on and on but what happens
[12:43.600 --> 12:47.640]  when people are aware of the trick it's game over here's the quote the argument that the
[12:47.640 --> 12:54.080]  two parties should represent opposed ideas and policies one perhaps on the right the
[12:54.080 --> 13:01.160]  other than the left is a foolish idea excepted only to doctorine and academic thinkers yeah
[13:01.160 --> 13:05.760]  but that's only part of the quote what you can do is put that full quote in to the search
[13:05.760 --> 13:10.600]  engine and then it's a whole page out of the book the books actually no i gave that book
[13:10.600 --> 13:15.680]  to a newspaper writer he never gave it back we need to buy a new tragedy and hope i gave
[13:15.680 --> 13:19.760]  that away a few months ago i can give it away i said give it back it actually about six
[13:19.760 --> 13:23.120]  months ago and i haven't gotten it back yet i need to call that guy up and say look here
[13:23.120 --> 13:34.800]  knucklehead give me my fifty dollar book back okay i'm continuing here with this information
[13:34.800 --> 13:41.360]  this is all a big joke for these people and they can find plenty of mercenaries who will
[13:41.360 --> 13:48.960]  just buy into it look most of these professors and media hit men and and and and mercenaries
[13:48.960 --> 13:55.040]  that are out there they all know what's going on i mean don't think that that we're smart
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.720]  because we've all figured this out they all figured out a long time ago and they said
[13:58.720 --> 14:03.840]  you mean i get money in power by playing along and i can choose to be part of the left wing
[14:03.840 --> 14:09.320]  version or the right wing version where do i sign up you mean i get a big house and a
[14:09.320 --> 14:15.920]  trophy wife with fake breast i'm ready to go and that's the end of it and then once
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.080]  they've sold out once they're in the system the wife wants a bigger house not a smaller
[14:20.080 --> 14:25.960]  house and so they start whoring out even faster they start selling out even more and then
[14:25.960 --> 14:33.440]  they're competing with all the other prostitutes and so you get a nation of intellectual
[14:33.440 --> 14:41.120]  reprobate prostitutes and the race of the bottom is now greased the the skids to hit
[14:41.120 --> 14:49.440]  larian stylistic hell are now complete you're guaranteed once you accept evil and corruption
[14:49.440 --> 14:54.760]  once you don't have any values except dollar signs and the bankers create that and nothing
[14:54.760 --> 14:58.840]  they get the whole world for nothing as thomas jefferson said you ever let the private banks
[14:58.840 --> 15:04.240]  take over the issuance of currency and credit our children will wake up homeless on the
[15:04.240 --> 15:09.560]  continent their forefathers conquered it's a very simple equation but we let a made off
[15:09.560 --> 15:14.520]  kinlay type scam just through pure fraud take everything over because the guys are ball
[15:14.520 --> 15:18.840]  headed and wearing suits and they must know more than we do they found the quote let's
[15:18.840 --> 15:23.760]  put it back up on screen the argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideas
[15:23.760 --> 15:28.960]  and policies one perhaps to the right and the other of the left is a foolish idea acceptable
[15:28.960 --> 15:36.640]  only by doctorine and academic thinkers or is it doctor nary and i can't read from here
[15:36.640 --> 15:42.500]  and academic thinkers instead the two parties should be almost identical so that the american
[15:42.500 --> 15:49.220]  people can throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extreme
[15:49.220 --> 15:55.760]  shifts in policy carol quigley mentored a bill clinton and that is a real quote next
[15:55.760 --> 15:59.560]  i'll get emails that's not a real quote you could just well go by the book then find
[15:59.560 --> 16:06.240]  out if i'm a liar okay but as i said we're going to open the phones up here today to
[16:06.240 --> 16:14.680]  justin crystal wilson matt chris and many others on any of these issues obviously we
[16:14.680 --> 16:22.520]  have not been covering as much financial news as much police state news or middle east news
[16:22.520 --> 16:29.800]  border news health news as i should have often on the last few weeks because this tsa story
[16:29.800 --> 16:37.640]  is so big but i think overall that's healthy because if this was a big story like oj simpson
[16:37.640 --> 16:43.280]  i would be ashamed to be involved in it or if this was a big major news cycle story you
[16:43.280 --> 16:53.760]  know dealing with prince twitley over in england and the you know bimbo he's now been hitched
[16:53.760 --> 16:58.640]  to in the latest arranged marriage i would be embarrassed to be involved in that story
[16:58.640 --> 17:05.400]  but i am very proud and i'll be quite frank with you i relish i relish the fact that
[17:05.400 --> 17:12.760]  we're now into week three of this tsa story and we're into week two of it being one of
[17:12.760 --> 17:18.040]  the biggest stories if not the biggest story in the world there's no doubt right now it
[17:18.040 --> 17:23.120]  is dominating all of the news cycles it is an issue they did not want to be on the front
[17:23.120 --> 17:28.880]  burner you've got from the new york times the wall street journal to atlantic monthly
[17:28.880 --> 17:36.360]  to forbes to the london guardian to mother jones left right libertarian populist you
[17:36.360 --> 17:41.680]  name it saying it's wrong it's humiliation it's slave training it doesn't protect us
[17:41.680 --> 17:47.560]  from terrorist it's a fraud it needs to end and by the way the tsa's been lying saying
[17:47.560 --> 17:51.700]  they don't squeeze our junk and saying this has always been done and by the way they're
[17:51.700 --> 17:56.760]  lying about the radiation dangers and by the way they're lying about it being discreet
[17:56.760 --> 18:01.760]  and by the way i mean that's all over the news today the media is catching them in lies
[18:01.760 --> 18:10.800]  just three days ago in u.s.a. today and another speech as she gave the head of homeland security
[18:10.800 --> 18:17.120]  janet napolitano who talks like the godfather thought enough that she's a creepy jackboot
[18:17.120 --> 18:22.040]  you know weird archetypal jackboot lady but at the same time she gives these speeches
[18:22.040 --> 18:28.240]  and is like oh let me tell you about it never once did you come to my office and have a
[18:28.240 --> 18:35.800]  cup of coffee with me never never once did you come you know to any of our family events
[18:35.800 --> 18:40.880]  and you never you never you never wanted to be involved with us you came to this country
[18:40.880 --> 18:46.600]  you found a paradise and you didn't think you needed people like me but now you do now you
[18:46.600 --> 18:53.400]  do we are doing this for your own safety we are sticking our hands down your pants and
[18:53.400 --> 18:59.360]  grabbing your your testicles and your female parts and your and your breast and we're fondling
[18:59.360 --> 19:05.840]  your ten month old to stop men in caves that well it took down those towers that day i
[19:05.840 --> 19:11.160]  am and by the way i'm going to be out of here in a few years and i got a protect shirt off
[19:11.160 --> 19:16.920]  he's the one that made the order for the machines which people like alex jones believe is illegal
[19:16.920 --> 19:21.040]  but hey we run the show what are they going to do we control the fb i am the justice department

[25:13.520 --> 25:23.640]  pants just last week and earlier this week mr pistol and miss don carlione napolitano
[25:23.640 --> 25:30.120]  came out and said openly that we're not doing anything we haven't done for years and technically
[25:30.120 --> 25:36.560]  that was true in lawyers speak they've selectively done these strip searches and these rape downs
[25:36.560 --> 25:41.080]  for eight nine years that i know of but very selectively no no no now they do it out in
[25:41.080 --> 25:50.560]  public lifting dresses pulling down blouses in public and now i mean this is happening
[25:50.560 --> 25:56.720]  to comedians to news people it's happening to women they stick their hand completely
[25:56.720 --> 26:03.560]  in your pants and grab your testicles and it gets worse they aren't even changing the
[26:03.560 --> 26:10.320]  gloves so you literally could get venereal diseases like herpes or crabs or gonorrhea
[26:10.320 --> 26:14.920]  from this syphilis you're probably not going to get hiv but it just shows they don't care
[26:14.920 --> 26:19.280]  about you see you got to take your shoes off and walk through where thousands of other
[26:19.280 --> 26:24.680]  people have walked through i've seen people walking through leaving wet spots with their
[26:24.680 --> 26:32.280]  infested sweaty you know feet and and the few times i've gotten athlete's foot it's
[26:32.280 --> 26:38.400]  after walking through lax or something on that they're not worried about your sanitation
[26:38.400 --> 26:44.480]  they're not worried about your health and now oh i just searched 50 people and they
[26:44.480 --> 26:50.240]  stick their hand in your pants oh last week we were just squeezing through your pants
[26:50.240 --> 26:55.280]  to make sure it's not a bomb they put pressure on it let me see now the hand's got to go
[26:55.280 --> 27:00.840]  in the pants and they put it in your the crack in your gluteus maximus let me check
[27:00.840 --> 27:06.920]  that a little bit they believe me if people don't say no now they're going to have one
[27:06.920 --> 27:11.440]  of their drugged up patsies that the state department helps get on the plane like the
[27:11.440 --> 27:17.440]  underwear bomber on christmas day that's confirmed on record and they're going to put a hanger
[27:17.440 --> 27:23.480]  grenade up there and it's over they're going to say sorry proctology exams or chest x-rays
[27:23.480 --> 27:29.440]  you think i'm joking no i'm not joking the sky is the limit with these people it's a
[27:29.440 --> 27:34.280]  total act of domination and see that's why it's so important people are angry because
[27:34.280 --> 27:38.080]  if we have victory on this we're going to have victory on every other issue now make
[27:38.080 --> 27:43.640]  no mistake i'll guarantee you homeland security and these defense contractors that make all
[27:43.640 --> 27:49.560]  this money off this they're in yemen right now loading up a fake bomb and a printer cartridge
[27:49.560 --> 27:54.200]  and of the british like last time tested to say it's not a bomb obama will just go out
[27:54.200 --> 27:59.640]  on tv and say yes it was a bomb get it straightening when we'll go back and go okay mr president
[27:59.640 --> 28:05.120]  we tested a second time it does have explosive material and then he can sit up there in grandstand
[28:05.120 --> 28:09.720]  as our daddy like george bush did or like hitler did after he blew up his own right
[28:09.720 --> 28:15.040]  stack and if you don't know why governments do this read operation north woods or operation
[28:15.040 --> 28:20.680]  gladio or operation age acts or the army field manual that wiki leaks put out a few years
[28:20.680 --> 28:25.640]  ago where the army teaches their black cop captains and above how to stage terror attacks
[28:25.640 --> 28:30.440]  how to carry out false flags you know you're having trouble in a village you want to get
[28:30.440 --> 28:35.000]  the village on your side well you just get one of the kids and hang them and then put
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  enemy paraphernalia there and the village be on your side you know and look you're going
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.520]  to save a lot more kids by killing a couple come on do you want all the kids to die or
[28:44.520 --> 28:50.840]  do you want to just kill a few see this is how the end justifies the means and this is
[28:50.840 --> 28:57.680]  how of course the army field manual just vaguely says how to carry out false flag operations
[28:57.680 --> 29:01.120]  but then we've interviewed the special forces officers and others and we know the little
[29:01.120 --> 29:05.400]  tricks they do in fact the former italian president who was also the head of intelligence
[29:05.400 --> 29:10.520]  at the time in nineteen eighty at the bologna bombing he went public and he said us special
[29:10.520 --> 29:16.360]  forces commanding subcontractors staged hundreds of attacks including the bologna bombing that
[29:16.360 --> 29:23.040]  killed i think it's seventy pull up the bologna bombing deaths because i don't want to get
[29:23.040 --> 29:27.840]  this wrong i forget the number of deaths i want to say seventy nine or something but
[29:27.840 --> 29:32.080]  we'll see if i'm right i'm going from memory i'm under the weather so my memory isn't operating
[29:32.080 --> 29:39.800]  in full full capacity full full skill but full power i guess they'd say but they said that
[29:39.800 --> 29:45.040]  our government's favorite is blowing up school buses oh that works so good blow a school bus
[29:45.040 --> 29:49.480]  up all those dead kids you can really demonize your enemy that way we'll be right back stay

[37:06.160 --> 37:10.320]  actually matters but there's new developments every day so i guess that does qualify it
[37:10.320 --> 37:15.720]  as a as a soap opera kind of like space opera or something science fiction tyranny opera
[37:15.720 --> 37:20.000]  but we're now living through it i want to get into the nightmare bill that we thought

[37:24.720 --> 37:28.480]  was making breakfast at six thirty in the morning and they were announcing with extreme
[37:28.480 --> 37:34.320]  pleasure it has a very good chance of passing because they're liberal and they want to protect
[37:34.320 --> 37:40.200]  us from the evil food that's why the gmo is all being approved when it's been proven
[37:40.200 --> 37:44.600]  in every major study to be causing organ failure you name it that's why they're not worried
[37:44.600 --> 37:54.760]  about them mining the phosphate derivatives the plutonium and radium isotopes and putting
[37:54.760 --> 37:59.000]  it in our water they're all over the news going oh the government covered up you uranium
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.240]  in the water for decades and other isotopes oh but there's no discussion of why is it
[38:04.240 --> 38:09.760]  in the water because they're dumping it in the stinking water as you tell the average
[38:09.760 --> 38:15.240]  yuppie that they're so cowardly they engage in orwellian crime stop you know crime stop
[38:15.240 --> 38:20.240]  orwell explains it isn't stupid people you know the proletariat they only care about
[38:20.240 --> 38:25.600]  lotteries and acting cool you know if we're ever going to save society it lies in the
[38:25.600 --> 38:31.280]  proles i tend to agree with orwell eric blair but but the inner party and outer party members
[38:31.280 --> 38:35.560]  the smarter the more they deny everything doesn't matter a big brother says they're always at
[38:35.560 --> 38:41.280]  war with east asia it doesn't matter if the next day they say we've never been at war
[38:41.280 --> 38:47.600]  with east asia and then back at war the next day they take pleasure and and an energetic
[38:47.600 --> 38:57.080]  enjoyment in not being able to see real issues they love it and so you you you try to explain
[38:57.080 --> 39:03.720]  to them we told you years ago that there's different radioactive isotopes in the water
[39:03.720 --> 39:09.000]  and it's not natural they take the toxic waste from phosphate mining and that's what they
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.840]  call fluoride but there's hundreds of chemicals they add and they just go the space alien gonna
[39:13.840 --> 39:19.720]  get me a little paranoid there pal i'm like no no here's all the documents did you get
[39:19.720 --> 39:25.800]  them from a little green man kind of like jesse ventura last week oh well i think it's the
[39:25.800 --> 39:29.880]  most important show he's ever done by the way he scheduled friday but the network setting
[39:29.880 --> 39:34.840]  it up so i can just call him up at home and get him on right away but time warner scheduling
[39:34.840 --> 39:38.880]  him on the show so we'll uh we'll see if that happens but to talk about this groundbreaking
[39:38.880 --> 39:46.840]  jfk episode that by the way we got him in contact with e howard hunts son rolling stone
[39:46.840 --> 39:51.520]  first did the report about oh deathbed confession and went with the letter of course rolling
[39:51.520 --> 39:56.840]  stone had also been given the audio and offered the video of e howard hunt i guess that was
[39:56.840 --> 40:03.680]  too convincing admitting how he ran the operation to kill kennedy but uh we then broke the audio
[40:03.680 --> 40:08.880]  and video here uh months after that uh but but that's going to be on national tv for
[40:08.880 --> 40:19.080]  the first time ever uh coming up amongst other breaking news um this friday nine o'clock
[40:19.080 --> 40:25.360]  central and the hour leading into it will be the rearing of the fema camps police state
[40:25.360 --> 40:30.600]  special that'll air eight central uh before the new episode and i don't think even the
[40:30.600 --> 40:38.520]  jfk can top it i will tell you that but oh how do i get off into ventura we played this
[40:38.520 --> 40:43.440]  clip a few days ago it's up on info wars dot com if you want to see it um they go into
[40:43.440 --> 40:50.280]  this congressman and they go okay we have this bill and and hr 645 and uh the bill
[40:50.280 --> 40:53.880]  deals in fact that's in my stack we guys pull that from the stack from two days ago i want
[40:53.880 --> 41:01.360]  to show it to people uh the uh emergency centers establishment act and the guy just says uh
[41:01.360 --> 41:07.440]  i did a space monster come out of a big machine uh green men and he says well no this you
[41:07.440 --> 41:11.760]  know this and then we have the police doing urban warfare training we have the military
[41:11.760 --> 41:18.120]  on video training to put americans in camps i mean this is all on record i mean they're
[41:18.120 --> 41:24.920]  admitting their trend and the guy just a little green man that's their response so it's like
[41:24.920 --> 41:29.400]  uh you know most of your water supplies if they add so-called fluoride they're putting
[41:29.400 --> 41:38.360]  radium and plutonium and uranium but generally just uranium and uh and radium and they just
[41:38.360 --> 41:42.480]  they will not listen a little green man gonna get me okay i'm gonna stop pontificating uh
[41:42.480 --> 41:49.480]  here and uh go to your phone calls but but but that's where my frustration comes from
[41:49.480 --> 41:56.280]  is america has gotten disconnected from reality mainly from the age of six months in our crap
[41:56.280 --> 42:05.560]  filled diapers being set in front of the television set and being educated by toucan sam uh you
[42:05.560 --> 42:13.200]  know telling us about fruit loops and yogi bear and all this other stuff and so kids
[42:13.200 --> 42:17.280]  don't know what reality is they don't know what it's not people see millions of simulated
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.840]  murders and acts of violence so people now laugh at violence people now i see the reports
[42:22.840 --> 42:26.720]  all the time we'll see someone run over and cut in half and they laugh just like if you
[42:26.720 --> 42:33.240]  go to a horror movie and a child's being murdered people laugh you know old timers you know my
[42:33.240 --> 42:38.160]  grandfathers if they saw in a western somebody gets shot and blood come out of their mouth
[42:38.160 --> 42:41.960]  they didn't get upset because they were wimps they got upset because they'd seen that in
[42:41.960 --> 42:46.880]  world war two they got upset because growing up if they saw blood pouring out of somebody's
[42:46.880 --> 42:52.120]  mouth it was real and they had humanity and i guarantee you one of those men could beat
[42:52.120 --> 42:56.920]  up the average tough you know tough guy yuppie today who thinks he's tough and could sit there
[42:56.920 --> 43:02.480]  and you know watch violence all day and laugh at it we've got feelings of empathy when we
[43:02.480 --> 43:07.120]  see a child being hurt or we see somebody run over in the street because we understand
[43:07.120 --> 43:11.760]  that could be happening to us we have a tribal bond with our fellow humans but the system
[43:11.760 --> 43:20.360]  tries to disconnect that they try to disconnect that family connection that human connection
[43:20.360 --> 43:25.440]  that tribal connection so we're all isolated and so we're all alone and can be picked off
[43:25.440 --> 43:33.720]  by the scientific corporate board we're being domesticated and trained you think a farmer
[43:33.720 --> 43:38.320]  wants to breed a chicken that'll attack you and is vicious you think a farmer wants to
[43:38.320 --> 43:42.500]  breed a cow that's vicious and will attack you no they breed that out well we're being
[43:42.500 --> 43:49.160]  socially engineered and having that bread out or we're given fictitious ceremonial
[43:49.160 --> 43:59.400]  vestigial unworking prosthetic sports to put our manhood into in our tribalism you
[43:59.400 --> 44:03.640]  know you get all angry and jump up and down about your team winning or losing and paint
[44:03.640 --> 44:07.920]  yourself up in your team's colors and act like a clown that's manly that's healthy that's
[44:07.920 --> 44:14.360]  good but you raise your voice about government corruption you get upset about tyranny man
[44:14.360 --> 44:21.320]  that's weird that's sick this fruit cake gets on the air and reads that we're drinking uranium
[44:21.320 --> 44:26.600]  it is so bad that he gets upset about that is sick oh but look at that young man painted
[44:26.600 --> 44:36.920]  up blue with his belly hanging out acting like a fool that is so healthy by the way
[44:36.920 --> 44:44.440]  it was 85 killed at the bologna bombing by our loving US government okay let's go ahead
[44:44.440 --> 44:49.720]  and talk to Justin in Kansas Justin you're on the air hey Alex how's it going I'm good
[44:49.720 --> 44:54.280]  sir what's on your mind today a couple things I'd like to talk to you about quickly I'm
[44:54.280 --> 44:58.040]  from Manhattan Kansas where they're building the bioscenter the national bioscenter the
[44:58.040 --> 45:03.280]  one that's replacing Plum Island level four yeah well we've already got one here which
[45:03.280 --> 45:07.440]  made me really curious as to why they're getting another one here the one we have here is a
[45:07.440 --> 45:10.400]  level three already and apparently they're wanting to build something even bigger yeah
[45:10.400 --> 45:13.880]  they're going to level four but they're going to put in a level two containment facility
[45:13.880 --> 45:18.880]  which is completely illegal of course they got a level four down in south Texas on the
[45:18.880 --> 45:24.120]  coast at Galveston that's in a level two facility where the hurricanes come in of course they
[45:24.120 --> 45:27.800]  want to be able to make that excuse I actually have an article about the government admitting
[45:27.800 --> 45:34.920]  that there's a 70% chance that zoological bioweapons could get released from Plum Island but they're
[45:34.920 --> 45:38.600]  not worried about that just getting ready to read you that article it's here in the
[45:38.600 --> 45:43.840]  Manhattan murky our local paper oh tell me about it the headline here is report won't
[45:43.840 --> 45:48.560]  hurt funding labs still have strong support in congress the headline grabbing nature of
[45:48.560 --> 45:52.360]  monday's national research committee report estimating the prospect of foot and mouth
[45:52.360 --> 45:56.880]  disease released from a facility built in Manhattan that 70% will not necessarily impact
[45:56.880 --> 46:03.440]  funding for the facility sources say that's wonderful it is wonderful it is wonderful
[46:03.440 --> 46:08.840]  please continue with the article it goes on to say that that yeah that basically that
[46:08.840 --> 46:13.480]  the no matter what happens here the funding isn't going to be stopped here and they're
[46:13.480 --> 46:16.960]  building the facility no matter what so people just better get used to it yeah we're going
[46:16.960 --> 46:21.640]  to grab your wife's privates and your private so we're going to build 36 level four bioweapons
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.320]  labs and stick them right in the middle of cities and oh we're going to mail out weaponized
[46:26.320 --> 46:31.640]  flu and 50,000 shipments and have a FedEx truck crash with it and we're going to have Baxter
[46:31.640 --> 46:36.520]  pharmaceutical mixed weaponized bird flu with the vaccines thank god somebody caught it
[46:36.520 --> 46:41.240]  before it caused devastation that's not the threat though GMO corn directly linked in
[46:41.240 --> 46:46.880]  german studies to killing the honeybees that's not a problem no no none of that's a problem
[46:46.880 --> 46:51.200]  releasing genetically engineered salmon that major university studies show will extinct
[46:51.200 --> 46:58.040]  natural sea salmon within 40 generations it's a chimera salmon uh cross species that's not
[46:58.040 --> 47:03.000]  a problem no the problem is some men in turbines are going to get us and they've created this
[47:03.000 --> 47:10.080]  psychological uh trigger where you show somebody a photo of a man in a turbine and they just
[47:10.080 --> 47:15.600]  fall down give you their bank account spread their legs and just start begging the government
[47:15.600 --> 47:20.160]  it's and even if you don't want to believe that am or all oki CIA even though he's hanging
[47:20.160 --> 47:24.360]  out the pentagon and protected and all the attackers are protected in a run by all oki
[47:24.360 --> 47:29.480]  on record even if you believe all of the official garbage and don't know it's also government
[47:29.480 --> 47:36.680]  run in the middle items admitted CIA tem osmond codename the point is 36 level 4 bio weapons
[47:36.680 --> 47:42.160]  labs being built in major cities and towns all over the country and the government admitting
[47:42.160 --> 47:45.640]  there's a good chance the bio weapons are going to get out and then you find out the
[47:45.640 --> 47:50.360]  government's history of secret chemical and biological testing on the american people
[47:50.360 --> 47:54.120]  you understand what they're doing and yes they don't care whether we like it or not
[47:54.120 --> 48:00.120]  they are training us they're trying to break our will where they get to engage in any absurdity
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.600]  if they want i appreciate your call justin here's the article uh this is out of the
[48:04.600 --> 48:08.760]  global security news wire he was mentioning another news article locally in his paper
[48:08.760 --> 48:15.680]  dhs says 70% chance diseases would escape from mainland plum island bio defense lab
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.160]  well what's wrong with that you know what a level 4 is it's taking something like small
[48:20.160 --> 48:26.640]  pox abola and and aerosolizing into making an airborne oh but what is dr eric piyanka
[48:26.640 --> 48:32.960]  who's helped graduate so many uh biologists who've sent me threatening emails and i pull
[48:32.960 --> 48:38.520]  up their names and they're working in bio weapons labs dr piyanka is a genius and unlike
[48:38.520 --> 48:43.320]  him a liberal who only wants 90% dead we look forward to the day when the human parasite
[48:43.320 --> 48:49.600]  is removed signed and you look the woman up and she's in bio weapons and she's smiling
[48:49.600 --> 48:50.840]  i got the power
[48:50.840 --> 49:06.640]  airborne abola 12 monkeys coming your way enjoy it yuppies they can't wait they've got
[49:06.640 --> 49:12.200]  the underground bases and the biggest power trip of all you didn't have it mistresses
[49:12.200 --> 49:17.760]  didn't start in wars didn't use in drugs didn't get in a way with crime it's killing lots
[49:17.760 --> 49:23.840]  of people and playing god and they've got a lot of eugenics fake liberals who just can't
[49:23.840 --> 49:28.800]  wait they hate their fellow man and they want you and your family dead and they can you
[49:28.800 --> 49:34.840]  drink uranium and sodium fluoride and run in disdainful tv ads and telling you mercury
[49:34.840 --> 49:39.200]  is good for your children because they think you're such idiots mercury is good for you
[49:39.200 --> 49:44.880]  honey should i play that for the 300th time here today we have a news reporter here they
[49:44.880 --> 49:49.000]  probably don't believe me that i have multiple newscasts saying lead and mercury is good
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.680]  for children and again i'm the kook i i think mercury is bad because i've seen mercury
[49:53.680 --> 49:58.200]  under electron microscopes and mammal brains it's the most deadly heavy metal in the brain
[49:58.200 --> 50:01.840]  because it causes an electrochemical short circuit it doesn't just kill the cells that
[50:01.840 --> 50:10.040]  comes in contact with it causes a chain reaction in the electrochemical membranes of the salt
[50:10.040 --> 50:18.160]  water cholesterol based conduits of the neuron substructures now dhs 70 chance disease would
[50:18.160 --> 50:24.120]  escape from mainland plum island bio defense oh my gosh if there's a 70 chance it's going
[50:24.120 --> 50:31.240]  to escape from one outfit why not build 36 i mean this is wonderful don't be paranoid
[50:31.240 --> 50:37.000]  i mean there's no problem with this an expert panel yesterday said the u.s. homeland security
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.200]  department has not adequately gauged the potential risks associated with proposed multi-million
[50:41.200 --> 50:46.840]  dollar infectious disease research laboratory in kansas there are several major shortcomings
[50:46.840 --> 50:52.560]  in the department risk assessment of its planned national bio agro defense facility yeah agro
[50:52.560 --> 50:56.000]  defense that's learning how to kill everybody's crops and like the c.i.a. has been caught

[54:22.520 --> 54:27.480]  pediatrics there have been widespread concerns that mercury based preservatives and vaccines
[54:27.480 --> 54:32.080]  might impair the neurological development of children these new studies suggest that
[54:32.080 --> 54:36.880]  the opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental

[54:52.120 --> 55:03.720]  get us and grab people's genitals it is completely normal to tell people on the news that mercury
[55:03.720 --> 55:09.240]  is good for their children's brains see they're just testing to see what they can get away
[55:09.240 --> 55:14.760]  with and I have other clips where they say listen there's nothing wrong with lead from
[55:14.760 --> 55:20.920]  china and toys it's good for children and they go yeah and the public just kind of goes
[55:20.920 --> 55:26.320]  okay it's normal for potential to steal the death benefits of six million dead and dying
[55:26.320 --> 55:30.720]  vets and assign a secret deal to do it yeah that's patriotism and if you're not for stealing
[55:30.720 --> 55:37.560]  the vets money you're without kind of what you don't like the fellow reserve being private
[55:37.560 --> 55:42.680]  and running everything and not telling people where the money went you don't want them establishing
[55:42.680 --> 55:50.200]  a world government you pay carbon taxes to well you must you must be an evil right winger
[55:50.200 --> 55:55.240]  this is the insanity of these people so hey what's wrong with a semi uranium in your tap
[55:55.240 --> 56:01.160]  water everybody knows uranium fortifies bones and teeth or so it actually gives you cancer
[56:01.160 --> 56:07.440]  and state of texas and other states they're not just covering up that it's there they
[56:07.440 --> 56:11.880]  put it there of course they've been covering it up why won't the media go the rest of the
[56:11.880 --> 56:18.120]  way because they can't fathom the pure evil they're not just covering it up they're doing
[56:18.120 --> 56:25.280]  it because they like it horrible ignorant wicked control freaks only know how to hurt
[56:25.280 --> 56:30.760]  people they like it they're the kid in school who likes to pull the chair out from under
[56:30.760 --> 56:36.120]  somebody when they're about to sit down they're the people that see someone doing well and
[56:36.120 --> 56:43.520]  gets angry by it and good people are blind to this so it's time to stop being blind it's
[56:43.520 --> 56:47.600]  time to grow up crystal in Tennessee that I'm going to hurry through calls then Wilson Matt
[56:47.600 --> 56:52.640]  Chris Bob and others crystal you're on the air worldwide welcome how are you I'm good
[56:52.640 --> 57:02.760]  welcome I have a question concerning the airport have you heard of the vaccine nanotechnology
[57:02.760 --> 57:08.520]  well I know that they're coming out with pills pharmaceuticals that have RFID in them to track
[57:08.520 --> 57:15.800]  it through your gastrointestinal tract I know that I know that they have developed nanotech
[57:15.800 --> 57:19.760]  tracking and that there's a lot of evidence that they are putting it in vaccines but not
[57:19.760 --> 57:25.480]  specifically with the airports well actually there's an article on natural news about Bill
[57:25.480 --> 57:31.000]  Gates funding nanotechnology oh no I know Bill Gates is funding nanotechnology for vaccines
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.000]  but but but I mean you you brought up airports right and they're saying they're going to
[57:35.000 --> 57:40.800]  spray it in airports so it goes through you so many don't even know well I did know that
[57:40.800 --> 57:46.320]  Bill and natural news is very credible publication I know of the 28 things he just funded it's
[57:46.320 --> 57:53.360]  mosquitoes that forcibly inoculate you it's all for your own good and it's you in programs
[57:53.360 --> 57:57.600]  but he is of course part of Planned Parenthood and his daddy is and he does say there's too
[57:57.600 --> 58:02.160]  many of us we've got to cut the carbon footprint by cutting people but I knew he talked about
[58:02.160 --> 58:07.400]  releasing vaccines forcibly in the air whether you like it or not because you know fluoride
[58:07.400 --> 58:10.400]  and uranium in the water whether you like it or not it's for your own good it's for
[58:10.400 --> 58:16.080]  your teeth but what's the headline on that I didn't know he said in airports I guess
[58:16.080 --> 58:20.840]  airports why not you know you know I'm gonna stay at home mom in a home school and I don't

[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.800]  can't stop the signal as long as the signal is transmitting the truth but he was telling
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:38.040]  me a chelcescu story i actually heard about his bowling alley but that and the reporter
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:44.120]  spent a lot of time over there in romania that when chelcescu would flip on his underground

[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:44.120]  few nights out of the year and they even monitor this with doctors to have sex and produce
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:53.160]  a child and once they've done that they send the woman to another camp the man to another
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:58.440]  camp and the child to another camp destroying the family what did 1984 talk about taking

[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:43.600]  are living in slave pits and that is the globalist model that's what they like because that's
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:49.160]  what they enjoy always pressing on the nerve of power being trampled on trampling and being
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:56.920]  trampled upon that's their religion it's their enjoyment the collectivist aren't some little

[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:29.120]  to talk to you wilson all right i just want to ask you two quick questions the first one
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:36.520]  is what's your view on am rand you know i i'm gonna be quite frank i could never get
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:43.760]  through her books and i i can read the encyclopedia and be entertained for an entire weekend literally
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:50.080]  i love the encyclopedia i just can't read it and i don't mean to turn off fans of that
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:59.960]  i'm just not a big fiction person a and i'm not really an atheist either i mean i think
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:06.680]  it has some good ideas but it really hasn't shaped much of what i believe or what i stand
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.360]  for now her idea of the individual being with the real powers that i totally agree and resonate
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:20.520]  with that i'm more of a thomas jefferson type guy or a victor hugo or a george washington
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:27.960]  i mean that's more of the philosophy that i hold with what's your view on her i was
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:34.640]  just intrigued by how well spoken she is and how intellectually wise she is but i don't
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:40.280]  agree with everything she said i just think she's good to at least learn from or at least
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:46.320]  look at you know she shaped some of my views a little bit and my final question was always
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.400]  growing up i always thought nelson mandela was good like learning at school and then
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.240]  i see he's been doing speeches at the united nations since the nineties so i just wanted
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.880]  to ask you why was he doing these speeches at the united nations if i was supposedly
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:04.120]  told he was good and also say gireva he i've seen him do a couple speeches there and people
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.880]  think he's good so i just want to know why these people you know alright let me break
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:16.520]  that down very complex questions very complex issue nelson mandela was in prison for decades
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:24.680]  in in in solitary confinement and that will change you and the revolution that he'd been
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:30.880]  involved in when they locked him up in prison that revolution became successful while he
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:38.680]  was in prison and so they brought him out as a figurehead to kind of lead that transition
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:46.560]  from the clerk and others but the very same financial interest that ran that country before
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:54.760]  run it now they've just removed some of the middle class africaners you know the dutch
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:14:01.280]  and the british the middle class people they're having their minds taken they're having their
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:08.240]  farms taken and and certainly there were abusive things that went on in that system but but
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:16.600]  it's removed that patronage where sure it was an unfair class system but a lot of those
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.800]  black folks had better standards of living than they do now because there isn't a middle
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:26.520]  class so in the name of revolution they brought in a communist socialist movement but the
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:32.000]  big mega companies for diamonds and gold they're still there they've just cut out the middle
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:42.240]  men they've just cut out the people that originally colonized it and another way to
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:48.760]  look at it is westerners came over here made deals with natives fought with each other
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:53.360]  on all different sides I mean routinely the natives would come to the westerners whether
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:15:00.520]  it was the spanish the french the the dutch the british and say help us wipe out this
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:06.680]  other tribe I mean the indians were always killing each other too but just to finish
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:13.840]  up the question after the settlers are done and this even happened with the robber barons
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:18.880]  and the railroads after the settlers are done killing the indians to take the land then the
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.080]  railroads would roll in behind them with pinkerton men with guns and they'd say now you're gonna
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:31.680]  give us your property or you're gonna die see in the in the in the 1880s 90s 1900 1910 1920
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.960]  the Rockefellers would sing would send pinkerton men out to whole towns and they just ride it
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.680]  and burn it down and just shoot everybody in the back while they're running their famous
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:47.920]  massacres in colorado you name it so that's all that's happened in south africa is they
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:57.960]  just gave them black puppets instead of white puppets and it's just a terrible thing but
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:04.760]  no one will deny us how that was even worse off than it was the white middle class that
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:10.200]  was there should have made a real deal with the actual african people and tried to bring
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.280]  real freedom there but they didn't do that the upper middle classes made deals with the
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:21.720]  elite and of course got cheated and then you were also asked me about shea guvara the fact
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:27.880]  that shea guvara got killed tells you that he was legitimate that doesn't mean i think
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.640]  he was a good guy he was a murderer he did a lot of cold blood and killing in the name
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:37.240]  of the greater good kind of like our special forces will torture or murder or false flag
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:42.360]  because if they don't well the commies do it well the nazis do it well the nazis are
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:47.400]  dealing drugs out of cyprus and if we don't deal drugs out of cyprus when we take cyprus
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:55.480]  over they're gonna rebel oh we better help the taliban grow opium or somebody else will
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:17:01.280]  see this is how you give in to evil but the fact that they killed shea guvara once they
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:07.960]  got a hold of him shows that that he was certainly outside of their control system just because
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:12.640]  somebody speaks at the united nations though does not mean they're bad i mean if they invited
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:17.720]  me to speak at the un i'd go do it i've actually been invited to speak at smaller conferences
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:28.200]  they invite everybody to try of any influence to try to co-opt you so of course the general
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:34.040]  assembly of the un is nothing but a debating society it's not totally useless because
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:43.880]  you can at least get issues out it's the it's the it's the heart of the un the security
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:49.360]  council that has all the real power and has the veto power i mean who created the un
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:55.120]  you gotta love glen back talking about the un wants to get us the liberal commies and
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:03.720]  some little tides foundation oh my gosh they're the master puppets of it all and then meanwhile
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:13.480]  the pentagon created the department of defense created in nineteen forty five at the prosidio
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:19.280]  the united nations the rockefellers gave them the land in new york the rand corporation
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:28.400]  has written about how it's meant to create a world government basically the general assembly
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.120]  if you've ever been to a cattle auction a stockyards auction the old fashioned ones
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:37.120]  they've kind of phased that out now we're big agribusiness just sets the price but back
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:44.520]  even ten years ago we still had you know real real auctions that's what the un is it's
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:49.960]  a big auction you got the imf the world bank and you got the payoff men there and it gets
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:54.600]  all the world leaders there and they're like we got drugs we got hookers we got money we
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:19:00.480]  got payoffs we got deals look we'll help you put a dictatorship in or we'll help get your
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:05.200]  party in play ball with us get your country deep in debt and you're going to get a villa
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:10.760]  in switzerland and the asian the african the latin american the eastern european leaders
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:17.640]  they say absolutely sounds like a good deal and then the un says one more little catch
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:24.200]  we want you to make sure you vaccinate everybody we've got some special shots and it comes out
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:29.280]  oh there was some hiv in that oh there was some polio oh there was some syphilis it's
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:36.840]  always an accident even though the un stated goal is forced population reduction so that's
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:41.960]  what the un is it's a giant whorehouse set up by our criminal government which is really
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:49.680]  a model of the british empire the same model of management matt chris bob know your calls

[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:25.280]  around and told what to do the number one threat in human history is always governments
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.800]  and the power hungry scum that get control of them and want to use us like where their
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:37.360]  little toys as Bob Dylan said you play with my life like it's your little toy I'm sick
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:44.520]  of it it's like the black Sabbath song see the generals gathered in their masses just
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:53.440]  like witches at black masses evil minds at blood destruction sorcerers of death's construction
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:59.440]  I mean that's what it is the worst people get into these positions as many philosophers
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:05.880]  and historians have noted because they want the power and once they get it they start
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:12.880]  competing with each other and it's a survival of the fittest or survival of the most psychopathic
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:18.800]  that then gravitates towards the ultimate paramount positions and we get a Nazi Germany
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:26.040]  we get a malice china and that's where we're going guaranteed history is a hundred percent
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:31.120]  humans don't change we do the same things over and over again we've got to get off this
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:39.160]  train now and we've got to get angry and focused and dig our heels in and say no I know you're
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:44.800]  a bunch of terrorist criminals I know the Federal Reserve are a bunch of thieves it's over I
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.720]  don't care what you say about me I don't care what you make up I don't care what you do
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:53.720]  I know I'm right that's the end of it and then there's nothing they can do already they're
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:57.920]  not as arrogant as they used to be you can tell the establishment starting to get scared
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:02.680]  which is dangerous I'd rather be full of hubris no now they're starting to realize they're
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:06.920]  not invincible that makes them more dangerous let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Florida
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:12.160]  Matt you're on the air welcome how's it going awesome I'd like to add to that the only person
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:18.880]  that masters over my mind is God but you mentioned Glenn Beck a second ago I wanted
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:24.160]  to say I like to think of him as domestic policy and you as foreign policy in the sinful
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:30.760]  war is I don't know it's just a way of looking at it but I wanted to bring your attention
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:36.880]  we are changed Tampa confronted George Bush at his little book tour thing pretty good
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:42.240]  video to look up George Bush confronted on 9 11 truth and war crimes and in Florida you
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:48.560]  can find that on YouTube also give a call to action all the info warriors and we are
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.440]  truth people you know get out in the airport and hand out literature and let people know
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:58.720]  airports are awesome places to you know start brush fires and small people and have them
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.320]  spread to all the corners of the world because wherever they're going they'll take that information
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.960]  well that's what's so important about this TSA rebellion is it shows people they have
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:12.400]  power look at the effect we're having a real issue for weeks is now the number one news
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:18.720]  item not the regular baloney that they force feed us that they vomit on us that they regurgitate
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:24.720]  like parents on to us but going back to this George Bush thing I know I recognize your
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:27.960]  voice from calling a few months ago you're the guys that have confronted Al Gore and
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:32.880]  many others and I love the fact that we are changed confronts the entire spectrum of these
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:39.960]  scallywags what did Bush who's trying to read a rehabilitate himself now that he thinks
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:47.920]  Obama so unpopular Cheney openly said that that opening of the Bush library that that
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:53.760]  people know how good Bush is now because they've seen Obama I mean give me a break it's a total
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:59.760]  continuity of agenda the wars the torture the banker bailouts the Patriot Act again
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:04.640]  it's just different rhetoric on the surface but at the meat and potatoes level it's the
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:10.440]  exact same thing and here's Dick Cheney who I've always called Darth Vader now literally
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:15.800]  Darth Vader he has an artificial heart on the outside of him guys pull up Dick Cheney
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:20.720]  has no pulse from gizmodo or maybe it was wired and it actually shows this heart pump
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.960]  is a big artificial heart attached to the bottom he doesn't even have a pulse it's just
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:34.480]  blood flowing continually you've got a ringwraith Nazgul undead so full of evil you know they've
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:37.880]  tried these on other people and they usually die very quickly because they get depressed
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.920]  over not having a pulse the body freaks out you don't have a pulse when you're asleep
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:46.080]  at night but they say Dick Cheney is doing great with it because he's such a hateful
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:53.240]  demon bionic Dick Cheney technically has no pulse scroll down and show this this artificial
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:29:00.600]  heart he's got okay then that's not the article that has it show the gizmodo one then I want
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.600]  to show people this artificial heart he's got I'm sorry go ahead sir what else tell
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:08.520]  us about the George Bush what happened oh well I wasn't there but I'm a member of the
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:13.960]  group but the video shows that you know we just started yelling out 911 inside job and
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:20.480]  he was a war criminal they were they were escorted by police officers who when told that their
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:25.880]  job was to uphold the Constitution they replied that no that was not their job which is you
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:31.560]  know kind of ironic yeah they swear an oath to it yeah they were met with special forces
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:37.720]  or special agents who obviously wanted to know who they were it's funny that they were interested
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:43.440]  in you and they were like yeah I'll bet you guys are I'd say we're interested in you we're
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:50.920]  interested in how the Secret Service helped kill Kennedy that day good job my friend we're

[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:03.080]  back to your phone calls well since we mentioned it for prison planet TV viewers and radio listeners
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:07.000]  you can just type in Dick Cheney has no pulse and look at it but let's put that graphic
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:13.960]  back up of the heart pump I was gonna do heart pump first and then the video there's the
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:19.880]  heart pump Dick Cheney has no pulse literally once you have this they found that artificial
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:25.920]  hearts don't work as well as you're still using the old heart kind of as the bag and
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:30.400]  then they have a high powered pump you got a battery on the outside like a cyborg and
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:36.760]  a pump that's mounted down in your guts with plugs coming out of your side I mean literally
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:42.640]  Darth Vader Dick Cheney is a full bore cyborg you know they got these scientists that will
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:47.360]  attach a microchip to their finger put one in their brain that's not a cyborg when you
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:56.560]  are literally living because core parts of your body are are are electro powered by machines
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:01.560]  and you've got a pump in your heart you're a cyborg I mean this is 21st century we've
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:07.920]  got a crazy vice president hobbling around talking about how wonderful George W. Bush
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:14.600]  is and how real he is when he's well known for disdaining his employees disdaining people
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:19.760]  around him as minions on countless TV shows he'll lean over when somebody in looking and
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:25.000]  clean his glasses on their shirt or on on on Bill Clinton's coat cleaning his glasses
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:35.360]  in Haiti he has nicknames for everyone that they're human feces I mean he's a monster
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:40.640]  who says you bet I ordered torture meanwhile the people that got caught following his orders
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:50.160]  are in prison I mean this guy is he's horrible and meanwhile Dick Cheney saying how great
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:59.160]  he is a a corpse a undead zombie we have a former vice president we are in 2010 we now
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:05.920]  have undead zombies and giving speeches on television I mean look at Cheney his latest
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:11.840]  speech I watched it he looks like an undead zombie he is an undead zombie they admit
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.600]  everywhere Cheney goes they have at least two ambulances and two heart surgeons and
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:25.520]  experts driving around behind him that's the elite in this country you talk about Chelchescu
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.840]  having a palace that took so much power that when he flipped the lights on at night half
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:35.640]  of the capital city would lose power what about Cheney he he's some cases he has four
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:41.320]  ambulances following him around he's got a robot heart I mean this is all crazy we're
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:47.800]  living in La La land here and the globalists are destroying their own nest with all these
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:53.040]  open air cross species genetically engineered I remember 10 years ago talking about how
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:58.680]  they're engineering mice with human brains how they're engineering goats that create
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.520]  body armor I actually covered that 15 years ago in their udders how they're creating all
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.480]  these crops that have insect genes it's now jumping into other crops it's causing unbelievable
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:15.240]  devastation when you eat these foods it then triggers allergies to normal things we're killing
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:21.880]  ourselves the elites are killing themselves what type of elite uses depleted uranium
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:30.960]  in every continent of the planet and uses them in four different wars I mean what type
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:36.480]  of group does this when it encircles the globe in the atmosphere and we're breathing it when
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:43.040]  they know in their own reports it kills anybody that ingested it may take 10 years to do it
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:50.480]  but it's going to kill you these people are psychopaths all right I'm going to shut up
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:55.440]  and go to your calls oh the last point was here's a we are change and I guess federal
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:01.600]  jack I'm not quite sure who they just found the clip great folks down in Florida confronting
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:08.040]  bush at a public rally and the police throw them out and then even after they're leaving
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:10.640]  they say you want to go to jail you want to go to jail we're not going to play the whole
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:17.640]  clip you can watch it online but here it is we'll come to feel more like Pearl Harbor
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:24.640]  day and on her date on the calendar at an important moments in history but not a scar
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:41.200]  on the heart not a reason to fight on not a long not a long I got you all on camera I
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:51.200]  I've got you all on camera. I hope you know that. You're a criminal! We're a criminal!
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:59.200]  We know you was going. I have a camera on you, sir. Don't twist my arm, sir. I'm not
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:03.200]  resisting you. How am I resisting you? I'm just standing here and you're twisting my arm.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:09.200]  That's America. You asked our warden savior, according to some neocons, George W. Bush,
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:15.200]  a question. You know, I still roll over at 3 a.m. and have shooting pain in my right shoulder
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:20.200]  because for about 3 or 4 minutes they twisted my arm up and put my fist way into the middle
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:25.200]  of my back and tore my rotator cuff. I've been told I need surgery on it, but I don't
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:31.200]  like surgery because the one time they did surgery on my leg when I broke it, it took
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:36.200]  9 times the stuff to keep me under. I kept waking up during the surgery. It's probably
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:40.200]  because they said I have some Native American blood and they have different physiology, but
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:46.200]  the point is I still have an injury from 12 years ago when he was getting ready to run
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:50.200]  for president. In fact, YouTube Alex Jones arrested for asking George Bush a question.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:55.200]  Let's show that, an oldie but a goodie. Same thing. But he'd been given the same speech
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:58.200]  over and over again. He was supposed to have a press conference. He said, and that's what
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:04.200]  I want to do for Texas. I knew he was done. The press was all there. They saw I was there
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:09.200]  so they didn't go to questions. So I said, well, what about the New World Order? What
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:14.200]  about the CFR? Isn't that what's important, Governor? They got my arm, twisted it, kidnapped
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:21.200]  me for an hour, and then threw me out on the side of the highway without charges. I've
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:27.200]  got a tear in my shoulder from that today because I'm not a human. The cops doing the
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:31.200]  same thing here. Twisting his arm. They're not resisting. Then they threatened to arrest
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:41.200]  them. They want to arrest them because how dare an American speak up at a public event?
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:48.200]  It's incredible. People love the tyranny. Did you find the YouTube of Alex Jones arrested
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:55.200]  for asking Bush a question? It's all over the place. Alex Jones arrested by Bush. It's
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:00.200]  all over. While they're finding that, let's go ahead and take another phone call. Let's
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:06.200]  go ahead and talk to, by the way, those guys confronting him are heroes. It's that active
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:12.200]  resistance. And just like a month ago, nobody dislikes the body scanners. Nobody dislikes
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:18.200]  the pat-downs. A month later, Reuters pulled 96% or against it won't fly. You are always
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:26.200]  angry. We're not the minority. We're the majority. Let's talk to Chris in Canada. Chris, go
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:33.200]  ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to tell a story about when I lived in South
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:39.200]  Korea, actually, and it ties into the body scanner thing. My fiancee at the time, my wife,
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:45.200]  we started a blog and it was called the anti-NWO blog in Korean. And we used to take info wars
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:50.200]  stories and translate it to Korean and other stories, especially related to the body scanners
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:59.200]  and translate that into Korean. So after about two weeks of having our blog up, we got knocked
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:04.200]  on the door and it was from the Korean police. And they were saying that they were going to
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:09.200]  take my wife basically for my fiancee at the time. And because they found a post that she
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:16.200]  made like two years ago about smoking marijuana. Yeah, South Korea has a lot of its own
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:21.200]  tyranny as well. When I said free, I mean free compared to the North, but it's got a lot of
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:27.200]  oppressive stuff. But good people in Korea, we have, according to Alexa and other rating
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:35.200]  systems, we're very, very popular in Korea. Yeah, and I just really wanted to talk about
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:40.200]  what's going to come down the pipe, especially if they make us post with our real IDs and
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:43.200]  stuff like that, and ID numbers or whatever it is, because that's exactly- Yeah, that's
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:48.200]  the Microsoft plan. That's one of the ways they plan on killing the web is make you do
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:53.200]  it with IDs. Then they can ID spoof you and set you up. That's one of their favorites.
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.200]  And anyway, the police just wouldn't stop. They basically harassed us saying that even
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:02.200]  if her hair tests that they are going to make her do comes back, not showing anything, they're
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.200]  going to find something else. So we ended up just leaving the country. We're living in
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:11.200]  Canada now. So they didn't like you talking about Big Brother? No, especially about the
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:15.200]  police scanners, which were just put in. So anyway, we get on the plane, fly back here,
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:20.200]  and it was just the trip from hell, basically, going through the Vancouver airport. Like,
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:24.200]  they searched my dog twice. I missed a couple of flights because I had to transfer planes
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:31.200]  and help us up customs, searching the dog. And then we got out and the computer database
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:37.200]  for the next flight wouldn't take my name for three hours. And by the way, the UN and others
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:44.200]  have said they want to make travel almost impossible. And they want to ban non essential travel
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:49.200]  because of the carbon footprint. But we actually have documents. In fact, we reprinted, I know it was
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.200]  in the stack yesterday, where the Rockefeller Foundation said in the 60s that they want to
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:59.200]  make travel near impossible. They want to isolate you all to your locale as a way to
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:05.200]  control people. And the kicker of the whole thing was when I got through all the other
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:09.200]  security, you know, metal detector, I'm fine. They pulled me aside and said that they're
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:14.200]  going to body search me this time. And they had this big guy just seem like a real pervert
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:19.200]  using the palms of his hands, going really slow, saying, I'm just going to put my hands on
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:23.200]  the small ear back now. And he's like, oh, do you have any pain? Do you have any pain?
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:28.200]  He's like, you're awfully tense. So I ended up just, I swore at the guy and said, basically,
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:33.200]  what the F do you think? I've been on a plane for, you know, 10 hours. I haven't, I've missed,
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:37.200]  you know, three or four planes here. And then he tells me I've got to go bend over and he
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:44.200]  bends me over on the conveyor belt, goes up and down my legs and squeezes my butt and
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:48.200]  says I'm free to go. It's just like we haven't flown since it was the most horrible time
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:51.200]  we took down our blog. It was just, it was horrible.
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:56.200]  Well, the answer is don't back down, fight back 10 times more, Chris. God bless you.
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:00.200]  I'm getting a lot of emails, people saying, I'll just move to Canada. I'll just move to Europe.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:07.200]  Canada is even worse. Canada is the model of this. I mean, that's one place I will not
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:12.200]  go back to. I mean, they literally kept me for 15 hours, screamed at me, said they were
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:21.200]  going to put me in prison, felt me up. But here's the issue. TSAA now admits they do
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:25.200]  have men searching women. They were trying to deny that a week ago on the TSA blog.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:31.200]  We have video of it. The news has video of it. They also admit, okay, we are doing more
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:36.200]  invasive pat downs. Now they announced more invasive three weeks ago that they'd already
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:40.200]  been beta testing, but they're doing it widespread. Then they said, no, we're not touching genitals.
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:45.200]  Now they come out today and say, yeah, we're sticking our hand in your pants.
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:52.200]  Now that's exactly what they do. And I can't, every time you see a super gorgeous woman in
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:58.200]  line because that's who wants to work. There's perverts. They pull her out and literally
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:04.200]  it's perving. You watch the men and they go, I'm just going to touch your hair. I'm just
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:08.200]  going to go through your hair now. I'm just going to touch your face now. I'm just going
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:12.200]  to touch the, and they just, oh, I'm going to touch these now. Okay, now I'm just going
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:15.200]  to, and then they stick their hand in their pants. They're like, oh, I'm just going to,
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:20.200]  and then they, and that's actually in the newspapers today. Even Mother Jones is reporting
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:27.200]  on it. That's what I've got in front of witnesses. This young 22 year old, you know, hot blind
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:35.200]  college students in Amarillo and they, they pulled her blouse down. They say on accident
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:39.200]  with her breast and then all laughed and came up and wanted her number and said, oh, I'm
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.200]  going to, I'm going to go back and watch the video of that because she was, they can't even
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:45.200]  control themselves. They just think it's normal because they've got the power. They're just
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:51.200]  like baby, baby. And she started crying not when they were grabbing her breast or a crotch
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:55.200]  when they got her hair. They're just like, oh, baby, oh, let me make sure that it just
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:01.200]  like you said, oh, is that hurting your back? Bend over right here. Oh, let me go. Yeah.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:07.200]  And I mean, these are people that like it. A normal man wants a woman to be into it. I
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:12.200]  mean, if my wife isn't excited, I'm not excited, but see, I'm normal. I'm a real man. I don't
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:19.200]  want to exercise power over weak people. I want to exercise power over a bully who's stupid
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.200]  enough to swing first and just make sure it's on a surveillance camera so I can stomp you
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:29.200]  royal. Okay. I mean, I don't, and I don't even want to fight them till they do that. The point
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:35.200]  is, is that somebody who's centered and strong and wholesome wants to fight tyranny, wants
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:40.200]  to fight bullies. A real warrior wants to fight other warriors. A real man or a real woman,
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:47.200]  they want somebody who's into it. The greatest pleasure is giving pleasure. You know, whether
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.200]  it's cooking a meal for friends or buying buddies a drink, that's the real pleasure in life.
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:57.200]  Not, not, but these people get off on it and I've watched them. I was in San Jose three
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:01.200]  weeks ago and we went through and I said, Aaron, wait, let's get coffee right here.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:05.200]  Cause I told the story, but I tell it again. I was, but I'll tell the full story. I was
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:10.200]  like, Aaron, just coffee. Let's get some coffee. Let's sit here and cause our plane's not for
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:15.200]  45 minutes. Let's watch because look, there's four lines and it's only women and children
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:19.200]  being sent through the scanners. And for 20 minutes we sat there drinking coffee and we're
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:26.200]  like, it was only women and children because they know they'll submit. And there's the
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:31.200]  Amarillo Globe News lawsuit airport search incident. And, and these women talk about,
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:36.200]  they can't handle it. Mother Jones has the best article about it. I forget the headline.
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:40.200]  We just type Alex Jones into Google because I'm in there too. You'll, you'll find it's
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:44.200]  got the Michelle incident with one of our crew here at the office and her 20 month old
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:49.200]  daughter. Yeah, there it is. Dude's the TSA. Don't touch that junk. And Mother Jones does
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:54.200]  point out something I hadn't remembered, but they, they spurred my, my memory on this.
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:58.200]  It's been women freaking out about this for six, seven, eight years because it is mainly
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:03.200]  women that the pervs pull out. Now they're just trying to do it to basically everybody
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:07.200]  as they phase it in. And they go through that now it's men fighting back, but then they
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:12.200]  mention a bunch of stories of women I didn't know about like this Amarillo one. And, and
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:15.200]  there's another woman in the story of memory serves. It's when they get to the hair, they're
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:21.200]  like, and, and they report that the men get that quiet sex voice going like, oh baby,
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:27.200]  I'm just going to check this now. I'm just going to, the female staffer for Alex Jones
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:31.200]  radio show described how she was given the ridiculously thorough pat down by a male
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:36.200]  screener when he moved on to do the same thing to a woman's 21th old and eight year old
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:41.200]  daughter. She had to step in and Amarillo, a woman sued the TSA after an agent pulled down
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:45.200]  her blouse revealing her breast during a pat down. The TSA employees laughed and joked
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:50.200]  about the incident even after the woman started crying. Minnesota woman is a rape survivor
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:55.200]  got an enhanced pat down from a male TSA agent after opting out. She says she couldn't
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:59.200]  handle it once he started rubbing through her hair. He also grabbed the, the breast and
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:04.200]  the junk. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:08.200]  non hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:12.200]  in a real meltdown, non hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:16.200]  It's true. Seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:20.200]  it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:24.200]  have put together the perfect mix of non hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:29.200]  bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:33.200]  family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:38.200]  in any way. Do you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden?
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:43.200]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com

[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:13.200]  My name is Crystal. I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:17.200]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:21.200]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:22.200]  What did Crystal do?
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:26.200]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.

[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:28.200]  I'm taking fight. I said, I'll never give it up.
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:32.200]  I'm taking fight. I said, I'll never give it up.
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:34.200]  And tall, baby.
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:38.200]  All right, we are back alive.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:42.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:48.200]  You know, I love it because I know that you're not going to sit around as the world goes by
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:51.200]  letting these globalists rape you.
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:56.200]  You're going to stand up and we're going to take humanity back and point our direction to the stars
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:58.200]  and the next level in our development.
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:01.200]  The New World Order and the globalists are going down.
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:05.200]  Look at this. Senators and TSA defend lovepats at airports.
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:08.200]  Now they're calling it lovepats.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:14.200]  That's like Bush calling his plan to drug half of U.S. schoolchildren the New Freedom Initiative.
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:21.200]  Or that's like Bush's people calling the Patriot Act, the Patriot Act.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:27.200]  CBS News calls the pats lovepats.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:30.200]  I mean, I can't handle it anymore.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:36.200]  Mercury's good for you. Torture's good. Lovepats are good.
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:43.200]  Oh yeah, it's real loving with these women, with guys touching their genitals, touching their breast inside their pants
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:47.200]  and then rubbing through their hair.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:51.200]  I can't handle it anymore. This is just getting too insane.
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:53.200]  They just keep bringing me in crazy articles.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:56.200]  Duncan blasts TSA Pat Downs body scanners.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.200]  Congressman John J. Duncan.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:03.200]  But see, the globalists will just blow up an airplane and say, see, we told you.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:07.200]  Now we've got to do cavity searches. Order with Al Qaeda.
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:13.200]  See how when you give in to the fake terror card, the sky's the limit, literally.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:17.200]  All right, here's the George Bush clip that I'm going to Bob, Noah, Adam, Jen and Gator.
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.200]  And then I've got to get to the news. I've got to do it.
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:21.200]  I'm taking a lot of calls today though and it's a lot of fun.
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:24.200]  Let's go ahead and it's fun to fight tyranny.
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:30.200]  Let's go ahead and play this clip though of where the same thing happened to yours truly, but I even got kidnapped, not arrested.
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:34.200]  It was official oppression and then thrown out on the side of the highway.
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:40.200]  Because they knew they had no reason to manhandle me and do this. Here's the clip.
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:46.200]  98 is going to be good for Texas. And that's the most important thing about the campaign.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:49.200]  Sir, shouldn't we abolish the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:53.200]  That's the real reality that none of you will talk about most of you are members.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:57.200]  That's what's destroying this country, Governor.
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:59.200]  Don't you stand for America, sir?
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:02.200]  What about the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:05.200]  You people are being lied to. This country's been taken over by Europe.
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:08.200]  And I'm being drug up. Laugh at it.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:15.200]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:23.200]  Maybe 1% knew about the Federal Reserve 12 years ago when I did that.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.200]  Let's trap them up against the wall.
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:27.200]  Yeah, don't you love it?
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:31.200]  Don't you just love what they're doing and what they're up to?
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:36.200]  Look at him, boy. He's got my fist all the way up in the middle of my back.
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.200]  He's going to show me. He's going to hurt me.
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:40.200]  He's going to hurt me for the rest of my life.
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:42.200]  Because I dare have a First Amendment.
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:44.200]  Well, don't worry, the bankers are going to take your pension fund, buddy.
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:48.200]  They're going to put uranium and fluoride and mercury in your water.
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:51.200]  Don't worry, they're going to give you GMO and they're going to murder you.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:55.200]  You know, you're a microcosm of what you do to me.
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:59.200]  You think they could give you this unlawful power just to hurt people?
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:01.200]  Do it because they're criminal.
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:07.200]  And look, you've got the Texas Ranger right there making sure this evil person gets in trouble.
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:10.200]  They told me, you're getting charged with this. You're getting charged with that.
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:13.200]  And I said, good. I can't wait to sue all of you.
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:16.200]  Well, then we'll just kidnap you then.
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:20.200]  All right, I'm coming back and going to your phone calls quickly.
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:24.200]  I'm going to try to be quick now, 800-259-9231.
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:26.200]  Then I'm getting into the news.
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:29.200]  Some days I get to it all up front, some days I won't get to it all.
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:32.200]  Some days I cover nothing but news or some days nothing but cash.
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:36.200]  But whatever we do, it's hardcore, it's focused, it's unflinching,
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:57.200]  and it's all done for the love of liberty.
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:08.200]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:11.200]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:14.200]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver,
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:17.200]  you should consider a food savings account from E-Foods Direct.
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:19.200]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:25.200]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:30.200]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:35.200]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:38.200]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:44.200]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet, or call 800-409-5633.
[01:59:44.200 --> 02:00:06.200]  That's eFoodsDirect.com, or 800-409-5633.
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:32.200]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:35.200]  We're now into hour number three, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:39.200]  I'm going to cover the latest TSA legislative and financial news,
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:42.200]  but I want to continue with your calls, love the directions you're taking us in.
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:45.200]  Robin Idaho, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:46.200]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:47.200]  Hey, buddy.
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:49.200]  How are you doing today?
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.200]  I'm doing wonderful.
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:52.200]  Good. I'm angry.
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:55.200]  I have my own TSA horror story from two days ago.
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:59.200]  Use your aggressive feelings, boy. Tell me about it.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:03.200]  We were scheduled to fly out of Spokane, Washington,
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:09.200]  and, cologne, behold, they had just installed one of those full-body scanners on Saturday,
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:13.200]  which we did not know about. And when we got to the airport,
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:18.200]  you know, take off our shoes and all that other crap and go up,
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:22.200]  and they were running everybody through the full-body scanner.
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:24.200]  They were not giving them an option.
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:27.200]  Now, let me stop you. I want to hear your story, but I want to explain something.
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:30.200]  This is all Pavlovian dog training. They admit it.
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:36.200]  First, it's only a few airports to train the cadres of people to learn how folks resist it.
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:39.200]  Then it goes into 2030. Then 100.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:43.200]  They plan to have these in over 200, all the major airports,
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:45.200]  then in the shopping malls, then in the schools.
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:49.200]  It's all been announced, and it's about training their people, training you.
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:53.200]  The TSA admits that soon everyone will be forced.
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:55.200]  The El Paso Times reported a few months ago.
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:57.200]  Everyone there is being forced.
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:00.200]  So, yes, this is all incremental because they know psychology.
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.200]  They know the average person goes, well, mine doesn't have it yet,
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:06.200]  so I'm not going to fight back. And by the time you get involved,
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:09.200]  they've now set the precedent. Sorry, tell us your story.
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:15.200]  That's okay. In my opinion, it's the same Nazi dehumanization program
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:20.200]  that the Nazi used on the Jews, and they're doing it to us, the general public.
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:24.200]  But they were telling everybody to go through the body scanner.
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:27.200]  My wife and I opted out. Actually, when we opted out,
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:31.200]  there was about 40% of the people that said, no, we won't do it.
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:34.200]  Oh, that's key. So you were the first person to trigger,
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:37.200]  because people were just in that sheet mode.
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.200]  Imagine if somebody going into the gas chambers, all naked stripped down,
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:44.200]  would have said no, or going into the pits to be shot in the back of the head.
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:48.200]  So as soon as you say no, suddenly others find courage.
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:53.200]  Well, they sent us over to this little gate, an agent.
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:59.200]  The TSA, I feel the TSA stands for Too Stupid for Arby's.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:02.200]  The agent was explaining what he was going to do.
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:06.200]  And I asked him, I says, how does it feel to be violating the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution?
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:11.200]  And one of their clowns was right behind me, and he says,
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:15.200]  well, you know, as soon as you walked through that gate and came to our secure area,
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:18.200]  you lost some of your constitutional rights.
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:23.200]  And all I did, I turned around and I said, FU, you and I don't have a conversation.
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:25.200]  Turn my back on him.
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:30.200]  Let me expand on that. We actually have the law and I knew it was civil because I read it years ago.
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:36.200]  In 2002, they just seized the airports and the airports agreed to it.
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:41.200]  But see, it's quasi-public, so people call them officers.
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:43.200]  They're not sworn officers.
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:50.200]  They're hired agents who are creating a precedence for overturning the entire rule of law.
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:54.200]  Airports don't even have to have the TSA there.
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:58.200]  It's all made up. So their argument is you don't have to use this,
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:02.200]  but the lawsuits need to be launched and no one's done this yet
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:07.200]  in that taxpayer money is used to build those airports.
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:13.200]  So once taxpayer money is used for a facility and there's hundreds of federal and state cases on this,
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:18.200]  they can no longer restrict constitutional rights or free speech on those facilities.
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:21.200]  I'm sure you've heard about government buildings or sports stadiums
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:25.200]  where people get arrested out front handing out political literature or wearing t-shirts
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:30.200]  and then they lose the lawsuit because taxpayer funds were used in the building of it.
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:35.200]  So this is all a color of law fraud. How did this end, Bob?
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:40.200]  Well, we went to the enhanced pat-down area. It's in public.
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:44.200]  The guy explained what he's going to do and I told him if you do anything,
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:47.200]  what I feel is wrong, I'm stepping back, we're leaving.
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:51.200]  He was very careful with me. The woman was not very careful with my wife.
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:56.200]  Stay there. Stay there. I want to hear about the rape down on the other side here in Airstrip 1.
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:07.200]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:12.200]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:20.200]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:29.200]  They're so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:34.200]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:39.200]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:46.200]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:50.200]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:55.200]  so you can ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:06:20.200]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.

[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:24.200]  Take my word for it. Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:30.200]  Since 1947, Calben Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:32.200]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:40.200]  Well Marty, what do you have to say?

[02:07:50.200 --> 02:08:12.200]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:17.200]  We're already into hour number three and that's why I don't take a lot of calls because once I start I can't stop.
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:22.200]  I don't like bonbons or potato chips. I love talking to you. You're so great.
[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:26.200]  I don't get into all the info, but it doesn't matter. Callers just bring up other info that's just as important.
[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:32.200]  I got a clip coming up. Representative John Duncan, former chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee,
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:37.200]  he's about to become that again or maybe even higher level because Republicans are coming back in.
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:44.200]  He really blasted him and points out, Chertoff, somebody in his own party, has got a sweetheart deal.
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:51.200]  This is what I like seeing people getting out of their partisanship, attacking corruption wherever you see it.
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:09:00.200]  I mean, that's not hard to do. Just start attacking corruption like Ron Paul does no matter where you see it.
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:09.200]  And when you're not lying and when you're just doing what's right, life is a lot easier than having to be a scallywag
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:12.200]  and having to remember all the different lies and having to keep it all together.
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:22.200]  So that's coming up in a minute. Okay, so Bob in Idaho, you were talking about your wife and you were going through the new body scanner.
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:29.200]  You refused. So they gave you the grope down, which they admit is designed to make you do the scanner, the radiation bather.
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:32.200]  And they do record your naked body. They've been caught lying about that.
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:35.200]  But you said they were not as careful with your wife. Tell us about that.
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:46.200]  The woman that was patting her down, I'll say, touched her groin four times. Not once, not twice, four times.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:49.200]  Why do you think that woman works there? She likes it.
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:55.200]  I understand. My wife is a normal, she's normally a quiet woman.
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:10:07.200]  But she cussed that woman out more than once. And it basically traumatized my wife and she was finally able to settle down today.
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:08.200]  Two days later.
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:14.200]  They think how it's traumatizing the TSA, but we know from internal TSA reports that they call them in and they say,
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:17.200]  do you mind grabbing genitals? Do you mind sticking your hand in?
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:20.200]  Do you mind putting people through the radiation systems?
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:27.200]  And if they have any qualms, they go, thank you, your review is finished. And then when they get their paycheck a week later, pink slip, you're laid off.
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:37.200]  So they're building an army. That's why the government does these secret bio tests and chemical tests, killing foster children, troops and others.
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:41.200]  It's not to test the weapons. They know what they do. It's to create these cadres.
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:46.200]  Can you imagine the sizes of these armies of death that they've got?
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:51.200]  I mean, these armies of goons at every level. That's why we're in so much trouble.
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:57.200]  And we are currently, we are looking for a class action suit to join.
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:03.200]  Well, I think, I think they've kicked off some of those class action suits and the ACLU is talking about one. So let's do it.
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:07.200]  Well, I'm sorry your wife's upset. Just start fighting the New World Order full time.
[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:10.200]  And Bob, this is a big wake up call for everybody.
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:16.200]  And then sometimes you got to make dictators act like dictators before folks finally wake up. God bless you.
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:24.200]  Let's play this representative, John J. Duncan, talking about, and he's the former head of the Aviation Subcommittee.
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:27.200]  He's about to be the head again. Now the Republicans are back in.
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:35.200]  Here he is blasting Chertoff, who makes money off the machines that he ordered while he was in power.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:47.200]  Now, if that isn't illegal, I don't know what is. That's kind of like Henry Paulson getting tens of millions of dollars of bonus money out of Goldman Sachs, which he headed up.
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:55.200]  But as Treasury Secretary, he gave it to himself and they said Congressman Stern said, where did you get the waiver for that?
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:00.200]  And he said, oh, I got it from the, from the Treasury and they said, who was the head of the Treasury? Well, I am.
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:07.200]  It'd be like if a bank president said, I gave myself a waiver to have an armed robbery of the bank, but they just do it.
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:12.200]  But this is all starting to come out. The absurdity. And they do it all with the name of authority.
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:18.200]  And well, we're the bosses. No, you're not the bosses. You're a bunch of slimy scum. It's over.
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:21.200]  Let's go ahead and play the clip. Here it is.
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:26.200]  Mr. Speaker, a nationwide revolt is developing over the body scanners at the airports and it should.
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:33.200]  Hundreds of thousands of frequent flyers who fly each week are upset about getting these frequent doses of radiation.
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:40.200]  Parents are upset about being forced to have their children radiated or being touched inappropriately by an unrelated adult.
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:48.200]  There's already plenty of security at the airport, but now we are going to spend up to $300 million to install 1,000 scanners.
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:51.200]  This is much more about money than it is about security.
[02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:59.200]  The former Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, represents Rappascan, the company which is selling these scanners to his former department.
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:03.200]  Far too many federal contracts are sweetheart insider deals.
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:11.200]  Companies hire former high-ranking federal officials and then, magically, those companies get hugely profitable federal contracts.
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:20.200]  The American people should not have to choose between having full body radiation or a very embarrassing, intrusive pat-down every time they fly,
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:25.200]  as if they were criminals. We need a little more balance and common sense on that.
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:29.200]  But I thought we liked a police state. We liked this fetish of being scared of the Muslims.
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:33.200]  I mean, let's say 9-11 was really a Muslim job.
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:41.200]  15 of the 19 come from Saudi Arabia. We invade Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:43.200]  There's no WMDs. They lied about that.
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:53.200]  Came out in the White House memos that Bush wanted to shoot down a US airplane or have it shot down to blame it on Saddam.
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:55.200]  We know they staged these events.
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:14:04.200]  But even if it was real terror, you got a better chance of being struck by lightning, a better chance of drowning, a better chance of dying in a car wreck,
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:06.200]  a better chance of getting rare cancer.
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:15.200]  But it's so scary and the media hype said, it's this perception. And we're sacrificing all of our liberties on the altar of it.
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:17.200]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:23.200]  And there's more than one way to skin a Nazi-like thug.
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:31.200]  And the way to go after Chertoff, Herr Chertoff, is to point out that, A, he's a dual citizen of Israel.
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:38.200]  His parents were Mossad spies. That's a big issue.
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:41.200]  You shouldn't have somebody who had a Homeland Security that's a known spy.
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:48.200]  Kind of like, what's his name now, running for mayor up in Chicago.
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:50.200]  Yeah, Rahm Emanuel.
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:54.200]  I mean, his mommy and daddy were eargun commanders staging terror attacks.
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:15:00.200]  I mean, the point is, that's one way to go after these guys, because it's wrong what they've done.
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:05.200]  But, I mean, we shouldn't have former KGB bosses, you know, running our country or Chinese spies running it.
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:07.200]  I mean, I'm into sovereignty.
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:12.200]  But the bigger issue is you go after them for the sweetheart deal insider contracts.
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:19.200]  You know, they're sending Rangel up the river for pretty petty stuff like trying to avoid some taxes.
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:22.200]  And I'm not saying that's good, because he's a big tax expender.
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:29.200]  Or, you know, using funds out of an account to pay for lawyers. I mean, big deal.
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:33.200]  I'm not saying Rangel's good. The point is, why don't we go after Chertoff?
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:37.200]  Why don't we go after Halliburton and all its corruption? Why don't we go after Dincourt?
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:40.200]  Why don't we go after the Federal Reserve? Why don't we go after the real Crooks?
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:47.200]  Why, for 11 years, did the Securities and Exchange Commission know exactly what Bernie Madoff was doing and protecting?
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:51.200]  Because the big Crooks are protected.
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:55.200]  And I'll say it, Chertoff is a crook.
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:58.200]  He's violating our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:01.200]  He went along with tyranny. He went along with corruption.
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:04.200]  He covered up the truth about 9-11 and his Homeland Security head.
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:09.200]  Ridge admitted that their agency routinely issued fake terror alerts.
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:13.200]  We know that continued under Chertoff. That's a violation of the Patriot Act issuing fake terror alerts.
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:19.200]  And he began the lobbying and the orders for the first naked scanners that went in
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:25.200]  before he even left office and now he heads the company up.
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:29.200]  So let's go after him. Let's start talking about Herr Chertoff.
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:32.200]  We've been talking about this for years. Now it's all over the news.
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:36.200]  Now it's the top link on the Drudge Report.
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:39.200]  This is more like it, the Drudge Report going after Chertoff.
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:45.200]  That's what I like. I like seeing Matt Drudge not be just a Republican and be a real populist.
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:47.200]  Let's go after all of them together.
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:51.200]  Let's go after Hillary. Let's go after Obama. Let's go after Bush.
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:55.200]  Let's go after Cheney. Let's go after Chertoff. Let's go after Bloomberg.
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:59.200]  Bloomberg, give me a break with all his offshore corporations and the rest of it.
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:03.200]  Let's go after all of them. Let's go after all the hypocrites.
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:08.200]  Bloomberg hadn't found a tax he didn't love. Meanwhile, he's got most of his money offshore.
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:12.200]  Google pays 2.4% tax.
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:18.200]  Middle-class companies pay 40%. I pay 40% corporate tax.
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:23.200]  I pay supposedly 35% personal. It's more like 45%.
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:28.200]  There's nothing enough for these people. If I made more money, it'd go to these employees.
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:30.200]  It'd go to hiring more people.
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:34.200]  I don't get 111 waivers like Jack in the Box and McDonald's.
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:39.200]  If I want to start a hamburger place, I'm not going to get the waivers on insurance.
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:43.200]  So I'm not going to be able to pay the people a good wage and get them insurance.
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:46.200]  I'm going to go out of business, but McDonald's and Walmart,
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:49.200]  they're going to be able to lower prices and put me out of business.
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:53.200]  That's how this tyranny works.
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:58.200]  It's all about the big mega corporations being above the law and Google being government run.
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:03.200]  Google's a criminal organization. Indite them for all their admitted crimes, illegal spying.
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:07.200]  Bloomberg's got illegal offshore corporations. Inditing.
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:12.200]  Chertoff's illegal. Inditing. Indite, indict, indict, indict.
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:17.200]  I don't want a lawless revolution. I want to take our governments back, our state legislatures back.
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:20.200]  I want to indict all these people and let a jury see the evidence.
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:24.200]  And then we'll take all the marijuana smokers out of the prisons who've done nothing wrong,
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:28.200]  but are good at making license plates and furniture and driving down wages.
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:32.200]  They work for average 25 cents an hour. All you idiots say make prisoners work.
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:36.200]  Fools. You want Shawshank Redemption. That's how the real world works, even though it's fiction.
[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:40.200]  That's the truth hiding in fiction.
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:46.200]  And let's stick all these people in the prisons. Let's give them trials, juries, everything.
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:53.200]  We've got plenty of room for them. You want a nice prison? Here it is.
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:58.200]  Let me tell you, you start busting 10, 15, 20. They're going to start rolling over on each other.
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:03.200]  And you'll see a huge route. This whole house of cards will just fall down.
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:07.200]  Does that mean we'll be in Valhalla? Some type of heavenly utopia? No.
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:11.200]  The corruption will start right back over. And we've all got an appetite for corruption.
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:14.200]  And there's a lot of people in the system that make money out of the corruption.
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:19.200]  You've got to decide. Do you want total tyranny? Or do you want to have liberty?
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:25.200]  And you've got to decide what type of country and world you want to live in.
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:31.200]  These people are committing crimes right out in the open.
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:41.200]  If you try to set up an offshore corporation and pay 2.4% corporate tax, you're going to prison.
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:44.200]  Let's say you're making a million dollars a year. That's mainly who they bust.
[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:48.200]  Those thousands of Swiss bank accounts they grabbed, on average, they were a little over a million.
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:53.200]  They're not grabbing the billions. They're not grabbing the U.S. generals with all their accounts.
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:59.200]  No. They're not investigating the 4 trillion now missing from the Pentagon in the last 10 years.
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:01.200]  Let's investigate the little guys.
[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:33.200]  No. 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:36.200]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:41.200]  No. 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:46.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:52.200]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:52.200 --> 02:21:00.200]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:06.200]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S. dollar has been devaluating.
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:10.200]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:13.200]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:18.200]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver. They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:25.200]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now,
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:28.200]  your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:31.200]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:34.200]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:41.200]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:59.200]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:05.200]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:08.200]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:12.200]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:16.200]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:22.200]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:26.200]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:30.200]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:31.200]  You're being warned.
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:35.200]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law.
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:39.200]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:44.200]  Don't tread on me, rise the republic, tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant
[02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:46.200]  that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:51.200]  A new tool in the Info War, don't tread on me, order it at infowars.com
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:56.200]  or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139

[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:05.200]  Hurricanes, ice storms, blackouts, and the prospect of civil unrest.
[02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:09.200]  When the unexpected happens, will you be ready?
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:14.200]  Hundreds of concerned citizens across America have already installed wind generators to help protect their families
[02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:16.200]  in the event of a disaster.

[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:27.200]  All right, I better get moving or I'll never get to the snooze and it's all off the charts.
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:35.200]  Paul Watson's got a new article up on prisonplanet.com who knows if it's destined to the dredge report.
[02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:44.200]  I think it's important DHS source TSA infuriated with coverage of national backlash
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:51.200]  because if they fail here, their federal goon takeover beachhead, they will fail on every front.
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:58.200]  This is like Hitler in Leningrad, that year-and-a-half battle.
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:03.200]  And the Russians knew and the Nazis knew whoever won that battle would win the war.
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:07.200]  And the tide is turning at Leningrad against the Nazis.
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:14.200]  And I'm not in this analogy saying the Soviets were good, but the point is you get what I'm saying.
[02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:19.200]  Let's go ahead and it was two evil groups fighting each other.
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:22.200]  But I do use the analogy of Hitler's Barbarossa.
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:27.200]  The TSA is Hitler and if they win here, it's going to be a harder fight.
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:34.200]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:38.200]  Let's talk to Noah in Oklahoma. You're on the air. Welcome.
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:43.200]  Hi, Alex. I've got a friend here in Oklahoma. He's an Oklahoma highway patrolman.
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:52.200]  And he kind of keeps me informed of what's going on and he lets me have his old editions of a magazine called Law Officer.
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:56.200]  And he said, you know, just read some of these articles in here and you'll see.
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:58.200]  And he actually was the one that turned me on to you.
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:01.200]  And so I said, man, at least I've got one patriot out here.
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:10.200]  But he gave me the November issue with the volume six of Law Officer and I think it's Law Officer.
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:19.200]  And it's all about how in Pennsylvania, the FEMA has just trained a big group of law enforcement agents.
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:24.200]  I mean, I don't have time to go through the whole article, but that's just for your information.
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:28.200]  And then I wanted to tell you about something else that he's kind of turned me on to.
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:35.200]  Well, it came out in Pennsylvania. They were using an Israeli company illegally to even spy on the legislature.
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:42.200]  So, I mean, it's just off the chart, secret spy grids with these fusion centers who aren't even federal run.
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:44.200]  They're foreign government run.
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:51.200]  But no, I mean, get into this law enforcement publication because I remember right before 9-11,
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:57.200]  reading the law enforcement publications off the shelf saying how great torture was.
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:04.200]  And would you torture a child to get a terrorist to answer questions and how it was good?
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:06.200]  They're trying to warp the minds of police.
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:13.200]  So, tell me about the issue and then tell me what the law enforcement publication said was going on in Pennsylvania.
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:20.200]  Well, basically, he gave it to me and I haven't had time to read the entire thing. I'm still at work right now.
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:21.200]  What's the name of it?
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:24.200]  The name of it is, and I have one more thing to tell you.
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:25.200]  Go ahead.
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:30.200]  It's on page 10 and it's called Getting Ready.
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:35.200]  And what I just kind of skimmed through, kind of sped right through it, but what I got out of it was they're getting ready,
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:43.200]  not for men and turbines, but they're getting ready for political get-togethers and the right to assemble.
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:44.200]  It's all about...
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:47.200]  No, no, no. That's the benefit, of course. That's the bait and switch.
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:51.200]  They tell you it's for turbine men the whole time, even back under Bush.
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:57.200]  It's all about gun owners, conservatives, land rights people because they got rid of Glass-Steagall, the Republicans and Democrats together.
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:02.200]  They know they're getting ready to get rid of Social Security. They know they're getting ready to take your pension funds.
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:06.200]  They know they're getting ready to devalue your money. They're bringing us into economic slavery.
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:10.200]  And so they're getting you ready for the cops to mow you down on the streets.
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:13.200]  And so, of course, they're training the cops.
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:16.200]  Look, you have this hatred of the Muslim. They're going to get you.
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:21.200]  And they go, now you've been trained as an attack dog to attack the Muslim dummy.
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:25.200]  Now we're going to take the turbine off and put a John Deere cap on the dummy.
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:29.200]  Well, the dog is still going to attack the guy with the John Deere hat, okay?
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:37.200]  And so that's it, period. The police are now being turned into literal NKVD ringwraiths of hell.
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:41.200]  And then I have one more thing for you.
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:47.200]  This guy that I'm talking about, he told me that he actually had a home birth.
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:49.200]  His wife had their child at home.
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:55.200]  And he said that to avoid all this blood taking and everything, find you a trusted midwife
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:59.200]  who you just absolutely trust and you can have your baby at home.
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:03.200]  If you're physically fit and you got the financial means,
[02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:06.200]  but that is a way to keep your child out of this system.
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:09.200]  I mean, they don't even require to get a social security number.
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:11.200]  Look on their website. It's voluntary.
[02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:16.200]  So keep your children out of the system and pull them out of these dead gun schools.
[02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:19.200]  Absolutely. And stop giving your money to the Fortune 100.
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:21.200]  Great points. Appreciate that call.
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:23.200]  That guy was very evil.
[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:27.200]  Did you hear him talking about freedom and he's got a law enforcement publication?
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:31.200]  Uh, no. It's called Getting Ready.
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:33.200]  Is he still there? What was the name of the publication?
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:35.200]  Did he ever give us the name?
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:38.200]  I think he did briefly at the start. It doesn't matter. I read it everywhere.
[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:42.200]  Yeah, no, no. This whole thing's for us as you notice at the airport.
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:45.200]  And they're now saying the Muslims will be exempt, of course, from all the searches.
[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:47.200]  Of course. I mean, come on.
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:54.200]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:58.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:05.200]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:09.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:11.200]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:14.200]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:18.200]  They've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress.
[02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:20.200]  And they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:25.200]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:28.200]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:33.200]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:35.200]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:39.200]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:42.200]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:44.200]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:49.200]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:31.200]  Food is our greatest dependency,

[02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:37.200]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis,

[02:32:24.200 --> 02:32:30.200]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old, powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.200 --> 02:32:34.200]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:38.200]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:44.200]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:48.200]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:51.200]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:24.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:30.200]  I've heard the state police in Texas criticizing the naked body scanners because they don't like their genitals being grabbed.
[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:33.200]  Well, here's one out of ABC News.
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:37.200]  DA promises to prosecute overly touchy pat-downs.
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:43.200]  Yeah, you got a bunch of federal security guards now saying they're going to stick your hands in the pants.
[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:48.200]  See, that way, oh, you don't like us patting on the outside? We're going inside your pants.
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:52.200]  See how this works? See how it's always more and more and more?
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:56.200]  That way, okay, we won't go in your pants just the outside.
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:34:03.200]  And then we're going to do a proctology exam. Okay, we won't do that.
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:07.200]  We're just going to do the pat inside the pants.
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:17.200]  The San Matto District Attorney's Office has a warning to all TSA personnel that the SFO,
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:23.200]  anyone inappropriately touching a passenger during a security pat-down will be prosecuted.
[02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:36.200]  That's the incoming DA Steve Wagstaff says any complaints of inappropriate touching during an airport screening pat-down will land on his desk.
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:39.200]  And they go on to say they will prosecute.
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:50.200]  See, just because the feds hire a bunch of minimum wage 7-11 clerks and tell them that they're allowed to grab our junk doesn't mean they just get to do it.
[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:58.200]  And I don't care if you claim there might be a crime. There are muggings and murders almost every day in the town I live in of a million people.
[02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:03.200]  Do we have checkpoints at every corner to stop it? No, life is dangerous.
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:10.200]  I've seen the statistics that more people die every year in the U.S. from honeybee stings than they do from terrorism.
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:21.200]  Do we have checkpoints at every field and little body scanners for the bees to fly through and FBI most wanted with honeybees photos and everyone's scared.
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:26.200]  Oh my gosh, we've got to federalize everything if the honeybees will get us.
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:34.200]  It's a psychological fetish or mental illness to just obsess on the Arabs and how they're going to get us.
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:37.200]  Arm the pilots.
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:44.200]  We can't do that. They might shoot somebody. Oh, they can fly the big plane that they could crash or...
[02:35:44.200 --> 02:35:48.200]  But what if a pilot goes crazy? That's life.
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:51.200]  Maybe we should put a brain ship in the pilot to make sure he can't do that.
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:56.200]  I mean, where does this end?
[02:35:56.200 --> 02:36:02.200]  Where does this level of oppression end?
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:09.200]  So our big story up on Drudge today, DrudgeReport.com, TSA hit with lawsuits as revolt explodes, goes over all that.
[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:13.200]  TSA chief defends New Pat down procedure.
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:18.200]  They go on and admit that yes, it is more invasive.
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:22.200]  Here's Associated Press, TSA boss, New Pat Downs are more invasive.
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:24.200]  She just said Monday that they weren't.
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:26.200]  She said, we've always been doing these.
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:33.200]  George Soros is profiting off the new controversial TSA scanners, owns a big part of the company.
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:36.200]  Of course he does.
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:41.200]  It's all part of the inside, fun.
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:45.200]  So we've got all of those key reports.
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:50.200]  They also admit now they want to save the TSA scans to use them for biometrics.
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:52.200]  We told you that a long time ago.
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:55.200]  I mean, the pushback...
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:58.200]  Penn Gillette is talking about them trying to put their hands in this pants,
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:01.200]  and the cop at the airport wanted to arrest them.
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:03.200]  So see, this is all about common law.
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:11.200]  They're just trying to, with precedent, normalize all of these activities.
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:21.200]  Okay, continuing here, the German Interior Minister, Thomas de Mezery,
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:28.200]  on Wednesday warned that government had indications Islamists were planning terror attacks in Germany later this month.
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:31.200]  Germany's being asked to give tens of billions more to the private banks
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:35.200]  in the name of bailing out Greece and Portugal, which always just makes it worse.
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:38.200]  It's mathematically impossible to pay back through fractional reserve banking.
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:43.200]  It's made up money. It's meant to leave the banks, the private super banks, owning everything.
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:46.200]  And so, oh my gosh, they need to pass this bailout.
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:50.200]  And, oh, al-Qaeda! Al-Qaeda's going to hit.
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:53.200]  It's always when the naked body scanners are going in,
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:56.200]  or right when the head of British Airways says to remove them
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:59.200]  that the toner cartridges get mailed by Anwar Alalaki,
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:04.200]  the admitted guy hanging out at the Pentagon, commanding all these attacks.
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:09.200]  The Christmas Day, the Fort Hood, the Times Square.
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:14.200]  And, oh, right on time, oh, you don't want to give the bankers even more of your money?
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:16.200]  You don't want to have your pensions cut?
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:20.200]  I'm afraid Al-Qaeda is about to hit.
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:22.200]  And we've got all these former Clinton people saying,
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:25.200]  Obama needs a terror attack so he can act strong.
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:30.200]  I mean, they're just out in the open, like we're stupid.
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:34.200]  There is information from our foreign partners that planned attacks
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:38.200]  are allegedly to be carried out at the end of November.
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:41.200]  He said in Berlin, describing a new situation.
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:45.200]  They have burned our Reichstag. We must take your rights now.
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:46.200]  They have burned the people.
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:49.200]  Oh, excuse me, that was a 80-year-old script.
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:53.200]  77-year-old script. Let me go back.
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:57.200]  There is information from our foreign partners that planned attacks
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:01.200]  are allegedly to be carried out at the end of November.
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:05.200]  He said in Berlin, describing a new situation.
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:09.200]  Regarding the Islamists' threat to the nation.
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:11.200]  There is reason to be worried.
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:14.200]  But no reason to panic. Don't worry, we are in control.
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:19.200]  He said, mentioning concrete leads being followed by the authorities.
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:21.200]  Is that like the London Guardian and her Spiegel have reported
[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:24.200]  that every white supremacist group that has carried out firebombings
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:28.200]  and attacks is commanded and run by German secret police?
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:31.200]  Kind of like Hal Turner, the top FBI secret agent,
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:33.200]  confirmed that I told you 10 years ago I was a fed,
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:37.200]  attacking me every day, sickening all the mindless Nazis on me.
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:42.200]  I told you he was FBI. He is.
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:45.200]  The same Germans who run the white supremacists
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:48.200]  so they have an excuse to take all the free speech in Deutschland.
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:50.200]  Aha, they know what they're doing.
[02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:54.200]  But then when Kurt Waldheim, the SS officer out of Austria,
[02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:57.200]  when he becomes UN head, they defend it.
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:59.200]  Because real Nazis are no problem.
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:02.200]  Even the New York Times has had to now admit
[02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:05.200]  that the rat line in paperclip was much bigger
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:09.200]  than that Joseph Mengele was protected.
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:12.200]  You see, we don't care about real Nazis.
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:15.200]  But if you don't want government-run eugenics care,
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:17.200]  we're going to call you on.
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:19.200]  If you don't want to give us all your money,
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:22.200]  we're going to call you on and you are politically correct.
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:26.200]  So you will roll over and do what we say.
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:30.200]  Aha, it's so much fun to do it.
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:33.200]  All right, I'm sorry.
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:37.200]  It's transforming from a German accent to a Mexican accent.
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:46.200]  You got to laugh at this stuff or you'd cry.
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:49.200]  We're going to put the accent real good.
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:56.200]  I told you this a long time ago.
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:40:59.200]  The Pentagon official reports say they're never leaving Iraq.
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:05.200]  The last troops will leave except for embassies in 2024.
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:09.200]  Obama invoice secretly promised to keep troops in Iraq after 2011
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:11.200]  until at least 2014.
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:13.200]  Now, we told you that it's all fake.
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:16.200]  It feels good to be a fake liberal, so enjoy it.
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:20.200]  Continuing here with some of the other news,
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:23.200]  Bloomberg is shelling for carbon tax to fight terror.
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:25.200]  Oh, Mayor Bloomberg, I like him.
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:27.200]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:30.200]  He knows how to treat the little people.
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:33.200]  Tell them what to do and how to behave.
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:35.200]  I always dreamed of being a dictator,
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:38.200]  being worshiped like Hitler at Nuremberg or even Jesus.
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:41.200]  Remember for thousands of years.
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:43.200]  Remember that Rolling Stone interview?
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:44.200]  ADL gives him awards.
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:45.200]  Oh, you like Hitler?
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:48.200]  Here's an award.
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:53.200]  Mayor Bloomberg claims he doesn't like either party.
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:55.200]  Give me a break.
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:01.200]  NATO chief says there's no alternative to staying in Afghanistan,
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:04.200]  even though the CFR says we better get out of there.
[02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:07.200]  Just like General Hamid Ghoul was told you on this show,
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:10.200]  just like Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffers
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:13.200]  told you here on this show,
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:16.200]  this is an operation to produce drugs,
[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:18.200]  black hole to put money into,
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:20.200]  and so the bankers don't care.
[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:22.200]  They're going to keep our troops there,
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:24.200]  but they're going to get routed.
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:26.200]  Nothing can stop that.
[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:29.200]  So a lot of empires go to Afghanistan to die,
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:33.200]  and I guess that's where this empire is going to die.
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:38.200]  I guess this Afghanistan thing is our Barbarossa.
[02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:41.200]  But I say our, this isn't our military, our government.
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:43.200]  I care about the average troops,
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:47.200]  but supporting the troops means not putting them into fake false wars.
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:51.200]  But nowadays, it's this fake patriotism of, oh, send them a phone card.
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:54.200]  You know, don't get mad about them having to pay for their own medical care.
[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:57.200]  Don't get mad about the government stealing their death benefits,
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:05.200]  or don't get mad about, no, just feel good and run a flag up on your front yard.
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:13.200]  I got a bunch of other news here that I haven't even gotten into yet.
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:16.200]  Get your hands off me, TSA.
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:21.200]  These airport so-called security measures amount to state-sponsored sexual harassment.
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:26.200]  And that's an article out of the Leningradian.
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:28.200]  Very informative.
[02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:30.200]  Let me get into this bill.
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:32.200]  A few months ago, we thought we'd beaten it,
[02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:37.200]  and the problem is they're trying to ram the Dream Act through to legalize more illegal aliens.
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:41.200]  They already get in-state tuition, all part of the bankrupting of the country,
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:43.200]  out in California and other states.
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:47.200]  And again, it wouldn't even be so bad if we weren't going bankrupt,
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:49.200]  and if Mexico hadn't lost wars with us,
[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:53.200]  and if they didn't teach the people in Mexico that the U.S. belongs to them.
[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:56.200]  I mean, that's why kids in California, even Hispanic kids,
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:58.200]  can't have American flags on their backpacks,
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:02.200]  or they get sent home from school because the illegal aliens are so offended by it,
[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:04.200]  it's like a vampire seeing a cross.
[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:09.200]  I mean, why wouldn't Mexicans from Mexico want to be Americans instead of Mexicans?
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:14.200]  Nothing against the, quote, culture of being Latino or whatever.
[02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:17.200]  But I mean, Mexico is a failed joke.
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:19.200]  But again, political correctness.
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:21.200]  Oh, I'm sorry, I won't wear my American flag here.
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:24.200]  Jerk American flags down at post offices all over the country,
[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:28.200]  and run up Mexican flags, and kidnap a bunch of us,
[02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:33.200]  and do whatever you want, and then yes, sir, I'll do whatever you say.
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:35.200]  How did I just get off into that?
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:42.200]  The point is Senate Bill S-510, Food Safety Modernization Act vote imminent.
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:45.200]  And I saw this from natural news yesterday,
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:47.200]  and I thought hopefully this, that isn't right,
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:51.200]  even though Mike Adams is paramount research, and I totally respect him.
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:55.200]  And then I heard the celebrations by the Wicked Ones on NPR today,
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:58.200]  by the Rockefeller-George Soros operation,
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:00.200]  about how they're going to protect our food.
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:02.200]  Yeah, they authorize all the GMO.
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:05.200]  No studies on the salmon, they just authorize it.
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:07.200]  They authorize corn that in all the studies,
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:10.200]  the GMO corn varieties cause organ failure in all the rodents.
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:13.200]  I mean, that's just confirmed, and they just don't care.
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:16.200]  But, you know, they have some big mega agribusiness.
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:20.200]  Almost all the problems are from big mega agribusiness.
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:23.200]  I mean, I saw reports back in the late 90s of Tyson Chicken
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:26.200]  would have thousands of violations at one plant.
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:29.200]  And then their competition would have one violation and be shut down.
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:31.200]  That's how this works.
[02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:35.200]  And this, if you read the bill, we've done it on air,
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:39.200]  you can go read S-510, Senate Bill 510,
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:42.200]  and it says right there in it,
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:45.200]  that it just gives them unlimited authority to do whatever they want.
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:47.200]  They go, well, no worry, we're not going to enforce this on everybody.
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:51.200]  It says any preparation, including slicing a tomato,
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:53.200]  you're not allowed to do it.
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:56.200]  And remember what happened in Tulsa, Oklahoma?
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:45:58.200]  They said, you might be growing marijuana in your backyard.
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:01.200]  We want license or inspections to make sure preemptively
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:03.200]  you're not growing marijuana.
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:05.200]  And there's all these moves, oh, let's arrest kids
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:09.200]  or send police out that are selling cupcakes or lemonade,
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:12.200]  or let's give million-dollar fines for garage sales.
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:14.200]  They don't want any underground economy.
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:16.200]  Let's raid a health food store.
[02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:19.200]  We've got a farmer's market with cops saying, get your hands up.
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:21.200]  All those videos we've shown.
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:29.200]  Oh, my God, these people are, these people, I mean, we've got to do it.
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:34.200]  And so Senate Bill 510, but look, even if they pass this,
[02:46:34.200 --> 02:46:36.200]  don't put up with it, ignore them.
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:41.200]  But it's designed, I mean, even the FDA tells the farmers,
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:43.200]  get big or get out.
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:47.200]  You know, get into big agribusiness, consolidate, work for the big agribusiness,
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:49.200]  or get out.
[02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:53.200]  The IRS is getting rid of exemptions for hobby farmers.
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:57.200]  Most people that are still farmers in the U.S. that are small,
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:01.200]  like my family, have a few cows for the tax exemption to keep the property,
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:06.200]  the agri-exemption, and grow a few crops to just try to get the money
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:09.200]  to pay the property taxes, and you still lose money.
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:12.200]  So everybody in my family that still lives on the farm or the ranch,
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:15.200]  we've got your different family pieces all in the same area,
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:19.200]  they all work at the gas station or at the power plant,
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:23.200]  or for the power company, or at the prison.
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:27.200]  And they have the talks every year, and over time,
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:30.200]  people get cancer and stuff, they got to sell their land,
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:32.200]  you know, to pay for the bills or whatever.
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:34.200]  And they talk about, you know, what do we do?
[02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:39.200]  We got to, you know, in America, and the IRS now comes and says,
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:43.200]  we've gotten rid of hobby farms, you're not allowed to write off
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:46.200]  any money you spend on this, if you don't make money on it,
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:48.200]  you got to pay us money on all this.
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:50.200]  And so the farms are all just shutting down,
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:52.200]  the government's just laughing.
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:48:00.200]  Yes, oh yes, we're domesticating them so well.
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:05.200]  So people, people just try to keep having a few cows,
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:09.200]  try to grow some peas, or some pumpkins, or some squash,
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:11.200]  or some, the only way to make any money at it is you go out
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:13.200]  on the weekends, you work seven days a week,
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:15.200]  you set up on the highway and sell peaches,
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:18.200]  and I see the articles every few days, SWAT team pulls up,
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:20.200]  they have an undercover walkover,
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:22.200]  you sell them peaches in a brown bag,
[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:24.200]  and they get you on the ground, slam your head in the ground,
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:26.200]  and you didn't have a license for this,
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:29.200]  you didn't pay the fines or fees for the county,
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:32.200]  and now it's going to be federal fees and fines.
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:36.200]  Did you have a safety inspection of these peaches?
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:40.200]  Don't worry if you gas the peaches like they do with pesticides,
[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:44.200]  or their GMO, you know, you can have whatever you want,
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:47.200]  it's going to be fine, but, and hey, you want it,
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:49.200]  you want to be slaves, you got it,
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:51.200]  you want government sticking their hands down your pants,
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:56.200]  you want government SWAT teaming Amish, you got it.
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:02.200]  You want to be slaves?
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:11.200]  It is just, it is just amazing to have all of this going on.
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:14.200]  This is bondage, I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:17.200]  to set up here and explain to people that this is bondage,
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:19.200]  this is tyranny, this is high-tech tyranny,
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:22.200]  this is lunacy, and they get everybody to just play along with it
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:26.200]  like it's normal.
[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:28.200]  I mean they ship food in from Mexico,
[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:31.200]  where the people are defecating in the fields,
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:35.200]  and then people get salmonella and e-cola from it.
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:38.200]  I've looked into these outbreaks in the school lunch program,
[02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:41.200]  the hepatitis and the berries, remember that,
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:43.200]  and it's all out of Mexico.
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:45.200]  Did you know the beef and food out of Mexico
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.200]  doesn't even really get inspected?
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:49.200]  All the inspections are on us,
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:54.200]  just like the small companies have to get the insurance
[02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:57.200]  for their employees, but all the big agribusiness in Walmart
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:49:59.200]  and McDonald's, they're exempt.
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:01.200]  Don't you get it?
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:05.200]  You're having financial war waged against you.
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:08.200]  You think the rich people that fly on private jets get searched?
[02:50:08.200 --> 02:50:10.200]  They drive right on the airport, no security,
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:12.200]  right on the plane.
[02:50:12.200 --> 02:50:14.200]  They got mistresses on board to service them.
[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:17.200]  Literally, I've been at the airport, watch the private jets,
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:21.200]  they're running the 20-year-old prostitutes right on the plane,
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:23.200]  the execs are piling on,
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:27.200]  they're going to have a good time in Chicago or New York tonight.
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:29.200]  Meanwhile, you're there with your family,
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:31.200]  people sticking their hands down your pants,
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:33.200]  the executives are robbing everybody, you're just taking off,
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:37.200]  they're paying 2.4% tax, you're paying 40%.
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:39.200]  They're exempt from the health care,
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:41.200]  they wrote it to bankrupt you.
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:44.200]  It's all a big joke, they're mafia, they're hardcore,
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:46.200]  they own both political parties, they love it,
[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:48.200]  they love it, and they're not going to stop,
[02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:50.200]  they're going to keep driving and driving and driving,
[02:50:50.200 --> 02:50:52.200]  they hope the economy falls apart.
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:54.200]  That's in the IMF documents,
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:56.200]  released 2002 BBC Greg Palace.
[02:50:56.200 --> 02:50:59.200]  They want to bankrupt it, they can suck it up even faster then.
[02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:19.200]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:58.200]  We'll be right back.
[02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:03.200]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:05.200]  We are part of a new world order,
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:08.200]  a new world order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.200 --> 02:52:11.200]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:13.200]  through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.200 --> 02:52:15.200]  The new world order really is a tool
[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:18.200]  for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:20.200]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.200 --> 02:52:23.200]  The United Nations would take over America,
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:26.200]  the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:28.200]  Invisible Empire Chronicles,
[02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:30.200]  that's how men of power and influence
[02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:32.200]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:34.200]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:36.200]  I believe, first of all,
[02:52:36.200 --> 02:52:38.200]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[02:52:38.200 --> 02:52:40.200]  for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:42.200]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:44.200]  So it's going to be an inner,
[02:52:44.200 --> 02:52:46.200]  ruling elite, and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:48.200]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:39.200]  about the transmission.
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:41.200]  We're really starting to have a big effect.
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:43.200]  Thanks, everybody, take an action.
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:46.200]  Here's that article at prisonplanet.com.
[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:49.200]  Rockefeller Insider vowed in 1969,
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:52.200]  travel will be more difficult.
[02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:54.200]  And related to it's our article,
[02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:57.200]  Homeland Security, trying to shut down air travel.
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:54:58.200]  Yeah.
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:01.200]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:04.200]  Just like Rome controlled the roads and commerce.
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:06.200]  This is a big precedent-setting event.
[02:55:06.200 --> 02:55:07.200]  The feds are saying,
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:09.200]  we're going to hire minimum wage security guards.
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:10.200]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:11.200]  Something police can't do.
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:13.200]  Police can't randomly stick their hands down your pants.
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:14.200]  Nobody can.
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:15.200]  It's a crime.
[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:17.200]  That's why a DA is vowed to prosecute.
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:18.200]  Congress is moving against it.
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:20.200]  And yes, the private corporations
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:23.200]  will load up more bombs and blow up a few planes.
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:26.200]  And either you wake up to stage terror
[02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:28.200]  and finance provocateur terror,
[02:55:28.200 --> 02:55:32.200]  or you give in to them.
[02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:34.200]  Like sheep, humanity had better adjust
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:36.200]  to constant harassment as long as it tolerates
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:38.200]  globalist control.
[02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:40.200]  In 1969, the Rockefeller Insider,
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:43.200]  Richard Day predicted in the future in these terms,
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:45.200]  travel would become very restricted.
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:47.200]  People would need permission to travel
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:49.200]  and they would need a good reason to travel.
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:51.200]  If they didn't have a good reason for your travel,
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:53.200]  and everyone would need an ID.
[02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:55.200]  Later on, some sort of device would be developed
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:57.200]  to be implanted under the skin that would be called
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:56:00.200]  specifically encoded to identify that individual.
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:03.200]  What did Rockefeller tell Aaron Russo?
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:06.200]  He told him, everybody's going to have a chip,
[02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:09.200]  but the elite's chip is going to say, kiss my rumpus.
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:12.200]  They'll say, I'm above the law.
[02:56:12.200 --> 02:56:14.200]  By the way, Napolitano and Pistol,
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:16.200]  the head of the TSA, have now said
[02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:18.200]  that they go through pat downs.
[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:20.200]  I look this up and that's a lie.
[02:56:20.200 --> 02:56:24.200]  They both fly on private government jets.
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:27.200]  They pull in in black SUVs and get on board.
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:30.200]  Just like all the rest of general aviation,
[02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:31.200]  what liars?
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:34.200]  They just lie, lie, lie.
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:36.200]  If your neighbor lied like this,
[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:38.200]  you wouldn't associate with them.
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:40.200]  If your boss lied like this, you would quit.
[02:56:40.200 --> 02:56:42.200]  If your wife lied to you or your husband,
[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:44.200]  you'd divorce them.
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:48.200]  I mean, they just vomit lies on us.
[02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:50.200]  These people are crooks.
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:51.200]  These people are scum.
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:53.200]  They're abusive thugs.
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:56.200]  Pelosi, that painted trollop,
[02:56:56.200 --> 02:56:58.200]  has now been elected minority leader again.
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:56:59.200]  Good.
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:05.200]  She's super unpopular and a great sign of Marie Antoinette arrogance.
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:06.200]  So that's good.
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:07.200]  Keep her in there.
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:08.200]  That's excellent.
[02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:10.200]  That's excellent.
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:18.200]  She'll be just as big a wake-up as Obama and Bush were.
[02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:22.200]  Sweet drinks, national sales tax cut.
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:26.200]  Now, they always start with something that's seen as unpopular.
[02:57:26.200 --> 02:57:29.200]  Like, oh, let's ban free speech in Europe just for Nazis.
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:31.200]  And then it's for everybody.
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:36.200]  Oh, let's just put a national tax on bad things.
[02:57:36.200 --> 02:57:38.200]  And then once that precedent's set,
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:40.200]  they can do it to everything.
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:43.200]  So to pop sales, tax target to cut deficit.
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:45.200]  What is the IMF and World Bank called for?
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:47.200]  They said, you will.
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:49.200]  Barbaroso, you will.
[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:54.200]  And Von Rupe, who says nation states are dead earlier this week.
[02:57:54.200 --> 02:57:55.200]  What have they said?
[02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:57.200]  They said, we need VAT.
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:58:01.200]  We need sales taxes to fund this new world government.
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:02.200]  Now out in the open.
[02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:06.200]  And so they're going to start with something that everybody knows is bad.
[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:08.200]  Corn syrup's bad.
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:09.200]  Soda pop's bad.
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:11.200]  But where does it end?
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:14.200]  Warning of a death spiral without drastic changes.
[02:58:14.200 --> 02:58:20.200]  A group of experts in the U.S. federal deficit on Wednesday called for a 2011 social security tax holiday,
[02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:24.200]  a soft drink tax, and government spending freezes.
[02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:27.200]  Oh, see, oh, we're going to give you a little tax cut on the income tax,
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:30.200]  but start up a parallel sales tax.
[02:58:30.200 --> 02:58:32.200]  How many years have I told you?
[02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:36.200]  Over a decade, they're going to have an income tax and a sales tax.
[02:58:36.200 --> 02:58:37.200]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:37.200 --> 02:58:39.200]  Retransmission starts now with key info.
[02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:40.200]  See you back live tomorrow 11 a.m.
