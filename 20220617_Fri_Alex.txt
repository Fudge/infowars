[00:00.000 --> 00:16.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.880 --> 00:24.400]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones and now your
[00:24.400 --> 00:30.480]  host Owen Troyer well Anthony Fauci promised you if you got the vaccine
[00:30.480 --> 00:33.960]  you'd be protected from COVID you wouldn't get COVID he said that well
[00:33.960 --> 00:41.320]  now four times injected with the clot shot he claims Fauci has COVID but he
[00:41.320 --> 00:46.920]  seems to be well enough to at least show up for a hearing a congressional hearing
[00:46.920 --> 00:51.800]  even though he is remote and Rand Paul was giving him the what for on why
[00:51.800 --> 00:56.120]  they're trying to force children to take this deadly vaccine here's how that
[00:56.120 --> 01:01.200]  went are you aware of any studies that show reduction in hospitalization or
[01:01.200 --> 01:07.400]  death for children who take a booster right now there's not enough data that
[01:07.400 --> 01:12.360]  has been accumulated senator Paul to indicate that that's the case the I
[01:12.360 --> 01:17.840]  believe that the recommendation that was made was based on the assumption that
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.080]  if you look at the morbidity and mortality of children within each of the age
[01:23.080 --> 01:29.000]  groups you know zero to five five to eleven so there are no studies and
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.720]  Americans should all know this there are no studies on children showing a
[01:34.720 --> 01:39.680]  reduction in hospitalization or death with taking a booster the only studies
[01:39.680 --> 01:44.240]  that were permitted the only studies that were presented were antibody studies
[01:44.240 --> 01:49.720]  so they say if we give you a booster you make antibodies now a lot of scientists
[01:49.720 --> 01:54.320]  would question whether or not that's proof of efficacy of a vaccine if I give
[01:54.320 --> 02:00.280]  you ten or if I give a patient ten mRNA vaccines and they make protein each
[02:00.280 --> 02:04.040]  time or they make antibody each time is that proof that we should give ten
[02:04.040 --> 02:09.640]  boosters dr. Fauci no that I think that is somewhat of an absurd
[02:09.640 --> 02:14.800]  exaggeration so that is the proof that you use your committees use that that's
[02:14.800 --> 02:18.200]  the only proof you have to tell children to take a booster is that they make
[02:18.200 --> 02:22.880]  antibodies so it's not an absurdity you're already at like five boosters for
[02:22.880 --> 02:28.240]  people you've had you know two or three boosters it's like where is the proof now
[02:28.240 --> 02:31.600]  I think there is probably some indication for older folks that have some
[02:31.600 --> 02:36.040]  risk factors for younger folks there's not but here's the other thing there are
[02:36.040 --> 02:41.280]  some risk factors for the vaccine so the risk of myocarditis with a second
[02:41.280 --> 02:46.600]  dose for adolescent boys 12 to 24 is about 80 and a million this is both from
[02:46.600 --> 02:51.520]  the CDC and from the Israeli study it's also in the various study remarkably
[02:51.520 --> 02:55.560]  similar for boys much higher from boys than girls and much higher than the
[02:55.560 --> 03:00.800]  background the background is about two per million so there is risk and there
[03:00.800 --> 03:04.920]  are risk and you're telling everybody in America just blindly go out there because
[03:04.920 --> 03:10.240]  we made antibodies so it is not an absurd corollary to save you 10 in fact
[03:10.240 --> 03:15.360]  you probably make antibodies if you get a hundred boosters all right that's not
[03:15.360 --> 03:21.360]  science that's conjecture and we should not be making public policy on it so
[03:21.360 --> 03:27.480]  senator poll if I might respond to that we just heard in his opening statement
[03:27.480 --> 03:33.960]  ranking member Burr talk about his staff who went to Israel and if you look at the
[03:33.960 --> 03:38.960]  data from Israel for the boosts both the third shot boost and the fourth shot
[03:38.960 --> 03:44.400]  boost was associated with a clear-cut clinical effect mostly in elderly
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.680]  people but also as they gathered more data even in people in the 40s and the
[03:49.680 --> 03:56.280]  50s so there is clinical data but not in children well we'll see here's the
[03:56.280 --> 03:59.760]  thing is you're not willing to be honest with the American people so for
[03:59.760 --> 04:05.680]  example 75% of kids have had the disease why is the CDC not including this in the
[04:05.680 --> 04:09.960]  data you can ask the question you can do laboratory tests to find out who's had
[04:09.960 --> 04:14.600]  it and who hasn't had the disease what is the incidence of hospitalization and
[04:14.600 --> 04:19.360]  death for children who've been infected with COVID subsequently going to the
[04:19.360 --> 04:23.440]  hospital or dying what what is the possibility if your kid has had COVID
[04:23.440 --> 04:27.600]  which is 75% of the country's head COVID what is the chance that my child's
[04:27.600 --> 04:32.040]  going to the hospital or dying if you look at the number of deaths in
[04:32.040 --> 04:36.720]  pediatrics senator they have gone up since the vaccine okay we're gonna have
[04:36.720 --> 04:42.320]  more from Rand Paul and Anthony Fauci coming up later in the transmission but
[04:42.320 --> 04:47.700]  you know what's really pathetic that we're still talking about COVID like at
[04:47.700 --> 04:51.000]  some sort of a massive health threat the only discussion we should be having
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.160]  about COVID is why it was made in a lab and why those that made it aren't in
[04:55.160 --> 04:59.960]  jail right now that's what we should be asking Fauci
[05:00.200 --> 05:05.880]  the internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right
[05:05.880 --> 05:09.400]  people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually very sick
[05:09.400 --> 05:15.000]  feeling because I knew this was coming I tried to stop it and now everything I've
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.040]  talked about is gonna become more important than ever because the
[05:19.040 --> 05:24.280]  globalist aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents it's now
[05:24.280 --> 05:29.760]  out in the open Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth the
[05:29.760 --> 05:35.240]  Bilderberg group founded Davos group so now the fight's out in the open they're
[05:35.240 --> 05:38.520]  making their move because they know they're behind schedule we're gonna
[05:38.520 --> 05:41.960]  win this thing God's watching the children counting on us I just want to
[05:41.960 --> 05:45.160]  thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your
[05:45.160 --> 05:48.960]  financial support because without you info wars would not be here so I want you
[05:48.960 --> 05:53.360]  to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason
[05:53.360 --> 05:57.200]  humanity has a fighting chance so I want to thank you and salute you again for
[05:57.200 --> 06:02.160]  all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts
[06:06.160 --> 06:12.440]  there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones for example
[06:12.440 --> 06:23.360]  so
[06:25.360 --> 06:28.480]  Alex Jones
[06:34.860 --> 06:39.040]  it comes to mind
[06:39.040 --> 06:51.040]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[06:51.040 --> 06:57.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have found it the heart of the resistance to the New World Order,
[06:57.800 --> 07:04.880]  the heart of the resistance to global government and tyranny. And it's right here on the Alex
[07:04.880 --> 07:14.560]  Jones Show at infowars.com and band.video on this Friday, June 17, 2022 live transmission.
[07:14.560 --> 07:18.680]  Oh, and Shroyer is still at the desk for Alex today. We may be hearing from Alex before
[07:18.680 --> 07:25.800]  the transmission is complete. We are expecting Alex to be back this weekend. He may be hosting
[07:25.800 --> 07:33.840]  Sunday, but certainly he will be back next week, filling his host duties as he has for
[07:33.840 --> 07:41.200]  decades here on the Alex Jones Show. So one more day of me here. It's an honor and a privilege
[07:41.200 --> 07:46.880]  to be here with you today. And I've got a loaded news desk and about 15 video clips
[07:46.880 --> 07:52.640]  here in front of me. Let's see what we have. We've got some news from the White House. It's
[07:52.640 --> 07:59.720]  not good. Biden is really a complete embarrassment. So badly embarrassing, the Democrat Party
[07:59.720 --> 08:05.560]  now that they won't even endorse him for 2024. Of course, when Biden comes out and says,
[08:05.560 --> 08:15.840]  oh, I'm running in 2024, that's just conjecture to continue propping himself up as a legitimate
[08:15.840 --> 08:21.240]  president, which he is not. Oh, of course I'm running. I'm so legitimate. 81 million votes.
[08:21.240 --> 08:32.360]  Yeah. No. That's ridiculous. But no one will endorse him. Big leftist publications are
[08:32.360 --> 08:37.680]  basically urging him not to run. But that's really not even the issue. The issue is the
[08:37.680 --> 08:43.480]  economic devastation. And then what is Joe Biden doing about that? He's signing executive
[08:43.480 --> 08:50.200]  orders to make sure American children are gay. That's what Biden is concerned about
[08:50.200 --> 08:56.520]  today. We need more gay children. And we need to make sure that pedophiles have access to
[08:56.520 --> 09:04.160]  those kids because of diversity. So it's just ridiculous what's coming out of the White
[09:04.160 --> 09:10.360]  House today. But you have CEOs and others that are finally starting to push back publicly
[09:10.360 --> 09:15.520]  against this administration saying, hey, look, no, you caused the inflation. Let's be clear
[09:15.520 --> 09:22.480]  here. This has nothing to do with corporate greed, nothing to do with big oil. And so
[09:22.480 --> 09:25.760]  now you have CEOs and other heads of the companies coming out and saying, look, this
[09:25.760 --> 09:32.040]  is Biden causing this disastrous economy. Don't put this on us. We really, I mean, most
[09:32.040 --> 09:35.920]  of these big, yeah, a lot of people made a lot of money during the fake pandemic, but
[09:35.920 --> 09:41.680]  also a lot of people haven't really recovered. A lot of industries took hits, still reeling
[09:41.680 --> 09:47.640]  from it. And so then Biden comes out and points the finger. Democrats come out and point
[09:47.640 --> 09:50.920]  the finger, say, big corporate greed. Well, they're finally standing up for themselves
[09:50.920 --> 09:55.760]  saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is Biden economic policy. This is Democrat economic
[09:55.760 --> 10:03.440]  policy, not corporate greed. But he's signing bills, making sure kids are gay. So you've
[10:03.440 --> 10:08.960]  got that going on. So we'll have that news out of the White House. I do have some news
[10:08.960 --> 10:18.720]  regarding more geopolitical developments with Ukraine and then now Syria back onto the map
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.560]  as an issue. And it looks like China is going to be going into Taiwan. And it looks like
[10:24.560 --> 10:33.400]  that situation may be coming to the fore this summer. So we'll have some updates on that.
[10:33.400 --> 10:44.920]  A fake news fact checker just had to resign because after the USA Today audited her stories.
[10:44.920 --> 10:52.040]  Boy, it's so funny. They give infowars all this crap. And I won't go too deep into this
[10:52.040 --> 10:59.360]  rabbit hole, but let's just say we have people constantly questioning our editorial standards.
[10:59.360 --> 11:07.680]  And we have to make these arguments in court. But then the USA Today has a fact checker that
[11:07.680 --> 11:14.040]  had 23 articles that she completely made up, completely fabricated. And then they do a
[11:14.040 --> 11:18.800]  quote unquote audit of the stories. And it turns out they find out, yes, indeed, all
[11:18.800 --> 11:24.120]  of her sources were fake and her stories were fake. And this was a liberal fact checker who
[11:24.120 --> 11:34.840]  wrote fake stories. I thought the USA Today would have higher standards. They audit the
[11:34.840 --> 11:39.320]  story after they publish it. Well, whatever, I'm not here to criticize whatever editorial
[11:39.320 --> 11:47.240]  standards the USA Today has, but fact checker, fake news, it's another one. It's pretty standard
[11:47.240 --> 11:51.480]  now par for the course. These these fact checkers end up being the biggest liars you've ever
[11:51.480 --> 12:04.520]  heard of. Then we've got some developments on the J6 January 6 narrative and legal defense
[12:04.520 --> 12:11.720]  that is ongoing. So we'll have those updates for you today. I cannot get over what the
[12:11.720 --> 12:17.600]  Democrats are trying to do right now infringing on our Second Amendment. It's total treason.
[12:17.600 --> 12:25.080]  But aside from the treasonous aspect of what they're doing, the I don't even know what
[12:25.080 --> 12:32.960]  you would call it. I mean, double standard, logical inconsistencies, incongruities. It's
[12:32.960 --> 12:37.520]  impossible for someone to actually believe all the things liberals claim to believe.
[12:37.520 --> 12:46.960]  It is impossible. It has contradictory logic built into it. It cannot exist. So I just
[12:46.960 --> 12:51.520]  I've got more stories here what the Democrats are doing to violate your Second Amendment
[12:51.520 --> 12:57.120]  rights. And it's nothing will stop the next school shooter, by the way, everything that
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.520]  they're doing and proposing is not going to do a damn thing about stopping a school shooter.
[13:01.520 --> 13:08.280]  But they're still doing that. So we'll have that. We're going to have more from Rand Paul
[13:08.280 --> 13:15.800]  and Anthony Fauci as well as some other COVID and vaccine news that I have in front of my
[13:15.800 --> 13:26.280]  desk. We have some other election news. Have you been flying lately? You've probably seen
[13:26.280 --> 13:33.160]  or heard what a miserable experience flying is now. That's just more a sign of where the
[13:33.160 --> 13:39.160]  country is at falling apart at the seams, total cultural decay, societal decay, civilizational
[13:39.160 --> 13:46.520]  decay. And it can almost all be traced back to big government and liberalism and Democrat
[13:46.520 --> 13:55.240]  policy. Then you had an interesting story. Inmate planned to strangle Elaine Maxwell
[13:55.240 --> 14:05.360]  in her sleep at Brooklyn Federal Jail, according to her lawyer. So they wanted to Epstein Maxwell.
[14:05.360 --> 14:13.960]  They tried to Epstein Maxwell. And now the lawyer or the prosecution is trying to figure
[14:13.960 --> 14:23.280]  out who paid the woman or who offered to pay the woman. So that story is developing. Pretty
[14:23.280 --> 14:29.800]  interesting. Pretty interesting. Kind of just memory hold the whole Epstein thing. You know,
[14:29.800 --> 14:33.600]  the mainstream media, they're all friends with Epstein and they're all friends with
[14:33.600 --> 14:42.720]  the Clintons and the Democrats that used Epstein to hire sex workers and sex slaves. So ABC
[14:42.720 --> 14:49.680]  News execs and others made sure to never report on the Epstein story, never report on the
[14:49.680 --> 14:57.280]  Maxwell story because it would hurt the Democrats, it would hurt the Clintons and it would hurt
[14:57.280 --> 15:02.400]  themselves that we're all using Jeffrey Epstein sex slaves and his islands for whatever the
[15:02.400 --> 15:09.760]  hell they're into. So they tried to kill Maxwell too. Is anybody really surprised by that?
[15:09.760 --> 15:15.200]  Probably not so much. And then we have other clips here from some of our corrupt politicians
[15:15.200 --> 15:26.640]  like Gavin Newsom and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Oh, guys. Oh my gosh. Folks, what they're
[15:26.640 --> 15:36.160]  doing at the gay drag queen for kids events now is getting so ridiculous where I mean,
[15:36.160 --> 15:41.760]  we can't even show the videos technically because they're just running around naked in
[15:41.760 --> 15:50.240]  front of children now. And I mean, I can't put that on TV, but they're dancing around
[15:50.240 --> 15:56.800]  naked for the kids showing them breasts and genitals, but I can't even show it on TV.
[15:59.360 --> 16:03.760]  There's an old bed of one saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this.
[16:04.480 --> 16:10.080]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel. Hunter S. Thompson put it this way, pray to God,
[16:10.080 --> 16:14.560]  but roll away from the rocks. If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you
[16:14.560 --> 16:19.520]  don't get smashed on him and killed, but also try to roll away. You can't just sit there like a jellyfish
[16:19.520 --> 16:24.480]  and it's the same thing with our immune system. God helps those who help themselves. We have a lot

[18:59.040 --> 19:04.640]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that is now
[19:04.640 --> 19:10.560]  available at infowarstore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.440]  health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the pacific islands for its
[19:15.440 --> 19:21.760]  relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift
[19:21.760 --> 19:28.000]  by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[19:28.000 --> 19:33.360]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen
[19:33.360 --> 19:38.880]  up a little. Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[19:38.880 --> 19:44.560]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
[19:44.560 --> 19:51.120]  but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balarian
[19:51.120 --> 19:56.720]  root. We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting
[19:56.720 --> 20:07.040]  infowarstore.com. Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:18.560 --> 20:23.680]  Well, it's the final countdown, the final countdown for common sense and freedom in America,
[20:23.680 --> 20:30.160]  or the final countdown for global corporate government and world tyranny. Something has
[20:30.160 --> 20:36.320]  got to give. And you're tuned in to this transmission because you know it, and you want to be on the
[20:36.320 --> 20:43.280]  winning side of history, pro-human, pro-freedom, pro-truth. That's what we represent. And sadly,
[20:44.800 --> 20:51.680]  we are dealing with globalists and quote-unquote liberals who are really just radical communists
[20:51.680 --> 20:58.560]  and terrorists and degenerates trying to run our country into the ground. And boy, oh boy,
[20:58.560 --> 21:06.320]  is Joe Biden doing a fantastic job of it. Now, Joe Biden is such an embarrassment and such
[21:06.320 --> 21:11.600]  a letdown even. I don't know what the Democrats were expecting. It's odd though, because when I go
[21:11.600 --> 21:21.840]  back in time, we covered the Democrat debates. And if you recall at the time, Joe Biden was not
[21:21.840 --> 21:28.800]  winning. Joe Biden did not win a single debate. In fact, he was in the bottom. He was either
[21:28.800 --> 21:34.320]  dead last or in the bottom when they had like the 20 man debate or whatever that clown show.
[21:35.120 --> 21:40.800]  Joe Biden was either dead last or at the bottom of the heap in all polls when asked who won the
[21:40.800 --> 21:48.400]  Democrat debates. And the funny thing is, the people that were believed to have won the debates
[21:48.400 --> 21:54.000]  are the ones that ended up getting ousted from the debate process and the primaries. Isn't that
[21:54.000 --> 22:02.560]  something? Tulsi Gabbard, even Marianne Williamson was a little popular, but they didn't let those
[22:02.560 --> 22:07.440]  two ladies show up to the next debates. They were a little too popular. So that's just Democrats
[22:07.440 --> 22:11.600]  rigging their primary process as they always do. They rigged it for Biden, just like they rigged
[22:11.600 --> 22:17.680]  it for Hillary. Bernie Sanders sits there and takes it like a cuck. But no, so Biden has been such
[22:17.680 --> 22:26.800]  an embarrassment. Now you have every Democrat member of the Senate was asked to endorse Biden
[22:26.800 --> 22:34.400]  for president in 2024. Only five endorsed him. I think 51 Democrat senators, so five out of 51.
[22:34.400 --> 22:40.960]  So only 10% of the Senate Democrats would endorse Joe Biden in 2024.
[22:42.880 --> 22:47.760]  And of course, House Democrats like AOC and others in the squad would not endorse Biden.
[22:48.880 --> 22:53.920]  And the Atlantic has just published the headline Biden too old to run in 2024.
[22:53.920 --> 22:59.280]  Well, yeah, he was, it's not even about age per se. It's about he's not there. His brain is broke.
[22:59.280 --> 23:06.480]  He's an old corrupt politician from a, from an era long gone. He's a racist,
[23:08.320 --> 23:15.760]  but oh, the Democrats forced him into the presidential race and then stole it from
[23:15.760 --> 23:19.840]  Trump. And now we're dealing with it. And now even Democrats are saying, this guy's so bad,
[23:19.840 --> 23:24.640]  I'm not going to endorse him in 2024. And the real question is why would Biden even come out
[23:24.640 --> 23:32.560]  and say, I'm running in 2024? And the answer is to cover his own ass because he's been such an
[23:32.560 --> 23:37.680]  unmitigated disaster for him to say, I'm not running again, would just add to the proof of
[23:37.680 --> 23:42.880]  that. So he pretends like he's being as has a success story as a president. Oh, I got to run
[23:42.880 --> 23:50.400]  again. Absolutely. No. Biden stares blankly at reporter asking why he hasn't sanctioned
[23:50.400 --> 23:56.960]  Russian oligarch who wired Hunter Biden millions of dollars. Yeah, we all know why, but it's funny
[23:57.920 --> 24:00.800]  because he had one of those old man moments, if you will,
[24:02.480 --> 24:07.440]  where he gets caught off guard by a reporter asking a question and he just loses it.
[24:08.640 --> 24:11.360]  He just kind of like, he's just gone like he forgets where he's at.
[24:12.240 --> 24:16.480]  We had a couple of those moments with Hillary Clinton, or she was like having seizures or
[24:16.480 --> 24:22.400]  something. Remember that with the media there and then on the DNC platform. And so now Biden is
[24:22.400 --> 24:29.760]  experiencing the same thing. It's really sad how Democrats can't see how their party is just
[24:29.760 --> 24:35.200]  recycling the biggest criminals in US political history as their leaders like Clinton and Biden.
[24:37.200 --> 24:42.400]  But yeah, he gets lost in the press conference and he just stares blankly at reporters because
[24:42.400 --> 24:47.280]  he forgets where he is. And then the same thing we've seen so many times,
[24:49.520 --> 24:55.360]  his little workers there, those females that love telling people what to do, those Karens,
[24:55.360 --> 24:58.560]  the White House Karens come in. Okay, time to go, time to go, time to leave, time to leave,
[24:58.560 --> 25:02.240]  no more questions, no more questions, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go. And they shuffle all the
[25:02.240 --> 25:06.320]  reporters out of there. Biden doesn't have to answer a single question. And they just love it,
[25:06.320 --> 25:11.360]  those Karens, the White House Karens. They just love telling everybody what to do. But Biden asked
[25:11.360 --> 25:15.600]  about the Russian oligarch that gave his family millions of dollars and he forgot where he was
[25:15.600 --> 25:24.560]  at suddenly. Biden announces sweeping executive order to advanced radical LGBTQI plus, he actually
[25:24.560 --> 25:32.320]  called it LGBTQL. So he got a little confused, we all are confused. But he wants the kids to be gay.
[25:32.320 --> 25:36.800]  He bans conversion therapy, which now includes suggesting that a child should not undergo
[25:36.800 --> 25:41.440]  medical transition. So basically, if you're a kid, if you have a boy that comes up and is wearing
[25:41.440 --> 25:46.800]  a dress and says, mommy, I'm a girl now, I mean, I don't really understand how you even make this
[25:46.800 --> 25:53.040]  an executive order. I mean, what are you proposing? So if the parent refuses to let a seven-year-old
[25:53.040 --> 25:56.800]  have gender reassignment surgery, or if a parent refuses to let a seven-year-old have
[25:56.800 --> 26:01.680]  puberty blockers, or if a parent refuses to let their seven-year-old boy be a girl,
[26:01.680 --> 26:09.120]  is that a crime now? I mean, what is the, it's all just, it's all just leftist gay activism
[26:09.120 --> 26:17.440]  from the White House in an executive order. That's all it is. Aside from the absolute atrocity that
[26:17.440 --> 26:25.120]  it is, how can, how can a president write an executive order saying, parents, you have to
[26:25.120 --> 26:33.920]  teach your kids how to be gay. And if you don't, what? What, Joe? What if a parent doesn't want
[26:33.920 --> 26:38.480]  to give their kid puberty blockers? What if a parent doesn't want to chop their kids' gender
[26:38.480 --> 26:43.200]  littles up? What? Are you going to arrest them? Are you going to have the government take the
[26:43.200 --> 26:48.000]  kids from them? What are you going to do? Because eventually they're going to have to answer that
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.880]  question. How do you sign executive orders and have a color of law that's a rainbow flag,
[26:52.880 --> 26:58.960]  color of law that says, oh, parents that don't want to chop up their kids' genitals are going to be
[26:58.960 --> 27:06.000]  arrested now? I mean, you know that's where it goes, right? I don't see where else this thing goes.
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.240]  It's not like it stops at this executive order. They're never going to stop. And by the way,
[27:12.240 --> 27:17.520]  you know, we'll come up and we'll play these videos later. Folks, they, drag queen story time for
[27:17.520 --> 27:24.240]  kids is like child's play compared to what they do now. I've got videos of drag queens running
[27:24.240 --> 27:32.640]  around with inflatable penises, dildos that they run up to kids with, with like a two foot penis
[27:32.640 --> 27:40.960]  inflatable. They walk around with like these fake double D breasts that they go literally rub in
[27:40.960 --> 27:48.240]  children's faces. I have the video of this. They flash genitals to children, men showing children
[27:48.800 --> 27:57.920]  their male members. But okay. I guess that's the issue. I guess that's the big issue for Biden.
[27:58.560 --> 28:03.600]  I guess that's the big issue for liberals is making sure that children are exposed to pedophiles
[28:03.600 --> 28:13.040]  and sexual deviance. I mean, these people should be considered predators and on a watch list,
[28:13.840 --> 28:19.040]  on a neighborhood watch list for what they're doing. So then I have to debate, okay, I've got,
[28:19.040 --> 28:24.240]  I've got videos and pictures of grown men at gay pride parade events for kids
[28:25.120 --> 28:30.960]  running around with, with big inflatable penises that they, that they flash and show children.
[28:30.960 --> 28:36.560]  I've got men dancing with fake breasts that they rub in children's faces. I've got men dancing for
[28:36.560 --> 28:44.160]  children showing them their penis and testicles. But it's gay pride. It's liberal. And Biden signs
[28:44.160 --> 28:51.840]  the executive order saying, if you don't like it, what Joe, if you don't show your kids a gay
[28:51.840 --> 28:57.280]  pedophile penis, if you don't show your kids and let them chop up their genitals, what Joe, you're
[28:57.280 --> 29:03.200]  going to arrest us? Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months, we've witnessed the globalist

[33:23.200 --> 33:33.200]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones. And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[33:34.400 --> 33:37.840]  So while Biden is trying to turn the country into a bunch of homos and pedophiles like
[33:37.840 --> 33:42.160]  he and Barack Obama, I guess, I don't know. I don't know what's motivating that factor, but
[33:42.160 --> 33:50.960]  seems to be the big push now. The economy is totally collapsing. It's not good folks. And finally,
[33:50.960 --> 34:04.960]  CEOs and people are actually saying, hey, look, you Democrats, you liberals can try to play the blame game here like you've done for years blaming us, blaming corporate greed, but you know what, we're not taking it anymore. It's you.
[34:04.960 --> 34:18.960]  Exxon Mobile fires back at Biden after he accuses oil companies of profiteering in letter. More oil industry heads blast Joe Biden for threats and blame over energy crisis.
[34:18.960 --> 34:28.960]  Following on your campaign promise to end fossil fuel, consider just some of the policy and investment signals being sent to the market about our refining industry.
[34:28.960 --> 34:44.960]  So again, it's the same issue where liberals are just idiots, but it's the same issue where Joe Biden campaigns and he says we're going to end fossil fuels. He walks right up to a little girl and grabs her.
[34:44.960 --> 34:54.960]  Remember, he did that in the campaign about five or six times, walks up to little girls and grabs them. Some of them invites backstage with them afterwards like it's a, you know, a group at a concert or something, little five year old girls, 12 year old girls.
[34:54.960 --> 35:04.960]  And that's Joe Biden. And so he says, we're going to end fossil fuels and we're going to stop drilling. And then he does just that.
[35:04.960 --> 35:16.960]  And then when your gas prices reach record highs and then when your energy prices skyrocket, he points the finger and blame it everybody else, even though that's what he did.
[35:16.960 --> 35:29.960]  That's what he promised he do. I mean, and only liberals buy this crap. That's what's so frustrating is if we didn't have these brainwashed morons running around believing all this crap, they wouldn't get away with it.
[35:29.960 --> 35:48.960]  But I mean, they believe it. They actually believe what Joe Biden says. I don't know if there's ever been a bigger case of mass psychosis and mass brainwashing in human history.
[35:48.960 --> 35:59.960]  I mean, is it going to reach James Jones levels? I mean, if Joe Biden tells you to drink the Kool-Aid and, you know, you drink it and you collapse. Oh, that's right. The vaccine is killing people. So I guess they did do that already.
[35:59.960 --> 36:09.960]  But I digress. The Democrats run on ending fossil fuels and they continue to say, we're in a transition. It's just a transition.
[36:09.960 --> 36:19.960]  By the way, they don't tell you what the green energies are that they're going to use to replace natural gas or coal because they don't exist.
[36:19.960 --> 36:29.960]  We have solar. We don't really either just not effective or we don't use it effectively. I'll be willing to hear either side of that, but it doesn't work.
[36:29.960 --> 36:35.960]  It's not working for us. It's not the answer. We've got windmills. Those have been a complete disaster.
[36:35.960 --> 36:44.960]  I think those are probably more harm than good. So, okay, we're going to shut off oil and we're going to shut off coal.
[36:44.960 --> 36:50.960]  Oh, what are you going to replace it with? We don't know. It's transition.
[36:50.960 --> 37:00.960]  And then they say, but we believe this transition will have good paying jobs. What jobs? There are no jobs. There is no answer.
[37:00.960 --> 37:07.960]  You're costing people their livelihood. You're taking away jobs.
[37:07.960 --> 37:19.960]  I mean, there's a story alone in just people that from 2016 to 2019, oil companies were hiring people.
[37:19.960 --> 37:30.960]  Sometimes that starting wages of $100,000 a year on a salary, $100,000 a year to go work in pipelines and oil fields and all this other stuff.
[37:30.960 --> 37:36.960]  And it was a huge economic boom. And that all just got wiped out by Joe Biden.
[37:36.960 --> 37:42.960]  And he says, I want to give you high paying jobs. I want to give you good high paying jobs as his first day in office.
[37:42.960 --> 37:52.960]  He eliminated about 10,000 good high paying jobs, people making 80,000 up a year in the energy sector that he shut down.
[37:52.960 --> 37:59.960]  So, yeah, you can say gas company CEOs or whatever have corporate greed.
[37:59.960 --> 38:02.960]  Okay, fine. Whatever. They're not the ones doing this.
[38:02.960 --> 38:11.960]  Biden is. Democrats are. And to deny that is just to deny reality.
[38:11.960 --> 38:17.960]  Wall Street Journal. Recession fears surge among CEOs.
[38:17.960 --> 38:21.960]  We need to prepare for tough times ahead.
[38:21.960 --> 38:29.960]  So the CEO of Solvay, Ilham Khadri, Brussels based chemical maker.
[38:29.960 --> 38:31.960]  And it's just got all these different CEOs in there.
[38:31.960 --> 38:35.960]  And yeah, I mean, so it's like the economy is collapsing.
[38:35.960 --> 38:40.960]  Biden is blaming these CEOs and they're saying it's not us.
[38:40.960 --> 38:42.960]  Why would we want the economy to collapse?
[38:42.960 --> 38:45.960]  If we have corporate greed, we want to make more money.
[38:45.960 --> 38:51.960]  Why would us making less money be something we want if we're greedy?
[38:51.960 --> 38:55.960]  Well, what is Biden up to as he tanks the economy anyway?
[38:55.960 --> 38:59.960]  Biden administration. Oh, well, he's making the kids gay, but let's not forget about this one.
[38:59.960 --> 39:07.960]  Biden administration to spend $14 million a year rebuilding Mozambique province.
[39:07.960 --> 39:12.960]  Yes, you guys planning on anybody taking a trip to know Mozambique?
[39:12.960 --> 39:16.960]  Yeah, Mozambique trip. Anybody? Anybody want to hop on a plane head on over to Mozambique?
[39:16.960 --> 39:19.960]  You might be able to find some clean water.
[39:19.960 --> 39:22.960]  14 million a year rebuilding Mozambique province.
[39:22.960 --> 39:30.960]  You know, that'd be nice if we were doing really, really well here and we could afford maybe something like that, but we can't.
[39:30.960 --> 39:33.960]  You have any you think any of this money is going to get stolen, by the way?
[39:33.960 --> 39:50.960]  The administration of the U.S. President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday plans to provide $14 million annually over the next decade to the Mozambique province of Cabo Delgado in an effort to rebuild the region after it was overrun by Islamic terrorists in recent months.
[39:50.960 --> 39:57.960]  Oh boy. The state run Mozambique news agency reported how much of that money is going to get stolen.
[39:57.960 --> 40:05.960]  What percentage of that cut is for the big guy? 14 million to Mozambique a year for the next 10 years.
[40:05.960 --> 40:09.960]  That's 140 million for Mozambique. Have you been to New York City lately? It's a shithole.
[40:09.960 --> 40:17.960]  But hey, let's build Mozambique. You going to be going to Mozambique anytime soon?
[40:17.960 --> 40:27.960]  I'm going to go play radical Jihad in Mozambique. 140 million promised by the Biden administration of Mozambique. Hey, that's great. More humanitarian aid.
[40:27.960 --> 40:40.960]  The U.S. giving all of its money away to foreign countries. Most of that's probably just going to get stolen because all the countries we get foreign aid to never seem to get better.
[40:40.960 --> 40:44.960]  They actually get worse. Have you noticed that?
[40:44.960 --> 40:49.960]  The countries where we send foreign aid actually get worse after we send them the aid.
[40:49.960 --> 40:55.960]  Just look at Central America. Look at Haiti and now probably Mozambique.
[40:55.960 --> 41:06.960]  If it's really overrun by radical Islamic terrorists or maybe it's a CIA front group, where do you think that money is going to go, folks?
[41:06.960 --> 41:10.960]  What do you think is going to happen in Mozambique with that money?
[41:10.960 --> 41:15.960]  Give me a break.
[41:15.960 --> 41:22.960]  Another 100 billion for Ukraine, too. You know.
[41:22.960 --> 41:29.960]  You're working five jobs to keep a roof over your head and gas in your car and food on the table.
[41:29.960 --> 41:32.960]  Biden can sign checks to foreign countries at will.
[41:32.960 --> 41:40.960]  Stock market fall has wiped out $3 trillion in retirement savings this year. Thanks, Biden. How's your 401K doing, guys?
[41:40.960 --> 41:48.960]  Yeah. Now, a lot of this is kind of like, it was so good under Trump, that's almost...
[41:48.960 --> 41:55.960]  So, really, the reason it's so bad is because it was so good under Trump with retirement savings, 401Ks, stocks.
[41:55.960 --> 42:02.960]  Everybody was going gangbusters under Trump, so now that it's so bad, it looks even worse because it was so good before.
[42:02.960 --> 42:05.960]  The juxtaposition there is pretty incredible.
[42:05.960 --> 42:14.960]  Cost of finance, a new car, hits a record 656 per month, and auto shoppers could pay even more with latest Fed rate hike.
[42:14.960 --> 42:18.960]  How you guys liking Democrats in power? How you guys enjoying that?
[42:18.960 --> 42:23.960]  Fed promises unconditional approach to taking down inflation in report to Congress.
[42:23.960 --> 42:27.960]  Oh, unconditional approach. So how long you think they would need here, guys?
[42:27.960 --> 42:33.960]  They're promising a full-fledged effort to end inflation, which first they said doesn't exist, doesn't exist.
[42:33.960 --> 42:37.960]  Oh, okay, now they're going to have a full-fledged effort. How long you think they need?
[42:37.960 --> 42:44.960]  Three months, six months a year? Because I bet you, in three months or in six months or in a year,
[42:44.960 --> 42:49.960]  inflation ain't going down, folks. It's only going up.
[42:49.960 --> 42:55.960]  And then Biden says to the press, he says, no, we're not in a recession. A recession is not inevitable.
[42:55.960 --> 42:58.960]  What? We're in it right now.
[42:58.960 --> 43:04.960]  The Internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[43:04.960 --> 43:10.960]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[43:10.960 --> 43:16.960]  I tried to stop it, and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever
[43:16.960 --> 43:21.960]  because the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[43:21.960 --> 43:29.960]  It's now out in the open. Claus Schwab said last week that they rule the Earth, the Bilderberg Group founded Davos Group.
[43:29.960 --> 43:36.960]  So now the fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[43:36.960 --> 43:39.960]  We're going to win this thing. God's watching the children counting on us.
[43:39.960 --> 43:43.960]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support
[43:43.960 --> 43:46.960]  because without you, info wars would not be here.
[43:46.960 --> 43:49.960]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war
[43:49.960 --> 43:52.960]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[43:52.960 --> 44:17.960]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.

[46:04.960 --> 46:09.960]  Just like you, no matter what color you are, whether you're a man or a woman,
[46:09.960 --> 46:14.960]  you were made by the creator of the universe who had a plan for you, who has a destiny for you.
[46:14.960 --> 46:18.960]  That's why the system hates you and fears you and that's why they hate me.
[46:18.960 --> 46:25.960]  It's because the spirit I carry is one of justice and truth and courage and honor and will and love.
[46:25.960 --> 46:30.960]  My friends, the enemy's coming after me, not because I'm a loser, but because I'm a winner.
[46:30.960 --> 46:35.960]  They're coming after you, not because you're a bad person, because you're a good person,
[46:35.960 --> 46:38.960]  because you love God and God loves you.
[46:38.960 --> 46:43.960]  And so I signed up for this, I signed up for this fight and I'm not a victim, I'm an overcomer.
[46:43.960 --> 46:48.960]  But I can't fight this fight without you and that's why I want you to always remember that I appreciate you
[46:48.960 --> 46:53.960]  and I thank you because infowar is your fight, infowar is your baby, it's the thing you built.
[46:53.960 --> 46:59.960]  We did this together, so God bless you all. Let's keep fighting.
[46:59.960 --> 47:06.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:29.960 --> 47:42.960]  Boy, don't you wish you could just go out into the woods or do a lake somewhere, a mountain.
[47:42.960 --> 47:50.960]  Just sit down, turn on some country music and just enjoy the beautiful splendor of God's creation
[47:50.960 --> 47:57.960]  without having to deal with these damn demons trying to ruin it. That'd be nice.
[47:57.960 --> 48:06.960]  We can hope, we can dream and we can try to build that future that we all want to see.
[48:06.960 --> 48:13.960]  But we've got some things in our way, if you know what I mean. We've got some things in our way.
[48:13.960 --> 48:19.960]  Alright, let's take a look here at some of the latest developments on the January 6th front.
[48:19.960 --> 48:23.960]  Now this was big news breaking yesterday with Alex Jones and Pete Santilli.
[48:23.960 --> 48:27.960]  And I had some other people reach out and discuss this as well.
[48:27.960 --> 48:32.960]  January 6th Committee commits illegal acts that could end the entire persecution.
[48:32.960 --> 48:45.960]  Now, let me kind of just give you the backdrop here that, aside from the details, what needs to be understood.
[48:45.960 --> 48:54.960]  What the Democrats are doing with this January 6th Committee and hearing and even in a lot of these cases
[48:54.960 --> 49:02.960]  has never been seen or done before in American legal or justice history, never been done before.
[49:02.960 --> 49:10.960]  Holding people for nonviolent crimes and holding political prisoners pre-trial as long as they've done,
[49:10.960 --> 49:15.960]  never done before, never been done before. And I mean, it's straight up political prisoners,
[49:15.960 --> 49:20.960]  but aside from saying, hey, they're political prisoners, which is true,
[49:20.960 --> 49:29.960]  just the mere fact that they're holding these people pre-trial, a lot of them just for misdemeanors, is already unprecedented.
[49:29.960 --> 49:35.960]  And so what they're doing now, because they realize judges and lawyers are starting to look at this
[49:35.960 --> 49:41.960]  and realize what it really is, it's Democrat party political prisoners and persecution,
[49:41.960 --> 49:47.960]  and they're kind of starting to tilt their head a little bit and say, yeah, this is really not good
[49:47.960 --> 49:55.960]  and extremely dangerous still going on. So what the Democrats are doing now is they're trying to ramp up the charges
[49:55.960 --> 50:02.960]  and they're just inventing new charges. It's like you already have a case, you've already been indicted,
[50:02.960 --> 50:08.960]  and then the Democrats, they just give you a new charge, just out of the blue. That's never been done before,
[50:08.960 --> 50:16.960]  but that's not even the big one. For them, there's a lot of censorship going on here.
[50:16.960 --> 50:23.960]  For example, they won't release all of the January 6th footage that they have because it'll show Antifa going in first
[50:23.960 --> 50:28.960]  and it'll show how, aside from a couple dust-ups with cops that got bad
[50:28.960 --> 50:32.960]  and a couple people breaking windows or stealing property from inside,
[50:32.960 --> 50:36.960]  99% of the activity that day was innocent.
[50:36.960 --> 50:39.960]  And they don't want you to see that because they've been lying about it from the beginning.
[50:39.960 --> 50:45.960]  They don't want you to see the cops lobbing grenades into the crowds.
[50:45.960 --> 50:49.960]  They don't want you to see the cops waving people into the building.
[50:49.960 --> 50:52.960]  They don't want you to see the cops removing the barricades.
[50:52.960 --> 50:56.960]  They don't want you to see the cops opening the magnetic lock doors.
[50:56.960 --> 51:01.960]  They don't want you to see the cops actually having conversations with some of the people out there
[51:01.960 --> 51:07.960]  saying, all right, how can we do this? How can we maintain the peace? How can we do this the right way?
[51:07.960 --> 51:09.960]  So that's all unprecedented.
[51:09.960 --> 51:15.960]  And by the way, what's not unprecedented but what's going on behind the scenes,
[51:15.960 --> 51:19.960]  there's only so much I want to say here because obviously I've got my own legal case,
[51:19.960 --> 51:26.960]  but basically folks, I mean, discovery goes both ways. I'll just put it that way.
[51:26.960 --> 51:34.960]  But anything a January 6 defendant gets in discovery is not allowed to be shown to the public.
[51:34.960 --> 51:36.960]  I'll just leave it at that.
[51:36.960 --> 51:46.960]  So then they have these depositions that are totally illegitimate
[51:46.960 --> 51:49.960]  and these witness testimonies that are totally illegitimate.
[51:49.960 --> 51:53.960]  It's a kangaroo court. It's not even a real hearing
[51:53.960 --> 52:00.960]  because you don't have any defense or two sides presenting evidence or points.
[52:00.960 --> 52:06.960]  It's just one side and it's just a made for TV event that they're pretending is a real hearing.
[52:06.960 --> 52:11.960]  And so then you take deposition, you take witness deposition for eight hours,
[52:11.960 --> 52:18.960]  ten hours in some cases of these individuals and then you only make 30 seconds of it
[52:18.960 --> 52:25.960]  or a minute or two minutes of it available to the public, available to lawyers in the defense.
[52:25.960 --> 52:29.960]  Again, totally unprecedented, all illegal.
[52:29.960 --> 52:37.960]  So I think the judges that have been looking at this have just been kind of going along.
[52:37.960 --> 52:42.960]  Nobody wanted to be the judge to stick the neck out there and disrupt the Democrat Party agenda
[52:42.960 --> 52:44.960]  because they know what happens when you do it.
[52:44.960 --> 52:46.960]  They send terrorists to your house to kill you.
[52:46.960 --> 52:51.960]  So nobody wanted to disrupt the Democrat Party agenda at the risk of the Democrats sending a terrorist
[52:51.960 --> 52:53.960]  to your house to assassinate you.
[52:53.960 --> 52:59.960]  Just ask Steve Scalise about that or Rand Paul or Justice Kavanaugh.
[52:59.960 --> 53:02.960]  And so nobody wanted to be that judge. Nobody wanted to do that.
[53:02.960 --> 53:06.960]  So these things just went on and just got worse and it got worse and it got worse.
[53:06.960 --> 53:09.960]  And now, though, it's so bad.
[53:09.960 --> 53:14.960]  I think it's so bad now that judges and lawyers are sitting here saying,
[53:14.960 --> 53:22.960]  okay, this is, maybe we were in it to protect ourselves not wanting the Democrat terrorists to kill us
[53:22.960 --> 53:30.960]  and maybe we were just kind of going along saying, you know, in the belief that this is fair game that we're playing here
[53:30.960 --> 53:32.960]  and the Democrats are playing fairly.
[53:32.960 --> 53:34.960]  Well, that's all out the window now.
[53:34.960 --> 53:37.960]  Everyone knows the Democrats aren't playing fairly.
[53:37.960 --> 53:40.960]  Everyone knows this whole thing is a sham and a charade.
[53:40.960 --> 53:46.960]  But the Democrats still have their terrorists that they send to judges' houses to kill them.
[53:46.960 --> 53:49.960]  So there's a crutch there.
[53:49.960 --> 53:53.960]  But that was all broken down on the Alex Jones show with Pete Santilli yesterday
[53:53.960 --> 53:55.960]  and I think there's going to be a lot more coming out.
[53:55.960 --> 53:57.960]  Louis Gohmert put this out today.
[53:57.960 --> 53:58.960]  It's a sad time for America.
[53:58.960 --> 54:00.960]  One thing is very clear.
[54:00.960 --> 54:05.960]  Pre-trial confinement is never ever to be used for punishment and that's exactly what has happened.
[54:05.960 --> 54:13.960]  It's been used for intimidation, punishment and vengefulness from a D.C. jail that has enjoyed screwing over the J6 defendants.
[54:13.960 --> 54:21.960]  Louis Gohmert, one of the few speaking out against the political imprisonment of their opposition by the Democrats.
[54:21.960 --> 54:24.960]  And they just arrested Dr. Simone Gold.
[54:24.960 --> 54:26.960]  And here's the CNN headline.
[54:26.960 --> 54:30.960]  Dr. known for spreading COVID misinformation.
[54:30.960 --> 54:32.960]  Well, first of all, what does that have anything to do with this arrest?
[54:32.960 --> 54:36.960]  They just had to take a dig at her, you know.
[54:36.960 --> 54:38.960]  They just had to take a dig at her.
[54:38.960 --> 54:40.960]  Oh, COVID misinformation.
[54:40.960 --> 54:42.960]  They don't tell you any of the COVID misinformation, by the way,
[54:42.960 --> 54:44.960]  because everything she's reported on COVID has actually come true.
[54:44.960 --> 54:46.960]  All the misinformation was from Fauci.
[54:46.960 --> 54:48.960]  But okay, that's not the story.
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.960]  They've sentenced her to 60 days in jail
[54:53.960 --> 54:58.960]  and they've given her a $10,000 fine.
[54:58.960 --> 55:00.960]  And what did she do?
[55:00.960 --> 55:05.960]  She did go into the Capitol that day and at one point she was on a bullhorn.
[55:05.960 --> 55:09.960]  Now, if you had equal and fair punishment,
[55:09.960 --> 55:12.960]  Dr. Simone Gold would spend a day in jail,
[55:12.960 --> 55:16.960]  maybe, maybe, maybe a night, maybe a couple hours at Max
[55:16.960 --> 55:20.960]  and she'd get some community service and maybe some probation.
[55:20.960 --> 55:30.960]  And that's what should apply to whoever does political demonstrations in D.C.
[55:30.960 --> 55:33.960]  But no, what happens is if you're a liberal or a Democrat
[55:33.960 --> 55:35.960]  that does a political demonstration in D.C.
[55:35.960 --> 55:37.960]  or the Capitol or one of these congressional buildings,
[55:37.960 --> 55:39.960]  you get no punishment.
[55:39.960 --> 55:41.960]  You might get arrested and booked, but they'll release you.
[55:41.960 --> 55:42.960]  They'll drop the charges.
[55:42.960 --> 55:46.960]  It's what happens 90% of the time with the Democrat liberal activists.
[55:46.960 --> 55:51.960]  But if you're a conservative activist, they throw the book at you.
[55:51.960 --> 55:55.960]  You know that they wanted me, this case is still ongoing,
[55:55.960 --> 55:59.960]  they wanted to put me in jail for 90 days
[55:59.960 --> 56:02.960]  and ban me from Washington, D.C.
[56:02.960 --> 56:08.960]  for my 30-second interruption of Nadler's fake impeachment hearing.
[56:08.960 --> 56:12.960]  And the punishment was so aggressive that they were trying to get from me,
[56:12.960 --> 56:16.960]  they had to go through three different judges.
[56:16.960 --> 56:17.960]  It happened so long ago now, I can't remember.
[56:17.960 --> 56:19.960]  Three different judges, they kept having to switch judges
[56:19.960 --> 56:23.960]  because no judge was going to give a man 90 days in jail
[56:23.960 --> 56:30.960]  and ban him from D.C. for 30 seconds interruption of Jerry Nadler's fake impeachment hearing.
[56:30.960 --> 56:32.960]  And now they're ramping that back up against me.
[56:32.960 --> 56:35.960]  I'm not going to make the show against me, but let's just say,
[56:35.960 --> 56:40.960]  yeah, the Simone Gold treatment, they'd love something like that for me.
[56:40.960 --> 56:42.960]  So, oh, they just round up Simone Gold.
[56:42.960 --> 56:46.960]  Oh, they just round up this GOP candidate for Governor of Michigan.
[56:46.960 --> 56:47.960]  Oh, they're just throwing them in jail.
[56:47.960 --> 56:50.960]  I'm telling you, folks, I am telling you right now,
[56:50.960 --> 56:54.960]  the Democrats, if they still exist in 2050,
[56:54.960 --> 57:00.960]  Democrats will be arresting people for January 6th forever.
[57:00.960 --> 57:02.960]  Forever.
[57:02.960 --> 57:05.960]  And it'll get to a point where it doesn't even matter if you were in D.C. or not.
[57:05.960 --> 57:08.960]  If you said anything about Trump winning the 2020 election,
[57:08.960 --> 57:11.960]  if you said anything about January 6th not being a riot,
[57:11.960 --> 57:15.960]  they will come for you and arrest you as soon as they find you on the map.
[57:15.960 --> 57:16.960]  Oh, you're running for local city council?
[57:16.960 --> 57:18.960]  Oh, he said Trump won in the year 2022.
[57:18.960 --> 57:21.960]  It's now the year 2040, they arrest you.
[57:21.960 --> 57:23.960]  That's where this is going.
[57:23.960 --> 57:29.960]  And now they're going after Clarence Thomas' wife, these sickos,
[57:29.960 --> 57:35.960]  these freaks in the Democrat Party are now targeting Clarence Thomas' wife.
[57:35.960 --> 57:38.960]  How long is it going to be before the Democrats send an assassin
[57:38.960 --> 57:42.960]  to Clarence Thomas' house to kill him like they did Kavanaugh?
[57:42.960 --> 57:44.960]  Still nothing from the FBI on that, though.
[57:44.960 --> 58:13.960]  They're not going to punish Democrat terrorists.

[59:45.960 --> 59:47.960]  I'll see you there.
[59:49.960 --> 59:56.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:56.960 --> 1:00:16.960]  So now the Domestic Terror Group Democrat Party is targeting Clarence Thomas' wife, these sick freaks.
[1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:22.960]  They have published this letter at the Gateway Pundit Read the Letter.
[1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:28.960]  The sham January 6th committee sent Ginny Thomas requesting her appearance.
[1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:31.960]  Yes, they want to question her.
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:41.960]  They want a 10-hour deposition from her so they can pull 30 seconds of clips to put up in another sham made for TV event to make her look bad.
[1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:44.960]  Haven't you Democrats done enough to that thing?
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:48.960]  Haven't you Democrats tormented the Thomas family enough?
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:51.960]  Hasn't Biden done enough to that man?
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:55.960]  Why do Democrats hate Clarence Thomas so much?
[1:00:55.960 --> 1:00:59.960]  Oh, I know why, because he's black. That's why they hate him.
[1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.960]  And he's not a Democrat.
[1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:05.960]  Yes, that's exactly it.
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:10.960]  Yeah, who are the real bigots? Who are the real racist liberals?
[1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:14.960]  January 6th committee leaks more Ginny Thomas' emails to Washington Post.
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:20.960]  Oh, now, because they do discovery.
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:27.960]  And I guess the Washington Post and others are in direct communication with the FBI and with the Washington Post,
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:29.960]  and they just decide, hey, you know what, we'll give you some of these emails.
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:32.960]  I mean, who knows? They can release my emails. They can release my emails any day.
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:39.960]  They can release every text I've ever sent any day now. I don't know. They've got it all.
[1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:42.960]  So, oh, let's go look at all Ginny Thomas' texts and emails.
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:47.960]  And they want to read it all because they want to know what we're up to, know what you're up to, know what the Thomas family is up to.
[1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:49.960]  These are sick freaks, folks.
[1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:56.960]  And they'll leak those to the Washington Post, and then they'll cherry-pick stuff to make her look bad.
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:59.960]  Boy, oh boy, really something else, isn't it?
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:03.960]  No transparency for Democrats, though. They get to do whatever the hell they want,
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:09.960]  and nobody ever knows how Nancy Pelosi makes $200 million as a congresswoman.
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:17.960]  And, of course, the Democrat terrorists are making death threats to Representative Loudermilk.
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:20.960]  I want to see a shank in your throat.
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:29.960]  GOP Representative Loudermilk releases audio of numerous leftist death threats after Liz Cheney's January 6th committee and media smears.
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:45.960]  Yeah, and, of course, they're trying to make this claim that Loudermilk was showing January 6th protesters around the Capitol and around the tunnels.
[1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:58.960]  Like, he was some sort of organizer that planned on, I don't know, kidnapping or hurting Democrat members of Congress when they tried to escape through the tunnels.
[1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:03.960]  I mean, that's what they're trying to argue. And, of course, it's all BS. It's all made up.
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:07.960]  And so now the terrorist Democrats aren't sending him death threats.
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:12.960]  So how long will it be till a Democrat terrorist shows up to try to assassinate him?
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:16.960]  And if the Democrats have their way, he'll be disarmed. And there won't be any police.
[1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:21.960]  So you'll only have Democrat terrorists with guns. That's how that will go.
[1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:28.960]  Serial wire Adam Schiff urges DOJ to pursue criminal charges against Trump for engaging in alleged multiple criminal acts.
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:37.960]  Oh, yes. Yes, I'm sure Adam Schiff, the guy that promised us he had evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, the guy that promised us he'd show us that evidence.
[1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:45.960]  He never had the evidence, and so therefore he never showed us the evidence. He's a liar. Adam Schiff.
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:52.960]  J6 prisoner punished with diesel therapy and his public defender is missing in action.
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:59.960]  He was turned over to the FBI by a bumble date. Bumble is a dating app.
[1:03:59.960 --> 1:04:12.960]  And he meets some girl on bumble and she starts prying and probing about January 6th and then eventually gets enough information from him to send it to the FBI.
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:17.960]  And then they go arrest him. Now he's being tortured in a Democrat gulag.
[1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:23.960]  Pretty amazing, isn't it?
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:32.960]  But imagine Democrat, the Democrat party is the largest domestic terror group in this country's history.
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:37.960]  And they want to disarm civilians and they want to defund the police.
[1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:41.960]  And then they publish the addresses of their political enemies.
[1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:47.960]  They publish the address of their political enemies' children's schools and they send their terrorists there with guns.
[1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:56.960]  So imagine if Democrats get their way, you won't be able to have a gun, there'll be no police, and then they'll send terrorists to your house to kill you and you won't have any way of defending yourself.
[1:04:56.960 --> 1:05:19.960]  Sound fun?
[1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:32.960]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself. These other three together, it is amazing.

[1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:29.960]  I did not do my job in that first hour and tell you about infowarstore.com.
[1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:35.960]  We got to pay the bills around here. We got to make sure the crew is paid so that we can be up and on the air.
[1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:46.960]  Infowarstore.com, folks, I was asking because our supplements are so good, they sell out a lot, and so I have to check before I promote something that it's still in stock, sadly.
[1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:51.960]  It's the Biden supply chain crisis, plus it's just how popular these supplements are.
[1:06:51.960 --> 1:06:56.960]  I'm drinking fizzy magnesium today. Guys, if you do a little dot cam here, just so people can see.
[1:06:56.960 --> 1:07:01.960]  I mean, people know I don't make stuff up. We're the most trusted name in news info wars, but I've got my fizzy magnesium here.
[1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:08.960]  I've been sipping on it throughout the transmission, and I just got to tell you, I love the fizzy magnesium drink.
[1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:17.960]  It is one of my favorite drinks, and you could just market this as just an orange drink.
[1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:25.960]  You may remember orange drink mixes growing up like Tang and Sunny D and this stuff, and kids like drinking it because it tasted good.
[1:07:25.960 --> 1:07:34.960]  It was a great orange flavor. Well, we could just market this as a fantastic orange drink mix because it's pretty much the best orange drink mix I've ever had.
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:41.960]  And I remember, I mean, I would drink Sunny D as a kid, or my mom would make a picture of Tang, and me and my dad love drinking Tang.
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:47.960]  This is better, and it's healthy. So it's a total win-win.
[1:07:47.960 --> 1:07:54.960]  Fizzy magnesium drink mix, the best tasting orange drink you're going to have, plus it's healthy.
[1:07:54.960 --> 1:08:03.960]  Most people are deficient in magnesium, and magnesium is one of the key factors in enzyme function in the body.
[1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:08.960]  It's the key factor for enzyme function in the body, and most people are deficient.
[1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:14.960]  No wonder we see so many health problems. So we took care of that problem with Fizzy Magnesium.

[1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:42.960]  part of the super summer sale, Fizzy Magnesium, 25% off infowarstore.com.
[1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:47.960]  All right, let me do this. I said we would go back to Rand Paul and Anthony Fauci. Let's do that now.
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:57.960]  This is a real telling moment. Anthony Fauci is not as much a doctor as he is a criminal money thief.
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:05.960]  And that seems to be what Senator Paul exposes here in Clip 5.
[1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:14.960]  Another question for you. The NIH continues to refuse to voluntarily devolve the names of scientists who receive royalties
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:27.960]  and from which companies. Over the period of time from 2010 to 2016, 27,000 royalty payments were paid to 1,800 NIH employees.
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:33.960]  We know that not because you told us, but because we forced you to tell us through the Freedom of Information Act.
[1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:39.960]  Over $193 million was given to these 1,800 employees.
[1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:50.960]  Can you tell me that you have not received a royalty from any entity that you ever oversaw the distribution of money in research grants?
[1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:54.960]  Well, first of all, let's talk about royalties.
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:11:00.960]  That's the question. No, that's the question. Have you ever received a royalty payment from a company?
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:12.960]  Here, guys, pause it right there for me real quick and rewind it 10 seconds or so. Because I want you guys to just listen to that again and understand.
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:24.960]  All Fauci had to say was no. That's all he had to say. But he didn't. Why didn't he? Because the answer is obviously yes.
[1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:30.960]  So just I want to replay that part because that's the key pivotal part of this.
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:36.960]  And he'll go on back and forth with Rand Paul. Why doesn't Anthony Fauci answer Rand Paul's question with no?
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:42.960]  All he had to do was say no. But he's under oath. So he doesn't want to lie. So he doesn't say no.
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:47.960]  But he also doesn't want to say yes. Because, well, that would be pretty revealing, wouldn't it?
[1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:52.960]  So listen to it one more time. Why doesn't Anthony Fauci just say no?
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:58.960]  Over $193 million was given to these 1800 employees.
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:09.960]  Can you tell me that you have not received a royalty from any entity that you ever oversaw the distribution of money in research grants?
[1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:13.960]  Well, first of all, let's talk about royalties.
[1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:23.960]  That's the question. No, that's the question. Have you ever received a royalty payment from a company that you later oversaw money going to that company?
[1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:26.960]  You know, I don't know as a fact, but I doubt it.
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:30.960]  Well, here's the thing is, why don't you let us know? Why don't you?
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:31.960]  He doesn't know my ass.
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:36.960]  How much you've gotten and from what entities? The NIH refuses. Look, we ask them. We ask them.
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:43.960]  The NIH, we ask them whether or not who got it and how much they refused to tell us they sent it redacted.
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:51.960]  Here's what I want to know. It's not just about you. Everybody on the vaccine committee, have any of them ever received money from the people who make vaccines?
[1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:59.960]  Can you tell me that? Can you tell me if anybody on the vaccine approval committees ever received any money from people who make vaccines?
[1:12:59.960 --> 1:13:02.960]  Sound bite number one. Are you going to let me answer a question?
[1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:15.960]  Okay, so let me give you some information. First of all, according to the regulations, people who receive royalties are not required to divulge them, even on their financial issues.
[1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:22.960]  Interesting. I have a puzzle right there. Well, there we go. Okay, so we have the answer here. So let's go ahead and change that regulation. How about that?
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:28.960]  Let's get, you know, we love hearing about transparency so much. It's all about transparency, right? Let's get a little transparency.
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:35.960]  Let's end that regulation. Let's end that rule that protects corrupt bureaucrats like Anthony Fauci. How about that?
[1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:43.960]  And by the way, he's like, we're going to let me answer. You're going to let me answer. He still hasn't answered the question. Still hasn't done it.
[1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:57.960]  But thank you, Fauci. Thank you for telling us that you guys protect your criminal enterprise by writing rules that say you don't have to divulge how much money you're getting paid off by these private corporations to do their bidding in the government.
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:05.960]  So all we got to do now is change that rule. So I hope Rand Paul heard that loud and clear, and I hope Rand Paul moves to change that rule.
[1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:10.960]  But here, guys, just rewind it 10 seconds and let's finish the clip here.
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:19.960]  Vaccines. Can you tell me that? Can you tell me if anybody on the vaccine approval committees ever received any money from people with vaccines?
[1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:39.960]  Sounds like number one. Are you going to let me answer a question? Okay, so let me give you some information. First of all, according to the regulations, people who receive royalties are not required to divulge them, even on their financial statement, according to the Buy Dole Act.
[1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:58.960]  So let me give you some examples. Let's change that. From 2015 to 2020, the only royalties I have was my lab and I made a monoclonal antibody for use in vitro reagent that had nothing to do with patients.
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:14.960]  And during that period of time, my royalties range from $21 a year to $700 a year, and the average per year was $191.46.
[1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:28.960]  It's all redacted and you can't get any information on the 18-year-old scientist. So we want to know whether or not people got money from the people who made the manufacturing.
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:45.960]  Yes, the witness has responded. We are going to move on. Senator Sanders. All right. So I mean liberals call for transparency all day long. They're the ones, transparency, transparency. We need transparency. So all right, let's come together. The right, the left, Democrats, Republicans, let's come together for transparency.
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:58.960]  Let's end that rule that keeps royalties paid off, government employees paid off by royalties. Let's make those informations public.
[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:27.960]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish and it's the same thing with our immune system. God helps those who help themselves. We have a lot of amazing products on sale right now at infowarstore.com.

[1:18:57.960 --> 1:19:06.960]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the internet and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought, you know, this is going to level the playing field.
[1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:11.960]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information and everybody's going to be able to freely communicate that information.
[1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:23.960]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information. We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever we want,
[1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:35.960]  and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations we're having,
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:42.960]  because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions, the people we want to talk to about these things.
[1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:48.960]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take back their privacy.
[1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:55.960]  And so that's really what we're trying to do and so I hope that everybody listening will check us out at boltowireless.com.
[1:19:55.960 --> 1:20:05.960]  That's boltowireless.com.
[1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:40.960]  You're being lied to about the war in Ukraine, of course you are. You've been lied to about every war in my lifetime at least, my 32 years on this planet.
[1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:47.960]  Pretty much been lied to about every war. And most of the war is before that too. So they're lying to you about Ukraine.
[1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:55.960]  But you know, the Bidens really don't want that money laundering operation, that proxy state in Ukraine to go away.
[1:20:55.960 --> 1:21:11.960]  So even though everyone else is backing off and not wanting to deal with it, Zelensky is still working for the West now and they just continue to propagandize the planet with Zelensky and the lies about what's going on in Ukraine.
[1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:20.960]  President Zelensky appears as 3D hologram, tells tech leaders Ukraine will lead global digital revolution if they fund reconstruction.
[1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:31.960]  Yes, yes, let America unofficially have a war with Russia in Ukraine and then Ukraine will be the bastion of the tech revolution.
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:40.960]  I mean talk about propaganda, talk about bull crap. And I mean they've really got this Zelensky to go along with all of it.
[1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:52.960]  So who owns Zelensky and why? Or is he just making billions of dollars off of this giant charade that nobody else is playing by the way?
[1:21:52.960 --> 1:22:01.960]  I cannot emphasize this enough folks. The only country that is really fully bought in and playing the charade is the United States.
[1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:20.960]  Most European countries, NATO countries, EU countries, they're pretty much balking. I mean they may provide some lip service for Biden's war in Ukraine against Russia but other than that they're pretty much balking and even the lip service has kind of exhausted itself.
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:32.960]  With even Macron saying look we're done in Ukraine. I don't know what else we're supposed to do here. Unless you want us to have a full blown war with Russia which apparently what the globalists want,
[1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:44.960]  smarter minds have prevailed thus far. But Russia won, I don't know if you could say it's over, but Russia has won. They've pretty much done everything they've set out to do.
[1:22:44.960 --> 1:23:01.960]  They've captured and taken care of the Nazis that were there, the Azov battalion and they have freed eastern Ukraine from the grips of such groups and other CIA front groups and proxy groups and the wars that were constantly going on there for years.
[1:23:01.960 --> 1:23:22.960]  That's all over now thanks to Russia and Putin and the eastern Ukraine region is celebrating Putin and celebrating Russia for finally doing this and now Russia controls the Crimea region which is really the gem of the region and the entire eastern front has been liberated.
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:35.960]  And the rest of Ukraine is pretty much back to normal. But then there's the US, money laundering, weapons laundering, who knows what's really going on, but it's sick and you've been lied to about it the entire time.
[1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:55.960]  Now in other developments, Israel secretly coordinates Syria airstrikes with the United States. Are they about to go after Assad again folks? Let me tell you right now that that's the kind of thing that could turn this situation into much worse because Syria has a good relationship with Russia
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:24:09.960]  and Assad has a good relationship with Putin and I mean Putin's been on record before basically telling the US to stop bullying Syria, leave Syria alone.
[1:24:09.960 --> 1:24:19.960]  And Trump did for the most part, I think he kind of engaged in a little bit of propaganda in Syria just to kind of do it and get it over with.
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:30.960]  But Syria was much better off when Trump was in office. Is it about to be another bad place with Israel and the US sending proxy groups in there and arming proxy groups in there?
[1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:45.960]  Or who knows? I mean maybe all these weapons going into Ukraine, maybe that was just a smoke screen and they're actually sending those weapons into the region to eventually fall into the hands of terrorists and CIA proxy groups to go in and try to take out Assad.
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:56.960]  So this is not an insignificant thing. We'll see if it develops any further. America is making sure the IDF attacks don't interfere with their operations in the country.
[1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:06.960]  US officials claim Israel strikes against Iranian linked targets in Syria. That's again Iran and Russia are going to end up in a strong relationship out of this if this continues.
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:15.960]  And then you'll have China and Iran and Russia and India and the US sitting there with Biden's thumb up his butt.
[1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:26.960]  Israel strikes against Iran linked targets in Syria have been carried out with the secret approval of the US military. The Wall Street Journal is reporting.
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:37.960]  So just more proxy wars, more regime wars, more territory wars that the West and Israel are running in the region. It's just, it needs to stop folks.
[1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:45.960]  It just, it needs to stop. And we pay for all of it. Sadly. Sadly.
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:52.960]  And then there's Taiwan. Taiwan touts ability to attack Beijing with supersonic cruise missiles.
[1:25:52.960 --> 1:26:03.960]  Boy, oh boy, is that some aggressive rhetoric out of Taiwan. Taiwanese officials are now touting that they possess an advanced cruise missile which is capable of hitting locations on the Chinese mainland,
[1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:12.960]  which could be launched as a counter strike in the event of a Chinese military invasion of the island, which I think everyone is kind of expecting now.
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:22.960]  Because here's what's happened. China sees what Biden is doing in Ukraine.
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:29.960]  And China understands that what's really going on is that Biden has unofficially and illegally launched a war against Russia.
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:40.960]  And Ukraine is just the battlefront. Now that situation has either played itself out or calmed down at least for the meantime.
[1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:50.960]  But so China says, oh, I see your strategy, Biden. You unofficially launch wars, but then don't tell anyone what you're actually doing is war against Russia.
[1:26:50.960 --> 1:27:02.960]  That's an interesting strategy. I think we'll do that in Taiwan. And it's almost as if they're doing it intentionally as a snide to Joe Biden and the West,
[1:27:02.960 --> 1:27:14.960]  saying, oh, we're having a non-war intervention in Taiwan. Like, I mean, to me, that's a blatant thumb in the eye of Joe Biden and the West making fun of what we're doing in Ukraine.
[1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:26.960]  That's how I see it. It's like, oh, we're having a non-war intervention. What? No, that's China making fun of Biden in the West and what they're doing in Ukraine.
[1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:36.960]  So if China goes into Taiwan, they'll just say, hey, wait a second. This is a non-war intervention. This is like what you're doing in Ukraine.
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:43.960]  This isn't a war. We're just, hey, we're just moving in here. We're just sending weapons in here. We're just sending money in here.
[1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:54.960]  In artillery, it's non-war. Yeah, just some aircraft carriers and stuff, but it's non-war. It's like what you guys are doing in Ukraine, right? Right? Yeah.
[1:27:54.960 --> 1:28:08.960]  And I don't know what the U.S. is going to do if China goes into Taiwan. In fact, sadly, I think China may test it soon to find out that Biden will do nothing.
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:24.960]  Now, if China does go into Taiwan and they start the communists, start taking over the manufacturing there and the industry there, we're in big trouble, big, big trouble.
[1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:37.960]  You thought we had a microchip shortage during COVID. If China goes into Taiwan and takes control of those microchip factories and other production means in Taiwan,
[1:28:37.960 --> 1:28:47.960]  and they choose to not send those goods to the West anymore, oh yeah, you're going to really see things start to get bad.
[1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:57.960]  The Biden supply chain crisis, the Biden economic collapse will continue because the Biden foreign policy has been such a disaster.
[1:28:57.960 --> 1:29:09.960]  The Internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right. People ask, what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:21.960]  I tried to stop it, and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:29.960]  It's now out in the open. Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg Group founded Davos Group.
[1:29:29.960 --> 1:29:36.960]  So now the fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing.
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:44.960]  God's watching the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you,

[1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:06.960]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:32:06.960 --> 1:32:16.960]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:26.960]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:32.960]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[1:32:32.960 --> 1:32:37.960]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:50.960]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Valerian root.
[1:32:50.960 --> 1:33:05.960]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:26.960]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:44.960]  I want to follow up that last segment and try to explain what's happening geopolitically right now, because I really don't understand this, but no one else in the American media is really addressing this issue.
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:52.960]  I would assume some understand it, at least to an extent, but I don't see anybody really addressing this issue.
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:55.960]  Now, I know why our politicians aren't addressing it.
[1:33:55.960 --> 1:34:12.960]  Most of them are in on it, both Republicans and Democrats, with just all the crimes that have been coming out of D.C., the lying to get us into wars, the money laundering, the insider trading, all of it that's going on.
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:20.960]  And so here's what is happening on the world stage right now that nobody is talking about.
[1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:28.960]  The U.S. has been at the head of the international table probably since World War II.
[1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:35.960]  Let's say since World War II, mostly, the U.S. has been at the head of the international table.
[1:34:35.960 --> 1:34:50.960]  And a lot of the global marketplace is dictated by what the U.S. is doing and what the United States foreign policy is.
[1:34:50.960 --> 1:35:03.960]  And for the most part, it's been good for the planet, and it's been an amicable relationship with these other countries, because we send them a bunch of money, probably pay off their politicians.
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:07.960]  And, you know, cut deals.
[1:35:07.960 --> 1:35:19.960]  And then we've always kind of had the bedrock of the control factor of the U.S. dollar being what's used for gas purchases, for petro. It's a petro dollar.
[1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:23.960]  But here's what's happened.
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:42.960]  Other world leaders and other countries that are coming of age and becoming fully developed and becoming independent and starting to make their own trade deals and other deals with other countries are realizing that it's not even about whether they need the U.S. or not.
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:58.960]  It's about holy crap, the U.S. keeps sending illegitimate, mentally ill, insane wackos as their leaders.
[1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:11.960]  So imagine you're at, let's say, a board meeting and the head of the board is just a complete lunatic and a whack job.
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:20.960]  So you don't think that the other members of that board that are sitting that aren't the head of the table, you don't think there's going to be grumblings like, hey, boy, you know, this guy's kind of lost his mind.
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:24.960]  This guy's kind of tanking everything. You know, what can we do?
[1:36:24.960 --> 1:36:31.960]  You don't think people are going to start chattering and talking and figuring out ways to get rid of that head of the table, get rid of that whack job at the head of the table?
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:36.960]  Folks, that's what's going on right now with Joe Biden.
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:42.960]  So the world is about to leave the U.S. behind.
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:52.960]  And there's going to be a new international power structure that's forming right now, which is going to be China and Russia and Iran and India.
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:37:02.960]  And then in the West, in the Americans, in the Americas, probably Mexico and Brazil, maybe even Argentina.
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:13.960]  And the U.S. could go either way here. The U.S. could get in on this if we have good leadership or the U.S. can be left behind if we have leaders like Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton.
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:27.960]  But so that's what's going on. We've sent Joe Biden to be the head of the table and he's a complete whacked out, crapping his pants, forgets where he's at, geriatric old criminal from a family of sexual deviance.
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:40.960]  The whole world knows it now. And so all the other leaders of these other countries are starting to talk saying, hey, this guy who's at the head of the table, he's a complete disaster.
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:47.960]  He is a serious problem. And so they're starting to cut their own deals. They're starting to make their own little power structures.
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:55.960]  They're starting to figure out their own relationships, their own marketplaces, and they're leaving the U.S. behind.
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:38:05.960]  And see, the Western elite and the U.S. political class has been so corrupted and detached from reality for so long that they can't even believe it.
[1:38:05.960 --> 1:38:15.960]  They can't even imagine that the day would ever come where their power and influence would be removed from under them like a rug.
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:28.960]  But that's what's happening, folks. The world is deciding to leave the U.S. behind because they can't deal with Joe Biden.
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:40.960]  And so it appears to me now the trend is that you're going to have Europe and you're going to have America, United States, America and Canada that are going to be the only ones left here
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:53.960]  that are twiddling their thumbs and playing with their dingalings because they're so obsessed with the global homo-corruption world government with their sycophantic elites like Bill Gates.
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:59.960]  And the rest of the world is just done. And they haven't even figured it out yet.
[1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:09.960]  And I'm just amazed that more in the media haven't figured this out or they're not talking about it because that's what's going on.
[1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:14.960]  So the whole globalist movement is actually already failed. It's already dead on arrival.
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:18.960]  Russia's never going into the New World Order, China's never going into the New World Order.
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:24.960]  India's never going into the New World Order, Mexico's never going into the New World Order, Saudi Arabia's never going into the New World Order,
[1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:28.960]  the UAE is never going into the New World Order, Brazil is never going into the New World Order.
[1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:34.960]  So globalism has failed. It has failed. It's done.
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:38.160]  The corporate, the corporate global government is done.
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:41.600]  Klaus Schwab's pipe dream is dead.
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:44.720]  Now, they might be able to conquer the European Union
[1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:47.480]  and countries in Europe,
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:48.560]  and they might be able to conquer
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:50.560]  the United States and Canada,
[1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:52.600]  but that's all they're gonna have.
[1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:55.160]  But that's fine, they'll have us as their subjects
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:39:58.120]  as they view it, and they'll force vaccinate us,
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:00.280]  force your kids to be gay,
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:02.280]  they'll make it illegal to own property,
[1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:04.760]  they'll make you eat bugs, that's their plan,
[1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:06.000]  they've bragged about it.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:07.800]  And the only parts of the planet
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:10.480]  that seem to be willing to go along with this now
[1:40:10.480 --> 1:40:12.800]  are the United States of America,
[1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:15.080]  Canada, and the European Union.
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:16.960]  The rest of the world is done.
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:19.440]  They're done dealing with geriatric old criminals
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:20.800]  like Joe Biden.
[1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:23.680]  They don't wanna hear from some psychotic maniac
[1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:26.440]  in a Darth Vader outfit, Klaus Schwab.
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:32.360]  So, see, our media, our elite,
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:36.080]  our power structure is so detached from reality
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:39.600]  and so high off of their own excrement
[1:40:39.600 --> 1:40:42.800]  that they don't even realize that this is what's going on.
[1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:46.000]  And they couldn't even comprehend it if they could.
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:49.840]  They're being left behind, folks.
[1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:54.120]  Now, if there's a silver lining to this,
[1:40:54.120 --> 1:40:55.720]  that might be a good thing,
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:59.520]  because how else is the US going to get rid
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:03.360]  of this corrupt political elite class,
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:06.560]  this ruling class, this political regime class,
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:11.560]  this deep state if we don't even know that that's the case?
[1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:16.280]  So this can be a major wake-up call
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:19.760]  as some of the most corrupt politicians in US history
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:23.680]  are in their last moments here,
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:28.680]  Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton.
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:31.920]  I mean, they're done, like they can't be around forever.
[1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:36.800]  So they're just hoping that they can hand the platter over
[1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:41.520]  to the Klaus Schwab's, the Yovall Harare's and others
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:43.080]  in the new corporate world government,
[1:41:43.080 --> 1:41:45.920]  except it's not there.
[1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:47.840]  It doesn't exist, nobody wants it.
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:51.720]  So it's almost like there's an expiration date
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:55.480]  on this deep state and when they think
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:42:00.480]  that they're gonna be handing the baton to the UN
[1:42:02.760 --> 1:42:06.440]  and the WHO and the World Economic Forum,
[1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:09.760]  except it's already dead on arrival.
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:13.840]  It's all just self-service, lip service
[1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:18.880]  and pipe dreams of tyrannical psychotic maniacs.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:25.120]  So I just, you know, we have the most informed audience
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:26.680]  out there and I'm not really seeing this
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:27.640]  being covered anywhere else.
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:29.680]  So I'm just trying to explain it the best I can
[1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:31.440]  and it's way beyond my pay grade.
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:33.320]  And I've tried my best here in this 10 minute segment,
[1:42:33.320 --> 1:42:34.960]  but that's what's going on.
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:37.680]  The rest of the world is leaving the US behind
[1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:40.600]  because we're sending Joe Biden as our leader
[1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:42.920]  to the head of the table and nobody wants to deal with him.
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:46.880]  Nobody wants to talk to him, nobody respects him,
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:48.400]  nobody wants to be around him
[1:42:48.400 --> 1:42:51.280]  and the world actually wants to go into a new
[1:42:51.280 --> 1:42:55.000]  industrial revolution that empowers humanity
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:56.400]  as the globalists like Klaus Schwad
[1:42:56.400 --> 1:42:57.600]  are trying to enslave it.
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:01.360]  The National Suisse is a new film, 2000 Mules
[1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:03.480]  is the most important documentary in modern times
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:07.400]  because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election
[1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:09.320]  and how they're planning to steal future elections
[1:43:09.320 --> 1:43:12.560]  and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:13.840]  Now it's great that it's online
[1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:15.680]  and it's great that millions watch online,
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:18.560]  but you need to have the high quality HDDVD

[1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:39.720]  the seminal classic that predicted the great reset
[1:43:39.720 --> 1:43:41.360]  and of course part one, part two
[1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:44.320]  and now the new part three of COVID land.

[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:04.400]  I mean this is from, people say,
[1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:07.560]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:44:07.560 --> 1:44:09.840]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[1:44:09.840 --> 1:44:12.440]  that's wild harvested above organic
[1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:14.880]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee
[1:44:14.880 --> 1:44:16.920]  and yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[1:44:16.920 --> 1:44:18.440]  that the media calls communists
[1:44:18.440 --> 1:44:19.640]  but really they're just a commune
[1:44:19.640 --> 1:44:21.920]  and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:23.400]  and we've got it and the farmers
[1:44:23.400 --> 1:44:24.920]  don't want the Mexican government to take over
[1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:26.680]  so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:28.240]  and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:29.360]  and the price has never gone up.
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:31.400]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:33.520]  for about 50% more per pound
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:35.080]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:36.160]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:38.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.560]  from the Chiapas rebels literally.
[1:44:40.560 --> 1:44:42.720]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:47.680]  Yeah, I'd like to, you wouldn't believe it.
[1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:50.520]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[1:44:50.520 --> 1:44:52.240]  and that's how we fund this operation
[1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:53.720]  and if you don't fund us, you don't want to see it,
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:54.560]  that's fine.
[1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:04.680]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right,
[1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:06.480]  thanks for holding her on the ear, go ahead.
[1:45:06.480 --> 1:45:09.440]  Challenge first of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:13.440]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there
[1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:16.040]  that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[1:45:16.040 --> 1:45:18.720]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots
[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:20.160]  as they're lovingly called,
[1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:23.320]  but since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[1:45:23.320 --> 1:45:26.160]  my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:28.200]  People think I'm 55 years old
[1:45:29.200 --> 1:45:31.760]  and I was already taking your other supplements
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:34.800]  but I thought, well maybe that's what I need to do
[1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:37.200]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:38.680]  but when I started taking it,
[1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:40.280]  I mean it doesn't happen immediately
[1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:43.920]  but over a period of time, I started noticing,
[1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:46.720]  okay, this is a ticket, this is working,
[1:45:46.720 --> 1:45:50.480]  this is wonderful, I don't have to put on
[1:45:50.480 --> 1:45:54.520]  derma blend anymore, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:45:54.520 --> 1:46:18.520]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:26.520]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:27.520]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:28.520]  I'll see you in the next one.
[1:46:28.520 --> 1:46:56.520]  Be self-sufficient and fund the InfoWare
[1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:04.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:33.520]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:36.520]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
[1:47:36.520 --> 1:47:37.520]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[1:47:37.520 --> 1:48:06.520]  I hope you enjoyed it.

[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:40.520]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
[1:50:40.520 --> 1:51:06.520]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
[1:51:06.520 --> 1:51:32.520]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
[1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:58.520]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
[1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:24.520]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
[1:52:24.520 --> 1:52:50.520]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
[1:52:50.520 --> 1:53:16.520]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
