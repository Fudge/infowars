[00:00.000 --> 00:23.000]  Attention! A curfew is in effect at 1800 hours and up to 600 hours tomorrow. All individuals, mostly the U.S. have no doubt, will be cut down to a wrap.
[00:23.000 --> 00:40.000]  I repeat, a curfew is in effect at 1800 hours until 600 hours tomorrow. All individuals, mostly the U.S. have no doubt, will be cut down to a wrap.
[00:40.000 --> 00:55.000]  See, I didn't just play Air Raid Shires. It's something I've shown last year for effects scarier. I did it because I knew this was going to happen.
[00:55.000 --> 01:05.000]  I'm studying globalists that have done it in other countries. See, that's what I do. Everybody just wonders, how does Jones know everything? Why is Jones almost always right?
[01:05.000 --> 01:25.000]  Well, because the criminals tell us what they're going to do and then no one seems to want to care. I read in medical papers and medical journals that listeners actually sent me in 1996, because nobody else would cover this stuff, that they were doing animal human clones with pigs and humans in the 1980s.
[01:25.000 --> 01:40.000]  Well, that's in the news today. Everyone's like, Jones, how did he predict it? I didn't predict it. It's like, Jones predicted there's a place called Hoover Dam in Nevada and I was driving through Nevada and I pulled up and it was there.
[01:40.000 --> 01:51.000]  He predicted it and then it appeared. No, it was built back in the 30s or whatever. You understand how frustrating this is? I'm going to explain this to everybody one more time.
[01:51.000 --> 02:04.000]  I liked cartoons and I like Pulp Fiction and I like books about Conan the Barbarian, you know, written back in the 30s. And then I started reading my parents' history books and got hooked on that.
[02:04.000 --> 02:14.000]  And then there was a book written by Hitler, Mein Kampf, so I thought I'd read that. And then there was a book by Winston Churchill. I thought I'd read that. By the time I was like 12 years old, I was reading Frederick Nietzsche.
[02:14.000 --> 02:25.000]  Now, then I started reading Zabigniew Brzezinski by the time I was about 12. My mother would be like, what the hell are you doing reading the secret British wartime report, The Mind of Adolf Hitler, when you're 12 years old?
[02:25.000 --> 02:33.000]  It was way better than the comic books. I was a great reader. I read at the 12th grade level when I was eight years old. I wasn't good at math, though.
[02:33.000 --> 02:44.000]  And so I'm here like I know a language. Other people don't know the language. And they think like I'm showing off when I say stuff like this. And it's like, oh, that's just his opinion. No, none of this is my opinion.
[02:44.000 --> 02:55.000]  So I began to read where they were saying that they would set up a planetary government, get rid of family, and then phase out the population. And I thought this is really wild because these people run things.
[02:55.000 --> 03:06.000]  And they projected forward computers and tracking us and controlling us and social credit scores and all of this.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  And I had a lot of family that was intellectual and was studying how things worked. So I just thought everybody knew this stuff.
[03:12.000 --> 03:21.000]  So here we are today. Now, here's the rest of the story. It's not about how I know all this. It's how they're not in the testing phase anymore. They've gone operational.
[03:21.000 --> 03:29.000]  And so can we put the headline up for the live show today, please? Remember, FullWars.com. Every day we have a posting with a live audio and video feed in it.
[03:29.000 --> 03:37.000]  And it says right there, we are now in the New World Order. Tune into this emergency broadcast if you want to live.
[03:37.000 --> 03:47.000]  Because when you look at people and when you see children that are two or three years old today, they're growing up in a dystopia.
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.000]  And it's going to accelerate very, very quickly. And that's the last generation that'll even be able to have children.
[03:53.000 --> 04:02.000]  And most of them won't be able to. And most of the children you see today will be dead by the time they're 20 years old of cancers and other things implanted in them.
[04:02.000 --> 04:11.000]  And you'll be told, oh, something else caused it, but it's the vaccines. You're all being killed. We're all dying.
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  So I want all the FBI agents to know. I want all the bureaucrats to know and liberals to know, conservatives to know.
[04:17.000 --> 04:27.000]  Everybody thinks you're part of the system. You're not part of the system. I can tell you the people running this are not in control.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  Now, they've been given advanced knowledge.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  Interdimensionally, that's how they get it. You'd call it Satanism.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  But it's aliens and they're running a plan to have us slowly all kill ourselves and merge with machines.
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  Now, if you want to go through this, go ahead and accept it. But you need to understand this is a planetary takeover.
[04:46.000 --> 04:54.000]  That's what it is. And any of you that go along with this are fools because we received the transmission 2000 years ago that it will be stopped.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[04:58.000 --> 05:06.000]  Now is the time to get prepared. You got to pray to God and get your soul ready. You got to be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family.
[05:06.000 --> 05:12.000]  You've also got to get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the system.
[05:12.000 --> 05:22.000]  That's why they want to bankrupt the economy. It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation because they want all of us on our knees so they can dictate our surrender to them.
[05:22.000 --> 05:30.000]  Info Wars is a critical organization in the fight against the globalist. And if you gave us straight up donations, that would be great because our work is important.
[05:30.000 --> 05:39.000]  We appreciate it. But we bring you great products so that you get high quality products at the same time as supporting the Info War 360 win.
[05:39.000 --> 05:51.000]  Well, we've only got a few days left to get 2020 prices before the prices go up on high quality storeable food with huge discounts as big as $850 discount on a year supply of food.
[05:51.000 --> 05:58.000]  At infowarstore.com. So take advantage of these sales right now at infowarstore.com where you still can.
[05:58.000 --> 06:24.000]  Alright, I've analyzed basically every element, every angle of the globalist operation.
[06:24.000 --> 06:36.000]  And I can tell you that it is demonically inspired and not of this world. I don't get into flying saucers, Roswell, little green men, Sidonia on Mars, any of that stuff.
[06:36.000 --> 06:43.000]  Though I've had dinner with Apollo astronauts that told me that the government does have secret operations with aliens.
[06:43.000 --> 06:55.000]  All I know is that interdimensionally there is an attack on this planet. And so we can look at all this news and all the things that are happening, all the insanity.
[06:55.000 --> 07:15.000]  And we can say to ourselves, well, this is man made, but it's not. We have a fallen nature, but we are being manipulated and the Bible tells us that interdimensionally a creature that is out of the light spectrum vision that we can see
[07:15.000 --> 07:27.000]  fell to this planet and has a plan to overtake us, play God and then use us in our creativity to build an escape system for it off of the planet.
[07:27.000 --> 07:36.000]  That's how advanced we are. We are way more advanced than the species, the creature that turned against God.
[07:36.000 --> 07:49.000]  Now that's the Bible, folks, and the whole secret societies and the churches and the masons, and all of that is to keep you from that information. But Solomon knew it, the Egyptians knew it, the Aztecs knew it and were overtaken by it.
[07:49.000 --> 08:05.000]  That's what this is. And they've proven now in scientific studies, and I told you this before it was declassified, because I heard it directly when I was a child from people that were in the program and in the project,
[08:05.000 --> 08:18.000]  that they had groups then taking intravenous DMT and things like that, and like astronauts going into the other dimension and communicating with these entities and making deals and getting knowledge back,
[08:18.000 --> 08:28.000]  which you read in the Graham Grimoire Black Magic books, the real ones, not the pop culture ones that are out there, you got to get into private libraries like the Getty in places we've been allowed into.
[08:28.000 --> 08:38.000]  There's some of our sources. Gavin Wentz, when we were husband, got us into the actual main satanic library in North America from his contacts.
[08:38.000 --> 08:49.000]  Tapestries of black Sabbaths, bleeding children out, everything. We actually put that video out, and so they definitely have some good work there.
[08:49.000 --> 08:59.000]  So that's what we're dealing with there. And when you pull back from it and you understand that, that everything else makes sense.
[08:59.000 --> 09:10.000]  I can talk about the martial law. I can talk about the lockdown. I can talk about the mass. I can talk about the announcements that you're going to have to have vaccines and travel passports to fly.
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  It's now official. I mean, we're off the edge of the cliff. We're in the new world order now.
[09:15.000 --> 09:23.000]  But if you don't understand that at the end of this, everybody dies and there's no more children.
[09:23.000 --> 09:37.000]  And in the process of wanting to live through the social credit score, they tighten the noose down, they tighten the vice down until you are involved in public rituals of sterilizing your children, sterilizing yourself,
[09:37.000 --> 09:49.000]  resisting God, resenting God, and turning over your humanity because you're so sick, you've got to merge with machines so you just believe you have a chance to still live, though you will actually die.
[09:49.000 --> 09:58.000]  But it will be a law that you cannot call the synthetics that are human machine-merged cyborgs dead.
[09:58.000 --> 10:09.000]  If you say that's not a person anymore, they didn't transfer over to the machine. It's a fraud. It's a complex AI mimicking them. That will be punishable by death.
[10:09.000 --> 10:22.000]  I have the entire enemy blueprint. All right? And now I've studied this so much and now we've gone so far and I've experienced things at different levels.
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  To where now anybody can go read with the globalists saying what they do and know what they're going to carry out.
[10:28.000 --> 10:36.000]  But now from my immersion in this, since about seven years old, I can, to use the analogy, see the code of the matrix.
[10:36.000 --> 10:45.000]  And so let me just tell you for sure that it's only going to get worse from here. The good times are over.
[10:45.000 --> 10:53.000]  Don't commit suicide, folks. You're here to warn others and we have spirits. They can get our bodies. They can put us. They can torture us. They can rape us.
[10:53.000 --> 11:02.000]  But God is real. Good is real. And we are resonating to really bad darkness and the planet is being turned completely over to Satan right now.
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  And it is going to be so bad. That's why you look at Bill Gates. You look at Warren Buffett. You look at Prince Charles.
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.000]  You look at Prince Philip. I mean, pull up a photo of Prince Philip. Type in crazy Prince Philip. You look at Jimmy Savelle.
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.000]  You look at Brian Stelter. You look at Joe Biden. You look at Hillary Clinton. Those aren't people in power.
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.000]  Those aren't people that are happy. Those are slaves. Those are race.
[11:29.000 --> 11:39.000]  Those are people that have resonated so long and so much with raw demonic possession.
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.000]  An experience that is extremely exhilarating at one level, but deeper into it, it becomes total bondage.
[11:46.000 --> 11:55.000]  But the boiling satanic rage is unlike anything you've ever felt. I have felt it. It is extremely addictive.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  But I only dipped into it maybe 20 times and it is extremely high level satanic energy as well.
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  I'm talking Lucifer energy. These people are more like gremlins, but you look at a Prince Philip, Prince Charles, or the Rockefeller Rothschilds.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  That's Lucifer energy. Okay. This is not a game, folks. And so I'm just going to tell you everything.
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.000]  I'm going to just start laying it all out for you because you have to understand.
[12:21.000 --> 12:31.000]  I don't know if Adelson has that look. I mean, he has a look of like an old sick man and had a parasitic business model, but look at Stelter.
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  Look at Hillary. Look at Prince Charles tries to hide it, but look at Prince Philip. He can't hide it.
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  That's why they don't have nothing public now. I mean, you look at him the latest photos of him.
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  I mean, it looks like that, but actually 10 times more evil.
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.000]  It looks like Stelter, but a Transylvanian, Vlad the Impaler model. Yeah.
[12:51.000 --> 12:58.000]  I mean, that is the direct descendant of Count Dracula. That is Dracula. I mean, these people aren't, those people drink blood.
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.000]  Okay. Blood transfusions weekly of children. It's all on record.
[13:04.000 --> 13:13.000]  See, you need to grow up, folks. That is a avatar. That is a body suit for an alien.
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.000]  And all of you have a super computer brain that's tied, tied into the universe.
[13:17.000 --> 13:23.000]  You all know when I say that you get chills up your back and the hair stands up on your arms because you already know that.
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  Christ came up to these men that were demon possessed. They were saying we're going to kill you and Christ said in the name of God,
[13:34.000 --> 13:53.000]  the devil's out of these men and the devil's left those men on that hilltop and ran into some wild pigs and the pigs ran off the edge of a cliff.
[13:53.000 --> 14:00.000]  And so again, aliens don't land in flying saucers like Mars attacks and come out with ray guns.
[14:00.000 --> 14:09.000]  They take over your electrochemical magnetic system with a jamming oscillation frequency at a space time continuum transmission.
[14:09.000 --> 14:17.000]  And the only way to block it is to have free will and accept God's energy of love and justice and freedom and to resonate with that.
[14:17.000 --> 14:26.000]  But with great wisdom comes great sorrow because if you actually become a real Christian and tune into the Christ energy,
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  you will then see the Satanism and you won't be able to be part of it. You won't be able to join it.
[14:32.000 --> 14:40.000]  And it will be very painful to you to know that the universe is secrets and have a connection to the absolute creator of everything
[14:40.000 --> 14:50.000]  and to have free will to know how good it is and then to see weird count Dracula creatures on top big piles of marble and gold suits and all this.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  Oh, like like a bunch of Skeksis dressed up how powerful they are and they're all being promised life extension technology.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  You're going to live forever. You're going to merge the machines.
[14:59.000 --> 15:09.000]  But first you've got to suck all the knowledge out of humanity and use our incredible God-given creativity made in a little G to build this fabulous system.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  But all we get is the poison and the trash and the radiation and the death.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  We don't get any of the actual good stuff.
[15:17.000 --> 15:25.000]  And of course, the globalists are so twisted, they can't even use any of the good stuff. They can't even recognize it.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  And so I just want to tell liberals, conservatives, all of you, look, I know what happened with Trump.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Wishful thinking happened with Trump.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  So I'm going to tell you what really went down with Trump. We come back.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  I've thought about this. I've prayed about this and I'll explain when we come back.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  But just listen to me. Listen to me.
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  The New World Order is here. Tune in to this emergency broadcast if you want to live.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  That's not a joke because the God of this world loves death.
[15:53.000 --> 16:20.000]  The resistance dot video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  But the new website is
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  TheResistance.video
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  TheResistance.video
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  So the new URL that links right to banned.video
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  All the special reports and all the suppressed information is at TheResistance.video
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  Share the link to TheResistance.video
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  TheResistance.video
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased but I'm going to tell you all now
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  if you haven't tried Turboforce you need to try it.
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  I've tried Turboforce with everything.
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  I put Turboforce in my coffee. That was a crazy week.
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, Turboforce is my favorite
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.000]  and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  not relying on other people to do it for you.
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.000]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.000]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.000]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  Don't buy into the groupthink. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turboforce.
[17:54.000 --> 18:21.000]  Kool-Aid's bad and the Turboforce is good.
[18:21.000 --> 18:33.000]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  There's too much confusion.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  Well, Bob Dylan can write a song.
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.000]  And Jimmy Hendrix can sing it and play the guitar.
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.000]  And they live forever.
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  The longest humanity lives on.
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.000]  We recognize beauty. We recognize strength.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  We connect to the universe that God made.
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  We commune with God. We interface.
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.000]  God experiences the universe through us.
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  We are probes sent out by the Almighty.
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.000]  We experience. We create life.
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  We create diversity.
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.000]  Alright, here's the truth about Donald Trump.
[19:17.000 --> 19:23.000]  Donald Trump is a service-oriented type individual
[19:23.000 --> 19:30.000]  who has messianic instincts.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  There's any real alpha male would trying to lead it in power
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  and believing that they could do things for their people
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  so they'll bust their ass.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  That's called a motivating system. It's like a high-horsepower car.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  And he sees the service economy falling apart.
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  He sees America run down. And he says,
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  why should we sell to the China? We're better than them.
[19:50.000 --> 19:55.000]  He sees the globalist wanting to vandalize America
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  and piss on us because they're a bunch of hunchback
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  new-world-order people.
[20:00.000 --> 20:03.000]  And they want to defile it just like Satanists
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  want to defile a child, just like vandals
[20:05.000 --> 20:09.000]  want to burn down a beautiful building
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  or cut a beautiful woman's nose off.
[20:11.000 --> 20:14.000]  They do it because they're spiritually ugly
[20:14.000 --> 20:17.000]  and we are such incredible beings
[20:17.000 --> 20:22.000]  made in the image of the creator that they want to annihilate us.
[20:22.000 --> 20:28.000]  And so, everything is an exercise of globalist,
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.000]  scexy-like spider power over those of us
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  that are in an embryonic level of human development.
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  But they have full awareness of how powerful they are
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.000]  fundamentally, galactically, universally,
[20:43.000 --> 20:47.000]  envious of our very existence.
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  And they want to rape us and torture us
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.000]  and tear us into pieces and poison us.
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  But it will never raise them up.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  It will never build them up because they're not human.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  And humans can turn their will over to energy that's not human.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  And when they do that, you see what they want.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  All these U.N. officials, the PBS official
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  and all these undercover veritas videos, what do they say?
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.000]  And now at the U.N. publicly, we want to come to your houses,
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  we want to take your children for education.
[21:18.000 --> 21:26.000]  Parents need to be taken, children, give us, give us.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  And that's the spirit right there.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  I'm literally showing you what it looks like.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  It's just, you got to have it.
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  It's like a person starving to death with a big cheeseburger
[21:34.000 --> 21:35.000]  sitting right there.
[21:35.000 --> 21:36.000]  You're in the Sahara Desert.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  This is a big glass of ice water.
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  They just want it so bad they just want to gouge
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  your children's eyes out and tear their tongues out
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  with forks and rape them.
[21:44.000 --> 21:45.000]  And poor battery-asset down their throats
[21:45.000 --> 21:46.000]  and hear them beg for money.
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  They want to put them in cages and sit there
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  while the kid begs for food while they starve to death.
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  They want to take them out every hour and rape them.
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  They want to defile.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  They're going to kill you.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  Have you figured that out yet?
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  They want to inject you and give you cancer
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  and poison you and hurt you because they like it.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  Bill Gates wants to annihilate you.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  Period.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  What does the Bible say?
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  So Trump likes women and golf courses
[22:16.000 --> 22:22.000]  and stakes and lobster tails and human adulation.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  He, of course, he's narcissistic.
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  That's what the left calls anyone that believes in themselves
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  or cares about themselves, has an image.
[22:29.000 --> 22:30.000]  Oh, that's narcissistic.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  That's all just mumbo-globalist, satanic jumbo.
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  None of it means anything.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  They label human behaviors and traits
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  and then act like they invented that
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  and created it in their God,
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  and all it is is a satanic pervert pedophile.
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  Go, Segment Freud.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  I mean, Freud, Skinner, all of them were pedophiles.
[22:48.000 --> 22:51.000]  My God, they admitted it.
[22:51.000 --> 22:52.000]  That's just the beginning,
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  screwing a five-year-old girl or boy.
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  They want to kill you.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  They want your soul.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  They want your energy.
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.000]  They want desperation in children
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  because that's like nails on a chalkboard to God,
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  and God will get pissed and allow devils to take over
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  if people don't stand up.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  So the Satanists know what they're doing.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  They train you to accept evil.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  So let me get back to Trump.
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  Trump thought he could go in there
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  and defeat these people,
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  and he's never been a devil worshiper.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  But he did whatever was popular.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  But as he felt the real evil,
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  he got closer to God because his wife is a Christian.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  And he felt the energy of God and Christ
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  empowering him and got into that energy and that mission.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  This Trump's an energy guy.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  He doesn't believe in religions and names and this or that.
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  We've had conversations about the energy.
[23:48.000 --> 23:53.000]  And so the enemy let Trump get in.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  He did win by landslide the first time and the second time.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  They let him get in to energize the left
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  and then have people reject controlled borders,
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  reject law and order, reject populism, reject jobs,
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  reject an optimistic future and to say,
[24:07.000 --> 24:11.000]  no, we want an evil pedophile communist Chinese zombie
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  and an evil prosecutor that was so vicious to black people,
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  she's legendary.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  I mean, just, she would just literally go,
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  you're black, I'm giving you triple the sentence.
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.000]  They would say, why?
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  She said, I mean, she's just, I mean, add off Hitler.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  So when blacks knew it,
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  she was like, listen, a half percent support rate with blacks.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  Like, why would the globals do that?
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  It's about force feeding, making you give up,
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.000]  making you not believe it.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  Like Pelosi's like, oh, people burn stuff.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  People do what they do.
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.000]  It's a good thing.
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  And meanwhile, a few dozen people break a few things.
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  They get killed.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  And the media's like, it was Pearl Harbor the worst day ever.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  That's supposed to be oxymoronic.
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.000]  But yes, Trump buys into science, buys into the professionals.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  He doesn't get any of the eugenics.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.000]  He doesn't get it's on purpose.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  He projects his own decency on people.
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.000]  Trump just likes to have fun.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  He's got a lot of energy,
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.000]  but he projects his own decency on you and me and the globalist.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  And hey, it's well founded when he projects it on you,
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  but it's not well founded with the establishment.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  And so they put him in, they let him get in to charge up the left
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  with hatred, with the 10 minutes of hate to do anything
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  and to accept any level of tyranny,
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  including celebrating killing Trump supporters
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  and putting us on the fly list and taking our bank accounts away.
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  Literal authoritarian blueprint, these signature blueprint,
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  because they've turned their will over through that manipulation.
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  Like tug a war with a dog.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  And the more you tug, you're bringing towards a cliff.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  And the dog doesn't recognize that you're going sideways
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.000]  while you're tugging.
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.000]  He's not looking.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  He goes off the cliff.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  They've got us right there.
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  So I should have done a better job reaching out to the left
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  and all these groups and really talking directly to them.
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  And it's been that potential I've had that the enemy fears doesn't want.
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  And I should teach and I should cover the globalist
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  at different angles of it and philosophy.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  And like I said, break the left-right paradigm,
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  because the Republicans and Democrats are part of the same system.
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.000]  You see that again right now.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  Trump was a populist movement.
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  It was powerful, but I put too much hope in it.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  You did as well.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  And then the Q thing is, again, a way to lead our movement
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  with a lot of legitimate stuff and covering real topics that are there
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  and doing a lot of good so people believe it
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.000]  when it gives you the orders to carry out the violence
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  so then they can set us all up.
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.000]  So we just have to tell it like it is
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  and not try to win popularity contest.
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  Seven days till Trump's gone.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  150-something hours.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  And Biden's going to hit the ground running
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  with false flag terror attacks and more.
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  We'll tell you what's coming next according to the enemy blueprint.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  We could change the blueprint, though, if we expose it.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  And if we pray.
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[26:50.000 --> 27:16.000]  This is The Info War.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  In all 50 states coming up on the 20th and before that.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  You are being set up.
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  I was there in D.C. with a million peaceful people.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  And I watched Antifa and other leftist groups
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  pose our people and set us up.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  Thank God the Patriots did not engage in the rioting.
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  So only a few people did it.
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  So the thing was a misfire.
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  It was a dud.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  But the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters terrorist
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  and they're planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20th
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  to blame the American people.
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  Do not be part of it.
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  We are peaceful.
[27:53.000 --> 28:22.000]  We are not violent.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  We say everything.
[28:23.000 --> 28:24.240]  We are violent.
[28:28.080 --> 28:30.000]  In this one minute ad, I don't have time to tell you all about it.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  Believe me, I have wanted it back.
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.960]  It's natural.
[28:36.960 --> 28:39.000]  It's unnatural.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.960]  It creates a natural occurrence.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.600]  The branch doesn't say anything.

[31:26.720 --> 31:32.800]  like q exposed the pedophilia oh q did oh two and a half years ago glad that glad they came around
[31:32.800 --> 31:37.520]  took credit for all this stuff and that's not what i care about but it's like it's like a mouse that
[31:37.520 --> 31:41.440]  says well that's a pretty nice piece of cheese right there you know one mouse is named bob the other
[31:41.440 --> 31:46.000]  mouse is named bill and bob goes that's a big old piece of cheddar cheese it smells good
[31:48.080 --> 31:54.000]  he goes hey bob bill says bob that's a mousetrap i saw my brother killed by one of those a few
[31:54.000 --> 32:00.720]  months ago had a big old piece of peanut butter on it it smelled even better and luckily he went

[32:08.080 --> 32:17.600]  metal jaw you don't want to go and bob looks at bill and he goes bill there's no such thing
[32:17.600 --> 32:25.360]  you just want the cheese so the mouse starts walking over towards it and bill says to bob
[32:27.040 --> 32:31.520]  please you're my cousin there's plenty of grain outside you know there's a pond over there we
[32:31.520 --> 32:38.240]  can find some food we get that garbage thing at the back of the place trust me i promise you
[32:39.200 --> 32:44.560]  i'll go find you some cheese and bring it to you please and bob looks at bill and says shut up
[32:44.560 --> 32:49.680]  pushes him aside and just goes right over and goes snap breaks the net
[32:53.760 --> 32:58.800]  and then the next week another trap gets put out and bill's out there again this time going
[32:58.800 --> 33:04.960]  do not get near it people say oh you just don't want us to have the cheese you're just jealous
[33:04.960 --> 33:11.200]  of the cheese like please no i don't please listen i was already here before you i could have had the
[33:11.200 --> 33:20.000]  cheese trust me it'll kill you well why do you care about me and that's the key those mice don't
[33:20.000 --> 33:25.280]  care about other mice not all mice are like that not all people are like that and so when someone
[33:25.280 --> 33:32.160]  sees you warning them these satanists these fallen people the minions the first rule is they're selfish
[33:32.960 --> 33:38.560]  they think when you're warning them you've got an angle they think that you care that it's like
[33:38.560 --> 33:48.240]  you're trying to show off you know i i have a lot of family that got paralyzed or or or got very sick
[33:49.200 --> 33:54.960]  from vaccines i mean most my family did and all of you family got sick too you know that i mean
[33:57.200 --> 34:01.360]  there are two people in this building right now whose children died from vaccines on record just
[34:01.360 --> 34:09.600]  dead one of them one person that lost their child has an extra neighbor whose mother got
[34:09.600 --> 34:14.400]  paralyzed last week from the shot so you know that's just two houses in one neighborhood
[34:14.400 --> 34:19.680]  noscow one person's got a dead child other person's got a paralyzed mother i mean but oh it's not
[34:19.680 --> 34:26.320]  going to be on the news ladies and gentlemen and the globalists that's why they've come to me
[34:26.320 --> 34:35.600]  and they said jones people are going to evolve to submit to us they don't deserve to live the fact
[34:35.600 --> 34:41.680]  that you understand this means you're one of us and i go really the fact that i see what you're
[34:41.680 --> 34:48.240]  doing it makes me you and they go yeah no you have an intelligence but you've turned it over to evil
[34:48.240 --> 34:56.080]  i have a basic intelligence and i don't feel good hurting people i don't like that
[34:59.920 --> 35:05.520]  i don't like being a bad person i don't like cheating people and and so that's what it comes
[35:05.520 --> 35:10.800]  down to so to all the liberals all the conservatives all the christians the buddhists the muslims the
[35:10.800 --> 35:15.280]  agnostics whatever you are you selfish satanists that call yourself satanist because it's cool to
[35:15.280 --> 35:20.080]  tell somebody you're a satanist you know at a bar or whatever it's not cool you just think it means
[35:20.080 --> 35:25.840]  you're a libertarian or selfish but that's your satanism it's not the real one now real satanism
[35:25.840 --> 35:30.880]  is about pushing past boundaries and doing really really destructive hateful things of hurting people
[35:30.880 --> 35:38.000]  and not caring and being a predator and not in a respectful way like you'd kill a deer and then
[35:38.000 --> 35:43.520]  harvest it for the food no no you're you're killing people's dreams you're stealing people's
[35:43.520 --> 35:49.520]  destinies you're hurting the loving energy on this planet you're not good people your failures and
[35:49.520 --> 35:55.280]  it's why you're also scrawny and ugly and sick because you're losers that the satanic system
[35:55.280 --> 36:00.400]  crushed and now you've gone the thing that abused you hoping you could get power by the thing that
[36:00.400 --> 36:08.160]  abused you when all it will do is continue to destroy you you people are seeking out for power
[36:08.160 --> 36:13.680]  or you will get so much power from the holy ghost that you will be ashamed of yourself
[36:13.680 --> 36:18.800]  and what you were and you will not even know how to deal with it because god is infinitely
[36:18.800 --> 36:26.320]  greater than that just the reflected energy from the godhead is so incredible it is in
[36:26.320 --> 36:31.200]  a trillion leagues above lucifer and the selfish devils of the field
[36:31.200 --> 36:38.800]  all right i gotta hit the world news to get on all the temporal stuff but
[36:40.160 --> 36:44.000]  the pope is a satanic high priest publicly
[36:47.920 --> 36:53.680]  all the major capitals except for brazil and maybe a few eastern european countries are in the
[36:53.680 --> 37:05.280]  cold of the wicked one and so the allegory is you're standing at a ski slope and it looks like
[37:05.280 --> 37:08.960]  there's been a big torrential snow that i before and they've got the slopes closed because the
[37:08.960 --> 37:13.840]  danger of avalanche they're about to fire some mortars up there to you know to cause an avalanche
[37:14.480 --> 37:19.600]  and you're some other understands this and you're a mountain manager and people show up they go oh
[37:19.600 --> 37:23.920]  we're gonna hike up there you go no i'm sorry it's closed there's an avalanche danger they're
[37:23.920 --> 37:27.280]  like well i don't see any avalanche you know just believe me it there's gonna be an avalanche
[37:27.280 --> 37:33.680]  probably the next hour we're just waiting okay and it's the same thing where they think you're
[37:33.680 --> 37:40.160]  showing off to them we're not showing off about this this is life and death we've gone over the
[37:40.160 --> 37:46.400]  edge now okay we're in it we're falling fast like you think things are unrecognizable now
[37:46.400 --> 37:53.840]  now in in five years ladies and gentlemen as fast as this is moving a third of your block is gonna
[37:53.840 --> 37:59.120]  have cancer in 10 years half your blocks gonna have cancer lot'll survive but you're gonna go out
[37:59.120 --> 38:04.000]  in 10 years if we're even here anymore and there'll be people with walkers and people with pus bags
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.840]  on their heads and and and weird chemical injectors on them and you're gonna be getting vaccines
[38:07.840 --> 38:11.760]  every month just to try to be able to have a job and they're just and it's just well we just it's
[38:11.760 --> 38:16.720]  what happens now you know covid kills everybody now and they just keep giving us vaccines to try
[38:16.720 --> 38:22.080]  to counter the covid but it's not it's the vaccines and the 5g and the gmo that's killing you
[38:22.080 --> 38:29.440]  they're killing you they're killing you oh you can be a former us attorney that's now a congresswoman
[38:29.440 --> 38:34.960]  who put out a big fake article that that that oh congressman had ali alexander in the capital
[38:35.520 --> 38:40.160]  and they were casing it out the day before and she saw them and she wants them all arrested
[38:40.160 --> 38:46.320]  because he was he was reconning it she knows that's all i and then they put a daily mail

[39:12.000 --> 39:15.520]  jonathan gruber it's the daily mail and i'm going to pull it up jonathan gruber
[39:18.320 --> 39:26.720]  got up on c-span and said to all these top professors i'm going to teach you how to lie

[39:29.840 --> 39:34.880]  i'm the i was chosen triple prizes on obama care and direct the system and i'm really there's

[39:57.760 --> 40:01.680]  man i'm just working as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you
[40:01.680 --> 40:07.520]  i love you man i want to uh make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it
[40:07.520 --> 40:12.080]  quite a while and i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that
[40:12.080 --> 40:18.960]  it contains quercetin which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited
[40:19.680 --> 40:26.720]  is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so
[40:26.720 --> 40:32.800]  people might want to take a look at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at
[40:32.800 --> 40:37.600]  these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the
[40:37.600 --> 40:41.120]  doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive products and it was
[40:41.120 --> 40:46.320]  really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together
[40:46.320 --> 40:49.040]  and that's what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug
[40:49.040 --> 40:57.760]  the poke came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance
[40:57.760 --> 41:02.800]  to redistribute wealth create a planetary universal income which of course the united
[41:02.800 --> 41:06.640]  nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a

[41:24.000 --> 41:31.280]  fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all and the rejection starts with
[41:31.280 --> 41:37.360]  realizing its spiritual battle diverse evil and stopping abortion we must start valuing human life
[41:37.360 --> 41:44.000]  again we must start saying that we are not expendable that we are not disposable that we are
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.720]  essential until we do that we are all slaves we must stand up and declare our basic god-given human

[44:20.800 --> 44:24.640]  choose the energy god or the devil you have free will
[44:33.600 --> 44:38.320]  when you look at the left contradicting everything they say saying violence is good burning down
[44:38.320 --> 44:43.360]  cities but then a few people break a few things and steal a lector and sit in Pelosi's chair
[44:43.360 --> 44:47.440]  and they say it's the end of the world shoot for you know shoot people and kill them and then one
[44:47.440 --> 44:54.960]  cop dies of a heart attack and that's pearl harbor that's for people under their spell
[44:54.960 --> 45:01.520]  under schumer spell to believe we just survived pearl harbor let's give everybody purple hearts
[45:03.520 --> 45:07.280]  but then obama goes yeah i'm pretty good at killing people with drones yeah so what we probably
[45:07.280 --> 45:12.480]  use a kill about 50 innocent people when i kill one person but i'm liberal so it's all right
[45:12.480 --> 45:17.840]  right you know yeah i guess we fire bombed resident two in world war two but when obama
[45:17.840 --> 45:22.640]  does it's good but when bush did it's bad see and you're like well that's oxymoronic it's supposed
[45:22.640 --> 45:30.480]  to be this is psychiatry this is psychology and to boil it down to just real common law
[45:30.480 --> 45:36.320]  or the universe terms it's evil it's unjust it's it's it's it's fraud and the brain gets to where
[45:36.320 --> 45:42.240]  it either accepts it and then starts malfunctioning by all the fraud and all the lies or you transcend
[45:42.240 --> 45:48.800]  it and stand against it there's no middle road here that's why god said he was hot nor cold so
[45:48.800 --> 45:54.960]  i spit him out of my mouth hot or cold don't ride the fence don't stand in the middle of the road
[45:54.960 --> 45:59.920]  that's a bad place to be but they teach you oh just stay neutral there's no such thing
[46:01.520 --> 46:06.000]  there never has been so we've got you know all these Pelosi clips i guess i could play it
[46:06.720 --> 46:10.960]  next hour where she's like hey they're burning stuff down and they're pulling down statues
[46:10.960 --> 46:14.000]  they're killing people and she's like well people are going to do what people do
[46:16.320 --> 46:23.360]  oh but then oh but then oh i mean most of video there's like hours of people
[46:23.920 --> 46:33.280]  walking into the capital in between the velvet ropes i mean look at this look at this this is
[46:33.280 --> 46:37.120]  the japanese attack at pearl harbor that you imagine going yes where there are a few fights the doors
[46:37.120 --> 46:41.680]  the cop get crushed was it wrong yeah this happens at big football games all the time much worse
[46:41.680 --> 46:46.960]  you'll have like 15 dead at a soccer game is it the end of the world we all gonna have micro chips
[46:46.960 --> 46:53.200]  up our nose now you know troops on the streets because they didn't have adequate crowd control
[46:53.200 --> 46:58.720]  and because antifa and yes some right wing groups with them working together broke in because the
[46:58.720 --> 47:02.960]  accelerationist agreed with the anti for the boogaloo boys we now know we're there
[47:02.960 --> 47:06.080]  they're wearing their orange hats
[47:09.120 --> 47:11.840]  and they were gonna start the revolution well it didn't happen
[47:13.440 --> 47:17.120]  because people ideologically don't know what's going on and because taking selfies
[47:17.120 --> 47:22.080]  is not a revolution so this guy's got a stick in his hand he's smart up cover his face up for
[47:22.080 --> 47:27.760]  the facial recognition and you've got homeland security leading them through and people ask
[47:27.760 --> 47:33.040]  like why are they taking selfies with them because they're trying to not get the crowd out of control
[47:33.040 --> 47:37.120]  we can ask the capital cop the game the order for the stand down why he did her who told him but
[47:37.120 --> 47:38.480]  he's dead bullet in the head
[47:42.800 --> 47:49.280]  so three thousand plus dead is now four dead citizens one dead cop you let us make sense it's
[47:49.280 --> 47:58.080]  not supposed to also georgia man charged at us capital attack dies by suicide gunshot the chest
[47:58.080 --> 48:02.400]  they were there with zip ties man q was ordering it that we were gonna everybody was going to get
[48:02.400 --> 48:05.600]  bo was gonna happen and i said no it's not gonna happen
[48:09.680 --> 48:16.320]  so let's look at uganda uganda bans all social media head of election sparking outrage well
[48:16.320 --> 48:20.160]  all that facebook and twitter does is ban any nationals or conservatives ahead of elections
[48:20.160 --> 48:24.160]  that's what they basically do i mean trump's been blocked off youtube now so he can't call for
[48:24.160 --> 48:27.920]  peace he called for peace yesterday three times none of it's out there because they want to say
[48:27.920 --> 48:32.720]  he's not gone for peace see how that works they silence you not just to silence you they silence
[48:32.720 --> 48:39.120]  you so they can then say every day on the national news alex jones is sending people to the families
[48:39.120 --> 48:45.040]  of sandy hook homes right now he's attacking their homes he must be taken off air never said do that
[48:45.040 --> 48:50.880]  ever never even they just keep saying it though because i can't respond that's how they operate
[48:51.920 --> 48:59.120]  it's funny to them so look at this meltdown twitter says uganda votes basic human rights now
[48:59.120 --> 49:06.640]  listen to this some of the best unintentional satire ever by jack dorsi ahead of the ugandan
[49:06.640 --> 49:11.440]  election we're hearing reports that internet service providers are being ordered to block
[49:11.440 --> 49:17.520]  social media and messaging apps we strongly condemn internet shutdowns they are hugely harmful
[49:17.520 --> 49:27.600]  violate basic human rights and the principles of an open internet wow and pelosi our election was
[49:27.600 --> 49:33.760]  hijacked there's no question congress has a duty but hey are you going to stop the burning and the
[49:33.760 --> 49:37.200]  fires and the killing well people are going to do what people are going to do in fact let's play
[49:37.200 --> 49:41.520]  that first let's take a carlson clip but here's here's pelosi people are going to do what people
[49:41.520 --> 49:45.600]  are going to do here it is by a respectfully shouldn't that be done by a commission or the
[49:45.600 --> 49:49.200]  city council not a mob in the middle of the night throwing it into the harbor people will do what they
[49:49.200 --> 49:58.080]  do it's a it is uh i do think that from a safety standpoint uh it would be a good idea to uh have
[49:58.080 --> 50:01.680]  it taken down if the community there's a cell on a gun killed him i don't know that it has to be a
[50:01.680 --> 50:08.080]  commission um but it just could be a community so if somebody walked in pelosi god forbid it turned
[50:08.080 --> 50:15.360]  to a martyr seriously and stabbed her in the neck would that just oh people put on our tombstone
[50:15.360 --> 50:20.560]  people do what they do no lady that's not how it works stop assaulting us trying to get us to attack
[50:20.560 --> 50:25.920]  using play the victim you hunch back devil worshiping witch who will burn in hell god has got you in
[50:25.920 --> 50:31.440]  his cross there's not us vengeance is mine say it the lord i'm going to play the second carlson clip

[51:05.920 --> 51:10.880]  a one-year supply at info or store dot com but the main sub site is prepare with alex dot com
[51:10.880 --> 51:12.880]  here's tucker carlson knocking it out of the park
[51:17.120 --> 51:22.800]  oh my general woman it's been a very tough week in the united states of america a spasm of mob
[51:22.800 --> 51:28.400]  violence followed by an unprecedented crackdown on our basic civil liberties this is the darkest
[51:28.400 --> 51:35.040]  time many americans can remember but even in the midst of this disaster there have been flashes of
[51:35.040 --> 51:39.840]  comedy and we're grateful for every one of them we got one today it was a statement from a group
[51:39.840 --> 51:46.080]  called the global public policy team at twitter now i mean you may have thought twitter was just a
[51:46.080 --> 51:52.400]  social media company run by some bearded ethereal pothead in downtown san francisco but not anymore
[51:52.400 --> 51:57.920]  while you were sleeping twitter got bigger than you ever imagined it could twitter is now an
[51:57.920 --> 52:03.200]  independent nation state with its own national security council an interagency constellation
[52:03.200 --> 52:09.840]  of foreign policy experts whose job it is to manage the world's affairs so twitter's global
[52:09.840 --> 52:16.080]  public policy team is really the company's own nsc so the global public policy people weighed in
[52:16.080 --> 52:22.160]  today as security councils do on the upcoming elections in uganda and here's what they said
[52:22.160 --> 52:27.680]  about those elections quote ahead of you gondon election we're hearing reports that internet
[52:27.680 --> 52:33.760]  service providers are being ordered to block social media and messaging apps we strongly
[52:33.760 --> 52:40.480]  condemn internet shutdowns they are hugely harmful violate basic human rights and the
[52:40.480 --> 52:47.760]  principles of the hashtag open internet access to information and freedom of expression including
[52:47.760 --> 52:54.000]  the public conversation on twitter is never more important than during the democratic processes
[52:54.000 --> 53:03.040]  particularly elections end quote so marinated in that a bit just let it sink in twitter is
[53:03.040 --> 53:10.640]  reminding the Ugandan people that censorship is immoral sorry Ugandans you're not allowed to
[53:10.640 --> 53:15.440]  silence other people's twitter especially during election in the run up to an election you just
[53:15.440 --> 53:21.600]  can't do that now we recognize you don't have a bill of rights or a centuries old tradition
[53:21.600 --> 53:27.200]  of self-government out there in uganda so you might not have known this as we do here but to
[53:27.200 --> 53:35.440]  restate censoring voters social media accounts is hugely harmful online censorship violates quote
[53:35.440 --> 53:42.320]  basic human rights in fact it's an attack on democracy itself got that Ugandans now we understand
[53:42.320 --> 53:47.840]  you're a primitive developing nation so we'll give you a pass this time but don't forget it
[53:48.480 --> 53:58.000]  censorship bad hashtag open internet it's almost too good it is in fact we check to see if it was
[53:58.000 --> 54:04.960]  real it's actually sent that it's real which only proves that the tech monopolies are even worse
[54:04.960 --> 54:10.960]  than we thought they were not only are they cruelly authoritarian and totally dishonest as well as
[54:10.960 --> 54:19.040]  limitlessly ambitious but they are also and we didn't know this childishly stupid they have no idea
[54:19.040 --> 54:24.240]  how they appear to know it's done on purpose they can't see themselves they will ask you for clips
[54:24.240 --> 54:28.960]  on info wars dot com no Tucker this is psych warfare this is meant to train you to accept
[54:28.960 --> 54:33.280]  absurdity and that it's a double standard system that's why all the globalists and the cops in the
[54:33.280 --> 54:38.480]  blue cities they go out to eat they have parties they don't wear masks you wear masks you're not
[54:38.480 --> 54:45.120]  essential they're essential oh no there's this is all done by design Tucker fox has betrayed
[54:45.120 --> 54:50.080]  president trump as i predicted they would they've always been part of the establishment and it's
[54:50.080 --> 54:55.920]  only going to get worse if they're able to keep trump from rightfully taking office for a second term
[54:55.920 --> 55:01.280]  ontarian 20th the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic they are
[55:01.280 --> 55:05.760]  going to explode gas prices they're going to shut down our coal power plants they're going to cut
[55:05.760 --> 55:11.200]  off the energy source to us so it's impossible for factories to move back here this is economic
[55:11.200 --> 55:16.080]  domination this is economic war we're being consolidated we're being taken over the democrats
[55:16.080 --> 55:21.440]  aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states they're consolidating power and control to bankrupt
[55:21.440 --> 55:27.040]  the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure
[55:27.040 --> 55:32.720]  and property this is a monopolistic takeover that's what the great reset is clout swab and these other
[55:32.720 --> 55:38.720]  criminals admit it that's what social distancing is so your business is only a 25 for several more
[55:38.720 --> 55:47.040]  years no small businesses will be there this is a master plan say no i want to warn all patriots
[55:47.040 --> 55:51.520]  in the united states and across the world that let's think of my voice i'm alex jones about this
[55:51.520 --> 55:58.880]  fight 27 years i've studied every angle of their operations and i'm here to tell you as clear as
[55:58.880 --> 56:05.440]  day they have organizations on message boards and other groups posing as patriot leaders
[56:05.440 --> 56:11.600]  and posing as president trump anonymously telling you to have our marches in all 50 states coming up
[56:11.600 --> 56:18.160]  on the 20th and before that you are being set up i was there in dc with a million peaceful people
[56:18.160 --> 56:24.000]  and i watch antifa and other leftist groups poses our people and set us up thank god the
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.400]  patriots did not engage in the rioting so only a few people did it so the thing was a misfire it
[56:30.400 --> 56:35.840]  was a dud but the left is hungry to declare all trump supporters terrorist and they're planning
[56:35.840 --> 56:41.840]  terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20 to blame the american people do not be part of it
[56:41.840 --> 56:57.760]  we are peaceful we are not violent you're listening to the alex jones show
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.520]  well this will be a week of action um and today we will seek a unanimous consent request to bring
[57:07.520 --> 57:14.320]  up a resolution authored by congressman jamie raskin to demand that the vice president invoke
[57:14.320 --> 57:19.280]  the 25th amendment i expect the republicans will object so tomorrow the rules committee which i chair
[57:19.280 --> 57:25.440]  will provide a rule to bring that the legislation to the floor we will vote on it and then in 24
[57:25.440 --> 57:30.320]  hours later we will go back to the rules committee and then bring another resolution to deal with
[57:30.320 --> 57:36.160]  the issue of impeachment what this president did is unconscionable and he needs to be held to account
[57:36.160 --> 57:44.800]  heavy we came close to half of the house nearly dying on wednesday and if a foreign head of state
[57:44.800 --> 57:51.200]  if another head of state came in and ordered an attack on the united states congress would we
[57:51.760 --> 57:56.720]  say that that should not be prosecuted should we would we say that there should be absolutely no
[57:56.720 --> 58:03.520]  response to that no it is an act of insurrection trump got buffalode and threatened with the
[58:03.520 --> 58:08.720]  amendment and he didn't know that they gave briefings to the congressman that over a hundred
[58:08.720 --> 58:13.280]  anti-foot were on record coming there to pose his patriots to try to lead an assault on the
[58:13.280 --> 58:18.640]  capital i didn't figure they could trick patriots to do it but the police stood down we now know
[58:18.640 --> 58:22.720]  we have the footage of that the only reason they are not stopped is because they are working for
[58:22.720 --> 58:27.680]  the deep state and the government and they're giving uh trump supporters false hope and building
[58:27.680 --> 58:35.440]  them towards revolution and we've got to decry time and again stop believing in false disinformation
[58:36.320 --> 58:41.280]  this is the reality out to wake up and everyone realized that what happened on wednesday should
[58:41.280 --> 58:46.000]  ever go down in our history and remember this was a deep state operation in concert with the
[58:46.000 --> 58:51.120]  capital police not necessarily every one of the capital policemen but the higher ups who when they
[58:51.120 --> 58:55.200]  asked him you know what do i do about all these people to get say let him in somebody gave the
[58:55.200 --> 59:00.960]  order to let him in and instead oh it's all trumps follow he got the big crowd there to do this no
[59:00.960 --> 59:06.400]  he was not even done speaking he had even started speaking imagine turning on the joe scarborough
[59:06.400 --> 59:14.800]  show on msnbc where a guest repeatedly refers to trump supporters as neo nazis as neo nazis imagine
[59:14.800 --> 59:20.960]  turning on cnn where don lemon and he has a few guests in there mocking the mental intelligence
[59:20.960 --> 59:27.120]  of trump supporters the media have played a huge huge role in what's going on in this country
[59:27.120 --> 59:34.720]  and they're exploiting now what took place on capitol hill trying to silence silence conservatives
[59:34.720 --> 59:39.760]  silence republicans and unfortunately a lot of republicans are buckling we need to speak out
[59:39.760 --> 59:45.040]  against violence we need to speak out against what happened on capitol hill or at the white house
[59:45.040 --> 59:51.920]  or at the portland courthouse we need to reject all this violence but what about the media here's
[59:51.920 --> 59:58.240]  the headline the next day after the breach of capitol hill in the new york times trump
[59:59.040 --> 1:00:05.760]  insights mob this is martial law training martial law training wheels with the checkpoints and the
[1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:12.080]  covet lockdowns and coming to people's houses and the covet task force trackers and the tracker apps
[1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:17.520]  those are training wheels on a big old motorcycle to hell the training wheels are bad martial law
[1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:25.120]  themselves but what comes next is absolutely hellish you know what we have seen is the birth
[1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:31.600]  of a domestic terrorist movement this is not going away donald trump has radicalized
[1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:38.000]  his most fringe supporters he has given them permission he's given them license to be violent
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  to do anything necessary they in their own minds believe themselves to be some sort of revolutionary
[1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:50.000]  these are very dangerous people they're not going away anytime soon so we're gonna have to make sure
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.960]  that we are working hand in hand with the biden administration when it comes into office very
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:59.520]  soon here to put the people in place within the national security apparatus apparatus of law
[1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:07.600]  enforcement so that we can deal with this in the years to come yes you could say the expiration
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:14.800]  date is up on trump but then man is the expiration date really up on biden and communism and the new
[1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:19.120]  world order and the pedophiles and all the sick stuff they're doing out in the open not down in
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:23.040]  tunnels they're not down in tunnels right from the kids hell they're on tv doing it with drag

[1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:20.400]  all right i have been studying geopolitics and systems for most of my life i've been under
[1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:26.320]  27 years you know i'll show it's here back live and we're being inundated by militia leaders
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:34.000]  and inundated by other groups saying jones we're about done with you and trump you're not leading
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.800]  a fight against the globalist in an uprising at the state capitals and in dc next week
[1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:47.680]  well good then be done with me because i wanted a million peaceful people there to get a 10 day
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:52.240]  investigation and to overturn the election peacefully but if we're gonna have a violent
[1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:57.280]  revolution it's not going to be people taking selfies inside the capital i saw antifa set it up
[1:03:57.280 --> 1:04:02.320]  i saw them turn a beautiful day into a horrible day and then like oh you're not a man if you don't
[1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:10.880]  go to war first whoever shoots first loses most people were peaceful there 99 the media doesn't
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:16.640]  show you the footage it was live on c-span of folks walking for hours through the rotunda at the
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:22.960]  capital with the velvet ropes they show the few maybe dozen people
[1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:30.400]  that did a photo op attacked the police then the police ordered to stand down
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:37.680]  under orders they weren't complicit with false flag they were under orders
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:46.000]  and you saw the rest happen and so you know i've even seen nick pointe so i think
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:51.920]  a smart guy say you know we're hearing from people jones that this was mainly antifa
[1:04:51.920 --> 1:04:55.440]  started this no this was patria it's one of their yeah after antifa started the fight
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:59.600]  and after the cops attacked a peaceful crowd and then they stood down then people just went in
[1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:03.680]  yeah that's true nick and i get we're in a country we can have a declaration of independence
[1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:08.400]  and i get we've been abused by the globalists and i get that they're saying they can have
[1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:12.000]  violence against us so your argument is when are we to stop being wimps what i'm telling you is
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:18.640]  is we're winning politically trump won a landslide and biden is going to blow up in their face
[1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:22.800]  and biden is as crooked as a dog's back leg and as a barrel of snakes
[1:05:25.600 --> 1:05:32.320]  and they need to legitimize him by having a big terror attack or truck bomb or mass shooting
[1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:36.160]  coming up this weekend in the next week to legitimize marshal law i mean
[1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:42.960]  i mean someone someone that can play checkers can understand this the enemy wants to fight
[1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:49.760]  on their time in their way now they start doing forced inoculations they start taking people
[1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:56.080]  to fema centers they send their contact traces around man that look look look those of you
[1:05:56.080 --> 1:06:00.000]  looking for a war are probably going to get what you're looking for i got a suspicion you're not
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:03.840]  going to be there when it actually happens you want to sit back and watch a train wreck
[1:06:03.840 --> 1:06:10.320]  so i mobilize the event i've gotten the blame for the event i went there to show a peaceful event
[1:06:10.320 --> 1:06:18.400]  like we always have trump thought this was peaceful oh the militia they're the real men
[1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:22.800]  they're like john wane never in the military doesn't know how to load a gun right but you
[1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:27.840]  know he's our commander nothing against john wane a patriot a great guy like his movies but i mean
[1:06:27.840 --> 1:06:34.800]  i mean there's called larping and larpers love larpers i'm not a larper i'm an american patriot
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:44.560]  with eight generations of texans and family back to the mayflower on both sides baby i don't have
[1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:52.400]  to tell you my pedigree i've proven my medal in the war in 27 years but i will decide for me personally
[1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:57.360]  when i'm ready to get physical and that means i fail that we have to go to that point but i'll
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:01.520]  assure you this it won't be careful police that are getting killed if a revolution's led by alice
[1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:08.560]  jones uh you can bet your bottom dollar i want the police of military with me and this entire
[1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:16.000]  operation is about turning them against us when we act like a bunch of idiots so all you little
[1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:24.880]  so-called generals that can't tie your shoelaces do not attempt to tell me about war this is a war
[1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:31.920]  war politics is war and war is politics by another means you've not studied war you've
[1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:40.080]  dressed up in camouflage i can't tell you how many times i've sat there and watched militias
[1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:45.840]  taken over by the feds and set up to carry out something stupid to make the militia look bad
[1:07:45.840 --> 1:07:52.480]  when the militia is a constitutional organ and is wonderful and it should be led by county commissioners
[1:07:52.480 --> 1:07:59.920]  and by the state not cities cities are low-level constitutional and i believe in a national guard
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:08.400]  i believe in civil defense i believe in neighborhood watches i believe in the militia and the second
[1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:14.080]  amendment and biden plans to demonize the second amendment and turn america against the second
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:19.520]  amendment with staged events coming this weekend i saw the people the left the adl the southern
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:26.640]  property law center they have turned their people loose on us i faced their operatives i was infiltrated
[1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:32.960]  by their operatives i dealt with it at point blank range i went to capital police and said let me get
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:39.440]  on your pa system and tell people get out before the woman was killed they wouldn't give it to me
[1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:45.040]  the capital police have a megaphone system on every corner of the building and inside it
[1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:49.840]  for emergencies deafening if they would have said leave now leave now this is an illegal
[1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:56.640]  assembly they would have left they didn't use the damn communication system they wanted us in there

[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:20.560]  situation where the country is right now please well alex you know i think there's a lot to be
[1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:25.040]  optimistic about because america first is ascendant i think all over the world people are beginning
[1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:30.560]  to realize that our political system here in the united states is absolutely broken and i know that
[1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:35.360]  you're not a big fan of the protest i think some funny things happen for instance somebody defecated
[1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:40.480]  on chuck schumer's desk and that puts a smile on my face i like hearing that i like seeing that
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:46.640]  headline i think that's a a small win for humanity when somebody does that and you know the the guy
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:52.240]  took the lectern of the speaker of the house you know i'll say this when the viking shaman
[1:09:52.240 --> 1:09:56.720]  and these people were presiding over congress there were no foreign wars okay we weren't
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:10:01.600]  giving any of our taxpayer dollars to pakistan for gender studies so i was getting calls from
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:07.040]  all over the world including france and italy in the populist movement and people were inspired by
[1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:14.320]  this so yes it seems to have gone disastrously and i wasn't there and you know it didn't seem
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:18.400]  like there was any plan or any rhyme or reason to it and obviously there were agitators in the
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:24.640]  crowd but i think just the act of civil disobedience puts the message out there that americans are at
[1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:29.040]  odds with their government and that's a powerful yes our founders dumped millions of dollars of
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:34.800]  equivalent of tea in the ocean against the tax i get it okay what i'm saying to you is
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:39.680]  if we're gonna launch a war it should be done differently and we played right in their hands
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:43.920]  and i don't want violence this weekend the globalist heather provocateurs everywhere
[1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:48.560]  trying to get violence that's all i'm saying oh absolutely right look i've been fighting the war
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:54.240]  by trying to help president donald trump first get elected in 2016 and then again in 2020 and
[1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:59.520]  there's no question in my mind that we won that election we won it big and then they um
[1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:04.720]  kiboshed us with the paper ballots including ruby freeman with her suitcase ballots you know pulling
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:08.320]  the suitcase ballots down there and hotline and now we're not discussing that we're discussing
[1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:15.040]  the capital fracas that's all i'm saying right and you know look um at every single stage we have
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:19.120]  tried to win this thing in the overtime period we appealed to the state legislatures with the
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:24.400]  rudy the great rudy juliani's hearings and jenna ellis we appealed to mike pence to do his
[1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:30.720]  constitutional duty and as it was reported trump said you know pence you can go down as a heroic
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:37.040]  patriot or you can go down as a p word um i think you know what what he meant but um you know this
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:43.200]  is um a situation where at every single turn we were undermined by the republican party
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:47.040]  the political class this was not the same political class that hated trump all along
[1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:51.120]  finally is getting what they want and you look at the swollen evil turtle mitch mcconnell
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:57.520]  he looks like he's taking four hits of ecstasy he's very happy so going forward the america
[1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:02.960]  first movement is a dissident movement and that's where we need to be look i put a lot of faith in
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:08.800]  president donald trump to reform this system if he finds that in his four years he was unable to
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:13.760]  fundamentally reform the system then we become a distant movement and that's possibly where we
[1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:20.080]  need to be going forward the anger the righteousness of the people is on our side and the entire
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:23.280]  i totally agree and that's why they needed something to change the subject we don't need
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:28.560]  republicans apologizing we need to say oh this is one one millionth as big as your black lives
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:33.360]  matter crap we decried the few idiots that broke a few things and took a dump on his because that's
[1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:38.080]  that's insult to the feces to take a crap and i mean you wouldn't like take dumps into hell that's
[1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:42.480]  a gateway to hell you want to go into his office that's like where the poltergeist lives but i mean
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:47.920]  i get it we we we should just point out that it's an exaggerated mess it's hysterically ridiculous and

[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:19.920]  war the globalists have put in a puppet they're seven days away from it they want to change the
[1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:26.080]  subject to violence as violence all things yes when you've got a good ideology and a group that's
[1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:31.840]  unified and educated and those are targets are but velvet revolutions in the modern sense are
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:37.520]  what are more successful and easier for the globalists launch them 90 percent of war decades
[1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:42.960]  ago was informational now it's 98 percent so i live this and there's a lot of folks like i'm
[1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:48.240]  sick of the un and i'm sick of the devil worshipers and i'm going to start killing people and then
[1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:55.200]  those are being led by feds and by q programmers that's all i'm saying is have we killed 62 million
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:16:00.880]  babies do we have a right to revolt absolutely but what's the target random cops that are innocent
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:07.280]  so that's what i'm getting at and and and so i i think uh gypsy lady as she's known
[1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:12.640]  that got in the face will play this later play in that segment angry gypsy woman they got the face
[1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:17.200]  of schumer that's more like it just call them out with the frauds they are everywhere they go don't
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:22.640]  be violent like the left so again yes it's total hypocrisy but patrick howling i respect your views
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:27.120]  on the election and what's happening you fought hard to expose election fraud but seven days left
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:31.200]  trump needs to resolute desk they didn't carry a speech anywhere basically yesterday
[1:16:31.200 --> 1:16:36.560]  he needs to be hammering china no Pompeo's about to uh with the wuhan revelation that it was a
[1:16:36.560 --> 1:16:42.640]  bio weapon uh i mean all of this he needs to be absolutely out front right now what do you say
[1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:48.240]  absolutely and it was a bio weapon by the way that dr anthony fowchee funded at the wuhan
[1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:53.360]  institute of virology he created it he's the dr frankenstein of coronavirus that little
[1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:58.560]  napoleon complex man and now they are shutting down small business all over the country ruining
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:04.080]  our biggest accomplishment in the trump administration which was the massive amazing economy that we
[1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:08.320]  had and that was the goal i mean bill bill mar and all of us said we're going to kill the economy
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:14.560]  blame trump they did this could literally wage war on the average person that's what they are doing
[1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:20.880]  and that's where we're at and so the oathkeepers within law enforcement need to respond right now
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:26.320]  and say no we're not going to go dragging mom out of her middle school football game
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:31.600]  because she's not wearing a mask we're not going to go and invade somebody's christmas
[1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:37.520]  dinner or their kwanza dinner we're hearing a lot about kwanza i'd you know i i celebrate
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:42.800]  kwanza by the way i celebrate it by watching foxy brown and dolomite but christmas you know
[1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:48.000]  your christmas with your family you've got six people there the cops are gonna bang down your
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:53.680]  door the oathkeepers the real constitutionalists within law enforcement need to stand up to this
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:59.040]  because right now is when they are i agree so i think it's time for civil disobedience that
[1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:03.760]  means that nonviolent that means not taking a dump i know you think it's funny and i get the joke on
[1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:08.960]  chunky schumer but that's insult the crap i mean you know so seriously this crap can be used as
[1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:14.400]  fertilizer schumer has no use except being you know sent to hell later by god but but what else
[1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:20.080]  can trump do yeah well i do i mean i do think it's important to note that this capital police officer
[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:26.320]  who died died of a medical condition the media lied and said it was an attack and also the police
[1:18:26.320 --> 1:18:32.880]  opened fire on ashley they insanely opened fire and you know killed somebody who was on the patriot
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:38.000]  side so this is not sure let's build 2.0 because ashley was on the patriot side a great person
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:43.040]  an air force veteran who wanted to make this country better and is now dead at the hands of the police
[1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:48.320]  you are finally beginning to see the right wing in this country turn against law enforcement turn
[1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:54.000]  against this back the blue you know steadfast well we understand the left was attacking them
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:58.080]  we know they're not perfect but we we support the constitution i agree we need the police to come
[1:18:58.080 --> 1:19:04.960]  out and decry the execution of this poor lady and we should say say her name say her name
[1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:11.920]  yep and the great thing to see as a citizen journalist is that now all over the country
[1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:16.320]  people are taking it to the streets and they're getting up in the faces of these politicians
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:22.640]  you know mit romney on a plane for instance or um you had linsey graham at the airport and all of
[1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:27.360]  these great patriots and trump supporters just would not let linsey graham go and one lady even
[1:19:27.360 --> 1:19:32.880]  said this is the way it's going to be for the rest of your life because you didn't audit the vote
[1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:38.320]  and we got the message out there and there's linsey graham there's the the dandy from south
[1:19:38.320 --> 1:19:45.360]  carolina that masculine very uh high testosterone guy there who sells out our country that trader
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:52.480]  that quizzing and the people are not a few protesters uh that they killed till like now he
[1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:58.560]  has like 20 troops with him i mean it's we're turning into bag dad here yep and these people
[1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:04.400]  are in a higher class and they're a higher caste of society and so now they get the protection
[1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:09.760]  of the state and so you know what citizen journalists are doing it's so amazing you
[1:20:09.760 --> 1:20:14.320]  saw mit romney there being confronted at the airport you saw um you know when he got on
[1:20:14.320 --> 1:20:19.760]  his plane trump supporters chanting trader trader i mean this is a guy who is the republican
[1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:24.960]  nominee for president not long ago people are done with the political class it's a beautiful
[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:29.280]  thing to see it's an amazing thing to see now not all agree that's the good news is there's
[1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:34.000]  a total global realignment against them as my next question he totally stole the election
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:38.080]  they need a violence to like make him look like a victim that's why i'm against the violence
[1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:41.200]  particularly i'm always against it really against it because they they're pushing for it right now
[1:20:41.200 --> 1:20:45.520]  behind the scenes and publicly so what do they do though as the whole world turns against them
[1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:50.800]  even more i agree the world was cheering this and i'm like look it looks good on the surface
[1:20:50.800 --> 1:20:54.880]  until you realize they're going to use this to take our rights and you know and and and and it
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:59.760]  didn't end with polosi getting arrested or whatever because it helped cover up the election fraud
[1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:06.560]  that's coming on in founts yep but it's important to remember that they're accelerating anyway
[1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:12.640]  and so as people look for leadership it's up to guys like us to provide them leadership and
[1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:18.000]  provide them solutions about how to peacefully go forward here and make sure that we protect our
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:23.680]  rights and we protect um you know if you're in a county that's a patriotic county um make sure
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:30.080]  that your sheriff is on your side make sure that you have the power of the state where you are as
[1:21:30.080 --> 1:21:34.640]  best you can and then you can begin to assert yourself and say no i'm not shutting down my
[1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:40.560]  business and then film it and put it out on gab and put it out on perler and these new different
[1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:46.320]  outlets and um get it out there and how incredible is that patrick howley of nationalfall.com
[1:21:46.320 --> 1:21:50.560]  that they always say build your own thing now they're all trying to shut down telegram
[1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:54.640]  they're all trying to shut down gab they're trying to shut down parlor they have shut down parlor for
[1:21:54.640 --> 1:21:59.520]  now i mean this is just total cartel behavior now they've silenced the president of the united
[1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:04.880]  states while he's calling for peace i mean this is crazy we don't have a government anymore that's
[1:22:04.880 --> 1:22:10.080]  even going to pretend to have any responsibility to us we have a regime we have a criminal racket
[1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:13.920]  when you look at who these people are like jake sullivan who has hillary clinton's right hand
[1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:18.640]  guy the guy in the wikileaks emails who said that al-qaeda is on our side over there in the middle
[1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:24.800]  east he's going to be running the nsa tracking your phone calls listening in day in and day out
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:29.840]  trust me jake sullivan knows who i am he's not a fan well you know what i'm not afraid of him
[1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:35.440]  i'm not afraid of that bald weakling jeff bezos or that nerd bill gates who could never get a date
[1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:40.240]  in school these people are trying to inflict their own pathology are you kidding though i mean bill
[1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:45.200]  gates is raping the planet before synoculations so at the end of the day he he laughs laughs
[1:22:45.200 --> 1:22:50.640]  well i don't think so because he hasn't vaccinated me yet i haven't gotten the beam
[1:22:50.640 --> 1:22:57.280]  in 666 vaccine and nobody i know has and so it's not mandatory yet and so um yeah that's
[1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:02.960]  how to use it to travel and are using pcr tests now that federal courts german courts have ruled
[1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:09.600]  are fake they're fake the inventor said it was a fraud even the cdc admitted that you can test
[1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:15.680]  positive with the common cold that's been the case all along nobody believes even normie people
[1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:21.600]  even regular people nobody believes anymore that these numbers on this uh brother we hired a statistician
[1:23:21.600 --> 1:23:25.680]  i've actually got the numbers i've been so busy i haven't put them out yet did you know 61 000 more
[1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:31.760]  people died in 2020 and 2019 61 000 population growth it usually goes above that usually about
[1:23:31.760 --> 1:23:37.840]  70 to 80 000 more die each year population goes up and the population's aging so basically the same
[1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:42.480]  number died last year the year before it's all a fraud it's all a hoax thank you so much my
[1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:46.960]  friend people to find your work at nationalsall.com and alex joneswithinfullwards.gov
[1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:53.840]  legislature's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism other dictionaries have
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:59.600]  somewhere once terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political
[1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:06.000]  or financial reason it's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:12.080]  and that's exactly what all this overblown covid 19 garbage is you see the headlines from cnn abc
[1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:16.720]  knows doctors say it's worse than they ever thought covid more devastating than you'd ever imagine
[1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:22.800]  they told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three

[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:45.280]  30 million dollars of infrastructure equipment that i mean we got the up links everything ourselves
[1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:52.000]  probably not very good for us up there but the point is is that all this is going on we built it
[1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:57.360]  you think your phone just does all that stuff it connects to billions of dollars of equipment
[1:28:57.360 --> 1:29:02.080]  well we have to connect into systems ourselves so infowarstore.com want to thank you all for your
[1:29:02.080 --> 1:29:06.160]  support they really want to stop here at this time now i got dr steve pacinic here on air
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:11.360]  and he was a psychiatrist and worked at the state department psychological warfare and
[1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:16.640]  helped out delta force and he co-wrote the books with tom clancy i mean you know he's a real spook
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:21.840]  spook compared to all the armchair quarterbacks that never actually done anything and he grew up
[1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:26.960]  as a refugee from europe in uh in cuba that came to the u.s and and i like steve he's been on the
[1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:31.840]  show like 19 years he was trying to be optimistic and i think that's why he did it and saying hey
[1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:36.160]  there was some watermarking of ballots i don't think it was done system-wide this election
[1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:39.680]  that was done with the states democrats put out their own fake ballots but he made that prediction
[1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:44.320]  that you know trump would be able to turn this around uh now a lot of things have gone sideways
[1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:47.760]  i want to get his take on that i want to get his take on what happened at the capital uh
[1:29:47.760 --> 1:29:52.320]  provocateur grips trying to stage false flags this weekend uh and and and i know the globalists
[1:29:52.320 --> 1:29:56.320]  are controlling some of the q movement right now they're trying to manipulate us into violence
[1:29:56.320 --> 1:30:01.760]  so there's a lot to cover a just stault of of of the waterfront steve pacinic.com's
[1:30:01.760 --> 1:30:07.280]  his website thanks for joining us what do you want to tackle first it's my pleasure let's first
[1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:15.120]  tackle the fact that we are now officially in a military coup what has happened and why i was
[1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:20.720]  part of it is because i've had a history of doing soft coups in the united states and what we call
[1:30:20.720 --> 1:30:27.520]  hard coups overseas overthrowing regimes using the military in this case we have what we call a hard
[1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:34.480]  coup it was initiated as i said a month and a half ago two months ago by our cyber command using
[1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:40.720]  special forces they were over 400 people from all parts of the intelligence community i won't go into
[1:30:40.720 --> 1:30:47.680]  the names but in effect now we are about to arrest elosi we're going to arrest biden
[1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:54.960]  hunter biden nitt romney you're talking about a whole list of individuals whom i identified on
[1:30:54.960 --> 1:31:02.320]  this show for the years when i said genea haspel has to go she went when i said bar was a cia operative
[1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:07.840]  he went when i told you pants was not to be believed because he came out of a democratic
[1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:14.880]  catholic background became an evangelical christian he led so what's happening now is that we are
[1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:22.320]  literally in a military coup that means in effect this country will watch the arrest that will come
[1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:29.120]  out of this we have already arrested and basically overseas we have taken out the pope whom i have
[1:31:29.120 --> 1:31:35.520]  identified for over 30 years as a terrorist when he was director of the jesuits had killed three of
[1:31:35.520 --> 1:31:42.080]  our american nuns two of our jesuits we arrested a young man from the an older man from the state
[1:31:42.080 --> 1:31:49.200]  department stefan and serene who basically leaked all the information used leonardo the
[1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:56.160]  sites going up to the satellites which were controlled by the vatican we in turn intercepted
[1:31:56.160 --> 1:32:03.520]  all that information and were able to get along with nancy polosi's a computer by the way there
[1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:10.080]  was no rioting in the capital i happened to know three to four people here for my town who said
[1:32:10.080 --> 1:32:15.760]  it was very peaceful the police took down the barriers and in effect what people don't know
[1:32:15.760 --> 1:32:23.120]  is we sent special forces operators in there to take polosi's uh computer now where does this
[1:32:23.120 --> 1:32:30.160]  all fit in number one i wrote about this 27 years ago in state of emergency if anybody wants to
[1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:35.520]  understand what the real coup is about then go to on my site and read state of emergency you'll
[1:32:35.520 --> 1:32:41.680]  listen to the audiobook number two and this is important for you alex to understand and all of
[1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:48.800]  the listeners you were the method through which we were able to implement the coup it wasn't when
[1:32:48.800 --> 1:32:55.840]  you used to ask me how did i know what i was doing or how well how could i predict it the truth was
[1:32:55.840 --> 1:33:02.480]  and still is and by the way you did an excellent interview with my friend the truth is you were
[1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:09.440]  the vehicle through which i was promoting the unnecessary actions that had to be accomplished
[1:33:09.440 --> 1:33:17.360]  think of that for a moment you were the first entity as a band video you identified 19 years ago
[1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:24.880]  when you came forth and i associated with you on 9 11 subsequently many generals and special forces
[1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:31.920]  and cyber command and nfa elsewhere understood that the wars that were created by cheney who will
[1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:39.440]  be under arrest the coward that he was and the avoidance of going into the draft by mit romney
[1:33:39.440 --> 1:33:45.920]  amorman who will also be arrested for the corruption he committed with bank capital and elsewhere he
[1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:53.760]  will probably be desanctified from the lds all of these elements came out through you alex jones
[1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:58.640]  the reason we never used the new york times we didn't do the washington post we didn't do any of the
[1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:04.160]  others we understood who controlled them i knew about the murdoch family from the day they came
[1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:12.160]  over in 1958 i never trusted murdoch i didn't trust his family what people didn't know unfortunately
[1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:19.280]  is that murdoch's mother's an orthodox jew and he is a totally corrupt individual and a coward
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:25.200]  along with his family who brought in all of these stations and eventually kicked you and others off
[1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:32.400]  of it so you were chosen as the method through which we could initiate a military coup okay well
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:38.640]  we didn't talk about this beforehand and i and i certainly don't want any type of i went to have
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:43.280]  a peaceful demonstration to show our numbers to expose election fraud so how does a bunch of people
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:48.160]  acting like idiots in the capital signify and that's general mac and urney or whatever seeing guys
[1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:52.480]  got her laptop wouldn't you just dial in and grab the information digitally i'm i'm totally confused
[1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:59.120]  here you shouldn't be confused number one the people who went there and were at the capital the
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:06.000]  people i know went in peacefully those who were involved in taking something out a words i was
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:12.320]  told special forces this is not a particular general i do not know which generals are involved
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:18.400]  and the generals that i do know who involved do not want me to speak about it again what you are
[1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:26.160]  again alex let me explain it we mark the computers we mark the ballots we mark the everything that
[1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:33.920]  was done was a sting operation nothing is changed and what was done it was done by trump a businessman
[1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:40.880]  who understood the degree of corruption that existed among the democrats this isn't just
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:47.760]  something about the world control of america this was the concept of a fascist state coming in
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:54.720]  with the notion of a corona virus which was not lethal using Fauci another catholic who was trained

[1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:27.120]  arm of the deep state i guess if biden gets in in seven days are you saying trump's gonna get in
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:31.440]  there's about to be mass arrest we don't have a lot of time here like 150 hours what are you
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:37.280]  saying it's about to happen i'm about to say that biden is not going to be the president of the
[1:41:37.280 --> 1:41:43.600]  united states what i'm going to be saying is that there have been massive arrests and what i'm saying
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:51.520]  in effect is that we on marshal law and we have a military coup which simply means that there is
[1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:58.320]  going to be a large number of people who are going to be arrested detained and will be tried by
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:05.120]  military tribunal the reason it's militaries because we no longer trust our cia we no longer
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:10.800]  trust our politicians we do not trust our governors we do not trust the senior officials
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:17.440]  who are in congress or in the senate it's as simple as that i said it to you years ago i told you
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:24.400]  exactly who was going to leave they left i wrote the book 27 years ago about a military coup
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:31.520]  happening in an united states state of emergency it's as simple as that alex there is no globalism
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:37.680]  that's going to be involved we have shut down pakistan we have shut down part of england we
[1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:44.480]  have already the well there is talk about the pope stepping down hey well well let listen for a
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:50.800]  minute the pope was arrested well over a year ago and the reason why he was arrested alex
[1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:57.040]  because on your show i said this pope was corrupt and had been involved with terrorist
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:03.920]  organizations 20 to 30 years ago i was forbidden to take him out under syris fans wait a minute
[1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:08.160]  you're saying the pope well who's the guy we've seen traveling around the world in last year i
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:13.840]  don't see anybody traveling around the world right now you don't see anybody alex get some of your
[1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:19.520]  new trust nutraceuticals and understand that it's now we're not talking about past years we're not
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:25.360]  talking about past weeks we're talking about the next few days and where we are right now now i know
[1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:30.480]  you were not informed and i'm telling you this either one of us is wrong but i'm not wrong well
[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:34.400]  let me say i mean you can certainly get people thinking they're upside down and they're standing
[1:43:34.400 --> 1:43:37.760]  straight i mean you are the only guy that got the camp david accord through that nobody thought
[1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:41.520]  could happen i mean you've definitely done some psychological operations but i'm just telling you
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:46.000]  in seven days pacenic tell us what's gonna who's gonna be the president what's about to happen
[1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:54.000]  seven days let me repeat it again jones it's going to be trump it will not be biden biden's
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:01.040]  people will be arrested there will be people who will be arrested Pelosi biden tumor that's what's
[1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:07.440]  going to happen and if i'm wrong fine don't put me on your show if i'm right what else are you
[1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:13.200]  going to do the mat the point of fact is either you want to believe me or not i don't particularly
[1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:18.560]  care what most people say or don't say my job you've been on the show giving us a lot of good info
[1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:22.080]  over the years you said that the east coast and west coast collapsed and everything would move to
[1:44:22.080 --> 1:44:27.520]  south you said a lot of things are true i'm just sitting here watching this fiasco and i see the
[1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:32.400]  left provocaturing right wing groups for a bunch of craziness this weekend and it doesn't look good
[1:44:32.400 --> 1:44:37.040]  to me so i don't want to encourage people like you saw the q guys going to the capital with zip
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:42.960]  ties they thought they were in a secret mission to arrest people alex quiet down a bit you've
[1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:48.880]  never been in a military coup you do not understand what that means you do not understand how quickly
[1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:54.320]  we work and how long we've been preparing for this when i told you months ago that we were
[1:44:54.320 --> 1:45:00.560]  involved in this and we were taking over all the elements of the political system because we could
[1:45:00.560 --> 1:45:06.880]  not trust the mitt romney's the governors the senators the judges you're talking about when i
[1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:13.760]  said to you years ago and you still don't remember john roberts the supreme court justice has been
[1:45:13.760 --> 1:45:21.200]  indicted he was corrupt at the time that he made the obama case into a tax he then went to malta
[1:45:21.200 --> 1:45:27.680]  he was paid off he will be arrested you're talking about obama's people where i said repeatedly he
[1:45:27.680 --> 1:45:34.160]  was a cia operative there was nothing about him that was real he was a homosexual who had been on
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:38.880]  drugs and everything there's a lot of crazy stuff you say be quiet but i gotta ask the questions here
[1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:43.600]  let's let's look at this the joint chiefs of staff without a letter saying biden will be president
[1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:50.000]  is that who is that from what what is that i know who the joint chiefs that's not relevant to us
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:55.520]  because the real operational is not the joint chiefs of staff it's the military individuals
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:46:01.120]  who are involved it's the cia it's other people i'm not lending credence to what you're saying but
[1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:06.160]  but having the joint chiefs go it will be biden and the military must follow our orders makes
[1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:10.800]  them sound weak why would i need to say that if there wasn't some internal battle going on
[1:46:12.240 --> 1:46:17.680]  do you remember when i said to you general madis will be will be thrown out you remember that yes i
[1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:26.240]  do was he thrown out there he was okay so what i'm getting at is there are different types of
[1:46:26.240 --> 1:46:32.240]  generals there are those who are secretary of state like cheney who said this is treason
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:39.280]  then you got list cheney this incompetent fool from wyoming who said this is treason who is the
[1:46:39.280 --> 1:46:45.600]  biggest benedict arnold in the history of the 20th century that i've said to you for 19 years
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:51.520]  the cheney family is the equivalent of benedict arnold he should have been arrested he should
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:58.960]  have been executed for what he did all over the world he sent our boys into war to iraq and afghanistan
[1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:06.640]  i'd had generals who incompetent esper was he did i tell you he would leave he'd left right did i
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:12.880]  tell you madis would leave he left because he lied about what he did and who he was so i think
[1:47:12.880 --> 1:47:17.680]  the one that they use us to get her laptop or whatever according to you now you did say something
[1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:21.920]  about italy last time you were on the laws of going on with that what do you make of the supreme
[1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:26.960]  court hearing testimony that the italian military was used with the german military where they were
[1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:32.320]  counting the votes of the digital system to go in and manipulate the servers to flip votes from
[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:37.840]  trump to biden what do you make of that what do i make of this just what i told you we went
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:43.840]  after the leonardo system which came out in the italian there was a foreign service officer was
[1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:49.680]  italian catholic and involved with the italian catholic church the pope was involved he was
[1:47:49.680 --> 1:47:55.840]  neutralized it was sent up to leonardo which is the satellites we picked it off of leonardo
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:48:02.160]  and basically downloaded all of the information that was compromised and the basically proving
[1:48:02.160 --> 1:48:08.480]  that biden was never elected legally biden will not be in the presidency camilla harris will not
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:15.440]  be in the vice presidency all of the appointments including this new secretary of defense who they
[1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:20.880]  think is wonderful but i happen to know about him what about the new so-called ci direct well i
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:25.120]  mean let me say this the one thing i know is true the one thing you say is true is we are under
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:31.440]  marshal law right now it's not just in dc that's correct i've said it repeatedly you're under
[1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:37.360]  marshal law everywhere the state of california black-clock helicopters hovering over downtown
[1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:43.280]  austin this morning because you're you're you're sitting down in austin you're working very hard
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:49.520]  in your studio and you're trying to sell vitamins we don't send black-clock helicopters everywhere
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:55.680]  this is not just special courses these are units from all over the country the reason why you don't
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:03.360]  see trump you kept on asking me why is he absent and i kept saying to you this is sunzoo trump was
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:09.360]  brilliant what he did was to allow all the democrats and republicans to reveal their
[1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:17.280]  underlying miscreant behavior and then he was sent to command and control centers in abalone
[1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:25.040]  command and control centers in norad there's no reason for him to come out he wanted to do exactly
[1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:32.720]  what a brilliant strategist does wishes to allow everybody to reveal their pathological intention
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:39.600]  i kept saying to you months ago this is a fascist system coming from the left from obama from
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:47.120]  brendan when does it direct to the cia who's a catholic moron from fordham screwed up insordia
[1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:54.560]  arabia becomes the deputy director of the cia was an analyst and then brings forth another cia
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:50:01.040]  operative obama that's when i got my subpoena 10 years ago and i had to go to court to explain
[1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:07.840]  how what an idiot this man was and how the attorney general of miami was an idiot in other words my
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:14.320]  tolerance for ignorance and stupidity is not great i'm not saying that about you but i'm saying very
[1:50:14.320 --> 1:50:22.560]  simply if i'm wrong so be it but if i'm right you're gonna have to understand something about our
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:29.040]  country and that you don't fully understand what it really is about it's really about where you see
[1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:32.400]  and here's the deal that's a nice back end of deal i am an idiot at many levels you know that's
[1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:37.440]  what socrates said is i know that i know nothing uh we're gonna gonna break in two minutes we're
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:41.200]  we're gonna come back and let you finish up here but all i know is this this country's in crisis we
[1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:44.560]  should be praying we should all be politically involved we should be pointing out this election's
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:50.320]  a fraud uh and we should be exposing joe biden as a communist chinese agent steve chenic.com
[1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:56.560]  he's our guest and uh boy this is a very exciting time to be alive we'll uh see what comes out of
[1:50:56.560 --> 1:51:01.440]  all of this but obviously i'm gonna ask the tough questions here uh a 19 year history with this
[1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:07.600]  guy on air he's giving us 99 good stuff uh but i mean gosh i hope he's right uh now some say don't
[1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:12.000]  have him on now you can burn in hell too you know this idea that i'm just supposed to have one view
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:16.720]  on here one idea this is all in flux we are under martial law i was driving in this morning
[1:51:17.920 --> 1:51:22.320]  and i could i was up on the top of the mix master and i could see downtown and i could see military
[1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:27.520]  bases with with black hawks four of them just sitting by the time we got the office they took off
[1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:32.240]  but whatever they were doing was like scanning for weapons or something probably radioactive devices
[1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:39.040]  seeing a lot of bizarre behavior going on folks we're right back hey alex how you doing man

[1:53:15.680 --> 1:53:19.680]  speaking out against it that he has a right to do it you might want to find who he works for
[1:53:19.680 --> 1:53:25.680]  yours directly for prince charles he developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability
[1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:31.520]  that means worldwide neo feudalism in his own works so you might want to find out how he talks

[1:53:56.800 --> 1:54:03.600]  well you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes
[1:54:03.600 --> 1:54:17.280]  and the chauffeur drives your car you let everybody know but don't play with me because you're playing
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:25.760]  with fire well you know i hope dr steve's is right and we have a military coup but that the
[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:30.720]  chai kong agent joe biden gets exposed but i thought you know let's get him on now seven
[1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:35.920]  days until whatever's going to happen the country is under martial law total insanity is unfolding
[1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:40.640]  so not finishing up other points you'd like to make a relay that the viewers and listeners out there
[1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:49.040]  here's a very simple point i'm going to make here's the bet we're going to have alex once and for all
[1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:56.160]  if i'm wrong i will never appear on your show again but if i'm right i become one of your
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:02.560]  official bait commentator you want that they're right i'll hurry and pay you can be on the show
[1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:10.240]  over there that's correct all right so we have that bet right yes okay now i'm going to talk to
[1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:17.360]  you about the positive aspects of what's going on it's called the black robe regiment and those
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:25.120]  are the american christians who have understood that by praying with jesus we can in effect implement
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:33.920]  the necessary uh constitutional rights that we had now why do i say that number one the black robe
[1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:41.040]  regiment was really founded in the revolutionary war and i have to remind you in america that we
[1:55:41.040 --> 1:55:48.240]  did not come out of peace it was called a revolution that means initially we were terrorists against
[1:55:48.240 --> 1:55:55.840]  the british in that process the black regiment black robe regiment were incredible christian
[1:55:55.840 --> 1:56:05.040]  pastors who supported their uh churches with the notion that you had to fight for liberty justice
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:12.720]  and jesus that's exactly what's happening now and there are those loyal american christians who
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:19.280]  belong to this black robe regiment and i i appreciate what they do i appreciate what you
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:25.280]  did alex but for the first time you're beginning to understand you were the vehicle through which
[1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:32.000]  i could implement or the system could implement what they needed to do it was not through youtube it
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:40.080]  was not through email you were being used for 20 years as the major way of communicating to the
[1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:46.720]  military and the intelligence what you forgot alex was the first time i ever came on you said
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:53.360]  there were thousands and thousands of operatives listening to us on 9 11 and when we came on on
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:59.360]  9 11 less than two people in this whole world believed that this was not i was correct about
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:06.400]  9 11 five years later thanks to your show and our ability to discuss and have our differences
[1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:16.960]  it's 70 percent of america understood that bush jr cheney kandalees arrives colon pal all cowards
[1:57:16.960 --> 1:57:22.080]  all corrupt well that's why you had the courage to expose 9 11 inside job and give out key intel
[1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:26.720]  and and leave the council on farm relations so i know that was a bold thing you did yeah but
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:32.240]  that's not about me it was i'm talking about you alex you were the vehicle that was initially
[1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:38.640]  anointed say by me all right but if you are anointed because i took that risk to say this
[1:57:38.640 --> 1:57:47.360]  is going to be the major vehicle for where we're going to go in the next 20 or 30 years so in this
[1:57:47.360 --> 1:57:53.440]  process you have to remember what is this coup about this is a coup to pay back the chainies
[1:57:53.440 --> 1:57:59.600]  for the corruption and cowardness for the wars that they sent us in iraq and afghanistan to obama
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:07.360]  who sent up the war including biden who specifically sent soldiers there and we lost 5 000 people then
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:15.680]  to obama again who sent us into war into afghanistan to bush senior to colon pal who lied continuously
[1:58:15.680 --> 1:58:22.240]  pathological liar who was a coward in vietnam and said we didn't have any lie any lie when
[1:58:22.240 --> 1:58:26.560]  he said we had anthra no i understand how he's posing their backgrounds we have kim paxton

[2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:06.640]  biden so i guess biden wanted the pleasure of getting rid of him but dr steve machinic
[2:00:06.640 --> 2:00:14.160]  has been more accurate than he's been wrong i mean i'd give him 95 accuracy rate and he's
[2:00:14.160 --> 2:00:19.040]  doubling down i'll give it to him some of this sounds cue-ish to me but he's a real guy he's
[2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:22.880]  the best selling author he's a psychiatrist he did the camp david accords he's been around
[2:00:22.880 --> 2:00:29.440]  forever he he he did write tom clancy's books he did make these big films he did overthrow
[2:00:29.440 --> 2:00:33.440]  governments i mean he's been on the show before and there's like federal investigations over
[2:00:33.440 --> 2:00:37.520]  in articles the one in guarding and yeah he's the one that picked the communist to kill the
[2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:41.920]  italian prime minister and i mean he's definitely done the stuff okay it's not a bunch of talk
[2:00:43.440 --> 2:00:48.240]  and so he's sitting here saying all of this and then i see the weird martial law and and all
[2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:52.240]  this stuff i don't i don't know what's going on behind the scenes i'm just a guy that research
[2:00:52.240 --> 2:00:59.040]  his politics here in texas and loves freedom but i know this i don't see how the power structure
[2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:08.480]  puts a joe biden in control i i mean the guy can hardly talk the guys a chinese agent totally
[2:01:08.480 --> 2:01:13.600]  penetrated on record underground on investigation for it and i just i just don't see where this
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:19.280]  goes and kamala harris and all of this so are you saying this is some larger giant dialectic
[2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:23.920]  and tell me how does it unfold the next seven days that suddenly they're all arrested and then
[2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:29.040]  what happens with trump i mean what the hell according to what you're saying humor me what's
[2:01:29.040 --> 2:01:37.760]  going to happen next alex i don't need to humor you basically what i said i you are funny in many
[2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:45.200]  cases uh what is going to happen is biden will be arrested polosi was going to be arrested remember
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:52.240]  what i said about polosi her family was alex andrew out of boltamore maryland they were corrupt
[2:01:52.240 --> 2:01:58.800]  she is corrupt there's nothing here that's new in other words let's get to very simple psychology
[2:01:59.360 --> 2:02:05.120]  this is repetition compulsion in other words if you're a crook and a coward this will continue
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:11.600]  your whole life that's cheney that's polosi that's biden there's nothing new about biden we didn't
[2:02:11.600 --> 2:02:18.240]  know in effect i think biden understood his days were limited he will be picked up his son will
[2:02:18.240 --> 2:02:24.560]  be picked up the man who will be the next president of the united states i said it to you months ago
[2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:30.560]  will be trump so is that why biden says things like i'll feign an illness and go away he doesn't
[2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:36.880]  feign anything he's too stupid to feign anything he's not relevant the point of biden is that they
[2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:44.960]  picked some individual who was mentally impaired made went through a kabuki of nonsense and what
[2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:53.280]  you have is a dialectic of stupidity and competency agle would have said you know what the competency
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:03:00.880]  wins over stupidity agle would have said oh i'm going to appoint a man named who's a businessman
[2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:08.880]  who basically effectively took down 42nd street in new york built hotels all over the country
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:17.200]  in the world never asked one for one penny in this uh interaction and the man i said to you
[2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:25.680]  for 30 years do not listen to what he says watch what he does he's brilliant he came out of a
[2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:32.320]  past where his mother was from scotland what he refuses to talk about and i repeated it numerous
[2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:43.120]  times on this show his uncle trump was a major major professor at mit in electronics and radar
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:50.240]  he doesn't say a word but i will tell you i know trump's super high q family but but let's expand
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:55.840]  on that let's expand on that let's expand on that this is not about you we're going to talk about
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:04:04.160]  the president of mit he's going to resign because he's compromised the president of harvard compromised
[2:04:04.160 --> 2:04:11.360]  the president of cornell compromised you're talking about people who had brought in chinese
[2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:16.720]  operatives why did i not say this was a war against china because the chinese had been
[2:04:16.720 --> 2:04:23.760]  infiltrating us the 35 years mike flin said it very correctly to you and i've said it repeatedly
[2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:32.320]  it we have all of the companies that are under chinese control tesla we have the
[2:04:32.320 --> 2:04:39.760]  woldorf hill a hotel a story a hotel the hilton chain the renaissance chain i can go on and on
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:46.080]  for 30 companies that have been under chinese control because we have to see where eric swallows
[2:04:46.080 --> 2:04:50.640]  well is going to be the house manager for the impeachment the chinese agent on record here
[2:04:50.640 --> 2:04:56.640]  it is right here overhead shot please i mean look at this an admitted compromised sex op
[2:04:56.640 --> 2:05:02.480]  will it ccp agent who oversaw the operations against our president and now he's going to
[2:05:02.480 --> 2:05:08.400]  oversee so that chinese agent will oversee the uh impeachment of a president that's illegal
[2:05:09.680 --> 2:05:18.080]  no it's not illegal what it is is the farce alex you understand how absurd this has become but the
[2:05:18.080 --> 2:05:25.280]  reality the reality is under the absurdity the liberal the left couldn't tolerate any more
[2:05:27.920 --> 2:05:34.640]  forces against them which basically said you're wrong you're ignorant you're stupid i have a case
[2:05:34.640 --> 2:05:40.400]  i'll give you an example just recently state of emergency was picked up by one of the major
[2:05:40.400 --> 2:05:47.680]  presidents of cw network and that person whom i've known for years in hollywood said i want to help
[2:05:47.680 --> 2:05:54.240]  you out what happened when he found out i was involved in a coup he was disgusted what happened
[2:05:54.240 --> 2:06:01.600]  to all of hollywood among american jews they're incompetent they're ignorant what they basically
[2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:08.480]  feel and i've said it repeatedly to you the american jewish intellectual is pathetic they
[2:06:08.480 --> 2:06:14.160]  have no idea of american history they think that abraham lincoln is the greatest president when in
[2:06:14.160 --> 2:06:20.080]  fact he's he's the disaster they don't know the history of world war two and the holocaust they
[2:06:20.080 --> 2:06:27.120]  make up all kinds of nonsense where we have museums of the holocaust when in fact we had 146
[2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:33.840]  jews and hitland's army two of the field marshals were jews do you think any american knows this
[2:06:33.840 --> 2:06:39.680]  no no no the professor jewish professor of written books proving that there was a jewish ruling class
[2:06:39.680 --> 2:06:44.160]  kind of like saucerberg cohen today in the adl that fed on jews and sold them out for hitler
[2:06:44.160 --> 2:06:48.480]  which i know you lost some of your family so it was a real holocaust but it was jews with hitler
[2:06:48.480 --> 2:06:52.720]  robbing the jews and that's why they loved or soros because he was a young man part of the
[2:06:52.720 --> 2:06:59.360]  jewish robbery of the jewish you got it now so what did i say it's identification with the
[2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:06.320]  aggression with the aggressor and repetition compulsion soros worked with the nazi survived
[2:07:06.320 --> 2:07:13.520]  soros works for himself and others to overthrow a government soros is pathetic he made his
[2:07:13.520 --> 2:07:20.240]  billions on nothing more than a guess on the euro and the pound i've known him i've met him
[2:07:20.240 --> 2:07:27.680]  he's a pathetic individual who got the power and the cia helped him what was the element that i
[2:07:27.680 --> 2:07:36.720]  went after here it was the cia why did i ask gene hasfield to be taken out john brennan clapper
[2:07:36.720 --> 2:07:41.920]  all of these are in a look at how the adl gives awards to sword snager whose dab was in the ss
[2:07:41.920 --> 2:07:47.200]  sword snager said he loves hitler so they give him a jewish award it's all a sick joke and it
[2:07:47.200 --> 2:07:50.800]  really is the big secret of world war two it's in the real histories it's not even in mainline
[2:07:50.800 --> 2:07:57.200]  history books it's just buried that rich rich jews worked with hitler to target jews and rob them
[2:07:57.200 --> 2:08:04.240]  it's it's so evil well it's not only that it's short snager here's an example of a self-righteous
[2:08:04.240 --> 2:08:11.440]  lying individual never served our country his visa by the way he's not here legally he had a lot of
[2:08:11.440 --> 2:08:19.280]  problems with his visa he took all kinds of drugs to pump up his body he's a liar because his father
[2:08:19.280 --> 2:08:28.160]  wasn't in the ss it was a worse unit s a that was the unit that hitler killed overnight because they
[2:08:28.160 --> 2:08:34.560]  were more ruthless than the ss he then hires the simon leeson false standard to see if his
[2:08:34.560 --> 2:08:42.160]  father's cleared his father was nothing more than an operatic in the nazi party not in the thema
[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:49.360]  in the s a and he didn't even war he just rounded people up he went to know his father went to war
[2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:55.200]  he was wounded on the stalingrad he was wounded in russia thank god but most of it i thought most
[2:08:55.200 --> 2:09:00.880]  of it he was rounding people up my point it's not relevant what's relevant is schwarz nigger
[2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:05.440]  himself is a phony again let's do one more because i watched that video of him calling
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:11.360]  trump weak and trump a fascist and here is this guy that looted california here is this guy that

[2:09:37.040 --> 2:09:41.680]  sirs i watched that video him yesterday almost threw up five times that is a sack of fake garbage
[2:09:44.240 --> 2:09:50.320]  cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with

[2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:25.040]  network okay so i took dr steve pacinic's bet that if trump is president on january 21st 2021
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:29.120]  that we're gonna hire pacinic for the daily show if he wants it i'll pay him 200 000 a year
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:36.080]  he's got that bet but he's not allowed if he loses the bet to just go away he has to come back on
[2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:42.560]  the show not to humiliate him i'm wrong about stuff i felt like i was set up no one would pay for the
[2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:48.960]  events on the fifth to six i got the money together then luckily a donor came in and paid for like
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:54.880]  80 percent of it it's like 500 000 that ended up the donor it like 400 000 like 100 something
[2:12:55.680 --> 2:12:59.040]  and then we're like okay i'm supposed to lead this march of hundreds of thousands of people
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:02.880]  that couldn't even hear me on a bullhorn i get there some idiots provocateur they break in and
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:08.560]  all the stupidness and then you've got all these virtue signalers out there attacking the president
[2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:14.480]  he didn't want violence i didn't want violence so i don't see how that was a success when i get
[2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:18.640]  played into people's hands i will admit it and anti was the anti-foot was there in their black
[2:13:18.640 --> 2:13:24.560]  outfits they helped break in known anti-foot by name was there they helped trick the cops to attack
[2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:29.360]  the crowd they got some of the crowd to go in dr pacinic you're a nice guy and a smart guy but i
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:34.400]  just i don't think you mean bad i just think you're being overly optimistic here so we're

[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:49.440]  remember one thing about me how is a very nice guy able to take out the canary without any weapons
[2:13:49.440 --> 2:13:56.800]  able to take out the soviet union without any weapons able to take out noriega without any
[2:13:56.800 --> 2:14:04.400]  weapons what do you understand what this nice guy does do you understand that this nice guy so
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:11.520]  tell us give us your view no i just said it to you i i'm a very nice guy but again understand
[2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:17.280]  what i'm really about when i said to you the state of emergency was written 27 years ago
[2:14:17.280 --> 2:14:24.800]  about a military coup in the united states it pinpointed mit romney as one of the villains
[2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:34.080]  it pinpointed the irish catholics the brennans the poloses the fouches the comos all of that now
[2:14:34.080 --> 2:14:40.560]  how is it that i knew that the question at hand here is you haven't been played at all alex the
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:45.520]  reason i enjoy you is first of all you have an incredible mind and you have an incredible
[2:14:45.520 --> 2:14:52.240]  wit but both of us are very strong willed you have never been played and the reason you were
[2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:58.160]  chosen was the fact that i really enjoyed being on your show i've been asked to be on a lot of
[2:14:58.160 --> 2:15:04.000]  shows and i said no i'm not interested but if you go on very glad to be chosen and you're
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:07.760]  you're a good guess about a lot of good commentary but seriously we built a big audience of great
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:12.160]  people i'm trying to figure out so you can't tell us how this magic's gonna happen and joe
[2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:17.280]  biden's gonna step down in seven days i mean explain to me the details i just said it to you

[2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:47.520]  a very simple issue here you have a wonderful person named daria i won't say anything more
[2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:55.360]  ask her what it was like under the soviet union to live under repression and how is it that the
[2:15:55.360 --> 2:16:02.640]  following could occur in every fashion system first you create fear we did that coronavirus
[2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:08.800]  you're gonna die not only you're gonna die we got an extra coronavirus which means that you have to
[2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:15.680]  wear a mask just like the jews did in hitlet time when they wore the yellow star so every idiot who's
[2:16:15.680 --> 2:16:22.320]  wearing a mask is already getting into trouble but we did it everybody's walking around then
[2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:29.040]  on top of that we have a president or potential president who's even more of a moron says you
[2:16:29.040 --> 2:16:36.240]  know what we're going to keep those masks on for the next 100 days and guess what i have some vaccines
[2:16:36.240 --> 2:16:42.240]  but i can't give it to you and those vaccines will make you better in truth the vaccines are
[2:16:42.240 --> 2:16:51.600]  worthless mrna is a very fast uh uh epitope which degrades quickly there isn't one person
[2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:59.360]  advisor astrazeneca or maderna who understands that this was an effective vaccine the cdc was
[2:16:59.360 --> 2:17:06.560]  worthless hhs was worthless and what happened the people i told you who were the heads of hhs and
[2:17:06.560 --> 2:17:15.120]  cdc left isn't that amazing either i'm a genius or i just see ordinary problems and say you know what
[2:17:15.120 --> 2:17:22.480]  you're wrong that's what allowed me to be a doctor and what does a doctor really do he saves lives
[2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:30.560]  any of any can kill lives you better think very carefully that this nice guy is what he may or

[2:18:17.680 --> 2:18:26.000]  saying of course he is he's the genius who put it together this is a man who built out of nothing
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:31.440]  i mean you people don't understand trump they listen to him but they don't understand how
[2:18:31.440 --> 2:18:39.040]  brilliant he is to build and take down i mean this is a man who built an ice skating rink in
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:46.720]  five weeks when coch for 10 years couldn't do it and not only that he allowed every kid in new york
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:50.800]  city i know you love that that's like your santa claus story well if he can build an ice skating

[2:23:45.760 --> 2:23:48.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:48.400 --> 2:24:06.720]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:11.920]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:16.640]  There'll be a golden letter reaching down
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:21.760]  when the man comes around.
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:30.480]  The hairs on your arm. All right, my friends. I'm Alex Jones, your host. That was a wild
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:34.960]  interview. I sure hope Dr. Pachennick's right. You know, mainstream media and the globalists
[2:24:34.960 --> 2:24:38.640]  want us to believe whatever they say. They tell so many big lies that it makes you
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:42.480]  get to the point where you don't even know what the truth is anymore. Is it wishful thinking?
[2:24:42.480 --> 2:24:47.440]  Is it hoping? That guy's been involved in overthrow governments, a lot of the big stuff.
[2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:52.160]  I mean, I don't want a military coup. We're already under a Chinese globalist coup,
[2:24:52.160 --> 2:24:57.200]  so I just don't know what to say about any of it. I'm just here covering it with folks that want us to
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:05.120]  not question and want to silence the American people. Big tech can burn in hell. That's a term
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:09.360]  I just never even really thought about using. It just pops to mind. I'm just saying get out
[2:25:09.360 --> 2:25:14.800]  of my life is what I'm saying. And at the same time, a lot of what Pachennick was talking about
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:19.680]  sounded Q-ish. I'm not against people that got into Q or a lot of the info that Q talks about
[2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:22.800]  or people talk about that are in Q is it's real. It's a new old order. It's what we cover.
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:29.680]  It's just that when it's esoteric and it's secretive and people hit their part of secret
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:35.520]  arrests and overthrow the government, all this sounds really dangerous. And I meant to get to
[2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:40.480]  that with Pachennick, but I was good out here now. He says there's about to be arrested stuff
[2:25:40.480 --> 2:25:49.840]  of the Democrats. Well, the Q system is online telling people the arrest began this weekend
[2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:53.440]  and all this. And there are people with zip ties and all the rest of it that actually went
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:26:01.280]  into the Capitol and played into the system. So there's a lot of stuff going on here. And what
[2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:06.960]  I know is this in America, it's good to question all of it. But violence is not the answer at this
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:12.000]  juncture. It certainly is the answer at random state capitals and random governor's mansions
[2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:17.280]  as a lot of these right wing control groups are out there pushing. And the classic thing
[2:26:17.280 --> 2:26:22.160]  with feds leading militias is he's against the militia. He doesn't want to blow up a police
[2:26:22.160 --> 2:26:27.040]  station. No, I'm for the constitutional militia for the Second Amendment. Doesn't mean you shoot
[2:26:27.040 --> 2:26:30.640]  your kids. Doesn't mean you rob the liquor store because you have a Second Amendment.
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:37.440]  That's not the Second Amendment. So violence helps the globalist. It hurts us for the American
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:41.760]  people who are on our side. We don't want violence. That's all I've been saying. Now,
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:47.840]  let's move on. This is a global corporate rollout. You know, the libertarians have good
[2:26:47.840 --> 2:26:55.200]  ideas on paper. But the problem is big corporations have become government. It's like Twitter and
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:27:00.000]  others saying, oh, Uganda's blocked social media during the election. That's election meddling.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:07.200]  Oh, but when you only block conservatives or nationalists, that's okay. And so under the
[2:27:07.200 --> 2:27:13.200]  global social credit score, individuals enforce it, corporations enforce it. So you saw the big
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:19.520]  airlines look at who flew to D.C. And if they came in wearing manga gear, they admitted, oh,
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:25.920]  the employees decided to flag everyone that had just flown in the day before the event and flew
[2:27:25.920 --> 2:27:31.840]  out the day after day after. And if they saw you wearing a red hat or a Trump gear, they would not
[2:27:31.840 --> 2:27:38.240]  let you get on your airplane as a punishment. They would illegally put you on their no-fly list
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:42.960]  that was meant for terrorists. And they bragged about it because Chuck E. Schumer called for it.
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:49.600]  General Schumer calls for it. And then people wearing manga gear are banned from getting on
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:55.680]  airplanes. That is fascism. And if you look at what Hitler did or what Mao did under communism,
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:59.760]  it's the same thing as authoritarianism. It was the grassroots of the Great Leap Forward,
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:05.840]  the Cultural Revolution that would enforce it. And so Black Lives Matter going to restaurants
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:11.920]  and breaking everything and screaming at people and attacking folks and anti-burning down buildings.
[2:28:11.920 --> 2:28:17.680]  This is all their army on the streets. Pelosi says that's good. But when Laura Loomer,
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:22.080]  who did a great job running for Congress and fighting back in censorship, ground zero for all
[2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:26.480]  this, when she flew back in out of Latin America yesterday, we have all the documents right here
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:32.800]  over at Shop Police, she was stopped by customs and searched and made to wait hours and they
[2:28:32.800 --> 2:28:37.280]  admitted to her at the end, well, we see on Wikipedia you're political. Like, what do you do
[2:28:37.280 --> 2:28:41.760]  for a living? Well, I'm a journalist. Really, your Wikipedia says all this about, is that true?
[2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:46.480]  And so in America, you have the merger of state and corporations. That is fascism.
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:51.280]  And that's the global communist social credits court. You know, the Chinese call themselves
[2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:54.640]  communists. Communism doesn't even work. It's not a doable system. They're really fascists.
[2:28:55.360 --> 2:28:59.360]  And that's the model of the world. And so what does Congress do? Well, they accept it all the
[2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:03.920]  censorship. They accept it all the tyranny. So now the Democrats have both branches of the House
[2:29:03.920 --> 2:29:09.120]  and Senate. They have the executive that's called the Trafecta. And they basically have a Supreme
[2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:14.000]  Court. It's a globalist as well. And so now they're saying, oh, we're going to expel members of
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:19.280]  Congress. We're going to take their bank accounts, not just the president. So everybody overuses
[2:29:19.280 --> 2:29:23.360]  Hitler, how he first went after groups that took away their banking and their businesses that put
[2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:29.440]  up in ghettos, then shipped them away to be worked to death in slave camps. If you were lucky with
[2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:35.200]  the slave camp, others just got killed. This is happening. This isn't over the horizon. It's not
[2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:40.880]  down the street. It's not the front door. It's on top of us, kicking our ass, bashing our brains out.
[2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:44.400]  So we'll show you right here. We got the name of the officers and all of it.
[2:29:45.200 --> 2:29:48.960]  Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border. She's thrown all over the world.
[2:29:48.960 --> 2:29:53.920]  They never had this happen. Pulled out because she's on the list. This happened to me under
[2:29:53.920 --> 2:29:59.760]  Obama and Bush and the Clintons. And they said, oh, it's your political views. They even told her
[2:29:59.760 --> 2:30:04.640]  they're so comfortable. She was in another country when this happened at the Capitol.
[2:30:04.640 --> 2:30:09.920]  But because she's a nationalist, because she's pro America, because she's pro free speech,
[2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:14.640]  they've gone through everywhere and now run people through an algorithm. They told her
[2:30:14.640 --> 2:30:20.800]  of a database that some bean counter puts you in a computer like Brazil, not the country,
[2:30:20.800 --> 2:30:26.480]  the movie Terry Gilliam, where a bug falls out of the typewriter, instead of tittle,
[2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:32.320]  it's bittle. So bittle gets picked up and tortured to death because of the algorithm that gets you
[2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:37.360]  to sign over your responsibility of machine and Bloomberg's technology. So joining us to
[2:30:37.360 --> 2:30:42.800]  break this down this segment for a couple more is Laura Loomer. Laura, tell folks what happened.
[2:30:42.800 --> 2:30:48.800]  This is huge. Well, thanks so much for having me on, Alex. Yeah, look, this is everything that
[2:30:48.800 --> 2:30:54.800]  we warned people would happen and more conservatives are now being targeted. And as you showed those
[2:30:54.800 --> 2:31:01.440]  videos on the previous segments of people getting detained and put on no fly lists and having
[2:31:01.440 --> 2:31:06.800]  flights grounded simply because they're Trump supporters. Now, Department of Homeland Security
[2:31:06.800 --> 2:31:11.520]  and our federal law enforcement agencies are being weaponized against conservatives who travel.
[2:31:11.520 --> 2:31:18.320]  I was out of the country for a couple of weeks and I just returned. I was in El Salvador.
[2:31:19.040 --> 2:31:27.440]  I was not even in the country at the time of the rally in D.C. on January 6. But when I came back
[2:31:27.440 --> 2:31:34.240]  to America the other day, you know, as soon as I got off the plane in Miami, I noticed that the,
[2:31:35.200 --> 2:31:41.040]  you know, DHS officers there were looking at me. And then when I went through passport control
[2:31:41.040 --> 2:31:46.080]  instead of just asking me the standard questions and having me go through to baggage claim,
[2:31:46.080 --> 2:31:51.920]  the officer stood up and then he walked me over to a separate area that other people
[2:31:51.920 --> 2:31:56.720]  were not in after they went through passport control. And then they had me go down a separate
[2:31:56.720 --> 2:32:02.160]  corridor. And then when I reached baggage claim, they made me go down a separate area in front
[2:32:02.160 --> 2:32:06.560]  of a guard and then they said come with us. And while everybody else on my flight, which was a
[2:32:06.560 --> 2:32:11.360]  direct flight, was able to go get their bags after arriving from El Salvador, I was told I was not
[2:32:11.360 --> 2:32:16.640]  allowed to get my luggage. And so every single person was able to get their suitcase. And then
[2:32:16.640 --> 2:32:22.960]  I had to stay in an area separate from the carousel, locked off by a DHS officer on one side
[2:32:22.960 --> 2:32:28.960]  and another on the other and glass windows. And I was sitting there for like an hour. They wouldn't
[2:32:28.960 --> 2:32:34.960]  tell me why I couldn't get my bags. And then they wouldn't even let me grab my suitcase after it came
[2:32:34.960 --> 2:32:39.920]  out on the carousel, which was 100 feet away from me. They made another DHS officer grab my
[2:32:39.920 --> 2:32:46.240]  suitcases for me. And then they said, follow us. And then they took me to another area. And mind
[2:32:46.240 --> 2:32:50.560]  you, once you get your bags, you're able to just leave the airport. So they wouldn't let me leave.
[2:32:50.560 --> 2:32:56.080]  They made me go talk to two DHS officers who opened up all my suitcases and then they proceeded to
[2:32:56.640 --> 2:33:01.120]  unpack it. They were going through every item, even my underwear. They literally unzipped my
[2:33:01.120 --> 2:33:06.160]  garment bag and we're pulling out my underwear and bras and going through everything. And then
[2:33:06.160 --> 2:33:11.360]  the guy looked at me and goes, Oh, what do you do for a living? And I said, I'm a journalist.
[2:33:11.360 --> 2:33:16.240]  And then he goes, Oh, I'm looking at your Wikipedia page is what they say about you. True.
[2:33:17.200 --> 2:33:22.160]  And mind you, my Wikipedia page is just a classic case example of defamation because
[2:33:22.160 --> 2:33:26.800]  the radical left, as you know, and the founder of Wikipedia, H Trump, H Trump supporters, and they
[2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:31.200]  basically, because of what Wikipedia said, you're earning a database. He tells you it's an algorithm.
[2:33:31.200 --> 2:33:34.720]  We're going to come back and talk about this. This is the next level of the fascism, the next
[2:33:34.720 --> 2:33:41.680]  level of the oppression is now the global social credits or support America. You cannot fly the
[2:33:41.680 --> 2:33:44.800]  best product. I'm not supposed to be biased. But I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't
[2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:50.400]  tried turbo force, you need to try it. I've tried turbo force with everything. Sometimes, you know,
[2:33:50.400 --> 2:33:54.640]  I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week. I don't remember
[2:33:54.640 --> 2:33:58.800]  sleeping. But as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite. And all the infowars products
[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:03.360]  are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:09.680]  people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person
[2:34:09.680 --> 2:34:13.760]  over there a better life. I'm going to wake up today. You know, I'm going to spend my entire day
[2:34:13.760 --> 2:34:17.040]  trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he
[2:34:17.040 --> 2:34:20.880]  gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[2:34:20.880 --> 2:34:24.480]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:28.080]  your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was
[2:34:28.080 --> 2:34:31.760]  me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take
[2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:34.800]  control of my health. And that's why you need to go to infowars.com, take control of your health
[2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:38.560]  right now and support the resistance. Don't buy into the group. Think don't drink the Kool-Aid,
[2:34:38.560 --> 2:34:43.760]  drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid is bad and the turbo force is good. We are witnessing a perfect
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:48.640]  dichotomy of psychological warfare. The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists,
[2:34:48.640 --> 2:34:52.160]  big tech and big farmer are all pushing the covers, the most deadly thing in history,
[2:34:52.160 --> 2:34:57.840]  even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold. But if you are deficient, then you can
[2:34:57.840 --> 2:35:02.560]  actually die from it. That's why I see somebody dying inside the nursing homes. Meanwhile, all
[2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:07.840]  these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said
[2:35:07.840 --> 2:35:12.800]  that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically bioweapons that are super
[2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:17.520]  deadly. And now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically when they take it,
[2:35:17.520 --> 2:35:21.120]  just like newborn babies, they give vaccines. They have to resuscitate them all the time,
[2:35:21.120 --> 2:35:24.880]  or a lot of times they just let them die. And that's on the record. It does that.
[2:35:24.880 --> 2:35:28.960]  Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you,
[2:35:28.960 --> 2:35:32.480]  save and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory. And then all the fine
[2:35:32.480 --> 2:35:37.120]  princess can kill you absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't dangerous
[2:35:37.120 --> 2:35:40.800]  towards something that is incredibly dangerous, because the media says it's safe. They do it.
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:47.840]  Now is the time to get prepared. You got to pray to God and get your soul ready.
[2:35:47.840 --> 2:35:52.000]  You got to be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family. And you've also
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:56.080]  got to get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the system.
[2:35:56.640 --> 2:36:01.280]  That's why they want to bankrupt the economy. It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure
[2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:07.200]  of this nation, because they want all of us on our knees so they can dictate our surrender to them.
[2:36:07.200 --> 2:36:11.680]  Info Wars is a critical organization in the fight against the globalist. And
[2:36:11.680 --> 2:36:15.440]  if you gave us straight up donations, that would be great because our work is important.

[2:36:38.880 --> 2:36:45.520]  of these sales right now at infowarstore.com where you still can. The Post Industrial World. That's
[2:36:45.520 --> 2:36:53.680]  what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[2:36:54.560 --> 2:37:00.480]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post industrial world plow schwa with the Davis Group,
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:07.200]  Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the great reset is Agenda 2030.
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:11.760]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction
[2:37:12.480 --> 2:37:17.760]  of society as we know it. It is making the population more by design so we can be controlled
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:23.760]  with a medical technocracy over you and your family. They're destroying civilization,
[2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:31.360]  rebuild it in their dystopic image. We are fighting this at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:36.480]  We are fighting for a pro human future and we need you to get the facts to research and
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:42.080]  and share with others and join the fight. God bless you. Visit us, spread the word at infowars.com.
[2:38:06.720 --> 2:38:15.440]  This is a lot bigger than just President Trump. This is a lot bigger than Laura Loomer or Alex Jones.
[2:38:16.160 --> 2:38:22.160]  This is the entire corporate system working together in concert, racketeering, to take the
[2:38:22.160 --> 2:38:27.360]  bank accounts, to take the YouTube, to take the Twitter, to take 40, 50 other things away
[2:38:27.360 --> 2:38:34.240]  from the president as a collective punishment outside of law, outside of courts. And when
[2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:38.640]  you have corporations working with government to oppress people, it has a name. Fascism,
[2:38:38.640 --> 2:38:44.720]  authoritarianism is what's more associated with government corporations together with communism.
[2:38:44.720 --> 2:38:49.680]  It's total control of the state, but it's all the same, different window dressing, black helicopters,
[2:38:49.680 --> 2:38:57.040]  secret police, black uniforms, people disappearing. And so this is the world we're entering into.
[2:38:57.040 --> 2:39:03.280]  And then they said on the news, oh, Chuck E. Schumer said on Thursday morning, we ought to have
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:08.000]  no fly list for everyone that showed up at the Capitol. So imagine you go to a football game
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:12.560]  with 100,000 people. You go to this event with probably a million all over the city,
[2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:16.160]  600, 700,000 down at the Trump event. No one can hear him as they start going to the Capitol.
[2:39:16.960 --> 2:39:21.200]  Hundreds of thousands are there and 100 or so people attack police and break in.
[2:39:21.200 --> 2:39:25.920]  They get shot, they get killed. Most of them walked right down the, you know, the red carpet
[2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:32.480]  with the velvet ropes didn't even get outside the ropes. My God. I didn't know the Japanese
[2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:36.720]  fighter planes in World War II. They attacked Pearl Harbor, flew between velvet ropes and stayed
[2:39:36.720 --> 2:39:40.880]  in the velvet ropes. They were firing torpedoes, driving bombs, but Schumer said he survived
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:49.840]  the new Pearl Harbor. What, shooting that woman in the head or the neck? So, and then Laura Loomers
[2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:55.360]  out of the country on vacation and I talked to her like at 30 minutes this morning. She told
[2:39:55.360 --> 2:39:59.120]  the whole story, but I mean, I'm just recapping it because I babble here, but she can tell you,
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:03.440]  but she's like, you know, I didn't know for my politics till they brought up my politics,
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:08.880]  my Wikipedia. And, and, and, I mean, this is America. Like you've got a Wikipedia page.
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:17.760]  It's like, it's like the Washington Post said that I lost a lawsuit for Sandy Hook. I didn't.
[2:40:17.760 --> 2:40:22.320]  They said I lost a suit for a book called, nobody died of Sandy Hook. I'm not in the book. I didn't
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:26.400]  write the book. Didn't even read the book till I learned that I'd lost a lawsuit over it, which
[2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:30.800]  I didn't. They used that to affect my corporate credit. And they say, well, it says here, you
[2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:36.800]  lost a lawsuit. I mean, folks, these people are sick. And then Laura Loomers is just an articulate,
[2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:41.680]  nice lady that supports basic conservatism. And now they've done this term and then there was a
[2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:46.480]  dude waiting for her house. It goes on from there. So, so Laura, it's not your opinion. This is coming.
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:50.560]  Remember a few years ago, we were telling folks that was censorship. They go, oh, we're not censoring
[2:40:50.560 --> 2:40:55.920]  anybody. Remember those games? Now it's all out in the open. Congress is being censored. The president's
[2:40:55.920 --> 2:40:59.600]  being censored. I mean, this is insane. Where does this go? Well, finish your story. Sorry,
[2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:07.120]  I'm ranting. Well, and then, and then after he goes, oh, we hit the break, start over. He gets
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:11.920]  to your Wikipedia to start there. You've been there two hours. You're waiting. So I'm waiting
[2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:15.600]  there for it. The whole thing took two hours, right? I didn't get out of the airport till about
[2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:19.840]  seven o'clock and the flight landed at five. And so they held me by the baggage claim area for an
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:24.000]  hour. Wouldn't let me touch my own suitcase, treating me like a terrorist. And then they go
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:27.280]  through my bags. And then when he's asking me, oh, what do you do for a living? I say I'm a
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:31.680]  journalist. Then he goes, oh, I'm looking at your Wikipedia page is what they say about you. True.
[2:41:31.680 --> 2:41:36.080]  That's basically a roundabout way of asking. So are you a right wing extremist? And then
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:43.600]  when they were like looking at the Wikipedia page more, he goes, oh, so I'm sure you probably
[2:41:43.600 --> 2:41:49.360]  have a lot of opinions and things to write about regarding what happened in D.C. this last week.
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:54.720]  And like trying to bait me to say something. And I said, well, I've been out of the country for
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:42:00.400]  several weeks, you know. But yeah, we're living in crazy times, right? But they were trying to get
[2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:07.120]  me to basically like talk to them about what I thought about D.C. and this rally while basically
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:10.800]  asking me in a roundabout way. This is like you were being taken in for questioning. So they're
[2:42:10.800 --> 2:42:16.320]  setting up internal checkpoints, then questioned citizens, but illegal aliens and child molesters
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:21.600]  come on in just because we're going to show you. Yeah, well, it's very concerning. And look, the
[2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:28.160]  next step is they're going to start putting people they're going to start using these these
[2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:33.120]  checkpoints and these interrogations to start putting people on no fly lists and then taking
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:38.480]  away their gun rights. And Joe Biden said and Kamala Harris said that they're going to look
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:42.560]  into classifying the proud boys as a terrorist organization. They're going to look into classifying
[2:42:42.560 --> 2:42:47.920]  the MAGA rallies as terrorist activity. And the House and the Senate Democrats are already
[2:42:47.920 --> 2:42:52.000]  drafting legislation to do that. And so what are they going to do? How do you take away
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:57.360]  somebody's gun rights? How do you how do you make it so that people can't leave the country so that
[2:42:57.360 --> 2:43:02.160]  you can keep them confined and under permanent lockdown under these COVID lockdowns? Well,
[2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:06.080]  you designate them as a terrorist and then they get put on the no fly list. And if you're on the
[2:43:06.080 --> 2:43:11.360]  no fly list, then you can't have a weapon. And that's that's how Joe Biden is going to take away
[2:43:11.360 --> 2:43:16.880]  people's guns. They're just going to do massive designations of a political class of people
[2:43:16.880 --> 2:43:21.760]  as domestic terrorists. That's not me saying it. You can just listen to their own words. Okay.
[2:43:21.760 --> 2:43:26.560]  They're literally trying to classify Senator Hawley and Senator Ted Cruz as domestic terrorists
[2:43:26.560 --> 2:43:34.560]  right now. Oh, it gets worse than that. He said they want to put senators on the no fly list.
[2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:41.520]  Well, you just said it. And then I have US Capitol riots. Congressmen accused of abetting
[2:43:41.520 --> 2:43:47.440]  terrorists. Let me show TV viewers overhead shot please. And they show a photo of me at the Georgia
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:53.520]  Capitol peacefully. Like I'm inside. And it says there they are plotting and stalking the building.
[2:43:53.520 --> 2:43:58.320]  She's a former US prosecutor. And she wants us arrested and members of Congress arrested
[2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:07.040]  because she saw them with Ali Alexander. I mean, what the hell? So now if we go in the Capitol,
[2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:14.160]  we're to be arrested because she says so. And then they put a picture up of me at the Georgia
[2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:20.640]  Capitol and say, here they are stalking us. Look, oh, look at this. This is months. Oh,
[2:44:20.640 --> 2:44:26.240]  look, I was at a Capitol. Do you see that? Oh my gosh, we're there. We are planning
[2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:31.680]  everything. Yeah. And there I think it's really interesting. Tell the people to get a photo up
[2:44:31.680 --> 2:44:36.400]  with the state rep Vernon Jones. But now this is all planning the attack. Oh, yes.
[2:44:37.680 --> 2:44:42.640]  Sorry. Yeah, I think it's really interesting how they're trying to act as if the capitals don't
[2:44:42.640 --> 2:44:47.440]  belong to the people. It's called the people's house. And I remember during the social media
[2:44:47.440 --> 2:44:52.640]  hearings when you and I were inside the Capitol sitting next to each other and the Kavanaugh
[2:44:52.640 --> 2:44:56.560]  hearings were taking place at the same exact time. And they scheduled it that way because
[2:44:56.560 --> 2:45:01.200]  they didn't want anybody paying attention to the social media hearings. And Nancy Pelosi
[2:45:01.200 --> 2:45:06.480]  literally put out a tweet to the Capitol police urging them to stand down so that the Democrats
[2:45:06.480 --> 2:45:11.280]  could flood the Capitol and protest against Kavanaugh. And she thanked them and said they
[2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:17.280]  were great American patriots participating in democracy. So if you're protesting, if you're
[2:45:17.280 --> 2:45:24.160]  protesting in favor of abortion, and you're falsely accusing a man of rape, and you're
[2:45:24.160 --> 2:45:30.560]  stalking Jeff Blake and assaulting Senator Rand Paul, that's okay, according to Nancy Pelosi.
[2:45:30.560 --> 2:45:36.480]  Oh, if you shoot Congressman Scalice, you're a hero. But look, right, Jones and Vernon Jones
[2:45:36.480 --> 2:45:40.560]  and Ali Alexander. Look, because they show us getting a group photo together like move here,
[2:45:40.560 --> 2:45:45.680]  move there. Look, oh, here we are caught plotting the attack. Oh, I mean, this is the level of
[2:45:45.680 --> 2:45:51.520]  deception. Right. And that's, and that's the thing. You have a group of people who were violent.
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:56.560]  But most of the people who attended the rally were simply just attending and they're there.
[2:45:56.560 --> 2:46:02.240]  The Democrats now want to pretend like it's a crime to enter the United States Capitol
[2:46:02.240 --> 2:46:07.120]  when anybody can go into the United States Capitol. They have security. They caught us
[2:46:07.120 --> 2:46:12.000]  casing it, you understand, and then even use photos from another Capitol. I mean, I mean,
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:21.280]  I'm caught folks. They caught me. I'm sorry. I was out of the country and I was getting text
[2:46:21.280 --> 2:46:26.880]  messages from reporters here from the Sun Sentinel, which is like a leftist rag that called me a
[2:46:26.880 --> 2:46:32.640]  Nazi during my campaign. And they were like, our readers said they submitted a photo of you to the
[2:46:32.640 --> 2:46:37.520]  FBI tip and said that you were you were at the Capitol. Do you care to comment? I'm like, I've
[2:46:37.520 --> 2:46:42.000]  been out of the country. Like, stop trying to set me up. By the way, we're showing the 1983 and
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:50.320]  the 1971 bombings of the Capitol by the founder of Black Lives Matter, the Weather Underground.
[2:46:51.360 --> 2:46:56.240]  So like, imagine if we to bomb something, which I would never do, it would be the end of the
[2:46:56.240 --> 2:47:04.080]  world. My God, actual bombing. Look, it's going to get worse from this point out, Alex. The next
[2:47:04.080 --> 2:47:08.240]  thing they're going to do is they're going to start denying conservatives insurance. They're
[2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:15.840]  going to start to start happening. Mainline talks say our PR, the PR department of says that you
[2:47:15.840 --> 2:47:20.160]  can't have insurance. And by the way, you've privately bought insurance from them and they
[2:47:20.160 --> 2:47:24.320]  announced they've dumped you. Like, like these people all violate your privacy.
[2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:30.960]  And look, I was I experienced this during my campaign, you know, Comcast shut my campaign
[2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:36.480]  down. If you recall, they have a monopoly on ISPs here in my district, which means that, you know,
[2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:40.640]  majority of the people who live here in Palm Beach County have Comcast Xfinity because they have
[2:47:40.640 --> 2:47:45.200]  contracts with all total election meddling. Stay there. I want to ask you about Uganda. Stay there,
[2:47:45.200 --> 2:47:48.880]  Laura Lumer. Yeah. And we're people actually, where do people find Laura Lumer? Where do we
[2:47:48.880 --> 2:47:55.200]  find your actual website? Well, I'm on my website is Lumer dot com. And then I'm on gab at Laura
[2:47:55.200 --> 2:48:00.160]  Lumer. I'm on telegram at Laura Lumer. And I'm told that parlor is going to be up again soon
[2:48:00.160 --> 2:48:04.160]  because they found a conservative host. And so I'm on parlor at Laura Lumer.
[2:48:05.120 --> 2:48:07.600]  Laura Lumer lives. Please don't forget we live
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:13.280]  at info wars.com and band off video. And you're awesome folks sharing our articles and videos
[2:48:13.280 --> 2:48:16.640]  everywhere because we are all the resistance. But this is just I'm interrupting her a lot
[2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:20.480]  because she's on fire. I'm on fire. This is just so damn dangerous. But hey, isn't she
[2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:24.240]  honored that she's so targeted like I am. And there's there's not many target as much as Trump,
[2:48:24.240 --> 2:48:32.480]  but we are because that's we're effective and we're patriots. Stay with us. Our activated
[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:37.840]  charcoal toothpaste became a best seller overnight because activated charcoal is already one of the
[2:48:37.840 --> 2:48:42.480]  top selling fastest growing toothpaste out there. The problem is a lot of the other over the counter
[2:48:42.480 --> 2:48:47.680]  ones have as pertain as their flavoring very, very toxic. And also they have fluoride in it.
[2:48:47.680 --> 2:48:52.400]  This does not have the fluoride. It doesn't have the additives. This is a concentrated really is
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:56.560]  high quality. It's been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole
[2:48:56.560 --> 2:49:03.120]  COVID martial law garbage. But now it's back in stock info wars. Dr. Jones naturals activated

[2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:38.240]  I want to warn all patriots in the United States and across the world that listening to my voice
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:43.680]  I'm Alex Jones. I've been in this fight 27 years and I've studied every angle of their operations
[2:49:43.680 --> 2:49:50.560]  and I am here to tell you as clear as day they have organizations on message boards and other
[2:49:50.560 --> 2:49:57.120]  groups posing as patriot leaders and posing as President Trump anonymously telling you to have
[2:49:57.120 --> 2:50:03.600]  our marches in all 50 states coming up on the 20th and before that you are being set up. I was there
[2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:09.920]  in DC with a million peaceful people and I watch Antifa and other leftist groups pose our people
[2:50:09.920 --> 2:50:15.520]  and set us up. Thank God the Patriots did not engage in the rioting. So only a few people did
[2:50:15.520 --> 2:50:22.560]  it. So the thing was a misfire. It was a dud but the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters
[2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:27.520]  terrorist and they're planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20th to blame the American
[2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:32.240]  people. Do not be part of it. We are peaceful. We are not violent.
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:39.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:39.040 --> 2:51:00.320]  All right. We are back live.
[2:51:00.320 --> 2:51:09.280]  Laura Loomer is here with us today and I mean we sit here and we warn you that we're the canary in
[2:51:09.280 --> 2:51:15.520]  the coal mine and so they chose Laura Loomer. They chose myself. I was the man they chose. She was
[2:51:15.520 --> 2:51:20.720]  the female they chose for completely platforming. She can't get an Uber. She can't get Airbnb. I mean
[2:51:20.720 --> 2:51:25.280]  they went further on her than me because Alex Jones I was told by security experts is so calm.
[2:51:25.280 --> 2:51:29.280]  There's like 15 of them in Austin. Only reason I didn't is they have trouble because there's
[2:51:29.280 --> 2:51:35.520]  so many Alex Joneses. There's not a lot of Laura Loomer. So Laura I can ask a thousand points here
[2:51:35.520 --> 2:51:40.320]  but what else do you want to get out to this audience right now because these are just insane
[2:51:40.320 --> 2:51:48.000]  times. Well I just want you know I guess I guess you and I I guess the year 2021 is the you know
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:53.920]  I told you so year and I just recall three years ago when you know I confronted Jack Dorsey in
[2:51:53.920 --> 2:52:01.440]  Congress and I was laughed out of the congressional hearing room and taken out by police. And you
[2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:05.680]  know it's very interesting to see all these lawmakers talk about it but they don't support any
[2:52:05.680 --> 2:52:12.400]  you know anti-trust legislation. I currently have my anti-trust lawsuit that I filed in 2018
[2:52:12.400 --> 2:52:17.360]  up for petition in the Supreme Court. So we will see what happens with that but I am still
[2:52:17.360 --> 2:52:22.320]  actively fighting this but people need to prepare because you know the next is the banks if they're
[2:52:22.320 --> 2:52:26.480]  going to ban the presidents of the United States from his bank accounts. If they're going to start
[2:52:26.480 --> 2:52:31.360]  banning people from the city they just banned all Trump contracts from New York City. Enrique
[2:52:31.360 --> 2:52:36.480]  Tario was banned from DC. People are soon going to be banned from from cities. They're going to
[2:52:36.480 --> 2:52:40.480]  have their electric shut off. They're going to have their water. Comcast will start shutting
[2:52:40.480 --> 2:52:44.160]  down. I didn't make an issue out of this but we had the police come to where I was on a rooftop at
[2:52:44.160 --> 2:52:50.000]  OAN at least space up there to do a show. And the police came and said we have a 10 whatever
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:54.160]  call 1030 or something means like officer down there saying you you've you've shot police.
[2:52:54.800 --> 2:52:57.600]  And I said but I haven't they said you have to leave now we're going to arrest you.
[2:52:57.600 --> 2:53:02.800]  They had 20 police cars falling to my hotel and they said get out of DC. I was already leaving
[2:53:02.800 --> 2:53:07.680]  that afternoon. So I said I was actually about to leave fine but that is so fascist Laura.
[2:53:09.120 --> 2:53:14.560]  Well it gets worse and I'm currently dealing with more severe elements of this that you know
[2:53:14.560 --> 2:53:18.880]  I'm currently working through with the legal counsel and I'll be making some more announcements
[2:53:18.880 --> 2:53:25.440]  about another element to this that is even more sinister in the next few days. But don't think
[2:53:25.440 --> 2:53:30.080]  it stops with big tech. I mean they're on a mission to go through the entire Constitution.
[2:53:30.080 --> 2:53:34.000]  They're coming to Roger Stone's house. They're coming to your house. They're coming to my house.
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:39.520]  Sweetheart. It's bad. These are communist. They are and look you know the camps are next. They're
[2:53:39.520 --> 2:53:43.200]  going to start putting us in concentration camps. That's why they're making detention centers and
[2:53:43.200 --> 2:53:47.600]  covid camps. And I know that's the cover. They use covid as the cover for taking you to camps.
[2:53:47.600 --> 2:53:53.280]  I don't watch Fox News anymore but in the hotel I was staying on it was in the background and I
[2:53:53.280 --> 2:53:58.560]  heard them say in New York City they're using FEMA to help facilitate the camps. So when they
[2:53:58.560 --> 2:54:02.720]  called you and I like kooky you know conspiracy nuts when we said that they're going to have FEMA
[2:54:02.720 --> 2:54:07.040]  camps eventually to implement their whole Agenda 21 narrative people said you guys are out of your
[2:54:07.040 --> 2:54:12.320]  damn minds. They are literally creating FEMA camps. By the way Laura you're not being alarmist here
[2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:18.640]  here. By logical extension every case this linear line of tyranny leads to death camps.
[2:54:18.640 --> 2:54:22.880]  That's where it goes and we're already like 80 percent of the way there because it accelerates
[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:28.320]  at the end. Yeah and I remember when you and info wars were with me outside of Twitter headquarters
[2:54:28.320 --> 2:54:33.040]  when I handcuffed myself wearing a yellow star and you know people said oh why is she wearing
[2:54:33.040 --> 2:54:37.360]  a yellow star. She really comparing censorship to the Holocaust. Yeah because the Holocaust
[2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:42.160]  didn't begin with throwing Jews and gas chambers and ovens. It began with financial blacklist
[2:54:42.160 --> 2:54:46.960]  thing and you know using the media to demonize an entire group of people the creation of lists
[2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:51.920]  of undesirables until eventually they created enough hatred for one group and they were able
[2:54:51.920 --> 2:54:56.880]  to convince society. Yeah you know send these people to camps and that's where they got people
[2:54:56.880 --> 2:55:03.440]  to a little more each time a little more a little more. Project Veritas caught PBS legal council
[2:55:03.440 --> 2:55:08.800]  on video saying yeah send the Trump supporters to to to education camps and confiscate their
[2:55:08.800 --> 2:55:14.800]  children. So this isn't a conspiracy theory. PBS gets taxpayer funding from. I think he actually
[2:55:14.800 --> 2:55:20.880]  said kill us send our kids to reeducation camps. Well yeah either way it's just as bad and you
[2:55:20.880 --> 2:55:26.240]  know the real Nazis stay there. We're back in 60 seconds. I want to specifically get into
[2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:32.000]  Twitter saying we can't have Uganda censoring when they're censoring Laura Limber back in 60
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:39.360]  seconds. How about let's show it's historic times then there's a special guest coming up at that.
[2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:46.080]  Now is the time to get prepared. You got to pray to God and get your soul ready. You got to be
[2:55:46.080 --> 2:55:51.440]  prepared to physically defend yourself and your family. You've also got to get things that allow
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:56.080]  you and your family to not be dependent on the system. That's why they want to bankrupt the economy.
[2:55:56.080 --> 2:56:01.440]  It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation because they want all of us on our
[2:56:01.440 --> 2:56:07.920]  knees so they can dictate our surrender to them. Imple Wars is a critical organization in the fight

[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:09.360]  aren't you a victim oh we're so sorry for you I'm just like no I I'm the canary in the coal mine
[2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:15.040]  you're next this is a whole rollout plan the globalists have admitted this I mean Sasha
[2:57:15.040 --> 2:57:21.360]  Barry Cohen says Trump shouldn't have his YouTube at a day later he doesn't and and even the ACLU
[2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:29.360]  finally says this is dangerous so the answer is what happened with angry gypsy woman and Chuck
[2:57:29.360 --> 2:57:35.440]  Schumer in New York saying listen dude you're a fraud the left says go to attack people's houses
[2:57:35.440 --> 2:57:40.320]  it's good the republicans barely do anything you act like they're a bunch of devils you can't act
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:58:06.320]  like this Schumer here it is
[2:58:10.320 --> 2:58:16.320]  actually got sexually excited over it that's how much I love you that's how much I'm glad what
[2:58:16.320 --> 2:58:22.560]  they did and what dancing below she said people do what they do after all she doesn't care about
[2:58:22.560 --> 2:58:29.280]  monuments and neither do I and we're the first amendment doesn't say that you have to protest
[2:58:29.280 --> 2:58:36.640]  peacefully and politely as long as there's outrage and unrest in our hearts there's going to be
[2:58:36.640 --> 2:58:53.360]  unrest in these streets why don't you tell them to stand down did you tell the capital police to
[2:58:53.360 --> 2:59:02.800]  stand down did you tell them to stand down answer the question don't stand down we told the police
[2:59:02.800 --> 2:59:12.400]  to stand down in production Seattle Portland Chicago Boston New York Los Angeles and San Francisco
[2:59:12.400 --> 2:59:18.320]  and you know what these truck supporters are going to go to your house they're going to go to
[2:59:18.320 --> 2:59:23.440]  Pelosi's house they'll destroy her vineyards and I will be right there to support them
[2:59:23.440 --> 2:59:35.200]  don't you say it's enough no no shut up shut up shut the f*** up shut the f*** up this is a racist
[2:59:35.200 --> 2:59:41.280]  he's an anti-semitic he said if you criticize Obama you're a racist but he criticized him against
[2:59:41.280 --> 2:59:48.640]  the Iranian deal not only are you a racist Schumer you're a hypocrite take your hands on me six feet
[2:59:48.640 --> 2:59:56.000]  six feet this don't no six feet I love how she uses her own bs against him so what's happening Lord
[2:59:56.000 --> 3:00:00.880]  Loomer is everywhere including a lot of liberals I know who are old-fashioned liberals they're
[3:00:00.880 --> 3:00:05.040]  pissed they get tyranny they're like you tell people to burn down neighborhoods but people
[3:00:05.040 --> 3:00:09.040]  actually go march and throw a little bit of a fit and you kill a woman and then you act like you
[3:00:09.040 --> 3:00:15.680]  were in Pearl Harbor I mean Schumer is crazy I just have to say I love that lady like she's
[3:00:15.680 --> 3:00:21.840]  you know that's it's just great I love watching politicians get confronted in public man I mean
[3:00:21.840 --> 3:00:24.960]  she really gave it to them but that's the whole thing about their hypocrisy right
[3:00:24.960 --> 3:00:30.480]  they say oh yeah you can't protest but if you're a black lives matter you can protest oh get away
[3:00:30.480 --> 3:00:35.600]  you're gonna give me COVID and then we can't protest but black lives matter can burn down
[3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:41.360]  come in the housing but you know bravo to this woman and we need more people to speak out this
[3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:46.640]  way and she's right she's right everything that she said was was on point and you know if you
[3:00:46.640 --> 3:00:52.000]  recall Pelosi's house has already been visited because you know two years ago I put illegal
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:57.520]  aliens on her lawn so she's right though people are gonna start you know confronting politicians
[3:00:57.520 --> 3:01:03.280]  and rightfully so and that's what the left does right they encourage people to to confront that's
[3:01:03.280 --> 3:01:08.000]  what maxine waters said she said oh you see someone in the Trump administration make sure you make
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:13.280]  them feel really uncomfortable and that's what the left is doing I saw today that they just appointed
[3:01:13.280 --> 3:01:19.760]  AOC to this made-up new committee they made in congress called the committee on combating misinformation
[3:01:20.560 --> 3:01:25.920]  and AOC is already on twitter advocating for parlor to be shut down for telegram to be shut down
[3:01:25.920 --> 3:01:30.160]  and what are they gonna do just deem every single conservative that was my next question is you talk
[3:01:30.160 --> 3:01:35.680]  about organized crime racketeering their government wants things shut down the incorporations do it
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:41.520]  but where is congress where are the states this is like an avalanche of tyranny but here's here's
[3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:47.520]  Mitt Romney getting confronted again in an airport and he got confronted on the plane by other people
[3:01:47.520 --> 3:01:52.880]  so the good news is we're not violent but we're confronting these traders here it is how you're
[3:01:52.880 --> 3:02:01.840]  doing don't tell me what to do good pause oh look put your mask on because we did the numbers
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:06.880]  61,000 more people died in 2020 the year before and normally it's even bigger increases population
[3:02:06.880 --> 3:02:12.160]  increase and baby boomers it's all about their control put your mask on no if you met Romney

[3:02:46.320 --> 3:02:55.520]  votes this election no why not because I'm sorry can you say that again I'm an arrogant
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:03:01.280]  psychopath story but the we have a constitution the constitutional process is clear I'll follow
[3:03:01.280 --> 3:03:05.920]  the constitution and I'll explain no it's not the state's fraudulent ballots well you haven't
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:11.840]  supported him and you didn't even support him in the election no I did not why for reasons I explain
[3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:19.200]  you were voted in as a conservative to represent the conservative constituents period
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:24.640]  that's actually that's not how the constitution works it is you're voted in to represent us you
[3:03:24.640 --> 3:03:31.040]  work for us new world order constitution I work for the people of Utah exactly and I am from Utah
[3:03:31.040 --> 3:03:34.800]  Trump supported his election by the way I voted I know there's a lot of people that didn't vote for
[3:03:34.800 --> 3:03:40.720]  you look at that parasite we'll make sure of that one you'll burn it now that's totally important
[3:03:40.720 --> 3:03:44.560]  you admit it you know it you know it's coming they didn't want you in there anyway so to be
[3:03:44.560 --> 3:03:49.760]  honest with you I wouldn't be surprised if if you weren't even if you weren't even voted in legally
[3:03:49.760 --> 3:03:57.040]  Trump is a juggernaut your legacy is nothing you're a joke absolute joke it's a disgusting shame
[3:03:57.040 --> 3:04:03.040]  all right let's show Lindsay Lightfoot Graham let's let's go to Pellabotter here real quick
[3:04:03.040 --> 3:04:16.000]  here's Lindsay Graham get in front you traitor you traitor you are a traitor to the country
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:18.880]  I have a bunch of securities rallies because everybody's kissing me and grabbing me and
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:23.200]  taking my hand which I love but I gotta get places he has the courage everybody hates him
[3:04:24.960 --> 3:04:29.040]  I'm not trying to brag but I'm like Elvis Presley that they love me and I love them too
[3:04:29.040 --> 3:04:42.160]  but he has the courage as hell hate him let's continue all right this goes on and on Laura we
[3:04:42.160 --> 3:04:47.600]  love you I'm talking about trying to get you to reporting for info wars uh but great job running
[3:04:47.600 --> 3:04:51.760]  for congress great job getting way more points than anybody else ever got running against those
[3:04:51.760 --> 3:04:56.480]  people and we love you and we appreciate you and and and again people are like oh poor Laura Loomer
[3:04:56.480 --> 3:05:01.760]  yeah you've been picked out and and and now it's going to be everybody so so we need that we need
[3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:06.160]  to really do something you know people say people say poor Laura Loomer but when I see videos like
[3:05:06.160 --> 3:05:11.680]  that I know that yes I may be banned but my story is inspiring others and that's called getting
[3:05:11.680 --> 3:05:17.280]  Loomer'd what you just saw on on on the screen right there and nobody was doing that prior to me
[3:05:17.280 --> 3:05:24.880]  and so isn't that the answer that we all nicely confront them everywhere peacefully yeah I haven't
[3:05:24.880 --> 3:05:29.440]  boldened people to start fighting back peacefully and holding their elected officials accountable
[3:05:29.440 --> 3:05:34.160]  and that is something nobody was doing prior to me and so you're right and I'm not going to stop
[3:05:34.160 --> 3:05:40.320]  fighting I'm not going to give up and hopefully our our troubles and you know our experience as the
[3:05:40.320 --> 3:05:47.120]  canary in the coal mine will empower others and hopefully awaken people because what is the irony
[3:05:47.120 --> 3:05:51.200]  that you know president Trump's administration didn't do anything to address tech censorship
[3:05:51.200 --> 3:05:56.320]  and now he's about to be more banned than you and I combined by the way he admits that was a failure
[3:05:56.320 --> 3:06:01.440]  he admits it and he knows that yeah I mean I try to tell him he voted for me and that's the irony
[3:06:01.440 --> 3:06:05.040]  of it is that I would have been his congressional representative in congress and he literally
[3:06:05.040 --> 3:06:09.920]  voted for the most banned woman in the world and I tried to warn them but hopefully it's not too late
[3:06:09.920 --> 3:06:15.040]  hopefully you know solutions can be found but well that's right we've got these globalists on
[3:06:15.040 --> 3:06:18.640]  top of us right now but we're gonna we're gonna fight back politically and I pray to god all right
[3:06:18.640 --> 3:06:23.840]  Laura Lummer thank you so much yeah thank you amazing amazing so now Homeland Security pulls her
[3:06:23.840 --> 3:06:28.240]  out when she flies back in the U.S. and asks her about her political views uh John Robbport's coming
[3:06:28.240 --> 3:06:33.440]  up I'm gonna introduce him straight ahead he's got a lot of news to cover the medical tyranny
[3:06:33.440 --> 3:06:35.040]  is way past already being here
[3:06:39.200 --> 3:06:47.120]  the resistance not video the resistance not video the resistance not video the resistance
[3:06:47.120 --> 3:06:56.800]  not video the resistance not video the resistance not video info wars dot com news wars dot com
[3:06:57.360 --> 3:07:03.680]  band dot video and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned that's why every month
[3:07:03.680 --> 3:07:11.360]  we launch a new URL before they ban it but Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our
[3:07:11.360 --> 3:07:19.680]  tail but the new website is the resistance dot video the resistance dot video they're trying to
[3:07:19.680 --> 3:07:25.280]  block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them so the new URL that links right to
[3:07:25.280 --> 3:07:30.080]  band dot video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports
[3:07:30.080 --> 3:07:35.680]  and all the suppressed information is at the resistance dot video share the link the resistance
[3:07:35.680 --> 3:07:42.480]  dot video the resistance not video mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you doing
[3:07:42.480 --> 3:07:47.120]  alex man i'm just working as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love
[3:07:47.120 --> 3:07:53.360]  you man i want to uh make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while
[3:07:53.360 --> 3:07:58.560]  and i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains quercetin
[3:07:58.560 --> 3:08:06.240]  which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ion of four
[3:08:06.240 --> 3:08:12.560]  similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to
[3:08:12.560 --> 3:08:18.880]  take a look at that if all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end
[3:08:18.880 --> 3:08:23.280]  products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor itself
[3:08:23.280 --> 3:08:26.720]  like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost
[3:08:26.720 --> 3:08:31.840]  them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's
[3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:58.320]  what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug you're listening to the alex jones show

[3:13:01.360 --> 3:13:05.920]  and and just be safe because this is the globalist making their move john rather port taking over
[3:13:05.920 --> 3:13:20.640]  here's always for our weekly chat so i want to amplify what's been on the table here
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:29.360]  typical intelligence agency operation you equate one thing with another
[3:13:29.360 --> 3:13:38.720]  here now as many of you know since the fake pandemic broke out i've been writing articles
[3:13:38.720 --> 3:13:45.520]  and talking about this incessantly taking it apart piece by piece on so many different levels
[3:13:47.760 --> 3:13:49.520]  medical cartel at work
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:14:02.160]  COVID lockdowns COVID restrictions COVID imprisonments COVID say in your homes can't go out
[3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:11.920]  all over the world imprisonment shutdowns of businesses destroyed businesses bankruptcies
[3:14:11.920 --> 3:14:22.320]  just untold numbers of destroyed lives that's the operation but now you see with the
[3:14:22.880 --> 3:14:31.040]  capital break-in and all of the aftershocks promoted by media and government oh there's
[3:14:31.040 --> 3:14:36.640]  danger everywhere and all of these trump supporters are getting ready to do horrible violence and so
[3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:46.960]  and so and so the big equals sign is now protests against COVID lockdowns equals
[3:14:48.160 --> 3:14:53.520]  capital break-in it's all the same thing see it's all the same people it's all the same
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:14:59.360]  insanity it's all anti-vaxxers it's all anti-government insurrectionists it's all
[3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:07.920]  this is how they do it this is a typical type covert op intelligence agency
[3:15:08.640 --> 3:15:18.000]  operation equating one thing with another in the people's minds as mind control as psi op as
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:32.880]  planned operation so that if let's say a hundred bereft business owners whose lives and businesses
[3:15:32.880 --> 3:15:40.720]  have been destroyed by the COVID lockdowns were to gather together in a protest today or tomorrow
[3:15:40.720 --> 3:15:52.400]  near a governor's office the press would characterize it as a dangerous copycat potentially
[3:15:52.960 --> 3:16:03.040]  explosive violent capital tight break-in dc january 6th equals equals equals equals equals
[3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:12.400]  equals that's intelligence agency mind control par excellence that's what they do that's how
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:19.520]  these ops are planned that's the way they're carried out somewhere in the world the cia gets
[3:16:19.520 --> 3:16:26.640]  the idea we have to maintain a dictator in power because he makes deals with mega corporations
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:33.760]  to loot and plunder his country and that's what we want so let's take a look at the rebel force
[3:16:33.760 --> 3:16:40.720]  that is trying to unseat this dictator to have free elections how can we characterize that
[3:16:40.720 --> 3:16:49.680]  rebel force oh we'll say that they're actually part of a cult that is killing killing children
[3:16:49.680 --> 3:16:57.600]  in the countryside and we'll promote this idea the equals sign you see in the press on the radio
[3:16:57.600 --> 3:17:04.640]  etc etc etc and turn the people of that country against the rebel force that simply wants to
[3:17:04.640 --> 3:17:11.200]  have free elections and make them into demons and devils and thereby keep the dictator in power
[3:17:11.760 --> 3:17:17.440]  it's just a typical intelligence agency operation and that's what's going on now
[3:17:17.440 --> 3:17:28.480]  now as a way of squashing the covid protests against imprisonment stay tuned there's a lot
[3:17:28.480 --> 3:17:30.480]  more right after the break
[3:17:36.480 --> 3:17:40.800]  the pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[3:17:40.800 --> 3:17:45.680]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income which of course the united
[3:17:45.680 --> 3:17:49.520]  nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a
[3:17:49.520 --> 3:17:55.600]  chip under your skin it's all now completely official part of the un great reset of the
[3:17:55.600 --> 3:18:00.720]  devils group and claus schwaub all officially written about in hundreds of books by schwaub
[3:18:00.720 --> 3:18:06.560]  and rocker feller foundation all the rest of them at june 21 into 2030 it's here and only gets worse
[3:18:06.560 --> 3:18:13.200]  like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all and the rejection
[3:18:13.200 --> 3:18:19.120]  starts with realizing it's spiritual battle the first evil and stopping abortion we must
[3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:24.720]  start valuing human life again we must start saying that we are not expendable that we are
[3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:32.400]  not disposable that we are essential until we do that we are all slaves we must stand up and declare
[3:18:32.400 --> 3:18:40.560]  our basic god-given human rights now now is the time to get prepared you got to pray to god get
[3:18:40.560 --> 3:18:45.840]  your soul ready you got to be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family and you've also
[3:18:45.840 --> 3:18:51.200]  got to get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the system that's why they
[3:18:51.200 --> 3:18:55.920]  want to bankrupt the economy it's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation

[3:21:03.600 --> 3:21:15.120]  show and now your host john rapaport okay so we're going to continue here with what i was talking
[3:21:15.120 --> 3:21:25.040]  about before the break this uh does not mean of course that protests against covid lockdowns are
[3:21:25.040 --> 3:21:34.160]  illegitimate or illegal they are quite legal but my advice is to make sure that you're very articulate
[3:21:34.160 --> 3:21:42.640]  about what you're protesting against press releases statements as alex was saying you know
[3:21:43.840 --> 3:21:51.600]  insignia signs whatever is necessary to make it absolutely clear this is a protest against
[3:21:51.600 --> 3:22:00.320]  this brutal inhumane unconstitutional covid lockdowns that's what we're about that's what
[3:22:00.320 --> 3:22:06.560]  this is so that they can't paint you with that broad brush and say oh this is another horrendous
[3:22:06.560 --> 3:22:12.480]  you know potential violent capital break in a blah blah blah blah blah right which is the
[3:22:12.480 --> 3:22:20.800]  intelligence agency op now the other favorite word of course that they're using here is insurrection
[3:22:20.800 --> 3:22:27.440]  they love this word over and over and over again to describe the capital break in and what they are
[3:22:27.440 --> 3:22:36.960]  claiming is all of the fallout uh many other potential outbreaks of violence that the doj is
[3:22:36.960 --> 3:22:44.080]  claiming are about to happen or being planned by the same people who broke into the capital
[3:22:44.080 --> 3:22:52.400]  spreading this around like cream cheese everywhere on the media to make sure that everybody thinks
[3:22:52.400 --> 3:22:58.800]  of any protest about anything as an act of insurrection which is most certainly not and
[3:22:58.800 --> 3:23:05.520]  the doj recently announced that they are on the hunt for the people who broke into the capital
[3:23:05.520 --> 3:23:12.560]  and they have a broad menu of charges that they are issuing that they are following up on this
[3:23:12.560 --> 3:23:21.680]  is meant to impress the american people all the way from criminal trespass uh onto uh assault
[3:23:23.440 --> 3:23:30.560]  illegal firearms possession uh sedition conspiracy etc etc etc right
[3:23:33.200 --> 3:23:42.320]  well what about the antifa blm led street riots across the country for the last
[3:23:42.320 --> 3:23:50.080]  months looting burning destroying assault on people couldn't you classify that as a form of quote
[3:23:50.080 --> 3:24:01.120]  insurrection where was the menu of doj charges against that nowhere why weren't tremendous
[3:24:02.560 --> 3:24:09.760]  scrolls of charges rolled out against those people who went far beyond any semblance of
[3:24:09.760 --> 3:24:18.400]  relationship to really uh police brutality but no nothing like that happened whatsoever absolutely
[3:24:18.400 --> 3:24:25.920]  not has nothing to do with anything this is an entirely different subject uh because it's on
[3:24:25.920 --> 3:24:34.560]  the left whereas we say the government the doj that these insurrectionists you see are on the right
[3:24:34.560 --> 3:24:40.800]  and we make that distinction and therefore we compile this incredible list of charges that
[3:24:40.800 --> 3:24:48.960]  we are now going to pursue against anybody that we deem to be associated with or connected to
[3:24:49.920 --> 3:24:57.840]  or equal to the people who broke into the capital it's that intelligence agency mindset and op
[3:24:57.840 --> 3:25:06.960]  again mind control a equals b b equals a a equals c this kind of protest equals that
[3:25:06.960 --> 3:25:13.680]  kind of protest since this is a horrendous crime which we are prosecuting then this one over here
[3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:18.720]  which is being undertaken for a completely different reason but we're all we're equating it
[3:25:18.720 --> 3:25:25.280]  to the first one and therefore that's a horrendous crime as well brainwash washing the public
[3:25:25.280 --> 3:25:36.240]  on a new level with a new issuance of mind control and psi op to believe that any protests
[3:25:36.240 --> 3:25:44.240]  for any reason now is equal to insurrection and everybody has to shut up and have eyes straight
[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:53.280]  ahead and wear masks and march into the new world order now i think that kellen mcgreen and i were
[3:25:53.280 --> 3:25:58.480]  thinking the same thought at the same time because it seems like either yesterday or the day before
[3:25:59.120 --> 3:26:06.000]  we wrote an article on the same arcane subject which turns out not to be arcane at all about the
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:18.240]  astounding susan rozenberg case of 1983 which has repercussions up until today and to put it in a
[3:26:18.240 --> 3:26:29.440]  nutshell in 1978 susan rozenberg and her female it was an all-female revolutionary group broke off
[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:38.240]  from whether underground and other revolutionary groups informed a secret group called m19 small
[3:26:38.240 --> 3:26:46.640]  group and proceeded to assemble huge amounts of weapons and explosives and so forth into a storage
[3:26:46.640 --> 3:26:56.160]  locker in cherry hill new jersey this group m19 was eventually prosecuted for a number of crimes
[3:26:56.720 --> 3:27:03.440]  including murders of several law enforcement officials during a prankstruck robbery of 1.6
[3:27:03.440 --> 3:27:13.360]  million dollars explosions that were set off along the eastern seaboard and on the night of november
[3:27:13.360 --> 3:27:24.400]  7th 1983 a bomb a massive bomb that was set in the capital building that went off late at night
[3:27:24.400 --> 3:27:30.560]  near the cloakroom of the senate and reeked anywhere from a quarter of a million to a million
[3:27:30.560 --> 3:27:38.400]  dollars of destruction but fortunately no one was injured a phone call came in to the switchboard
[3:27:38.400 --> 3:27:44.880]  saying evacuate the place a bomb is going to go off sound a little bit like nashville recently
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:57.520]  well anyway members were sent to prison the storage locker supply was discovered on a tip
[3:27:58.400 --> 3:28:05.760]  by police forwarded to the fbi they raided the locker and discovered not only massive amounts
[3:28:05.760 --> 3:28:12.480]  of weapons and ammo but explosives and containers open containers that were leaking nitro blizzard
[3:28:14.720 --> 3:28:22.080]  so members of this group went to prison one of them was susan rozenberg she went to prison for 58
[3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:29.680]  years on charges explosive charges as they say she was not prosecuted for other crimes of this
[3:28:29.680 --> 3:28:39.120]  revolutionary group m 19 apparently because she was already in prison 58 years however
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:47.440]  as one of his last acts in his presidency bill clinton pardoned her and set her free
[3:28:50.240 --> 3:28:59.440]  so you see this insurrection was pardoned and forgiven by a u.s president and no fall out
[3:28:59.440 --> 3:29:08.800]  no problem no big deal no crazed media you know yes there were critiques of clinton but it was all
[3:29:08.800 --> 3:29:16.160]  very measured it was nothing like now however that's not the end of the story this is an
[3:29:16.160 --> 3:29:23.760]  incredible story i hope you're you know following this because years later susan rozenberg turns up
[3:29:23.760 --> 3:29:30.960]  as a board member of a group called thousand currents you can even check this out on snopes
[3:29:30.960 --> 3:29:40.000]  which i did they readily admit this and as late as 2015 2015 16 she was certainly on the board
[3:29:40.640 --> 3:29:48.240]  and now excuse me thousand currents has removed the names of the board members from their website
[3:29:48.240 --> 3:29:55.600]  why is this important because thousand currents is a fiscal money fundraiser
[3:29:57.040 --> 3:30:06.480]  and administrator for black lives matter networks now now and so we have this fantastic
[3:30:07.680 --> 3:30:16.160]  series of dots susan rozenberg m 19 revolutionary group bombs capital 1983
[3:30:16.160 --> 3:30:26.560]  jail 58 years pardon bill clinton now board member thousand currents funds black lives matter
[3:30:26.560 --> 3:30:33.600]  which participates in violent acts cross america and riots stay tuned we'll be back

[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:15.360]  this is a knbc news update here is john beard good evening police in washington dc are
[3:35:15.360 --> 3:35:19.600]  investigating a bombing tonight at the us capital no injuries we expect pictures at 11
[3:35:19.600 --> 3:35:29.440]  okay last segment here today i want to remind you of a few other things too
[3:35:31.600 --> 3:35:38.960]  one of the ideas here of the impeachment and insurrection this and insurrection that and so
[3:35:38.960 --> 3:35:44.960]  forth is to make sure that trump can't make a comeback in 2024 it's to try to turn them into
[3:35:44.960 --> 3:35:53.520]  a non-person erase him good otherwise why bother to do all of this in the last 10 days they want
[3:35:53.520 --> 3:35:59.440]  to try to impeach him try him in senate uh you know turn them into a non-person basically
[3:36:00.960 --> 3:36:08.960]  because they know that there's always a chance that he could come back with his 70 80 million
[3:36:08.960 --> 3:36:19.440]  people in 2024 so they have to turn everything that he says and everything that his supporters say
[3:36:20.160 --> 3:36:28.320]  into dangerous language and insurrection that's part of the intelligence agency type operation on
[3:36:28.320 --> 3:36:35.760]  social media it isn't just censorship it is certainly that to shut it down silence it
[3:36:35.760 --> 3:36:45.680]  etc etc but it's also to characterize any rhetoric in favor of trump anything that he's ever done
[3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:53.840]  or said as dangerous see therefore we have to censor it therefore we have to shut it out
[3:36:53.840 --> 3:37:01.280]  and therefore you the public must look at it as dangerous must look at him as a clear and present
[3:37:01.280 --> 3:37:08.720]  danger to the republic let's look at his supporters as clear and dangerous to the republic etc etc
[3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:17.040]  simply because we big tech social media say it's dangerous it does violate our
[3:37:17.040 --> 3:37:26.160]  boat standards etc etc this is again the operation a typical intelligence agency type
[3:37:26.160 --> 3:37:32.880]  operation you look at a situation you say okay who's the opposition here that we want to
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:42.640]  shut down discredit okay there they are what are they saying okay yes yes yes all right
[3:37:42.640 --> 3:37:51.280]  so we have to make all of that into something threatening something uh perilous something
[3:37:51.280 --> 3:37:59.680]  dangerous something that the public will now view in total as oh we better stay away from that
[3:38:00.240 --> 3:38:06.720]  so let's begin let's just selectively censor it say we have to shut this off because this could
[3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:14.720]  lead people to committing violent actions again the big equals sign saying abc the election was
[3:38:14.720 --> 3:38:22.160]  stolen or something equals violent action of course it doesn't has nothing to do with it but
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:28.320]  you make that big equal sign by propaganda the psi op the mind control and people begin to think
[3:38:28.320 --> 3:38:40.480]  this way this is just i mean straight ahead simple 101 type cia type operation carried out in countries
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:49.920]  all over the world find the opponent see what they're saying discredit it discredit it by equating
[3:38:49.920 --> 3:38:58.240]  it to something that is violent and dangerous and therefore should be shut down and ignored and uh
[3:38:59.120 --> 3:39:06.400]  backed away from by the people see it's like oh is the horror look at that look at what was being
[3:39:06.400 --> 3:39:13.600]  said there the election was stolen they're still saying that now that's equivalent to violent break-in
[3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:22.480]  at capital uh insurrection uh can't stand it no have to shut it to have to go away from it don't
[3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:29.760]  pay any attention to it see it's no longer just we don't like that rhetoric we think it's wrong
[3:39:29.760 --> 3:39:37.520]  we think it's crazy the people have no basis for saying that about and now it's escalated on to a
[3:39:37.520 --> 3:39:50.880]  different level typical intelligence agency type operation standard white standard it's the sort
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:58.160]  of closeout phase okay so now we've demeaned this kind of language about stolen election
[3:39:58.160 --> 3:40:05.520]  and we've accused it of being fraudulent of being uh doesn't hold up is the courts have thrown it out
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:13.840]  the lawyers who are promoting it are crazy it hasn't flown it means nothing biden was legitimately
[3:40:13.840 --> 3:40:20.320]  elected everybody knows that okay we've done that phase now now the next phase is we have to make that
[3:40:20.320 --> 3:40:30.560]  that stolen election rhetoric seem to be far worse than just wrong crazy etc now we have
[3:40:30.560 --> 3:40:40.960]  to make it seem like it's the equivalent of smashed windows bullets flying insurrection
[3:40:40.960 --> 3:40:48.880]  against the government violent overthrow the threat is everywhere it's all the trump supporters
[3:40:48.880 --> 3:40:56.560]  who are doing it etc equals equals equals equals that's how these things are built
[3:40:57.920 --> 3:41:05.280]  that's how they're promoted and so to wonder why all media organizations and government
[3:41:05.280 --> 3:41:13.760]  agencies are falling into line lockstep is easy to see if you look at it as if it were an intelligence
[3:41:13.760 --> 3:41:22.960]  agency mockingbird type operation planned the built from the ground up
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:35.280]  strategy time honored time worn useful strategy here we go phase two phase two of the operation
[3:41:35.280 --> 3:41:45.600]  people need to look at it that way and see it that way so that they can strategize more
[3:41:45.600 --> 3:41:51.680]  effectively i'm talking to you now these of the protests against the lockdowns
[3:41:51.680 --> 3:41:57.520]  protests against constitutional violations these of either lockdowns the line that can
[3:41:57.520 --> 3:42:02.960]  never be crossed in the constitution that says you may not destroy the person's right to
[3:42:02.960 --> 3:42:11.120]  live out in the open and free and work for a living for any reason whatsoever that's the spirit
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:19.360]  and the meaning and the essence of the constitution how do you get that message across in a time when
[3:42:19.920 --> 3:42:26.400]  everything that is being said about the basis of the republic and the constitution is now being
[3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:33.040]  equated to violence overthrow insurrection well it takes some thought it takes some planning it takes
[3:42:33.040 --> 3:42:39.840]  some imagination it takes some smarts it takes some brains it takes some balls it takes some courage
[3:42:39.840 --> 3:42:51.120]  it takes some articulation that's what i'm demanding that in this period of escalation
[3:42:51.120 --> 3:42:58.560]  in this intelligence agency type operation you are aware of what's at work how the psi
[3:42:58.560 --> 3:43:07.040]  off works the mind control and so on so that you can see your way around it we are protesting the
[3:43:07.040 --> 3:43:14.240]  covid lockdowns well what about the above above no that's not why we're here you're trying to make
[3:43:14.240 --> 3:43:20.400]  that association we're here because our lives are being destroyed by the destruction of the
[3:43:20.400 --> 3:43:28.400]  economy under brutal lockdowns which are unnecessary and counterproductive that's why we're here
[3:43:28.400 --> 3:43:37.680]  because these measures are unconstitutional they're against all americans all people that's why
[3:43:37.680 --> 3:43:44.320]  we're here that's what we're doing yeah but what about because you know people are just
[3:43:44.320 --> 3:43:52.080]  showing that because your anti-vagabatism no we're doing it because we stand for the law
[3:43:52.080 --> 3:43:57.360]  the nation that lives under the law under the constitution and because the right to live
[3:43:57.360 --> 3:44:03.920]  and work and be free is part of the law that everybody would acknowledge everybody would
[3:44:03.920 --> 3:44:11.040]  acknowledge there is room for debate and discussion in america it's called free speech and it's
[3:44:11.040 --> 3:44:16.480]  guaranteed by the constitution and that's why we're here that's what we're doing
[3:44:18.320 --> 3:44:30.320]  yeah but no you're wrong again understanding how to operate in this highly inflated and explosive
[3:44:30.320 --> 3:44:37.680]  period of time is essential to winning the battle for freedom which by the way in case you haven't
[3:44:37.680 --> 3:44:48.240]  noticed is historically an eternal battle much sacrifice has been made over the eons and centuries
[3:44:48.240 --> 3:44:59.520]  to achieve what we have the remnants of individual freedom the battle goes on we are in that battle
[3:44:59.520 --> 3:45:07.440]  and so i am pointing out the strategies that are being used against us so that it becomes clear
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:18.160]  how to navigate in these times in these circumstances that's what it's about right now thank you very
[3:45:18.160 --> 3:45:30.640]  much john raport see you next time
