[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.300]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.300 --> 00:37.320]  Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'll be your
[00:37.320 --> 00:41.480]  host today Alex will be joining us in the next segment briefly this is
[00:41.480 --> 00:49.780]  February the 19th 2015 and everybody is talking about the coming of artificial
[00:49.780 --> 00:53.900]  intelligence is it going to be an existential threat to humanity is it
[00:53.900 --> 00:58.920]  going to wipe out humanity of course we've had the utopian visions of Ray
[00:58.920 --> 01:02.820]  Kurzweil but we're going to be talking today to one of the pioneers of
[01:02.820 --> 01:07.820]  artificial intelligence Dr. Hugo de Geras I would call his work that he put
[01:07.820 --> 01:12.940]  out about 10 years ago the Artelect War I would call it a seminal step in the
[01:12.940 --> 01:16.020]  discussion as to where we're going with artificial intelligence of course he
[01:16.020 --> 01:20.600]  believes that it's not only probable but inevitable that we are going to have
[01:20.600 --> 01:25.780]  super intelligent machines that we begin it that they finish it think of a
[01:25.780 --> 01:30.780]  terminator where the Skynet became self-aware and then malevolent he is
[01:30.780 --> 01:35.260]  definitely in the dystopian camp as we have also seen with Elon Musk with
[01:35.260 --> 01:39.060]  Stephen Hawkins even Bill Gates came out and said he was concerned about it
[01:39.060 --> 01:42.520]  even though Microsoft was saying no we're not concerned about it at all it's
[01:42.520 --> 01:46.980]  just fine and of course Ray Kurzweil is working with Google they've been busy
[01:46.980 --> 01:51.500]  acquiring all of the key technologies the key companies that are developing the
[01:51.500 --> 01:55.420]  technologies that would be used for artificial robots and I think even more
[01:55.420 --> 02:02.740]  troubling in the near term is a war between an over not over artificial
[02:02.740 --> 02:05.240]  intelligence whether it's going to be developed of course that's the central
[02:05.240 --> 02:09.420]  premise of Dr. DeGaris we're going to talk to him about that what concerns
[02:09.420 --> 02:13.860]  mean so much is that it's going to be used by the elites that it won't be
[02:13.860 --> 02:17.620]  necessarily a war over artificial intelligence but a war using artificial
[02:17.620 --> 02:21.620]  intelligence and we keep seeing this come up over and over again throughout
[02:21.620 --> 02:24.460]  these DARPA projects so we're going to talk to him about what the state of the
[02:24.460 --> 02:28.300]  art is right now with artificial intelligence we're going to have him
[02:28.300 --> 02:33.900]  make his case for the inevitability of not only artificial intelligence the
[02:33.900 --> 02:38.100]  Artilex as he calls them but also of a conflict between what he calls two
[02:38.100 --> 02:42.540]  groups of humans the Cosmos and the Terrans not as terrorists but people who
[02:42.540 --> 02:47.940]  are concerned about humanity about the earth who want to somehow get control of
[02:47.940 --> 02:50.740]  this technology he believes is going to get out of control and I think one of
[02:50.740 --> 02:55.500]  the most interesting things about this is what I would call the paradox that
[02:55.500 --> 02:59.980]  you see in his work he's drawn to do this even though he believes it's going
[02:59.980 --> 03:03.740]  to result in the extinction of humanity we're also going to be joined in the
[03:03.740 --> 03:07.540]  third hour by Paul Joseph Watson from the UK we'll talk to him about some
[03:07.540 --> 03:12.620]  breaking news stories there's a lot happening today we've got Obama's secret
[03:12.620 --> 03:17.500]  internet regulations are starting to get some scrutiny of course everything that
[03:17.500 --> 03:21.340]  the government does is secret whether it's Obamacare that we have to pass be
[03:21.340 --> 03:25.540]  so we can find out what's in it just like we see with the transatlantic
[03:25.540 --> 03:29.380]  partnership the Trans Pacific partnership being negotiated in secret by
[03:29.380 --> 03:33.220]  corporate lobbyists and of course our representatives our senators our
[03:33.220 --> 03:36.740]  congressmen are not allowed to see what that is it's going to be rushed
[03:36.740 --> 03:40.660]  through with a fast track they'll be presented with a large bill just as they
[03:40.660 --> 03:45.100]  were with Obamacare no time to read it not allowed to change it we're seeing
[03:45.100 --> 03:48.580]  that that is happening now with the bureaucracy within our own country with
[03:48.580 --> 03:53.540]  the FCC the FEC is also talking about making new vast regulations that are
[03:53.540 --> 03:58.140]  going to regulate content of political speech I guess we're going to have
[03:58.140 --> 04:01.260]  mandatory vaccines where we have to take the vaccines before we can find out
[04:01.260 --> 04:05.580]  what's in them as well there's nothing but contempt from the elites in terms of
[04:05.580 --> 04:10.660]  what we should know about what's going on and of course there's not only DARPA
[04:10.660 --> 04:16.180]  but there's also an agency called IRPA the intelligence advanced research
[04:16.180 --> 04:22.260]  project and they're busy working on predictions in terms of using artificial
[04:22.260 --> 04:25.780]  intelligence as we talk about it in the broader sense using that to predict
[04:25.780 --> 04:30.100]  societal trends to predict possible conflicts civil war disease outbreaks
[04:30.100 --> 04:34.300]  this is what they're doing they're wargaming the future they're looking
[04:34.300 --> 04:37.980]  at the possibilities that's what we're going to do today with Hugo Degueres if
[04:37.980 --> 04:40.620]  they're wargaming this don't you think you should be concerned about what's
[04:40.620 --> 04:44.780]  going to happen in the future stay with us we'll be right back
[04:44.780 --> 05:03.020]  the government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo at

[08:28.980 --> 08:33.300]  jones we're about to go live to david night at the info wars.com news center
[08:33.300 --> 08:38.300]  in austin I'm finishing up some family illness issues that should be complete
[08:38.300 --> 08:45.500]  in the next few days there is so much happening in the world right now that
[08:45.500 --> 08:50.580]  it's mind-blowing that's why you're all tuning in that's why I'm here it's
[08:50.580 --> 08:55.140]  incredible we've got a guest coming up later in the broadcast who's one of the
[08:55.140 --> 08:59.700]  world experts on AI and who is predicting there will be a war between
[08:59.700 --> 09:03.420]  artificial intelligence and humans and that's what the Pentagon and many other
[09:03.420 --> 09:07.620]  experts believe so they're racing to build the AI first hoping that they'll
[09:07.620 --> 09:12.940]  control it we're living in 2015 DARPA's coming out saying yes people will have
[09:12.940 --> 09:18.220]  brain chips yes we will merge the machines by 2030 notice they were saying
[09:18.220 --> 09:23.020]  2045 now they're saying 2030 next they'll say 2020 everything's being compressed
[09:23.020 --> 09:28.380]  everything's being accelerated and David night is a lot of research on this so
[09:28.380 --> 09:32.820]  coming up we'll definitely want to get that whole analysis also if you visit
[09:32.820 --> 09:37.340]  info wars.com you notice that Italy is having to put troops on the street Kurt
[09:37.340 --> 09:40.740]  Nemo has an article about that because ISIS now says they're going to flood
[09:40.740 --> 09:46.380]  Europe with 500,000 immigrants is psychological operation now when you
[09:46.380 --> 09:49.700]  pull back and realize this is Saudi Arabia doing this and working with Obama
[09:49.700 --> 09:53.060]  and the globalist it is a psychological operation to create the clash of
[09:53.060 --> 09:57.140]  civilizations then radical Islam is given the whole Middle East Africa and
[09:57.140 --> 10:01.300]  much of Asia the globalists are able to turn us into a police state in the bargain
[10:01.300 --> 10:05.180]  that Saudi Arabia carries out to launch more terror attacks here in America just
[10:05.180 --> 10:10.780]  like the 28 pages of the secret report now proves that Saudi Arabia was
[10:10.780 --> 10:15.540]  quarterbacking the 9-11 attacks so we see all this coming into view we see
[10:15.540 --> 10:22.380]  Obama with the summit openly saying that this is all about extremist period and
[10:22.380 --> 10:27.020]  he won't even call Islamist radicals extremist now I don't want to kill the
[10:27.020 --> 10:30.180]  Muslims I have a lot of friends from college and high school that are Muslims
[10:30.180 --> 10:34.140]  are nice hard-working entrepreneurs and good people and so the cliche that all
[10:34.140 --> 10:37.500]  the Muslims want to blow us up I don't agree with that I'm not Islamophobic but
[10:37.500 --> 10:42.980]  I am radical Islamophobic and that is becoming the dominant form of Islam by
[10:42.980 --> 10:49.540]  the sword it is taking over just as Saudi Arabia took over from 1901 to 1932
[10:49.540 --> 10:55.900]  they have 200 square miles and 30 years later they had Syria what's Saudi
[10:55.900 --> 11:00.580]  Arabia a whole bunch of other areas with British intelligence financing them so
[11:00.580 --> 11:04.340]  this thing of using al-Qaeda to attack the Russians and al-Qaeda to attack us on
[11:04.340 --> 11:09.500]  9-11 all this it's just a repeat they're a secret army a globalist cut out now
[11:09.500 --> 11:12.980]  the idiots on the ground fighting and killing are just pirates that want to rape
[11:12.980 --> 11:17.900]  and murder their psychopaths they're delusional they're in the news they say
[11:17.900 --> 11:21.180]  Jesus the prophet will come back and fight for them if they think Jesus is a
[11:21.180 --> 11:26.300]  prophet not the son of God all of this is social engineering on a mass scale
[11:26.300 --> 11:31.020]  all of this notice that it's Western governments flooding our countries not
[11:31.020 --> 11:34.540]  just with Muslims but with Muslims from the most radical areas and then saying
[11:34.540 --> 11:38.420]  race for terror attack we've got to now take your freedoms but then meanwhile the
[11:38.420 --> 11:41.660]  summits are all about gun owners and conservatives and that's the Justice
[11:41.660 --> 11:46.460]  Department's main focus we already know this info wars broke this as you know
[11:46.460 --> 11:49.660]  with the myack report on other documents but now we have to get this out to
[11:49.660 --> 11:53.140]  everyone else who doesn't understand it don't think just because you understand
[11:53.140 --> 12:00.300]  this other people understand this also we need to be understand perception just
[12:00.300 --> 12:06.060]  like they say there's record gun deaths but gun deaths are down since 1991 51
[12:06.060 --> 12:10.380]  percent FBI's on members the news is able to show all the gun deaths and I'm
[12:10.380 --> 12:13.980]  shifting gears right here just into psych control and how they spend things
[12:13.980 --> 12:18.060]  just to keep our mind on that so gun deaths are way down but they're telling
[12:18.060 --> 12:22.180]  us it's way up just like every day we have articles on info wars calm and I've
[12:22.180 --> 12:25.540]  told my writers continue to do it showing police killing innocent people
[12:25.540 --> 12:30.180]  doing horrible things but remember that's actually not up in the statistics in
[12:30.180 --> 12:34.660]  fact in some areas it's down because of media attention it creates the
[12:34.660 --> 12:38.820]  perception that the police are out of control what's out of control is the
[12:38.820 --> 12:43.220]  central government trying to warp the police into something truly evil and
[12:43.220 --> 12:48.300]  they're pushing and promoting all this anti cop stuff to then make the cops
[12:48.300 --> 12:52.180]  basically go under a psychology of only working with the feds and a gang
[12:52.180 --> 12:56.260]  mentality because they feel persecuted instead of us embracing the police and
[12:56.260 --> 12:59.940]  promoting a bill of rights culture that's what the enemy doesn't want so we post
[12:59.940 --> 13:03.500]  the articles of the wrongdoing so the bad cops get in trouble but that's only to
[13:03.500 --> 13:07.780]  clean up the police departments not to demonize the police in general local
[13:07.780 --> 13:13.300]  government local control farmers markets by America this is all the answer and I'm
[13:13.300 --> 13:16.580]  just skipping around here because there's so much news to cover let's walk
[13:16.580 --> 13:21.940]  over to the computer right now ladies and gentlemen Anthony Guciardi is on
[13:21.940 --> 13:26.500]  camera for me woman calls cops for help against intruders cops show up and
[13:26.500 --> 13:30.900]  shoot her dead well yeah they made a mistake and it's terrible it's bad
[13:30.900 --> 13:34.580]  that's why she probably needed a gun herself to do it the police are there
[13:34.580 --> 13:37.460]  arrest somebody once they've committed the crime bringing the justice to the
[13:37.460 --> 13:41.380]  jury to us the people Italy puts tricks on the street in response to Islamic
[13:41.380 --> 13:45.500]  state say psychological warfare up ISIS believe Jesus will come Ted Cruz

[14:33.620 --> 14:38.180]  a major confrontation with the globalist as everybody is everybody fighting them
[14:38.180 --> 14:40.700]  is being confronted more and more because the enemy knows we're gaining

[15:02.140 --> 15:06.860]  are the resistance all right that's Alex Jones the message recorded earlier
[15:06.860 --> 15:11.500]  breaking down some of the stories that are coming out today we have as he
[15:11.500 --> 15:14.660]  mentioned at the beginning of the broadcast we have Dr. Hugo de Geras a
[15:14.660 --> 15:18.940]  pioneer of artificial intelligence and of course 10 years ago he wrote a book
[15:18.940 --> 15:24.540]  called the art alike war he has a very dystopian view of what may happen with
[15:24.540 --> 15:28.540]  artificial intelligence as someone who knows a great deal about it we're going
[15:28.540 --> 15:32.860]  to talk to him today from China he has been working up to his retirement in
[15:32.860 --> 15:37.460]  China on an artificial brain project in China pretty much all of the countries
[15:37.460 --> 15:41.020]  are doing it that's one of the reasons that he believes that makes a case for it
[15:41.020 --> 15:45.860]  in his book is it's essentially a competition just as we had the space
[15:45.860 --> 15:49.740]  gap with us but Nick we got concerned about that every country is concerned
[15:49.740 --> 15:54.700]  about falling behind militarily and doing the research that's what's driving
[15:54.700 --> 15:59.620]  this kind of I would call it a DARPA kind of madness that we see just yesterday
[15:59.620 --> 16:05.060]  of course we had the story right out of the matrix talking about how DARPA is
[16:05.060 --> 16:09.280]  working on a brain implant to be powered from the spine that would go on the back
[16:09.280 --> 16:15.140]  of your neck they would project video directly into your brain bypassing the
[16:15.140 --> 16:19.100]  visual system that your body has today we have a story that's up on drudge
[16:19.100 --> 16:22.780]  report about drones being used to seek out arteries in order to prevent heart
[16:22.780 --> 16:26.900]  attacks this is nanotechnology microscopic drones that they would inject
[16:26.900 --> 16:31.500]  into your arteries that would then seek out plaque inside of the arteries and
[16:31.500 --> 16:37.260]  release a drug derived from they say a natural protein that repairs inflammation
[16:37.260 --> 16:41.620]  damage in the body so I look at this I think maybe the Amish have the right
[16:41.620 --> 16:47.940]  idea I am definitely as Dr. Degueris would call it I'm definitely in the
[16:47.940 --> 16:52.860]  Terran camp not as a terrorist that doesn't mean terrorist that means Tara as in
[16:52.860 --> 16:59.020]  terra firma earth humanity that's the side I'm with of course he sympathizes
[16:59.020 --> 17:03.860]  with that but he describes himself as a cosmos someone who feels compelled to
[17:03.860 --> 17:07.700]  create this what he believes godlike intelligence that he thinks is not only
[17:07.700 --> 17:13.820]  coming soon but is and not just a high probability but a certainty he believes
[17:13.820 --> 17:17.660]  that's going to happen and I think one of the things we want to talk to him
[17:17.660 --> 17:23.100]  about besides the timing besides how this might break out he has a very laid
[17:23.100 --> 17:28.180]  this out ten years ago how he thought this conflict would play out so we want
[17:28.180 --> 17:31.820]  to talk to him about the state of the art and research we want to see how he
[17:31.820 --> 17:34.820]  thinks this is going to play out but one of the things that I want to focus on
[17:34.820 --> 17:39.620]  because it has implications for everyone who is a scientist or an engineer is the
[17:39.620 --> 17:43.420]  ethics of this because he's very conflicted about this he feels compelled
[17:43.420 --> 17:48.820]  to create this godlike intelligence even though he personally believes that it
[17:48.820 --> 17:53.180]  will likely lead to the extinction of the human race there was a story on the
[17:53.180 --> 17:57.100]  Guardian today artificial intelligence and nanotechnology which he believes is
[17:57.100 --> 18:01.500]  an enabling technology for the kind of development of artificial intelligence
[18:01.500 --> 18:05.580]  that he foresees artificial intelligence and nanotech threatened civilization
[18:05.580 --> 18:10.140]  this is the Guardian they say in a recent global challenges foundation
[18:10.140 --> 18:14.420]  proposal they said such extreme intelligences cannot easily be controlled
[18:14.420 --> 18:18.260]  either by the groups creating them or by some international regulatory regime
[18:18.260 --> 18:22.940]  and would probably act to boost their own intelligence and acquire maximal
[18:22.940 --> 18:27.420]  resources for almost all initial AI motivations they say if these motivations
[18:27.420 --> 18:33.740]  don't include the survival of humanity it makes extreme tell intelligence of
[18:33.740 --> 18:38.620]  these AIs a unique risk in that extinction is more likely than with
[18:38.620 --> 18:42.660]  lesser impacts and they go through and they listed in this article a whole
[18:42.660 --> 18:48.780]  bunch of different existential threats threats that to human existence things
[18:48.780 --> 18:53.380]  like extreme climate change nuclear war global pandemic ecological catastrophe
[18:53.380 --> 18:58.300]  global system collapse major asteroid impact super volcano synthetic
[18:58.300 --> 19:02.020]  biology nanotechnology artificial intelligence unknown consequences and
[19:02.020 --> 19:06.620]  here's the one we talk about all the time future bad global governance see
[19:06.620 --> 19:11.580]  that's the way I see the art like war playing out I don't see it as a fight
[19:11.580 --> 19:15.300]  between people who are motivated to create the next godlike intelligence and
[19:15.300 --> 19:18.100]  people who are concerned that's going to get out a hand to try to stop them like
[19:18.100 --> 19:23.300]  the like Terminator 2 as you saw Sarah Connors do trying to shut down the
[19:23.300 --> 19:28.740]  scientists that she saw as being key to developing the future robots we actually
[19:28.740 --> 19:33.940]  saw Ted Kaczynski the unabomber actually start doing that I don't see it
[19:33.940 --> 19:40.100]  happening that way I see the motivation coming from bad global governance the
[19:40.100 --> 19:45.740]  same kind of elite megalomaniacs a kind of movie super villains that have
[19:45.740 --> 19:50.500]  absolutely no regard for the human race and have talked about cutting it down to
[19:50.500 --> 19:53.620]  virtually nothing virtually no one but then so stay with us we're going to be
[19:53.620 --> 19:56.940]  right back it's an interesting show
[19:58.980 --> 20:03.780]  as the new world order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our

[24:22.980 --> 24:28.300]  19th 2015 this segment I want to co-oper some of the news especially what's
[24:28.300 --> 24:33.140]  going on with the Internet because that is really key that is the substrate of
[24:33.140 --> 24:37.100]  free speech in America and we see several articles about this on the
[24:37.100 --> 24:40.460]  dredge report today one of them from the weekly standard why can't the public see
[24:40.460 --> 24:45.820]  Obama's proposed internet regulations we have the FCC saying that they need to
[24:45.820 --> 24:50.820]  exert control over the internet in order to give us net neutrality they have
[24:50.820 --> 24:54.620]  been on both sides of this issue it isn't about net neutrality it's about
[24:54.620 --> 24:58.620]  exercising control of the internet and shutting it down and the fact that they
[24:58.620 --> 25:01.980]  won't show us what these regulations are should make you very suspicious we've
[25:01.980 --> 25:06.900]  got senators like Mike Lee, Ben Sasse, Rand Paul all in opposition to this
[25:06.900 --> 25:10.940]  leahus call the regulation a government takeover the internet he says it amounts
[25:10.940 --> 25:14.860]  to a massive tax increase on the middle class being passed in the dead of night
[25:14.860 --> 25:18.420]  without the American public really being made aware of what's going on well
[25:18.420 --> 25:22.100]  that's what they do with everything that's what they did with Obamacare they
[25:22.100 --> 25:24.500]  said we had to pass it so we could find out what's in it that's what they're
[25:24.500 --> 25:28.140]  doing with the Trans Pacific and transatlantic partnership the massive
[25:28.140 --> 25:32.820]  trade agreements that go far beyond trade they change the very essence of
[25:32.820 --> 25:38.100]  government and the relationship to multinational corporations elevates
[25:38.100 --> 25:41.260]  them to the level of government because of course they're negotiating these
[25:41.260 --> 25:45.860]  treaties the multinational corporations in secret our government's not even
[25:45.860 --> 25:48.620]  allowed to see it and of course you've got senators who can't see what our own
[25:48.620 --> 25:53.700]  internal bureaucracy is doing one of the FCC commissioners this guy is a real
[25:53.700 --> 25:57.980]  hero a gadget pie I hope I'm pronouncing his name correctly but he is a hero he's
[25:57.980 --> 26:01.620]  exposed a lot of things the FCC has been doing in the past they say he's been
[26:01.620 --> 26:06.100]  talking about the fact that this is 333 pages of proposed regulation of
[26:06.100 --> 26:10.260]  course that we cannot see now there's an excellent video on this article in the
[26:10.260 --> 26:14.540]  weekly standard a real movie trailer and of course we've seen this movie of
[26:14.540 --> 26:18.300]  tyranny play out many times before but this is something that really lays it
[26:18.300 --> 26:24.620]  out I think it's a also good for radio but let's let's go to that tape in a
[26:24.620 --> 26:34.140]  world where the web is open and free and innovation spans the globe
[26:34.140 --> 26:42.220]  the one next has a secret plan to seize control of the internet he has a phone
[26:42.220 --> 26:50.900]  he has a pen and he claims he has the power to do it it's not the first secret
[26:50.900 --> 26:57.380]  government plan to take over a sector of the US economy we have to pass the bill
[26:57.380 --> 27:03.380]  so that you can find out what is in it but against all odds one man is fighting
[27:03.380 --> 27:08.300]  back I want a free and open internet most people do one man believes
[27:08.300 --> 27:12.980]  Americans deserve to know more the public has a right to know what its
[27:12.980 --> 27:17.380]  government is doing one man shines light into the darkest corners of
[27:17.380 --> 27:20.780]  government if you told the average American that the FCC is going to
[27:20.780 --> 27:25.020]  propose regulations for the internet economy that are 332 pages long and
[27:25.020 --> 27:28.500]  you're not going to be able to see it until the FCC adopts it they would think
[27:28.500 --> 27:31.700]  that's the wrong way to go wait a minute you can't tell me what's in the
[27:31.700 --> 27:35.380]  document that is correct from the government that brought you spying on
[27:35.380 --> 27:41.940]  journalists abuse of power from the IRS and health care.gov comes the
[27:41.940 --> 27:47.020]  department of the internet net neutrality is Obamacare for the
[27:47.020 --> 27:52.860]  internet the internet should not operate at the speed of government
[27:52.860 --> 28:07.940]  coming soon on February 26 prepare for the department of the internet
[28:07.940 --> 28:12.500]  but it's going to take more than one man to stop the government's takeover of
[28:12.500 --> 28:18.220]  the internet contact Congress today and find out how the FCC plans to change
[28:18.220 --> 28:23.420]  the internet Congress should demand that this rule be made public before the FCC
[28:23.420 --> 28:28.220]  votes on it let the American public see this plan
[28:28.220 --> 28:34.220]  excellent video keep the internet open and free and of course that's a great
[28:34.220 --> 28:39.780]  line in there the internet operating at the speed of government and quite
[28:39.780 --> 28:43.580]  frankly it's not going to be operating if they have their say so about it
[28:43.580 --> 28:47.780]  they're looking at many different ways to restrict internet freedom to restrict
[28:47.780 --> 28:53.020]  the free free speech and of course we have not only the FCC saying we have to
[28:53.020 --> 28:56.660]  protect you from gatekeepers so we're going to make ourselves the gatekeepers
[28:56.660 --> 29:00.100]  you know kind of like the way they protect us from violence in cities by
[29:00.100 --> 29:05.260]  becoming violent policemen we've got a billionaire Mark Cuban and another
[29:05.260 --> 29:10.260]  article was up on Drudge saying that net neutrality will f everything up is what
[29:10.260 --> 29:16.220]  he says doesn't meant words here he says it's a dispute essentially between two
[29:16.220 --> 29:20.060]  large companies Netflix and Comcast that essentially started this he said they
[29:20.060 --> 29:23.700]  were able to work this out as big companies typically do we should not
[29:23.700 --> 29:27.660]  have the government getting involved as gatekeepers and he points out that he
[29:27.660 --> 29:32.020]  has no objection to Congress passing a law specifying that ISPs can't
[29:32.020 --> 29:37.340]  discriminate or block websites that though is the purpose of the FCC getting
[29:37.340 --> 29:41.060]  into this is to shut down free speech to shut down websites stay with us we'll
[29:41.060 --> 29:46.620]  be right back with more news and joining us in the next hour is dr. Hugo to garris

[32:12.940 --> 32:18.020]  less than 13 months away former CIA director James Woolsey says two-thirds
[32:18.020 --> 32:22.140]  of US population could perish in a matter of seconds the world as we know it
[32:22.140 --> 32:26.700]  will cease to exist the world's economy will be wiped out mass riots will
[32:26.700 --> 32:31.140]  follow ancient diseases will reemerge how will you shield yourself and your

[33:09.180 --> 33:18.100]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[33:18.100 --> 33:25.220]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show this February 19th 2015 I'm David Knight your
[33:25.220 --> 33:29.300]  host will be joined later in the show in the next hour by Dr. Hugo DeGaris one
[33:29.300 --> 33:33.220]  of the pioneers of artificial intelligence he's going to give us his
[33:33.220 --> 33:36.900]  very dystopian view of the future but I think it's also important to talk to him
[33:36.900 --> 33:42.220]  because he represents I think the kind of paradox of ethics that we see with
[33:42.220 --> 33:46.820]  many people who work at all levels with the military industrial complex would
[33:46.820 --> 33:51.740]  you because of intellectual curiosity because of financial reward whatever the
[33:51.740 --> 33:56.780]  reason would you do things that you think are going to result in the deaths
[33:56.780 --> 34:01.420]  of hundreds thousands millions in his case he thinks that the art-like war
[34:01.420 --> 34:06.340]  will result in the death of billions he talks about giga death nevertheless he
[34:06.340 --> 34:12.060]  feels compelled to create it so I'm very intrigued by this paradox and I want to
[34:12.060 --> 34:15.900]  talk to him about that as well as his take on the state-of-the-art of
[34:15.900 --> 34:19.820]  artificial intelligence how he thinks this may happen we were talking just
[34:19.820 --> 34:23.900]  before the break about the FCC and I want to get back to that but very quickly
[34:23.900 --> 34:27.060]  I want to let you know that this hour the Alex Jones show is brought to you by
[34:27.060 --> 34:30.860]  the special products that we sell at info wars life comm and we have some
[34:30.860 --> 34:34.820]  specials on those products this month we have a February special for SuperMail
[34:34.820 --> 34:40.020]  and Superfemale vitality 20% off you'll also find 15% off pro pure water filters
[34:40.020 --> 34:44.220]  and we have a special that introduces ancient defense one of our new
[34:44.220 --> 34:49.060]  supplements there if you buy two survival shield x2 nascent iodine you get one
[34:49.060 --> 34:53.620]  ancient defense for free that's info wars life comm that supports our
[34:53.620 --> 34:57.580]  operation it's a primary aspect of support of our operation of course
[34:57.580 --> 35:01.780]  support your local affiliates who carry this radio station as well as the
[35:01.780 --> 35:07.100]  sponsors that make that possible now going back to the news here the FCC
[35:07.100 --> 35:12.420]  Mark Cuban was very upset by the idea that the FCC is enlarging its turf and
[35:12.420 --> 35:16.620]  of course they've been after this for quite some time they are using the threat
[35:16.620 --> 35:21.420]  of large corporations shutting down and controlling your internet access
[35:21.420 --> 35:26.820]  they're using that threat in order to create a regulatory mechanism that can
[35:26.820 --> 35:31.420]  do exactly that they're saying we don't want to have gatekeepers of the internet
[35:31.420 --> 35:34.340]  corporate gatekeepers of the internet so we're going to set up government
[35:34.340 --> 35:40.100]  gatekeepers of the internet just look at how that has worked out for us with the
[35:40.100 --> 35:45.340]  FDA with other regulatory agencies they get captured by the very companies
[35:45.340 --> 35:50.780]  Monsanto etc that they're supposed to regulate they don't protect us we don't
[35:50.780 --> 35:56.500]  want to have this kind of expansive regulation it wasn't that long ago the
[35:56.500 --> 36:03.180]  same FCC committee member that is blowing the whistle on these new secret
[36:03.180 --> 36:06.660]  rules that were not allowed to look at he also pointed out that they were
[36:06.660 --> 36:12.780]  looking at content they were going to send flyers out to print media which
[36:12.780 --> 36:17.020]  has nothing to do with their jurisdiction but we see just like we see the
[36:17.020 --> 36:22.660]  FAA trying to extend its jurisdiction over model planes over paper airline
[36:22.660 --> 36:28.380]  airplanes paper airlines we had a national transportation safety board
[36:28.380 --> 36:32.620]  judge slapped them down and say you don't have any authority over these
[36:32.620 --> 36:39.420]  lightweight models these quadricopters that are carrying cameras they tried to
[36:39.420 --> 36:44.100]  assess a $10,000 fine against a guy who was working for the University of
[36:44.100 --> 36:47.700]  Virginia he flew a five-pound Styrofoam drone over the University of Virginia
[36:47.700 --> 36:51.980]  taking pictures they tried to assess a $10,000 fine and the judge slapped it
[36:51.980 --> 36:56.140]  down and said if we go with the argument that you the FAA are trying to make we're
[36:56.140 --> 37:00.820]  going to regulate even down to paper airplanes and balsa wood airplanes but
[37:00.820 --> 37:07.260]  that was repealed that was they appealed that decision and the NTSB board
[37:07.260 --> 37:12.980]  overruled that judge and so now that's exactly what the FAA is doing this is
[37:12.980 --> 37:17.340]  the way all of these bureaucracies are rolling out and expanding their power
[37:17.340 --> 37:23.020]  it's not just Obama with his executive orders it's these bureaucracies that are
[37:23.020 --> 37:27.460]  writing the laws calling them regulations but Congress no longer writes
[37:27.460 --> 37:31.860]  the laws Congress isn't even allowed to see what the FCC is planning on doing to
[37:31.860 --> 37:36.780]  the Internet it's secret there's over 300 pages one of the commissioners who's
[37:36.780 --> 37:39.580]  blown the whistle on that has seen it but of course the senators haven't
[37:39.580 --> 37:43.060]  Senator Rand Paul Mike Lee others have complained about this they're not allowed
[37:43.060 --> 37:45.100]  to see it they're not allowed to see the trade agreements they're being
[37:45.100 --> 37:49.380]  negotiated by corporations and transatlantic trans-pacific trade
[37:49.380 --> 37:52.140]  agreements this is the kind of secretive government of course Mark
[37:52.140 --> 37:56.380]  Cuban says look I wouldn't have a problem if you wanted to use the FCC or
[37:56.380 --> 38:01.100]  Congress not he doesn't even say the FCC he rightfully says Congress Congress
[38:01.100 --> 38:04.980]  should pass the laws not the bureaucracies he says I don't have an objection to
[38:04.980 --> 38:08.420]  Congress passing a law saying the Internet providers can't discriminate it
[38:08.420 --> 38:13.660]  or block legal websites see that's the way it's going to be used that's the
[38:13.660 --> 38:17.860]  whole purpose however of the FCC's movement behind this just take a look at
[38:17.860 --> 38:21.700]  this story is up on infowars.com today federal government demands social media
[38:21.700 --> 38:27.340]  censorship this is a Republican congressman from Texas Ted Pope chair of
[38:27.340 --> 38:31.780]  the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism sees always done in the name
[38:31.780 --> 38:37.300]  of security and he's saying you know we need to we need to force Twitter to take
[38:37.300 --> 38:44.820]  stuff down look it's not something that is not being they have paid trolls they've
[38:44.820 --> 38:49.020]  been doing it in Afghanistan they do it here in conas in the continental United
[38:49.020 --> 38:52.700]  States you can see their work these paid Pentagon trolls and government
[38:52.700 --> 38:55.900]  Homeland Security trolls if you want to see their work just go to our website go
[38:55.900 --> 38:59.620]  to info wars.com you'll see them hanging out in the comments section we'll see
[38:59.620 --> 39:02.900]  them on YouTube hanging out the comments section the same guys all the time
[39:02.900 --> 39:09.500]  that's what they do they actually war game that they actually measure your
[39:09.500 --> 39:15.220]  response to see if they can push you in a certain direction that's what they've
[39:15.220 --> 39:19.420]  been doing for a long time so you know they they aren't necessarily censoring
[39:19.420 --> 39:25.900]  con content from ISIS they want to censor political content that's what
[39:25.900 --> 39:30.820]  the FCC FEC the Federal Elections Commission wants to do as well we also
[39:30.820 --> 39:35.460]  have a story up on info wars.com Google warns of US government quote hacking
[39:35.460 --> 39:41.100]  any facility in the world this is an obscure rule that essentially says that
[39:41.100 --> 39:45.740]  the FBI needs to get search warrants from a judge that has jurisdiction by
[39:45.740 --> 39:50.660]  removing that requirement then they can have a judge quote-unquote give them
[39:50.660 --> 39:55.700]  authority to go anywhere even outside of this country and of course I guess
[39:55.700 --> 40:00.420]  that's kind of a novel idea that any branch of government would even bother
[40:00.420 --> 40:03.300]  and get a search warrant anymore with the kind of dragnet surveillance we have
[40:03.300 --> 40:06.260]  here but this is what Google is saying they say this opens the door to the US
[40:06.260 --> 40:10.140]  government hacking any facility in the world they say FBI agents would be able
[40:10.140 --> 40:14.420]  to carry out covert raids on servers no matter where they were situated giving
[40:14.420 --> 40:18.220]  the US government unfettered global access to vast amounts of private
[40:18.220 --> 40:23.020]  information now understand they're not just talking really that primarily
[40:23.020 --> 40:26.260]  they're talking here about a virtual hacking in other words when they talk
[40:26.260 --> 40:29.960]  about a covert raid they're really talking primarily about a computer hack
[40:29.960 --> 40:34.340]  job on any server anywhere in the world but understand that that isn't where it's
[40:34.340 --> 40:40.140]  going to stop you're going to wind up having American SWAT teams special
[40:40.140 --> 40:44.020]  forces descending on people that's where this is going to stop they say the
[40:44.020 --> 40:47.220]  nature of these government searches they say it could take place anywhere in the
[40:47.220 --> 40:52.420]  world the concern is not theoretical this is what Google is saying the nature
[40:52.420 --> 40:55.380]  of today's technology is such that warrants issued under proposed
[40:55.380 --> 40:59.220]  amendment will in many cases end up authorizing the government to conduct
[40:59.220 --> 41:03.780]  searches outside the United States perhaps this is the way Google is trying to
[41:03.780 --> 41:09.700]  repair their reputation after having been started by the CIA and being
[41:09.700 --> 41:14.300]  involved with a lot of this government spying now they're warning us what they
[41:14.300 --> 41:16.980]  I guess they've been told the government is already getting ready to do and of
[41:16.980 --> 41:23.460]  course we just learned earlier this week that there was hacks NSA hacks into the
[41:23.460 --> 41:28.460]  lower level software I'm sorry heart of software on the hard drives into the
[41:28.460 --> 41:35.220]  firmware so that they could essentially boot up a spy program as the hard drives
[41:35.220 --> 41:39.460]  are turned on and we've seen in the past that the special tactical group that the
[41:39.460 --> 41:44.340]  NSA has has been intercepting packages as they've been shipped out changing the
[41:44.340 --> 41:48.220]  hardware putting stuff into computers and the hard drives this is some spy
[41:48.220 --> 41:53.420]  wear that's been discovered by a Russian group Kaspersky and they pointed out
[41:53.420 --> 41:58.220]  that it shares exactly the same methods of working as StetsNet and everybody
[41:58.220 --> 42:01.340]  understands that StetsNet was something that was done by the United States and
[42:01.340 --> 42:06.500]  Israeli military against the Iranians attacking interestingly enough their
[42:06.500 --> 42:10.460]  hard drives and no matter how many times they tried to wipe those hard drives it
[42:10.460 --> 42:16.420]  just kept coming back because it was down at the boot level firmware we talk
[42:16.420 --> 42:22.780]  many times about DARPA as we mentioned yesterday and earlier today the story
[42:22.780 --> 42:27.860]  from yesterday that DARPA is working on a matrix like hack to go into the spine
[42:27.860 --> 42:32.980]  in the back of the neck and straight out of the matrix of course perhaps they
[42:32.980 --> 42:36.660]  gave them some information we see a lot of predictive programming going on in
[42:36.660 --> 42:40.180]  the movies and of course that's what we're going to be talking about in the
[42:40.180 --> 42:45.060]  next hour we have one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence who foresees a
[42:45.060 --> 42:50.860]  terminator like future for us a system where the artificial intelligence
[42:50.860 --> 42:54.820]  becomes self-aware not only self-aware but malevolent so we're going to talk to
[42:54.820 --> 42:59.540]  him about his dystopian view which stands in stark contrast to Ray Kurzweil's
[42:59.540 --> 43:04.420]  utopian view and of course Ray Kurzweil is someone who thinks that this is
[43:04.420 --> 43:09.620]  going to play out as cyborgs he thinks he's going to merge with the machines he
[43:09.620 --> 43:14.980]  calls it the singularity and Dr. DeGaris calls it the single hilarity he thinks
[43:14.980 --> 43:17.900]  that that's not going to happen whatsoever so we'll talk to him as to why
[43:17.900 --> 43:22.700]  he thinks it isn't going to be a merging of man and machine but we'll also talk to
[43:22.700 --> 43:27.940]  him about how quickly he thinks this is going to happen it's not just DARPA that's
[43:27.940 --> 43:32.940]  creating these types of over-the-top science fiction developments that we see
[43:32.940 --> 43:39.380]  it's also an intelligence advanced research project called IARPA and as we
[43:39.380 --> 43:46.140]  mentioned on the news briefly yesterday they're looking at ways to predict what's
[43:46.140 --> 43:50.900]  going to happen in society one paper that they came out with said that
[43:50.900 --> 43:54.900]  anticipatory intelligence is considered to be one of the next frontiers of big
[43:54.900 --> 43:59.020]  data research and they see that their customers the people that they're going
[43:59.020 --> 44:03.700]  to support in making these decisions are national security law enforcement and
[44:03.700 --> 44:07.820]  intelligence missions and what are they looking for well they're going to try to
[44:07.820 --> 44:13.900]  forecast things like disease outbreaks elections say our national security and
[44:13.900 --> 44:17.620]  law enforcement needs to know who's going to win the next election they also
[44:17.620 --> 44:23.020]  want to know about domestic political crises and civil unrest so that's the
[44:23.020 --> 44:26.820]  types of things that they're looking at and of course this agency really which
[44:26.820 --> 44:30.900]  hasn't gotten a lot of attention like DARPA as because we know we've seen all
[44:30.900 --> 44:37.060]  of these robotics projects that DARPA has come out with the the dogs we we just
[44:37.060 --> 44:40.580]  had a smaller version of big dog every time you see that thing you've got
[44:40.580 --> 44:44.900]  somebody walking up to it and kicking it so that you can see how it can regain
[44:44.900 --> 44:49.060]  its balance every time I look at that thing I want to kick it as well but
[44:49.060 --> 44:52.620]  of course the large robotics projects that DARPA sponsored you should
[44:52.620 --> 44:58.340]  understand too that the very first competition that DARPA ever did was for
[44:58.340 --> 45:02.620]  self-driving cars as I'd like to call them I call them computer driven
[45:02.620 --> 45:07.740]  government controlled cars because controlling transportation controlling
[45:07.740 --> 45:13.460]  your movements is as important in total totalitarian societies as it is to
[45:13.460 --> 45:17.740]  control everything that you read everything that you see so they want to
[45:17.740 --> 45:21.340]  control the internet they also want to control the actual highway not just the
[45:21.340 --> 45:28.220]  information highway now IARPA this not very well known agency back in October
[45:28.220 --> 45:34.660]  of last year they had a special fair that they invited people to come see a
[45:34.660 --> 45:39.500]  few select journalists they say it was an industry day and the people reporting
[45:39.500 --> 45:44.660]  on this of course they were invited they invited the federal the FCW which is
[45:44.660 --> 45:49.180]  some kind of a federal I'm trying to look at the paper here I don't see what
[45:49.180 --> 45:53.700]  agency it is but it's basically an internet site that reports on what the
[45:53.700 --> 45:58.500]  federal government is doing for federal workers they say that they're the same
[45:58.500 --> 46:02.100]  program we're looking at predicting what's going to happen with crowds
[46:02.100 --> 46:07.460]  looking at publicly available data and predicting how things are going to break
[46:07.460 --> 46:11.260]  whether it's going to be civil unrest looking to see if people are getting
[46:11.260 --> 46:16.540]  sick we know that they're mining social media furiously and saving this and then
[46:16.540 --> 46:20.140]  also trying to use it to move the population in a particular direction
[46:20.140 --> 46:24.100]  they say they had an industry day they said it was very upbeat this is a
[46:24.100 --> 46:28.340]  federal workers site they say they had a welcome package including a handout with
[46:28.340 --> 46:31.620]  a quote from the New York Times saying that IARPA is one of the government's
[46:31.620 --> 46:35.060]  most creative agencies and then they had this to say which I thought was
[46:35.060 --> 46:40.860]  interesting coming from kind of a puff piece they say but the openness has its
[46:40.860 --> 46:46.060]  limits media were welcome as long as they didn't quote officials by name I
[46:46.060 --> 46:50.700]  can't have that and IARPA analysts grew visibly uncomfortable at seeing a
[46:50.700 --> 46:55.020]  reporter at his demonstration and he quickly summoned a public affairs
[46:55.020 --> 47:00.220]  officer to serve as intermediary yeah I don't think they're going to be inviting
[47:00.220 --> 47:05.860]  me or anybody else here at Info Wars to come to their industry days we might be
[47:05.860 --> 47:09.580]  actually quoting some of these guys and telling people what they're actually
[47:09.580 --> 47:14.380]  planning on doing even though most of their plans are secret now one of the
[47:14.380 --> 47:18.900]  articles that I saw in Drudge report today about Marco Rubio and of course
[47:18.900 --> 47:23.620]  he's saying that Homeland Security funding must continue despite this fight
[47:23.620 --> 47:27.420]  over immigration one of the few things the Republicans did not fully fund
[47:27.420 --> 47:31.820]  throughout the entire year was Homeland Security to give them a little bit of
[47:31.820 --> 47:36.660]  leverage perhaps over the immigration debate because that is being done Obama's
[47:36.660 --> 47:41.900]  amnesty is being enacted through the Department of Homeland Security Rubio
[47:41.900 --> 47:46.020]  doesn't think that that should should happen he thinks that it's just too
[47:46.020 --> 47:51.580]  important we have to do this for our own security for our national security but
[47:51.580 --> 47:56.700]  let's think about this as they point out in the article they say Obama's order is
[47:56.700 --> 48:01.180]  going to let immigrants get here illegally and work get work permits they
[48:01.180 --> 48:06.260]  can collect Social Security they can get Medicare and they can get tax credits
[48:06.260 --> 48:11.300]  from previous years by just filing some paperwork with the IRS when they can do
[48:11.300 --> 48:17.740]  all of that it makes me ask the question why does Marco Rubio really define
[48:17.740 --> 48:22.900]  security how do you define security if you have no control over your borders if
[48:22.900 --> 48:30.260]  you have a massive clowered and pivoted takedown of the economy with handing out
[48:30.260 --> 48:34.940]  massive financial incentives for people to come here and giving them Social
[48:34.940 --> 48:38.860]  Security giving them tax refunds from previous years when they may or may not
[48:38.860 --> 48:43.220]  have been here when you destroy the economy of a country like that when you
[48:43.220 --> 48:49.140]  destroy control over the borders how then do you define security the security
[48:49.140 --> 48:53.780]  something that is there only to protect the government's continuity of
[48:53.780 --> 48:58.020]  government I think maybe in his world it does because there was another article
[48:58.020 --> 49:04.180]  that came out just a couple of days ago at the International Students for
[49:04.180 --> 49:07.980]  Liberty meeting in DC that was just last week I think it might have been this
[49:07.980 --> 49:15.340]  last weekend Justin Amash talked about Marco Rubio now Marco Rubio is for
[49:15.340 --> 49:19.420]  permanently reauthorizing the Patriot Act that's what he was
[49:19.420 --> 49:23.260]  concerned about here's the quote from Marco Rubio as an op-ed piece that he
[49:23.260 --> 49:29.300]  had and it was on foxnews.com Marco Rubio said this year a new Republican
[49:29.300 --> 49:32.260]  majority in both houses of Congress will have to extend current authorities
[49:32.260 --> 49:37.300]  under the FISA Act the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act I urge my
[49:37.300 --> 49:42.060]  colleagues to consider a permanent extension of the counterterrorism tools
[49:42.060 --> 49:47.540]  our intelligence community relies on to keep the American people safe so we
[49:47.540 --> 49:50.780]  don't have to worry about a cloward and pivot takedown of our economy with open
[49:50.780 --> 49:56.780]  borders that's not a threat to our security we have to have homeland the
[49:56.780 --> 50:02.380]  Patriot Act made permanent now after he did that congressman Justin Amash
[50:02.380 --> 50:09.620]  retweeted that with the single comment single word comment disqualified I think
[50:09.620 --> 50:15.860]  Amash is exactly right that disqualifies him as a senator not simply as a
[50:15.860 --> 50:19.540]  presidential candidate or as a vice presidential running mate which is
[50:19.540 --> 50:23.140]  probably what he's angling for and of course the Patriot acts illegal section
[50:23.140 --> 50:28.180]  215 which is what they've used to justify their drag net surveillance that
[50:28.180 --> 50:34.260]  is coming up for reauthorization set to expire June 1st we should let it expire
[50:34.260 --> 50:40.060]  and we should let Marco Rubio expire in his Senate term not give him any more
[50:40.060 --> 50:47.580]  power it's a very very disturbing thing to see the Patriot Act made permanent
[50:47.580 --> 50:51.820]  we need to all be aware of what's going on we need to roll this back not just be
[50:51.820 --> 50:54.540]  aware of it stay with us we'll be right back with some more news before we go to

[54:18.100 --> 54:21.100]  of the pioneers of artificial intelligence he's going to talk to us
[54:21.100 --> 54:27.160]  about his dystopian projections for the future if this comes to fruition he
[54:27.160 --> 54:30.180]  believes that it is inevitable so we're going to talk to him about why he believes
[54:30.180 --> 54:34.620]  that as well as we'll take some of your calls and questions for him he's agreed
[54:34.620 --> 54:37.700]  to stay a little bit longer with us so that we can take some calls he'll be
[54:37.700 --> 54:41.100]  joining us in the next hour we'll be taking your calls at the top of the
[54:41.100 --> 54:46.900]  third hour and the last segment we were talking about Marco Rubio who wants to
[54:46.900 --> 54:51.540]  make the Patriot Act authorization permanent he wants to make the drag net
[54:51.540 --> 54:54.940]  surveillance that we see happening he wants to make that permanent he wants
[54:54.940 --> 55:00.620]  to find Homeland Security which is being used to carry out Obama's executive
[55:00.620 --> 55:05.060]  orders that's the little bit of leverage even that little bit that that little
[55:05.060 --> 55:11.340]  bone that was thrown to the Republican voting base by Boehner and others that
[55:11.340 --> 55:15.180]  we're going to try to pull back some of this open border stuff with Homeland
[55:15.180 --> 55:21.060]  Security because border control is under Homeland Security even that Marco
[55:21.060 --> 55:25.180]  Rubio says no no no we don't want to tie any conditions to Homeland Security
[55:25.180 --> 55:28.940]  let's just let them do whatever they want to let's go business as usual fund
[55:28.940 --> 55:35.780]  everything here's how Ted Cruz talked about immigration on the Fox News show
[55:35.780 --> 55:43.380]  with Megyn Kelly with respect to the ruling we I disagree with it I think the
[55:43.380 --> 55:49.220]  laws on our side and history is on our side and we are going to appeal it we
[55:49.220 --> 55:54.660]  will be prepared to implement this full fully as soon as the legal issues get
[55:54.660 --> 56:01.140]  resolved he seems undeterred well that that has been the nature of the Obama
[56:01.140 --> 56:05.500]  presidency from from day one you know it's interesting he says the law is on
[56:05.500 --> 56:09.340]  his side there is at least one person who calls himself a legal scholar who
[56:09.340 --> 56:16.020]  disagrees and his name is Barack Obama 22 times President Obama has admitted he
[56:16.020 --> 56:20.980]  doesn't have the authority to issue unilateral amnesty 22 times he says the
[56:20.980 --> 56:25.420]  Constitution doesn't allow it he said this is not a monarchy that's his quote
[56:25.420 --> 56:30.340]  that's a fact and then after the last election he said nevermind and issued it
[56:30.340 --> 56:34.180]  anyway yeah and he just keeps getting away with it because the Republicans
[56:34.180 --> 56:38.620]  refused to impeach him even though we have a majority in the Senate and we
[56:38.620 --> 56:42.220]  have a very large majority in the House they won't even attempt it now they'll
[56:42.220 --> 56:45.580]  tell you that they don't have a large enough majority to get it through the
[56:45.580 --> 56:51.060]  Senate that hasn't stopped them from passing the Keystone Pipeline 10 times
[56:51.060 --> 56:53.940]  they know they're not going to get that through but they want to show that
[56:53.940 --> 56:58.340]  they're working for their real constituents the big corporations
[56:58.340 --> 57:02.380]  behind the Keystone Pipeline they could care less about the Republican voters
[57:02.380 --> 57:06.940]  now we do have some good news out of South Dakota we see that they have passed
[57:06.940 --> 57:11.100]  constitutional carry this is a message it went out from gun owners of America
[57:11.100 --> 57:15.180]  yesterday saying that the South Dakota State House has passed constitutional
[57:15.180 --> 57:19.300]  carry that will allow people in South Dakota to exercise their Second
[57:19.300 --> 57:23.300]  Amendment rights to carry a firearm now we'll have to see if it gets through the
[57:23.300 --> 57:27.620]  other house and if the governor signs it but you know it basically recognizes
[57:27.620 --> 57:31.900]  that the Second Amendment addresses a right of the people not a privilege
[57:31.900 --> 57:38.580]  granted by the government that's also very positive news and we also see that
[57:38.580 --> 57:43.020]  frozen temperatures everywhere even Niagara Falls is frozen there's an
[57:43.020 --> 57:48.340]  article on CNN talking about how it's such a site that it's a become a
[57:48.340 --> 57:51.380]  tourist attraction to see the frozen Niagara Falls and of course the Great
[57:51.380 --> 57:57.060]  Lakes have frozen over we've got Lake Erie with 98% ice and there's an
[57:57.060 --> 58:03.660]  article from M Live that talks about how the Great Lakes ice is growing faster
[58:03.660 --> 58:08.260]  than even last year's frigid winter they say not only is Lake Erie above where
[58:08.260 --> 58:12.580]  it was last year but Lake Huron is also closing in on this record last year Lake
[58:12.580 --> 58:19.300]  Ontario 78.5% ice last year it was just 31.5% ice you know there's decreased
[58:19.300 --> 58:25.300]  solar activity we also have more CO2 I would say that perhaps that points to
[58:25.300 --> 58:30.260]  some failed climate change models maybe it's not man-made and maybe the globe
[58:30.260 --> 58:33.820]  is not warming stay with us we're gonna be right back get a little bit more
[58:33.820 --> 58:36.900]  news and then Hugo DaGarris is gonna be joining us from China

[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:27.300]  alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show I'm David Knight your host we're
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:32.060]  going to be joined by in the next segment by Dr. Hugo DeGaris artificial
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.020]  intelligence pioneer we're going to talk to him about his book the art like war
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:39.180]  cosmos versus Terence a bitter controversy concerning whether humanity
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:43.220]  should build godlike massive intelligent machines one of the interesting
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.500]  things about this book not only does he lay out some of the principles of
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.940]  artificial intelligence and how he thinks it's going to get there talks a
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:53.380]  little bit about the time frame but the thing that I found interesting about it
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:01:00.300]  was his conflicted interest in this because he sees this resulting in the
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:04.980]  extinction of the human species nevertheless he feels compelled to
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:09.700]  create what he believes are going to be godlike artificial intelligences that
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:14.180]  he calls the art alex so we're going to talk to him in the next segment we have
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:19.020]  some news that we haven't gone over just yet I wanted to talk about this world
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:23.820]  net daily story that came up from Jerome Corsi and of course it involves the
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:30.100]  appointment of Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch and it's her role in the
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:36.420]  Obama administration's decision not to prosecute HSBC and other banks for
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:41.900]  massive money laundering money laundering for terrorist groups for drug
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:47.020]  groups remember when this came out there was a lot of talk about not only are
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:52.620]  these banks too big to fail but the Obama administration under the previous
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:57.180]  Attorney General Eric Holder said with his spokesperson said you know it just
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.540]  wouldn't serve anybody's best interest for us to send any of these bank
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:05.500]  officials to jail anybody else doing this would be sent to jail in a heartbeat
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:11.300]  some of the most massive money laundering in terms of the quantity that
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:14.820]  they've done and the blatancy with which they did it we've ever seen and not
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:18.380]  only did they just give them a slap on the wrist on a small fine but as they
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:22.820]  were working on that we've had on our show Everett Stern who is a whistleblower
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:29.580]  who worked at HSBC and he alleged that he was part of the group with the first
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.740]  time they got caught doing money laundering they came in and said all
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:36.260]  right we're gonna let you off if you will police this better so they hired a
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:41.940]  bunch of people and Everett was one of them to look at the transfers to
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:47.020]  scrutinize them they had software that was supposed to flag this stuff he
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:52.740]  asserts that it was simply a cover-up that they were trying deliberately to
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.580]  look the other way they were not training people to actually do anything
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:00.420]  with it even as they were getting their hands slapped for a prior violation he
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:05.620]  was pointing out that search terms looking for individuals or organizations
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:11.900]  that were drug dealers or terrorist groups that they would insert things like
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:16.380]  periods or spaces inside of the name so that there would not be a character
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:21.220]  match so that these things would go through the automated filters and did
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:24.340]  very little to train anybody to actually do any detective work he says that
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:27.740]  when he started doing it he got slapped down well this is a whistleblower from
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:34.900]  HSBC John Cruz who is now talking about what he saw and talking about again
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:40.340]  Obama's Attorney General nominee who was supposed to replace Eric Holder and
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:44.460]  unfortunately Eric Holder is going to be retiring he's not going to a gel cell
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:48.700]  as he should be going based on the many things that he's covered up fast and
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:53.060]  furious the IRS scandals where the IRS is being used against political enemies
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:57.980]  seems like nothing will take him down and nevertheless some people are
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:04.220]  starting to pay attention to the HSBC whistleblower pointing out the Attorney
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:09.740]  General nominee's role in the Obama administration covering up and just
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:15.940]  giving a hand slap to them we also see that Michelle Obama and Barack Obama
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:20.380]  are having a wonderful Valentine's Day this is really I guess we need to call

[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:20.940]  in this hour to Dr. Hugo Degares one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:25.180]  someone who's been a researcher in the subfield of artificial intelligence AI
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:31.100]  that is known as evolvable hardware and until his retirement in late 2010 he was
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:35.220]  professor at ZMN University he can correct me if I said that wrong where
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.260]  he taught theoretical physics and computer science and he ran the
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:42.100]  artificial brain lab funded by the Chinese government and of course most
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.860]  of the governments have some kind of an artificial brain lab that is going on
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:49.420]  before we go to Dr. Degares I want to read this to you from his book the
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:53.020]  Artelect War this was written in 2005 about 10 years ago of course he had
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:57.940]  identified the issue the problem some time before he quite a bit before he
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:01.500]  wrote the book he's been working in artificial intelligence for over 30
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:05.980]  years this is what he said in this 2005 book he said the issue is far important
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:09.740]  too important to be confined to intellectual discussions amongst a
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:14.540]  bunch of nerdy scientists in time it will concern everyone because if
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:18.700]  cosmos are serious and they're threat to build Artilex everyone will be affected
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:22.900]  one way or the other so he says an effective beginning to getting people
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:25.620]  to talk about the issue is to write a book and a book will help journalists
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.860]  become familiar with the problem they'll in turn write about it for the
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:31.860]  greater reading public which we've been doing here at Info Wars for quite some
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:35.820]  time we've been talking about it as well similar reasoning applies to TV and
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:39.660]  radio journalists who can present these ideas to an even wider audience because
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:44.620]  unfortunately only about half of the population reads books that's right we
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:49.340]  need to have this discussion we need to understand what is being done in this
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.700]  country it comes across when we see articles like yes we saw yesterday with
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:57.460]  DARPA talking about jacking into the spinal cord so that they can bypass the
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:02.580]  optical system and directly implant images into the brain we need to start
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:06.820]  thinking about these technologies that are so far over the top that are
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:11.220]  advancing so rapidly that are accelerating so rapidly we need to step
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:15.300]  back and examine the social consequences of this and so I want to do that with
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:21.300]  Dr. DaGarris as well as have him lay out the case for the plausibility and the
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.180]  inevitability of it and we're going to try to take your calls he's graciously
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:29.380]  agreed to stay a little bit longer into the top of the third hour if you've got
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:34.220]  some questions for Dr. DaGarris and thank you for joining us Dr. DaGarris.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:39.380]  Hello, thank you David and thank you for coming on at this time I know you're in
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:43.100]  China right now so this is very very early in the morning for you thank you
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:51.020]  for for getting up and doing this. I'm retired right I do what I like and I've
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:55.100]  always been a night person so for me this is sort of like the middle of the day
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:11:03.220]  it's the middle of my night so I'm wide awake. Good good I wanted to ask you to
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:08.260]  kind of lay out the case you think that it is not only highly probable but that
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:11.860]  it is inevitable that we're going to have these massively intelligent
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:15.820]  artificial intelligence machines the Ardlex I want you to kind of lay out
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:20.860]  for us the two different approaches to AI and kind of get an idea where we are
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:27.180]  in terms of current research on this you disagree with Ray Kurzweil on the
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:30.660]  eventual outcome he's someone who thinks that we're going to merge with machines
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:36.300]  in a kind of cyborg way he also sees a utopian future you're very concerned
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:40.900]  about this in terms of its conclusion but I think you both kind of are taking
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.620]  the same approach to artificial intelligence aren't you in terms of
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:52.060]  modeling the human brain. Well well my best friend is Ben Goersel and he
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:57.980]  and Ray Ray Kurzweil I consider then the two guys probably well one of those two
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:03.060]  will be the first I think to achieve genuine human level artificial
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:09.660]  intelligence and then Ben's way I call his approach just simply the engineering
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:14.380]  approach in other words do whatever you like just take some idea and engineer
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:17.780]  and see if you can get artificial intelligence out of it and that's
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:21.700]  pretty much the approach that artificial intelligence researchers have been
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:28.620]  taking for god 60 60 ideas and they've not been successful we still don't live
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:33.500]  in an era of artificial intelligence machines and the other broad
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:38.500]  approach is simply copy the brain now we know that approach eventually will
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:42.540]  pan out because you know we only have to look at ourselves as the living proof
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:46.820]  that it's possible to put molecules together in a certain way and produce
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:52.220]  an intelligent conscious creature you know ourselves human beings with a
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:57.260]  living proof that can be done nature has found a way but the bottleneck with that
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:01.780]  problem is we don't really know what intelligence is yet so we don't we don't
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:07.700]  have enough knowledge of the detailed structure of the human brain new question
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:12.620]  dr. DeGaris because how do you define intelligence I mean I remember decades
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:16.580]  ago people talking about IBM's chess playing programs and talking about that
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:20.660]  as being artificial intelligence that's not really autonomous thinking that's
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:24.980]  highly programmed it's running through a lot of different probabilities and
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:28.220]  and doing it in a way that is faster than humans but it's essentially relying
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:32.300]  on the programming of humans it's not autonomous independent thinking how
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.900]  would you define artificial intelligence I think you're talking about
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:40.700]  something completely different with artilics aren't you well intelligence
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:45.300]  means just the ability to solve problems quickly and more difficult the problem
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:49.700]  you know by definition the higher the intelligence so yeah my good friend
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:54.980]  Ben in fact will you would you be interviewing him at some stage yeah we'd
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:14:01.580]  like to yes yes well if you I don't have to twist his arm and your Ben Ben would
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:07.700]  be very willing so Ben's big thing is artificial general intelligence which
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:12.500]  sort of answers your question because today's AI is essentially very narrow
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:18.420]  it's very specific and detailed applied artificial intelligence to specific
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:25.500]  problems like look Google's probably the best example of AI but Ben's thing is a
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:31.220]  GI with the emphasis on the G meaning general so a general artificial
[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:35.940]  intelligence could could solve just about anything right it would be you know
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:39.340]  a master of many many different approaches to things and if one approach
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:43.540]  doesn't work well it tries something else and so on until it solves the
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:48.500]  problem which is pretty well what we do we have zillions of modules in our
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:54.020]  brain that specialize in lots of little tasks and they combine forces and if one
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:56.860]  approach doesn't work it will try something else until it solves the
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:01.140]  problem or it gives up now your approach is to essentially create an
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:05.220]  artificial brain replicating what we see in human brains as much as you can in
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:11.020]  electronics and artificial components and so you're looking at trying to get
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:16.660]  electronics to be very dense very quick looking at heat issues that are involved
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:22.900]  in that and you believe that if you get this model close enough if you build it
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:26.420]  essentially consciousness will come is that is that correct is that an over
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:32.260]  simplification? No no that's fine I mean it's just common sense really right if
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:38.500]  it's big if but if you copy the brain closely enough long enough and in
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:42.700]  sufficient detail sooner or later you'll end up with some creation that
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:47.180]  mimics the brain very very closely and therefore it should behave in the same
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:55.700]  way that that's the basic idea so long those lines how would you we've got the
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:16:00.140]  DARPA SNAPS project we've got the EU's facets project are those essentially
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:04.980]  working in the same vein in terms of trying to physically construct a brain
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:09.660]  that is modeled after the human brain? Yeah yeah yeah that's one of the two
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:13.020]  broad approaches and you've got a lot of other people working in the more
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:17.700]  engineering approach those two broad approaches I see as the fundamental to
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:21.300]  and they're all kinds of variants but they're the two big ones. Now we also
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:25.380]  have the brain initiative that's been been funded by the Obama administration
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:30.180]  $200 million this year $300 million next year that's half a billion dollars
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:33.780]  that they're funding they're saying that it is to the human brain that's
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:38.900]  it is to the human brain what the human genome project is to DNA that was trying
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:44.060]  to sequence the DNA what do you know what do you think about the brain
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:50.580]  initiative project? I suspect it's a little bit of politics I think I tried to cash up to the
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:56.340]  Europeans who came out with a billion dollar well a billion euro actually even
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:17:04.820]  more brain project they gave to professor what was his name? Markram in
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:12.860]  Switzerland to fund him to create an artificial brain that mimics very
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:18.180]  closely in fact even to the level of the connection between two brain cells or
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:27.140]  two synapses two neurons as they call so he Markram what's his first name? Henry
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:32.900]  yeah Henry Markram so he got a billion dollar research grant from the European
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:38.740]  Union to do this to build an artificial brain and what you're just saying just
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:44.860]  a little before the half a billion dollar project now similarly in America the
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:50.260]  Japanese are also putting a lot of money in this at the time is ripe yeah the
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:56.220]  electronics you're probably familiar with the Moore's law electronics yes so
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:01.380]  so yeah well just quickly to those who don't Moore's law simply says that the
[01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:06.500]  number of transistors you can cram on to a computer chip keeps doubling roughly
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:11.340]  every year or so and this trend's been around since so God made 60s so it's
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:16.020]  about half a half a century old this trend and it's still valid you know it
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:19.980]  hasn't hasn't fizzled out it's still true so if you take any number and you
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:23.700]  multiply by 2 by 2 by 2 by 2 you end up with a huge number so the number of
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:27.780]  transistors on today's chips is up in the I think it's now into the tens of
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:32.340]  billions right so you can put a lot of chips together in a computer box and
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:38.420]  you can make a very powerful system so the electronics is now enabling readily
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:42.900]  you know within reasonable costs the production of artificial brains so it's
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:46.340]  not surprising you see these artificial brain projects popping up all over the
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:52.940]  world like mushrooms so I see it's only a question of time before I call it the
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.420]  IQ gap yeah you have you have several different arguments as to why you think
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:00.940]  this is going to lead to the rise that are the likes of it in your book and of
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:05.180]  course one of those is the military momentum argument as you point out an
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:10.420]  intelligence gap just as we had a space gap with Sputnik you know we got we got
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:13.340]  concerned about that there's always this competition between different
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:16.660]  governments that they don't want to get left behind militarily and they tend to
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:21.220]  view everything from a military standpoint as actually as Eisenhower
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:26.500]  pointed out it's the military industrial complex part of it would be that it
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:30.460]  would take over pretty much all research at the universities and that's I
[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:34.740]  think we're seeing a large part of that happening now as well I want to when we
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:38.940]  get we got to go to break when we come back I want you to lay out how you see
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:43.260]  this coming to a conflict and I want to talk about the time frame that you also
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:46.140]  see this happening and stay with us we're going to be right back we're
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:50.580]  talking to Dr. Hugo DeGaris one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence we're
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.500]  talking about the Arnelec war we're going to be talking in the next segment
[01:19:53.500 --> 01:20:02.340]  about cosmos and Terence stay with us what good is a big Berke water filter we
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:06.260]  get that question a lot here at bigberkewaterfilters.com and in a word
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:09.540]  the answer is protection protection from water main breaks
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:13.700]  E. coli contamination environmental chemical spills pesticide runoff
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:18.780]  chlorine taste and smell and all forms of fluoride plus big Berke water filters
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.180]  are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:26.620]  for a reason tested by multiple independent NSF EPA certified labs
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:30.940]  they are the gold standard in water purification at only 1.7 cents a
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:35.260]  gallon a single set of filters can last for five to ten years that means big
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:39.940]  savings big Berke the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond

[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:03.100]  usually the older one gets the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:06.780]  less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body as a result
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:10.060]  you'll have less energy your tissues will shrink and you'll become wrinkled
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:14.260]  an older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly not
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:18.540]  fun however if you could consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:23.100]  then you may be able to gain back some strength muscle and speed of recovery
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:27.260]  one world way is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:32.300]  perfect answer for you my name is Errol I'm 74 years old you know the taste of

[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:14.260]  gold grime welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight we're talking to
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:19.340]  Dr. Hugo Degares from China right now is where he is in the middle of the night
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:24.340]  but he's graciously consented to come on and talk to us at this time and Dr.
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:27.020]  Degares there's an article that's up on the Guardian Today artificial
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:31.460]  intelligence and nanotechnology quote threatened civilization of course
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:36.300]  nanotech is one of the enabling technologies that you envision for a
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:41.620]  runaway godlike artificial intelligence to take place it's it has
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:49.020]  potential into the world problems itself doesn't it with gray goo well yeah
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:55.100]  nanotech combined with superior knowledge on how the brain works coming
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:25:01.380]  from neuroscience micro electron or nano electronics see a real wedding
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:06.500]  between those two so neuroscience on the one hand and nano electronics on the
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:13.220]  other hand and that that that is heating up already so in the 2020s I think
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:17.460]  you'll start seeing what I call the IQ gap mentioning bit before yes the IQ gap
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:22.300]  between human level intelligence and machine and particularly home robot
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:29.460]  level intelligent that gap in the 20s 2020s will seriously start to close and
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:33.620]  then you can imagine you know billions of people asking the same questions you
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:38.260]  are we going to allow machines to become as intelligent as we are could they
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:42.140]  become more intelligent is isn't that threatening is this something we can
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:46.380]  stop what about the rivalry with China between a China and America for the
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:52.100]  dominant power of the planet you know that that kind of thing so I see a real a real
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:57.820]  debate heating up well it's starting now if you're interested but yeah it could
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:01.620]  go through the various phases yeah I just mentioned I threw that term out there
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:05.940]  gray goo for people haven't looked at it there's the idea that again nanotech
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:11.060]  could turn into a runaway process as well just start replicating and
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:15.660]  essentially get out of control like the old science fiction movie the blob with
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:19.700]  Steve McQueen in it so all these technologies there's there's a
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:24.180]  concern that it's going to reach some point because technology is accelerating
[01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:27.900]  so fast that there's a concern that is going to reach a point at which it runs
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:32.540]  away from us and of course you believe that with artificial intelligence once
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:37.460]  it gets to a human level of independent thought that it's going to
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:41.260]  essentially run away because it's going to start redesigning and improving
[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:48.500]  itself is that correct yeah yeah so you know once what you have machine remember
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:53.700]  machine is thinking a million times faster than we do right there are human
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:58.260]  brain cells where we're thinking well our cells are communicating between each
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:03.180]  other at about 100 meters a second that's that's sort of maximum speed
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:07.940]  whereas an electronic brain it would be thinking at the speed of light like the
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:12.020]  signals between the components and in electronics is the speed of light which
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:16.420]  is a million times faster so these machines when they start reaching human
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:22.140]  level of intelligence plus the million-fold faster thinking speeds very
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:26.780]  quickly they could redesign themselves right and then the product could redesign
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:31.620]  itself so on and so on and then you get a kind of acceleration and so very
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:36.860]  quickly you get into hyperintelligence and physics the physics of computation
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:42.740]  predicts that these machines could become literally trillions of trillions of times
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:47.380]  more intelligent than we are so they would be narrow little gods I guess in
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:50.340]  the short term one of the things that I'm more concerned about of course is the
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:55.940]  military the kind of DARPA uses of machines you're saying that as robots
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:28:00.060]  go into our homes and so we start using them domestically people the mass
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:02.380]  public is going to look at this and say wait a minute these things are getting
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:06.500]  smarter every year they may wind up taking us over I'm concerned about the
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:11.540]  robots that we're seeing as we've had Dr. Noel Sharkey on he's concerned about
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:16.700]  killer robots about autonomous killing machines that we use as part of a
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:21.460]  military competition worried about that getting out of hand you see a different
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:26.180]  way of this turning into an artificial intelligence war you see different
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:30.260]  factions breaking up over whether or not we should continue to move forward with
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:34.700]  technology versus those who say we need to put the brakes on it stop it or maybe
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:38.100]  even completely disassemble it could you break that down for us real quickly here
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:44.060]  the cosmos versus Terence okay well those two scenarios you've been
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:48.820]  mentioning I see they'll proceed in parallel you know the great rivalry
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:56.540]  between China the rising China and the declining US so if you will imagine
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:29:01.660]  your Minister of Defense and you have control of the research budget on one
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:06.180]  side whether you whether your Chinese or American you do not have the luxury to
[01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:10.900]  allow the other guy on the other side to get ahead of you in terms of say the
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:15.060]  level of intelligence of your soldier robots or whatever so that rival we go
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:20.660]  we'll go ahead but on the second scenario with you know the domestic side
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:26.020]  the commercial getting music yes yes hang on we've got to go to a commercial
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:29.940]  break right after the break we're going to have Dr. Degares break down his
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:34.860]  central thesis that he put out in a book 10 years ago cosmos versus Terence and
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:40.180]  see how this might break out other than a competition between military powers
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:44.060]  stay with us we'll be right back with Dr. Hugo Degares
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:57.060]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:46.540]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we have on the line with us Dr. Hugo
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:51.100]  Degueres from China he's retired there now but he's been one of the pioneers in
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:56.500]  artificial intelligence ten years ago he's played out a very formal case for
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:01.580]  an artificial intelligence war a war over the development of artificial
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:06.260]  intelligence he saw this breaking down into two camps he termed those two camps
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:10.860]  cosmos and Terence and so I want to get his definition of those two camps now we
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:15.660]  want to talk about how close he thinks that is to happening and I want to talk
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:21.740]  to him about what I would call Dr. Degueres your your conflict over seeing
[01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:26.700]  this breaking out into possibly the extinction of the human species yet
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:31.260]  nevertheless being drawn to continue the development of it anyway I guess I
[01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:35.220]  would call it the Degueres paradox maybe I want to talk to you about that
[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:39.820]  because I think that's something that at every level scientists and engineers
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:43.860]  especially those working with the military industrial complex need to be
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:47.780]  thinking through these issues the ethical considerations about what they're
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:50.700]  doing the consequences of what they're doing so I want to get to that but
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:56.420]  before we do break down for us your idea of these two competing camps the
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:35:06.180]  cosmos and the Terence okay if you ask me what was the dominant political
[01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:10.860]  global political question of the 19th century I'd say probably was Marx's
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:15.300]  question you know who should own capital and that that question just divided
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:20.220]  society bitterly into the communists and the capitalists and we almost had a war
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:27.420]  in 1960 a nuclear war in 1962 over that relatively trivial issue but the the
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:32.020]  equivalent dominant global political question for the 21st century I see
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:41.900]  again in four words and that would be should humanity build
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:46.380]  intellects and now an intellect is an artificial intellect in other words a
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:51.100]  godlike massively intelligent machine with mental capacity so you know
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:57.740]  trillions of trillions of times above the human level so the people I label in
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:02.220]  favor of building those godlike machines and it'd be kind of religion for the
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:05.780]  most I mean a scientifically based religion but but a religion in a
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:13.260]  certain sense because they would be building gods and that's a you and on
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:17.020]  the other hand the people who are opposed to building these
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:22.060]  intellects they call them Terence that's not terror as in terrorist but terror
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:26.460]  the earth because that's their perspective they they want their number
[01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:32.900]  one priority is that human beings should remain the dominant species and
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:38.660]  intelligent whereas the cosmos that's based on the word cosmos the universe
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:44.460]  that's their picture because they see that if human beings if humanity does
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:51.220]  decide to build these godlike machines these up till next then probably very
[01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:54.300]  quickly they would decide you know what are we doing on this little head planet
[01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:57.620]  called the earth when there's a whole universe you know the whole cosmos out
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:04.860]  there to explore and and that cosmos may contain beings far far superior to to
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:08.020]  what they are these these intellects because they've been around for
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:13.940]  billions of years longer than we have our Sun our star is only what the third of
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:17.980]  the age of the universe so hang on just one second Dr. Degueres because we were
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:21.420]  showing some of the slides that you had sent us about your presentation and I'm
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:25.500]  looking at the one here where it has the stars and it says cosmos and it has
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:29.380]  cyborgs which is Ray Kurzweil's understanding of this and we see a
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:33.300]  part man part machine and then the one in the middle it says Terence and it
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:38.700]  shows a Terminator robot now I would look at that as thinking that was kind of
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:43.940]  more on the cosmos standpoint but your why would you choose the Terence for the
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:48.060]  Terence picture why would you choose the Terminator robot because the number one
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:53.980]  worry concern of the Terence is that if the cosmos go ahead and actually build
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:58.820]  these intellects and then the intellects become massively intelligent and and so
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:05.500]  superior to human beings that they look on us as an inferior pest who's this
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:09.860]  who's to say that's the vision of each of these groups the vision of the
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:23.980]  cosmos. Let me interject in here just momentarily you know Elon Musk is very
[01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:29.660]  concerned about a dystopian outcome from self-aware artificial intelligence I
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:34.300]  think it's interesting that he's also developing space X you think he is
[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:38.860]  trying to come up with a plan B so he's kind of a skateboard to get out of here
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:45.900]  in case this all goes down pretty bad. I had a scenario in my book that a bunch of
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:49.540]  cosmos researchers they they get in a rocket and try to escape from the earth
[01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:53.980]  to get away from the Terence but the Terence I would argue would be so
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:58.940]  fearful that if this escaping rocket did succeed in building intellects who's to
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:02.260]  say that the intellects might decide to we want to get back to the earth it's so
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:08.860]  full of raw materials and we've seen a lot of we've seen a lot of aspects of
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:12.060]  your book the art-like war we've seen that mirrored in movies when you're
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:18.140]  talking about cosmos trying to escape into a near-earth orbit or whatever to
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:22.740]  hide out it reminds me of what we saw in Elysium and of course with transcendence
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:27.860]  they they borrowed quite liberally from your scenario didn't they? There's an
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:32.660]  amusing little story behind transcendence do you want to hear it? Sure yeah go ahead.
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:38.860]  Okay well a couple years back I got hired by Warner Brothers to be the tech
[01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:46.140]  advisor to a movie that was to be called Twilight Zone. It's to be a remake of the
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:52.220]  popular 50s science fiction series Twilight Zone and so I was I was trying to
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:57.900]  look to advise them strongly saying look make the background story as realistic
[01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:03.660]  as possible set maybe you know 10 20 years in the future where AI is really
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:07.940]  becoming you know not a piece of science fiction anymore but it's getting real
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:13.540]  you know real AI and to the point where people are getting alarmed people are
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:19.700]  taking sides vigilante groups are being set up now in the movie transcendence
[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:25.740]  that that group was called Rift so in the movie what was called Rift is the
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:30.300]  equivalent of what I call Terence so it's the same thing so I didn't hear
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:35.460]  anything for a while so so I assumed the movie just died that that often happens
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:41.820]  in Hollywood and then suddenly upcoming fliers and trailers for this movie
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:48.140]  transcendence and I look at it and say hey hey that's my story so what I think
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:53.100]  happened because transcendence is water brothers right it's a water brothers
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:41:00.020]  marriage so what I'm deeply suspicious was the ideas were transferred
[01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:05.220]  transferred from one movie to the other movie and then that way they didn't have
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:11.180]  to pay me the five-figure bonus for getting the movie films
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:16.060]  that would be the first time something like that happened now you're looking at
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:19.900]  essentially a conflict people being concerned because they see rapidly
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:23.460]  advancing artificial intelligence perhaps they see a control of their life
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:28.900]  slipping away increasingly a power being concentrated maybe there's massive
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:34.020]  unemployment that people are concerned about because of the use of lower level
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:37.900]  artificial intelligence so people start to push back against it especially those
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:42.380]  who are concerned that it may become the kind of threat that we saw in the
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:45.740]  Terminator movie we're talking about movies you know where the SkyNet becomes
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:50.580]  self-aware and then they start acting like we saw a Sarah Connors act in
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:55.060]  Terminator 2 where she starts going after let's say key scientists we
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:57.700]  actually had this already happen in real life didn't we with the Unabomber with
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:01.860]  Ted Kaczynski going out if you look at his manifesto that's exactly what he
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:06.420]  was concerned about he was targeting what he thought were key scientists doing
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:10.740]  it in a very violent way trying to blow them up with letter bombs and that sort
[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:15.180]  of thing but that's essentially what you see happening even if we don't get to
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:20.140]  the level where we have super intelligent artificial intelligences that
[01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:23.620]  become self-aware the Artilex as you refer to them even if that doesn't
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:29.020]  happen prior to that it would be the idea of it or the implementation of the
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:33.260]  early stages of it would set different camps and humanity against each other
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:40.860]  into a violent war yeah yeah indeed it depends on whether this level of
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:47.220]  development of artificial intelligence is quick or slow the guys in the you
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:52.340]  know specialists in this area they talk about slow takeoff and fast takeoff
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:56.220]  that they don't know if you're familiar with those terms so if there's a fast
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:43:02.220]  takeoff meaning that these machines rapidly become ultra intelligent then
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:07.100]  they may not be enough time for human politics to unfold so they're just
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:13.300]  there it's just a complete and so then human humanity's fate would lie in the
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:17.540]  hands of these athletes but I think it's more realistic to say probably there's
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:21.700]  going to be a slow takeoff because trying to figure out how the human brain
[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:27.740]  works is very very difficult problem so probably the most realistic scenario is
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:33.380]  I see that human humanity will have enough time to react politically as
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:37.380]  these machines get smarter and smarter and the time frame you mentioned a bit
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:42.780]  about the time frame I see the home robot industry becoming one of the
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:48.780]  biggest and richest in the world say by the end of the 20s so say you know a
[01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:54.860]  decade decade and a half from now and so as they become these machines become
[01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:59.580]  more and more intelligent and more and more useful then you know people will buy
[01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:04.180]  them because if these machines truly can walk the dog and babysit the kids and
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:07.460]  tell you stories and entertain you and sex you and educate you and all these
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:12.300]  things people will pay big money maybe even more than for a car just just to
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:16.220]  have a home robot and then of course a year or two later you know they upgrade
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:20.140]  their model you know they go and trade in their old one for a new one and the
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:24.020]  new one has a much richer vocabulary and since a few and it's cynical it can do
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:28.420]  far more things that once you've had several upgrades like this then
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:32.660]  millions you have billions of people who will be asking you know the same
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:37.020]  questions will will these machines become smarter than we are and then that
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:43.140]  will set what I call the species dominance debate you know really start
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:48.340]  really start rating in the in the 2020s perhaps dr. DeGaris what might happen as
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:52.020]  we come increasingly dependent on them might be this an extrapolation the same
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:55.780]  thing we see as people become increasingly self-absorbed into social
[01:44:55.780 --> 01:45:00.820]  media and game and games we might see the human race not being necessarily
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:04.580]  overtaken by the machines that human racial descend into some kind of an
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:09.580]  idiocracy that is the level of the machines that we currently have now so
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:12.500]  we've talked about the economic momentum that might lead to this we've talked
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:15.620]  about the military momentum the competition between nation-states that
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:20.940]  might drive this kind of rise of artificial intelligence I want to talk
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:25.660]  about your your argument that you make in the book that what really kind of
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:30.100]  motivates you even though you think this might result in the extinction of the
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:34.380]  human species you're driven to do it because you see yourself almost as you
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:39.540]  mentioned earlier a scientific religion the the enticement of building
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:44.140]  artificial gods that's that's something that motivates you very strongly isn't
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:51.100]  well I'm you know don't forget I'm retired see I I do not want to be a I
[01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:55.940]  tear an assassin that'll be for young that'll be for younger guys you're not
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:59.540]  involved in the fight in your potential all your potential terror and
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:03.540]  assassins out there just don't forget that but I'm retired I don't do this
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:09.040]  stuff anymore no no I'm a globacator I use I make YouTube videos for PhD level
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:12.820]  math and physics to educate the planet for free that's that's my new career so
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:16.940]  so I don't actually build artificial brains anymore and what's that website
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:22.940]  go ahead and tell everybody what that website is can you can show it on the
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:30.100]  screen so it's it's yes are you able to show it on the screen yes we can yes
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:36.380]  prof Hugo de garris is that what it is yes yes the actual they've got it up
[01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:41.180]  right now prof Hugo de garris wordpress.com and people can see that up
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:44.420]  here right now okay and so that's what you're doing right now as a retired
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:48.700]  person so if you're out there and you're angry and you want to pull a unabomber
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:52.060]  Ted Kaczynski on somebody he's not your man
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:56.300]  leave him alone he's just looking at this stuff and and talking about the
[01:46:56.300 --> 01:47:00.380]  argument behind it yes good right so I've been I've been advising my friends
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:10.100]  and colleagues like for example those who are those those who are active they're
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:14.980]  gonna have to be increasingly careful now it's too soon now but you know when
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:20.300]  when they get into the 2020s and the species dominance debate really starts
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:25.300]  heating up you know surely humanity build outlets when that question is on
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:29.940]  everyone's mind then then you know all these not cases will come out of the
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:34.220]  woodwork and so these these developers will have to be very careful where they
[01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:38.980]  go and appearing in public and so forth and I can imagine companies like IBM and
[01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:44.900]  Google and so on they will definitely have to beef up their security yes it's
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:47.740]  something that everybody is talking about now in the mainstream media at
[01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:51.700]  least the idea that there is a potential of some kind of a threat down the road
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:55.580]  this was not something that anybody other than sites like Infowars was talking
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:59.500]  about a few years ago we've been talking about how this might go down badly and
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:03.460]  of course we were just dismissed as wide-eyed conspiracy theorists I'm sure
[01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:06.900]  you've had a lot of people tell you they think that this is pure fantasy as
[01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:12.340]  well yeah well now the idea is out there right because of the movie
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:15.380]  transcendence there are billions of people have seen that movie and the
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:22.500]  ideas in their heads so you know what did Rift do they were assassinating the
[01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:27.060]  principal artificial brain researchers and and sabotaging the artificial brain
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:33.660]  companies and so forth so Google, IBM etc they they need to pay attention this
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:37.500]  this is something that will very probably happen in the 2020s that's
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:41.020]  my prediction that's my time frame talk to us a little bit about this this
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:46.660]  conflict that you have about wanting to build this massively intelligent
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:49.860]  artificial intelligence even though you think that it may have a dystopian
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:55.020]  outcome the fact that you're concerned about this you you have arguments on
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:59.500]  both sides for the cosmos as you call them and as for the Terrans who are
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:03.460]  opposed to this kind of or concerned about how this is going to get out of
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:07.780]  hand yet you yourself describe yourself pretty much in the cosmos camp you're
[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:12.460]  really drawn to the idea the not that you're doing the research anymore but
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:19.580]  you're drawn to the idea that we need to create these godlike artificial
[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:23.740]  intelligences that that may kill us I find that paradox to be very interesting
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:34.220]  yeah well I'm torn and for a decade or two I get lots of talks must still do
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:39.900]  and I'll invite the audience to vote I'll say okay you've been presented with
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:43.220]  the arguments pro and con you shoot humanity build these intellects or not
[01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:49.100]  let's take a vote and often the the split would be pretty well 50-50 you know
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:54.260]  pro intellect and against building intellects and then people after a while
[01:49:54.260 --> 01:50:01.420]  would come up to me and say oh Hugo I'm so torn you're on the one hand you know
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:05.340]  the idea that billions of human beings might get exterminated as a result of
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:09.380]  this that absolutely horrifies me and and and it does me too of course personal
[01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:15.220]  and on the other hand building these godlike creatures is like hypnotic
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:23.780]  right it's our pathetic puny little human lives that gets snuffed out in a
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:28.500]  mere 80 years in a universe that's billions of years old you know that
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:33.060]  that's the kind of vision that the the cosmos have they would be building gods
[01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:37.500]  that would be immortal we're gonna go up to commercial break hang on dr. DeGaris
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:40.300]  we're gonna go to commercial break we're gonna come back with dr. Hugo DeGaris
[01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:44.340]  artificial intelligence pioneer we're talking about the first artificial
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:47.860]  intelligence wars what that may be based on we're gonna talk when we come back
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:51.180]  about some of the objections that people have brought up to the idea that this
[01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:54.740]  could happen stay with us we'll be right back

[01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:57.060]  specials there dr. DaGarras is we've been talking about the coming conflict
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:55:01.220]  over artificial intelligence whether or not we should proceed with that one of
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:07.860]  the things that concerns me is that artificial intelligence as a weapon by
[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:12.660]  small elite group that we've seen the as we talked about the military aspect the
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:16.940]  military composite competition between different countries we see really I
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:21.580]  think the thing that concerns me as an engineer I can consistently see
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:26.220]  technology being used now in a very dark way and I think it's because as
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:30.140]  Eisenhower warned us with the military industrial complex we see really that
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:35.700]  DARPA and military industrial complex is pretty much taken over research at the
[01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:39.620]  university and I'm concerned that whenever we see in the past throughout
[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:44.580]  history whenever technology is widely disseminated then we have liberty we
[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:49.340]  have freedom of the people but when it is concentrated in the hands of a few
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:55.540]  then we see that society trends towards tyranny and despotism so that's one of
[01:55:55.540 --> 01:56:02.660]  the things that concerns me about artificial intelligence well I personally
[01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:07.020]  I have a real hatred of the International Central Banksters and all
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:11.260]  their cronies and all horrible things they've done in the 20th century I like
[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:17.940]  to see those guys put behind bars as you know I share a lot of your goals that
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:23.500]  way one of the reasons why I see the Terrans becoming absolutely paranoid
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:28.300]  is that it may be technologically possible within a decade or so for just a
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:34.260]  small team of Cosmists in their basement to to build artificial brains that
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:39.740]  then accelerate into hyperintelligence very quickly and so I can imagine the
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:45.980]  Terrans at government level going going on a kind of witch hunt you know they'll
[01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:49.620]  be sneaking into everybody's lives trying to you know is this guy's a is
[01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:54.060]  this guy a Cosmist is that guy a Cosmist and so on maybe people at the
[01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:58.540]  governmental level that are using the work of the Cosmists for their own
[01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:03.540]  particular agenda that's what really concerns me yeah well I've got a book
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:10.140]  chapter coming up pretty soon how will the art-elect war start you're trying to
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:14.060]  dream up various scenarios and who knows there may be even that government
[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:17.460]  level different different governments some Terrans some Cosmists and
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:22.860]  eventually you know it goes nuclear so there you get your giga death so it's
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:26.900]  very hard to predict the detailed scenario that will actually unfold but
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:31.660]  the debate will heat up in the late teens you know just it's starting now
[01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:37.620]  right in the 20s it'll get hot in the 30s I predict it'll go political you
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:41.620]  will be into what I call the fourth phase the political phase you'll start
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:46.580]  getting the terrorism and sabotage and assassinations and so forth and then
[01:57:46.580 --> 01:57:51.300]  after that well you know it's very hard to predict but it's such an issue that's
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:57.260]  that will dominate and divide humanity so bitterly because the two ideologies
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:58:01.780]  are just so powerful on the one hand you'd be building gods and on the other
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:07.340]  hand you're risking the survival of the human species yes and the question is
[01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:10.540]  just kind of like you mentioned they were initially talking about your
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:15.100]  Twilight Zone movie there was a Twilight Zone episode it was called to serve man
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:18.860]  these aliens who come in and give this beneficial technology to people and then
[01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:21.740]  at the end of the episode somebody sneaks into the ship and sees that to serve
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:26.980]  man is actually a cookbook and so we always need to work out with this we're
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:29.500]  gonna come back we're gonna take your phone calls if you got any questions
[01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:36.540]  for dr. Hugo DeGaris he's consented to take those 800 259 9231 800 259 9231
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:39.980]  we're gonna talk about some questions and objections that people have they
[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:54.100]  want us in the near future when you realize how fake it all is the
[01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:59.900]  football the basketball security alert this is homeland security analysis
[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:04.900]  info wars building media operation but the worst people get controlled and
[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:10.180]  tell us that we are the ones responsible prime-directed discredit Alex Jones
[01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:15.020]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory popular conspiracy theory talk
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:19.460]  show called info wars Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail these people are
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:25.300]  assaulting targeting of patriots engaged they're never going to stop they're

[01:59:47.700 --> 02:00:08.700]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream media government
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:16.300]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:25.420]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex
[02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:30.100]  Jones show I'm David night your host and we have with us from China dr. Hugo
[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:34.020]  DeGeris on the line we've been talking about his book the art elect war which
[02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:39.340]  is a scenario for the first wars over artificial intelligence whether or not
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:43.620]  we should proceed down that path two different factions of course as we were
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:47.340]  talking about in the last segment I'm also I'm personally concerned as we
[02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:52.740]  talk about quite often here at info wars the misuse of technology technology
[02:00:52.740 --> 02:00:57.940]  being taken over by DARPA by the military industrial complex in use for war and
[02:00:57.940 --> 02:01:03.300]  of course as dr. DeGeris pointed out he is against that as well but it is a force
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:08.620]  that is very difficult to keep that genie in the bottle one of the arguments
[02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:12.380]  that he has in his book for why this will proceed besides economic momentum of
[02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:16.900]  course as the military momentum the fear that some other country will have
[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:20.900]  that capability and you won't so that drives that kind of development but in
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:26.740]  this segment I want to take calls from you the listeners 800 259 9231 that's
[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:31.340]  800 259 9231 will take your calls through this half hour Paul Joseph
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:34.820]  Watson will be joining us from the UK at the bottom of the hour and I wanted to
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:39.580]  throw out to you dr. DeGeris some of the objections that you address in the back
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:45.340]  of your book for example why not cyborgs like Ray Kurzweil talks about man
[02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:55.660]  merging with machines well I tried to keep things simple so I really only
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:02:00.940]  wanted like two camps but in reality you know except there will be a third camp
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:06.660]  those so-called cyborgs cybernetic organisms in other words part machine
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:15.820]  and part human so you could well you know I don't even see this I'm I'm I'm
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:20.620]  adding components to my own brain and updating my own brain I can become more
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:25.980]  capable think faster greater memory and so forth so I think there will be
[02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:31.660]  millions of people in the big dream of the cyborgs of course is that they
[02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:36.460]  want to become afterlit gods themselves yes and what that's a large part of the
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:42.060]  research that we see being done by DARPA augmenting humans with mechanical and
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:46.700]  means to create essentially a super soldier right now the main argument
[02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:53.180]  against it is that if you take you know with nanotech if you if you take I don't
[02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:58.540]  even see it but imagine I between my thumb and finger I have a single grain
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:04.300]  of sand imagine but it's been nanotech so that it can manipulate one bit of
[02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:10.620]  information on one atom okay so one bit per atom and this atom can switch back
[02:03:10.620 --> 02:03:14.740]  and forth excited not excited excited not excited it can switch back and forth
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:19.660]  in a femtosecond so that's that's a thousandth of a trillionth of a second
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:23.900]  but you can calculate pretty readily how many atoms in a single grain of sand
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:28.420]  let's say a cubic millimeter when you when you do the math it works out that
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:35.220]  that single grain of sand can outperform in computer terms the computing
[02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:40.620]  capacity estimated of the human brain by a factor of a quintillion that's a
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:49.220]  million trillion times more than the brain so my argument against the cosmos
[02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:53.220]  is that effectively if they start adding these grains of sand to their own brain
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:58.340]  very quickly they're no longer human right they're artilex maybe in human
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:02.580]  disguise but effectively they're artilex so from the point of view of the Terrans
[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:07.100]  they will just simply lump the cyborgists you know the people who want to be
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:12.300]  cyborgs and the cosmos into the same camp they're effectively the same the
[02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:16.260]  same group because once in the technology it becomes advanced enough this
[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:21.540]  there's not much difference between a pure machine no pure artilect and a
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:27.060]  cyborg effectively they're the same so really I get back to the two major camps
[02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:32.180]  you know the cosmos on the one hand and the Terrans on the other okay we got to
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:35.180]  go to a commercial break we've got the phone lines lit up we've got a lot of
[02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:38.260]  people want to ask you calls and we come back I got one more question I want to
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:41.900]  ask you that we'll briefly address and then we can go to our callers and that
[02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:46.940]  is why not do what Isaac Asimov said why not have a positronic brain with
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:51.500]  preventative laws of robots essentially a kill switch so we'll get doctor to
[02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:55.420]  Garris's answer I've read his answer in the book you can get that book as the
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:59.140]  artilex war cosmos versus Terrans say with us we'll be right back with your

[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:58.420]  show I'm David Knight we have with us dr. Hugo de garras he's on the line from
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:02.300]  China he has been a pioneer researcher in the field of artificial
[02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:07.100]  intelligence also especially in the subfield of evolvable hardware we
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:09.540]  haven't really talked about that but he does cover that quite a bit in his book
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:15.500]  the art-elect war we were looking at how this might go down badly because that
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:19.940]  was the central thesis of his book the art-elect war how artificial
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:24.220]  intelligence would become essentially self-aware as we've seen in the
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:29.340]  Terminator movie that's probably the most famous example in pop pop culture
[02:09:29.340 --> 02:09:32.060]  there are a lot of people who are concerned that this may go down badly
[02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:36.540]  we've got Elon Musk setting up a $10 million foundation to try to make sure
[02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:40.860]  that artificial intelligence stays under control but dr. de garras doesn't
[02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:45.900]  believe that it can be controlled in the long term and I guess dr. garras we're
[02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:49.740]  going to take some phone calls people have questions one quick question many
[02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:53.180]  people have asked you in the past why not just design a kill switch why not put
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:57.780]  something like Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics inside of these
[02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:03.860]  artificial intelligences to keep them under control well there's a bit of a
[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:11.420]  bit going on right now amongst the specialists and they call the concept
[02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:14.780]  friendly AI and personally I think it's I'm very cynical that this can be done I
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:19.860]  mean what you're talking about is designing a machine so it remains human
[02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:26.100]  friendly no matter how advanced it when it redesigns itself in the future so
[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:31.380]  machine one redesigns machine two and remains human friendly which designs
[02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:34.980]  machine three and so on and remains human friendly until it becomes like a
[02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:39.260]  trillion trillion times more capable than human beings and it's still human
[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:45.060]  friendly I find that idea ridiculous I mean it's just so arrogant and it's
[02:10:45.060 --> 02:10:50.580]  just a fuss now at the beginning that's the the brain builders can create a
[02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:55.500]  friendly AI to begin with but once these machines start becoming really smart and
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:59.100]  they read redesign themselves and so forth that the idea that they will
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:03.700]  always remain human friendly I just find ridiculous once they get to the level
[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:05.980]  of human intelligence we're gonna have the same problem we have with humans we
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:09.420]  got a lot of humans who are not human friendly don't we let's go to some of
[02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:12.540]  the callers and give them a chance to ask some questions let's go to Artie and
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:19.020]  Knate and Canada Artie go ahead thank you David the author Annie Jacobson is
[02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:23.580]  completing a trilogy of books when she publishes her third book this fall and
[02:11:23.580 --> 02:11:28.140]  it's all about her research into DARPA and Pentagon development of artificial
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:32.740]  artificial intelligence and she said that it was this research that scared her
[02:11:32.740 --> 02:11:41.300]  the most I'm wondering if Dr. DaGarrick was contacted by Annie Jacobson no no
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:47.700]  I don't have that name before well you might have been in China for the last
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:52.700]  before he retired he was in China so you probably you weren't really involved
[02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:55.900]  with the DARPA project but every government is essentially going to be
[02:11:55.900 --> 02:12:00.100]  going down this military path aren't they Dr. DaGarrick? Well I know I know the
[02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:07.540]  Chinese are there's a whole bunch of billionaires in China in Beijing and
[02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:17.100]  they're they're getting into this and Ben Goetzel probably may set up an AGI
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:22.820]  Institute that that's quite likely in the near future in Beijing so you know
[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:28.180]  the rivalry is heating up between China and and America on this kind of stuff
[02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:32.540]  like I say one side does not have the luxury to allow to allow the other side
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:36.940]  to get too far ahead of it so it'll be kind of ratcheting up you know just
[02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:41.180]  yeah like this exactly as we've seen when and every other kind of arms race
[02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:43.900]  Artie was there anything else that you wanted to add to that as you point out
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:47.540]  somebody wrote a book they said the thing that scared them most in terms of
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:50.460]  researching DARPA was the artificial intelligence aspect was there anything
[02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:56.300]  else you want to add to that well as a Christian I don't believe that our
[02:12:56.300 --> 02:13:01.140]  artificial intelligence can take on selfhood unless it were actually
[02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:08.060]  possessed by a spiritual entity because only selfhood and will are intrinsic
[02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:13.900]  only to that to a spiritual entirety mm-hmm yeah I would I would kind of fall
[02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:16.500]  along that line I would phrase a little bit differently as a Christian I look
[02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:19.740]  at it and I say well you know we make the arguments about increased
[02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:25.380]  computational power and Moore's law but essentially you know computational power
[02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:28.860]  doesn't necessarily get you to consciousness I know that that you
[02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:32.460]  take a different view of that Dr. DaGarris that you believe that it will
[02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:35.860]  eventually happen because you're looking at it from a strictly physical
[02:13:35.860 --> 02:13:39.300]  standpoint we're looking at it from a I guess you could say a more medical
[02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:42.980]  physical stant metaphysical standpoint
[02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:49.420]  philosophically I'm a physicalist human human babies get built of course you
[02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:52.620]  know they start off as a fertilized single egg and it multiplies and
[02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:57.940]  multiplies you know 248 16 30 to 100 trillion cells but the whole thing gets
[02:13:57.940 --> 02:14:03.820]  built and that's what DNA is all about it's a kind of self-assembly instruction
[02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:08.860]  molecule piece of software if you like so and all that software and all those
[02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:14.540]  cells and they're all just molecules right so at that scale of thing there's
[02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:17.740]  so much difference between a machine with you know what's carbon and so forth
[02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:22.500]  and a human being that it's all molecules it's just a different structure of
[02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:28.780]  molecules so I'm not religious in that sense I consider that to be from a
[02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:32.860]  bygone age well yeah I would agree with you I don't want to turn this into a
[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:38.900]  religious discussion but yeah I don't have a I don't have a intellectual
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:44.180]  problem with God because I see intelligent design there and so I believe
[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:49.380]  these things are not self-organized the components of an artificial brain aren't
[02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:53.220]  going to assemble themselves on a desk I you know it needs a designer like you
[02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:58.580]  for example to put it together well in terms of ID intelligent design I'm
[02:14:58.580 --> 02:15:04.580]  very open to that because the math and physics see I now teach PhD level math
[02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:08.820]  and physics and so I know a lot of that stuff and personally not just my
[02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:14.100]  personal view that I wouldn't be a tall surprise that the laws of physics have
[02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:18.660]  been actually designed and I'm deeply suspicious that that's the case because
[02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:24.260]  wine earth is the universe what why are the laws of physics so deeply
[02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:30.380]  mathematical that was Crick and Watson at least one of them talked put out the
[02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:33.780]  idea of panspermia after he looked at DNA said hey this is a program this is
[02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:38.180]  this is built of course he didn't want to embrace the God of the Bible so he
[02:15:38.180 --> 02:15:42.180]  created some aliens who would come and do that but I want to get back to some
[02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:46.580]  of the other calls let's go to a Brian in Indiana Brian
[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:54.660]  are you still there okay let's go to JD in Mississippi JD okay well let's go to
[02:15:54.660 --> 02:16:01.540]  Michael in Missouri Michael go ahead yeah how you doing David good go ahead yeah
[02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:05.100]  first I just want to say something that you probably have the interest in just
[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:10.820]  real quick we're asked my question I have a friend named Josh and we set up a
[02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:17.420]  gofundme.com slash the promised land fun for him it's just all about this
[02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:23.180]  medical tyranny I don't want to explain it people can go there it's a gofundme.com
[02:16:23.180 --> 02:16:28.860]  slash the promised land with a okay on the promise that's good yeah you have a
[02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:32.820]  question for Dr. DeGarris on artificial intelligence I was wondering if he's
[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:38.340]  ever read the book The Feed that came out in probably the last 15 years and if he
[02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:43.740]  has does he think that I mean it's a fictional book but is that we were
[02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:48.460]  headed because that I mean I don't want to be going there well what's the
[02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:56.300]  premise of that book it's where most of the population live in huge cities all
[02:16:56.300 --> 02:17:01.180]  over the country and they travel on uptars to tubes and there's a small
[02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:06.060]  population of people who don't have any chips in them like a gender 21 in other
[02:17:06.060 --> 02:17:13.100]  words okay Dr. DeGarris did you have any comment on that it's a little bit off
[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:27.860]  topic but yes yes we share that concern absolutely let's go to Eric and
[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:40.300]  Michigan Eric
[02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:58.620]  as God's as creating God's and also referring you're referring to the human
[02:17:58.620 --> 02:18:03.940]  we'd be the gods if we're the ones that are creating the machines just like a
[02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:14.140]  lot of people believe that God created our universe well I think Dr. DeGarris
[02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:17.820]  did you want to address that I think your idea is that these these once they
[02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:22.660]  get to a certain level they would transcend us yes yeah yeah yeah yeah
[02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:26.940]  that's the obvious answer I mean obviously we as humans we would be the
[02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:33.100]  parents we would kick off we would start the process and then up there very
[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:37.060]  quickly they they would just gather their own momentum and just do it
[02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:41.340]  themselves and and very quickly we human beings we wouldn't be able to
[02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:44.140]  understand what they were doing I mean they're thinking a million times faster
[02:18:44.140 --> 02:18:47.780]  than we are they're growing their circuitry at a rate that we couldn't
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:51.380]  understand they could rearrange their circuitry and architecture in like
[02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:56.700]  milliseconds you we would just be absolutely lost but yes we we are at
[02:18:56.700 --> 02:19:01.980]  square zero we start the process we kick it off and then it goes ahead on its
[02:19:01.980 --> 02:19:06.380]  own momentum the idea that once they get to a certain level of intelligence and
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:09.340]  capable of independent thought that you would have something similar to what we
[02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:13.740]  saw portrayed in the movie Terminator when Skynet becomes self-aware or you
[02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:18.060]  might think of it the intelligence is reaching a critical mass if you want to
[02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:21.020]  use a nuclear analogy once it reaches a critical mass all of a sudden it just
[02:19:21.020 --> 02:19:25.140]  explodes and starts to go and you should point out the the real question is
[02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:29.180]  whether or not it's going to happen quickly or over a slower period of time
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:33.380]  let's go to Dennis in Colorado Dennis oh wait we've got to go to a commercial

[02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:43.700]  possibility of an artificial intelligence war one fought over the
[02:19:43.700 --> 02:19:47.380]  development of artificial intelligence or perhaps one fought with artificial
[02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:59.820]  intelligence stay with us we'll be right back

[02:24:14.860 --> 02:24:18.340]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're talking to Dr. Hugo
[02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:21.860]  DeGaris one of the pioneers in artificial intelligence we're talking to him
[02:24:21.860 --> 02:24:26.700]  about his book the art alike war about the first war of artificial
[02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:30.140]  intelligence actually a war over whether artificial intelligence should be
[02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:35.100]  developed but they're not we're going to have super intelligent machines that
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:40.380]  might threaten the existence of mankind Dr. DeGaris takes a dystopian view of
[02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:44.620]  a long term over artificial intelligence versus Ray Kurzweil's
[02:24:44.620 --> 02:24:48.780]  decidedly utopian view I want to get to your calls and questions we just have
[02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:51.620]  him for one more second so let's try to go through these as quickly as we can
[02:24:51.620 --> 02:25:00.060]  let's go to Al in Arkansas out the Dr. DeGaris I guess not as much as a
[02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:05.180]  question as it is a comment as a Christian but I believe that we man
[02:25:05.180 --> 02:25:10.620]  exalts himself to a situation of trying to make yourself God that we will suffer
[02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:17.740]  God's wrath do you have any comment about that and that's just my question I guess
[02:25:17.740 --> 02:25:25.660]  well I'm not I'm not religious humanity has invented about a hundred
[02:25:25.660 --> 02:25:30.180]  thousand different gods over the broad suite of history and over the planet
[02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:36.340]  every primitive little tribe invents its own gods so I'm somewhat cynical of one
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:39.660]  particular like like everyone's an atheist you probably heard this I can
[02:25:39.660 --> 02:25:43.780]  be poor everyone's an atheist with respect to the 99.999% of
[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:50.100]  gods that they don't believe in and the atheist just goes one step further okay
[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:54.220]  yeah that's I think what the caller is getting at is the actually goes back to
[02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:56.900]  one of the first stories in the Bible Garden of Eden where the promise was
[02:25:56.900 --> 02:26:00.220]  you'll become like God and I guess that's always been an enticement to
[02:26:00.220 --> 02:26:05.900]  motivate people let's let's go to JD in Mississippi JD you had a question about
[02:26:05.900 --> 02:26:12.380]  drones for Dr. Hugo DeGaris yes I was wondering I might be a little bit naive
[02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:20.340]  on the subject but how will how will they get by the fail-safe switch or the
[02:26:20.340 --> 02:26:27.380]  kill switch and also how will drones refuel themselves or will they just have
[02:26:27.380 --> 02:26:32.020]  so many of them that it won't matter you know will they just you know there'll be
[02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:36.780]  so many of them that that you know for a swarm well Dr. DeGaris is really kind of
[02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:40.380]  talking about a different kind of thing he's talking about massively
[02:26:40.380 --> 02:26:45.300]  intelligent artificial intelligence but of course autonomous drones that is
[02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:49.180]  maybe one way that we may see some manifestation of some early artificial
[02:26:49.180 --> 02:26:56.900]  intelligence isn't it Dr. DeGaris well I imagine drones I'm not an expert in
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:27:03.740]  this field but there are drones like the size of a centimeter really really
[02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:10.220]  tiny micro movies yeah so once you know the resolution the cameras and control on
[02:27:10.220 --> 02:27:13.660]  you know once all those technical problems been solved and for all that
[02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:18.020]  that's already the case then I can imagine this spying just going on
[02:27:18.020 --> 02:27:23.300]  everywhere all over the planet including you know the things that the governments
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:28.100]  want to keep secret so so it's a like a two-inch sword so then the public becomes
[02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:32.260]  more aware of the so-called secret installations and all these bunkers
[02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:38.140]  underneath the underground and so on so that your governments have a really
[02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:43.060]  hard time keeping anything secret yes I hope that kind of thing happens you know
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:45.900]  what we're seeing right now with drones is essentially like remote control
[02:27:45.900 --> 02:27:49.180]  killing devices we even had an article earlier this week there's on the dredge
[02:27:49.180 --> 02:27:54.380]  report about some police departments using remote control mechanical cops I
[02:27:54.380 --> 02:27:56.980]  mean that's not what we're talking about here in terms of artificial
[02:27:56.980 --> 02:28:02.100]  intelligence but you know that is I think what most people are thinking about
[02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:06.420]  in terms of the projection of power the concentration of power let's go quickly
[02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:14.180]  to Brian and Indiana Brian hello go ahead thank you thank you thanks David
[02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:19.260]  my question was about the possible malevolence versus benevolence of AI you
[02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:23.420]  know as in seen in Isaac Asimov the last question if you're familiar with the
[02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:29.940]  story like what do you call it I'm sorry pray by Michael Crichton if you're
[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:41.060]  familiar that's the right to I think he's asking maybe the AI's will be
[02:28:41.060 --> 02:28:45.340]  benevolent I know that the movie that recently came out Ray Kurzweil was very
[02:28:45.340 --> 02:28:48.500]  excited about that because basically they they reached to a point where they
[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:51.420]  say yeah you guys are fine but you're really not very interesting they just
[02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:56.780]  basically go off on their own to the wrong thing well I see both I mean
[02:28:56.780 --> 02:29:00.940]  obviously there'll be real benefits you know we can get rid of cancer and
[02:29:00.940 --> 02:29:05.140]  disease and aging and you know all this wonderful nano stuff on the positive
[02:29:05.140 --> 02:29:10.100]  side I don't deny that there'll be definitely both both aspects but it's
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:13.940]  the negative that really worries me you know once once once these machines
[02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:19.340]  become massively intelligent then who's to say that they may look on us as pests
[02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:23.060]  and then decide to wipe us out that that's what really worries me yes and
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:28.700]  I'm concerned as I know you are dr. DaGarris as to what our governments are
[02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:32.180]  going to do with the technology that we hand them that's why I think it's a
[02:29:32.180 --> 02:29:37.580]  very interesting paradox for people who are in engineering and science to think
[02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:40.260]  about the consequences of what they're developing thank you so much for joining
[02:29:40.260 --> 02:29:44.780]  us dr. Hugo DaGarris again that book is the Ardell Lake War ten years old but
[02:29:44.780 --> 02:29:48.700]  very relevant today today it's in the discussion we'll be right back with we're

[02:33:30.980 --> 02:33:34.420]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining me in the
[02:33:34.420 --> 02:33:39.740]  studio right now is Anthony Gucciardi you know we talk we have the opera music
[02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:43.100]  from Tennessee Ernie Ford's about 16 tons you lose 16 times what do you get
[02:33:43.100 --> 02:33:47.860]  well he's got an article up 2,500 tons of fake food tell us about that Anthony
[02:33:47.860 --> 02:33:52.460]  that's right so overall we keep hearing about all of these you know horse meat
[02:33:52.460 --> 02:33:55.940]  substitutes being put into burgers and everything but it turns out it's much
[02:33:55.940 --> 02:34:01.700]  much much worse than that an inner pole with Euro pole seized 2,500 tons of
[02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:07.340]  actually fake food not just bad fast food we're talking about vodka that was
[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:11.500]  made in any freeze containers that had any freeze in it and they would scrub it
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:15.260]  out with different chemicals get rid of the scent put vodka in it and sell it as
[02:34:15.260 --> 02:34:19.620]  premium brands across the world wow and they had seafood they had lobsters
[02:34:19.620 --> 02:34:23.660]  being sold they were completely fake mineral water dietary supplements as
[02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:27.380]  we found out from New York the attorney general found that about 80% of the
[02:34:27.380 --> 02:34:30.220]  supplements you get at Walmart and stuff like that and pharmaceutical drug
[02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:34.820]  stores are actually completely fake so this is just one investigation that
[02:34:34.820 --> 02:34:41.100]  lasted two months they found 2,500 tons of completely fraudulent fake food and
[02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:45.220]  people are thinking that they're getting nutritious items or counting their
[02:34:45.220 --> 02:34:49.420]  calories everything it turns out that in many cases you're not even eating what
[02:34:49.420 --> 02:34:53.140]  you think you are let alone trying to avoid the additives and everything which
[02:34:53.140 --> 02:34:56.820]  just blows my mind and highlights everything we continue to talk about to
[02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:59.780]  know what you're actually getting every single time absolutely yeah we talk
[02:34:59.780 --> 02:35:02.820]  about this vaccine thing and a lot of people will lecture us on you know well
[02:35:02.820 --> 02:35:06.340]  this is how vaccines work you know they they create a response in the body and
[02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:09.340]  the body creates antibodies I think was we're not talking about that we're
[02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:14.180]  talking about the fast food french fries that are not simply potatoes if they
[02:35:14.180 --> 02:35:17.060]  even have potatoes in them because they've added all kinds of preservatives
[02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:20.260]  to them they've added some of the ingredients to silly putty or whatever
[02:35:20.260 --> 02:35:24.260]  you've got the situation that we talked about covered on the news in Iceland
[02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:30.100]  where McDonald's shut down in Iceland in 2009 on the last day a guy went in and
[02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:34.100]  bought a cheeseburger and fries he's had it under a glass container you can watch
[02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:37.900]  a live stream of that internet it hasn't changed in appearance now for six
[02:35:37.900 --> 02:35:42.700]  years so I you know we're not talking about you know it's all about the the
[02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:46.660]  full spectrum we even when we talk about vaccines we're talking about what has
[02:35:46.660 --> 02:35:49.900]  been added to them or doing them in combination I mean a lot of different
[02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:53.340]  aspects of it it's not just as simple as like well you know this is food that
[02:35:53.340 --> 02:35:57.820]  food is used by your body to build bones and he's like no there's other stuff in
[02:35:57.820 --> 02:36:01.380]  the food as well even if it is food exactly and I want to go through the
[02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:05.780]  list of top items that have been found to be completely counterfeit number one
[02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:10.740]  is seafood number two is mineral water three dietary supplements with the herbs
[02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:14.180]  that aren't actually in the supplement they find it necessary to fake water
[02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:18.220]  absolutely well it's big business because they can just take tap water and
[02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:21.660]  dump it in a bottle of water usually plastic full of BPA and sell it for
[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:26.500]  $3 you know it's a total empire mozzarella obviously from Italy that
[02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:31.820]  was a big issue pharmaceutical drugs so you think you're taking Viagra but
[02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:35.300]  you're actually taking a sugar pill or there's numerous scheme systems that
[02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:38.180]  get shut down online every year where they give you actually arsenic or
[02:36:38.180 --> 02:36:43.340]  something terrible like that eggs dried fruit and cooking oil and you might say
[02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:48.140]  well there's no way we can actually do anything about this but the director for
[02:36:48.140 --> 02:36:52.960]  the food regulation companies he said he went out and said in an article with
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:57.260]  Time Magazine that the answer is to actually eat organic and natural food
[02:36:57.260 --> 02:37:01.340]  products and you might be wondering well why is that it's because these
[02:37:01.340 --> 02:37:05.380]  counterfeiters from you know Thailand and everything what they do is they go
[02:37:05.380 --> 02:37:09.060]  off to the big corporate brand names because there's just so much out there
[02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:12.340]  you know there's let's say coca-cola or something there's so much coca-cola out
[02:37:12.340 --> 02:37:15.180]  there that it's impossible to actually test and screen all of the coca-cola
[02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:19.300]  brands and everything like that we see that in China they they go in and
[02:37:19.300 --> 02:37:23.020]  they'll reproduce somebody's brand very precisely and then put garbage in it
[02:37:23.020 --> 02:37:26.660]  which actually creates liability for the companies they were having some
[02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:30.460]  automobile automotive breaks that they went in basically instead of it being
[02:37:30.460 --> 02:37:33.660]  breaks it was just paper people buying this and putting it on their car because
[02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:37.100]  the packaging looked the same the product looked at the same but it was
[02:37:37.100 --> 02:37:40.820]  nothing but paper and then when they're they had a car accident because these
[02:37:40.820 --> 02:37:45.980]  faulty breaks they sue the the real manufacturer of this which they thought
[02:37:45.980 --> 02:37:48.900]  they were buying they thought they got a defective product from these other
[02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:52.940]  people it's really rampant exactly so they just take over this corporate food
[02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:56.260]  system until they take advantage of it but if you're buying actually local
[02:37:56.260 --> 02:38:00.100]  organic quality foods you're not going to experience this and it reminds me of
[02:38:00.100 --> 02:38:04.220]  how you did an amazing report on this McDonald's some economists say that
[02:38:04.220 --> 02:38:07.780]  they could go bankrupt within the next five to ten years isn't that amazing
[02:38:07.780 --> 02:38:12.620]  it's because people don't want fake food anymore yeah they are not settling for
[02:38:12.620 --> 02:38:16.940]  it they're saying I'm absolutely not going to risk getting any freeze bottles
[02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:20.500]  I'm not going to risk getting some of these ingredients I'd like to talk about
[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:24.500]  that are in many common McDonald's food items well because that's a point of
[02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:28.540]  fake to food to that's a fake form of food it comes out of the point you got
[02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:32.500]  to trust your source you know we try to get these independent third parties
[02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:37.460]  whether it's government or it's an independent watchdog agency to to vet
[02:38:37.460 --> 02:38:41.460]  the things that we're buying to see if they're safe to see if it's authentic
[02:38:41.460 --> 02:38:45.260]  or whatever that's why I think so many times these large corporations will make
[02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:51.140]  the calculation that hey I can save a penny or two if I throw this synthetic
[02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:56.260]  dangerous substance in here to give me a little bit longer shelf life and they'll
[02:38:56.260 --> 02:38:59.140]  make that calculation because they're selling it in such large quantity it
[02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:03.020]  makes a difference then whereas if you work with a local business I go to a
[02:39:03.020 --> 02:39:06.400]  local restaurant or something I'm thinking they're not as likely to
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:09.500]  adulterate their products in a dangerous way to save a couple of pennies
[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:11.580]  because it simply isn't going to be worth it for them for the large
[02:39:11.580 --> 02:39:14.980]  corporations it may be a calculation that somebody says we'll go with that
[02:39:14.980 --> 02:39:19.660]  risk it's exactly right two pennies to McDonald's per ingredient is a big big
[02:39:19.660 --> 02:39:23.140]  big deal that's right and that goes back to why I think they're failing I mean
[02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:27.020]  look at this business insider report that McDonald's worldwide sales at
[02:39:27.020 --> 02:39:33.860]  restaurants fell 2.2% just last month okay so what we're seeing is a decline in
[02:39:33.860 --> 02:39:36.660]  McDonald's and there's numerous reasons for that but ultimately people don't
[02:39:36.660 --> 02:39:40.780]  want to eat the garbage anymore and they could have five ten years ago or when
[02:39:40.780 --> 02:39:44.100]  supersized me came out gotten rid of some of these ingredients I'm gonna talk
[02:39:44.100 --> 02:39:47.820]  about but they did it because a matter of a few cents for them is a matter of
[02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:51.780]  millions of dollars in their overall conglomerate if they were smart in my
[02:39:51.780 --> 02:39:55.460]  opinion they would have removed these ingredients immediately because that's
[02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:58.660]  what they keep getting flack for such as the fact they have it's really kind of
[02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:01.900]  in their business model you know because they do need to put this these
[02:40:01.900 --> 02:40:05.020]  preservatives these artificial chemicals in there so that they've got a very very
[02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:09.180]  long shelf life they don't have I mean there's so there's there's even organic
[02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:13.300]  fast food places now you know they don't have to do any of this if they want to
[02:40:13.300 --> 02:40:18.180]  make you know money off of people getting sick and dying they can do this you
[02:40:18.180 --> 02:40:21.220]  know but if they want to cut their profits by point zero zero two percent and
[02:40:21.220 --> 02:40:25.460]  maybe have some alternatives yeah or fund some options some research there are
[02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:29.460]  organic preservatives you know but I mean they have breast implant chemicals in
[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:33.340]  their chicken nuggets according to some of these reports the San Francisco gate
[02:40:33.340 --> 02:40:37.660]  it's a chemical that's used in silicon breast implants and silly putty and the
[02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:41.660]  San Francisco gate reports the fast food chain makes this popular menu item
[02:40:41.660 --> 02:40:47.420]  with a chemical preservative TB HQ a petroleum based product and that's was
[02:40:47.420 --> 02:40:51.700]  at that point in the chicken McNuggets and they have synthetic laxatives of with
[02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:56.660]  the Wendy's frosty contained in the coffee toffee twisted frosty a laxative
[02:40:56.660 --> 02:41:01.100]  chemical an electronic cigarette filler known as propylene glycol is among the
[02:41:01.100 --> 02:41:06.540]  25 new ingredients 25 new ingredients that make up the special frosty says to
[02:41:06.540 --> 02:41:10.420]  be clear this is a chemical link to a host of conditions including neurotoxic
[02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:15.140]  effects in children blood brain blood brain barrier issues and much more it's
[02:41:15.140 --> 02:41:21.180]  even illegal in cat food well so okay for Americans and they have a different
[02:41:21.180 --> 02:41:24.980]  standard for Americans that they sell to us and things that they won't put in
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:27.900]  in other parts and even cigarette companies are trying to remove
[02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:31.420]  propylene glycol now but they're just putting it in frosties well you know
[02:41:31.420 --> 02:41:34.460]  there's a lot of awareness of that we've had food Bay Bond several times she's
[02:41:34.460 --> 02:41:38.820]  had a lot of response from people once she focuses on some of these
[02:41:38.820 --> 02:41:42.780]  ingredients that the large corporations will will back off of it when the light
[02:41:42.780 --> 02:41:47.940]  is shown on it that's why it surprises me this disconnect over vaccines for
[02:41:47.940 --> 02:41:53.420]  example the people can't they understand the issue of additives and food and
[02:41:53.420 --> 02:41:57.260]  there's a large building movement of that where people want to get this stuff
[02:41:57.260 --> 02:42:02.020]  as like don't put cancer-causing stuff in my soft drink because it changes the
[02:42:02.020 --> 02:42:05.980]  color to brown I that's not important to me I would rather have it without the
[02:42:05.980 --> 02:42:09.700]  color without the cancer-causing chemicals but they won't say that about
[02:42:09.700 --> 02:42:12.940]  vaccines I they just don't get the message what it's about and that's the
[02:42:12.940 --> 02:42:16.500]  thing the two biggest articles in my experience writing probably 3000 articles
[02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:21.300]  total are food item ingredients like this like five you know four worst fast
[02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:25.260]  food ingredients they don't tell you about right or vaccine additives and
[02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:29.100]  vaccine effects those are the two biggest shares factors for articles I
[02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:32.820]  mean I'm talking about 20,000 Facebook shares in two hours in two hours on
[02:42:32.820 --> 02:42:36.580]  some of these or a million Facebook shares one of the articles about GMOs
[02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:41.780]  being burned got 980,000 shares or something insane like that people know
[02:42:41.780 --> 02:42:45.100]  people are aware of this I mean they get millions and millions of views and
[02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:48.540]  people are obsessed with this type of stuff so you would say as a corporation
[02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:52.820]  why are they not responding to that it's because they can still get away with it
[02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:56.300]  if we force them to not get away with it we actually take the action and go
[02:42:56.300 --> 02:42:58.740]  there and don't buy the crap which it looks like we're doing is McDonald's
[02:42:58.740 --> 02:43:02.060]  is just plummeting down and economists are freaking out saying it's not a
[02:43:02.060 --> 02:43:06.220]  blue chip anymore get away from it well that's actually taking a change when
[02:43:06.220 --> 02:43:10.780]  people say hey there's yoga mat chemicals in that fast food I mean
[02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:15.380]  literally it was if you if you use this chemical that they use in some of these
[02:43:15.380 --> 02:43:20.380]  McDonald's products in Singapore it could be up to a $450,000 fine in 15
[02:43:20.380 --> 02:43:23.940]  years in prison according to these reports that's very interesting you know I
[02:43:23.940 --> 02:43:27.740]  think it is very important what we've seen happen again we're talking about the
[02:43:27.740 --> 02:43:30.700]  food babe as we put these other things out there's people understand what this
[02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:35.980]  is they're exercising their market power that's why we see McDonald's sales
[02:43:35.980 --> 02:43:40.660]  going down they're exercising their informed choice their informed consent
[02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:45.860]  that's the way you get this stuff out of the vaccines you don't just ignore it
[02:43:45.860 --> 02:43:49.980]  and tell people shut up and take it you know it's almost like forcing us to go
[02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:53.820]  to McDonald's and and you know eat there three times a day or whatever I mean
[02:43:53.820 --> 02:43:58.900]  it's you've got to approach this I think from it is far more effective to
[02:43:58.900 --> 02:44:03.420]  approach it from an education and market standpoint than it is to come in and
[02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:08.540]  even put fines in jail terms on this stuff because we see so many times these
[02:44:08.540 --> 02:44:12.780]  regulatory agencies get captured by the corporations that's a large part of what
[02:44:12.780 --> 02:44:16.660]  the problem is with big pharmaceuticals is that they've captured these
[02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:21.700]  government agencies the FDA and captured the CDC so that the real
[02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:25.820]  information is not not going out I think we are achieving victory I think across
[02:44:25.820 --> 02:44:29.540]  the board I mean we're seeing there's a reason let's say this there's a reason
[02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:35.180]  that 96% of Monsanto shareholders do not want GMO labeling there was a poll of
[02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:39.180]  GMO shareholders in Monsanto they do not want GMO labeling
[02:44:39.180 --> 02:44:42.660]  McDonald's does not want GMO labeling none of these people want you'd
[02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:46.900]  actually know what you're getting you're right they're winning by hypnosis
[02:44:46.900 --> 02:44:50.500]  people are walking into McDonald's they don't know what they're eating or they
[02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:53.380]  they think they do they read the stuff but they don't actually grasp the idea
[02:44:53.380 --> 02:44:56.300]  that when they wake up in the morning they feel like crap it's because what
[02:44:56.300 --> 02:44:59.540]  they're putting into their bodies so we are achieving major victor I believe I
[02:44:59.540 --> 02:45:02.540]  mean look at how many people are reading all these reports on info wars and
[02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:04.900]  everywhere else they were just reading it every single day millions and millions
[02:45:04.900 --> 02:45:08.180]  of people that are super concerned well it is an information one and I think
[02:45:08.180 --> 02:45:11.220]  that's why the government is so desperate to get control of the internet
[02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:14.260]  and to shut this down I think it's they realize that they're losing the
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:17.740]  information war I think that if we get people informed they're going to
[02:45:17.740 --> 02:45:21.340]  withdraw their consent I think we'll see some market changes that will drive not
[02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:24.860]  only what we eat but drive some of the medicines as well thank you so much
[02:45:24.860 --> 02:45:30.900]  Anthony let's go to Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the UK right now Paul
[02:45:30.900 --> 02:45:35.860]  hey David good to be back hi thank you for joining us tell us a little bit about
[02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:41.700]  your article here about feminists and not talking about Muslim rape epidemic
[02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:46.420]  the sweeping Europe well this is a point we've pushed over and over again David
[02:45:46.420 --> 02:45:50.260]  and I've got another article coming out soon which is top feminist calls for
[02:45:50.260 --> 02:45:54.300]  collectivist revolution and we emphasize this over and over again which is the
[02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:58.940]  point that feminists don't care about genuine women's rights issues third wave
[02:45:58.940 --> 02:46:04.260]  feminism is all about authoritarianism and social engineering so now this top
[02:46:04.260 --> 02:46:09.380]  feminist with an organization called one billion rising backed by the United
[02:46:09.380 --> 02:46:13.020]  Nations and that's important to emphasize these feminists aren't just
[02:46:13.020 --> 02:46:17.380]  whining on Twitter or Tumblr they're backed by millions and millions of
[02:46:17.380 --> 02:46:21.580]  dollars in foundation and corporate funding so she's the head of an
[02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:25.820]  organization that seeks to end rape and sexual violence against women she
[02:46:25.820 --> 02:46:29.740]  doesn't talk about the fact that rape and sexual violence against women is
[02:46:29.740 --> 02:46:34.540]  endemic within the Islamic community which we'll get on to but she basically
[02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:41.020]  got up in front of a crowd in New York a couple of weeks ago and gave a speech in
[02:46:41.020 --> 02:46:47.060]  which she talked about how feminism was about creating a collectivist revolution
[02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:52.580]  and that she was proud to say quote American individualism is dead and
[02:46:52.580 --> 02:46:57.700]  global solidarity is alive and on the rise so it was basically kind of a
[02:46:57.700 --> 02:47:02.700]  creepy communist cult initiation meeting for feminists who again are being backed
[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:07.340]  by millions of millions of dollars in corporate funding and again it goes back
[02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:13.060]  to feminism being completely opposed to classical liberalism which was the you
[02:47:13.060 --> 02:47:18.100]  know the moral worth of the individual she's coming out and brazenly stating
[02:47:18.100 --> 02:47:23.380]  that feminism is determined to destroy individualism destroy free market
[02:47:23.380 --> 02:47:28.460]  capitalism and replace it with a collectivist revolution so again
[02:47:28.460 --> 02:47:32.900]  feminism is not about genuine women's rights issues it's about social
[02:47:32.900 --> 02:47:37.060]  engineering and advancing this authoritarian agenda yeah and there
[02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:42.500]  seems to be a very selective outrage over certain things as you point out the
[02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:47.340]  feminists are not looking at what is happening to women in fundamental
[02:47:47.340 --> 02:47:53.460]  Islamic countries just as we see that there's no concern about the regular
[02:47:53.460 --> 02:47:57.420]  Saudi beheadings as we find out the other day at the rate that they've been
[02:47:57.420 --> 02:48:01.900]  beheading people they're going to get to the number of Christians that were
[02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:08.060]  beheaded this last week if that was in fact an authentic video 20 some odd
[02:48:08.060 --> 02:48:14.260]  Christians beheaded that would happen in less than 90 days in Saudi Arabia yet
[02:48:14.260 --> 02:48:20.140]  we're supposed to go to war put boots on the ground wipe out ISIS but we're
[02:48:20.140 --> 02:48:23.820]  allied with people who do that on a regular basis and that's that's what
[02:48:23.820 --> 02:48:27.980]  we're seeing here with this kind of hypocrisy with the feminists that's
[02:48:27.980 --> 02:48:32.620]  right and you know Saudi Arabia passed a law which characterized female drivers
[02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:36.340]  as terrorists you didn't hear any feminist outrage about it you know they
[02:48:36.340 --> 02:48:40.420]  were too busy complaining about Matt Taylor the Comet scientist quote sexist
[02:48:40.420 --> 02:48:44.780]  sure that's what they hop on about they hopped on about the college rape
[02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:49.620]  scandal for years claiming that one in five female students in the United
[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:53.580]  States are victims of sexual assault we got the Justice Department numbers in
[02:48:53.580 --> 02:49:01.540]  2014 December which showed the actually 0.03 in five of victims of sexual
[02:49:01.540 --> 02:49:07.180]  assault on US college campuses wow and female students are 25% less likely to
[02:49:07.180 --> 02:49:11.820]  be right than non-students and yet they hopped on about that for years it was a
[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:17.540]  contrived myth it blew up in their faces with the University of Virginia rape
[02:49:17.540 --> 02:49:21.140]  scandal which was completely debunked and then we can get on to what's
[02:49:21.140 --> 02:49:25.540]  actually happening with real rape scandals after the break in Sweden
[02:49:25.540 --> 02:49:28.660]  Denmark Norway and other European countries yeah they throw these
[02:49:28.660 --> 02:49:32.540]  statistics out there and just like we see happening with a vaccine thing that
[02:49:32.540 --> 02:49:37.220]  the CDC can send you continues to tell everybody hey these vaccines are 99%
[02:49:37.220 --> 02:49:41.620]  effective and yet we saw in the Disneyland outbreak that 14% of the
[02:49:41.620 --> 02:49:44.460]  people had been vaccinated the year before they had an outbreak in California
[02:49:44.460 --> 02:49:48.940]  18% of the people had been vaccinated back in 1987 according to the and if you
[02:49:48.940 --> 02:49:53.380]  think well maybe that's just a small population if you go back to 1987 look
[02:49:53.380 --> 02:49:58.940]  at the CDC's own numbers 52% of the people who came down with measles had
[02:49:58.940 --> 02:50:04.700]  been vaccinated yet they still put this story out there that it's 99% effective
[02:50:04.700 --> 02:50:08.900]  they continue to persist in these kind of statistics to support their view
[02:50:08.900 --> 02:50:12.820]  that's why you always need to go back and check to see where did these numbers
[02:50:12.820 --> 02:50:17.740]  come from yeah because I mean they can contrive a whole narrative based on
[02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:21.100]  completely fraudulent numbers and only later they come out and prove the
[02:50:21.100 --> 02:50:25.900]  opposite case but again there's a huge article up on info was feminist new on
[02:50:25.900 --> 02:50:30.700]  Muslim rape epidemic sweeping Europe this is a heavily documented article
[02:50:30.700 --> 02:50:34.620]  it's full of videos and hyperlinks to government documents police reports
[02:50:34.620 --> 02:50:39.220]  about how this epidemic of Muslim abuse is sweeping the continent so we'll get
[02:50:39.220 --> 02:50:43.780]  onto it yes that's an article up on info wars.com we have Paul Joseph Watson

[02:54:08.780 --> 02:54:13.380]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we have joining us from
[02:54:13.380 --> 02:54:17.500]  the UK Paul Joseph Watson we've been talking about his story feminist mute on
[02:54:17.500 --> 02:54:21.300]  Muslim rape up in the epidemic sweeping Europe and of course the bottom of this
[02:54:21.300 --> 02:54:27.820]  is multiculturalism it simply isn't politically correct to talk about what's
[02:54:27.820 --> 02:54:31.620]  going on in European countries as you point out in your article here Paul you
[02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:34.900]  say that in Denmark for example crime rates broken down by nationality show
[02:54:34.900 --> 02:54:39.020]  individuals from Muslim countries make up eight of the top nine places on the
[02:54:39.020 --> 02:54:45.420]  list in 2012 sexual assaults were almost ten times more common amongst those who
[02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:49.940]  were immigrants than with those of Danish citizenship yet we can't talk about
[02:54:49.940 --> 02:54:53.620]  that because it's not politically correct we've been beaten down into
[02:54:53.620 --> 02:54:58.940]  submission with multiculturalism well that's right and I mean this is the
[02:54:58.940 --> 02:55:02.740]  heart of feminism is rampant hypocrisy because they don't talk about this like
[02:55:02.740 --> 02:55:05.300]  the woman I was just talking about before the break you know has an
[02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:09.300]  organization devoted to ending sexual violence and rape against women yet
[02:55:09.300 --> 02:55:13.700]  refuses to address this problem you know we had a case in Rotherham in England
[02:55:13.700 --> 02:55:19.340]  where from 1997 onwards for nearly 15 years over a thousand young girls were
[02:55:19.340 --> 02:55:25.220]  sexually abused beaten and trafficked by primarily Pakistani Muslim men and the
[02:55:25.220 --> 02:55:29.980]  Labour government in Rotherham covered up and ignored that scandal ignored the
[02:55:29.980 --> 02:55:33.660]  reports that were pouring in because they feared being characterized as
[02:55:33.660 --> 02:55:38.340]  politically incorrect and racist so this is where political correctness again
[02:55:38.340 --> 02:55:43.100]  poses a direct threat to the just functioning of a free society and as
[02:55:43.100 --> 02:55:46.380]  you mentioned you can go through the other countries and again to underscore
[02:55:46.380 --> 02:55:50.940]  the point you know most sober-minded Muslims would agree that this is a
[02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:56.060]  problem this is a crisis that needs to be addressed just as most Catholics would
[02:55:56.060 --> 02:56:00.860]  agree that the Vatican pedophile scandal needed to be addressed you know this
[02:56:00.860 --> 02:56:04.620]  isn't about demonizing Muslims it's about calling out this authoritarian
[02:56:04.620 --> 02:56:09.740]  political correctness that prevents these reports from being taken seriously by
[02:56:09.740 --> 02:56:13.740]  governments in these European countries by the media because they're more
[02:56:13.740 --> 02:56:19.900]  concerned with protecting multicultural sensitivities whereby to the point you
[02:56:19.900 --> 02:56:23.340]  know you've got Lars Heddergaard in Denmark who put out the report with the
[02:56:23.340 --> 02:56:27.340]  stats that you just mentioned he was actually brought up under hate speech
[02:56:27.340 --> 02:56:32.300]  laws for simply talking about the issue so they're treating people who bring
[02:56:32.300 --> 02:56:36.820]  attention to it in some cases worse than the actual rapists and we need to
[02:56:36.820 --> 02:56:41.220]  understand and we need to understand too that multiculturalism is really the tool
[02:56:41.220 --> 02:56:48.260]  to bring about global governance they want to destroy cultures and sovereign
[02:56:48.260 --> 02:56:51.380]  nations and the way they do it is with open immigration as they're doing here
[02:56:51.380 --> 02:56:55.140]  in the United States to have a different way of doing it slightly in Europe
[02:56:55.140 --> 02:57:00.900]  nevertheless it is all about breaking down the cultures the continuity of
[02:57:00.900 --> 02:57:04.180]  government if you will I didn't like to use that phrase because that's something
[02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:08.300]  used by government to justify a lot of a lot of very bad things but the
[02:57:08.300 --> 02:57:13.820]  continuity of culture of a people to to break that down to mix the groups
[02:57:13.820 --> 02:57:17.900]  together and to set them apart against each other that's all part of this
[02:57:17.900 --> 02:57:21.380]  multicultural so instead of just bringing this in and saying we want to
[02:57:21.380 --> 02:57:25.380]  uplift these cultures actually using it to destroy indigenous cultures aren't
[02:57:25.380 --> 02:57:29.900]  they yeah and they're using it as a tool of political repression they're playing
[02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:33.980]  one culture off against each other you know even world leaders like Cameron and
[02:57:33.980 --> 02:57:38.740]  Merkel have admitted that multiculturalism has failed it's a failed experiment so
[02:57:38.740 --> 02:57:43.980]  for example since 1975 in Sweden when they open their doors to multiculturalism
[02:57:43.980 --> 02:57:52.460]  the rapes skyrocketed since that time by 1472 percent so now 77 percent of
[02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:57.900]  rapes committed in Sweden are carried out by foreign immigrants mainly muslims
[02:57:57.900 --> 02:58:03.100]  because under Islam they see women as second-class citizens but the people in
[02:58:03.100 --> 02:58:07.340]  Sweden who are drawing attention to this are being characterized as racist
[02:58:07.340 --> 02:58:11.220]  thought criminals merely for trying to highlight the fact that this is a major
[02:58:11.220 --> 02:58:15.940]  problem yeah they have a real problem that's why we see the rise of UKIP and
[02:58:15.940 --> 02:58:19.260]  a lot of these other parties that want independence from the European Union they
[02:58:19.260 --> 02:58:22.380]  understand how this is being sold to them how they're taking down their
[02:58:22.380 --> 02:58:25.820]  countries and yet these standard responses that they're xenophobic that
[02:58:25.820 --> 02:58:29.860]  they're racist we're out of time for today thank you for joining us Paul
