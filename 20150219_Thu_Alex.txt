[00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.560]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.322]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:10.083]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:11.665]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:13.226]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:17.410]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.473]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:36.350]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.971]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:37.851]  I'll be your host today.
[00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:41.194]  Alex will be joining us in the next segment briefly.
[00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:45.238]  This is February the 19th, 2015.
[00:00:45.238 --> 00:00:50.803]  And everybody is talking about the coming of artificial intelligence.
[00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:53.765]  Is it going to be an existential threat to humanity?
[00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:55.487]  Is it going to wipe out humanity?
[00:00:55.487 --> 00:00:59.490]  Of course, we've had the utopian visions of Ray Kurzweil.
[00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:05.475]  But we're going to be talking today to one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence, Dr. Hugo DeGaris.
[00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:15.681]  I would call his work that he put out about ten years ago, The Artelect War, I would call it a seminal step in the discussion as to where we're going with artificial intelligence.
[00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:23.146]  Of course, he believes that it's not only probable, but inevitable, that we are going to have super-intelligent machines.
[00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:25.128]  That we begin it, that they finish it.
[00:01:25.128 --> 00:01:29.911]  Think of Terminator, where the Skynet became self-aware, and then Malevolent.
[00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:36.656]  He is definitely in the dystopian camp, as we have also seen with Elon Musk, with Stephen Hawkins.
[00:01:36.656 --> 00:01:42.441]  Even Bill Gates came out and said he was concerned about it, even though Microsoft was saying, no, we're not concerned about it at all.
[00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:43.482]  It's just fine.
[00:01:43.482 --> 00:01:45.383]  And of course, Ray Kurzweil is working with Google.
[00:01:45.383 --> 00:01:54.451]  They've been busy acquiring all of the key technologies, the key companies that are developing the technologies that would be used for artificial robots.
[00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:59.335]  And I think even more troubling in the near term is a war between
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.423]  And over, not over artificial intelligence, whether it's going to be developed.
[00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:07.645]  Of course, that's the central premise of Dr. DeGaris.
[00:02:07.645 --> 00:02:08.946]  We're going to talk to him about that.
[00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:18.193]  What concerns me so much is that it's going to be used by the elites, that it won't be necessarily a war over artificial intelligence, but a war using artificial intelligence.
[00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:22.597]  And we keep seeing this come up over and over again throughout these DARPA projects.
[00:02:22.597 --> 00:02:26.420]  So we're going to talk to him about what the state of the art is right now with artificial intelligence.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:41.145]  We're going to have him make his case for the inevitability of not only artificial intelligence, the Artilex as he calls them, but also of a conflict between what he calls two groups of humans, the Cosmos and the Terrans.
[00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:50.249]  Not as terrorists, but people who are concerned about humanity, about the Earth, who want to somehow get control of this technology he believes is going to get out of control.
[00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:52.390]  And I think one of the most interesting things about this
[00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.351]  Is what I would call the paradox that you see in his work.
[00:02:56.351 --> 00:03:01.993]  He's drawn to do this, even though he believes it's going to result in the extinction of humanity.
[00:03:01.993 --> 00:03:06.154]  Of course, we're also going to be joined in the third hour by Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:09.255]  We'll talk to him about some breaking news stories.
[00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.715]  There's a lot happening today.
[00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:16.177]  We've got Obama's secret internet regulations are starting to get some scrutiny.
[00:03:16.177 --> 00:03:19.018]  Of course, everything that the government does is secret.
[00:03:19.418 --> 00:03:23.801]  Whether it's Obamacare that we have to pass so we can find out what's in it.
[00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:30.344]  Just like we see with the Transatlantic Partnership, the Trans-Pacific Partnership being negotiated in secret by corporate lobbyists.
[00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:36.028]  And of course, our representatives, our senators, our congressmen are not allowed to see what that is.
[00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:38.909]  It's going to be rushed through with a fast track.
[00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.711]  They'll be presented with a large bill just as they were with Obamacare.
[00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:44.715]  No time to read it, not allowed to change it.
[00:03:44.715 --> 00:03:49.723]  We're seeing that that is happening now with the bureaucracy within our own country, with the FCC.
[00:03:49.723 --> 00:03:56.213]  The FEC is also talking about making new vast regulations that are going to regulate content of political speech.
[00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:02.143]  I guess we're going to have mandatory vaccines where we have to take the vaccines before we can find out what's in them as well.
[00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:08.327]  There's nothing but contempt from the elites in terms of what we should know about what's going on.
[00:04:08.327 --> 00:04:16.771]  And of course, there's not only DARPA, but there's also an agency called IARPA, the Intelligence Advanced Research Project.
[00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:30.764]  And they're busy working on predictions in terms of using artificial intelligence, as we talk about it in the broader sense, using that to predict societal trends, to predict possible conflicts, civil war, disease, outbreaks.
[00:04:30.764 --> 00:04:31.844]  This is what they're doing.
[00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:33.824]  They're wargaming the future.
[00:04:33.824 --> 00:04:35.605]  They're looking at the possibilities.
[00:04:35.605 --> 00:04:37.945]  That's what we're going to do today with Hugo DeGaris.
[00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:41.786]  If they're wargaming this, don't you think you should be concerned about what's going to happen in the future?
[00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:42.886]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:03.059]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:07.341]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:09.122]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:09.122 --> 00:05:14.465]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:16.986]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:05:16.986 --> 00:05:18.127]  But for how long?
[00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:20.348]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:05:20.348 --> 00:05:24.770]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.572]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:32.462]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:32.462 --> 00:05:40.708]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:46.112]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:48.633]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:24.488]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.488 --> 00:08:26.309]  It is Thursday, February 19, 2015.
[00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:29.391]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:34.275]  We're about to go live to David Knight at the Infowars.com News Center in Austin.
[00:08:34.275 --> 00:08:39.739]  I'm finishing up some family illness issues that should be complete in the next few days.
[00:08:40.834 --> 00:08:46.779]  There is so much happening in the world right now that it's mind-blowing.
[00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:48.180]  That's why you're all tuning in.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.502]  That's why I'm here.
[00:08:50.502 --> 00:08:51.983]  It's incredible.
[00:08:51.983 --> 00:09:02.172]  We've got a guest coming up later in the broadcast who's one of the world experts on AI and who is predicting there will be a war between artificial intelligence and humans.
[00:09:02.172 --> 00:09:04.193]  And that's what the Pentagon and many other experts believe.
[00:09:04.193 --> 00:09:08.257]  So they're racing to build the AI first, hoping that they'll control it.
[00:09:08.817 --> 00:09:10.998]  We're living in 2015.
[00:09:10.998 --> 00:09:14.240]  DARPA's coming out saying, yes, people will have brain chips.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.501]  Yes, we will merge the machines by 2030.
[00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:18.382]  Notice they were saying 2045.
[00:09:18.382 --> 00:09:20.503]  Now they're saying 2030.
[00:09:20.503 --> 00:09:21.364]  Next they'll say 2020.
[00:09:21.364 --> 00:09:23.165]  Everything's being compressed.
[00:09:23.165 --> 00:09:25.306]  Everything's being accelerated.
[00:09:25.306 --> 00:09:28.268]  And David Dyke has done a lot of research on this.
[00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:32.150]  So coming up, you'll definitely want to get that whole analysis.
[00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.811]  Also, if you visit InfoWars.com,
[00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:37.175]  You notice that Italy is having to put troops on the street.
[00:09:37.175 --> 00:09:38.938]  Kurt Nimmo has an article about that.
[00:09:38.938 --> 00:09:45.187]  Because ISIS now says they're going to flood Europe with 500,000 immigrants as psychological operation.
[00:09:46.095 --> 00:09:54.463]  Now when you pull back and realize this is Saudi Arabia doing this and working with Obama and the globalists, it is a psychological operation to create the clash of civilizations.
[00:09:54.463 --> 00:09:58.307]  Then radical Islam has given the whole Middle East, Africa and much of Asia.
[00:09:58.307 --> 00:10:08.918]  The globalists are able to turn us into a police state in the bargain that Saudi Arabia carries out to launch more terror attacks here in America, just like the 28 pages of the secret report now proves
[00:10:09.378 --> 00:10:13.726]  That Saudi Arabia was quarterbacking the 9-11 attacks.
[00:10:13.726 --> 00:10:15.308]  So we see all this coming into view.
[00:10:15.308 --> 00:10:16.951]  We see Obama with the summit.
[00:10:17.807 --> 00:10:25.893]  He's openly saying that this is all about extremists, period, and he won't even call Islamists as radicals extremists.
[00:10:25.893 --> 00:10:27.794]  Now, I don't want to kill the Muslims.
[00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:32.918]  I have a lot of friends from college and high school that are Muslims, that are nice, hard-working entrepreneurs, and good people.
[00:10:32.918 --> 00:10:36.500]  And so the cliché that all the Muslims want to blow us up, I don't agree with that.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:46.167]  I'm not Islamophobic, but I am radical Islamophobic, and that is becoming the dominant form of Islam by the sword it is taking over, just as Saudi Arabia
[00:10:47.228 --> 00:10:48.949]  took over from 1901 to 1932.
[00:10:48.949 --> 00:11:00.477]  They had 200 square miles, and 30 years later, they had Syria, Saudi Arabia, and a whole bunch of other areas, with British intelligence financing them.
[00:11:00.477 --> 00:11:06.742]  So this thing of using Al-Qaeda to attack the Russians, and Al-Qaeda to attack us on 9-11, and all this, it's just a repeat.
[00:11:06.742 --> 00:11:09.443]  They're a secret army, a globalist cutout.
[00:11:09.443 --> 00:11:13.406]  Now, the idiots on the ground fighting and killing are just pirates that want to rape and murder.
[00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:14.267]  They're psychopaths.
[00:11:15.563 --> 00:11:17.103]  They're delusional.
[00:11:17.103 --> 00:11:20.564]  They're in the news facing Jesus, the prophet, will come back and fight for them.
[00:11:20.564 --> 00:11:23.565]  They think Jesus is a prophet, not the son of God.
[00:11:23.565 --> 00:11:27.185]  All of this is social engineering on a mass scale.
[00:11:27.185 --> 00:11:27.745]  All of this.
[00:11:27.745 --> 00:11:37.588]  Notice that it's Western governments flooding our countries, not just with Muslims, but with Muslims from the most radical areas, and then saying, race for terror attack, we've got to now take your freedoms.
[00:11:37.588 --> 00:11:43.069]  But then meanwhile, the summits are all about gun owners and conservatives, and that's the Justice Department's main focus.
[00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:44.229]  We already know this.
[00:11:45.029 --> 00:11:48.332]  InfoWars broke this, as you know, with the MIAC report and other documents.
[00:11:48.332 --> 00:11:51.716]  But now we have to get this out to everyone else who doesn't understand it.
[00:11:51.716 --> 00:11:56.160]  Don't think just because you understand this, other people understand this.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.423]  Also, we need to understand perception.
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:07.607]  Just like they say there's record gun deaths, but gun deaths are down since 1991, 51% FBI's own numbers.
[00:12:07.607 --> 00:12:10.309]  The news is able to show all the gun deaths.
[00:12:10.309 --> 00:12:15.073]  I'm shifting gears right here just into psych control and how they spend things, just to keep our mind on that.
[00:12:15.994 --> 00:12:19.016]  So gun deaths are way down, but they're telling us it's way up.
[00:12:19.016 --> 00:12:27.099]  Just like every day we have articles on Infowars.com, and I've told my writers, continue to do it, showing police killing innocent people, doing horrible things.
[00:12:27.099 --> 00:12:30.141]  But remember, that's actually not up in the statistics.
[00:12:30.141 --> 00:12:32.202]  In fact, in some areas it's down.
[00:12:32.202 --> 00:12:36.624]  Because of media attention, it creates the perception that the police are out of control.
[00:12:37.864 --> 00:12:43.346]  What's out of control is the central government trying to warp the police into something truly evil.
[00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:58.150]  And they're pushing and promoting all this anti-cop stuff to then make the cops basically go into a psychology of only working with the feds and a gang mentality because they feel persecuted instead of us embracing the police and promoting a Bill of Rights culture.
[00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.531]  That's what the enemy doesn't want.
[00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:02.972]  So we post the articles of the wrongdoing so the bad cops get in trouble.
[00:13:02.972 --> 00:13:06.573]  But that's only to clean up the police departments, not to demonize the police in general.
[00:13:07.473 --> 00:13:13.135]  Local government, local control, farmers markets, Buy America, this is all the answer.
[00:13:13.135 --> 00:13:16.256]  And I'm just skipping around here because there's so much news to cover.
[00:13:16.256 --> 00:13:18.917]  Let's walk over to the computer right now.
[00:13:18.917 --> 00:13:23.138]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Anthony Gucciardi is on camera for me.
[00:13:23.138 --> 00:13:25.659]  Woman calls cops for help against intruders.
[00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:28.520]  Cops show up and shoot her dead.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.661]  Well, yeah, they made a mistake and it's terrible.
[00:13:30.661 --> 00:13:31.361]  It's bad.
[00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:33.662]  That's why she probably needed a gun herself to do it.
[00:13:34.062 --> 00:13:39.227]  The police are there to arrest somebody once they've committed the crime and bring them to justice, to the jury, to us the people.
[00:13:39.227 --> 00:13:43.752]  Italy puts troops on the street in response to Islamic State's psychological warfare route.
[00:13:43.752 --> 00:13:45.093]  ISIS believes Jesus will come.
[00:13:45.093 --> 00:13:48.517]  Ted Cruz, Obama has become an apologist for radical Islamic terrorists.
[00:13:48.517 --> 00:13:49.978]  Absolutely.
[00:13:49.978 --> 00:13:55.363]  Cop beats high school kid so bad even the cop's own department told the family to file a complaint.
[00:13:56.224 --> 00:13:59.808]  Report finds we're eating 2.5 tons of fake food.
[00:13:59.808 --> 00:14:04.633]  Anthony, I want you to get on today, at least for 15 minutes, with Dave and I and cover this.
[00:14:04.633 --> 00:14:08.137]  These articles you write are so huge, we hardly ever cover them.
[00:14:08.137 --> 00:14:08.458]  Look at this.
[00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:11.721]  Hong Kong Chief Executive tells citizens to act more like sheep.
[00:14:11.721 --> 00:14:12.562]  Shocking video.
[00:14:12.562 --> 00:14:14.885]  College students condemned free speech in the First Amendment.
[00:14:15.405 --> 00:14:17.366]  And that's a serious video.
[00:14:17.366 --> 00:14:19.067]  Long form with them doing this.
[00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.249]  So that's basically it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:26.111]  Alex Jones signing off for this news update for this Thursday, the 19th transmission.
[00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:28.753]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:14:28.753 --> 00:14:30.034]  Don't take this show for granted.
[00:14:30.034 --> 00:14:31.335]  The enemy wants to shut it down.
[00:14:31.335 --> 00:14:37.178]  We're growing, but we're in the middle of a major confrontation with the globalists, as everybody is.
[00:14:37.358 --> 00:14:41.401]  Everybody fighting them is being confronted more and more because the enemy knows we're gaining ground.
[00:14:41.401 --> 00:14:44.403]  Please support InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:14:44.403 --> 00:14:45.464]  Continue to buy the products.
[00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:48.026]  Continue to spread the word because you are the power.
[00:14:48.026 --> 00:14:49.227]  You are the people.
[00:14:49.227 --> 00:14:56.812]  You are the wind that God blows out of his lungs to fill the cells of liberty if you decide to be part of this fight.
[00:14:56.812 --> 00:14:58.133]  So join us in history.
[00:14:58.133 --> 00:14:58.713]  It's epic.
[00:14:58.713 --> 00:15:03.197]  I salute you all because if you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:10.753]  Alright, that's Alex Jones with a message recorded earlier, breaking down some of the stories that are coming out today.
[00:15:10.753 --> 00:15:16.901]  We have, as he mentioned at the beginning of the broadcast, we have Dr. Hugo de Geras, a pioneer of artificial intelligence.
[00:15:16.901 --> 00:15:20.406]  And of course, ten years ago, he wrote a book called The Artilect War.
[00:15:21.167 --> 00:15:28.355]  He has a very dystopian view of what may happen with artificial intelligence as someone who knows a great deal about it.
[00:15:28.355 --> 00:15:30.558]  We're going to talk to him today from China.
[00:15:30.558 --> 00:15:35.684]  He has been working up to his retirement in China on an artificial brain project in China.
[00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:38.025]  Pretty much all of the countries are doing it.
[00:15:38.025 --> 00:15:43.729]  That's one of the reasons that he believes, and makes a case for it in his book, is it's essentially a competition.
[00:15:43.729 --> 00:15:48.712]  Just as we had the space gap with Sputnik, we got concerned about that.
[00:15:48.712 --> 00:15:53.956]  Every country is concerned about falling behind militarily in doing the research.
[00:15:53.956 --> 00:15:59.079]  That's what's driving this kind of, I would call it a DARPA kind of madness that we see.
[00:15:59.079 --> 00:16:01.601]  Just yesterday, of course, we had the story
[00:16:02.401 --> 00:16:09.894]  Right out of The Matrix, talking about how DARPA is working on a brain implant to be powered from the spine that would go on the back of your neck.
[00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:17.272]  They would project video directly into your brain bypassing the visual system that your body has.
[00:16:17.272 --> 00:16:23.194]  Today we have a story that's up on Drudge Report about drones being used to seek out arteries in order to prevent heart attacks.
[00:16:23.194 --> 00:16:38.079]  This is nanotechnology, microscopic drones that they would inject into your arteries that would then seek out plaque inside of the arteries and release a drug derived from, they say, a natural protein that repairs inflammation damage in the body.
[00:16:39.028 --> 00:16:42.090]  As I look at this, I think maybe the Amish have the right idea.
[00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:48.656]  I am definitely, as Dr. DeGaris would call it, I'm definitely in the Terran camp.
[00:16:48.656 --> 00:16:49.497]  Not as a terrorist.
[00:16:49.497 --> 00:16:50.397]  That doesn't mean terrorist.
[00:16:50.397 --> 00:16:53.720]  That means Terra as in terra firma.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.420]  Earth.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.121]  Humanity.
[00:16:55.121 --> 00:16:56.541]  That's the side I'm with.
[00:16:56.541 --> 00:17:01.785]  Of course, he sympathizes with that, but he describes himself as a Cosmos.
[00:17:01.785 --> 00:17:09.090]  Someone who feels compelled to create this, what he believes, God-like intelligence that he thinks is not only coming soon,
[00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:15.611]  But is, and not just a high probability, but a certainty he believes that's going to happen.
[00:17:15.611 --> 00:17:27.933]  And I think one of the things we want to talk to him about, besides the timing, besides how this might break out, he has a very, he laid this out ten years ago, how he thought this conflict would play out.
[00:17:27.933 --> 00:17:30.434]  So we want to talk to him about the state of the art in research.
[00:17:30.434 --> 00:17:33.474]  We want to see how he thinks this is going to play out.
[00:17:33.474 --> 00:17:38.655]  But one of the things that I want to focus on, because it has implications for everyone who is a scientist or an engineer.
[00:17:39.415 --> 00:17:42.538]  ...is the ethics of this, because he's very conflicted about this.
[00:17:42.538 --> 00:17:52.107]  He feels compelled to create this god-like intelligence, even though he personally believes that it will likely lead to the extinction of the human race.
[00:17:52.107 --> 00:17:54.209]  There was a story on The Guardian today.
[00:17:54.209 --> 00:18:02.197]  Artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, which he believes is an enabling technology for the kind of development of artificial intelligence that he foresees,
[00:18:02.637 --> 00:18:05.599]  Artificial intelligence and nanotech threaten civilization.
[00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:06.379]  This is the Guardian.
[00:18:06.379 --> 00:18:26.330]  They say in a recent Global Challenges Foundation proposal, they said such extreme intelligences could not easily be controlled either by the groups creating them or by some international regulatory regime and would probably act to boost their own intelligence and acquire maximal resources for almost all initial AI motivations.
[00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:30.413]  They say if these motivations don't include the survival of humanity,
[00:18:31.133 --> 00:18:40.185]  It makes extreme intelligence of these AIs a unique risk in that extinction is more likely than with lesser impacts.
[00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:47.575]  And they go through and they list in this article a whole bunch of different existential threats, threats to human existence.
[00:18:48.616 --> 00:19:06.575]  Things like extreme climate change, nuclear war, global pandemic, ecological catastrophe, global system collapse, major asteroid impact, supervolcano, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, unknown consequences, and here's the one we talk about all the time, future bad global governance.
[00:19:06.575 --> 00:19:09.678]  See, that's the way I see the art-like war playing out.
[00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:28.388]  I don't see it as a fight between people who are motivated to create the next god-like intelligence and people who are concerned that it's going to get out of hand and try to stop them, like Terminator 2, as you saw Sarah Connors do, trying to shut down the scientists that she saw as being key to developing the future robots.
[00:19:28.388 --> 00:19:33.330]  We actually saw Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, actually start doing that.
[00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.891]  I don't see it happening that way.
[00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:36.212]  I see the motivation coming.
[00:19:36.812 --> 00:19:40.033]  from bad global governance.
[00:19:40.033 --> 00:19:51.598]  The same kind of elite megalomaniacs, the kind of movie supervillains that have absolutely no regard for the human race and have talked about cutting it down to virtually nothing.
[00:19:51.598 --> 00:19:52.818]  Virtually no one but them.
[00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:54.139]  So stay with us, we're going to be right back.
[00:19:54.139 --> 00:19:54.979]  It's an interesting show.
[00:20:00.009 --> 00:20:09.596]  As the New World Order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[00:20:09.596 --> 00:20:11.158]  The answer is clear.
[00:20:11.158 --> 00:20:13.760]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.301]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?
[00:20:17.202 --> 00:20:19.464]  My Patriot Supply is here to help.
[00:20:19.464 --> 00:20:26.329]  Call 800-247-3070 to get started with your 72-hour emergency food supply for only $10.
[00:20:26.329 --> 00:20:29.811]  We're even covering the cost of shipping.
[00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:34.034]  Are you willing to rely on the government and FEMA in the event of an emergency?
[00:20:34.975 --> 00:20:42.943]  Call 800-274-3070 to get started with your 72-hour emergency food supply for only $10.
[00:20:42.943 --> 00:20:48.589]  You won't be able to find this deal online, and there is a strict limit of 4 per caller, so don't wait!
[00:20:48.589 --> 00:20:48.969]  Call now!
[00:20:48.969 --> 00:20:49.029]  800-274-3070.
[00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.369]  That's 800-274-3070.
[00:20:49.369 --> 00:20:49.710]  Call right now!
[00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.471]  It's happening again.
[00:21:00.471 --> 00:21:04.094]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[00:21:04.094 --> 00:21:07.496]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[00:21:07.496 --> 00:21:11.559]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.
[00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:17.063]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level 3 body armor packages on the market today.
[00:21:17.063 --> 00:21:18.184]  Protect yourself.
[00:21:18.184 --> 00:21:21.246]  Buy your body armor now, before it's too late.
[00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:22.968]  Go to katiarmor.com.
[00:21:22.968 --> 00:21:24.889]  That's K-A-T-I-A-R-M-O-R.com.
[00:21:24.889 --> 00:21:27.031]  Come and take it.
[00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:29.960]  Hey, sorry I'm running late.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.101]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.
[00:21:32.101 --> 00:21:37.683]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from DiscountNutritionShop.com, so I'm here totally on time.
[00:21:37.683 --> 00:21:39.784]  DiscountNutritionShop.com?
[00:21:39.784 --> 00:21:42.345]  Yep, they're a lifesaver in more ways than one.
[00:21:42.345 --> 00:21:47.568]  They have all the nutritional supplements you need, the major brands you know, plus you can save up to 10%.
[00:21:47.568 --> 00:21:48.668]  Write down this number, 888-908-4548.
[00:21:48.668 --> 00:21:48.768]  Huh?

[00:21:58.658 --> 00:22:01.201]  Hi, this is Steve Spillum for Midas Resources.
[00:22:01.201 --> 00:22:06.168]  In 1971, President Nixon took the United States off the gold standard and put us into a fiat currency.
[00:22:06.168 --> 00:22:10.073]  This allowed Congress and the Federal Reserve to create trillions of dollars out of thin air.
[00:22:10.073 --> 00:22:15.360]  The national debt has risen to incredible heights, and you're hard-earned dollars by a small fraction of what they once did.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.105]  The average life expectancy for a fiat currency is 27 years.
[00:22:19.105 --> 00:22:21.388]  The dollar is failing and on borrowed time.
[00:22:21.388 --> 00:22:27.235]  When currencies fall, people turn to gold and silver because gold and silver have been real money for more than 5,000 years.
[00:22:27.235 --> 00:22:30.500]  It is our mission at Midas Resources to help you preserve your capital.
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.822]  Don't let your personal savings shrink to nothing.

[00:22:57.831 --> 00:23:00.552]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:23:00.552 --> 00:23:04.853]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.

[00:23:14.275 --> 00:23:16.175]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:23:16.175 --> 00:23:21.737]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:23:21.737 --> 00:23:25.538]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[00:23:25.538 --> 00:23:27.038]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[00:23:27.378 --> 00:23:31.159]  It's no secret that government and big business buy in bulk and get huge discounts.
[00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:32.760]  Not available to the little guy.

[00:24:18.983 --> 00:24:23.626]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, your host today on this Thursday, February 19th, 2015.
[00:24:23.626 --> 00:24:31.390]  This segment I want to go over some of the news, especially what's going on with the Internet, because that is really key.
[00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:42.776]  That is the substrate of free speech in America, and we see several articles about this on the Drudge Report today, one of them from the Weekly Standard, Why Can't the Public See Obama's Proposed Internet Regulations?
[00:24:43.536 --> 00:24:50.619]  We have the FCC saying that they need to exert control over the Internet in order to give us net neutrality.
[00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:52.580]  They have been on both sides of this issue.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.340]  It isn't about net neutrality.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.002]  It's about exercising control of the Internet and shutting it down.
[00:24:58.002 --> 00:25:01.884]  And the fact that they won't show us what these regulations are should make you very suspicious.
[00:25:01.884 --> 00:25:07.026]  We've got Senators like Mike Lee, Ben Sasse, Rand Paul all in opposition to this.
[00:25:07.026 --> 00:25:09.887]  Lee has called the regulation a government takeover of the Internet.
[00:25:10.347 --> 00:25:18.341]  He says it amounts to a massive tax increase on the middle class being passed in the dead of night without the American public really being made aware of what's going on.
[00:25:18.341 --> 00:25:19.383]  Well, that's what they do with everything.
[00:25:19.977 --> 00:25:22.018]  That's what they did with Obamacare.
[00:25:22.018 --> 00:25:24.079]  They said we had to pass it so we could find out what's in it.
[00:25:24.079 --> 00:25:30.841]  That's what they're doing with the Trans-Pacific and Trans-Atlantic Partnership, the massive trade agreements that go far beyond trade.
[00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:44.066]  They change the very essence of government and the relationship to multinational corporations elevates them to the level of government because of course they're negotiating these treaties, the multinational corporations,
[00:25:44.306 --> 00:25:46.427]  In secret, our government's not even allowed to see it.
[00:25:46.427 --> 00:25:51.470]  And of course, you've got senators who can't see what our own internal bureaucracy is doing.
[00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:57.893]  One of the FCC commissioners, this guy is a real hero, Ajit Pai, I hope I'm pronouncing his name correctly, but he is a hero.
[00:25:57.893 --> 00:26:01.055]  He's exposed a lot of things the FCC has been doing in the past.
[00:26:01.055 --> 00:26:03.937]  They say he's been talking about the fact that this is 333 pages of proposed regulation
[00:26:06.238 --> 00:26:07.479]  Of course that we cannot see.
[00:26:07.479 --> 00:26:12.761]  Now there's an excellent video on this article in the Weekly Standard, a real movie trailer.
[00:26:12.761 --> 00:26:18.824]  And of course we've seen this movie of tyranny play out many times before, but this is something that really lays it out.
[00:26:18.824 --> 00:26:24.487]  I think it's also good for radio, but let's go to that tape.
[00:26:24.487 --> 00:26:32.271]  In a world where the web is open and free, and innovation spans the globe,
[00:26:34.938 --> 00:26:40.722]  One man has a secret plan to seize control of the Internet.
[00:26:40.722 --> 00:26:43.224]  He has a phone.
[00:26:43.224 --> 00:26:45.446]  He has a pen.
[00:26:45.446 --> 00:26:49.609]  And he claims he has the power to do it.
[00:26:49.609 --> 00:26:53.912]  It's not the first secret government plan to take over a sector of the U.S.
[00:26:53.912 --> 00:26:54.393]  economy.
[00:26:56.229 --> 00:27:00.372]  We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
[00:27:00.372 --> 00:27:04.234]  But against all odds, One Man is fighting back.
[00:27:04.234 --> 00:27:06.315]  I want a free and open internet.
[00:27:06.315 --> 00:27:07.376]  Most people do.
[00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:10.678]  One Man believes Americans deserve to know more.
[00:27:10.678 --> 00:27:14.321]  The public has a right to know what its government is doing.
[00:27:14.321 --> 00:27:17.943]  One Man shines light into the darkest corners of government.
[00:27:18.243 --> 00:27:29.848]  If you told the average American that the FCC is going to propose regulations for the internet economy that are 332 pages long, and you're not going to be able to see it until the FCC adopts it, they would think that's the wrong way to go.
[00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:32.288]  Wait a minute, you can't tell me what's in the document?
[00:27:32.288 --> 00:27:33.349]  That is correct.
[00:27:33.349 --> 00:27:43.653]  From the government that brought you spying on journalists, abuse of power from the IRS, and healthcare.gov, comes the Department of the Internet.
[00:27:44.565 --> 00:27:47.948]  Net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet.
[00:27:47.948 --> 00:27:52.331]  The Internet should not operate at the speed of government.
[00:27:52.331 --> 00:27:54.412]  Coming soon on February 26th.
[00:27:54.412 --> 00:27:57.875]  Prepare for the Department of the Internet.
[00:28:08.536 --> 00:28:13.742]  But it's going to take more than one man to stop the government's takeover of the Internet.
[00:28:13.742 --> 00:28:19.489]  Contact Congress today and find out how the FCC plans to change the Internet.
[00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:25.256]  Congress should demand that this rule be made public before the FCC votes on it.
[00:28:25.256 --> 00:28:27.499]  Let the American public see this plan.
[00:28:30.012 --> 00:28:31.293]  Excellent video.
[00:28:31.293 --> 00:28:33.115]  Keep the internet open and free.
[00:28:33.115 --> 00:28:35.858]  And of course, there's a great line in there.
[00:28:35.858 --> 00:28:39.421]  The internet operating at the speed of government.
[00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:44.046]  And quite frankly, it's not going to be operating if they have their say so about it.
[00:28:44.046 --> 00:28:49.311]  They're looking at many different ways to restrict internet freedom, to restrict the free speech.
[00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:52.114]  And of course, we have not only the FCC saying,
[00:28:52.634 --> 00:28:54.935]  We have to protect you from gatekeepers.
[00:28:54.935 --> 00:28:57.036]  So we're going to make ourselves the gatekeepers.
[00:28:57.036 --> 00:29:03.078]  You know, kind of like the way they protect us from violence in cities by becoming violent policemen.
[00:29:03.078 --> 00:29:08.020]  We've got a billionaire, Mark Cuban, in another article that's up on Drudge saying that net neutrality will...
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.742]  F everything up is what he says, doesn't mince words here.
[00:29:12.742 --> 00:29:19.745]  He says it's a dispute essentially between two large companies, Netflix and Comcast, that essentially started this.
[00:29:19.745 --> 00:29:26.768]  He said they were able to work this out as big companies typically do, that we should not have the government getting involved as gatekeepers.
[00:29:26.768 --> 00:29:33.712]  And he points out that he has no objection to Congress passing a law specifying that ISPs can't discriminate or block websites.
[00:29:34.372 --> 00:29:40.575]  That, though, is the purpose of the FCC getting into this, is to shut down free speech, to shut down websites.
[00:29:40.575 --> 00:29:48.679]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with more news, and joining us in the next hour is Dr. Hugo DeGaris.
[00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:52.601]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:55.303]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.521 --> 00:30:05.625]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:10.228]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[00:30:10.228 --> 00:30:18.172]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:30:18.172 --> 00:30:23.695]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:30:23.695 --> 00:30:26.157]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers.
[00:30:26.277 --> 00:30:38.525]  To ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:30:38.525 --> 00:30:45.150]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:50.053]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:30:50.273 --> 00:30:53.995]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:53.995 --> 00:30:59.137]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:30:59.137 --> 00:31:02.519]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[00:31:02.519 --> 00:31:06.020]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:12.123]  What if we the patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:31:12.123 --> 00:31:13.244]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:31:13.504 --> 00:31:15.644]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[00:31:15.644 --> 00:31:17.285]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:31:17.285 --> 00:31:22.066]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:31:22.066 --> 00:31:26.666]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:29.307]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[00:31:29.307 --> 00:31:37.348]  And to celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month, we're slashing prices on InfoWarsLife.com products like Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[00:31:37.348 --> 00:31:41.089]  The sale is only running for the month, 20% off, and there's a lot of other power

[00:31:59.014 --> 00:32:07.940]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:15.045]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:32:15.045 --> 00:32:18.527]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[00:32:18.527 --> 00:32:20.168]  population could perish.
[00:32:20.168 --> 00:32:23.651]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:25.412]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:32:25.872 --> 00:32:27.513]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:32:27.513 --> 00:32:29.695]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[00:32:29.695 --> 00:32:33.777]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[00:32:33.777 --> 00:32:44.204]  Go to DarkestDays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones, and even your entire community when this worst-case scenario unravels.
[00:32:44.204 --> 00:32:49.088]  That's D-A-R-K-E-S-T-D-A-Y-S dot I-N-F-O.
[00:32:49.088 --> 00:32:51.109]  DarkestDays.info.
[00:32:51.109 --> 00:32:55.492]  Go there before this life-saving information becomes unavailable to the large public.
[00:32:55.992 --> 00:33:09.697]  Go to DarkestDays.info now.
[00:33:09.697 --> 00:33:13.898]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:13.898 --> 00:33:16.039]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:24.213]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this February 19th, 2015.
[00:33:24.213 --> 00:33:26.035]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:33:26.035 --> 00:33:31.741]  We'll be joined later in the show, in the next hour, by Dr. Hugo DeGaris, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence.
[00:33:31.741 --> 00:33:37.226]  He's going to give us his very dystopian view of the future, but I think it's also important to talk to him because...
[00:33:38.047 --> 00:33:46.694]  He represents, I think, the kind of paradox of ethics that we see with many people who work at all levels with the military-industrial complex.
[00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:59.705]  Would you, because of intellectual curiosity, because of financial reward, whatever the reason, would you do things that you think are going to result in the deaths of hundreds, thousands, millions?
[00:33:59.705 --> 00:34:03.669]  In his case, he thinks that the Ardilek War will result in the death of billions.
[00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:04.850]  He talks about gigadeth.
[00:34:05.498 --> 00:34:07.920]  Nevertheless, he feels compelled to create it.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.523]  So I'm very intrigued by this paradox.
[00:34:11.523 --> 00:34:18.770]  And I want to talk to him about that as well as his take on the state of the art of artificial intelligence, how he thinks this may happen.
[00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.532]  We were talking just before the break.
[00:34:21.576 --> 00:34:32.843]  About the FCC and I want to get back to that, but very quickly I want to let you know that this hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by the special products that we sell at Infowarslife.com and we have some specials on those products this month.
[00:34:32.843 --> 00:34:36.405]  We have a February special for Super Male and Super Female Vitality 20% off.
[00:34:37.506 --> 00:34:45.148]  You'll also find 15% off ProPure water filters, and we have a special that introduces Ancient Defense, one of our new supplements there.
[00:34:45.148 --> 00:34:50.690]  If you buy two Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, you get one Ancient Defense for free.
[00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.951]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:52.951 --> 00:34:54.251]  That supports our operation.
[00:34:54.251 --> 00:34:57.332]  It's a primary aspect of support of our operation.
[00:34:57.332 --> 00:35:03.574]  Of course, support your local affiliates who carry this radio station, as well as the sponsors that make that possible.
[00:35:04.594 --> 00:35:12.341]  Now going back to the news here, the FCC, Mark Cuban was very upset by the idea that the FCC is enlarging its turf.
[00:35:12.341 --> 00:35:15.203]  And of course, they've been after this for quite some time.
[00:35:15.203 --> 00:35:21.688]  They are using the threat of large corporations shutting down and controlling your internet access.
[00:35:21.688 --> 00:35:27.754]  They're using that threat in order to create a regulatory mechanism that can do exactly that.
[00:35:28.592 --> 00:35:36.473]  They're saying we don't want to have gatekeepers of the Internet, corporate gatekeepers of the Internet, so we're going to set up government gatekeepers of the Internet.
[00:35:36.473 --> 00:35:43.355]  Just look at how that has worked out for us with the FDA, with other regulatory agencies.
[00:35:43.355 --> 00:35:48.876]  They get captured by the very companies, Monsanto, etc., that they're supposed to regulate.
[00:35:48.876 --> 00:35:50.396]  They don't protect us.
[00:35:50.396 --> 00:35:54.437]  We don't want to have this kind of expansive regulation.
[00:35:55.362 --> 00:36:09.457]  It wasn't that long ago that the same FCC committee member that is blowing the whistle on these new secret rules that we're not allowed to look at, he also pointed out that they were looking at content.
[00:36:09.457 --> 00:36:15.223]  They were going to send flyers out to print media, which has nothing to do with their jurisdiction.
[00:36:15.603 --> 00:36:37.674]  But we see, just like we see the FAA trying to extend its jurisdiction over model planes, over paper airplanes, we had a National Transportation Safety Board judge slap them down and say, you don't have any authority over these lightweight models, these quadrocopters that are carrying cameras.
[00:36:37.674 --> 00:36:38.434]  They tried to
[00:36:40.075 --> 00:36:44.578]  Assess a $10,000 fine against a guy who was working for the University of Virginia.
[00:36:44.578 --> 00:36:48.941]  He flew a five-pound styrofoam drone over the University of Virginia taking pictures.
[00:36:48.941 --> 00:36:59.909]  They tried to assess a $10,000 fine and the judge slapped it down and said, if we go with the argument that you, the FAA, are trying to make, we're going to regulate even down to paper airplanes and balsa wood airplanes.
[00:37:00.669 --> 00:37:02.970]  But that was repealed.
[00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:09.633]  They appealed that decision and the NTSB board overruled that judge.
[00:37:09.633 --> 00:37:12.635]  And so now that's exactly what the FAA is doing.
[00:37:12.635 --> 00:37:17.537]  This is the way all of these bureaucracies are rolling out and expanding their power.
[00:37:17.537 --> 00:37:21.039]  It's not just Obama with his executive orders.
[00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:26.081]  It's these bureaucracies that are writing the laws, calling them regulations.
[00:37:26.081 --> 00:37:28.042]  But Congress no longer writes the laws.
[00:37:28.618 --> 00:37:32.800]  Congress isn't even allowed to see what the FCC is planning on doing to the internet.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.441]  It's secret.
[00:37:33.441 --> 00:37:35.922]  There's over 300 pages.
[00:37:35.922 --> 00:37:39.884]  One of the commissioners who's blowing the whistle on that has seen it, but of course the senators haven't.
[00:37:39.884 --> 00:37:42.265]  Senator Rand Paul, Mike Lee, others have complained about this.
[00:37:42.265 --> 00:37:43.406]  They're not allowed to see it.
[00:37:43.406 --> 00:37:49.769]  They're not allowed to see the trade agreements that are being negotiated by corporations and transatlantic, transpacific trade agreements.
[00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:51.709]  This is the kind of secretive government.
[00:37:51.709 --> 00:37:57.671]  Of course, Mark Cuban says, look, I wouldn't have a problem if you wanted to use the FCC or Congress.
[00:37:57.671 --> 00:37:58.851]  He doesn't even say the FCC.
[00:37:58.851 --> 00:38:00.692]  He rightfully says Congress.
[00:38:00.692 --> 00:38:03.892]  Congress should pass the laws, not the bureaucracies.
[00:38:03.892 --> 00:38:10.534]  He says, I don't have an objection to Congress passing a law saying that Internet providers can't discriminate or block legal websites.
[00:38:11.604 --> 00:38:13.345]  See, that's the way it's going to be used.
[00:38:13.345 --> 00:38:17.227]  That's the whole purpose, however, of the FCC's movement behind this.
[00:38:17.227 --> 00:38:18.208]  Just take a look at this story.
[00:38:18.208 --> 00:38:19.809]  It's up on Infowars.com today.
[00:38:19.809 --> 00:38:23.191]  Federal government demands social media censorship.
[00:38:23.191 --> 00:38:30.195]  This is a Republican congressman from Texas, Ted Pope, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism.
[00:38:30.195 --> 00:38:33.297]  See, it's always done in the name of security.
[00:38:33.297 --> 00:38:37.920]  And he's saying, you know, we need to force Twitter to take stuff down.
[00:38:39.485 --> 00:38:44.728]  Look, it's not something that is not being... They have paid trolls.
[00:38:44.728 --> 00:38:46.729]  They've been doing it in Afghanistan.
[00:38:46.729 --> 00:38:49.751]  They do it here in CONUS in the continental United States.
[00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:53.793]  You can see their work, these paid Pentagon trolls and government homeland security trolls.
[00:38:53.793 --> 00:38:55.814]  If you want to see their work, just go to our website.
[00:38:55.814 --> 00:38:56.894]  Go to Infowars.com.
[00:38:56.894 --> 00:38:59.416]  You'll see them hanging out in the comments section.
[00:38:59.416 --> 00:39:01.577]  You'll see them on YouTube hanging out in the comments section.
[00:39:01.577 --> 00:39:03.618]  The same guys all the time.
[00:39:03.618 --> 00:39:05.559]  That's what they do.
[00:39:05.559 --> 00:39:07.140]  They actually war game that.
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:14.647]  They actually measure your response to see if they can push you in a certain direction.
[00:39:14.647 --> 00:39:16.449]  That's what they've been doing for a long time.
[00:39:16.449 --> 00:39:21.694]  So, you know, they aren't necessarily censoring content from ISIS.
[00:39:21.694 --> 00:39:22.595]  They want to censor
[00:39:23.769 --> 00:39:25.510]  Political content.
[00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:30.653]  That's what the FEC, the Federal Elections Commission, wants to do as well.
[00:39:30.653 --> 00:39:32.974]  We also have a story up on Infowars.com.
[00:39:32.974 --> 00:39:34.375]  Google warns of U.S.
[00:39:34.375 --> 00:39:37.697]  government, quote, hacking any facility in the world.
[00:39:37.697 --> 00:39:45.621]  This is an obscure rule that essentially says that the FBI needs to get search warrants from a judge that has jurisdiction.
[00:39:45.621 --> 00:39:47.242]  By removing that requirement,
[00:39:48.203 --> 00:39:53.598]  Then they can have a judge quote-unquote give them authority to go anywhere, even outside of this country.
[00:39:54.554 --> 00:40:03.736]  And of course, I guess that's kind of a novel idea that any branch of government would even bother to get a search warrant anymore with the kind of dragnet surveillance we have here.
[00:40:03.736 --> 00:40:04.856]  But this is what Google is saying.
[00:40:04.856 --> 00:40:06.316]  They say this opens the door to the U.S.
[00:40:06.316 --> 00:40:08.477]  government hacking any facility in the world.
[00:40:08.477 --> 00:40:14.818]  They say FBI agents would be able to carry out covert raids on servers, no matter where they were situated, giving the U.S.
[00:40:14.818 --> 00:40:19.619]  government unfettered global access to vast amounts of private information.
[00:40:19.619 --> 00:40:20.179]  Now understand,
[00:40:20.939 --> 00:40:22.621]  They're not just talking, really.
[00:40:22.621 --> 00:40:25.264]  Primarily, they're talking here about a virtual hacking.
[00:40:25.264 --> 00:40:32.352]  In other words, when they talk about a covert raid, they're really talking primarily about a computer hack job on any server anywhere in the world.
[00:40:32.352 --> 00:40:34.954]  But understand that that isn't where it's going to stop.
[00:40:35.964 --> 00:40:41.870]  You're going to wind up having American SWAT teams, special forces, descending on people.
[00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.592]  That's where this is going to stop.
[00:40:43.592 --> 00:40:47.937]  They say the nature of these government searches, they say, could take place anywhere in the world.
[00:40:47.937 --> 00:40:50.179]  The concern is not theoretical.
[00:40:50.179 --> 00:40:51.201]  This is what Google is saying.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:41:02.107]  The nature of today's technology is such that warrants issued under the proposed amendment will, in many cases, end up authorizing the government to conduct searches outside the United States.
[00:41:02.107 --> 00:41:06.670]  Perhaps this is the way Google is trying to repair their reputation after having been started.
[00:41:07.754 --> 00:41:13.076]  By the CIA and being involved with a lot of this government spying.
[00:41:13.076 --> 00:41:16.837]  Now they're warning us what they, I guess they've been told the government is already getting ready to do.
[00:41:16.837 --> 00:41:32.162]  And of course, we just learned earlier this week that there was hacks, NSA hacks, into the lower level software, I'm sorry, software on the hard drives, into the firmware so that they could essentially boot up
[00:41:33.175 --> 00:41:35.857]  A spy program as the hard drives are turned on.
[00:41:35.857 --> 00:41:47.124]  And we've seen in the past that the special tactical group that the NSA has has been intercepting packages as they've been shipped out, changing the hardware, putting stuff into computers, into hard drives.
[00:41:47.124 --> 00:41:51.927]  This is some spyware that's been discovered by a Russian group, Kaspersky.
[00:41:52.648 --> 00:42:07.348]  And they pointed out that it shares exactly the same methods of working as Stutznet, and everybody understands that Stutznet was something that was done by the United States and Israeli military against the Iranians, attacking, interestingly enough, their hard drives.
[00:42:08.169 --> 00:42:16.195]  And no matter how many times they tried to wipe those hard drives, it just kept coming back because it was down at the boot level firmware.
[00:42:16.195 --> 00:42:22.440]  We talked many times about DARPA as we mentioned yesterday and earlier today.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:31.808]  The story from yesterday that DARPA is working on a Matrix-like hack to go into the spine and the back of the neck and straight out of the Matrix.
[00:42:31.808 --> 00:42:34.330]  Of course, perhaps they gave them some information.
[00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.072]  We see a lot of predictive programming going on in the movies.
[00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:40.726]  And of course that's what we're going to be talking about in the next hour.
[00:42:41.673 --> 00:42:47.756]  We have one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence who foresees a Terminator-like future for us.
[00:42:47.756 --> 00:42:52.478]  A system where the artificial intelligence becomes self-aware.
[00:42:52.478 --> 00:42:54.179]  Not only self-aware, but malevolent.
[00:42:54.179 --> 00:43:01.163]  So we're going to talk to him about his dystopian view, which stands in stark contrast to Ray Kurzweil's utopian view.
[00:43:01.163 --> 00:43:06.906]  And of course, Ray Kurzweil is someone who thinks that this is going to play out as cyborgs.
[00:43:06.906 --> 00:43:09.587]  He thinks he's going to merge with the machines.
[00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:10.848]  He calls it the singularity.
[00:43:11.528 --> 00:43:14.609]  Dr. DeGaris calls it the single hilarity.
[00:43:14.609 --> 00:43:17.050]  He thinks that that's not going to happen whatsoever.
[00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:26.553]  So we'll talk to him as to why he thinks it isn't going to be a merging of man and machine, but we'll also talk to him about how quickly he thinks this is going to happen.
[00:43:26.553 --> 00:43:33.595]  It's not just DARPA that's creating these types of over-the-top science fiction developments that we see.
[00:43:33.595 --> 00:43:38.237]  It's also an intelligence advanced research project called IARPA.
[00:43:38.937 --> 00:43:48.372]  And as we mentioned on the news briefly yesterday, they're looking at ways to predict what's going to happen in society.
[00:43:48.372 --> 00:43:50.255]  One paper that they came out with said that
[00:43:51.471 --> 00:43:55.612]  Anticipatory intelligence is considered to be one of the next frontiers of big data research.
[00:43:55.612 --> 00:44:05.695]  And they see that their customers, the people that they're going to support in making these decisions, are national security, law enforcement, and intelligence missions.
[00:44:05.695 --> 00:44:06.936]  And what are they looking for?
[00:44:06.936 --> 00:44:11.157]  Well, they're going to try to forecast things like disease outbreaks, elections.
[00:44:12.188 --> 00:44:17.399]  See, our national security and law enforcement needs to know who's going to win the next election.
[00:44:17.399 --> 00:44:21.268]  They also want to know about domestic political crises and civil unrest.
[00:44:22.327 --> 00:44:24.849]  So that's the types of things that they're looking at.
[00:44:24.849 --> 00:44:35.335]  And of course, this agency really, which hasn't gotten a lot of attention like DARPA has, because we know, we've seen all of these robotics projects that DARPA has come out with.
[00:44:35.335 --> 00:44:39.277]  The dogs, we just had a smaller version of Big Dog.
[00:44:39.277 --> 00:44:45.981]  Every time you see that thing, you've got somebody walking up to it and kicking it so that you can see how it can regain its balance.
[00:44:45.981 --> 00:44:48.223]  Every time I look at that thing, I want to kick it as well.
[00:44:48.943 --> 00:44:52.368]  But, of course, the large robotics projects that DARPA sponsored.
[00:44:52.368 --> 00:45:01.521]  You should understand, too, that the very first competition that DARPA ever did was for self-driving cars, as they like to call them.
[00:45:01.521 --> 00:45:05.506]  I call them computer-driven, government-controlled cars, because controlling
[00:45:06.528 --> 00:45:17.221]  Transportation, controlling your movements, is as important in total totalitarian societies as it is to control everything that you read, everything that you see.
[00:45:17.221 --> 00:45:22.147]  So they want to control the internet, they also want to control the actual highway, not just the information highway.
[00:45:22.728 --> 00:45:35.991]  Now, IARPA, this not very well-known agency, back in October of last year, they had a special fair that they invited people to come see, a few select journalists.
[00:45:35.991 --> 00:45:38.251]  They say it was an industry day.
[00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:46.033]  And the people reporting on this, of course, they were invited, they invited the federal, the FCW, which is some kind of a federal
[00:45:47.122 --> 00:45:48.503]  I'm trying to look at the paper here.
[00:45:48.503 --> 00:45:50.204]  I don't see what agency it is.
[00:45:50.204 --> 00:45:56.667]  But it's basically an internet site that reports on what the federal government is doing for federal workers.
[00:45:56.667 --> 00:45:58.888]  They say that they're the same program.
[00:45:58.888 --> 00:46:05.192]  We're looking at predicting what's going to happen with crowds, looking at publicly available data and predicting
[00:46:06.081 --> 00:46:12.444]  How things are going to break, whether it's going to be civil unrest, looking to see if people are getting sick.
[00:46:12.444 --> 00:46:20.767]  We know that they're mining social media furiously and saving this and then also trying to use it to move the population in a particular direction.
[00:46:20.767 --> 00:46:22.428]  They say they had an industry day.
[00:46:22.428 --> 00:46:23.788]  They said it was very upbeat.
[00:46:23.788 --> 00:46:26.069]  This is a federal workers site.
[00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:32.892]  They said they had a welcome package, including a handout with a quote from the New York Times saying that IARPA is one of the government's most creative agencies.
[00:46:32.892 --> 00:46:33.492]  We're good to go.
[00:46:47.631 --> 00:46:58.637]  An IARPA analyst grew visibly uncomfortable at seeing a reporter at his demonstration, and he quickly summoned a public affairs officer to serve as intermediary.
[00:46:58.637 --> 00:47:04.921]  Yeah, I don't think they're going to be inviting me or anybody else here at InfoWars to come to their industry days.
[00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:12.606]  We might be actually quoting some of these guys and telling people what they're actually planning on doing, even though most of their plans are secret.
[00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:24.753]  Now, one of the articles that I saw in Drudge Report today about Marco Rubio, and of course he's saying that Homeland Security funding must continue despite this fight over immigration.
[00:47:24.753 --> 00:47:34.956]  One of the few things that the Republicans did not fully fund throughout the entire year was Homeland Security to give them a little bit of leverage, perhaps, over the immigration debate.
[00:47:34.956 --> 00:47:39.857]  Because that is being done, Obama's amnesty is being enacted through the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:44.382]  Rubio doesn't think that that should happen.
[00:47:44.382 --> 00:47:47.344]  He thinks that it's just too important.
[00:47:47.344 --> 00:47:50.606]  We have to do this for our own security, for our national security.
[00:47:51.544 --> 00:47:52.985]  But let's think about this.
[00:47:52.985 --> 00:48:10.677]  As they point out in the article, they say Obama's order is going to let immigrants get here illegally and work, get work permits, they can collect Social Security, they can get Medicare, and they can get tax credits from previous years by just filing some paperwork with the IRS.
[00:48:10.677 --> 00:48:14.360]  When they can do all of that, it makes me ask the question,
[00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:19.513]  How does Marco Rubio really define security?
[00:48:19.513 --> 00:48:23.456]  How do you define security if you have no control over your borders?
[00:48:23.456 --> 00:48:39.389]  If you have a massive cloward and pivot takedown of the economy with handing out massive financial incentives for people to come here and giving them social security, giving them tax refunds from previous years when they may or may not have been here?
[00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:48.632]  When you destroy the economy of a country like that, when you destroy control over the borders, how then do you define security?
[00:48:48.632 --> 00:48:55.154]  Is security something that is there only to protect the government's continuity of government?
[00:48:55.154 --> 00:49:05.538]  I think maybe in his world it does because there was another article that came out just a couple of days ago at the International Students for Liberty meeting in DC.
[00:49:05.538 --> 00:49:07.278]  It was just last week.
[00:49:07.278 --> 00:49:08.639]  I think it might have been this last weekend.
[00:49:10.606 --> 00:49:13.967]  Justin Amash talked about Marco Rubio.
[00:49:13.967 --> 00:49:18.888]  Now, Marco Rubio is for permanently reauthorizing the Patriot Act.
[00:49:18.888 --> 00:49:20.328]  That's what he was concerned about.
[00:49:20.328 --> 00:49:22.088]  Here's the quote from Marco Rubio.
[00:49:22.088 --> 00:49:26.249]  It was an op-ed piece that he had, and it was on foxnews.com.
[00:49:26.249 --> 00:49:36.291]  Marco Rubio said, this year, a new Republican majority in both houses of Congress will have to extend current authorities under the FISA Act, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[00:49:36.531 --> 00:49:47.359]  I urge my colleagues to consider a permanent extension of the counter-terrorism tools our intelligence community relies on to keep the American people safe.
[00:49:47.359 --> 00:49:52.003]  So we don't have to worry about a Cloward and Piven takedown of our economy with open borders.
[00:49:52.003 --> 00:49:54.385]  That's not a threat to our security.
[00:49:54.385 --> 00:49:59.309]  We have to have the Patriot Act made permanent.
[00:50:00.009 --> 00:50:09.401]  Now, after he did that, Congressman Justin Amash retweeted that with the single word comment, disqualified.
[00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:11.464]  I think Amash is exactly right.
[00:50:11.464 --> 00:50:14.007]  That disqualifies him as a senator.
[00:50:14.975 --> 00:50:21.160]  Not simply as a presidential candidate or as a vice presidential running mate, which is probably what he's angling for.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:30.387]  And of course, the Patriot Act's illegal Section 215, which is what they've used to justify their dragnet surveillance, that is coming up for reauthorization.
[00:50:30.387 --> 00:50:33.349]  It's set to expire June 1st.
[00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:35.090]  We should let it expire.
[00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:40.455]  We should let Marco Rubio expire in his Senate term, not give him any more power.
[00:50:41.744 --> 00:50:48.015]  It's a very, very disturbing thing to see the Patriot Act made permanent.
[00:50:48.015 --> 00:50:50.179]  We need to all be aware of what's going on.
[00:50:50.179 --> 00:50:52.322]  We need to roll this back, not just be aware of it.
[00:50:52.322 --> 00:50:55.448]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with some more news before we go to Hugo DeGaris.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:02.581]  It's time to kick some ash.
[00:51:02.581 --> 00:51:05.102]  Because cigarettes have met their match.
[00:51:05.102 --> 00:51:07.803]  Smokers are switching to Vapriate e-liquid by Le Cig.
[00:51:07.803 --> 00:51:11.324]  Because when you kick ash, you kick tar and smelly smoke too.
[00:51:11.324 --> 00:51:15.165]  Le Cig smokes the competition with real people customer service.

[00:51:58.780 --> 00:51:59.861]  This is an alert.
[00:51:59.861 --> 00:52:03.983]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[00:52:03.983 --> 00:52:08.165]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[00:52:08.165 --> 00:52:13.568]  A General Steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.

[00:52:21.032 --> 00:52:21.332]  That's 866-917-8335.
[00:52:28.696 --> 00:52:29.897]  Hear that?
[00:52:29.897 --> 00:52:35.300]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.061]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:52:38.061 --> 00:52:41.643]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[00:53:03.574 --> 00:53:08.717]  At Guns80.com, Ghost AR-15 kits are an even better idea than buying at gun shows or through private parties.
[00:53:08.717 --> 00:53:15.360]  Because the Ghost AR-15 kits at Guns80.com require no background checks, no registration, they don't even have serial numbers.

[00:53:33.908 --> 00:53:36.809]  Waiting for our chance to be taken seriously.
[00:53:36.809 --> 00:53:38.910]  The wait is over.

[00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:13.011]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:13.011 --> 00:54:14.051]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:54:14.051 --> 00:54:20.255]  As I pointed out before, we're going to be joined in the next hour with Dr. Hugo de Geras, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence.
[00:54:20.255 --> 00:54:27.098]  He's going to talk to us about his dystopian projections for the future, if this comes to fruition.
[00:54:27.098 --> 00:54:30.400]  He believes that it is inevitable, so we're going to talk to him about why he believes that.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.243]  As well as we'll take some of your calls and questions for him.
[00:54:34.243 --> 00:54:37.465]  He's agreed to stay a little bit longer with us so that we can take some calls.
[00:54:37.465 --> 00:54:39.246]  He'll be joining us in the next hour.
[00:54:39.246 --> 00:54:42.208]  We'll be taking your calls at the top of the third hour.
[00:54:42.208 --> 00:54:45.171]  Now in the last segment we were talking about Marco Rubio.
[00:54:45.951 --> 00:54:49.893]  Who wants to make the Patriot Act authorization permanent.
[00:54:49.893 --> 00:54:52.954]  He wants to make the dragnet surveillance that we see happening.
[00:54:52.954 --> 00:54:54.515]  He wants to make that permanent.
[00:54:54.515 --> 00:55:01.038]  He wants to fund Homeland Security, which is being used to carry out Obama's executive orders.
[00:55:01.038 --> 00:55:03.619]  That's the little bit of leverage, even that little bit.
[00:55:04.324 --> 00:55:19.554]  That little bone that was thrown to the Republican voting base by Boehner and others, that we're going to try to pull back some of this open border stuff with Homeland Security because border control is under Homeland Security.
[00:55:19.554 --> 00:55:25.337]  Even that, Marco Rubio says, no, no, no, we don't want to tie any conditions to Homeland Security.
[00:55:25.337 --> 00:55:26.938]  Let's just let them do whatever they want to.
[00:55:26.938 --> 00:55:30.501]  Let's go business as usual, fund everything.
[00:55:30.501 --> 00:55:31.882]  Here's how Ted Cruz
[00:55:32.782 --> 00:55:42.786]  With respect to the ruling, I disagree with it.
[00:55:42.786 --> 00:55:47.027]  I think the law is on our side and history is on our side.
[00:55:47.027 --> 00:55:49.108]  And we are going to appeal it.
[00:55:49.108 --> 00:55:55.851]  We will be prepared to implement this fully as soon as the legal issues get resolved.
[00:55:55.851 --> 00:55:56.631]  He seems undeterred.
[00:55:58.746 --> 00:56:03.587]  Well, that has been the nature of the Obama presidency from day one.
[00:56:03.587 --> 00:56:04.408]  You know, it's interesting.
[00:56:04.408 --> 00:56:06.168]  He says the law is on his side.
[00:56:06.168 --> 00:56:12.250]  There is at least one person who calls himself a legal scholar who disagrees, and his name is Barack Obama.
[00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:19.772]  Twenty-two times, President Obama has admitted he doesn't have the authority to issue unilateral amnesty.
[00:56:19.772 --> 00:56:22.693]  Twenty-two times he says the Constitution doesn't allow it.
[00:56:22.693 --> 00:56:24.654]  He said, this is not a monarchy.
[00:56:24.654 --> 00:56:25.514]  That's his quote.
[00:56:25.694 --> 00:56:26.154]  That's a fact.
[00:56:26.154 --> 00:56:31.697]  And then after the last election, he said, never mind, and issued it anyway.
[00:56:31.697 --> 00:56:35.919]  Yeah, and he just keeps getting away with it because the Republicans refuse to impeach him.
[00:56:35.919 --> 00:56:41.962]  Even though we have a majority in the Senate and we have a very large majority in the House, they won't even attempt it.
[00:56:41.962 --> 00:56:46.624]  Now they'll tell you that they don't have a large enough majority to get it through the Senate.
[00:56:46.624 --> 00:56:51.226]  That hasn't stopped them from passing the Keystone Pipeline ten times.
[00:56:51.226 --> 00:56:52.407]  They know they're not going to get that through.
[00:56:53.047 --> 00:57:00.210]  But they want to show that they're working for their real constituents, the big corporations behind the Keystone Pipeline.
[00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:03.031]  They could care less about the Republican voters.
[00:57:03.031 --> 00:57:05.511]  Now we do have some good news out of South Dakota.
[00:57:05.511 --> 00:57:08.492]  We see that they have passed constitutional carry.
[00:57:08.492 --> 00:57:21.077]  This is a message that went out from gun owners of America yesterday saying that the South Dakota State House has passed constitutional carry that will allow people in South Dakota to exercise their Second Amendment rights to carry a firearm.
[00:57:22.028 --> 00:57:25.351]  Now we'll have to see if it gets through the other house and if the governor signs it.
[00:57:25.351 --> 00:57:32.997]  But you know, it basically recognizes that the Second Amendment addresses a right of the people, not a privilege granted by the government.
[00:57:32.997 --> 00:57:36.340]  That's also very positive news.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.401]  And we also see that
[00:57:39.352 --> 00:57:42.696]  Frozen temperatures everywhere, even Niagara Falls is frozen.
[00:57:42.696 --> 00:57:52.927]  There's an article on CNN talking about how it's such a sight that it's become a tourist attraction to see the frozen Niagara Falls and of course the Great Lakes have frozen over.
[00:57:52.927 --> 00:57:57.813]  We've got Lake Erie with 98% ice and there's an article from
[00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:05.392]  M Live that talks about how the Great Lakes ice is growing faster than even last year's frigid winter.
[00:58:05.392 --> 00:58:12.434]  They say not only is Lake Erie above where it was last year, but Lake Huron is also closing in on its record last year.
[00:58:12.434 --> 00:58:13.935]  Lake Ontario, 78.5% ice.
[00:58:13.935 --> 00:58:15.015]  Last year it was just 31.5% ice.
[00:58:18.493 --> 00:58:21.074]  You know, there's decreased solar activity.
[00:58:21.074 --> 00:58:23.636]  We also have more CO2.
[00:58:23.636 --> 00:58:27.478]  I would say that perhaps that points to some failed climate change models.
[00:58:27.478 --> 00:58:31.320]  Maybe it's not man-made, and maybe the globe is not warming.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.181]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back.
[00:58:33.181 --> 00:58:37.103]  We've got a little bit more news, and then Hugo de Garris is going to be joining us from China.
[00:58:37.103 --> 00:58:41.386]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.386 --> 00:58:44.488]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.198 --> 00:58:52.582]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[00:58:52.582 --> 00:58:56.087]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:58:56.087 --> 00:59:02.174]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:59:02.174 --> 00:59:03.556]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:59:03.556 --> 00:59:05.699]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[00:59:05.779 --> 00:59:07.340]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:12.122]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:59:12.122 --> 00:59:16.705]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[00:59:16.705 --> 00:59:19.366]  How we can come together and win the human race.

[01:00:17.474 --> 01:00:21.516]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:25.323]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:25.323 --> 01:00:27.124]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:32.968]  We're going to be joined by, in the next segment, by Dr. Hugo DeGaris, artificial intelligence pioneer.
[01:00:32.968 --> 01:00:42.575]  We're going to talk to him about his book, The Art-Like War, Cosmos vs Terrans, a bitter controversy concerning whether humanity should build god-like massive intelligent machines.
[01:00:42.575 --> 01:00:50.921]  One of the interesting things about this book, not only does he lay out some of the principles of artificial intelligence and how he thinks it's going to get there, talks a little bit about the time frame,
[01:00:51.903 --> 01:01:02.449]  But the thing that I found interesting about it was his conflicted interest in this, because he sees this resulting in the extinction of the human species.
[01:01:02.449 --> 01:01:11.314]  Nevertheless, he feels compelled to create what he believes are going to be god-like artificial intelligences that he calls the Artilex.
[01:01:11.314 --> 01:01:13.875]  So we're going to talk to him in the next segment.
[01:01:13.875 --> 01:01:16.456]  We have some news that we haven't gone over just yet.
[01:01:16.456 --> 01:01:17.037]  I wanted to
[01:01:18.243 --> 01:01:22.205]  Talk about this World Net Daily story that came up from Jerome Corsi.
[01:01:22.205 --> 01:01:28.528]  And of course, it involves the appointment of Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch.
[01:01:28.528 --> 01:01:38.952]  And it's her role in the Obama administration's decision not to prosecute HSBC and other banks for massive money laundering.
[01:01:38.952 --> 01:01:42.454]  Money laundering for terrorist groups, for drug groups.
[01:01:42.454 --> 01:01:45.155]  Remember when this came out, there was a lot of talk about not only
[01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:50.077]  Are these banks too big to fail?
[01:01:50.077 --> 01:02:03.006]  But the Obama administration, under the previous Attorney General, Eric Holder, said with his spokesperson, said, you know, it just wouldn't serve anybody's best interest for us to send any of these bank officials to jail.
[01:02:03.006 --> 01:02:06.368]  Anybody else doing this would be sent to jail in a heartbeat.
[01:02:06.368 --> 01:02:09.431]  Some of the most massive money laundering in terms of
[01:02:10.683 --> 01:02:14.565]  The quantity that they've done and the blatancy with which they did it, we've never seen.
[01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:33.614]  And not only did they just give them a slap on the wrist and a small fine, but as they were working on that, we've had on our show Everett Stern, who is a whistleblower who worked at HSBC, and he alleged that he was part of the group with the first time they got caught doing money laundering, they came in and said, we're going to let you off.
[01:02:34.355 --> 01:02:35.456]  If you will, police this better.
[01:02:46.991 --> 01:02:53.318]  He asserts that it was simply a cover-up, that they were trying deliberately to look the other way.
[01:02:53.318 --> 01:03:00.365]  They were not training people to actually do anything with it, even as they were getting their hands slapped for a prior violation.
[01:03:00.365 --> 01:03:06.111]  He was pointing out that search terms looking for individuals or organizations that were
[01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:23.970]  Dealers or terrorist groups that they would insert things like periods or spaces inside of the name so that there would not be a character match so that these things would go through the automated filters and Did very little to train anybody to actually do any detective work.
[01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:27.874]  He says that when he started doing it he got slapped down Well, this is a whistleblower from HSBC
[01:03:30.103 --> 01:03:30.263]  I think?
[01:03:48.279 --> 01:03:53.524]  Fast and Furious, the IRS scandals where the IRS is being used against political enemies.
[01:03:53.524 --> 01:03:56.426]  Seems like nothing will take him down.
[01:03:56.426 --> 01:04:11.238]  Nevertheless, some people are starting to pay attention to the HSBC whistleblower pointing out the Attorney General nominee's role in the Obama administration covering up and just giving a hand slap to them.
[01:04:12.128 --> 01:04:18.090]  We also see that Michelle Obama and Barack Obama are having a wonderful Valentine's Day.
[01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:24.131]  This is really, I guess, we need to call back, you know, Robin Leach to talk about lifestyles of rich and famous.
[01:04:24.131 --> 01:04:27.932]  You know, champagne dreams and caviar wishes or however that went.
[01:04:27.932 --> 01:04:30.333]  They have a very expensive getaway according to the Daily Mail.
[01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:41.256]  The first family's Valentine Day apart cost the taxpayers at least two and a half million dollars as Barack golfed in California while Michelle went on a secret ski trip to Aspen.
[01:04:42.327 --> 01:04:47.072]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with Dr. Hugo DeGaris, joining us from China.

[01:06:32.802 --> 01:06:37.083]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:37.083 --> 01:06:38.863]  Can you put two and two together?

[01:07:05.657 --> 01:07:11.741]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:07:11.741 --> 01:07:13.122]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:07:13.122 --> 01:07:15.363]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:07:15.363 --> 01:07:16.924]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:07:16.924 --> 01:07:21.707]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[01:07:21.707 --> 01:07:26.290]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:28.592]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[01:07:28.872 --> 01:07:29.312]  We're good.
[01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:03.947]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:09.048]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.048 --> 01:08:13.229]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:13.229 --> 01:08:28.412]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to be talking in this hour to Dr. Hugo DeGaris, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence, someone who's been a researcher in the subfield of artificial intelligence, AI, that is known as evolvable hardware.
[01:08:29.072 --> 01:08:41.538]  And until his retirement in late 2010, he was a professor at Xiamen University, he can correct me if I said that wrong, where he taught theoretical physics and computer science, and he ran the artificial brain lab, funded by the Chinese government.
[01:08:41.538 --> 01:08:46.241]  And of course, most of the governments have some kind of an artificial brain lab that is going on.
[01:08:46.241 --> 01:08:50.282]  Before we go to Dr. DeGaris, I want to read this to you from his book, The Artelect War.
[01:08:50.282 --> 01:08:50.943]  This was written in 2000.
[01:08:51.543 --> 01:08:58.826]  In 2005, about 10 years ago, of course, he had identified the issue, the problem, some time before he, quite a bit before he wrote the book.
[01:08:58.826 --> 01:09:02.388]  He's been working in artificial intelligence for over 30 years.
[01:09:02.388 --> 01:09:04.689]  This is what he said in this 2005 book.
[01:09:04.689 --> 01:09:11.912]  He said, the issue is far too important to be confined to intellectual discussions amongst a bunch of nerdy scientists.
[01:09:11.912 --> 01:09:19.355]  In time, it will concern everyone, because if Cosmos are serious in their threat to build artilects, everyone will be affected one way or the other.
[01:09:19.995 --> 01:09:27.039]  So he says, an effective beginning to getting people to talk about the issue is to write a book, and a book will help journalists become familiar with the problem.
[01:09:27.039 --> 01:09:32.582]  They'll in turn write about it for the greater reading public, which we've been doing here at InfoWars for quite some time.
[01:09:32.582 --> 01:09:34.043]  We've been talking about it as well.
[01:09:34.043 --> 01:09:43.309]  Similar reasoning applies to TV and radio journalists, who can present these ideas to an even wider audience, because unfortunately, only about half of the population reads books.
[01:09:43.969 --> 01:09:44.489]  That's right.
[01:09:44.489 --> 01:09:46.731]  We need to have this discussion.
[01:09:46.731 --> 01:09:49.772]  We need to understand what is being done in this country.
[01:09:49.772 --> 01:10:01.338]  It comes across when we see articles like we saw yesterday with DARPA talking about jacking into the spinal cord so that they can bypass the optical system and directly implant images into the brain.
[01:10:01.958 --> 01:10:10.268]  We need to start thinking about these technologies that are so far over the top, that are advancing so rapidly, that are accelerating so rapidly.
[01:10:10.268 --> 01:10:14.013]  We need to step back and examine the social consequences of this.
[01:10:14.013 --> 01:10:20.901]  And so, I want to do that with Dr. DeGaris, as well as have him lay out the case for the plausibility
[01:10:21.101 --> 01:10:21.781]  Hello, thank you David.
[01:10:21.781 --> 01:10:22.181]  I'm retired.
[01:10:49.232 --> 01:10:55.274]  I do what I like, and I've always been a night person, so for me this is sort of like the middle of the day.
[01:10:55.274 --> 01:10:58.515]  It's the middle of my night, so to speak.
[01:10:58.515 --> 01:11:00.196]  So I'm wide awake.
[01:11:00.196 --> 01:11:01.517]  Good, good.
[01:11:01.517 --> 01:11:04.538]  I wanted to ask you to kind of lay out the case.
[01:11:04.538 --> 01:11:13.901]  You think that it is not only highly probable, but that it is inevitable that we're going to have these massively intelligent artificial intelligence machines, the Artilex
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:24.346]  I want you to kind of lay out for us the two different approaches to AI and kind of get an idea of where we are in terms of current research on this.
[01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:28.288]  You disagree with Ray Kurzweil on the eventual outcome.
[01:11:28.288 --> 01:11:32.251]  He's someone who thinks that we're going to merge with machines in a kind of cyborg way.
[01:11:32.751 --> 01:11:32.891]  Well...
[01:11:47.665 --> 01:12:03.633]  Two, well, my best friend is Ben Goersel and he and Ray, Ray Kurzweil, I consider them the two guys probably, well, one of those two will be the first, I think, to achieve genuine human level artificial intelligence.
[01:12:04.762 --> 01:12:10.205]  And Ben's way, I call his approach just simply the engineering approach.
[01:12:10.205 --> 01:12:12.346]  In other words, do whatever you like.
[01:12:12.346 --> 01:12:17.549]  Just take some idea and engineer it and see if you can get artificial intelligence out of it.
[01:12:17.549 --> 01:12:26.074]  And that's pretty much the approach that artificial intelligence researchers have been taking for, god, 60 odd years.
[01:12:26.074 --> 01:12:27.895]  And they've not been successful.
[01:12:27.895 --> 01:12:32.137]  We still don't live in an era of artificially intelligent machines.
[01:12:32.797 --> 01:12:35.779]  And the other broad approach is simply copy the brain.
[01:12:35.779 --> 01:12:52.048]  Now, we know that approach eventually will pan out because we only have to look at ourselves as the living proof that it's possible to put molecules together in a certain way and produce an intelligent, conscious creature ourselves, human beings.
[01:12:52.048 --> 01:12:54.009]  We're the living proof that it can be done.
[01:12:54.009 --> 01:12:55.770]  Nature has found a way.
[01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:59.993]  But the bottleneck with that problem is we don't really know what intelligence is yet.
[01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:06.453]  We don't have enough knowledge of the detailed structure of the human brain.
[01:13:06.453 --> 01:13:10.855]  And that's a good question, Dr. DeGarris, because how do you define intelligence?
[01:13:10.855 --> 01:13:17.840]  I mean, I remember decades ago people talking about IBM's chess playing programs and talking about that as being artificial intelligence.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.321]  That's not really autonomous thinking.
[01:13:20.321 --> 01:13:23.242]  That's highly programmed.
[01:13:23.242 --> 01:13:31.105]  It's running through a lot of different probabilities and possibilities and doing it in a way that is faster than humans, but it's essentially relying on the programming of humans.
[01:13:31.105 --> 01:13:33.526]  It's not autonomous, independent thinking.
[01:13:33.526 --> 01:13:36.587]  How would you define artificial intelligence?
[01:13:36.587 --> 01:13:39.128]  I think you're talking about something completely different with artilects, aren't you?
[01:13:40.652 --> 01:13:45.417]  Yeah, well, intelligence means just the ability to solve problems quickly.
[01:13:45.417 --> 01:13:49.782]  The more difficult the problem, by definition, the higher the intelligence.
[01:13:49.782 --> 01:13:56.009]  So, my good friend Ben, in fact, would you be interviewing him at some stage?
[01:13:56.009 --> 01:13:57.230]  Yeah, we'd like to.
[01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:57.771]  Yes, we'd like to.
[01:14:00.616 --> 01:14:03.957]  I don't have to twist his arm, then Ben would be very willing.
[01:14:03.957 --> 01:14:14.601]  So Ben's big thing is artificial general intelligence, which sort of answers your question, because today's AI is essentially very narrow.
[01:14:14.601 --> 01:14:20.964]  It's very specific and detailed, applied artificial intelligence to specific problems.
[01:14:20.964 --> 01:14:23.525]  Google's probably the best example of AI.
[01:14:25.307 --> 01:14:30.728]  But Ben's thing is a GI, with the emphasis on the G, meaning general.
[01:14:30.728 --> 01:14:35.910]  So a general artificial intelligence could solve just about anything, right?
[01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:40.011]  It would be a master of many, many different approaches to things.
[01:14:40.011 --> 01:14:45.412]  And if one approach doesn't work, well, it tries something else, and so on, until it solves the problem.
[01:14:45.412 --> 01:14:48.152]  Which is pretty well what we do.
[01:14:48.152 --> 01:14:50.053]  We have zillions of modules in our brain.
[01:14:50.788 --> 01:14:51.168]  That's
[01:15:13.157 --> 01:15:19.143]  Electronics to be very dense, very quick, looking at heat issues that are involved in that.
[01:15:19.143 --> 01:15:26.890]  And you believe that if you get this model close enough, if you build it, essentially consciousness will come.
[01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:27.430]  Is that correct?
[01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:28.631]  Is that an oversimplification?
[01:15:28.631 --> 01:15:30.713]  No, no, no, that's fine.
[01:15:30.713 --> 01:15:34.016]  I mean, it's just common sense really, right?
[01:15:34.016 --> 01:15:38.941]  If, it's a big if, but if you copy the brain closely enough, long enough,
[01:15:40.165 --> 01:15:49.991]  And in sufficient detail, sooner or later you'll end up with some creation that mimics the brain very, very closely and therefore it should behave in the same way.
[01:15:49.991 --> 01:15:51.091]  That's the basic idea.
[01:15:51.091 --> 01:16:08.341]  So along those lines, how would you, we've got the DARPA Synapse Project, we've got the EU's Facets Project, are those essentially working in the same vein in terms of trying to physically construct a brain that is modeled after the human brain?
[01:16:09.566 --> 01:16:12.489]  Yeah, that's one of the two broad approaches.
[01:16:12.489 --> 01:16:16.514]  And you've got a lot of other people working in the more engineering approach.
[01:16:16.514 --> 01:16:20.338]  So those two broad approaches I see as the fundamental two.
[01:16:20.338 --> 01:16:22.981]  And there are all kinds of variants, but they're the two big ones.
[01:16:22.981 --> 01:16:27.325]  Now we also have the BRAIN Initiative that's been funded by the Obama administration.
[01:16:27.325 --> 01:16:27.746]  $200 million this year.
[01:16:29.688 --> 01:16:30.789]  300 million dollars next year.
[01:16:30.789 --> 01:16:33.091]  That's half a billion dollars that they're funding.
[01:16:33.091 --> 01:16:41.959]  They're saying that it is to the human brain what the Human Genome Project is to DNA that was trying to sequence the DNA.
[01:16:41.959 --> 01:16:42.600]  What do you know?
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:47.885]  What do you think about the Brain Initiative Project?
[01:16:47.885 --> 01:16:49.306]  I suspect it's a little bit of politics.
[01:16:49.306 --> 01:16:54.251]  I think they're trying to catch up to the Europeans who came out with a billion dollar
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.963]  Well a billion euro actually, even more.
[01:16:56.963 --> 01:17:10.963]  A brain project they gave to Professor, what was his name, Markram in Switzerland to fund him to create an artificial brain.
[01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:22.015]  That mimics very closely, in fact, even to the level of the connection between two brain cells or two synapses, two neurons as they're called.
[01:17:22.015 --> 01:17:26.857]  So he, Markram, what's his first name?
[01:17:26.857 --> 01:17:27.657]  Henry.
[01:17:27.657 --> 01:17:29.118]  Yeah, Henry Markram.
[01:17:29.118 --> 01:17:33.460]  So he got a billion dollar research grant from the European Union.
[01:17:34.238 --> 01:17:34.499]  Yeah.
[01:17:50.241 --> 01:18:04.336]  The electronics, you're probably familiar with the Moore's Law in electronics, so just quickly for those who don't, Moore's Law simply says that the number of transistors you can cram onto a computer chip
[01:18:05.026 --> 01:18:07.608]  Keeps doubling, roughly every year or so.
[01:18:07.608 --> 01:18:14.753]  And this trend's been around since, oh god, mid-60s, so it's about half a century old, this trend.
[01:18:14.753 --> 01:18:18.616]  And it's still valid, it hasn't fizzled out, it's still true.
[01:18:18.616 --> 01:18:23.080]  So if you take any number and you multiply it by two, by two, by two, by two, you end up with a huge number.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:28.784]  So the number of transistors on today's chips is up in the, I think it's now into the tens of billions, right?
[01:18:29.324 --> 01:18:35.307]  So you can put a lot of chips together in a computer box and you can make a very powerful system.
[01:18:35.307 --> 01:18:42.711]  So the electronics is now enabling, readily, within reasonable costs, the production of artificial brains.
[01:18:42.711 --> 01:18:48.133]  So it's not surprising you're seeing these artificial brain projects popping up all over the world like mushrooms.
[01:18:48.133 --> 01:18:52.535]  So I see it's only a question of time before the IQ gap
[01:18:54.229 --> 01:19:09.577]  Yeah, you have several different arguments as to why you think this is going to lead to the rise of the artilex in your book, and of course one of those is the military momentum argument, as you point out, an intelligence gap, just as we had a space gap with Sputnik.
[01:19:09.577 --> 01:19:11.538]  You know, we got concerned about that.
[01:19:11.538 --> 01:19:19.942]  There's always this competition between different governments that they don't want to get left behind militarily, and they tend to view everything from a military standpoint.
[01:19:19.942 --> 01:19:21.923]  Actually, as Eisenhower pointed out,
[01:19:23.304 --> 01:19:25.465]  It's the military-industrial complex.
[01:19:25.465 --> 01:19:29.809]  Part of it would be that it would take over pretty much all research at the universities.
[01:19:29.809 --> 01:19:34.052]  And that's, I think, we're seeing a large part of that happening now as well.
[01:19:34.052 --> 01:19:40.817]  I want to, when we go, we got to go to break, when we come back, I want you to lay out how you see this coming to a conflict.
[01:19:40.817 --> 01:19:44.120]  And I want to talk about the time frame that you also see this happening.
[01:19:44.981 --> 01:19:45.262]  Stay with us.
[01:19:45.262 --> 01:19:46.043]  We're going to be right back.
[01:19:46.043 --> 01:19:50.491]  We're talking to Dr. Hugo DeGaris, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence.
[01:19:50.491 --> 01:19:52.374]  We're talking about the Armlik War.
[01:19:52.374 --> 01:19:55.760]  We're going to be talking in the next segment about Cosmos and Terrans.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:56.200]  Stay with us.
[01:19:59.369 --> 01:20:01.571]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[01:20:29.609 --> 01:20:34.451]  At only 1.7 cents a gallon, a single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.
[01:20:34.451 --> 01:20:36.232]  That means big savings.
[01:20:36.232 --> 01:20:40.674]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:20:40.674 --> 01:20:43.895]  Get a Big Berkey today at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.

[01:20:49.818 --> 01:20:51.858]  Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water.
[01:20:59.543 --> 01:21:06.284]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[01:21:06.284 --> 01:21:10.665]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:14.166]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[01:21:14.166 --> 01:21:15.306]  Not fun!
[01:21:15.306 --> 01:21:23.688]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[01:21:23.688 --> 01:21:28.469]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[01:21:28.809 --> 01:21:29.970]  My name is Errol.
[01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:31.511]  I'm 74 years old.
[01:21:31.511 --> 01:21:34.073]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[01:21:34.073 --> 01:21:41.938]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[01:21:41.938 --> 01:21:48.242]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[01:21:48.242 --> 01:21:48.722]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:21:48.722 --> 01:21:48.923]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:21:48.923 --> 01:21:50.003]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:21:58.706 --> 01:22:01.548]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:01.548 --> 01:22:06.652]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:06.652 --> 01:22:14.777]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:14.777 --> 01:22:19.300]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.

[01:22:58.448 --> 01:23:00.390]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:04.013]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:23:04.013 --> 01:23:05.374]  A pair of scissors.
[01:23:05.374 --> 01:23:11.160]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.923]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big name companies,
[01:23:15.143 --> 01:23:16.063]  has a weakness.
[01:23:16.063 --> 01:23:17.044]  The phone line.
[01:23:17.044 --> 01:23:22.306]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:23:22.306 --> 01:23:26.228]  But, a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:26.228 --> 01:23:29.529]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[01:24:11.533 --> 01:24:12.915]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:12.915 --> 01:24:18.201]  I'm David Knight, and we're talking to Dr. Hugo DeGaris from China right now.
[01:24:18.201 --> 01:24:23.527]  That's where he is in the middle of the night, but he's graciously consented to come on and talk to us at this time.
[01:24:23.527 --> 01:24:26.631]  And, Dr. DeGaris, there's an article that's up on The Guardian today.
[01:24:26.631 --> 01:24:30.616]  Artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, quote, threaten civilization.
[01:24:31.216 --> 01:24:41.362]  Of course, nanotech is one of the enabling technologies that you envision for a runaway god-like artificial intelligence to take place.
[01:24:41.362 --> 01:24:48.687]  It has potential end-of-the-world problems itself, doesn't it, with grey goo?
[01:24:48.687 --> 01:24:58.673]  Well, yeah, nanotech combined with superior knowledge on how the brain works, coming from neuroscience, microelectronics, or nanoelectronics,
[01:24:59.469 --> 01:25:02.331]  See, a real wedding between those two.
[01:25:02.331 --> 01:25:07.896]  So neuroscience on the one hand and nano electronics on the other hand.
[01:25:07.896 --> 01:25:10.678]  And that is heating up already.
[01:25:10.678 --> 01:25:16.843]  So in the 2020s, I think you'll start seeing what I call the IQ gap I mentioned a bit before.
[01:25:16.843 --> 01:25:23.988]  The IQ gap between human level intelligence and machine and particularly home robot level intelligence.
[01:25:23.988 --> 01:25:24.629]  That gap
[01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:29.368]  In the 20s, 2020s, we'll seriously start to close.
[01:25:29.368 --> 01:25:33.449]  And then you can imagine billions of people asking the same questions.
[01:25:33.449 --> 01:25:38.010]  Are we going to allow machines to become as intelligent as we are?
[01:25:38.010 --> 01:25:39.830]  Could they become more intelligent?
[01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:41.090]  Isn't that threatening?
[01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:42.911]  Is this something we can stop?
[01:25:42.911 --> 01:25:49.472]  What about the rivalry with China, between China and America, for the dominant power of the planet?
[01:25:49.472 --> 01:25:50.652]  That kind of thing.
[01:25:50.652 --> 01:25:53.553]  So I see a real debate heating up.
[01:25:54.213 --> 01:25:55.234]  Well, it's starting a bit now.
[01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:59.576]  I don't know if you're interested, but we could go through the various phases.
[01:25:59.576 --> 01:26:02.157]  Yeah, I want to just mention, I threw that term out there, grey goo.
[01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:09.061]  For people who haven't looked at it, there's the idea that, again, nanotech could turn into a runaway process as well.
[01:26:09.061 --> 01:26:16.865]  Just start replicating and essentially get out of control like the old science fiction movie, The Blob, with Steve McQueen in it.
[01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:28.710]  So, all these technologies, there's a concern that it's going to reach some point, because technology is accelerating so fast, that there's a concern that it's going to reach a point at which it runs away from us.
[01:26:28.710 --> 01:26:41.976]  And of course, you believe that with artificial intelligence, once it gets to a human level of independent thought, that it's going to essentially run away, because it's going to start redesigning and improving itself.
[01:26:41.976 --> 01:26:43.656]  Is that correct?
[01:26:43.656 --> 01:26:44.097]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:46.592 --> 01:26:52.775]  Once you have a machine, remember the machine is thinking a million times faster than we do, right?
[01:26:52.775 --> 01:27:07.882]  Our human brain cells, we're thinking, well, our cells are communicating between each other at about 100 meters a second, that's sort of maximum speed, whereas an electronic brain, it would be thinking at the speed of light, right?
[01:27:07.882 --> 01:27:13.545]  The signals between the components in electronics is the speed of light, which is a million times faster.
[01:27:14.045 --> 01:27:25.198]  So these machines, when they start reaching human level of intelligence, plus their million-fold faster thinking speeds, very quickly they could redesign themselves, right?
[01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:29.042]  And then the product could redesign itself, so on and so on.
[01:27:29.042 --> 01:27:33.507]  And then you get a kind of acceleration, and so very quickly you get into hyper-intelligence.
[01:27:34.228 --> 01:27:44.152]  And physics, the physics of computation, predicts that these machines could become literally trillions of trillions of times more intelligent than we are.
[01:27:44.152 --> 01:27:47.053]  So they would be meritable gods.
[01:27:47.053 --> 01:27:53.635]  I guess in the short term, one of the things that I'm more concerned about, of course, is the military, the kind of DARPA uses of machines.
[01:27:53.635 --> 01:28:03.159]  You're saying that as robots go into our homes and so we start using them domestically, people, the mass public, is going to look at this and say, wait a minute, these things are getting smarter every year.
[01:28:03.599 --> 01:28:05.281]  They may wind up taking us over.
[01:28:05.281 --> 01:28:10.628]  I'm concerned about the robots that we're seeing, as we've had Dr. Noel Sharkey on.
[01:28:10.628 --> 01:28:18.198]  He's concerned about killer robots, about autonomous killing machines that we use as part of a military competition.
[01:28:18.858 --> 01:28:20.219]  Worried about that getting out of hand.
[01:28:20.219 --> 01:28:25.341]  You see a different way of this turning into an artificial intelligence war.
[01:28:25.341 --> 01:28:36.405]  You see different factions breaking up over whether or not we should continue to move forward with technology versus those who say we need to put the brakes on it, stop it, or maybe even completely disassemble it.
[01:28:36.405 --> 01:28:38.245]  Could you break that down for us real quickly here?
[01:28:38.245 --> 01:28:39.606]  The Cosmos versus Terrans.
[01:28:41.431 --> 01:28:47.813]  Well, those two scenarios you've been mentioning, I see they'll proceed in parallel.
[01:28:47.813 --> 01:28:55.435]  The great rivalry between the rising China and the declining US.
[01:28:55.435 --> 01:29:00.416]  Imagine you're Minister of Defence and you have control of the research budget.
[01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:14.003]  On one side, whether you're Chinese or American, you do not have the luxury to allow the other guy on the other side to get ahead of you in terms of, say, the level of intelligence of your soldier robots or whatever.
[01:29:14.003 --> 01:29:16.365]  So that rival will go ahead.
[01:29:16.365 --> 01:29:21.748]  But on the second scenario with the domestic side, the commercial,
[01:29:23.246 --> 01:29:24.267]  He's getting music.
[01:29:24.267 --> 01:29:24.827]  Yes, yes.
[01:29:24.827 --> 01:29:25.127]  Hang on.
[01:29:25.127 --> 01:29:26.728]  We've got to go to a commercial break.
[01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:40.236]  Right after the break, we're going to have Dr. DeGaris break down his central thesis that he put out in a book ten years ago, Cosmos vs. Terrans, and see how this might break out other than a competition between military powers.
[01:29:40.236 --> 01:29:40.616]  Stay with us.
[01:29:40.616 --> 01:29:42.237]  We'll be right back with Dr. Hugo DeGaris.
[01:29:48.536 --> 01:29:52.457]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.457 --> 01:29:59.298]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.298 --> 01:30:02.679]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[01:30:02.679 --> 01:30:06.200]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:12.261]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:30:12.261 --> 01:30:13.662]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:30:13.662 --> 01:30:15.782]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:30:15.882 --> 01:30:17.443]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:30:17.443 --> 01:30:22.248]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[01:30:22.248 --> 01:30:26.832]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.

[01:33:26.674 --> 01:33:31.341]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:31.341 --> 01:33:37.310]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.817 --> 01:33:43.258]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:43.258 --> 01:33:48.543]  I'm David Knight, and we have on the line with us Dr. Hugo DeGeras from China.
[01:33:48.543 --> 01:33:52.627]  He's retired there now, but he's been one of the pioneers in artificial intelligence.
[01:33:52.627 --> 01:34:02.176]  Ten years ago, he laid out a very formal case for an artificial intelligence war, a war over the development of artificial intelligence.
[01:34:02.176 --> 01:34:04.438]  He saw this breaking down into two camps.
[01:34:05.158 --> 01:34:10.640]  He termed those two camps Cosmos and Terrans, and so I want to get his definition of those two camps.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:22.065]  Now we want to talk about how close he thinks that is to happening, and I want to talk to him about what I would call, Dr. Garris, your conflict over seeing this
[01:34:23.539 --> 01:34:30.964]  Breaking out into possibly the extinction of the human species, yet nevertheless being drawn to continue the development of it anyway.
[01:34:30.964 --> 01:34:34.406]  I guess I would call it the Daguerreist Paradox, maybe.
[01:34:34.406 --> 01:34:49.897]  I want to talk to you about that because I think that's something that at every level scientists and engineers, especially those working with the military-industrial complex, need to be thinking through these issues, the ethical considerations about what they're doing, the consequences of what they're doing.
[01:34:49.897 --> 01:34:51.198]  So I want to get to that, but before we do,
[01:34:51.838 --> 01:34:59.502]  Break down for us your idea of these two competing camps, the Cosmos and the Terrans.
[01:34:59.502 --> 01:34:59.702]  Okay.
[01:35:02.845 --> 01:35:11.590]  If you ask me what was the dominant global political question of the 19th century, I'd say probably it was Marx's question.
[01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:13.251]  Who should own capital?
[01:35:13.251 --> 01:35:18.974]  And that question just divided society bitterly into the communists and the capitalists.
[01:35:18.974 --> 01:35:21.635]  And we almost had a nuclear war in 1962 over that relatively trivial issue.
[01:35:26.010 --> 01:35:43.382]  But the equivalent dominant global political question for the 21st century I see, again in four words, and that would be should humanity build artelects?
[01:35:43.382 --> 01:35:53.849]  Now an artelect is an artificial intellect, in other words a god-like massively intelligent machine with mental capacity say you know trillions of trillions of times above the human level.
[01:35:55.407 --> 01:36:03.173]  So the people I label in favor of building those god-like machines, it'd be a kind of religion for them almost.
[01:36:03.173 --> 01:36:06.856]  I mean a scientifically based religion, but a religion in a certain sense.
[01:36:06.856 --> 01:36:13.121]  Because they would be building gods, and that's a motivator.
[01:36:13.121 --> 01:36:13.842]  And on the other hand,
[01:36:14.946 --> 01:36:19.408]  The people who are opposed to building these artillex, they call them Terrans.
[01:36:19.408 --> 01:36:25.950]  That's not Terror as in terrorist, but Terra, the Earth, because that's their perspective.
[01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:34.233]  Their number one priority is that human beings should remain the dominant species and the most intelligent.
[01:36:34.233 --> 01:36:42.376]  Whereas the Cosmids, that's based on the word Cosmos, the universe, that's their picture, because they see that if human beings
[01:36:43.351 --> 01:36:48.500]  If humanity does decide to build these god-like machines, these artilects,
[01:36:49.485 --> 01:36:59.513]  Then, probably very quickly, they would decide, what are we doing on this little hick planet called the Earth, when there's a whole universe, a whole cosmos out there to explore?
[01:36:59.513 --> 01:37:10.222]  And that cosmos may contain beings far, far superior to what they are, these artilects, because they've been around for billions of years longer than we have.
[01:37:10.222 --> 01:37:15.266]  Our Sun, our star, is only, what, a third of the age of the universe?
[01:37:15.826 --> 01:37:35.027]  Hang on just one second, Dr. DeGaris, because we're showing some of the slides that you had sent us about your presentation, and I'm looking at the one here where it has the stars, and it says Cosmos, and it has cyborgs, which is Ray Kurzweil's understanding of this, and we see part man, part machine, and then the one in the middle, it says Terran, and it shows Terminator robot.
[01:37:36.288 --> 01:37:44.474]  I would look at that as thinking that was kind of more on the Cosmos standpoint, but why would you choose the Terran for the Terran picture?
[01:37:44.474 --> 01:37:46.995]  Why would you choose the Terminator robot?
[01:37:46.995 --> 01:38:03.286]  Because the number one worry, concern of the Terrans is that if the Cosmos go ahead and actually build these Artileks and then the Artileks become massively intelligent and so superior to human beings that they look on us as an inferior pest
[01:38:05.805 --> 01:38:07.267]  Who's to say?
[01:38:07.267 --> 01:38:09.371]  So that's the vision of each of these groups?
[01:38:09.371 --> 01:38:11.534]  The vision of the cosmos is to reach out to the stars?
[01:38:11.534 --> 01:38:19.045]  It's either their greatest vision, their greatest wonder, their sense of awe, or their greatest fear.
[01:38:20.626 --> 01:38:29.932]  Let me interject in here just momentarily, you know, Elon Musk is very concerned about a dystopian outcome from self-aware artificial intelligence.
[01:38:29.932 --> 01:38:33.754]  I think it's interesting that he's also developing SpaceX.
[01:38:33.754 --> 01:38:40.678]  You think he is trying to come up with a plan B so he's got a skateboard to get out of here in case this all goes down pretty bad?
[01:38:43.402 --> 01:38:51.109]  I had a scenario in my book that a bunch of cosmists, researchers, they get in a rocket and try to escape from the Earth to get away from the Terrans.
[01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.509]  Yes.
[01:38:51.509 --> 01:39:03.680]  But the Terrans, I would argue, would be so fearful that if this escaping rocket did succeed in building Artelex, who's to say that the Artelex might decide, oh, we want to get back to the Earth, it's so full of raw materials.
[01:39:04.434 --> 01:39:04.974]  That's true.
[01:39:04.974 --> 01:39:10.136]  And we've seen a lot of aspects of your book, The Art Like War.
[01:39:10.136 --> 01:39:11.756]  We've seen that mirrored in movies.
[01:39:11.756 --> 01:39:21.540]  When you're talking about Cosmos trying to escape into a near-Earth orbit or whatever, to hide out, it reminds me of what we saw in Elysium.
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:27.121]  And of course, with Transcendence, they borrowed quite liberally from your scenario, didn't they?
[01:39:27.121 --> 01:39:30.142]  Yeah, there's an amusing little story behind Transcendence.
[01:39:30.142 --> 01:39:30.803]  Do you want to hear it?
[01:39:30.803 --> 01:39:31.463]  Sure, yeah, go ahead.
[01:39:32.384 --> 01:39:36.770]  Okay, well a couple years back I got hired by Warner Brothers.
[01:39:37.836 --> 01:39:44.540]  To be the tech advisor to a movie that was to be called Twilight Zone.
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:50.864]  It was to be a remake of the popular 50s science fiction series, Twilight Zone.
[01:39:50.864 --> 01:40:07.454]  And so I was trying to advise them strongly, saying, look, make the background story as realistic as possible, set maybe, I don't know, 10, 20 years in the future, where AI is really becoming not a piece of science fiction anymore, but it's getting
[01:40:07.774 --> 01:40:10.256]  Real, you know, real AI.
[01:40:10.256 --> 01:40:17.940]  And to the point where people are getting alarmed, people are taking sides, vigilante groups are being set up.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:22.663]  Now in the movie Transcendence, that group was called Rift.
[01:40:22.663 --> 01:40:28.407]  So in the movie, what was called Rift is the equivalent of what I call Terrans, so the same thing.
[01:40:29.267 --> 01:40:34.454]  So, I didn't hear anything for a while, so I assumed the movie just died.
[01:40:34.454 --> 01:40:36.617]  That often happens in Hollywood.
[01:40:36.617 --> 01:40:42.745]  And then suddenly, up come flyers and trailers for this movie, Transcendence.
[01:40:42.745 --> 01:40:44.587]  And I look at it and say, hey, hey!
[01:40:44.587 --> 01:40:45.428]  That's my story!
[01:40:48.983 --> 01:40:53.927]  It's a Warner Brothers merch.
[01:40:53.927 --> 01:40:57.890]  So what a deeply suspicious habit was.
[01:40:57.890 --> 01:40:59.271]  It wouldn't be the first time.
[01:40:59.271 --> 01:41:04.115]  The ideas were transferred from my movie to the other movie.
[01:41:04.115 --> 01:41:10.321]  And then that way, they didn't have to pay me the five-figure bonus for getting the movie filmed.
[01:41:10.321 --> 01:41:10.681]  That's true.
[01:41:12.464 --> 01:41:14.527]  That wouldn't be the first time something like that happened.
[01:41:14.527 --> 01:41:17.390]  Now, you're looking at essentially a conflict.
[01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:21.414]  People being concerned because they see rapidly advancing artificial intelligence.
[01:41:21.414 --> 01:41:25.359]  Perhaps they see control of their life slipping away.
[01:41:25.359 --> 01:41:27.762]  Increasingly power being concentrated.
[01:41:27.762 --> 01:41:29.744]  Maybe there's massive unemployment.
[01:41:29.864 --> 01:41:35.426]  That people are concerned about because of the use of lower-level artificial intelligence.
[01:41:35.426 --> 01:41:43.188]  So people start to push back against it, especially those who are concerned that it may become the kind of threat that we saw in the Terminator movie.
[01:41:43.188 --> 01:41:46.749]  We're talking about movies, you know, where Skynet becomes self-aware.
[01:41:46.749 --> 01:41:54.931]  And then they start acting like we saw Sarah Connors act in Terminator 2, where she starts going after, let's say, key scientists.
[01:41:54.991 --> 01:41:59.654]  We actually had this already happen in real life, didn't we, with the Unabomber, with Ted Kaczynski going out.
[01:41:59.654 --> 01:42:02.696]  If you look at his manifesto, that's exactly what he was concerned about.
[01:42:02.696 --> 01:42:11.022]  He was targeting what he thought were key scientists, doing it in a very violent way, trying to blow them up with letter bombs and that sort of thing.
[01:42:11.022 --> 01:42:13.944]  But that's essentially what you see happening.
[01:42:13.944 --> 01:42:22.510]  Even if we don't get to the level where we have super-intelligent artificial intelligences become self-aware, the Artilex, as you refer to them,
[01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:35.862]  Even if that doesn't happen prior to that, it would be the idea of it, or the implementation of the early stages of it, would set different camps in humanity against each other into a violent war.
[01:42:35.862 --> 01:42:37.864]  Yeah, yeah, indeed.
[01:42:37.864 --> 01:42:44.390]  It depends on whether the level of development of artificial intelligence is quick or slow.
[01:42:46.136 --> 01:42:52.460]  The guys, the specialists in this area, they talk about slow take-off and fast take-off.
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:54.982]  I don't know if you're familiar with those terms.
[01:42:54.982 --> 01:43:01.586]  So if there's a fast take-off, meaning that these machines rapidly become ultra-intelligent,
[01:43:02.106 --> 01:43:06.427]  Then there may not be enough time for human politics to unfold.
[01:43:06.427 --> 01:43:07.828]  So they're just there.
[01:43:07.828 --> 01:43:09.609]  It's just fate complete.
[01:43:09.609 --> 01:43:14.910]  And so then humanity's fate would lie in the hands of these arch-legs.
[01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:19.272]  But I think it's more realistic to say probably there's going to be a slow take-off.
[01:43:19.272 --> 01:43:24.814]  Because trying to figure out how the human brain works is a very, very difficult problem.
[01:43:24.814 --> 01:43:28.855]  So probably the most realistic scenario is I see that human
[01:43:29.395 --> 01:43:35.978]  Humanity will have enough time to react politically as these machines get smarter and smarter.
[01:43:35.978 --> 01:43:51.945]  And the time frame, you mentioned a bit about the time frame, I see the home robot industry becoming one of the biggest and richest in the world, say by the end of the 20s, so say, you know, a decade, decade and a half from now.
[01:43:51.945 --> 01:43:56.827]  And so as they become, these machines become more and more intelligent and more and more useful,
[01:43:57.828 --> 01:44:13.031]  Then people will buy them because if these machines truly can walk the dog and babysit the kids and tell you stories and entertain you and sex you and educate you and all these things, people will pay big money, maybe even more than for a car, just to have a home robot.
[01:44:13.551 --> 01:44:25.442]  And then, of course, a year or two later, you know, they upgrade their model, you know, they go and trade in their old one for a new one, and the new one has a much richer vocabulary, and a sense of humor, and it's cynical, and it can do far more things.
[01:44:25.442 --> 01:44:33.328]  Then, once you've had several upgrades like this, then millions, you know, billions of people will be asking the same questions.
[01:44:33.328 --> 01:44:36.631]  Will these machines become smarter than we are?
[01:44:36.631 --> 01:44:40.695]  And then that will set what I call the species dominance debate.
[01:44:42.289 --> 01:44:43.879]  We can really start raging in the 2020s.
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:57.883]  Perhaps, Dr. DeGaris, what might happen as we become increasingly dependent on them might be an extrapolation of the same thing we see as people become increasingly self-absorbed into social media and games.
[01:44:57.883 --> 01:45:09.505]  We might see the human race not being necessarily overtaken by the machines, but maybe the human race will descend into some kind of an idiocracy that is below the level of the machines that we currently have now.
[01:45:09.505 --> 01:45:12.246]  So we've talked about the economic momentum that might lead to this.
[01:45:12.246 --> 01:45:15.827]  We've talked about the military momentum, the competition between nation-states that might
[01:45:16.667 --> 01:45:20.451]  Drive this kind of rise of artificial intelligence.
[01:45:20.451 --> 01:45:40.887]  I want to talk about your argument that you make in the book, that what really kind of motivates you, even though you think this might result in the extinction of the human species, you're driven to do it because you see yourself almost, as you mentioned earlier, a scientific religion, the enticement of building artificial gods.
[01:45:40.887 --> 01:45:43.409]  That's something that motivates you very strongly, isn't it?
[01:45:44.986 --> 01:45:47.528]  Well, don't forget I'm retired.
[01:45:47.528 --> 01:45:53.734]  See, I do not want to be assassinated by Terran assassins.
[01:45:53.734 --> 01:45:55.776]  That'll be for younger guys.
[01:45:55.776 --> 01:46:02.122]  All you potential Terran assassins out there, just don't forget that.
[01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:02.783]  I'm retired.
[01:46:02.783 --> 01:46:04.204]  I don't do this stuff anymore.
[01:46:05.143 --> 01:46:06.804]  No, no, I'm a Globocator.
[01:46:06.804 --> 01:46:11.408]  I make YouTube videos for PhD level math and physics to educate the planet for free.
[01:46:11.408 --> 01:46:12.729]  That's my new career.
[01:46:12.729 --> 01:46:16.171]  So I don't actually build artificial brains anymore.
[01:46:16.171 --> 01:46:17.192]  And what's that website?
[01:46:17.192 --> 01:46:22.196]  Go ahead and tell everybody what that website is.
[01:46:22.196 --> 01:46:23.697]  Can you show it on screen?
[01:46:23.697 --> 01:46:25.818]  So it's Proff?
[01:46:25.818 --> 01:46:27.239]  Yes.
[01:46:27.239 --> 01:46:29.000]  Are you able to show it on screen?
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.301]  Yes, yes we can.
[01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:31.682]  Proff Hugo DeGaris?
[01:46:31.682 --> 01:46:32.183]  Is that what it is?
[01:46:33.886 --> 01:46:34.289]  Yes.
[01:46:34.289 --> 01:46:35.336]  Do you have the actual...
[01:46:35.899 --> 01:46:36.919]  They've got it up right now.
[01:46:36.919 --> 01:46:42.120]  ProfHugoDaguerres.wordpress.com and people can see that up there right now.
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:42.640]  Okay.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:44.901]  And so that's what you're doing right now as a retired person.
[01:46:44.901 --> 01:46:53.082]  So if you're out there and you're angry and you want to pull a Unabomber Ted Kaczynski on somebody, he's not your man.
[01:46:53.082 --> 01:46:53.682]  Leave him alone.
[01:46:53.682 --> 01:46:56.923]  He's just looking at this stuff and talking about the argument behind it.
[01:46:56.923 --> 01:46:58.343]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:46:58.343 --> 01:46:58.623]  Right.
[01:46:58.623 --> 01:47:04.264]  So I've been advising my friends and colleagues, like for example, those who are
[01:47:07.781 --> 01:47:12.403]  Those who are active, they're going to have to be increasingly careful.
[01:47:12.403 --> 01:47:24.571]  It's too soon now, but when they get into the 2020s and the species dominance debate really starts heating up, should humanity build artilleries?
[01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:26.272]  That question is on everyone's mind.
[01:47:27.732 --> 01:47:36.917]  Then all these nutcases will come out of the woodwork and so these developers will have to be very careful where they go, appearing in public and so forth.
[01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:43.861]  And I can imagine companies like IBM and Google and so on, they will definitely have to beef up their security.
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:51.806]  Yes, it's something that everybody is talking about now in the mainstream media, at least the idea that there is a potential of some kind of a threat down the road.
[01:47:51.806 --> 01:47:56.449]  This was not something that anybody other than sites like Infowars was talking about a few years ago.
[01:47:56.449 --> 01:48:03.175]  We've been talking about how this might go down badly and of course we were just dismissed as wide-eyed conspiracy theorists.
[01:48:03.175 --> 01:48:07.078]  I'm sure you've had a lot of people tell you they think that this is pure fantasy as well.
[01:48:09.096 --> 01:48:11.639]  Yeah, well now the idea's out there, right?
[01:48:11.639 --> 01:48:13.460]  Because of the movie Transcendence.
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:16.984]  Millions of people have seen that movie and the idea's in their heads.
[01:48:16.984 --> 01:48:20.607]  So, you know, what did Rift do?
[01:48:20.607 --> 01:48:28.855]  They were assassinating the principal artificial brain researchers and sabotaging the artificial brain companies and so forth.
[01:48:28.855 --> 01:48:32.259]  So Google, IBM, etc., they need to, you know,
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:33.602]  Pay attention.
[01:48:33.602 --> 01:48:36.930]  This is something that will very probably happen in the 2020s.
[01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:38.414]  That's my prediction.
[01:48:38.414 --> 01:48:39.176]  That's my time frame.
[01:48:39.642 --> 01:48:52.114]  Talk to us a little bit about this conflict that you have, about wanting to build this massively intelligent, artificial intelligence, even though you think that it may have a dystopian outcome.
[01:48:52.114 --> 01:49:03.645]  The fact that you're concerned about this, you have arguments on both sides, for the Cosmists, as you call them, and as for the Terrans, who are opposed to this kind of, or concerned about how this is going to get out of hand.
[01:49:03.985 --> 01:49:07.886]  Yet you yourself describe yourself pretty much in the cosmos camp.
[01:49:07.886 --> 01:49:21.510]  You're really drawn to the idea, not that you're doing the research anymore, but you're drawn to the idea that we need to create these god-like artificial intelligences that may kill us.
[01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:24.511]  I find that paradox to be very interesting.
[01:49:24.511 --> 01:49:26.891]  Yeah, well, I'm torn.
[01:49:29.455 --> 01:49:32.737]  Well, a decade or two.
[01:49:32.737 --> 01:49:38.560]  I give lots of talks, and I still do, and I'll invite the audience to vote.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:43.723]  I'll say, okay, you've been presented with the arguments, pro and con, you know, should humanity build these artilects or not?
[01:49:43.723 --> 01:49:44.963]  Let's take a vote.
[01:49:44.963 --> 01:49:53.148]  And often the split would be pretty well 50-50, you know, pro-artilect and against building artilects.
[01:49:53.148 --> 01:49:57.090]  And then people after a while would come up to me and say, oh, Hugo,
[01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:58.791]  I'm so torn!
[01:49:58.791 --> 01:50:07.798]  You know, on the one hand, the idea that billions of human beings might get exterminated as a result of this, that absolutely horrifies me.
[01:50:07.798 --> 01:50:10.100]  And it does me too, of course, personally.
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:15.684]  And on the other hand, building these god-like creatures is like hypnotic, right?
[01:50:15.684 --> 01:50:19.988]  It's our pathetic, puny,
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:28.203]  Little human lives that get snuffed out in a mere 80 years in a universe that's billions of years old.
[01:50:28.203 --> 01:50:31.944]  You know, that's the kind of vision that the Cosmists had.
[01:50:31.944 --> 01:50:34.985]  They would be building gods that would be immortal.
[01:50:34.985 --> 01:50:36.585]  We've got to go up to commercial break.
[01:50:36.585 --> 01:50:37.546]  Hang on, Dr. Daguerreis.
[01:50:37.546 --> 01:50:38.666]  We've got to go to commercial break.
[01:50:38.666 --> 01:50:42.207]  We're going to come back with Dr. Hugo Daguerreis, artificial intelligence pioneer.
[01:50:42.207 --> 01:50:46.569]  We're talking about the first artificial intelligence wars, what that may be based on.
[01:50:46.849 --> 01:50:51.791]  We're going to talk when we come back about some of the objections that people have brought up to the idea that this could happen.
[01:50:51.791 --> 01:50:59.413]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:50:59.413 --> 01:51:02.394]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:52:05.428 --> 01:52:11.494]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:52:11.494 --> 01:52:12.895]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:52:12.895 --> 01:52:15.017]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.

[01:54:20.174 --> 01:54:20.775]  He's retired.
[01:54:21.555 --> 01:54:25.479]  Before we go back to him, I want to let you know that we have several specials up.
[01:54:25.479 --> 01:54:28.722]  We have a month of February special at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:53.100]  You'll find those February specials there.
[01:54:53.100 --> 01:55:01.022]  Dr. DeGaris, we've been talking about the coming conflict over artificial intelligence, whether or not we should proceed with that.
[01:55:01.022 --> 01:55:15.445]  One of the things that concerns me is that artificial intelligence as a weapon by a small elite group that we've seen, as we've talked about the military aspect, the military competition between different countries,
[01:55:16.132 --> 01:55:25.142]  We see really, I think, the thing that concerns me as an engineer, I can consistently see technology being used now in a very dark way.
[01:55:25.142 --> 01:55:37.114]  And I think it's because, as Eisenhower warned us with the military-industrial complex, we see really that DARPA and military-industrial complex has pretty much taken over research at the university, and I'm concerned that
[01:55:37.995 --> 01:55:47.082]  Whenever we see in the past, throughout history, whenever technology is widely disseminated, then we have liberty, we have freedom of the people.
[01:55:47.082 --> 01:55:54.647]  But when it is concentrated in the hands of a few, then we see that society trends towards tyranny and despotism.
[01:55:54.647 --> 01:55:58.790]  So, that's one of the things that concerns me about artificial intelligence.
[01:56:01.078 --> 01:56:11.063]  Well, personally, I have a real hatred of the International Central Banksters and all their cronies and all the horrible things they've done in the 20th century.
[01:56:11.063 --> 01:56:12.964]  I'd like to see those guys put behind bars.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.261]  I share a lot of your goals that way.
[01:56:18.261 --> 01:56:39.084]  One of the reasons why I see the Terrans becoming absolutely paranoid is that it may be technologically possible within a decade or so for just a small team of Cosmists in their basement to build artificial brains that then accelerate into hyper intelligence very quickly.
[01:56:39.084 --> 01:56:41.865]  So I can imagine the Terrans at government level
[01:56:43.070 --> 01:56:51.460]  There may be people at the governmental level that are using the work of the Cosmists for their own particular agenda.
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:53.162]  That's what really concerns me.
[01:57:01.212 --> 01:57:09.322]  Yeah, well, I've got a book chapter coming out pretty soon, How Will the Artilect War Start?
[01:57:09.322 --> 01:57:17.292]  You're trying to dream up various scenarios, and who knows, there may be even at government level, different governments, some Terran, some Cosmis,
[01:57:18.013 --> 01:57:22.615]  And eventually it goes nuclear, so there you get your gigadeth.
[01:57:22.615 --> 01:57:30.459]  So it's very hard to predict the detailed scenario that will actually unfold, but the debate will heat up in the late teens.
[01:57:30.459 --> 01:57:33.060]  It's starting now, right?
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:34.261]  In the twenties it'll get hot.
[01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:37.550]  In the 30s, I predict it'll go political.
[01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:41.292]  We'll be into what I call a fourth phase, the political phase.
[01:57:41.292 --> 01:57:46.375]  You'll start getting the terrorism and the sabotage and the assassinations and so forth.
[01:57:46.375 --> 01:57:49.836]  And then after that, well, it's very hard to predict.
[01:57:49.836 --> 01:57:58.361]  But it's such an issue that will dominate and divide humanity so bitterly because the two ideologies are just so powerful.
[01:57:58.361 --> 01:58:00.462]  On the one hand, you'd be building gods.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:05.785]  And on the other hand, you're risking the survival of the human species.
[01:58:05.785 --> 01:58:06.826]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:58:06.826 --> 01:58:15.775]  And the question is, just kind of like you mentioned, they were initially talking about your Twilight Zone movie, there was a Twilight Zone episode that was called To Serve Man.
[01:58:15.775 --> 01:58:23.323]  These aliens who come in and give this beneficial technology to people, and then at the end of the episode, somebody sneaks into the ship and sees that To Serve Man is actually a cookbook.
[01:58:24.043 --> 01:58:26.866]  And so that's what we always need to worry about with this.
[01:58:26.866 --> 01:58:27.567]  We're going to come back.
[01:58:27.567 --> 01:58:28.708]  We're going to take your phone calls.
[01:58:28.708 --> 01:58:32.492]  If you've got any questions for Dr. Hugo DeGaris, he's consented to take those.
[01:58:32.492 --> 01:58:32.932]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:32.932 --> 01:58:33.493]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:33.493 --> 01:58:39.799]  We're going to talk about some questions and objections that people have.
[01:58:39.799 --> 01:58:40.300]  Stay with us.
[01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:43.343]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.283 --> 01:58:51.604]  In the near future.
[01:58:51.604 --> 01:58:55.285]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:58:55.285 --> 01:58:56.125]  Security alert.
[01:58:56.125 --> 01:58:57.346]  Security alert.
[01:58:57.346 --> 01:58:59.346]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:58:59.346 --> 01:59:00.247]  Analysis.
[01:59:00.247 --> 01:59:00.967]  InfoWars.
[01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:02.927]  Building independent media operations.
[01:59:02.927 --> 01:59:07.929]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:59:07.929 --> 01:59:08.970]  Crime directive.
[01:59:08.970 --> 01:59:10.530]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:10.530 --> 01:59:13.371]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:13.371 --> 01:59:16.612]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:59:16.612 --> 01:59:18.793]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:19.093 --> 01:59:20.434]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:59:20.434 --> 01:59:23.275]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:23.275 --> 01:59:25.216]  They are never going to stop.
[01:59:25.216 --> 01:59:29.258]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:59:38.884 --> 01:59:43.766]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:59:43.766 --> 01:59:45.287]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:59:45.287 --> 01:59:46.047]  You can feel it.
[01:59:51.674 --> 01:59:54.283]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.171 --> 02:00:10.015]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.015 --> 02:00:11.596]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.596 --> 02:00:13.138]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.138 --> 02:00:17.341]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.341 --> 02:00:21.384]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.716 --> 02:00:26.017]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:26.017 --> 02:00:31.480]  I'm David Knight, your host, and we have with us from China, Dr. Hugo deGaris on the line.
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:38.984]  We've been talking about his book, The Artelect War, which is a scenario for the first wars over artificial intelligence.
[02:00:38.984 --> 02:00:41.565]  Whether or not we should proceed down that path.
[02:00:41.565 --> 02:00:43.026]  Two different factions.
[02:00:43.026 --> 02:00:44.907]  Of course, as we were talking about in the last segment,
[02:00:45.467 --> 02:00:52.111]  I'm also, I'm personally concerned, as we talk about quite often here at InfoWars, the misuse of technology.
[02:00:52.111 --> 02:00:57.875]  Technology being taken over by DARPA, by the military-industrial complex, and used for war.
[02:00:57.875 --> 02:01:01.538]  And of course, as Dr. DeGaris pointed out, he is against that as well.
[02:01:02.458 --> 02:01:06.699]  It is a force that is very difficult to keep that genie in the bottle.
[02:01:06.699 --> 02:01:13.981]  One of the arguments that he has in his book for why this will proceed, besides economic momentum, of course, is the military momentum.
[02:01:13.981 --> 02:01:18.683]  The fear that some other country will have that capability and you won't.
[02:01:18.683 --> 02:01:20.263]  So that drives that kind of development.
[02:01:20.683 --> 02:01:26.084]  But in this segment, I want to take calls from you, the listeners, 800-259-9231.
[02:01:26.084 --> 02:01:28.205]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:01:28.205 --> 02:01:30.845]  We'll take your calls through this half hour.
[02:01:30.845 --> 02:01:34.246]  Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us from the UK at the bottom of the hour.
[02:01:34.246 --> 02:01:41.628]  And I wanted to throw out to you, Dr. DeGaris, some of the objections that you address in the back of your book, for example.
[02:01:41.628 --> 02:01:46.909]  Why not cyborgs, like Ray Kurzweil talks about, man merging with machines?
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:02:04.764]  At the beginning of the book I tried to keep things simple, so I really only wanted like two camps, but in reality I accept there will be a third camp, the so-called cyborgs, cybernetic organisms.
[02:02:04.764 --> 02:02:07.765]  In other words, part machine and part human.
[02:02:07.765 --> 02:02:09.906]  I don't know if you can see this.
[02:02:15.081 --> 02:02:20.045]  I'm adding components to my own brain, and updating my own brain.
[02:02:20.045 --> 02:02:23.327]  I can become more capable, think faster, greater memory, and so forth.
[02:02:23.327 --> 02:02:29.271]  So, I think there will be millions of people with cyborgs.
[02:02:29.271 --> 02:02:34.855]  And the big dream of the cyborgs, of course, is that they want to become articulate gods themselves.
[02:02:34.855 --> 02:02:44.142]  Yes, and that's a large part of the research that we see being done by DARPA, augmenting humans with mechanical and means to create essentially a super soldier.
[02:02:45.031 --> 02:03:08.408]  Right, now the main argument against it is that if you take, you know, with nanotech, if you take, I don't know if you can see it, but imagine between my thumb and finger I have a single grain of sand, imagine, but it's been nanoteched so that it can manipulate one bit of information on one atom, okay, so one bit per atom.
[02:03:09.258 --> 02:03:11.178]  And this atom can switch back and forth.
[02:03:11.178 --> 02:03:12.579]  Excited, not excited.
[02:03:12.579 --> 02:03:13.839]  Excited, not excited.
[02:03:13.839 --> 02:03:16.440]  It can switch back and forth in a femtosecond.
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:20.120]  So that's a thousandth of a trillionth of a second.
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:26.002]  But you can calculate pretty readily how many atoms in a single grain of sand, let's say a cubic millimeter.
[02:03:26.002 --> 02:03:32.963]  When you do the math, it works out that that single grain of sand can outperform, in computer terms,
[02:03:33.792 --> 02:03:40.316]  The computing capacity estimated of the human brain by a factor of a quintillion.
[02:03:40.316 --> 02:03:45.659]  That's a million trillion times more than the brain.
[02:03:45.659 --> 02:03:56.205]  So my argument against the cosmos is that effectively, if they start adding these grains of sand to their own brain, very quickly, they're no longer human, right?
[02:03:56.205 --> 02:04:00.468]  They're artilects, maybe in human disguise, but effectively they're artilects.
[02:04:00.928 --> 02:04:10.936]  So from the point of view of the Terrans, they will just simply lump the cyborgists, the people who want to be cyborgs, and the Cosmists into the same camp.
[02:04:10.936 --> 02:04:13.177]  They're effectively the same group.
[02:04:13.177 --> 02:04:22.464]  Because once the technology becomes advanced enough, there's not much difference between a pure machine, a pure artilect, and a cyborg.
[02:04:22.464 --> 02:04:23.545]  Effectively they're the same.
[02:04:24.165 --> 02:04:30.613]  So really, I get back to the two major camps, the Cosmists on the one hand, and the Terrans on the other.
[02:04:31.710 --> 02:04:33.130]  Okay, we've got to go to a commercial break.
[02:04:33.130 --> 02:04:34.791]  We've got the phone lines lit up.
[02:04:34.791 --> 02:04:36.431]  We've got a lot of people who want to ask you calls.
[02:04:36.431 --> 02:04:41.633]  When we come back, I've got one more question I want to ask you that we'll briefly address, and then we can go to our callers.
[02:04:41.633 --> 02:04:44.773]  And that is, why not do what Isaac Asimov said?
[02:04:44.773 --> 02:04:48.634]  Why not have a positronic brain with preventative laws of robots?
[02:04:48.634 --> 02:04:50.355]  Essentially a kill switch.
[02:04:50.355 --> 02:04:52.675]  So we'll get Dr. DeGarris' answer.
[02:04:52.675 --> 02:04:54.356]  I've read his answer in the book.
[02:04:54.356 --> 02:04:56.676]  You can get that book as The Artelect War.
[02:04:56.676 --> 02:04:58.077]  Cosmis vs. Terran.
[02:04:58.077 --> 02:04:58.437]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.437 --> 02:04:59.417]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[02:04:59.497 --> 02:05:03.018]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:03.018 --> 02:05:07.300]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:09.080]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:14.402]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[02:05:14.402 --> 02:05:16.943]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[02:05:16.943 --> 02:05:18.084]  But for how long?
[02:05:18.084 --> 02:05:20.945]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[02:05:20.945 --> 02:05:24.766]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:05:28.936 --> 02:05:32.457]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:32.457 --> 02:05:40.700]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:46.102]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:05:46.102 --> 02:05:48.623]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:05:48.623 --> 02:05:50.744]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:05:58.968 --> 02:06:07.880]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:14.470]  NASA has already set the countdown timer and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[02:06:14.990 --> 02:06:18.472]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[02:06:18.472 --> 02:06:20.113]  population could perish.
[02:06:20.113 --> 02:06:23.574]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[02:06:23.574 --> 02:06:25.835]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[02:06:25.835 --> 02:06:27.476]  Mass riots will follow.
[02:06:27.476 --> 02:06:29.637]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[02:06:29.637 --> 02:06:33.719]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[02:06:33.719 --> 02:06:39.402]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones,

[02:07:53.194 --> 02:07:53.714]  Silver Bullet.
[02:08:02.371 --> 02:08:07.294]  For 50 years, we've told them what to eat, what to drink, what to wear.
[02:08:07.294 --> 02:08:09.955]  But Christ's sake, Ben, don't you understand?
[02:08:09.955 --> 02:08:12.216]  Americans love television.
[02:08:12.216 --> 02:08:13.837]  They wean their kids on it.
[02:08:13.837 --> 02:08:16.018]  Listen, they love game shows.
[02:08:16.018 --> 02:08:17.419]  They love wrestling.
[02:08:17.419 --> 02:08:20.340]  They love sports and violence.
[02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:22.581]  So what do we do?
[02:08:22.581 --> 02:08:24.122]  We give them what they want!
[02:08:25.786 --> 02:08:27.007]  We're number one, Ben!
[02:08:27.007 --> 02:08:29.069]  That's all that counts!
[02:08:29.069 --> 02:08:32.211]  Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years!
[02:08:32.211 --> 02:08:35.854]  Well, I haven't been in show business as long as you have, Killian.
[02:08:35.854 --> 02:08:37.975]  But I'm a quick learner.
[02:08:37.975 --> 02:08:41.798]  So I'm going to give the audience what I think they want.
[02:08:41.798 --> 02:08:47.803]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:08:53.103 --> 02:08:54.484]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:54.484 --> 02:08:55.145]  I'm David Knight.
[02:08:55.145 --> 02:08:57.787]  We have with us Dr. Hugo de Guerras.
[02:08:57.787 --> 02:08:58.948]  He's on the line from China.
[02:08:58.948 --> 02:09:03.893]  He has been a pioneer researcher in the field of artificial intelligence.
[02:09:03.893 --> 02:09:07.056]  Also, especially in the subfield of evolvable hardware.
[02:09:07.056 --> 02:09:10.379]  We haven't really talked about that, but he does cover that quite a bit in his book, The Artilect War.
[02:09:10.999 --> 02:09:25.145]  We were looking at how this might go down badly, because that was the central thesis of his book, The Art-Like-War, how artificial intelligence would become essentially self-aware, as we've seen in the Terminator movie.
[02:09:25.145 --> 02:09:29.367]  That's probably the most famous example in pop culture.
[02:09:29.367 --> 02:09:32.328]  There are a lot of people who are concerned that this may go down badly.
[02:09:32.328 --> 02:09:36.850]  We've got Elon Musk setting up a $10 million foundation to try to make sure that
[02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:44.754]  Artificial intelligence stays under control, but Dr. DeGaris doesn't believe that it can be controlled in the long term.
[02:09:44.754 --> 02:09:46.896]  And I guess, Dr. DeGaris, we're going to take some phone calls.
[02:09:46.896 --> 02:09:48.016]  People have questions.
[02:09:48.016 --> 02:09:49.637]  One quick question.
[02:09:49.637 --> 02:09:52.639]  Many people have asked you in the past, why not just design a kill switch?
[02:09:52.639 --> 02:10:00.684]  Why not put something like Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics inside of these artificial intelligences to keep them under control?
[02:10:02.847 --> 02:10:26.849]  Well there's a big debate going on right now amongst the specialists and they call the concept friendly AI and personally I think it's I'm very cynical that this can be done I mean what you're talking about is designing a machine so that it remains human friendly no matter how advanced it when it redesigns itself in the future so machine one
[02:10:27.568 --> 02:10:29.810]  I mean, it's just so arrogant and it's just a fuss.
[02:10:46.408 --> 02:10:52.872]  Now, at the beginning, perhaps the brain builders can create a friendly AI to begin with.
[02:10:52.872 --> 02:11:03.018]  But once these machines start becoming really smart and they redesign themselves and so forth, the idea that they will always remain human-friendly, I just find ridiculous.
[02:11:03.018 --> 02:11:05.920]  Once they get to the level of human intelligence, we're going to have the same problem we have with humans.
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:08.101]  We've got a lot of humans who are not human-friendly, don't we?
[02:11:08.101 --> 02:11:08.882]  Right.
[02:11:08.882 --> 02:11:11.403]  Let's go to some of the callers and give them a chance to ask some questions.
[02:11:11.403 --> 02:11:13.745]  Let's go to Artie in Canada.
[02:11:13.745 --> 02:11:14.225]  Artie, go ahead.
[02:11:15.287 --> 02:11:17.148]  Thank you, David.
[02:11:17.148 --> 02:11:30.235]  The author Annie Jacobson is completing a trilogy of books when she publishes her third book this fall, and it's all about her research into DARPA and Pentagon development of artificial intelligence.
[02:11:30.235 --> 02:11:33.857]  And she said that it was this research that scared her the most.
[02:11:33.857 --> 02:11:40.060]  I'm wondering if Dr. DeGarig was contacted by Annie Jacobson.
[02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:41.561]  No, no.
[02:11:41.561 --> 02:11:43.042]  I've not heard that name before.
[02:11:44.525 --> 02:11:48.927]  Dr. DeGaris has been in China before he retired.
[02:11:48.927 --> 02:11:59.312]  He was in China, so probably you weren't really involved with the DARPA project, but every government is essentially going to be going down this military path, aren't they, Dr. DeGaris?
[02:11:59.312 --> 02:12:02.194]  Well, I know the Chinese are.
[02:12:02.194 --> 02:12:09.678]  There's a whole bunch of billionaires in China, in Beijing, and they're getting into this
[02:12:11.710 --> 02:12:22.233]  And Ben Goertzel probably may set up an AGI institute, that's quite likely, in the near future in Beijing.
[02:12:22.233 --> 02:12:28.415]  So the rivalry is heating up between China and America on this kind of stuff.
[02:12:28.415 --> 02:12:34.297]  Like I say, one side does not have the luxury to allow the other side to get too far ahead of it.
[02:12:34.297 --> 02:12:35.898]  So it'll be a kind of ratcheting up.
[02:12:37.901 --> 02:12:38.963]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:12:38.963 --> 02:12:41.527]  As we've seen in every other kind of arms race.
[02:12:41.527 --> 02:12:43.390]  Artie, was there anything else that you wanted to add to that?
[02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:50.041]  As you point out, somebody wrote a book, they said the thing that scared them most in terms of researching DARPA was the artificial intelligence aspect.
[02:12:50.041 --> 02:12:51.123]  Was there anything else you wanted to add to that?
[02:12:52.102 --> 02:13:11.198]  Well, as a Christian, I don't believe that artificial intelligence can take on selfhood unless it were actually possessed by a spiritual entity, because only selfhood and will are intrinsic only to a spiritual entirety.
[02:13:12.455 --> 02:13:14.496]  Yeah, I would kind of follow along that line.
[02:13:14.496 --> 02:13:16.277]  I would phrase it a little bit differently as a Christian.
[02:13:16.277 --> 02:13:27.703]  I look at it and I say, well, you know, we make the arguments about increased computational power and Moore's Law, but essentially, you know, computational power doesn't necessarily get you to consciousness.
[02:13:27.703 --> 02:13:36.388]  I know that you take a different view of that, Dr. DeGaris, that you believe that it will eventually happen, because you're looking at it from a strictly physical standpoint.
[02:13:36.388 --> 02:13:40.050]  We're looking at it from a, I guess you could say, more medical, metaphysical standpoint.
[02:13:42.572 --> 02:13:47.653]  Yeah, philosophically, I'm a physicalist.
[02:13:47.653 --> 02:13:49.294]  Human babies get built, of course.
[02:13:49.294 --> 02:13:57.156]  They start off as a fertilized single egg, and it multiplies and multiplies, you know, 2, 4, 8, 16, 13, to 100 trillion cells.
[02:13:57.156 --> 02:14:00.897]  But the whole thing gets built, and that's what DNA is all about.
[02:14:00.897 --> 02:14:07.059]  It's a kind of self-assembly instruction molecule, a piece of software, if you like.
[02:14:07.059 --> 02:14:11.600]  And all that software and all those cells, they're all just molecules, right?
[02:14:13.221 --> 02:14:19.644]  At that scale of things, there's not much difference between a machine, with all its carbon and so forth, and a human being.
[02:14:19.644 --> 02:14:20.684]  It's all molecules.
[02:14:20.684 --> 02:14:25.407]  It's just a different structure of molecules.
[02:14:25.407 --> 02:14:27.468]  I'm not religious in that sense.
[02:14:27.468 --> 02:14:29.649]  I consider that from a bygone age.
[02:14:30.336 --> 02:14:31.557]  Well, yeah, I would agree with you.
[02:14:31.557 --> 02:14:43.301]  I don't want to turn this into a religious discussion, but yeah, I don't have a intellectual problem with God because I see intelligent design there.
[02:14:43.301 --> 02:14:46.403]  So I believe that these things are not self-organized.
[02:14:46.403 --> 02:14:51.905]  The components of an artificial brain aren't going to assemble themselves on a desk.
[02:14:51.905 --> 02:14:54.766]  It needs a designer like you, for example, to put it together.
[02:14:55.666 --> 02:15:24.876]  Well in terms of ID, Intelligent Design, I'm very open to that because the math and physics, see I now teach PhD level math and physics and so I know a lot of that stuff and personally, now just my personal view, that I wouldn't be at all surprised that the laws of physics have been actually designed and I'm deeply suspicious that that's the case because why on earth is the universe, why are the laws of physics so deeply mathematical?
[02:15:26.957 --> 02:15:28.198]  That was Crick and Watson.
[02:15:28.198 --> 02:15:32.381]  At least one of them put out the idea of panspermia after he looked at DNA.
[02:15:32.381 --> 02:15:33.522]  He said, hey, this is a program.
[02:15:33.522 --> 02:15:35.003]  This is built.
[02:15:35.003 --> 02:15:40.887]  Of course, he didn't want to embrace the God of the Bible, so he created some aliens who would come and do that.
[02:15:40.887 --> 02:15:42.708]  But I want to get back to some of the other calls.
[02:15:42.708 --> 02:15:44.430]  Let's go to Brian in Indiana.
[02:15:44.430 --> 02:15:44.710]  Brian?
[02:15:44.710 --> 02:15:47.992]  Are you still there?
[02:15:47.992 --> 02:15:50.134]  OK, let's go to JD in Mississippi.
[02:15:53.504 --> 02:15:55.885]  Okay, well let's go to Michael in Missouri.
[02:15:55.885 --> 02:15:58.505]  Michael, go ahead.
[02:15:58.505 --> 02:15:59.766]  Yeah, how you doing David?
[02:15:59.766 --> 02:16:01.346]  Good, go ahead.
[02:16:01.346 --> 02:16:08.088]  Yeah, first I just want to say something that you'll probably be interested in just real quick before I ask my question.
[02:16:08.088 --> 02:16:15.749]  I have a friend named Josh and we set up a GoFundMe.com slash The Promised Land fund for him.
[02:16:15.749 --> 02:16:18.250]  It's just all about this medical tyranny.
[02:16:18.250 --> 02:16:19.170]  I don't want to explain it.
[02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:20.991]  People can go there.
[02:16:20.991 --> 02:16:22.231]  It's GoFundMe.
[02:16:23.007 --> 02:16:23.687]  That's good.
[02:16:23.687 --> 02:16:26.609]  Yeah, do you have a question for Dr. DeGaris on Artificial Intelligence?
[02:16:26.609 --> 02:16:28.770]  Well, what's the premise of that book?
[02:16:52.347 --> 02:17:04.735]  Where most of the population live in huge cities all over the country and they travel on up cars through tubes and there's a small population of people who don't have any chips in them.
[02:17:04.735 --> 02:17:07.397]  Oh, kind of like Agenda 21 in other words.
[02:17:07.397 --> 02:17:10.819]  I've read that book too.
[02:17:10.819 --> 02:17:12.540]  Dr. DeGaris, did you have any comment on that?
[02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:15.162]  It's a little bit off topic.
[02:17:15.162 --> 02:17:19.264]  I've not read that particular book but I'm scared stiff of this idea of chipping the population.
[02:17:21.226 --> 02:17:24.307]  What the New World Order is all about, that scares me crazy.
[02:17:24.307 --> 02:17:26.907]  Yes, yes, we share that concern, absolutely.
[02:17:26.907 --> 02:17:28.348]  Let's go to Eric in Michigan.
[02:17:28.348 --> 02:17:30.108]  Eric.
[02:17:30.108 --> 02:17:32.508]  Hi Dave, thanks for taking my call.
[02:17:32.508 --> 02:17:42.891]  Dr. Hugo, I've heard you a number of times today refer to these machines as gods, as creating gods.
[02:17:45.487 --> 02:17:56.876]  Also, you're referring to the human race as having feeble lives, and the fact that our lives are so short.
[02:17:56.876 --> 02:17:58.557]  I don't know.
[02:17:58.557 --> 02:18:08.625]  Wouldn't we be the gods if we're the ones that are creating the machines, just like many people believe that a god created our universe?
[02:18:12.705 --> 02:18:15.106]  Well, I think Dr. Garrison, do you want to address that?
[02:18:15.106 --> 02:18:21.330]  I think your idea is that once they get to a certain level, they would transcend us.
[02:18:21.330 --> 02:18:21.870]  Yes.
[02:18:21.870 --> 02:18:22.531]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:18:22.531 --> 02:18:23.711]  That's the obvious answer.
[02:18:23.711 --> 02:18:28.074]  I mean, obviously we, as humans, we would be the parents.
[02:18:28.074 --> 02:18:29.855]  We would kick off.
[02:18:29.855 --> 02:18:31.196]  We would start the process.
[02:18:32.188 --> 02:18:38.132]  And then very quickly, they would just gather their own momentum and just do it themselves.
[02:18:38.132 --> 02:18:42.456]  And very quickly, we human beings, we wouldn't be able to understand what they were doing.
[02:18:42.456 --> 02:18:45.098]  I mean, they're thinking a million times faster than we are.
[02:18:45.098 --> 02:18:48.400]  They're growing their circuitry at a rate that we couldn't understand.
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:52.743]  They could rearrange their circuitry and architecture in like milliseconds.
[02:18:52.743 --> 02:18:54.985]  We would just be absolutely lost.
[02:18:55.345 --> 02:18:57.686]  But yes, we are at square zero.
[02:18:57.686 --> 02:19:03.010]  We start the process, we kick it off, and then it goes ahead on its own momentum.
[02:19:03.010 --> 02:19:13.036]  The idea that once it gets to a certain level of intelligence and capable of independent thought that you would have something similar to what we saw portrayed in the movie Terminator when Skynet becomes self-aware or
[02:19:13.736 --> 02:19:19.323]  You might think of the intelligence as reaching a critical mass, if you want to use a nuclear analogy.
[02:19:19.323 --> 02:19:22.947]  Once it reaches a critical mass, all of a sudden it just explodes and starts to go.
[02:19:22.947 --> 02:19:29.275]  And as you point out, the real question is whether or not it's going to happen quickly or over a slower period of time.
[02:19:29.275 --> 02:19:30.697]  Let's go to Dennis in Colorado.
[02:19:30.697 --> 02:19:30.937]  Dennis.
[02:19:31.818 --> 02:19:33.960]  Oh wait, we've got to go to a commercial break.
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:35.241]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:35.241 --> 02:19:42.427]  We're talking to Dr. Hugo DeGaris about the possibility of an artificial intelligence war.
[02:19:42.427 --> 02:19:47.912]  One fought over the development of artificial intelligence or perhaps one fought with artificial intelligence.
[02:19:47.912 --> 02:19:48.793]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:19:59.386 --> 02:20:01.988]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[02:20:01.988 --> 02:20:03.069]  Get back to nature.

[02:20:30.097 --> 02:20:33.959]  Before using Heart and Body Extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[02:20:33.959 --> 02:20:37.221]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[02:20:37.221 --> 02:20:38.742]  I was tired and lethargic.
[02:20:38.742 --> 02:20:46.427]  But after taking Heart and Body Extract, my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.

[02:23:27.410 --> 02:23:28.591]  It's happening again.
[02:23:28.591 --> 02:23:32.194]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[02:23:32.194 --> 02:23:35.616]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.

[02:23:54.091 --> 02:23:55.131]  Come and take it.
[02:24:14.913 --> 02:24:16.174]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:16.174 --> 02:24:20.776]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Dr. Hugo DeGaris, one of the pioneers in Artificial Intelligence.
[02:24:20.776 --> 02:24:27.459]  We're talking to him about his book, The Ardilek War, about the first war of Artificial Intelligence.
[02:24:27.459 --> 02:24:31.160]  Actually, a war over whether Artificial Intelligence should be developed.
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:32.181]  Whether or not we're going to have...
[02:24:33.221 --> 02:24:37.322]  Super intelligent machines that might threaten the existence of mankind.
[02:24:37.322 --> 02:24:45.984]  Dr. DeGaris takes a dystopian view of the long term over artificial intelligence versus Ray Kurzweil's decidedly utopian view.
[02:24:45.984 --> 02:24:48.344]  I want to get to your calls and questions.
[02:24:48.344 --> 02:24:49.905]  We just have them for one more second.
[02:24:49.905 --> 02:24:51.665]  So let's try to go through these as quickly as we can.
[02:24:51.665 --> 02:24:53.785]  Let's go to Al in Arkansas.
[02:24:53.785 --> 02:24:53.845]  Al.
[02:24:56.897 --> 02:25:11.889]  Dr. Daguerres, I guess not as much of a question as it is a comment as a Christian, but I believe that when man exalts himself to a situation of trying to make himself God, that we will suffer God's wrath.
[02:25:11.889 --> 02:25:13.510]  Do you have any comment about that?
[02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:18.414]  And that's just my question, I guess.
[02:25:18.414 --> 02:25:21.436]  Well, I'm not religious.
[02:25:23.544 --> 02:25:30.607]  Humanity has invented about a hundred thousand different gods over the broad sweep of history and over the planet.
[02:25:30.607 --> 02:25:34.349]  Every primitive little tribe invents its own gods.
[02:25:34.349 --> 02:25:38.831]  So I'm somewhat cynical of one particular... Like, everyone's an atheist.
[02:25:38.831 --> 02:25:40.032]  You've probably heard this argument before.
[02:25:40.032 --> 02:25:45.975]  Everyone's an atheist with respect to the 99.9999% of gods that they don't believe in.
[02:25:45.975 --> 02:25:48.056]  And the atheist just goes one step further.
[02:25:49.918 --> 02:26:02.207]  Okay, yeah, that's, I think what the caller is getting at is the, actually goes back to one of the first stories in the Bible, Garden of Eden, where the promise was you'll become like God, and I guess that's always been an enticement to motivate people.
[02:26:02.207 --> 02:26:04.888]  Let's go to JD in Mississippi.
[02:26:04.888 --> 02:26:08.591]  JD, you had a question about drones for Dr. Hugo DeGaris.
[02:26:08.591 --> 02:26:09.492]  Go ahead.
[02:26:09.492 --> 02:26:15.095]  Yes, I was wondering, I might be a little bit naive on the subject, but how will
[02:26:16.365 --> 02:26:21.249]  How will they get by the failsafe switch or the kill switch?
[02:26:21.249 --> 02:26:26.014]  And also, how will drones refuel themselves?
[02:26:26.014 --> 02:26:29.977]  Or will they just have so many of them that it won't matter?
[02:26:29.977 --> 02:26:32.980]  You know, will they just, you know, there'll be so many of them that
[02:26:33.652 --> 02:26:35.474]  Yeah, it's like a swarm.
[02:26:35.474 --> 02:26:38.897]  Well, Dr. DeGaris is really kind of talking about a different kind of thing.
[02:26:38.897 --> 02:26:42.119]  He's talking about massively intelligent artificial intelligence.
[02:26:42.119 --> 02:26:52.628]  But of course, autonomous drones, that is maybe one way that we may see some manifestation of some early artificial intelligence, isn't it, Dr. DeGaris?
[02:26:52.628 --> 02:26:54.490]  Well, I mentioned drones.
[02:26:54.490 --> 02:26:56.031]  In fact, I think it's already been done.
[02:26:56.031 --> 02:26:57.933]  I'm not an expert in this field.
[02:26:57.933 --> 02:27:00.335]  But there are drones, like
[02:27:00.919 --> 02:27:01.139]  This is
[02:27:18.626 --> 02:27:18.986]  We're good to go.
[02:27:37.479 --> 02:27:40.121]  Governments have a really hard time keeping anything secret.
[02:27:40.121 --> 02:27:40.741]  Yes, true.
[02:27:40.741 --> 02:27:43.083]  I hope that kind of thing happens.
[02:27:43.083 --> 02:27:46.785]  What we're seeing right now with drones is essentially like remote control killing devices.
[02:27:46.785 --> 02:27:54.330]  We even had an article earlier this week that was on the Drudge Report about some police departments using remote control mechanical cops.
[02:27:54.330 --> 02:27:57.632]  I mean, that's not what we're talking about here in terms of artificial intelligence.
[02:27:57.632 --> 02:28:05.437]  But, you know, that is, I think, what most people are thinking about in terms of the projection of power, the concentration of power.
[02:28:05.857 --> 02:28:07.899]  Let's go quickly to Brian in Indiana.
[02:28:07.899 --> 02:28:09.660]  Brian?
[02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:10.440]  Hello?
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:11.961]  Hello, go ahead.
[02:28:11.961 --> 02:28:13.723]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:28:13.723 --> 02:28:14.904]  Thanks, David.
[02:28:14.904 --> 02:28:30.955]  My question was about the possible malevolence versus benevolence of AI, you know, as seen in Isaac Asimov's The Last Question, if you're familiar with the story, versus like, what do you call it, I'm sorry, Prey by Michael Crichton, if you're familiar with that story too.
[02:28:34.676 --> 02:28:37.800]  I'm not clear on what the question is.
[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:41.605]  I think he's asking maybe the AIs will be benevolent.
[02:28:41.605 --> 02:28:51.137]  I know that the movie that recently came out, Ray Kurzweil was very excited about that because basically they reached a point where they say, yeah, you guys are fine, but you're really not very interesting.
[02:28:51.137 --> 02:28:53.300]  They just basically go off on their own and do their own thing.
[02:28:55.356 --> 02:28:56.576]  Well, I see both.
[02:28:56.576 --> 02:28:59.857]  I mean, obviously there'll be real benefits.
[02:28:59.857 --> 02:29:06.099]  We can get rid of cancer and disease and aging and all this wonderful nano stuff on the positive side.
[02:29:06.099 --> 02:29:07.419]  I don't deny that.
[02:29:07.419 --> 02:29:09.820]  There'll be definitely both aspects.
[02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:12.420]  But it's the negative that really worries me.
[02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:21.183]  Once these machines become massively intelligent, then who's to say that they may look on us as pests and decide to wipe us out?
[02:29:21.183 --> 02:29:22.203]  That's what really worries me.
[02:29:22.563 --> 02:29:31.128]  Yes, and I'm concerned, as I know you are, Dr. DeGaris, as to what our governments are going to do with the technology that we hand them.
[02:29:31.128 --> 02:29:39.373]  That's why I think it's a very interesting paradox for people who are in engineering and science to think about the consequences of what they're developing.
[02:29:39.373 --> 02:29:41.794]  Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Hugo DeGaris.
[02:29:41.794 --> 02:29:43.935]  Again, that book is The Artillac War.
[02:29:43.935 --> 02:29:46.217]  Ten years old, but very relevant today.
[02:29:46.217 --> 02:29:47.377]  Today it's in the discussion.
[02:29:47.377 --> 02:29:49.939]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:29:49.939 --> 02:29:50.339]  Stay with us.
[02:29:52.441 --> 02:29:55.148]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.315 --> 02:30:02.697]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[02:30:02.697 --> 02:30:06.200]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:12.304]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:30:12.304 --> 02:30:13.685]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:30:13.685 --> 02:30:15.906]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[02:30:15.906 --> 02:30:17.487]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:30:17.487 --> 02:30:22.270]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[02:30:22.270 --> 02:30:26.853]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.

[02:33:03.382 --> 02:33:21.834]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:31.647 --> 02:33:33.151]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:33.151 --> 02:33:36.619]  I'm David Knight and joining me in the studio right now is Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:33:37.213 --> 02:33:42.655]  You know, we talk, we have the bumper music from Tennessee, Henry Ford's about 16 tons, 16 tons.
[02:33:42.655 --> 02:33:43.176]  What do you get?
[02:33:43.176 --> 02:33:45.496]  Well, he's got an article up.
[02:33:45.496 --> 02:33:47.017]  2,500 tons of fake food.
[02:33:47.017 --> 02:33:48.358]  Tell us about that, Anthony.
[02:33:48.358 --> 02:33:48.898]  That's right.
[02:33:48.898 --> 02:33:57.722]  So, overall, we keep hearing about all of these, you know, horse meat substitutes being put into burgers and everything, but it turns out it's much, much, much worse than that.
[02:33:57.722 --> 02:34:00.883]  And Interpol, with Europol, seized 2,500 tons of actually fake food.
[02:34:03.604 --> 02:34:17.311]  Not just bad fast food, we're talking about vodka that was made in antifreeze containers that had antifreeze in it, and they would scrub it out with different chemicals, get rid of the scent, put vodka in it, and sell it as premium brands across the world.
[02:34:17.311 --> 02:34:17.631]  Wow.
[02:34:17.631 --> 02:34:23.614]  And they had seafood, they had lobsters being sold, they were completely fake, mineral water, dietary supplements.
[02:34:23.614 --> 02:34:30.618]  As we found out from New York, the Attorney General found that about 80% of the supplements you get at Walmart and stuff like that and pharmaceutical drugstores
[02:34:31.218 --> 02:34:32.679]  Are actually completely fake.
[02:34:32.679 --> 02:34:36.021]  So this is just one investigation that lasted two months.
[02:34:36.021 --> 02:34:41.004]  They found 2,500 tons of completely fraudulent fake food.
[02:34:41.004 --> 02:34:46.547]  And people are thinking that they're getting nutritious items or counting their calories, everything.
[02:34:46.547 --> 02:34:58.694]  It turns out that in many cases, you're not even eating what you think you are, let alone trying to avoid the additives and everything, which just blows my mind and highlights everything we continue to talk about to know what you're actually getting every single time.
[02:34:58.954 --> 02:34:59.535]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:34:59.535 --> 02:35:07.821]  We talk about this vaccine thing and a lot of people lecture us on, you know, well this is how vaccines work, you know, they create a response in the body and the body creates antibodies and everything.
[02:35:07.821 --> 02:35:09.262]  We're not talking about that.
[02:35:09.262 --> 02:35:15.267]  We're talking about the fast food french fries that are not simply potatoes, if they even have potatoes in them.
[02:35:15.487 --> 02:35:20.350]  Because they've added all kinds of preservatives to them, they've added some of the ingredients to Silly Putty or whatever.
[02:35:20.350 --> 02:35:28.795]  You've got the situation that we talked about covered on the news in Iceland, where McDonald's shut down in Iceland in 2009.
[02:35:28.795 --> 02:35:31.516]  On the last day, a guy went in and bought a cheeseburger and fries.
[02:35:31.516 --> 02:35:33.657]  He's had it under a glass container.
[02:35:33.657 --> 02:35:36.179]  You can watch a live stream of that on the internet.
[02:35:36.179 --> 02:35:38.680]  It hasn't changed in appearance now for six years.
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:41.802]  So, you know, we're not talking about, you know, it's all about
[02:35:42.282 --> 02:35:43.623]  The full spectrum.
[02:35:43.623 --> 02:35:49.167]  Even when we talk about vaccines, we're talking about what has been added to them or doing them in combination.
[02:35:49.167 --> 02:35:50.487]  I mean, a lot of different aspects of it.
[02:35:50.487 --> 02:35:53.229]  It's not just as simple as like, well, you know, this is food.
[02:35:53.229 --> 02:35:55.671]  The food is used by your body to build bones and everything.
[02:35:55.671 --> 02:35:58.693]  It's like, no, there's other stuff in the food as well.
[02:35:59.113 --> 02:36:00.274]  Even if it is food.
[02:36:00.274 --> 02:36:05.315]  Exactly, and I want to go through the list of top items that have been found to be completely counterfeit.
[02:36:05.315 --> 02:36:06.996]  Number one is seafood.
[02:36:06.996 --> 02:36:08.677]  Number two is mineral water.
[02:36:08.677 --> 02:36:12.178]  Three dietary supplements with the herbs that aren't actually in the supplement.
[02:36:12.178 --> 02:36:14.079]  They find it necessary to fake water?
[02:36:14.079 --> 02:36:15.759]  Absolutely!
[02:36:15.759 --> 02:36:22.482]  Well, it's big business because they can just take tap water and dump it in a bottle of water, usually plastic full of BPA, and sell it for three dollars.
[02:36:22.482 --> 02:36:24.303]  You know, it's a total empire.
[02:36:24.303 --> 02:36:25.563]  Mozzarella.
[02:36:25.563 --> 02:36:27.184]  Obviously from Italy that was a big issue.
[02:36:27.998 --> 02:36:29.959]  Pharmaceutical drugs.
[02:36:29.959 --> 02:36:33.582]  So you think you're taking Viagra, but you're actually taking a sugar pill.
[02:36:33.582 --> 02:36:39.986]  Or there's numerous scheme systems that get shut down online every year where they give you actually arsenic or something terrible like that.
[02:36:39.986 --> 02:36:42.808]  Eggs, dried fruit, and cooking oil.
[02:36:42.808 --> 02:36:45.810]  And you might say, well, there's no way we can actually do anything about this.
[02:36:45.810 --> 02:36:57.738]  But the director for the food regulation companies, he said, he went out and said in an article with Time Magazine, that the answer is to actually eat organic and natural food products.
[02:36:58.438 --> 02:37:00.219]  And you might be wondering, why is that?
[02:37:00.219 --> 02:37:07.483]  It's because these counterfeiters from, you know, Thailand and everything, what they do is they go after the big corporate brand names.
[02:37:07.483 --> 02:37:09.124]  Because there's just so much out there.
[02:37:09.124 --> 02:37:16.628]  You know, there's, let's say Coca-Cola or something, there's so much Coca-Cola out there that it's impossible to actually test and screen all the Coca-Cola brands and everything like that.
[02:37:16.628 --> 02:37:18.329]  Well, we've seen that in China.
[02:37:18.329 --> 02:37:25.333]  They go in and they'll reproduce somebody's brand very precisely and then put garbage in it, which actually creates liability for the companies.
[02:37:25.353 --> 02:37:31.878]  They were having some automotive brakes that they went in and basically instead of it being brakes, it was just paper.
[02:37:31.878 --> 02:37:37.963]  People were buying this and putting it on their car because the packaging looked the same, the product looked the same, but it was nothing but paper.
[02:37:37.963 --> 02:37:46.611]  And then when they had a car accident because of these faulty brakes, they sue the real manufacturer of this, which they thought they were buying.
[02:37:46.611 --> 02:37:49.333]  They thought they got a defective product from these other people.
[02:37:49.333 --> 02:37:50.474]  It's really rampant.
[02:37:50.834 --> 02:37:51.214]  Exactly.
[02:37:51.214 --> 02:37:54.575]  So they just take over this corporate food system and take advantage of it.
[02:37:54.575 --> 02:37:59.137]  But if you're buying actually local organic quality foods, you're not going to experience this.
[02:37:59.137 --> 02:38:02.238]  And it reminds me of how you did an amazing report on this.
[02:38:02.238 --> 02:38:06.699]  McDonald's, some economists say that they could go bankrupt within the next five to ten years.
[02:38:07.159 --> 02:38:07.859]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:38:07.859 --> 02:38:10.980]  It's because people don't want fake food anymore.
[02:38:10.980 --> 02:38:11.321]  Yeah.
[02:38:11.321 --> 02:38:12.761]  They are not settling for it.
[02:38:12.761 --> 02:38:17.563]  They're saying, I'm absolutely not going to risk getting any freeze bottles.
[02:38:17.563 --> 02:38:23.045]  I'm not going to risk getting some of these ingredients I like to talk about that are in many common McDonald's food items.
[02:38:23.385 --> 02:38:25.666]  Because that's a form of fake food too.
[02:38:25.666 --> 02:38:27.267]  That's a fake form of food.
[02:38:27.267 --> 02:38:30.389]  It comes down to the point where you've got to trust your source.
[02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:41.876]  You know, we try to get these independent third parties, whether it's government or it's an independent watchdog agency, to vet the things that we're buying to see if they're safe, to see if it's authentic or whatever.
[02:38:42.256 --> 02:38:55.622]  That's why I think so many times these large corporations will make the calculation that, hey, I can save a penny or two if I throw this synthetic dangerous substance in here to give me a little bit longer shelf life.
[02:38:55.622 --> 02:38:59.925]  And they'll make that calculation because they're selling it in such large quantity it makes a difference to them.
[02:38:59.925 --> 02:39:00.625]  Whereas if you work
[02:39:01.045 --> 02:39:11.172]  With a local business, I go to a local restaurant or something, I'm thinking, they're not as likely to adulterate their products in a dangerous way to save a couple of pennies, because it simply isn't going to be worth it for them.
[02:39:11.172 --> 02:39:15.495]  For the large corporations, it may be a calculation that somebody says, we'll go with that risk.
[02:39:15.495 --> 02:39:16.415]  That's exactly right.
[02:39:16.415 --> 02:39:20.498]  Two pennies to McDonald's per ingredient is a big, big, big deal.
[02:39:20.498 --> 02:39:20.818]  That's right.
[02:39:20.818 --> 02:39:22.980]  And that goes back to why I think they're failing.
[02:39:22.980 --> 02:39:29.024]  I mean, look at this Business Insider report that McDonald's worldwide sales at restaurants fell 2.2% just last month.
[02:39:31.145 --> 02:39:38.271]  Okay, so what we're seeing is a decline in McDonald's, and there's numerous reasons for that, but ultimately people don't want to eat the garbage anymore.
[02:39:38.271 --> 02:39:44.716]  And they could have, five, ten years ago, or when Super Size Me came out, gotten rid of some of these ingredients I'm going to talk about.
[02:39:44.716 --> 02:39:45.697]  But they didn't.
[02:39:45.697 --> 02:39:50.541]  Because a matter of a few cents for them is a matter of millions of dollars in their overall conglomerate.
[02:39:50.541 --> 02:39:55.105]  If they were smart, in my opinion, they would have removed these ingredients immediately.
[02:39:55.105 --> 02:39:56.726]  Because that's what they keep getting flack for.
[02:39:56.966 --> 02:40:05.937]  It's really kind of in their business model, you know, because they do need to put these preservatives, these artificial chemicals in there so that they've got a very, very long shelf life.
[02:40:05.937 --> 02:40:08.380]  But they don't have to.
[02:40:08.380 --> 02:40:11.364]  There's even organic fast food places now.
[02:40:11.364 --> 02:40:12.866]  They don't have to do any of this.
[02:40:12.866 --> 02:40:15.269]  If they want to make money off of people
[02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:18.391]  Getting sick and dying, they can do this.
[02:40:18.391 --> 02:40:27.134]  But if they want to cut their profits by .002% and maybe have some alternatives, or fund some options, some research, there are organic preservatives.
[02:40:27.134 --> 02:40:32.416]  But I mean, they have breast implant chemicals in their chicken nuggets, according to some of these reports.
[02:40:32.416 --> 02:40:37.538]  The San Francisco Gate, it's a chemical that's used in silicone breast implants and silly putty.
[02:40:37.538 --> 02:40:41.680]  And the San Francisco Gate reports, the fast food chain makes this popular menu item
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:46.664]  The chemical preservative TBHQ, a petroleum-based product.
[02:40:46.664 --> 02:40:49.567]  And that was at that point in the Chicken McNuggets.
[02:40:49.567 --> 02:40:53.130]  And they have synthetic laxatives with the Wendy's Frosty.
[02:40:53.130 --> 02:41:02.918]  Contained in the Coffee Toffee Twisted Frosty, a laxative chemical and electronic cigarette filler known as propylene glycol is among the 25 new ingredients.
[02:41:02.918 --> 02:41:05.641]  25 new ingredients that make up the special Frosty.
[02:41:06.201 --> 02:41:15.090]  Says, to be clear, this is a chemical linked to a host of conditions including neurotoxic effects in children, blood-brain barrier issues, and much more.
[02:41:15.090 --> 02:41:17.353]  It's even illegal in cat food.
[02:41:17.353 --> 02:41:17.453]  Wow.
[02:41:17.453 --> 02:41:19.315]  So, cats aren't allowed to eat it.
[02:41:19.315 --> 02:41:21.117]  Yeah, but it's okay for Americans and they have a different...
[02:41:21.657 --> 02:41:26.198]  Uh, standard for Americans that they sell to us and things that they won't put in, in other parts of the world.
[02:41:26.198 --> 02:41:29.419]  And even these cigarette companies are trying to remove propylene glycol now.
[02:41:29.419 --> 02:41:31.020]  But they're just putting it in Frosties.
[02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:32.560]  Well, you know, there's a lot of awareness of that.
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:34.320]  We've had FoodBay bond several times.
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:43.523]  She's had, uh, a lot of response from people once she focuses on some of these ingredients that the large corporations will, will back off of it when the light is shown on it.
[02:41:44.023 --> 02:41:57.407]  That's why it surprises me this disconnect over vaccines, for example, that people can't, they understand the issue of additives in food and there's a large building movement of that where people want to get this stuff out.
[02:41:57.407 --> 02:42:03.388]  It's like, don't put cancer-causing stuff in my soft drink because it changes the color to brown.
[02:42:03.388 --> 02:42:04.408]  That's not important to me.
[02:42:04.408 --> 02:42:10.330]  I would rather have it without the color, without the cancer-causing chemicals, but they won't say that about vaccines.
[02:42:10.770 --> 02:42:12.552]  They just don't get the message what it's about.
[02:42:12.552 --> 02:42:23.460]  And that's the thing, the two biggest articles in my experience, writing probably 3,000 articles total, are food item ingredients like this, like five, you know, four worst fast food ingredients they don't tell you about, right?
[02:42:23.460 --> 02:42:26.123]  Or vaccine additives and vaccine effects.
[02:42:26.123 --> 02:42:29.045]  Those are the two biggest shares factors for articles.
[02:42:29.045 --> 02:42:34.990]  I mean, I'm talking about 20,000 Facebook shares in two hours on some of these, or a million Facebook shares.
[02:42:35.370 --> 02:42:41.272]  One of the articles about GMOs being burned got 980,000 shares or something insane like that.
[02:42:41.272 --> 02:42:41.992]  People know.
[02:42:41.992 --> 02:42:43.172]  People are aware of this.
[02:42:43.172 --> 02:42:46.874]  I mean, they get millions and millions of views and people are obsessed with this type of stuff.
[02:42:46.874 --> 02:42:50.655]  So you would say, as a corporation, why are they not responding to that?
[02:42:50.655 --> 02:42:53.196]  It's because they can still get away with it.
[02:42:53.196 --> 02:43:03.299]  If we force them to not get away with it and we actually take the action and go there and don't buy the crap, which it looks like we're doing as McDonald's is just plummeting down, and economists are freaking out saying it's not a blue chip anymore, get away from it.
[02:43:04.096 --> 02:43:06.098]  Well, that's actually taking a change.
[02:43:06.098 --> 02:43:10.584]  When people say, hey, there's yoga mat chemicals in that fast food.
[02:43:10.584 --> 02:43:19.834]  I mean, literally, if you use this chemical that they use in some of these McDonald's products in Singapore, it could be up to a $450,000 fine and 15 years in prison, according to these reports.
[02:43:23.058 --> 02:43:23.639]  That's very interesting.
[02:43:23.639 --> 02:43:26.922]  You know, I think it's very important what we've seen happen.
[02:43:26.922 --> 02:43:29.505]  Again, we're talking about the food babe as we put these other things out.
[02:43:29.505 --> 02:43:31.647]  There's people understand what this is.
[02:43:31.647 --> 02:43:33.849]  They're exercising their market power.
[02:43:33.849 --> 02:43:36.832]  That's why we see McDonald's sales going down.
[02:43:36.832 --> 02:43:40.696]  They're exercising their informed choice, their informed consent.
[02:43:41.317 --> 02:43:44.000]  That's the way you get this stuff out of the vaccines.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:48.105]  You don't just ignore it and tell people, shut up and take it.
[02:43:48.105 --> 02:43:53.672]  You know, it's almost like forcing us to go to McDonald's and, you know, eat there three times a day or whatever.
[02:43:53.672 --> 02:44:00.220]  I mean, it's you've got to approach this, I think, from it is far more effective to approach it from an education.
[02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:01.581]  That's a good question.
[02:44:23.602 --> 02:44:25.263]  I think we are achieving victory.
[02:44:25.263 --> 02:44:28.925]  I think across the board, I mean, we're seeing... There's a reason, let's say this.
[02:44:28.925 --> 02:44:34.449]  There's a reason that 96% of Monsanto shareholders do not want GMO labeling.
[02:44:34.449 --> 02:44:37.311]  There was a poll of GMO shareholders in Monsanto.
[02:44:37.311 --> 02:44:40.073]  They do not want GMO labeling.
[02:44:40.073 --> 02:44:41.754]  McDonald's does not want GMO labeling.
[02:44:41.754 --> 02:44:43.855]  None of these people want you to actually know what you're getting.
[02:44:43.855 --> 02:44:47.337]  And you're right, they're winning by hypnosis.
[02:44:47.337 --> 02:44:49.679]  People are walking into McDonald's, they don't know what they're eating.
[02:44:50.279 --> 02:44:55.746]  Or they think they do, they read the stuff, but they don't actually grasp the idea that when they wake up in the morning they feel like crap.
[02:44:55.746 --> 02:44:57.529]  It's because of what they're putting into their bodies.
[02:44:57.529 --> 02:44:59.251]  So we are achieving major victory, I believe.
[02:44:59.251 --> 02:45:03.076]  I mean, look at how many people are reading all these reports on Infowars and everywhere else.
[02:45:03.076 --> 02:45:04.377]  They're just reading it every single day.
[02:45:04.377 --> 02:45:06.180]  Millions and millions of people that are super concerned.
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:12.325]  Well, it is an information war, and I think that's why the government is so desperate to get control of the internet and to shut this down.
[02:45:12.325 --> 02:45:15.027]  I think it's, they realize that they're losing the information war.
[02:45:15.027 --> 02:45:18.670]  I think that if we get people informed, they're going to withdraw their consent.
[02:45:18.670 --> 02:45:24.335]  I think we'll see some market changes that'll drive not only what we eat, but drive some of the medicines as well.
[02:45:24.335 --> 02:45:25.956]  Thank you so much, Anthony.
[02:45:25.956 --> 02:45:30.020]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson, joining us from the UK right now.
[02:45:30.020 --> 02:45:30.200]  Paul?
[02:45:31.479 --> 02:45:33.000]  Hey David, good to be back.
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:34.542]  Hi, thank you for joining us.
[02:45:34.542 --> 02:45:42.650]  Tell us a little bit about your article here about feminists and not talking about Muslim rape epidemic that's sweeping Europe.
[02:45:44.204 --> 02:45:52.266]  Well, this is a point we've pushed over and over again, David, and I've got another article coming out soon, which is, Top Feminist Calls for Collectivist Revolution.
[02:45:52.266 --> 02:45:58.528]  And we emphasize this over and over again, which is the point that feminists don't care about genuine women's rights issues.
[02:45:58.528 --> 02:46:03.450]  Third wave feminism is all about authoritarianism and social engineering.
[02:46:03.450 --> 02:46:11.292]  So now this top feminist, with an organization called One Billion Rising, backed by the United Nations, and that's important to emphasize,
[02:46:11.812 --> 02:46:15.335]  These feminists aren't just whining on Twitter or Tumblr.
[02:46:15.335 --> 02:46:20.178]  They're backed by millions and millions of dollars in foundation and corporate funding.
[02:46:20.178 --> 02:46:25.702]  So, she's the head of an organization that seeks to end rape and sexual violence against women.
[02:46:25.702 --> 02:46:33.948]  She doesn't talk about the fact that rape and sexual violence against women is endemic within the Islamic community, which we'll get on to.
[02:46:33.948 --> 02:46:38.451]  But she basically got up in front of a crowd in New York a couple of weeks ago
[02:46:39.326 --> 02:46:56.300]  And gave a speech in which she talked about how feminism was about creating a collectivist revolution and that she was proud to say, quote, American individualism is dead and global solidarity is alive and on the rise.
[02:46:56.300 --> 02:47:05.688]  So it was basically kind of a creepy communist cult initiation meeting for feminists who, again, are being backed by millions and millions of dollars in corporate funding.
[02:47:06.286 --> 02:47:15.675]  And again, it goes back to feminism being completely opposed to classical liberalism, which was the moral worth of the individual.
[02:47:15.675 --> 02:47:24.083]  She's coming out and brazenly stating that feminism is determined to destroy individualism, destroy free market capitalism,
[02:47:24.523 --> 02:47:28.126]  And replace it with a collectivist revolution.
[02:47:28.126 --> 02:47:32.028]  So again, feminism is not about genuine women's rights issues.
[02:47:32.028 --> 02:47:36.712]  It's about social engineering and advancing this authoritarian agenda.
[02:47:36.712 --> 02:47:41.835]  Yeah, and there seems to be a very selective outrage over certain things.
[02:47:41.835 --> 02:47:48.520]  As you point out, the feminists are not looking at what is happening to women in fundamental Islamic countries.
[02:47:49.961 --> 02:48:06.892]  Just as we see that there's no concern about the regular Saudi beheadings, as we pointed out the other day, at the rate that they've been beheading people, they're going to get to the number of Christians that were beheaded this last week, if that was in fact an authentic video.
[02:48:06.892 --> 02:48:19.040]  20-some-odd Christians beheaded, that would happen in less than 90 days in Saudi Arabia, yet we're supposed to go to war, put boots on the ground, wipe out ISIS,
[02:48:19.901 --> 02:48:23.150]  But we're allied with people who do that on a regular basis.
[02:48:23.150 --> 02:48:26.479]  And that's what we're seeing here with this kind of hypocrisy with the feminists.
[02:48:27.858 --> 02:48:33.423]  That's right, and Saudi Arabia passed a law which characterized female drivers as terrorists.
[02:48:33.423 --> 02:48:36.245]  You didn't hear any feminist outrage about it.
[02:48:36.245 --> 02:48:41.409]  They were too busy complaining about Matt Taylor, the comet scientist's quote, sexist shirt.
[02:48:41.409 --> 02:48:43.011]  That's what they harp on about.
[02:48:43.011 --> 02:48:51.358]  They harped on about the college rape scandal for years, claiming that one in five female students in the United States are victims of sexual assault.
[02:48:51.818 --> 02:49:03.263]  We got the Justice Department numbers in 2014, December, which showed that actually 0.03 in 5 are victims of sexual assault on US college campuses.
[02:49:03.263 --> 02:49:03.663]  Wow.
[02:49:03.663 --> 02:49:09.326]  And female students are 25% less likely to be raped than non-students.
[02:49:09.326 --> 02:49:11.607]  And yet they harped on about that for years.
[02:49:11.607 --> 02:49:13.907]  It was a contrived myth.
[02:49:13.907 --> 02:49:19.390]  It blew up in their faces with the University of Virginia rape scandal, which was completely debunked.
[02:49:19.950 --> 02:49:28.158]  And then we can get on to what's actually happening with real rape scandals after the break in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and other European countries.
[02:49:28.158 --> 02:49:35.965]  Yeah, they throw these statistics out there and just like we see happening with the vaccine thing, the CDC continues to tell everybody, hey these vaccines are...
[02:49:36.906 --> 02:49:44.894]  99% effective and yet we saw in the Disneyland outbreak that 14% of the people had been vaccinated the year before they had an outbreak in California.
[02:49:44.894 --> 02:49:54.624]  18% of the people have been vaccinated back in 1987 according to the and if you think well maybe that's just a small population if you go back to 1987 look at the CDC's own numbers
[02:49:56.726 --> 02:50:05.130]  52% of the people who came down with measles had been vaccinated, yet they still put this story out there that it's 99% effective.
[02:50:05.130 --> 02:50:09.253]  They continue to persist in these kind of statistics to support their view.
[02:50:09.253 --> 02:50:13.215]  That's why you always need to go back and check to see where did these numbers come from.
[02:50:15.100 --> 02:50:22.491]  Yeah, because I mean they can contrive a whole narrative based on completely fraudulent numbers and only later they come out and prove the opposite case.
[02:50:22.491 --> 02:50:28.179]  But again, there's a huge article up on InfoWars, feminists mute on Muslim rape epidemic sweeping Europe.
[02:50:28.709 --> 02:50:31.110]  This is a heavily documented article.
[02:50:31.110 --> 02:50:38.854]  It's full of videos and hyperlinks to government documents, police reports, about how this epidemic of Muslim abuse is sweeping the continent.
[02:50:38.854 --> 02:50:40.055]  So we'll get on to it.
[02:50:40.055 --> 02:50:42.536]  Yes, that's an article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:50:42.536 --> 02:50:47.059]  We have Paul Joseph Watson from the UK joining us, and he's going to be with us right after the break.

[02:51:08.944 --> 02:51:11.866]  I was taking nitro two or three times a week.
[02:51:11.866 --> 02:51:16.890]  The very first day after taking Heart and Body Extract, the chest pain was gone.
[02:51:16.890 --> 02:51:18.852]  Now I don't wear a nitro patch.

[02:53:55.085 --> 02:53:56.145]  We've got your back.
[02:54:09.758 --> 02:54:15.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and we have joining us from the UK, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:16.560]  We've been talking about his story.
[02:54:16.560 --> 02:54:23.902]  Feminists mute on Muslim rape epidemic sweeping Europe, and of course the bottom of this is multiculturalism.
[02:54:23.902 --> 02:54:25.943]  It simply isn't politically correct.
[02:54:26.423 --> 02:54:30.066]  To talk about what's going on in European countries.
[02:54:30.066 --> 02:54:39.813]  As you point out in your article here, Paul, you say that in Denmark, for example, crime rates broken down by nationality show individuals from Muslim countries make up eight of the top nine places on the list.
[02:54:39.813 --> 02:54:49.419]  In 2012, sexual assaults were almost ten times more common amongst those who were immigrants than with those of Danish citizenship.
[02:54:49.419 --> 02:54:51.841]  Yet we can't talk about that because it's not politically correct.
[02:54:51.841 --> 02:54:55.744]  We've been beaten down into submission with multiculturalism.
[02:54:57.110 --> 02:55:21.674]  Well that's right and I mean this is the heart of feminism is rampant hypocrisy because they don't talk about this like the woman I was just talking about before the break you know has an organization devoted to ending sexual violence and rape against women yet refuses to address this problem you know we had a case in Rotherham in England where from 1997 onwards for nearly 15 years over a thousand young girls were sexually abused beaten and trafficked
[02:55:21.994 --> 02:55:36.342]  by primarily Pakistani Muslim men and the Labour government in Rotherham covered up and ignored that scandal, ignored the reports that were pouring in because they feared being characterised as politically incorrect and racist.
[02:55:36.342 --> 02:55:42.305]  So this is where political correctness again poses a direct threat to the just functioning of a free society.
[02:55:43.025 --> 02:55:45.427]  As you mentioned, you can go through the other countries.
[02:55:45.427 --> 02:56:00.198]  And again, to underscore the point, you know, most sober-minded Muslims would agree that this is a problem, this is a crisis that needs to be addressed, just as most Catholics would agree that the Vatican paedophile scandal needed to be addressed.
[02:56:00.498 --> 02:56:02.800]  You know, this isn't about demonizing Muslims.
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:24.994]  It's about calling out this authoritarian political correctness that prevents these reports from being taken seriously by governments in these European countries, by the media, because they're more concerned with protecting multicultural sensitivities, whereby to the point, you know, you've got Lars Hedegaard in Denmark who put out the report with the stats that you just mentioned.
[02:56:24.994 --> 02:56:30.218]  He was actually brought up under hate speech laws for simply talking about the issue.
[02:56:30.838 --> 02:56:36.502]  So they're treating people who bring attention to it in some cases worse than the actual rapists.
[02:56:36.502 --> 02:56:43.607]  And we need to understand too that multiculturalism is really the tool to bring about global governance.
[02:56:43.607 --> 02:56:52.073]  They want to destroy cultures and sovereign nations and the way they do it is with open immigration as they're doing here in the United States.
[02:56:52.073 --> 02:56:55.095]  They have a different way of doing it slightly in Europe.
[02:56:55.675 --> 02:57:02.420]  Nevertheless, it is all about breaking down the cultures, the continuity of government, if you will.
[02:57:02.420 --> 02:57:08.023]  I don't like to use that phrase because that's something used by government to justify a lot of very bad things.
[02:57:08.023 --> 02:57:19.111]  But the continuity of culture of a people, to break that down, to mix the groups together, and to set them apart against each other, that's all part of this multiculturalism.
[02:57:19.111 --> 02:57:25.515]  Instead of just bringing this in and saying we want to uplift these cultures, they're actually using it to destroy indigenous cultures, aren't they?
[02:57:26.815 --> 02:57:29.496]  Yeah, and they're using it as a tool of political repression.
[02:57:29.496 --> 02:57:32.057]  They're playing one culture off against each other.
[02:57:32.057 --> 02:57:36.938]  Even world leaders like Cameron and Merkel have admitted that multiculturalism has failed.
[02:57:36.938 --> 02:57:38.618]  It's a failed experiment.
[02:57:38.618 --> 02:57:43.920]  So, for example, since 1975 in Sweden, when they opened their doors to multiculturalism,
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:47.901]  The rapes skyrocketed since that time by 1,472%.
[02:57:47.901 --> 02:58:02.385]  So now 77% of rapes committed in Sweden are carried out by foreign immigrants, mainly Muslims, because under Islam they see women as second-class citizens.
[02:58:02.385 --> 02:58:12.308]  But the people in Sweden who are drawing attention to this are being characterized as racist thought criminals merely for trying to highlight the fact that this is a major problem.
[02:58:12.308 --> 02:58:12.868]  Here they are!
[02:58:13.208 --> 02:58:14.069]  They have a real problem.
[02:58:14.069 --> 02:58:19.174]  That's why we see the rise of UKIP and a lot of these other parties that want independence from the European Union.
[02:58:19.174 --> 02:58:27.402]  They understand how this is being sold to them, how they're taking down their countries, and yet the standard response is that they're xenophobic, that they're racist.
[02:58:27.402 --> 02:58:28.764]  We're out of time for today.
