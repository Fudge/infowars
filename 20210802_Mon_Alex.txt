[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.624]  Is the coronavirus not going away, or can we ever go back to a pre-pandemic reality?
[00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:23.812]  We are never going to go back to a pre-pandemic reality, and I do agree that we do have to become comfortable with the fact that this virus is going to be sticking around.
[00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:30.276]  While Mr. Biden said he would be willing to get a vaccine, he would not require it for all Americans.
[00:00:30.276 --> 00:00:31.598]  I don't think it should be mandatory.
[00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:35.160]  I wouldn't demand to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.383]  Just like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide.
[00:00:38.903 --> 00:00:43.908]  Joe Biden's tyranny is the disease ripping through the Haggard Republic.
[00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:48.832]  Every day, more businesses are implementing their own vaccine mandates.
[00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:54.177]  And the Justice Department has made it clear that it is legal to require COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:00:56.704 --> 00:00:59.606]  We all want our lives to get back to normal.
[00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:02.227]  We are never going to go back to a pre-pandemic reality.
[00:01:02.227 --> 00:01:04.849]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.191]  Will you require all federal employees to get vaccinated?
[00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:12.974]  That's under consideration right now, but if you're not vaccinated, you're not nearly as smart as I thought you were.
[00:01:12.974 --> 00:01:17.717]  We have a pandemic because they unvaccinated, and they're showing enormous coverage.
[00:01:17.717 --> 00:01:25.362]  And the more we learn, the more we learn about this virus, and it's all of this variation.
[00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:28.576]  The more we have to be worried and concerned.
[00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:31.819]  And there's only one thing we know for sure.
[00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.843]  If those other 100,000 people got vaccinated, we'd be in a very different world.
[00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.215]  The bottom line is that a huge number of vaccinated people are getting COVID, and some of them are getting very sick, even dying.
[00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:44.576]  That's true around the world.
[00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:51.522]  It's true in Iceland, Gibraltar, Israel, in small countries with high vaccination rates that have seen big spikes in COVID cases.
[00:01:51.522 --> 00:01:54.384]  And it's every bit as true here in the United States.
[00:01:54.384 --> 00:02:02.732]  According to the CDC today, fully three-quarters of the people infected in a recent outbreak, for example in Massachusetts, had already been vaccinated.
[00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:10.887]  The CDC announced that vaccinated people can carry the virus with them and they can easily spread the virus to others.
[00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:18.189]  As the CDC conceded, quote, breakthrough infections may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases.
[00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:27.071]  The reason the administration and the governments around the world are accelerating their push for mass vaccination right now is because they know the window of obedience
[00:02:29.392 --> 00:02:51.714]  will be slammed shut the minute the wave of post-vaccination deaths really kicks in which many people believe in the northern hemisphere will happen during the flu season uh... january february of next year but that's just a guess nobody knows for sure they're saying that this is an agenda to mass exterminate as many people as possible because dead people don't protest
[00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:54.376]  Because dead people don't sue.
[00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:59.658]  So if they can kill as many as possible, they can really limit the backlash that they know is coming anyway.
[00:02:59.658 --> 00:03:02.399]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:08.661]  After months of saying the opposite, the Democrats are now pushing mandates for the vaccinated.
[00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:10.082]  So here's the thing.
[00:03:10.082 --> 00:03:14.403]  We cannot require someone to be vaccinated.
[00:03:14.403 --> 00:03:15.684]  That's just not what we can do.
[00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:37.704]  When the Democrat-led government begins mandatory forced vaccinations and people begin to die and suffer in droves from Joe Biden's ignorance and disinformation, the United States will erupt with legitimate protests similar to those in Europe where a farmer unloaded manure into an open window in the presidential palace.
[00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:38.831]  The U.S.
[00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:44.433]  isn't the only place seeing what Joe on Friday described as toxic individualism.
[00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:51.375]  People thumping their chests in the name of freedom while thumbing their noses at any sense of personal responsibility.
[00:03:51.375 --> 00:04:04.939]  We saw this also playing out over the weekend in France, which saw massive, at times violent, protests over new laws that will require proof of vaccination to enter restaurants and other businesses.
[00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:15.807]  Of course, Joe Biden's unyielding attempts to vaccinate America to please his globalist puppet masters violates the 14th Amendment and the Nuremberg Code.
[00:04:15.807 --> 00:04:29.016]  But his team of anti-liberty lawyers will determine if Supreme Court cases like the 1905 Jacobson v. Massachusetts will open the door for vaccine mandate tyranny.
[00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:32.619]  Why are the doctors not here in the briefing room to take our questions?
[00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:38.143]  I would argue that we had the President of the United States speak to this yesterday.
[00:04:38.143 --> 00:04:42.426]  He gave a more than 30-minute speech about where we are as a country.
[00:04:42.426 --> 00:04:45.068]  I mean, he is a trusted voice.
[00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:47.410]  He's the leader of our country.
[00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.312]  No, but we heard from him, right?
[00:04:50.312 --> 00:04:51.813]  We heard from the President yesterday.
[00:04:51.813 --> 00:04:55.016]  We heard from the President about the Delta variant and vaccines.
[00:04:58.604 --> 00:05:04.670]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:12.177]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:05:12.177 --> 00:05:14.499]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:18.062]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:05:19.984 --> 00:05:28.166]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.

[00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:45.972]  Thank you and God bless.

[00:06:13.763 --> 00:06:18.245]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:29.549]  The British government is now officially warning that vaccine individuals will become factories that they believe could produce a super virus that would kill one-third of the earth's population.
[00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:35.472]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.472 --> 00:06:37.212]  One-third of the world's population, 2.6
[00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.274]  2.5 billion.
[00:06:41.274 --> 00:06:43.296]  Over 2.6 billion.
[00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:43.896]  Is it true?
[00:06:43.896 --> 00:06:48.200]  It's absolutely true, because that's what they're planning next.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.263]  We've been teed up and prepared with the binary weapon.
[00:06:52.263 --> 00:06:53.904]  Every minute of this show is precious now.
[00:06:53.904 --> 00:06:55.586]  We can be taken off air at any time.
[00:06:55.586 --> 00:07:00.069]  The enemy is closing in on us, and they're closing in on you and your family.
[00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:04.453]  It's like the 1970s Body Snatcher movie, but it's for real.
[00:07:04.453 --> 00:07:09.317]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[00:07:10.902 --> 00:07:18.146]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.207]  For beholden to scum!
[00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:20.888]  Russian scum!
[00:07:20.888 --> 00:07:22.589]  Listen to me.
[00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:23.209]  Please listen.
[00:07:30.526 --> 00:07:38.851]  If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[00:07:38.851 --> 00:07:43.014]  The function of all life is survival.
[00:07:43.014 --> 00:07:45.015]  Sleep.
[00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:46.996]  Sleep.
[00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:48.117]  Sleep.
[00:07:48.117 --> 00:07:48.657]  Oh my God!
[00:07:48.657 --> 00:07:49.257]  Oh my God!
[00:07:49.257 --> 00:07:49.838]  Oh my God!
[00:07:49.838 --> 00:07:50.618]  Lock the door!
[00:07:50.618 --> 00:07:51.118]  Lock the door!
[00:07:51.118 --> 00:07:51.559]  They're coming!
[00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:53.180]  They're coming!
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.880]  Help!
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.600]  Help!
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.541]  They're coming!
[00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:56.261]  They're coming!
[00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:57.022]  Listen to me!
[00:07:57.022 --> 00:07:57.462]  Listen!
[00:07:57.462 --> 00:07:57.722]  Help me!
[00:07:59.586 --> 00:08:00.247]  Your necks, please!
[00:08:00.247 --> 00:08:00.847]  Please!
[00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.408]  Your necks are in danger!
[00:08:02.408 --> 00:08:03.308]  Please, listen to me!
[00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:04.509]  It's something terrible!
[00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:05.389]  Please!
[00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:05.790]  Your necks!
[00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.550]  Here they are!
[00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.851]  They're already here!
[00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:09.872]  Help!
[00:08:09.872 --> 00:08:10.492]  Your necks!
[00:08:10.492 --> 00:08:13.014]  They're coming!
[00:08:13.014 --> 00:08:13.954]  They're coming!
[00:08:13.954 --> 00:08:17.036]  The seed is planted.
[00:08:17.036 --> 00:08:18.257]  Terror grows.
[00:08:18.257 --> 00:08:20.378]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[00:08:20.378 --> 00:08:21.959]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:23.540]  Sit up!
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.721]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[00:08:27.262 --> 00:08:29.463]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[00:08:29.463 --> 00:08:32.885]  Is it contagious?
[00:08:32.885 --> 00:08:33.585]  It looked right at me.
[00:08:33.585 --> 00:08:34.386]  You need to get out!
[00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:36.107]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[00:08:36.107 --> 00:08:39.188]  It was not human.
[00:08:39.188 --> 00:08:42.410]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.191]  We're being cornered!
[00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:48.754]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[00:08:48.754 --> 00:08:50.795]  They're barricading the street.
[00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:52.996]  Invasion of the body statues.
[00:09:14.582 --> 00:09:19.584]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:09:19.584 --> 00:09:31.786]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:09:31.786 --> 00:09:42.169]  The morning of January 6th, 2021 was by far the largest peaceful protest for fair elections ever assembled in America.
[00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:54.522]  After decades of unanswered election fraud evidence from both political parties, the 2020 election was by far the most egregious.
[00:09:55.766 --> 00:10:18.391]  An issue once heralded by the American liberal, who is now flagrantly quiet on the issue, while seizing total control of the system with the full support of the entire mainstream media apparatus, pushing their once sacred democracy over the cliff into tyranny, just as Plato predicted millenniums ago.
[00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:24.213]  What should have been remembered as a historic day for democracy was spun into a blatant lie.
[00:10:25.649 --> 00:10:49.148]  Aside from the murder of Ashley Babbitt, the small amount of violence that did occur was about what you would expect, considering how the FBI, who have faked and manufactured nearly 95% of every terrorist arrest they've made since 9-11, had agent provocateurs involved in the so-called January 6th insurrection from the start.
[00:10:50.467 --> 00:11:03.076]  Federal agent provocateurs who remain free and protected, while dozens of innocent Americans are being tortured in jail with complete disregard for justice.
[00:11:03.076 --> 00:11:16.806]  With no evidence of a crime, they are being held in unlawfully cruel conditions, ignored by the criminal media responsible for putting them there, and punished for speaking to the press about beatings and torture.
[00:11:16.806 --> 00:11:18.107]  We don't know much about them.
[00:11:19.309 --> 00:11:21.991]  But we do know Joe Biggs.
[00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:28.616]  After serving his country honorably as a soldier, he then became a voice for American justice.
[00:11:28.616 --> 00:11:35.282]  Joe Biggs is now being held in third-world prison conditions for simply being present at the U.S.
[00:11:35.282 --> 00:11:36.903]  Capitol.
[00:11:36.903 --> 00:11:40.246]  He recently wrote of his three-month experience in jail.
[00:11:41.238 --> 00:11:54.485]  He wrote of health issues he has experienced as a result of sleeping only four hours a night on a cold steel rack while not being allowed to work out and only given 10 hours of sunlight in three months.
[00:11:54.485 --> 00:12:03.169]  A soy-based diet with hardly any protein, mostly processed foods and some kind of gelatin dog food looking stuff.
[00:12:04.212 --> 00:12:12.197]  There is no privacy allowed for the toilets and he has allotted a single shelf that nothing can be placed on.
[00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:20.681]  They are punished by losing the ability to talk to family and being stripped naked and locked alone in a bright freezing room.
[00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.383]  Joe Biggs wrote, I have anxiety bad now.
[00:12:24.383 --> 00:12:26.845]  Panic attacks so bad I black out.
[00:12:28.669 --> 00:12:38.233]  What happened on January 6th, 2021 was a crime perpetrated by a corrupt government against the American people.
[00:12:38.233 --> 00:12:42.494]  This is evident to anyone outside of the brainwashed herd.
[00:12:42.494 --> 00:12:49.697]  Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken out against these crimes, and yet former President Trump has not.
[00:12:51.078 --> 00:12:56.760]  Perhaps the worst part of all is how both liberals and conservatives remain silent.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:06.123]  Like cowardly domesticated pets, they say nothing while dozens of innocent Americans are tortured in jail like war criminals.
[00:13:06.123 --> 00:13:06.703]  It's hundreds.
[00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:10.284]  Without any evidence of a crime.
[00:13:10.284 --> 00:13:16.026]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.

[00:13:17.926 --> 00:13:20.027]  Share the link.
[00:13:21.547 --> 00:13:28.868]  Okay.
[00:13:28.868 --> 00:13:34.270]  Everything I warned about, the culmination of my life, the culmination of your life, is now here.
[00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:43.431]  We have reached the center of the fork in the road, and it's decision time right now for everybody.
[00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:47.032]  This is an overwhelming time of biblical proportions.
[00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:54.073]  Joe Biggs talked about in solitary confinement basically how he has panic attacks and blacks out.
[00:13:54.073 --> 00:13:55.514]  I can't even imagine what he's going through.
[00:13:55.514 --> 00:13:56.215]  I pray for him daily.
[00:13:56.215 --> 00:13:57.415]  He's a good man, a good person.
[00:13:57.415 --> 00:13:58.616]  Didn't do anything wrong that day.
[00:13:58.616 --> 00:14:05.460]  Just got set up when they opened the doors up and the excitement went in.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.222]  But I myself, yesterday,
[00:14:09.258 --> 00:14:22.303]  I've been researching for about six hours off and on, and it was so staggering to know that they're genociding everybody, that they've committed, that I actually got dizzy and started stumbling up against the wall and had to sit down for about 30 minutes.
[00:14:22.303 --> 00:14:24.544]  And I almost couldn't come to the show yesterday.
[00:14:24.544 --> 00:14:29.586]  And see, most people act tough and big and powerful, and they can handle it, and they can... I'm a pretty tough guy.
[00:14:29.586 --> 00:14:35.628]  And knowing how bad this is, and my mind coming to grips with, okay, it's as bad as we thought it's worse.
[00:14:36.588 --> 00:14:46.257]  I, that was my brain resetting, and I was a lot stronger after it happened, but I literally had to sit down in a chair and was dizzy and about to throw up just processing this.
[00:14:46.257 --> 00:14:51.783]  And look, if Alex Jones can't process this, I get it if you can't process it.
[00:14:51.783 --> 00:14:54.285]  But it's all happening.
[00:14:54.285 --> 00:14:55.486]  Oh, that feeling's coming back right now.
[00:15:00.669 --> 00:15:09.791]  And the feeling is your psychic connection to your fellow humans that are being poisoned and murdered all around you, and the fact that total psycho criminals are preying on us and coming after us, and it's all confirmed.
[00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:18.352]  I mean, they now have the dean of one of the top medical schools in the United States coming out and saying, don't take the shots.
[00:15:18.352 --> 00:15:26.434]  They always knew that any shot targeting a protein of a coronavirus would cause death, basically.
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.203]  I mean, this is just getting insane.
[00:15:33.203 --> 00:15:35.225]  And it's all right out in the open.
[00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:39.689]  Antibody-dependent enhancement.
[00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:43.472]  And the dean of the Baylor Medical School told Congress this months ago.
[00:15:43.472 --> 00:15:44.213]  I didn't even know this.
[00:15:45.518 --> 00:15:49.221]  I mean, Kyle, it's like, it's like, don't take cyanide, it'll kill you.
[00:15:49.221 --> 00:15:51.343]  Don't take these shots, it'll really F you up.
[00:15:51.343 --> 00:15:52.765]  And they're doing it!
[00:15:52.765 --> 00:15:54.026]  And they're coming for us!
[00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:57.529]  And they've already killed the majority of the countries and died!
[00:15:57.529 --> 00:16:03.614]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:16:03.614 --> 00:16:10.220]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:16:11.101 --> 00:16:13.402]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:16:13.402 --> 00:16:18.905]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:16:18.905 --> 00:16:27.089]  This historical event will be livestreamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, frankspeech.com.
[00:16:27.089 --> 00:16:32.072]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to frankspeech.com now.
[00:16:32.972 --> 00:16:43.694]  To help support this Cyber Symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[00:16:43.694 --> 00:16:45.755]  Thank you and God bless.
[00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:51.196]  Go to FrankSpeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[00:16:58.493 --> 00:17:08.821]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, and that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[00:17:08.821 --> 00:17:12.344]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[00:17:12.344 --> 00:17:17.949]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:18.809]  Well, guess what?
[00:17:18.809 --> 00:17:22.792]  It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenics Disglobalist that
[00:17:23.943 --> 00:17:38.779]  ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes of the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:45.845]  The problem for them was, the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[00:17:45.845 --> 00:17:49.147]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine.
[00:17:49.147 --> 00:17:55.152]  Because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[00:17:55.152 --> 00:17:56.213]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:57.572 --> 00:18:01.254]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:10.759]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:17.502]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship, while you still can, at 20-20 prices.
[00:18:17.502 --> 00:18:20.964]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.

[00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:31.150]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:32.171]  But that's it.
[00:18:32.171 --> 00:18:34.573]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[00:18:34.573 --> 00:18:36.775]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[00:18:36.775 --> 00:18:38.756]  This is insurance you can eat.
[00:18:38.756 --> 00:18:40.057]  It's the highest quality.
[00:18:40.057 --> 00:18:41.218]  Hundreds of high-quality foods.
[00:18:41.218 --> 00:18:42.919]  Three-month, six-month year supplies.

[00:18:55.548 --> 00:19:00.991]  So take action now while you still can.
[00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:03.652]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:36.563]  All right, I'm going to say this very slowly, and I'm going to say this very, very clearly.
[00:19:36.563 --> 00:19:39.183]  As best I can.
[00:19:39.183 --> 00:19:46.705]  Because I can put two and two together just as good as anybody, and I know who the Globalist are and what they're up to and what their plan is.
[00:19:46.705 --> 00:19:50.046]  So I'm going to lay something on you really, really earth-shattering right now.
[00:19:51.112 --> 00:20:10.358]  The British official government agency, with its civilian and military government, says they believe that the vaccinated are causing mutations that could kill one-third of the planet.
[00:20:11.158 --> 00:20:12.239]  And that's the headline.
[00:20:12.239 --> 00:20:17.542]  Now, deadlier COVID variant could kill one in three people, Sage warns.
[00:20:17.542 --> 00:20:19.163]  That's the federal main agency.
[00:20:19.163 --> 00:20:20.704]  Now, is that true?
[00:20:20.704 --> 00:20:21.584]  Is that fear-mongering?
[00:20:21.584 --> 00:20:24.946]  I'm going to give you my take in a moment.
[00:20:24.946 --> 00:20:29.929]  But let's talk about that right now.
[00:20:29.929 --> 00:20:40.396]  If you have billions of people that have been inoculated, and six, eight months later we're told now they're going to give off variants that are going to kill you,
[00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:50.675]  So not just the unvaccinated need to be vaccinated, but also the people that have already been given injections because now they're factories of death.
[00:20:50.675 --> 00:20:52.736]  We predicted that.
[00:20:52.736 --> 00:21:01.121]  Logically, that's exactly what the globalists would do, to then put a third injection in these individuals and seal their fate.
[00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:05.344]  And then I guess they've got to take more shots because I guess that third injection is going to cause
[00:21:06.368 --> 00:21:07.829]  More deadly variants again.
[00:21:07.829 --> 00:21:09.750]  See how the trap works.
[00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.771]  Whatever the real science is, we're not being told.
[00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:15.792]  Whatever they're really up to, we know it's about depopulation.
[00:21:15.792 --> 00:21:26.557]  And we know from all the studies and all the real scientists, heads of agencies, heads of hospitals, heads of major universities, chief scientists,
[00:21:28.635 --> 00:21:47.330]  We know that when you create a vaccine, whether it's from a virus vector or mRNA that attacks the shell of something, that when you do that, it causes all these different types of deadly diseases in the body of every mammal they give it to.
[00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.313]  And so this was heavily tested, heavily vetted.
[00:21:50.313 --> 00:21:51.514]  And look, I knew all this.
[00:21:52.782 --> 00:22:12.621]  But yesterday I did a bunch of research again, it was all over the internet looking at clips of different doctor groups, and again prestigious scientists, and they were all testifying to Congress like the Dean of Science and Healthcare, the Dean of Science and Medical at a very respected medical school, Baylor Medical School, where my dad went.
[00:22:14.486 --> 00:22:26.573]  And there they are saying, point blank, every vaccine, he told Congress this, every vaccine that's ever targeted the coronavirus shell has killed the animals we gave it to.
[00:22:26.573 --> 00:22:30.415]  Every project has failed until Bill Gates took it over.
[00:22:30.415 --> 00:22:33.978]  He says Bill Gates took it over eight years ago, which he did.
[00:22:34.858 --> 00:22:41.023]  Why did Bill Gates take over a project that always failed and always killed the majority of the animals and sterilized them?
[00:22:41.023 --> 00:22:43.265]  I mean, that's in the damn studies.
[00:22:43.265 --> 00:22:53.073]  And we've known this for a while, but to sit there and watch him load the gun and kill people like this in slow motion is just absolutely earth-shattering for me.
[00:22:55.259 --> 00:23:09.929]  And I know that's why the general public won't be able to handle this and will continue to take the shots, even as it kills them, because it's so scary to them to admit they've got a psychotic, criminal, murderous, planetary world government that's literally run by Satan doing this to them, even though that's the complete facts.
[00:23:09.929 --> 00:23:10.890]  But here's the good news.
[00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.292]  I don't know what the globals are going to do.
[00:23:13.292 --> 00:23:15.894]  I know two medical doctors in Austin that are my doctors.
[00:23:18.257 --> 00:23:19.778]  They didn't used to be that woke.
[00:23:19.778 --> 00:23:23.160]  Now they go, oh, this is a kill plan, a total takeover, spike protein.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.081]  All the doctors they know know that.
[00:23:25.081 --> 00:23:27.583]  Doctors walk up to me at the grocery store and say, I'm a medical doctor.
[00:23:27.583 --> 00:23:29.484]  You're absolutely right.
[00:23:29.484 --> 00:23:32.646]  And then I can watch hundreds of new doctors a day.
[00:23:32.646 --> 00:23:37.309]  Heads of hospitals, heads of ERs, heads of private clinics saying the same damn thing.
[00:23:37.309 --> 00:23:38.569]  And I can read the studies all day.
[00:23:38.569 --> 00:23:40.891]  I mean, this is settled science.
[00:23:43.325 --> 00:23:59.979]  That they, every vaccine program they ever did, and we have the inventor of mRNA, saying every study they ever did, trying to have mRNA create a spike protein and kill the animals.
[00:23:59.979 --> 00:24:09.106]  So do you understand, I'm going to play those clips next segment, that we're not talking about this theoretically like we were a year ago, it's now here.
[00:24:09.106 --> 00:24:12.069]  And I am completely blown away at a level never before.
[00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:20.512]  Because so many people are still just caught up in La La Land, and we have the new replacement.
[00:24:20.512 --> 00:24:24.533]  They're now phasing her in for Psaki, just as clueless.
[00:24:24.533 --> 00:24:41.938]  Deputy Secretary for the Press Secretary, Karen Jean-Pierre, and she's asked a question by Emerald Robinson from Newsmax.
[00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:46.470]  And she just says, oh, we don't look at anything.
[00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.090]  We just trust the scientists.
[00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:54.932]  And the scientists are Big Pharma, Pfizer, Bill Gates, and Fauci, and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:24:54.932 --> 00:24:58.413]  Oh, and then she just sits up there and spews BS at people.
[00:24:58.413 --> 00:25:01.954]  So she says, because the experts say so.
[00:25:01.954 --> 00:25:06.736]  Stay on the Titanic, even though the ship's listing over to its side and on fire.
[00:25:08.959 --> 00:25:10.180]  Because they say so.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.762]  I mean, this is Jim Jones drink the Kool-Aid stuff.
[00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:18.425]  And then Brian Stilter has the nerve to say those of us that don't want the shots are in a cult?
[00:25:18.425 --> 00:25:21.847]  We don't want an experimental shot that's been banned all over the world?
[00:25:21.847 --> 00:25:23.688]  That's now had all these horrible health effects?
[00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:26.030]  That killed the rats and ferrets?
[00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:32.334]  And then a weird hup-de-dup-de-doo, like we're on an acid trip in hell, is up there saying we're Jim Jones cult people?
[00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:37.641]  And they're on TV saying, you shouldn't have food, you shouldn't have your children, you shouldn't have a job!
[00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:39.943]  Take the shot, take the shot!
[00:25:39.943 --> 00:25:50.769]  Because if they don't get the vast majority of people to take it, and then they get sick, the whole country won't collapse, and there'll be a giant mass of people that are gonna hunt them down and bring them to justice, which is gonna happen!
[00:25:51.892 --> 00:25:53.354]  They took their shot at us, folks.
[00:25:53.354 --> 00:25:55.156]  They did it to the medical system, world government.
[00:25:55.156 --> 00:26:00.722]  They want to depopulate the West, get us out of the way for a slave class New World Order with China at the head of it.
[00:26:00.722 --> 00:26:03.044]  We are in a war with the globalists in China.
[00:26:03.044 --> 00:26:06.087]  They are depopulating us right now.
[00:26:06.087 --> 00:26:12.014]  China just went back to their next lockdown with fake people falling over and everything to get us all scared.
[00:26:12.014 --> 00:26:12.595]  They've done it again.
[00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:17.536]  I mean, they're making their move, baby.
[00:26:17.536 --> 00:26:27.626]  I've got footage from all over the world of helicopters and SWAT teams physically attacking people and horses and water cannons of folks that want to come out after a year and a half being brutally attacked.
[00:26:27.626 --> 00:26:35.153]  But here is the press spokesperson saying, because the experts say so, saying, we don't even ask questions.
[00:26:35.153 --> 00:26:35.454]  Here it is.
[00:26:36.792 --> 00:26:38.294]  I don't understand the question.
[00:26:38.294 --> 00:26:39.495]  We don't test it.
[00:26:39.495 --> 00:26:43.280]  We listen to public health and scientists and they tell us that it's the Delta variant.
[00:26:53.271 --> 00:26:54.432]  I don't even understand.
[00:26:54.432 --> 00:27:00.575]  Why would they explain... I mean, that's what they are telling us.
[00:27:00.575 --> 00:27:08.019]  I laid out what... I laid out how contagious it was and I laid out why we needed to act on the Delta variant.
[00:27:08.019 --> 00:27:08.679]  I laid out why...
[00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:13.822]  Well, they're the experts.
[00:27:13.822 --> 00:27:15.342]  It's not just day.
[00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:16.363]  These are scientists.
[00:27:16.363 --> 00:27:18.224]  These are experts.
[00:27:18.224 --> 00:27:20.145]  Hold on one second.
[00:27:20.145 --> 00:27:29.909]  I just said that Dr. Lewinsky said just recently, in her 20-year career, she had never seen a variant that was so contagious.
[00:27:31.974 --> 00:27:36.477]  We told you a year ago they were going to say it's variants, but it's really the vaccine killing people.
[00:27:36.477 --> 00:27:41.541]  It's these so-called experts that are all invested in the whole takeover, who are depopulationists, who are globalists.
[00:27:41.541 --> 00:27:42.962]  I think there's too many people.
[00:27:42.962 --> 00:27:50.508]  And then they try to censor the huge ocean of real scientists and doctors that say the opposite, and victims and their families, of what this deadly shot has done.
[00:27:50.508 --> 00:27:54.251]  So they made their move, they tried to suppress us, the truth got out, and now you're all going to prison.
[00:27:56.052 --> 00:27:58.935]  The biosecurity state is here.
[00:27:58.935 --> 00:28:04.840]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:18.653]  The corrupt puppet Prime Minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[00:28:20.074 --> 00:28:23.275]  And that in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[00:28:23.275 --> 00:28:27.276]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[00:28:27.276 --> 00:28:29.056]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:28:29.056 --> 00:28:31.737]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[00:28:31.737 --> 00:28:33.998]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[00:28:33.998 --> 00:28:36.858]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:28:36.858 --> 00:28:46.141]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[00:28:46.841 --> 00:28:48.243]  And bull wars will continue to set fast.
[00:28:48.243 --> 00:28:48.784]  We fight this.
[00:28:48.784 --> 00:28:50.265]  I don't know how long we can.
[00:28:50.265 --> 00:28:51.647]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:53.249]  God bless and good luck.
[00:28:53.249 --> 00:28:54.771]  I would, again, get right with God right now.
[00:28:56.209 --> 00:29:02.296]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:29:02.296 --> 00:29:09.784]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:29:09.784 --> 00:29:12.086]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:29:12.086 --> 00:29:15.670]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:29:17.592 --> 00:29:25.758]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[00:29:25.758 --> 00:29:31.663]  You can help by giving everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[00:29:31.663 --> 00:29:42.391]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[00:29:42.391 --> 00:29:43.591]  Thank you and God bless.

[00:29:56.076 --> 00:29:59.698]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[00:29:59.698 --> 00:30:04.241]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:13.467]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[00:30:13.467 --> 00:30:17.590]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:35.438]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[00:30:36.027 --> 00:30:38.108]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:31:25.313 --> 00:31:33.578]  Silent weapons for quiet assaults.
[00:31:33.578 --> 00:31:46.225]  The Western world, the egalitarian Christian ethos must be destroyed and discredited, if the New World Order transhumanist post-human system is to take over and complete its goal.
[00:31:49.028 --> 00:32:00.153]  And they have not spent trillions of dollars and taken over the planet in the last hundred years to then, at the moment of truth, not execute their plan.
[00:32:00.153 --> 00:32:08.117]  But Satan has his plan and God has another plan and we have to decide which plan we want to be part of.
[00:32:08.117 --> 00:32:13.019]  But make no mistake, you got front row seats to Armageddon.
[00:32:15.828 --> 00:32:20.891]  It's all happening, and happening very fast.
[00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:25.134]  And if your church isn't telling you about it, they're with the bad guy.
[00:32:25.134 --> 00:32:29.596]  Through the World Council of Churches and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:32:29.596 --> 00:32:32.939]  You might want to look into that, the National Council of Churches and the rest of it.
[00:32:32.939 --> 00:32:35.300]  Your church is part of that?
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.882]  You know what's going on.
[00:32:38.882 --> 00:32:40.984]  Satan comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:32:40.984 --> 00:32:44.666]  And is that not what we see happening right now?
[00:32:46.167 --> 00:32:51.349]  And this system's very snake-like, very crafty.
[00:32:51.349 --> 00:32:54.771]  You notice what they're doing is discrediting every institution.
[00:32:54.771 --> 00:32:59.813]  The FBI, the police, by their actions.
[00:32:59.813 --> 00:33:02.874]  The family, the culture, manhood, motherhood.
[00:33:02.874 --> 00:33:12.939]  And now the medical system that's had its problems, but now is corporately, internationally owned.
[00:33:14.491 --> 00:33:39.794]  And it's merged in a revolving incestuous relationship with big tech, big pharma, big legacy dinosaur media.
[00:33:43.467 --> 00:34:10.214]  And then all the minions of academia and Hollywood and all the organizations and groups that spiritually have thrown in their lot with the cosmic con artist to bring in this total planetary world government system.
[00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:11.955]  And all they do is play good cop, bad cop.
[00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:18.633]  The globalists come out and prepare their new lockdowns that never went away in most areas of the planet.
[00:34:18.633 --> 00:34:24.036]  And then Fauci comes out and says, oh no no, we don't need new lockdowns, we just need more restrictions.
[00:34:24.036 --> 00:34:27.658]  We're not going to call it a lockdown because it's a permanent emergency.
[00:34:29.687 --> 00:34:33.948]  They call the beta a lockdown home arrest.
[00:34:33.948 --> 00:34:37.229]  They call the total takeover Freedom Day.
[00:34:37.229 --> 00:34:41.110]  And the bracelets you wear that track you via GPS, freedom bracelets.
[00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.070]  And the microchips your children take, freedom chips.
[00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:47.471]  These are real names, real things happening.
[00:34:47.471 --> 00:34:51.872]  As radical as anything I ever predicted happening, just as we said it would.
[00:34:51.872 --> 00:34:54.393]  Because it was always in the documents and the plans.
[00:34:55.854 --> 00:35:13.668]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote books in the 1970s that I read in the 1990s, early 1990s, before I even got on air, where they said, we'll have a technocracy that's run off of a digital implanted chip in your body.
[00:35:13.668 --> 00:35:20.013]  And we'll have records of everybody's activities, and if you don't conform to our New World Order, you will be shot out of the system.
[00:35:20.013 --> 00:35:22.495]  He wrote that when I was three or four years old.
[00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:32.732]  And now his evil daughter hosts a show, a psych-up show, on MSNBC.
[00:35:32.732 --> 00:35:33.493]  But I digress.
[00:35:33.493 --> 00:35:38.198]  Let me just restate the obvious here, and then I want to open the phones up next hour.
[00:35:38.198 --> 00:35:43.503]  On the forced inoculations, on being told you're not essential, on being told you've got a
[00:35:44.702 --> 00:35:47.344]  Stay in your house and not have a job and not have food.
[00:35:47.344 --> 00:35:50.285]  But when you go bankrupt, there won't be any money for you.
[00:35:50.285 --> 00:35:53.067]  Literally declaring total war.
[00:35:53.067 --> 00:35:58.310]  That's what Hitler first did was say, oh, my political enemies can't have jobs and can't have businesses.
[00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:59.871]  Then, oh, you got to live in a ghetto.
[00:35:59.871 --> 00:36:01.352]  You're not allowed to leave your neighborhood.
[00:36:01.352 --> 00:36:02.613]  Then you can't leave your house.
[00:36:02.613 --> 00:36:08.576]  And then, oh, we're going to take you somewhere where you can, you know, pay for your fair share as a forced laborer.
[00:36:08.576 --> 00:36:09.657]  And then you know what happened after that.
[00:36:10.728 --> 00:36:25.577]  And now we see all over the world, from Spain, to Germany, to Australia, to New Zealand, to the UK, to areas of the US, police brutalizing men, women, and children, running over them with Clydesdale horses, water canning, splitting people's heads, because they dared go outside!
[00:36:25.577 --> 00:36:28.419]  You don't go outside ever!
[00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:31.601]  You don't get the rights of a Soviet citizen under Stalin!
[00:36:31.601 --> 00:36:37.325]  You're more of a slave than somebody in North Korea!
[00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:46.475]  And you shouldn't be allowed to leave your house or have a job unless you have a digital passport on your phone showing you've had a shot.
[00:36:46.475 --> 00:36:55.043]  He told the left, hey, the average leftist, you know that's a digital tracking system for a social credit score designed to have big tech take over in their own admissions.
[00:36:55.043 --> 00:36:57.565]  They go, shut up, Nazi.
[00:36:57.565 --> 00:37:00.988]  When they're the ones doing things that Hitler could only dream of.
[00:37:02.478 --> 00:37:08.761]  Men in black uniforms and black riot helmets beating up men, women, and children because they dare go outside.
[00:37:08.761 --> 00:37:17.986]  And helicopters in Australia when families try to go to the park or go to the beach saying, you will be arrested, leave now!
[00:37:17.986 --> 00:37:19.066]  Leave now!
[00:37:19.066 --> 00:37:20.567]  You will all be arrested!
[00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:21.627]  Screw you!
[00:37:21.627 --> 00:37:24.249]  You'll be arrested, criminals!
[00:37:24.249 --> 00:37:27.550]  They've had nine deaths in the last seven months in Australia.
[00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.311]  They claim are COVID.
[00:37:29.298 --> 00:37:33.600]  And they set the precedent saying if there's one person with it, we'll never reopen.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.543]  Doesn't matter how many millions of suicides or deaths or bankruptcies.
[00:37:37.543 --> 00:37:38.643]  We're the heroes!
[00:37:38.643 --> 00:37:45.807]  Stay in your house forever!
[00:37:45.807 --> 00:37:48.009]  Total, complete tyranny.
[00:37:48.009 --> 00:37:50.910]  So let's lay it out.
[00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:51.571]  Let me just do this.
[00:37:51.571 --> 00:37:52.751]  I'm going to come back in the next segment.
[00:37:52.751 --> 00:37:54.072]  I'm going to lay out what's about to happen.
[00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:55.433]  But it's now confirmed.
[00:37:56.676 --> 00:38:00.200]  That people that are inoculated are the main group sick and dying.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:06.086]  That's why Fauci kept saying, 99% of the people that take the shot are safe.
[00:38:06.086 --> 00:38:09.229]  99% of the people in the hospital are dying.
[00:38:09.229 --> 00:38:10.410]  Didn't take the shot.
[00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:10.991]  All lies!
[00:38:12.844 --> 00:38:18.348]  Two weeks later, 75% of the people with COVID are sick and in hospitals.
[00:38:18.348 --> 00:38:24.333]  Same in Israel, same in Singapore, same in the U.S., same in Germany, same in Canada, have had the injection.
[00:38:24.333 --> 00:38:30.859]  And they're the majority of the folks dying of whatever's going on.
[00:38:30.859 --> 00:38:35.763]  But see, they're already the subservient ones, so, oh, now they gotta take another shot.
[00:38:35.763 --> 00:38:39.906]  And now Pfizer and Moderna just raised their prices worldwide.
[00:38:39.906 --> 00:38:42.048]  Oh, now you gotta pay!
[00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:46.311]  $300 for a shot.
[00:38:46.311 --> 00:38:49.852]  And they got the sheep lining up, and the sicker they get, give me another.
[00:38:49.852 --> 00:38:50.992]  Oh God, I got even sicker.
[00:38:50.992 --> 00:38:54.693]  It's like if you took a shotgun and blew one of your feet off, and you go, man, that hurts.
[00:38:54.693 --> 00:38:55.394]  Let me fix it.
[00:38:55.394 --> 00:38:58.515]  You just shot the ankle.
[00:38:58.515 --> 00:38:59.855]  Wow, that hurts even worse.
[00:38:59.855 --> 00:39:01.335]  Let me blow my leg off at the knee.
[00:39:01.335 --> 00:39:02.816]  Maybe that'll fix it.
[00:39:02.816 --> 00:39:04.076]  First, you blow your foot off.
[00:39:04.076 --> 00:39:05.357]  Then you blow your calf off.
[00:39:05.357 --> 00:39:06.337]  Then you blow your knee off.
[00:39:06.337 --> 00:39:07.377]  Then you go, you know what?
[00:39:07.377 --> 00:39:08.297]  This'll fix it.
[00:39:08.297 --> 00:39:12.139]  And you shove the shotgun barrel right in your mouth and pull the trigger.
[00:39:12.139 --> 00:39:12.779]  Say, I love Fauci.
[00:39:14.639 --> 00:39:17.026]  I mean, that's how insane this is!
[00:39:17.026 --> 00:39:19.835]  That's how out of control this is!
[00:39:22.119 --> 00:39:26.521]  Separately, this is the last day to get 2020 prices on storable foods.
[00:39:26.521 --> 00:39:30.883]  If you don't get storable foods, we've got high-quality ones ready to ship right now at the lowest price you're going to find.
[00:39:30.883 --> 00:39:31.924]  This is the best deal you're going to find.
[00:39:31.924 --> 00:39:33.204]  We have the biggest, best company.
[00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:34.865]  Had them for 13, 14 years.
[00:39:34.865 --> 00:39:36.166]  They were a small company when we first got them.
[00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:37.806]  They've been the biggest for about five years.
[00:39:37.806 --> 00:39:39.547]  Probably in the world, but definitely in the U.S.
[00:39:39.547 --> 00:39:42.609]  We have the entire MyPatriotSupply catalog.
[00:39:42.609 --> 00:39:43.569]  They're just in our back end.
[00:39:43.569 --> 00:39:44.149]  We're partners with them.
[00:39:44.149 --> 00:39:45.790]  They take the orders.
[00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:46.591]  You get an additional 10% off.
[00:39:46.591 --> 00:39:48.331]  You're not going to get anywhere else.
[00:39:48.331 --> 00:39:49.292]  And it ends today, 100%.
[00:39:49.292 --> 00:39:49.672]  And then it
[00:39:52.318 --> 00:39:56.400]  Doesn't come back until one week I'm allowed to do it in November, then their prices are going to go up.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:05.786]  Everybody else has already gone up on prices, but they bought a lot of food, big contracts, they're big enough to be able to actually do some of the same stuff Amazon or Walmart does to buy so much damn food in a warehouse.
[00:40:05.786 --> 00:40:11.390]  He's got a warehouse in Salt Lake City, they've got five of them around the country, that looks like he could park a Star Destroyer in it.
[00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:12.510]  I've never been in a building that big.
[00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.251]  I mean, it's just like...
[00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:15.212]  There's like mist at the end of it.
[00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:16.053]  It's so damn huge.
[00:40:16.053 --> 00:40:17.294]  Full of food.
[00:40:17.294 --> 00:40:19.857]  And almost half that's been sold out.
[00:40:19.857 --> 00:40:21.878]  He's just bringing it in as fast as he can.
[00:40:21.878 --> 00:40:23.620]  But he knew it was coming.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.501]  And smart guys.
[00:40:24.501 --> 00:40:29.265]  And so they bought tons of it last year and this year to lock in those prices.
[00:40:29.265 --> 00:40:30.306]  But it's going up soon.
[00:40:31.227 --> 00:40:32.748]  So I would get it locked in now.
[00:40:32.748 --> 00:40:38.050]  InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:39.110]  888-253-3139.
[00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:42.492]  And this is the last week of X2 selling out.
[00:40:42.492 --> 00:40:44.652]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, stock up on that.
[00:40:44.652 --> 00:40:47.253]  InfoWarsTore.com, your X2 selling out.
[00:40:47.253 --> 00:40:51.875]  And the last week of privacy pouches to protect your privacy from contact tracers at 50% off, $14.95.
[00:40:54.295 --> 00:40:57.998]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[00:40:57.998 --> 00:41:07.485]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[00:41:07.485 --> 00:41:14.169]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 20-20 prices.
[00:41:14.169 --> 00:41:17.712]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[00:41:17.712 --> 00:41:20.114]  Their entire catalog is at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:41:20.114 --> 00:41:23.036]  You get an additional 10% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:41:23.336 --> 00:41:25.416]  But only for one more week.
[00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.877]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[00:41:27.877 --> 00:41:28.917]  But that's it.
[00:41:28.917 --> 00:41:31.318]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[00:41:31.318 --> 00:41:33.518]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[00:41:33.518 --> 00:41:35.499]  This is insurance you can eat.
[00:41:35.499 --> 00:41:36.779]  It's the highest quality.
[00:41:36.779 --> 00:41:37.959]  Hundreds of high-quality foods.
[00:41:37.959 --> 00:41:39.660]  Three-month, six-month year supplies.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:43.160]  All ready for you at InfoWareStore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:41:46.081 --> 00:41:48.944]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:42:04.724 --> 00:42:09.485]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.

[00:43:09.634 --> 00:43:11.936]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:43:11.936 --> 00:43:15.519]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.

[00:43:55.630 --> 00:44:03.158]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[00:44:03.158 --> 00:44:04.980]  The globalists are out in the open with their
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.361]  Planetary depopulation takeover.
[00:44:07.361 --> 00:44:08.662]  They're a robot takeover.
[00:44:08.662 --> 00:44:16.526]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[00:44:16.526 --> 00:44:17.987]  Humanity is strong.
[00:44:17.987 --> 00:44:18.968]  We're incredible.
[00:44:18.968 --> 00:44:22.730]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.871]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[00:44:25.191 --> 00:44:31.498]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[00:44:31.498 --> 00:44:40.889]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.

[00:44:43.511 --> 00:44:46.174]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.

[00:44:51.499 --> 00:44:58.365]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[00:44:58.365 --> 00:45:00.988]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:24.204 --> 00:45:27.897]  You take a mortal man, you put him in control.
[00:46:17.918 --> 00:46:20.980]  We are now in the symphony of destruction.
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:27.803]  The globalist fabled world government Mark of the Beast rollout.
[00:46:27.803 --> 00:46:37.368]  I'll never forget, there was a guy that put on for a couple of years these events, we get 200, 300, 500 people at them, called Texas Best Seminars, I forget his name.
[00:46:37.368 --> 00:46:42.391]  And one night after one of these seminars, I was one of the speakers, we went to dinner, a little diner.
[00:46:44.778 --> 00:46:50.301]  And I remember Wes was there, one of the first times I met Wes who became one of our main engineers.
[00:46:50.301 --> 00:46:53.903]  And I'm sitting there eating pancakes at the counter with this guy like nine at night.
[00:46:53.903 --> 00:47:02.147]  I said, the mark of the beast, you know, it's gonna be a microchip in your hand and they'll track you and control you if you're not on good terms with the government.
[00:47:02.147 --> 00:47:06.370]  He goes, no, that's not it.
[00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:09.812]  A friend of mine at my church, wherever it was in East Texas or wherever, had a vision.
[00:47:10.578 --> 00:47:18.825]  And it's going to be a vaccine that changes all your DNA, and that actually makes you sick and ill, and you're going to have to have new shots all the time just to stay alive.
[00:47:18.825 --> 00:47:21.007]  It's a binary weapon.
[00:47:21.007 --> 00:47:30.234]  And my friend had this vision, and he got up in front of the church, he told everyone, and, you know, my friend is never the type of guy to lie, and he said that basically God told him all this.
[00:47:30.234 --> 00:47:31.936]  And I'm like, okay.
[00:47:31.936 --> 00:47:34.338]  And I never forgot that.
[00:47:34.338 --> 00:47:37.080]  That's 25 years, 26 years later.
[00:47:42.475 --> 00:47:45.636]  And here we are.
[00:47:45.636 --> 00:47:47.936]  And I'll never forget that.
[00:47:47.936 --> 00:47:49.476]  Because it just sunk in when he said it.
[00:47:49.476 --> 00:47:50.757]  He said, it's a genetic mark.
[00:47:50.757 --> 00:47:53.897]  It takes over all your cells.
[00:47:53.897 --> 00:47:54.957]  Takes over every cell in your body.
[00:47:54.957 --> 00:47:56.058]  And he talked like five minutes.
[00:47:56.058 --> 00:47:57.678]  He got all... Because I knew that guy.
[00:47:57.678 --> 00:47:58.398]  Well, he was a nice guy.
[00:47:58.398 --> 00:47:59.958]  He didn't usually get wild-eyed like I would.
[00:47:59.958 --> 00:48:01.399]  He got real wild-eyed about it.
[00:48:01.399 --> 00:48:02.939]  Like, turned to me and said, that's not what it is.
[00:48:02.939 --> 00:48:04.339]  This is it.
[00:48:04.339 --> 00:48:07.300]  And, man, did that not turn out to be true?
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:07.800]  Prophetic!
[00:48:12.418 --> 00:48:19.445]  You see, our enemies aren't dialed into that, but they're dialed into their own spiritual internet, and they're given their spirit, their idea, their program.
[00:48:19.445 --> 00:48:20.766]  And you know what it is?
[00:48:20.766 --> 00:48:28.593]  Get their children, destroy their families, poison them, hurt yourself, cut yourself, kill yourself.
[00:48:28.593 --> 00:48:32.357]  Imagine being without God, and all you hear is, kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself.
[00:48:33.462 --> 00:48:38.506]  Unless you go kidnap a little girl out of the backyard and torture her, then you feel good and empowered.
[00:48:38.506 --> 00:48:41.970]  And the demons tell you how wonderful you are and how beautiful you are.
[00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:47.314]  And that's what almost every psychotic killer actually tells their psychiatrists and psychologists.
[00:48:47.314 --> 00:48:51.038]  And it's in the criminology books, but not on the national news, not on Court TV.
[00:48:52.395 --> 00:49:00.041]  I've interviewed a lot of the top psychiatrists, the quote, serial killers, I've had several of them on, and I bring that up, they go, no, you're absolutely right.
[00:49:00.041 --> 00:49:09.829]  They feel alone and haunted by demons unless they're torturing a man, a woman, or a child.
[00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:16.335]  You call it an alternate ego, whatever it is, but certain demons want children, want a boy, want a girl, want a woman, want a man.
[00:49:18.968 --> 00:49:21.349]  Certain demons want to kill a white person.
[00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:23.169]  Certain demons want to kill a black person.
[00:49:23.169 --> 00:49:29.431]  And you can say, well, whatever it is, maybe it's an artificial program, something left in our archetypal DNA.
[00:49:29.431 --> 00:49:30.531]  I don't know.
[00:49:30.531 --> 00:49:33.312]  I just know it's real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:33.312 --> 00:49:38.133]  And if you're a Klaus Schwab or a Bill Gates, you want to murder people.
[00:49:38.133 --> 00:49:39.533]  And you want to murder their genetics.
[00:49:39.533 --> 00:49:41.114]  And you want to mutate them.
[00:49:41.114 --> 00:49:42.734]  And you want them to die slowly.
[00:49:44.674 --> 00:49:46.615]  And it makes you feel big and powerful.
[00:49:46.615 --> 00:50:01.900]  I mean, Zbigniew Brzezinski would get up at speeches, and they would introduce him at the CFR about, he didn't run the Khmer Rouge that killed one-third of Cambodia and stopped the communists, which they just put something in even worse, but he had the Khmer Rouge do it.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:04.681]  Zbigniew Brzezinski, I've read the transcript.
[00:50:04.681 --> 00:50:07.422]  He killed one-third of the country!
[00:50:07.422 --> 00:50:10.223]  They're all just like, oh, glorious, sir, glorious.
[00:50:13.587 --> 00:50:16.308]  And until you get your mind wrapped around that, there's no hope.
[00:50:16.308 --> 00:50:30.591]  Until you realize these people are focused, psychotic murderers, who are simply working around the clock, trying to figure out how they can get away with killing you.
[00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:36.352]  And if they can do it through a poison injection that grows prions in your body, that then sloughs off and makes other people sick,
[00:50:37.614 --> 00:50:44.556]  And then even say, hey, those of you that have the shot, you're the bad ones, you've got to have more, then they're going to grow more and kill more of us!
[00:50:44.556 --> 00:50:48.757]  Because they've murdered logic, because so many people don't have a spirit of discernment.
[00:50:48.757 --> 00:50:55.098]  If you reject a God, the program of understanding is withdrawn.
[00:50:55.098 --> 00:51:02.320]  The deeper you get into following God's directives, I don't know, a lot of you want to be able to handle this, and I think a lot of you already are handling it.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:05.641]  I mean, look at that guy 25 years ago, everything was about to happen and it all unfolded.
[00:51:07.597 --> 00:51:08.937]  I just have a big platform.
[00:51:08.937 --> 00:51:20.821]  But let me tell you, I've been given a vision of what's going to happen, and I know now, not just off their own admissions, their own documents, but now I do understand what's going to happen from discernment even greater, and it's horrifying.
[00:51:20.821 --> 00:51:22.081]  But you know what?
[00:51:22.081 --> 00:51:27.783]  You're given that information so you can do something about it and stop it, not so you just curl up in a ball and crap yourself.
[00:51:30.347 --> 00:51:33.209]  So plead the blood of Jesus, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:33.209 --> 00:51:38.532]  That's all I can tell you because you're getting front row seats to just evil turned loose.
[00:51:38.532 --> 00:51:41.914]  Like, I mean, you're going to look back on 2021 like a cakewalk.
[00:51:41.914 --> 00:51:44.816]  You're going to look back on 2020 like a parade.
[00:51:44.816 --> 00:51:48.078]  You're going to look back on 2019 like sunshine at the beach.
[00:51:48.078 --> 00:51:49.639]  You're going to look back on those years.
[00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:53.141]  Like you're going to look back on the worst years of your life.
[00:51:53.141 --> 00:51:56.623]  Like they were heaven with what's going to happen.
[00:51:58.581 --> 00:51:59.602]  And don't just believe me.
[00:51:59.602 --> 00:52:02.065]  Klaus Schwab and all of them say, oh, this never ends.
[00:52:02.065 --> 00:52:04.548]  It only gets deeper.
[00:52:04.548 --> 00:52:08.814]  You will look back on COVID as a happy time.
[00:52:08.814 --> 00:52:11.137]  And what does George Soros say?
[00:52:11.137 --> 00:52:12.859]  He says on NPR and 60 Minutes.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.341]  It was the happiest time of my life rounding up the people.
[00:52:17.341 --> 00:52:18.981]  I called it happy-making.
[00:52:18.981 --> 00:52:26.023]  My father, I, such confluence with the SS officers, arresting and taking their property, and I saw nothing wrong with it.
[00:52:26.023 --> 00:52:28.664]  I was fulfilling an area of the economy.
[00:52:28.664 --> 00:52:30.685]  If I had not done it, someone else would have.
[00:52:30.685 --> 00:52:32.805]  Those are quotes.
[00:52:32.805 --> 00:52:34.446]  And the left just fawns.
[00:52:34.446 --> 00:52:36.086]  They call us Nazis.
[00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:37.747]  Oh, we love you!
[00:52:37.747 --> 00:52:39.887]  We love you, George Soros!
[00:52:39.887 --> 00:52:42.248]  I mean, talk about grand illusion.
[00:52:44.076 --> 00:52:45.417]  You want me to play him saying all that?
[00:52:45.417 --> 00:52:48.598]  I can play it for you.
[00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:50.960]  It was the best time of my life.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.061]  It was exhilarating.
[00:52:53.061 --> 00:52:56.282]  I called it happy making.
[00:52:56.282 --> 00:52:57.243]  Happy making.
[00:52:58.803 --> 00:53:03.545]  Would you like to happy make with me?
[00:53:03.545 --> 00:53:08.346]  Oh, and when Jim Soros is on the stage with Klaus Schwab, he hugs him and gets tears in his eyes.
[00:53:08.346 --> 00:53:12.568]  We're killing everyone!
[00:53:12.568 --> 00:53:13.908]  I feel so good!
[00:53:13.908 --> 00:53:23.251]  Oh, but if you talk bad about Klaus Schwab on him, ADL say you Nazi.
[00:53:23.251 --> 00:53:25.012]  Oh, okay ADL.
[00:53:26.423 --> 00:53:31.467]  And you look at the ADL leader, looks like his soul got sucked out by a giant satanic spider.
[00:53:31.467 --> 00:53:36.411]  Thank God we're not with that poor man.
[00:53:36.411 --> 00:53:38.953]  I pity these people, ladies and gentlemen, because they don't know God.
[00:53:38.953 --> 00:53:44.697]  They are cut off from God and they just have a sinister hate for all of us that love God.
[00:53:44.697 --> 00:53:46.779]  And they want to ravenously destroy us.
[00:53:50.512 --> 00:53:58.815]  Yeah, now they're going to run, not just in the UK, all over the world, they're buying up all the COVID testing labs because they're going to have your data and decide when you travel.
[00:53:58.815 --> 00:54:06.458]  All right, I'll start the next hour and I'll get into it.
[00:54:06.458 --> 00:54:10.219]  But here's the big takeaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:10.219 --> 00:54:12.660]  Here's the big takeaway.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.840]  They admit the vaccines don't work and they admit it.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.761]  The majority of people sick and dying are on them.
[00:54:17.761 --> 00:54:19.162]  And they admit they're infecting other people.
[00:54:20.987 --> 00:54:22.648]  Likely predicted.
[00:54:22.648 --> 00:54:26.029]  And they don't even care, and they say, oh, that's the reason.
[00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:31.871]  We trust the science and put more masks on you and control you, and it's the unvaccinated's fault.
[00:54:31.871 --> 00:54:33.232]  You're like, that doesn't have any logic.
[00:54:33.232 --> 00:54:34.892]  It's not supposed to have logic.
[00:54:34.892 --> 00:54:43.155]  It's meant to just make you turn your brain off because you're being fed such crap and discredit what's left of our country before it collapses.
[00:54:43.155 --> 00:54:45.196]  Maximum Red Alert's the headline today for the show.
[00:54:45.196 --> 00:54:49.358]  Major governments confirm COVID-19 vaccinated, spreading new deadly plague.
[00:54:50.709 --> 00:54:52.130]  Hospitals were empty last year.
[00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.770]  That was all a hoax.
[00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:53.991]  They're full right now.
[00:54:53.991 --> 00:54:54.711]  COVID-19.
[00:54:54.711 --> 00:54:59.414]  New, deadlier coronavirus variant that could kill one in three infected people.
[00:54:59.414 --> 00:55:03.016]  A realistic possibility, says the UK government.
[00:55:03.016 --> 00:55:18.565]  What that really means is every one-third of the public, or a large portion of those that are vaccinated, which they now admit the majority are vaccinated, are going to be dying and they're going to call it a new variant when it's what is growing in your body, the spike protein that's killing you, that all the studies and all the scientists and all the facts show.
[00:55:21.107 --> 00:55:30.092]  And the highest vaccinated places, Israel, Iceland, Gibraltar, have the highest levels of people in the hospital dying of COVID-19.
[00:55:30.092 --> 00:55:34.715]  But like the White House Deputy Press Secretary said, because the experts say so.
[00:55:34.715 --> 00:55:35.796]  Okay.
[00:55:35.796 --> 00:55:42.260]  Your calls and a ton of news and a lot more, coming up in hour number two, InfoWars.com.
[00:55:44.844 --> 00:55:50.930]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:58.437]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:55:58.437 --> 00:56:00.739]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:56:00.739 --> 00:56:04.322]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:56:06.224 --> 00:56:14.410]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:20.315]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[00:56:20.315 --> 00:56:31.043]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[00:56:31.043 --> 00:56:32.243]  Thank you and God bless.

[00:56:46.547 --> 00:56:53.312]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[00:56:53.312 --> 00:56:56.895]  And that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[00:56:56.895 --> 00:56:58.056]  Even more the general public.
[00:56:58.056 --> 00:57:00.418]  They do the same things over and over again.
[00:57:00.418 --> 00:57:04.862]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[00:57:06.038 --> 00:57:06.859]  Well, guess what?
[00:57:06.859 --> 00:57:20.851]  It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenicist Globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV, and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[00:57:22.052 --> 00:57:27.557]  ...of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[00:57:27.557 --> 00:57:33.923]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[00:57:33.923 --> 00:57:43.232]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[00:57:43.232 --> 00:57:44.333]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:48.442 --> 00:57:51.047]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:58:03.612 --> 00:58:05.094]  The real reason the Democrats don't
[00:58:19.255 --> 00:58:36.366]  Want to investigate the evolution of the rioting that kicked off seven years earlier with the riots in Ferguson, Missouri that mutated into Marxist violence during Trump's inauguration and exploded into 567 riots killing at least 25 people doing well over $2 billion worth of damage
[00:58:41.169 --> 00:58:50.115]  And targeting federal, state, and local government buildings after the death of George Floyd, greased by cloud and piven on our southern border.
[00:58:50.115 --> 00:58:56.639]  We are learning new details about the man who threw explosive devices at an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington.
[00:58:56.639 --> 00:58:58.100]  He was shot and killed by police.
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:09.288]  And an apparent fraudulent election that no one in Congress would transparently explain eventually led to the cause and effect response at the Capitol on January 6th.
[00:59:09.288 --> 00:59:12.770]  This is the investigation that needs to take place.
[00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:25.059]  Democrats abandoned their constitutional duty and embraced the dark forces of their closeted bigotry and fanned the flames of political tyranny and their lust for power.
[00:59:25.379 --> 00:59:31.261]  Power they would shamefully shed crocodile tears for in a recent sham hearing.
[00:59:31.261 --> 00:59:38.844]  Power the Capitol Police would lie for in order to designate the rest of those in their way as domestic terrorists.
[00:59:38.844 --> 00:59:43.866]  The terrorists alternated between attempting to break our defenses and shouting at or attempting to convert us.
[00:59:44.466 --> 00:59:51.030]  And we are being told this is the worst attack against democracy since the Civil War, which is ludicrous.
[00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:58.914]  In 1915, a German man, who had been a Harvard professor, detonated a bomb inside the Capitol in an attempt to deter the U.S.
[00:59:58.914 --> 01:00:04.457]  from entering World War I. The bomber also murdered his pregnant wife and shot financier J.P.
[01:00:04.457 --> 01:00:05.517]  Morgan, Jr.
[01:00:05.517 --> 01:00:09.780]  Was it worse than the attack on Congress by Lolita LeBron in 1954, who Jimmy Carter pardoned?
[01:00:16.809 --> 01:00:22.733]  Firing more than 20 rounds from their Luger automatics, the three fanatics seriously wounded five senators.
[01:00:22.733 --> 01:00:29.417]  Alvin Bentley wounded near the heart and in the stomach, and Representative Halleck shows where a bullet ripped into his desk.
[01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:33.820]  Another Puerto Rican has since been accused of threatening to kill President Eisenhower.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:41.765]  Still defiant, and still unrepentant, Mrs. Lebron and her partners made the attack to draw attention to Puerto Rico's demands for complete independence.
[01:00:42.944 --> 01:00:48.146]  At one minute before one o'clock this morning, the switchboard at the Capitol received a phone call.
[01:00:48.146 --> 01:00:52.127]  A man's voice said a bomb would go off in the building in half an hour.
[01:00:52.127 --> 01:00:54.127]  At 1.30 in the morning, it did.
[01:00:54.127 --> 01:01:03.810]  In a small, unmarked restroom on the ground floor of the Senate side, next to a barbershop and near several small offices, including one committee hearing room.
[01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:11.740]  There were telephone bomb threats to 22 other Washington buildings yesterday and two more today, all false alarms.
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:18.409]  Credit for the Capitol bombing was claimed in a letter received by the Associated Press today signed by the Weather Underground.
[01:01:18.409 --> 01:01:21.493]  Ho Chi Minh's birthday was also marked in Washington.
[01:01:21.853 --> 01:01:28.399]  A bomb exploded early this morning in the Pentagon and left-wing terrorists telephoned newspapers to say they were responsible.
[01:01:28.399 --> 01:01:34.965]  It's hard to argue with the effectiveness of that bomb that went off in a third-floor washroom here at the State Department early this morning.
[01:01:34.965 --> 01:01:38.528]  Was it worse than Susan Rosenberg's bombing of the U.S.
[01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.451]  Capitol's North Wing in 1983?
[01:01:41.451 --> 01:01:48.097]  Rosenberg was pardoned by Bill Clinton in 2001 and is now a powerful leader of the ELM movement.
[01:01:48.457 --> 01:01:54.561]  An anti-American communist movement that should be imprisoned under Eisenhower's Communist Control Act of 1954.
[01:01:54.561 --> 01:01:58.263]  I want to ask you about Black Lives Matter.
[01:01:58.263 --> 01:02:11.852]  Its finances and some of its fundraising is actually managed by an activist group, Thousand Currents, which is sponsored by a charity set up by the Kellogg's
[01:02:12.552 --> 01:02:16.015]  The fact is, most of the political prisoners sitting in Biden's tomb-like prison
[01:02:30.225 --> 01:02:31.666]  We're waved into a U.S.
[01:02:31.666 --> 01:02:45.898]  Capitol that wasn't burned to the ground or destroyed from within because those so-called insurrectionists were patriotic Americans that the Democrat Marxist regime had pushed too far.
[01:02:45.898 --> 01:02:47.800]  And everybody knows it.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.341]  Enough of the charade.
[01:02:49.341 --> 01:02:54.205]  Those so-called insurrectionists need to be freed today.
[01:02:54.205 --> 01:02:55.486]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:02:55.846 --> 01:03:01.929]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[01:03:01.929 --> 01:03:09.432]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[01:03:09.432 --> 01:03:11.734]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[01:03:11.734 --> 01:03:15.315]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[01:03:17.236 --> 01:03:25.401]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:31.304]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[01:03:31.304 --> 01:03:42.050]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:43.311]  Thank you and God bless.
[01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:49.718]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[01:03:57.059 --> 01:03:57.679]  We've got it.
[01:03:57.679 --> 01:04:04.203]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:04:04.203 --> 01:04:08.586]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:04:08.586 --> 01:04:14.250]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:04:15.879 --> 01:04:32.056]  Well, it's not just Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones and Senator Rand Paul pointing out the whole COVID rollout and operation of psychological warfare and putting us into a form of subservient martial law under the directives of the United Nations.
[01:04:32.056 --> 01:04:36.880]  Now it's Bill Maher coming out in the last three weeks in a row saying,
[01:04:38.095 --> 01:04:39.877]  America looks like the Soviet Union.
[01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:43.219]  The Olympics look like the Soviet Union or North Korea.
[01:04:43.219 --> 01:04:44.881]  The left's completely out of control.
[01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.202]  And some listeners saw me cut a report on that on Saturday.
[01:04:47.202 --> 01:04:49.725]  They said, don't say nice things about Bill Maher.
[01:04:49.725 --> 01:04:52.427]  I don't trust Bill Maher as far as I can throw him.
[01:04:52.427 --> 01:05:02.515]  But what does it say about Bill Maher that he knows his whole audience is pissed off about the second lockdown, knows the masker fraud, and knows that everything we're seeing around the world is dangerous?
[01:05:02.515 --> 01:05:04.236]  He said, let people have ivermectin.
[01:05:04.236 --> 01:05:06.298]  Stop suppressing drugs.
[01:05:06.298 --> 01:05:07.319]  Big tech's lying.
[01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:14.752]  You know, there are a lot of people that have worked with the system who might decide the system's going to destroy them.
[01:05:14.752 --> 01:05:24.396]  And if they're going to come join us, or at least start agreeing with us, we need to roll the red carpet out and say, I'm not going to turn my back on you.
[01:05:24.396 --> 01:05:26.837]  But I would sure like to see you start telling the truth all the time.
[01:05:26.837 --> 01:05:29.158]  And when you do it, I'm going to praise you.
[01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:31.059]  I mean, Tucker Carlson thought I was a horrible person.
[01:05:32.967 --> 01:05:43.997]  Fourteen, fifteen years ago, and then, I'm not going to give the whole story, privately called me and said, well, I see you're right about a lot of stuff and you mean well, and then we became friends over the years, I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:05:43.997 --> 01:05:44.817]  Now we're good friends.
[01:05:44.817 --> 01:05:48.020]  And the media hates that and knows that, and Tucker doesn't hide that, and it's just the way it is.
[01:05:50.202 --> 01:05:53.204]  People can look at Tucker's show and say, wow, it sounds like Alex Jones wrote this.
[01:05:53.204 --> 01:05:53.864]  No.
[01:05:53.864 --> 01:05:57.466]  Tucker sees it now and sees it as good as I do or better.
[01:05:57.466 --> 01:05:58.566]  He doesn't need my help.
[01:05:58.566 --> 01:06:02.488]  He just was naive and thought other people were nice like him.
[01:06:02.488 --> 01:06:06.730]  He projected the fact that he's a nice guy and believed the government really wanted to help people.
[01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:10.552]  And then he finally woke up about 10 years ago and now he's super woke.
[01:06:10.552 --> 01:06:13.774]  You know, the real woke.
[01:06:13.774 --> 01:06:16.655]  Because see, I'm not trying to get you to see through my eyes.
[01:06:16.655 --> 01:06:18.076]  I'm just trying to get you to see.
[01:06:18.076 --> 01:06:19.557]  Take the Rowdy Piper
[01:06:21.505 --> 01:06:21.765]  I don't
[01:06:48.086 --> 01:06:50.447]  And he's like, oh my god, how long has this been going on?
[01:06:50.447 --> 01:06:52.268]  What the hell's going on?
[01:06:52.268 --> 01:06:58.572]  And now he doesn't want to fight with Piper, and Piper doesn't want to fight with him, because now they understand they're both under attack.
[01:06:58.572 --> 01:07:02.094]  So, I don't want to fight with the Democrats.
[01:07:02.094 --> 01:07:06.056]  I don't want to fight with CNN.
[01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:09.698]  I don't want to fight with Black Rifle Coffee Company.
[01:07:09.698 --> 01:07:14.961]  I don't want to be involved in all this stupidness.
[01:07:14.961 --> 01:07:16.662]  I want you to put the damn glasses on.
[01:07:18.482 --> 01:07:27.364]  And right now, folks, things are so serious and so real, there is no way you can't see.
[01:07:27.364 --> 01:07:29.265]  The glasses are on regardless.
[01:07:29.265 --> 01:07:36.847]  You're just denying what you see right in front of your face.
[01:07:36.847 --> 01:07:47.630]  And how much more pain do we gotta go through until you finally realize you've been conned, you finally realize you've been lied to, and you finally realize that only waking up and waking other people up
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.162]  Is gonna give us any type of hope.
[01:07:51.162 --> 01:07:55.225]  Just put the glasses on and look at it!
[01:07:55.225 --> 01:07:55.806]  Look at it!
[01:07:55.806 --> 01:07:57.687]  It's not denied!
[01:07:57.687 --> 01:08:03.652]  All you gotta have is a little bit of memory and think back to what's going on and you're gonna see it right there in front of you.
[01:08:03.652 --> 01:08:09.117]  And believe me, baby, just like Morpheus says in the Matrix, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
[01:08:09.117 --> 01:08:11.199]  You take the blue pill, you go back to Wonderland.
[01:08:11.199 --> 01:08:15.022]  You take the red pill, and I show you how deep it goes.
[01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:29.268]  And you put the glasses on, folks, and you see people feeding on you and your family predators.
[01:08:29.268 --> 01:08:36.832]  I want to give the number out specifically on what I covered last hour to give us your story of vaccines, your family story of vaccines.
[01:08:36.832 --> 01:08:37.273]  You love them.
[01:08:37.273 --> 01:08:38.553]  You hate them.
[01:08:38.553 --> 01:08:39.534]  Again, they're not vaccines.
[01:08:39.534 --> 01:08:43.076]  These genetically modified injections.
[01:08:48.652 --> 01:08:54.815]  And I'm going to recap these headlines for you, in case you're a new listener, and then we're going to go to your calls.
[01:08:54.815 --> 01:08:58.236]  But you understand, this is very elementary.
[01:08:58.236 --> 01:09:01.317]  Obviously, they were always going to infect people with the spike protein.
[01:09:01.317 --> 01:09:04.919]  We didn't just say that now, and it's not just admitted now.
[01:09:04.919 --> 01:09:08.320]  That's admitted.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:15.083]  We showed you all the medical literature we had the experts on, that in every mammal study with these shots, they've done it forever.
[01:09:16.124 --> 01:09:22.146]  For 50 years, longer, they've been trying to find a vaccine for the common cold.
[01:09:22.146 --> 01:09:30.989]  But because the common cold is caused by a giant spectrum of different proteins, when your body gets out of whack, you get sick, they call them viruses.
[01:09:30.989 --> 01:09:37.151]  If you create something to target that, it will attack your own body.
[01:09:37.151 --> 01:09:38.372]  And now it's happened.
[01:09:38.372 --> 01:09:40.592]  And now they admit, worldwide, the average number is 75%.
[01:09:42.941 --> 01:09:45.203]  Of the infections in Austin, Texas.
[01:09:45.203 --> 01:09:47.484]  Of the infections in Massachusetts.
[01:09:47.484 --> 01:09:49.426]  Of the infections in Israel.
[01:09:49.426 --> 01:09:51.407]  Of the infections in Gibraltar.
[01:09:51.407 --> 01:09:53.228]  Of the infections in Singapore.
[01:09:53.228 --> 01:09:55.330]  Of the infections everywhere.
[01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:56.150]  Are the vaccinated.
[01:09:56.150 --> 01:10:01.754]  And the people are being studied and tested.
[01:10:01.754 --> 01:10:04.896]  And they all have blood clots.
[01:10:04.896 --> 01:10:06.697]  In the D-Dotter test.
[01:10:06.697 --> 01:10:08.559]  Which is a very old, documented, real test.
[01:10:10.376 --> 01:10:22.227]  And they're infectious, giving you a synthetic, digitally created prion code that is growing in people.
[01:10:22.227 --> 01:10:23.848]  So, it's all confirmed now.
[01:10:23.848 --> 01:10:29.193]  Exactly what the former Chief Scientist of Operations at Pfizer said.
[01:10:29.193 --> 01:10:32.076]  He only retired two years ago.
[01:10:32.076 --> 01:10:33.898]  What the Chief EU Advisor said.
[01:10:35.788 --> 01:10:39.631]  That's what the Dean of Baylor Medical School said to Congress.
[01:10:39.631 --> 01:10:41.192]  I didn't even know this.
[01:10:41.192 --> 01:10:42.333]  It happened months ago.
[01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:43.754]  I saw the clip last night.
[01:10:43.754 --> 01:10:47.117]  Saw it yesterday, played it last night.
[01:10:47.117 --> 01:10:51.040]  I mean, this is crazy!
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.341]  That they actually did it.
[01:10:52.341 --> 01:10:54.322]  Here it is.
[01:10:54.322 --> 01:10:55.303]  Maximum red alert.
[01:10:55.303 --> 01:10:58.165]  Major governments confirm COVID-19 vaccine spreading.
[01:10:58.165 --> 01:10:58.886]  New deadly plague.
[01:11:00.555 --> 01:11:01.316]  Here's Sky News.
[01:11:01.316 --> 01:11:06.539]  COVID-19, new deadly coronavirus variant that could kill one in three infected people.
[01:11:06.539 --> 01:11:09.781]  A realistic possibility, says the British government officially.
[01:11:09.781 --> 01:11:11.322]  Sage is the agency.
[01:11:11.322 --> 01:11:14.524]  And they say, normally things mutate and become less lethal.
[01:11:14.524 --> 01:11:15.885]  This is becoming more lethal.
[01:11:15.885 --> 01:11:17.486]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[01:11:17.486 --> 01:11:20.889]  I just know it's their cover for everybody getting sick and dying that's taking the shots.
[01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:36.527]  And I just know that I know a lot of people in medical care, and so I conducted my own survey the last few weeks, because I noticed a lot of people I know have been very sick with lung stuff, but they're told, oh no, you don't get COVID when you go in to get tested, because they don't want the numbers up yet.
[01:11:36.527 --> 01:11:38.529]  They just turn the PCR test down.
[01:11:38.529 --> 01:11:40.970]  And then I talked to people that work in hospitals, and they said, no, we're full.
[01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:42.011]  People can't breathe.
[01:11:42.011 --> 01:11:43.532]  They're almost all vaccinated.
[01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:44.893]  So I was telling you that weeks ago.
[01:11:44.893 --> 01:11:46.954]  Here it is in the reports.
[01:11:46.954 --> 01:11:48.115]  Remember Israel first came out?
[01:11:48.115 --> 01:11:51.357]  I said this three weeks ago, and they said, oh, they're crazy?
[01:11:51.357 --> 01:11:52.658]  They had six million people in their study?
[01:11:56.087 --> 01:11:59.449]  But the White House Press Secretary says, trust the experts, do what we say.
[01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:03.311]  Oh, I do trust all the real experts, not you and not Fauci.
[01:12:03.311 --> 01:12:09.655]  Here it is, Gibraltar, Iceland see massive COVID spike despite over 90% population vaccinated.
[01:12:09.655 --> 01:12:14.658]  Vaccinated people make up 75% of recent COVID cases in Singapore.
[01:12:14.658 --> 01:12:20.821]  Majority of COVID-19 cases at large public events were among vaccinated Americans.
[01:12:20.821 --> 01:12:24.063]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[01:12:25.930 --> 01:12:28.052]  They're trying to blame the unvaccinated.
[01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:30.515]  That's just some of what I've got right here.
[01:12:30.515 --> 01:12:32.917]  I want to take your call on this.
[01:12:32.917 --> 01:12:34.198]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:12:34.198 --> 01:12:36.641]  I want your view and what you're witnessing.
[01:12:36.641 --> 01:12:40.044]  If you're a medical worker, a doctor, a nurse, are you seeing full areas?
[01:12:40.044 --> 01:12:41.766]  Because you called in last year and said it was a hoax.
[01:12:41.766 --> 01:12:42.306]  It wasn't.
[01:12:42.306 --> 01:12:43.387]  We went and proved it was.
[01:12:43.387 --> 01:12:44.529]  I'm hearing it is full.
[01:12:45.882 --> 01:12:46.703]  After you took the shot.
[01:12:46.703 --> 01:12:48.284]  See how the plan works?
[01:12:48.284 --> 01:12:51.005]  And then in the winter it gets really bad and they blame the unvaccinated.
[01:12:51.005 --> 01:12:53.988]  They're already trying that, but the truth's getting out ahead of them.
[01:12:53.988 --> 01:12:56.069]  Toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:12:56.069 --> 01:12:56.289]  877-789-Alex.
[01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:56.349]  877-789-2539.
[01:12:56.349 --> 01:13:00.352]  For people specifically with what you've witnessed, what you've seen, your take on this.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:18.863]  And again, I don't just believe the British Ministry of Defense and the NIH or their National Health Service.
[01:13:18.863 --> 01:13:22.225]  I don't just believe them when they say this could kill a third of the people on Earth.
[01:13:22.225 --> 01:13:24.826]  But I know that's the globalist goal is to kill 90%.
[01:13:24.826 --> 01:13:29.028]  And I know they rolled out a vaccine that doesn't protect, that isn't a vaccine, that grows prions of the people.
[01:13:29.958 --> 01:13:31.640]  Are the folks running under depopulation?
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.783]  So, we expected this, it's here, and they actually did it.
[01:13:34.783 --> 01:13:37.386]  They think you're so dumb medically, they're going to get away with this.
[01:13:37.386 --> 01:13:43.572]  Kind of like the beta test was hundreds of millions of boys being autistic for vaccines, and big pharma getting away with that.
[01:13:43.572 --> 01:13:46.475]  Well, they said, hell, let's just shit everybody then.
[01:13:46.475 --> 01:13:50.779]  And all the folks that signed on to be vaccinated or injected, they won't want to admit they got conned.
[01:13:50.779 --> 01:13:52.721]  They'll just double down with Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:13:54.093 --> 01:14:06.116]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[01:14:06.116 --> 01:14:13.198]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[01:14:13.198 --> 01:14:15.099]  Their first product they are launching is called
[01:14:15.419 --> 01:14:20.385]  BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[01:14:20.385 --> 01:14:25.210]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.172]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[01:14:27.172 --> 01:14:36.322]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[01:14:36.482 --> 01:14:41.288]  Bioseptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[01:14:41.288 --> 01:14:45.433]  Visit TheBiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[01:14:45.433 --> 01:14:47.456]  That's TheBiopros.com.
[01:14:47.456 --> 01:14:51.621]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[01:14:51.621 --> 01:14:52.983]  TheBiopros.com.
[01:14:54.650 --> 01:14:57.532]  The biosecurity state is here.
[01:14:57.532 --> 01:15:03.457]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:17.229]  The corrupt puppet Prime Minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada sane, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:21.872]  And that in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[01:15:21.872 --> 01:15:25.873]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[01:15:25.873 --> 01:15:27.654]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:15:27.654 --> 01:15:30.335]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[01:15:30.335 --> 01:15:31.356]  They're now implementing it.
[01:15:31.356 --> 01:15:32.576]  And now they've announced that U.S.
[01:15:32.576 --> 01:15:35.458]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:15:35.458 --> 01:15:44.742]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[01:15:45.382 --> 01:15:46.923]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:16:09.892 --> 01:16:12.734]  That's why you're a slave.
[01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:13.635]  That's why they're killing you.
[01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:14.135]  Nope.
[01:16:14.135 --> 01:16:16.397]  But I do know.
[01:16:16.397 --> 01:16:18.578]  You will stand up against Bill Gates today.
[01:16:18.578 --> 01:16:21.160]  What a wonderful day it'd be.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.281]  Well, you better learn.
[01:16:41.923 --> 01:16:47.046]  Well, you better find out.
[01:16:47.046 --> 01:16:50.368]  You better learn about democide and eugenicists.
[01:16:50.368 --> 01:16:53.651]  This ain't all about you.
[01:16:53.651 --> 01:17:03.277]  You do know that one in one is two and that the vaccine doesn't protect you and it makes people show up as quote COVID positive because you're growing prions in your body.
[01:17:04.312 --> 01:17:11.674]  That will then kill you over the next two to five years, according to all the studies, and according to all the top scientists.
[01:17:11.674 --> 01:17:18.135]  And I'm going to play some clips of those scientists here in a moment, and then go to your phone calls at 877-789-2539.
[01:17:18.135 --> 01:17:31.638]  But since I mentioned it, here is Bill Maher, this Friday, talking about how the Olympics belong in Stalin's Russia.
[01:17:31.638 --> 01:17:31.998]  Here it is.
[01:17:33.824 --> 01:17:36.327]  ...in a private conversation.
[01:17:36.327 --> 01:17:38.930]  This is called a purge.
[01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:42.233]  It's a mentality that belongs in Stalin's Russia.
[01:17:42.233 --> 01:17:53.747]  How bad does this atmosphere we are living in have to get before the people who say cancel culture is overblown admit that is in fact an insanity that is swallowing up the world?
[01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:06.251]  I'm back, not the audience.
[01:18:06.251 --> 01:18:07.812]  I'm back.
[01:18:07.812 --> 01:18:08.873]  They're still.
[01:18:08.873 --> 01:18:11.555]  And that is not a conservative position, my friends.
[01:18:11.555 --> 01:18:13.377]  My politics have not changed.
[01:18:13.377 --> 01:18:16.579]  But I am reacting to politics that have.
[01:18:16.579 --> 01:18:23.965]  And this is yet another example of how the woke invert the very thing that used to make liberals, liberals.
[01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:27.688]  Snitches and bitches, that's not being liberal.
[01:18:27.688 --> 01:18:30.771]  The Associated Press is a real news organization, yeah.
[01:18:31.823 --> 01:18:33.463]  So why am I reading this headline?
[01:18:33.463 --> 01:18:39.945]  Olympic surfing exposes whitewashed native Hawaiian roots.
[01:18:39.945 --> 01:18:45.106]  Now, I'm going to go to your phone calls, but since I mentioned this, let me play you a few of these clips.
[01:18:45.106 --> 01:18:52.087]  I played more than 20 scientists and doctors yesterday, prestigious ones.
[01:18:52.087 --> 01:18:58.549]  I played the clip of the inventor of mRNA pointing out their greatest fear,
[01:18:59.639 --> 01:19:05.986]  Would be that it would create antibody-dependent enhancement, and it's done that, and it's causing mass death already.
[01:19:05.986 --> 01:19:10.691]  And then they go on to warn that it'll grow the protein in your body and kill you.
[01:19:10.691 --> 01:19:12.833]  And it just so happens to attack the ovaries.
[01:19:12.833 --> 01:19:14.035]  Oh, gee, isn't that funny?
[01:19:14.035 --> 01:19:15.036]  That's in major studies as well.
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.622]  But oh, trust the science of Bill Gates.
[01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:22.524]  He's your doctor.
[01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:24.526]  Other doctors can't be online.
[01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:40.779]  I've got stacks of articles of prestigious journalists that just reported Pfizer's own studies that they're now doing on the experimental shot, that's the cart before the horse, and saying, oh, we had the same death rate in placebo versus who took the vaccine.
[01:19:40.779 --> 01:19:44.683]  And so they published that, and it got banned off Twitter.
[01:19:46.254 --> 01:19:51.977]  Just like YouTube just banned Sky TV Australia, because they reported the same thing.
[01:19:51.977 --> 01:19:57.180]  Because they're trying to suppress you while they kill you, so you go out and take it, so they can hurt you.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:20:00.242]  It's not just informed consent being violated, it's the opposite.
[01:20:00.242 --> 01:20:02.564]  They're suppressing you finding out what's going on.
[01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:09.968]  The definition of forced consent... Don Lemon, oh you can't have food, oh you can't have water.
[01:20:09.968 --> 01:20:11.769]  In fact, let's play that first.
[01:20:11.769 --> 01:20:13.250]  Don Lemon, this is the talking point everywhere.
[01:20:15.368 --> 01:20:18.722]  Say, you can be able to have food?
[01:20:20.376 --> 01:20:22.578]  You shouldn't be able to have a job.
[01:20:22.578 --> 01:20:24.379]  You should be in a concentration camp, basically.
[01:20:24.379 --> 01:20:25.761]  You should starve to death.
[01:20:25.761 --> 01:20:34.128]  If you don't take this experimental shot, the definition of violating the Nuremberg Code, coerced medical experimentation, here it is.
[01:20:34.128 --> 01:20:40.833]  I don't know, I'm sure a lot of people are not going to agree with this, but don't get the vaccine, you can't go to the supermarket.
[01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:43.516]  Don't have the vaccine, you can't go to the ballgame.
[01:20:43.516 --> 01:20:45.598]  Don't have the vaccine, can't go to work.
[01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:48.209]  You don't have a vaccine?
[01:20:48.209 --> 01:20:48.790]  Can't come here.
[01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:51.272]  No shirt, no shoes, no service.
[01:20:51.272 --> 01:20:52.813]  That's where I think we should be right now.
[01:20:52.813 --> 01:20:53.874]  Okay, thank you Don Lemon.
[01:20:53.874 --> 01:20:58.157]  Anybody that follows him is a Lemonhead in my view.
[01:20:58.157 --> 01:21:12.587]  Let's go ahead and go to Dr. Hotz, Dean of Baylor Science and Medicine, one of the most respected medical schools in the United States, testifying to Congress, I know this happened, about the dangers of these type of vaccines.
[01:21:12.587 --> 01:21:12.888]  Here it is.
[01:21:13.558 --> 01:21:20.840]  One of the things that we're not hearing a lot about is the unique potential safety problem of coronavirus vaccines.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:34.044]  When we started developing coronavirus vaccines and our colleagues, we noticed in laboratory animals that they started to show some of the same immune pathology that resembled what had happened 50 years earlier.
[01:21:34.044 --> 01:21:37.245]  So we said, oh my god, this is going to be problematic.
[01:21:37.245 --> 01:21:43.087]  We don't entirely understand the basis of it, but we recognize that it's a real problem for certain respiratory virus vaccines.
[01:21:44.188 --> 01:21:51.595]  This was first found in the early 1960s with the respiratory syncytial virus vaccines.
[01:21:51.595 --> 01:21:58.061]  Some of those kids who got the vaccine actually did worse and I believe there were two deaths in the consequence of that study.
[01:21:58.061 --> 01:22:07.570]  Because what happens with certain types of respiratory virus vaccines, you get immunized and then when you get actually exposed to the virus you get this kind of paradoxical
[01:22:08.331 --> 01:22:08.511]  Yes.
[01:22:24.581 --> 01:22:36.968]  We started developing coronavirus vaccines and our colleagues, we noticed in laboratory animals that they started to show some of the same pathology that resembled what had happened 50 years earlier.
[01:22:36.968 --> 01:22:40.551]  So we said, oh my god, this is going to be problematic.
[01:22:40.551 --> 01:22:43.973]  By the way, that's one of the top tropical disease experts in the world.
[01:22:44.873 --> 01:22:47.294]  And this is counted as a tropical disease.
[01:22:47.294 --> 01:22:55.196]  He helped run the program, I looked it up, with the University of Texas and Fauci on the rat study 2012 and said, do not do this in humans, it'll kill them.
[01:22:55.196 --> 01:22:57.437]  So there he was in March of last year.
[01:22:57.437 --> 01:23:03.839]  So that's a year and a half ago almost, specifically telling Congress, don't do this, it never worked.
[01:23:03.839 --> 01:23:05.079]  See how that works?
[01:23:05.079 --> 01:23:08.040]  Let's go to Dr. Robert Malone.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.601]  Last week, again, the inventor of mRNA saying the same thing.
[01:23:11.462 --> 01:23:17.026]  This is the great fear that all vaccinologists have.
[01:23:17.026 --> 01:23:20.289]  This is the one thing that scares us all the most.
[01:23:20.289 --> 01:23:27.134]  It cropped up in the 1960s with the development of the pediatric vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus.
[01:23:27.134 --> 01:23:29.876]  Vaccines are known, can cause,
[01:23:33.539 --> 01:23:36.321]  Some vaccines make disease worse.
[01:23:36.321 --> 01:23:47.108]  The classic example of this phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement in which the antibodies actually make it possible for the virus to infect cells that it wouldn't otherwise infect
[01:23:47.868 --> 01:23:50.529]  The classic example is dengue.
[01:23:50.529 --> 01:23:53.711]  When we get dengue the first time, there's four different strains of dengue.
[01:23:53.711 --> 01:23:59.974]  They're enough different that if you get the second strain that's different, it'll cause dengue hemorrhagic fever.
[01:23:59.974 --> 01:24:01.915]  That's what kills you.
[01:24:01.915 --> 01:24:08.218]  This phenomenon was also seen with the dengue vaccine and caused the death of many children.
[01:24:08.218 --> 01:24:11.760]  So let's let this sink in real slow here.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.922]  You just heard two top scientists in the world
[01:24:17.349 --> 01:24:25.174]  I'm telling you that in every case they've had to abandon these programs because it kills the animals and kills the people.
[01:24:25.174 --> 01:24:29.757]  Until Bill Gates resuscitated it a few years ago and launched it on us.
[01:24:29.757 --> 01:24:32.158]  Because he knew it was a great weapon.
[01:24:32.158 --> 01:24:34.920]  Oh, we got this failed program that kills everybody.
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.181]  Oh, Bill Gates got it.
[01:24:36.181 --> 01:24:38.442]  Oh, Bill Gates wants to kill us.
[01:24:38.442 --> 01:24:39.823]  It's out in the open.
[01:24:39.823 --> 01:24:40.744]  It's all open and shut.
[01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:42.971]  Can you believe this?
[01:24:42.971 --> 01:24:46.456]  Are you going to roll your sleeve up like human sacrifice and give this to your kids?
[01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:49.220]  Because now they've announced... I'll tell you when we come back.
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.481]  They're coming after kids now.
[01:24:50.481 --> 01:24:51.463]  Your phone calls are straight ahead.
[01:24:54.758 --> 01:25:00.259]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[01:25:00.259 --> 01:25:17.503]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[01:25:17.503 --> 01:25:18.343]  Worse than slaves.
[01:25:18.343 --> 01:25:21.124]  It's just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:29.833]  Rendered down to be servile minions of a system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:32.935]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world.
[01:25:32.935 --> 01:25:39.858]  We have to realize it's a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[01:25:39.858 --> 01:25:41.098]  It's that choice.
[01:25:41.098 --> 01:25:44.040]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.221]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[01:25:46.221 --> 01:25:47.021]  Freedom or slavery.
[01:25:47.021 --> 01:25:48.502]  Good or evil.
[01:25:48.502 --> 01:25:49.842]  It is a spiritual battle.
[01:25:49.842 --> 01:25:51.483]  An M4 wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:57.924]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something.
[01:25:57.924 --> 01:26:07.812]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[01:26:07.812 --> 01:26:10.554]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[01:26:10.554 --> 01:26:13.896]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[01:26:13.896 --> 01:26:15.117]  You've got red blood.
[01:26:15.117 --> 01:26:22.043]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been
[01:26:22.643 --> 01:26:25.565]  An incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[01:26:25.565 --> 01:26:29.448]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[01:26:29.448 --> 01:26:32.349]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[01:26:32.349 --> 01:26:37.213]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[01:26:37.213 --> 01:26:39.814]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[01:26:39.814 --> 01:26:44.257]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[01:26:44.257 --> 01:26:48.360]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.322]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars.
[01:26:51.322 --> 01:26:51.702]  God bless.
[01:26:53.055 --> 01:26:59.142]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[01:26:59.142 --> 01:27:06.630]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[01:27:06.630 --> 01:27:08.952]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[01:27:08.952 --> 01:27:12.516]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:22.602]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.

[01:27:47.738 --> 01:27:49.539]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:28:22.832 --> 01:28:25.634]  All right, we are back live here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:28.016]  I'm going to go write your calls right now.
[01:28:28.016 --> 01:28:36.543]  We have a very special guest joining us on that Pentagon report that just came out where we know it's Pentagon technology and other private corporate technology.
[01:28:36.543 --> 01:28:39.786]  As he predicted, Dr. Stephen Greer will be joining us coming up.
[01:28:41.112 --> 01:28:43.613]  Then, this report is at InfoWars.com.
[01:28:43.613 --> 01:28:49.155]  It's one of Mark Dice's best reports, because he's getting back to not just doing his sarcasm videos, which are excellent, by the way.
[01:28:49.155 --> 01:28:50.876]  I like those just as much.
[01:28:50.876 --> 01:28:55.698]  But he's getting back to his serious, man-on-the-street interviews, showing how dangerous Californians are.
[01:28:55.698 --> 01:28:56.679]  Shock experiment!
[01:28:56.679 --> 01:29:01.000]  American signed petition to arrest in jail, unvaccinated.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.442]  So, that is coming up next hour.
[01:29:05.442 --> 01:29:07.063]  Briefly, and then I'm going to go right to your calls.

[01:30:20.078 --> 01:30:23.681]  These things are like $50-$60 at Petco.
[01:30:23.681 --> 01:30:26.643]  They just cut up the middlemen.
[01:30:26.643 --> 01:30:31.526]  So instead of going to the Amazon that works against you, go to MyPillow.com promo code Alex and find the operation.

[01:31:03.333 --> 01:31:03.953]  Okay?
[01:31:03.953 --> 01:31:05.414]  And definitely want to promote that symposium.
[01:31:05.414 --> 01:31:08.214]  We're going to be exposing the election fraud like no other place.
[01:31:08.214 --> 01:31:09.715]  The system's really scared of it.
[01:31:09.715 --> 01:31:13.676]  And then separately, today is the last day at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:31:13.676 --> 01:31:14.816]  They said just to send it one more day.
[01:31:14.816 --> 01:31:16.336]  This is it.
[01:31:16.336 --> 01:31:17.997]  It's been ordered to by the producer.
[01:31:20.223 --> 01:31:22.306]  10% off of the highest quality, affordable foods ready to ship right now.
[01:31:22.306 --> 01:31:23.947]  I think you're crazy if you don't do it.
[01:31:23.947 --> 01:31:29.834]  Then, of course, we're going to be selling out very soon of X2, deep-earth crystal iodine in the dripper bottles.

[01:31:38.404 --> 01:31:39.605]  That's 40% off.

[01:31:44.909 --> 01:31:46.270]  Coffee mugs and t-shirts.
[01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:47.831]  Oh, and this week's the last week.
[01:31:47.831 --> 01:31:53.795]  We're 50% off the privacy pockets for your phones so the contact tracers and hackers don't track you.

[01:31:54.816 --> 01:31:56.577]  Okay, I'm done.
[01:31:56.577 --> 01:31:58.478]  Plugging.
[01:31:58.478 --> 01:31:59.899]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:31:59.899 --> 01:32:01.300]  Who is up next here?
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:01.860]  Hmm.
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:03.281]  Loaded phone lines.
[01:32:03.281 --> 01:32:07.424]  We've got Josh in Florida.
[01:32:07.424 --> 01:32:08.644]  First up, the Owl Killer.
[01:32:08.644 --> 01:32:09.185]  Go ahead, Josh.
[01:32:11.021 --> 01:32:12.642]  Hey Alex, Crazy Times.
[01:32:12.642 --> 01:32:18.826]  I want to give you a quick product plug, give you a vaccine story, and then make a quick prediction.
[01:32:18.826 --> 01:32:22.788]  Your vitamin mineral fusion and iodine changed my life.
[01:32:22.788 --> 01:32:26.290]  I hope you guys get your silver products back in soon.
[01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:33.815]  And yeah, for the vaccine story, my mom, my aunt, they're twins.
[01:32:33.815 --> 01:32:40.639]  She, I'm not sure what shot she got, but about four days after she had to go in and get a stent in her heart,
[01:32:41.528 --> 01:32:47.349]  And they just chopped that up to her having, you know, already having heart problems.
[01:32:47.349 --> 01:32:51.770]  Even though it says if you have heart problems, particularly, it can give you a heart attack.
[01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:54.011]  I mean, that is admitted.
[01:32:54.011 --> 01:32:55.891]  Isn't that crazy?
[01:32:55.891 --> 01:32:57.011]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:32:57.011 --> 01:33:05.553]  And what I feel like they're going to do is for 2024, they're going to do the switcheroo to put the nail in the Trump coffin.
[01:33:05.553 --> 01:33:11.074]  So they're going to, they didn't give him credit at first for the vaccine because they wanted to get Biden in.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:17.641]  Now they'll give him credit and say, hey, this vaccine was a big mess.
[01:33:17.641 --> 01:33:20.382]  It's all Trump's fault.
[01:33:20.382 --> 01:33:22.222]  And that's a way for him to lose 2024.
[01:33:22.222 --> 01:33:29.084]  We're also going to see the crypto crash with the regulations and the internet crash.
[01:33:29.084 --> 01:33:33.805]  And you get to all the phone calls and I appreciate you, Alex.
[01:33:33.805 --> 01:33:34.985]  Brother, I appreciate you.
[01:33:34.985 --> 01:33:38.426]  That's a whole other topic I'm going to do someday this week.
[01:33:38.426 --> 01:33:40.026]  It's Trump because people are mad at Trump.
[01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:42.422]  And they want to make it all about Trump.
[01:33:42.422 --> 01:33:43.663]  I know the inside baseball.
[01:33:43.663 --> 01:33:44.684]  I know what Trump thought.
[01:33:44.684 --> 01:33:46.125]  I know he got conned.
[01:33:46.125 --> 01:33:47.126]  I know he did a lot of good.
[01:33:47.126 --> 01:33:48.047]  He did some bad.
[01:33:48.047 --> 01:33:49.588]  I know the globalists hate his guts.
[01:33:49.588 --> 01:33:52.611]  They don't want him to get Republicans elected in the midterms.
[01:33:52.611 --> 01:33:55.193]  So they love anybody that'll attack Trump.
[01:33:55.193 --> 01:33:57.795]  On the right, it's promoted on Twitter and Facebook.
[01:33:57.795 --> 01:34:00.057]  That's why they always attack Trump constantly.
[01:34:00.057 --> 01:34:04.281]  Hey, Trump deserves to be criticized, but still supported to get good Republicans elected.
[01:34:04.941 --> 01:34:06.962]  But, but, oh, you know, Alex Jones isn't good.
[01:34:06.962 --> 01:34:08.942]  He doesn't bash Trump enough.
[01:34:08.942 --> 01:34:11.983]  Notice those guys don't spend much time on Biden, do they?
[01:34:11.983 --> 01:34:14.664]  That's because they're double agents working for the Democrats.
[01:34:14.664 --> 01:34:18.265]  Even if they don't know it, they don't want to get banned off Twitter and Facebook and places.
[01:34:18.265 --> 01:34:20.125]  So it's not a lesser of two evils.
[01:34:20.125 --> 01:34:21.646]  I criticized Trump when he's wrong.
[01:34:21.646 --> 01:34:24.867]  I said he better get, you know, against these vaccines.
[01:34:24.867 --> 01:34:25.947]  You better turn against it.
[01:34:25.947 --> 01:34:27.467]  He hasn't.
[01:34:27.467 --> 01:34:28.588]  And it's a big problem.
[01:34:28.588 --> 01:34:31.588]  And yes, he will get blamed for it when it all comes out.
[01:34:31.588 --> 01:34:32.709]  And so it's a disaster.
[01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:33.369]  It's absolutely horrible.
[01:34:34.690 --> 01:34:45.980]  I'm worried about the midterms right now, because we need to get good, hardcore folks elected, like Marjorie Greene-Taylor, and others, and we can defeat the globalists.
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:50.564]  We need a bunch of people, so it's not just one guy they can target.
[01:34:50.564 --> 01:34:52.086]  All right, thank you for the call.
[01:34:52.086 --> 01:34:53.927]  Owl Killer, from Virginia.
[01:34:53.927 --> 01:34:57.531]  Go ahead, you're a retired military vet on vaccines, and what's coming next?
[01:34:57.531 --> 01:34:59.352]  Tell us.
[01:34:59.352 --> 01:35:00.773]  So, first off, Alex.
[01:35:02.051 --> 01:35:05.553]  Wear the Unvaxxed Lives Matter shirt, because that will be a huge hit.
[01:35:05.553 --> 01:35:11.135]  And I got the entire NYPD that wants the Save the Frogs t-shirt in black and green.
[01:35:11.135 --> 01:35:14.697]  So as soon as you get those in stock, they're going to fly right off the shelf.
[01:35:14.697 --> 01:35:16.738]  So this is where I see things going.
[01:35:16.738 --> 01:35:23.100]  Do you ever get the feeling that we're willingness into existence?
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:30.844]  Because that's the feeling that I get, because every time I see what's going on and I see you predict these things 15 and 20 years ahead of time,
[01:35:31.597 --> 01:35:32.780]  Here's the deal.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:41.117]  The globalists have to have something that we're totally unaware of because man-to-man will kick their heads off their shoulders.
[01:35:43.524 --> 01:35:47.667]  That's the one thing that has me scared is what do they really have up their sleeve?
[01:35:47.667 --> 01:35:56.433]  What they have is evil will to carry out evil and a bunch of sheep that follow orders while they wear these fancy outfits and these costumes and strut around in front of us.
[01:35:56.433 --> 01:35:59.275]  But, you know, we're not willing this into existence.
[01:35:59.275 --> 01:36:01.657]  We've allowed it to come into existence.
[01:36:01.657 --> 01:36:03.658]  We know the globalist plan.
[01:36:03.658 --> 01:36:05.719]  That's how we've been able to predict it so far.
[01:36:05.719 --> 01:36:09.042]  But yes, InfoWars has reached that really magic moment
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:11.881]  I absolutely do, but I don't think they care.
[01:36:31.887 --> 01:36:39.130]  And if you have pay, if you pay attention, the Deagle report with that massive population reduction just went off.
[01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:40.470]  They just took that report off.
[01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:45.112]  Remember it had us down to about a hundred million people by the year 2025, I believe it was.
[01:36:45.112 --> 01:36:47.272]  It was like 160 million.
[01:36:47.272 --> 01:36:47.672]  Okay.
[01:36:47.672 --> 01:36:52.614]  So, so that's, that's, that's just been taken off their website for some reason.
[01:36:52.614 --> 01:36:58.076]  You notice they're scrubbing, like anything that has to do where you see, um, the world economic forum where you see,
[01:36:59.169 --> 01:37:00.711]  John Hopkins or Bill Gates.
[01:37:00.711 --> 01:37:03.433]  They're basically scrubbing everybody that's attached to it.
[01:37:03.433 --> 01:37:08.836]  You'll still see those three on the banner, but you won't see the names anymore.
[01:37:08.836 --> 01:37:11.498]  And it's because everybody's tied into everything.
[01:37:11.498 --> 01:37:13.860]  That's right, and they're not so arrogant now.
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:15.902]  A lot of people realize they've been set up.
[01:37:15.902 --> 01:37:18.423]  That's why you're seeing prestigious scientists come out.
[01:37:18.423 --> 01:37:25.468]  But look, last year, the head of infectious diseases, I mean, the dean of the medical school,
[01:37:26.537 --> 01:37:32.381]  At a prestigious medical school, said, do not take this, it always hurts people.
[01:37:32.381 --> 01:37:33.422]  They knew!
[01:37:33.422 --> 01:37:38.886]  He said, look, the program always failed, until Bill Gates resurrected it, and it kills people.
[01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:40.967]  Well, yeah, he got it because it's a weapon.
[01:37:40.967 --> 01:37:43.429]  Like, you go in a gun shop and buy a gun because it's a weapon.
[01:37:43.429 --> 01:37:47.071]  He didn't buy a spoon, he bought a gun.
[01:37:47.071 --> 01:37:48.692]  And they're firing it at us.
[01:37:48.692 --> 01:37:49.293]  Thank you for the call.
[01:37:51.482 --> 01:37:59.989]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:59.989 --> 01:38:10.577]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time, and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:38:10.577 --> 01:38:13.519]  But then I read the ingredients, and I was blown away.
[01:38:13.519 --> 01:38:14.080]  Listen to this.
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:15.922]  Organic pea fiber.
[01:38:15.922 --> 01:38:17.363]  Organic alfalfa leaf.
[01:38:17.363 --> 01:38:18.825]  Organic wheatgrass leaf.
[01:38:18.825 --> 01:38:20.267]  Organic cilantro leaf.
[01:38:20.267 --> 01:38:21.689]  Organic kale leaf.
[01:38:21.689 --> 01:38:23.230]  Organic flax sprout.
[01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:24.832]  Organic quinoa sprout.
[01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:28.296]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[01:38:28.296 --> 01:38:29.558]  Just one of these ingredients
[01:38:29.818 --> 01:38:32.120]  Can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:36.863]  And we've packed it all in to Fiber Green Caps at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:36.863 --> 01:38:40.786]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[01:38:40.786 --> 01:38:42.968]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[01:38:42.968 --> 01:38:45.790]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[01:38:45.790 --> 01:38:47.331]  That's 33% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:52.588 --> 01:38:59.353]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[01:38:59.353 --> 01:39:02.916]  And that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[01:39:02.916 --> 01:39:06.439]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[01:39:06.439 --> 01:39:10.883]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[01:39:12.025 --> 01:39:12.885]  Well guess what?
[01:39:12.885 --> 01:39:26.872]  It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenicist Globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[01:39:28.072 --> 01:39:33.576]  ...of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[01:39:33.576 --> 01:39:39.941]  The problem for them was, the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[01:39:39.941 --> 01:39:43.264]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine.
[01:39:43.264 --> 01:39:48.387]  Because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[01:39:48.387 --> 01:39:50.309]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:52.828 --> 01:40:00.996]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[01:40:00.996 --> 01:40:09.764]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[01:40:09.764 --> 01:40:11.726]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up.
[01:40:12.086 --> 01:40:16.687]  In a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:40:16.687 --> 01:40:19.327]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[01:40:19.327 --> 01:40:25.349]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones at 50% off $14.95.

[01:40:28.649 --> 01:40:41.412]  We've got a private label with InfoWars on them for $14.95 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these quote smartphones really are.
[01:40:41.872 --> 01:40:49.759]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[01:40:49.759 --> 01:40:52.262]  They're 50% off right now at mfulmorestore.com.
[01:40:53.208 --> 01:40:59.294]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[01:40:59.294 --> 01:41:06.781]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[01:41:06.781 --> 01:41:09.103]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[01:41:09.103 --> 01:41:12.606]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[01:41:14.588 --> 01:41:22.773]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.

[01:41:39.404 --> 01:41:40.685]  Thank you and God bless.
[01:41:41.445 --> 01:41:47.869]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[01:41:47.869 --> 01:41:49.690]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:42:16.894 --> 01:42:20.216]  All right, we got two more segments left ahead of our special guest joining us.
[01:42:20.216 --> 01:42:25.519]  I want to jam in as many calls as we can right now.
[01:42:25.519 --> 01:42:27.920]  So let's just go right to your calls.
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:31.482]  Let's talk to Kim in Las Vegas.
[01:42:31.482 --> 01:42:32.723]  Kim, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:32.723 --> 01:42:34.584]  Go ahead.
[01:42:34.584 --> 01:42:37.145]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:42:37.145 --> 01:42:38.926]  Thank you.
[01:42:38.926 --> 01:42:42.708]  Quick plug real quick for the bioseptic pros.
[01:42:44.215 --> 01:42:54.641]  We actually have a fifth wheel and so I bought it for that and it works great on the gray tank and the black tank.
[01:42:54.641 --> 01:43:01.165]  So those of you that are preparing to bug out when you need to, get it for your rig.
[01:43:01.165 --> 01:43:02.286]  It works fabulous.
[01:43:03.058 --> 01:43:21.849]  I mean, since you called in about that, because we, again, got a guy that owned a patent with an oil company who literally, you know, sells massive amounts of this to finally bring it to the consumer market, so we're really proud of it because it works great and it's innovative, and that is one of the off-label things it can do is for boats and for travel trailers and for RVs.
[01:43:21.849 --> 01:43:27.132]  I mean, we're told that even older systems that have gotten gummed up, that's really good at cleaning them out.
[01:43:27.132 --> 01:43:28.093]  What did it do for your system?
[01:43:29.574 --> 01:43:41.801]  I just, I put a tablespoon down my bathroom sink, my kitchen sink, and then about an eighth of a cup into the black tank.
[01:43:41.801 --> 01:43:45.523]  It's great for eliminating the smell.
[01:43:45.523 --> 01:43:56.649]  It seems that everything, you know, flushes out through the hoses and the tank much more easy, but I really like the fact that it really
[01:43:57.219 --> 01:44:01.583]  Does a great job on controlling the odor.
[01:44:01.583 --> 01:44:05.065]  Well, that's what we've been told by the folks that developed it over 20 years ago.
[01:44:05.065 --> 01:44:06.346]  This is used at hog farms.
[01:44:06.346 --> 01:44:07.968]  It's used in oil spills.
[01:44:07.968 --> 01:44:09.769]  I mean, this stuff will eat paper.
[01:44:09.769 --> 01:44:10.670]  It'll eat leather.
[01:44:10.670 --> 01:44:14.613]  It'll eat some forms of rubber, but nothing inside your RV.
[01:44:14.613 --> 01:44:18.276]  I mean, it is really, really strong and really, really powerful.
[01:44:18.276 --> 01:44:19.657]  So we're glad that you tried it out.
[01:44:19.657 --> 01:44:22.600]  And yeah, in fact, they've just now launched
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:27.961]  It's on label now for not just septic tanks, but for everything else.
[01:44:27.961 --> 01:44:29.642]  It's for your boat.
[01:44:29.642 --> 01:44:31.602]  It's for your RV.
[01:44:31.602 --> 01:44:33.483]  It's for your grease traps.
[01:44:33.483 --> 01:44:34.943]  It's for porta-potties.
[01:44:34.943 --> 01:44:36.984]  Oh, and it's bio-drain.
[01:44:36.984 --> 01:44:39.744]  Bio-drain is here now as well.
[01:44:39.744 --> 01:44:45.486]  And it's got the little bitty scooper and the directions for each of your drains to absolutely eat that sucker out and get it clean.
[01:44:45.486 --> 01:44:46.686]  So I'm glad you liked it.
[01:44:46.686 --> 01:44:49.827]  It's a great new sponsor that we really pushed to partner with to bring online.
[01:44:50.607 --> 01:44:54.988]  Now, getting to your point about on-vaccine injuries and effects.
[01:44:54.988 --> 01:44:58.729]  So, I have so many vaccine stories.
[01:44:58.729 --> 01:45:02.290]  My husband's ex-mother-in-law took the shot.
[01:45:02.290 --> 01:45:09.853]  She had so many strokes until she was brain dead and the family had to take her off life support.
[01:45:09.853 --> 01:45:12.253]  His ex-brother-in-law took the shot.
[01:45:12.253 --> 01:45:17.795]  A week later, he was in the hospital with COVID and I told him, I said, make sure
[01:45:18.277 --> 01:45:20.319]  They do not put him on a ventilator.
[01:45:20.319 --> 01:45:27.004]  They put him on a ventilator and, you know, like I told my husband, I said he won't come off that ventilator.
[01:45:27.004 --> 01:45:30.647]  His funeral was a few weeks ago.
[01:45:30.647 --> 01:45:38.033]  My father-in-law took the shot within three weeks, had to have a quadruple bypass.
[01:45:38.033 --> 01:45:42.817]  Since then, he's been in the hospital twice to have clots dissolved.
[01:45:44.403 --> 01:45:56.226]  You know, my stepson is a Marine and overseas and they forced him to take the shot or they were going to end his deployment.
[01:45:56.226 --> 01:46:03.348]  I mean, it just, it's unreal how many people I know that are affected.
[01:46:03.348 --> 01:46:10.730]  And I want to have empathy and sympathy and be compassionate to them, but I've told
[01:46:11.468 --> 01:46:16.712]  So many people and shared your videos and they're not listening.
[01:46:16.712 --> 01:46:23.658]  And it's like, and they're going ahead and taking the mark of the beast and doing these things to themselves.
[01:46:23.658 --> 01:46:35.268]  And my heart is just, I'm so heartbroken knowing that I gave the people the information and they just, they refuse to see it.
[01:46:35.268 --> 01:46:40.372]  And it's like, you know, like the video you showed with the two guys fighting until he quit.
[01:46:41.019 --> 01:46:44.370]  On the glasses, that's what I feel like right now.
[01:46:44.370 --> 01:46:48.161]  And I just, my heart is broken.
[01:46:49.930 --> 01:46:50.670]  Mine is too.
[01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:53.671]  My heart is broken, sweetheart, and we just have to give it to God.
[01:46:53.671 --> 01:46:55.691]  I'm so sorry what happened to your family.
[01:46:55.691 --> 01:46:58.412]  I've got family that's pretty close.
[01:46:58.412 --> 01:47:03.733]  I wouldn't say distant, but cousins and people that have taken the shots and gotten sick and still defend it.
[01:47:03.733 --> 01:47:07.514]  And I have friends and people that didn't listen to me and got sick.
[01:47:07.514 --> 01:47:13.115]  And then they think we're making this up because they can't believe the government is evil, but it is at the top.
[01:47:13.115 --> 01:47:18.156]  And I'm so sorry, but we just have to give it to God, keep warning people, and keep doing what you're doing, Kim.
[01:47:18.156 --> 01:47:18.796]  Thank you so much.
[01:47:20.208 --> 01:47:23.996]  Supporting us and keeping us on air is reaching millions and millions of people.
[01:47:23.996 --> 01:47:27.163]  And so just know that we have love and our spirits last forever.
[01:47:27.163 --> 01:47:29.128]  We're with God and that's what matters.
[01:47:29.128 --> 01:47:30.831]  And I say that because I'm in a lot of pain too.
[01:47:32.725 --> 01:47:51.758]  I mean, as a man, we're being assaulted, and my body is like, you need to go after these people, but I understand they've got it set up to where they're martyrs then, and we make them victims, and then, no, no, we need to be like Gandhi, who learned from Jesus, and Martin Luther King, that learned from Jesus, is that killing these people at this point is not the thing to do.
[01:47:51.758 --> 01:47:54.820]  We need to have them arrested, and tried, and then executed.
[01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:57.502]  We don't need to be like them, just killing people out there.
[01:47:57.502 --> 01:48:00.805]  We need to expose what they're doing, and let them know they're gonna be brought down for what they've done.
[01:48:01.759 --> 01:48:09.805]  But physically as a man, I just have real problems sitting here and taking this.
[01:48:09.805 --> 01:48:11.547]  But just thank God we've got this platform.
[01:48:11.547 --> 01:48:12.668]  We are hurting them so bad.
[01:48:13.666 --> 01:48:20.251]  And they've got the Feds trying to set me up right now, and they've got people trying to kill us, and you know, I'm not going to get into it all, but it's okay.
[01:48:20.251 --> 01:48:21.232]  I chose to be in this position.
[01:48:21.232 --> 01:48:22.413]  I'm very blessed to be here.
[01:48:22.413 --> 01:48:25.035]  But every day we're on air is a blessing, folks.
[01:48:25.035 --> 01:48:26.136]  You've got to download these shows.
[01:48:26.136 --> 01:48:26.756]  You've got to save them.
[01:48:26.756 --> 01:48:28.437]  You've got to start your own shows.
[01:48:28.437 --> 01:48:29.598]  I don't care what you do.
[01:48:29.598 --> 01:48:30.719]  Go talk at city council.
[01:48:30.719 --> 01:48:32.721]  Just get engaged now.
[01:48:32.721 --> 01:48:36.924]  Because your word of mouth will override the enemy, and the people can trump this evil.
[01:48:37.952 --> 01:48:39.733]  All right, let's go to another caller here.
[01:48:39.733 --> 01:48:42.115]  There's so many great callers here.
[01:48:42.115 --> 01:48:44.996]  Let's go ahead and just go on the calls they received.
[01:48:44.996 --> 01:48:46.677]  Let's go to Noel in Chicago.
[01:48:46.677 --> 01:48:49.639]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:48:49.639 --> 01:48:55.863]  Well, Alejandro, it's been several years since I last spoken to you, my friend, so it's good chatting with you again.
[01:48:55.863 --> 01:49:01.126]  We'll continue to have you in my prayers as we are entering some amazing times.
[01:49:03.271 --> 01:49:06.214]  I was an investigative journalist covering weather modification.
[01:49:06.214 --> 01:49:12.159]  I'd call your show for many years telling the public about the Air Force document, weather as a force multiplier.
[01:49:12.159 --> 01:49:13.260]  I remember you calling.
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:14.822]  I remember you calling, yes.
[01:49:14.822 --> 01:49:18.185]  I think you've even been a guest on the show.
[01:49:18.185 --> 01:49:20.207]  I have.
[01:49:20.207 --> 01:49:28.394]  I've used my real name as a guest on your show, but I transitioned from an investigative journalist to the play-by-play world, doing announcing for basketball, football, etc, etc.
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:49.380]  So I was working my way up the totem pole in play by play where this summer, the top professional basketball league in the world, which just so happens to be here in the United States, I was going to work for them doing the contract in Chicago when in a meeting and in documents, they told me I had to take the vaccine.
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:50.762]  Everyone who had to work this event
[01:49:51.323 --> 01:49:53.565]  Was forced to take the vaccine.
[01:49:53.565 --> 01:49:55.968]  Now, of course, I declined.
[01:49:55.968 --> 01:49:56.948]  I didn't do it.
[01:49:56.948 --> 01:50:04.896]  No way in hell sort of made the choice for me where I need to go back to the investigative journalism realm because there's no way in hell I'm going to take this vaccine.
[01:50:04.896 --> 01:50:07.859]  My wife's family, Alex, they're all nurses.
[01:50:07.859 --> 01:50:10.481]  Several in her family are all nurses.
[01:50:10.481 --> 01:50:12.783]  One of them is going to be a doctor, actually.
[01:50:12.783 --> 01:50:14.605]  All took the vaccine.
[01:50:14.605 --> 01:50:16.427]  One of them is pregnant.
[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:24.025]  And a couple of weeks ago, they came to discover that their soon-to-be daughter had developed a brain tumor.
[01:50:24.025 --> 01:50:37.056]  Another one of her family members, shriveling, old, you can tell through their skin, weeks after they took the vaccine, they're not looking good, they're getting heart palpitations, rushed to the hospital.
[01:50:37.056 --> 01:50:44.942]  I know so many people, Alex, who are getting the vaccine, elderly people who are dazed, confused, sort of reaching that Alzheimer's level.
[01:50:47.102 --> 01:50:50.243]  My grandmother took the vaccine in Florida.
[01:50:50.243 --> 01:50:55.405]  I'm just waiting for the phone call to where she starts to get in trouble.
[01:50:55.405 --> 01:51:06.268]  I'm noticing more and more, Alex, in the suburban parts of Chicago, Barrington, a very affluent suburb, where more and more parents are standing up, going to school board meetings.
[01:51:06.843 --> 01:51:09.924]  Telling these tyrants, you're not putting the vaccine in my child.
[01:51:09.924 --> 01:51:12.065]  I'm noticing it all across the country.
[01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:17.868]  I'm noticing it in California, where they're awakening that golden bear, that beautiful flag of California.
[01:51:17.868 --> 01:51:22.690]  These tyrants are awaking average-day people to what's going on.
[01:51:22.690 --> 01:51:23.811]  I know you're rushed for time.
[01:51:23.811 --> 01:51:32.014]  On the supply chain, I spoke to someone in the Midwest who told me, come September, we'll see a 10 to 15 percent increase
[01:51:33.965 --> 01:51:37.330]  Across the board, on all grocery items.
[01:51:37.330 --> 01:51:44.380]  Anything you can think of at the grocery store, 10-15% increase in the coming months, Alex.
[01:51:49.387 --> 01:51:50.447]  I know you are.
[01:51:50.447 --> 01:51:54.629]  If you'd like to come on and or be a reporter for us, we'll get your name and number again.
[01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:56.349]  I know you've been a guest many times years ago.
[01:51:56.349 --> 01:52:02.731]  Remember you saying you were going to get out of that back into sports and then you're back into this by the sheer market to be situation.
[01:52:02.731 --> 01:52:04.152]  So I'd love to reconnect with you.
[01:52:04.152 --> 01:52:05.432]  We'll get your number, get your info.
[01:52:05.432 --> 01:52:06.393]  God bless you.
[01:52:06.393 --> 01:52:06.573]  Wow.
[01:52:06.573 --> 01:52:07.613]  That's a blast from the past.
[01:52:07.613 --> 01:52:08.373]  Really smart guys.
[01:52:08.373 --> 01:52:10.154]  There's a lot of documents I didn't know about.
[01:52:10.874 --> 01:52:14.695]  We're gonna come back, take more calls, and the gas is popping in, and then I'll come back to you.
[01:52:14.695 --> 01:52:20.157]  One way or another, we're getting every caller here, we're taking your calls in the order they are received.
[01:52:20.157 --> 01:52:21.278]  But how hardcore is that?
[01:52:21.278 --> 01:52:28.080]  And it's not just what he saw with family having health problems, or it's not what the last caller saw with the blood clots, it's in the literature!
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.021]  It's not like they didn't know.
[01:52:30.021 --> 01:52:34.543]  Remember, every vaccine project with a spike protein failed, until Bill Gates took it over.
[01:52:34.543 --> 01:52:36.823]  That was Congressional hearings.
[01:52:36.823 --> 01:52:38.104]  He knew exactly what he was doing.
[01:52:44.597 --> 01:52:45.859]  Jacob in Ohio.
[01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:46.240]  Welcome.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:46.680]  Go ahead.
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:48.583]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:52:48.583 --> 01:52:49.645]  Great last caller.
[01:52:49.645 --> 01:52:52.709]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:58.438]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[01:52:58.438 --> 01:52:59.980]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[01:53:00.501 --> 01:53:02.202]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[01:53:02.202 --> 01:53:03.122]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[01:53:03.122 --> 01:53:03.522]  Go ahead.
[01:53:03.522 --> 01:53:03.923]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:03.923 --> 01:53:05.043]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:53:05.043 --> 01:53:08.084]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[01:53:08.084 --> 01:53:09.765]  The X Team does wonders.
[01:53:09.765 --> 01:53:10.886]  I recommend it to everybody.
[01:53:10.886 --> 01:53:12.066]  You're on the fence about it.
[01:53:12.066 --> 01:53:12.867]  Get off the fence.
[01:53:12.867 --> 01:53:13.747]  Get the product.
[01:53:13.747 --> 01:53:14.948]  Support the InfoWars.
[01:53:14.948 --> 01:53:16.248]  Tyler in Maine.
[01:53:16.248 --> 01:53:16.888]  You're on the air.
[01:53:16.888 --> 01:53:17.449]  Thanks for holding.
[01:53:17.449 --> 01:53:17.829]  Go ahead.
[01:53:17.829 --> 01:53:18.449]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:18.449 --> 01:53:19.590]  It's great to be on with you.
[01:53:19.590 --> 01:53:20.090]  It's an honor.
[01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:21.091]  Honor, talk to you.
[01:53:21.091 --> 01:53:22.232]  Awesome.
[01:53:22.232 --> 01:53:25.854]  So, first thing I wanted to do is to say I love the products.
[01:53:25.854 --> 01:53:27.656]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[01:53:27.656 --> 01:53:30.398]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[01:53:30.398 --> 01:53:31.759]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[01:53:31.759 --> 01:53:33.460]  So, just number one for a pure day.
[01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:34.421]  Oh, it definitely works.
[01:53:34.421 --> 01:53:36.042]  It's not a joke.
[01:53:36.042 --> 01:53:36.763]  Absolutely.
[01:53:43.171 --> 01:53:46.053]  The biosecurity state is here.
[01:53:46.053 --> 01:53:51.958]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[01:53:51.958 --> 01:54:05.749]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[01:54:07.190 --> 01:54:10.391]  And in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[01:54:10.391 --> 01:54:14.392]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[01:54:14.392 --> 01:54:16.152]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:54:16.152 --> 01:54:18.853]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[01:54:18.853 --> 01:54:21.094]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[01:54:21.094 --> 01:54:23.654]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:54:23.654 --> 01:54:33.257]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[01:54:33.937 --> 01:54:35.358]  And bull wars will continue to set fast.
[01:54:35.358 --> 01:54:35.898]  We fight this.
[01:54:35.898 --> 01:54:37.358]  I don't know how long we can.
[01:54:37.358 --> 01:54:38.739]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[01:54:38.739 --> 01:54:40.359]  God bless and good luck.
[01:54:40.359 --> 01:54:45.261]  I would begin to get right with God right now.
[01:54:45.261 --> 01:54:47.862]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:10.422]  Alright folks, we're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:55:10.422 --> 01:55:14.606]  I have a very special guest joining us and I'm just going to the order they received.
[01:55:14.606 --> 01:55:19.610]  Let's talk to Scared in South Dakota and we'll talk to Travis in Maine.
[01:55:19.610 --> 01:55:22.873]  Scared, go ahead.
[01:55:22.873 --> 01:55:24.214]  Hi Alex, can you hear me?
[01:55:24.214 --> 01:55:24.955]  I can, go ahead.
[01:55:24.955 --> 01:55:25.555]  Thank you for calling.
[01:55:25.555 --> 01:55:27.837]  You say you're a healthcare worker.
[01:55:27.837 --> 01:55:31.080]  I'm a healthcare worker in Sioux Falls, South Dakota for Stanford Health.
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:34.243]  They're probably one of the largest employers of the Dakotas.
[01:55:34.924 --> 01:55:36.805]  And they just mandated the vaccine.
[01:55:36.805 --> 01:55:42.329]  If you don't get it by November 1st, you're put on a 60-day suspension.
[01:55:42.329 --> 01:55:47.172]  Then, if you don't get it during the 60 days, it's considered your voluntary resignation.
[01:55:47.172 --> 01:55:54.717]  So, and Governor Noem's response was, you have the power to say no to mandates.
[01:55:54.717 --> 01:56:01.621]  South Dakota has a robust economy, and this gives you the opportunity to find another job that values personal choice.
[01:56:02.014 --> 01:56:03.074]  She is of no help.
[01:56:03.074 --> 01:56:04.335]  She's been fought.
[01:56:04.335 --> 01:56:08.976]  I'm sick and tired of her getting credit for being this freedom-loving governor, because she's not.
[01:56:08.976 --> 01:56:12.637]  Well, this definitely violates the Nuremberg Code, whether it's an employee or anybody.
[01:56:12.637 --> 01:56:15.097]  An employer making you take something.
[01:56:15.097 --> 01:56:16.658]  And lawsuits need to be filed.
[01:56:16.658 --> 01:56:18.018]  Unions need to be formed.
[01:56:18.018 --> 01:56:19.578]  But they usually create an out.
[01:56:19.578 --> 01:56:21.579]  Is there not a religious or medical exemption?
[01:56:21.579 --> 01:56:26.400]  Couldn't you get a doctor to say you have autoimmune response, or you don't need a vaccine, or you've already got the antibodies?
[01:56:27.768 --> 01:56:33.291]  Well, they don't care about the antibodies and medical exemptions are next to impossible.
[01:56:33.291 --> 01:56:38.594]  Which I was about to say, as you know, as a medical person, if you already have antibodies for something, you better not take a vaccine for it.
[01:56:38.594 --> 01:56:41.195]  That can really make you sick.
[01:56:41.195 --> 01:56:41.896]  They don't care.
[01:56:41.896 --> 01:56:43.276]  This is across the board.
[01:56:43.276 --> 01:56:45.217]  They don't care if you've had COVID.
[01:56:45.217 --> 01:56:48.159]  It's mandated for everyone across the board.
[01:56:48.159 --> 01:56:52.902]  And you can file a religious exemption, but they can and do deny those.
[01:56:52.902 --> 01:56:55.183]  And you have to submit one every single year.
[01:56:56.829 --> 01:57:07.074]  I understand, and it's good for nurses to fight, it's good for medical workers to fight, but you can also, they always leave outs in these things, just believe me, those administrators aren't taking it.
[01:57:07.074 --> 01:57:08.834]  No, absolutely they're not.
[01:57:08.834 --> 01:57:09.795]  Oh, I know.
[01:57:09.795 --> 01:57:14.817]  You know, it just makes me sick to work for an organization that will do this to their people though.
[01:57:15.339 --> 01:57:16.659]  Well, I would work against them.
[01:57:16.659 --> 01:57:25.162]  I would stay there and then quietly inform the patients and give them extra attention and watch over them because an institution that will do that is planning some other evil stuff.
[01:57:25.162 --> 01:57:29.023]  So stay in the hospital to make sure they don't intubate people that don't need it.
[01:57:29.023 --> 01:57:31.203]  And then just push it as far as you have to.
[01:57:31.203 --> 01:57:34.284]  You see, I'm of the mind of don't let them run you out of the police department.
[01:57:34.284 --> 01:57:36.045]  Be there to watch what they're doing.
[01:57:36.045 --> 01:57:37.385]  Don't let them run you out of government.
[01:57:37.385 --> 01:57:38.785]  Be there as long as you can.
[01:57:38.785 --> 01:57:40.346]  Does that make sense?
[01:57:40.346 --> 01:57:41.106]  Yeah, it does.
[01:57:41.106 --> 01:57:41.886]  Yes.
[01:57:41.886 --> 01:57:42.966]  And that's my plan.
[01:57:42.966 --> 01:57:44.887]  I'm going to just starve it out as long as I can.
[01:57:45.643 --> 01:57:50.547]  Well, you're awesome, and you know, we had to go through this sometime, and I think this is going to backfire on them.
[01:57:50.547 --> 01:57:52.889]  You know, they're seeing way more opposition than they thought they would see.
[01:57:52.889 --> 01:57:57.733]  I know it's rough for you, Scared, but at the end of the day, it's all part of God's plan.
[01:57:57.733 --> 01:57:59.755]  Anything else?
[01:57:59.755 --> 01:58:01.836]  The local news called us.
[01:58:01.836 --> 01:58:05.059]  We did a protest on Friday, and the local news called us sociopaths.
[01:58:06.886 --> 01:58:07.246]  That's right.
[01:58:07.246 --> 01:58:08.347]  You're a medical worker.
[01:58:08.347 --> 01:58:09.348]  You have experience.
[01:58:09.348 --> 01:58:10.529]  You know the truth.
[01:58:10.529 --> 01:58:13.131]  It's experimental, but you're a sociopath.
[01:58:13.131 --> 01:58:18.056]  You don't care about people because you won't take an experimental shot that violates the Nuremberg Code.
[01:58:18.056 --> 01:58:20.318]  Right.
[01:58:20.318 --> 01:58:25.562]  What's the percentage of nurses and healthcare workers that are upset right now?
[01:58:25.562 --> 01:58:30.947]  I think that Sanford Health is predicting that they will lose at least 20% of their workforce.
[01:58:33.112 --> 01:58:39.461]  I mean, you know, the White House isn't going to make people take the shot, so why should you have to?
[01:58:39.461 --> 01:58:39.902]  Exactly.
[01:58:39.902 --> 01:58:40.763]  I know.
[01:58:40.763 --> 01:58:48.535]  So people think South Dakota is free and it's really a bad state for medical tyranny and the governor doesn't care.
[01:58:49.582 --> 01:58:52.664]  Well, I know the grass is always greener on the other side, and I hear you.
[01:58:52.664 --> 01:58:57.006]  Your governor kept trans stuff in sports, where men can compete against women.
[01:58:57.006 --> 01:58:58.467]  I know.
[01:58:58.467 --> 01:59:00.308]  I want to think of her as a great lady.
[01:59:00.308 --> 01:59:05.712]  She's certainly well-spoken and a lovely person and does a lot of good things, but she does a lot of bad things as well.
[01:59:05.712 --> 01:59:06.612]  Thank you for the call.
[01:59:06.612 --> 01:59:10.114]  All right, we have our special guest joining us, but then I'm going to host someone in the next hour.
[01:59:10.114 --> 01:59:13.817]  If you can hold, because we've got all these great callers that have been calling in the last 30 minutes.
[01:59:16.198 --> 01:59:29.500]  Derek and Mel and Debra and Walker and Jay and Carlos and Travis and James and JP and Oshawa and so many, but we've got our special guest joining us that's got a host of big topics.
[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:39.422]  He's going to be covering Dr. Stephen Greer, new film The Cosmic Hoax, DNI report, that's huge, he predicted that would come out and be a nothing burger, and fake national security threat.
[01:59:39.422 --> 01:59:45.263]  It's all coming up with Dr. Stephen Greer, the big whistleblower on the other side, and he's got his new
[01:59:45.723 --> 01:59:47.484]  Hit film out as well.
[01:59:47.484 --> 01:59:48.144]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:48.144 --> 01:59:52.725]  Tell folks to tune in.
[01:59:52.725 --> 01:59:58.827]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[01:59:58.827 --> 02:00:06.309]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[02:00:06.309 --> 02:00:08.609]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[02:00:08.609 --> 02:00:12.110]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th.

[02:00:38.907 --> 02:00:40.108]  Thank you and God bless.

[02:00:57.394 --> 02:01:03.056]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:01:03.056 --> 02:01:06.918]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:01:06.918 --> 02:01:09.039]  This magic moment
[02:01:11.389 --> 02:01:30.365]  So different and so new, wasn't like any other Until I kissed you, and then it happened It took me by surprise, I knew that you felt it too
[02:01:37.421 --> 02:01:38.642]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:38.642 --> 02:01:43.186]  We're going to play the trailer for the film coming up next segment here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:43.186 --> 02:01:53.195]  Dr. Stephen Greer is one of the world's foremost authorities on the subject of UFOs, extraterrestrial intelligence and technologies, and initiating peaceful contact with interstellar civilizations.
[02:01:53.195 --> 02:02:00.362]  For over 30 years, Dr. Greer has provided briefings for senior government officials across the globe, conducting numerous media interviews and has delivered
[02:02:00.942 --> 02:02:03.103]  Thousands of interviews and lectures.
[02:02:03.103 --> 02:02:09.486]  He has also written five books, produced a feature film, documentaries that have been seen hundreds of millions of times.
[02:02:09.486 --> 02:02:18.409]  Dr. Greer's relentless efforts towards a disclosure of classified UFO ET information has inspired I would say billions, not millions, of supporters around the world.
[02:02:18.409 --> 02:02:19.130]  His films are
[02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:22.794]  Unacknowledged and close encounters of the fifth kind.
[02:02:22.794 --> 02:02:27.279]  Contact has begun with the most recent film being The Cosmic Hoax, an expose.
[02:02:27.279 --> 02:02:38.092]  Dr. Steven Greer again is at dr.stevengreer on Instagram and www.seriousdisclosure.com with an S. Thanks for joining us.
[02:02:38.092 --> 02:02:39.634]  Obviously you said you would come back on.
[02:02:41.155 --> 02:02:48.397]  Once they'd released this report, you predicted it would just be a bunch of earth technology, human technology, corporate technology.
[02:02:48.397 --> 02:02:53.299]  And so let's start there and then get into the new film, Cosmic Oaks, and expand out.
[02:02:53.299 --> 02:02:55.779]  But first off, thanks for coming on.
[02:02:55.779 --> 02:02:56.459]  Thank you.
[02:02:56.459 --> 02:02:57.820]  I'm really glad to be with you again.
[02:02:58.527 --> 02:03:13.252]  Before we get into the film and all the big DNI report and all of it, first, I know you like to stay on subject, but this whole global government, Bill Gates, the inoculation, the fact that they admit that people that have been injected are the ones that are mainly getting sick.
[02:03:13.252 --> 02:03:18.114]  From your sources and your connections, what is going on here?
[02:03:18.114 --> 02:03:23.836]  Well, the main thing is that the abuse of power that's been associated with this pandemic
[02:03:24.631 --> 02:03:36.937]  Aside from the fact that it almost certainly was a biowarfare weapon created in the Wuhan lab, is the way they're beta testing to see how well they can control the populace.
[02:03:36.937 --> 02:03:53.685]  Because what they really have done is to issue all kinds of confusing edicts from central state actors and then see if the populace will genuflect and bow down and kowtow to these authorities.
[02:03:54.335 --> 02:04:04.022]  And I think that anyone who cares about freedom has to look at these excesses of abuse of power that have been happening.
[02:04:04.022 --> 02:04:07.464]  And that's something that I think was by design.
[02:04:07.464 --> 02:04:14.569]  I think this was done to see, let's see if we can beta test through fear, a constant drumbeat of fear.
[02:04:14.569 --> 02:04:19.213]  I'm an emergency doctor and I can see how fear can affect people in so many ways.
[02:04:19.933 --> 02:04:21.135]  Thank you for having me.
[02:04:36.235 --> 02:04:52.486]  Not being in school, having to wear masks when they have very low risk of either spreading it or getting the virus, and yet people are complying and they're measuring, in my opinion, they're seeing how effective that is.
[02:04:52.486 --> 02:04:53.787]  How much can they get away with?
[02:04:55.444 --> 02:04:57.445]  I think you're absolutely right.
[02:04:57.445 --> 02:05:00.207]  Klaus Schwab has said, get ready for global power outages.
[02:05:00.207 --> 02:05:06.350]  That'll make the COVID look like a tea party or look like a walk in the park.
[02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:11.153]  They even admit they're doing this for, quote, great reset.
[02:05:11.153 --> 02:05:13.914]  What do you think of Klaus Schwab and this whole great reset?
[02:05:13.914 --> 02:05:16.515]  What are the planetary controllers trying to do?
[02:05:16.515 --> 02:05:19.157]  Because they're acting like somebody's got a gun to their head.
[02:05:20.543 --> 02:05:27.086]  Well, you know, this is a long-term defense plan that was concocted at the end of World War II over 70 years ago.
[02:05:27.086 --> 02:05:33.029]  And we have people on my team who have seen this long-term strategic defense plan.
[02:05:33.029 --> 02:05:42.734]  Even General Wesley Clark admitted to seeing a document where all these endless wars in the Mideast were mapped out way in advance.
[02:05:42.734 --> 02:05:45.355]  Wernher von Braun, who invented the rocket, freed off Hitler.
[02:05:45.495 --> 02:05:46.735]  Thank you for having me.
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:07.480]  We're good to go.
[02:06:35.501 --> 02:06:39.066]  But then it all came true the way the Hollywood, the media, the rollout.
[02:06:39.066 --> 02:06:41.529]  Obviously, these machines they're showing are human.
[02:06:41.529 --> 02:06:43.311]  I have no folks that have worked on them.
[02:06:43.311 --> 02:06:47.896]  I mean, it's not even that classified anymore, as you said decades ago.
[02:06:47.896 --> 02:06:51.661]  So why do they want us to believe there's this outside violent alien threat?
[02:06:51.661 --> 02:06:53.683]  You're saying that's going to be the ultimate false flag?
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:58.164]  It's the ultimate false flag and they actually started it.
[02:06:58.164 --> 02:07:08.958]  If you look at the Cosmic Coast, you'll see that we refer to a CIA document from 1985 where the CIA was going down to Brazil and Argentina admits this openly.
[02:07:10.125 --> 02:07:16.569]  And we're engaging in fake alien abductions for their quote psychological warfare value.
[02:07:16.569 --> 02:07:19.631]  Now, this is not a contested document.
[02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:28.016]  Moreover, we have an Air Force intelligence officer who's come forward who has stated point blank that they have engaged in abducting U.S.
[02:07:28.016 --> 02:07:34.019]  citizens made to look like alien encounters for their psychological warfare value.
[02:07:34.019 --> 02:07:36.981]  I mean, this is a case closed here, but the general public
[02:07:37.802 --> 02:07:43.948]  Mostly don't know this and I this is why we did this emergency documentary and I released it for free.
[02:07:43.948 --> 02:07:45.109]  I think it's on your side.
[02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:51.255]  We're putting out all over the world is because the people we can need to be cosmic Paul Revere's here and say wait.
[02:07:51.255 --> 02:07:57.001]  There's this whole hoax and fake alien threat thing coming and people are being sucked into it.
[02:07:57.001 --> 02:07:58.603]  Just like they've been sucked into the fear.
[02:07:58.643 --> 02:07:59.224]  We're good to go.
[02:08:19.241 --> 02:08:30.751]  Well I should have said up front that your new amazing film, super high production quality, obviously millions of dollars to make, The Cosmic Hoax and Exposé, I wish I could make a film this good, is free!
[02:08:30.751 --> 02:08:44.322]  And I should have pointed that out, it is at band.video, The Cosmic Hoax and Exposé, it's many other places, and I should have had you back on when you launched it a few weeks ago, but here it is, everybody should share it today, The Cosmic Hoax and Exposé.
[02:08:44.322 --> 02:08:45.303]  Tell us about the film.
[02:08:47.119 --> 02:09:06.291]  Well, the genesis of the film was when I got a heads up that the Director of National Intelligence and their minions, people like Lou Elizondo and Chris Mellon and Nick Pope and others, were consistently saying three provable, damnable lies.
[02:09:06.291 --> 02:09:07.732]  Let me go through these very quickly.
[02:09:07.732 --> 02:09:14.397]  The documentary is more extensive, but number one, they say that we don't know what these objects are.
[02:09:14.397 --> 02:09:14.717]  We do.
[02:09:15.624 --> 02:09:19.371]  Some of them, a very few of them, are actually extraterrestrial vehicles.
[02:09:20.473 --> 02:09:26.217]  Most of the ones that are being shown in the media, if you look at all those, those are all ours.
[02:09:26.217 --> 02:09:27.918]  Those are from Lockheed Skunk Works.
[02:09:27.918 --> 02:09:30.920]  They're from my uncle's company, Northrop Grumman.
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:37.404]  They're contractors that are making so-called anti-gravity free energy devices.
[02:09:37.404 --> 02:09:42.887]  And that's a bigger secret than the ET issue, for a reason I'll get into in a moment.
[02:09:42.887 --> 02:09:46.870]  And then the second big lie is we don't have anything
[02:09:47.590 --> 02:09:50.453]  That can move this way, and they show these images.
[02:09:50.453 --> 02:09:54.858]  This one you're showing right now obviously has nav lights on it.
[02:09:54.858 --> 02:10:02.526]  It's a triangle anti-grav silent made by Northrop Grumman, and we have known this for decades.
[02:10:02.526 --> 02:10:04.729]  I'll give your viewers a date.
[02:10:05.433 --> 02:10:08.235]  October 1954.
[02:10:08.235 --> 02:10:15.098]  That is when we mastered gravity control and began making man-made things that look like UFOs.
[02:10:15.098 --> 02:10:21.622]  This particular video you're showing now is a Lockheed Martin from the Skunk Works up in the high desert of California.
[02:10:21.622 --> 02:10:23.923]  So are there actually E.T.
[02:10:23.923 --> 02:10:24.523]  craft?
[02:10:24.523 --> 02:10:25.104]  Yes.
[02:10:25.104 --> 02:10:27.025]  Much more rarely seen.
[02:10:27.025 --> 02:10:32.848]  They're using these man-made ones to try to create this other third lie.
[02:10:33.308 --> 02:10:37.110]  We'll be right back with our special guest, ladies and gentlemen, and the film that's free right now at Band.Video.
[02:10:37.110 --> 02:10:37.670]  Stay with us.
[02:10:53.991 --> 02:10:56.053]  Your voice counts.
[02:10:56.053 --> 02:11:01.119]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:11:01.119 --> 02:11:03.722]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:05.203]  They know you're angry.
[02:11:05.203 --> 02:11:10.008]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[02:11:10.589 --> 02:11:21.333]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports, and share them with everyone you know.

[02:11:45.142 --> 02:11:46.063]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[02:11:51.778 --> 02:11:54.241]  The world is awakening.
[02:11:54.241 --> 02:11:57.744]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[02:11:57.744 --> 02:12:09.056]  They are discovering the globalists, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[02:12:09.056 --> 02:12:11.658]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning,
[02:12:12.844 --> 02:12:18.807]  The truth is, they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[02:12:18.807 --> 02:12:21.949]  We have forced them out in the open.
[02:12:21.949 --> 02:12:27.773]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[02:12:27.773 --> 02:12:29.754]  You've got to trust in the plan of God.
[02:12:30.314 --> 02:12:31.015]  We're good to go.
[02:12:51.727 --> 02:13:00.232]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroeder here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:13:00.232 --> 02:13:10.819]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time, and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:13:10.819 --> 02:13:13.740]  But then I read the ingredients, and I was blown away.
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:14.321]  Listen to this.
[02:13:14.901 --> 02:13:16.162]  Organic pea fiber.
[02:13:16.162 --> 02:13:17.603]  Organic alfalfa leaf.
[02:13:17.603 --> 02:13:19.045]  Organic wheatgrass leaf.
[02:13:19.045 --> 02:13:20.486]  Organic cilantro leaf.
[02:13:20.486 --> 02:13:21.907]  Organic kale leaf.
[02:13:21.907 --> 02:13:23.448]  Organic flax sprout.
[02:13:23.448 --> 02:13:25.050]  Organic quinoa sprout.
[02:13:25.050 --> 02:13:28.513]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[02:13:28.513 --> 02:13:29.774]  Just one of these ingredients
[02:13:30.034 --> 02:13:31.654]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:14:12.961 --> 02:14:16.683]  Well, the film came out on July 4th, and we posted it to man.video.
[02:14:16.683 --> 02:14:18.144]  They were very gracious to do that.
[02:14:18.144 --> 02:14:24.527]  An emergency release, even though they've made films that have been widely seen and been on national television.
[02:14:24.527 --> 02:14:25.207]  It's one of their best.
[02:14:25.207 --> 02:14:27.448]  They put it out for free as an emergency.
[02:14:27.448 --> 02:14:28.469]  The Cosmic Hoax.
[02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:34.533]  So important for peace and human future, and I really think it's an amazing film.
[02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:38.855]  It's free right now at Bandot Video, and I've had it moved back to the top as the featured film.
[02:14:38.855 --> 02:14:40.496]  Here's part of the trailer.
[02:14:40.496 --> 02:14:44.279]  Again, the main speaker in it, one of many others, is Dr. Stephen Greer.
[02:14:44.279 --> 02:14:44.659]  Here it is.
[02:14:44.659 --> 02:14:51.544]  It's a story about a hoax that might happen in the future.
[02:14:51.544 --> 02:14:54.326]  It's a story about a cosmic hoax that has been unfolding for 60 years.
[02:14:57.366 --> 02:15:07.293]  We're quickly approaching a point of no return.
[02:15:07.293 --> 02:15:09.455]  I've been warning about this for decades.
[02:15:31.377 --> 02:15:33.799]  No, not that.
[02:15:33.799 --> 02:15:36.962]  This.
[02:15:36.962 --> 02:15:46.150]  Speaking of conspiracy theories that actually have truth at the bottom of them, the Corona Relief Bill the President signed last month contains a provision that hasn't gotten a lot of attention.
[02:15:46.150 --> 02:15:54.197]  It directs the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other agencies, to disclose what they know about UFOs within 180 days.
[02:15:54.197 --> 02:15:56.239]  So what are they going to tell us?
[02:15:57.970 --> 02:16:07.858]  I provided briefings for four presidents, foreign heads of state, generals, and a sitting CIA director who later betrayed me.
[02:16:07.858 --> 02:16:09.779]  I've seen lives destroyed.
[02:16:09.779 --> 02:16:13.322]  William Colby has been missing since April 27th.
[02:16:13.322 --> 02:16:17.565]  His canoe was found washed up on the banks of the Wicomico River.
[02:16:17.565 --> 02:16:19.547]  Friends murdered.
[02:16:19.547 --> 02:16:22.970]  Unthinkable evil unleashed on our planet.
[02:16:22.970 --> 02:16:25.792]  All to protect this illegal and immoral secrecy.
[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:37.325]  And nothing I've seen scares me more than this unprecedented moment we're living through.
[02:16:37.325 --> 02:16:43.048]  We're in the final hour of an agenda that has been playing out for nearly a century.
[02:16:43.048 --> 02:16:56.915]  Centralized monopolies of power in government, the defense industry, and the corporate media are all converging on the same narrative that extraterrestrials are real, they're here, and they're a threat.
[02:16:57.526 --> 02:16:59.627]  Those are not weather balloons.
[02:16:59.627 --> 02:17:05.651]  Those are clearly autonomous aircraft of some kind that are, as you put it, swarming U.S.
[02:17:05.651 --> 02:17:07.412]  military craft.
[02:17:07.412 --> 02:17:08.353]  So, there are two options.
[02:17:08.353 --> 02:17:10.274]  These are craft under intelligent control.
[02:17:10.274 --> 02:17:17.218]  These are craft under intelligent control and they're flying with impunity, Tucker, within our airspace.
[02:17:17.218 --> 02:17:22.461]  And they can outmaneuver, outperform anything that we seem to have.
[02:17:22.461 --> 02:17:26.744]  We need to find out who's operating them and also what the intent is.
[02:17:28.154 --> 02:17:31.598]  The truth is, we do know who's operating them.
[02:17:31.598 --> 02:17:34.461]  Some are indeed extraterrestrial.
[02:17:34.461 --> 02:17:37.185]  And they are absolutely not a threat, as you will see.
[02:17:39.116 --> 02:17:49.867]  It is, in fact, the secrecy that is an existential threat to life on Earth and beyond, as stated by the first CIA director, Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillings.
[02:17:49.867 --> 02:17:52.950]  That's just part of the trailer, but see, the whole film for free!
[02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:54.091]  A cosmic hoax!
[02:17:54.091 --> 02:17:54.971]  An expose!
[02:17:54.971 --> 02:17:57.074]  Now featured video at Bandot Video.
[02:17:57.074 --> 02:17:58.235]  Okay, this is a shorter segment.
[02:17:58.235 --> 02:17:58.595]  Too long.
[02:17:58.595 --> 02:18:00.036]  The segment's coming up with Dr. Stephen Greer.
[02:18:00.757 --> 02:18:12.066]  So continue with, clearly, if there's advanced civilizations, and Christ said, you know, I've got many flocks, the point is, they could, and all the ancient societies recorded this, they could destroy us like that.
[02:18:12.066 --> 02:18:27.419]  So the whole idea that these things are swarming military bases and they're always coming out of the skunkworks, they're always coming out of Area 51, I mean, it's insanely obvious that when you look at Hollywood and all of it, and then your sources and your research, that they're building this up to unify and control us.
[02:18:28.493 --> 02:18:29.394]  Correct.
[02:18:29.394 --> 02:18:37.521]  I have 980 whistleblowers now that have been in the agency and aerospace companies that have verified what's in this film.
[02:18:37.521 --> 02:18:50.772]  We have, in my early briefings with the Clinton administration and the CIA director, we discovered that most of the senior leadership in the United States are not read into or briefed on this matter.
[02:18:51.372 --> 02:19:05.661]  And that, in fact, there is a extreme deep state, let's call it, that are known as unacknowledged special access projects that evolved in the 1950s that have been running amok for, you know, over 65 years.
[02:19:05.661 --> 02:19:09.383]  And I think that this is what Eisenhower ran up against.
[02:19:09.383 --> 02:19:10.824]  He knew about this issue.
[02:19:10.824 --> 02:19:12.264]  Remember, he warned of it.
[02:19:12.264 --> 02:19:12.845]  He warned of it.
[02:19:12.845 --> 02:19:16.407]  He said a technological elite in control of the military-industrial complex.
[02:19:16.707 --> 02:19:18.470]  Yes, exactly.
[02:19:18.470 --> 02:19:23.238]  And he said, this is a threat to our democracy and our way of life and our security.
[02:19:23.238 --> 02:19:24.580]  So they all knew this.
[02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:25.742]  They knew it was happening.
[02:19:26.403 --> 02:19:51.929]  And I recently had Paul Mellon, he was a supporter of Hitler, and at the end of World War II, his grandsons on my team has told me this, that he in fact organized the CIA with Alan Dulles, but they had already brought over from Germany a prototype of an anti-gravity disc, and that was one of the big finds at the end of World War II from Germany.
[02:19:51.929 --> 02:19:52.829]  And was that the bell?
[02:19:52.829 --> 02:19:53.449]  Was that the bell?
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:55.681]  No, there was a bell.
[02:19:55.681 --> 02:19:59.765]  This was actually a disc-shaped object that was electrogravitic.
[02:19:59.765 --> 02:20:01.186]  They had not perfected it.
[02:20:01.186 --> 02:20:05.310]  Had the Germans perfected it, they would have won World War II.
[02:20:05.310 --> 02:20:05.971]  Keep going, please.
[02:20:07.026 --> 02:20:30.211]  So what has happened is that these covert programs have evolved very strongly to the point now they've decided to pull the trigger on officially through the government releasing these sort of reports and the mainstream media working lockstep with the intelligence community are now putting out this false narrative that there's a threat to the national security.
[02:20:30.211 --> 02:20:35.312]  Now the only part of that that's true is that these covert human illegal
[02:20:36.235 --> 02:20:39.216]  Projects are a threat to the national security.
[02:20:39.216 --> 02:20:42.078]  The interstellar civilizations are certainly not.
[02:20:42.078 --> 02:20:45.639]  They are so advanced that if they were a threat, we'd all be gone by now.
[02:20:45.639 --> 02:20:46.560]  Believe me.
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:51.222]  I mean, these technologies are dealing with interstellar transportation capabilities.
[02:20:51.222 --> 02:20:53.643]  Now, it doesn't mean that they're not worried about us.
[02:20:53.643 --> 02:20:59.606]  I think the whole modern era of sightings happened because we started detonating atomic and thermonuclear weapons.
[02:21:00.126 --> 02:21:08.753]  Which ended up being very disruptive to dimensions that go beyond what we think of as normal 3D space-time.
[02:21:08.753 --> 02:21:10.274]  Please continue.
[02:21:10.274 --> 02:21:27.587]  So I'm concerned at this point that there's this juggernaut happening in the media and also across the mainstream media, left, right, Tucker Carlson, MSNBC, doesn't matter, where this false narrative is being put out and in reality what they're showing to the American public
[02:21:28.371 --> 02:21:37.757]  Our clandestine, military, human, mostly American aircraft, but they're saying, well, we don't know what they are and et cetera and so on.
[02:21:37.757 --> 02:21:41.199]  Sure, and to stir it up so they can even attack us and say it's aliens.
[02:21:41.199 --> 02:21:42.860]  I know Tucker, he's a good guy.
[02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:45.461]  He's just showing these amazing machines because you can't doubt it.
[02:21:45.461 --> 02:21:46.802]  And they're saying it's not human.
[02:21:46.802 --> 02:21:48.203]  Right.
[02:21:48.203 --> 02:21:49.584]  You would go on Tucker's show, wouldn't you?
[02:21:50.535 --> 02:21:53.258]  Oh, I'd absolutely go on his show and clarify this.
[02:21:53.258 --> 02:21:55.240]  And we have documents, by the way, to prove this.
[02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:59.004]  We have schematics and drawings from the Lockheed Skunk Works.
[02:21:59.004 --> 02:22:02.588]  I have the best aerospace researchers in the world on my team.
[02:22:02.588 --> 02:22:04.630]  And we can prove what we are saying.
[02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:08.635]  And so I think this is where the public needs to be properly informed.
[02:22:08.635 --> 02:22:11.498]  Now, this secret is bigger than the ET question.
[02:22:12.217 --> 02:22:15.942]  The fact that there are these technologies that are clandestine, that's the crown jewel.
[02:22:15.942 --> 02:22:17.344]  That would totally free the planet!
[02:22:17.344 --> 02:22:17.925]  Exactly!
[02:22:17.925 --> 02:22:18.225]  E.T.
[02:22:18.225 --> 02:22:22.291]  aside, advanced technologies, free energy would totally create world peace!
[02:22:23.086 --> 02:22:31.834]  Yeah, totally create world peace, end poverty, fix the environment without a bunch of cap-and-trade, half-band-aid solutions.
[02:22:31.834 --> 02:22:33.236]  And that's why it's so important.
[02:22:33.236 --> 02:22:34.176]  Let's talk about this.
[02:22:34.176 --> 02:22:34.857]  This is the key.
[02:22:34.857 --> 02:22:35.498]  You're absolutely right.
[02:22:35.498 --> 02:22:37.680]  We know they are suppressing advanced technologies.
[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:38.320]  That's a fact.
[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:39.321]  Not debatable.
[02:22:39.321 --> 02:22:43.165]  How do we somehow stop this elite from keeping us in a dark age?
[02:22:43.165 --> 02:22:43.745]  We'll be right back.
[02:22:43.745 --> 02:22:44.066]  Stay with us.
[02:22:53.564 --> 02:22:55.625]  Your voice counts.
[02:22:55.625 --> 02:23:00.688]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:23:00.688 --> 02:23:03.270]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:04.771]  They know you're angry.
[02:23:04.771 --> 02:23:09.594]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[02:23:52.844 --> 02:23:59.608]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[02:23:59.608 --> 02:24:03.171]  And that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[02:24:03.171 --> 02:24:06.693]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[02:24:06.693 --> 02:24:11.156]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[02:24:12.298 --> 02:24:13.018]  Well, guess what?
[02:24:13.018 --> 02:24:27.125]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist, that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV, and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[02:24:28.326 --> 02:24:33.831]  ...of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[02:24:33.831 --> 02:24:40.196]  The problem for them was, the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[02:24:40.196 --> 02:24:49.504]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[02:24:49.504 --> 02:24:50.605]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:51.952 --> 02:24:55.335]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[02:24:55.335 --> 02:25:05.283]  And so, as bad as things are with the globalist attack on humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[02:25:05.283 --> 02:25:08.606]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[02:25:08.606 --> 02:25:20.195]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[02:25:21.036 --> 02:25:25.680]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:27.781]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.
[02:25:27.781 --> 02:25:32.104]  You fund us, you support InfoWarsTore.com, you get great products to you at the same time.
[02:25:32.104 --> 02:25:41.751]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[02:25:41.751 --> 02:25:49.137]  That's our job, so please, keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be the shock troops in the information war.
[02:25:52.418 --> 02:25:58.499]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[02:25:58.499 --> 02:26:06.001]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[02:26:06.001 --> 02:26:08.302]  Well, it's all come down to this.

[02:26:47.112 --> 02:26:48.913]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:18.123]  Live, raw, and uncensored.
[02:27:18.123 --> 02:27:20.045]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:20.045 --> 02:27:22.247]  As soon as this hour ends, I'm going to take some of your phone calls.
[02:27:22.247 --> 02:27:24.469]  I have Gerald Cilente joining us.
[02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:26.391]  We'll get to all the callers that are patiently holding.
[02:27:26.391 --> 02:27:29.514]  Dr. Steven Greer has put out an amazing new film.
[02:27:29.514 --> 02:27:33.518]  It's free at band.video or freeworldnews.tv.
[02:27:33.518 --> 02:27:38.082]  The Cosmic Hoax and definitely Hollywood, the government, the Pentagon.
[02:27:39.068 --> 02:27:39.348]  I think?
[02:28:00.569 --> 02:28:02.270]  But don't let us have all the new technologies.
[02:28:02.270 --> 02:28:08.032]  I'm all for get rid of the older technology, have better new, but oh no, instead we get windmills that don't work.
[02:28:08.032 --> 02:28:15.755]  So Dr. Steven Greer, you were getting into this, the carbon taxes, all of it, very anti-human, post-human world, like a new form of feudalism.
[02:28:15.755 --> 02:28:19.016]  Instead of just letting us have the old technology and running out of it, they're taking that away.
[02:28:19.696 --> 02:28:21.937]  Wall not having us have the new.
[02:28:21.937 --> 02:28:23.137]  Who is this shadowy group?
[02:28:23.137 --> 02:28:35.841]  What would you call this transhumanist cabal that's telling us humans are bad and we're a bad species and they're gonna phase us out and they're gonna merge with machines and make a new species.
[02:28:36.841 --> 02:28:41.184]  All these globalists say, oh, I don't believe in God or aliens, I'm gonna be a God.
[02:28:41.184 --> 02:28:42.985]  That's what Ray Kurzweil says.
[02:28:42.985 --> 02:28:45.247]  And so they're making animal-human hybrids.
[02:28:45.247 --> 02:28:51.891]  They're making what I would say is alien, while telling us, look out for aliens from distant stars, they're coming to get us.
[02:28:51.891 --> 02:28:52.731]  None of it makes sense.
[02:28:52.731 --> 02:29:06.000]  We can see the group trying to play God, trying to, like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, use humanity as something they believe will transcend, but the whole thing to me just sounds very, very evil.
[02:29:07.469 --> 02:29:11.952]  Well, it is, but you have to understand this is an organization that's transnational.
[02:29:11.952 --> 02:29:15.435]  It goes beyond normal geopolitical boundaries.
[02:29:15.435 --> 02:29:27.404]  Within the United States, which is the crown jewel for financial as well as technology, it has the strongest presence, obviously, as well as in Europe and other very wealthy countries.
[02:29:28.996 --> 02:29:32.997]  What people have to understand is that it is outside the chain of command.
[02:29:32.997 --> 02:29:50.442]  Now, this was my coming of age in the 90s when I had a series of meetings with senior people in government, including the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the CIA director, the head of intelligence joint staff, all of whom had been denied access to these projects that we had proof
[02:29:51.162 --> 02:29:52.223]  Of existing.
[02:29:52.223 --> 02:29:55.846]  Now, most people listening are going, what is this man talking about?
[02:29:55.846 --> 02:30:06.535]  You're talking about, you know, the most senior flag officers in the Pentagon or the director of the CIA being flat out lied to and denied access.
[02:30:06.535 --> 02:30:07.456]  And that has happened.
[02:30:07.456 --> 02:30:10.599]  Now, there have been some generals and some CIA directors
[02:30:11.039 --> 02:30:23.628]  That are in this sort of group that has been called the majority... So it's a classic secret society model which predates intelligence agencies of rings within rings and so it's like Spectre in James Bond.
[02:30:23.628 --> 02:30:28.972]  There's an international globalist group through corporations and government that basically keep everybody else compartmentalized.
[02:30:30.011 --> 02:30:32.212]  Yeah, and the big action isn't even in government.
[02:30:32.212 --> 02:30:37.394]  The big action is actually in the corporate, financial, private banking sectors.
[02:30:37.394 --> 02:30:46.117]  But this was something we unraveled back in the 90s, and there's a documentary on Amazon and on Tubi called Unacknowledged.
[02:30:46.778 --> 02:30:50.883]  It's been seen by about 700 million people and it kind of unpacks this.
[02:30:50.883 --> 02:31:02.999]  One of the things for people to remember, this Director of National Intelligence report was assembled by a bunch of people who probably were not clear to have access to the very things they claim they're reporting on.
[02:31:02.999 --> 02:31:04.461]  This is a big problem.
[02:31:05.001 --> 02:31:15.347]  And I think, for example, it came out in the New York Times that the Pentagon, our tax dollars, spent $22 million that went to this outfit known as Bigelow Aerospace.
[02:31:15.347 --> 02:31:18.209]  It's now closed in Las Vegas.
[02:31:18.209 --> 02:31:24.052]  Well, that money was tracked to that entity because the person who was behind it
[02:31:24.512 --> 02:31:34.695]  Not Mr. Bigelow, but the intelligence guys behind it wanted to be sure that nothing came out of that report, and it was a complete throwing away of $22 million.
[02:31:34.695 --> 02:31:39.316]  So there's this dog and pony show going on, and now it's going on again.
[02:31:39.316 --> 02:31:41.577]  They're going to have hearings in the Congress.
[02:31:41.577 --> 02:31:46.258]  I'm sure no legitimate truth will be presented at these hearings.
[02:31:46.258 --> 02:31:52.940]  And I think the only way we're going to fix this problem is for we, the people, to stand up and say, look, we're going to educate ourselves on this.
[02:31:55.148 --> 02:31:55.809]  Fooled again.
[02:31:55.809 --> 02:31:57.451]  That's what we have to do.
[02:31:57.451 --> 02:32:08.124]  But yes, the organization is transnational and the U.S., one of the senior components to it, is called the Majority Intelligence Committee or, ironically, MAGIC.
[02:32:11.656 --> 02:32:19.624]  We know that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and all that got set up by Goddard and you had all these other weird Aleister Crowley-ites that were following it.
[02:32:19.624 --> 02:32:25.130]  And I know you just go off the science and the background and the rat line and the documents that we know of Operation Paperclip, but...
[02:32:26.263 --> 02:32:33.950]  From my research, you can't swing a stick in here from Skull and Bones to Bohemian Grove to any of this without running into the occult.
[02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:42.899]  And they believe that they're channeling, I don't know whether it's extraterrestrial, interdimensional, whatever it is, they call it angels and gods that are giving them these ideas.
[02:32:42.899 --> 02:32:44.020]  So I just go off the facts.
[02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:51.485]  And so, from my studying of this shadow group, they believe they're in contact with something off-world.
[02:32:51.485 --> 02:32:53.166]  Have you run into that information?
[02:32:53.166 --> 02:32:59.611]  And if so, is it inter-dimensional, or is it off-world, or are these people just psychotic and insane?
[02:33:01.212 --> 02:33:04.474]  Well, I think many of them are psychotic and insane, frankly.
[02:33:04.474 --> 02:33:11.319]  But I think they're believed that they're in touch with beings from other dimensions that are not extraterrestrial.
[02:33:11.319 --> 02:33:12.480]  People confuse this.
[02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:13.281]  I mean, an angel.
[02:33:13.281 --> 02:33:17.203]  You know, I was at the Vatican meeting with a senior theologian, too, Pope.
[02:33:18.424 --> 02:33:19.145]  We're good to go.
[02:33:40.623 --> 02:33:41.843]  We're good to go.
[02:34:09.090 --> 02:34:16.760]  And has killed a number of people that I know of who worked in this area and has an organization that is involved with Satan worship.
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:21.307]  And, you know, he has a wife that publishes a devil's newsletter.
[02:34:21.307 --> 02:34:23.930]  And this is a very senior member of this group.
[02:34:23.930 --> 02:34:25.492]  I have met him and he's he's a
[02:34:26.113 --> 02:34:27.374]  Spooky character, I'll tell you.
[02:34:27.374 --> 02:34:33.218]  Well, the reason I'm not telling the truth, Dr. Greer, is I've had these very groups try to recruit me since I was a teenager, repeatedly.
[02:34:33.218 --> 02:34:35.639]  And I guess that's what they do most of the time, is try to recruit people.
[02:34:35.639 --> 02:34:39.762]  And really, it's just an excuse to act like complete psychotics, like you said.
[02:34:39.762 --> 02:34:41.783]  Well, but they have enormous resources.
[02:34:41.783 --> 02:34:47.026]  In 1992, as a young emergency doctor, I started digging into this.
[02:34:47.026 --> 02:34:52.430]  I was taken to a meeting with the head of Army Intelligence and personally offered $2 billion if I would
[02:34:55.032 --> 02:35:01.322]  Join that group and give up what I was trying to do to disclose the facts and the truth about this.
[02:35:01.322 --> 02:35:04.226]  Literally $2 billion back in 1992.
[02:35:04.226 --> 02:35:08.873]  I refused, of course, and this man went to my wife.
[02:35:09.651 --> 02:35:11.393]  And try to convince her to convince me.
[02:35:11.393 --> 02:35:14.777]  It was the spookiest thing I've ever seen.
[02:35:14.777 --> 02:35:17.460]  Yeah, I mean, this is the level of corruption.
[02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:23.667]  I met with a man shortly after that who said, you know, we have given at least $10 million to over 10,000 people to secure their
[02:35:26.650 --> 02:35:35.372]  Well, there is a project known as Operation Looking Glass and Red Light where they can sort of gaze into the future with some of these technologies and they often will see someone could be a
[02:35:56.894 --> 02:35:57.895]  Why didn't they kill us?
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:15.681]  Well, I almost did die.
[02:36:15.681 --> 02:36:21.888]  As you know, three people on my team simultaneously got metastatic cancer, myself included.
[02:36:21.888 --> 02:36:22.909]  I'm the only one that survived.
[02:36:22.909 --> 02:36:23.269]  That's right.
[02:36:23.269 --> 02:36:25.251]  Let's talk about that with Dr. Steven Greer when we come back.
[02:36:25.251 --> 02:36:26.652]  This is very serious.
[02:36:26.652 --> 02:36:31.918]  They also can give you these pneumonias that, again, mutate and are harmless after they kill you.
[02:36:31.918 --> 02:36:32.999]  It's pretty rough, folks.
[02:36:33.419 --> 02:36:35.640]  And there's a God in this universe, too, folks.
[02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:36.360]  Don't forget that.
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:38.061]  Powerful information on Steven Greer.
[02:36:38.061 --> 02:36:43.143]  And then your phone calls, Jill and Mel and Deborah and JD and Travis and James and Oshawa.
[02:36:43.143 --> 02:36:46.044]  We'll go to every single one of you after our guest leaves us in one segment.
[02:36:46.044 --> 02:36:46.364]  Stay with us.
[02:36:50.695 --> 02:36:54.376]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[02:36:54.376 --> 02:37:03.879]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[02:37:03.879 --> 02:37:10.621]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 20-20 prices.
[02:37:10.621 --> 02:37:14.082]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.

[02:37:19.724 --> 02:37:21.805]  But only for one more week.
[02:37:21.805 --> 02:37:24.286]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[02:37:24.286 --> 02:37:25.307]  But that's it.
[02:37:25.307 --> 02:37:27.708]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[02:37:27.708 --> 02:37:29.909]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[02:37:29.909 --> 02:37:31.910]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:33.191]  It's the highest quality.
[02:37:33.191 --> 02:37:34.351]  Hundreds of high-quality foods.
[02:37:34.351 --> 02:37:36.052]  Three-month, six-month year supplies.
[02:37:36.052 --> 02:37:39.554]  All ready for you at Infowarsstore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:37:42.475 --> 02:37:50.375]  Again, InfoWarsTore.com, 10% off on high-quality, storable food, ready to ship, but it ends in just one week, so take action now while you still can!
[02:37:51.203 --> 02:37:54.084]  The biosecurity state is here.
[02:37:54.084 --> 02:38:00.005]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[02:38:00.005 --> 02:38:13.768]  The corrupt puppet Prime Minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[02:38:15.228 --> 02:38:18.429]  And that in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[02:38:18.429 --> 02:38:22.430]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[02:38:22.430 --> 02:38:24.210]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:38:24.210 --> 02:38:26.891]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[02:38:26.891 --> 02:38:29.131]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[02:38:29.131 --> 02:38:31.672]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:38:31.672 --> 02:38:41.294]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[02:38:41.994 --> 02:38:43.935]  And Bulwars will continue to steadfastly fight this.
[02:38:43.935 --> 02:38:45.415]  I don't know how long we can.
[02:38:45.415 --> 02:38:46.776]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[02:38:46.776 --> 02:38:48.417]  God bless and good luck.
[02:38:48.417 --> 02:38:52.158]  I would, again, get right with God right now.
[02:38:52.158 --> 02:39:00.342]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[02:39:00.342 --> 02:39:09.125]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[02:39:09.125 --> 02:39:11.066]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up.
[02:39:11.446 --> 02:39:11.646]  I think?
[02:39:41.386 --> 02:39:49.218]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[02:39:49.218 --> 02:39:51.742]  They're 50% off right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:39:52.622 --> 02:39:58.704]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[02:39:58.704 --> 02:40:06.206]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[02:40:06.206 --> 02:40:08.506]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[02:40:08.506 --> 02:40:12.088]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[02:40:14.008 --> 02:40:22.174]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[02:40:22.174 --> 02:40:28.079]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[02:40:28.079 --> 02:40:38.827]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[02:40:38.827 --> 02:40:40.088]  Thank you and God bless.
[02:40:40.848 --> 02:40:47.314]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[02:40:47.314 --> 02:40:49.115]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:41:07.972 --> 02:41:15.174]  There's a man going around taking names, and he decides who to free.
[02:41:15.174 --> 02:41:24.337]  Alright, Dr. Stephen Greer is our guest's final segment, and I've invited him on to do an hour-long commercial-free special report very soon.
[02:41:24.337 --> 02:41:25.897]  He's agreed to it.
[02:41:25.897 --> 02:41:32.079]  So look for that to happen, and we'll also play excerpts of it here on the main radio-slash-TV show.
[02:41:32.079 --> 02:41:35.740]  But Dr. Greer, you got into targeting things you've gone through, how serious this is.
[02:41:36.300 --> 02:41:36.921]  A lot of the facts.
[02:41:36.921 --> 02:41:40.407]  They have a lot of advanced medicine that they can use as weapons.
[02:41:40.407 --> 02:41:43.973]  Everything from race-specific down to individually targeted.
[02:41:43.973 --> 02:41:45.015]  Finish up telling us that.
[02:41:45.015 --> 02:41:45.896]  You got caught off of the break.
[02:41:45.896 --> 02:41:50.023]  And then any other points you'd like to impart to this very hungry audience.
[02:41:51.445 --> 02:42:01.653]  Yeah, I think the main thing that people have to understand is that whatever technologies you think exist, we have technologies that are beyond your imagination.
[02:42:01.653 --> 02:42:19.567]  You know, one of the people at our 20th anniversary event in April for the National Press Club of the Disclosure Project launch that we just did in April in Scottsdale, a man who is one of the most renowned aerospace researchers, James Goodall,
[02:42:20.647 --> 02:42:28.832]  spoke about his last conversation with the famed Lockheed Skunkworks CEO, Ben Rich.
[02:42:28.832 --> 02:42:47.883]  And Ben Rich was about a week from passing away, and he told this man that out in the desert in California, just the Lockheed Skunkworks, the Cube, which is deep underground, there are things out there that are beyond what you can imagine we've done and been portrayed in Star Wars or Star Trek.
[02:42:48.643 --> 02:42:52.587]  And he's referring to extremely advanced technologies.
[02:42:52.587 --> 02:42:58.472]  We have spent trillions of dollars of taxpayer monies over the years on these technologies.
[02:42:58.472 --> 02:43:00.233]  We have not gotten a benefit from them.
[02:43:00.233 --> 02:43:14.806]  These are controlled by a group of sociopaths that want to use them for endless war and destruction and, frankly, evil purposes, rather than the same technologies could be used to give us a paradise on this planet.
[02:43:15.206 --> 02:43:21.528]  So, people need to understand that this is not like a superficial, gee, are there aliens out in space issue.
[02:43:21.528 --> 02:43:27.709]  This is very much about the human future and I would encourage people to help us get the word out on this.
[02:43:27.709 --> 02:43:33.571]  By the way, you go to my website, SiriusDisclosure.com, S-I-R-I-U-S Disclosure.com,
[02:43:34.091 --> 02:43:39.493]  You can download this Cosmic Hoax film for free and put it on your YouTube channel.
[02:43:39.493 --> 02:43:42.194]  Any site that's free, you can put it out there.
[02:43:42.194 --> 02:43:48.516]  We've released it so it's a creative commons, as they call it, so everyone can share this with everyone else.
[02:43:48.516 --> 02:43:53.998]  And it's the way we need to do this because, obviously, we're being shadow banned.
[02:43:53.998 --> 02:43:58.520]  We're having a lot of blacklisting of what we're doing in the mainstream media.
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:06.726]  The mainstream media only wants to feature people who are going to repeat those three lies I started at the top of the show talking about.
[02:44:06.726 --> 02:44:12.151]  That we don't know what these are, we don't have anything that works this way, and they're a threat to the national security.
[02:44:12.151 --> 02:44:14.513]  And let's just go back, because you mentioned this.
[02:44:14.513 --> 02:44:19.697]  I mean, I know a high-production film probably costs millions of dollars, I don't know, to make, and you give it out free because you care.
[02:44:19.697 --> 02:44:26.703]  You're calling on human intelligence and action to get it out, and people can download it at Bandot Video, share it wherever you get it, get it and share it.
[02:44:26.703 --> 02:44:27.583]  But let's go back to this.
[02:44:28.934 --> 02:44:29.475]  I study this.
[02:44:29.475 --> 02:44:31.016]  This isn't hypothetical.
[02:44:31.016 --> 02:44:32.077]  It's mainline science.
[02:44:32.077 --> 02:44:34.819]  The stuff we were told didn't exist 30 years ago did exist.
[02:44:34.819 --> 02:44:35.520]  They suppress it.
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:37.342]  It's disruptive technology.
[02:44:37.342 --> 02:44:38.823]  They use the Secret Service.
[02:44:38.823 --> 02:44:47.051]  They use the different federal agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and all these other groups to shut this down.
[02:44:47.051 --> 02:44:48.952]  Just like they came and grabbed all of Tesla's work.
[02:44:48.952 --> 02:44:49.653]  The FBI did.
[02:44:49.653 --> 02:44:50.274]  That's on record.
[02:44:50.794 --> 02:44:55.635]  And so they've been suppressing a lot of technology because it disrupts the industries they already have.
[02:44:55.635 --> 02:45:00.396]  Now they're so advanced, they feel like they're God, and they're keeping us in a new dark age.
[02:45:00.396 --> 02:45:01.876]  This is what will fix the environment.
[02:45:01.876 --> 02:45:02.456]  Explain that.
[02:45:02.456 --> 02:45:06.017]  I mean, you started getting into that about 30 minutes ago, but the break cut you off.
[02:45:06.017 --> 02:45:07.397]  This is what we're really talking about.
[02:45:07.397 --> 02:45:10.338]  Not windmills that don't transfer the power properly.
[02:45:10.338 --> 02:45:13.039]  Not ridiculous medieval stuff.
[02:45:13.039 --> 02:45:15.799]  That's an excuse to keep us from the real technology.
[02:45:15.799 --> 02:45:19.740]  And how do you see us getting into that and demanding that transfer to the people?
[02:45:20.836 --> 02:45:28.658]  Well, see, those technologies that everyone's talking about that we're spending trillions of dollars on are what I call environmental theater.
[02:45:28.658 --> 02:45:31.479]  It's just theatrics.
[02:45:31.479 --> 02:45:41.142]  The real technologies we've had for a hundred years, literally since Tesla and maybe before, and they've gone through many refined generations.
[02:45:41.142 --> 02:45:47.804]  I have a document from the American Federation of Sciences from 2010 where they state that there have been 5,160
[02:45:50.928 --> 02:46:00.540]  A patent seized by the Patent Office under national security orders that have to do with these creative breakthroughs in energy and technology.
[02:46:00.540 --> 02:46:02.462]  So your viewers should think about this.
[02:46:02.462 --> 02:46:10.272]  Imagine having a box, something like your heat pump, but probably smaller, that would run your house, your business, your factory.
[02:46:10.772 --> 02:46:18.738]  No energy cost, no pollution, pulling energy out of what's called the zero point or the fabric of space-time around you.
[02:46:18.738 --> 02:46:21.240]  This has been around for a very long time.
[02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:26.844]  Meanwhile, we have these plug-in electric cars that are being charged off a coal-fired power grid.
[02:46:26.844 --> 02:46:34.009]  Listen, I have a member of my family at UT when he was in high school, part of the Plan 2 program, that saw what you're talking about taking power right out of the ground.
[02:46:34.932 --> 02:46:35.633]  Correct.
[02:46:35.633 --> 02:46:36.733]  Absolutely.
[02:46:36.733 --> 02:46:39.175]  And these have been around for decades.
[02:46:39.175 --> 02:46:54.105]  In fact, if you look all the way back to the early 1900s, a guy named Stubblefield, you see a Nikola Tesla with Stubblefield, and they have what they call an earth battery, where the guy is running his farm off of something you just described.
[02:46:54.105 --> 02:46:54.445]  That was in 1908.
[02:46:56.098 --> 02:47:07.627]  So, you know, you have what I call these petro-fascists, the people who want everyone dependent on a global macroeconomic system that we no longer need.
[02:47:07.627 --> 02:47:12.831]  And I think this is a big problem because the heart of the secrecy on the UFO issue
[02:47:13.613 --> 02:47:14.734]  Just think of a UFO.
[02:47:14.734 --> 02:47:15.735]  Forget that word.
[02:47:15.735 --> 02:47:18.657]  It's actually an alternative energy and propulsion device.
[02:47:18.657 --> 02:47:19.778]  That's what it is.
[02:47:19.778 --> 02:47:23.040]  And it's not using rockets, and it's not using jet A fuel.
[02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:37.671]  So it's an alternative energy and propulsion device, which is why these covert interests, who are the global power elites, this sort of industrial fascist base that runs the planet, they do not want people to know that exists.
[02:47:37.671 --> 02:47:42.835]  That's why the man-made UFOs are bigger secret than the extraterrestrial.
[02:47:44.369 --> 02:47:47.511]  And again, you've already quantified that, but explain it again because that's so important.
[02:47:47.511 --> 02:47:52.814]  We already are the advanced civilization, and it's a red herring to talk about stuff outside of us.
[02:47:54.130 --> 02:47:54.430]  Right.
[02:47:54.430 --> 02:47:55.351]  And we have all that.
[02:47:55.351 --> 02:48:04.136]  Look, I mean, we've spent 70 years reverse engineering extraterrestrial vehicles we acquired in the 40s and 50s, trillions of dollars.
[02:48:04.136 --> 02:48:12.682]  Even before then, there were huge breakthroughs in electromagnetic field theory and generation of energy using very high voltage systems.
[02:48:12.682 --> 02:48:19.006]  I don't get into the physics of it, but this is wonderful news for my 11 grandchildren, right?
[02:48:19.546 --> 02:48:22.750]  But it's very bad news if we can't get it resolved.
[02:48:22.750 --> 02:48:27.195]  And that's why it's going to take we the people rising up peacefully.
[02:48:27.195 --> 02:48:33.662]  And my next whole big documentary that I want to do is on this whole lost century of technology.
[02:48:33.662 --> 02:48:38.227]  And what can we do as a public interest group to bring these technologies out?
[02:48:39.468 --> 02:48:40.709]  Bypass the government.
[02:48:40.709 --> 02:48:43.110]  Bypass the big transnational corporations.
[02:48:43.110 --> 02:48:53.356]  I was about to say, the reason they admit their panic, if you really read deeply in the Davos Group and the UN is, so many even small universities, even private groups, are taking basically almost free energy.
[02:48:53.356 --> 02:49:00.080]  It's not working and they're worried it's about to be scaled up and as soon as that gets adopted, it's over for them and their control.
[02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:02.242]  And so I think that's why they're trying to bring in a worldwide tyranny right now.
[02:49:03.291 --> 02:49:08.234]  That's exactly, because they know that writing's on the wall with that.
[02:49:08.234 --> 02:49:16.478]  And actually, as our disclosure project on the UFO and new energy issue ramped up, that's when they stood up.
[02:49:16.478 --> 02:49:23.922]  The TTSA group and the Director of National Intelligence report, because they're trying to hijack the narrative back to these repeatable lies.
[02:49:23.922 --> 02:49:25.723]  Oh, it's incredibly obvious, Dr. Grierman.
[02:49:25.723 --> 02:49:26.824]  You're not tooting your horn there.
[02:49:27.364 --> 02:49:29.926]  Because I thought you sounded incredible 25 years ago, but it all came through.
[02:49:29.926 --> 02:49:35.729]  Like you said, they literally stood up this entire drive to counter what you're doing.
[02:49:35.729 --> 02:49:43.173]  Yes, and that's they have to do that because what we've been we've been reaching too many hundreds of millions of people.
[02:49:43.173 --> 02:49:44.754]  But I think, you know, it's a battle.
[02:49:44.754 --> 02:49:46.275]  You call it InfoWars.
[02:49:46.275 --> 02:49:56.281]  It's a battle for the minds and the hearts of the human people for a good future versus this disastrous extinction level event future they want us to slide into.
[02:49:56.861 --> 02:49:57.241]  Exactly.
[02:49:57.241 --> 02:50:04.503]  They're trying to create a controlled artificial extinction event because they don't want us having access to the technology they've already got.
[02:50:04.503 --> 02:50:08.404]  It's pure greed, it's out of control, and they will fail, thanks to you and many others.
[02:50:08.404 --> 02:50:09.205]  Thank you, Dr. Greer.
[02:50:09.205 --> 02:50:14.306]  Your film, You Donated to the World, is free at Band.Video, the featured video.
[02:50:14.306 --> 02:50:15.446]  I hope people get it and share it.
[02:50:15.446 --> 02:50:16.687]  Thank you, sir.
[02:50:16.687 --> 02:50:17.547]  Thank you very much.
[02:50:17.547 --> 02:50:18.527]  Appreciate your help.
[02:50:18.527 --> 02:50:18.967]  Thank you.
[02:50:18.967 --> 02:50:19.648]  Powerful.
[02:50:19.648 --> 02:50:20.588]  I hope he'll join us again.
[02:50:20.588 --> 02:50:21.288]  He said he will.
[02:50:21.288 --> 02:50:23.829]  We scheduled a whole hour commercial free.
[02:50:25.191 --> 02:50:30.032]  Okay, well, let's shift back to the forced inoculations and world government.
[02:50:30.032 --> 02:50:36.173]  When we come back, we'll jam in your calls in two segments, and then Gerald Celente is always ready to kick butt.
[02:50:36.173 --> 02:50:37.474]  He'll be taking over.
[02:50:37.474 --> 02:50:47.216]  Please briefly remember, the only way we get out of the box, that is, our hundreds of radio affiliates and TV stations, which are awesome, is you tell folks about those local stations and support them.
[02:50:49.266 --> 02:50:53.008]  If Local Station is sharing a feed of us, promote that on Facebook or Twitter.
[02:50:53.008 --> 02:50:54.528]  That's not going to get banned.
[02:50:54.528 --> 02:50:58.790]  Or share the live feeds from freeworldnews.tv.
[02:50:58.790 --> 02:51:02.072]  That URL is not being banned right now, freeworldnews.tv.
[02:51:02.072 --> 02:51:02.972]  Send them a live feed.
[02:51:02.972 --> 02:51:05.053]  Send them videos from that page.
[02:51:05.053 --> 02:51:08.534]  But whatever you do, speak up because that's your power.
[02:51:08.534 --> 02:51:09.595]  And you've been doing it.
[02:51:09.595 --> 02:51:10.295]  You've been doing it.
[02:51:10.295 --> 02:51:12.336]  Believe me, it's incredible.
[02:51:12.336 --> 02:51:14.217]  And so I just commit to you, I won't back down.
[02:51:15.276 --> 02:51:16.496]  I won't back down.
[02:51:16.496 --> 02:51:19.617]  And believe me, we're in very dangerous waters, but that's okay.
[02:51:19.617 --> 02:51:22.878]  Because I was born for this, and I'm not gonna falter now.
[02:51:22.878 --> 02:51:24.078]  In fact, I feel stronger than ever.
[02:51:24.078 --> 02:51:25.279]  It's a real blessing.
[02:51:25.279 --> 02:51:26.839]  So, thank you for all your prayers.
[02:51:26.839 --> 02:51:29.900]  We're gonna really try to see this through, but we're not gonna be arrogant about it.
[02:51:29.900 --> 02:51:32.701]  Because we are on the razor's edge right now.
[02:51:32.701 --> 02:51:35.541]  Like a snail, surviving on a straight razor.
[02:51:35.541 --> 02:51:37.202]  That's my dream.
[02:51:37.202 --> 02:51:38.002]  That's my nightmare.
[02:51:40.487 --> 02:51:44.189]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[02:51:44.189 --> 02:51:53.693]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the Western world.
[02:51:53.693 --> 02:52:00.356]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 20-20 prices.
[02:52:00.356 --> 02:52:03.898]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[02:52:03.898 --> 02:52:06.319]  Their entire catalog is at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:52:06.319 --> 02:52:09.220]  You get an additional 10% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:11.601]  But only for one more week.
[02:52:11.601 --> 02:52:15.103]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex, but that's it.
[02:52:15.103 --> 02:52:19.725]  They won't do this sale again until November, and then the food prices go up in 2022.
[02:52:19.725 --> 02:52:21.706]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:52:21.706 --> 02:52:28.909]  It's the highest quality, hundreds of high quality foods, three month, six month, your supplies, all ready for you at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[02:52:28.909 --> 02:52:31.611]  Again, InfoWarsTore.com, 10% off on high quality storable food, ready to ship.
[02:52:36.714 --> 02:52:40.170]  But it ends in just one week, so take action now while you still can!
[02:52:41.573 --> 02:52:43.153]  Gerald of South Carolina.
[02:52:43.153 --> 02:52:43.934]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:52:43.934 --> 02:52:44.654]  Trying to move quicker.
[02:52:44.654 --> 02:52:45.494]  Hey, Alex.
[02:52:45.494 --> 02:52:45.914]  Welcome.
[02:52:45.914 --> 02:52:51.095]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[02:52:51.095 --> 02:52:54.456]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[02:52:54.456 --> 02:53:00.917]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[02:53:00.917 --> 02:53:02.578]  Living Defense saved my life.
[02:53:02.578 --> 02:53:06.739]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[02:53:06.739 --> 02:53:08.179]  Living Defense brought me back.
[02:53:08.479 --> 02:53:13.982]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[02:53:13.982 --> 02:53:14.802]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[02:53:14.802 --> 02:53:16.543]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:38.593]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it.
[02:53:38.593 --> 02:53:44.617]  Because God created this country.
[02:53:44.617 --> 02:53:47.258]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:09.397 --> 02:54:13.478]  Hey, Obama's got that giant mansion in Martha's Vineyard.
[02:54:13.478 --> 02:54:18.220]  That's 700 people to attend his birthday party there.
[02:54:18.220 --> 02:54:19.320]  That's okay.
[02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:20.380]  He gets to, you don't though.
[02:54:20.380 --> 02:54:24.501]  You're gonna stay locked down and die.
[02:54:24.501 --> 02:54:25.802]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:54:25.802 --> 02:54:27.642]  I really appreciate folks holding.
[02:54:27.642 --> 02:54:29.863]  We had that very informative guest on.
[02:54:29.863 --> 02:54:32.484]  Let's just go in the order that these calls are received.
[02:54:32.484 --> 02:54:35.705]  The longest holding caller would be...
[02:54:37.793 --> 02:54:38.694]  Travis in Maine.
[02:54:38.694 --> 02:54:39.294]  Travis, go ahead.
[02:54:39.294 --> 02:54:40.835]  Thank you.
[02:54:40.835 --> 02:54:41.795]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:41.795 --> 02:54:55.483]  I just want to say I am really excited to see you guys putting Professor Peter Hotez up there on screen and that every Infra Warrior out there needs to get on the Twitter and look him up.
[02:54:55.483 --> 02:55:01.307]  It's at Peter Hotez and everything that he's saying right now is just on point.
[02:55:02.614 --> 02:55:07.658]  And you're talking about the head scientist at Baylor?
[02:55:07.658 --> 02:55:11.160]  The dean of... Yeah, guys, please try to get him on.
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:11.740]  Please get him on.
[02:55:11.740 --> 02:55:12.161]  Go ahead.
[02:55:12.161 --> 02:55:26.911]  He's a pediatrician and a vaccinologist, and everything that he is putting out there on Twitter right now, he's also showing up on all of... every news station that will have him.
[02:55:26.911 --> 02:55:31.254]  And he is talking nothing but truth, and every Infowarrior out there
[02:55:32.312 --> 02:55:35.273]  See him and hear him and know what's going on.
[02:55:35.273 --> 02:55:35.713]  I agree.
[02:55:35.713 --> 02:55:38.254]  Who knew he told Congress a year and a half ago what was going to happen?
[02:55:38.254 --> 02:55:39.614]  Wow!
[02:55:39.614 --> 02:55:43.855]  But what he's talking about now is even more powerful.
[02:55:43.855 --> 02:55:46.736]  Guys, print me that Twitter because I'm going to get all that info out.
[02:55:46.736 --> 02:55:48.576]  Yeah, we're working as hard as we can, brother.
[02:55:48.576 --> 02:55:51.057]  Thank you for telling me about that.
[02:55:51.057 --> 02:55:53.217]  Please continue.
[02:55:53.217 --> 02:56:00.079]  I just want to finish up with a plug and say that InfoWars Store sells products on the Internet and they cost money.
[02:56:00.079 --> 02:56:00.579]  Have a good day.
[02:56:01.493 --> 02:56:02.393]  Thank you so much, brother.
[02:56:02.393 --> 02:56:04.294]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:04.294 --> 02:56:06.075]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:56:06.075 --> 02:56:10.137]  Let's talk to Mel in Massachusetts.
[02:56:10.137 --> 02:56:13.658]  Go ahead.
[02:56:13.658 --> 02:56:14.078]  Hello?
[02:56:14.078 --> 02:56:14.899]  Hi, welcome.
[02:56:14.899 --> 02:56:15.439]  Alex?
[02:56:15.439 --> 02:56:15.899]  Yes, Mel.
[02:56:15.899 --> 02:56:18.200]  Hey.
[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:21.761]  First of all, I want to let you know that I just got to listen to you in May.
[02:56:21.761 --> 02:56:27.204]  And I want to thank you for everything, and I've been trying to share your information.
[02:56:31.542 --> 02:56:33.903]  What I was calling about is a couple of things.
[02:56:33.903 --> 02:56:44.545]  I do work in the healthcare field, and I'm not a nurse or a doctor, but I do work for a doctor.
[02:56:44.545 --> 02:56:53.107]  Whenever the vaccine came out, which I don't even remember because I surely was not taking it, he did take it.
[02:56:53.107 --> 02:56:54.007]  I believe he took it.
[02:56:54.007 --> 02:56:57.668]  They all were supposed to be taking it in my office.
[02:56:57.668 --> 02:56:58.808]  They were promoting it and stuff.
[02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:15.277]  Has been sick ever since and I'm not laughing about it, but I'm just saying he's been really really sick like coughing very Like a lung thing and um.
[02:57:15.277 --> 02:57:23.442]  Oh, yeah, it starts growing starts growing protein crystals in your lungs It's it's I mean and I even was like are you okay?
[02:57:23.442 --> 02:57:29.345]  And and he just keeps telling me he has allergies and now I've worked for him for four years, and I've never
[02:57:30.026 --> 02:57:32.108]  I've never seen him like this, ever.
[02:57:32.108 --> 02:57:36.491]  And, you know, one of the girls I work with also, we're both like, wow.
[02:57:36.491 --> 02:57:40.615]  And now, we're remote, so periodically I go in.
[02:57:40.615 --> 02:57:44.038]  And so, it's been going on for a few months.
[02:57:44.038 --> 02:57:46.099]  And so, that's one thing.
[02:57:46.099 --> 02:57:49.062]  And it's pretty bad.
[02:57:49.062 --> 02:57:50.223]  That was one thing.
[02:57:50.223 --> 02:57:54.006]  And the other is, you know, everyone in my family is getting it.
[02:57:54.006 --> 02:57:56.168]  And, you know, they can't believe I won't.
[02:57:56.536 --> 02:57:59.737]  And I'm not an anti-vaxxer, but this, there's no way I'm going there.
[02:57:59.737 --> 02:58:02.338]  Yeah, this is not a regular vaccine.
[02:58:02.338 --> 02:58:03.338]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:58:03.338 --> 02:58:05.799]  And I know.
[02:58:05.799 --> 02:58:10.340]  And so my niece got it, and she's 18.
[02:58:10.340 --> 02:58:14.921]  And within weeks, she was in the hospital with a kidney infection.
[02:58:14.921 --> 02:58:18.962]  Oh yeah, it really attacks the kidneys too, yeah.
[02:58:18.962 --> 02:58:22.923]  Yeah, so I mean, these are the things that I'm seeing over here too.
[02:58:22.923 --> 02:58:25.364]  But, I mean, I work in a hospital, and I
[02:58:26.590 --> 02:58:30.914]  Kind of like waiting for the time that they mandate it.
[02:58:30.914 --> 02:58:33.336]  Well Mel, just keep warning people like you're doing.
[02:58:33.336 --> 02:58:37.560]  You're an amazing person for speaking up and just God bless you and thank you for calling.
[02:58:37.560 --> 02:58:41.824]  It's your job to warn everybody you know and you're doing it right now so we salute you.
[02:58:41.824 --> 02:58:47.730]  All right, I can talk to her for 10 hours but we're gonna go to the next caller when we come back in 60 seconds and we're gonna go right to...
[02:58:49.151 --> 02:58:51.992]  A bunch of different callers, like James in Michigan.
[02:58:51.992 --> 02:58:58.073]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[02:58:58.073 --> 02:59:05.555]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[02:59:05.555 --> 02:59:07.876]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[02:59:07.876 --> 02:59:11.457]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.

[02:59:46.649 --> 02:59:48.610]  There is surreal footage right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:00:06.229 --> 03:00:14.354]  Thousands of people lined up to take their forced inoculations or their cell phones, which they get paid by in Pakistan, will be turned off.
[03:00:14.354 --> 03:00:18.696]  That is our future.
[03:00:18.696 --> 03:00:19.997]  Absolutely out of control.
[03:00:19.997 --> 03:00:27.521]  Yeah, we want to be angels, but the stars are so bright.
[03:00:27.521 --> 03:00:28.922]  You turn off the light.
[03:00:49.216 --> 03:00:53.438]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:00:53.438 --> 03:00:58.080]  The reason I'm reaching out today, I got a pretty nuanced scenario.
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:04.664]  So, regarding the vaccine, I'm a dad and I have a 6-year-old boy, a beautiful son I have.
[03:01:05.965 --> 03:01:06.466]  I think so.
[03:01:24.418 --> 03:01:32.482]  Um, I, I've been following all the COVID stuff very closely and just, just, uh, and so I, I'm a single dad, so I, I, I'm separated from his mother.
[03:01:32.482 --> 03:01:32.822]  Oh yeah.
[03:01:32.822 --> 03:01:37.864]  A lot of women and men who ever have custody, they run out and do it to mess with the other parent.
[03:01:37.864 --> 03:01:41.466]  It's, it's, it's a real Moonshausen by proxy.
[03:01:41.466 --> 03:01:41.986]  Exactly.
[03:01:41.986 --> 03:01:43.187]  I've been dealing with that.
[03:01:43.187 --> 03:01:47.609]  I ended up, I used to be on the left in Portland, uh, got her pregnant.
[03:01:47.609 --> 03:01:49.470]  She left, went back to Michigan.
[03:01:49.470 --> 03:01:52.411]  And so I moved across the country to be in his life, fought in court.
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:53.660]  I don't know.
[03:02:07.467 --> 03:02:14.492]  And so she, you know, she has her leftist ideas that she corrupts my son with and I have to do damage control and try and teach him how to...
[03:02:37.647 --> 03:02:39.088]  I'm sorry to hear that, brother.
[03:02:39.088 --> 03:02:40.949]  Did you have a question?
[03:02:40.949 --> 03:02:44.371]  Yeah, well, I mean, I just kind of wanted to say, like, you know, like, what should I do?
[03:02:44.371 --> 03:02:52.755]  Because I'm in a specific situation where I can't come to her and try and say that I'm against this because she'll use that in court to try and take my rights away, and I can't go forward.
[03:02:52.755 --> 03:02:56.457]  Well, I mean, listen, it's not been approved even in emergency use under 12-year-olds.
[03:02:57.463 --> 03:03:01.524]  And so I would just call an emergency TRO if you believe that's happened and bring that point up.
[03:03:01.524 --> 03:03:03.485]  But it's a complex issue, James.
[03:03:03.485 --> 03:03:05.505]  God bless you.
[03:03:05.505 --> 03:03:14.748]  There's a satanic spirit where women particularly take their sons to have their balls cut off or to be injected with poison or to be given Ritalin or Prozac.
[03:03:14.748 --> 03:03:18.049]  And it's, Christ said, suffer the little children.
[03:03:18.049 --> 03:03:20.630]  It's predominantly women doing it, but some men do it as well.
[03:03:20.630 --> 03:03:23.351]  And it's just Stockholm Syndrome.
[03:03:23.351 --> 03:03:24.251]  I'm very, very sorry.
[03:03:25.606 --> 03:03:29.448]  But some women like to get pimped, and they like to pimp their children.
[03:03:29.448 --> 03:03:31.748]  They like to get hurt and hurt bad, and the system will hurt them.
[03:03:31.748 --> 03:03:33.049]  That's what they're looking for.
[03:03:33.049 --> 03:03:36.150]  All right, let's go ahead and make another call here.
[03:03:36.150 --> 03:03:38.191]  Let's go ahead and talk to JD in Indiana.
[03:03:38.191 --> 03:03:40.832]  JD, thanks for calling.
[03:03:40.832 --> 03:03:42.453]  How's your day going today, Alex?
[03:03:42.453 --> 03:03:43.033]  I'm all right, brother.
[03:03:43.033 --> 03:03:44.293]  Go ahead.
[03:03:44.293 --> 03:03:46.915]  I'm calling because I'm extremely angry today.
[03:03:46.915 --> 03:03:52.917]  My sister actually had surgery today on a month long of a process that I've watched.
[03:03:53.670 --> 03:04:04.596]  Where she went from being forced to take a shot, or she was going to be fired, into a couple days later bruises all over her body.
[03:04:04.596 --> 03:04:05.897]  Huge bruises.
[03:04:05.897 --> 03:04:07.058]  Yeah, that's blood clots.
[03:04:07.058 --> 03:04:10.019]  That's blood clots in the capillaries.
[03:04:10.019 --> 03:04:12.661]  Yeah, and today she had surgery on her uterus.
[03:04:13.402 --> 03:04:17.823]  Because she had polyps and other things developing in and around her uterus.
[03:04:17.823 --> 03:04:19.804]  And it's absolutely terrible because this is my sister that I love.
[03:04:19.804 --> 03:04:22.784]  And at the end of the day, it's like she was forced into this.
[03:04:22.784 --> 03:04:27.906]  And at the end of the day... What type of piece of crap place does she work?
[03:04:27.906 --> 03:04:28.886]  She works in a nursing home.
[03:04:41.653 --> 03:04:44.435]  And wouldn't it be better?
[03:04:44.435 --> 03:04:49.599]  Have you seen the literature where they admit it attacks their uterus and grows these polyps?
[03:04:49.599 --> 03:04:53.082]  Well, I hope people are listening because it's happening right now.
[03:04:53.082 --> 03:04:56.945]  They said, don't worry when you grow tumors, those aren't bad.
[03:04:56.945 --> 03:04:59.446]  But really, they go to the doctor, they go, no, it's cancer.
[03:04:59.446 --> 03:05:02.729]  See how sick that is?
[03:05:02.729 --> 03:05:05.791]  And I'm absolutely angry about it because it's happening to my blood.
[03:05:05.791 --> 03:05:06.692]  It's happening today.
[03:05:08.084 --> 03:05:10.426]  And it's so, please, out there, please listen to Alex.
[03:05:24.428 --> 03:05:25.548]  We have to start standing up.
[03:05:25.548 --> 03:05:26.969]  We have to do what you're saying.
[03:05:26.969 --> 03:05:28.470]  We have to start in our communities.
[03:05:28.470 --> 03:05:32.551]  We have to start reaching out to people and standing up and protesting.
[03:05:47.293 --> 03:05:49.214]  I'm not 100% on what she took.
[03:05:49.214 --> 03:05:52.235]  She's actually in the hospital in recovery.
[03:06:13.410 --> 03:06:14.211]  Alright, brother.
[03:06:14.211 --> 03:06:15.232]  JD, we love you.
[03:06:15.232 --> 03:06:16.493]  Call back, give us an update.
[03:06:16.493 --> 03:06:17.594]  Geez.
[03:06:17.594 --> 03:06:18.975]  Oh, I didn't know this caller was from France.
[03:06:18.975 --> 03:06:19.495]  I apologize.
[03:06:19.495 --> 03:06:20.696]  We've gone to you early.
[03:06:20.696 --> 03:06:21.617]  Deborah in France.
[03:06:21.617 --> 03:06:22.157]  You're on the air.
[03:06:22.157 --> 03:06:22.518]  Go ahead.
[03:06:22.518 --> 03:06:24.059]  Hi there.
[03:06:24.059 --> 03:06:25.120]  Can you hear me?
[03:06:25.120 --> 03:06:25.460]  I can.
[03:06:25.460 --> 03:06:26.001]  Thanks for holding.
[03:06:26.001 --> 03:06:28.142]  I apologize for making you hold for so long.
[03:06:28.142 --> 03:06:28.983]  Go ahead.
[03:06:28.983 --> 03:06:29.644]  Not a problem.
[03:06:29.644 --> 03:06:34.187]  I just wanted to call and update people on what's happening here, because the media is clearly not covering this.
[03:06:34.187 --> 03:06:36.790]  Yeah, millions of people are on the streets, aren't they?
[03:06:36.790 --> 03:06:37.590]  Millions of people.
[03:06:37.590 --> 03:06:40.072]  So, last number I heard last weekend was 8 million.
[03:06:40.072 --> 03:06:41.774]  The official numbers are 6 and a half, but
[03:06:42.205 --> 03:06:45.366]  Prior to the six and a half million, they said it was a couple hundred thousand, just like that.
[03:06:45.366 --> 03:06:48.626]  Like, BFM TV is basically Macron's, like, CNN.
[03:06:48.626 --> 03:06:55.027]  So, um, they just kind of block for him and they just kind of, they, they label anti-vax protesters and say, these are just a bunch of crazy people.
[03:06:55.027 --> 03:07:01.829]  But, uh, in reality, it's unifying a lot of people in France and they're, uh, coming together to march.
[03:07:01.829 --> 03:07:03.049]  I mean, there's like, like millions of people.
[03:07:03.049 --> 03:07:06.889]  There's three times as many people in the streets now that there were three weeks ago.
[03:07:06.889 --> 03:07:10.090]  Um, and I think the eye-opening thing for me this weekend was,
[03:07:10.669 --> 03:07:25.475]  The day after all these protests on Saturday, the very first headline that pops up at 8 in the morning is the head of the hospital union pushing and calling for mandatory, obligatory vaccination for the entire population because we can't possibly withstand a fourth wave coming in.
[03:07:25.475 --> 03:07:31.398]  And that's basically like their response to the 8 million people who descended in the streets, which is
[03:07:32.478 --> 03:07:33.539]  Six to eight million.
[03:07:33.539 --> 03:07:36.980]  Well, I think it's time for people to start marching on the government buildings.
[03:07:36.980 --> 03:07:44.503]  Those governments are eugenics-based, they are attacking people in violation of the Nuremberg Code, and they are assaulting you with an experimental deadly shot.
[03:07:44.503 --> 03:07:48.524]  I mean, where do you think France goes from here?
[03:07:48.524 --> 03:07:52.866]  Right now, honestly, I've been saying for months that they were gunning for us for the fall for more lockdowns.
[03:07:52.866 --> 03:07:59.549]  We had three lockdowns in a year, and honestly, I'm looking to leave the country as soon as possible.
[03:08:00.307 --> 03:08:09.273]  I'm here with my kids and I don't feel safe because with what they're doing now, they implemented a mandate on the vaccine passports a few weeks ago and that's what the protests are against, are just the passports.
[03:08:09.273 --> 03:08:13.536]  But now they're calling to replace the vaccine passports with vaccine cards.
[03:08:13.536 --> 03:08:20.301]  So the passports right now allow you to have supposedly a PCR test every 24 hours if you'd like to go out in public and socialize with any humans.
[03:08:21.099 --> 03:08:25.140]  Otherwise, they're calling for those to be replaced by vaccination card certifications.
[03:08:25.140 --> 03:08:26.220]  So, basically, you can't... You're right.
[03:08:26.220 --> 03:08:30.361]  We are literally seeing the formation of a prison planet.
[03:08:30.361 --> 03:08:33.322]  Everything we foretold, it's now being launched.
[03:08:33.322 --> 03:08:42.483]  And instead of, like, arguing, this is wrong, you're lying about the numbers, it needs to be, you're globalists setting up worldwide martial law, you need to be arrested.
[03:08:42.483 --> 03:08:48.585]  And the people that launched this ran the Wuhan lab, Bill Gates and, of course, Fauci, the demon.
[03:08:48.585 --> 03:08:49.965]  Well, good luck with your children.
[03:08:50.365 --> 03:08:51.626]  Uh, and you're an amazing lady.
[03:08:51.626 --> 03:08:58.169]  Everybody's amazing that cares about truth and justice and people that have children are so special and the enemy hates that.
[03:08:58.169 --> 03:09:00.230]  Thank you so much for calling.
[03:09:00.230 --> 03:09:05.173]  Look, I got, I got Gerald Solimte set to take over and I'm not going to cut into him anymore.
[03:09:05.173 --> 03:09:07.114]  But if Asha, who's held so long.
[03:09:08.183 --> 03:09:10.804]  We'll be our first caller tomorrow on a stack of Bibles, guys.
[03:09:10.804 --> 03:09:12.005]  Call Asha.
[03:09:12.005 --> 03:09:14.065]  Instead of getting three minutes, they'll get ten minutes.
[03:09:14.065 --> 03:09:15.366]  Same with Jay and Jill.
[03:09:15.366 --> 03:09:21.768]  If you'll just all let us call you at 11.30 tomorrow, 30 minutes of the show, I will open the phones up then and take these three callers.
[03:09:21.768 --> 03:09:23.149]  Because I've got to get to Gerald Celente.
[03:09:23.149 --> 03:09:25.110]  He's got a lot to cover, Trends Forecaster.
[03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:28.751]  Then the War Room today, 3 to 6 p.m., coming up after that.
[03:09:28.751 --> 03:09:31.032]  Wow, I covered a lot of it, but so much we didn't get to.
[03:09:31.032 --> 03:09:33.253]  I mean, this is just bonkers!
[03:09:33.253 --> 03:09:35.154]  At least it's all out in the open now.
[03:09:36.004 --> 03:09:36.985]  You want a straight-up fight?
[03:09:36.985 --> 03:09:38.887]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've got one.
[03:09:38.887 --> 03:09:43.050]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates are literally coming at you with a bio-weapon.
[03:09:43.050 --> 03:09:44.231]  Gosh almighty.
[03:09:44.231 --> 03:09:46.553]  And they're censoring all the medical doctors exposing it.
[03:09:46.553 --> 03:09:47.114]  We'll be right back.
[03:09:47.114 --> 03:09:47.454]  Stay with us.
[03:09:50.250 --> 03:09:56.332]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[03:09:56.332 --> 03:10:03.834]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[03:10:03.834 --> 03:10:06.134]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[03:10:06.134 --> 03:10:09.716]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[03:10:11.636 --> 03:10:19.818]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[03:10:19.818 --> 03:10:25.720]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[03:10:25.720 --> 03:10:36.443]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[03:10:36.443 --> 03:10:37.724]  Thank you and God bless.
[03:10:38.484 --> 03:10:49.771]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[03:10:49.771 --> 03:10:58.277]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:10:58.277 --> 03:11:02.820]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers, and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[03:11:03.280 --> 03:11:08.864]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:11:08.864 --> 03:11:11.766]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[03:11:11.766 --> 03:11:12.947]  Listen to this.
[03:11:12.947 --> 03:11:23.134]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[03:11:23.134 --> 03:11:26.577]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[03:11:26.577 --> 03:11:27.838]  Just one of these ingredients
[03:11:28.098 --> 03:11:29.358]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:12:24.690 --> 03:12:31.672]  We have made the deliberate decision to temporarily enhance police officers' authority for the duration of the stay-at-home order.
[03:12:32.611 --> 03:12:46.195]  Moving forward, police will have the authority to require any individual who is not in a place of residence to first provide their purpose for not being at home and provide their home address.
[03:12:46.195 --> 03:12:53.577]  Police will also have the authority to stop a vehicle to inquire about an individual's reason for leaving their residence.
[03:12:53.577 --> 03:12:57.698]  Stay home, keep your distance, or now pay the price.
[03:12:59.107 --> 03:13:07.073]  Police with axes and assault rifles raided this venue in Sao Paulo and found about 600 party goers, most without masks.
[03:13:07.073 --> 03:13:11.136]  It was a case of asking people to go home, and if they didn't, arresting them.
[03:13:11.136 --> 03:13:19.242]  Nine police checkpoints have now been set up around the perimeter of Auckland as its 1.6 million residents return to Level 3 lockdown.
[03:13:19.242 --> 03:13:24.966]  This is the video that raised questions about how New York City is enforcing social distancing.
[03:13:24.966 --> 03:13:27.988]  The man was handcuffed in the stands for not wearing a mask.
[03:13:28.368 --> 03:13:35.174]  Disturbing video showing a violent clash between apparent social distancing violators and police in Brooklyn.
[03:13:35.174 --> 03:13:44.102]  And this cell phone video capturing the moment an officer waves a taser and repeatedly strikes a bystander during a social distancing bust.
[03:13:44.102 --> 03:13:46.043]  Get your hands off of me!
[03:13:46.043 --> 03:13:47.325]  You are kidnapping me!
[03:13:47.325 --> 03:13:48.766]  I have done nothing illegal!
[03:13:54.656 --> 03:14:01.203]  Canadians are being hit with penalties now as governments move to reinforce the shutdowns right across the country.
[03:14:01.203 --> 03:14:03.846]  And the city is also taking their mask mandate seriously.
[03:14:03.846 --> 03:14:10.233]  A fire rescue commissioner from the Tampa area was arrested on Duval Street Wednesday night when he and others were spotted without masks.
[03:14:10.333 --> 03:14:18.461]  It's more than just a suggestion, it is a CDC recommendation that it's all become sort of like lock law that you can't really trifle with.
[03:14:18.461 --> 03:14:26.588]  Ladies and gentlemen, this gathering is unfortunately unlawful under the coronavirus regulations we have currently.
[03:14:31.078 --> 03:14:39.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, and now we've got him, Gerald Cilente, the Trends Forecaster, on August 2nd, on this Monday transmission.
[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:41.481]  Gerald Cilente.
[03:14:41.481 --> 03:14:43.621]  Hey, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[03:14:43.621 --> 03:14:46.622]  This is very heartbreaking, what's going on.
[03:14:46.622 --> 03:14:55.844]  And those videos that they were just showing, they just had protests in Germany this past weekend.
[03:14:55.844 --> 03:14:59.265]  And you see the police beating up people, beating up little kids.
[03:15:00.728 --> 03:15:03.690]  Pushing and punching women.
[03:15:03.690 --> 03:15:06.432]  These little boys.
[03:15:06.432 --> 03:15:06.992]  What is this?
[03:15:06.992 --> 03:15:09.614]  The Third Reich is back?
[03:15:09.614 --> 03:15:13.036]  And you know, this is what we wrote about in the Trends Journal.
[03:15:13.036 --> 03:15:15.177]  The new one's coming out this week.
[03:15:15.177 --> 03:15:16.058]  Knock, knock.
[03:15:16.058 --> 03:15:18.699]  It's the COVID police.
[03:15:18.699 --> 03:15:22.041]  Death camps next?
[03:15:22.041 --> 03:15:25.624]  And we go on to write about how in New South Wales they have
[03:15:26.581 --> 03:15:34.687]  The police and army are knocking at the doors of homes to make sure there's nobody inside the property who should not be there.
[03:15:34.687 --> 03:15:41.412]  And helicopters are flying across the region to make sure no one is breaking the rules.
[03:15:41.412 --> 03:15:53.942]  And they just announced that some 300 ADF troops joined the North-South Wales COVID cops patrolling the streets and knocking on doors.
[03:15:53.942 --> 03:15:55.163]  What kind of world is this?
[03:15:56.380 --> 03:16:00.261]  Are death camps next?
[03:16:00.261 --> 03:16:06.924]  And I don't say this in a way that's, you know, oh my God, how could you say that?
[03:16:06.924 --> 03:16:10.505]  Go back to New South Wales.
[03:16:10.505 --> 03:16:23.830]  First of all, you got this stupid freak that's been jerking around, whatever her name is, Gladys, been jerking, you know, off down there in Australia, putting out these mandates,
[03:16:27.355 --> 03:16:36.722]  So far, out of New South Wales, I said North, New South Wales, 8.1 million people.
[03:16:36.722 --> 03:16:40.845]  8.1 million people.
[03:16:40.845 --> 03:16:48.391]  Since mid-June, when they began this whole lockdown craziness again, the grand total of 3,427 cases.
[03:16:48.391 --> 03:16:49.592]  Look at the headline.
[03:16:55.862 --> 03:17:00.685]  Extends mass mandate for Sydney as COVID clusters grow.
[03:17:00.685 --> 03:17:01.786]  A cluster?
[03:17:01.786 --> 03:17:03.127]  How about a cluster FU?
[03:17:03.127 --> 03:17:04.087]  You know what?
[03:17:04.087 --> 03:17:06.149]  Yeah, remember those kind of clusters.
[03:17:06.149 --> 03:17:08.210]  Yeah, because that's what this is.
[03:17:08.210 --> 03:17:14.434]  This is a cluster F. You ready?
[03:17:14.434 --> 03:17:21.198]  Since the COVID war began, 19 months ago, out of those 8.1 million people,
[03:17:23.590 --> 03:17:24.931]  Look at these little boys.
[03:17:24.931 --> 03:17:26.312]  Look at these little boys.
[03:17:26.312 --> 03:17:36.080]  You get these guys man-to-man, one-on-one, and, man, you could bring these little low-life pieces of crap down.
[03:17:36.080 --> 03:17:37.841]  Look what they do!
[03:17:37.841 --> 03:17:40.163]  Anyway, you ready?
[03:17:40.163 --> 03:17:42.445]  19 months.
[03:17:42.445 --> 03:17:46.548]  You know how many people died?
[03:17:46.548 --> 03:17:46.568]  69.
[03:17:46.568 --> 03:17:48.489]  69 people died.
[03:17:55.094 --> 03:18:09.803]  And since last, since January 2020, this is, this is outrageous.
[03:18:09.803 --> 03:18:17.208]  Oh, and now with the new cluster, the cases, 3,427 cases reported since mid-June, a month and a half ago.
[03:18:24.818 --> 03:18:35.845]  Out of those 3,427 cases, about six people died.
[03:18:35.845 --> 03:18:37.125]  And you know what the latest one was?
[03:18:37.125 --> 03:18:41.088]  This is the headline, according to the New Daily.
[03:18:41.088 --> 03:18:43.469]  The latest was a man in his 90s.
[03:18:43.469 --> 03:18:44.570]  Oh yeah?
[03:18:44.570 --> 03:18:45.330]  A man in his 90s.
[03:18:45.330 --> 03:18:46.091]  He's gonna live to 99 and a half.
[03:18:46.091 --> 03:18:46.651]  But the COVID got him.
[03:18:51.855 --> 03:18:53.396]  Maybe the COVID didn't get him.
[03:18:53.396 --> 03:18:53.836]  Look at this.
[03:18:53.836 --> 03:18:55.377]  Look at this.
[03:18:55.377 --> 03:18:56.658]  Look at this.
[03:18:56.658 --> 03:18:58.879]  Look at this.
[03:18:58.879 --> 03:19:01.560]  Look at this.
[03:19:01.560 --> 03:19:03.401]  Look at these little boys.
[03:19:03.401 --> 03:19:05.002]  Look how tough they are.
[03:19:05.002 --> 03:19:06.623]  Come and do that to me!
[03:19:06.623 --> 03:19:08.004]  Come and do that to me!
[03:19:09.255 --> 03:19:10.896]  You little clown!
[03:19:10.896 --> 03:19:12.737]  You're all by yourself!
[03:19:12.737 --> 03:19:15.199]  Don't bring your other little flunkies around!
[03:19:15.199 --> 03:19:18.701]  You little guys with cojones smaller than a mothball!
[03:19:18.701 --> 03:19:21.383]  You little disgusting human beings!
[03:19:21.383 --> 03:19:24.144]  We are going into the Third Reich!
[03:19:24.144 --> 03:19:25.105]  Around the world!
[03:19:27.796 --> 03:19:34.861]  Yeah, the guy in his 90s that died, he just got the AstraZeneca shot.
[03:19:34.861 --> 03:19:41.245]  The AstraZeneca shot that they're promoting in Australia.
[03:19:41.245 --> 03:19:43.527]  Look at these guys!
[03:19:43.527 --> 03:19:44.828]  Look at them!
[03:19:44.828 --> 03:19:46.289]  Artoon!
[03:19:46.289 --> 03:19:51.953]  You little Nazi slime balls!
[03:19:51.953 --> 03:19:54.054]  Look at them!
[03:19:54.054 --> 03:19:54.635]  Look at them!
[03:19:56.604 --> 03:20:00.805]  For breaking the COVID rules!
[03:20:00.805 --> 03:20:04.506]  Look at them!
[03:20:04.506 --> 03:20:12.848]  If we don't fight for freedom, it's all aboard next train to Auschwitz!
[03:20:12.848 --> 03:20:22.331]  And you got these slime balls like this Piers Morgan flabby-faced freak!
[03:20:22.331 --> 03:20:23.811]  Oh, don't get angry, Solenti!
[03:20:26.991 --> 03:20:28.872]  Follow the orders!
[03:20:28.872 --> 03:20:32.613]  Get on board!
[03:20:32.613 --> 03:20:45.436]  That little boy, that little slobby, freaky-faced Piers Morgan, calling everybody a little P... Yeah.
[03:20:45.436 --> 03:20:47.797]  That won't get to vaccinate.
[03:20:47.797 --> 03:20:48.497]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:49.414 --> 03:21:03.265]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[03:21:03.265 --> 03:21:08.629]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:21:08.629 --> 03:21:09.310]  But it's true.
[03:21:09.310 --> 03:21:12.733]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:21:13.453 --> 03:21:15.956]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[03:21:15.956 --> 03:21:18.018]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[03:21:18.018 --> 03:21:19.780]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[03:21:19.780 --> 03:21:20.661]  And we're still here.
[03:21:20.661 --> 03:21:25.085]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility's going up.
[03:21:25.085 --> 03:21:26.707]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:21:26.707 --> 03:21:28.829]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:21:28.829 --> 03:21:32.633]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America's still quasi-free.
[03:21:33.234 --> 03:21:38.341]  You can't have InfoWars, it's been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:21:38.341 --> 03:21:40.443]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:21:40.443 --> 03:21:46.591]  So thank you all, and get into InfoWarshow.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.
[03:21:46.591 --> 03:21:48.353]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWars.
[03:21:48.353 --> 03:21:48.614]  Thank you.
[03:21:50.865 --> 03:22:01.216]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, and that it's criminals are extremely pathological.
[03:22:01.216 --> 03:22:04.740]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[03:22:04.740 --> 03:22:09.185]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[03:22:10.356 --> 03:22:11.177]  Well guess what?
[03:22:11.177 --> 03:22:25.165]  It was Anthony Fauci and eugenicists globalists that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[03:22:26.366 --> 03:22:31.870]  ...of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[03:22:31.870 --> 03:22:38.214]  The problem for them was, the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[03:22:38.214 --> 03:22:47.521]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[03:22:47.521 --> 03:22:48.582]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:22:51.041 --> 03:23:05.759]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[03:23:06.400 --> 03:23:14.583]  Being given free will, being given consciousness, is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[03:23:14.583 --> 03:23:31.230]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[03:23:31.230 --> 03:23:34.671]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[03:23:35.251 --> 03:23:36.693]  So don't worship the globalists.
[03:23:36.693 --> 03:23:38.355]  Don't worship the NFL.
[03:23:38.355 --> 03:23:40.217]  Don't worship all the things of the system.
[03:23:40.217 --> 03:23:41.979]  But worship the things of God.
[03:23:41.979 --> 03:23:43.661]  Because we're made by God.
[03:23:43.661 --> 03:23:45.343]  And appreciate your consciousness.
[03:23:45.343 --> 03:23:46.824]  And appreciate free speech.
[03:23:46.824 --> 03:23:47.986]  While you still have it.
[03:23:47.986 --> 03:23:48.767]  While you still have it.
[03:23:50.270 --> 03:23:55.852]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[03:23:55.852 --> 03:24:03.854]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[03:24:03.854 --> 03:24:06.154]  Well, it's all come down to this.

[03:24:36.466 --> 03:24:37.727]  Thank you and God bless.

[03:24:44.950 --> 03:24:46.750]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:25:12.805 --> 03:25:14.726]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:25:14.726 --> 03:25:26.051]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilenti.
[03:25:26.051 --> 03:25:29.072]  Hey, it's great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:25:29.072 --> 03:25:30.532]  I'm very upset.
[03:25:30.532 --> 03:25:33.033]  I'm a visionary.
[03:25:33.033 --> 03:25:37.735]  I've written the books Trends 2000, Trend Tracking, Far Better Than Megatrends, Time Magazine.
[03:25:37.735 --> 03:25:40.236]  I've been publishing the Trends Journal since 1991.
[03:25:42.591 --> 03:25:44.633]  Trends Research Institute since 1981.
[03:25:44.633 --> 03:25:48.656]  I'll put my track record up against anybody in the world.
[03:25:48.656 --> 03:25:51.698]  Show me what you've done and we can start talking.
[03:25:51.698 --> 03:25:53.680]  I see the future.
[03:25:53.680 --> 03:25:56.682]  And the future is hell on earth.
[03:25:56.682 --> 03:25:59.825]  I was talking about Australia.
[03:25:59.825 --> 03:26:02.107]  They got these little clowns.
[03:26:02.107 --> 03:26:02.687]  Look at this.
[03:26:02.687 --> 03:26:06.190]  Look at the look at the look at the clown show.
[03:26:07.145 --> 03:26:09.206]  Oh, the woman that's the premier.
[03:26:09.206 --> 03:26:11.908]  And by the way, the word premier, look at it.
[03:26:11.908 --> 03:26:12.668]  There she is.
[03:26:12.668 --> 03:26:14.909]  Gladys been jerking around.
[03:26:14.909 --> 03:26:19.592]  And look at the little jerk behind her with a mask on.
[03:26:19.592 --> 03:26:22.133]  Wait, what are you doing standing up there?
[03:26:22.133 --> 03:26:24.375]  She can't stand by herself.
[03:26:24.375 --> 03:26:25.755]  They all do this.
[03:26:25.755 --> 03:26:28.337]  It's a flunky freak show.
[03:26:29.386 --> 03:26:31.248]  Who's your favorite flunky?
[03:26:31.248 --> 03:26:35.291]  Hey, all you repulsive kids, you like Mitch McConnell?
[03:26:35.291 --> 03:26:37.232]  Oh, there's a brilliant looking dude.
[03:26:37.232 --> 03:26:38.373]  How about Lindsey?
[03:26:38.373 --> 03:26:41.556]  Did you come out of the closet yet, Graham?
[03:26:41.556 --> 03:26:43.037]  No, no, no!
[03:26:43.037 --> 03:26:44.919]  I'm a dumbo crap!
[03:26:44.919 --> 03:26:47.501]  I like little Chucky Shuma!
[03:26:48.346 --> 03:26:51.467]  No, no, Diane, not so Feinstein.
[03:26:51.467 --> 03:26:58.349]  She's my kind of person that I would bow down to and take any crap that she spews out.
[03:26:58.349 --> 03:26:59.970]  How about B.S.
[03:26:59.970 --> 03:27:02.111]  Biden?
[03:27:02.111 --> 03:27:05.152]  No, no, no, I like little Katson Macron.
[03:27:05.152 --> 03:27:06.752]  I'm from France.
[03:27:06.752 --> 03:27:10.594]  A little droggy, the bangster in Italy.
[03:27:10.594 --> 03:27:12.194]  Get it, everybody.
[03:27:12.194 --> 03:27:15.095]  Get it in your head.
[03:27:15.095 --> 03:27:16.996]  We've been taken over.
[03:27:16.996 --> 03:27:17.396]  Look at this.
[03:27:19.159 --> 03:27:21.039]  Ah, Germany?
[03:27:21.039 --> 03:27:21.600]  Here you go.
[03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:25.160]  This is coming out in the Trends Journal.
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:26.140]  Where do we go here?
[03:27:26.140 --> 03:27:27.421]  Okay.
[03:27:27.421 --> 03:27:30.501]  Over the weekend, there were anti-lockdown protests in Europe.
[03:27:30.501 --> 03:27:40.503]  As we noted in this Trends Journal, the rough, tough, heavily armed German COVID cops beat up little kids and women in Germany for not obeying COVID war rules.
[03:27:40.503 --> 03:27:48.005]  Indeed, as we noted in our 13th December Trends Journal, under the auspices of fighting the COVID war,
[03:27:48.909 --> 03:27:53.714]  Germany has re-imposed Third Reich rules.
[03:27:53.714 --> 03:28:02.083]  We wrote, quote, look at this, look at this, look at that, look at this, look at this, hitting little kids.
[03:28:03.394 --> 03:28:12.140]  I would love, I would love for one of these guys, I don't care how big you are, who you think you are, you come after me man to man, I will, I will.
[03:28:12.140 --> 03:28:14.922]  You try to kill me, I'll kill you first.
[03:28:14.922 --> 03:28:15.902]  That's right.
[03:28:15.902 --> 03:28:17.543]  I attack the attacker.
[03:28:17.543 --> 03:28:20.965]  Look at him, look at him, look what they're doing.
[03:28:20.965 --> 03:28:22.406]  Look at this.
[03:28:22.406 --> 03:28:24.067]  Anyway, going back.
[03:28:24.067 --> 03:28:30.492]  It's past November, several thousand Germans took to the street in Berlin in protest of the new, you ready?
[03:28:30.492 --> 03:28:32.513]  Infection protection law!
[03:28:33.550 --> 03:28:37.012]  Approved by the Parliament, which gives the Chancellor.
[03:28:37.012 --> 03:28:38.653]  That's a dirty word.
[03:28:38.653 --> 03:28:40.134]  That's a curse word.
[03:28:40.134 --> 03:28:49.639]  Calling some scumbags Chancellors, Prime Ministers, Presidents.
[03:28:49.639 --> 03:28:50.880]  Look at this.
[03:28:50.880 --> 03:28:52.421]  Those are curse words.
[03:28:52.421 --> 03:28:53.562]  That's profanity.
[03:28:53.562 --> 03:28:54.822]  Oh, a dignitary?
[03:28:54.822 --> 03:28:57.244]  Yeah, F you, dignitary.
[03:28:57.244 --> 03:28:57.584]  Anyway.
[03:29:01.488 --> 03:29:13.252]  The protesters compared the new law to the Enabling Act of 1933, which gave Adolf Hitler the right of dictatorship over the country.
[03:29:13.252 --> 03:29:26.597]  And our trend forecast, again, is witnessed by the brutality of the COVID cops in Germany and other nations, and the authoritarian, draconian lockdown orders imposed by the world's rulers, which they are enforcing.
[03:29:27.443 --> 03:29:43.892]  Should the COVID war continue to escalate, the battle for freedom, peace and justice will descend into a war between the people and the state, with those not supporting the governments sent to reform camps.
[03:29:43.892 --> 03:29:50.096]  And then we go on to write, indeed, World War II and the concentration camps are not ancient history.
[03:29:50.740 --> 03:29:53.641]  The horrors of war are alive and well.
[03:29:53.641 --> 03:29:58.483]  This was reported Sunday in DW News.
[03:29:58.483 --> 03:30:04.345]  Europe remembers Sinti Roma murdered under Nazi rule.
[03:30:04.345 --> 03:30:05.466]  On August 2nd, 1944, all right?
[03:30:05.466 --> 03:30:06.766]  1944 is not ancient history.
[03:30:06.766 --> 03:30:08.327]  I'm born in 46, okay?
[03:30:08.327 --> 03:30:09.627]  This isn't ancient history.
[03:30:15.895 --> 03:30:24.340]  4,300 Sinti and Roma were killed in gas chambers of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp.
[03:30:24.340 --> 03:30:28.822]  Genocide survivors describe the horrors.
[03:30:28.822 --> 03:30:34.706]  Dear Benetta, I have to tell you that my two youngest children have died.
[03:30:34.706 --> 03:30:44.211]  Those words were written, ah, this is heartbreaking, by Marguerite Bamberg in 1943, letter to a sister in Berlin.
[03:30:45.979 --> 03:30:52.881]  It was smuggled out of what was known as the Gypsy Camp at the Aoist Birkenau Concentration Camps.
[03:30:52.881 --> 03:30:55.482]  This isn't ancient history!
[03:30:55.482 --> 03:30:58.883]  Don't you see what's going on?
[03:30:58.883 --> 03:31:01.124]  Don't you see what's going on?
[03:31:01.124 --> 03:31:05.105]  It's them against us, and look at the them!
[03:31:05.105 --> 03:31:11.067]  Look at that flabby-faced piece of crap!
[03:31:11.067 --> 03:31:13.708]  Stupid, imbecilic moron!
[03:31:14.463 --> 03:31:18.266]  Piers Morgan, this clown is all over the news.
[03:31:18.266 --> 03:31:20.048]  Look at this guy.
[03:31:20.048 --> 03:31:31.098]  Who would believe a thing that comes out of that fat, flabby-faced, scum-looking creep?
[03:31:31.098 --> 03:31:33.420]  This is what's doing it to us.
[03:31:33.420 --> 03:31:35.482]  Here.
[03:31:35.482 --> 03:31:36.483]  This is what he says.
[03:31:38.908 --> 03:31:43.652]  Here's Morgan who got two jabs, this is what we write in the Trends Journal, of the AstraZeneca jab.
[03:31:43.652 --> 03:32:00.728]  The AstraZeneca jab that they have banned in Norway and Switzerland, and this clown-jerk little piece of scum over there in Australia, down in New South Wales, the guy's name is perfect for it.
[03:32:01.365 --> 03:32:05.028]  He's the chief medical officer, Michael Kidd.
[03:32:05.028 --> 03:32:05.989]  All right?
[03:32:05.989 --> 03:32:07.070]  Michael Kidd!
[03:32:07.070 --> 03:32:08.291]  Are you kidding me?
[03:32:08.291 --> 03:32:10.432]  A little piece of jerk!
[03:32:10.432 --> 03:32:21.821]  He goes on to say that the benefits of the COVID-19 AstraZeneca are greater than the risks of the rare effects concerning in all age groups.
[03:32:21.821 --> 03:32:23.243]  All right?
[03:32:23.243 --> 03:32:25.284]  Look at this.
[03:32:25.284 --> 03:32:27.206]  These are clowns that are telling us what to do.
[03:32:30.811 --> 03:32:33.815]  AstraZeneca!
[03:32:33.815 --> 03:32:44.529]  Flabby-faced, fat boy, pot-bellied peers got the AstraZeneca two jabs and got it again!
[03:32:45.413 --> 03:32:47.094]  They're not working.
[03:32:47.094 --> 03:32:58.161]  Yesterday, on Face the Nation, the health minister from Israel said they're, and they gave them the Pfizer injections, they're 50% accurate.
[03:32:58.161 --> 03:33:00.102]  And that's just now.
[03:33:00.102 --> 03:33:02.544]  And what are they doing to our bodies?
[03:33:02.544 --> 03:33:04.906]  Why you shut up, Solenti!
[03:33:04.906 --> 03:33:09.348]  You will go to jail!
[03:33:09.348 --> 03:33:14.692]  He doesn't believe Piers Morgan and all that little, who's that other little guy?
[03:33:15.072 --> 03:33:16.875]  Pencil steel!
[03:33:16.875 --> 03:33:20.520]  Pencil penis steel!
[03:33:20.520 --> 03:33:22.463]  Telling me what to do?
[03:33:22.463 --> 03:33:26.248]  Here, today's toilet paper record.
[03:33:27.336 --> 03:33:32.920]  Officials enlist stars of TikTok in vaccine war.
[03:33:32.920 --> 03:33:35.602]  Official pieces of crap!
[03:33:35.602 --> 03:33:38.124]  Who are you calling official?
[03:33:38.124 --> 03:33:45.370]  Some bureaucratic scum who sucks off the public tit and does what they're told to do?
[03:33:45.370 --> 03:33:48.452]  And who are you telling me to listen to?
[03:33:48.452 --> 03:33:49.133]  I'll tell you who.
[03:33:49.133 --> 03:33:55.998]  Ellie Zeller, 17, a TikTok creator with over 10 million followers.
[03:33:56.874 --> 03:34:03.055]  Received an email in June from Village Marketing, an influencer marketing agency.
[03:34:03.055 --> 03:34:03.495]  Would Ms.
[03:34:03.495 --> 03:34:17.658]  Zila, a high school student senior who usually posts short fashion and lifestyle videos, be willing, the agency worded, to participate in the White House-backed campaign encouraging her audience to get vaccinated?
[03:34:17.658 --> 03:34:23.759]  There's a massive need to grow awareness, blah blah blah blah, they said.
[03:34:24.249 --> 03:34:26.110]  Miss Zeller quickly agreed.
[03:34:26.110 --> 03:34:29.392]  I got some kid telling me, Heil Hitler!
[03:34:29.392 --> 03:34:30.933]  That's what they're doing to us.
[03:34:30.933 --> 03:34:32.234]  Get it in your head.
[03:34:32.234 --> 03:34:33.915]  Get it in your head, everybody.
[03:34:33.915 --> 03:34:41.559]  If we don't unite for freedom, peace and justice, we are... It's a fight for our lives.

[03:35:49.430 --> 03:35:51.471]  The biosecurity state is here.
[03:35:51.471 --> 03:35:58.212]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[03:35:58.212 --> 03:36:11.956]  The corrupt puppet Prime Minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[03:36:13.436 --> 03:36:16.637]  And that in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[03:36:16.637 --> 03:36:20.639]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[03:36:20.639 --> 03:36:22.419]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[03:36:22.419 --> 03:36:25.100]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[03:36:25.100 --> 03:36:27.341]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[03:36:27.341 --> 03:36:29.902]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[03:36:29.902 --> 03:36:39.486]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[03:36:40.186 --> 03:36:41.589]  And bull wars will continue to set fast.
[03:36:41.589 --> 03:36:42.110]  They fight this.
[03:36:42.110 --> 03:36:43.634]  I don't know how long we can.
[03:36:43.634 --> 03:36:44.997]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[03:36:44.997 --> 03:36:46.600]  God bless and good luck.
[03:36:46.600 --> 03:36:48.123]  I would again get right with God right now.
[03:36:50.319 --> 03:36:58.484]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[03:36:58.484 --> 03:37:07.250]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[03:37:07.250 --> 03:37:14.214]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at infowarestore.com.
[03:37:14.214 --> 03:37:16.836]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[03:37:16.836 --> 03:37:19.278]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones.
[03:37:19.998 --> 03:37:20.859]  We're good to go.
[03:37:49.718 --> 03:37:50.859]  Come on.
[03:38:12.114 --> 03:38:20.298]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.

[03:38:26.181 --> 03:38:36.927]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[03:38:36.927 --> 03:38:38.208]  Thank you and God bless.

[03:38:45.416 --> 03:38:47.218]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:39:11.992 --> 03:39:19.175]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:39:19.175 --> 03:39:22.376]  Hey there.
[03:39:22.376 --> 03:39:25.958]  Hey, listen, I'm really upset because I see what's going on.
[03:39:25.958 --> 03:39:30.680]  And when I say we have to unite or else we're finished, I mean it with all my heart.
[03:39:30.680 --> 03:39:36.582]  This is, this is, this is, uh, we're in, we're in the 1930s here, in the late 1930s, where a COVID war has begun.
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:42.962]  And now they're ramping up, you know, the COVID war everywhere.
[03:39:42.962 --> 03:39:46.304]  If we don't unite for freedom, peace and justice, we're finished.
[03:39:46.304 --> 03:39:47.744]  And you can't do it without money.
[03:39:47.744 --> 03:39:49.245]  So get that in your head.
[03:39:49.245 --> 03:39:51.286]  And that's why you have to support InfoWars.
[03:39:51.286 --> 03:39:53.507]  And it's not like you're doing it for free.
[03:39:53.507 --> 03:39:55.629]  You know, it's not like a donation.
[03:39:55.629 --> 03:39:58.010]  Like Pfizer.
[03:39:58.010 --> 03:39:59.871]  Yeah, the drug dealers.
[03:39:59.871 --> 03:40:01.452]  Big people call them Big Pharma.
[03:40:01.452 --> 03:40:02.613]  Call them drug lords.
[03:40:02.613 --> 03:40:03.333]  Grow the hell up.
[03:40:04.156 --> 03:40:06.397]  Oh, that guy, Scott Gottlieb.
[03:40:06.397 --> 03:40:12.799]  Scott Gottlieb, that used to be on the Food and Drug Administration under Trump.
[03:40:12.799 --> 03:40:14.380]  Oh, yeah, now he's on the board of director.
[03:40:14.380 --> 03:40:19.822]  Pfizer gave Biden a million bucks to celebrate his inauguration.
[03:40:19.822 --> 03:40:24.704]  So if you don't give money and you don't get anything back, well, they do get, yeah, there he is.
[03:40:24.704 --> 03:40:28.865]  Another little boy, another, another little arrogant boy.
[03:40:28.865 --> 03:40:33.387]  This is the clown boy, by the way, that shot his fat mouth off.
[03:40:33.767 --> 03:40:36.068]  About social distancing!
[03:40:36.068 --> 03:40:38.209]  Oh, especially outside!
[03:40:38.209 --> 03:40:53.615]  And, of course, in the Trends Journal, we wrote the facts that, yeah, the chances of getting it outside, according to Dr. Newsom, are substantially less than 1% outdoor transmission, but they're locking down again in Australia, even though they're getting it down outside.
[03:40:53.615 --> 03:41:03.119]  But going back to support the truth, they got great sales going on, and they have the all-new Infowars store sale going on right now.
[03:41:04.059 --> 03:41:07.880]  And they have the super sale they've been running for the last few weeks.
[03:41:07.880 --> 03:41:15.462]  And they're proud to launch a new series of new sales along with a brand new item from Infowars Life.
[03:41:15.462 --> 03:41:18.983]  So act fast and get these deals before they're gone.
[03:41:18.983 --> 03:41:22.124]  They got hair and beard support formula.
[03:41:22.124 --> 03:41:23.964]  $24.95.
[03:41:23.964 --> 03:41:26.585]  It's an introductory price.
[03:41:26.585 --> 03:41:28.105]  It's going to go up.
[03:41:28.105 --> 03:41:31.746]  Greens, fiber capsules, total amino acid supercharger.
[03:41:32.369 --> 03:41:33.990]  An introductory price, 1995.

[03:42:02.849 --> 03:42:04.890]  Put those two together and you've got a hard time.
[03:42:04.890 --> 03:42:07.071]  50% off.

[03:42:41.542 --> 03:42:44.303]  That's where we have to go or else we're finished.
[03:42:44.303 --> 03:42:46.104]  They're censoring everybody.
[03:42:46.104 --> 03:42:47.225]  Here.
[03:42:47.225 --> 03:42:50.006]  The toilet paper record over here.
[03:42:50.006 --> 03:42:54.368]  The New York Times.
[03:42:54.368 --> 03:42:55.889]  All the news that's fit to print.
[03:42:57.481 --> 03:43:01.844]  All right, that shows you the arrogance of these little boys and girls.
[03:43:01.844 --> 03:43:05.387]  Who the hell are you to tell me what's fit to print?
[03:43:05.387 --> 03:43:10.071]  Oh, hey, don't you know who we are?
[03:43:10.071 --> 03:43:12.092]  Yeah, we're prostitutes.
[03:43:12.092 --> 03:43:18.918]  We get paid to put out by our corporate pimps and our government whoremasters.
[03:43:19.825 --> 03:43:21.206]  Oh yeah!
[03:43:21.206 --> 03:43:24.367]  All the news that's set to print, you little slime balls!
[03:43:24.367 --> 03:43:34.291]  Oh yeah, like that Saddam Hussein has those aluminum tubes that he's making weapons of mass destruction with, you lying SOBs that brought us into the Iraq War.
[03:43:34.291 --> 03:43:39.133]  Anyway, going on.
[03:43:39.133 --> 03:43:42.074]  That story I was writing about officials and lists.
[03:43:42.074 --> 03:43:45.476]  Again, officials is profanity.
[03:43:45.476 --> 03:43:46.656]  What official?
[03:43:46.656 --> 03:43:48.057]  Official piece of crap.
[03:43:49.807 --> 03:43:57.310]  They go on to say about getting these young people, tapping influencers to steer facts to youths.
[03:43:57.310 --> 03:43:59.211]  To steer facts!
[03:43:59.211 --> 03:44:03.053]  The crap that they're shoving down our throat are the facts!
[03:44:03.053 --> 03:44:18.620]  Anyway, to reach these young people, the White House has enlisted an eclectic army of more than 50 Twitch streamers, YouTubers, TikTokers, and to reach 18-year-old pop star
[03:44:20.009 --> 03:44:29.294]  And the 18-year-old pop star, Olivia Rodrigo, all of them with enormous online audiences.
[03:44:29.294 --> 03:44:31.174]  Propaganda is supreme.
[03:44:31.174 --> 03:44:35.417]  And here's the arrogance of what they write.
[03:44:35.417 --> 03:44:45.261]  The efforts are in part a counterattack against the rising tide of vaccine misinformation.
[03:44:45.261 --> 03:44:48.483]  The anti-vaccine side of the Internet
[03:44:49.258 --> 03:45:00.865]  Is still on, on all this vaccine news, said Samir Mazrababa, the administrator of several meme pages.
[03:45:00.865 --> 03:45:06.268]  What the hell do I care what an 18-year-old thinks?
[03:45:06.268 --> 03:45:09.350]  Or a 17-year-old TikToker?
[03:45:09.350 --> 03:45:10.411]  You're gonna tell me?
[03:45:10.411 --> 03:45:13.052]  You're gonna tell me the facts?
[03:45:13.052 --> 03:45:13.893]  Who are you talking to?
[03:45:15.285 --> 03:45:17.827]  I put out a magazine, the Trends Journal.
[03:45:17.827 --> 03:45:21.991]  Last week was only 158 pages and no ads.
[03:45:21.991 --> 03:45:23.592]  All the facts.
[03:45:23.592 --> 03:45:24.854]  All the facts.
[03:45:24.854 --> 03:45:26.415]  And I got little kids.
[03:45:26.415 --> 03:45:32.520]  I'm pushing this out there because you can see the propaganda and it's them against us.
[03:45:32.520 --> 03:45:34.062]  It's them against us.
[03:45:34.062 --> 03:45:36.584]  It's them against us.
[03:45:36.584 --> 03:45:38.145]  All aboard!
[03:45:38.145 --> 03:45:39.687]  Next train to Auschwitz!
[03:45:40.640 --> 03:45:48.426]  Yeah, Auschwitz is back in Germany, right in front of your eyes!
[03:45:48.426 --> 03:45:50.908]  Right in front of your eyes!
[03:45:50.908 --> 03:45:55.892]  And this is how they do it.
[03:45:55.892 --> 03:46:00.516]  They get all these other people against us, celebrities.
[03:46:00.516 --> 03:46:01.637]  Sean Pencil.
[03:46:02.569 --> 03:46:04.610]  What the hell are you talking about?
[03:46:04.610 --> 03:46:08.232]  Oh, if you don't get vaccinated, you can't get on the set.
[03:46:08.232 --> 03:46:09.893]  These are actors.
[03:46:09.893 --> 03:46:11.694]  Oh, the word celebrities?
[03:46:11.694 --> 03:46:13.976]  Yeah, F you with that word.
[03:46:13.976 --> 03:46:15.396]  What celebrity?
[03:46:15.396 --> 03:46:28.284]  Some crap head that knows how to memorize lines and play a role of being somebody that they're not because the real person they are are as empty as a bottle of crap.
[03:46:29.827 --> 03:46:31.308]  A celebrity!
[03:46:31.308 --> 03:46:32.969]  Screw you!
[03:46:32.969 --> 03:46:34.350]  Pencil?
[03:46:34.350 --> 03:46:39.534]  Yeah, and take that pencil, pen, and shove it up your pen, you know what?
[03:46:39.534 --> 03:46:41.315]  And I'll say that to your face.
[03:46:41.315 --> 03:46:46.258]  57 John Street, Kingston, New York.
[03:46:46.258 --> 03:46:53.463]  You come to me, man-to-man, and try to push your crap on me, man-to-man.
[03:46:53.463 --> 03:46:59.347]  Any one of you COVID cops, come over here and try to inject me or tell me what to do.
[03:47:02.717 --> 03:47:04.617]  Man to man!
[03:47:04.617 --> 03:47:07.018]  These aren't men!
[03:47:07.018 --> 03:47:10.479]  These are your SSR back in Germany!
[03:47:10.479 --> 03:47:18.821]  I just read to you what they did in passing that law last November!
[03:47:18.821 --> 03:47:22.221]  How dare you don't want to take a vaccination!
[03:47:22.221 --> 03:47:26.562]  A gene therapy shot unapproved by the FDA!
[03:47:26.562 --> 03:47:29.063]  An Operation Warp Speed!
[03:47:30.669 --> 03:47:34.110]  You gotta be warped in their head!
[03:47:34.110 --> 03:47:38.832]  Oh, and all you people that are forcing it on us!
[03:47:38.832 --> 03:47:40.152]  I guess it's not working for you.
[03:47:40.152 --> 03:47:42.093]  They want us to go down with you too?
[03:47:42.093 --> 03:47:46.494]  What happened over there in Providence, Rhode Island?
[03:47:46.494 --> 03:47:51.776]  75% of the people that got vaccinated got the virus again?
[03:47:51.776 --> 03:47:53.156]  Guess it ain't working, huh?
[03:47:53.156 --> 03:47:55.197]  Oh, yeah, but they weren't as sick as they were.
[03:47:55.197 --> 03:47:59.558]  Oh, hey, flabby face, fat mouth, piece of crap!
[03:48:01.132 --> 03:48:08.477]  Piers Morgan said how sick he was after catching it the second time.
[03:48:08.477 --> 03:48:17.202]  Flabby face, jerk around, can't say the other word because that would be proper.
[03:48:17.202 --> 03:48:18.683]  Look at it.
[03:48:18.683 --> 03:48:21.224]  If we don't unite and fight for freedom, we're gone.
[03:48:21.224 --> 03:48:22.125]  It's over.
[03:48:22.125 --> 03:48:24.646]  Get it in your head, everybody.
[03:48:24.646 --> 03:48:26.888]  You can't go to college without a vaccination.
[03:48:27.589 --> 03:48:31.971]  New York, Danny Myers, another little arrogant boy!
[03:48:31.971 --> 03:48:35.252]  You can't go into his places if you don't got the shot.
[03:48:35.252 --> 03:48:40.374]  I got the shot and you can take it up to you-know-what.
[03:48:40.374 --> 03:48:42.735]  You see what they're doing?
[03:48:42.735 --> 03:48:45.416]  Italy, no shot, no restaurants.
[03:48:45.416 --> 03:48:47.837]  France, no shot, no restaurants.
[03:48:47.837 --> 03:48:50.998]  I told everybody, oh, they're doing this to get rid of Trump.
[03:48:50.998 --> 03:48:53.859]  I said, you're full of baloney, it has nothing to do with Trump.
[03:48:53.859 --> 03:48:55.200]  They're doing it everywhere.
[03:48:57.119 --> 03:49:00.321]  Cuomo mandates vaccine for state workers.
[03:49:00.321 --> 03:49:01.081]  Yeah.
[03:49:01.081 --> 03:49:08.766]  And so does that little Wilhelm boy who uses the name de Blasio to get the Italian votes.
[03:49:08.766 --> 03:49:10.607]  Wilhelm.
[03:49:10.607 --> 03:49:12.869]  Yeah.
[03:49:12.869 --> 03:49:15.270]  Listen, if we don't unite, we're done.
[03:49:15.270 --> 03:49:15.770]  Finished.
[03:49:15.770 --> 03:49:16.491]  Finito.
[03:49:16.491 --> 03:49:16.771]  Gone.
[03:49:18.208 --> 03:49:20.050]  They're robbing us of our freedom.
[03:49:20.050 --> 03:49:20.952]  And I'm fighting.
[03:49:20.952 --> 03:49:22.994]  I put on rallies, festivals.
[03:49:22.994 --> 03:49:24.396]  InfoWars is fighting.
[03:49:24.396 --> 03:49:26.098]  You have to join the fight.
[03:49:26.098 --> 03:49:31.085]  United we stand, divided we fall!
[03:49:31.085 --> 03:49:32.006]  We'll be right back.
[03:49:32.006 --> 03:49:35.711]  Remember, get those all new InfoWars store sales now.
