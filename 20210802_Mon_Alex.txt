[00:00.000 --> 00:14.660]  The coronavirus is not going away, or can we ever go back to a pre-pandemic reality?
[00:14.660 --> 00:19.200]  We are never going to go back to a pre-pandemic reality, and I do agree that we do have to
[00:19.200 --> 00:23.900]  become comfortable with the fact that this virus is going to be sticking around.
[00:23.900 --> 00:28.760]  While Mr. Biden said he would be willing to get a vaccine, he would not require it for
[00:28.760 --> 00:30.200]  all Americans.
[00:30.200 --> 00:31.480]  I don't think it should be mandatory.
[00:31.480 --> 00:35.360]  I wouldn't demand to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power, just like
[00:35.360 --> 00:38.880]  I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide.
[00:38.880 --> 00:44.040]  Joe Biden's tyranny is the disease ripping through the Haggard Republic.
[00:44.040 --> 00:49.360]  Every day, more businesses are implementing their own vaccine mandates, and the Justice
[00:49.360 --> 00:56.720]  Department has made it clear that it is legal to require COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:56.720 --> 00:59.640]  We all want our lives to get back to normal.
[00:59.640 --> 01:02.280]  We are never going to go back to a pre-pandemic reality.
[01:02.280 --> 01:04.800]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[01:04.800 --> 01:08.240]  Will you require more federal employees to get vaccinated?
[01:08.240 --> 01:11.520]  That's under consideration right now, but if you're not vaccinated, you're not really
[01:11.520 --> 01:13.040]  as smart as I thought you would.
[01:13.040 --> 01:18.280]  We have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated, and they're going in a normal situation.
[01:18.280 --> 01:27.600]  The more we learn, the more we learn about this virus, the more we have to be worried
[01:27.600 --> 01:28.600]  and concerned.
[01:28.600 --> 01:34.040]  And then only one thing we know for sure, if those other unvaccinated people got vaccinated,
[01:34.040 --> 01:36.840]  we'd be in a very different world.
[01:36.840 --> 01:40.920]  The bottom line is that a huge number of vaccinated people are getting COVID, and some of them
[01:40.920 --> 01:43.360]  are getting very sick, even dying.
[01:43.360 --> 01:44.560]  That's true around the world.
[01:44.560 --> 01:48.960]  It's true in Iceland, Gibraltar, Israel, in small countries with high vaccination rates
[01:48.960 --> 01:51.600]  that have seen big spikes in COVID cases.
[01:51.600 --> 01:54.720]  And it's every bit as true here in the United States.
[01:54.720 --> 01:59.720]  According to the CDC today, fully three-quarters of the people infected in a recent outbreak,
[01:59.720 --> 02:03.920]  for example, in Massachusetts, had already been vaccinated.
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.640]  The CDC announced that vaccinated people can carry the virus with them, and they can easily
[02:08.640 --> 02:10.920]  spread the virus to others.
[02:10.920 --> 02:18.240]  As the CDC conceded, quote, breakthrough infections may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases.
[02:18.240 --> 02:22.840]  The reason the administration and the governments around the world are accelerating their push
[02:22.840 --> 02:29.960]  for mass vaccination right now is because they know the window of obedience will be
[02:29.960 --> 02:36.560]  slammed shut the minute the wave of post-vaccination deaths really kicks in, which many people
[02:36.560 --> 02:41.080]  believe in the northern hemisphere will happen during the flu season, January, February of
[02:41.080 --> 02:42.080]  next year.
[02:42.080 --> 02:43.080]  But that's just a guess.
[02:43.080 --> 02:44.080]  Nobody knows for sure.
[02:44.080 --> 02:50.040]  They're saying that this is an agenda to mass exterminate as many people as possible because
[02:50.040 --> 02:54.440]  dead people don't protest, because dead people don't sue.
[02:54.440 --> 02:58.520]  So if they can kill as many as possible, they can really limit the backlash that they know
[02:58.520 --> 02:59.520]  is coming anyway.
[02:59.520 --> 03:02.560]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[03:02.560 --> 03:08.560]  After months of saying the opposite, the Democrats are now pushing mandates for the vaccinated.
[03:08.560 --> 03:10.680]  So here's the thing.
[03:10.680 --> 03:14.560]  We cannot require someone to be vaccinated.
[03:14.560 --> 03:16.320]  That's just not what we can do.
[03:16.320 --> 03:22.760]  When the Democrat-led government begins mandatory forced vaccinations and people begin to die
[03:22.760 --> 03:28.560]  and suffer in droves from Joe Biden's ignorance and disinformation, the United States will
[03:28.560 --> 03:34.600]  erupt with legitimate protests, similar to those in Europe where a farmer unloaded manure
[03:34.600 --> 03:38.200]  into an open window in the presidential palace.
[03:38.200 --> 03:44.680]  The U.S. isn't the only place seeing what Joe on Friday described as toxic individualism.
[03:44.680 --> 03:48.880]  People thumping their chests in the name of freedom while thumbing their noses at any
[03:48.880 --> 03:51.440]  sense of personal responsibility.
[03:51.440 --> 03:57.800]  We saw this also playing out over the weekend in France, which saw massive, at times violent
[03:57.800 --> 04:04.320]  protests over new laws that will require proof of vaccination to enter restaurants and other
[04:04.320 --> 04:05.440]  businesses.
[04:05.440 --> 04:10.880]  Of course, Joe Biden's unyielding attempts to vaccinate America to please his globalist
[04:10.880 --> 04:18.160]  puppet masters violates the 14th Amendment and the Nuremberg Code, but his team of anti-liberty
[04:18.160 --> 04:26.160]  lawyers will determine if Supreme Court cases like the 1905 Jacobson vs. Massachusetts will
[04:26.160 --> 04:29.040]  open the door for vaccine mandate tyranny.
[04:29.040 --> 04:32.520]  Why are the doctors not here in the brief room to take our questions?
[04:32.520 --> 04:38.200]  I would argue that we had the President of the United States speak to this yesterday.
[04:38.200 --> 04:42.520]  He gave a more than 30-minute speech about where we are as a country.
[04:42.520 --> 04:45.240]  I mean, he is a trusted voice.
[04:45.240 --> 04:47.640]  He's the leader of our country.
[04:47.640 --> 04:50.360]  No, but we heard from him, right?
[04:50.360 --> 04:51.860]  We heard from the President yesterday.
[04:51.860 --> 04:58.720]  We heard from the President about the Delta variant and vaccine.
[04:58.720 --> 05:03.400]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that
[05:03.400 --> 05:04.720]  I've ever done.
[05:04.720 --> 05:09.120]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months
[05:09.120 --> 05:11.600]  in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[05:11.600 --> 05:14.360]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[05:14.360 --> 05:20.120]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[05:20.120 --> 05:28.240]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, frankspeech.com.

[05:57.640 --> 06:13.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, 1.20.21, here I am.
[06:13.760 --> 06:18.280]  Live for Wars, tomorrow's news today.
[06:18.280 --> 06:24.320]  The British government is now officially warning that vaccine individuals would become factories
[06:24.320 --> 06:29.640]  that they believe could produce a super virus that would kill one third of the Earth's population.
[06:29.640 --> 06:35.520]  From front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:35.520 --> 06:43.320]  One third of the world's population, 2.625 billion, over 2.6 billion.
[06:43.320 --> 06:44.320]  Is it true?
[06:44.320 --> 06:48.240]  It's absolutely true because that's what they're planning next.
[06:48.240 --> 06:52.400]  We've been teed up and prepared with the binary weapon.
[06:52.400 --> 06:55.880]  Every minute of this show is precious now, you can be taken off air at any time the enemy
[06:55.880 --> 07:00.080]  is closing in on us and they're closing in on you and your family.
[07:00.080 --> 07:04.520]  It's like the 1970s body snatcher movie, but it's for real.
[07:04.520 --> 07:09.800]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[07:09.800 --> 07:15.600]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of this
[07:15.600 --> 07:23.200]  country is about to be handed over to SCUM, more beholden to SCUM and the Russian SCUM.
[07:23.200 --> 07:35.360]  Listen, please listen, if you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the
[07:35.360 --> 07:38.880]  same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[07:38.880 --> 07:42.880]  The function of all life is survival.
[07:42.880 --> 07:47.880]  Sleep, sleep, sleep.
[07:47.880 --> 07:56.680]  They're coming, they're coming, help, help, they're coming, they're coming, listen to
[07:56.680 --> 08:03.120]  me, listen, help me, your next, please, your next, they're in danger, please, listen to
[08:03.120 --> 08:07.720]  me, it's something terrible, please, your next, here they are, they're already here,
[08:07.720 --> 08:13.040]  help, your next, they're coming, they're coming.
[08:13.040 --> 08:21.000]  The seed is planted, sleep, sleep, terror, grows, I heard them just wake up, they'll
[08:21.000 --> 08:28.000]  get you when you sleep, sit up, invasion of the body snatchers, all of a sudden they're
[08:28.000 --> 08:35.240]  growing like parasites, is it contagious, it looked right at me, you're looking at
[08:35.240 --> 08:43.000]  it as if it was human, it was not human, now the classic fear begins to grow, we're
[08:43.000 --> 08:50.920]  spinning corners, in a modern masterpiece of science fiction, a barricade in the street,
[08:50.920 --> 08:58.920]  invasion of the body snatchers, the land of the walking dead,
[08:58.920 --> 09:21.520]  if you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[09:28.920 --> 09:40.520]  The morning of January 6th, 2021 was by far the largest peaceful protest for fair elections
[09:40.520 --> 09:44.480]  ever assembled in America.
[09:44.480 --> 09:50.840]  After decades of unanswered election fraud evidence from both political parties, the
[09:50.840 --> 09:55.840]  2020 election was by far the most egregious.
[09:55.840 --> 10:02.200]  An issue once heralded by the American liberal, who is now flagrantly quiet on the issue,
[10:02.200 --> 10:07.280]  while seizing total control of the system with the full support of the entire mainstream
[10:07.280 --> 10:14.560]  media apparatus, pushing their once sacred democracy over the cliff into tyranny, just
[10:14.560 --> 10:18.520]  as Plato predicted millenniums ago.
[10:18.520 --> 10:23.960]  What should have been remembered as a historic day for democracy was spun into a blatant
[10:23.960 --> 10:26.040]  lie.
[10:26.040 --> 10:31.400]  Aside from the murder of Ashley Babbitt, the small amount of violence that did occur was
[10:31.400 --> 10:38.240]  about what you would expect, considering how the FBI, who have faked and manufactured nearly
[10:38.240 --> 10:45.160]  95% of every terrorist arrest they've made since 9-11, had agent provocateurs involved
[10:45.160 --> 10:50.760]  in the so-called January 6th insurrection from the start.
[10:50.760 --> 10:57.680]  Legal agent provocateurs who remain free and protected, while dozens of innocent Americans
[10:57.680 --> 11:03.200]  are being tortured in jail with complete disregard for justice.
[11:03.200 --> 11:09.560]  With no evidence of a crime, they are being held in unlawfully cruel conditions, ignored
[11:09.560 --> 11:14.040]  by the criminal media responsible for putting them there and punished for speaking to the
[11:14.040 --> 11:16.880]  press about beatings and torture.
[11:16.880 --> 11:19.400]  We don't know much about them.
[11:19.400 --> 11:22.160]  But we do know Joe Biggs.
[11:22.160 --> 11:28.680]  After serving his country honorably as a soldier, he then became a voice for American justice.
[11:28.680 --> 11:34.600]  Joe Biggs is now being held in third world prison conditions for simply being present
[11:34.600 --> 11:36.960]  at the U.S. Capitol.
[11:36.960 --> 11:41.320]  He recently wrote of his three month experience in jail.
[11:41.320 --> 11:46.200]  He wrote of health issues he has experienced as a result of sleeping only four hours a
[11:46.200 --> 11:52.000]  night on a cold steel rack while not being allowed to work out and only given 10 hours
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.920]  of sunlight in three months, a soy based diet with hardly any protein, mostly processed
[11:58.920 --> 12:04.320]  foods and some kind of gelatin dog food looking stuff.
[12:04.320 --> 12:09.960]  There is no privacy allowed for the toilets and he has allotted a single shelf that nothing
[12:09.960 --> 12:12.280]  can be placed on.
[12:12.280 --> 12:17.400]  They are punished by losing the ability to talk to family and being stripped naked and
[12:17.400 --> 12:20.720]  locked alone in a bright freezing room.
[12:20.720 --> 12:28.800]  Joe Biggs wrote, I have anxiety bad now, panic attacks so bad I black out.
[12:28.800 --> 12:36.360]  What happened on January 6th, 2021 was a crime perpetrated by a corrupt government against
[12:36.360 --> 12:38.360]  the American people.
[12:38.360 --> 12:42.720]  This is evident to anyone outside of the brainwashed herd.
[12:42.720 --> 12:48.560]  Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken out against these crimes and yet former President
[12:48.560 --> 12:51.400]  Trump has not.
[12:51.400 --> 12:56.920]  Perhaps the worst part of all is how both liberals and conservatives remain silent.
[12:56.920 --> 13:03.640]  Like cowardly domesticated pets, they say nothing while dozens of innocent Americans
[13:03.640 --> 13:10.320]  are tortured in jail like war criminals without any evidence of a crime.
[13:10.320 --> 13:36.520]  For info wars dot com, this is Greg Ries.
[13:36.520 --> 13:48.600]  This is an overwhelming time of biblical proportions.
[13:48.600 --> 13:52.760]  Joe Biggs talked about in solitary confinement basically how he has panic attacks and blacks
[13:52.760 --> 13:53.760]  out.
[13:53.760 --> 13:55.480]  I can't even imagine what he's going through.
[13:55.480 --> 13:58.880]  I pray for him daily he's a good man, a good person, didn't do anything wrong that day.
[13:58.880 --> 14:07.640]  Just got set up when they opened the doors up and the excitement went in, but I myself
[14:07.640 --> 14:13.040]  yesterday have been researching for about six hours off and on and it was so staggering
[14:13.040 --> 14:17.520]  to know that they're genociding everybody that they've committed that I actually got
[14:17.520 --> 14:22.240]  dizzy and started stumbling up against the wall and had to sit down for about 30 minutes
[14:22.240 --> 14:26.120]  and I almost couldn't come to the show yesterday and see most people lack tough and big and
[14:26.120 --> 14:31.400]  powerful and they can handle it and they can, I'm a pretty tough guy and knowing how bad
[14:31.400 --> 14:37.360]  this is and my mind coming to grips with, okay, it's as bad as we thought it's worse.
[14:37.360 --> 14:41.320]  That was my brain resetting and I was a lot stronger after it happened, but I literally
[14:41.320 --> 14:46.680]  had to sit down in a chair and was dizzy and about to throw up just processing this and
[14:46.680 --> 14:52.200]  look, if Alex Jones can't process this, I get it if you can't process it, but it's
[14:52.200 --> 14:53.200]  all happening.
[14:53.200 --> 14:58.040]  All that feeling is coming back right now.
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.560]  So and the feeling is your psychic connection, your fellow humans that are being poisoned
[15:03.560 --> 15:08.120]  and murdered all around you and the fact that total psycho criminals are preying on us and
[15:08.120 --> 15:09.760]  coming after us and it's all confirmed.
[15:09.760 --> 15:16.560]  I mean, they now have the dean of the top medical schools in the United States coming
[15:16.560 --> 15:21.480]  out and saying, don't take the shots, they always knew that any shot targeting a protein
[15:21.480 --> 15:29.960]  of a coronavirus would cause death, basically.
[15:29.960 --> 15:36.000]  I mean, this is just getting insane and it's all right out in the open antibody dependent
[15:36.000 --> 15:43.680]  enhancement and the dean of the Baylor Medical School told Congress this month ago, I didn't
[15:43.680 --> 15:44.680]  even know this.
[15:44.680 --> 15:49.800]  I mean, God, it's like, it's like, don't take cyanide, it'll kill you, don't take these
[15:49.800 --> 15:54.200]  shots, it'll really eff you up and they're doing it and they're coming for us and they've
[15:54.200 --> 15:57.160]  already killed the majority of the coverage and died.
[15:57.160 --> 16:02.320]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that

[16:11.240 --> 16:13.280]  Well it's all come down to this.
[16:13.280 --> 16:19.040]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th.

[16:58.640 --> 17:05.840]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, that it's
[17:05.840 --> 17:10.800]  criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public, they do the same
[17:10.800 --> 17:16.160]  things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and
[17:16.160 --> 17:17.160]  over again.
[17:17.160 --> 17:24.800]  Well guess what, it was Anthony Fauci and Eugenicist's globalist that ran the rollout
[17:24.800 --> 17:29.160]  of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more
[17:29.160 --> 17:35.040]  people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually
[17:35.040 --> 17:39.520]  go attack the t-lint besides the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[17:39.520 --> 17:44.880]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[17:44.880 --> 17:45.880]  the road.
[17:45.880 --> 17:49.960]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the
[17:49.960 --> 17:55.280]  COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[17:55.280 --> 17:57.640]  That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[17:57.640 --> 18:01.280]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[18:01.280 --> 18:05.440]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra
[18:05.440 --> 18:09.520]  people to starve to death and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western
[18:09.520 --> 18:10.520]  world.
[18:10.520 --> 18:13.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that's
[18:13.880 --> 18:17.520]  ready to ship while you still can at 20, 20 prices.
[18:17.520 --> 18:21.000]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  Their entire catalog is at infowarstore.com.
[18:23.000 --> 18:28.720]  You get an additional 10% off at infowarstore.com but only for one more week.
[18:28.720 --> 18:32.200]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex, but that's it.
[18:32.200 --> 18:37.320]  They won't do this sale again until November and then the food prices go up in 2022.
[18:37.320 --> 18:38.800]  This is insurance you can eat.
[18:38.800 --> 18:41.960]  It's the highest quality, hundreds of high quality foods, three months, six months,
[18:41.960 --> 18:48.240]  your supplies, all ready for you at infowarstore.com or call toll-free, triple-eight, two-five-three,
[18:48.240 --> 18:49.240]  three-one-three-nine.
[18:49.240 --> 18:54.400]  Again, infowarstore.com, 10% off on high quality, storeable food, ready to ship, but it ends
[18:54.400 --> 19:01.160]  in just one week, so take action now while you still can.
[19:01.160 --> 19:08.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[19:08.160 --> 19:36.600]  All right, I'm going to say this very slowly and I'm going to say this very, very clearly.
[19:36.600 --> 19:44.240]  As best I can because I can put two and two together just as good as anybody and I know
[19:44.240 --> 19:47.080]  who the global star and what they're up to and what their plan is, so I'm going to lay
[19:47.080 --> 19:51.120]  something on you, really, really earth-shattering right now.
[19:51.120 --> 20:00.200]  The British official government agency with its civilian and military government says
[20:00.200 --> 20:09.960]  they believe that the vaccinated are causing mutations that could kill one-third of the
[20:09.960 --> 20:12.280]  planet and that's the headline.
[20:12.280 --> 20:18.280]  Now, deadly or COVID variant could kill one in three people, sagewarns, that's the federal
[20:18.280 --> 20:19.280]  main agency.
[20:19.280 --> 20:20.760]  Now, is that true?
[20:20.760 --> 20:21.760]  Is that fear-mongering?
[20:21.760 --> 20:29.960]  I'm going to give you my take in a moment, but let's talk about that right now.
[20:29.960 --> 20:35.480]  If you have billions of people that have been inoculated and six, eight months later were
[20:35.480 --> 20:42.920]  told now they're going to give off variants that are going to kill you, so not just the
[20:42.920 --> 20:47.320]  unvaccinated need to be vaccinated, but also the people that have already been given injections
[20:47.320 --> 20:50.720]  because now they're factories of death.
[20:50.720 --> 20:53.440]  We predicted that logically.
[20:53.440 --> 20:58.800]  That's exactly what the globalists would do to then put a third injection in these individuals
[20:58.800 --> 21:03.880]  and seal their fate, and then I guess they've got to take more shots because I guess that
[21:03.880 --> 21:07.920]  third injection is going to cause more deadly variants again.
[21:07.920 --> 21:10.080]  See how the trap works?
[21:10.080 --> 21:13.120]  Whatever the real science is, we're not being told.
[21:13.120 --> 21:18.000]  Whatever they're really up to, we know it's about the population and we know from all
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.840]  the studies and all the real scientists, heads of agencies, heads of hospitals, heads of major
[21:23.840 --> 21:28.720]  universities, chief scientists.
[21:28.720 --> 21:35.280]  We know that when you create a vaccine, whether it's from a virus vector or mRNA that attacks
[21:35.280 --> 21:43.160]  the shell of something, that when you do that, it causes all these different types of deadly
[21:43.160 --> 21:49.880]  diseases in the body of every mammal they give it to, and so this was heavily tested, heavily
[21:49.880 --> 21:50.880]  vetted.
[21:50.880 --> 21:54.960]  And look, I knew all this, but yesterday I did a bunch of research again and was all
[21:54.960 --> 22:00.600]  over the internet looking at clips of different doctor groups and again, prestigious scientists
[22:00.600 --> 22:07.240]  and they were all testifying to Congress like the Dean of Science and Healthcare, the Dean
[22:07.240 --> 22:12.000]  of Science and Medical at a very respected medical school, Baylor Medical School, where
[22:12.000 --> 22:20.760]  my dad went, and there they are saying point blank, every vaccine, he told Congress this,
[22:20.760 --> 22:26.800]  every vaccine that's ever targeted the coronavirus shell has killed the animals we gave it to,
[22:26.800 --> 22:30.480]  every project has failed, until Bill Gates took it over.
[22:30.480 --> 22:35.720]  He says Bill Gates took it over eight years ago, which he did, why did Bill Gates take
[22:35.720 --> 22:40.920]  over a project that always failed and always killed the majority of the animals and sterilized
[22:40.920 --> 22:41.920]  them?
[22:41.920 --> 22:42.920]  I mean, that's in the damn studies.
[22:42.920 --> 22:48.000]  And we've known this for a while, but to sit there and watch them load the gun and kill
[22:48.000 --> 22:55.320]  people like this in slow motion is just absolutely earth-shattering for me.
[22:55.320 --> 22:58.440]  And I know that's why the general public won't be able to handle this and will continue to
[22:58.440 --> 23:02.440]  take the shots, even as it kills them, because it's so scary to them to admit they've got
[23:02.440 --> 23:06.920]  a psychotic, criminal, murderous, planetary world government that's literally run by
[23:06.920 --> 23:09.720]  Satan doing this to them, even though that's the complete facts.
[23:09.720 --> 23:13.120]  But here's the good news, and I don't know what the Globals are going to do.
[23:13.120 --> 23:18.320]  I know two medical doctors in Austin that are my doctors.
[23:18.320 --> 23:19.840]  They didn't used to be that woke.
[23:19.840 --> 23:23.680]  Now they go, oh, this is a kill plan, a total tag harbor, spike protein, all the doctors
[23:23.680 --> 23:25.400]  they know know that.
[23:25.400 --> 23:28.360]  Doctors walk up to me at the grocery store and say, I'm a medical doctor, absolutely
[23:28.360 --> 23:29.360]  right.
[23:29.360 --> 23:35.040]  And then I could watch hundreds of new doctors a day, heads of hospitals, heads of ERs, heads
[23:35.040 --> 23:37.360]  of private clinics saying the same damn thing.
[23:37.360 --> 23:38.520]  And I could read the studies all day.
[23:38.520 --> 23:43.440]  I mean, this is settled science.
[23:43.440 --> 23:52.560]  That they, every vaccine program they ever did, and we have the inventor of mRNA saying
[23:52.560 --> 24:00.040]  every study they ever did, trying to have mRNA create a spike protein, kill the animals.
[24:00.040 --> 24:01.040]  So do you understand?
[24:01.040 --> 24:05.000]  I'm going to play those clips next segment that we're not talking about this theoretically
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.160]  like we were a year ago, it's now here.
[24:09.160 --> 24:15.820]  And I am completely blown away at a level never before because so many people are still
[24:15.820 --> 24:21.560]  just caught up in La La Land and we have the new replacement they're now phasing her in
[24:21.560 --> 24:36.480]  for sake just as clueless deputy secretary for the press secretary Karen Jean Pierre
[24:36.480 --> 24:45.880]  and she's asked a question by Emerald Robinson from Newsmax and she just says, oh, we don't
[24:45.880 --> 24:46.880]  look at anything.
[24:46.880 --> 24:53.400]  We don't trust the scientists and the scientists are big pharma, Pfizer, Bill Gates and Fauci
[24:53.400 --> 24:54.640]  and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[24:54.640 --> 24:58.480]  Oh, and then she just sits up there and spews B.S. at people.
[24:58.480 --> 25:05.320]  So she says because the experts say so, stay on the Titanic, even though the ship's listing
[25:05.320 --> 25:10.120]  over to its side nonfire, because they say so.
[25:10.120 --> 25:15.280]  I mean, this is Jim Jones drink the Kool-Aid stuff and then Brian Stilter has the nerve
[25:15.280 --> 25:18.480]  to say those of us that don't want the shots are in a cult.
[25:18.480 --> 25:21.960]  We don't want an experimental shot that's been banned all over the world.
[25:21.960 --> 25:26.120]  That's now had all these horrible health effects that killed the rats and ferrets.
[25:26.120 --> 25:30.200]  And then you, well, weird, hookedy-duppy dude, like we're on an acid trip in hell, is up
[25:30.200 --> 25:35.440]  there saying weird Jim Jones cult people and they're on TV saying you shouldn't have food.
[25:35.440 --> 25:36.760]  You shouldn't have your children.
[25:36.760 --> 25:37.760]  You shouldn't have a job.
[25:37.760 --> 25:38.760]  Take the shot.
[25:38.760 --> 25:39.760]  Take the shot.
[25:39.760 --> 25:43.200]  Because if they don't get the vast majority of people to take it and then they get sick,
[25:43.200 --> 25:46.760]  the whole country won't collapse and there'll be a giant mass of people that are going to
[25:46.760 --> 25:52.160]  hunt them down and bring them to justice, which is going to happen.
[25:52.160 --> 25:53.400]  They took their shot at us, folks.
[25:53.400 --> 25:55.200]  They did it to the medical system, world government.
[25:55.200 --> 25:59.280]  They want to depopulate the West, get us out of the way for a slave class, new world order
[25:59.280 --> 26:00.760]  with China at the head of it.
[26:00.760 --> 26:03.080]  We are in a war with the globalist in China.
[26:03.080 --> 26:06.280]  They are depopulating us right now.
[26:06.280 --> 26:11.080]  China just went back to their next lockdown with fake people falling over and everything
[26:11.080 --> 26:12.080]  to get us all scared.
[26:12.080 --> 26:15.800]  We've done it again.
[26:15.800 --> 26:17.480]  I mean, they're making their move, baby.
[26:17.480 --> 26:21.880]  I've got footage from all the world of helicopters and SWAT teams physically attacking people
[26:21.880 --> 26:25.920]  and horses and water cannons of folks that want to come out after a year and a half being
[26:25.920 --> 26:27.680]  brutally attacked.
[26:27.680 --> 26:34.400]  But here is the press spokesperson saying because the experts say so, saying we don't
[26:34.400 --> 26:35.400]  even ask questions.
[26:35.400 --> 26:36.400]  Here it is.
[26:36.400 --> 26:37.400]  I understand the question.
[26:37.400 --> 26:42.680]  How do you test when that is the dominant strain in an area when people just test whether
[26:42.680 --> 26:43.680]  they're COVID positive?
[26:43.680 --> 26:46.200]  Well, we don't test it.
[26:46.200 --> 26:47.200]  We don't test it.
[26:47.200 --> 26:52.960]  We listen to public health and scientists and they tell us that it's the Delta variant.
[26:52.960 --> 26:57.120]  I don't even understand why would they explain their process of how they're determining
[26:57.120 --> 26:58.600]  if the Delta variant?
[26:58.600 --> 27:00.520]  I mean, that's what they are telling us.
[27:00.520 --> 27:07.240]  I laid out how contagious it was and I laid out why we needed to act on the Delta variant.
[27:07.240 --> 27:12.440]  I laid out that a lot of what the answers we get is because they say so without a lot
[27:12.440 --> 27:13.440]  of...
[27:13.440 --> 27:14.440]  Well, they're the experts.
[27:14.440 --> 27:15.440]  It's not just day.
[27:15.440 --> 27:16.440]  These are scientists.
[27:16.440 --> 27:17.440]  These are experts.
[27:17.440 --> 27:18.440]  I just said that...
[27:18.440 --> 27:19.440]  Hold on one second.
[27:19.440 --> 27:20.440]  Hold on one second.
[27:20.440 --> 27:27.360]  I just said that Dr. Lewinsky said just recently, in her 20-year career, she had never seen
[27:27.360 --> 27:30.040]  a variant that was so contagious.
[27:30.040 --> 27:32.040]  Let's shut her up.
[27:32.040 --> 27:35.280]  We told you a year ago they were going to say it's variants when it's really the vaccine
[27:35.280 --> 27:36.280]  killing people.
[27:36.280 --> 27:40.440]  It's these so-called experts that are all invested in the whole takeover who are depopulationists
[27:40.440 --> 27:41.440]  who are globalists.
[27:41.440 --> 27:42.440]  I think there's too many people.
[27:42.440 --> 27:46.400]  And then they try to censor the huge ocean of real scientists and doctors that say the
[27:46.400 --> 27:50.560]  opposite and victims and their families of what this deadly shot has done.
[27:50.560 --> 27:51.560]  So they made their move.
[27:51.560 --> 27:52.560]  They tried to suppress us.
[27:52.560 --> 27:56.120]  The truth got out and now you're all going to prison.
[27:56.120 --> 27:59.040]  The biosecurity state is here.
[27:59.040 --> 28:04.920]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad and evil.
[28:04.920 --> 28:10.040]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship
[28:10.040 --> 28:15.800]  of GCP and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines
[28:15.800 --> 28:21.480]  for every person in the country all the way out into 2024 and that in 2024 you will again
[28:21.480 --> 28:27.400]  take two shots and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[28:27.400 --> 28:29.120]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[28:29.120 --> 28:31.320]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[28:31.320 --> 28:35.600]  They're now implementing it and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private
[28:35.600 --> 28:36.600]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[28:36.600 --> 28:41.320]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois
[28:41.320 --> 28:45.400]  Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Home Institute
[28:45.400 --> 28:46.400]  in Germany.
[28:46.400 --> 28:48.200]  And Volwars will continue to set fast.
[28:48.200 --> 28:49.200]  They fight this.
[28:49.200 --> 28:50.200]  They don't know how long we can.
[28:50.200 --> 28:51.720]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[28:51.720 --> 28:53.120]  God bless and good luck.
[28:53.120 --> 28:55.600]  I would again get right with God right now.
[28:55.600 --> 29:01.000]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.320]  I've ever done.
[29:02.320 --> 29:06.720]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months
[29:06.720 --> 29:09.920]  in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[29:09.920 --> 29:11.960]  Well it's all come down to this.
[29:11.960 --> 29:17.720]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th.
[29:17.720 --> 29:25.840]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, Frankspeech.com.
[29:25.840 --> 29:31.720]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to Frankspeech.com now.
[29:31.720 --> 29:37.600]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever
[29:37.600 --> 29:42.600]  on my pillow products, but they're only offered at Frankspeech.com.
[29:42.600 --> 29:44.520]  Thank you and God bless.
[29:44.520 --> 29:53.640]  Go to Frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEKS or call 800-675-4614 and use promo
[29:53.640 --> 29:56.640]  code ALEKS.
[29:56.640 --> 29:59.720]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[29:59.720 --> 30:03.640]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[30:03.640 --> 30:04.640]  pass.
[30:04.640 --> 30:08.160]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[30:08.160 --> 30:12.320]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being
[30:12.320 --> 30:16.440]  totally enslaved, and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they
[30:16.440 --> 30:18.000]  are now making that move.
[30:18.000 --> 30:22.120]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[30:22.120 --> 30:27.800]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[30:27.800 --> 30:32.760]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[30:32.760 --> 30:38.400]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[30:38.400 --> 30:43.000]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[30:43.000 --> 30:49.000]  year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.920]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[30:51.920 --> 30:58.640]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[30:58.640 --> 31:22.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:22.480 --> 31:38.920]  The Western World, the egalitarian Christian ethos must be destroyed and discredited if
[31:38.920 --> 31:49.200]  the New World Order transhumanist post-human system is to take over and complete its goal.
[31:49.200 --> 31:52.920]  And they have not spent trillions of dollars in taking over the planet in the last hundred
[31:52.920 --> 32:00.240]  years to then, at the moment of truth, not execute their plan.
[32:00.240 --> 32:05.760]  But Satan has his plan and God has another plan, and we have to decide which plan we
[32:05.760 --> 32:13.480]  want to be part of, but make no mistake, you got front row seats to Armageddon.
[32:13.480 --> 32:20.960]  It's all happening, and happening very fast.
[32:20.960 --> 32:27.120]  And if your church isn't telling you about it, they're with the bad guy through the World
[32:27.120 --> 32:31.000]  Council of Churches and the Rockefeller Foundation, you might want to look into that, the National
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  Council of Churches and the rest of it.
[32:33.000 --> 32:39.120]  Your church is part of that, you know what's going on.
[32:39.120 --> 32:44.440]  Everyone comes to kill, steal, and destroy, and is that not what we see happening right
[32:44.440 --> 32:46.320]  now?
[32:46.320 --> 32:51.440]  And this system is very snake-like, very crafty.
[32:51.440 --> 32:56.840]  You notice what they're doing is discrediting every institution, the FBI, the police, by
[32:56.840 --> 33:07.520]  their actions, the family, the culture, manhood, motherhood.
[33:07.520 --> 33:12.560]  And now the medical system that's had its problems, but now is corporately internationally
[33:12.560 --> 33:29.200]  owned and is merged in a revolving, incessuous relationship
[33:29.200 --> 33:47.280]  with big tech, big pharma, big legacy dinosaur media, and then all the minions of academia
[33:47.280 --> 33:56.000]  in Hollywood, and all the organizations and groups that spiritually have thrown in there
[33:56.000 --> 34:10.240]  a lot with the Cosmic Con Artist to bring in this total planetary world government system.
[34:10.240 --> 34:14.480]  And all they do is play good cop, bad cop, the globalists come out and prepare their
[34:14.480 --> 34:19.320]  new lockdowns that never went away in most areas of the planet, and then Fauci comes
[34:19.320 --> 34:22.920]  out and says, oh no, no, we don't need new lockdowns, we just need more restrictions.
[34:22.920 --> 34:29.720]  We're not going to call it a lockdown because it's a permanent emergency.
[34:29.720 --> 34:34.000]  They call the beta a lockdown home arrest.
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.800]  They call the total takeover freedom day, and the bracelets you wear, the track you
[34:38.800 --> 34:44.280]  via GPS, freedom bracelets, and the microchips your children take, freedom chips, these are
[34:44.280 --> 34:50.800]  real names, real things happening as radical as anything I ever predicted happening just
[34:50.800 --> 34:55.960]  as we said it would, because it was always in the documents and the plans.
[34:55.960 --> 35:02.960]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote books in the 1970s that I read in the 1990s, early 1990s before
[35:02.960 --> 35:10.600]  I even got on air, where they said we'll have a technocracy that's run off of a digital
[35:10.600 --> 35:15.720]  and planet ship in your body, and we'll have records of everybody's activities, and if
[35:15.720 --> 35:20.040]  you don't conform to our new world order, you will be shot out of the system.
[35:20.040 --> 35:25.200]  He wrote that when I was three or four years old, and now his evil daughter hosts a show
[35:25.200 --> 35:32.800]  with Psycho Show on MSNBC.
[35:32.800 --> 35:36.360]  But I digress, let me just restate the obvious here, and then I want to open the phones up
[35:36.360 --> 35:42.320]  next hour, on the forced inoculations, on being told you're not essential, on being
[35:42.320 --> 35:47.560]  told you've got to stay in your house and not have a job and not have food, but when
[35:47.560 --> 35:53.200]  you go bankrupt, there won't be any money for you, literally declaring total war.
[35:53.200 --> 35:57.720]  That's what Hitler first did was say, oh, my political enemies can't have jobs and can't
[35:57.720 --> 36:00.600]  have businesses, then oh, you got to live in a ghetto, you're not allowed to leave your
[36:00.600 --> 36:04.200]  neighborhood, then you can't leave your house, and then oh, we're going to take you somewhere
[36:04.200 --> 36:08.920]  where you can, you know, pay for your first share as a forced laborer, and then you know
[36:08.920 --> 36:10.800]  what happened after that.
[36:10.800 --> 36:14.520]  And now we see all over the world, from Spain to Germany, to Australia, New Zealand, to
[36:14.520 --> 36:19.200]  the UK, to areas of the US, police, brutalizing men, women, and children, running over them
[36:19.200 --> 36:25.680]  with Clydesdale horses, water canning, splitting people's heads, because they dared go outside,
[36:25.680 --> 36:28.480]  you don't go outside ever.
[36:28.480 --> 36:35.040]  You don't get the rights of a Soviet citizen under Stalin.
[36:35.040 --> 36:41.840]  You're more of a slave than somebody in North Korea, and you shouldn't be allowed to leave
[36:41.840 --> 36:45.640]  your house or have a job unless you have a digital passport on your phone showing you
[36:45.640 --> 36:46.640]  have a shot.
[36:46.640 --> 36:50.080]  You tell the left, hey, the average, you know, that's a digital tracking system for a social
[36:50.080 --> 36:56.960]  credit score designed to have big tech takeover, and their own admissions, they go, shut up,
[36:56.960 --> 37:02.600]  Nazi, when they're the ones doing things that Hitler could only dream of.
[37:02.600 --> 37:07.600]  Men in black uniforms and black riot helmets beating up men, women, and children, because
[37:07.600 --> 37:08.680]  they dare go outside.
[37:08.680 --> 37:14.320]  And helicopters in Australia, when families try to go to the park or go to the beach saying,
[37:14.320 --> 37:21.800]  you will be arrested, leave now, leave now, you will all be arrested, screw you, you'll
[37:21.800 --> 37:24.360]  be arrested, criminals.
[37:24.360 --> 37:29.480]  They've had nine deaths in the last seven months in Australia, they claim are COVID, and they've
[37:29.480 --> 37:33.960]  set the precedent saying if there's one person with it, we'll never reopen, doesn't matter
[37:33.960 --> 37:39.040]  how many millions of suicides or deaths or bankruptcies, we're the heroes, stay in your
[37:39.040 --> 37:46.120]  house forever.
[37:46.120 --> 37:48.080]  Total complete tyranny.
[37:48.080 --> 37:51.000]  So let's lay it out.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  Let me just do this.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.160]  I'm going to come back in the next segment, I'm going to lay out what's about to happen,
[37:54.160 --> 38:00.320]  but it's now confirmed that people that are inoculated are the main groups, sick and dying.
[38:00.320 --> 38:07.080]  That's why Fauci kept saying 99% of the people that take the shot are safe, 99% of the people
[38:07.080 --> 38:12.880]  in the hospital are dying, didn't take the shot, all lies.
[38:12.880 --> 38:19.520]  Two weeks later, 75% of the people with COVID are sick and in hospitals, same in Israel,
[38:19.520 --> 38:24.400]  same in Singapore, same in the U.S., same in Germany, same in Canada have had the injection,
[38:24.400 --> 38:31.680]  and they're the majority of the folks dying of whatever's going on, but see they're already
[38:31.680 --> 38:37.680]  the subservient ones, so oh now they got to take another shot, and now Pfizer and Moderna
[38:37.680 --> 38:46.720]  just raised their prices worldwide, oh now you got to pay $300 for a shot, and they got
[38:46.720 --> 38:51.040]  the sheep lining up, and the sicker they get, give me another, oh god I got even sicker,
[38:51.040 --> 38:55.280]  so if you took a shotgun and blew one of your feet off, you go man that hurts, let me fix
[38:55.280 --> 39:00.960]  it, you just shot the angle, wow that hurts even worse, let me blow my leg off at the
[39:00.960 --> 39:05.280]  knee, maybe that'll fix it, first you blow your foot off, then you blow your calf off,
[39:05.280 --> 39:08.920]  then you blow your knee off, then you go you know what, this'll fix it, and you shove the
[39:08.920 --> 39:15.120]  shotgun barrel right in your mouth and pull the trigger, so I love Fauci, I mean that's
[39:15.120 --> 39:24.800]  how insane this is, that's how out of control this is, separately this is the last day to
[39:24.800 --> 39:28.120]  get 2020 prices on storeable foods, if you don't get storeable foods, and we got high
[39:28.120 --> 39:31.080]  quality ones ready to ship right now, at the lowest price you're going to find, this is
[39:31.080 --> 39:34.160]  the best deal you're going to find, we have the biggest, best company, had them for 13,
[39:34.160 --> 39:36.920]  14 years, they were a small company, we first got them, they've been the biggest for about
[39:36.920 --> 39:41.000]  five years, probably in the world, but definitely in the US, we have the entire MyPatriots supply
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.320]  catalog, they're just in our back end, we're partners, whether they take the orders, you
[39:45.320 --> 39:50.600]  get an additional 10% off, you're not going to get anywhere else, and it ends today 100%
[39:50.600 --> 39:55.440]  and then it doesn't come back until one week I'm allowed to do it in November, then their
[39:55.440 --> 39:58.440]  prices are going to go up, everybody else has already got a couple prices, but they bought
[39:58.440 --> 40:01.600]  a lot of food, big contracts, they're big enough to be able to actually do some of the
[40:01.600 --> 40:06.040]  same stuff Amazon or Walmart does, to buy so much damn food in a warehouse, he's got
[40:06.040 --> 40:09.200]  a warehouse in Salt Lake City, they've got five of them around the country, that looks
[40:09.200 --> 40:14.080]  like you could park a Star Destroyer in it, I've never been in a building that big, there's
[40:14.080 --> 40:18.640]  like mist at the end of it, it's so damn huge, full of food, and almost half that's been
[40:18.640 --> 40:23.680]  sold out, because he's just bringing in as fast as he can, but he knew what was coming,
[40:23.680 --> 40:29.320]  and smart guys, so they bought tons of it last year and this year to lock in those prices,
[40:29.320 --> 40:35.000]  but it's going up soon, so I would get it locked in now, infowarstore.com, or triple
[40:35.000 --> 40:43.080]  A2533139, triple A2533139, and this is the last week of X2 selling out, Deep Earth Crystal
[40:43.080 --> 40:47.960]  Ionite, stock up on that, infowarstore.com, your X2 selling out, and the last week of
[40:47.960 --> 40:54.360]  privacy pouches, to protect your privacy from contact tracers, at 50% off, $14.95.
[40:54.360 --> 40:58.880]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown, the first one has already
[40:58.880 --> 41:03.520]  destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death,
[41:03.520 --> 41:07.640]  and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[41:07.640 --> 41:10.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that's
[41:10.640 --> 41:16.080]  ready to ship, while you still can, at 2020 prices, we have the biggest, best company in

[43:00.840 --> 43:02.160]  I've ever done.

[43:06.560 --> 43:09.760]  in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[43:09.760 --> 43:11.800]  Well it's all come down to this.
[43:11.800 --> 43:17.560]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[43:17.560 --> 43:25.680]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform frankspeech.com.

[43:55.120 --> 44:00.480]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[44:00.480 --> 44:03.200]  from beta testing to operational.
[44:03.200 --> 44:07.960]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[44:07.960 --> 44:08.960]  takeover.
[44:08.960 --> 44:12.080]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working, and others have been
[44:12.080 --> 44:17.000]  working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.120]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible, and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[44:21.120 --> 44:22.560]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[44:22.560 --> 44:25.280]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[44:25.280 --> 44:29.520]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning
[44:29.520 --> 44:31.200]  others is absolutely essential.
[44:31.200 --> 44:35.720]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us

[44:58.520 --> 45:05.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[45:05.520 --> 45:34.520]  You take a mortal man, you put him in control, and put him in control.
[45:34.520 --> 46:00.520]  Watch him become a god, watch people's hands roll, roll, roll, roll.
[46:00.520 --> 46:24.080]  We are now in the symphony of destruction, the globalist fabled world government mark
[46:24.080 --> 46:27.760]  of the beast rollout.
[46:27.760 --> 46:32.320]  I'll never forget, there was a guy that put on for a couple of years, these events would
[46:32.320 --> 46:37.680]  get 200, 300, 500 people at him, called Texas Best Seminars, I forget his name, and one
[46:37.680 --> 46:42.040]  night after one of these seminars, I was one of the speakers, we went to dinner, a little
[46:42.040 --> 46:48.200]  diner, and I remember Wes was there, one of the first times I met Wes, he became one
[46:48.200 --> 46:52.280]  of our main engineers, and I'm sitting there eating pancakes at the counter with this guy,
[46:52.280 --> 46:55.840]  like nine at night, and I said, the mark of the beast, you know, it's going to be a micro
[46:55.840 --> 47:01.240]  chip in your hand, and they'll track you and control you if you're not on good terms with
[47:01.240 --> 47:06.120]  the government, and he goes, no, that's not it.
[47:06.120 --> 47:10.680]  A friend of mine at my church, wherever it was in East Texas, wherever, had a vision,
[47:10.680 --> 47:15.200]  and it's going to be a vaccine that changes all your DNA, and that actually makes you
[47:15.200 --> 47:18.920]  sick and ill, and you're going to have to have new shots all the time just to stay alive,
[47:18.920 --> 47:21.120]  it's a binary weapon.
[47:21.120 --> 47:25.920]  And my friend had this vision, and he got up from the church, he told everyone, and
[47:25.920 --> 47:29.760]  you know, my friend is never the type of guy to lie, and he said that basically God told
[47:29.760 --> 47:42.560]  him all this, and I'm like, okay, and I never forgot that, that's 25 years, 26 years later,
[47:42.560 --> 47:49.560]  and here we are, and I'll never forget that, because it just sunk in when he said it, he
[47:49.560 --> 47:54.760]  said it's a genetic mark, it takes over all your cells, it takes over every cell in your
[47:54.760 --> 47:57.920]  body, and he talked like five minutes, he got all, because I knew that guy, well, he's
[47:57.920 --> 48:00.960]  a nice guy, he didn't usually get wild eyed like I would, he got real wild eyed about
[48:00.960 --> 48:05.760]  it, like turn to me, so that's not what it is, this is it, and man, did that not turn
[48:05.760 --> 48:14.680]  out to be true, prophetic, you see, our enemies aren't dialed into that, but they're dialed
[48:14.680 --> 48:19.400]  into their own spiritual internet, and they're giving their spirit, their idea, their program
[48:19.400 --> 48:24.000]  and you know what it is, get their children, destroy their families, poison them, hurt
[48:24.000 --> 48:30.440]  yourself, cut yourself, kill yourself, imagine being without God, and all you hear is kill
[48:30.440 --> 48:34.640]  yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself, unless you go kidnap a little girl
[48:34.640 --> 48:39.180]  out of a backyard and torture her, then you feel good and empowered, and the demons tell
[48:39.180 --> 48:44.560]  you how wonderful you are, and how beautiful you are, and that's what almost every psychotic
[48:44.560 --> 48:49.280]  killer actually tells their psychiatrist and psychologist, and it's in the criminology books,
[48:49.280 --> 48:53.680]  but not on the national news, not on court TV, but I've interviewed a lot of the top
[48:53.680 --> 48:57.240]  psychiatrists to the quote serial killers, and I had several of them on, and I bring
[48:57.240 --> 49:03.800]  them up, they go, no, they say you're absolutely right, they feel alone and haunted by demons
[49:03.800 --> 49:11.840]  unless they're torturing a man, a woman, or a child, you call it an alternate ego, whatever
[49:11.840 --> 49:18.000]  it is, but certain demons want children, want a boy, want a girl, want a woman, want a
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.880]  man, certain demons want to kill a white person, certain demons want to kill a black person,
[49:22.880 --> 49:28.000]  and you can say, well whatever it is, maybe it's an artificial program, something left
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.680]  in our archetypal DNA, I don't know, I just know it's real, ladies and gentlemen, and
[49:33.680 --> 49:38.760]  if you're a clown swab or a Bill Gates, you want to murder people, and you want to murder
[49:38.760 --> 49:45.000]  their genetics, and you want to mutate them, and you want them to die slowly, and it makes
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.440]  you feel big and powerful, I mean Zbigniew Brzezinski would get up at speeches, and they
[49:49.440 --> 49:54.240]  would introduce him at the CFR about, he didn't run the Khmer Rouge that killed one-third
[49:54.240 --> 50:00.200]  of Cambodia and stopped the communist, which he has put something in even worse, but he
[50:00.200 --> 50:06.400]  had the Khmer Rouge do it, Zbigniew Brzezinski, I've read the transcript, he killed one-third
[50:06.400 --> 50:14.400]  of the country, they're all just like, oh glorious sir, glorious, and until you get
[50:14.400 --> 50:18.880]  your mind wrapped around that, there's no hope, until you realize these people are focused
[50:18.880 --> 50:27.600]  psychotic murderers who are simply working around the clock trying to figure out how
[50:27.600 --> 50:32.600]  they can get away with killing you, and if they can do it through a poisoned injection
[50:32.600 --> 50:37.720]  that grows prions in your body, that then sluffs off and makes other people sick, and
[50:37.720 --> 50:40.520]  then even say, hey, those of you that have the shot, you're the bad ones, you got to
[50:40.520 --> 50:45.280]  have more, then they're going to grow more and kill more of us, because they've murdered
[50:45.280 --> 50:51.200]  logic, because so many people don't have a spirit of discernment, if you reject a God,
[50:51.200 --> 50:58.400]  the program of understanding is withdrawn, the deeper you get into following God's directives,
[50:58.400 --> 51:00.960]  I don't know, a lot of you want to be able to handle this, and I think a lot of you
[51:00.960 --> 51:04.320]  already are handling it, I mean, look at that guy 25 years ago that everything was about
[51:04.320 --> 51:09.840]  to happen at all, unfolded, I just have a big platform, but let me tell you, I've been
[51:09.840 --> 51:13.480]  given a vision of what's going to happen, and I know now, not just off their own admissions,
[51:13.480 --> 51:17.080]  their own documents, but now I do understand what's going to happen from discernment even
[51:17.080 --> 51:23.520]  greater, and it's horrifying, but you know what, you're given that information so you
[51:23.520 --> 51:30.400]  can do something about it and stop it, not so you just curl up in a ball and crap yourself,
[51:30.400 --> 51:34.960]  so plead the blood of Jesus, ladies and gentlemen, that's all I can tell you, because you're
[51:34.960 --> 51:39.520]  getting front row seats to just evil turned loose, like, I mean, you're going to look
[51:39.520 --> 51:44.920]  back on 2021 like a cakewalk, you're going to look back on 2020 like a parade, you're
[51:44.920 --> 51:49.120]  going to look back on 2019 like sunshine at the beach, you're going to look back on those
[51:49.120 --> 51:55.920]  years like, you're going to look back on the worst years of your life, like they were heaven
[51:55.920 --> 52:00.960]  and what's going to happen, and don't just believe me, Klaus Schwab and all of us say,
[52:00.960 --> 52:08.880]  oh, this never ends, it only gets deeper, you will look back on COVID as a happy time,
[52:08.880 --> 52:15.080]  and what does George Soros say, he says on NPR in 60 minutes, it was the happiest time
[52:15.080 --> 52:21.280]  of my life rounding up the people, I called it happy making, my father, I, such confidence
[52:21.280 --> 52:25.960]  with the SS officers, arresting and taking the property, and I saw nothing wrong with
[52:25.960 --> 52:31.920]  it, I was fulfilling an area of the economy, if I had not done it, someone else would have,
[52:31.920 --> 52:38.600]  those are quotes, and the leftist thongs, they call us Nazis, oh, we love you, we love
[52:38.600 --> 52:45.280]  you George Soros, I mean, talk about grand illusion, you mean to play him saying all
[52:45.280 --> 52:53.400]  that, I can play it for you, it was the best time of my life, it was exhilarating, I called
[52:53.400 --> 53:04.520]  it happy making, happy making, would you like to happy make with me, and oh, oh, when George
[53:04.520 --> 53:09.120]  Soros is on the stage with Klaus Schwab, he hugs him and gets tears in his eyes, we're
[53:09.120 --> 53:22.160]  killing everyone, I feel so good, oh, but if you talk bad about Klaus Schwab, ADL say
[53:22.160 --> 53:29.120]  you Nazi, oh, okay ADL, and you look at the ADL leader, looks like his soul got sucked
[53:29.120 --> 53:37.200]  out by a giant satanic spider, thank God, we're not with that poor man, I pity these people
[53:37.200 --> 53:40.880]  ladies and gentlemen, they don't know God, they are cut off from God and they just have
[53:40.880 --> 53:50.800]  a sinister hate for all of us that love God, and they want to ravenously destroy us, yet
[53:50.800 --> 53:54.240]  now they're going to run, not just in the UK, all over the world, they're buying up all
[53:54.240 --> 54:02.480]  the COVID testing labs, because they're going to have your data and decide when you travel,
[54:02.480 --> 54:08.920]  all right, I'll start the next hour and I'll get into it, but here's the big takeaway ladies
[54:08.920 --> 54:14.680]  and gentlemen, here's the big takeaway, they admit the vaccines don't work and they admit
[54:14.680 --> 54:18.680]  it, the majority of people sick and dying are on them, and they admit they're infecting
[54:18.680 --> 54:26.080]  other people, likely predicted, and they don't even care and they say, oh, that's the reason,
[54:26.080 --> 54:30.320]  we trust the science and put more mask on you and control you, and it's the unvaccinated
[54:30.320 --> 54:35.240]  fault, you know, that doesn't have any logic, it's not supposed to have logic, it's meant
[54:35.240 --> 54:39.240]  to just make you turn your brain off, because you're being fed such crap and discredit what's
[54:39.240 --> 54:45.240]  left of our country before it collapses, maximum red alerts to headline today for the show,
[54:45.240 --> 54:51.200]  major governments confirmed COVID-19 vaccinated, spreading new deadly plague, hospitals were
[54:51.200 --> 54:55.720]  empty last year, that was all the hoax, they're full right now, COVID-19, new deadly coronavirus
[54:55.720 --> 55:03.120]  variant that could kill 1 in 3 infected people, a realistic possibility says the UK government,
[55:03.120 --> 55:07.920]  what that really means is ever one-third of the pop public, or a large portion of those
[55:07.920 --> 55:10.520]  that are vaccinated, which they now admit the majority are vaccinated, are going to
[55:10.520 --> 55:14.280]  be dying and they're going to call it a new variant, when it's what is growing in your
[55:14.280 --> 55:17.840]  body, the spike protein that's killing you, that all the studies and all the scientists
[55:17.840 --> 55:24.360]  and all the facts show, and the highest vaccinated places, Israel, Iceland, Gibraltar, have the
[55:24.360 --> 55:31.200]  highest levels of people in the hospital dying of COVID-19, but like the White House, Deputy
[55:31.200 --> 55:37.360]  Press Secretary said, because the experts say so, okay, your calls and a ton of news
[55:37.360 --> 55:44.920]  and a lot more coming up in hour number two, infowars.com.
[55:44.920 --> 55:49.800]  Hello I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've
[55:49.800 --> 55:54.560]  ever done. All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five
[55:54.560 --> 56:01.280]  months in my efforts to bring the truth forward. Well, it's all come down to this. I'm having
[56:01.280 --> 56:08.760]  a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th. This historical event will be live streamed
[56:08.760 --> 56:17.040]  72 hours straight on my new platform, frankspeech.com. You can help by getting everybody you know
[56:17.040 --> 56:24.600]  to go to frankspeech.com now. To help support the cyber symposium event, I am offering
[56:24.600 --> 56:31.240]  some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at frankspeech.com.
[56:31.240 --> 56:41.520]  Thank you and God bless. Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code Alex or call 800-675-4614
[56:41.520 --> 56:50.600]  and use promo code Alex. There's one central fact of criminal psychology
[56:50.600 --> 56:57.080]  that criminologists all agree on and that its criminals are extremely pathological, even
[56:57.080 --> 57:01.240]  more the general public. They do the same things over and over again and criminals like
[57:01.240 --> 57:07.880]  to commit the same types of crimes over and over again. Well guess what? It was Anthony
[57:07.880 --> 57:14.960]  Fauci, a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it
[57:14.960 --> 57:18.960]  with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were
[57:18.960 --> 57:24.400]  the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the t-lint besides
[57:24.400 --> 57:29.960]  the body and create autoimmune disorders. The problem for them was the viruses would
[57:29.960 --> 57:35.120]  then break down and would be non-lethal down the road. That's why they need to roll out
[57:35.120 --> 57:39.520]  the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your
[57:39.520 --> 57:48.640]  immune system basically giving you the equivalent of HIV. That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[57:48.640 --> 58:06.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. I didn't accept two of the five people were
[58:06.600 --> 58:14.200]  appointed. They have made statements and taken actions that I think would impact the
[58:14.200 --> 58:19.640]  integrity of the commission of the committee. The real reason the Democrats don't want to
[58:19.640 --> 58:25.600]  investigate the evolution of the rioting that kicked off seven years earlier with the riots
[58:25.600 --> 58:32.840]  in Ferguson, Missouri that mutated into Marxist violence during Trump's inauguration and exploded
[58:32.840 --> 58:41.080]  into 567 riots killing at least 25 people doing well over $2 billion worth of damage
[58:41.080 --> 58:46.400]  and targeting federal state and local government buildings after the death of George Floyd
[58:46.400 --> 58:51.520]  greased by Cloward and Piven on our southern border. We are learning new details about
[58:51.520 --> 58:56.640]  the man who threw explosive devices at an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington
[58:56.640 --> 59:01.440]  who was shot and killed by police and an apparent fraudulent election that no one in Congress
[59:01.440 --> 59:07.600]  would transparently explain eventually led to the cause and effect response at the Capitol
[59:07.600 --> 59:14.440]  on January 6th. This is the investigation that needs to take place. Democrats abandoned
[59:14.440 --> 59:20.600]  their constitutional duty and embraced the dark forces of their closeted bigotry and
[59:20.600 --> 59:27.160]  fanned the flames of political tyranny and their lust for power. Power they would shamefully
[59:27.160 --> 59:33.000]  shed crocodile tears for in a recent sham hearing. Power the Capitol police would lie
[59:33.000 --> 59:39.360]  for in order to designate the rest of those in their way as domestic terrorists. The terrorists
[59:39.360 --> 59:44.560]  alternated between attempting break our defenses and shouting at or attempting to convert us.
[59:44.560 --> 59:49.680]  And we are being told this is the worst attack against democracy since the civil war which
[59:49.680 --> 59:56.040]  is ludicrous. In 1915 a German man who had been a Harvard professor detonated a bomb
[59:56.040 --> 1:00:01.160]  inside the Capitol and attempted to deter the U.S. from entering World War I. The bomber
[1:00:01.160 --> 1:00:07.200]  also murdered his pregnant wife and shot financier J.P. Morgan Jr. Was it worse than the attack
[1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:12.920]  on Congress by Lolita Lebron in 1954 who Jimmy Carter pardoned?
[1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:21.960]  Firing more than 20 rounds from the Luga automatics, the three fanatics seriously wounded five
[1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:26.520]  senators. Alvin Bentley wounded near the heart and in the stomach and Representative
[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:31.000]  Halleck shows where a bullet ripped into his desk. Another Puerto Rican has since been
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:36.920]  accused of threatening to kill President Eisenhower. Still defiant and still unrepentant, Mrs. Lebron
[1:00:36.920 --> 1:00:43.000]  and her partners made the attack to draw attention to Puerto Rico's demands for complete independence.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:46.880]  At one minute before one o'clock this morning the switchboard at the Capitol received a
[1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:52.320]  phone call. A man's voice said a bomb would go off in the building in half an hour. At
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:57.840]  1.30 in the morning it did in a small unmarked restroom on the ground floor of the Senate
[1:00:57.840 --> 1:01:03.560]  side next to a barbershop and near several small offices including one committee hearing
[1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:08.760]  room. There were telephone bomb threats to 22 other Washington buildings yesterday and
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:14.040]  two more today all false alarms. Credit for the Capitol bombing was claimed in a letter
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:18.680]  received by the Associated Press today signed by the weather underground.
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:23.560]  Ho Chi Minh's birthday was also marked in Washington. A bomb exploded early this morning
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:28.480]  in the Pentagon and left wing terrorists telephoned newspapers to say they were responsible. It's
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:32.800]  hard to argue with the effectiveness of that bomb that went off in a third floor washroom
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:37.880]  here at the State Department early this morning. Was it worse than Susan Rosenberg's bombing
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:45.200]  of the US Capitol's North Wing in 1983? Rosenberg was pardoned by Bill Clinton in 2001 and is
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:51.120]  now a powerful leader of the BLM movement. An anti-American communist movement that should
[1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:56.640]  be imprisoned under Eisenhower's Communist Control Act of 1954. I want to ask you about
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:02.600]  Black Lives Matter. Its finances and some of its fundraising is actually managed by
[1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:12.480]  an activist group. Thousand currents which is sponsored by a charity set up by the Kellogg's
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:17.840]  founder of your breakfast cereal. It has a woman Susan Rosenberg sitting on its board
[1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:23.120]  of directors once arrested for her ties to a radical left terrorist group responsible
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:28.280]  for killing police and bombing. The fact is most of the political prisoners sitting in
[1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:34.320]  Biden's tomb like prison were waved into a US Capitol that wasn't burned to the ground
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:40.880]  or destroyed from within because those so-called insurrectionists were patriotic Americans
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:48.320]  that the Democrat Marxist regime had pushed too far and everybody knows it. Enough of
[1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:55.520]  the charade, those so-called insurrectionists need to be freed today. John Bown reporting.
[1:02:55.520 --> 1:03:00.640]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that

[1:03:52.520 --> 1:04:12.240]  and use promo code Alex. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:22.960]  front lines of the Info War. Well, it's not just Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones and Senator
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:26.200]  Rand Paul pointing out the whole COVID rollout and operation of psychological warfare and
[1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:32.120]  putting us into a form of subservient martial law under the directives of the United Nations.
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:38.680]  Now it's Bill Maher coming out in the last three weeks in a row saying, America's looks
[1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:43.400]  like the Soviet Union. The Olympics look like the Soviet Union or North Korea. The
[1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:47.160]  left's completely out of control. And some listeners saw me cut a report on that on Saturday
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:50.800]  and they said, don't say nice things about Bill Maher. I don't trust Bill Maher as far
[1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:55.040]  as I could throw him. But what does it say about Bill Maher that he knows his whole audience
[1:04:55.040 --> 1:05:00.280]  is pissed off about the second lockdown, knows the massacre fraud, and knows that everything
[1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:04.400]  we're seeing around the world is dangerous? He said, let people have ivermectin, stop
[1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:11.400]  suppressing drugs, big text lying. You know, there are a lot of people that have worked
[1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:15.280]  with the system who might decide the system's going to destroy them. And if they're going
[1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:20.440]  to come join us or at least start agreeing with us, we need to roll the red carpet out
[1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:26.040]  and say, not going to turn my back on you. But I would sure like to see you start telling
[1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:30.000]  the truth all the time. And when you do it, I'm going to praise you. I mean, Tucker Carlson
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:35.480]  thought I was a horrible person 14, 15 years ago. And then I'm not going to give the whole
[1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:39.000]  story privately called me and said, well, I see you're right about a lot of stuff. And
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:43.320]  you mean well. And then we became friends over the years. I'm going to leave it at
[1:05:43.320 --> 1:05:46.920]  that. Now we're good friends and the media hates that and knows that and Tucker doesn't
[1:05:46.920 --> 1:05:51.640]  hide that. And it's just the way it is. But people can look at Tucker show and say, wow,
[1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:56.400]  it sounds like Alex Jones wrote this. No, Tucker sees it now and sees it as good as
[1:05:56.400 --> 1:06:01.120]  I do or better. He doesn't need my help. He just was naive and thought other people were
[1:06:01.120 --> 1:06:05.440]  nice like him. He projected the fact that he's a nice guy and believe the government
[1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:08.920]  really wanted to help people. And then he finally woke up about 10 years ago. And now
[1:06:08.920 --> 1:06:15.200]  he's super woke, you know, the real woke. Because see, I'm not trying to get you to
[1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:22.200]  see through my eyes. I'm just trying to get you to see take the rowdy Piper allegory of
[1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:27.720]  they live. He's not trying to get his black construction partner friend to do what he
[1:06:27.720 --> 1:06:33.480]  wants to be his life. He's not trying to make him believe him just because he told him he
[1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:38.120]  wants him to put the glasses on. Start putting these glasses on or start eating concrete.
[1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:44.880]  They have a big long fight. They almost kill each other. But in the end, he gets the glasses
[1:06:44.880 --> 1:06:51.400]  on him. And he's like, Oh my God, how long has this been going on? What the hell's going
[1:06:51.400 --> 1:06:55.360]  on? And now he didn't want to fight with Piper and Piper don't want to fight with him because
[1:06:55.360 --> 1:07:02.000]  now they understand they're both under attack. So I don't want to fight with the Democrats.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:09.680]  I don't want to fight with CNN. I don't want to fight with black rifle copy company. I
[1:07:09.680 --> 1:07:18.560]  don't want to be involved in all this stupidness. I want you to put the damn glasses on. And
[1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:27.400]  right now, folks, things are so serious and so real. There is no way you can't see the
[1:07:27.400 --> 1:07:36.920]  glasses are on regardless. You're just denying what you see right in front of your face and
[1:07:36.920 --> 1:07:41.640]  how much more pain we got to go through until you finally realize you've been conned. You
[1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:46.680]  finally realize you've been lied to and you finally realize that only waking up and waking
[1:07:46.680 --> 1:07:53.760]  other people up is going to give us any type of hope. Just put the glasses on and look
[1:07:53.760 --> 1:08:00.840]  at it. Look at it. It's not denied. All you got to have is a little bit of memory and think
[1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:04.080]  back to what's going on and you're going to see it right there in front of you and believe
[1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:09.160]  me, baby, just like Morpheus says in the matrix, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
[1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:14.600]  You take the blue pill, you go back to Wonderland, you take the red pill and I show you how deep
[1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:27.480]  it goes. And you put the glasses on, folks, and you see people feeding on you and your
[1:08:27.480 --> 1:08:32.080]  family predators. I want to give the number out specifically. I want to cover last hour
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:37.520]  to give us your story of vaccines, your family story of vaccines. You love them. You hate
[1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:49.360]  them. Again, they're not vaccines, these genetically modified injections. And I'm going to recap
[1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:53.040]  these headlines for you in case you're a new listener and then we're going to go to your
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:09:00.040]  calls. But you understand, this is very elementary. Obviously, they were always going to infect
[1:09:00.040 --> 1:09:05.480]  people with a spike protein. We didn't just say that now and it's not just admitted now.
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:12.320]  Let's admit it. We showed you all the medical literature we had the experts on that in every
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:17.640]  mammal study with these shots, they've done it forever. For 50 years longer, they've been
[1:09:17.640 --> 1:09:23.840]  trying to find a vaccine for the common cold. But because the common cold is caused by a
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:29.480]  giant spectrum of different proteins, when your body gets out of whack, you get sick.
[1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:34.960]  They call them viruses. If you create something to target that, it will attack your own body.
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:43.120]  And now it's happened. And now they admit worldwide the average number is 75% of the
[1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:49.520]  infections in Austin, Texas, of the infections in Massachusetts, of the infections in Israel,
[1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:55.240]  of the infections in Gibraltar, of the infections in Singapore, of the infections everywhere
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:10:02.680]  are the vaccinated. And the people are being studied and tested and they all have blood
[1:10:02.680 --> 1:10:11.360]  clots in the de-dieter test, which is a very old documented real test. And they're infectious
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:22.640]  giving you a synthetic, digitally created prion code that is growing in people. So it's
[1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:29.080]  all confirmed now. Exactly what the former chief scientist of operations at Pfizer said
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:38.440]  he only retired two years ago. What the chief EU advisor said, what the Dean of Baylor Medical
[1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:42.800]  School said to Congress, I didn't even know this. We haven't months ago, I saw the clip
[1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:51.240]  last night, played it, saw it yesterday, played last night. I mean, this is crazy that they
[1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:57.360]  actually did it. Here it is. Maximum red alert, major governments confirmed COVID-19 vaccine
[1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:03.880]  spreading, new deadly plague. Here sky news, COVID-19, new deadly coronavirus variant that
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:08.840]  could kill one in three infected people. A realistic possibility says the British government
[1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:14.640]  officially sages the agency. And they say normally things mutate and become less lethal.
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:18.240]  This is becoming more lethal. I don't know if that's true or not. I just know it's their
[1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:24.320]  cover for everybody getting sick and dying has taken the shots. And I just know that
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:28.240]  I know a lot of people in medical care. And so I conducted my own survey the last few
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:31.600]  weeks because I noticed a lot of people I know were been very sick with lung stuff.
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:34.480]  But they're told, oh, no, you don't get COVID when you go in to get tested because they
[1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:39.440]  don't want the numbers up yet. They turn the PCR test down. And then I taught people that
[1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:42.400]  work in hospitals. They said, no, we're full of people can't breathe. And they're almost
[1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:47.160]  all vaccinated. So I was telling you that weeks ago, here it is in the reports. Remember
[1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:51.480]  Israel first came out, said this three weeks ago, they said, oh, they're crazy. They had
[1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:58.240]  six million people in their study. But the White House Press Secretary says, trust the
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:03.440]  experts do what we say. Oh, I do trust all the real experts, not you and not Fauci. Here
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:09.920]  it is Gibraltar, Iceland see massive COVID spike despite over 90% population vaccinated.
[1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:15.920]  Vaccinated people think 75% of recent COVID cases in Singapore. Majority of COVID-19 cases
[1:12:15.920 --> 1:12:23.720]  at large public events were among vaccinated Americans. And it goes on and on and on and
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:30.400]  on. They're trying to blame the unvaccinated. That's just some of what I've got right here.
[1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:35.480]  I want to take your call on this. I want to hear what you have to say. I want your view
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:39.160]  and what you're witnessing. If you're a medical worker, a doctor, a nurse, are you seeing full
[1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:42.680]  areas? Because you called in last year and said it was a hoax. It wasn't. We went and
[1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:48.360]  proved it was. I'm hearing it is full. After you took the shot, see how the plan works.
[1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:51.400]  And then in the winter, it gets really bad and they blame the unvaccinated. They're already
[1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:59.040]  trying that, but the truth's getting out ahead of them. Total three number to join us is 877-789-2539
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:09.880]  877-789. Alex, 877-789-2539. Four people specifically with what you've witnessed, what you've seen,
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:16.000]  your take on this. And again, I don't just believe the British Ministry of Defense and
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:20.760]  the NIH or their National Health Service. I don't just believe them when they say this
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:23.720]  could kill a third of the people on earth, but I know that's the globalist goal is to
[1:13:23.720 --> 1:13:27.720]  kill 90%. And I know they rolled out a vaccine that doesn't protect it. It isn't a vaccine
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:32.280]  that grows prions of the people. I know the folks running under depopulation is so we
[1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:36.360]  expected this. It's here and they're actually did it. They think you're so dumb medically
[1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:40.000]  they're going to get away with this. Kind of like the beta test was hundreds of millions
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.720]  of boys being autistic for vaccines and big pharma getting away with that. Well, they
[1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:48.200]  said, hell, let's just hit everybody then. And all the folks that signed on to be vaccinated
[1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:51.880]  or injected, they won't want to admit they got conned. They'll just double down with
[1:13:51.880 --> 1:13:54.160]  Stockholm syndrome.
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:59.800]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material
[1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:04.240]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:09.160]  and degrade targeted pollutants. For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public
[1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:14.040]  market a suite of bio remediation products to the everyday consumer. Their first product
[1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:18.880]  they are launching is called bioseptic pro, a product specifically designed to establish
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:24.160]  a healthy septic system. Bio septic pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes
[1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:28.560]  like its competitors. This stuff lives in your septic system. It's really like probiotics
[1:14:28.560 --> 1:14:34.200]  for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:38.600]  due to its revolutionary patented delivery system. Bio septic pro contains no chemical
[1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:44.120]  ingredients and no genetically modified organisms. Visit the bio pros dot com today and protect
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:49.680]  your septic system. That's the bio pros dot com. This is for anaerobic septic tanks and
[1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:54.680]  the job it does is unparalleled. The bio pros dot com.
[1:14:54.680 --> 1:15:00.920]  The bio security state is here. It's an anti human eugenics operation training us that
[1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:07.440]  humans are dirty, bad and evil. The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada says he admires
[1:15:07.440 --> 1:15:12.760]  the communist dictatorship of GCP and wishes to make Canada sane, has announced that they're
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:19.720]  buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024. And that in 2024
[1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:24.440]  you will again take two shots. And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:29.160]  to put in your body. This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan
[1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:32.960]  with Bill Gates. They're now implementing it and now they've announced that U.S. policy
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:37.160]  is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation. Of course the Rockefeller Foundation by the
[1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:42.600]  30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that
[1:15:42.600 --> 1:15:46.560]  trained the Cosworth Hill Home Institute in Germany. And Volwars will continue to set
[1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:50.360]  fast. They fight this. I don't know how long we can. The enemy's coming for us all now.
[1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:56.720]  God bless and good luck. I would again get right with God right now.
[1:15:56.720 --> 1:15:59.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:38.920]  You will stand up against Bill Gates today. What a wonderful day it'd be. Well, you better
[1:16:38.920 --> 1:16:50.520]  learn. Well, you better find out. You better learn about democide and eugenicists. This
[1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:56.520]  ain't all about you. You do know that one and one is two and that the vaccine doesn't
[1:16:56.520 --> 1:17:02.640]  protect you and it makes people show up as COVID positive because you're growing prions
[1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:08.440]  in your body that will then kill you over the next two to five years according to all
[1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:13.600]  the studies and according to all the top scientists. And I'm going to place some clips of those
[1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:20.520]  scientists here in a moment and then go to your phone calls at 877-789-2539. But since
[1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:31.240]  I mentioned it, here is Bill Maher this Friday talking about how the Olympics belong in Stalin's
[1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:39.040]  Russia. Here it is. That joke in a private conversation. This is called a purge. It's
[1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:44.880]  a mentality that belongs in Stalin's Russia. How bad is this atmosphere we are living in
[1:17:44.880 --> 1:17:50.720]  have to get before the people who say cancel culture is overblown admit that is in fact
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:18:08.000]  an insanity that is swallowing up the world. I'm back. Not the audience. I'm back. There's
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:13.480]  still and that is not a conservative position. My friends, my politics have not changed, but
[1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:20.200]  I am reacting to politics that have. And this is yet another example of how the woke invert
[1:18:20.200 --> 1:18:25.800]  the very thing that used to make liberals liberals snitches and bitches. That's not
[1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:32.600]  being liberal. The Associated Press is a real news organization. Yeah. So I am I reading
[1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:41.600]  this headline Olympic surfing exposes whitewash native Hawaiian roots. Now, I'm going to go
[1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:45.080]  to your phone calls. But since I mentioned this, let me play you a few of these clips.
[1:18:45.080 --> 1:18:52.520]  I played more than 20 scientists and doctors yesterday. Prestigious ones. I played the
[1:18:52.520 --> 1:19:00.160]  clip of the inventor of M RNA pointing out their greatest fear would be that it would
[1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:05.520]  create antibody dependent enhancement. And it's done that. And it's causing mass death
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:10.560]  already. And then they go on to warn that it'll grow the protein in your body and kill
[1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:14.440]  you. It just so happens to attack the ovaries. Oh, gee, isn't that funny? That's in major
[1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:22.640]  studies as well. But oh, trust the science of Bill Gates. He's your doctor. Don't other
[1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:27.800]  doctors can't be online. I've got stacks of articles of prestigious journalists that just
[1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:32.080]  reported Pfizer's own studies that they're now doing on the experimental shot. That's
[1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:38.720]  the cart before the horse and saying, Oh, we had the same death rate in placebo versus
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:46.400]  who took the vaccine. And so they published that. And it got banned off Twitter. Just
[1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:52.280]  like YouTube just banned Sky TV, Australia, because they reported the same thing, because
[1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:56.320]  they're trying to suppress you while they kill you. So you go out and take it so they
[1:19:56.320 --> 1:20:00.320]  can hurt you. It's not just informed consent being violated. It's the opposite. They're
[1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:07.840]  suppressing you finding out what's going on. The definition of forced consent. Don lemon.
[1:20:07.840 --> 1:20:11.920]  Oh, you can't have food. Oh, you can't have water. In fact, let's play that first. Don
[1:20:11.920 --> 1:20:20.840]  lemon. This is the talking point everywhere. Same. You can be able to have food. You shouldn't
[1:20:20.840 --> 1:20:25.800]  be able to have a job. You should be in a concentration camp. Basically, you should starve to death.
[1:20:25.800 --> 1:20:30.600]  If you don't take this experimental shot, the definition of violating the number code coerced
[1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:35.480]  medical experimentation. Here it is. I don't know. I'm sure a lot of people are not going
[1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:41.040]  to agree with this, but don't get the vaccine. You can't go to the supermarket. Don't have
[1:20:41.040 --> 1:20:45.160]  the vaccine. You don't show it. Can't go to the ball game. Don't have the vaccine. Can't
[1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:51.400]  go to work. You don't have the vaccine. Can't come here. No shirt. No shoes. No service.
[1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:55.480]  That's what I think we should be right now. Okay, continue to waste. Anybody that follows
[1:20:55.480 --> 1:21:01.080]  him is a lemon head in my view. Let's go ahead and go to Dr. Hoats, Dean of Baylor Science
[1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:07.240]  and Medicine, one of the most respected medical schools in the United States, testifying to
[1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:13.560]  Congress. I know this happened about the dangers of these type of vaccines. Here it is. One
[1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:18.760]  of the things that we're not hearing a lot about is the unique potential safety problem
[1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:25.680]  of coronavirus vaccines. When we started developing coronavirus vaccines and our colleagues,
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:31.080]  we noticed in laboratory animals that they started to show some of the same pathology
[1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:35.560]  that resembled what had happened 50 years earlier. We said, oh my God, this is going
[1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:40.600]  to be problematic. We don't entirely understand the basis of it, but we recognize that it's
[1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:46.960]  a real problem for certain respiratory virus vaccines. This was first found in the early
[1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:53.280]  1960s with the respiratory syncytial virus vaccines. Some of those kids who got the vaccine
[1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:57.920]  actually did worse and I believe there were two deaths in the consequence of that study
[1:21:57.920 --> 1:22:03.160]  because what happens with certain types of respiratory virus vaccines, you get immunized
[1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:08.120]  and then when you get actually exposed to the virus, you get this kind of paradoxical
[1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:15.240]  immune enhancement phenomenon. We don't entirely understand the basis of it, but we recognize
[1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:20.560]  that it's a real problem for certain respiratory virus vaccines. That killed the RSV program
[1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:25.760]  for decades. Now the Gates Foundation is taking it up again, but when we started developing
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:30.800]  coronavirus vaccines and our colleagues, we noticed in laboratory animals that they
[1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:36.480]  started to show some of the same pathology that resembled what had happened 50 years
[1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:41.280]  earlier. So we said, oh my God, this is going to be problematic. By the way, that's one
[1:22:41.280 --> 1:22:47.320]  of the top tropical disease experts in the world and this is counted as a tropical disease.
[1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:51.160]  He helped run the program. I looked it up with the University of Texas and Fauci on
[1:22:51.160 --> 1:22:55.680]  the rat study 2012 and said, do not do this in humans. It'll kill him. So there he was
[1:22:55.680 --> 1:23:01.560]  in March of last year. So that's a year and a half ago almost specifically telling Congress,
[1:23:01.560 --> 1:23:08.320]  don't do this. It never worked. See how that works? Let's go to Dr. Robert Malone last
[1:23:08.320 --> 1:23:11.600]  week again, the inventor of mRNA saying the same thing.
[1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:18.720]  This is the great fear that all vaccinologists have. This is the one thing that scares us
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:24.680]  all the most in a crop up in the 1960s with the development of the pediatric vaccine for
[1:23:24.680 --> 1:23:34.360]  respiratory syncytial virus. Vaccines are known can cause enhanced disease. Some vaccines
[1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:41.320]  make disease worse. The classic example of this phenomena of antibody dependent enhancement
[1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:46.080]  in which the antibodies actually make it possible for the virus to infect cells that it wouldn't
[1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:52.320]  otherwise infect. The classic example is dengue. When we get dengue the first time, there's
[1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:56.720]  four different strains of dengue. They're enough different that if you get the second
[1:23:56.720 --> 1:24:02.040]  strain that's different, it'll cause dengue hemorrhagic fever. That's what kills you.
[1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:08.280]  This phenomena was also seen with the dengue vaccine and caused the death of each one.
[1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:17.560]  So let's let this sink in real slow here. You just heard two top scientists in the world
[1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:22.400]  telling you that in every case they've had to abandon these programs because it kills
[1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:28.800]  the animals and kills the people until Bill Gates resuscitated it a few years ago and
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:33.160]  launched it on us because he knew it was a great weapon. Oh, he got this failed program
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:38.720]  that kills everybody. Oh, Bill Gates got it. Oh, Bill Gates wants to kill us. It's out
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:43.920]  in the open. It's all open and shut. Do you believe this? Are you going to roll your sleeve
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:47.720]  up like human sacrifice and give this to your kids? Because now they've announced, I'll tell
[1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:51.200]  you about when we come back. They're coming after kids now. Your phone calls are straight
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:52.200]  ahead.
[1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:59.400]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:24:59.400 --> 1:25:08.160]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:17.840]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves, worst-in-slaves.
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:25.320]  It's just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:31.200]  of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control. We have to recognize the
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:35.640]  great reset post-industrial world that realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote
[1:25:35.640 --> 1:25:41.280]  liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia. It's that choice. It's that
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:46.400]  realization that's going to change the world. And it's the only choice we've got, freedom
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:51.280]  or slavery, go to evil. It is a spiritual battle, an info wars at the tip of the spearfighting
[1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:52.280]  it.
[1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:57.880]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[1:25:57.880 --> 1:26:02.240]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:06.520]  the years and has truly been answered a prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:10.680]  you, the listeners of this show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:14.320]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter you got red
[1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:18.960]  blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we
[1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:24.240]  are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:28.880]  with you over the years. And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:34.280]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works through
[1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:39.360]  you and puts a message in your heart to support us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:43.280]  with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:48.320]  you've done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you
[1:26:48.320 --> 1:26:51.840]  and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless.

[1:32:03.400 --> 1:32:11.800]  We've got Josh in Florida. First up, the owl killer. Go ahead, Josh. Hey, Alex. Crazy
[1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:16.880]  times. I want to give you a quick product plug. Give you a vaccine story and then make
[1:32:16.880 --> 1:32:23.360]  a quick prediction. Your vitamin mineral fusion and iodine changed my life. I hope you guys
[1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:32.160]  get your silver products back in soon. And yeah, for the vaccine story, my mom, my aunt,
[1:32:32.160 --> 1:32:38.880]  their twins, she, I'm not sure what shot she got, but about four days after she had to
[1:32:38.880 --> 1:32:45.640]  go in and get a stint in her heart and they just chopped that up to her having, you know,
[1:32:45.640 --> 1:32:50.200]  already having heart problems. Even though it says if you have heart problems particularly,
[1:32:50.200 --> 1:32:56.480]  it can give you a heart attack. I mean, that that is admitted. Isn't that crazy? Yeah,
[1:32:56.480 --> 1:33:00.680]  it's crazy. And what I feel like they're going to do is for 2024, they're going to do the
[1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:08.040]  switcheroo to put the nail in the Trump coffin. So they're going to they didn't give him credit
[1:33:08.040 --> 1:33:14.040]  at first for the vaccine because they wanted to get Biden in. Now they'll give him credit
[1:33:14.040 --> 1:33:20.560]  and say, hey, this vaccine was a big mess. It's all the Trump, it's all Trump's fault.
[1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:26.360]  And that's a way for him to lose 2024. We're also going to see the crypto crash with the
[1:33:26.360 --> 1:33:32.760]  regulations and the internet crash. And you get to other phone calls and appreciate Alex.
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:38.360]  Brother, I appreciate you. That's a whole other topic I'm going to do someday this week
[1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:42.600]  is Trump because people are mad at Trump. And they want to make it all about Trump. I know
[1:33:42.600 --> 1:33:46.680]  the inside baseball. I know what Trump thought. I know he got conned. I know he did a lot
[1:33:46.680 --> 1:33:51.000]  of good. He did some bad. I know the globalist haters guts. They don't want him to get Republicans
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:56.320]  elected in the midterms. So they love anybody that'll attack Trump on the right. It's promoted
[1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:00.780]  on Twitter and Facebook. That's why they always attack Trump constantly. Hey, Trump deserves
[1:34:00.780 --> 1:34:06.000]  me criticized, but still supported to get good Republicans elected. But but oh, you know,
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:10.040]  Alex Jones isn't good. He doesn't bash Trump enough. Notice those guys don't spend much
[1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:14.800]  time on Biden do that. That's because they're double agents working for the Democrats, even
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:18.440]  if they don't know it, they don't want to get banned off Twitter and Facebook in places.
[1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:22.680]  So it's not a lesser of two evils that criticize Trump. What he's wrong. I said he better get,
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:28.080]  you know, against these vaccines, you better turn against it. He hasn't. And it's a big
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:32.720]  problem. And yes, he will get blamed for it when it all comes out. And so it's a disaster.
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:38.520]  It's absolutely horrible. I'm worried about the midterms right now, because we need to
[1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:44.640]  get good hardcore folks elected like Marjorie Green Taylor and others. And we can defeat
[1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:49.040]  the globalist. We need a bunch of people. So it's not just one guy that can target.
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:55.000]  All right. Thank you for the call. Owl killer from Virginia. Go ahead. You're a retired
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:35:03.120]  military vet on vaccines. What's coming next? Tell us. So first off, Alex, where's the unvaccized
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:08.480]  matter shirt? Because that will be a huge hit. And I got the entire NYPD that wants to save
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:13.320]  the frogs t-shirt and black and green. So as soon as you get those in stock, they're going
[1:35:13.320 --> 1:35:19.120]  to fly right off the shelf. So this is where I see things going. You ever get the feeling
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:25.400]  that we're willing this into existence? Because that's the feeling that I get because every
[1:35:25.400 --> 1:35:31.760]  time I see what's going on and I see you predict these things 15 and 20 years ahead of time,
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:38.560]  there's the deal. The globalists have to have something that we're totally unaware of because
[1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:45.000]  man to man will kick their heads off their shoulders. And that's the one thing that has
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.640]  me scared is what do they really have up their sleeve? What they have is evil will to carry
[1:35:49.640 --> 1:35:54.080]  out evil and a bunch of sheep that follow orders while they wear these fancy outfits
[1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:59.800]  and these costumes and strut around in front of us. But we're not willing this into existence.
[1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:04.280]  We've allowed it to come into existence. We know the globalist plan. That's how we've
[1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:09.920]  been able to predict it so far. But yes, in full wars has reached that really magic moment
[1:36:09.920 --> 1:36:14.400]  where all over the place people, I mean, I got approached 15 times yesterday at least
[1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:19.680]  everywhere I went saying, Alex Jones, you were right. Alex Jones, you were right. How
[1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:24.120]  did you know Alex Jones? Well, because we have the enemy plan. And so there's a huge
[1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:26.800]  awakening and I think the globalists have been off more than they can chew, brother.
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:33.760]  What do you think? I absolutely do. But I don't think they care. And if you have paid,
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:38.360]  if you pay attention to the legal report with that massive population reduction, you just
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:42.640]  went off. They just took that report off. Remember, it had us down to about 100 million
[1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:50.400]  people by the year 2025, I believe it was 160 million. Okay, so so that's that's that's
[1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:53.960]  just been taken off their website for some reason. You notice they're scrubbing like
[1:36:53.960 --> 1:36:59.760]  anything that has to do where you see the World Economic Forum where you see John Hopkins
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:03.760]  or Bill Gates, they're basically scrubbing everybody that's attached to it. You'll still
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:09.040]  see those three that those three on the banner, but you won't see the names anymore. And it's
[1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:13.400]  because everybody's tied into everything. So that's right. And they're not so arrogant
[1:37:13.400 --> 1:37:17.520]  now. A lot of people realize they've been set up. That's why you're seeing prestigious
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:23.920]  scientists come out. But look, last year, the head of infectious diseases, I mean, I mean,
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:30.800]  the dean of the medical school at a prestigious medical school said, do not take this, it
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:36.360]  always hurts people. They knew built, he said, look, the program always failed. Bill Gates
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:41.040]  resurrected it. And it kills people. Well, yeah, he got it because it's a weapon. Like
[1:37:41.040 --> 1:37:46.160]  you go in a gun shop and buy a gun, it's a weapon. He didn't he didn't buy a spoon. He
[1:37:46.160 --> 1:37:49.320]  bought a gun and they're firing it at us. Thank you for the call.

[1:38:37.160 --> 1:38:42.240]  excited to add this to my supplement routine every day. I suggest that you do the same

[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:58.440]  store.com. There's one central fact of criminal psychology. The criminologists all agree on
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:04.800]  that it's criminals are extremely pathological. Even more the general public, they do the same
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:09.960]  things over and over again. And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over
[1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:18.280]  and over again. Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci and eugenicist globalist that ran the
[1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:22.840]  rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with ACT and other chemicals that actually
[1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:28.640]  killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses
[1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:33.560]  that would actually go attack the team lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:38.960]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non lethal down
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:43.720]  the road. That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:47.960]  admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:52.720]  of HIV. That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:57.040]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers
[1:39:57.040 --> 1:40:01.320]  controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do. But because
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:05.600]  they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still
[1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:10.320]  have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire has a lot of power. But when I'm not
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:16.680]  using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.

[1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:21.480]  All right, we got two more segments left ahead of our special guest joining us. I want to
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:28.080]  jam in as many calls as we can right now. So let's just go right to your calls. Let's
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:35.800]  talk to Kim in Las Vegas. Kim, you're on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Thanks
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:45.040]  for taking my call. Thank you. Quick plug real quick for the bioseptic pros. We actually
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:53.080]  have a fifth wheel and so I bought it for that and it works great on the gray tank and
[1:42:53.080 --> 1:43:00.320]  the black tank. So those of you that are preparing to bug out when you need to get it for your
[1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:04.880]  rig, it works fabulous. I mean, since you called in about that, because
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:09.920]  we again got a guy that owned a patent with an oil company who literally, you know, sells
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:13.120]  massive amounts of this to finally bring it to the consumer market. So we're really
[1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:16.480]  proud of it because it works great and it's innovative. And that is one of the off label
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:23.440]  things you can do is for boats and for travel trailers and for RVs. I mean, we're told
[1:43:23.440 --> 1:43:26.800]  that even older systems that have gotten gummed up, that's really good at cleaning
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:35.240]  them out. What did it do for your system? I put a tablespoon down, my bathroom sink,
[1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:42.800]  my kitchen sink, and then about an eighth of a cup into the black tank. It's great for
[1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:50.560]  eliminating the smell. It seems that everything, you know, flushes out through the hoses and
[1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:58.720]  the tank's much more easy. But I really like the fact that it really does a great job on
[1:43:58.720 --> 1:44:03.160]  controlling the odor. Well, that's what we've been told by the
[1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:07.320]  folks that developed it over 20 years ago. This is used at hog farms. It's used at oil
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:11.600]  spills. I mean, this stuff will eat paper, it'll eat leather, it'll eat some forms of
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:17.440]  rubber, but nothing inside your RV. I mean, it is really, really strong and really, really
[1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:21.960]  powerful. So we're glad that you tried it out. And yeah, it's, in fact, they've just
[1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:28.040]  now launched, it's on label now, force, not just septic tanks, but for everything else.
[1:44:28.040 --> 1:44:34.720]  It's for your boat, it's for your RV, it's for your grease traps, it's for porta potties.
[1:44:34.720 --> 1:44:40.640]  Oh, and it's bio drain. Bio drain is here now as well. And it's got the little bitty
[1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:44.720]  scooper and the directions for each of your drains to absolutely eat that sucker out and
[1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:48.720]  get it clean. So I'm glad you liked it. It's a great new sponsor that we really push to
[1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:52.800]  partner with to bring online. Now, getting to your point about on vaccine injuries and
[1:44:52.800 --> 1:45:02.360]  effects. So I have so many vaccine stories. My husband's ex-mother-in-law took the shot.
[1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:08.520]  She had so many strokes until she was brain dead and the family had to take her off life
[1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:15.120]  support. His ex-brother-in-law took the shot. A week later, he was in the hospital with
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:20.800]  COVID and I told him, I said, make sure they do not put him on a ventilator. They put him
[1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:26.240]  on a ventilator. And, you know, like I told my husband, I said, he won't come off that
[1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:34.720]  ventilator. His funeral was a few weeks ago. My father-in-law took the shot within three
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:41.560]  weeks, had to have a quadruple bypass. Since then, he's been in the hospital twice to have
[1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:50.360]  clots dissolved. You know, my stepson is a Marine and overseas and they forced him to
[1:45:50.360 --> 1:46:00.720]  take the shot or they were going to end his deployment. I mean, it just, it's unreal how
[1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:09.480]  many people I know that are affected and I want to have empathy and sympathy and be compassionate
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:16.600]  to them. But I've told so many people and shared your videos and they're not listening
[1:46:16.600 --> 1:46:22.200]  and it's like, and they're going ahead and taking the mark of the beast and doing these
[1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:30.720]  things to themselves. And my heart is just, I'm so heartbroken knowing that I gave the
[1:46:30.720 --> 1:46:36.960]  people the information and they just, they refused to see it. And it's like, you know,
[1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:42.080]  like the video you showed with the two guys fighting until he put on the glasses, that's
[1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:48.320]  what I feel like right now. And I just, my heart is broken.
[1:46:48.320 --> 1:46:53.880]  Mine is too. My heart is broken, sweetheart. And we just have to give it to God. I'm so
[1:46:53.880 --> 1:46:58.640]  sorry. What happened to your family? I've got family that's pretty close. I wouldn't
[1:46:58.640 --> 1:47:04.160]  say cousins and people that have taken the shots and gotten sick and still defend it.
[1:47:04.160 --> 1:47:08.000]  And I have friends and people that didn't listen to me and got sick. And then they think
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:13.280]  we're making this up because they can't believe the government is evil, but it is at the top.
[1:47:13.280 --> 1:47:17.440]  And I'm so sorry, but we just have to give it to God, keep warning people and keep doing
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:21.720]  what you're doing, Kim. Thank you so much because supporting us and keeping us on air
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:25.720]  is reaching millions and millions of people. And so just know that we have love and our
[1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:29.840]  spirits last forever. We're with God. And that's what matters. And I say that because
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:36.280]  I'm in a lot of pain too. I mean, as a man, we're being assaulted and my body is like,
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:41.120]  you need to go after these people, but I understand they've got it set up to where they're martyrs
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:44.520]  then and we make them victims. And then no, no, we need to be like Gandhi who learned from
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:49.040]  Jesus and Martin Luther King that learned from Jesus is that is that is the killing
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:53.440]  these people at this point is not the thing to do. We need to have them arrested and tried
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:57.680]  and then executed. We don't need to be like them just killing people out there. We need
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:48:00.240]  to expose what they're doing and let them know they're going to be brought down for
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:08.280]  what they've done. But physically as a man, I just have real problems sitting here and
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:13.600]  taking this. But just thank God we've got this platform. We are hurting them so bad
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:17.160]  and they've got the feds trying to set me up right now and they've got people trying
[1:48:17.160 --> 1:48:20.600]  to kill us and you know, I'm not going to get into it all, but it's okay. I chose to
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:24.200]  be in this position. I'm very blessed to be here. But every day we're on air is a blessing
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:27.360]  folks. You got to download these shows. You got to save them. You got to start your own
[1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:31.640]  shows. You got to I don't care what you do. Go talk at city council. Just get engaged
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:37.280]  now because your word of mouth will override the enemy and the people can trump this evil.
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:42.240]  All right, let's go to another caller here. There's so many great callers here. Let's
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:46.800]  go ahead and just go on the calls. They're received. Let's go to Noel in Chicago. Thanks
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:53.440]  for holding. Go ahead. Well, Alejandro, it's been several years since I last spoken to
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:57.040]  you, my friend. So it's good chatting with you again. We'll continue to have you and
[1:48:57.040 --> 1:49:04.960]  my prayers as we are entering some amazing times. I did. I was investigative journalist
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:08.880]  covering weather modification. I'd call your show for many years telling the public about
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:13.600]  the Air Force document, whether as a force multiplier. I remember you calling. I remember
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:20.280]  you calling. Yes. I think even the guest on the show have I used my real name, but I've
[1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:24.520]  used my real name as a guest on your show. But I transitioned from an investigative journalist
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:29.600]  to the play by play world doing announcing for basketball, football, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:35.640]  So I was working my way up the totem pole in play by play where this summer, the top
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:40.160]  professional basketball league in the world, which just so happens to be here in the United
[1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:45.800]  States, I was going to work for them doing the contract in Chicago when in a meeting
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:50.440]  and in documents, they told me I had to take the vaccine. Everyone who had to work this
[1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:57.000]  event was forced to take the vaccine. Now, of course, I declined. I didn't do it. No
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  way in hell sort of made the choice for me where I need to go back to the investigative
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:05.600]  journalism realm because there's no way in hell I'm going to take this vaccine. My wife's
[1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:10.800]  family, Alex, they're all nurses. Several in her family are all nurses. One of them's
[1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:17.800]  going to be a doctor, actually, all took the vaccine. One of them is pregnant. And a couple
[1:50:17.800 --> 1:50:22.440]  of weeks ago, they come to discover that their soon to be daughter had developed a brain
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:29.520]  tumor. Another one of her family members, dribbling old, you can, you can tell through
[1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:33.240]  their skin weeks after they took the vaccine. They're not looking good. They're getting
[1:50:33.240 --> 1:50:39.080]  heart palpitations, rushed to the hospital. I know so many people, Alex, who are getting
[1:50:39.080 --> 1:50:46.120]  the vaccine, elderly people who are days confused, sort of reaching that all, so that all simers
[1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:47.120]  level.
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:52.560]  My grandmother took the vaccine in Florida. I'm just waiting for the phone call to where
[1:50:52.560 --> 1:50:58.760]  she starts to get in trouble. I'm noticing more and more Alex and the suburban parts
[1:50:58.760 --> 1:51:04.120]  of Chicago, Barrington, a very affluent suburb, where more and more parents are standing up
[1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:09.320]  going to school board meetings, telling these tyrants, you're not putting the vaccine in
[1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:13.960]  my child. I'm noticing it all across the country. I'm noticing it in California where they're
[1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:19.840]  awakening that golden bear, that beautiful flag of California. These tyrants are awaking
[1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:25.280]  average day people to what's going on. I know you're rushed for time on the supply chain.
[1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:33.880]  I spoke to someone in the Midwest who told me come September, we'll see a 10 to 15% increase
[1:51:33.880 --> 1:51:40.760]  across the board on all grocery items. Anything you can think of at the grocery store, 10 to
[1:51:40.760 --> 1:51:44.160]  15% increase in the coming months, Alex.
[1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:47.920]  By the way, it's probably been five years since you called. I know you went on to a
[1:51:47.920 --> 1:51:52.760]  big sportscaster career. I know you are. If you'd like to come on and or be a reporter
[1:51:52.760 --> 1:51:56.040]  for us, we'll get your name and number again. I know you've been a guest many times years
[1:51:56.040 --> 1:51:59.680]  ago. Remember you saying you were going to get out of that back into sports and then
[1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:03.840]  you're back into this by the sheer market to be situation. So I'd love to reconnect
[1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:07.080]  with you. We'll get your number, get your info. God bless you. Well, that's a blast
[1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:10.560]  from the past. Really smart guys. There's a lot of documents I didn't know about. We're
[1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:14.040]  going to come back, take more calls and the guest is popping in and then I'll come back
[1:52:14.040 --> 1:52:17.960]  to you one way or another. We're getting every caller here. We're taking your calls in the
[1:52:17.960 --> 1:52:22.960]  order they are received. But how hardcore is that? And it's not just what he saw with
[1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:27.120]  family having health problems. Or it's not what the last caller saw with the blood clots.
[1:52:27.120 --> 1:52:31.480]  It's in the literature. It's not like they didn't know. Remember every vaccine project
[1:52:31.480 --> 1:52:36.880]  with a spike protein failed until Bill Gates took it over. That was Congressional hearings.
[1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:44.680]  He knew exactly what he was doing.
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:51.280]  Hey, how's it going, Alex? It's great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging
[1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:55.680]  your sleep supplements. It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the
[1:52:55.680 --> 1:53:00.320]  gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:03.440]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[1:53:03.440 --> 1:53:06.560]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:10.880]  out for the point of the product. The X2COOP does wonders. They recommend it to everybody
[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:14.960]  here on the fence about it. Get off the fence, get the product, support the info ward.
[1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:17.760]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the year. Thanks for holding it. Go ahead.
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:20.240]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[1:53:20.240 --> 1:53:25.680]  Honored talk to you. Awesome. So, firstly, I wanted to do is say I love the products,
[1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:31.720]  Alpha Power, even at 29. If you ask my better half, she loves it. And it helps in the bedroom.
[1:53:31.720 --> 1:53:35.920]  So, just number one for a few of you. It definitely works. It's not a joke.
[1:53:35.920 --> 1:53:43.160]  Absolutely.
[1:53:43.160 --> 1:53:49.800]  The biosecurity state is here. It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans
[1:53:49.800 --> 1:53:55.960]  are dirty, bad, and evil. The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada who says he admires
[1:53:55.960 --> 1:54:01.120]  the communist dictatorship of GCP and wishes to make Canada the same has announced that
[1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:07.240]  they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out into 2024. And
[1:54:07.240 --> 1:54:12.480]  that in 2024, you will again take two shots. And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks
[1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:17.080]  out that wants to put in your body. This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed
[1:54:17.080 --> 1:54:20.560]  this whole plan with Bill Gates. They're now implementing it. And now they've announced
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:25.320]  that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation. Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation
[1:54:25.320 --> 1:54:30.640]  by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs
[1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:35.000]  Harbor, the train, the Coserville Institute in Germany. And Volwars will continue to set
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:38.800]  fast. They fight this. I don't know how long we can. The enemy's coming for us all now.
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:45.440]  God bless and good luck. I would again get right with God right now.
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:55:10.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. All right, folks, we're taking your phone calls
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:14.720]  right now. I have a very special guest joining us. I'm just going to the order they're received.
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:21.200]  Let's talk to scared in South Dakota. We'll talk to Travis in Maine scared. Go ahead.
[1:55:21.200 --> 1:55:26.440]  Hi, Alex. Can you hear me? I can go ahead. Thank you for calling. So you're a healthcare
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:31.200]  worker. I'm a healthcare worker in Sioux Falls, South Dakota for Sanford Health. They're
[1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:36.840]  probably one of the largest employers of the Dakotas, and they just mandated the vaccine.
[1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:43.160]  If you don't get it by November 1st, you're put on a 60 day suspension. Then if you don't
[1:55:43.160 --> 1:55:49.560]  get it during the 60 days, it's considered your voluntary resignation. And Governor Nome's
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:57.000]  response was, you have the power to say no to mandates. South Dakota has a robust economy,
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:02.160]  and this gives you the opportunity to find another job that values personal choice. She
[1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:06.400]  is of no help. She's been bought. I'm sick and tired of her getting credit for being
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:10.200]  this freedom loving governor because she's not. Well, that's definitely violates the
[1:56:10.200 --> 1:56:15.000]  Nuremberg code, whether it's an employer or anybody, the employer making you take something
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:19.600]  and lawsuits need to be filed. Unions need to be formed, but they usually create an out.
[1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:23.000]  Is there not a religious or medical exemption? Couldn't you get a doctor to say you have
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  autoimmune response or you don't need a vaccine or you've already got the antibodies? Well,
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.760]  the problem, they don't care about the antibody antibodies and medical exemptions and that's
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:36.320]  doing possible. Which I was about to say, as you know, as a medical person, if you already
[1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:38.880]  have antibodies for something, you better not take a vaccine for it. That can really
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:45.280]  make you sick. They don't care. This is across the board. They don't care if you've had COVID.
[1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:51.200]  It's mandated for everyone across the board and you can file a religious religious exemption,
[1:56:51.200 --> 1:56:57.480]  but they can and do deny those and you have to submit one every single year. I understand
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:01.320]  and it's good for nurses to fight. It's good for medical workers to fight, but you can
[1:57:01.320 --> 1:57:05.280]  also they always leave outs in these things. Just believe me, those administrators aren't
[1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:11.480]  taking it. No, absolutely they're not. Oh, I know. You know, it just makes me sick to
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:16.000]  work for an organization that will do this to their people though. Well, I would work
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:19.960]  against them. I would stay there and then quietly inform the patients and give them
[1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:24.320]  extra attention and watch over them because an institution that will do that is planning
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:28.120]  some other evil stuff. So stay in the hospital to make sure they don't intubate people that
[1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:32.400]  don't need it and then just push it as far as you have to. You see, I'm of the mind
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:35.880]  of don't let them run you out of the police department. Be there to watch what they're
[1:57:35.880 --> 1:57:39.120]  doing. Don't let them run you out of government. Be there as long as you can. Does that make
[1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:44.560]  sense? Yeah, it does. Yes. And that's my plan. I'm going to just starve it out as long as
[1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:49.680]  I can. Well, you're awesome. And you know, we had to go through this sometime and I think
[1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:52.160]  this is going to backfire on them. You know, they're seeing way more opposition than they
[1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:56.800]  thought they would see. I know it's rough for you scared, but at the end of the day,
[1:57:56.800 --> 1:58:02.680]  it's all part of God's plan. Anything else? The local news called us. We did a protest
[1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:08.440]  on Friday and the local news called us sociopath. That's right. You're a medical worker. You
[1:58:08.440 --> 1:58:13.240]  have experience. You know the truth. It's experimental, but you're a sociopath. You
[1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:16.520]  don't care about people because you won't take an experimental shot that violates the
[1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:22.800]  Nuremberg code. Right. What's the percentage of nurses and healthcare workers that are
[1:58:22.800 --> 1:58:29.680]  upset right now? I think that Sanford Health is predicting that they will lose at least
[1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:35.920]  20% of their workforce. I mean, you know, the White House isn't going to make people
[1:58:35.920 --> 1:58:44.480]  take the shot. So why should you have to? Exactly. I know. So people think South Dakota
[1:58:44.480 --> 1:58:50.000]  is free and it's really a bad state for medical purity and the governor doesn't care. Well,
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:53.840]  I know the grass is always green on the other side and I hear you and your governor kept
[1:58:53.840 --> 1:58:59.360]  trans stuff in sports where men can compete against women. I want to think of her as a
[1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:03.200]  great lady. She's certainly, you know, well-spoken and a lovely person and does a lot of good
[1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:06.880]  things, but she does a lot of bad things as well. Thank you for the call. All right.
[1:59:06.880 --> 1:59:10.160]  We have our special guest joining us, but then I'm going to host some of the next hour.
[1:59:10.160 --> 1:59:13.080]  If you can hold, because we've got all these great callers that have been calling in the
[1:59:13.080 --> 1:59:19.000]  last 30 minutes. So we're going to get to Derek and Mel and Deborah and Walker and Jay
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:25.840]  and Carlos and Travis and James and JP and Oshawa and so many, but we've got our special
[1:59:25.840 --> 1:59:30.720]  guest joining us that's got a host of big topics. He's going to be covering Dr. Stephen
[1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:35.640]  Greer, new film, The Cosmic Hoax, DNI report. That's huge. He predicted that would come
[1:59:35.640 --> 1:59:40.240]  out and be a nothing burger and fake national security threat. It's all coming up with
[1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:46.240]  Dr. Stephen Greer, the big whistleblower on the other side and he's got his new hit film
[1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:50.120]  out as well. We'll be right back. Tell folks tune in.

[2:01:00.280 --> 2:01:12.280]  time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones. This magic moment. So different
[2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:40.160]  and so new. Welcome back. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to play the trailer for the film
[2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:44.920]  coming up next segment here on the Alex Jones show. Dr. Stephen Greer is one of the world's
[2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:49.640]  foremost authorities on the subject of UFOs, extraterrestrial intelligence and technologies
[2:01:49.640 --> 2:01:55.280]  and initiating peaceful contact with interstellar civilizations for 30 years. Dr. Greer has provided
[2:01:55.280 --> 2:01:59.200]  briefings for senior government officials across the globe conducting numerous media
[2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:03.920]  interviews and it's delivered thousands of interviews and lectures. He has also written
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:09.000]  five books produced a feature film documentaries that have been seen hundreds of millions of
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:14.480]  times. Dr. Greer's relentless efforts towards the disclosure of classified UFO ET information
[2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:18.840]  has inspired I would say billions not millions of supporters around the world. His films
[2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:23.960]  are unacknowledged and close encounters of the fifth kind. Contact has begun with the
[2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:30.160]  most recent film being the cosmic hoax and expo say Dr. Stephen Greer again is at doctor
[2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:38.400]  dot Stephen Greer on Instagram and www.seriousdisclosure.com with an S. Thanks for joining us. Obviously
[2:02:38.400 --> 2:02:43.200]  you said you would come back on once they'd released this report. You predicted it would
[2:02:43.200 --> 2:02:49.440]  just be a bunch of earth technology, human technology, corporate technology and so let's
[2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:54.120]  start there and then get into the new film cosmic hoax and expand out. But first off
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:59.120]  thanks for coming on. Thank you. I'm really glad to be with you again. Before we get into
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:04.160]  the film and all the big DNI report and all of it, first I know you like to stay on subject
[2:03:04.160 --> 2:03:09.680]  but this whole global government Bill Gates, the inoculation, the fact that they admit
[2:03:09.680 --> 2:03:13.520]  that people that have been injected are the ones that are mainly getting sick. From your
[2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:20.840]  sources and your connections, what is going on here? Well the main thing is that the abuse
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:25.800]  of power that's been associated with this pandemic, aside from the fact that some was
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:32.680]  certainly was a bio warfare weapon created in the Wuhan lab, is the way they're beta
[2:03:32.680 --> 2:03:39.840]  testing to see how well they can control the populace. Because what they really have done
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:47.880]  is to issue all kinds of confusing edicts from central state actors and then see if the
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:55.680]  populace will genuflect and bow down and kowtow to these authorities. And I think that anyone
[2:03:55.680 --> 2:04:03.520]  who cares about freedom has to look at these excesses of abuse of power that have been
[2:04:03.520 --> 2:04:09.160]  happening. And that's something that I think was by design. I think this was done to see
[2:04:09.160 --> 2:04:15.280]  let's see if we can beta test through fear, a constant drum beat of fear. I'm an emergency
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:21.840]  doctor and I can see how fear can affect people in so many ways. And it's been very, very
[2:04:21.840 --> 2:04:28.480]  effective. And so you have people doing completely irrational things. Excuse me. And those things
[2:04:28.480 --> 2:04:35.120]  are very dangerous not only to people's individual health, but like children of very young age
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:43.160]  of not being in school, having to wear masks when they have very low risk of either spreading
[2:04:43.160 --> 2:04:49.400]  it or getting the virus. And yet people are complying and they're measuring, in my opinion,
[2:04:49.400 --> 2:04:54.200]  they're seeing how effective that is. How much can they get away with?
[2:04:54.200 --> 2:05:00.320]  I think you're absolutely right. Klaus Schwab has said get ready for global power outages.
[2:05:00.320 --> 2:05:06.760]  That'll make the COVID look like a tea party or look like a walk in the park. They even
[2:05:06.760 --> 2:05:12.560]  admit they're doing this for quote, great reset. What do you think of Klaus Schwab and
[2:05:12.560 --> 2:05:17.160]  this whole great reset? What are the planetary controllers trying to do because they're acting
[2:05:17.160 --> 2:05:19.640]  like somebody's got a gun to their head?
[2:05:19.640 --> 2:05:24.400]  Well, you know, this is a long-term defense plan that was concocted at the end of World
[2:05:24.400 --> 2:05:32.160]  War II over 70 years ago. And we have people on my team who have seen this long-term strategic
[2:05:32.160 --> 2:05:38.280]  defense plan. Even General Wesley Clark admitted to seeing a document where all these endless
[2:05:38.280 --> 2:05:44.080]  wars in the Middle East were mapped out way in advance. Werner von Braun, who invented
[2:05:44.080 --> 2:05:49.240]  the rocket for Adolf Hitler, stated that she had seen a plan when she was at Fairchild
[2:05:49.240 --> 2:05:54.320]  Industries in a meeting with the people from the CIA that mapped out all these endless
[2:05:54.320 --> 2:05:58.240]  wars that we've been doing since from the 70s till now.
[2:05:58.240 --> 2:06:04.280]  And these are the sort of things that you have, your previous guest used the word sociopath,
[2:06:04.280 --> 2:06:09.840]  I mean, really high-functioning sociopaths who want endless war and who want to control
[2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:15.440]  the global population through fear. Now, the big curve that they could play at any time
[2:06:15.440 --> 2:06:20.960]  that they've been building up to this for over 60 years is this sort of hoaxed alien
[2:06:20.960 --> 2:06:27.840]  invasion nonsense, which that's the drumbeat being pushed out of this director of National
[2:06:27.840 --> 2:06:28.840]  Intelligence.
[2:06:28.840 --> 2:06:30.840]  And you've been saying that for 30 years. That's why you've got so much credibility.
[2:06:30.840 --> 2:06:34.280]  When I first heard you 25 years ago, I thought, well, this guy sounds credible. A lot of it
[2:06:34.280 --> 2:06:38.920]  makes sense. But then it all came true the way the Hollywood, the media, the rollout,
[2:06:38.920 --> 2:06:42.600]  obviously, these machines they're showing are human. I have no folks that have worked
[2:06:42.600 --> 2:06:48.440]  on them. I mean, it's not even that classified anymore, as you said, decades ago. So why
[2:06:48.440 --> 2:06:52.440]  do they want us to believe there's this outside violent alien threat? You're saying that's
[2:06:52.440 --> 2:06:55.080]  going to be the ultimate false flag?
[2:06:55.080 --> 2:06:59.520]  It's the ultimate false flag, and they actually started it. If you look at the Cosmic Ocean,
[2:06:59.520 --> 2:07:06.280]  you'll see that we refer to a CIA document from 1985, where the CIA was going down to
[2:07:06.280 --> 2:07:13.440]  Brazil and Argentina admits this openly. And we're engaging in fake alien abductions for
[2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:20.280]  their quote, psychological warfare value. Now, this is not a contested document. Moreover,
[2:07:20.280 --> 2:07:25.720]  we have an Air Force intelligence officer who's come forward, who has stated point blank that
[2:07:25.720 --> 2:07:31.720]  they have engaged in abducting US citizens made to look like alien encounters for their
[2:07:31.720 --> 2:07:37.560]  psychological warfare value. I mean, this is a case closed here, but the general public
[2:07:37.560 --> 2:07:43.160]  mostly don't know this. And this is why we did this emergency documentary, and I released
[2:07:43.160 --> 2:07:47.280]  it for free. I think it's on your site. We're putting it out all over the world. It's because
[2:07:47.280 --> 2:07:52.760]  the people, we can need to be Cosmic Paul Revere's here and say, wait, there's this whole hoax
[2:07:52.760 --> 2:07:57.440]  and fake alien threat thing coming, and people are being sucked into it, just like they've
[2:07:57.440 --> 2:08:03.360]  been sucked into the fear of so many other things that we've done that have been disastrous,
[2:08:03.360 --> 2:08:09.520]  like the aftermath of 9 11, where we stumbled into Afghanistan for 20 years and Iraq under
[2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:14.920]  false pretenses and false intelligence, and ended up spending trillions of dollars and
[2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:21.480]  killing millions of lives to no avail. Well, I should have said up front that your
[2:08:21.480 --> 2:08:26.680]  new amazing film super high production quality, obviously millions of dollars to make the cosmic
[2:08:26.680 --> 2:08:31.640]  hoax and expose. I wish I could make a film this good is free. And I should have pointed
[2:08:31.640 --> 2:08:37.720]  that out. It is at band dot video, the cosmic hoax and expose. It's many other places. And
[2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:41.120]  I should have had you back on when you launched it a few weeks ago. But here it is, everybody
[2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:46.000]  should share today, the cosmic hoax and expose. Tell us about the film.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:52.680]  Well, the genesis of the film was when I got a heads up that the director of national intelligence
[2:08:52.680 --> 2:08:59.800]  and their minions, people like Lou Elizondo and Chris Mellon and Nick Pope and others
[2:08:59.800 --> 2:09:08.000]  were consistently saying three provable, damnable lies. Let me go through these very quickly.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:13.080]  The documentary is more extensive. But number one, they say that we don't know what these
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:20.680]  objects are. We do. Some of them, very few of them are actually extraterrestrial vehicles.
[2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:24.920]  Most of the ones that are being shown in the media, if you look at all those, those are
[2:09:24.920 --> 2:09:29.800]  all ours. Those are from Lockheed Skunk Works. They're from my uncle's company, Northrop
[2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:37.480]  Grumman. They're contractors that are making so-called anti-gravity free energy devices.
[2:09:37.480 --> 2:09:43.000]  And that's a bigger secret than the ET issue for a reason I'll get into in a moment. And
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:49.440]  then the second big lie is we don't have anything that can move this way. And they show these
[2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:56.120]  images. This one you're showing right now obviously has nav lights on it. It's a triangle,
[2:09:56.120 --> 2:10:02.800]  anti-grav, silent, made by Northrop Grumman. And we have known this for decades. I'll give
[2:10:02.800 --> 2:10:11.720]  your viewers a date, October 1954. That is when we mastered gravity control and began
[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:17.120]  making man-made things that look like UFOs. This particular video you're showing now is
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:22.360]  a Lockheed Martin from the Skunk Works up in the high desert of California. So are there
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:30.280]  actually ET crap? Yes, much more rarely seen. They're using these man-made ones to try to
[2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:35.880]  create this other third lie, the national security threat. So in every single-
[2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:39.400]  Stay right there. And it's incredibly obvious when they all swarm our ships and nuclear
[2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:44.800]  bases to make our military think of the enemy. We'll be right back with our special guest,
[2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:54.200]  ladies and gentlemen, and the film that's free right now at band.video. Stay with us.
[2:10:54.200 --> 2:11:00.320]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:05.320]  the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And
[2:11:05.320 --> 2:11:10.280]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[2:11:10.280 --> 2:11:14.800]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[2:11:51.840 --> 2:11:57.800]  The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm. They
[2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:03.160]  are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:10.160]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome. And so even though
[2:12:10.160 --> 2:12:14.760]  it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out in the
[2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:20.920]  open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing. We have forced them out in
[2:12:20.920 --> 2:12:25.960]  the open. So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen.
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:30.880]  Realize humanity is winning. You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:37.720]  plan of God's justice. That is invincible. That is ethereal, timeless and unstoppable.
[2:12:37.720 --> 2:12:42.600]  So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action
[2:12:42.600 --> 2:12:46.520]  against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew
[2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:51.720]  to you. We will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender.
[2:12:51.720 --> 2:12:55.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer here, the host of the Info Wars War Room and I am very
[2:12:55.320 --> 2:13:01.520]  excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com. Now, I've been supplementing
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:06.360]  with greens, fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time and so I was excited to hear
[2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:12.440]  that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com. But then I read the ingredients
[2:13:12.440 --> 2:13:18.200]  and I was blown away. Listen to this. Organic pea fiber, organic alpha leaf, organic wheat
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:24.200]  grass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa
[2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:28.640]  sprout. Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:32.560]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life changing supplement for your health and we've
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:39.520]  packed it all in to fibergreencaps at InfoWarsStore.com. So I'm excited to add this to my supplement
[2:13:39.520 --> 2:13:45.200]  routine every day. I suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at an introductory
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:55.160]  price of $19.95. That's 33% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:13:55.160 --> 2:14:15.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Well, the film came out on July 4th and he posted
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:20.160]  a man.video. They were very gracious to do that. An emergency release, even though they've
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:24.800]  made films that have been widely seen and been on national television. It's one of their
[2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:30.600]  best. They put it out for free as an emergency. The Cosmic Hoax. It's so important for peace
[2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:35.840]  and human future and I really think it's an amazing film. It's free right now at band
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:39.800]  on video and I've had it moved back to the top as the featured film. Here's part of
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:44.320]  the trailer. Again, the main speaker along with many others is Dr. Stephen Greer. Here
[2:14:44.320 --> 2:14:52.160]  it is. This is a story about a hoax that might happen in the future. It's a story about
[2:14:52.160 --> 2:14:58.560]  a cosmic hoax that has been unfolding for 60 years. We are quickly approaching a point
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:24.520]  of no return. I've been warning about this for decades.
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:40.400]  No, not that. This. Speaking of conspiracy theories that actually have truth at the bottom
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:44.240]  of them, the Corona relief bill that President signed last month contains a provision that
[2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:49.600]  hasn't gotten a lot of attention. It directs the director of national intelligence in consultation
[2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:52.640]  with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other agencies. To disclose what they know
[2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:59.080]  about UFOs within 180 days. So what are they going to tell us? I've provided briefings
[2:15:59.080 --> 2:16:06.160]  for four presidents, foreign heads of state, generals and a sitting CIA director who later
[2:16:06.160 --> 2:16:13.400]  betrayed me. I've seen lives destroyed. William Colby has been missing since April 27. His
[2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:20.120]  canoe was found washed up on the banks of the Waikomiko River. Friends murdered. Unthinkable
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:28.040]  evil unleashed on our planet. All to protect this illegal and immoral secrecy. And nothing
[2:16:28.040 --> 2:16:37.680]  I've seen scares me more than this unprecedented moment we are living through. We're in the
[2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:44.200]  final hour of an agenda that has been playing out for nearly a century. Centralized monopolies
[2:16:44.200 --> 2:16:50.440]  of power in government, the defense industry and the corporate media are all converging
[2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:57.680]  on the same narrative that extraterrestrials are real. They're here and they're a threat.
[2:16:57.680 --> 2:17:03.280]  Those are not weather balloons. Those are clearly autonomous aircraft of some kind that are,
[2:17:03.280 --> 2:17:09.720]  as you put it, swarming U.S. military craft. So there are two options under intelligent
[2:17:09.720 --> 2:17:15.640]  control. These are under intelligent control and they're flying with impunity tucker within
[2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:22.800]  our airspace and they can outmaneuver, outperform anything that we seem to have. We need to
[2:17:22.800 --> 2:17:29.880]  find out who's operating them and also what the intent is. The truth is we do know who's
[2:17:29.880 --> 2:17:36.720]  operating them. Some are indeed extraterrestrial and they are absolutely not a threat as you
[2:17:36.720 --> 2:17:44.360]  will see. It is, in fact, the secrecy that is an existential threat to life on Earth
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:50.160]  and beyond, as stated by the first CIA director, Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillings. That's just
[2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:55.000]  part of the trailer, but see the whole film for free. The Cosmic Hoax, an exposé, now
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:59.040]  featured video at Bandai Video. Okay, this is a shorter segment, two long segments coming
[2:17:59.040 --> 2:18:04.400]  up with Dr. Stephen Greer. So continue with clearly, if there's advanced civilizations,
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:08.960]  and Christ said, you know, I've got many flocks, the point is they could, and all the ancient
[2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:13.760]  societies recorded this, they could destroy us like that. So the whole idea that these
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:17.960]  things are swarming military bases and they're always coming out of the skunk works, they're
[2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:22.080]  always coming out of Area 51. I mean, it's insanely obvious that when you look at Hollywood
[2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:26.320]  and all of it, and then your sources and your research, that they're building this up to
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:27.920]  unify and control us.
[2:18:27.920 --> 2:18:35.120]  Correct. I have 980 whistleblowers now that have been in the agency and aerospace companies
[2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:40.720]  that have verified what's in this film. We have, in my early briefings with the Clinton
[2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:46.920]  administration and the CIA director, we discovered that most of the senior leadership in the
[2:18:46.920 --> 2:18:53.080]  United States are not read into or briefed on this matter. And that, in fact, there is
[2:18:53.080 --> 2:18:58.240]  a extreme deep state, let's call it, that are known as unacknowledged special access
[2:18:58.240 --> 2:19:05.720]  projects that evolved in the 1950s that have been running amok for, you know, over 65 years.
[2:19:05.720 --> 2:19:10.840]  And I think that this is what Eisenhower ran up against. He knew about this issue.
[2:19:10.840 --> 2:19:15.400]  Remember, he warned of it. He warned of it. He said a technological elite in control of
[2:19:15.400 --> 2:19:16.880]  the military industrial complex.
[2:19:16.880 --> 2:19:22.120]  Yes, exactly. And he said, this is a threat to our democracy and our real life and our
[2:19:22.120 --> 2:19:29.040]  security. So they all knew this. They knew it was happening. And I recently had Paul
[2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:34.680]  Mellon. He was a supporter of Hitler. And at the end of World War II, his grandsons
[2:19:34.680 --> 2:19:41.200]  on my team has told me this, that he, in fact, organized the CIA with Alan Dulles, but they
[2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:47.960]  had already brought over from Germany a prototype of an anti-gravity disk. And that was one
[2:19:47.960 --> 2:19:52.240]  of the big fines at the end of World War II from Germany.
[2:19:52.240 --> 2:19:54.240]  And was that the bell? Was that the bell?
[2:19:54.240 --> 2:19:59.800]  No, there was a bell. This was actually a disk-shaped object that was electro-gravitic.
[2:19:59.800 --> 2:20:03.680]  They had not perfected it. Had the Germans perfected it, they would have won World War
[2:20:03.680 --> 2:20:04.680]  II.
[2:20:04.680 --> 2:20:07.080]  Keep going, boys.
[2:20:07.080 --> 2:20:12.960]  So what has happened is that these covert programs have evolved very strongly to the
[2:20:12.960 --> 2:20:19.240]  point now they've decided to pull the trigger on officially through the government releasing
[2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:24.200]  these sort of reports. And the mainstream media, working lockstep with the intelligence
[2:20:24.200 --> 2:20:29.200]  community, are now putting out this false narrative that there's a threat to the national
[2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:30.200]  security.
[2:20:30.200 --> 2:20:36.800]  Now, the only part of that that's true is that these covert, human, illegal projects
[2:20:36.800 --> 2:20:42.120]  are a threat to the national security. The interstellar civilizations are certainly not.
[2:20:42.120 --> 2:20:46.280]  They are so advanced that if they were a threat, we'd all be gone by now, believe me.
[2:20:46.280 --> 2:20:50.760]  I mean, these technologies, you're dealing with interstellar transportation capabilities.
[2:20:50.760 --> 2:20:55.560]  Now, it doesn't mean that they're not worried about us. I think the whole modern era of
[2:20:55.560 --> 2:21:00.560]  sightings happened because we started detonating atomic and thermonuclear weapons, which ended
[2:21:00.560 --> 2:21:06.760]  up being very disruptive to dimensions that go beyond what we think of as normal 3D space
[2:21:06.760 --> 2:21:07.760]  time.
[2:21:07.760 --> 2:21:10.320]  Please continue.
[2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:15.960]  So I'm concerned at this point that there's this juggernaut happening in the media and
[2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:22.440]  also across the mainstream media, left, right, tougher, Carlson, MSNBC, doesn't matter where
[2:21:22.440 --> 2:21:27.040]  this false narrative is being put out. And in reality, what they're showing to the American
[2:21:27.040 --> 2:21:35.840]  public are clandestine, military, human, mostly American aircraft, but they're saying, well,
[2:21:35.840 --> 2:21:38.000]  we don't know what they are and et cetera and so on.
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:41.680]  They're just stirring up so they can even attack us and say it's aliens. I know Tucker
[2:21:41.680 --> 2:21:45.640]  is a good guy. He's just showing these amazing machines because you can't doubt it and they're
[2:21:45.640 --> 2:21:48.280]  saying it's not human.
[2:21:48.280 --> 2:21:50.520]  You would go on Tucker's show, wouldn't you?
[2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:54.840]  Oh, I'd absolutely go on his show and clarify this. And we have documents, by the way, to
[2:21:54.840 --> 2:21:59.320]  prove this. We have schematics and drawings from the Lockheed Skunk Works. I have the
[2:21:59.320 --> 2:22:04.720]  best aerospace researchers in the world on my team and we can prove what we are saying.
[2:22:04.720 --> 2:22:09.840]  And so I think this is where the public needs to be properly informed. Now, this secret
[2:22:09.840 --> 2:22:15.720]  is bigger than the ET question. The fact that there are these technologies that are clandestine,
[2:22:15.720 --> 2:22:16.720]  that's the crown jewel.
[2:22:16.720 --> 2:22:20.480]  Does that would totally free the planet? Exactly. ET aside, advanced technologies, free energy
[2:22:20.480 --> 2:22:22.640]  would total create world peace.
[2:22:22.640 --> 2:22:28.920]  Yeah, totally create world peace in poverty, fix the environment without a bunch of cap
[2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:31.920]  and trade, half band aid solution.
[2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:35.320]  And that's why it's so important. Let's talk about this. This is the key. You're absolutely
[2:22:35.320 --> 2:22:39.360]  right. We know they are suppressing advanced technologies. That's a fact not debatable.
[2:22:39.360 --> 2:22:43.840]  How do we somehow stop this elite from keeping us in a dark age? We'll be right back. Stay
[2:22:43.840 --> 2:22:48.840]  with us.
[2:22:48.840 --> 2:22:53.760]  Sure.
[2:22:53.760 --> 2:22:59.880]  Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[2:22:59.880 --> 2:23:04.880]  the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And
[2:23:04.880 --> 2:23:09.800]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[2:23:09.800 --> 2:23:14.360]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can
[2:23:14.360 --> 2:23:18.600]  then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and
[2:23:18.600 --> 2:23:22.880]  special reports and share them with everyone you know, take action now by texting the word
[2:23:22.880 --> 2:23:33.560]  NEWS, NEWS to 833-470-0438. That's 833-470-0438 for info or emergency news alerts or text
[2:23:33.560 --> 2:23:41.600]  the word show to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications. Take action now, rate

[2:23:53.000 --> 2:24:00.200]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on and that it's
[2:24:00.200 --> 2:24:05.120]  criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public. They do the same
[2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:10.520]  things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and
[2:24:10.520 --> 2:24:18.560]  over again. Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist that ran the
[2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:23.160]  rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually
[2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:28.960]  killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses
[2:24:28.960 --> 2:24:33.880]  that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:39.240]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[2:24:39.240 --> 2:24:44.000]  the road. That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:48.240]  admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent
[2:24:48.240 --> 2:24:51.880]  of HIV. That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:24:51.880 --> 2:24:57.000]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as things are with
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:25:00.720]  the globalist attacking humanity, all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want
[2:25:00.720 --> 2:25:06.960]  you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure, so I get to
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:10.400]  see things the general public doesn't get to see. Let me tell you, whether it's police
[2:25:10.400 --> 2:25:17.920]  chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry,
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:23.040]  people are really, really away from the establishment. They don't want to go along with the globalist,
[2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:28.800]  but they're scared, they're looking for leadership. Well, that's where M4 comes in. You fund us,

[2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:24.880]  to take some of your phone calls ahead of Gerald Salente joining us. We'll get to all
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:29.040]  the callers that are patiently holding. Dr. Stephen Greer has put out an amazing new
[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:37.000]  film. It's free at Band-Aid video or freeworldnews.tv, The Cosmic Hoax, and definitely Hollywood,
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:42.560]  the government, the Pentagon, is just everywhere saying that there's these things out of nowhere
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:46.320]  that are chasing our planes, chasing our ships, they're above our nuclear reactors,
[2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:52.280]  and then they fly off and land in the middle of the Nevada desert, or New Mexico, or Montana,
[2:27:52.280 --> 2:27:56.000]  or all these other skunk works, and we know they have these technologies. They've been
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:01.360]  suppressing them, and then now they say cut off our old technology, but don't let us have
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:04.400]  all the new technologies. I'm all for get rid of the older technology, have better
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:08.880]  new, but oh no, instead we get windmills that don't work. So Dr. Stephen Greer, you were
[2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:14.200]  getting into this, the carbon taxes, all of it, very anti-human, post-human world, like
[2:28:14.200 --> 2:28:17.960]  a new form of feudalism, instead of just letting us have the old technology and running out
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:23.000]  of it, they're taking that away while not having us have the new. Who is this shadowy
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:30.240]  group? What would you call this transhumanist cabal that's telling us humans are bad, and
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:34.160]  we're a bad species, and they're going to phase us out, and they're going to merge with
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:38.960]  machines and make a new species. All these globalists say, oh I don't believe in God
[2:28:38.960 --> 2:28:44.080]  or aliens, I'm going to be a God. That's what Ray Kurzweil says, and so they're making
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:48.560]  animal human hybrids. They're making what I would say is alien, while telling us look
[2:28:48.560 --> 2:28:52.800]  out from aliens from distant stars, they're coming to get us. None of it makes sense.
[2:28:52.800 --> 2:28:59.680]  We can see the group trying to play God, trying to, like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly,
[2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:05.080]  using humanity as something they believe will transcend, but the whole thing to me just
[2:29:05.080 --> 2:29:07.600]  sounds very, very evil.
[2:29:07.600 --> 2:29:12.320]  Well it is. You have to understand this is an organization that's transnational. It
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:17.520]  goes beyond normal geopolitical boundaries. Within the United States, which is the crown
[2:29:17.520 --> 2:29:24.080]  jewel for financial as well as technology, it has the strongest presence obviously, as
[2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:30.160]  well as in Europe and other very wealthy countries. But what people have to understand
[2:29:30.160 --> 2:29:35.800]  is that it is outside the chain of command. Now this was my coming of age in the 90s when
[2:29:35.800 --> 2:29:41.440]  I had a series of meetings with senior people in government, including the head of the Defense
[2:29:41.440 --> 2:29:46.160]  Intelligence Agency, the CIA director, the head of intelligence joint staff, all of
[2:29:46.160 --> 2:29:53.240]  whom had been denied access to these projects that we had proof of existing. Now most people
[2:29:53.240 --> 2:29:57.840]  listening are going, what is this man talking about? You're talking about, you know, the
[2:29:57.840 --> 2:30:03.840]  most senior flag officers in the Pentagon, or the director of the CIA being flat out
[2:30:03.840 --> 2:30:09.680]  lied to and denied access. And that has happened. Now there have been some generals and some
[2:30:09.680 --> 2:30:15.680]  CIA directors that are in this sort of group that has been called the majority intelligence
[2:30:15.680 --> 2:30:16.680]  agency.
[2:30:16.680 --> 2:30:20.160]  So it's a classic secret society model which predates intelligence agencies of rings within
[2:30:20.160 --> 2:30:25.760]  rings. And so it's like specter in James Bond. There's an international globalist group
[2:30:25.760 --> 2:30:29.120]  through corporations and government that basically keep everybody else compartmentalized.
[2:30:29.120 --> 2:30:34.280]  Yeah. And the big action isn't even in government. The big action is actually in the corporate,
[2:30:34.280 --> 2:30:39.800]  financial, private banking sectors. So, but this was something we unravel back in the
[2:30:39.800 --> 2:30:45.640]  90s. And there's a documentary on Amazon called and on to be called unacknowledged.
[2:30:45.640 --> 2:30:51.280]  It's been seen by about 700 million people and it kind of unpacks this. One of the things
[2:30:51.280 --> 2:30:57.160]  for people to remember, this director of national intelligence report was assembled by a bunch
[2:30:57.160 --> 2:31:01.720]  of people who probably were not clear to have access to the very things they claim they're
[2:31:01.720 --> 2:31:07.120]  reporting on. This is a big problem. And I think, you know, for example, you know, it
[2:31:07.120 --> 2:31:12.720]  came out in the New York Times, the Pentagon, our tax dollars spent $22 million that went
[2:31:12.720 --> 2:31:19.520]  to this outfit known as Bigelow Aerospace. It's now closed in Las Vegas. Well, that money
[2:31:19.520 --> 2:31:26.040]  was tracked to that entity because the person who was behind it, not Mr. Bigelow, but the
[2:31:26.040 --> 2:31:31.280]  intelligence guys behind it, wanted to be sure that nothing came out of that report
[2:31:31.280 --> 2:31:37.200]  and it was a complete throwing away of $22 million. So there's this dog and pony show
[2:31:37.200 --> 2:31:41.640]  going on and now it's going on again. They're going to have hearings in the Congress. I'm
[2:31:41.640 --> 2:31:47.120]  sure no legitimate truths will be presented at these hearings. And I think the only way
[2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:51.240]  we're going to fix this problem is for we, the people to stand up and say, look, we're
[2:31:51.240 --> 2:31:55.720]  going to educate ourselves on this, get the word out, and we're not going to be fooled
[2:31:55.720 --> 2:32:01.280]  again. So that's what we have to do. But yes, the organization is transnational and
[2:32:01.280 --> 2:32:06.280]  the U.S. one of the senior components to it is called the Majority Intelligence Committee
[2:32:06.280 --> 2:32:15.080]  or Ironically Magic. And we know that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and all that got
[2:32:15.080 --> 2:32:19.160]  set up by Goddard and you had all these other weird Aleister Crowleyites that were following
[2:32:19.160 --> 2:32:22.600]  it. And I know you just go off the science and the background and the rat line and the
[2:32:22.600 --> 2:32:28.240]  documents that we know of Operation Paperclip. But from my research, you can't swing a stick
[2:32:28.240 --> 2:32:33.800]  in here from skull and bones to bohemian grove to any of this without running into the occult
[2:32:33.800 --> 2:32:37.920]  and they believe that they're channeling, I don't know whether it's extraterrestrial,
[2:32:37.920 --> 2:32:42.360]  interdimensional, whatever it is, they call it angels and gods that are giving them these
[2:32:42.360 --> 2:32:48.400]  ideas. So I just go off the facts. And so from my studying of the shadow group, they
[2:32:48.400 --> 2:32:53.240]  believe they're in contact with something off world. Have you run into that information?
[2:32:53.240 --> 2:32:59.080]  And if so, is it interdimensional or is it off world or are these people just psychotic
[2:32:59.080 --> 2:33:00.080]  and insane?
[2:33:00.080 --> 2:33:06.520]  Well, I think many of them are psychotic and insane, frankly. But I think they're believed
[2:33:06.520 --> 2:33:11.520]  that they're in touch with beings from other dimensions that are not extraterrestrial.
[2:33:11.520 --> 2:33:15.920]  People confuse this. I mean, an angel, you know, I was at the Vatican meeting with a senior
[2:33:15.920 --> 2:33:24.760]  theologian to hope. And he said, look, neither angels nor demons need a flying saucer. So
[2:33:24.760 --> 2:33:29.760]  what you have here, and he was sort of half joking, but not the truth is you're dealing
[2:33:29.760 --> 2:33:34.480]  with people who have these, I call it the syndrome of masters of the universe. So they
[2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:43.200]  ascribe to themselves these this sort of hubris have dominion over everyone, including our
[2:33:43.200 --> 2:33:44.200]  military.
[2:33:44.200 --> 2:33:48.320]  And they reach out, they reach out spiritually or interdimensionally to anything that will
[2:33:48.320 --> 2:33:51.280]  agree with them and they find what they're looking for something very bad.
[2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:57.320]  Right. And these are people who are really aligned not with peace and the future and
[2:33:57.320 --> 2:34:03.040]  the thousands of years of peace that we should be entering into. These are folks who love
[2:34:03.040 --> 2:34:08.920]  destruction. One of the senior people on this team who I know personally is a torture freak
[2:34:08.920 --> 2:34:14.640]  and has killed a number of people that I know of who worked in this area and has an organization
[2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:20.720]  that is involved with Satan worship. And, you know, he has a wife that publishes a devil's
[2:34:20.720 --> 2:34:25.960]  newsletter. And this is a very senior member of this group. I have met him and he's a
[2:34:25.960 --> 2:34:29.680]  spooky character. I'll tell you the reason I'm telling the truth, Dr. Greer is I've had
[2:34:29.680 --> 2:34:33.640]  these very groups try to recruit me since I was a teenager repeatedly. And I guess that's
[2:34:33.640 --> 2:34:37.040]  what they do most of the time is try to recruit people. And really, it's just an excuse to
[2:34:37.040 --> 2:34:39.840]  act like complete psychotics. Like you said,
[2:34:39.840 --> 2:34:45.360]  Well, but they have enormous resources. May 1992, as a young emergency doctor, I started
[2:34:45.360 --> 2:34:50.360]  digging into this. I was taken to a meeting with the head of army intelligence and personally
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:58.240]  offered $2 billion. If I would join that group and give up what I was trying to do to disclose
[2:34:58.240 --> 2:35:06.200]  the facts and the truth about this, literally $2 billion back in 1992. I refused, of course,
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:12.480]  and this man went to my wife and try to convince her to convince me. It was the spookiest thing
[2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:13.480]  I've ever seen.
[2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:14.480]  That's what they do.
[2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:19.880]  Yeah. I mean, this is the level of corruption. I met with a man shortly after that who said,
[2:35:19.880 --> 2:35:26.120]  You know, we have given at least $10 million to over 10,000 people to secure their co-operations.
[2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:32.640]  To say where they paid billions to tens of thousands of influencers to push the vaccine.
[2:35:32.640 --> 2:35:36.160]  That's a low level example of this. Not to toot our own horn like, Oh, we're special.
[2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:39.520]  A lot of the devils want us. Why do you think they tried to recruit you and people like
[2:35:39.520 --> 2:35:43.240]  me and a lot of others? They just see, Okay, that's a prominent person. That's a smart
[2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:46.400]  person. We want them or what's happening there?
[2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:50.920]  So there is a project known as Operation Looking Glass and Red Light where they can sort of
[2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:55.920]  gaze into the future with some of these technologies and they make, they often will see someone
[2:35:55.920 --> 2:36:01.800]  could be a problem to them in the future. And so those people, they'll try to target
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:05.920]  and get their cooperation through all kinds of inducements and threats. I mean, I've
[2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:08.240]  had threats. I've had inducements, bribes.
[2:36:08.240 --> 2:36:12.880]  Why didn't they kill us? Like you and I, like similar things have happened. Why didn't they
[2:36:12.880 --> 2:36:13.880]  kill us?
[2:36:13.880 --> 2:36:19.200]  Well, I almost did die. As you know, three people, my team simultaneously got metastatic
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:22.960]  cancer, myself included with both. I'm the only one that survived.
[2:36:22.960 --> 2:36:25.920]  That's right. Let's talk about that with Dr. Stephen Greer. We come back. This is very
[2:36:25.920 --> 2:36:30.080]  serious. They also can give you these, uh, pneumonia's that again, mutate or harm us
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:33.960]  after they kill you. Uh, it's, it's, it's pretty, pretty rough folks. And then there's,
[2:36:33.960 --> 2:36:37.280]  and there's a God in this universe too, folks. Don't forget that powerful information on
[2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:42.000]  Stephen Greer. And then your phone calls Jill and Mel and Deborah and JD and Travis and
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:45.680]  James and Oshawa will go to every single one of you after our guest leaves us in one
[2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:50.760]  segment. Stay with us.
[2:36:50.760 --> 2:36:55.280]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown. The first one has already
[2:36:55.280 --> 2:36:59.680]  destroyed the third world already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:04.640]  and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the Western world. Ladies and gentlemen,

[2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:58.480]  state is here. It's an anti human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty,
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:04.560]  bad and evil. The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist
[2:38:04.560 --> 2:38:10.400]  dictatorship of GCP and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:16.280]  vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024. And that in 2024, you
[2:38:16.280 --> 2:38:21.240]  will again take two shots. And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put
[2:38:21.240 --> 2:38:26.880]  in your body. This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates
[2:38:26.880 --> 2:38:31.160]  for now implementing it. And now they've announced that US policy is set by the private Rockefeller
[2:38:31.160 --> 2:38:36.040]  Foundation. Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the thirties was the main funder of Adolf,
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:40.560]  Alois Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor, the train, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
[2:38:40.560 --> 2:38:44.240]  in Germany. And for us will continue to so fast, they fight this and I don't know how
[2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:49.000]  long we can. The enemies coming for us all now. God bless and good luck. I would begin
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:54.800]  to get right with God right now. I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long
[2:38:54.800 --> 2:38:59.360]  because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere
[2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:03.520]  we go. What we do, but because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great
[2:39:03.520 --> 2:39:08.400]  ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire has
[2:39:08.400 --> 2:39:13.160]  a lot of power. But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage,

[2:39:52.680 --> 2:39:57.400]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that
[2:39:57.400 --> 2:40:02.360]  I've ever done. All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five
[2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:09.040]  months in my efforts to bring the truth forward. Well, it's all come down to this. I'm having
[2:40:09.040 --> 2:40:16.520]  a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th. This historical event will be live streamed

[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:49.320]  Thank you and God bless. Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALIX or call 800-675-4614
[2:40:49.320 --> 2:41:09.560]  and use promo code ALIX. You're listening to the ALIX Jones show. There's a man going
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:17.240]  around taking names and he decides who to free. All right, Dr. Stephen Greer is our guest
[2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:23.360]  final segment and I've invited him on to do a our long commercial free special report
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:28.920]  very soon. He's agreed to it. So look for that to happen and then we'll also play excerpts
[2:41:28.920 --> 2:41:34.080]  of it here on the main radio slash TV show. But Dr. Greer, you got into targeting things
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:37.800]  you've gone through, how serious this is. A lot of the facts, they have a lot of advanced
[2:41:37.800 --> 2:41:44.120]  medicine that they can use as weapons, everything from race specific down to individually targeted.
[2:41:44.120 --> 2:41:56.160]  I think the main thing that people have to understand is that whatever technologies you
[2:41:56.160 --> 2:42:02.600]  think exist, we have technologies that are beyond your imagination. One of the people
[2:42:02.600 --> 2:42:09.640]  that our 20th anniversary event in April for the national press club of the disclosure
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:15.760]  project launch that we just did in April in Scottsdale, a man who is one of the most
[2:42:15.760 --> 2:42:23.840]  renowned aerospace researchers, James Goodall, spoke about his last conversation with the
[2:42:23.840 --> 2:42:32.800]  famed Lockheed Skunk Works CEO, Ben Rich. Ben Rich was about a week from passing away
[2:42:32.800 --> 2:42:38.560]  and he told this man that out in the desert in California, just the Lockheed Skunk Works,
[2:42:38.560 --> 2:42:43.320]  the Cube, which is deep underground, there are things out there that are beyond what
[2:42:43.320 --> 2:42:49.680]  you can imagine we've done and been portrayed in Star Wars or Star Trek. And he's referring
[2:42:49.680 --> 2:42:55.280]  to extremely advanced technologies. We have spent trillions of dollars of taxpayer monies
[2:42:55.280 --> 2:43:01.000]  over the years on these technologies. We have not gotten a benefit from them. These are
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:07.400]  controlled by a group of sociopaths that want to use them for endless war and destruction
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:13.280]  and frankly, evil purposes rather than the same technologies could be used to give us
[2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:18.440]  a paradise on this planet. So people need to understand that this is not like a superficial
[2:43:18.440 --> 2:43:23.360]  G, you know, or their aliens out in space issue. This is very much about the human future
[2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:28.960]  and I would encourage people to help us get the word out on this. By the way, if you go
[2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:35.880]  to my website, SiriusDisclosure.com, S-I-R-I-U-S Disclosure.com, you can download this Cosmic
[2:43:35.880 --> 2:43:41.600]  Oaks film for free and put it on your YouTube channel. Any site that's free, you can put
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:46.320]  it out there. We've released it so it's a creative commons as they call it. So everyone
[2:43:46.320 --> 2:43:51.440]  can share this with everyone else. And it's the way we need to do this because obviously
[2:43:51.440 --> 2:43:57.360]  we're being shadow banned. We're having a lot of a blacklisting of what we're doing
[2:43:57.360 --> 2:44:02.400]  in the mainstream media. The mainstream media only wants to feature people who are going
[2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:07.120]  to repeat those three lies. I started the top of the show talking about that. We don't
[2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:10.760]  know what these are. We don't have anything that works this way and they're a threat to
[2:44:10.760 --> 2:44:11.760]  the national security.
[2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:15.920]  And let's just go back as you mentioned this. I mean, I know I can know a high production
[2:44:15.920 --> 2:44:18.600]  film probably costs millions of dollars. I don't know how to make you give it out free
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:23.440]  because you care. You're calling on human intelligence and action to get it out and
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:26.600]  people can download it at Band-Aid video, share it wherever you get it, get it and share
[2:44:26.600 --> 2:44:31.600]  it. But let's go back to this because I studied this. This isn't hypothetical. It's mainline
[2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:35.520]  science is stuff we were told didn't exist 30 years ago, did exist. They suppressed it
[2:44:35.520 --> 2:44:42.800]  as disruptive technology. They used the Secret Service. They used the different federal agencies.
[2:44:42.800 --> 2:44:47.160]  The Securities and Exchange Commission and all these other groups to shut this down just
[2:44:47.160 --> 2:44:51.000]  like they came and grabbed all of Tesla's work, the FBI did. That's on record. And so
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:54.800]  they've been suppressing a lot of technology because it disrupts the industries they already
[2:44:54.800 --> 2:44:59.440]  have. Now they're so advanced they feel like they're God and they're keeping us in a new
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:03.480]  dark age. This is what will fix the environment. Explain that. I mean, you started getting
[2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:07.160]  into that about 30 minutes ago, but the break cut you off. This is what we're really talking
[2:45:07.160 --> 2:45:12.600]  about, not windmills that don't transfer the power properly, not ridiculous medieval
[2:45:12.600 --> 2:45:17.320]  stuff. That's an excuse to keep us from the real technology. And how do you see us getting
[2:45:17.320 --> 2:45:20.280]  into that and demanding that transfer to the people?
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:24.640]  Well, see, those technologies that everyone's talking about that we're spending trillions
[2:45:24.640 --> 2:45:32.960]  of dollars on are what I call environmental theater. It's just theatrics. The real technologies
[2:45:32.960 --> 2:45:39.120]  we've had for 100 years, literally since Tesla and maybe before. And they've gone through
[2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:44.880]  many refined generations. I have a document from the American Federation of Sciences from
[2:45:44.880 --> 2:45:53.940]  2010, where they state that there have been 5,160 patents seized by the Patent Office
[2:45:53.940 --> 2:45:59.520]  under national security orders that have to do with these creative breakthroughs in energy
[2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:04.400]  and technology. So your viewers should think about this. Imagine having a box, something
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:09.520]  like your heat pump with probably smaller that would run your house, your business,
[2:46:09.520 --> 2:46:15.280]  your factory, no energy costs, no pollution, pulling energy out of what's called a zero
[2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:21.200]  point or the fabric of space time around you. This has been around for a very long time.
[2:46:21.200 --> 2:46:25.840]  And meanwhile, we have these plug-in electric cars that are being charged off a coal-fired
[2:46:25.840 --> 2:46:26.840]  power grid.
[2:46:26.840 --> 2:46:29.960]  Listen, I have a member of my family at UT when he was in high school, part of the plan
[2:46:29.960 --> 2:46:34.960]  due program, that saw what you're talking about taking power right out of the ground.
[2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:40.280]  Correct. Absolutely. And these have been around for decades. In fact, if you look all the
[2:46:40.280 --> 2:46:49.000]  way back to the early 1900s, a guy named Stubblefield, you see Nikola Tesla with Stubblefield, and
[2:46:49.000 --> 2:46:53.080]  they have what they call an earth battery where the guy is running his farm off of something
[2:46:53.080 --> 2:47:00.640]  you just described. That was in 1908. So you have, I call these petrofascists, the people
[2:47:00.640 --> 2:47:08.080]  who want everyone dependent on a global macroeconomic system that we no longer need. And I think
[2:47:08.080 --> 2:47:14.000]  this is a big problem because the heart of the secrecy on the UFO issue, just think of
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:18.760]  a UFO, forget that word, it's actually an alternative energy and propulsion device.
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:24.680]  That's what it is. And it's not using rockets and it's not using jet-A fuel. So it's a alternative
[2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:30.000]  energy and propulsion device, which is why these covert interests who are the global
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:36.280]  power elites, this sort of industrial fascist base that runs the planet, they do not want
[2:47:36.280 --> 2:47:42.280]  people to know that exists. That's why the man-made UFOs are bigger secret than the extra
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:43.280]  terrestrial.
[2:47:43.280 --> 2:47:47.600]  And again, you've already quantified that, but explain it again because that's so important.
[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:52.600]  We already are the advanced civilization. And it's a red herring about stuff outside
[2:47:52.600 --> 2:47:53.600]  of us.
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:58.800]  Right. And we have all that. Look, I mean, we've spent 70 years reverse engineering
[2:47:58.800 --> 2:48:04.280]  extra terrestrial vehicles we acquired in the 40s and 50s, trillions of dollars. But even
[2:48:04.280 --> 2:48:10.080]  before then, there were huge breakthroughs in electromagnetic field theory and generation
[2:48:10.080 --> 2:48:14.640]  of energy using very high voltage systems. I don't get into the physics of it, but this
[2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:21.920]  is a wonderful news for my 11 grandchildren, right? But it's very bad news if we can't get
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:27.200]  it resolved. And that's why it's going to take we, the people, rising up peacefully.
[2:48:27.200 --> 2:48:32.400]  And my next whole, a big documentary that I want to do is on this whole lost century
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:37.880]  of technology. And what can we do as a public interest group to bring these technologies
[2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:38.880]  out?
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:43.040]  Bypass the government, bypass the big transnational corporation.
[2:48:43.040 --> 2:48:46.440]  I was about to say the reason they admit their panic to really read deeply in the Davos
[2:48:46.440 --> 2:48:52.760]  group in the UN is so many even small universities, even private groups are taking basically almost
[2:48:52.760 --> 2:48:56.480]  free energy is now working. And they're worried it's about to be scaled up. And as soon as
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:00.720]  that gets adopted, it's it's over for them in their control. And so I think that's why
[2:49:00.720 --> 2:49:03.680]  they're trying to bring in a worldwide tyranny right now.
[2:49:03.680 --> 2:49:08.680]  And that's exactly because they know that writing's on the wall with that. And actually
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:15.080]  as our disclosure project on the UFO and new energy issue ramped up, that's when they
[2:49:15.080 --> 2:49:20.480]  stood up the TTSA group and the director of national intelligence report, because we're
[2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:23.520]  trying to hijack the narrative back to these three.
[2:49:23.520 --> 2:49:27.920]  Oh, it's incredibly obvious, Dr. Graham, you're not tooting your horn there. Because I thought
[2:49:27.920 --> 2:49:30.800]  you sounded credible 25 years ago, but it all came true. Like you said, they literally
[2:49:30.800 --> 2:49:35.160]  stood up this entire drive to counter what you're doing.
[2:49:35.160 --> 2:49:41.600]  Yes. And that's they have to do that. Because what we've been, we've been reaching too many
[2:49:41.600 --> 2:49:45.840]  hundreds of millions of people. But I think, you know, it's a battle that you call it info
[2:49:45.840 --> 2:49:50.800]  wars. It's a battle for the minds and the hearts of the human people for a good future
[2:49:50.800 --> 2:49:56.680]  versus this disastrous extinction level event future they want us to slide into.
[2:49:56.680 --> 2:50:01.800]  Exactly. They're trying to create a controlled artificial extinction event, because they
[2:50:01.800 --> 2:50:05.560]  don't want us having access to the technology they've already got. It's pure greed. It's
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:09.280]  out of control, and they will fail. Thanks to you and many others. Thank you, Dr. Greer,
[2:50:09.280 --> 2:50:14.480]  your film, you donated the world is free at Band-Aid video, the featured video. Hope
[2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:16.880]  people get it and share it. Thank you, sir.
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:18.680]  Thank you very much. Appreciate your help.
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:21.600]  Thank you. Powerful. Hope you'll join us again. Like you said, he will for we're going to
[2:50:21.600 --> 2:50:28.200]  schedule a whole hour commercial free. Okay. Wow. Let's shift back to the forced inoculations
[2:50:28.200 --> 2:50:33.520]  in world government. When we come back, then we'll jam in your calls in two segments and
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:38.920]  then drill slant is always ready to kick butt. He'll be taken over. Please briefly remember
[2:50:38.920 --> 2:50:43.080]  only way we got out of the box, that is our hundreds of radio affiliates and TV stations,
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:47.720]  which are awesome, is you tell folks about those local stations and support them and
[2:50:47.720 --> 2:50:53.120]  about the local station is sharing a feed of us, promote that on Facebook or Twitter.
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:50:59.320]  That's not going to get banned or share the live feeds from free world news.TV. That URL
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:51:04.080]  is not being banned right now. Free world news.TV. Send them live feeds, send them videos from
[2:51:04.080 --> 2:51:09.680]  that page, but whatever you do, speak up because that's your power and you've been doing it.
[2:51:09.680 --> 2:51:14.000]  You've been doing it. Believe me, it's incredible. And so I just commit to you. I won't back
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:19.720]  down. I won't back down and believe me, we're in very dangerous waters, but that's okay
[2:51:19.720 --> 2:51:23.760]  because I was born for this and I am not going to falter now. In fact, I feel stronger than
[2:51:23.760 --> 2:51:27.600]  ever. It's a real blessing. So thank you for all your prayers. We're going to really try
[2:51:27.600 --> 2:51:31.480]  to see this through, but I'm going to be arrogant about it because we are on the razor's edge
[2:51:31.480 --> 2:51:40.560]  right now, like a snail surviving on a straight razor. That's my dream. That's my nightmare.
[2:51:40.560 --> 2:51:45.840]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown. The first one has already destroyed
[2:51:45.840 --> 2:51:50.200]  the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused
[2:51:50.200 --> 2:51:55.160]  massive supply chain problems across the Western world. Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time
[2:51:55.160 --> 2:51:59.280]  for you to get high quality, storeable food that's ready to ship while you still can at
[2:51:59.280 --> 2:52:03.920]  2020 prices. We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier. Their

[2:52:09.600 --> 2:52:14.160]  but only for one more week. They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex, but
[2:52:14.160 --> 2:52:19.040]  that's it. They won't do this sale again until November, and then the food prices go up in
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:23.760]  2022. This is insurance you can eat. It's the highest quality, hundreds of high quality

[2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:43.720]  take action now while you still can. Gerald of South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the
[2:52:43.720 --> 2:52:48.040]  air. Trying to move quicker. Hey, Alex. Welcome. Would like to say first off, thanks for being
[2:52:48.040 --> 2:52:52.520]  the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people. I've been trying to
[2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:59.000]  get ahold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:04.760]  lung that'll never go away. A living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for
[2:53:04.760 --> 2:53:10.280]  two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from
[2:53:10.280 --> 2:53:16.280]  the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24, verse nine,
[2:53:16.280 --> 2:53:23.560]  then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all
[2:53:23.560 --> 2:53:30.040]  nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall
[2:53:30.040 --> 2:53:35.000]  hate one another. That's right where we're at brother. And that's because God's name is on the
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:39.480]  founding of this country, no matter what they say. And that's why the enemy hates it because God
[2:53:39.480 --> 2:53:40.440]  pray to this country.
[2:53:44.440 --> 2:53:47.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:53:47.400 --> 2:53:49.400]  You
[2:54:09.240 --> 2:54:12.760]  Hey, Obama's got that giant mansion in Martha's Vineyard
[2:54:12.760 --> 2:54:20.120]  that's 700 people to attend his birthday party there. That's okay. He gets to you don't
[2:54:20.120 --> 2:54:25.960]  though you're gonna stay locked down and die. All right, let's go to your phone calls. I really
[2:54:25.960 --> 2:54:30.360]  appreciate folks holding. We had that very informative guest on. Let's just go in the
[2:54:30.360 --> 2:54:35.560]  order that these calls are received the longest holding caller would be
[2:54:37.640 --> 2:54:42.520]  Travis in Maine Travis go ahead. Thank you. Hey Alex, I just want to say
[2:54:42.520 --> 2:54:50.440]  I am really excited to see you guys putting Professor Peter Hotez up there on screen.
[2:54:50.440 --> 2:54:55.640]  And that's every info warrior out there needs to get on the Twitter and look him up. It's
[2:54:55.640 --> 2:55:01.240]  at Peter Hotez and everything that he's saying right now is just on point.
[2:55:02.360 --> 2:55:06.440]  And you're talking about the head scientist at Baylor.
[2:55:06.440 --> 2:55:12.040]  Yeah, guys, please try to get him on. Please get him on. Go ahead.
[2:55:13.240 --> 2:55:18.760]  He's a pediatrician and a vaccinologist and everything that he is putting out there on
[2:55:18.760 --> 2:55:25.480]  Twitter right now. He's also showing up on all of every every news station that will have him.
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:33.560]  And he is talking nothing but truth and every info warrior out there needs to see him and hear
[2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:37.720]  him and know what I agree. Who know? He told Congress a year and a half ago. It was going
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:42.920]  to happen. Wow. But what what he's talking about now is even more powerful.
[2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:46.600]  You guys print me that Twitter. I'm going to get I'm going to get all that info out.
[2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:49.560]  Yeah, we're working as hard as we can, brothers. Thank you for telling me about that.
[2:55:50.840 --> 2:55:56.920]  Please continue. I just want to finish up with a plug and say that the info war store
[2:55:56.920 --> 2:56:00.520]  sells products on the internet and they cost money. Have a good day.
[2:56:00.520 --> 2:56:05.080]  All right. Thank you so much, brother. I appreciate your call. All right, let's go ahead
[2:56:05.080 --> 2:56:10.360]  and take another call. Let's talk to Mel in Massachusetts. Go ahead.
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:20.200]  Hello. Hi, welcome. Yes, Mel. I first of all want to let you know that I just started listening
[2:56:20.200 --> 2:56:26.520]  to you in May. So I want to thank you for everything and I've been trying to share your
[2:56:26.520 --> 2:56:34.520]  information. But what I was calling about is a couple of things. I do work in the
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:41.960]  health care field and I'm not a nurse or a doctor, but I do work for a doctor. And
[2:56:44.440 --> 2:56:49.800]  whenever the vaccine came out, which I don't even remember because I surely was not taking it,
[2:56:51.400 --> 2:56:56.440]  he did take it. I believe he took it. They all were supposed to be taken in my office.
[2:56:56.440 --> 2:57:05.480]  They were promoting it and stuff. And he has been sick ever since. And I'm not laughing about it,
[2:57:05.480 --> 2:57:13.480]  but I'm just saying he's been really, really sick, like coughing, very like a lung thing.
[2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:18.920]  Oh, yeah. It starts growing. It starts growing protein crystals in your lungs.
[2:57:18.920 --> 2:57:25.960]  It's, I mean, and I even was like, are you okay? And he just keeps telling me he has allergies.
[2:57:25.960 --> 2:57:32.040]  And now I've worked for him for four years and I've never seen him like this ever. And
[2:57:32.840 --> 2:57:38.120]  one of the girls I work with also are, we're both like, wow, and now we're remote. So
[2:57:38.680 --> 2:57:45.880]  periodically I go in. And so it's been going on for a few months. And so that's one thing.
[2:57:45.880 --> 2:57:53.800]  And it's pretty bad. That was one thing. And the other is everyone in my family is getting it.
[2:57:53.800 --> 2:57:58.520]  And, you know, they can't believe I won't. And I'm not an anti-vaxxer, but this,
[2:57:58.520 --> 2:58:01.080]  there's no way I'm going there. This is not a regular vaccine.
[2:58:02.200 --> 2:58:11.480]  No, no, no, no. And I know. And so my niece got it. And she's 18. And within weeks,
[2:58:11.480 --> 2:58:17.800]  she was in the hospital with a kidney infection. And really attacks the kidneys too. Yeah.
[2:58:18.840 --> 2:58:23.960]  Yeah. So I mean, these are the things that I'm seeing over here too. But my, I mean,
[2:58:23.960 --> 2:58:30.440]  I work in a hospital and I kind of like waiting for the time that they, they mandated it.
[2:58:31.320 --> 2:58:35.880]  Just keep warning people like you're doing. You're an amazing person for speaking up. And
[2:58:35.880 --> 2:58:38.840]  just God bless you. And thank you for calling. It's your job to warn everybody, you know,
[2:58:38.840 --> 2:58:43.160]  and you're doing it right now. So we salute you. All right. I can talk to her for 10 hours,
[2:58:43.160 --> 2:58:47.160]  but we're going to go to the next caller when we come back in 60 seconds. And we're going to go
[2:58:47.160 --> 2:58:53.720]  right to a bunch of different callers like James and Michigan. Hello, I'm Mike Lindell.
[2:58:53.720 --> 2:58:57.880]  And I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[2:58:57.880 --> 2:59:02.440]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months
[2:59:02.440 --> 2:59:07.000]  in my efforts to bring the truth forward. Well, it's all come down to this.

[2:59:48.520 --> 3:00:01.720]  and use promo code Alex. There is surreal footage right now at info wars.com.
[3:00:06.040 --> 3:00:10.600]  Thousands of people lined up to take their force inoculations or their cell phones,
[3:00:10.600 --> 3:00:19.800]  which they get paid by in pakistan will be turned off. That is our future. Absolutely out of control.
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:35.800]  Yeah, we want to be angels, but the stars are so bright. You turn off the light. No.
[3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:41.400]  Ever. No, devils.
[3:00:44.840 --> 3:00:52.280]  Let's go ahead and take a call. James in Michigan, you're on the air. Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking
[3:00:52.280 --> 3:00:58.840]  my call. The reason I'm reaching out today, I got a pretty new one scenario. So regarding the
[3:00:58.840 --> 3:01:07.160]  vaccine, so I'm a dad and I have a six-year-old boy, a beautiful son I have and his mother is
[3:01:07.160 --> 3:01:15.960]  very on the left. To my knowledge, she's taken both of the jabs. How old is he? He's six years old
[3:01:15.960 --> 3:01:20.600]  and by the way, it's experimental. They're not even by law allowed to give it to six-year-olds.
[3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:30.120]  Exactly. And so I've been following all the COVID stuff very closely. And so I'm a single dad,
[3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:35.000]  so I'm separated from his mother. A lot of women and men who ever have custody,
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:40.360]  they run out and do it to mess with the other parent. It's a real moonshowsen by proxy.
[3:01:41.320 --> 3:01:47.000]  Exactly. I've been dealing with that. I ended up, I used to be on the left in Portland, got her
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:51.640]  pregnant, she left, went back to Michigan. And so I moved across the country to be in his life,
[3:01:51.640 --> 3:01:56.680]  fought in court, fired my lawyer because there was so much corruption. And I actually studied
[3:01:56.680 --> 3:02:02.520]  family law and I got further along in the court just doing pro se, got more time with my son,
[3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:06.600]  but she's been doing all kinds of crazy stuff ever since. And so she's taken both jabs.
[3:02:07.240 --> 3:02:12.920]  And so she has her leftist idea that she corrupts my son with and I have to do damage
[3:02:12.920 --> 3:02:16.920]  control and try to teach him how to... Well, I'm sorry to hear that, brother. Look at this. UAE to
[3:02:16.920 --> 3:02:22.840]  begin injecting children, not approved in the U.S., not approved experimental, serious criminal
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:27.720]  activity like Joseph Mengele, White House recruiting online influencers remote COVID jabs
[3:02:27.720 --> 3:02:31.960]  to kids. So they don't just want to molest your kids or cut their genitals off,
[3:02:31.960 --> 3:02:35.800]  now they want to inject them with prions and every one of these people pushing this
[3:02:35.800 --> 3:02:39.880]  will be held accountable. I'm sorry to hear that, brother. Did you have a question?
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:44.440]  Yeah. Well, I mean, it's, I just kind of wanted to say like, you know, what should I do because
[3:02:44.440 --> 3:02:49.080]  I'm in a specific situation where I can't come to her and try and stay down against this,
[3:02:49.080 --> 3:02:52.120]  because she'll use that in court to try and take my rights away. And I can't go...
[3:02:52.120 --> 3:02:56.440]  Well, I mean, listen, it's not been approved even in emergency use under 12 year olds.
[3:02:57.240 --> 3:03:00.920]  And so I would just call an emergency TRO if you believe that's happened and bring that point
[3:03:00.920 --> 3:03:08.680]  up. But it's a complex issue, James. God bless you. There's a safe panic spirit where women
[3:03:08.680 --> 3:03:13.160]  particularly take their signs to have their balls cut off or to be injected with poison
[3:03:13.160 --> 3:03:17.000]  or to be given Ritalin or Prozac. And it's Christ said, suffer the little children.
[3:03:17.880 --> 3:03:22.040]  It's predominantly women doing it, but some men do it as well. And it's just Stockholm syndrome.
[3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:28.600]  I'm very, very sorry. But some women like to get pimped and they like to pimp their children.
[3:03:29.240 --> 3:03:32.840]  They like to get hurt and hurt bad and the system will hurt them. That's what they're looking for.
[3:03:32.840 --> 3:03:38.120]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here. Let's go ahead and talk to JD and Indiana.
[3:03:38.120 --> 3:03:42.280]  JD, thanks for calling. How's your day going today, Alex?
[3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:47.400]  I'm all right, brother. Go ahead. I'm calling because I'm extremely angry today. My sister
[3:03:47.400 --> 3:03:55.080]  actually had surgery today on a month long of a process that I've watched where she went from
[3:03:55.080 --> 3:04:03.080]  being forced to take a shot or she was going to be fired into couple of days later, bruises
[3:04:03.080 --> 3:04:08.520]  all over her body. Huge bruises. That's blood clots in the capillaries.
[3:04:09.880 --> 3:04:16.760]  Yeah. And today she had surgery on her uterus because she had polyps and other things developing
[3:04:16.760 --> 3:04:20.120]  in and around her uterus. By the way, sir, as you know, the main line they said,
[3:04:20.120 --> 3:04:24.680]  this will grow tumors in your uterus. No big deal. This will grow cancer. No big deal. Wow.
[3:04:24.680 --> 3:04:29.960]  And you're experiencing it. And it's absolutely terrible because this is my sister that I love.
[3:04:29.960 --> 3:04:35.320]  And at the end of the day, it's like she was forced into this. And at the end of the day...
[3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:37.800]  What's not the piece of crap place that she worked?
[3:04:38.840 --> 3:04:40.280]  She works in a nursing home.
[3:04:41.400 --> 3:04:44.200]  And wouldn't it be better? That's why it works. That's why. But listen,
[3:04:44.200 --> 3:04:47.720]  have you seen the literature where they admitted attacks her uterus and grows these polyps?
[3:04:49.400 --> 3:04:51.640]  Well, I hope people are listening because it's happening right now.
[3:04:51.640 --> 3:04:56.200]  Guys, put it on the screen. They said, don't worry when you grow tumors. Those aren't bad.
[3:04:56.200 --> 3:05:00.360]  But really, when they go to the doctor, they go, no, it's cancer. See how sick that is?
[3:05:02.520 --> 3:05:06.680]  And I'm absolutely angry about it because it's happening to my blood. It's happening today.
[3:05:07.880 --> 3:05:09.800]  And it's so, please, out there, please listen.
[3:05:09.800 --> 3:05:15.560]  Yeah, they're saying uterus, breast, and lymph nodes all swell up on this.
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:22.840]  God, it's so obvious what they've done. Can you believe they're actually doing this, my friend?
[3:05:22.840 --> 3:05:27.800]  We have to start standing up. We have to do what you're saying. We have to start in our
[3:05:27.800 --> 3:05:32.520]  communities. We have to start reaching out to people and standing up and protesting.
[3:05:32.520 --> 3:05:36.520]  I would go out front that nursing home and bullhorn them every week for an hour about
[3:05:36.520 --> 3:05:40.360]  how they did this to your sister and how she should sue their ass because under Nuremberg code,
[3:05:40.360 --> 3:05:44.440]  they intimidated her under threat of her job to take it. And now look where she is.
[3:05:44.440 --> 3:05:45.960]  So what are they removing the polyps?
[3:05:47.320 --> 3:05:50.280]  So, yes. And she swears she's not taking the second.
[3:05:50.280 --> 3:05:55.400]  Oh, my God. This happened with one. Oh, this will go probably. Oh, my God.
[3:05:56.440 --> 3:05:59.080]  Yes. This only happened after one shot.
[3:05:59.880 --> 3:06:01.240]  Was it Pfizer or Moderna?
[3:06:02.040 --> 3:06:04.600]  I'm not 100% on what she took. I'm not 100%.
[3:06:04.600 --> 3:06:06.280]  Let me ask you this. Is she awake now?
[3:06:07.800 --> 3:06:09.880]  She's actually in the hospital on recovery.
[3:06:11.160 --> 3:06:16.360]  God. All right, brother, JD, we love you. Call back. Give us an update.
[3:06:16.360 --> 3:06:20.600]  Geez. Oh, I didn't know this call was from France. I apologize. We're going to be early.
[3:06:20.600 --> 3:06:22.360]  Deborah in France, you're on the year. Go ahead.
[3:06:23.640 --> 3:06:24.920]  Hi there. Can you hear me?
[3:06:24.920 --> 3:06:28.760]  I can't. Thanks for holding. I apologize for making you hold for so long. Go ahead.
[3:06:28.760 --> 3:06:32.680]  Not a problem. I just wanted to call and update people on what's happening here because the media
[3:06:32.680 --> 3:06:35.960]  is clearly not. Got millions of people are in the streets, aren't they?
[3:06:36.600 --> 3:06:39.880]  Millions of people. So last, last number I heard last week and with eight million,
[3:06:39.880 --> 3:06:43.240]  the official numbers are six and a half. But prior to the six and a half million,
[3:06:43.240 --> 3:06:47.160]  they said it was a couple of hundred thousand just like that. Like BFM TV is basically macrons
[3:06:47.160 --> 3:06:52.360]  like CNN. So they just kind of block for him and they just kind of they label
[3:06:52.360 --> 3:06:56.760]  anti-vax protesters and say these are just a bunch of crazy people. But in reality,
[3:06:56.760 --> 3:07:01.720]  it's unifying a lot of people in France and they're coming together to march.
[3:07:01.720 --> 3:07:04.520]  I mean, there's like millions of people. There's three times as many people
[3:07:04.520 --> 3:07:09.880]  in the streets now that they're worth weeks ago. And I think eye-opening thing for me this weekend
[3:07:09.880 --> 3:07:15.240]  was the day after all these protests on Saturday, the very first headline that pops up at eight in
[3:07:15.240 --> 3:07:20.680]  the morning is the head of the hospital union pushing and calling for mandatory, obligatory
[3:07:20.680 --> 3:07:25.400]  vaccinations for the entire population because we can't possibly withstand a fourth wave coming in.
[3:07:26.680 --> 3:07:31.000]  And that's basically like their response to the eight million people who descend in the streets,
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:35.560]  which is six to eight million. Well, I think it's time for people to start marching on the
[3:07:35.560 --> 3:07:39.880]  government buildings. Those governments are eugenics based. They are attacking people to
[3:07:39.880 --> 3:07:44.680]  violate the Nuremberg Code and they are assaulting you with an experimental deadly shot. I mean,
[3:07:45.400 --> 3:07:50.680]  where do you think France goes from here? Right now, honestly, I've been saying for months that
[3:07:50.680 --> 3:07:54.280]  they were gunning for us for the fall for more lockdowns. We had three lockdowns in a year and
[3:07:56.440 --> 3:08:01.080]  honestly, I'm looking to leave the country as soon as possible because I'm here with my kids and I
[3:08:01.080 --> 3:08:06.280]  don't feel safe because with what they're doing now, they implemented a mandate on the vaccine
[3:08:06.280 --> 3:08:09.240]  passports a few weeks ago and that's what the process are against or just the passports. But
[3:08:09.240 --> 3:08:14.280]  now they're calling to replace the vaccine passports with vaccine cards. So the passports
[3:08:14.280 --> 3:08:18.920]  right now allow you to have supposedly a PCR test every 24 hours if you'd like to go out and public
[3:08:18.920 --> 3:08:24.120]  and socialize with any humans. Otherwise, they're calling for those to be replaced by vaccination
[3:08:24.120 --> 3:08:29.400]  card certifications. So basically you can. We are literally seeing the formation of a prison
[3:08:29.400 --> 3:08:35.560]  planet. Everything we foretold, it's now being launched and instead of like arguing, this is
[3:08:35.560 --> 3:08:40.120]  wrong. You're lying about the numbers. It needs to be your globalist setting up worldwide martial
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:45.800]  law. You need to be arrested and the people that launched this ran the Wuhan lab, Bill Gates,
[3:08:45.800 --> 3:08:51.480]  and of course Fauci, the demon. Well, good luck with your children and you're an amazing lady.
[3:08:51.480 --> 3:08:56.200]  Everybody's amazing that cares about truth and justice and people that have children are so
[3:08:56.200 --> 3:09:00.680]  special. And the enemy hates that. Thank you so much for calling. Look, I got.
[3:09:01.960 --> 3:09:05.880]  I got Joe Salete set to take over and I'm not going to cut it to him anymore. But if Asha,
[3:09:05.880 --> 3:09:11.800]  who's held so long, will be our first caller tomorrow on a stack of Bibles, guys, call Asha.
[3:09:11.800 --> 3:09:15.800]  Instead of getting three minutes, we'll get 10 minutes. Same with Jay and Jill. If you'll just
[3:09:15.800 --> 3:09:20.360]  all let us call you at 1130 tomorrow, 30 minutes of the show, I will open the phones up then and
[3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:23.880]  take these three callers because I've got to get to Joe Salete. He's got a lot to cover,
[3:09:23.880 --> 3:09:28.840]  trans forecaster, then the war room today, three to six p.m. coming up after that. Well,
[3:09:28.840 --> 3:09:33.800]  I covered a lot of it, but so much we didn't get to. I mean, this is just bonkers. At least it's
[3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:38.680]  all out in the open now. You want to straight up fight, ladies and gentlemen, you've got one.
[3:09:38.680 --> 3:09:44.040]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates are literally coming at you with a bio weapon. Gosh almighty.
[3:09:44.040 --> 3:09:47.400]  And they're censoring all the medical doctors exposing it. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:55.480]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever
[3:09:55.480 --> 3:10:01.160]  done. All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my
[3:10:01.160 --> 3:10:08.520]  efforts to bring the truth forward. Well, it's all come down to this. I'm having a cyber symposium
[3:10:08.520 --> 3:10:16.040]  on August 10th, 11th and 12th. This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight

[3:10:52.200 --> 3:10:58.600]  War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement edition to infowarstore.com. Now,
[3:10:58.600 --> 3:11:03.720]  I've been supplementing with greens, fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time. And so I was
[3:11:03.720 --> 3:11:09.400]  excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to infowarstore.com. But then I read
[3:11:09.400 --> 3:11:15.480]  the ingredients and I was blown away. Listen to this. Organic pea fiber, organic alpha leaf,
[3:11:15.480 --> 3:11:21.320]  organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout,
[3:11:21.320 --> 3:11:26.440]  organic quinoa sprout. Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:30.600]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life changing supplement for your health. And we've
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:37.480]  packed it all in to fibergreencaps at infowarstore.com. So I'm excited to add this to my supplement
[3:11:37.480 --> 3:11:43.320]  routine every day. I suggest that you do the same thing. And right now it's at an introductory
[3:11:43.320 --> 3:12:01.800]  price of $19.95. That's 33% off at infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:12:14.280 --> 3:12:30.040]  We have made the deliberate decision to temporarily enhance police officer's authority for the
[3:12:30.040 --> 3:12:35.560]  duration of the stay at home order. Moving forward, police will have the authority to
[3:12:35.560 --> 3:12:41.960]  require any individual who is not in a place of residence to first provide their purpose for
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:48.600]  not being at home and provide their home address. Police will also have the authority to stop a
[3:12:48.600 --> 3:12:55.160]  vehicle to inquire about an individual's reason for leaving their residence. Stay home, keep your
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:13:02.040]  distance or now pay the price. Police with axes and assault rifles raided this venue in
[3:13:02.040 --> 3:13:08.280]  Sao Paulo and found about 600 party goers, most without masks. It was a case of asking people
[3:13:08.280 --> 3:13:13.560]  to go home and if they didn't, arrest them. Nine police checkpoints have now been set up around
[3:13:13.560 --> 3:13:19.320]  the perimeter of Auckland as its 1.6 million residents returned to level three lockdown.
[3:13:19.320 --> 3:13:24.760]  This is the video that raised questions about how New York City is enforcing social distancing.
[3:13:24.760 --> 3:13:29.640]  The man was handcuffed in the stands for not wearing a mask. Disturbing video showing a
[3:13:29.640 --> 3:13:35.560]  violent clash between apparent social distancing violators and police in Brooklyn. And this cell
[3:13:35.560 --> 3:13:40.440]  phone video capturing the moment an officer waves at Taser and repeatedly strikes a bystander
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:48.680]  during a social distancing bust. Get your hands off of me. You are kidnapping me. I have got nothing illegal.
[3:13:54.520 --> 3:13:59.800]  Canadians are being hit with penalties now as governments move to reinforce the shutdowns
[3:13:59.800 --> 3:14:03.720]  right across the country. And the city is also taking their mask mandate seriously,
[3:14:03.720 --> 3:14:08.280]  a fire rescue commissioner from the Tampa area was arrested on Duval Street Wednesday night when
[3:14:08.280 --> 3:14:13.480]  he and others were spotted without masks. It's more than just a suggestion, it is a CDC recommendation
[3:14:13.480 --> 3:14:19.000]  that has all become sort of like lock law that you can't really trifle with. Ladies and gentlemen,
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:26.600]  this gathering is unfortunately lawful, unlawful under the coronavirus regulations we have currently.
[3:14:26.600 --> 3:14:32.040]  The officer explains that she is being arrested. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:14:32.040 --> 3:14:38.760]  and now we've got him, Gerald Salente, the trans forecaster on August 2nd on this Monday
[3:14:38.760 --> 3:14:44.920]  transmission, Gerald Salente. Hey, thanks for having me on Alex. This is very heartbreaking what's
[3:14:44.920 --> 3:14:53.880]  going on. And those videos that they were just showing is it's they just had protests in Germany
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:15:01.560]  this past weekend. And you see the police beating up people, beating up little kids, pushing and
[3:15:01.560 --> 3:15:10.200]  punching women, these little boys. What is this, the third Reich is back? And you know, this is
[3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:15.880]  what we wrote about in the trends journal, the new ones coming out this week, knock, knock,
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:25.080]  it's the COVID police. Death camps next. And we go on to write about how in New South Wales,
[3:15:25.080 --> 3:15:31.160]  they have the police and army are knocking at the doors of homes to make sure there's nobody
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:37.160]  inside the property who should not be there. And helicopters are flying across the region
[3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:45.480]  to make sure no one is breaking the rules. And they just announced that some 300 ADF troops joined
[3:15:45.480 --> 3:15:53.720]  the North, South Wales COVID cops patrolling the streets and knocking on doors. What kind
[3:15:53.720 --> 3:16:03.000]  of world is this? Are death camps next? And I don't say this in a way that's, you know, oh my
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:13.880]  God, how could you say that? Go back to New South Wales. First of all, you got this stupid freak
[3:16:13.880 --> 3:16:19.400]  that's been jerking around whatever name is glad has been jerking, you know, off down there in
[3:16:19.400 --> 3:16:33.560]  Australia, putting out these mandates. So far out of New South Wales, north, New South Wales,
[3:16:35.000 --> 3:16:43.960]  8.1 million people, 8.1 million people. Since mid June, when they began this whole lockdown
[3:16:43.960 --> 3:16:57.240]  craziness again, the grand total of 3427 cases, look at the headline, extends mass mere date
[3:16:57.240 --> 3:17:04.120]  for Sydney as COVID clusters grow. Oh, cluster? How about a cluster FU? You know what? Yeah,
[3:17:04.120 --> 3:17:09.240]  remember those kind of clusters? Yeah, because that's what this is. This is a cluster F.
[3:17:09.240 --> 3:17:22.280]  You ready? Since the COVID war began 19 months ago, out of those 8.1 million people,
[3:17:23.400 --> 3:17:29.400]  look at these little boys, look at these little boys, you get these guys man to man one on one,
[3:17:29.400 --> 3:17:35.000]  and then you could bring these little, you could bring these little low life pieces of crap down.
[3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:42.600]  Look what they do. Anyway, you ready? 19 months.
[3:17:42.600 --> 3:18:00.920]  You know how many people died? 69. 69 people died in, since last, since January 2020.
[3:18:00.920 --> 3:18:19.400]  This is, this is outrageous. Oh, and now with the new cluster, the cases 3427 cases reported
[3:18:19.400 --> 3:18:31.720]  since mid June, a month and a half ago. Out of those 3427 cases,
[3:18:33.800 --> 3:18:37.800]  that's six people died. And you know what the latest one was? This is the headline.
[3:18:39.080 --> 3:18:45.320]  According to the New Daily, the latest was a man in his 90s. Oh, yeah? A man in his 90s,
[3:18:45.320 --> 3:18:50.120]  who's going to listen to, who's going to live to 99 and a half. But the COVID got him.
[3:18:51.720 --> 3:18:59.320]  Maybe the COVID didn't get him. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.
[3:19:01.400 --> 3:19:07.880]  Look at these little boys. Look how tough they are. Come and do that to me. Come and do that to me.
[3:19:09.080 --> 3:19:15.000]  You little clown, you're all by yourself. Don't bring your other little flunkies around.
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:20.680]  You little guys with cahones smaller than a mothball. You little disgusting human beings.
[3:19:21.240 --> 3:19:25.080]  We are going into a third rake around the world.
[3:19:27.640 --> 3:19:34.680]  Yeah. The guy in his 90s had died. He just got the vast, vast, the, the AstraZeneca shot.
[3:19:34.680 --> 3:19:41.400]  The AstraZeneca shot that they're promoting in Australia. The Astrid, look at these, look at
[3:19:41.400 --> 3:19:54.520]  these guys. Look at them. Akon, you little Nazi slime balls. Look at them. Look at them.
[3:19:56.440 --> 3:20:01.240]  The break in the COVID rules. Look at them.
[3:20:01.240 --> 3:20:11.560]  If we don't fight for freedom, it's all aboard next train to Auschwitz.
[3:20:12.680 --> 3:20:19.480]  And you've got these slime balls like this Piers Morgan flabby faced freak.
[3:20:22.040 --> 3:20:23.800]  Oh, don't get angry, Solenti.
[3:20:23.800 --> 3:20:29.720]  Follow the orders. Get on board.
[3:20:32.440 --> 3:20:42.120]  That little boy, that little slobby, freaky face, Piers Morgan calling everybody a little
[3:20:43.240 --> 3:20:48.440]  pee. Yeah. That won't get the vaccination. We'll be right back.
[3:20:48.440 --> 3:20:53.720]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:20:54.440 --> 3:21:00.040]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support,
[3:21:00.600 --> 3:21:04.920]  and for word of mouth. And then we're all in this together. And I, you know, it gets old having
[3:21:04.920 --> 3:21:08.440]  to come to you and say, Hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:21:08.440 --> 3:21:12.360]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this
[3:21:12.360 --> 3:21:17.160]  level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and almost shut
[3:21:17.160 --> 3:21:21.160]  down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups and we're still here. And as this whole
[3:21:21.160 --> 3:21:25.800]  new world order comes out and be open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got
[3:21:25.800 --> 3:21:29.560]  to be taken off there. That's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other
[3:21:29.560 --> 3:21:34.920]  nations enslaved and America still quasi free. You can't have info wars has been proven right
[3:21:34.920 --> 3:21:39.720]  being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold. Because if you think stuff's bad now,
[3:21:39.720 --> 3:21:45.000]  just get ready. So thank you all and get an info or store.com. Get some great 2020 election shirts,
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:48.520]  supplements and so much more. They're wonderful products and they support the info. Thank you.
[3:21:50.760 --> 3:21:56.680]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on
[3:21:57.480 --> 3:22:03.160]  and that it's criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public that do the same
[3:22:03.160 --> 3:22:09.160]  things over and over again. And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[3:22:09.160 --> 3:22:17.160]  Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist's globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the
[3:22:17.160 --> 3:22:21.800]  mistreatment of it with ACT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV. And
[3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:26.840]  they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the
[3:22:26.840 --> 3:22:32.840]  T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders. The problem for them was the viruses
[3:22:32.840 --> 3:22:38.520]  would then break down and would be non lethal down the road. That's why they need to run
[3:22:38.520 --> 3:22:43.720]  out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your
[3:22:43.720 --> 3:22:48.440]  immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV. That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:22:50.760 --> 3:22:56.360]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic and making you feel weak,
[3:22:56.360 --> 3:23:00.920]  making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the
[3:23:00.920 --> 3:23:05.640]  image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will,
[3:23:05.640 --> 3:23:12.520]  being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[3:23:12.520 --> 3:23:17.400]  an entire system. And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able
[3:23:17.400 --> 3:23:22.040]  to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your
[3:23:22.040 --> 3:23:26.840]  wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music,
[3:23:26.840 --> 3:23:31.960]  the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic. And that itself
[3:23:31.960 --> 3:23:38.200]  is what God teaches us is worship. So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL,
[3:23:38.200 --> 3:23:42.840]  don't worship all the things in the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by
[3:23:42.840 --> 3:23:48.120]  God and appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you
[3:23:48.120 --> 3:23:54.840]  still have it. Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial
[3:23:54.840 --> 3:24:00.040]  that I've ever done. All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five
[3:24:00.040 --> 3:24:06.920]  months in my efforts to bring the truth forward. Well, it's all come down to this. I'm having a
[3:24:06.920 --> 3:24:14.920]  cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th. This historical event will be live streamed 72

[3:24:37.240 --> 3:24:56.520]  bless. Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code Alex or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code Alex.
[3:25:07.560 --> 3:25:23.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:25:25.880 --> 3:25:31.240]  Hey, straight beyond the Alex Jones show. I'm very upset. I'm a visionary.
[3:25:31.240 --> 3:25:37.560]  I've written the books, Trends 2000, Trend Tracking, Far Better Than Megatrends, Time Magazine.
[3:25:38.280 --> 3:25:45.000]  I've been publishing the Trends Journal since 1991. Trends Research Institute since 1981.
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:49.800]  I'll put my tracker grid up against anybody in the world. Show me what you've done and we can
[3:25:49.800 --> 3:25:58.120]  start talking. I see the future and the future is hell on earth. I was talking about Australia.
[3:25:58.120 --> 3:26:09.080]  They got these little clowns. Look at the clown show of a woman that's the premier.
[3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:14.200]  And by the way, the word premier, look at it. There she is. Gladys been jerking around.
[3:26:14.760 --> 3:26:21.960]  And look at the little jerk behind her with a mask on. Wait, what are you doing standing up there?
[3:26:21.960 --> 3:26:31.080]  She can't stand by herself. They all do this. It's a flunky freak show. Who's your favorite flunky?
[3:26:31.080 --> 3:26:37.080]  Hey, all your repulsive kids, you like Mitch McConnell? Oh, there's a brilliant looking dude.
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:44.680]  How about Lindsay? Did you come out of the closet yet, Graham? No, no, no. I'm a dumbo crap.
[3:26:44.680 --> 3:26:53.240]  I like little Chuckie Schumacher. No, no, Diane, not so fine. She's my kind of person
[3:26:53.240 --> 3:27:00.440]  that I would bow down to and take any crap that she spews out. How about B.S. Biden?
[3:27:01.960 --> 3:27:09.240]  No, no, no. I like little Katzoh McCro and Alma for friends. A little druggy to Bankster in Italy.
[3:27:09.240 --> 3:27:17.400]  Get it, everybody. Get it in your head. We've been taken over. Look at this.
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:23.480]  Germany. Here you go. This is coming out in the Trends Journal.
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:30.280]  Where do we go here? Okay. Over the weekend, there were anti lockdown protests in Europe.
[3:27:30.280 --> 3:27:35.160]  As we noted in this Trends Journal, the rough, tough, heavily armed German COVID cops beat
[3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:42.600]  up little kids and women in Germany for not obeying COVID war rules. Indeed, as we noted in our 13
[3:27:42.600 --> 3:27:51.240]  December Trends Journal, under the auspices of fighting the COVID war, Germany has reimposed
[3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:58.120]  third right rules. We wrote quote. Look at this. Look at this. Look at that. Look at this.
[3:27:58.120 --> 3:28:06.200]  Look at this. Hitting little kids. I would love, I would love for one of these guys. I don't care
[3:28:06.200 --> 3:28:12.680]  how big you are, who you think you are. You come after me, man to man. I will. I will. You try to
[3:28:12.680 --> 3:28:18.280]  kill me. I'll kill you first. That's right. I attack the attacker. Look at them. Look at them.
[3:28:18.280 --> 3:28:25.720]  Look what they're doing. Look at this. Anyway, going back this past November, several thousand
[3:28:25.720 --> 3:28:32.440]  Germans took to the street in Berlin in protest of the new, you ready? Infection protection law
[3:28:33.400 --> 3:28:39.400]  approved by the parliament, which gives the chancellor, that's a dirty word. That's a curse
[3:28:39.400 --> 3:28:51.160]  word calling some scumbags, chancellors, prime ministers, presidents. Look at this. Those are
[3:28:51.160 --> 3:28:57.480]  curse words. That's profanity. Oh, a dignitary. Yeah. F you dignitary. Anyway,
[3:29:01.320 --> 3:29:09.000]  the protesters compared the new law to the enabling act of 1933, which gave Adolf Hitler
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:16.120]  the right of dictatorship over the country. And I would trend forecast again as witnessed by the
[3:29:16.120 --> 3:29:21.320]  brutality of the COVID cops in Germany and other nations and your theater authoritarian,
[3:29:21.320 --> 3:29:26.520]  draconian lockdown orders imposed by the world's rulers, which they are enforcing.
[3:29:27.320 --> 3:29:32.680]  Should the COVID war continue to escalate, the battle for freedom, peace and justice will descend
[3:29:32.680 --> 3:29:38.680]  into a war between the people and the state with those not supporting the governments
[3:29:38.680 --> 3:29:48.360]  sent to reform camps. And then we go on to write indeed, world war two in the concentration camps
[3:29:48.360 --> 3:29:57.240]  are not ancient history. The horrors of war are alive and well. This was reported Sunday in DW news.
[3:29:57.240 --> 3:30:08.200]  Europe remembers Sinti Roma murdered on the Nazi rule on August 2nd, 1944. All right. 1944 is not
[3:30:08.200 --> 3:30:18.760]  ancient history. I'm born in 46. Okay. This isn't ancient history. 4,300 Sinti and Roma were killed
[3:30:18.760 --> 3:30:26.360]  in gas chambers of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Genocide survivors described the horrors.
[3:30:26.360 --> 3:30:35.320]  Dear Benetta, this is, I have to tell you that my two youngest children have died. Those words
[3:30:35.320 --> 3:30:44.200]  were written. This is heartbreaking. By Margarit Bamberg in 1943, led it to a sister in Berlin.
[3:30:45.800 --> 3:30:51.400]  It was smuggled out of what was known as the gypsy camp at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration
[3:30:51.400 --> 3:31:00.280]  camps. This isn't ancient history. Don't you see what's going on? Don't you see what's going on?
[3:31:01.000 --> 3:31:08.920]  It's them against us. And look at them. Look at that flabby face piece of crap.
[3:31:10.840 --> 3:31:19.080]  Stupid imbecilic moron. Piers Morgan. This clown is all over the news. Look at this guy.
[3:31:19.080 --> 3:31:29.080]  Who would believe a thing that comes out of that fat, flabby face scum looking creep?
[3:31:30.920 --> 3:31:36.440]  This is what's doing it to us. Here. This is what he says.
[3:31:38.760 --> 3:31:42.920]  Piers Morgan, who got two jibs, as we write in the Trends Journal of the AstraZeneca
[3:31:42.920 --> 3:31:50.760]  Jab, the AstraZeneca Jab that they have banned in Norway and Switzerland. And this clown jerk,
[3:31:50.760 --> 3:31:59.960]  little piece of scum over there in Australia down in New South Wales. The guy's name is
[3:31:59.960 --> 3:32:07.240]  perfect for it. He's the chief medical offer. Michael Kidd. All right? Michael Kidd. Are you
[3:32:07.240 --> 3:32:15.400]  kidding me? A little piece of jerk. He goes on to say that the benefits of the COVID-19 AstraZeneca
[3:32:15.400 --> 3:32:23.240]  are greater than the risks of the rare effects concerning in all age groups. All right? Look
[3:32:23.240 --> 3:32:37.560]  at this. These are the clowns that are telling us what to do. AstraZeneca. Flabby face, fat boy,
[3:32:37.560 --> 3:32:48.040]  potbelly peers got the AstraZeneca two jibs and got it again. They're not working yesterday
[3:32:48.040 --> 3:32:54.440]  on Face the Nation. The health minister from Israel said there, and they gave them the Pfizer
[3:32:54.440 --> 3:33:02.440]  injections. They're 50% accurate. And that's just now. And what are they doing to our bodies?
[3:33:02.440 --> 3:33:10.680]  Why, you shut up, Salenti. You will go to jail. I heard him go after Salenti. He doesn't believe
[3:33:10.680 --> 3:33:19.480]  Pierce Morgan and all that little, who's that other little guy? Pencil steel. Pencil penis steel.
[3:33:20.440 --> 3:33:30.840]  Telling me what to do here. Today's toilet paper record. Officials enlist stars of TikTok
[3:33:30.840 --> 3:33:40.360]  in vaccine war. Official pieces of crap. Who are you calling official? Some bureaucratic scum
[3:33:40.360 --> 3:33:47.640]  who sucks off the public tit and does what they're told to do? And who are you telling me to listen
[3:33:47.640 --> 3:33:55.880]  to? I'll tell you who. Ellie Zeller, 17, a TikTok creator with over 10 million followers,
[3:33:56.760 --> 3:34:02.920]  received an email in June from Village Marketing, an influencer marketing agency,
[3:34:02.920 --> 3:34:08.040]  with Ms. Zilla, a high school student senior, who usually posts short fashion and lifestyle
[3:34:08.040 --> 3:34:14.920]  videos, be willing, the agency worded, to participate in the White House back campaign,
[3:34:14.920 --> 3:34:22.360]  encouraging her audience to get vaccinated. There's a massive need to grow awareness,
[3:34:22.360 --> 3:34:27.560]  blah, blah, blah, blah. They said Ms. Zeller quickly agreed. I got some kid telling me,
[3:34:28.280 --> 3:34:33.720]  how Hitler, that's what you're doing to us. Get it in your head. Get it in your head, everybody.
[3:34:33.720 --> 3:34:39.960]  If we don't unite for freedom, peace and justice, we are, it's a fight for our lives.

[3:36:37.160 --> 3:36:41.000]  that trained the Coserville Home Institute in Germany. And Full Wars will continue to

[3:39:30.520 --> 3:39:37.560]  This is, this is, this is, uh, we're in, we're in the 1930s here in the late 1930s.
[3:39:37.560 --> 3:39:42.840]  We're, COVID war has begun and now they're ramping up, you know, the COVID war everywhere.
[3:39:42.840 --> 3:39:47.560]  If we don't unite for freedom, peace and justice, we're finished and you can't do without money

[3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:57.800]  you're doing it for free. You know, it's not like a donation deal. Like, like, like Pfizer,
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:03.320]  yeah, the drug dealers, big people call them big pharma, call them drug lords, grow the hell up.
[3:40:03.320 --> 3:40:10.040]  Oh, that guy Scott Gottlieb, Scott Gottlieb. It used to be on the, the, the, uh, food and drug
[3:40:10.040 --> 3:40:15.800]  administration under, uh, Trump. Oh, you know, he's on the board of director. Yeah. Pfizer
[3:40:15.800 --> 3:40:21.320]  gave buy in a million bucks to celebrate his inauguration. So if you don't give money and

[3:40:38.840 --> 3:40:44.360]  trends journal, we wrote the facts that, yeah, the chances of getting it outside, according to
[3:40:44.360 --> 3:40:50.840]  Dr. Newsom, are substantially less than 1% out to a transmission, but they're locking down again

[3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:58.760]  record over here. New York Times. All the news that's fit to print. All right, that shows you
[3:42:58.760 --> 3:43:05.320]  the arrogance of these little boys and girls. Who the hell are you to tell me what's fit to print?
[3:43:06.520 --> 3:43:13.320]  Oh, hey, don't you know we are? Yeah, we're prostitutes. We get paid to put out
[3:43:14.200 --> 3:43:21.880]  by our corporate pimps and our government horn masters. Oh, yeah, all the news that's
[3:43:21.880 --> 3:43:27.480]  set to print your little slime balls. Oh, yeah, like that said, I'm who's saying has those aluminum
[3:43:27.480 --> 3:43:33.400]  tubes that he's making weapons of mass destruction with your lying so bees that brought us into the
[3:43:33.400 --> 3:43:43.400]  Iraq war. Anyway, going on. That story I was writing about officials in list. Again, officials
[3:43:43.400 --> 3:43:52.520]  is profanity. What official official piece of crap. They go on to say about getting these young
[3:43:52.520 --> 3:44:00.120]  people tapping influencers to steer facts to youths, to steer facts, the crap that they're
[3:44:00.120 --> 3:44:07.480]  shoving down our throat of the facts. Anyway, to reach these young people, the White House is
[3:44:07.480 --> 3:44:16.840]  enlisted in eclectic army of more than 50 twitch twitch streamers, YouTubers, TikTokers, and to
[3:44:16.840 --> 3:44:25.720]  reach 18 year old pop star. And the 18 year old pop star Olivia Rodrigo, all of them with enormous
[3:44:25.720 --> 3:44:33.000]  online audiences. Propaganda is supreme. And here's the arrogance of what they write.
[3:44:35.320 --> 3:44:43.160]  The efforts are in part a counterattack against the rising tide of vaccine misinformation.
[3:44:43.160 --> 3:44:55.160]  The anti vaccine side of the Internet is still on on all this vaccine news said Samir
[3:44:55.160 --> 3:45:03.880]  Madrava, the administrator of several meme pages. What the hell do I care what an 18 year old thinks?
[3:45:03.880 --> 3:45:13.320]  Or a 17 year old tiktok. You're going to tell me you're going to tell me the facts. Who are you
[3:45:13.320 --> 3:45:20.600]  talking to? I put out a magazine, the trends journal. Last week was only 158 pages and no
[3:45:20.600 --> 3:45:28.200]  ads. All the facts, all the facts. And I got little kids. I'm pushing us out there because
[3:45:28.200 --> 3:45:34.120]  you can see the propaganda. And it's how them it's them against us. It's them against us. It's
[3:45:34.120 --> 3:45:43.400]  them against us. All aboard. That's trained to Auschwitz. Yeah, their Auschwitz is back in
[3:45:43.400 --> 3:45:52.520]  Germany right in front of your eyes. Right in front of your eyes. And this is how they do it.
[3:45:52.520 --> 3:46:03.560]  They get these all these other people against us celebrities, Sean Pencil. What the hell are you
[3:46:03.560 --> 3:46:10.120]  talking about? Oh, if you don't get vaccinated, you can't get on the set. These are actors. Oh,
[3:46:10.120 --> 3:46:17.640]  the word celebrities. Yeah, if you with that word, what celebrity, some crap pet that knows how to
[3:46:17.640 --> 3:46:25.560]  memorize lives and play a role of being somebody that they're not because the real person they are
[3:46:25.560 --> 3:46:36.840]  are as empty as a bottle of crap. A celebrity screw you pencil. Yeah, and take that pencil pen
[3:46:36.840 --> 3:46:43.720]  and shove it up your pen. You know what? And I'll say that to your face. 57 John Street,
[3:46:43.720 --> 3:46:51.400]  Kings to New York, you come to me man to man and try to push your crap on me man to man.
[3:46:53.240 --> 3:46:59.240]  Any one of you COVID cops, come over here and try to inject me or tell me what to do.
[3:47:02.600 --> 3:47:12.600]  Man to man. These aren't men. These are your s s are back in Germany. I just read to you what
[3:47:12.600 --> 3:47:22.120]  they did in passing that law last November. How dare you don't want to take a vaccination,
[3:47:22.120 --> 3:47:31.960]  a gene therapy shot unapproved by the FDA and operation warped speed. You got to be warped in
[3:47:31.960 --> 3:47:40.040]  their head. Oh, and all you people that are forcing it on us. I guess it's not working for you.
[3:47:40.040 --> 3:47:44.120]  And they want us to go down with you to what happened over there in Providence, Rhode Island.
[3:47:46.040 --> 3:47:50.120]  75% of the people that got vaccinated got the virus again.
[3:47:51.640 --> 3:47:55.800]  Guess it ain't working, huh? Oh, yeah, but they weren't as sick as they were. Oh, hey,
[3:47:55.800 --> 3:48:06.760]  flabby face, fat mouth, piece of crap. Piers Morgan said how sick he was after catching it the
[3:48:06.760 --> 3:48:15.640]  second time. Flabby face, jerk around, can't say the other word because that would be that would
[3:48:15.640 --> 3:48:22.600]  be proper. Look at it. If we don't unite and fight for freedom, we're gone. It's over. Get it in your
[3:48:22.600 --> 3:48:30.120]  head, everybody. You can't go to college without a vaccination. New York, Danny Myers, another
[3:48:30.120 --> 3:48:36.120]  little arrogant boy. You can't go into his places if you don't get the shot. I got the shot. You
[3:48:36.120 --> 3:48:45.720]  can take it up. You know what? You see what they're doing? Italy. No shot, no restaurants. France,
[3:48:45.720 --> 3:48:51.160]  no shot, no restaurants. I told everybody, oh, they're doing this to get rid of Trump. I said,
[3:48:51.160 --> 3:48:55.000]  you're full of baloney. Has nothing to do with Trump. They're doing it everywhere.
