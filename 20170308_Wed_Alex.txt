[00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:15.916]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.879]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:22.502]  Well, Peter Thiel's come out and said the tide of globalism is going out.
[00:00:22.502 --> 00:00:29.568]  The world government of the corporatist is falling.
[00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:34.993]  Now, we have got obviously another jam-packed transmission lined up for you today.
[00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:51.712]  The first thing I want to get into is the fact that the media is in a total and absolute complete push to act like Trump needs to be impeached because he said that Obama was spying on him.
[00:00:51.712 --> 00:01:00.216]  But the Democrats were on the news admitting that they were spying on Trump during the campaign and after the campaign as well.
[00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:05.099]  So we have all of that unfolding and we have the spectacle of CNN still
[00:01:06.423 --> 00:01:15.495]  Almost 48 hours later, two days after Vault 7 broke, biggest thing in WikiLeaks history, has said nothing about it.
[00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:20.562]  Separately, we have had multiple posts on Facebook completely disappear.
[00:01:22.423 --> 00:01:32.088]  And Facebook now brags to China, we are now officially censoring in the US, we're ready to enter the Chinese market in a press release.
[00:01:32.088 --> 00:01:51.799]  So, they're putting out announcements to China, we're ready to censor, we're ready to move into your market, we're ready to come to communist China, the biggest mass murderers in history, we're ready to work with people that have killed five times what Hitler did, Mao killed 80 plus million of his own people alone, tens of millions more killed, we're ready to come to your country,
[00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:54.907]  We're ready to censor.
[00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:57.189]  We've already practiced it in Europe and the United States.
[00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.350]  Remember he told Merkel last year, I'm going to start censoring?
[00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.192]  He has.
[00:02:01.192 --> 00:02:07.336]  Meanwhile, they don't even send you notices when they censor you.
[00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:09.178]  They just deep-six your article or video.
[00:02:09.178 --> 00:02:10.939]  We had a video a few weeks ago with 14 million views.
[00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.180]  They didn't send us a notice.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.181]  There was nothing wrong with it.
[00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:14.542]  They just disappeared it.
[00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:16.924]  And then they go on the news and deny it's even happening.
[00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:24.470]  Until now, they've told USA Today that, yes, we're starting to censor.
[00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.871]  And ladies and gentlemen, it's interesting what they're censoring.
[00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:37.996]  They deleted an article about Rand Paul coming on this show and talking about the deep state spying on Trump and how Trump's right.
[00:02:37.996 --> 00:02:40.977]  They don't want any coverage of that, any traction.
[00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:43.798]  And they also deleted an article by Paul Watson.
[00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:44.479]  Didn't tell us why.
[00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:51.462]  Former CIA analyst Obama gave green light for NSA, CIA to sabotage Trump.
[00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:53.323]  Very credible.
[00:02:53.323 --> 00:03:03.950]  Former senior CIA ran an entire section of the CIA, that's top echelon, saying, oh no, my current colleagues say they were sabotaged, ordered to sabotage Trump.
[00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.111]  Because it's so credible.
[00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.493]  It's so powerful.
[00:03:07.493 --> 00:03:08.754]  They don't want Congress hearing about this.
[00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:09.994]  They don't want this guy getting any attention.
[00:03:09.994 --> 00:03:11.535]  I want to get him on the show, by the way.
[00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:13.277]  So they just shut down the interview from RT.
[00:03:15.182 --> 00:03:19.745]  They're not shutting us down because we're fake, they're shutting us down because we're so credible.
[00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:32.835]  Remember, in 2004, it's so old, our archives aren't even on the web anymore, we had to go to the Wayback Machine, and in 2006, we wrote the very first articles of anybody.
[00:03:32.835 --> 00:03:43.963]  For Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and we'll put one of those up on screen, where tech companies announce that they're using the microphones
[00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.633]  That are in your computers to listen to.
[00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:54.878]  In fact, CJ brought it in to me and I had it printed out, but metaphysically this article isn't meant to be seen.
[00:03:54.878 --> 00:03:55.499]  I can't find it.
[00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:56.600]  You guys punched that up.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.321]  You did find the 2006.
[00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.004]  Punch that up for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[00:04:01.004 --> 00:04:02.626]  And there we are first.
[00:04:04.193 --> 00:04:07.659]  Showing everyone the information, going over it, documenting.
[00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.563]  Everybody knows, we've told you, your laptop's watching you.
[00:04:10.563 --> 00:04:15.471]  It's not just, does it sometimes, it's the companies that are doing it, much bigger than the government.
[00:04:17.403 --> 00:04:18.484]  So this is all coming up.
[00:04:18.484 --> 00:04:24.306]  We'll show you the article when we come back and a bunch of others that we've written over the years documenting all this.
[00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:27.328]  We told you two years ago Samsung was watching you.
[00:04:27.328 --> 00:04:31.550]  Samsung put it in their terms of service when you buy the TV.
[00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.891]  Who thinks when you buy a TV you're going to read 50 pages of terms of service?
[00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:36.932]  And it says, watch what you do.
[00:04:36.932 --> 00:04:38.753]  Third parties are watching and listening.
[00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.253]  I mean, I'd love to say I broke all that, but I didn't.
[00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:46.735]  They said they were doing it.
[00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:50.477]  They told the world they were doing it.
[00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:56.842]  So we're going to come back and break all this down and getting the incredible economic numbers on both sides, the good, the bad, the ugly.
[00:04:56.842 --> 00:04:57.482]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:57.482 --> 00:04:59.564]  Spread the video link if you're watching us at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:00.104 --> 00:05:11.973]  A previously debunked claim alleging then candidate Donald Trump ran a secret server to communicate with Russia during the 2016 presidential race has resurfaced.
[00:05:11.973 --> 00:05:15.776]  The establishment mainstream media is now rehashing the story.
[00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:16.216]  I think?
[00:05:33.644 --> 00:05:37.445]  So called secret server to talk with the Russians.
[00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:40.166]  And look who's spreading the fake news.
[00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:47.927]  Hillary Clinton posted on Twitter that it's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia.
[00:05:47.927 --> 00:05:54.629]  And she included a link to the original Slate article that started the bogus rumor to begin with.
[00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.650]  You can check out the real news right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:00.168 --> 00:06:02.009]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:08.611]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:06:08.611 --> 00:06:11.772]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:21.555]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:06:21.555 --> 00:06:22.396]  Caveman.
[00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:27.477]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:06:27.477 --> 00:06:29.578]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:06:29.878 --> 00:06:33.020]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.183]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:06:38.183 --> 00:06:46.308]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:06:46.308 --> 00:06:54.172]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:58.915]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and fullworthslife.com today.
[00:07:00.094 --> 00:07:02.375]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:03.955]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:07:03.955 --> 00:07:07.856]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[00:07:07.856 --> 00:07:15.799]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:20.760]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:26.222]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:07:26.562 --> 00:07:34.345]  Zika 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:39.066]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:07:39.066 --> 00:07:47.869]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:51.630]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[00:07:55.531 --> 00:08:10.616]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:10.616 --> 00:08:15.497]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:15.497 --> 00:08:16.958]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:39.366 --> 00:08:43.808]  All right, this will be a broadcast long remembered.
[00:08:43.808 --> 00:08:48.510]  It's the eighth day of March 2017.
[00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.951]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:49.951 --> 00:08:53.433]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:54.893]  We have several in-studio guests.
[00:08:54.893 --> 00:09:00.336]  I'll tell you about those folks a little bit later, at the start of the next segment.
[00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:02.177]  But before I go any further,
[00:09:04.334 --> 00:09:09.358]  290,000 jobs created in Trump's first month, shattering expectations.
[00:09:09.358 --> 00:09:12.641]  That's a Paul Joseph Watson article at Infowars.com.
[00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:16.664]  It's also in the Associated Press.
[00:09:16.664 --> 00:09:20.347]  Why is the MSM ignoring Trump's sex trafficking bust?
[00:09:20.347 --> 00:09:24.190]  Town Hall finally asked the question we've been bringing up.
[00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.391]  That is super important.
[00:09:25.391 --> 00:09:33.277]  But getting back to the economy, Samsung is announcing they're going to move their giant factory from Mexico to the United States.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.802]  All because they know the corporate tax is going to be cut down to make it competitive.
[00:09:39.802 --> 00:09:44.684]  Amazing things are happening all over the place.
[00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:57.009]  And Ivanka Trump's clothing line, kicked out of Macy's and other stores, is now selling at double any previous record for her clothing line, even last year.
[00:09:57.009 --> 00:10:00.671]  So, the good news is they're trying to sell
[00:10:02.048 --> 00:10:11.110]  The idea that they can bully and intimidate us and shut us down as we try to build our own markets and have our own ideas and try to create a chilling effect of intimidation.
[00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.751]  That's not going to work.
[00:10:13.751 --> 00:10:17.192]  Because the tide of globalism is going out.
[00:10:17.192 --> 00:10:23.133]  The former head of Davos came on the show last week and said globalism is a corrupt, evil institution that is imploding.
[00:10:24.551 --> 00:10:27.032]  What they claimed it was for was always a lie.
[00:10:27.032 --> 00:10:33.496]  And Peter Thiel has gone public saying it's collapsing and that history is completely pulling away from it.
[00:10:33.496 --> 00:10:38.879]  So the globalists need to know their criminal operation will be defeated.
[00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:43.362]  And no amount of kicking and screaming and lying and dirty tricks will put it back together again.
[00:10:43.362 --> 00:10:49.346]  That's why you saw the massive information come out in the Vault 7 leak from the CIA.
[00:10:51.158 --> 00:10:56.425]  And very few globalist publications are even trying to claim that that's the Russians.
[00:10:56.425 --> 00:10:57.726]  No, none of this is the Russians.
[00:10:57.726 --> 00:11:02.252]  It's all US and British intelligence.
[00:11:02.252 --> 00:11:06.797]  British intelligence is leaking info on the pedophile rings at the highest level of government over there.
[00:11:06.797 --> 00:11:09.621]  Major police chiefs are coming out and saying pedophile rings run the government.
[00:11:10.762 --> 00:11:15.804]  Now the media is hardly picking it up, but it's happening all over the Western world.
[00:11:15.804 --> 00:11:20.246]  The people and folks in government are trying to turn the tide against the evil right now.
[00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:24.468]  There is an epic war, a battle going on.
[00:11:24.468 --> 00:11:26.689]  And it's an incredible time to be alive and in the middle of it.
[00:11:28.098 --> 00:11:34.384]  No matter what color you are or where you came from, if you love freedom and justice, we're brothers and sisters together in this epic fight.
[00:11:34.384 --> 00:11:38.327]  And I want to salute you all and thank you all for the work you're doing and the support of this broadcast.
[00:11:38.327 --> 00:11:48.876]  Now, before I get into all the huge news, right up front, we are being censored more and more on Facebook, on Google, and on Twitter.
[00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:51.359]  A lot of our articles, they just won't let us tweet them.
[00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:52.440]  It's never anything vulgar.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.500]  It's never anything even wild.
[00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:57.790]  They don't care about some stupid social justice warrior video of them acting stupid.
[00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.392]  It's okay if that's got 20 million views.
[00:11:59.392 --> 00:12:12.968]  But when we send out an article with a former CIA section chief in intelligence gathering saying that his industry associates
[00:12:15.154 --> 00:12:25.718]  And his CIA associates, he's at the State Department now, all tell him that there was a green light, they were ordered to go after Trump during and after the campaign, and that Trump is correct.
[00:12:25.718 --> 00:12:27.578]  They will not let us have that on Facebook.
[00:12:27.578 --> 00:12:29.159]  They have deleted it.
[00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:29.939]  They take it down.
[00:12:29.939 --> 00:12:31.580]  They don't even tell us why they've done it.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.901]  That is such a big deal.
[00:12:33.901 --> 00:12:40.043]  So we're going to focus more on this InfoWars.com article, and if they won't let us spread it on Facebook, if they delete it off Facebook,
[00:12:40.865 --> 00:12:42.366]  Just our link.
[00:12:42.366 --> 00:12:46.947]  You, as humans, can overpower Mark Zuckerberg and get that article and others out.
[00:12:46.947 --> 00:12:54.771]  We're going to start sending out a daily email of not just our news, but news that's censored, that's accurate.
[00:12:54.771 --> 00:13:08.016]  They also deleted yesterday our post of Rand Paul, the senator, joining us to talk about the deep state at war with Trump and how Trump's right, and how Trump was being wiretapped.
[00:13:08.925 --> 00:13:11.687]  They don't want any credibility on that.
[00:13:11.687 --> 00:13:18.513]  They want to run around saying Trump's insane, with Bloomberg News calling for him to be impeached.
[00:13:18.513 --> 00:13:19.654]  There is a war going on.
[00:13:19.654 --> 00:13:23.197]  If they get away with this censorship, they're going to do it to everybody.
[00:13:23.197 --> 00:13:27.261]  But if we stand up to it, they're going to lose.
[00:13:27.261 --> 00:13:32.305]  The interview is up on InfoWars.com that they do not want you to see.
[00:13:32.305 --> 00:13:33.046]  It's Rand Paul.
[00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:35.107]  Public will live in fear after Vault 7 leaks.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:44.226]  They don't want you to see an 18 minute interview with a sitting U.S.
[00:13:44.226 --> 00:13:47.749]  Senator.
[00:13:47.749 --> 00:13:53.155]  Because they told USA Today starting Sunday they were going to ban fake news or send you a notice.
[00:13:53.155 --> 00:13:54.015]  They don't even do that.
[00:13:54.015 --> 00:13:55.036]  They just delete it.
[00:13:55.036 --> 00:13:57.098]  Was it fake to have a Senator on for 18 minutes?
[00:13:57.915 --> 00:14:04.920]  Was it fake in 2004 to put out the first articles about microphones and computers listening to you from a Google press release?
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.521]  Does it get more real than that?
[00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:14.267]  Or how Samsung TVs were watching you?
[00:14:14.267 --> 00:14:16.108]  Is it... Is it fake?
[00:14:17.679 --> 00:14:20.541]  And the answer is, no, ladies and gentlemen, it's not fake.
[00:14:20.541 --> 00:14:24.383]  Let me show TV viewers an article from 2006.
[00:14:24.383 --> 00:14:28.705]  For some reason, I guess we turned off old servers that had stuff pre-2006 on it, 2004.
[00:14:28.705 --> 00:14:30.085]  That's a big deal.
[00:14:30.085 --> 00:14:32.026]  I want to find our old website.
[00:14:32.026 --> 00:14:34.048]  Does InfoWars and Prison Planet go back to 1997?
[00:14:34.048 --> 00:14:36.609]  InfoWars does.
[00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:38.330]  Another thing, Der Spiegel got wrong.
[00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.330]  They said 1999.
[00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.351]  That's when we transferred the domain.
[00:14:41.598 --> 00:14:43.679]  There it is, the last article we can find.
[00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:50.482]  Ten years ago, government industry, government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans.
[00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:57.505]  Invasive surveillance and advertising obliterates even minority report style technology.
[00:14:57.505 --> 00:15:02.267]  Paul Joseph Watson, Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com, September 6, 2006.
[00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:04.648]  You can probably find the InfoWars version as well.
[00:15:05.595 --> 00:15:09.297]  We can't even find the ones that are older than that.
[00:15:09.297 --> 00:15:21.362]  There are shows I did in 1999 where I bust open a scientific Atlantic cable box on AXS TV and show you the microphone inside of it before they had voice prompt or any of that.
[00:15:21.362 --> 00:15:26.504]  And I was told by a Time Warner executive who was an engineer and who held patents
[00:15:28.951 --> 00:15:33.553]  That he was pissed that they were using some of his systems to listen to people.
[00:15:33.553 --> 00:15:35.073]  And guess what happened when I did that?
[00:15:35.073 --> 00:15:43.056]  I got thrown off the radio the next week, and I got physically attacked, and my car got attacked, and I got phone calls and they said, you are in trouble now.
[00:15:43.056 --> 00:15:44.816]  Shut your mouth or it's over.
[00:15:44.816 --> 00:15:45.197]  And you know what?
[00:15:45.197 --> 00:15:46.077]  I didn't shut my mouth, did I?
[00:15:48.809 --> 00:15:53.192]  I told everybody about this 18 years ago.
[00:15:53.192 --> 00:15:53.893]  18 years ago.
[00:15:53.893 --> 00:15:55.454]  And I'm not bragging.
[00:15:55.454 --> 00:16:07.023]  But the reason we're being shut down everywhere and kicked off Google Ads and kicked off Facebook is because we're real, we're hardcore, we're trailblazing, we're cutting edge, we're real investigative journalists.
[00:16:07.023 --> 00:16:09.244]  We know what we're doing.
[00:16:09.244 --> 00:16:17.530]  You know, other media got told about this in the 90s, but they wouldn't run a story that cable boxes were listening to you.
[00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:18.111]  They wouldn't do it.
[00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:26.713]  So, today I'm going to tell you what else they're doing here in just a moment.
[00:16:26.713 --> 00:16:31.297]  And then when Dr. Group joins us, probably the most important information we've ever covered.
[00:16:31.297 --> 00:16:37.761]  But understand, 18-year-old information, ladies and gentlemen, is now cutting edge on Fox.
[00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:39.683]  CNN won't even report it.
[00:16:41.479 --> 00:17:05.911]  Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of documents from the CIA, how they're spying on Congress, the American people, you name it, and Bloomberg, and Fox News, were all this morning saying, should Trump be impeached for the lie that he's being spied on?
[00:17:05.911 --> 00:17:07.411]  How dare him!
[00:17:07.411 --> 00:17:07.812]  Get back 200.
[00:17:10.554 --> 00:17:12.254]  And 90,000 jobs in just 45 days.
[00:17:12.254 --> 00:17:15.255]  How dare him get the stock market at $3 trillion?
[00:17:15.255 --> 00:17:16.075]  How dare him?
[00:17:16.075 --> 00:17:16.675]  How dare him?
[00:17:16.675 --> 00:17:17.276]  How dare him?
[00:17:17.276 --> 00:17:18.976]  How dare him?
[00:17:18.976 --> 00:17:21.176]  How dare him have Samsung announcer coming back?
[00:17:21.176 --> 00:17:27.838]  And that ExxonMobil's gonna build giant facilities on the Gulf Coast and 45,000 new jobs, average job $100,000 a piece.
[00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:31.939]  How dare him every day reverse the tide of globalism?
[00:17:31.939 --> 00:17:35.659]  How dare the president even try to talk to the Russians?
[00:17:35.659 --> 00:17:36.940]  He's not allowed to!
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:37.200]  CNN said!
[00:17:39.807 --> 00:17:40.467]  He's the president.
[00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:41.868]  He can talk to whoever the hell he wants.
[00:17:41.868 --> 00:17:43.429]  That's what presidents do.
[00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:44.069]  It's sick.
[00:17:44.069 --> 00:17:46.210]  These freaks are sick, and they still think they're in charge.
[00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.692]  Before I go any further, though, here's the big news.
[00:17:49.692 --> 00:17:56.256]  I know four people close to me who've taken Biome Defense, the best probiotic out there.
[00:17:56.256 --> 00:17:57.276]  We did our research.
[00:17:57.276 --> 00:18:04.880]  Four years in development with the top companies and Dr. Group, bringing the biggest wide spectrum, good bacteria flora, some of the most ancient bacteria flora out there.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.381]  Very expensive to get these strains, by the way.
[00:18:07.888 --> 00:18:13.211]  We have 25 billion live and 50 billion live, so the super strength and the regular strength are both powerful.
[00:18:13.211 --> 00:18:14.612]  Take it two or three times a day.
[00:18:14.612 --> 00:18:21.495]  I know people that have had irritable bowels for almost a decade, and it was ruining their life, and they'd taken probiotics before and it didn't help them.
[00:18:21.495 --> 00:18:23.897]  I said, you take this morning, noon, and night and see what happens.
[00:18:23.897 --> 00:18:25.838]  A month later, completely normal.
[00:18:27.947 --> 00:18:32.228]  The food you eat that's processed has pesticides and herbicides in it that kill all the good bacteria.
[00:18:32.228 --> 00:18:35.668]  Then you got dead flora and nothing but yeast and garbage in your stomach.
[00:18:35.668 --> 00:18:38.929]  The good bacteria go in and then displace all that, and you get back to normal.
[00:18:38.929 --> 00:18:42.410]  It's incredible!
[00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.670]  Bill Gates' number one investment area is gut flora.
[00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.170]  He knows what he's doing to people.
[00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.671]  Vermont, Santo, and the rest of it that he's involved with.
[00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:50.991]  They won't tell anybody this stuff.
[00:18:50.991 --> 00:18:52.711]  Biome Defense, support the broadcast, get it.
[00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:55.432]  But now, Otter Group's gonna come in at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:18:55.432 --> 00:18:55.952]  Skip this break.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.562]  MycoZX.
[00:19:01.562 --> 00:19:03.585]  This is a decade in development.
[00:19:03.585 --> 00:19:05.106]  You don't want to take this on empty stomach.
[00:19:05.106 --> 00:19:10.633]  You should talk to your physician before because this is serious business, okay?
[00:19:10.633 --> 00:19:12.555]  This is an anti-yeast, anti-fungus.
[00:19:16.092 --> 00:19:18.754]  Supports normal fungal and yeast balance.
[00:19:18.754 --> 00:19:21.116]  Proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes.
[00:19:21.116 --> 00:19:22.357]  Made with the highest quality ingredients.
[00:19:22.357 --> 00:19:24.819]  It's jam-packed with the capsules.
[00:19:24.819 --> 00:19:25.500]  It is $39.95.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.403]  It should be $100, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:29.403 --> 00:19:30.384]  It's so good.
[00:19:30.384 --> 00:19:32.565]  Nothing else is like this.
[00:19:32.565 --> 00:19:35.608]  120 vegetarian capsules.
[00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:36.329]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:19:37.293 --> 00:19:43.379]  MycoZX is going to be the ultimate game changer for so many people because our environment is infested with mold.
[00:19:43.379 --> 00:19:45.001]  It's infested with yeast.
[00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:45.902]  It is taking over.
[00:19:45.902 --> 00:19:49.305]  I mean, you see the reports, people get brain tumors from mold and yeast.
[00:19:49.305 --> 00:19:50.366]  I mean, it's just out of control.
[00:19:50.366 --> 00:19:53.209]  It's killing the bats in most of the caves in the U.S.
[00:19:53.209 --> 00:19:54.370]  I mean, it is mutated.
[00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.771]  It's out of control.
[00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:58.134]  It's tied into the geoengineering and so much more.
[00:19:58.134 --> 00:20:00.016]  And this is unbelievable.
[00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:05.464]  I mean, you think biome defense and top-of-the-line probiotics change a lot of people's lives.
[00:20:05.464 --> 00:20:09.007]  Read the five-star reviews at infowarslife.com.
[00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:13.430]  MycoZX is unbelievable.
[00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:19.334]  But I will tell you, I wouldn't even call it side effects, but you actually take it, it's dramatic.
[00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:21.696]  It's been dramatic for me, it's been dramatic for others.
[00:20:21.696 --> 00:20:28.241]  So, consult your healthcare provider, do your research, because depending on how infested you are, it is unbelievable.
[00:20:29.718 --> 00:20:34.208]  Unbelievable what Mother Nature does with these concentrated herbs and the enzymes.
[00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:35.651]  It's amazing.
[00:20:36.681 --> 00:20:39.062]  It is, it is amazing.
[00:20:39.062 --> 00:20:43.784]  And so many people that are, you know, really, really obese are basically colonized by yeast and fungus.
[00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:45.365]  That's well known.
[00:20:45.365 --> 00:20:46.565]  This, this is unbelievable.
[00:20:46.565 --> 00:20:48.186]  It's just like bacteria become drug resistant.
[00:20:48.186 --> 00:20:49.727]  Well, it's the, it's the fungus.
[00:20:49.727 --> 00:20:54.949]  It's the yeast because you don't have good bacteria in you for decades because of all the pesticides and herbicides.
[00:20:54.949 --> 00:20:59.631]  The bacteria aren't even in you most of the time, or not even anywhere near the flora they should be, or they're bad bacteria.
[00:20:59.631 --> 00:21:00.412]  And then who moves in?
[00:21:00.412 --> 00:21:02.913]  The yeast and the fungus.
[00:21:02.913 --> 00:21:04.934]  Especially with women.
[00:21:04.934 --> 00:21:05.554]  But let me tell you,
[00:21:07.583 --> 00:21:11.005]  I didn't feel too good when I took this a couple weeks ago.
[00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:12.666]  Same thing we sell, I take before.
[00:21:12.666 --> 00:21:15.728]  But let me tell you, it was dramatic.
[00:21:15.728 --> 00:21:16.248]  Dramatic.
[00:21:16.248 --> 00:21:18.050]  And I felt so good after people said, man, what's up with your skin?
[00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.570]  It's like glowing.
[00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.272]  And it's just like amazing.
[00:21:21.272 --> 00:21:24.073]  So mycozx, infowarestore.com.

[00:22:18.726 --> 00:22:28.828]  We're almost sold out of the Tennessee Arms copper insert, resin lowers that can do 30,000, 60,000 rounds, depending on whose gun they put it into.
[00:22:28.828 --> 00:22:30.209]  And it's totally legal and lawful.
[00:22:30.209 --> 00:22:31.069]  You drill out that 20% yourself.
[00:22:32.569 --> 00:22:35.970]  With the Trump 1776 Reborn, those are about to sell out.
[00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.871]  It's a great collector's item.
[00:22:37.871 --> 00:22:41.692]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:22:41.692 --> 00:22:46.674]  Those are about to sell out.
[00:22:46.674 --> 00:22:50.716]  Also, they're censoring us more and more on all the major internet platforms, as you know.
[00:22:50.716 --> 00:22:53.817]  That's why it's key they could even start censoring Infowars or Prison Planet.
[00:22:53.817 --> 00:22:55.478]  They've got some stuff in the works to do that, by the way.
[00:22:55.478 --> 00:22:57.018]  I haven't gotten to that on air.
[00:22:57.018 --> 00:23:01.320]  That's why you need to sign up for the free newsletter, Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.

[00:23:17.858 --> 00:23:21.060]  But other credible news from other sources that we see being censored.

[00:23:25.344 --> 00:23:29.307]  We want to tell folks about what the enemy doesn't want the people to be aware of.
[00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:31.468]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.

[00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.491]  It's more critical now than ever.

[00:23:38.694 --> 00:23:40.195]  We are in an information war.
[00:23:47.881 --> 00:24:10.954]  Now, let me lay out, before we go to break and Eddie Bravo and my good friends joins us here in studio, of course the Joe Rogan Experience and Planet 10 Jiu Jitsu and UFC commentator, before he comes in here to talk about the world, just his view of things, I want to lay out to all the viewers and all the listeners,
[00:24:12.363 --> 00:24:20.486]  But especially the people that make jokes about this broadcast and take it out of context and put together the comedy pieces out there that I think are hilarious as well.
[00:24:20.486 --> 00:24:35.030]  It's done by Salon and Facebook and it's done by Media Matters and it's done by Esquire and it's done by you name it.
[00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:40.292]  To try to discredit us and hurt us, all it does is send us more viewers, more listeners, particularly young people.
[00:24:41.869 --> 00:24:46.871]  They're so arrogant they think their attack is having an effect on us or they think I'm Machiavelli like them.
[00:24:46.871 --> 00:24:51.313]  They think I tell them it's helping us because it's hurting us and I want them to stop.
[00:24:51.313 --> 00:24:53.554]  No, we don't do tricks like that.
[00:24:53.554 --> 00:25:07.299]  We can track actually that we're getting a lot of the new young people that listen and watch from the viral videos that are on HBO, that are on Bill Maher, that are on Vice TV, that are on
[00:25:09.212 --> 00:25:24.521]  Kober, that are on Kimmel, I mean it's every week now, on those shows alone, they show edited mashups of me, sometimes going back a decade, goofing around or getting angry, and out of context, and then people are coming here because of that.
[00:25:24.521 --> 00:25:35.727]  So, it's, I almost don't want to tell them they might stop, but it's just crazy how we're getting millions and millions of young people to tune in because they're doing that.
[00:25:37.588 --> 00:25:45.034]  Now, we found the old folks that watch those shows, that's mainly their audience, they are getting really freaked out and believing it all.
[00:25:45.034 --> 00:25:50.299]  Michael Colbert has been saying, I don't like gays, or I'm anti-gay, and they'll probably take that and put that out.
[00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:51.260]  No, I'm not.
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.702]  I say I'm not anti-gay, and they say I'm anti-gay.
[00:25:55.302 --> 00:25:59.065]  So there's some real deceptiveness going on as well.
[00:25:59.065 --> 00:26:01.326]  I mean, you know, a little kid went and did what Trump always says.
[00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:03.128]  It means, okay, everything's a-okay.
[00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:04.569]  Putting your index finger with your thumb.
[00:26:04.569 --> 00:26:09.072]  And ever since I was a little kid, they had those in Jell-O ads like, mmm, Jell-O.
[00:26:09.072 --> 00:26:13.075]  So I've always made, you can see me in photos going back decades, the double thumbs up.
[00:26:13.865 --> 00:26:17.546]  In fact, you know, my wife and everybody always says, stop doing that in every photo.
[00:26:17.546 --> 00:26:19.266]  I don't know why I do these Trump-like deals.
[00:26:19.266 --> 00:26:21.046]  I never even watched Trump on TV before.
[00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:22.647]  I've been doing this for 20 years on air.
[00:26:22.647 --> 00:26:24.627]  Double thumbs up and everything's A-OK.
[00:26:24.627 --> 00:26:26.047]  People always say, oh, it's an Illuminati symbol.
[00:26:26.047 --> 00:26:27.707]  No, it means OK.
[00:26:27.707 --> 00:26:28.588]  OK.
[00:26:28.588 --> 00:26:29.528]  The little kid does it.
[00:26:29.528 --> 00:26:31.608]  They're saying it's white supremism.
[00:26:31.608 --> 00:26:33.248]  That's mainstream news.
[00:26:33.248 --> 00:26:39.250]  I guess the three fingers mean W. I don't know what the rest supposedly means.
[00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.230]  Matt, you explain to me.
[00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:41.250]  Can you turn the mic on?
[00:26:43.106 --> 00:26:46.970]  I was in there laughing about it, and you said, no, no, really, you saw a TV piece on it.
[00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:58.904]  They're saying three fingers means a W. So if you're holding up the OK sign, Alex, with your hand right there, and you're holding up your right hand to an observer, sorry, put him on screen real quick.
[00:26:59.324 --> 00:27:16.479]  So, to an observer, your three fingers that are standing up make a W, and then your forefinger or your pointer finger and your thumb, that circle, well, if you were to draw a vertical line down your palm, then that makes a P. It's almost like you're looking for things in the stars like they did with, uh...
[00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:18.880]  You know, constellations and things like that.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:53.826]  I mean, we're truly getting to, you know, Roddenberry's or, you know, Fahrenheit, whatever, the temperature that paper burns.
[00:27:53.826 --> 00:27:56.289]  But they know what they're doing.
[00:27:56.289 --> 00:27:59.633]  Michigan State University bans whiteboards from dorm doors.
[00:27:59.633 --> 00:28:00.594]  What do you make of this?
[00:28:00.594 --> 00:28:04.017]  I mean, clearly the kid's copying Trump doing an A-OK symbol.
[00:28:04.998 --> 00:28:10.280]  And, you know, they've got some of the conspiracy theorists that are real conspiracy theorists, you know, that turn everything into something as well.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.400]  They're kind of like the liberals.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.422]  They're like, I notice they're all pseudo-intellectuals that then just wage war on communication.
[00:28:16.422 --> 00:28:17.962]  What do you think, Matt?
[00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:22.464]  I actually think it's more of like, uh, kind of like a Jedi ward that Trump does with his hand.
[00:28:22.464 --> 00:28:25.905]  Whenever he does that up, he's like, everything will be A-OK.
[00:28:25.905 --> 00:28:27.265]  I'm the president now.
[00:28:27.265 --> 00:28:29.606]  Barack Obama is going to jail with Hillary.
[00:28:30.765 --> 00:28:31.385]  That's what that means.
[00:28:31.385 --> 00:28:36.808]  When I was a kid, and I was getting upset about something or whatever, my dad would say, it's okay!
[00:28:36.808 --> 00:28:39.670]  I mean, that means okay, like, it's okay, it's under control, right?
[00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.191]  I mean, didn't that always mean everything's A-okay?
[00:28:42.191 --> 00:28:43.992]  Oh yeah.
[00:28:43.992 --> 00:28:46.213]  But then these people say, it's Illuminati!
[00:28:46.213 --> 00:28:49.755]  Alex is in the Illuminati!
[00:28:49.755 --> 00:28:54.298]  What matters is what I say and what I do and what I stand for, not what hand signals I make.
[00:28:54.298 --> 00:28:58.360]  You know, it's like, this symbol was originally to ward off the devil in Italy.
[00:28:59.312 --> 00:29:03.113]  Then Rodney James Dio started doing it, so it became a sign of the devil.
[00:29:03.113 --> 00:29:06.814]  So if you do it at UT, it doesn't mean you're worshipping the devil.
[00:29:06.814 --> 00:29:09.235]  But if Bill Clinton does it, it means something different.
[00:29:09.235 --> 00:29:10.555]  You see what I'm saying, Matt?
[00:29:10.555 --> 00:29:11.115]  Yeah, totally.
[00:29:11.115 --> 00:29:15.477]  Alright, I didn't get to the biggest thing ever, but I'm gonna come back and cover it.
[00:29:15.477 --> 00:29:16.457]  We got Eddie Bravo coming in.
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:25.083]  But if you think it's shocking that they're listening to you and watching you, and I don't mean just sometimes, they're mass data collecting everything.
[00:29:25.083 --> 00:29:26.384]  It happens a lot.
[00:29:26.384 --> 00:29:31.246]  If you think that it's big that this all came true, folks, I got stuff a hundred times worse.
[00:29:31.246 --> 00:29:32.207]  It's not my opinion, though.
[00:29:32.207 --> 00:29:33.587]  It didn't come true.
[00:29:33.587 --> 00:29:34.808]  It was already true.
[00:29:36.021 --> 00:29:39.262]  But when is Trump going to apologize to the little boy making the white supremacism symbol?
[00:29:39.262 --> 00:29:48.066]  See, it's like he gave $25 billion to the Black History Group, or to the colleges, and they turn it around that he's racist for doing it, or Conway had her feet on the couch.
[00:29:48.066 --> 00:29:49.607]  They always got to change the subject.
[00:29:49.607 --> 00:29:50.988]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.988 --> 00:29:53.509]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:56.210]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.186 --> 00:30:12.283]  A previously debunked claim alleging then candidate Donald Trump ran a secret server to communicate with Russia during the 2016 presidential race has resurfaced.
[00:30:12.283 --> 00:30:15.828]  The establishment mainstream media is now rehashing this story.
[00:30:15.828 --> 00:30:16.168]  I don't know.
[00:30:37.526 --> 00:30:40.248]  And look who's spreading the fake news.
[00:30:40.248 --> 00:30:48.015]  Hillary Clinton posted on Twitter that it's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia.
[00:30:48.015 --> 00:30:54.720]  And she included a link to the original Slate article that started the bogus rumor to begin with.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.403]  You can check out the real news right now at Infowars.com.
[00:30:59.909 --> 00:31:00.749]  Hey, everyone!
[00:31:00.749 --> 00:31:03.030]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:06.871]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:06.871 --> 00:31:08.951]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:19.214]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:19.214 --> 00:31:25.195]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:25.675 --> 00:31:46.431]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.
[00:31:46.431 --> 00:31:48.413]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[00:31:48.413 --> 00:31:48.793]  Head over to
[00:31:49.013 --> 00:31:50.838]  Infowarsteam.com.
[00:31:50.838 --> 00:31:52.703]  Your body will be very grateful.
[00:31:52.703 --> 00:31:55.751]  On the web at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:57.114]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:31:59.915 --> 00:32:01.756]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:01.756 --> 00:32:08.358]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:08.358 --> 00:32:11.519]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:21.302]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:32:21.302 --> 00:32:22.143]  Caveman.
[00:32:22.143 --> 00:32:27.204]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:27.204 --> 00:32:29.325]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:32.766]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:32.766 --> 00:32:37.907]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:37.907 --> 00:32:46.070]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:54.012]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:54.012 --> 00:32:58.653]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.
[00:33:05.819 --> 00:33:11.863]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:11.863 --> 00:33:14.525]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:14.525 --> 00:33:27.574]  Eddie Bravo is in the studio for the next hour, then Dr. Edward Group, then Roger Stone, and so many others.
[00:33:28.777 --> 00:33:32.620]  We have a George Neumeier, if I'm pronouncing that right, from American Spectator.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:37.704]  A bunch of other guests coming on that Stone's got set up.
[00:33:37.704 --> 00:33:42.207]  Eddie Bravo is the 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu, or JJ.com.
[00:33:42.207 --> 00:33:44.288]  And he's on Instagram at EddieBravo10.
[00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:49.772]  He's one of the top Jiu-Jitsu experts in the world, and I've been able to beat guys that are top people and a lot bigger than him.
[00:33:49.772 --> 00:33:52.194]  Just had back surgery, though, so I'm not as scared of him as I normally am.
[00:33:52.194 --> 00:33:56.097]  But I've just known this guy for a good decade or so, hanging out with Joe at UFC events.
[00:33:56.097 --> 00:33:56.637]  So funny.
[00:33:57.597 --> 00:33:57.737]  So
[00:34:12.517 --> 00:34:15.359]  Record downloads, record views, and they tried to censor it.
[00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:16.880]  They tried to block it.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.721]  Joe confirmed that.
[00:34:17.721 --> 00:34:21.123]  In fact, some things like Google Play never even listed it.
[00:34:21.123 --> 00:34:22.684]  They wouldn't put it on iTunes for a day and a half.
[00:34:22.684 --> 00:34:23.885]  That never happened to him.
[00:34:23.885 --> 00:34:27.868]  And they won't put it as the top iTunes ever podcast, even though it is.
[00:34:27.868 --> 00:34:30.249]  Joe has the internal control board.
[00:34:30.249 --> 00:34:31.670]  He can see it's the biggest podcast ever.
[00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.011]  He's already in the top three.
[00:34:33.011 --> 00:34:38.375]  He has the biggest podcast he ever did, times double or more, and they won't show it on iTunes as number one.
[00:34:38.375 --> 00:34:39.556]  What do you think of that, Eddie?
[00:34:40.676 --> 00:34:41.837]  It's pretty crazy.
[00:34:41.837 --> 00:34:44.219]  And first of all, I want to apologize.
[00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:51.065]  I want to apologize for being an idiot and an annoying guest.
[00:34:51.065 --> 00:34:53.266]  I should have just kept my mouth shut.
[00:34:53.266 --> 00:34:54.347]  I want to apologize.
[00:34:54.347 --> 00:34:55.488]  I'm the one who usually interrupts people.
[00:34:55.488 --> 00:34:56.569]  Talking about with Joe?
[00:34:56.569 --> 00:34:57.390]  Yes, yes.
[00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.111]  I'm glad you were there.
[00:34:59.111 --> 00:35:01.293]  People complained about that, and rightfully so.
[00:35:01.293 --> 00:35:03.434]  I was very annoying.
[00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:06.997]  But the reason I got... It's kind of funny.
[00:35:06.997 --> 00:35:07.458]  Tell me about...
[00:35:08.188 --> 00:35:11.531]  I got the replicas of the dinosaurs.
[00:35:11.531 --> 00:35:12.351]  Yeah.
[00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:19.077]  No, but the main thing was is I've taken a lot of heat over the years, a lot of heat for chemtrails, a lot of heat for that.
[00:35:19.077 --> 00:35:33.128]  And to finally get you in front of Joe Rogan's audience, who most of the people, most of the people in most of Joe Rogan's audience, they, you know, they think you're crazy and they think what with the mainstream media, how they portray.
[00:35:33.128 --> 00:35:35.911]  But they actually 99 percent actually said, now I like Alex Jones.
[00:35:36.331 --> 00:35:38.072]  Because of the podcast, for sure.
[00:35:38.072 --> 00:35:39.272]  They were blown away.
[00:35:39.272 --> 00:35:42.653]  I didn't get annoying until about an hour into the show.
[00:35:42.653 --> 00:35:43.293]  I just sat there.
[00:35:43.293 --> 00:35:47.375]  By the way, Marcos Morales and so many others watch the podcast.
[00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:48.615]  They also watch your podcast.
[00:35:48.615 --> 00:35:49.495]  They all love you.
[00:35:49.495 --> 00:35:51.336]  So let's be clear.
[00:35:51.336 --> 00:35:54.637]  Your love of the Joe Rogan podcast was just that night some folks got pissed at you.
[00:35:55.097 --> 00:36:00.379]  Yeah, well, it was because I wanted to clear the whole chemtrail thing.
[00:36:00.379 --> 00:36:01.839]  Well, let's do that.
[00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:03.960]  No one calls it chemtrails in the real world.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.961]  I call it chemtrails.
[00:36:04.961 --> 00:36:06.841]  There is manipulation of the weather.
[00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:08.122]  It's mainstream news.
[00:36:08.122 --> 00:36:09.922]  And the media always picks it up and says, I'm crazy.
[00:36:09.922 --> 00:36:12.603]  It's on the Weather Channel that there are secret programs.
[00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:14.644]  It's just so secret we don't know the details.
[00:36:14.644 --> 00:36:20.206]  Then other people think every condensation trail is an actual chemtrail when they're crystal.
[00:36:20.706 --> 00:36:20.866]  I think?
[00:36:36.161 --> 00:36:39.122]  I'm going to ask him to look into geospatial manipulation.
[00:36:39.122 --> 00:36:41.783]  Well, they're calling it a stratospheric aerosol injection.
[00:36:41.783 --> 00:36:42.543]  Yes.
[00:36:42.543 --> 00:36:51.605]  John O'Brien wasn't at the CFR talking about it, how it's captured as interest and it costs $10 billion a year.
[00:36:51.605 --> 00:36:52.586]  Geoengineering.
[00:36:52.586 --> 00:36:56.207]  Tell us about the real atmosphere manipulation that's going on.
[00:36:57.367 --> 00:37:12.352]  Well, based on what John O'Brien said at the CFR, you can watch this on YouTube, just like the chemtrail people have been saying for years that eventually they're going to have to admit it and they're going to say that... And by the way, search engine, the CFR calls for geoengineering.
[00:37:12.352 --> 00:37:13.572]  It'll be on their own website.
[00:37:13.812 --> 00:37:15.393]  Yeah, you even said this for years.
[00:37:15.393 --> 00:37:25.656]  Eventually, they're going to come out and say that, yes, they are spraying the atmosphere with metallic particles, but it's to save us, to save for global warming, to save the planet.
[00:37:25.656 --> 00:37:27.837]  And that's exactly what John O'Brien did.
[00:37:27.837 --> 00:37:38.820]  He got in front of the CFR and he said, yeah, we're going to start spraying the atmosphere with stratospheric aerosol injections, and it's going to cost $10 billion a year.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.302]  And there's going to be some countries that are not going to be into it because... And guess who's behind it?
[00:37:43.963 --> 00:37:45.664]  Word for word you're saying what they put out.
[00:37:45.664 --> 00:37:47.026]  Bill Gates called for this.
[00:37:47.026 --> 00:37:50.389]  Bill Gates is getting government money to then run the program.
[00:37:50.389 --> 00:37:52.451]  They're running programs to control hurricanes.
[00:37:52.451 --> 00:37:55.874]  It's all in Nature and Science magazine.
[00:37:55.874 --> 00:38:01.680]  But then they go on the news and say, Alex says Obama sent tornadoes to Oklahoma.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.240]  No I didn't!
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.783]  So again, they misrepresent what's really going on.
[00:38:05.632 --> 00:38:14.078]  Now, explain the difference between legit contrails and the stuff that is the stratospheric aerosol injections.
[00:38:14.078 --> 00:38:14.719]  What's the difference?
[00:38:14.719 --> 00:38:17.261]  Because people say, oh, take a basic science class.
[00:38:17.261 --> 00:38:18.162]  There it is, one and guardian.
[00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:21.684]  Bill Gates backs climate scientists lobbying for large-scale geoengineering.
[00:38:21.684 --> 00:38:24.827]  So they're already doing it, $5 billion a year Department of Energy that they admit.
[00:38:25.347 --> 00:38:26.068]  Yeah.
[00:38:26.068 --> 00:38:30.170]  There was a Nobel Prize, the two guys won it in 1992 with the plan.
[00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.651]  By 94 it was launched.
[00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:31.851]  Yeah.
[00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:33.112]  And now it's over most of the world.
[00:38:33.112 --> 00:38:34.593]  It's a giant program.
[00:38:34.593 --> 00:38:38.395]  A lot of people, and I'm not kidding, since Trump got in noticed there's less of the chemtrails.
[00:38:38.395 --> 00:38:41.997]  And that's why Trump said we have advanced technology, we can pretty much cure stuff now.
[00:38:41.997 --> 00:38:43.538]  I want to roll this out to you.
[00:38:43.538 --> 00:38:49.182]  That's why the elites are really mad because the word is, even though I haven't brought this up to Trump, I need to, is that Trump's killing all these programs.
[00:38:50.846 --> 00:38:51.867]  That's why they're so pissed.
[00:38:51.867 --> 00:38:53.688]  That's why all the agencies are just ignoring it.
[00:38:53.688 --> 00:39:04.874]  Yeah, so again, explain to the people out there who are still non-believers, what is the difference between legit contrails and the ones that last all day and completely cover the sky?
[00:39:04.874 --> 00:39:07.636]  Okay, it turns out people think of jet fuel as really volatile.
[00:39:07.636 --> 00:39:07.996]  It's not.
[00:39:07.996 --> 00:39:12.879]  Gasoline is like three times more volatile, more explosive, burns hotter, you name it.
[00:39:12.879 --> 00:39:14.900]  Jet fuel actually is like kerosene.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:21.563]  And so kerosene, I don't recommend this, you can put it on your hand, light it, you know, it doesn't burn you for a while.
[00:39:21.563 --> 00:39:24.544]  That's what they kind of use like in a lot of the Hollywood sets and things.
[00:39:24.544 --> 00:39:26.285]  So you can add a lot of things to kerosene.
[00:39:26.285 --> 00:39:29.767]  They add barium salts, aluminum dioxide, and also some radioactive isotopes.
[00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:33.289]  There's only three big major makers of jet fuel in the United States.
[00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:37.671]  There's some sub ones as well, and they just, under a national security directive that's secret, but
[00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:41.434]  The patents are there, the directive is known, but the details are classified.
[00:39:41.434 --> 00:40:03.911]  They add this to the mix in a government program, they're paid to do it, and then they use the jet engines, the patents, there's like over 20 patents on this, you can Google it, and you get the patent office, to use jet engines to then aerosolize for cloud seeding, and they claim that they're shielding the earth from the sun because we've lost our atmosphere, but then you actually look at what the scientists are doing, it's actually
[00:40:04.791 --> 00:40:07.894]  You know, hurting the planet, actually keeping heat in, the opposite.
[00:40:07.894 --> 00:40:10.336]  So it's like they're trying to create global warming, actually.
[00:40:10.336 --> 00:40:16.282]  Because, again, the ultraviolet radiation goes through the clouds, the other good sun gets blocked and bounces back out.
[00:40:16.282 --> 00:40:22.988]  Those wavelengths get blocked, but the ultraviolet, it's like your dad tells you, you know, on a cloudy day you can still get burned, because the ultraviolet comes through.
[00:40:22.988 --> 00:40:25.110]  That comes through, doesn't bounce back out.
[00:40:25.771 --> 00:40:27.173]  Okay, it just heats the earth up.
[00:40:27.173 --> 00:40:30.177]  So they're trying to heat the earth up in a big, giant, secret experiment.
[00:40:30.177 --> 00:40:33.943]  And they admit they're doing it, but, you know, it's just they won't give us the details.
[00:40:33.943 --> 00:40:34.684]  And then we talk about it.
[00:40:34.684 --> 00:40:37.768]  It's like, oh, Alex, nobody on your iPhone's watching you.
[00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:39.250]  And Google doesn't listen over the phone.
[00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.774]  I'm like, I have all their press releases 10 years ago right here.
[00:40:42.853 --> 00:40:48.415]  I mean, of course now they all admit it, yesterday, with the, but I had you here to interview you, Eddie.
[00:40:48.415 --> 00:40:51.956]  See, Eddie got in trouble talking over me, so now I have him as a guest and he won't talk.
[00:40:51.956 --> 00:40:53.037]  Eddie can talk more than anybody you know.
[00:40:53.037 --> 00:40:56.158]  I went to dinner with him a few weeks ago, he talked for two hours straight, it was awesome.
[00:40:56.158 --> 00:41:03.780]  Well, on the Joe Rogan podcast, you wanted to talk more about Trump, I wanted to talk about Kemp Trail, so I kind of, you know, and then plus you brought out the whiskey.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:08.602]  You know, I told Joe, no more drinking on the podcast, you know how I get, I get crazy, the Indian keeps out.
[00:41:08.962 --> 00:41:20.911]  And then you brought out the bottle of whiskey, we started taking shots, and I wanted to talk chemtrails, and you wanted to talk Trump, and I got kinda... You did a great job.
[00:41:20.911 --> 00:41:21.892]  Let's talk about Tim O'Connor.
[00:41:21.892 --> 00:41:22.572]  Can I apologize for that?
[00:41:22.572 --> 00:41:23.373]  Let's talk about Tim O'Connor.
[00:41:23.373 --> 00:41:23.853]  Stop it.
[00:41:23.853 --> 00:41:24.594]  Stop apologizing.
[00:41:24.594 --> 00:41:25.575]  I'm the one who needs to apologize.
[00:41:25.575 --> 00:41:26.936]  I'm the interrupter.
[00:41:26.936 --> 00:41:27.356]  Okay.
[00:41:27.356 --> 00:41:29.057]  Tell me to shut up.
[00:41:29.057 --> 00:41:30.298]  No, but seriously.
[00:41:30.298 --> 00:41:33.260]  Let's just tell the... I've seen you with the hottest chicks I've ever seen anybody with.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:33.981]  How do you get all the hot chicks?
[00:41:34.636 --> 00:41:35.937]  Yeah, I'm a married man.
[00:41:35.937 --> 00:41:37.097]  That was a long time ago.
[00:41:37.097 --> 00:41:39.199]  Yeah, that was before I was... I'm sorry.
[00:41:39.199 --> 00:41:39.699]  Yes.
[00:41:39.699 --> 00:41:41.620]  Tell me about the lucky lady.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.402]  I love my wife, I love my son, I love my family, and... When did you get married?
[00:41:45.402 --> 00:41:47.563]  I got married four years ago.
[00:41:47.563 --> 00:41:47.883]  Oh, wow.
[00:41:47.883 --> 00:41:48.544]  Yeah.
[00:41:48.544 --> 00:41:51.645]  I remember ten years ago and stuff in Vegas.
[00:41:51.645 --> 00:41:55.508]  Hey, that was a long time ago, Alex.
[00:41:55.508 --> 00:41:56.088]  I was good, though.
[00:41:57.639 --> 00:41:58.800]  Man, Joe.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.384]  Joe can just go and go.
[00:42:01.384 --> 00:42:03.026]  Joe can talk forever, yes.
[00:42:03.026 --> 00:42:05.068]  That's why he has a very successful podcast.
[00:42:05.068 --> 00:42:06.670]  Yeah, he's a piece of work.
[00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.152]  Joe's awesome, isn't he?
[00:42:08.152 --> 00:42:10.275]  He's an incredible man, yes.
[00:42:10.275 --> 00:42:12.678]  Of course, you've known Joe longer than me, but I remember Joe.
[00:42:12.678 --> 00:42:14.861]  Did you know Joe, like, in, like, 1998, 99?
[00:42:14.861 --> 00:42:15.542]  That's when I met him.
[00:42:15.942 --> 00:42:19.306]  So we probably... Well, I mean, he wasn't as big as he is now, but it wasn't a small guy syndrome.
[00:42:19.306 --> 00:42:21.349]  Like, a big guy mess with him or got in his face?
[00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:23.872]  He would, like, routinely, like, choke guys out.
[00:42:23.872 --> 00:42:25.534]  Like, I've seen him do it repeatedly.
[00:42:25.534 --> 00:42:27.276]  Like, big guys, and they would, like, mess with him.
[00:42:27.276 --> 00:42:29.158]  I mean, but over the years, he mellowed out.
[00:42:29.158 --> 00:42:30.860]  When did that happen?
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.103]  Uh... Ooh, when he started smoking weed, probably.
[00:42:33.103 --> 00:42:35.165]  I guess he didn't really get into weed until then, yeah.
[00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.170]  2001?
[00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.230]  2000?
[00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:39.091]  That's a funny story.
[00:42:39.091 --> 00:42:43.453]  He used to like me totally and then... Yeah, it took me like six months to talk him into it.
[00:42:43.453 --> 00:42:47.674]  But, uh, because I knew if I knew if I if I could get... But you knew the old Joe, right?
[00:42:47.674 --> 00:42:48.755]  You didn't want to mess with him.
[00:42:48.755 --> 00:42:49.315]  Yeah.
[00:42:49.315 --> 00:42:49.695]  Yeah.
[00:42:49.695 --> 00:42:52.836]  Well, I was the crazy weed activist at Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:57.338]  I'm a... I was a purple belt trying to get everyone, uh, um, to understand.
[00:42:57.338 --> 00:42:57.838]  Let's just say it.
[00:42:57.838 --> 00:43:00.739]  You, you've defeated the, you know, like the Gracie's, all the top people.
[00:43:02.017 --> 00:43:15.484]  I defeated Hoyler Gracie in 2003, and that's the only Gracie I've ever... But a lot of people say, I'm not, I don't follow, I mean I follow UFC some, I like it, but I'm not like, I don't know any of that, I mean I just know that everybody says you're the best.
[00:43:16.252 --> 00:43:17.473]  I am not the best.
[00:43:17.473 --> 00:43:19.734]  Well, no, just long-term, like with the technique and stuff.
[00:43:19.734 --> 00:43:21.354]  Jean-Jacques Machado is the best.
[00:43:21.354 --> 00:43:23.015]  That's my master, so.
[00:43:23.015 --> 00:43:24.416]  I'm not the best.
[00:43:24.416 --> 00:43:25.836]  I'm not even close to the best.
[00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:27.777]  But you did just get a back surgery, too, didn't you?
[00:43:27.777 --> 00:43:28.277]  Yes.
[00:43:28.277 --> 00:43:28.678]  Yes.
[00:43:28.678 --> 00:43:32.499]  Got a disc replacement in my back, and I'm still recovering.
[00:43:32.499 --> 00:43:34.580]  And I'm doing yoga now, trying to get back to 100%.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:38.202]  Hopefully, I'll get there.
[00:43:38.202 --> 00:43:39.843]  Was it the jujitsu that finally got your back?
[00:43:40.734 --> 00:43:41.835]  The doctor said no.
[00:43:41.835 --> 00:43:59.743]  I went to the best, apparently I got the best doctor in the country, I didn't even know, I just, someone recommended him to me and he said that unless you have direct blunt force trauma into your back that everyone's back is, well, some people's discs go out, some people don't.
[00:43:59.743 --> 00:44:00.703]  Sure.
[00:44:00.703 --> 00:44:06.045]  And he says it has nothing to do with what, you know, what sport you're doing or whatever.
[00:44:06.045 --> 00:44:08.947]  But, so there's 20 year old, he was showing me,
[00:44:09.987 --> 00:44:15.513]  MRIs of different people and said look this is a 23 year old girl never did anything in her life and her back's screwed.
[00:44:15.513 --> 00:44:16.815]  She needs disc replacement surgery.
[00:44:16.815 --> 00:44:18.256]  Oh I got piledrived once.
[00:44:18.256 --> 00:44:21.840]  So I got two discs that are just waiting to go out here and two down here.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.422]  I'm not looking forward to that.
[00:44:23.422 --> 00:44:24.443]  All being puffed out.
[00:44:24.443 --> 00:44:26.044]  You gonna get surgery?
[00:44:26.044 --> 00:44:29.148]  I don't know it's just when they hurt it's like it's excruciating to even get up.
[00:44:30.755 --> 00:44:32.177]  I'm sure you went through that too.
[00:44:32.177 --> 00:44:39.344]  Yeah, my back was, you know, I tried everything for it and I finally got an MRI and they said you don't have a disc in your L1 S5.
[00:44:42.015 --> 00:44:44.336]  Or L5S1, I get those confused.
[00:44:44.336 --> 00:44:48.598]  But I was bone to bone for years and years and that's where all the pain came from.
[00:44:48.598 --> 00:44:52.380]  So I finally went in there, got surgery and hopefully it fixes it.
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.021]  But you're such a cool cat and funny and nice.
[00:44:56.021 --> 00:44:58.942]  A lot of guys that are tough guys, I mean, a lot of them are cool.
[00:44:58.942 --> 00:45:00.403]  I guess you and Joe have helped kind of change things.
[00:45:00.403 --> 00:45:07.005]  But I remember just some of the people I've been around from, you know, UFC, they really are kind of aggressive jerks.
[00:45:07.005 --> 00:45:08.426]  But it seems like that's getting phased out.
[00:45:09.699 --> 00:45:11.199]  There's still some of that?
[00:45:11.199 --> 00:45:15.521]  You know, there's douchebags in every genre and every community.
[00:45:15.521 --> 00:45:20.262]  You know, Jiu Jitsu has them too.
[00:45:20.262 --> 00:45:23.363]  There's douchebags in the conspiracy theory movement.
[00:45:23.363 --> 00:45:24.444]  Absolutely.
[00:45:24.444 --> 00:45:26.124]  I know Dana White's a super nice guy.
[00:45:26.124 --> 00:45:29.665]  For all the power he's got, he's really down to earth.
[00:45:29.665 --> 00:45:31.106]  Yeah, very nice guy.
[00:45:31.106 --> 00:45:34.687]  Unless you get on his bad side, then he comes at you with the wrath.
[00:45:36.507 --> 00:45:37.588]  No, but I love Dana.
[00:45:37.588 --> 00:45:44.329]  What he's done for the sport and MMA, I mean, you know, without him, the UFC wouldn't be worth that right now.
[00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.809]  Absolutely.
[00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:48.190]  I remember Joe back when he was going, yeah, this UFC is going to start to be bigger than the NFL.
[00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:49.070]  Man, it's so awesome.
[00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.671]  And Dana White and I was just like, and then all of a sudden it just explodes.
[00:45:51.671 --> 00:45:52.171]  Yeah.
[00:45:52.171 --> 00:45:54.572]  Joe's been there since the very start, pretty much.
[00:45:54.572 --> 00:45:55.092]  Yep.
[00:45:55.092 --> 00:45:59.453]  He was doing backstage interviews in 97, back in that.
[00:45:59.793 --> 00:46:04.196]  You say Joe, I mean I've seen the workouts, he works out really hard, you say Joe's really good at Jiu Jitsu.
[00:46:04.196 --> 00:46:05.677]  Yeah, he's one of my black belts.
[00:46:05.677 --> 00:46:10.159]  Yeah, he hasn't trained in a couple years because he had a back injury himself.
[00:46:10.159 --> 00:46:16.423]  Didn't get surgery, but his back is kind of tweaked and he might not be able to get back to Jiu Jitsu.
[00:46:16.423 --> 00:46:17.303]  Yeah.
[00:46:17.303 --> 00:46:20.705]  He's talked about it though, he's talked about coming back, but we'll see.
[00:46:20.705 --> 00:46:22.907]  But he was a champion in Taekwondo too.
[00:46:22.907 --> 00:46:24.087]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:46:26.437 --> 00:46:29.143]  He's one of the hardest kickers pound for pound that I've ever seen.
[00:46:29.143 --> 00:46:34.553]  You know, and I've known... Did you ever see that video where he was kicking till the blood was pouring out of his shins?
[00:46:34.553 --> 00:46:34.894]  I was like...
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.221]  It was crazy.
[00:46:36.221 --> 00:46:37.682]  He was kicking to the blood.
[00:46:37.682 --> 00:46:45.729]  I saw it once, I tried to find it again, but yeah, he was like kicking with some big UFC guy, so he could go the longest, like kicking a wall, kicking a pillar.
[00:46:45.729 --> 00:46:50.053]  And he did it until it was just like, blood, every time his heart beat, blood was just running out of his hands.
[00:46:50.053 --> 00:46:51.574]  I'm not sure I've seen that.
[00:46:51.574 --> 00:46:53.616]  I'm telling you, call Joe, absolutely.
[00:46:53.616 --> 00:47:00.622]  Well, there's a video of him showing GSP, one of the greatest fighters of all time, showing him how to throw a turning sidekick.
[00:47:01.543 --> 00:47:02.864]  And it's pretty crazy.
[00:47:02.864 --> 00:47:15.050]  I mean, you got Joe Rogan, you know, the Fear Factor guy, showing GSP, arguably the best pound-for-pound fighter of all time, and he's showing him how to throw a turning side kick.
[00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:15.931]  Let's Google that.
[00:47:15.931 --> 00:47:17.151]  Let's Google that.
[00:47:17.151 --> 00:47:17.651]  I've seen that video.
[00:47:17.651 --> 00:47:17.992]  It's amazing.
[00:47:17.992 --> 00:47:18.732]  What's the name?
[00:47:18.732 --> 00:47:20.673]  You can just, GSP, Joe Rogan.
[00:47:20.673 --> 00:47:22.734]  Joe Rogan shows how to do a what kind of kick?
[00:47:22.734 --> 00:47:24.995]  A turning side kick.
[00:47:24.995 --> 00:47:26.136]  It's pretty insane.
[00:47:26.676 --> 00:47:27.057]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:47:27.057 --> 00:47:28.258]  Let's go ahead and turn up the audio.
[00:47:28.258 --> 00:47:28.778]  This is Joe Rogan.
[00:47:28.778 --> 00:47:29.880]  No, no, no, this is not the one.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:35.045]  This is him showing how to throw a turning sidekick, but you gotta find the one that says GSP as well.
[00:47:35.045 --> 00:47:38.790]  This is... Yeah, that was the wrong... Doesn't Joe have the classic Bulldog features?
[00:47:40.523 --> 00:47:42.724]  Hey, let's get into serious stuff though.
[00:47:42.724 --> 00:47:48.726]  What do you make of them coming out and saying, okay, we're listening to everybody, we're watching Congress, your TV's watching you, everything's true.
[00:47:48.726 --> 00:47:52.747]  I mean, we already knew because the industry had to admit it or they could get sued.
[00:47:52.747 --> 00:47:53.508]  But that's what's crazy.
[00:47:53.508 --> 00:47:55.648]  This was in, I'd love to say, oh, I knew it.
[00:47:55.648 --> 00:47:56.449]  I had sources.
[00:47:56.449 --> 00:47:59.350]  It was in the press releases in 2004.
[00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.870]  Here's 2006.
[00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:03.091]  Government.
[00:48:03.091 --> 00:48:06.232]  Industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans.
[00:48:06.232 --> 00:48:07.572]  So the big news I want to tell people is this.
[00:48:07.572 --> 00:48:08.793]  We're going to skip this break so we have more time.
[00:48:10.225 --> 00:48:14.406]  If you think this is big and shocking, folks, this is the thing they attack me on and say I'm crazy.
[00:48:14.406 --> 00:48:15.506]  You know, your TV's watching you.
[00:48:15.506 --> 00:48:17.307]  That's the classic deal.
[00:48:17.307 --> 00:48:19.847]  They're now freaking out all the news going, I guess Alex Jones is right.
[00:48:19.847 --> 00:48:20.908]  What the hell?
[00:48:20.908 --> 00:48:23.048]  Folks, that's not what's important.
[00:48:23.048 --> 00:48:26.209]  They're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:48:26.209 --> 00:48:27.389]  Okay, what's the proof?
[00:48:27.389 --> 00:48:30.130]  Thousands of medical reports around the world where they test them.
[00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:33.291]  They're adding cancer viruses that aren't even contaminants.
[00:48:33.291 --> 00:48:34.871]  It's not even in the chain of manufacture.
[00:48:36.482 --> 00:48:40.625]  It's coming from egg whites, and then it's got some monkey virus that was never part of the production.
[00:48:40.625 --> 00:48:44.347]  They're doing it on purpose, they've been caught, and then it just goes from there, Eddie.
[00:48:44.347 --> 00:48:46.669]  There's a whole program to kill us.
[00:48:46.669 --> 00:48:47.069]  Yeah.
[00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:52.072]  They're putting fluoride in the water, which, in fact, it's on my bookshelf, a guy's eco-sciences back there.
[00:48:52.072 --> 00:48:59.037]  He wrote it in 1974, the last White House science czar, but in 74, John P. Holdren wrote it.
[00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:11.774]  The book, 1,100 pages long, as a textbook, and it says we put fluoride in the water to lower their fertility and to lower their electrochemical activity in the brain and as adjuvants to accelerate the other drugs we add to the water.
[00:49:11.774 --> 00:49:13.876]  Anybody can Google it and see it online.
[00:49:13.876 --> 00:49:14.716]  You can read the pages.
[00:49:14.716 --> 00:49:18.220]  It's at the different library websites, scans of it.
[00:49:19.454 --> 00:49:23.539]  See, they're lowering our fertility and killing us, folks.
[00:49:23.539 --> 00:49:26.443]  It's just like I told you the microphones and cameras are watching you.
[00:49:26.443 --> 00:49:28.865]  I didn't just pull that out of my rear end.
[00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:31.769]  They write books how they're poisoning you and your family.
[00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:34.572]  That's who Obama chose to run the damn country.
[00:49:34.572 --> 00:49:36.395]  That's who runs the whole chemtrail operation.
[00:49:37.028 --> 00:49:37.849]  Yeah.
[00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:38.009]  Yeah.
[00:49:38.009 --> 00:49:48.643]  And with the vaccines, the craziest thing about the vaccines, you know, most of the people are believe, you know, they're safe and effective because that's what the CDC pushes.
[00:49:48.643 --> 00:49:54.790]  But, you know, when you think when you really, really look into vaccines, all you all you need to know is on day one.
[00:49:56.232 --> 00:49:59.955]  When your baby is born, they give it a Hep B vaccine.
[00:49:59.955 --> 00:50:01.195]  That's sexually transmitted.
[00:50:01.195 --> 00:50:02.116]  Why would you do that?
[00:50:02.116 --> 00:50:04.438]  Why are they giving... That's the Tower 7 vaccine.
[00:50:04.438 --> 00:50:06.699]  You might as well stomp on their liver on the floor.
[00:50:06.699 --> 00:50:07.600]  Yeah.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.102]  The day they're born, and you know why they give them... It'd be better for you to... Go ahead.
[00:50:11.102 --> 00:50:20.448]  You know, the reason they give them... When you ask them, you ask the doctor, why on day one are you giving a newborn a Hep B vaccine?
[00:50:20.448 --> 00:50:21.689]  Makes no sense.
[00:50:21.689 --> 00:50:24.011]  Say, well, when they're older, they're going to forget.
[00:50:24.011 --> 00:50:25.892]  They're not going to do it when they're older.
[00:50:26.792 --> 00:50:34.597]  So day one it's standard unless you say anything they're gonna they're gonna inject your baby on day one with a hep B vaccine.
[00:50:34.597 --> 00:50:37.839]  And then they act like you're crazy and then the nurses after you say no they go none of us do it either.
[00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:38.539]  Yeah.
[00:50:38.539 --> 00:50:44.603]  We've had nurses on who've given their names but also nurses that have you know blurt out their faces or in the in the NICU
[00:50:45.419 --> 00:50:48.561]  Listen, when you've got a three pound baby, until five years ago they never gave it.
[00:51:08.803 --> 00:51:11.625]  They give the shots, the babies die!
[00:51:11.625 --> 00:51:13.766]  Sometimes they can't keep them alive, they die!
[00:51:13.766 --> 00:51:14.127]  Yeah.
[00:51:14.127 --> 00:51:16.909]  I mean, they give them a shot, an hour later, they're gone, baby!
[00:51:16.909 --> 00:51:21.472]  And, I mean, and again, that exercise of, in fact, we have the article, let's put it back on screen for TV viewers, I'll give it to them, go ahead.
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:25.402]  And again, do I believe you can get learned immunity from a vaccine?
[00:51:25.402 --> 00:51:27.104]  Of course I believe in that technology!
[00:51:27.104 --> 00:51:35.731]  If there's some horrible disease running around killing people and I can get it or my kids can, we can attenuate the virus or whatever it is, my body learns how to defeat it, of course I believe in science!
[00:51:35.731 --> 00:51:46.560]  The point is, is that a government that's been caught in all these secret experiments and giving black people syphilis and everything else you know and radiating foster kids to death, why the hell would you take something when it's got vaccine protection?
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.302]  Yeah, when we were kids, there was probably three or four.
[00:51:50.302 --> 00:51:51.302]  Now it's over 50.
[00:51:51.302 --> 00:51:52.803]  Yeah, and why is that?
[00:51:52.803 --> 00:52:02.448]  Does it have anything to do with the fact that Ronald Reagan signed a bill in 1986 that gave immunity to the vaccine manufacturers, which is basically Big Pharma?
[00:52:02.448 --> 00:52:02.868]  Exactly.
[00:52:02.868 --> 00:52:06.630]  Reagan didn't know what he was doing, but that's one evil thing Reagan did, and Trump's trying to repeal it.
[00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:07.710]  Yeah, so since 1986,
[00:52:10.157 --> 00:52:13.618]  The big pharma can get sued for vaccine injuries.
[00:52:13.618 --> 00:52:16.019]  That's when they started rolling them out and green lighting them.
[00:52:16.019 --> 00:52:20.741]  That's why now we have how many like 45 shots babies got to take?
[00:52:20.741 --> 00:52:21.622]  And you can Google this.
[00:52:21.622 --> 00:52:22.342]  The U.S.
[00:52:22.342 --> 00:52:24.623]  government admits life expectancies down in the U.S.
[00:52:24.623 --> 00:52:29.165]  infant mortality is up and IQ has dropped more than 20 points since 1950.
[00:52:29.165 --> 00:52:32.046]  And according to according to mainstream... 20 points brother!
[00:52:33.006 --> 00:52:41.009]  According to mainstream statistics, I could be wrong, I'm no scientist, but 50% of American kids are on some kind of medication, right?
[00:52:41.009 --> 00:52:41.809]  Yeah, it's 50%.
[00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:43.589]  Adults, 20.
[00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:48.731]  50% of kids on some kind of medication, and we vaccinate the most.
[00:52:48.731 --> 00:52:52.492]  And notice, it says our population is dropping on NPR, brought to you by a big pharma ad.
[00:52:53.629 --> 00:52:55.110]  They got Big Pharma as the advertiser.
[00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:59.071]  When you go look at the program shots, it's underwritten by the big... GlaxoSmithKline.
[00:52:59.071 --> 00:53:00.612]  Folks, it's social engineering.
[00:53:00.612 --> 00:53:02.832]  You wonder why people are like zombies?
[00:53:02.832 --> 00:53:07.134]  You wonder why they're so... In fact, let's play a clip from Paul Watson's report on this lady last week.
[00:53:07.134 --> 00:53:09.755]  You go out to these anti-Trump events, they're like zombies.
[00:53:09.755 --> 00:53:14.157]  Whether you love Trump or hate him, they attack you, they yell, they scream, they act like zombies.
[00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:14.917]  Let's play a clip.
[00:53:14.917 --> 00:53:15.217]  Here it is.
[00:53:19.107 --> 00:53:20.188]  That was a good clip.
[00:53:20.188 --> 00:53:21.689]  I like that clip.
[00:53:21.689 --> 00:53:22.950]  And there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.611]  And now for something completely different.
[00:53:25.611 --> 00:53:28.894]  Are we going to have that clip from Paul Watson's zombie deal?
[00:53:28.894 --> 00:53:30.094]  All right, we'll play it sometime.
[00:53:30.094 --> 00:53:31.195]  You know, these live computers.
[00:53:31.195 --> 00:53:32.076]  Ready for the clip?
[00:53:32.076 --> 00:53:33.897]  Third's the charm.
[00:53:33.897 --> 00:53:35.638]  He is your president!
[00:53:35.638 --> 00:53:36.999]  Now I know what you're thinking.
[00:53:36.999 --> 00:53:38.600]  This is just one individual.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:44.564]  This is an inaccurate portrayal of the reasoned, credible, legitimate anti-Trump protest movement.
[00:53:44.564 --> 00:53:47.146]  United States of America...
[00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:54.544]  Yeah.
[00:54:24.073 --> 00:54:25.614]  Let's start it from the beginning.
[00:54:25.614 --> 00:54:27.415]  Can we do that?
[00:54:27.415 --> 00:54:30.797]  I want to start it from the beginning, just so people can see this lady.
[00:54:30.797 --> 00:54:31.158]  It's online.
[00:54:31.158 --> 00:54:32.098]  It goes on for like 30 minutes.
[00:54:32.098 --> 00:54:34.339]  Her howling, with her tongue hanging out.
[00:54:34.339 --> 00:54:37.081]  And the thing is, Eddie, if you go to these events, this is how people act.
[00:54:37.081 --> 00:54:38.062]  Here it is.
[00:54:38.062 --> 00:54:39.983]  Now for something completely different.
[00:54:39.983 --> 00:54:48.568]  When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk fear.
[00:54:52.904 --> 00:54:58.909]  It's more like babies throwing fish, but they're all super pale, little pot bellies, and they just look like undead.
[00:54:58.909 --> 00:55:04.514]  Then later she has her tongue hanging out, going bleh.
[00:55:04.514 --> 00:55:05.074]  Oh, man.
[00:55:05.074 --> 00:55:07.456]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[00:55:07.456 --> 00:55:12.680]  Something's going on.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.842]  Look at this.
[00:55:14.842 --> 00:55:19.346]  Look at this.
[00:55:19.346 --> 00:55:20.787]  And that's what you see in mental institutions.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:22.320]  U.S.A!
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.221]  U.S.A!
[00:55:23.221 --> 00:55:24.102]  U.S.A!
[00:55:24.102 --> 00:55:25.884]  But wait, give her a chance.
[00:55:25.884 --> 00:55:28.426]  When she calms down, she might have an actual argument.
[00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:38.711]  I don't know, man.
[00:55:38.711 --> 00:55:39.892]  Mass hypnosis?
[00:55:39.892 --> 00:55:40.292]  I don't know.
[00:55:40.292 --> 00:55:41.313]  I think people are...
[00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:11.694]  I mean, I think you guys should start doing a whole conspiracy podcast.
[00:56:11.694 --> 00:56:15.218]  You already hosted a national TV show.
[00:56:15.218 --> 00:56:18.020]  I don't think Joe wants to do a conspiracy podcast.
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:21.023]  I think he wants to keep, you know, just doing what he's doing.
[00:56:21.023 --> 00:56:22.144]  He's busy.
[00:56:22.144 --> 00:56:24.546]  But more and more he is, because he's not a liberal or conservative.
[00:56:24.546 --> 00:56:25.928]  He's more, what, a libertarian kind of, right?
[00:56:27.227 --> 00:56:27.907]  I think.
[00:56:27.907 --> 00:56:33.171]  But more and more he's getting mad at the liberals and just the young Turks, how they call everybody a racist when they're not.
[00:56:33.171 --> 00:56:34.532]  I've seen that a lot on the show.
[00:56:34.532 --> 00:56:35.773]  It's getting really big.
[00:56:35.773 --> 00:56:45.180]  You know, Brian Callen, who's also on the show too, when we do Fight Companions, he's about as far left as you can get, as far pro-government as you can get.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:48.062]  But he's been texting me the stuff that's been coming out in Vault 7.
[00:56:48.062 --> 00:56:52.665]  He's been going, whoa, maybe there is some truth to what you're saying, you know?
[00:56:52.665 --> 00:56:55.547]  Well, yeah, it's not the government's bad itself.
[00:56:55.547 --> 00:56:56.808]  There's rogue elements in there.
[00:56:57.108 --> 00:57:04.417]  Yeah, you know, if Brian Callen is kind of awakening, he's like, he's like, sort of awake, you know, in the sun.
[00:57:04.417 --> 00:57:05.498]  He's kind of waking up.
[00:57:05.498 --> 00:57:06.880]  So there's hope.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.160]  There's hope.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:07.921]  You know, that was crazy.
[00:57:07.921 --> 00:57:08.882]  Joe talked about that.
[00:57:08.882 --> 00:57:12.186]  Like, literally, almost all the comments were positive.
[00:57:12.186 --> 00:57:14.689]  All these people that hated me said, wow, I actually like Alex Jones now.
[00:57:14.689 --> 00:57:14.829]  Yeah.
[00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:16.031]  Because they actually heard me talk.
[00:57:16.371 --> 00:57:23.415]  Yeah, and the more people hated me, it didn't bother me that much because it meant that they wanted to listen to you more.
[00:57:23.415 --> 00:57:26.177]  They were mad at me for interrupting you.
[00:57:26.177 --> 00:57:30.980]  So for me, the main thing for me was that people listen to you.
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.281]  You got all the facts.
[00:57:32.281 --> 00:57:34.182]  You got all the documents.
[00:57:34.182 --> 00:57:35.983]  I'm trying to direct people to listen to you.
[00:57:35.983 --> 00:57:37.084]  Well, a lot of it's not even that.
[00:57:37.084 --> 00:57:40.066]  I mean, if I get it and the listener tells me, get John P. Holdren's book.
[00:57:40.066 --> 00:57:42.887]  He talks about fluoride to sterilize us and make us dumb.
[00:57:42.887 --> 00:57:44.468]  I go get the book and he says it in there.
[00:57:44.468 --> 00:57:45.529]  And I'm not that smart.
[00:57:45.629 --> 00:57:48.511]  How crazy is it that people are okay with fluoride in our water?
[00:57:48.511 --> 00:57:49.372]  How crazy is that?
[00:57:49.372 --> 00:57:51.794]  Even Harvard admits, take it out, it's causing cancer.
[00:57:51.794 --> 00:57:52.995]  They just won't do it.
[00:57:52.995 --> 00:57:56.018]  They just laugh and go, oh, you're a cook.
[00:57:56.018 --> 00:57:57.919]  People don't seem to mind.
[00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:00.242]  Fluoride in the water.
[00:58:00.242 --> 00:58:01.883]  Well then they go, well you need some fluoride.
[00:58:01.883 --> 00:58:03.985]  Yeah, you'll die without a small amount of calcium fluoride.
[00:58:03.985 --> 00:58:06.107]  We're talking about hydrofluorosilic.
[00:58:06.107 --> 00:58:06.867]  Yeah.
[00:58:06.867 --> 00:58:08.528]  It's acid out of fluoride.
[00:58:08.528 --> 00:58:13.212]  And people think that the government really cares about our teeth, like they're doing it to take care of our teeth.
[00:58:13.212 --> 00:58:17.696]  Now let's put that article back up, because every time we put them up there's a pop-up on all these sites, but I want to put it back up.
[00:58:17.696 --> 00:58:21.539]  The crew does a great job, and after a pop-up pops up, they take it down, and then we never see it.
[00:58:21.539 --> 00:58:22.119]  Now there it is.
[00:58:22.119 --> 00:58:23.921]  Impact of fluoride on neurological development in children.
[00:58:25.956 --> 00:58:28.397]  Is Trump doing, does he know about the whole fluoride thing?
[00:58:28.397 --> 00:58:29.257]  Oh yeah, he knows all of it.
[00:58:29.257 --> 00:58:36.660]  He's just, he's trying to get the economy turned back on, so everybody gets on his side, and the vaccines, the fluoride, the geoengineering, it's all over.
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.700]  Is he aware of Stratospheric?
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:42.061]  I haven't talked to him specifically, but I mentioned, yeah he knows.
[00:58:42.061 --> 00:58:46.783]  The word was, from high-level CIA they go, the president knows everything.
[00:58:46.783 --> 00:58:48.804]  They've all told him, he knows everything.
[00:58:48.804 --> 00:58:49.384]  He knows more than we know.
[00:58:49.983 --> 00:58:54.468]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:58:54.468 --> 00:59:05.400]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:10.604]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:59:10.604 --> 00:59:13.186]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:59:13.186 --> 00:59:14.887]  It helps detoxify.
[00:59:14.887 --> 00:59:17.789]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:59:17.789 --> 00:59:22.553]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:59:22.553 --> 00:59:28.818]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:59:28.818 --> 00:59:34.242]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:59:34.242 --> 00:59:35.483]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:59:36.003 --> 00:59:37.344]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:15.066 --> 01:00:16.990]  We are on the march.
[01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:20.157]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:00:20.157 --> 01:00:23.885]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:35.444 --> 01:00:41.849]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to show you that Joe Rogan kick that's one of the best out there, according to Eddie Bravo, and getting us some other issues.
[01:00:41.849 --> 01:00:44.090]  But Eddie, stop saying I'm the one that's the expert.
[01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:46.973]  The show is all about everybody doing their own research.
[01:00:46.973 --> 01:00:57.380]  Paul Watson goes out, you know, 12 years ago and finds Google saying, we're watching you over the camera, we're listening to you over the microphone, in a press release to shareholders about a new form of advertising.
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:58.982]  So anybody can do this.
[01:00:59.702 --> 01:01:02.826]  And you're just as smart or smarter than I am, so... No, I doubt that.
[01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:03.306]  B.S.!
[01:01:03.306 --> 01:01:04.047]  And what is research?
[01:01:04.047 --> 01:01:04.808]  You're too humble.
[01:01:04.808 --> 01:01:11.236]  Let's define research, because some people think that getting on the internet is not research.
[01:01:11.236 --> 01:01:13.098]  You have to go to a library or something.
[01:01:13.098 --> 01:01:13.398]  No.
[01:01:13.398 --> 01:01:14.760]  What's research mean?
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.846]  Research means, okay, well they have all these reports that... Can you get on the internet and do research?
[01:01:21.175 --> 01:01:21.996]  Yes.
[01:01:21.996 --> 01:01:23.618]  Okay, can you get on YouTube and do research?
[01:01:23.618 --> 01:01:24.639]  Yes.
[01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:25.039]  Uh, okay.
[01:01:25.039 --> 01:01:35.830]  Some people think, oh, it's weird that the same people that say, um, there was a guy on Joe Rogan's podcast, some paleontologist, he's like, isn't it, isn't it fucking, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:01:36.551 --> 01:01:38.452]  We're going to delay it.
[01:01:38.452 --> 01:01:44.514]  Isn't it amazing that we have all the information of all time on our watch?
[01:01:44.514 --> 01:01:46.014]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:01:46.014 --> 01:01:46.574]  It's incredible.
[01:01:46.574 --> 01:01:47.615]  This is the real Eddie Bravo.
[01:01:47.615 --> 01:01:48.755]  It's an incredible time.
[01:01:48.755 --> 01:01:49.755]  The cuss words are coming.
[01:01:49.755 --> 01:01:53.637]  And then all of a sudden... The dinosaurs are replicas!
[01:01:53.637 --> 01:01:55.397]  Do it for me.
[01:01:55.397 --> 01:01:55.837]  I love it.
[01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:56.418]  Did you know that...
[01:01:58.297 --> 01:02:02.079]  All the skeletons of dinosaurs in all the museums are all replicas.
[01:02:02.079 --> 01:02:06.822]  They're not, because the real bones are too sensitive and they don't want people touching them, so they lock them up so no one can see them.
[01:02:06.822 --> 01:02:09.163]  So all the skeletons that you see, did you know this?
[01:02:09.163 --> 01:02:10.103]  I didn't know this.
[01:02:10.103 --> 01:02:10.784]  They're replicas.
[01:02:12.619 --> 01:02:13.259]  Isn't that weird?
[01:02:13.259 --> 01:02:14.520]  Isn't that weird?
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.561]  I want to take you to the Natural History Museum.
[01:02:16.561 --> 01:02:21.544]  They're going to have a headline tonight on CNN, Alex Jones says dinosaurs weren't real.
[01:02:21.544 --> 01:02:24.386]  I'm going to tell you right now, I believe in it.
[01:02:24.386 --> 01:02:28.028]  But there's such liars in media and science that have been caught with big lies.
[01:02:28.028 --> 01:02:32.530]  All the big stuff with Piltdown Man and all the fake early humanoids they claim they dug up.
[01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:36.933]  Yes, there's a big history of paleontologists and archaeologists faking things.
[01:02:36.933 --> 01:02:38.614]  That's an admitted fact.
[01:02:38.614 --> 01:02:41.536]  Google, history of archaeologists faking finds.
[01:02:42.176 --> 01:02:45.418]  It's epidemic, it's massive, it's a big problem.
[01:02:45.418 --> 01:02:46.639]  So you're right.
[01:02:46.639 --> 01:02:47.320]  Question?
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:03:04.271]  Yeah, I'll, you know, if there's something out there that I gotta take some unknown scientist's word for, some unknown government scientist's word for, and there's science that we don't know anything about the experiments, you know, we just gotta take someone's word for it, a government scientist?
[01:03:04.271 --> 01:03:08.794]  Well, my grandfather was an archaeology major at UT.
[01:03:08.794 --> 01:03:09.274]  Yeah.
[01:03:09.274 --> 01:03:10.055]  After World War II.
[01:03:10.055 --> 01:03:11.416]  It was before World War II.
[01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:20.978]  And he was involved out with our building like Travis when you know when they found stuff and he saw them dig up the plesiosaur.
[01:03:20.978 --> 01:03:21.578]  That's at UT.
[01:03:21.578 --> 01:03:26.959]  So if you go to UT, a lot of the places have these big giant ones where only a few pieces are real and they will fall apart.
[01:03:26.959 --> 01:03:29.079]  They try to weld all those together so plastic's easier.
[01:03:29.079 --> 01:03:30.579]  They think the public's dumb.
[01:03:30.579 --> 01:03:38.301]  But you go to UT, you go to the Natural History Museum, you go downstairs, nobody wants to look at it, you'll see 100% real dinosaurs all over the place.
[01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.323]  It's just... They're not replicas?
[01:03:41.323 --> 01:03:42.364]  They're not replicas.
[01:03:42.364 --> 01:03:43.085]  Okay.
[01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:43.926]  Alright, then.
[01:03:43.926 --> 01:03:45.047]  I stand corrected.
[01:03:45.047 --> 01:03:48.531]  You can argue about how long ago they were really here.
[01:03:51.867 --> 01:04:03.399]  Well, my point is, if you go to a museum and there's a dinosaur skeleton and it's a replica, it's only cool to see a dinosaur skeleton if it's a real dinosaur skeleton.
[01:04:03.399 --> 01:04:05.521]  If it's fake, you might as well put skin on it.
[01:04:05.521 --> 01:04:05.981]  No, I agree.
[01:04:05.981 --> 01:04:09.044]  When you go to the New York Metropolitan thing or the Smithsonian, most of it are
[01:04:09.725 --> 01:04:10.366]  Replicas.
[01:04:10.366 --> 01:04:11.808]  It's only cool if they're real.
[01:04:11.808 --> 01:04:16.794]  If it's not real, you might as well... And then they call it a conspiracy theory if you say it's a replica.
[01:04:16.794 --> 01:04:18.035]  Why are they showing us replicas?
[01:04:18.035 --> 01:04:23.001]  Yeah, why not just put fake skin on it too and just... It's only cool to see a skeleton of a dinosaur.
[01:04:23.001 --> 01:04:25.844]  I took my kids to that walking with dinosaurs where the robots come out.
[01:04:25.844 --> 01:04:27.787]  Yeah, you might as well just... Maybe that's real, huh?
[01:04:27.787 --> 01:04:28.427]  Fake the whole thing.
[01:04:29.088 --> 01:04:33.613]  No, you've got a great point, because what do you do when the media gets caught lying so much, it then discredits all of it.
[01:04:33.613 --> 01:04:34.534]  I mean, who knows what's real, huh?
[01:04:34.534 --> 01:04:42.222]  Yeah, and, you know, something that existed 60 million years ago, come on, you gotta, you gotta question it.
[01:04:42.222 --> 01:04:48.268]  You gotta, uh... I just love how Joe says during breaks, like, Eddie doesn't think dinosaurs are real.
[01:04:48.268 --> 01:04:49.129]  He says it like that.
[01:04:49.489 --> 01:04:50.830]  Hey, I'm just questioning it, man.
[01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:51.790]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:55.672]  Look, look, look, an alligator's not in the dinosaur family, but it's even predates dinosaurs.
[01:04:55.672 --> 01:04:56.373]  Yeah.
[01:04:56.373 --> 01:04:59.975]  I mean, you get a 24-foot-long saltwater crocodile, that's a dinosaur.
[01:04:59.975 --> 01:05:08.799]  A previously debunked claim alleging then-candidate Donald Trump ran a secret server to communicate with Russia during the 2016 presidential race.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.081]  Has resurfaced!
[01:05:12.081 --> 01:05:18.308]  The establishment mainstream media is now rehashing the story, which has already been debunked.
[01:05:18.308 --> 01:05:31.862]  After President Donald Trump on Saturday accused his predecessor, Barack Obama, of illegally wiretapping phone calls at New York's Trump Tower, mainstream media outlets began to list possible surveillance targets.
[01:05:32.202 --> 01:05:37.343]  Including Trump's so-called secret server to talk with the Russians.
[01:05:37.343 --> 01:05:40.064]  And look who's spreading the fake news.
[01:05:40.064 --> 01:05:47.826]  Hillary Clinton posted on Twitter that it's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia.
[01:05:47.826 --> 01:05:54.507]  And she included a link to the original Slate article that started the bogus rumor to begin with.
[01:05:54.507 --> 01:05:58.208]  You can check out the real news right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:00.447 --> 01:06:02.028]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:02.028 --> 01:06:07.931]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:06:07.931 --> 01:06:10.472]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:06:10.472 --> 01:06:16.275]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:06:16.275 --> 01:06:24.979]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:25.379 --> 01:06:30.927]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:06:30.927 --> 01:06:37.976]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[01:06:37.976 --> 01:06:42.522]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.

[01:06:59.676 --> 01:07:10.248]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:10.248 --> 01:07:16.155]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[01:07:16.155 --> 01:07:17.516]  Iodine is key.
[01:07:17.516 --> 01:07:18.097]  It's paramount.
[01:07:18.337 --> 01:07:23.362]  And there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[01:07:23.362 --> 01:07:32.310]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:36.234]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[01:07:36.234 --> 01:07:39.056]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:43.120]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:43.880]  We're good.
[01:08:14.076 --> 01:08:19.859]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:19.859 --> 01:08:31.365]  You know, during the break, Fox News and CNN and stuff were on in there in the control room, and it was like, White House under increasing pressure to show the evidence of wiretapping.
[01:08:31.365 --> 01:08:32.325]  There's no such thing.
[01:08:32.325 --> 01:08:39.889]  The CIA and Google and everybody just admits they tap hundreds of millions of people a day, and they just admitted they were listening to General Flynn at Trump Tower.
[01:08:40.769 --> 01:08:44.372]  And we've got top CIA people coming out saying that he was under surveillance.
[01:08:44.372 --> 01:08:46.153]  They're like, how dare Trump?
[01:08:46.153 --> 01:08:48.375]  We want to impeach him, Bloomberg says.
[01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:49.876]  Here it is.
[01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:53.259]  Trump's wiretap tweets raise risk of impeachment.
[01:08:53.259 --> 01:08:55.380]  Noah Feldman.
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.881]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:08:56.881 --> 01:08:57.782]  They turn it all around.
[01:08:57.782 --> 01:09:01.525]  It should be, wow, Vault 7.
[01:09:01.525 --> 01:09:06.949]  Cameras on your phone, cameras on your computer, the sensors, the audio listening to you.
[01:09:06.949 --> 01:09:07.950]  That's been out forever.
[01:09:08.953 --> 01:09:17.822]  They turn it all around, how dare Trump say Obama was spying on him, when they admittedly, remember a month ago, they said, we heard General Flynn with the Russians, we were wiretapping him!
[01:09:17.822 --> 01:09:19.324]  So Trump goes, what are you doing wiretapping me?
[01:09:19.324 --> 01:09:21.506]  You're crazy, we didn't wiretap you!
[01:09:21.506 --> 01:09:29.874]  I mean, the games they play, Eddie Bravo of 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu, one of the top Jiu-Jitsu trainers in the world, of course, one of the co-hosts, Joe Rogan, an experienced podcast.
[01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:31.996]  You have to get out your websites, give folks your websites.
[01:09:32.725 --> 01:09:37.310]  10thplanetjj.com, 10thplanetjj.com.
[01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:42.094]  If you want to learn jujitsu online or anything like that.
[01:09:42.094 --> 01:09:43.676]  You were like super calm on air with me.
[01:09:43.676 --> 01:09:45.958]  You were out of control with Joe Rogan.
[01:09:45.958 --> 01:09:47.380]  Where's the shots?
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:47.860]  Where's the what?
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:49.041]  Where's the shots?
[01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:50.343]  Oh yeah, we need to get some shots going.
[01:09:50.343 --> 01:09:51.444]  You want to wake me up?
[01:09:51.444 --> 01:09:52.425]  You got to pull out the whiskey.
[01:09:54.309 --> 01:09:55.569]  That wasn't real whiskey we were drinking.
[01:09:55.569 --> 01:09:57.150]  We're like Hollywood people.
[01:09:57.150 --> 01:10:00.431]  We were drinking like, you know, just like brown watercolor.
[01:10:00.431 --> 01:10:07.233]  I told Joe no more whiskey and he gave me the green light so, you know, I can bite my tongue and be calm.
[01:10:07.233 --> 01:10:09.514]  You go in that little kitchen, there's like 20 bottles of whiskey in there.
[01:10:11.854 --> 01:10:14.614]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:14.614 --> 01:10:21.596]  But on the dinosaur thing really quick, if you want to look into the whole, did dinosaurs really exist?
[01:10:21.596 --> 01:10:27.617]  Go to YouTube, look up Eric Dubé's Dinosaurs Don't Exist, and decide for yourself.
[01:10:27.617 --> 01:10:28.797]  You know what's crazy?
[01:10:28.797 --> 01:10:29.597]  Who's the Christian guy?
[01:10:29.597 --> 01:10:31.557]  I forget his name, I've had him on.
[01:10:31.557 --> 01:10:33.458]  Who's the guy that Florida had the Dino Museum?
[01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:33.718]  Kent Holand?
[01:10:33.718 --> 01:10:33.858]  Holand.
[01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:42.684]  Hovind, okay.
[01:10:42.684 --> 01:10:43.465]  It's real distorted.
[01:10:43.465 --> 01:10:45.366]  You guys feed to me the last few weeks.
[01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:50.207]  I've not really binged about it, but it's just like, it's like, SILENT RAIDERS ARE ATTACKING THE PLANET!
[01:10:50.207 --> 01:10:51.388]  ALEX IS A LITTLE SCARED!
[01:10:51.388 --> 01:10:53.089]  WE ARE THE SCARED SCARED WARRIORS!
[01:10:53.089 --> 01:10:59.331]  I'm not mad, it's just they keep repeating stuff to me because I just have to like, portend what's being said down the system.
[01:10:59.331 --> 01:11:07.334]  But, yeah, he just did this Creation Museum and saying the dinosaurs, you know, lived before the Flood.
[01:11:07.334 --> 01:11:08.455]  They threw his ass in prison.
[01:11:09.656 --> 01:11:11.857]  Yeah, let's, you know, for questions, I don't know.
[01:11:11.857 --> 01:11:15.900]  They said it was tax evasion because he had a 501c3 for his religious beliefs.
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:17.020]  You're supposed to have that.
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:22.564]  I mean, if they could have 501c3s to fund people to go kill cops, why can't, why can't that guy have that?
[01:11:22.564 --> 01:11:23.484]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:23.484 --> 01:11:28.647]  I don't know anything about that guy though, but Eric Dubay, YouTube, that guy, he's, he breaks it down.
[01:11:28.647 --> 01:11:30.548]  It's pretty entertaining at the very least.
[01:11:30.548 --> 01:11:34.671]  We should have Dr. Kent Hovind back on the broadcast.
[01:11:34.671 --> 01:11:35.391]  He's a good guy.
[01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:36.452]  Now I'm getting serious though.
[01:11:38.132 --> 01:11:40.714]  What do you make, be honest, of Trump?
[01:11:57.483 --> 01:11:58.043]  Yes.
[01:11:58.043 --> 01:11:58.123]  Yes.
[01:12:27.506 --> 01:12:27.586]  Yes.
[01:12:57.426 --> 01:12:59.647]  So listen, so you asked me about Trump.
[01:12:59.647 --> 01:13:13.873]  Either what you're saying about Trump is the truth and I'm behind Trump, or maybe the globalists thought, how do we crush the US economy and make them just like all the other countries in the Western Hemisphere?
[01:13:13.873 --> 01:13:18.775]  Maybe, maybe if we let Donald Trump be president, people will freak out, we'll aid the freak out.
[01:13:18.775 --> 01:13:22.237]  Maybe they wanted Trump and so to divide us.
[01:13:22.237 --> 01:13:23.117]  That's actually true.
[01:13:23.117 --> 01:13:23.597]  I don't know.
[01:13:23.597 --> 01:13:24.678]  Maybe they wanted it.
[01:13:24.938 --> 01:13:26.758]  Early on, they thought Trump was easily beaten.
[01:13:26.758 --> 01:13:27.859]  It blew up in their face.
[01:13:27.859 --> 01:13:34.020]  They wanted him against Hillary thinking he'd lose, but they didn't understand that the public was awake.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:38.440]  See, there's a lot of smart folks in these agencies, but the politicians like Hillary don't listen anymore.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.560]  They're in charge.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:42.001]  They're completely disconnected from reality.
[01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:42.901]  They don't know what they're doing.
[01:13:42.901 --> 01:13:45.522]  Trump completely bit them in the butt.
[01:13:45.522 --> 01:13:47.582]  I hope that's true.
[01:13:47.582 --> 01:13:48.142]  I hope that's true.
[01:13:48.142 --> 01:13:50.142]  Oh, he's real.
[01:13:50.142 --> 01:13:51.583]  Look at the MSM, how much they hate him.
[01:13:54.858 --> 01:14:02.162]  The globalists, or whoever's in charge, Illuminati or whatever, maybe the plan was, like, how do we crush America's economy?
[01:14:02.162 --> 01:14:03.944]  Let's get Trump in there.
[01:14:03.944 --> 01:14:07.606]  He's gonna, and Trump's probably not even involved in it, in that.
[01:14:07.606 --> 01:14:09.607]  He's just actually trying to do the right thing.
[01:14:09.607 --> 01:14:11.628]  Eddie, globalism's in trouble all over the world, though.
[01:14:11.628 --> 01:14:12.929]  They're trying to force-feed it.
[01:14:12.929 --> 01:14:13.669]  They were arrogant.
[01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:14.070]  It's failing.
[01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:15.330]  They're not invincible.
[01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:15.811]  Okay.
[01:14:15.811 --> 01:14:16.691]  You know what the Illuminati means?
[01:14:16.691 --> 01:14:17.392]  I want to believe that.
[01:14:17.892 --> 01:14:18.872]  You know what the Illuminati means?
[01:14:18.872 --> 01:14:19.953]  The illuminated ones?
[01:14:19.953 --> 01:14:20.713]  Yeah.
[01:14:20.713 --> 01:14:27.696]  And actually, there was a renaissance against tyranny, and then the corrupt groups tried to take over movements of the renaissance.
[01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.357]  They called themselves the Illuminati.
[01:14:29.357 --> 01:14:32.698]  They were the ones trying to hijack the renaissance and end it.
[01:14:32.698 --> 01:14:36.640]  So the false Illuminati calls itself the Illuminati.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.642]  But there's a real Illuminati, and nobody's even officially part of it.
[01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:42.443]  It's just anybody that wants to empower humanity.
[01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:46.372]  Okay, so you could say I'm one of the leaders of the Illuminati worldwide.
[01:14:46.372 --> 01:14:48.556]  And you could probably argue I'm the leader of the Illuminati.
[01:14:48.556 --> 01:14:49.518]  Or Donald Trump is.
[01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:50.600]  They're gonna sample that.
[01:14:51.684 --> 01:14:52.785]  Well, I mean, let's get real.
[01:14:52.785 --> 01:14:55.226]  Alex Jones admits he's Illuminati.
[01:14:55.226 --> 01:14:56.146]  Well, I do, actually.
[01:14:56.146 --> 01:14:58.468]  George Washington was the leader of the Illuminati.
[01:14:58.468 --> 01:14:59.768]  The real Illuminati.
[01:14:59.768 --> 01:15:02.090]  And then the French Revolution was the false Illuminati.
[01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:03.050]  This was all in his letters.
[01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:04.331]  This was known.
[01:15:04.331 --> 01:15:07.552]  They really wanted to end slavery.
[01:15:07.552 --> 01:15:10.654]  It didn't mean they got it done, but they had this idea of empowering humanity.
[01:15:10.654 --> 01:15:12.015]  That was meant illuminated.
[01:15:12.015 --> 01:15:13.395]  God is the real light.
[01:15:13.395 --> 01:15:15.717]  Lucifer is the lightbearer of the false light.
[01:15:15.717 --> 01:15:18.058]  So God is the real illumination.
[01:15:18.058 --> 01:15:19.559]  There's a false counterfeit.
[01:15:20.279 --> 01:15:25.863]  So the Illuminati we know of that does all this bad stuff and all the devil worship and stuff and compromising people in sex orgies and things?
[01:15:25.863 --> 01:15:27.044]  That's how they did it back then?
[01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:28.345]  Now it's child molestation.
[01:15:28.345 --> 01:15:30.787]  Back then you'd get in trouble for an orgy with women.
[01:15:30.787 --> 01:15:31.588]  Okay?
[01:15:31.588 --> 01:15:32.549]  What women?
[01:15:32.549 --> 01:15:34.550]  I mean, you know, 240 years ago.
[01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:36.632]  Now it's gotta be child molestation.
[01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:37.993]  And notice Trump's exposing all that.
[01:15:37.993 --> 01:15:38.914]  He's rolling that up.
[01:15:38.914 --> 01:15:39.414]  Town Hall.
[01:15:39.414 --> 01:15:41.996]  Why is MSM ignoring Trump's sex trafficking bust?
[01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:42.477]  But I'm not...
[01:15:43.447 --> 01:15:44.729]  I don't go to secret rituals.
[01:15:44.729 --> 01:15:46.651]  I'm not in some group.
[01:15:46.651 --> 01:15:49.655]  I'm not... I mean, I'm with the Renaissance.
[01:15:49.655 --> 01:15:51.237]  True human empowerment.
[01:15:51.237 --> 01:15:52.599]  It's just an idea.
[01:15:52.599 --> 01:15:56.304]  That's the real elimination versus the false elimination that's the Illuminati.
[01:15:57.551 --> 01:15:58.331]  Let's expand on that.
[01:15:58.331 --> 01:15:58.991]  I got invited.
[01:15:58.991 --> 01:16:06.653]  I got told by a major movie star, who was a Rhodes Scholar, that you're going to be invited to Oxford in the next couple months.
[01:16:06.653 --> 01:16:07.593]  And it's not just going to be in Oxford.
[01:16:07.593 --> 01:16:09.153]  You're not just going to speak to the faculty.
[01:16:09.153 --> 01:16:14.094]  They're going to want you to go in these underground caves and do sex rituals, and then you're going to be in the Illuminati.
[01:16:14.094 --> 01:16:15.774]  And I said, OK, yeah, whatever.
[01:16:15.774 --> 01:16:19.135]  And then I got the call, an official letterhead, you know, come speak at Oxford.
[01:16:19.135 --> 01:16:20.595]  I said, no, Cambridge, you know, called.
[01:16:20.595 --> 01:16:21.675]  That's a different group.
[01:16:21.675 --> 01:16:24.596]  And it was really, they were telling me, come to the thing, you want to join the group.
[01:16:25.497 --> 01:16:28.061]  And Benjamin Franklin had gone when he lived in England and actually been part of those.
[01:16:28.061 --> 01:16:29.042]  It was the Hellfire Club.
[01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:32.488]  So I've been invited to the Hellfire Club in England.
[01:16:32.488 --> 01:16:33.971]  But that's real, brother.
[01:16:33.971 --> 01:16:34.672]  All my kids.
[01:16:34.672 --> 01:16:35.533]  That's real.
[01:16:35.533 --> 01:16:36.976]  So, you understand?
[01:16:36.976 --> 01:16:37.437]  This stuff's real.
[01:16:38.752 --> 01:16:40.133]  Yeah, it's pretty crazy, right?
[01:16:40.133 --> 01:16:40.633]  Yeah.
[01:16:40.633 --> 01:16:49.758]  I mean, doesn't it, is, so is there, I know there was a bust in Southern California, they busted like 400 people for some kind of child sex.
[01:16:49.758 --> 01:16:50.739]  Thousands now, yeah.
[01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:53.360]  But isn't there, was there a new one?
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.221]  All over, New York, Pennsylvania.
[01:16:55.221 --> 01:16:57.323]  Politicians this time, right?
[01:16:57.323 --> 01:17:00.484]  Yeah, well they're getting the handlers and Sandusky's son, you name him, here he is.
[01:17:02.096 --> 01:17:03.037]  Is this Town Hall?
[01:17:03.037 --> 01:17:04.978]  That's KTLA.
[01:17:04.978 --> 01:17:08.600]  That happened the day I was out there at Joe's, or the day before.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:09.901]  Now which is the latest one?
[01:17:09.901 --> 01:17:10.482]  The latest one?
[01:17:10.482 --> 01:17:14.744]  The president was just, it's just sex trafficking rings are being busted everywhere.
[01:17:14.744 --> 01:17:17.866]  They knew where they were, they were just never allowed to bust them because they were procuring kids.
[01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:18.867]  See all these articles?
[01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:24.891]  Do you think that could be the reason there's such a resistance against Trump because he's busting these people?
[01:17:24.891 --> 01:17:25.832]  Oh absolutely, he's not a pedophile.
[01:17:26.252 --> 01:17:35.459]  Yeah, and it seems, it seems like, according to Ted Gunderson, if you look at, he was an ex-FBI chief in L.A.
[01:17:35.459 --> 01:17:46.528]  He was the one talking about this gigantic... He exposed, on my show, Penn State, like 15 years, I was like saying, sir, don't say that during the breaks, I don't want to get sued.
[01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:50.931]  He exposed Boys Town before it broke, he exposed Penn State, he told me about the British
[01:17:52.349 --> 01:17:55.451]  Prime Minister from his sources and MI5 slitting kids' throats.
[01:17:55.451 --> 01:17:57.252]  That was just in the news last week.
[01:17:57.252 --> 01:17:59.854]  The major police chief says he was a pedophile.
[01:17:59.854 --> 01:18:01.155]  I learned about it from other sources.
[01:18:01.155 --> 01:18:02.516]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:18:02.516 --> 01:18:06.238]  Well, Ted Gunnarsson, again, he has many videos on YouTube.
[01:18:06.238 --> 01:18:07.599]  He's dead now, but yeah.
[01:18:07.599 --> 01:18:09.961]  He thought, didn't he think they were killing him and poisoning him?
[01:18:09.961 --> 01:18:10.581]  Oh, they did.
[01:18:10.581 --> 01:18:11.522]  They touched his blood.
[01:18:11.522 --> 01:18:12.923]  He had arsenic.
[01:18:12.923 --> 01:18:13.523]  Yeah.
[01:18:13.523 --> 01:18:15.004]  He was a tough guy, man.
[01:18:15.004 --> 01:18:19.487]  And he said, he not only... They poisoned, I'm not allowed to get into it, they poisoned three other people.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.742]  And he was in the FBI for 27 years.
[01:18:22.742 --> 01:18:24.364]  He was the head of California.
[01:18:24.364 --> 01:18:25.125]  Yes.
[01:18:25.125 --> 01:18:40.280]  And there's many videos of Ted Gunderson, former FBI chief, talking about not only the gigantic pedophile ring that's going on nationally and internationally, but he was talking about the Satanism that's involved as well.
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:40.901]  People think you're crazy.
[01:18:42.202 --> 01:18:43.303]  Thank you for talking about that.
[01:18:43.303 --> 01:18:51.867]  Look, a regular gang, whether it's white supremacist or Mexican gang, you've got to go rob a liquor store, you've got to hit an old lady in the head with a gun, you've got to shoot somebody, you've got to kill a rival gang member.
[01:18:51.867 --> 01:18:52.788]  Those are rituals.
[01:18:52.788 --> 01:18:53.048]  Yeah.
[01:18:53.048 --> 01:18:53.968]  Earn your bones.
[01:18:53.968 --> 01:18:54.189]  Yeah.
[01:18:54.189 --> 01:19:01.613]  You know, I earned my bones when you were with cheerleaders, you know, from the Godfather, from Shubb.
[01:19:01.613 --> 01:19:03.874]  But that's not enough.
[01:19:03.874 --> 01:19:05.775]  That's just showing you'll kill somebody and they've got dirt on you.
[01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:10.819]  You've got to hurt kids, and it's not just molest them.
[01:19:10.819 --> 01:19:12.603]  The highest levels, they kill them.
[01:19:13.703 --> 01:19:16.125]  And they do something, something about baby blood, right?
[01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:26.071]  There's something... Well, they terrorize the kid, then they drain their blood off while they pump all their hormones out, and then they drink all the adrenaline and all this, and then the essence, yeah.
[01:19:26.071 --> 01:19:29.454]  So, could... By the way, Satanist groups have been caught doing that.
[01:19:29.454 --> 01:19:39.160]  Wouldn't it be smart for the people that are running these rings, the people at the top, to get as many people involved as possible, right, in high places, in powerful places?
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:42.122]  It seems like there's this giant resistance
[01:19:44.443 --> 01:19:48.125]  For Trump, it just seems like he's got to have something to do.
[01:19:48.125 --> 01:19:49.066]  They're coming after me.
[01:19:49.066 --> 01:19:51.827]  I mean, I can't get into it on air, but they have.
[01:19:51.827 --> 01:19:53.748]  We already lost, this year it would be $5 million.
[01:19:53.748 --> 01:19:55.248]  That was all our extra budget and more.
[01:19:55.248 --> 01:19:56.029]  They took it away.
[01:19:56.029 --> 01:19:57.009]  Google banned us.
[01:19:57.009 --> 01:19:58.070]  Facebook's banning us, bro.
[01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:59.690]  I mean, we're getting hit hard.
[01:19:59.690 --> 01:20:00.231]  But I don't care.
[01:20:00.231 --> 01:20:01.191]  I'm going to keep going to the end.
[01:20:01.191 --> 01:20:02.512]  I mean, the listeners have come through, but they're...
[01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:08.087]  They're really, this operation is like, iffy if we can even stay where we're at.
[01:20:08.087 --> 01:20:11.269]  And I'm not trying to encourage the attacks, but they're having an effect.
[01:20:11.269 --> 01:20:13.110]  Listen, look what Facebook banned.
[01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:15.412]  They banned two things yesterday.
[01:20:15.412 --> 01:20:16.512]  The Rand Paul interview.
[01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:20.275]  I mean, it's a senator.
[01:20:20.275 --> 01:20:21.255]  How is that fake news?
[01:20:21.255 --> 01:20:22.776]  They didn't even notify us, they just banned it.
[01:20:22.776 --> 01:20:25.698]  They told USA Today they're not going to start banning news.
[01:20:25.698 --> 01:20:26.459]  That they say it's fake.
[01:20:27.236 --> 01:20:31.397]  And then also former, in fact pull this clip up guys and then I'll show the Joe Rogan kick.
[01:20:31.397 --> 01:20:35.979]  Former CIA analyst Obama gave green light for NSA, CIA to sabotage Trump.
[01:20:35.979 --> 01:20:44.522]  Former CIA analyst Larry C. Johnson says that according to his sources the Obama administration worked with the NSA and the CIA and Britain's GCHQ to
[01:20:46.104 --> 01:20:48.745]  Disseminate information about Trump that was illegally obtained.
[01:20:48.745 --> 01:20:50.905]  Well, they did illegally.
[01:20:50.905 --> 01:20:51.985]  They admittedly were surveilling.
[01:20:51.985 --> 01:20:53.046]  I think we forgot a month ago.
[01:20:53.046 --> 01:20:55.126]  They did surveillance before the election.
[01:20:55.126 --> 01:21:02.528]  Johnson joined the CIA in 85 and was later promoted to become Senior Regional Analyst for the Central Intelligence America.
[01:21:02.528 --> 01:21:03.508]  That's over the U.S.
[01:21:03.508 --> 01:21:08.609]  from Central America, so south of here, before moving on to his work with the State Department.
[01:21:08.609 --> 01:21:09.950]  And he went on to say it's a huge deal.
[01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:11.210]  It's totally illegal.
[01:21:11.210 --> 01:21:12.970]  And it's not their fault they keep missing clips.
[01:21:12.970 --> 01:21:14.451]  I keep jumping around what clip I'm going to.
[01:21:14.451 --> 01:21:15.611]  Do you guys have that clip ready?
[01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:25.311]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip from our team that is an admitted former CIA section analyst head.
[01:21:25.311 --> 01:21:27.592]  That's over thousands of people over a whole region.
[01:21:28.991 --> 01:21:37.016]  Central America, also operated North America, and he's telling RT this, and we're not allowed to give you this on Facebook.
[01:21:37.016 --> 01:21:40.198]  So, because this is fake?
[01:21:40.198 --> 01:21:45.421]  No, because we told you 12 years ago they were using cameras on your computer to watch you?
[01:21:45.421 --> 01:21:47.962]  It's because we're on target, folks.
[01:21:47.962 --> 01:21:50.744]  You think the President of the United States just calls regular people?
[01:21:50.744 --> 01:21:53.626]  You think the heads of
[01:21:55.151 --> 01:21:57.112]  I mean, I'm not gonna, I shouldn't even get into all this.
[01:21:57.112 --> 01:22:00.954]  See, I used to think the CIA was all the bad guys.
[01:22:00.954 --> 01:22:05.797]  They were actually just the people fighting for the country with bad people above them, and they were always getting burned.
[01:22:05.797 --> 01:22:11.020]  As a course of action, they would burn each new group of people to actually keep control of who the patriots were.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:23.107]  Like, I grew up and had some family that had been in covert action in the CIA, that's killing people, and all I'd ever heard was, you know, no, the government brings in the drugs, they kill people, you don't want to join it.
[01:22:24.375 --> 01:22:27.078]  And so I had that view.
[01:22:27.078 --> 01:22:31.922]  But over the years, the people inside that know all this now have the internet, they have us, they have the people.
[01:22:31.922 --> 01:22:42.111]  And so I've learned that like, major SEAL teams, in fact, the most elite SEAL team, but Army, Delta Force, you name it, years ago, they would come in and order them to listen to InfoWars.
[01:22:42.111 --> 01:22:46.255]  And I would hear this like, you know, 15 years ago and go, oh yeah, sure, right.
[01:22:46.255 --> 01:22:48.697]  Yeah, they'd tell Delta Force, listen to me, it's all confirmed now.
[01:22:49.418 --> 01:22:51.259]  And so there was no one else covering this.
[01:22:51.259 --> 01:22:52.861]  They said, you listen to Alex Jones.
[01:22:52.861 --> 01:22:54.462]  He knows what's going on.
[01:22:54.462 --> 01:22:58.385]  And that's just a fact now.
[01:22:58.385 --> 01:23:00.506]  The media never runs with this because they always talk about Trump.
[01:23:00.506 --> 01:23:03.068]  Well, he talks about how the intelligence community really loves me.
[01:23:03.068 --> 01:23:05.550]  So here we are saying that they're the enemy.
[01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:07.011]  William Binney was the head of the NSA.
[01:23:07.011 --> 01:23:09.693]  He actually ran it, not the director, but the technical head.
[01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:10.393]  He's a patriot.
[01:23:10.393 --> 01:23:11.794]  He comes on all the time.
[01:23:11.794 --> 01:23:15.477]  They're the ones that exposed it, Eddie.
[01:23:15.477 --> 01:23:17.378]  In fact, I was told by Pachinko, who was high-level CIA,
[01:23:18.683 --> 01:23:20.866]  He used to run actual overthrow governments.
[01:23:20.866 --> 01:23:25.953]  He said, oh, the next month they're going to release even more on the CIA to discipline the top of the CIA.
[01:23:25.953 --> 01:23:28.237]  The CIA released that on the CIA.
[01:23:28.237 --> 01:23:30.480]  Now, Dr. Steve Pachetnik, totally legit, right?
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.001]  Oh, yeah.
[01:23:31.001 --> 01:23:31.381]  High level.
[01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:39.372]  I mean, when he comes on the show, it's in, like, Italian newspapers, and then they send, like, you know, FBI to his house, and he's called before federal courts.
[01:23:39.372 --> 01:23:42.573]  I mean, when he releases stuff, they threaten him with national security arrest.
[01:23:42.573 --> 01:23:43.674]  That's how real he is.
[01:23:43.674 --> 01:23:47.375]  Dr. Steve Pachanik, and you got some heat for this, this is kind of changing the subject a little bit.
[01:23:47.375 --> 01:23:49.715]  Dr. Steve Pachanik, on your show, said...
[01:23:51.576 --> 01:23:55.697]  That no kids died at Sandy Hook.
[01:23:55.697 --> 01:24:00.959]  That it was a Homeland Security drill that they passed off as a real attack.
[01:24:00.959 --> 01:24:02.899]  He says that, and I've been hit really hard with it.
[01:24:02.899 --> 01:24:04.279]  I can't prove it one way or the other.
[01:24:04.279 --> 01:24:07.560]  I know Anderson Cooper standing up there and turns and his whole nose disappears.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.881]  I work in TV.
[01:24:08.881 --> 01:24:09.901]  I know what a blue screen is, bro.
[01:24:10.521 --> 01:24:12.924]  Yeah, and I have one question about Sandy Hook.
[01:24:12.924 --> 01:24:18.830]  The one question, the Tower 7 questions, why weren't the MEDEVAC helicopter called?
[01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:22.695]  Kucinich ran the operation to overthrow at least seven countries.
[01:24:23.919 --> 01:24:25.019]  I mean, that's on record.
[01:24:25.019 --> 01:24:25.540]  Yeah.
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:27.180]  He co-wrote Tom Clancy's books.
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:30.241]  He's the Jack Ryan character.
[01:24:30.241 --> 01:24:30.981]  Yeah.
[01:24:30.981 --> 01:24:33.302]  That's because he used to be in Cobra Action himself.
[01:24:33.302 --> 01:24:35.503]  That's how he got into the CIA.
[01:24:35.503 --> 01:24:37.583]  Here's the big secret about the CIA.
[01:24:37.583 --> 01:24:43.645]  They've got hitmen that are like former special forces and stuff that are Army, Navy, Marine Corps.
[01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:51.368]  You graduate out of the SEALs and out of things into basically squads that are put in strategic locations around the country.
[01:24:51.368 --> 01:24:51.868]  Sleeper cells.
[01:24:53.945 --> 01:25:00.228]  And so, that's basically what goes on, but who they really have for assassins are doctors and psychiatrists.
[01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:10.432]  And so, a lot of these people you see that are doctors and psychiatrists and things that head up things that were all in the Navy or in the Army, they were all put through secret programs and a bunch of other stuff, and they're the real hitmen.
[01:25:10.432 --> 01:25:16.835]  And there's some weird thing in the government where it's a medical procedure we're doing, like torture's all a medical procedure.
[01:25:16.835 --> 01:25:18.355]  It's this thing with doctors.
[01:25:18.355 --> 01:25:20.856]  So, if they send real hitmen after you, it's guys with medical degrees.
[01:25:20.856 --> 01:25:22.137]  Isn't that crazy?
[01:25:25.076 --> 01:25:26.721]  It's all very professionally done though, you understand?
[01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:28.787]  You mentioned Anderson Cooper.
[01:25:28.787 --> 01:25:31.816]  People think he's... He was in the CIA, right?
[01:25:31.816 --> 01:25:31.957]  Yes.
[01:25:32.699 --> 01:25:37.942]  And wasn't Operation Mockingbird a CIA operation to infiltrate the media?
[01:25:37.942 --> 01:25:38.522]  Yes.
[01:25:38.522 --> 01:25:40.564]  And Anderson Cooper was in the CIA, right?
[01:25:40.564 --> 01:25:42.865]  I saw articles saying he's not, but he admittedly was.
[01:25:42.865 --> 01:25:49.409]  And then they go, there's articles saying that no Muslims ever did a terror attack, and that no such thing as Muslim extremism exists.
[01:25:49.409 --> 01:25:51.550]  I saw CNN say that last night.
[01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:52.891]  The Pope says it.
[01:25:52.891 --> 01:25:55.212]  Again, they're at war with reality, Eddie.
[01:25:55.212 --> 01:25:56.433]  I mean, is there ever Islamic terror?
[01:25:57.837 --> 01:26:04.241]  Um, isn't it funded by... Exactly, but the point is, is there ever Islamists that blow stuff up?
[01:26:04.241 --> 01:26:04.441]  Yes.
[01:26:04.441 --> 01:26:05.642]  Okay.
[01:26:05.642 --> 01:26:07.143]  I mean, they say there isn't.
[01:26:07.143 --> 01:26:07.983]  It's this mind game.
[01:26:07.983 --> 01:26:09.864]  They're going, Trump is crazy.
[01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:11.585]  He says there's Islamic terror.
[01:26:11.585 --> 01:26:12.726]  It doesn't exist.
[01:26:12.726 --> 01:26:14.407]  What the hell are they talking about?
[01:26:14.407 --> 01:26:15.388]  So they play these games.
[01:26:17.273 --> 01:26:30.695]  That's a weird one, because, I mean, didn't the Pentagon just get busted for spending, paying $500 million to some UK PR firm for fake ISIS videos?
[01:26:30.695 --> 01:26:31.355]  Yes.
[01:26:31.355 --> 01:26:32.236]  Right?
[01:26:32.236 --> 01:26:33.516]  Oh, definitely!
[01:26:33.516 --> 01:26:39.377]  Islam has been scapegoated and set up and radicalized, but now the radical attack's real.
[01:26:39.377 --> 01:26:41.837]  Our government, the criminal elements, have funded radical Islam.
[01:26:41.837 --> 01:26:45.578]  First to fight the Soviets, but then since then, to actually create this giant war.
[01:26:46.198 --> 01:26:48.039]  So I don't want to kill Muslims.
[01:26:48.039 --> 01:26:53.080]  The point is that we can't bring in people from Yemen, and everybody knows you can't go to Somalia.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:53.340]  Yeah.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:54.421]  I mean, it's a failed state.
[01:26:54.421 --> 01:26:56.081]  Women literally are sold into slavery.
[01:26:56.081 --> 01:26:58.622]  We're going to unvetted bring people in from Somalia, like 50,000 a year?
[01:26:58.622 --> 01:27:00.183]  You think that's a good idea?
[01:27:00.183 --> 01:27:01.803]  No, absolutely not.
[01:27:01.803 --> 01:27:02.323]  Exactly.
[01:27:02.323 --> 01:27:08.485]  So there it is, Pentagon paid PR firm 540 million to make fake terrorist videos.
[01:27:08.485 --> 01:27:09.426]  Isn't that incredible?
[01:27:10.347 --> 01:27:13.950]  Isn't that $450 million?
[01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:15.531]  Or what was that?
[01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:19.033]  $540 million to make fake terrorist videos?
[01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:20.434]  Oh, that misread it, sorry.
[01:27:20.434 --> 01:27:22.735]  Jesus Christ, like what?
[01:27:22.735 --> 01:27:26.478]  So you can't believe anything that you see when it comes to ISIS?
[01:27:26.478 --> 01:27:29.340]  By the way, Eddie, I knew they'd done that before with a separate case.
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:30.921]  I didn't even know about that article.
[01:27:30.921 --> 01:27:32.262]  That's from RT.
[01:27:32.262 --> 01:27:33.903]  Isn't that crazy?
[01:27:33.903 --> 01:27:36.645]  Eddie, why don't you do a question everything show?
[01:27:36.645 --> 01:27:37.646]  It's not a conspiracy.
[01:27:37.646 --> 01:27:38.666]  We're just questioning stuff.
[01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:39.267]  Why don't you do a show?
[01:27:39.767 --> 01:27:41.109]  I'll come out here once a month.
[01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:41.930]  How about we do it here?
[01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:44.813]  Yeah, but you're too... Eddie is the real deal.
[01:27:44.813 --> 01:27:51.380]  I mean, he's one of the toughest guys out there, and he's just so, so calm and so nice, unless you give him a bottle of whiskey.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:54.203]  Yeah, keep the whiskey away from me.
[01:27:54.203 --> 01:27:57.868]  I mean, dude, I get pretty bad.
[01:27:57.868 --> 01:27:58.869]  Admit that was food coloring.
[01:27:58.869 --> 01:27:59.690]  It was brown food coloring.
[01:28:02.213 --> 01:28:03.915]  We couldn't be drinking like three shots at a time.
[01:28:03.915 --> 01:28:05.518]  That was not real.
[01:28:05.518 --> 01:28:09.323]  I mean, isn't it crazy that's the biggest podcast of all time?
[01:28:10.197 --> 01:28:11.278]  And that they won't list it.
[01:28:11.278 --> 01:28:13.138]  Joe, you know... They still won't list it.
[01:28:13.138 --> 01:28:17.700]  He sent me text shots of the... It's the biggest thing in iTunes history, bar none.
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.061]  The biggest thing in iTunes history.
[01:28:19.061 --> 01:28:19.901]  Biggest thing.
[01:28:19.901 --> 01:28:21.662]  All added together, it's like 40 million views.
[01:28:21.662 --> 01:28:26.224]  There are a few podcasts that are like 10 minutes long that are bigger, but Joe's in the top three.
[01:28:26.224 --> 01:28:31.106]  He has like a three-hour show, four-hour show, it varies for those that don't know.
[01:28:31.106 --> 01:28:34.568]  He said, hands down, the biggest podcast in history.
[01:28:34.568 --> 01:28:37.129]  It has like 60% of the viewers of the Super Bowl.
[01:28:38.291 --> 01:28:41.234]  And they will not list it at the top.
[01:28:41.234 --> 01:28:43.156]  So the Super Bowl was like $110 million?
[01:28:43.156 --> 01:28:43.736]  Yeah.
[01:28:43.736 --> 01:28:45.618]  And Joe's podcast was like $40?
[01:28:45.618 --> 01:28:47.740]  It's $40 on just a couple of platforms, a bunch of others.
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.802]  Derivatives, it's probably like $70 million.
[01:28:49.802 --> 01:28:51.204]  That's incredible.
[01:28:51.204 --> 01:28:52.385]  And they won't let you see it.
[01:28:52.385 --> 01:28:53.426]  That's like a bad Super Bowl.
[01:28:55.202 --> 01:28:57.123]  Well, I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:28:57.123 --> 01:28:58.824]  But listen, I'm going to get into all this other stuff.
[01:28:58.824 --> 01:29:00.485]  Go, because you're too humble.
[01:29:00.485 --> 01:29:02.166]  They've got to see the wild Eddie Bravo.
[01:29:02.166 --> 01:29:04.688]  It goes from absolutely ridiculous to absolute genius.
[01:29:04.688 --> 01:29:05.768]  Go do an hour interview.
[01:29:05.768 --> 01:29:10.551]  I know you've got to catch your plane with one of the great reporters back there so we can actually hear Eddie Bravo unshamed.
[01:29:10.551 --> 01:29:11.952]  But let's go out if we have it.
[01:29:11.952 --> 01:29:13.413]  I mentioned the CIA guy.
[01:29:13.413 --> 01:29:14.133]  I'll come back with that.
[01:29:14.133 --> 01:29:14.814]  Eddie's got to go.
[01:29:14.814 --> 01:29:17.115]  And we're also going to play that Joe Rogan kick since I mentioned it.
[01:29:17.115 --> 01:29:19.836]  Let's go out to break if we have time with the Joe Rogan kick.
[01:29:19.836 --> 01:29:21.117]  What's this kick called?
[01:29:21.117 --> 01:29:21.878]  A turning side kick.
[01:29:22.498 --> 01:29:26.240]  And he's, again, he's teaching GSP, one of the greatest fighters of all time.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:29.782]  Joe will be texting me, he'll be like, I didn't kick a pylon, it was another guy's leg.
[01:29:29.782 --> 01:29:34.885]  I saw the video where Joe keeps kicking, kicking, until the guy quits, and then blood is just pumping out of Joe's leg.
[01:29:34.885 --> 01:29:36.105]  I've never seen that one.
[01:29:36.105 --> 01:29:39.107]  I've seen it, it was like 10 years ago, I know I saw it.
[01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:42.408]  And if Joe says it's not true, he's senile, I'm not going to retract that one.
[01:29:42.408 --> 01:29:45.930]  Alright, Joe's awesome, look at him right here.
[01:29:45.930 --> 01:29:46.831]  Joe's like a gorilla.
[01:29:46.831 --> 01:29:48.832]  Of course, I'm like one too, but not as flexible.
[01:29:49.471 --> 01:29:52.473]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.473 --> 01:30:00.198]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.198 --> 01:30:12.067]  A previously debunked claim alleging then-candidate Donald Trump ran a secret server to communicate with Russia during the 2016 presidential race has resurfaced.
[01:30:12.067 --> 01:30:15.469]  The establishment mainstream media is now rehashing this
[01:30:15.469 --> 01:30:15.589]  Yeah.
[01:30:33.718 --> 01:30:34.298]  We're good.
[01:30:59.898 --> 01:31:01.779]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:31:01.779 --> 01:31:03.819]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:31:03.819 --> 01:31:06.721]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:31:06.721 --> 01:31:12.783]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:31:12.783 --> 01:31:21.966]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:31:21.966 --> 01:31:26.828]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.

[01:31:29.511 --> 01:31:37.540]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:38.502]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:43.643]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:43.643 --> 01:31:47.225]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:47.225 --> 01:31:53.950]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[01:33:16.193 --> 01:33:18.595]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.595 --> 01:33:37.690]  Restoring the Republic.
[01:33:37.690 --> 01:33:41.333]  A pro-human planet built on shared destiny.
[01:33:42.441 --> 01:33:46.343]  As we build an elevator to the stars.
[01:33:46.343 --> 01:33:51.926]  Dr. Group's with us well into the next hour because I want him to really stay with us and get to all this news.
[01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:53.407]  There's a lot of news I haven't got to yet.
[01:33:53.407 --> 01:34:03.713]  I want to hit the big spy news, the economy news first, and then I want to get into some health news, some news dealing with fungus and dealing with
[01:34:05.802 --> 01:34:11.324]  Yeast and things like that, that is one of the most important things out there that people can actually do for themselves.
[01:34:11.324 --> 01:34:13.866]  This is so massive, I don't have words to describe it.
[01:34:13.866 --> 01:34:17.327]  And notice, everything we do is game-changing.
[01:34:17.327 --> 01:34:21.309]  Whatever the enemy knows that they don't want you to know, we're here to bring it out.
[01:34:21.309 --> 01:34:23.170]  Now, since I brought that up, let's get to this right now.
[01:34:23.170 --> 01:34:23.890]  It's here in my stack.
[01:34:23.890 --> 01:34:25.751]  I'm just going to go through the stacks until I find it.
[01:34:25.751 --> 01:34:28.272]  Because during the break, I was trying to find it, because you were coming in here to the studio.
[01:34:28.272 --> 01:34:28.812]  It was Eddie Bravo.
[01:34:28.812 --> 01:34:32.894]  I was leaving, going to be interviewing for the Nightly News by Leon McAdoo.
[01:34:32.894 --> 01:34:34.435]  And I was sitting here going over all this.
[01:34:35.945 --> 01:34:46.801]  Zuckerberg of Facebook is in trade publications, PC World, Bloomberg, you name it, saying, I've completed the censorship in the U.S.
[01:34:46.801 --> 01:34:48.203]  and perfected it.
[01:34:48.203 --> 01:34:50.706]  I'm ready to enter the Chinese communist market.
[01:34:50.706 --> 01:34:51.908]  So he's proving himself.
[01:34:53.254 --> 01:35:02.521]  Like a whore shaking her ass or something in a brothel, in front of the biggest mass murderers in history, the Communist Chinese, that he's censored the American people.
[01:35:02.521 --> 01:35:03.361]  And guess who he censored?
[01:35:03.361 --> 01:35:09.866]  They announced on Sunday, USA Today, that they're going to block questionable news or notify people that go to it.
[01:35:09.866 --> 01:35:14.069]  No, they're just banning Rand Paul's interview on Infowars.com yesterday, Senator Paul.
[01:35:14.069 --> 01:35:22.135]  They're banning the CIA analyst on national TV saying, because they didn't like it getting out, that his colleagues in the CIA said, because he was a section chief,
[01:35:22.555 --> 01:35:27.259]  Over intelligence gathering and analysis.
[01:35:27.259 --> 01:35:30.421]  They just block that and just delete it.
[01:35:30.421 --> 01:35:31.522]  I mean, this is huge.
[01:35:31.522 --> 01:35:38.006]  This isn't like I said, Ronald Reagan and Elvis just showed up in Vegas to play the craps table.
[01:35:38.006 --> 01:35:39.688]  They are censoring us.
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:44.203]  And they're censoring hardcore news that backs up the president.
[01:35:44.203 --> 01:35:48.787]  I mean, it's all over Fox, CNN, Bloomberg, they're all saying, impeach the president.
[01:35:48.787 --> 01:35:51.570]  How dare him claim they're unauthorized wiretaps!
[01:35:51.570 --> 01:35:55.293]  Because we don't call them those, we call them digital intercepts.
[01:35:55.293 --> 01:35:57.255]  They're playing these games, okay?
[01:35:57.255 --> 01:36:00.358]  A wiretap's going into your actual phone line and doing it.
[01:36:00.358 --> 01:36:06.724]  And so, Dr. Griff, I want to get into some of this news and get into your big findings here, and it's just amazing info.
[01:36:08.103 --> 01:36:20.556]  This has reached crazy level now, where Trump is, they're in the news a month ago saying, we grabbed his intercepts, he talked to the Russians, and they admit nothing was said substantive, just that meetings were being set up, which an incoming president does.
[01:36:22.432 --> 01:36:25.553]  And they flip it around and go, we never said we were listening to Trump.
[01:36:25.553 --> 01:36:28.094]  I mean, it's like, where's the attention span?
[01:36:28.094 --> 01:36:34.256]  And then Vault 7, CNN, as of this morning, I haven't been following it since then, was yet to cover Vault 7.
[01:36:34.256 --> 01:36:39.677]  The biggest data dump ever confirming they're doing fake Russian attacks to blame Trump.
[01:36:39.677 --> 01:36:41.798]  They're blackmailing Congress.
[01:36:41.798 --> 01:36:46.280]  They're wiretapping or digital intercepting everybody.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:48.180]  They're turning the cameras on in your house.
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:50.561]  Big corporations are doing it to gather data on you.
[01:36:51.081 --> 01:36:53.742]  Well, yeah, they said so in press releases.
[01:36:53.742 --> 01:36:54.422]  I'd love to take that.
[01:36:54.422 --> 01:36:58.023]  All of it is like, I guess Alex Jones is feeling pretty good right now.
[01:36:58.023 --> 01:37:00.544]  That's been all over the news.
[01:37:00.544 --> 01:37:02.424]  Yeah, Jones believes in Bigfoot.
[01:37:02.424 --> 01:37:03.184]  No, I don't.
[01:37:03.184 --> 01:37:05.125]  But he got proven right on this.
[01:37:05.125 --> 01:37:06.625]  Again, what are they going to do?
[01:37:06.625 --> 01:37:11.087]  This is such an epic moment right now as everything we talked about comes out.
[01:37:11.087 --> 01:37:14.227]  Here's the deal.
[01:37:14.227 --> 01:37:19.369]  There have been more than 5,000 arrests of reported pedophiles, hundreds of children in slavery.
[01:37:20.191 --> 01:37:21.051]  Rescued.
[01:37:21.051 --> 01:37:28.293]  And it'll be reported once in the local news and nowhere, and it's Trump behind it all, saying, I'll cover law enforcement who's been threatened if you do this.
[01:37:28.293 --> 01:37:33.914]  The guy is an angel.
[01:37:33.914 --> 01:37:36.995]  But I'll say this, until one thing.
[01:37:36.995 --> 01:37:41.236]  This new bill that Rand Paul came on and talked about yesterday has some real problems.
[01:37:41.236 --> 01:37:42.476]  I'm going to go over those.
[01:37:42.476 --> 01:37:45.036]  And I know Trump said, this is just for debate.
[01:37:45.036 --> 01:37:46.277]  We'll see where it goes.
[01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:47.057]  I want to repeal.
[01:37:47.057 --> 01:37:47.717]  Let's get it going.
[01:37:48.609 --> 01:37:53.116]  This is what the Republican leadership brought out, so this isn't Trump.
[01:37:53.116 --> 01:37:55.059]  Though he's trying to be positive.
[01:37:55.059 --> 01:38:00.006]  But this is the first time I've seen Trump not 100% deliver on what he said he'd do.
[01:38:00.006 --> 01:38:03.191]  And if he starts going sideways on this, I'll cover it.
[01:38:03.191 --> 01:38:04.072]  But Dr. Groob...
[01:38:04.977 --> 01:38:11.023]  You're an army veteran yourself, special operations have been involved, a lot of special task force, you name it, you've seen where all this is going.
[01:38:11.023 --> 01:38:27.338]  I never made the government our enemy, it was criminal elements of that government, but I gotta say, the MVPs, the patriots, the people that are leaking this, the CIA's our biggest enemy, our best friend, the people at the top of it are globalists, but it's the CIA that released false seven, they're admitting that now.
[01:38:27.338 --> 01:38:29.640]  So there's a civil war in America, what do you make of all this?
[01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:31.810]  It's crazy.
[01:38:31.810 --> 01:38:49.665]  It's a war that's going on right now and everything was so deeply ingrained with DARPA and with Planned Parenthood and with all the control and the geoengineering and all the chemicals and toxins and the support of Monsanto and the chemical companies that are destroying the Earth's air.
[01:38:49.665 --> 01:38:51.167]  It was a biological conspiracy against us.
[01:38:51.167 --> 01:38:54.149]  Yeah, I mean if you look at all of the details that have been ingrained
[01:38:55.006 --> 01:38:56.727]  With the parties.
[01:38:56.727 --> 01:38:57.888]  It's not just Democrats.
[01:38:57.888 --> 01:38:59.669]  Your dad developed this feeling in me.
[01:38:59.669 --> 01:39:01.310]  He spoke out and suddenly died.
[01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.931]  That's right.
[01:39:01.931 --> 01:39:03.492]  You had the men in black come to your house.
[01:39:03.492 --> 01:39:04.032]  I did.
[01:39:04.032 --> 01:39:04.593]  Yes I did.
[01:39:04.593 --> 01:39:15.160]  I was actually thrown in a black car and I went through all that and even when we were working doing cancer research and we were coming up with extremely good results.
[01:39:16.528 --> 01:39:22.735]  FDA raided my office, basically said I can't, you know, took all my files, basically said we can't share this information with anybody.
[01:39:22.735 --> 01:39:32.225]  It's the disruption that Trump is bringing into a controlled organization that's been controlled and manipulated for hundreds of years.
[01:39:32.225 --> 01:39:36.190]  And now you're starting to see some of these things being addressed.
[01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:36.950]  I mean, hopefully
[01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:41.475]  You know, the control of the population is what it all comes down to.
[01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:43.236]  The good guys are striking back.
[01:39:43.236 --> 01:39:46.399]  Empire Strikes Back, the good guys are striking back right now.
[01:39:46.399 --> 01:39:48.401]  You've been striking back since you got out of the Army.
[01:39:48.401 --> 01:39:49.522]  I've been striking back.
[01:39:49.522 --> 01:39:51.444]  We're all striking back and we're starting to win.
[01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:53.806]  That's a good feeling.
[01:39:53.806 --> 01:39:55.588]  But you're starting to see everything kind of...
[01:39:57.848 --> 01:40:02.551]  Start blooming now with everything that's going on and all the exposure.
[01:40:02.551 --> 01:40:05.734]  I mean, we've known about all the pedophilia stuff for a long time.
[01:40:05.734 --> 01:40:08.496]  We've known about that traces back to the MKUltra.
[01:40:08.496 --> 01:40:10.917]  We know about putting fluoride in the water traces back.
[01:40:10.917 --> 01:40:16.501]  We had all of the research that I've done on bioweapons and that have been used on the American public.
[01:40:16.501 --> 01:40:17.702]  And people ask, where?
[01:40:17.702 --> 01:40:20.664]  Oh, like the outgoing White House Science Czar, John B. Holdren.
[01:40:20.664 --> 01:40:23.286]  You know, he wrote a book 43 years ago, admitting the whole plan.
[01:40:23.866 --> 01:40:29.633]  Yeah, the thing is, I just have a hard time understanding why people just don't go do their own research.
[01:40:29.633 --> 01:40:31.735]  It's like... Yeah, we did our own.
[01:40:31.735 --> 01:40:37.422]  They admitted 12 years ago the cameras on your computer were watching you in press releases by Google to shareholders.
[01:40:37.422 --> 01:40:39.905]  It's not like... And then now it's all admitted.
[01:40:40.686 --> 01:40:41.106]  Right.
[01:40:41.106 --> 01:40:42.568]  Now it's all admitted.
[01:40:42.568 --> 01:41:03.289]  And you know, the whole vaccine agenda, the Plum Island, you know, the testing of biological warfare on Plum Island, all of this, whether it's a fungus, whether it's a virus, a bioweapons that were used in Iraq, that were sprayed in California with Operation Sea Spray, where they sprayed a bunch of biological weapons all over the
[01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:08.315]  In San Francisco, they tested biological weapons in New York.
[01:41:08.315 --> 01:41:11.900]  They put in hepatitis shots for gay men in New York, the AIDS virus.
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:14.664]  And you can actually pull this stuff up on Wikipedia now!
[01:41:14.664 --> 01:41:18.670]  It's not like we're sitting here saying, you know, this stuff happened.
[01:41:19.691 --> 01:41:27.494]  Yes, I've got stacks and stacks of research just like you do and all of this stuff is, it's almost out there, it is out there for public knowledge.
[01:41:27.494 --> 01:41:30.295]  It's not like I'm getting... 90% of it's public.
[01:41:30.295 --> 01:41:31.396]  Yeah, 90% of it.
[01:41:31.396 --> 01:41:32.756]  That's what's crazy is it's in U.S.
[01:41:32.756 --> 01:41:42.820]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subjection 1528, Paragraph B, that, oh, it's illegal to test on people secretly unless it's for law enforcement or research purposes.
[01:41:43.783 --> 01:41:46.406]  And then that's how they take foster kids and radiate them.
[01:41:46.406 --> 01:41:49.048]  And they're not radiating kids because they don't know what radiation does.
[01:41:49.048 --> 01:41:57.837]  They're testing people that are being compromised, like the Milgram experiment, to follow orders to then run giant criminal operations.
[01:41:57.837 --> 01:42:04.183]  Just like they get people to molest kids to be part of the group, or people to kill people to be part of the group, they're testing to see what you'll do.
[01:42:05.003 --> 01:42:15.947]  And the thing is, all of the different things that they're using, whether it's fluoride or whatever, whatever, all of these things usually don't show symptoms for three to six months.
[01:42:15.947 --> 01:42:21.590]  It's like what I'm going to be talking about today, which is the fungus epidemic, the hidden fungus epidemic in yeast and mold.
[01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:23.570]  By the way, it's not just you.
[01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:26.632]  It's in all the medical literature, mainline doctors I've talked to.
[01:42:26.632 --> 01:42:32.334]  I know three people the last year who've had brain surgeries or their kids or their wives have, three people.
[01:42:33.906 --> 01:42:38.510]  Because fungus is getting through the blood-brain barrier and growing in the brain now.
[01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:41.032]  I mean, what the hell is that?
[01:42:41.032 --> 01:42:45.856]  What the hell is that is that fungus is one of those things that loves sugar.
[01:42:45.856 --> 01:42:50.220]  And we live in a society which, again, some people say that high fructose corn syrup
[01:42:51.277 --> 01:42:53.838]  You know, was an attack on the population.
[01:42:53.838 --> 01:42:54.878]  And it was developed that way.
[01:42:54.878 --> 01:42:57.239]  It's got traces of mercury in it as well.
[01:42:57.239 --> 01:42:58.399]  But when you add... Not traces.
[01:42:58.399 --> 01:43:06.602]  I have a Washington Post admit 90% of soft drinks have illegal levels of lead and mercury.
[01:43:06.602 --> 01:43:07.982]  You can Google that.
[01:43:07.982 --> 01:43:10.303]  Type in soft drinks, high levels of lead and mercury, guys.
[01:43:10.303 --> 01:43:10.903]  I want to show folks.
[01:43:10.903 --> 01:43:11.443]  Go ahead.
[01:43:11.443 --> 01:43:13.084]  When you contaminate the soil,
[01:43:14.164 --> 01:43:18.967]  When you contaminate, you know, the soil is contaminated because it's watered.
[01:43:18.967 --> 01:43:27.671]  Think about ages ago, where the ancient people would take water from the local river and irrigate their fields.
[01:43:27.671 --> 01:43:32.834]  And that water, because there were fish in the water, the fish were going to the bathroom, so there was probiotics in there.
[01:43:32.834 --> 01:43:35.695]  And that's how you got the soil-based microorganisms.
[01:43:35.695 --> 01:43:38.076]  That's how the soil was living.
[01:43:38.076 --> 01:43:39.257]  You got inoculated from the earth.
[01:43:39.497 --> 01:43:40.478]  Just like the earth.
[01:43:40.478 --> 01:43:49.568]  So if you look at the earth and you look at our digestive tract, it's almost exactly the same because our intestinal lining is almost like the soil and the soil of the earth that grows out of it.
[01:43:49.568 --> 01:43:54.614]  So our gut is linked to every single system in our body and keeps our bodies healthy.
[01:43:55.134 --> 01:44:11.543]  So does the earth's soil and the water supply is supposed to keep everything healthy, but we've cut down all kinds of trees, we've poisoned the water, we've poisoned the soil, and that water, that acid rain that comes down on the soil, and we've been watering our soil and spraying the plants with heavy doses of atrazine and glyphosate and all that.
[01:44:11.543 --> 01:44:12.684]  So we've got solutions.
[01:44:13.044 --> 01:44:14.345]  Yeah, I want to get to this next hour.
[01:44:14.345 --> 01:44:15.506]  We've got 15 minutes till the interview.
[01:44:15.506 --> 01:44:16.686]  It's the whole next hour.
[01:44:16.686 --> 01:44:18.748]  This is undoubtedly, because I've already been researching this.
[01:44:18.748 --> 01:44:20.289]  You've been obsessed with this for years.
[01:44:20.289 --> 01:44:23.771]  You finally have something that really counters this in a big way.
[01:44:23.771 --> 01:44:26.633]  And of course, no one here at the office has been taking the probiotics.
[01:44:28.015 --> 01:44:28.295]  Let's do it!
[01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:45.532]  Mico ZX.
[01:44:45.532 --> 01:44:46.093]  Yes.
[01:44:46.093 --> 01:44:48.014]  Let's briefly talk about Mico ZX.
[01:44:48.014 --> 01:44:53.698]  In the next hour, we'll actually get into the news and the big stack of stuff you've got, but it's available at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:44:53.698 --> 01:44:56.499]  10% off when you get it with Biome Defense.
[01:44:56.499 --> 01:44:58.581]  The probiotic is the very best out there.
[01:44:58.581 --> 01:44:59.661]  We also have free shipping.
[01:44:59.661 --> 01:45:02.823]  Orders $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:45:02.823 --> 01:45:09.648]  Additionally, on top of that, I mean, you fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your family absolutely need, but
[01:45:10.748 --> 01:45:12.729]  You should consult your health care provider.
[01:45:12.729 --> 01:45:13.510]  This is not a game.
[01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:14.150]  This is not a joke.
[01:45:14.150 --> 01:45:17.772]  Especially if you have really big yeast levels or fungus in your body.
[01:45:17.772 --> 01:45:21.054]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing.
[01:45:21.054 --> 01:45:23.336]  But why is this product so powerful?
[01:45:23.336 --> 01:45:24.717]  What does it do?
[01:45:24.717 --> 01:45:28.879]  So we've been doing research just like you have on what's currently going on.
[01:45:28.879 --> 01:45:36.864]  Obviously we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... No, we want stuff for our own kids.
[01:45:36.864 --> 01:45:39.446]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed
[01:45:40.205 --> 01:45:48.057]  The president, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[01:45:48.057 --> 01:45:50.982]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[01:45:50.982 --> 01:45:52.745]  Funguses were used as bioweapons.
[01:45:52.745 --> 01:45:55.248]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[01:45:56.141 --> 01:46:00.705]  Number one, because our immune systems are suppressed because of the environment in which we live.
[01:46:00.705 --> 01:46:03.207]  So our gut is unhealthy, our liver is toxic.
[01:46:03.207 --> 01:46:10.153]  Yeah, but why are bats all over the US, why are funguses suddenly killing entire, you know, 10 million bats in one cave?
[01:46:10.153 --> 01:46:11.494]  I mean, suddenly just devastating.
[01:46:12.034 --> 01:46:15.496]  Well, because the bats' environment is changing as well.
[01:46:15.496 --> 01:46:18.538]  It's not like just we change, the whole Earth changes.
[01:46:18.538 --> 01:46:28.523]  When the Earth, when the environment becomes an environment that's detrimental to the Earth, it also becomes... That Google guy's mold and fungus killing bats.
[01:46:28.523 --> 01:46:29.804]  It's all over his white nose.
[01:46:29.884 --> 01:46:37.748]  Bats are also, there's more sugar out there too, and I'm sure that that has a lot to do with it, because the conversion and funguses are adapting and they're changing.
[01:46:37.748 --> 01:46:43.932]  As a matter of fact, there was a new fungus called Candida auris that was just released, which is a killer fungus as well.
[01:46:43.932 --> 01:46:47.674]  Fungus is something... And the fungus now reached the West Coast and killed 7 million bats in one year.
[01:46:48.234 --> 01:46:55.977]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[01:46:55.977 --> 01:47:04.780]  I've had nobody... Here's the thing Alex, when you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:08.342]  It's going to show, you're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[01:47:08.342 --> 01:47:13.005]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[01:47:13.005 --> 01:47:13.685]  Joint pain.
[01:47:13.685 --> 01:47:14.486]  It's joint pain.
[01:47:14.486 --> 01:47:15.746]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[01:47:15.746 --> 01:47:16.327]  Infertility.
[01:47:16.327 --> 01:47:17.768]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[01:47:17.768 --> 01:47:22.951]  I know they test people that are really obese and they're just colonized by fungus.
[01:47:22.951 --> 01:47:23.831]  Yeast overgrowth.
[01:47:23.831 --> 01:47:28.554]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[01:47:28.554 --> 01:47:33.177]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[01:47:34.257 --> 01:47:37.180]  By the way folks, look, I'm not bragging.
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:38.781]  We game-changed the presidency.
[01:47:38.781 --> 01:47:40.583]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[01:47:40.583 --> 01:47:42.284]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[01:47:42.284 --> 01:47:44.526]  You are the InfoWar.
[01:47:44.526 --> 01:47:47.008]  This is religious for me.
[01:47:47.008 --> 01:47:49.551]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe in it.
[01:47:50.481 --> 01:47:55.328]  And if we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[01:47:55.328 --> 01:47:56.449]  I want to defeat them.
[01:47:56.449 --> 01:47:59.193]  I'm ready to give my life, everybody knows that, against the enemy.
[01:47:59.193 --> 01:47:59.633]  Please!
[01:47:59.633 --> 01:48:02.377]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[01:48:02.377 --> 01:48:03.899]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:48:03.899 --> 01:48:04.800]  For me, it's been incredible.
[01:48:06.501 --> 01:48:08.442]  Don't take it on an empty stomach, though.
[01:48:08.442 --> 01:48:12.963]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[01:48:12.963 --> 01:48:13.803]  Get it today.
[01:48:13.803 --> 01:48:14.283]  Limited run.
[01:48:14.283 --> 01:48:15.684]  It'll be months till we get more.
[01:48:15.684 --> 01:48:20.365]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:48:20.365 --> 01:48:23.986]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[01:48:23.986 --> 01:48:28.007]  Just because, metaphysically, I mean, this is who I am.
[01:48:28.007 --> 01:48:30.128]  I'm not even that good of a person.
[01:48:30.128 --> 01:48:31.808]  I just metaphysically don't want to hurt people.
[01:48:31.808 --> 01:48:33.509]  I want to treat you like I want to be treated.
[01:48:33.509 --> 01:48:34.409]  Texas Hospitality.
[01:48:35.149 --> 01:48:37.610]  And I can't believe no one has put out something this good.
[01:48:37.610 --> 01:48:42.452]  This, just like other folks took probiotics, I said take probiotics, they didn't have the effect.
[01:48:42.452 --> 01:48:46.734]  They took the biome defense you developed over a decade, the very best strains, healed them!
[01:48:46.734 --> 01:48:50.856]  I mean, you know, horrible irritable bowel, horrible problems, gone in one month!
[01:48:50.856 --> 01:48:57.659]  I'm telling you, and for my research, correct me if I'm wrong, we haven't had this talk, is MycoZX is next level.
[01:48:57.659 --> 01:49:02.902]  Good bacteria will displace the fungus and the yeast, but isn't actually annihilating them the key?
[01:49:03.962 --> 01:49:05.444]  Or you said there's a healthy balance.
[01:49:05.444 --> 01:49:07.546]  I mean, this is next level.
[01:49:07.546 --> 01:49:16.955]  First of all, if anybody drinks alcohol out there, and if anybody eats sugar, then you're most likely going to have an excess of fungus in your body.
[01:49:16.955 --> 01:49:19.738]  And actually, yeast is a fungus and mold is a fungus.
[01:49:19.738 --> 01:49:20.619]  Most people don't know that.
[01:49:20.619 --> 01:49:21.439]  They think it's separate.
[01:49:21.439 --> 01:49:26.044]  So it all goes into the hidden attack and the hidden agenda of fungus.
[01:49:26.044 --> 01:49:27.906]  How is it suddenly growing in brains everywhere?
[01:49:29.008 --> 01:49:35.330]  Well, there's a lot of, there's actually studies coming out right now that show that funguses
[01:49:36.519 --> 01:49:40.921]  Can produce 600 times more neurotoxins.
[01:49:40.921 --> 01:49:42.162]  You're talking about the brain.
[01:49:42.162 --> 01:49:42.762]  Wow.
[01:49:42.762 --> 01:49:46.344]  Generated from a high EMF environment.
[01:49:46.344 --> 01:49:46.624]  Okay.
[01:49:46.624 --> 01:49:50.306]  So the electromagnetic, they're feeding off this.
[01:49:50.306 --> 01:49:51.446]  Electromagnetic radiation.
[01:49:51.446 --> 01:49:54.128]  Maybe they're a hive mind or something.
[01:49:54.128 --> 01:49:55.408]  Why does the attack seem so alien?
[01:49:55.408 --> 01:49:57.970]  Because I've never seen aliens.
[01:49:57.970 --> 01:50:01.391]  Everything the globalists do is like anti-human, kill us, annihilate us.
[01:50:01.391 --> 01:50:02.532]  So why are they out to get us?
[01:50:02.532 --> 01:50:04.053]  Is it just psychopathic inbreeding?
[01:50:04.053 --> 01:50:04.413]  What is it?
[01:50:05.572 --> 01:50:07.755]  It's really more or less a slow death.
[01:50:20.512 --> 01:50:26.839]  The ultimate power is slow death, increased money for the pharmaceuticals, being able to... It gets deeper than that, Alex.
[01:50:26.839 --> 01:50:36.870]  When you look at Morgellons, which is a fungal disease, people are having fibers growing out of their body, which is being traced back to
[01:50:37.711 --> 01:50:49.079]  Some of the compounds found in the chemtrails right now, which are prions, and they're showing that you can control these things through electromagnetic signals, just like what you're talking about.
[01:50:49.079 --> 01:50:49.760]  That's what they say.
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:50.681]  It's a binary weapon.
[01:50:50.681 --> 01:50:57.265]  They put it into us, then they're testing in labs, then they're testing on us, seeing how it resonates and controls it.
[01:50:57.265 --> 01:50:59.247]  They can put out a wavelength and activate it.
[01:50:59.247 --> 01:51:00.588]  The fungus grows, we all die.
[01:51:00.988 --> 01:51:01.589]  We get brain tumors.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:18.301]  Thank you so much.

[01:51:59.781 --> 01:52:05.387]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's, in an epic battle of David versus Goliath.
[01:52:05.387 --> 01:52:07.769]  In the early 1980s, a child was born.
[01:52:07.769 --> 01:52:08.730]  Two of them, actually.
[01:52:08.730 --> 01:52:10.792]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[01:52:10.792 --> 01:52:15.177]  Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened.
[01:52:15.177 --> 01:52:17.299]  Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors.
[01:52:17.779 --> 01:52:21.741]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[01:52:21.741 --> 01:52:30.707]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers.
[01:52:30.707 --> 01:52:33.048]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[01:52:33.048 --> 01:52:34.589]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[01:52:34.929 --> 01:52:35.889]  Don't worry.
[01:52:35.889 --> 01:52:41.452]  Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price.
[01:52:41.452 --> 01:52:42.852]  Try Harry's free.

[01:54:07.337 --> 01:54:11.021]  And then Trump says, I'm under surveillance when they're on the news surveilling him.
[01:54:11.021 --> 01:54:12.763]  They go, you're insane!
[01:54:12.763 --> 01:54:13.584]  We never did that.
[01:54:13.584 --> 01:54:16.487]  As if no one has a memory.
[01:54:16.487 --> 01:54:18.689]  We should have pointed this out on Monday, and now it's all over the news.
[01:54:18.689 --> 01:54:19.910]  They're like, yeah, here's the New York Times.
[01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:21.692]  I watched Fox News this morning.
[01:54:21.692 --> 01:54:23.694]  Yeah, they said they were surveilling the president.
[01:54:23.694 --> 01:54:24.856]  Yeah, I'm looking for it in my stack.
[01:54:25.930 --> 01:54:34.055]  We've got an article here where Zuckerberg is in the New York Times telling China, don't worry, I'm going to censor the internet, I've already tested it in the U.S.
[01:54:34.055 --> 01:54:38.538]  And then a USA Today article, there it is, Facebook made China censorship tool.
[01:54:38.538 --> 01:54:39.699]  There you go.
[01:54:39.699 --> 01:54:49.225]  And they're now using that in the U.S., Zuckerberg using Chinese-style censorship tool in America, and what are they blocking?
[01:54:49.225 --> 01:54:50.806]  Senator Rand Paul on the show.
[01:54:52.270 --> 01:54:54.291]  As a Senator, I want to have some hearings about that.
[01:54:54.291 --> 01:54:58.953]  That's what they blocked yesterday and took off our Facebook.
[01:54:58.953 --> 01:55:04.255]  And now, former CIA analyst Obama gave green light for NSA-CIA to sabotage.
[01:55:04.255 --> 01:55:09.057]  That's from Larry C. Johnson, CIA analyst section chief.
[01:55:09.057 --> 01:55:09.738]  Let's go ahead.
[01:55:09.738 --> 01:55:10.718]  That's from his sources.
[01:55:10.718 --> 01:55:14.660]  Let's go to what Zuckerberg doesn't want you to see this.
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:15.080]  Here it is.
[01:55:16.135 --> 01:55:27.077]  Both Jim Clapper and John Brennan at CIA were intimately involved in trying to derail the candidacy of Donald Trump.
[01:55:27.077 --> 01:55:33.319]  That there was some collusion overseas with Britain's own GHCQ.
[01:55:33.319 --> 01:55:38.640]  That information that was gathered from GHCQ was actually passed to John Brennan.
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:41.822]  And it was disseminated within the U.S.
[01:55:41.822 --> 01:55:42.183]  government.
[01:55:42.183 --> 01:55:44.645]  This dissemination was illegal.
[01:55:44.645 --> 01:56:03.202]  Donald Trump is in essence correct that the intelligence agencies and some in the law enforcement community on the side of the FBI were in fact illegally trying to access, monitor his communications with his aides and with other people.
[01:56:03.442 --> 01:56:03.982]  That's right.
[01:56:03.982 --> 01:56:08.725]  All of this with an end to trying to destroy and discredit his presidency.
[01:56:08.725 --> 01:56:10.506]  I don't think there will be any doubt of that.
[01:56:10.506 --> 01:56:22.793]  I think it's worth noting that the head of the National Security Agency, an Admiral Rogers, made a journey to Trump Tower shortly after Trump had won.
[01:56:22.793 --> 01:56:32.018]  And in the immediate aftermath of his visit, Jim Clapper and others in the intelligence community called for him to be fired.
[01:56:32.898 --> 01:56:36.181]  Now, why did Rogers go to Trump Tower?
[01:56:36.181 --> 01:56:48.131]  My understanding is, let's call it, it was to cover himself because he was aware that the NSA had been, the authorities had been misused and abused with respect to Donald Trump.
[01:56:48.131 --> 01:56:59.221]  So I think Trump's decision to go out this morning and tweet this was fully intended to send a notice and send word that I don't think he's doing this without evidence.
[01:56:59.221 --> 01:57:00.422]  He does have evidence.
[01:57:01.182 --> 01:57:03.865]  I think it was just inartfully expressed in the tweet.
[01:57:03.865 --> 01:57:05.387]  Alright.
[01:57:05.387 --> 01:57:10.072]  So, and you've got the head of the Intelligence Committee in the House saying the same thing.
[01:57:10.072 --> 01:57:12.354]  No Russian evidence, and they were spying on him.
[01:57:12.354 --> 01:57:16.679]  They've got a big problem, but they're so arrogant, Dr. Grip, we're going to break here in a moment.
[01:57:17.728 --> 01:57:18.609]  That they're doing all this.
[01:57:18.609 --> 01:57:24.537]  Meanwhile, this is out of the New York Post, FBI Chief Comey asserting power like no one in history.
[01:57:24.537 --> 01:57:27.441]  He's acting like he's the president, saying, it's outrageous!
[01:57:27.441 --> 01:57:29.003]  We don't wiretap anybody!
[01:57:29.003 --> 01:57:30.705]  Well, we know the FBI didn't do it.
[01:57:30.705 --> 01:57:31.687]  He didn't accuse the FBI.
[01:57:32.748 --> 01:57:34.289]  So Comey is a piece of work.
[01:57:34.289 --> 01:57:38.910]  I mean, just because he's like nine feet tall doesn't mean he's allowed to act like this, man.
[01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:40.531]  God, just let us have prosperity, man.
[01:57:40.531 --> 01:57:41.911]  What the hell is your problem, Dr. Group?
[01:57:41.911 --> 01:57:45.052]  Yeah, just stop the attacks and everything.
[01:57:45.052 --> 01:57:48.653]  I mean, let's just move on and let's just start moving.
[01:57:48.653 --> 01:57:50.254]  Get off the president's back, jerk!
[01:57:50.254 --> 01:57:51.714]  He's supporting you, dumbass!
[01:57:51.714 --> 01:57:53.655]  In a positive manner, you know, listen.
[01:57:54.475 --> 01:58:00.897]  I reached out to the Obama administration, the Bush administration to try to help them with health care, address the root cause of the problem.
[01:58:00.897 --> 01:58:03.898]  What do you make of Trump coming out against vaccines?
[01:58:03.898 --> 01:58:16.961]  And listen, I don't remember anybody, regardless who was in office, that was out there in masks, you know, hurting people and trying to go a million miles an hour and to attack, attack, attack.
[01:58:16.961 --> 01:58:18.562]  The Democrats are now a violent group.
[01:58:18.562 --> 01:58:19.042]  What's happened?
[01:58:19.042 --> 01:58:21.002]  Like seriously violent.
[01:58:21.002 --> 01:58:22.483]  This is like this crazed.
[01:58:23.385 --> 01:58:25.347]  I mean, they all need to cleanse.
[01:58:25.347 --> 01:58:27.669]  I mean, they all need some serious spiritual work.
[01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:28.890]  Have you noticed how unhealthy they look?
[01:58:28.890 --> 01:58:30.891]  I want to show the zombie video with Paul Watson.
[01:58:30.891 --> 01:58:31.232]  Like Pelosi.
[01:58:31.232 --> 01:58:33.033]  I mean, she's like can't even get her words together.
[01:58:33.033 --> 01:58:33.834]  She's like slurring her words.
[01:58:33.834 --> 01:58:34.374]  Let's talk about that.
[01:58:34.374 --> 01:58:36.996]  I want to show the start of Paul Watson's report when we come back.
[01:58:36.996 --> 01:58:38.658]  You just saw what they don't want you to see.
[01:58:38.658 --> 01:58:45.183]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.183 --> 01:58:47.245]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.052 --> 01:58:54.235]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[01:58:54.235 --> 01:58:57.016]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[01:58:57.016 --> 01:58:58.557]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[01:58:58.557 --> 01:59:02.759]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:59:02.759 --> 01:59:06.181]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collected.
[01:59:06.181 --> 01:59:08.243]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:59:08.243 --> 01:59:09.803]  It's gonna be coming after your gun.
[01:59:09.803 --> 01:59:10.524]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:10.524 --> 01:59:12.345]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[01:59:12.345 --> 01:59:12.965]  At all.
[01:59:12.965 --> 01:59:14.026]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:59:14.026 --> 01:59:16.427]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:59:16.427 --> 01:59:17.128]  They lost.
[01:59:17.728 --> 01:59:20.770]  I want to see what Trump's up against.
[01:59:20.770 --> 01:59:21.911]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:59:21.911 --> 01:59:23.812]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[01:59:23.812 --> 01:59:29.876]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[01:59:29.876 --> 01:59:32.238]  And beef was for supper.
[01:59:32.238 --> 01:59:34.720]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.501]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:59:36.501 --> 01:59:38.202]  DVDs now available.
[01:59:38.202 --> 01:59:42.505]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:59:42.905 --> 01:59:45.889]  You wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[02:00:08.928 --> 02:00:16.930]  From deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:16.930 --> 02:00:18.611]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:20.291]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:20.291 --> 02:00:25.873]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.873 --> 02:00:33.975]  Alright, Griff, I want to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour for questions, comments, what's happening in the world, but I want to get into Easton Mould the next segment.
[02:00:33.975 --> 02:00:35.976]  You were ranting in a good way during the break about
[02:00:36.934 --> 02:00:38.055]  What Trump needs to do.
[02:00:38.055 --> 02:00:40.777]  I mean, he's doing so much.
[02:00:40.777 --> 02:00:41.597]  I'd love to attack Trump.
[02:00:41.597 --> 02:00:43.498]  I don't care who his leader is.
[02:00:43.498 --> 02:00:46.721]  But he really is the global thrall against him.
[02:00:46.721 --> 02:00:49.442]  What should he do right now?
[02:00:49.442 --> 02:00:56.427]  Well, I think he's doing a lot considering the fact that he's got so much opposition coming at him from every single direction.
[02:00:56.427 --> 02:01:01.050]  But I mean, I think it's going to be a slow process.
[02:01:01.050 --> 02:01:03.892]  If it were me, I would start looking at what is the root cause.
[02:01:03.892 --> 02:01:04.693]  I know that
[02:01:05.433 --> 02:01:08.173]  You know, Trump right now doesn't want to ruffle any more feathers.
[02:01:08.173 --> 02:01:25.576]  But I mean, if you look at the why we're dealing with so many problems with the earth, why we're dealing with so many problems with people's health care, you know, executive order to ban GMOs or to put together an advisory team of independent scientists to evaluate the negative effects of genetically modified foods.
[02:01:25.576 --> 02:01:29.917]  They just they're coming out with a whole new potato and they just keep approving these abolished.
[02:01:29.917 --> 02:01:32.178]  I mean, the EPA is a disaster.
[02:01:32.178 --> 02:01:34.798]  The USDA is a corporate takeover of life.
[02:01:35.299 --> 02:01:37.241]  The FDA is a disaster.
[02:01:37.241 --> 02:01:54.280]  I mean, you put an executive order together to where you can't have a head or someone who worked in the executive level of a major company like Monsanto or a pharmaceutical company running the FDA or running the EPA or running any government organizations.
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.281]  I mean, we got to get
[02:01:55.802 --> 02:01:57.903]  We've got to break all of this up.
[02:01:57.903 --> 02:02:11.787]  We can't have all these lobbyists and we can't have all these individuals that are tied to all these big corporations that are destroying the planet, that are manipulating all of these studies, that are saying that vaccines are healthy for you.
[02:02:11.787 --> 02:02:17.589]  That ignore all the real problems with the environment and make it about carbon taxes.
[02:02:18.169 --> 02:02:25.238]  Yeah, and look, you can go and pull up all this documentation on, listen, I believe that we should have a choice, right?
[02:02:25.238 --> 02:02:26.259]  I believe in free speech.
[02:02:26.259 --> 02:02:32.287]  I believe we should be able to make a choice to who our doctor is, make a choice about what we're going to put in our bodies.
[02:02:32.287 --> 02:02:35.210]  That's another reason why I'm not happy with the health care plan because
[02:02:35.951 --> 02:02:41.853]  If you're a licensed practitioner, there are so many people right now that are begging for natural medicine.
[02:02:41.853 --> 02:02:47.534]  They want to see all these studies on how natural medicine can help improve their life, how cleansing and detoxification.
[02:02:47.534 --> 02:02:49.695]  They want to know about the root cause of disease.
[02:02:49.695 --> 02:03:01.998]  They want to know that we all have a self-healing mechanism in our body and our self-healing mechanism is being suppressed and our immune system is being suppressed because of all of the chemicals and the toxins and the hormones and the endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
[02:03:02.478 --> 02:03:04.519]  Trump needs to sign an executive order.
[02:03:04.519 --> 02:03:10.881]  If you can't pronounce the chemical, then it shouldn't be used in something you're going to ingest or put on your skin.
[02:03:10.881 --> 02:03:14.022]  Just look at all of these cosmetic products out there.
[02:03:14.022 --> 02:03:16.223]  Look at all the shampoos, the conditioners.
[02:03:16.223 --> 02:03:19.284]  Look at the air fresheners that are allowed.
[02:03:19.284 --> 02:03:30.528]  Why is an air freshener allowed to be put in somebody's home when it's producing high levels of toxic fragrances that are phthalates that cause
[02:03:31.568 --> 02:03:33.568]  Problems with sterility.
[02:03:33.568 --> 02:03:34.449]  We have lists.
[02:03:34.449 --> 02:03:37.529]  It's not like I'm just sitting up here talking about all this stuff.
[02:03:37.529 --> 02:03:39.670]  Sign an executive order to take fluoride out of the water.
[02:03:39.670 --> 02:03:41.510]  The globalists admit they're at war with humanity.
[02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:44.531]  They've turned everything into a weaponized system.
[02:03:44.531 --> 02:03:46.091]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:03:46.091 --> 02:03:51.872]  Because it's taken them a hundred years to set up a scientific dictatorship.
[02:03:51.872 --> 02:03:54.353]  And now all over the world humanity seems to be figuring it out.
[02:03:54.853 --> 02:03:55.413]  They're figuring it out.
[02:03:55.413 --> 02:03:56.094]  That's what humanity does.
[02:03:56.094 --> 02:03:56.934]  Humanity finally figures it out.
[02:03:56.934 --> 02:03:57.595]  They're figuring it out.
[02:03:57.595 --> 02:03:58.816]  Then we overthrow it.
[02:03:58.816 --> 02:03:59.376]  That's right.
[02:03:59.376 --> 02:04:04.539]  And the good thing, look, I don't want to be doom and gloom, the good news is we are figuring it out.
[02:04:04.539 --> 02:04:07.962]  And finally, for once, we believe and we have faith.
[02:04:08.735 --> 02:04:17.639]  That we have a president that's going to actually do something about it, that understands what the people want, that the people want to be able to choose.
[02:04:17.639 --> 02:04:29.505]  If I want natural medicine, I want to go to a naturopathic doctor who has proven success, and I'm reading thousands of reviews online that this natural doctor specializes in Lyme disease, and he's got a special
[02:04:30.505 --> 02:04:31.745]  I'm Alex Jones, this is the Info War.
[02:04:59.995 --> 02:05:12.079]  A previously debunked claim alleging then candidate Donald Trump ran a secret server to communicate with Russia during the 2016 presidential race has resurfaced.
[02:05:12.079 --> 02:05:15.640]  The establishment mainstream media is now rehashing this story.
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:15.980]  I don't know.
[02:05:32.182 --> 02:05:37.343]  Including Trump's so-called secret server to talk with the Russians.
[02:05:37.343 --> 02:05:40.064]  And look who's spreading the fake news.
[02:05:40.064 --> 02:05:47.826]  Hillary Clinton posted on Twitter that it's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia.
[02:05:47.826 --> 02:05:54.507]  And she included a link to the original Slate article that started the bogus rumor to begin with.
[02:05:54.507 --> 02:05:58.208]  You can check out the real news right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:00.066 --> 02:06:01.907]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:06:01.907 --> 02:06:08.509]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:08.509 --> 02:06:11.670]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:11.670 --> 02:06:21.453]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:06:21.453 --> 02:06:22.294]  Caveman.
[02:06:22.294 --> 02:06:27.355]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:06:27.355 --> 02:06:29.476]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:29.776 --> 02:06:32.917]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:32.917 --> 02:06:38.078]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:38.078 --> 02:06:46.080]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:54.062]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:06:54.062 --> 02:06:58.803]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.

[02:07:56.670 --> 02:07:57.971]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:08:28.954 --> 02:08:35.377]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:35.377 --> 02:08:42.400]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:47.282]  And now for something completely different.
[02:08:47.282 --> 02:08:53.105]  When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
[02:08:58.567 --> 02:09:04.392]  What the hell are they?
[02:09:23.666 --> 02:09:24.708]  You've got to survive.
[02:09:24.708 --> 02:09:25.890]  Somebody's got to survive.
[02:09:25.890 --> 02:09:26.731]  U.S.A!
[02:09:26.731 --> 02:09:28.474]  U.S.A!
[02:09:28.474 --> 02:09:29.215]  But wait.
[02:09:29.215 --> 02:09:30.277]  Give her a chance.
[02:09:30.277 --> 02:09:32.822]  When she calms down, she might have an actual argument.
[02:09:37.219 --> 02:09:37.839]  Nope.
[02:09:37.839 --> 02:09:39.940]  Just more autistic screeching.
[02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:42.082]  He is your president!
[02:09:42.082 --> 02:09:43.382]  No, I know what you think.
[02:09:43.382 --> 02:09:45.063]  This is just one individual.
[02:09:45.063 --> 02:09:51.066]  This isn't an accurate portrayal of the reasoned, credible, legitimate, anti-Trump protest movement.
[02:09:51.066 --> 02:09:53.648]  United States of America...
[02:10:02.346 --> 02:10:03.787]  Yeah.
[02:10:31.438 --> 02:10:33.732]  That was amazing!
[02:10:36.783 --> 02:10:41.426]  When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
[02:10:41.426 --> 02:10:45.749]  Joking aside, this is the effect that the mainstream media is having on people.
[02:10:45.749 --> 02:10:51.572]  This is what happens when you tell people over and over again that Trump is going to bring about the apocalypse.
[02:10:51.572 --> 02:10:54.254]  This is what mass hysteria looks like.
[02:10:54.254 --> 02:10:57.896]  This is what happens when collective insanity is legitimized.
[02:11:02.959 --> 02:11:07.503]  At the bottom of the hour, I want to open the phones up about where you think Trump is, what you think about this health care bill.
[02:11:07.503 --> 02:11:13.969]  The first thing I can genuinely say is that he's tacitly supporting it because he wants a debate.
[02:11:13.969 --> 02:11:15.470]  This is what the Republicans came up with.
[02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:17.432]  They're the ones that helped write the bill.
[02:11:17.432 --> 02:11:18.593]  It's still got a mandate.
[02:11:18.593 --> 02:11:24.618]  It still charges you money, but to the insurance company, if you don't get insurance.
[02:11:24.618 --> 02:11:26.719]  Senator Paul was on yesterday, and I agree with him.
[02:11:26.719 --> 02:11:28.041]  It's got some major problems.
[02:11:29.178 --> 02:11:32.340]  Trump said he talked to Rand Paul and he wants it changed too.
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:33.481]  So okay, great.
[02:11:33.481 --> 02:11:36.263]  But Trump's saying give the people the repeal they want.
[02:11:36.263 --> 02:11:42.067]  Well, if it's a repeal and something like 80% is bad, we don't want that.
[02:11:42.067 --> 02:11:44.529]  But again, overall, Trump's trying to just work with Congress.
[02:11:44.529 --> 02:11:45.890]  We'll see what happens with that.
[02:11:45.890 --> 02:11:47.951]  Here's the new article.
[02:11:47.951 --> 02:11:53.215]  Impel War is warned of government using microphones to spy on Americans 11 years ago.
[02:11:53.215 --> 02:11:56.197]  They would have called this fake news all the time.
[02:11:58.271 --> 02:12:02.492]  Then we show screenshots again of September 6, 2006.
[02:12:02.492 --> 02:12:03.533]  We just don't have archives.
[02:12:03.533 --> 02:12:05.794]  Our site just stopped serving the old stuff.
[02:12:05.794 --> 02:12:08.715]  We had stuff even older, but okay, I'll take 11 years.
[02:12:08.715 --> 02:12:13.916]  Government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans online.
[02:12:13.916 --> 02:12:16.277]  That was the folks that were online then.
[02:12:16.277 --> 02:12:20.699]  So the article goes over all the different Vault 7 developments.
[02:12:21.758 --> 02:12:26.802]  That have taken place, shows you screenshots of our articles over the years.
[02:12:26.802 --> 02:12:32.766]  But again, I'd love to say we just magically thought all this up on ourselves and it just came true.
[02:12:32.766 --> 02:12:35.188]  It's hiding in plain view.
[02:12:35.188 --> 02:12:36.869]  They're geoengineering.
[02:12:36.869 --> 02:12:40.412]  They're putting cancer viruses and other garbage in the vaccines.
[02:12:40.412 --> 02:12:41.612]  It's admitted.
[02:12:41.612 --> 02:12:42.433]  It's crazy.
[02:12:42.433 --> 02:12:44.535]  Criminals run the government.
[02:12:44.535 --> 02:12:48.397]  Good people at every level are trying to stop it.
[02:12:48.397 --> 02:12:49.018]  Now, Dr. Group,
[02:12:50.316 --> 02:12:52.138]  Go over your articles, we've got a document cam going.
[02:12:52.138 --> 02:12:54.720]  If you're a radio listener, go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:57.602]  You've got the floor to the bottom of the hour, then we'll take calls together at 800-259-9231.
[02:12:57.602 --> 02:12:58.943]  800, first time callers, 800-259-9231.
[02:12:58.943 --> 02:12:59.344]  Let's get into...
[02:13:06.590 --> 02:13:11.413]  The latest product, and again, we fund ourselves with water filters and non-GMO seeds.
[02:13:11.413 --> 02:13:15.676]  Everything's about life, everything's about what you need, with all the crap that's in the water table.
[02:13:15.676 --> 02:13:21.060]  But Micro ZX, discounted 10%, free shipping as well right now until next week.
[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:26.503]  When you get it with the Biome Defense Probiotic, the two go together like a horse and carriage.
[02:13:26.503 --> 02:13:27.904]  Why is the fungus?
[02:13:27.904 --> 02:13:28.985]  Why is the mold?
[02:13:28.985 --> 02:13:30.966]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[02:13:30.966 --> 02:13:34.369]  Why is it in mainstream news causing all these weird brain tumors and stuff?
[02:13:34.369 --> 02:13:35.349]  What is going on?
[02:13:35.349 --> 02:13:36.110]  What has changed?
[02:13:36.690 --> 02:13:39.614]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[02:13:39.614 --> 02:13:40.875]  We have a small test batch.
[02:13:40.875 --> 02:13:42.758]  We've been trying this for years.
[02:13:42.758 --> 02:13:44.480]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:48.565]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[02:13:48.565 --> 02:13:54.893]  Let's talk about MicroZX right now and why it's available at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, and why it's so important.
[02:13:55.543 --> 02:14:06.426]  Well, years ago, when I had my clinic before I was shut down, one of the things that people would always come to me and say, I've been to five or six different doctors and no one can figure out what's wrong with me.
[02:14:06.426 --> 02:14:14.928]  And after a while, I figured out, okay, if no doctors can figure out what's wrong with you, you're suffering from some sort of toxicity in the body.
[02:14:14.928 --> 02:14:18.989]  It's either going to be some sort of chemicals, metals, fungus, parasites.
[02:14:21.690 --> 02:14:26.553]  A lot of times people are suffering from fungus or yeast or mold overgrowth and parasites.
[02:14:26.553 --> 02:14:30.695]  And when has a doctor ever told them that?
[02:14:30.695 --> 02:14:40.041]  Like, I've rarely, rarely, unless it's the patient that just asked the doctor to do a bunch of blood and saliva and urine tests and everything, most likely you'll never know.
[02:14:40.041 --> 02:14:41.682]  And it's designed that way.
[02:14:41.682 --> 02:14:47.485]  It's getting worse and worse because of all the carbohydrate-based diets, the fast food, the microwave food, the EMFs.
[02:14:47.485 --> 02:14:48.886]  All of that stuff is creating a
[02:14:50.367 --> 02:14:52.990]  Thicker, stronger fungus.
[02:14:52.990 --> 02:14:57.854]  People are just, men and women, I mean women are having vaginal infections.
[02:14:57.854 --> 02:15:02.999]  Candida is one of the main things that we're dealing with, systemic candida infection.
[02:15:02.999 --> 02:15:05.181]  Crohn's disease, mainline studies.
[02:15:05.181 --> 02:15:14.710]  Crohn's disease coming out now, and as just came out not too long ago, the Mayo Clinic study implicates fungus as a cause of chronic sinusitis.
[02:15:15.911 --> 02:15:28.578]  An estimated 37 million people in the United States suffer from chronic sinusitis, an inflammation of the membranes of the nose and the sinus cavity, and for years and years and years... I know when mold's high, I feel like I've been run over by a car.
[02:15:28.578 --> 02:15:31.340]  But I take this new product, it knocks it right out.
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:36.764]  This has been in the works, like you said, for this formula has been in the works for over 10 years.
[02:15:36.764 --> 02:15:37.605]  I've been adjusting it.
[02:15:37.605 --> 02:15:38.525]  It's so fresh.
[02:15:38.525 --> 02:15:45.811]  I mean, when can you go to any store and open up a bottle of anything and you can literally smell the power of the herbs?
[02:15:45.811 --> 02:15:46.532]  Take a whiff of that.
[02:15:48.404 --> 02:15:49.725]  I mean, it's a very powerful formula.
[02:15:49.725 --> 02:15:51.347]  Just the licorice alone knocks me on the back.
[02:15:51.347 --> 02:15:53.709]  And like I was saying, if you... Tell folks what Sam.
[02:15:53.709 --> 02:15:59.555]  So what you have in this is you have a combination of wild-crafted jatoba bark, which actually comes from the rainforest.
[02:15:59.555 --> 02:16:08.543]  So we have ethical harvesting that goes on, and we work with companies down in Brazil and Peru and where the rainforests are, and they go out and they actually harvest this by hand.
[02:16:09.304 --> 02:16:17.506]  And then we process it without exposing it to any microwave radiation, which, by the way, the majority of products that come from overseas do get radiated.
[02:16:17.506 --> 02:16:19.786]  They radiate everything now.
[02:16:19.786 --> 02:16:24.307]  And so we try to get that in its most natural, fresh form that we possibly can.
[02:16:24.307 --> 02:16:26.148]  It's got pate arco in there.
[02:16:26.148 --> 02:16:36.110]  And these herbs contain different compounds that have been proven to attack different types of fungus, mold, and yeast organisms.
[02:16:36.730 --> 02:16:57.854]  We use licorice root which is a lot of times these organisms will put this mucus biofilm layer around themselves and that needs to be broken down and licorice root kind of helps break that mucus membrane down and we also started experimenting with enzymes to do that as well and it contains hemicellulase because the especially candida has
[02:16:58.394 --> 02:17:11.354]  A surrounding made of a cellulose matrix so that hemicellulase is an enzyme that breaks through and eats that as well as the beta-glucanase and then we have golden thread and then anise as well so very powerful formula.
[02:17:12.481 --> 02:17:14.162]  It's amazing.
[02:17:14.162 --> 02:17:16.443]  Most people don't even know.
[02:17:16.443 --> 02:17:18.624]  See, that's the way a lot of this stuff is designed.
[02:17:18.624 --> 02:17:21.726]  It's designed to incapacitate you over time.
[02:17:21.726 --> 02:17:22.466]  Soft kill.
[02:17:22.466 --> 02:17:25.828]  It's a soft kill, so you don't even realize what's happening to you.
[02:17:25.828 --> 02:17:28.309]  By the way, I've never smelled licorice that strong.
[02:17:28.309 --> 02:17:29.109]  Oh, the smells.
[02:17:29.109 --> 02:17:30.630]  You get it so fresh.
[02:17:30.630 --> 02:17:32.491]  You cold press it.
[02:17:32.491 --> 02:17:33.972]  You don't process it.
[02:17:33.972 --> 02:17:34.472]  It's strong.
[02:17:35.202 --> 02:17:37.462]  Listen to this lady that was testing this formula.
[02:17:37.462 --> 02:17:47.925]  She writes in, I had trouble breathing, itching in my eyes, ears, back of my throat, and nasal passages, had mucus that I could not get rid of, dizziness, and the list goes on.
[02:17:47.925 --> 02:17:53.126]  Been to four different doctors for five years trying to rid myself of the issues I was having.
[02:17:53.126 --> 02:17:56.086]  Spent thousands of dollars getting nowhere.
[02:17:56.086 --> 02:17:59.267]  They told me things like, there was nothing wrong with me.
[02:17:59.267 --> 02:18:01.467]  Oh, you have allergies.
[02:18:01.467 --> 02:18:03.748]  Must be the dust at your work or your home.
[02:18:04.508 --> 02:18:08.558]  Have been on half a dozen different meds and nothing worked.
[02:18:09.639 --> 02:18:14.783]  Found this formula and have been on it for two months now and it's made such an improvement in my health.
[02:18:14.783 --> 02:18:16.744]  I am now active in sports again.
[02:18:16.744 --> 02:18:19.426]  I feel better, stronger, livelier.
[02:18:19.426 --> 02:18:20.187]  Thanks a million.
[02:18:20.187 --> 02:18:22.349]  And Alex, I have stacks of these.
[02:18:22.349 --> 02:18:24.210]  Let me ask you this.
[02:18:24.210 --> 02:18:25.271]  Why is the fungus?
[02:18:25.271 --> 02:18:26.212]  They admit this everywhere.
[02:18:26.212 --> 02:18:30.315]  Again, I know like three or four people that have family or themselves have brain tumors.
[02:18:30.315 --> 02:18:33.077]  Suddenly kids from fungus.
[02:18:33.077 --> 02:18:33.397]  Yeah.
[02:18:33.397 --> 02:18:34.598]  What the hell's going on with the fungus?
[02:18:35.708 --> 02:18:40.511]  Well, there's a lot of different types of fungus right now that... I mean, why is it getting so bad?
[02:18:40.511 --> 02:18:42.333]  Why is it getting worse?
[02:18:42.333 --> 02:18:51.059]  I think that the re... From everything that I've found, number one is, what happens is, as soon as somebody starts feeling bad, they go to the doctor's office.
[02:18:51.059 --> 02:18:57.844]  And the first thing the doctors did... Fungus has the same signs and symptoms, almost, as... They don't know what to do with it.
[02:18:57.844 --> 02:19:02.647]  They think it's flu-like symptoms, so they immediately put people on antibiotics.
[02:19:02.647 --> 02:19:03.668]  Looking at all of the...
[02:19:04.088 --> 02:19:21.565]  Looking at all of the things that I've studied about the fungus and trying to figure out why it is causing the brain malfunctions, and not only brain cancer, but it's linked to anxiety, it's linked to depression, it's linked to psychosis, it's linked to suicidal thoughts, all of that, I think a lot of it stems from
[02:19:22.506 --> 02:19:27.370]  When they go to the doctor's office, the first thing that the doctors do is they use anti-fungal.
[02:19:27.370 --> 02:19:29.832]  They don't even use anti-fungal medications, Alex.
[02:19:29.832 --> 02:19:32.074]  They use strong antibiotics.
[02:19:32.074 --> 02:19:34.196]  What do antibiotics do?
[02:19:34.196 --> 02:19:37.158]  They completely wipe out the gut lining.
[02:19:37.158 --> 02:19:39.740]  It kills the bacteria that fill in the space.
[02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:41.902]  So now the fungus grows more.
[02:19:41.902 --> 02:19:46.726]  So now you have an overgrowth of fungus and bacteria in the gut.
[02:19:46.726 --> 02:19:48.247]  And listen to this.
[02:19:48.247 --> 02:19:48.827]  Fungus
[02:19:49.921 --> 02:19:55.243]  Especially Candida produces... Because we always hear about bacteria in the news and how they're resistant now.
[02:19:55.243 --> 02:19:56.303]  We never hear about fungus.
[02:19:56.303 --> 02:19:58.164]  It's just as prevalent.
[02:19:58.164 --> 02:20:06.727]  Actually, I would say more people are in a greater health risk due to fungus, mold, and yeast than they are bacteria.
[02:20:06.727 --> 02:20:08.788]  Fungus just is really hard to kill.
[02:20:08.788 --> 02:20:17.811]  It lives, it replicates, and because of the poor diet and everything that people are eating and the high sugar and bad carbohydrates that people are consuming... Why does fungus live off that?
[02:20:18.834 --> 02:20:20.955]  Because it feeds off of sugars, actually.
[02:20:20.955 --> 02:20:21.995]  It feeds off of sugars.
[02:20:21.995 --> 02:20:23.615]  Plants eat sugar.
[02:20:23.615 --> 02:20:23.915]  Yes.
[02:20:23.915 --> 02:20:26.156]  So, how does this kill it?
[02:20:26.156 --> 02:20:31.457]  And people do say that you get pretty dramatic if you're really infested, so tell people about it.
[02:20:31.457 --> 02:20:35.518]  Well, it creates an environment that they do not like.
[02:20:35.518 --> 02:20:42.400]  And it has the different compounds in the herbs, like the berberine in some of the herbs, and the hemicellulase.
[02:20:44.372 --> 02:20:45.233]  Are you kidding?
[02:21:01.587 --> 02:21:11.253]  are designed to actually disable and cause dysfunction and stop replication of the fungal or yeast or mold organisms.
[02:21:11.253 --> 02:21:16.817]  So we've got folks who take biome defense and suddenly their irritable bowel is gone in just a month.
[02:21:16.817 --> 02:21:18.758]  I'm trying to get them on air but it's embarrassing to talk about these things.
[02:21:19.238 --> 02:21:22.982]  Well, the gut is always the first thing that you want to repair.
[02:21:22.982 --> 02:21:24.564]  It's the first exposure point.
[02:21:34.415 --> 02:21:38.239]  Is the key to all health and also the key to all disease.
[02:21:38.239 --> 02:21:39.941]  And we've been saying that for a long time.
[02:21:39.941 --> 02:21:42.464]  It's the first exposure point to the outside environment.
[02:21:42.464 --> 02:21:48.670]  So when you put in all this stuff, the first thing that you need to be healthy, the gut is the largest endocrine gland.
[02:21:48.670 --> 02:21:51.113]  By the way, we get the term Hippocratic Oath from Hippocrates.
[02:21:51.113 --> 02:21:51.613]  That's right.
[02:21:51.613 --> 02:21:54.496]  For what, 10 years now, they no longer give it at medical schools.
[02:21:54.496 --> 02:21:54.997]  That's right.
[02:21:54.997 --> 02:21:55.537]  Do no harm.
[02:21:56.278 --> 02:22:03.445]  When you look into any of this stuff, whether it's bowel conditions, even gastroenterologists don't know this stuff.
[02:22:03.445 --> 02:22:16.538]  When you look into fungus, when you look into the effects of fluoride, when you look into the effects of pesticides... So I'll go back, I get why it's growing in us worse, but I mean, I know a police officer in Cleveland, I'm gonna leave it at that, who was like the hero of the department, you name it, he went in a...
[02:22:17.179 --> 02:22:18.279]  Vacant house that had mold.
[02:22:18.279 --> 02:22:20.941]  He and his partner almost got killed by the mold.
[02:22:20.941 --> 02:22:22.721]  He had a brain tumor from it.
[02:22:22.721 --> 02:22:23.522]  Then I looked it up.
[02:22:23.522 --> 02:22:24.322]  It's all over the place.
[02:22:24.322 --> 02:22:25.282]  People getting brain tumors.
[02:22:25.282 --> 02:22:26.223]  What the hell?
[02:22:26.223 --> 02:22:29.764]  Why is it suddenly growing in the brain?
[02:22:29.764 --> 02:22:35.166]  That's going to lead you to what black mold actually creates.
[02:22:35.166 --> 02:22:41.489]  And black mold has been used as a bioweapon dating back a long period of time.
[02:22:41.489 --> 02:22:44.110]  The black mold actually creates
[02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:51.351]  Let me see if I can find it right here, the military, different types of biological testing and everything that have been done.
[02:22:51.351 --> 02:22:52.432]  Document Cam, folks!
[02:22:52.432 --> 02:22:56.672]  Right here, toxic black mold in biological weapons.
[02:22:56.672 --> 02:23:09.335]  Now black mold has been found even in dishwashers now and in laundry machines in homes, and I have an article on that as well, but black mold, biological weapons have been made from T2, it's called tricho
[02:23:11.457 --> 02:23:13.078]  Ufoxane mycotoxins.
[02:23:13.078 --> 02:23:14.979]  I don't even know how to pronounce that.
[02:23:14.979 --> 02:23:20.201]  But those are the mycotoxins produced by toxic black mold, which can be found in even growing in your homes.
[02:23:20.201 --> 02:23:25.443]  And several countries have grown toxic mold to harvest the T2 mycotoxins.
[02:23:25.443 --> 02:23:31.326]  Even during the Vietnam War, these mycotoxins were released over remote jungle areas in Laos.
[02:23:31.326 --> 02:23:34.067]  This caused over 6,300 deaths between 1975 and 1981.
[02:23:34.067 --> 02:23:36.668]  Sure, but let's not just blame the elites.
[02:23:36.668 --> 02:23:39.550]  Is it our modern unhealthy homes this stuff grows in?
[02:23:40.379 --> 02:23:42.360]  Yes, yes.
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:51.484]  It's the combination of what mold really needs, the black mold, what that needs to survive is a damp, toxic environment.
[02:23:51.484 --> 02:23:56.707]  And especially down south where the humidity is above 35 percent, you're going to get more black mold.
[02:23:56.707 --> 02:23:58.408]  The south obviously, like allergies in Austin.
[02:23:58.408 --> 02:24:08.753]  Usually when you look at the black mold causing brain dysfunction or you cause respiratory, a lot of respiratory issues or brain tumors or anything like that, most of the time those are going to be down south.
[02:24:10.100 --> 02:24:14.341]  Well let's talk about then what MycoZx, what do you call it MycoZx?
[02:24:14.341 --> 02:24:15.021]  So it's called MycoZx.
[02:24:15.021 --> 02:24:17.581]  Normal Fungal and Use Balance Info Wars.
[02:24:17.581 --> 02:24:19.502]  Life.com and it supports the broadcast.
[02:24:19.502 --> 02:24:20.542]  But how would people protect us?
[02:24:20.542 --> 02:24:20.922]  What's it do?
[02:24:20.922 --> 02:24:23.763]  So basically there's just a fungus among us.
[02:24:23.763 --> 02:24:28.443]  I mean and it's just coming out with we need to do something to protect ourselves.
[02:24:28.443 --> 02:24:29.704]  It's really hard to avoid it.
[02:24:29.704 --> 02:24:32.624]  So just like when you're a kid, cats have ringworm.
[02:24:32.624 --> 02:24:34.805]  It's a fungus and it can eat bloody holes in your skin.
[02:24:34.805 --> 02:24:36.745]  I mean this stuff gets in our body.
[02:24:37.762 --> 02:24:44.846]  There's no way really to avoid it right now because they're even showing that someone can be exposed to fungus and it spreads very easily.
[02:24:44.846 --> 02:24:52.770]  I mean, you touch, you know, especially in the crowded big cities right now, you can spread it through respiratory, you can spread it through touching people.
[02:24:52.770 --> 02:24:55.972]  So tell folks what MycoZx for EnforcedLife.com
[02:24:56.312 --> 02:24:59.933]  So, MycoZx is something that you can use to cleanse.
[02:24:59.933 --> 02:25:01.974]  It's all about cleansing the body.
[02:25:01.974 --> 02:25:04.594]  You cleanse your body of harmful yeast.
[02:25:04.594 --> 02:25:07.815]  And these are known herbs and compounds and enzymes.
[02:25:07.815 --> 02:25:08.155]  Yes.
[02:25:08.155 --> 02:25:17.278]  I mean, I've been trying this formula and I've got a stack of results, research studies on people for 10 years and this is the first time it's going to be launched today.
[02:25:17.278 --> 02:25:18.678]  It's a proven formula.
[02:25:18.678 --> 02:25:21.999]  It's not like we're putting something together at the last minute.
[02:25:21.999 --> 02:25:23.019]  I've been talking to you about it.
[02:25:23.019 --> 02:25:24.800]  But like I said, you don't want to eat it on an empty stomach.
[02:25:26.087 --> 02:25:26.807]  It just depends.
[02:25:26.807 --> 02:25:27.808]  You can take it with food.
[02:25:27.808 --> 02:25:33.350]  I personally, I like to just experiment with myself, and I've taken it on an empty stomach.
[02:25:33.350 --> 02:25:35.211]  But yes, you can take it with food.
[02:25:35.211 --> 02:25:36.632]  Some people can take it on an empty stomach.
[02:25:36.632 --> 02:25:38.072]  Well, I mean, it's pretty hardcore.
[02:25:38.072 --> 02:25:38.433]  It is?
[02:25:38.433 --> 02:25:48.237]  Well, what's hardcore is the candida fungus releases up to 80 known neurotoxins.
[02:25:48.237 --> 02:25:50.258]  And they get really pissed when they get bombed with this.
[02:25:50.498 --> 02:25:55.923]  Yes, so what happens is they start blowing up and all those neurotoxins and toxins end up coming out into your bloodstream.
[02:25:55.923 --> 02:26:11.497]  So that's, I mean, when you take something that kills off a harmful organism that's in your body, it's that dead organism that needs to be removed by your immune system, and most likely your immune system is not working at 100% anyway, so now your immune system has to go into overdrive to clean up.
[02:26:11.497 --> 02:26:13.279]  Sure, but what happens once you've been on it a while?
[02:26:13.279 --> 02:26:13.799]  It's amazing.
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:22.191]  Oh my gosh, your energy starts increasing, your bowel activity starts to prepare itself, your mental clarity starts coming back.
[02:26:22.191 --> 02:26:28.460]  I, look, I eat healthy and avoid as much, I don't even eat sugar, I try to avoid it as much as I possibly can.
[02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:30.363]  I don't hardly even drink alcohol that much.
[02:26:31.621 --> 02:26:38.167]  To me, I do a fungal and a mold and a yeast cleanse at least every three months.
[02:26:38.167 --> 02:26:41.550]  I give it to my kids because they're at school and they're around all these other kids.
[02:26:41.550 --> 02:26:44.573]  Sure, and this is jam-packed with 120 powder capsules.
[02:26:44.573 --> 02:26:45.354]  It's GMO-free.
[02:26:45.354 --> 02:26:46.855]  We've only got like three runs of this.
[02:26:46.855 --> 02:26:50.398]  How often would you take MycoZx?
[02:26:50.398 --> 02:26:57.165]  I would take that straight for a period of about three to six weeks to start my initial cleanse.
[02:26:57.725 --> 02:27:01.330]  So we recommend two to three capsules twice a day.
[02:27:01.330 --> 02:27:03.272]  Two to three capsules twice a day.
[02:27:03.272 --> 02:27:10.321]  If you've already, if you're working with, we always recommend we have to, you know, we're not allowed to make any claims.
[02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:13.284]  We always recommend you check in with your health care practitioner.
[02:27:14.125 --> 02:27:19.668]  Just, if you're on medications, you know, make sure that there's not going to be any contraindications with that.
[02:27:19.668 --> 02:27:32.435]  But it all boils down to you taking responsibility for your own health and us giving your listeners, your fans, everybody out there, the best possible thing to take care of the solution.
[02:27:32.435 --> 02:27:36.818]  Well, I mean, listen, I know folks that have taken other probiotics and not had the effect.
[02:27:36.818 --> 02:27:40.040]  We take Biome Defense that's discounted with those 10% today.
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:42.361]  I mean, that is an amazing probiotic you developed.
[02:27:42.661 --> 02:27:43.882]  They're perfect for each other.
[02:27:43.882 --> 02:27:54.350]  They work hand-in-hand because the Biome Defense has 23 strains of the best probiotics that are specifically cultured for InfoWars.
[02:27:56.199 --> 02:27:58.081]  They're not cultured on gelatin.
[02:27:58.081 --> 02:27:59.642]  They're not made with animal products.
[02:27:59.642 --> 02:28:02.764]  They don't have a bunch of toxic excipients and fillers in there.
[02:28:02.764 --> 02:28:05.906]  They actually said I was crazy when I came up with this formula.
[02:28:05.906 --> 02:28:07.667]  They said, you're going to pay.
[02:28:07.667 --> 02:28:08.647]  We have nobody.
[02:28:08.647 --> 02:28:09.808]  There's only about four or five.
[02:28:09.808 --> 02:28:10.649]  Everybody's real cheap.
[02:28:10.649 --> 02:28:11.769]  Puts like a dollar in a bottle.
[02:28:11.769 --> 02:28:13.591]  We're putting like 20 bucks in a bottle.
[02:28:13.591 --> 02:28:15.132]  There's only three or four or five.
[02:28:15.132 --> 02:28:16.973]  Well, this is medical grade.
[02:28:16.973 --> 02:28:18.634]  Super fancy clinics have stuff similar.
[02:28:20.270 --> 02:28:22.491]  I don't even think they have anything similar to this.
[02:28:22.491 --> 02:28:23.752]  I mean, there's no doubt about it.
[02:28:23.752 --> 02:28:25.133]  By the way, folks, that's not hype.
[02:28:25.133 --> 02:28:25.633]  You understand?
[02:28:25.633 --> 02:28:26.654]  We have to give you the best.
[02:28:26.654 --> 02:28:29.156]  This is what my kids take.
[02:28:29.156 --> 02:28:29.976]  You understand?
[02:28:29.976 --> 02:28:30.497]  Exactly.
[02:28:30.497 --> 02:28:33.338]  I mean, this is the stuff that I developed first.
[02:28:33.338 --> 02:28:40.163]  I say... I know these sponsors, the pharmaceuticals are great people, but I was looking for, you know, five years, so I found somebody to partner with, and everybody said, you're the best.
[02:28:41.178 --> 02:28:45.102]  I mean, you are a little, not neurotic about it, but getting the right ingredients.
[02:28:45.102 --> 02:28:48.586]  That's why most of our stuff is sold out sometimes, six months, because you're waiting to get the very best.
[02:28:48.586 --> 02:28:50.148]  I mean, you won't just put something out.
[02:28:50.148 --> 02:28:55.533]  That's why DNA Force is on back order right now, because we're getting a fresh, fresh batch coming in.
[02:28:56.533 --> 02:28:56.673]  Yes.
[02:29:11.974 --> 02:29:21.617]  If you're going to give something to somebody else, I want to make sure that I'm taking it, that it's up to my standards, that it's the best of the best, and I'm constantly wanting to make everything better, and we will be.
[02:29:21.617 --> 02:29:25.378]  We'll be coming out with some new things that you and I have been talking about and working on.
[02:29:25.378 --> 02:29:27.939]  Well, you're doing a great job, and this one is the ultimate game changer.
[02:29:28.419 --> 02:29:30.339]  MycoZX goes great with the bottom defense.
[02:29:30.339 --> 02:29:33.860]  Infowarslive.com or AAA2533139.
[02:29:33.860 --> 02:29:36.201]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[02:29:36.201 --> 02:29:38.081]  Look at the response we're getting.
[02:29:38.081 --> 02:29:39.541]  We're changing the world together.
[02:29:39.541 --> 02:29:40.562]  You are the Infowar.
[02:29:40.562 --> 02:29:41.782]  God bless you all.
[02:29:41.782 --> 02:29:45.483]  Kevin, Delton, Alex, Azeem, Susie and others.
[02:29:45.483 --> 02:29:47.303]  Your calls are three minutes away.
[02:29:47.303 --> 02:29:47.883]  Stay with us.
[02:29:47.883 --> 02:29:49.384]  This is the Infowar.
[02:29:49.384 --> 02:29:50.764]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.764 --> 02:29:53.304]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.304 --> 02:29:55.985]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.134 --> 02:30:12.010]  A previously debunked claim alleging then-candidate Donald Trump ran a secret server to communicate with Russia during the 2016 presidential race has resurfaced.
[02:30:12.010 --> 02:30:15.475]  The establishment mainstream media is now rehashing this
[02:30:15.555 --> 02:30:16.095]  I don't know.
[02:30:43.843 --> 02:30:47.949]  To answer serious questions about his ties to Russia.
[02:30:47.949 --> 02:30:54.658]  And she included a link to the original Slate article that started the bogus rumor to begin with.
[02:30:54.658 --> 02:30:57.682]  You can check out the real news right now at Infowars.com.
[02:30:59.893 --> 02:31:03.096]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:31:03.096 --> 02:31:05.438]  Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:05.438 --> 02:31:12.464]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[02:31:12.464 --> 02:31:17.788]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanse is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[02:31:17.788 --> 02:31:26.756]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[02:31:27.196 --> 02:31:36.059]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:31:36.059 --> 02:31:43.161]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[02:31:43.161 --> 02:31:48.643]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price.
[02:31:49.524 --> 02:31:54.433]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:54.433 --> 02:31:56.376]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:31:59.963 --> 02:32:01.804]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:32:01.804 --> 02:32:08.407]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diet of processed junk.
[02:32:08.407 --> 02:32:11.569]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:11.569 --> 02:32:21.353]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:32:21.353 --> 02:32:22.194]  Caveman.
[02:32:22.194 --> 02:32:27.256]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:32:27.256 --> 02:32:29.377]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:32:29.657 --> 02:32:32.819]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:32:32.819 --> 02:32:37.962]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:32:37.962 --> 02:32:46.106]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:32:46.106 --> 02:32:54.050]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:32:54.050 --> 02:32:58.713]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.
[02:33:03.729 --> 02:33:05.590]  We are on the march.
[02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:08.771]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:33:08.771 --> 02:33:13.972]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:13.972 --> 02:33:18.654]  All right, I was talking to my crew.
[02:33:18.654 --> 02:33:31.999]  We've been sold out for like a month of our non-GMO, organic, non-fluoride toothpaste that has tea tree oil and peppermint and, of course, a little silver and iodine in it.
[02:33:31.999 --> 02:33:33.019]  People say, well, why are you sold out?
[02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:37.033]  Because sometimes we buy a bunch of a great product and it doesn't sell for six months.
[02:33:37.033 --> 02:33:38.915]  We're sitting on it and then we don't have any money.
[02:33:38.915 --> 02:33:43.579]  We've never kind of gotten over that hump to have a big surplus of money to be able to gauge all this.
[02:33:43.579 --> 02:33:49.085]  So we did a limited run of MycoZX.
[02:33:49.085 --> 02:33:57.132]  Supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients from forestlife.com developed by Dr. Group.
[02:33:58.306 --> 02:34:05.053]  So when I say at current sales rates, because they just told us this is a hit, this will be sold out in about three days.
[02:34:05.053 --> 02:34:07.054]  Dr. Group, people actually get this.
[02:34:07.054 --> 02:34:18.645]  I guess people actually know how bad fungus and mold and all this is, and then using Mother Nature to counter this out of control system that's killing so many farm animals, bats, you name it, so many ground foraging mammals, it's just taking over their
[02:34:20.427 --> 02:34:22.308]  I mean, the bats get white-nosed.
[02:34:22.308 --> 02:34:24.410]  It just basically eats their sinuses, their lungs, they die.
[02:34:24.410 --> 02:34:26.911]  No wonder we're so sick, too, especially in the South.
[02:34:26.911 --> 02:34:32.035]  And I love Texas, but I've told people, you know, looking for stuff like this, I mean, I couldn't stay here in Texas.
[02:34:32.035 --> 02:34:33.836]  The allergies, the problems.
[02:34:33.836 --> 02:34:36.418]  How long until we can produce more of this, because it's about to sell out?
[02:34:37.997 --> 02:34:39.798]  I'll get on it right away.
[02:34:39.798 --> 02:34:43.141]  I'm hoping we can have some more in within about six weeks.
[02:34:43.141 --> 02:34:47.143]  We've got to test all the California standards.
[02:34:47.143 --> 02:34:52.266]  When you don't hear anybody talking about anything, that's the stuff you have to worry about.
[02:34:52.266 --> 02:35:01.232]  When you don't hear the mainstream media talking about how bad the fungus epidemic is, and the mold epidemic, and the yeast epidemic, and all the different strains of Candida.
[02:35:01.232 --> 02:35:04.154]  Science Daily just came out with a study, well this was in 2015, how
[02:35:06.778 --> 02:35:09.840]  Deadly fungus evades the immune system.
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:12.761]  Let's do a document cam shot for TV viewers.
[02:35:12.761 --> 02:35:13.182]  Right here.
[02:35:13.182 --> 02:35:14.342]  Right there.
[02:35:14.342 --> 02:35:15.163]  Aim at that.
[02:35:15.163 --> 02:35:22.147]  So they found that Candida albicans can kill immune cells even after its cells have died.
[02:35:22.147 --> 02:35:29.491]  They let the immune cells, called macrophages, consume the fungus and after an hour they remove the fungal cells from the macrophages.
[02:35:29.491 --> 02:35:30.691]  Then they expose the immune macrophages.
[02:35:30.691 --> 02:35:33.153]  So our body tries to kill it but it kills our cells, not them.
[02:35:35.037 --> 02:35:39.239]  So, no, our macrophages actually eat the fungus.
[02:35:39.239 --> 02:35:40.519]  Kills them.
[02:35:40.519 --> 02:35:42.640]  But what they're saying is it doesn't actually kill them.
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:46.261]  Do you know fungus is, the fungus cells actually have a nucleus in them.
[02:35:46.261 --> 02:35:50.343]  Bacterial cells don't have... Fungus, I'm not a doctor like you, but I've researched it.
[02:35:50.343 --> 02:35:53.684]  Fungus is basically what anthrax is.
[02:35:53.684 --> 02:36:02.588]  Anthrax is basically like a plant-based steel, and when it begins to die, it doesn't, it folds in, eats the other half, and becomes a crystalline source that can live a million years.
[02:36:03.288 --> 02:36:04.311]  See that's the thing.
[02:36:04.311 --> 02:36:06.837]  Plants and fungus basically can't be killed.
[02:36:06.837 --> 02:36:09.323]  Well then how is, how are herbs then?
[02:36:09.323 --> 02:36:09.925]  Flushing it?
[02:36:09.925 --> 02:36:10.466]  Binding to it?
[02:36:10.466 --> 02:36:10.967]  What are they doing?
[02:36:11.533 --> 02:36:15.775]  Well, the good ones are breaking it down, and then the components.
[02:36:15.775 --> 02:36:18.256]  See, there's always a solution to every situation.
[02:36:18.256 --> 02:36:19.157]  You just have to find it.
[02:36:19.157 --> 02:36:22.298]  The hard part about formulating a good product is actually finding what's going to work.
[02:36:22.298 --> 02:36:33.283]  Sure, it's like I forget there's some plant in Belize, like 10 times worse than... So, each plant has, you know, anywhere from 10 to 50 or 60 different chemical compounds in it.
[02:36:33.283 --> 02:36:37.225]  And so you have to find... Sure, but I'm saying like in Belize.
[02:36:38.786 --> 02:36:41.447]  There's this plant, I forget which one, it's like 10 times worse than poison ivy.
[02:36:41.447 --> 02:36:43.488]  There's another plant, though, you rub, it neutralizes it.
[02:36:43.488 --> 02:36:44.409]  Right, exactly.
[02:36:44.409 --> 02:36:48.991]  Yeah, there's always one that does this and there's always one that combats it, and that's the hard part, trying to find it.
[02:36:48.991 --> 02:37:02.077]  But when the medical profession, and no one is talking about the dangers of fungus and how big of an epidemic it actually is and how many people actually have it... Well, I want to have you on more to talk about this.
[02:37:02.077 --> 02:37:02.897]  It's a big subject.
[02:37:03.197 --> 02:37:04.538]  I want to thank folks for supporting us.

[02:37:21.313 --> 02:37:22.233]  And now we're getting censored.
[02:37:22.233 --> 02:37:22.894]  We're getting attacked.
[02:37:22.894 --> 02:37:24.195]  Dr. Rip, ship me yours before I go to these phone calls.
[02:37:25.632 --> 02:37:27.333]  I'm going to try to take these articles up because I want to show them.
[02:37:27.333 --> 02:37:31.857]  What do you make of Facebook saying to China, hey we're censoring now, let us into China.
[02:37:31.857 --> 02:37:39.223]  They're like advertising in major news that they're censoring here in the US, I showed it earlier, as if it's a good thing.
[02:37:39.223 --> 02:37:43.107]  I mean, and now they're censoring us on just mainline news.
[02:37:44.261 --> 02:37:45.181]  I think it's horrible.
[02:37:45.181 --> 02:37:58.608]  I mean, it just goes to show you the all-out war that's going on right now between the Democrats and all of these organizations that are forming and George Soros behind it.
[02:37:58.608 --> 02:38:05.891]  I mean, to suppress information and to come out and literally lie about half of this stuff
[02:38:07.143 --> 02:38:20.086]  It just amazes me that people, after all of these things, especially that CNN has been coming out with, and all of these lies, and all this, you know, they look at what we're doing as fake news.
[02:38:20.086 --> 02:38:27.007]  I'm telling you, anybody can do what we're doing and pull up the documentation and the proof, the declassified government documents, everything.
[02:38:27.007 --> 02:38:27.567]  Exactly!
[02:38:27.567 --> 02:38:29.588]  I mean, 99% of what we cover is documented.
[02:38:29.588 --> 02:38:31.568]  The headline they found isn't even strong enough.
[02:38:32.088 --> 02:38:39.671]  I've got one here in my stacks, making me mad I can't find it, where Zuckerberg's like, I'm proving to China I can censor, I've done it in America, I'll do it there too.
[02:38:39.671 --> 02:38:44.093]  I mean, he's just such a scumbag, man.
[02:38:44.093 --> 02:38:52.656]  I just, the karma, I literally meditate for about an hour or two hours every single day and try to bring love and peace and joy to this world right now because
[02:38:54.594 --> 02:39:01.640]  The negativity that we're seeing from the, I mean, I feel for those people and just, it's just an all-out fight.
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:05.603]  I'm just like, how can you be, how can you not know?
[02:39:05.603 --> 02:39:07.684]  Like, how can you not do the research?
[02:39:07.684 --> 02:39:12.989]  How can you not see the anti-Trump people beating everybody up, acting like goblins, acting like demons?
[02:39:12.989 --> 02:39:16.712]  I'm not saying Trump's perfect, but I mean, why are all these evil forces against him?
[02:39:16.712 --> 02:39:18.253]  Because he's bringing prosperity back.
[02:39:18.253 --> 02:39:20.915]  He's, like, exposing vaccines.
[02:39:20.915 --> 02:39:21.876]  What's your gut tell you about Trump?
[02:39:23.376 --> 02:39:38.706]  My gut, what my gut's telling me about Trump right now is he's got so much stuff and so much negative energy coming at him right now and he's dealing with it and it's gonna take time and I think deep down he really knows about all this stuff.
[02:39:39.466 --> 02:39:40.706]  I know he knows about all this.
[02:39:40.706 --> 02:39:46.768]  I don't really believe in a classical reincarnation, but they say, I wonder what Trump did in the last life to love it being heaped on him.
[02:39:46.768 --> 02:39:47.968]  He actually wants to beat them all.
[02:39:47.968 --> 02:39:52.489]  We have somebody in office that didn't need to be in politics.
[02:39:52.489 --> 02:39:54.729]  I mean, he's got money.
[02:39:54.729 --> 02:39:57.970]  That's the problem with politics most of the time.
[02:39:57.970 --> 02:40:00.270]  By the way, he's fired all the lobbyists.
[02:40:00.270 --> 02:40:01.170]  Nobody's ever done this.
[02:40:01.170 --> 02:40:03.311]  He's totally trying to do the best deal for the people.
[02:40:03.991 --> 02:40:05.452]  It's what everybody always asks for.
[02:40:05.452 --> 02:40:07.174]  And then all the evils attacking him.
[02:40:07.174 --> 02:40:09.336]  In fact, I want to go to phone calls, but I just have to do it.
[02:40:09.336 --> 02:40:10.817]  I have to find the article, I'm going to get mad.
[02:40:10.817 --> 02:40:12.298]  Document Cam Shot, I'm just going to read headlines.
[02:40:12.298 --> 02:40:14.380]  Document Cam Shot, right here please.
[02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:17.842]  Former CIA analyst, Obama gave green light for NSA, CIA to sabotage Trump.
[02:40:17.842 --> 02:40:19.484]  We already covered that, it's been censored.
[02:40:19.484 --> 02:40:22.146]  Rand Paul public will live in fear after Vault 7.
[02:40:22.146 --> 02:40:23.127]  Facebook, ban that article.
[02:40:24.875 --> 02:40:27.916]  This leaked document will stop Obamacare if it goes viral.
[02:40:27.916 --> 02:40:30.377]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, new article, very, very important.
[02:40:30.377 --> 02:40:32.118]  How they robbed, all this different stuff.
[02:40:32.118 --> 02:40:35.599]  Donald Trump to lawmakers, no more excuses on Obamacare.
[02:40:35.599 --> 02:40:36.440]  Repeal it.
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:39.081]  Conservatives, Libertarians, bash Obamacare lie.
[02:40:39.081 --> 02:40:40.401]  I agree, it should be better.
[02:40:40.401 --> 02:40:45.623]  GOP plan launches orders insurers to charge people 30% more of it uninsured.
[02:40:45.623 --> 02:40:50.145]  Yeah, that's wrong, that's the Republicans, Paul Ryan and them doing that.
[02:40:50.145 --> 02:40:52.226]  Docs prove Obamacare designed to destroy middle class.
[02:40:54.963 --> 02:40:58.066]  Did 10-year-old flash racist hand gesture while posing with Trump.
[02:40:58.066 --> 02:40:59.347]  This is supposedly racist now.
[02:40:59.347 --> 02:41:01.929]  Saying, okay.
[02:41:01.929 --> 02:41:04.571]  Obama deployed dozen strong team to keep tabs on Trump.
[02:41:04.571 --> 02:41:06.353]  I'm going to do every hell until I find it.
[02:41:06.353 --> 02:41:09.155]  Watch kids go crazy at Trump.
[02:41:09.155 --> 02:41:13.639]  Report US troops deployed in Syria to respond to Turkish threat.
[02:41:13.639 --> 02:41:16.782]  DC Insider, Trump must appoint more loyalists.
[02:41:16.782 --> 02:41:17.863]  So that's some of those headlines.
[02:41:17.863 --> 02:41:18.844]  I'm going to keep going until I find it.
[02:41:20.250 --> 02:41:20.890]  Okay, there it is.
[02:41:20.890 --> 02:41:21.250]  Alert.
[02:41:21.250 --> 02:41:24.971]  Facebook implements internet censorship regime and is already targeting alternative media.
[02:41:24.971 --> 02:41:25.792]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[02:41:25.792 --> 02:41:27.512]  I mean, I get that's out.
[02:41:27.512 --> 02:41:28.653]  I have them in USA Today.
[02:41:28.653 --> 02:41:34.774]  I have the article where they brag to China, look, we censored here, you can trust us.
[02:41:34.774 --> 02:41:36.915]  It's like, you know, it's the biggest mass murders in history.
[02:41:36.915 --> 02:41:41.717]  Zuckerberg is bragging that, look, I'm already censoring in America, you can trust me.
[02:41:41.717 --> 02:41:44.698]  They're using us as a way to get into China to test censorship.
[02:41:44.698 --> 02:41:45.538]  It's not even a news item.
[02:41:45.538 --> 02:41:45.758]  Here it is.
[02:41:47.380 --> 02:41:50.924]  290,000 jobs created in Trump's first month, shattering expectations.
[02:41:50.924 --> 02:41:53.966]  BBC tells Facebook about child porn on the network.
[02:41:53.966 --> 02:41:56.288]  Facebook reports BBC to police.
[02:41:56.288 --> 02:41:59.531]  Didn't they ban all the police gates, I mean the pizza gates?
[02:41:59.531 --> 02:42:00.672]  Absolutely.
[02:42:00.672 --> 02:42:02.294]  They only report on Trump busting them.
[02:42:02.294 --> 02:42:05.036]  Napolitano, Trump first president to confront the state.
[02:42:05.036 --> 02:42:06.938]  Hillary campaign manager admits to wiretaps.
[02:42:06.938 --> 02:42:08.940]  Let's slip, he knows more than he probably should.
[02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:15.624]  Podesta didn't register as a foreign agent when he represented a bank with ties to Russia's spy agency.
[02:42:15.624 --> 02:42:20.327]  Germany refugees riot over lack of phone signal.
[02:42:20.327 --> 02:42:21.228]  I'm going to find it, okay?
[02:42:21.228 --> 02:42:23.769]  I'm going to find where he brags to China, okay?
[02:42:23.769 --> 02:42:27.291]  I'm going to go to your calls, but I've just got to show you all these articles here.
[02:42:27.291 --> 02:42:28.252]  Let's go to this big stack.
[02:42:28.252 --> 02:42:29.293]  Let's keep going here.
[02:42:30.185 --> 02:42:33.466]  Trump wiretapped tweets raises risk of impeachment.
[02:42:33.466 --> 02:42:36.568]  They're wiretapping everybody and they say he says it's happening so he's being impeached.
[02:42:36.568 --> 02:42:40.829]  I mean, what a bunch of scumbags think they control reality at the Bloomberg.
[02:42:40.829 --> 02:42:42.490]  Facebook denies censoring conservative news.
[02:42:42.490 --> 02:42:43.550]  That's from a year ago.
[02:42:43.550 --> 02:42:47.172]  Facebook builds censorship tool but is no closer to entering China.
[02:42:47.172 --> 02:42:47.552]  Here it is.
[02:42:49.295 --> 02:42:51.256]  This is out of Bloomberg?
[02:42:51.256 --> 02:42:52.417]  Yeah, Bloomberg.
[02:42:52.417 --> 02:42:56.579]  And it goes on to say, we built the tool, we're going to use it on America, please let us in China.
[02:42:56.579 --> 02:42:58.040]  There it is.
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:00.802]  I mean, these people are sick.
[02:43:00.802 --> 02:43:02.643]  Facebook is flagging disputed fake news.
[02:43:02.643 --> 02:43:04.164]  This is Sunday.
[02:43:04.164 --> 02:43:07.205]  But they didn't just dispute our news, they just blocked it.
[02:43:07.205 --> 02:43:09.607]  They just blocked Rand Paul on the show.
[02:43:09.607 --> 02:43:11.568]  Because they don't want people to see us as credible.
[02:43:12.383 --> 02:43:13.464]  Because we're the opposite.
[02:43:13.464 --> 02:43:14.005]  We're totally credible.
[02:43:14.005 --> 02:43:20.791]  They don't let people share anything with... WikiLeaks unveils Vault 7, the largest ever publication of confiscated CIA documents.
[02:43:20.791 --> 02:43:23.854]  Yeah, they want you on Facebook so they can censor you.
[02:43:23.854 --> 02:43:25.716]  So people ask me, why are you on Facebook?
[02:43:25.716 --> 02:43:29.460]  To get people away from it to InfoWars or Drudge.
[02:43:29.460 --> 02:43:30.461]  Why do I love Drudge so much?
[02:43:30.461 --> 02:43:31.462]  They shut me off everywhere else.
[02:43:31.462 --> 02:43:32.143]  I'll at least have that.
[02:43:32.143 --> 02:43:34.685]  And we're down to this, folks.
[02:43:34.685 --> 02:43:35.426]  This isn't a game.
[02:43:38.971 --> 02:43:39.851]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[02:43:39.851 --> 02:43:40.432]  How's that, son?
[02:43:40.432 --> 02:43:41.532]  Sounds good to me.

[02:44:04.361 --> 02:44:07.103]  Okay, Kevin in West Virginia.
[02:44:07.103 --> 02:44:08.685]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:44:08.685 --> 02:44:10.766]  Go ahead.
[02:44:10.766 --> 02:44:13.248]  Hey, I'm Alex and I'm Dr. Group.
[02:44:13.248 --> 02:44:17.612]  I was wondering if I have what's called retinitis pigmentosa.
[02:44:17.612 --> 02:44:22.436]  I'm losing my eyesight and I was wondering if vaccines was a link to that.
[02:44:23.669 --> 02:44:25.170]  Yeah, it's very possible.
[02:44:25.170 --> 02:44:28.573]  We're talking about fungus, too, and mold.
[02:44:28.573 --> 02:44:33.498]  Actually, a lot of people go blind and have eye problems all the time.
[02:44:33.498 --> 02:44:37.822]  Well, the flu shot says on the insert it can cause type 1 diabetes.
[02:44:37.822 --> 02:44:38.903]  They claim it's genetic.
[02:44:38.903 --> 02:44:39.823]  It kills your pancreas.
[02:44:39.823 --> 02:44:40.044]  Go ahead.
[02:44:40.524 --> 02:44:41.345]  Yes, yes.
[02:44:41.345 --> 02:44:53.134]  I mean, I would definitely say there might be a link with that, but I can tell you that a lot of people are using a hexane-free castor oil.
[02:44:53.134 --> 02:44:58.538]  I don't know if you've tried that, putting that in your eyes, but it works really good and actually has been shown with research.
[02:44:58.538 --> 02:44:59.339]  What is it?
[02:44:59.339 --> 02:45:02.841]  It's a hexane-free certified organic castor oil.
[02:45:02.841 --> 02:45:06.144]  You know, castor oil's been used for ages for detoxifying.
[02:45:06.144 --> 02:45:06.604]  What is it?
[02:45:06.604 --> 02:45:08.286]  Do the rings and cones get oxidized?
[02:45:09.102 --> 02:45:09.622]  I've read about it.
[02:45:09.622 --> 02:45:12.525]  Well, it just depends on your environment that you're in.
[02:45:12.525 --> 02:45:14.166]  It depends on your work environment.
[02:45:14.166 --> 02:45:20.451]  It depends on... I mean, now you're starting to see people that have eye conditions from being in front of a computer screen all day long.
[02:45:20.451 --> 02:45:23.993]  Electromagnetic radiation next to the eyes.
[02:45:23.993 --> 02:45:25.855]  Neurological disorders are off the chart.
[02:45:26.235 --> 02:45:31.137]  When you're sleeping at night, a lot of people have excess dust mites that are causing eye problems in their bed.
[02:45:31.137 --> 02:45:35.899]  They're saying a pillow 10 years old can contain hundreds of thousands of dust mites.
[02:45:35.899 --> 02:45:41.361]  People with pets... Oh yeah, you need to get the type of fabric that knocks those out and replace what you're bedding every year.
[02:45:42.671 --> 02:45:53.777]  Yeah, I would say, well, now they have dust mite free bedding, but I would definitely recommend not sleeping on one of those memory foam mattresses, which contain high levels of fire retardants.
[02:45:53.777 --> 02:45:55.818]  Bedrooms can be a very toxic place.
[02:45:55.818 --> 02:45:59.240]  That's one of the reasons why I say clean your bedroom up first.
[02:45:59.240 --> 02:46:04.182]  Get all non-toxic stuff, put some plants in your bedroom, air purification systems.
[02:46:04.182 --> 02:46:08.144]  You know, when you're sleeping at night, you need a good environment to sleep.
[02:46:08.144 --> 02:46:08.784]  Absolutely.
[02:46:08.784 --> 02:46:09.345]  Thank you, Kevin.
[02:46:11.886 --> 02:46:15.070]  Delton in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:46:15.070 --> 02:46:16.171]  Hello, Alex.
[02:46:16.171 --> 02:46:16.831]  Welcome.
[02:46:16.831 --> 02:46:19.655]  Dr. Group.
[02:46:19.655 --> 02:46:20.275]  Can you hear me?
[02:46:20.275 --> 02:46:21.356]  Yes, we have Delton.
[02:46:21.356 --> 02:46:26.041]  I had two questions.
[02:46:26.041 --> 02:46:30.987]  First question was, how can you test the levels of the fungus in your body?
[02:46:30.987 --> 02:46:32.569]  Do they do a blood test?
[02:46:33.533 --> 02:46:34.833]  What do they do?
[02:46:34.833 --> 02:46:41.176]  Usually you have to go to a specialist, some sort of a doctor who specializes in environmental toxins.
[02:46:41.176 --> 02:46:42.196]  They're around everywhere.
[02:46:42.196 --> 02:46:45.617]  You can find them and then you can do a fungus panel.
[02:46:45.617 --> 02:46:52.099]  You can do saliva testing as well as blood testing or the current testing methods that are available out there.
[02:46:52.099 --> 02:47:01.202]  And then my second question was, I live here in Houston and my father, he passed away from cancer.
[02:47:01.889 --> 02:47:11.799]  And uh so I started you know digging around searching around and doing different things and uh I actually uh came across a Dr. Brzezinski or Brzezowski.
[02:47:11.799 --> 02:47:18.846]  He has like a protein that's somehow supposed to help attack the cancer cells.
[02:47:18.846 --> 02:47:19.547]  Have you ever heard of
[02:47:20.819 --> 02:47:22.039]  Or worked with him?
[02:47:22.039 --> 02:47:22.880]  Everybody's heard of him.
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:24.300]  He's had some really good results.
[02:47:24.300 --> 02:47:34.083]  As a matter of fact, he just had a court case last week and they were trying to take away his medical license and he ended up being on probation, which is just absolutely sick.
[02:47:34.083 --> 02:47:38.404]  And I hope that this new administration actually puts in some protection for some of these doctors.
[02:47:38.404 --> 02:47:39.684]  Yeah, we're never going to have innovation.
[02:47:39.844 --> 02:47:43.547]  I mean, he was on 60 Minutes 20 years ago.
[02:47:43.547 --> 02:47:49.511]  Yeah, he's been using what he calls anti-neoplastins and I do know Dr. Brzezinski and I talked to him.
[02:47:49.511 --> 02:48:00.159]  His office is down the road from mine and he's a great guy and he's devoted his life to working with alternative or natural methods that work.
[02:48:00.159 --> 02:48:05.023]  I mean, 20 years ago, MD Anderson had a 4% success rate with cancer and
[02:48:06.090 --> 02:48:10.673]  You know, chemotherapy and radiation are not the answer.
[02:48:10.673 --> 02:48:12.895]  There's plenty of different doctors.
[02:48:12.895 --> 02:48:14.716]  I talk to doctors all over the world.
[02:48:14.716 --> 02:48:16.458]  Let's expand on this.
[02:48:16.458 --> 02:48:18.179]  The globalists want to depopulate.
[02:48:18.179 --> 02:48:19.900]  Trump talks about suppressed technologies.
[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:21.461]  He knows as president now.
[02:48:21.461 --> 02:48:23.122]  He wants to start releasing more of this.
[02:48:23.122 --> 02:48:24.343]  Thank you, Caller.
[02:48:24.343 --> 02:48:25.044]  Look at this article.
[02:48:25.544 --> 02:48:26.185]  Not with her.
[02:48:26.185 --> 02:48:29.788]  Hillary Clinton bombs in New York City mayoral race polling.
[02:48:29.788 --> 02:48:30.408]  Punch that up.
[02:48:30.408 --> 02:48:31.229]  Look how sick she looks.
[02:48:31.229 --> 02:48:33.171]  She looks like she's dead.
[02:48:33.171 --> 02:48:34.752]  And she's so arrogant.
[02:48:34.752 --> 02:48:36.414]  She's way behind everybody in the poll.
[02:48:36.414 --> 02:48:37.154]  No one wants her.
[02:48:37.154 --> 02:48:38.435]  Even liberal New Yorkers.
[02:48:38.435 --> 02:48:40.257]  Again, the elites aren't perfect.
[02:48:40.257 --> 02:48:42.899]  Their arrogance destroys them.
[02:48:42.899 --> 02:48:45.361]  They believe everybody belongs to them.
[02:48:45.361 --> 02:48:47.063]  They believe they're God.
[02:48:47.063 --> 02:48:48.624]  They believe they rule.
[02:48:48.624 --> 02:48:49.345]  And they don't.
[02:48:49.345 --> 02:48:51.066]  That's why they can be defeated, folks.
[02:48:51.803 --> 02:48:54.026]  People need to stop thinking they're so powerful.
[02:48:54.026 --> 02:49:00.153]  Alright, let's go to Alex in Michigan, Azeem in Florida, and Jay in Colorado, Mike and others.
[02:49:00.153 --> 02:49:03.877]  Alex in Michigan, you're on the air with Dr. Evergroot.
[02:49:03.877 --> 02:49:10.384]  Hello, I just want to say thank you, Alex, for articulating, giving a voice to people who can't really explain the problem.
[02:49:11.186 --> 02:49:11.627]  Thank you, brother.
[02:49:11.627 --> 02:49:12.488]  We're all in this together.
[02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:29.484]  Cordyceps mushrooms are amazing for the lungs, for lung detox.
[02:49:29.484 --> 02:49:30.686]  You should be taking that, Alex.
[02:49:30.686 --> 02:49:32.508]  Cordyceps mushrooms.
[02:49:32.508 --> 02:49:36.173]  I believe Russian Olympics.
[02:49:36.173 --> 02:49:37.775]  There's also the good funguses.
[02:49:37.775 --> 02:49:38.657]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:49:38.657 --> 02:49:41.180]  I'm a big fan of all the different mushroom
[02:49:42.902 --> 02:49:43.763]  Okay, Reishi mushroom is amazing.
[02:50:07.938 --> 02:50:08.879]  Chaga mushroom.
[02:50:08.879 --> 02:50:10.240]  You guys got that in the bone broth.
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:11.321]  That's amazing.
[02:50:11.321 --> 02:50:15.945]  It's got the betulinic acid from the birch trees, which is amazing.
[02:50:15.945 --> 02:50:19.148]  AHCC is being studied in Japan.
[02:50:19.148 --> 02:50:22.010]  That's active hexose-correlated compound.
[02:50:22.010 --> 02:50:23.011]  And they have a patent on it.
[02:50:23.011 --> 02:50:24.452]  The Japanese do.
[02:50:24.452 --> 02:50:25.413]  And it's amazing.
[02:50:25.413 --> 02:50:28.716]  A lot of cancer patients are taking that there, and it's done wonders for a lot of people.
[02:50:30.520 --> 02:50:35.123]  Yeah, the AHCC has been around for about 15, no more than that, probably about 20 years.
[02:50:35.123 --> 02:50:47.492]  We were doing research with that actually when we were doing, when I was involved with a alternative cancer research team back in the mid-90s and that was a new exciting product that was out.
[02:50:47.492 --> 02:50:48.893]  So keep going on the mushrooms, brother!
[02:50:48.893 --> 02:50:54.738]  Yep, and AHCC, that is the mycelium of the mushrooms, like the actual root of the mushrooms.
[02:50:57.731 --> 02:51:00.012]  Yeah, and you just extract that into a tea or whatever.
[02:51:00.012 --> 02:51:03.213]  Yeah, you do that with reishi and chaga.
[02:51:03.213 --> 02:51:06.214]  A lot of the medicinal mushrooms, you can't really heat them.
[02:51:06.214 --> 02:51:08.415]  You have to extract them.
[02:51:08.415 --> 02:51:13.096]  They're really hard, like chaga and reishi.
[02:51:13.096 --> 02:51:13.836]  Those are amazing.
[02:51:13.836 --> 02:51:15.377]  It's almost morel season.
[02:51:15.377 --> 02:51:18.298]  I encourage everyone to pick morels and eat wild morel mushrooms.
[02:51:20.443 --> 02:51:21.964]  I was going to ask you about morels.
[02:51:21.964 --> 02:51:24.706]  You know, we've been looking, and it's a very expensive mushroom.
[02:51:24.706 --> 02:51:28.629]  I love morel mushrooms, but it's very therapeutic.
[02:51:28.629 --> 02:51:35.973]  And we were thinking about actually putting some morels in a formula, but... God's given us incredible magic on this magic planet.
[02:51:35.973 --> 02:51:37.434]  It's a luxury item.
[02:51:37.434 --> 02:51:39.936]  Why is the fungus getting out of control, the bad ones?
[02:51:39.936 --> 02:51:40.856]  Why is it spreading everywhere?
[02:51:40.856 --> 02:51:42.518]  They admit it's like killing everything.
[02:51:42.518 --> 02:51:45.159]  Yeah, I think it's just the... Like most of the bats are dead from it.
[02:51:45.159 --> 02:51:47.000]  Yeah, the conditions everywhere, and, well,
[02:51:48.628 --> 02:51:55.115]  You know, there's been reports and there's been testing done that it's being sprayed in chemtrails.
[02:51:55.115 --> 02:51:57.678]  It's also a bio-weapon.
[02:51:57.678 --> 02:52:01.842]  Mushrooms and good fungus have some of the most incredible compounds on earth, they admit.
[02:52:01.842 --> 02:52:04.585]  So it's like the best thing in the world and the worst thing.
[02:52:05.731 --> 02:52:20.408]  Yeah, I mean, not only are funguses for people as a bioweapon, but they've been used against crops, especially like in Vietnam, they used a rice fungus to knock out... The CIA famously even puts funguses on the legs of insects.
[02:52:20.728 --> 02:52:21.228]  On food.
[02:52:21.228 --> 02:52:27.352]  If you take away a people's food supply, you're going to cripple that population.
[02:52:27.352 --> 02:52:31.615]  So, it's not like we're going to put the fungus here in your body.
[02:52:31.615 --> 02:52:33.956]  We're going to put the fungus on the food.
[02:52:33.956 --> 02:52:37.739]  It was used to wipe out the opium plant as well.
[02:52:37.739 --> 02:52:38.619]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:52:38.619 --> 02:52:38.879]  Great points.
[02:52:38.879 --> 02:52:39.300]  Azeem in Florida.
[02:52:39.300 --> 02:52:40.120]  You're on the air.
[02:52:40.120 --> 02:52:40.660]  Thanks for holding.
[02:52:46.175 --> 02:52:46.996]  Hello.
[02:52:46.996 --> 02:52:48.217]  Hi, Alex.
[02:52:48.217 --> 02:52:50.098]  I'm Adeem from Orlando, Florida.
[02:52:50.098 --> 02:52:56.863]  I actually live in the actual area where Trump recently came and visited the school in the Pine Nose area.
[02:52:56.863 --> 02:52:58.965]  It was a very exciting time.
[02:52:58.965 --> 02:53:01.526]  I wasn't able to actually see him there, but it was kind of cool to actually see him.
[02:53:01.526 --> 02:53:02.467]  Well, thank you for calling in.
[02:53:02.467 --> 02:53:04.549]  What's on your mind on this Wednesday edition?
[02:53:06.042 --> 02:53:16.000]  Uh, what's on my mind right now is that the craziness with Obama right now and the fact that all of this stuff is coming about, about the stuff that he's been doing illegally with the
[02:53:17.074 --> 02:53:18.615]  Yeah, that's a question.
[02:53:18.615 --> 02:53:20.196]  Why is Obama so arrogant?
[02:53:20.196 --> 02:53:21.938]  And the rest of the globalists and Hillary?
[02:53:21.938 --> 02:53:23.459]  Maybe they're just delusional?
[02:53:45.833 --> 02:53:47.541]  I think the majority of...
[02:53:48.883 --> 02:53:55.125]  The people in the Obama administration might and hopefully will be locked up for everything that they've done.
[02:53:55.125 --> 02:54:16.254]  I mean, everybody thinks that, oh, we were living in such great times, but don't forget, these are the administrations that supported genetically modified foods, supported the use of herbicides and insecticides, supports the use of fluoride, supported the use of everything that was designed to dumb down the population, kill the population, and they continued to
[02:54:17.034 --> 02:54:23.640]  Progress forward in that in that manner to reduce the population and to continue to destroy the planet.
[02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:30.186]  So I mean, I don't you know, people are all in a hype about Trump, but look what the past administrations have done to us.
[02:54:30.186 --> 02:54:34.030]  Look what they've done to the... We have a society that's sterile right now.
[02:54:34.030 --> 02:54:36.432]  Almost 300,000 new jobs in just a month and a half.
[02:54:37.773 --> 02:54:45.117]  Trillions in the stock market, hundreds of billions of new jobs, just cutting off the globalist programs that were designed so you couldn't work here in the U.S.
[02:54:45.117 --> 02:54:49.039]  He is taking the globalist boot off our neck.
[02:54:49.039 --> 02:54:53.261]  Yeah, I mean, this is the first time, you know, that we can progress.
[02:54:53.261 --> 02:54:56.782]  We're at the point of no return almost with health care.
[02:54:56.782 --> 02:55:00.664]  You know, we talk about all these trillions and trillions of dollars being spent on health care.
[02:55:00.664 --> 02:55:03.025]  Well, they're creating the trillions of dollars.
[02:55:03.025 --> 02:55:03.746]  No, exactly.
[02:55:03.746 --> 02:55:06.247]  But I mean, if Trump was doing bad stuff, I'd come out against it.
[02:55:07.011 --> 02:55:08.992]  And he was wrong on torture, he backed off that.
[02:55:08.992 --> 02:55:13.416]  I don't like this new, this bill's better than Obamacare, but you know, what the Republicans came up with was pretty bad.
[02:55:13.416 --> 02:55:20.501]  He's saying it's a negotiation, but I mean, you know, so if Trump does bad stuff, I'll expose it, but I mean, I just can't believe this is so real.
[02:55:20.501 --> 02:55:22.382]  But again, there's not just evil in the world, folks.
[02:55:22.382 --> 02:55:23.263]  That's what's happening.
[02:55:23.263 --> 02:55:24.624]  Thank you, Azeem, great points.
[02:55:24.624 --> 02:55:27.726]  Jay, Jay in Colorado, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:55:29.151 --> 02:55:33.032]  Alex, Dr. Grew, big fan, been listening for over 20 years.
[02:55:33.032 --> 02:55:34.313]  I'm a huge Info Warrior.
[02:55:34.313 --> 02:55:34.893]  Thank you.
[02:55:34.893 --> 02:55:38.194]  I'm on permanent disability and I'm home every day.
[02:55:38.194 --> 02:55:42.816]  So I basically work 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week, spreading Info Warrior's links.
[02:55:42.816 --> 02:55:48.538]  Well, you're having a big effect because they're trying to shut us down with the algorithms, so you're in a big battle.
[02:55:48.538 --> 02:55:48.818]  Thank you.
[02:55:49.915 --> 02:55:52.336]  Dr. Group, I think you hit the nail on the head here.
[02:55:52.336 --> 02:55:53.797]  I hope Trump listens to you.
[02:55:53.797 --> 02:55:57.279]  This is a major concern of mine with my health.
[02:55:57.279 --> 02:55:59.840]  I'm a five-year cancer survivor.
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:01.441]  I use as many products as I can.
[02:56:01.441 --> 02:56:04.643]  I'm on a very limited income.
[02:56:04.643 --> 02:56:10.226]  But I think Trump needs to really address things from a completely different perspective and completely just
[02:56:10.846 --> 02:56:16.608]  It's all the people that are standing up that have been creating change.
[02:56:16.608 --> 02:56:22.849]  It's everybody creating and educating the public about all these things that have created the change.
[02:56:22.849 --> 02:56:24.670]  Like all of the March Against Monsanto, for example.
[02:56:38.593 --> 02:56:41.314]  They're just going to keep going on and going on.
[02:56:41.314 --> 02:56:42.194]  Hopefully not, though.
[02:56:42.194 --> 02:56:44.315]  I mean, I'm talking about the last regime.
[02:56:44.315 --> 02:56:53.358]  But now, I mean, because you still have infiltrators in there, too, Alex, that we need to get rid of, like McCain and the people that are just constantly giving- Paul Ryan.
[02:56:53.358 --> 02:57:00.220]  Yeah, Paul Ryan, that are just constantly, you know, butting heads with him on everything and coming- Oh, they admit he's the one that did this bill to sabotage Trump.
[02:57:00.220 --> 02:57:06.182]  But yeah, I'm hoping that, you know, we can address some of these issues and address the root cause of health care in America.
[02:57:06.182 --> 02:57:06.522]  Sure.
[02:57:06.522 --> 02:57:07.743]  Jay, the last minute or so, go ahead.
[02:57:09.198 --> 02:57:15.481]  Well, natural pathic health is the way to go, and that is the new tech.
[02:57:15.481 --> 02:57:19.283]  That is the secret that's hidden right in plain sight.
[02:57:19.283 --> 02:57:21.485]  So, Dr. Groot, thank you so much for what you're doing.
[02:57:21.485 --> 02:57:28.809]  I hope that InfoWars will consider some sort of disabled pricing for those of us that are on a lower income to be able to afford more of your products.
[02:57:28.809 --> 02:57:29.329]  No, I agree.
[02:57:29.329 --> 02:57:30.449]  I want to make them less expensive.
[02:57:30.449 --> 02:57:32.731]  The problem is getting the best ingredients is expensive.
[02:57:32.731 --> 02:57:35.972]  Mike and PA, a PhD chemist on Morgellons.
[02:57:35.972 --> 02:57:36.853]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:57:38.667 --> 02:57:39.748]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:57:39.748 --> 02:57:43.651]  Yeah, I just want to bring something to your attention, Dr. Group.
[02:57:43.651 --> 02:57:45.312]  Thank you for what you do.
[02:57:45.312 --> 02:57:46.773]  I didn't exactly get a Ph.D.
[02:57:46.773 --> 02:57:50.536]  from a community college, so I'm going to put this out real quick, and I hope you guys are listening.
[02:57:53.621 --> 02:57:59.684]  Zymek Corporation who's been putting out a machine that uses a quaternary ammonium solution to decontaminate areas.
[02:57:59.684 --> 02:58:09.328]  This is a direct correlation with Morgellons disease and the propagation of quaternary ammoniums throughout our society and what it's been used in conventional medicine.
[02:58:09.328 --> 02:58:12.169]  It has a direct result on a demyelination effect.
[02:58:12.169 --> 02:58:13.270]  So what's your point?
[02:58:13.270 --> 02:58:15.371]  What are you talking about Morgellons?
[02:58:16.972 --> 02:58:35.229]  So, my point on Morgellons disease is Morgellons disease is a direct result of an introduction of things such as barium salts and quaternary ammonium into the system through things such as chemtrailing and... Sure, and then weird stuff's growing in the atmosphere is what I've been told.
[02:58:36.110 --> 02:58:37.292]  Some weird geoengineering.
[02:58:37.292 --> 02:58:38.213]  This doesn't look human.
[02:58:38.213 --> 02:58:40.116]  Thanks for calling in and letting everybody know that.
[02:58:40.116 --> 02:58:41.418]  Come back and say more.
[02:58:41.418 --> 02:58:42.159]  Say, don't look human.
[02:58:42.159 --> 02:58:45.143]  All this stuff going on, like, people didn't come up with this.
[02:58:45.143 --> 02:58:48.228]  And I'm not into, like, green men and stuff, but this doesn't look normal.
[02:58:48.228 --> 02:58:49.209]  We'll be back with five more minutes.
[02:58:50.157 --> 02:58:57.624]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:58:57.624 --> 02:59:10.835]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:59:11.776 --> 02:59:23.671]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:59:23.671 --> 02:59:29.638]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[02:59:30.379 --> 02:59:39.381]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[02:59:39.381 --> 02:59:52.383]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[02:59:52.383 --> 02:59:55.004]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.490 --> 03:00:16.292]  They don't understand how it can be.
[03:00:16.292 --> 03:00:17.873]  Yeah!
[03:00:17.873 --> 03:00:23.077]  It's not my point of view.
[03:00:23.077 --> 03:00:24.218]  It's a fact!
[03:00:24.218 --> 03:00:26.960]  And you know it's true!
[03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:29.982]  Yeah, the CIA spying on you, so does the NSA.
[03:00:29.982 --> 03:00:32.644]  They say Trump should be impeached for saying it?
[03:00:32.644 --> 03:00:36.867]  I say God bless Trump for blowing this whole thing wide open.
[03:00:36.867 --> 03:00:39.869]  And God bless you for blowing it wide open, viewers and listeners.
[03:00:39.869 --> 03:00:41.370]  Believe me, the InfoWars audience,
[03:00:42.828 --> 03:00:50.492]  It didn't hype when I tell you, you're the tip of the spear, you're the wrecking ball, you're the blood and guts and the soul of this operation.
[03:00:50.492 --> 03:00:51.333]  So I salute you.
[03:00:51.333 --> 03:01:00.017]  I'll take a few more calls, because Roger Stone is late getting to the microphone, so I'm not cutting into Roger's time, folks.
[03:01:00.017 --> 03:01:00.477]  I'm just here.
[03:01:03.319 --> 03:01:04.800]  You never know what a hit product is going to be.
[03:01:04.800 --> 03:01:05.540]  I knew this one.
[03:01:05.540 --> 03:01:07.341]  You kept waiting for years to get it just right.
[03:01:07.341 --> 03:01:09.162]  You were telling me this was like four years ago.
[03:01:09.162 --> 03:01:12.844]  Micro ZX, anti-fungal, anti-yeast, now available.
[03:01:12.844 --> 03:01:17.146]  This is going to sell out very, very quickly, but it's got so many ingredients that are organic.
[03:01:17.146 --> 03:01:18.207]  Hope we can get more back in soon.
[03:01:18.427 --> 03:01:34.842]  Yeah, normally you take a supplement because you know you have something, but the problem that we're dealing with today is nobody really knows that they have yeast overgrowth, or fungus overgrowth, or mold overgrowth.
[03:01:34.842 --> 03:01:36.684]  So, you can just explain that you do.
[03:01:36.684 --> 03:01:38.266]  Everyone is a precaution, especially in the South.
[03:01:38.846 --> 03:01:38.946]  Yeah.
[03:01:38.946 --> 03:01:40.707]  But in really hot areas, you should take it.
[03:01:40.707 --> 03:01:41.888]  It doesn't matter where you are.
[03:01:41.888 --> 03:01:47.473]  I mean, I guarantee you could probably test 9 out of 10 people and they're going to have different types of mold and fungus and yeast in their body.
[03:01:47.473 --> 03:01:54.078]  And it's just another way to cleanse your body and reactivate your body's self-healing mechanism and get rid of that.
[03:01:54.078 --> 03:01:55.439]  Why is it called MycoZx?
[03:01:56.294 --> 03:02:03.661]  Well, myco is kind of a technical word for, you know, mycoplasm or mycofungus.
[03:02:03.661 --> 03:02:05.082]  You know, it's a fungus term.
[03:02:05.082 --> 03:02:06.864]  Let's go to Joel.
[03:02:06.864 --> 03:02:09.226]  I don't know where you came up with the ZX from, though.
[03:02:09.226 --> 03:02:10.267]  Joel in Washington.
[03:02:10.267 --> 03:02:10.807]  You're on the air.
[03:02:10.807 --> 03:02:11.068]  Go ahead.
[03:02:12.492 --> 03:02:14.394]  Hello Alex, Dr. Group.
[03:02:14.394 --> 03:02:34.854]  I had a question for Dr. Group, wondering if the biome defense culture is mesophilic or is it thermophilic, because I make cheese, I've got sheep and goats, I've made chevre and yogurt with it, but if it's a thermophilic culture, I can make a lot different other variety of cheeses.
[03:02:35.649 --> 03:02:39.614]  Yeah, I don't really have a detailed information on that for you yet.
[03:02:39.614 --> 03:02:41.878]  What, is he saying you can make cheese with this stuff?
[03:02:41.878 --> 03:02:52.092]  No, we've actually had, it's a good question, we've actually had some people doing some experimentation with that and we actually have all of that in testing and the reason why I say that is because
[03:02:53.163 --> 03:03:16.519]  Some of the probiotics that we use, and we also use certified organic gum acacia, and when we mix the product, we're doing stability testing right now, we're doing some of those thermophilic tests right now to determine if some of the probiotics are more active than others with heat or cold, and there's a possibility that it might not even need to be stored.
[03:03:16.519 --> 03:03:22.624]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but if you're filled with all these bad bacteria, yeast and stuff, bomb yourself with the known good ones.
[03:03:23.704 --> 03:03:24.885]  I mean, right?
[03:03:24.885 --> 03:03:35.790]  No, it's not necessarily known good ones, but it's select ones that you know that have been tested and studied that are hand-picked.
[03:03:35.790 --> 03:03:38.411]  Sure, Joel, this is all about my pay grade.
[03:03:38.411 --> 03:03:39.512]  What are you getting into exactly?
[03:03:39.512 --> 03:03:40.452]  Are you talking about yogurt culture?
[03:03:40.452 --> 03:03:42.213]  He's trying to be able to make culture.
[03:03:42.213 --> 03:03:47.936]  He's trying to use these probiotics to make, you know, because those are good sources of probiotics.
[03:03:47.936 --> 03:03:49.076]  Kombucha.
[03:03:49.076 --> 03:03:49.637]  No, I got it.
[03:03:49.637 --> 03:03:52.198]  So he wants to make cheese and stuff with good probiotics.
[03:03:52.458 --> 03:03:54.199]  That's what I'm getting, right, Joe?
[03:03:54.199 --> 03:03:57.620]  Right, and I've actually tried it, and it comes out really good.
[03:03:57.620 --> 03:04:01.241]  With the yogurt, it came out really nice and thick.
[03:04:01.241 --> 03:04:10.085]  The only thing is that it had a little bit of coloring because of the actual color of the probiotic, but I don't care about that.
[03:04:10.085 --> 03:04:12.745]  What was it, purple?
[03:04:12.745 --> 03:04:19.288]  Compared to the normal Chevre culture, it had a little more of a sweet flavor to it, which was actually quite good.
[03:04:19.853 --> 03:04:26.278]  Yeah, no, I mean, there's definitely not going to be anything that could be detrimental that I think would happen in there.
[03:04:26.278 --> 03:04:31.902]  I mean, ultimately, you're probably doing a good job in creating something that's going to be extremely beneficial to eat.
[03:04:31.902 --> 03:04:32.483]  That's smart.
[03:04:32.483 --> 03:04:34.164]  Probiotic cheese and stuff.
[03:04:34.164 --> 03:04:34.744]  That is.
[03:04:34.744 --> 03:04:39.108]  I mean, I know, like, they say all the, like, sauerkraut stuff already is probiotic.
[03:04:39.108 --> 03:04:44.291]  Yeah, they're just specific cultures, but to be able to experiment like that, I love what you're doing, Joel.
[03:04:44.291 --> 03:04:45.933]  I mean, that's... Alright, we're out of time.
[03:04:45.933 --> 03:04:46.393]  Thank you.
[03:04:46.393 --> 03:04:47.354]  I'm going to come and introduce
[03:04:47.834 --> 03:04:51.736]  It's definitely should be ready and then that'll be it.
[03:04:51.736 --> 03:04:53.337]  Thank you Dr. Ripper for another amazing product.
[03:04:53.337 --> 03:04:53.637]  Thank you.
[03:04:53.637 --> 03:04:54.358]  Appreciate it.
[03:04:54.358 --> 03:04:57.019]  Infowarslive.com listeners, thank you for all your support.
[03:04:57.019 --> 03:04:59.961]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:04:59.961 --> 03:05:12.047]  A previously debunked claim alleging then candidate Donald Trump ran a secret server to communicate with Russia during the 2016 presidential race has resurfaced.
[03:05:12.047 --> 03:05:15.589]  The establishment mainstream media is now rehashing the story
[03:05:15.589 --> 03:05:15.749]  I think?
[03:05:33.487 --> 03:05:34.187]  We're good to go.
[03:05:59.611 --> 03:06:02.994]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:06:02.994 --> 03:06:04.155]  They lost.
[03:06:04.155 --> 03:06:04.636]  We won.
[03:06:04.636 --> 03:06:10.821]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[03:06:10.821 --> 03:06:14.765]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[03:06:15.518 --> 03:06:21.241]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[03:06:21.241 --> 03:06:27.484]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:06:27.484 --> 03:06:32.886]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[03:06:32.886 --> 03:06:36.228]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:06:36.508 --> 03:06:37.669]  We're the solution!
[03:06:37.669 --> 03:06:38.670]  Americans!
[03:06:38.670 --> 03:06:40.212]  Ain't nothin' more to it than that!
[03:06:40.212 --> 03:06:45.577]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:06:45.577 --> 03:06:47.239]  Theatrical screening's on demand.
[03:06:47.239 --> 03:06:49.201]  DVD's now available.
[03:06:49.201 --> 03:06:52.604]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:06:52.604 --> 03:06:54.726]  Americans need to see this film.
[03:06:59.571 --> 03:07:07.837]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[03:07:07.837 --> 03:07:09.057]  A 360 win.
[03:07:09.057 --> 03:07:15.622]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[03:07:15.622 --> 03:07:23.147]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:07:23.547 --> 03:07:28.609]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:07:28.609 --> 03:07:34.731]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[03:07:34.731 --> 03:07:42.514]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:07:42.514 --> 03:07:49.717]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:07:49.717 --> 03:07:50.517]  10% off on auto ship.
[03:07:50.677 --> 03:07:53.120]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:53.120 --> 03:07:55.103]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[03:07:55.103 --> 03:07:58.967]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[03:08:12.958 --> 03:08:28.468]  From the InfoWars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in Occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the Technotronic... Roger Stone!
[03:08:32.719 --> 03:08:33.720]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:09:00.290 --> 03:09:09.360]  When we now have the Vault 7 release proving everything we've already reported, this is a crazy time to be alive.
[03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:14.405]  Roger Stone, where would you say we are politically in the history of man in 2017?
[03:09:14.405 --> 03:09:15.426]  Go ahead and take over.
[03:09:18.220 --> 03:09:30.876]  Well, Alex, I'm going to take your advice next week, because I think we could improve my segments with more political discussion, perhaps fewer guests, although I'm very pleased to have my guests with me today.
[03:09:31.872 --> 03:09:38.497]  Alex, I think we're on the cusp of the greatest single political scandal in American history.
[03:09:38.497 --> 03:09:42.459]  This makes Watergate pale in comparison.
[03:09:42.459 --> 03:09:48.864]  The compounded lies that are now devastating the establishment are interrelated.
[03:09:48.864 --> 03:09:54.528]  On the one hand, they clearly had the Republican candidate for president under surveillance.
[03:09:55.368 --> 03:10:06.698]  And at the exact same time, their rationale for doing so has been completely exposed as fraudulent and political.
[03:10:06.698 --> 03:10:11.922]  This could do to the Democratic Party what Watergate did to the Republican Party.
[03:10:11.922 --> 03:10:18.328]  It could have a devastating effect on the midterm elections, but I think very much like Watergate, Alex,
[03:10:19.168 --> 03:10:22.211]  It's going to take some time to get to the bottom of this.
[03:10:22.211 --> 03:10:25.713]  Remember, the Watergate break-in was in June.
[03:10:25.713 --> 03:10:31.498]  That November, Nixon carried 49 states stonewalling it against critics.
[03:10:31.498 --> 03:10:37.783]  It wasn't until almost a year and a half later that the entire Watergate cover-up collapsed.
[03:10:37.783 --> 03:10:40.665]  And that's how it will be here, in my opinion.
[03:10:40.665 --> 03:10:43.067]  All I know is a month ago, the New York Times was bragging that
[03:10:44.284 --> 03:10:47.950]  They've been surveilling Trump Tower and had all this stuff on Flynn.
[03:10:47.950 --> 03:10:49.172]  And then now they said they never did it.
[03:10:49.172 --> 03:10:50.214]  But I'm turning it over to you.
[03:10:50.214 --> 03:10:52.177]  You've got a full slate of big guests today.
[03:10:52.177 --> 03:10:53.400]  Roger Stone, go ahead.
[03:10:55.166 --> 03:11:00.970]  Alex, the New York Times turns out to be an unwitting handmaiden of the intelligence services.
[03:11:00.970 --> 03:11:15.760]  If you go back to their story on January 20th, and you go to their story several weeks ago, in both cases they were central intelligence sources say that they have emails
[03:11:16.500 --> 03:11:22.006]  Financial transaction records and telephone intercepts.
[03:11:22.006 --> 03:11:26.090]  And of course, the New York Times hasn't seen any of those.
[03:11:26.090 --> 03:11:30.854]  They haven't been produced for the American people to look at.
[03:11:30.854 --> 03:11:37.161]  And the Times just takes what the CIA says at face value, given their track record.
[03:11:37.911 --> 03:11:57.384]  of lying about torture in the Iraq war, lying about Benghazi, lying about rendition, lying about Iran-Contra, lying about weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein.
[03:11:57.384 --> 03:11:59.646]  I don't know why anyone would believe them.
[03:11:59.646 --> 03:12:03.208]  And now the chickens are coming home to roost.
[03:12:03.208 --> 03:12:06.470]  James, the
[03:12:08.251 --> 03:12:18.705]  Defense Intelligence Director for Obama coming out and saying that there was no spying and there was also no Russian
[03:12:21.184 --> 03:12:26.329]  Infiltration into the Trump campaign is an attempt to diffuse this.
[03:12:26.329 --> 03:12:28.872]  But I don't think that is going to work.
[03:12:28.872 --> 03:12:39.342]  And frankly, I think the entire Obama crew, as I wrote today at Stone Cold Truth, needs to be dragged in front of a grand jury to find out exactly what did happen.
[03:12:41.314 --> 03:12:42.235]  Show's yours, Roger.
[03:12:42.235 --> 03:12:43.556]  You got your guest waiting.
[03:12:43.556 --> 03:12:44.276]  Yes, indeed.
[03:12:44.276 --> 03:13:00.408]  So, I would like to focus first on the question of John Brennan, the CIA director, because this, in my opinion, he is the focal point of the disinformation campaign.
[03:13:00.408 --> 03:13:07.133]  You might have noticed last week in several different media publications, he came out and said, I am not the leaker.
[03:13:07.133 --> 03:13:08.354]  I am not the leaker.
[03:13:09.315 --> 03:13:17.279]  In Washington, as you know, Alex, when somebody announces that they are not the leaker, that means they are the leaker.
[03:13:17.279 --> 03:13:20.460]  The man doth protest too much.
[03:13:20.460 --> 03:13:37.208]  And therefore, joining us today from the American Spectator, we have George Neumeier, who has written a terrific piece, because we have talked a great deal at InfoWars about John Brennan's incredible background.
[03:13:37.928 --> 03:13:44.652]  And we have wondered how he got, you know, into the position of being CIA director.
[03:13:44.652 --> 03:13:56.738]  Just for the record, according to his wiki biography, Mr. Brennan was an active supporter of the Communist Party candidate for president, Gus Hall.
[03:13:56.738 --> 03:14:05.223]  And when I was on MSNBC only days ago, I was ridiculed for saying that Brennan, in his younger days, had been a communist.
[03:14:05.703 --> 03:14:13.978]  Thank you for joining us here, and we're delighted to have a fine representative of the American Spectator.
[03:14:13.978 --> 03:14:14.640]  Good to be with you.
[03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:15.261]  Thanks for having me.
[03:14:16.829 --> 03:14:41.127]  So, outline for us, if you would, this very important piece that you did that outlines, you know, the role of Mr. Brennan, who I believe is the linchpin, the chief conspirator in this effort to smear Donald Trump and to make the case that there was something nefarious about his election, when in fact it was the globalists
[03:14:41.587 --> 03:14:50.811]  Who were seeking to thwart the Constitution, smear Trump and steal this election for Hillary Clinton.
[03:14:50.811 --> 03:14:57.493]  Yeah, he is the genesis of the government's investigation into the Trump campaign.
[03:14:57.493 --> 03:15:06.117]  He received a half-baked piece of intelligence from an intelligence agency in one of the Baltic states, probably Estonia.
[03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:19.175]  And he used that to convince Comey and Loretta Lynch and the rest of the intelligence community to pursue a FISA court warrant that would allow the U.S.
[03:15:19.175 --> 03:15:21.939]  government to intercept communications from Trump Tower.
[03:15:23.914 --> 03:15:31.420]  Now, it is my understanding that the government first went to the FISA court in June.
[03:15:31.420 --> 03:15:36.564]  They asked for permission to wiretap, to surveil Trump Tower.
[03:15:36.564 --> 03:15:39.207]  They also asked for surveillance of three U.S.
[03:15:39.207 --> 03:15:51.837]  citizens, yours truly, Paul J. Manafort, and of course, Carter Page, whoever he is, some guy who managed to join a Trump issue advisory group.
[03:15:53.145 --> 03:16:11.544]  It's unclear whether the FISA court disallowed the tapping of Trump, but may have approved the surveillance of the three of us in June, or whether they turned down the entire request and only approved it in October.
[03:16:12.305 --> 03:16:28.859]  If that is the case, I think the clearest way for the President to clear the air on this entire matter is to order the release of all of the documents that were filed with the FISA Court.
[03:16:28.859 --> 03:16:36.065]  Yeah, that's right, and you'll notice that John Brennan has not said a word since Trump sent that tweet out on Sunday.
[03:16:36.065 --> 03:16:40.309]  You know, he's the person with the most information here, and he's said nothing.
[03:16:40.996 --> 03:16:44.799]  They've sent out Clapper because he doesn't know the whole story.
[03:16:44.799 --> 03:16:54.865]  It's almost like a repeat of the Susan Rice situation in Benghazi, where the Obama people send out the person with the least amount of information to deny the story.
[03:16:54.865 --> 03:17:04.512]  Well, what's interesting, of course, is that the sequence of events here, I'm convinced, is the President
[03:17:05.339 --> 03:17:10.182]  He gives an extraordinarily effective State of the Union address.
[03:17:10.182 --> 03:17:13.043]  He has wind in his sails.
[03:17:13.043 --> 03:17:27.391]  The intelligence community immediately leaks the Sessions meetings with the Russian ambassador in an attempt to break Trump's momentum.
[03:17:27.391 --> 03:17:34.115]  And then Donald Trump, who may be the single best political strategist in the country today on the basis of instinct,
[03:17:34.915 --> 03:17:36.396]  This is a classic example of the brilliance
[03:17:54.332 --> 03:18:08.961]  of Donald Trump and his unique understanding of the news cycle and particularly our highly charged cable television networks that of course cover this stuff ad nauseum.
[03:18:08.961 --> 03:18:10.762]  Trump is on the attack.
[03:18:10.762 --> 03:18:12.924]  Freedom is on the attack.
[03:18:12.924 --> 03:18:16.085]  The globalists are now in decline.
[03:18:16.085 --> 03:18:21.289]  The fact that they sought these warrants based on no evidence
[03:18:22.169 --> 03:18:23.850]  No probable cause.
[03:18:23.850 --> 03:18:27.332]  It is really extraordinary.
[03:18:27.332 --> 03:18:31.235]  As you know, George, it is very rare for a U.S.
[03:18:31.235 --> 03:18:35.737]  citizen to be the target of the FISA Court.
[03:18:35.737 --> 03:18:43.362]  Generally speaking, the FISA Court is used to wiretap foreign nationals within the United States.
[03:18:43.362 --> 03:18:45.083]  That has generally been the case.
[03:18:45.703 --> 03:18:57.948]  So, I'm very curious to know whether the warrants for Manafort, myself, and Page were approved in June or approved in October.
[03:18:57.948 --> 03:19:00.088]  George, where do you think this story goes?
[03:19:00.088 --> 03:19:03.750]  I know the President has called for a Congressional inquiry.
[03:19:04.711 --> 03:19:07.714]  I'm not sure that that's the best avenue, in all honesty.
[03:19:07.714 --> 03:19:13.740]  I think there's a high probability that such an inquiry would get highly politicized.
[03:19:13.740 --> 03:19:25.013]  And you'd have mindless fools like Elijah Cummings, who continues to insist that there is evidence, that there is proof, when of course there is none.
[03:19:25.013 --> 03:19:26.034]  Where do you think this goes?
[03:19:27.709 --> 03:19:33.794]  Well, I think, yeah, as you were saying, they're the people responsible for these leaks.
[03:19:33.794 --> 03:19:40.820]  So we've been hearing for six months now that the government has been investigating Trump campaign Russia ties.
[03:19:40.820 --> 03:19:43.302]  You know, George, I'm going to have to break you there.
[03:19:43.302 --> 03:19:44.684]  We'll come right back.
[03:19:44.684 --> 03:19:46.945]  We are going to go to a break here.
[03:19:46.945 --> 03:19:50.709]  And I want to remind people to hit the InfoWars store.
[03:19:51.289 --> 03:19:59.152]  For the important products there that paid for this broadcast and this effort to bring the American people the truth.
[03:19:59.152 --> 03:20:00.112]  The truth.
[03:20:00.112 --> 03:20:03.073]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's.
[03:20:03.073 --> 03:20:05.734]  In an epic battle of David versus Goliath.
[03:20:05.734 --> 03:20:08.135]  In the early 1980s, a child was born.
[03:20:08.135 --> 03:20:09.075]  Two of them, actually.
[03:20:09.075 --> 03:20:11.136]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[03:20:11.136 --> 03:20:15.517]  Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened.
[03:20:15.517 --> 03:20:17.638]  Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors.
[03:20:18.118 --> 03:20:22.103]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[03:20:22.103 --> 03:20:31.055]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers.
[03:20:31.055 --> 03:20:33.418]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[03:20:33.418 --> 03:20:34.940]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[03:20:35.601 --> 03:20:41.807]  Don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price.

[03:21:59.643 --> 03:22:01.025]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[03:22:01.025 --> 03:22:04.309]  I am a former congressman, physician, and presidential candidate.
[03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:05.831]  The world is in turmoil.
[03:22:05.831 --> 03:22:10.377]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars, and famines are commonplace.
[03:22:10.377 --> 03:22:13.481]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[03:22:13.481 --> 03:22:17.146]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[03:22:17.446 --> 03:22:21.848]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[03:22:21.848 --> 03:22:24.730]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[03:22:24.730 --> 03:22:28.452]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[03:22:28.452 --> 03:22:30.973]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[03:22:30.973 --> 03:22:34.575]  With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.

[03:22:41.799 --> 03:22:45.841]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.

[03:24:12.395 --> 03:24:16.156]  I'm Roger Stone, and thanks for joining us again at InfoWars.
[03:24:16.156 --> 03:24:24.037]  I want to return to George Neumeier of the American Spectator on the subject of CIA Director John Brennan.
[03:24:24.037 --> 03:24:29.338]  Where we left it off was trying to determine where this inquiry will go next.
[03:24:29.338 --> 03:24:39.440]  Whether it will be a congressional investigation that ultimately brings the Obama crew down, or whether perhaps Jeff Sessions will impanel a grand jury
[03:24:40.020 --> 03:24:46.164]  Yeah, I think either scenario that you sketched there is plausible, but I think the bottom line is, as you were saying,
[03:25:11.360 --> 03:25:15.482]  This is going to boomerang back on the criminal leakers.
[03:25:15.482 --> 03:25:22.886]  And I think the criminal leakers around John Brennan, and maybe even Brennan himself, are the most vulnerable here.
[03:25:22.886 --> 03:25:35.652]  Because it's going to come out that they went to their spinographers in the press, like David Ignatius at Washington Post, and they gave them information that was a violation of the law.
[03:25:37.409 --> 03:25:45.154]  I think Trump will ultimately be vindicated in terms of, we'll find out that at the very least, a U.S.
[03:25:45.154 --> 03:25:47.976]  government investigation into Trump Tower was initiated.
[03:25:47.976 --> 03:25:59.644]  Yeah, it would be ironic, of course, if... John Brennan was the instigator of it, on the basis of phony intelligence from one of these Baltic countries.
[03:26:02.046 --> 03:26:11.432]  It would be ironic, of course, if the FISA court warrant approval gives the administration a rubric of legality.
[03:26:11.432 --> 03:26:23.219]  That would not change the fact that the leaks, the leak regarding General Flynn and Russia, the leak regarding the FISA court's warrants themselves,
[03:26:24.379 --> 03:26:35.123]  Regarding Manafort and I, just those leaks are, as you know, a felony punishable by no less than 10 years in prison.
[03:26:35.123 --> 03:26:40.145]  So, you know, at the end of the day, as Harry Truman said, the buck stops here.
[03:26:41.465 --> 03:26:54.514]  And the ultimate responsibility, whether Barack Obama ordered the break-in, or I should say the surveillance or not, is really immaterial.
[03:26:54.514 --> 03:26:59.597]  Assuming that his Justice Department ordered it, which I think is probable,
[03:27:00.437 --> 03:27:07.703]  Uh, he is parsing words in a lawyer-like way to say that, oh, I didn't order it.
[03:27:07.703 --> 03:27:10.726]  I think he's disingenuous at best.
[03:27:10.726 --> 03:27:13.088]  And then the late collusion of Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:13.806 --> 03:27:26.001]  Who, you know, a week before the election says that computer scientists have determined that there is a server in Trump Tower that is in touch with the Russians.
[03:27:26.001 --> 03:27:30.086]  Well, clearly she has been tipped off by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:27:30.666 --> 03:27:43.091]  This makes Watergate look like child's play in terms of the unconstitutional and in fact evil intents of the entire operation.
[03:27:43.091 --> 03:27:52.274]  Again, we surveilled the Republican candidate for president based on a Hillary Clinton campaign press release.
[03:27:52.274 --> 03:27:53.114]  And that's it.
[03:27:53.114 --> 03:27:56.956]  That is their proof, folks, and that is not proof at all.
[03:27:59.778 --> 03:28:12.966]  And if you go back and you look at the BBC story, which was one of the stories that has served as the basis of all this discussion, it says that they got the information from a U.S.
[03:28:12.966 --> 03:28:16.067]  senior intelligence community member.
[03:28:16.067 --> 03:28:25.633]  And in that paragraph, it says that John Brennan started all of this with information from an intelligence agency in a Baltic country.
[03:28:26.397 --> 03:28:30.319]  So how did that BBC reporter get that piece of information?
[03:28:30.319 --> 03:28:37.022]  It had to come from either Brennan himself or somebody around Brennan.
[03:28:37.022 --> 03:28:39.783]  It is extraordinary that the Trump
[03:28:40.575 --> 03:28:54.786]  Administration has not moved in a speedier fashion to replace the many second and third level bureaucrats who are still infecting these agencies.
[03:28:54.786 --> 03:28:56.868]  That's where the leaks are coming.
[03:28:56.868 --> 03:29:00.090]  So the administration has a double problem now.
[03:29:00.090 --> 03:29:03.593]  Leaks out of the departments from Obama loyalists
[03:29:04.173 --> 03:29:10.846]  And then some limited leaks from his own White House from the established Republicans there that he has hired.
[03:29:12.114 --> 03:29:25.521]  Washington, as you know, has always been obsessed with leaks and leaking, but they have rarely found the perps because, of course, the news media continues to protect them.
[03:29:25.521 --> 03:29:37.268]  In any event, I thank you, George Neumeier, for joining us here on InfoWars.com, and we'll be right back to talk about the largest burgeoning scandal in American political history.
[03:29:49.231 --> 03:29:52.252]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.252 --> 03:30:00.055]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.055 --> 03:30:11.919]  A previously debunked claim alleging then-candidate Donald Trump ran a secret server to communicate with Russia during the 2016 presidential race has resurfaced.
[03:30:11.919 --> 03:30:15.620]  The establishment mainstream media is now rehashing the story
[03:30:15.640 --> 03:30:16.040]  We're good to go.
[03:30:43.757 --> 03:30:54.573]  To answer serious questions about his ties to Russia and she included a link to the original Slate article that started the bogus rumor to begin with.
[03:30:54.573 --> 03:30:58.618]  You can check out the real news right now at Infowars.com
[03:30:59.741 --> 03:31:00.562]  Hey, everyone!
[03:31:00.562 --> 03:31:02.843]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:31:02.843 --> 03:31:06.686]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:31:06.686 --> 03:31:08.768]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:31:08.768 --> 03:31:19.056]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:31:19.056 --> 03:31:25.041]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:31:25.501 --> 03:31:40.418]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[03:31:40.458 --> 03:31:40.859]  I think so.
[03:32:00.123 --> 03:32:01.703]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:32:01.703 --> 03:32:07.605]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[03:32:07.605 --> 03:32:10.145]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[03:32:10.145 --> 03:32:15.947]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[03:32:15.947 --> 03:32:21.668]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[03:32:22.088 --> 03:32:25.049]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:32:25.049 --> 03:32:30.611]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[03:32:30.611 --> 03:32:37.633]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[03:32:37.633 --> 03:32:42.195]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[03:32:42.475 --> 03:32:45.760]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[03:32:45.760 --> 03:32:47.863]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[03:32:47.863 --> 03:32:53.592]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[03:32:53.592 --> 03:32:56.015]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[03:32:56.015 --> 03:32:57.698]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[03:33:13.110 --> 03:33:20.179]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.179 --> 03:33:23.102]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:31.078 --> 03:33:32.621]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:33:32.621 --> 03:33:36.707]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:33:36.707 --> 03:33:41.455]  We are in the midst of the greatest single political scandal in American history.
[03:33:41.455 --> 03:33:45.582]  We see the globalists attempts to steal the election from Donald J. Trump.
[03:33:46.169 --> 03:33:50.010]  Crumbling before our very eyes.
[03:33:50.010 --> 03:34:05.116]  We are privileged to be alive at this time, but as we have seen, the mainstream media has grabbed the narrative of the government, the LA Times this weekend insisting on page one,
[03:34:05.854 --> 03:34:09.816]  That Donald Trump is wrong that there was no surveillance.
[03:34:09.816 --> 03:34:12.998]  This is why InfoWars is so important.
[03:34:12.998 --> 03:34:21.123]  This is why this inexorable quest for truth and quality investigative reporting deserves your support.
[03:34:21.801 --> 03:34:27.542]  And the best place you can do that, of course, is by going to the InfoWars.com store.
[03:34:27.542 --> 03:34:36.504]  Now, among the other fine items that you can purchase are my book, The Making of the President 2016.
[03:34:36.504 --> 03:34:47.706]  There is an outstanding offer that anyone who purchases through InfoWars, rather than, say, Amazon or some other outlet, will get a personally signed copy.
[03:34:48.647 --> 03:34:53.152]  I have provided signatures for 4,600 books so far.
[03:34:53.152 --> 03:34:57.516]  My hand hurts, but you can get a great price on this book.
[03:34:57.516 --> 03:34:59.879]  You can help the fight for freedom.
[03:34:59.879 --> 03:35:04.024]  You can help finance the first-rate investigative reporting.
[03:35:04.024 --> 03:35:08.489]  It's being done at InfoWars by going to the site and getting your copy there.
[03:35:09.575 --> 03:35:16.001]  Now, I'm going to be joined by a guest I had on the Stone Cold Truth Radio Show this past weekend.
[03:35:16.001 --> 03:35:29.592]  He is CIA whistleblower, I'm going to mispronounce your name here, John Kirkhio, I guess it is, who was very articulate and impressed me quite a bit on the show, which is why I asked him to be with us here today.
[03:35:29.592 --> 03:35:33.495]  And of course, what we want to talk about is Vault 7.
[03:35:34.736 --> 03:35:35.777]  That's right, folks.
[03:35:35.777 --> 03:35:48.145]  Thanks to WikiLeaks, once again, the Deep State's tactics and their ability to manipulate is there for all Americans to see.
[03:35:48.145 --> 03:35:49.866]  So, welcome to InfoWars.
[03:35:49.866 --> 03:35:51.527]  John, thanks for joining us.
[03:35:51.527 --> 03:35:52.267]  Thank you, Roger.
[03:35:52.267 --> 03:35:53.048]  Thanks for having me.
[03:35:54.349 --> 03:36:05.445]  So, outline for our listeners who, in the bustle of their everyday responsibilities, may not be fully aware of what Vault 7 has exposed.
[03:36:06.932 --> 03:36:15.940]  Vault 7 really is a very dramatic revelation, a very dramatic exposure of what the CIA has been up to between 2013 and 2016.
[03:36:15.940 --> 03:36:21.204]  That's Barack Obama's second term.
[03:36:21.204 --> 03:36:24.927]  Remember, the most transparent president in American history.
[03:36:24.927 --> 03:36:32.834]  Well, apparently the most transparent president in American history had ordered the CIA to develop hacks into the iPhone.
[03:36:33.434 --> 03:36:43.660]  Into the Google Android phone, into the Samsung Smart TV, and even into our cars, computer systems.
[03:36:43.660 --> 03:36:49.404]  Now, if you're an intelligence service and you're going after a hostile power, that's all great.
[03:36:49.404 --> 03:36:57.209]  If you're going after a terrorist group or you're trying to target the Iranians or the North Koreans, that's great.
[03:36:57.209 --> 03:37:00.311]  But what we don't know and what many of us suspect
[03:37:00.971 --> 03:37:08.060]  Is that the CIA was using this technology or these technologies to target American citizens.
[03:37:08.060 --> 03:37:17.313]  And for all we know, they may have even used this technology to target then candidate Donald Trump.
[03:37:17.313 --> 03:37:18.314]  It appears that way.
[03:37:19.654 --> 03:37:35.247]  It really should not be any surprise that your handheld device, that your television set, that so many of these electronic devices that we have in our homes and offices can be converted by the government to be listening devices.
[03:37:35.247 --> 03:37:46.397]  On the advice of an intelligence professional almost two years ago, when I'm having a particularly confidential conversation with, say, Alex Jones or someone else,
[03:37:46.977 --> 03:37:50.922]  I will turn the phone off and actually place it in another room.
[03:37:50.922 --> 03:37:56.208]  Now, some of my colleagues have told me that that's crazy, that's paranoia.
[03:37:56.208 --> 03:37:59.531]  No, I think it's technological reality.
[03:37:59.531 --> 03:38:01.433]  No, I'll tell you that's not good enough.
[03:38:02.114 --> 03:38:03.635]  That's not good enough!
[03:38:03.635 --> 03:38:23.964]  When I was at the CIA, and I'm talking about 10, 15, even 20 years ago, when I was at the CIA, it wasn't good enough to shut the phone off or put it into another room, because the CIA can remotely activate the phone so that it looks like it's off, but it's still functioning as a microphone.
[03:38:24.444 --> 03:38:38.682]  So, what we would do until the days when you could no longer take the battery out of a phone, if you couldn't take the battery out, you would put it in a freezer, and close the freezer, or refrigerator for that matter, or leave the phone in your car!
[03:38:39.423 --> 03:38:54.683]  Because the CIA from anywhere in the world, whether it's Langley, Virginia or somewhere overseas, they can activate that phone and activate the phone's camera and can record your whole conversation without you even realizing that the device is on.
[03:38:56.320 --> 03:39:11.262]  It seems to me that we've had a never-ending trail of the Central Intelligence Agency getting caught with misdeeds and lies, being dragged before the Congress and swearing they're really sorry, they'll never do it again.
[03:39:12.003 --> 03:39:17.244]  Then they go back to Langley and of course nothing ever, ever changes.
[03:39:17.244 --> 03:39:23.205]  I think the President would be wise to clean house at the CIA as soon as possible.
[03:39:23.205 --> 03:39:29.206]  I was rather surprised that in the inaugural week he went out to Langley and kissed their derriere.
[03:39:29.206 --> 03:39:31.507]  I would not have done so.
[03:39:31.507 --> 03:39:33.227]  They are the enemy.
[03:39:33.227 --> 03:39:36.588]  They are the tip of the spear for the globalists.
[03:39:37.328 --> 03:39:49.473]  And frankly, as they brought John Kennedy down, as they undermined Richard Nixon, they have every intention of undermining and delegitimizing this president.
[03:39:49.473 --> 03:39:55.356]  And keep in mind, Roger, that this is still very much Barack Obama's CIA.
[03:39:55.356 --> 03:40:04.200]  These people who rose to the senior-most levels of the CIA over the past eight years did so under President Barack Obama.
[03:40:04.700 --> 03:40:07.042]  They served under John Brennan.
[03:40:07.042 --> 03:40:09.984]  They served under David Petraeus.
[03:40:09.984 --> 03:40:20.813]  They served under, his name escapes me now, Obama's first CIA director, Leon Panetta.
[03:40:20.813 --> 03:40:24.816]  So these guys, while they're career intelligence officers, they came of age.
[03:40:25.817 --> 03:40:27.298]  Under Barack Obama.
[03:40:27.298 --> 03:40:36.282]  Now, Jimmy Carter, who was one of the most wildly unpopular presidents inside the CIA, was unpopular for a reason.
[03:40:36.282 --> 03:40:38.923]  And it was because he cleaned house.
[03:40:38.923 --> 03:40:50.809]  He got rid of a lot of the people who had been caught by the Church Committee committing assassinations and spying on Americans and doing all the things that the law of the land says the CIA should not be doing.
[03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:59.973]  What he ended up doing was firing literally hundreds of senior operations officers in something called the Friday Night Massacre.
[03:40:59.973 --> 03:41:03.455]  People at the CIA still talk about the Friday Night Massacre.
[03:41:03.455 --> 03:41:09.678]  The truth of the matter is, every once in a while, you need to carry out a massacre at the CIA.
[03:41:09.678 --> 03:41:19.523]  Because the organization becomes too politicized, it becomes too polarizing, and it ends up working against the interests of the President and the country.
[03:41:20.123 --> 03:41:22.745]  And you have to clean house.
[03:41:22.745 --> 03:41:41.215]  Well, as you'll recall, after Jimmy Carter appointed Stansfield Turner, the Admiral, as the head of the CIA, most of those who were canned in the massacre could later be found over at the George Bush for President headquarters in Virginia.
[03:41:41.215 --> 03:41:49.120]  And of course, almost all of them would make their way back into the agency after President Ronald Reagan made the mistake of letting George Bush
[03:41:49.660 --> 03:41:50.581]  We're good to go.
[03:42:12.213 --> 03:42:12.733]  What was it?
[03:42:12.733 --> 03:42:16.576]  Smash the agency into a million different pieces?
[03:42:16.576 --> 03:42:17.196]  Yes.
[03:42:17.196 --> 03:42:22.919]  Which I believe played a major role in his ultimate murder.
[03:42:22.919 --> 03:42:30.344]  I think it is a factor based on the Bear Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis in which the
[03:42:31.524 --> 03:42:50.326]  The CIA undermined Kennedy, and if you read my book, The Man Who Killed Kennedy, The Case Against LBJ, I think I make a compelling case, as did James Douglas in his book John F. Kennedy and the Unspeakable, that the CIA is indeed complicit right there.
[03:42:52.778 --> 03:43:03.421]  So the real question, I'm going to ask you the same thing I asked George Niemeyer from American Spectator, because as a CIA veteran, you have, I think, a good perspective on these things.
[03:43:03.421 --> 03:43:05.381]  Where does this go from here?
[03:43:05.381 --> 03:43:11.883]  Do you think a congressional inquiry will help us get at the truth?
[03:43:11.883 --> 03:43:14.643]  Or will this become a political circus?
[03:43:14.643 --> 03:43:16.784]  And should we have a judicial
[03:43:18.224 --> 03:43:38.833]  Uh, proceeding, uh, in which I think, uh, now that Jim, uh, pardon me, now that Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, has, uh, recused himself, I think prematurely, he still would have the authority to appoint a special prosecutor, somebody of impeccable integrity with a pristine reputation,
[03:43:39.617 --> 03:43:51.000]  Impale a grand jury and begin bringing the Obama security apparatus bosses in front of the grand jury one by one to find out what really happened here.
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:54.421]  And that is exactly my position.
[03:43:54.421 --> 03:43:56.702]  I don't trust Congress with this at all.
[03:43:56.702 --> 03:44:04.964]  And I think it's because Congress has proven really since the middle 1980s to be a little more than cheerleaders for the CIA.
[03:44:04.964 --> 03:44:07.345]  Dianne Feinstein, for example, when she was the
[03:44:07.665 --> 03:44:07.985]  We're good.
[03:44:24.174 --> 03:44:33.097]  Members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence see their jobs as that of just supporting CIA operations.
[03:44:33.097 --> 03:44:37.999]  We don't need any outside bodies to be supporting CIA operations right now.
[03:44:37.999 --> 03:44:41.881]  We need an organization that can find the truth, that can get to the facts,
[03:44:42.765 --> 03:44:45.606]  And determine what, if any, crimes were committed.
[03:44:45.606 --> 03:44:52.289]  And I think the only way to do that is with a special prosecutor and paneling a grand jury.
[03:44:52.289 --> 03:44:53.829]  I agree with you on that 100%.
[03:44:53.829 --> 03:45:07.575]  Well, it would certainly put so many in the intelligence network in a position where they could no longer dissemble for fear of a perjury charge.
[03:45:08.719 --> 03:45:19.064]  In fact, if you look back through history, it's only perjury charges and charges of contempt of Congress that have foiled CIA officers in the past.
[03:45:19.064 --> 03:45:25.747]  If you go all the way back to the 70s, it's those two charges that have wrapped people up.
[03:45:25.747 --> 03:45:27.087]  You're absolutely right.
[03:45:27.087 --> 03:45:34.991]  I'm thinking of the Defense Intelligence Director, James Clapper, under Barack Obama.
[03:45:34.991 --> 03:45:35.471]  As you know,
[03:45:36.269 --> 03:45:43.034]  He already got caught lying to Congress about how much metadata was being kept on American citizens.
[03:45:43.034 --> 03:45:48.718]  26 senators co-signed a letter accusing him of perjury.
[03:45:48.718 --> 03:45:52.401]  One senator demanded his resignation.
[03:45:52.401 --> 03:45:57.685]  The House leadership of the Intelligence Committee was in open revolt over his lies.
[03:45:58.445 --> 03:46:07.616]  Why should we now suddenly believe Mr. Clapper when he tries to make this all go away with an incredible double whammy of
[03:46:08.382 --> 03:46:17.209]  Well, we weren't surveilling the President, and there is no evidence that the Trump campaign was in touch with the Russians.
[03:46:17.209 --> 03:46:21.413]  This is an attempt to close the barn door after the horses have already escaped.
[03:46:21.413 --> 03:46:31.742]  He has already made this mess that the ashes of Langley are going to come crashing down around his head, and there's nothing now I think that they can do about it.
[03:46:32.262 --> 03:46:39.108]  This is as inexorable as Nixon's men being caught and being tied back to the Watergate break-in.
[03:46:39.108 --> 03:46:42.371]  It is only a matter of time.
[03:46:42.371 --> 03:46:49.258]  I say all the time that the CIA told us that they were not torturing prisoners.
[03:46:49.258 --> 03:46:50.519]  There was no torture program.
[03:46:50.519 --> 03:46:51.780]  That was a lie.
[03:46:51.780 --> 03:46:56.384]  The CIA said that there was no secret prison system being run outside the U.S.
[03:46:56.384 --> 03:46:57.045]  judiciary.
[03:46:57.045 --> 03:46:57.806]  That was a lie.
[03:46:58.240 --> 03:47:03.082]  The CIA said that they were not sending prisoners to third countries to undergo torture.
[03:47:03.082 --> 03:47:04.282]  That was a lie.
[03:47:04.282 --> 03:47:07.063]  The CIA said that it was the Russians that hacked the U.S.
[03:47:07.063 --> 03:47:09.944]  election and practically installed Donald Trump.
[03:47:09.944 --> 03:47:12.685]  Absolutely zero evidence that any of that was true.
[03:47:12.685 --> 03:47:15.386]  But now they want us to just take their word for it.
[03:47:15.386 --> 03:47:18.687]  That they're not spying on Americans and that they weren't spying on Donald Trump.
[03:47:19.284 --> 03:47:26.008]  Well, my view is, every time a CIA leader opens his mouth, he's lying.
[03:47:26.008 --> 03:47:28.470]  So why in the world would we believe him now?
[03:47:28.470 --> 03:47:33.573]  Yeah, put it another way, how can you tell they're lying at the CIA?
[03:47:33.573 --> 03:47:35.835]  Their lips are moving.
[03:47:35.835 --> 03:47:38.657]  No, I think that you are, you're exactly right.
[03:47:41.267 --> 03:47:43.468]  The President, however, needs to clean house.
[03:47:43.468 --> 03:47:47.451]  You have an analogous situation at the FBI.
[03:47:47.451 --> 03:48:03.420]  Why he has allowed Mr. Comey, who covered up for the Clintons in the Sandy Berger affair, covered up for the Clintons in the Mark Rich affair, covered up for the Clintons in their initial
[03:48:04.080 --> 03:48:05.280]  That's right.
[03:48:19.385 --> 03:48:36.679]  Tells you that by election day when he first on Thursday said he was reopening the investigation based on 650,000 additional new emails and then on Sunday night I believe it was says well folks we went through all 750 or 650 there's nothing there.
[03:48:36.679 --> 03:48:38.140]  Mr. Comey has worn out his credibility.
[03:48:43.777 --> 03:48:46.138]  He has no more public credibility.
[03:48:46.138 --> 03:48:52.582]  It is time for Donald Trump to make Judge Jeanine Pirro the head of the FBI.
[03:48:52.582 --> 03:48:58.565]  She was a distinguished prosecutor with a reputation for integrity.
[03:48:58.565 --> 03:49:04.148]  And I guarantee you, she's one tough lady, someone I've known for, I guess, 30 years.
[03:49:04.148 --> 03:49:10.911]  Going back to her days as the Westchester County District Attorney, she could clean up the agency.
[03:49:10.911 --> 03:49:12.352]  Of that, I have no doubt.
[03:49:13.052 --> 03:49:20.616]  And I also have no doubt that the American people would rally around the President if he initiated a change like that.
[03:49:20.616 --> 03:49:23.998]  Not just at FBI, but also at CIA.
[03:49:23.998 --> 03:49:29.341]  You know, these constant accusations and innuendos are exhausting.
[03:49:29.341 --> 03:49:34.064]  Not just for those of us here in Washington, but for Americans all across the country.
[03:49:34.064 --> 03:49:41.768]  The President can put that to rest and can really put his foot down by getting rid of these malcontents and starting fresh.
[03:49:43.168 --> 03:49:47.772]  Well, the agencies have no credibility with the American people.
[03:49:47.772 --> 03:49:49.634]  They have worn out their welcome.
[03:49:49.634 --> 03:50:01.884]  I am afraid, however, that they will have a certain number of bureaucrats who have burrowed in to the structure there, and that we will never get rid of them.
[03:50:01.884 --> 03:50:03.626]  They are careerists.
[03:50:03.626 --> 03:50:08.029]  That does not make them non-neocons, of course.
[03:50:08.029 --> 03:50:10.652]  It doesn't mean that they aren't part of the problem.
[03:50:11.212 --> 03:50:25.753]  But the President, President Trump, is inheriting a mess in both of the major intelligence agencies, a mess in which the American people no longer believe anything coming out of the agencies.
[03:50:26.594 --> 03:50:38.521]  When you consider all of the problems that he has to face, and he is taking on, again, like the Republican Party, what is a hostile takeover of the federal government.
[03:50:38.521 --> 03:50:40.782]  So, our prayers are with him.
[03:50:40.782 --> 03:50:45.445]  I hope he will listen to this broadcast and clean house at Langley.

[03:53:48.443 --> 03:53:48.523]  1-800-319-4062.
[03:53:48.523 --> 03:53:49.083]  I was a highway man.
[03:54:07.721 --> 03:54:11.565]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:54:11.565 --> 03:54:17.831]  I'm Roger Stone, putting in my service here for my friend Alex Jones.
[03:54:17.831 --> 03:54:32.724]  Very good news today out of the Trump administration in the nomination of Rick Grenell, who served at the UN as the public spokesman under President George W. Bush, to be our NATO ambassador.
[03:54:33.465 --> 03:54:44.774]  Grinnell was among those who was most effective as a surrogate for Donald Trump, not after the convention, but from the very beginning.
[03:54:44.774 --> 03:54:49.998]  Grinnell is extremely knowledgeable, despite his Bush association.
[03:54:50.558 --> 03:55:05.603]  Grinnell is a believer in American sovereignty, in American power, in American exceptionalism, and he understands his role in NATO in thwarting the ambitions of the globalists.
[03:55:06.343 --> 03:55:35.120]  So in a week in which, sadly, Anthony Scaramucci from Skybridge Capital, who was marked as the man to be public liaison for the Trump White House, was dumped for a Bush quizling, which was a setback for those who believe in the Trump cause and the Trump agenda, Trump comes back and doubles down in spades with the outstanding appointment of Rick Grenell.
[03:55:35.720 --> 03:55:49.789]  This is good news for every American who wants to ensure that the Trump administration stays loyal and true to the Donald J. Trump agenda.
[03:55:49.789 --> 03:55:56.553]  I would be remiss if I didn't remind you one more time to go to the Infowars.com store.
[03:55:56.553 --> 03:55:59.375]  There's a couple products that I have to speak about.
[03:55:59.375 --> 03:56:03.678]  First of all, there is the Hillary Clinton for Prison T-shirt, 2017 T-shirt.
[03:56:05.559 --> 03:56:12.202]  Which I predict will end up in the Smithsonian with the Hillary for Prison 2016 t-shirt.
[03:56:12.202 --> 03:56:19.966]  There's the Trump-Pence 2012-20 t-shirt, which I think is a political genius.
[03:56:19.966 --> 03:56:27.310]  And the one I saw most at the inauguration, Trump Is My President, the red t-shirt.
[03:56:27.310 --> 03:56:31.672]  Now, these t-shirts play an important role in two ways.
[03:56:32.472 --> 03:56:37.298]  Yes, by buying them you help to financially support InfoWars.
[03:56:37.298 --> 03:56:43.785]  But in truth, it's not the two or three dollars that InfoWars gets when you buy the shirt.
[03:56:43.785 --> 03:56:46.808]  More importantly, you become a walking billboard.
[03:56:47.649 --> 03:56:58.734]  For your ideals, you become a walking advertisement for our quest to beat back the globalists and restore American sovereignty and American greatness.
[03:56:58.734 --> 03:57:09.258]  So not only should you buy these t-shirts for your family or yourself, give them to your associates at work who are copacetic, give it to your extended family.
[03:57:09.258 --> 03:57:14.020]  This is how we break the mainstream blackout
[03:57:15.515 --> 03:57:16.896]  Of real news.
[03:57:16.896 --> 03:57:23.078]  This is how we use guerrilla tactics, some of the oldest tactics going back to P.T.
[03:57:23.078 --> 03:57:28.960]  Barnum, if you will, to recreate and repeat endlessly our arguments.
[03:57:28.960 --> 03:57:31.642]  Trump-Pence 2020.
[03:57:31.642 --> 03:57:33.562]  I think it's a great idea.
[03:57:33.562 --> 03:57:39.745]  And frankly, at the rate that Trump is going, he may solve most of our problems in his first term.
[03:57:40.746 --> 03:57:57.846]  Despite the fact that he has had a number of establishment Republicans appointed to the White House staff and appointed to certain departments, he has remained steadfastly true to the agenda he laid out for us in the last election.
[03:57:58.547 --> 03:58:11.592]  Now, today comes news that the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, cannot get the staff of Liberal Democrats and others that he wants to empower at Treasury approved by the White House.
[03:58:11.592 --> 03:58:24.657]  If Reince Priebus is holding up some Treasury Department appointees because they are not Republicans, never mind loyal, well then, for the first time, my hat would be off to Mr. Priebus.
[03:58:24.657 --> 03:58:27.218]  Personnel is policy.
[03:58:28.559 --> 03:58:36.567]  And we cannot assume that down the road, some of those hired will attempt to subvert the Trump agenda.
[03:58:36.567 --> 03:58:42.494]  Thanks for joining us here at InfoWars.
[03:58:42.494 --> 03:58:46.458]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
