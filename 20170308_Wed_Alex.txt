[00:00.000 --> 00:19.880]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones well Peter Teals come
[00:19.880 --> 00:24.220]  out and said the tide of globalism is going out the world government of the
[00:24.220 --> 00:33.360]  corporatist is falling now we have got obviously another jam-packed transmission
[00:33.360 --> 00:38.920]  lined up for you today the first thing I want to get into is the fact that the
[00:38.920 --> 00:47.200]  media is in a total and absolute complete push to act like Trump needs to
[00:47.200 --> 00:52.320]  be impeached because he said that Obama was spying on him but the Democrats
[00:52.320 --> 00:55.800]  were on the news admitting that they were spying on Trump during the campaign
[00:55.800 --> 01:02.900]  and after the campaign as well so we have all of that unfolding and we have
[01:02.900 --> 01:09.080]  the spectacle of CNN still almost 48 hours later two days after vault seven
[01:09.080 --> 01:14.820]  broke biggest thing in WikiLeaks history has said nothing about it
[01:14.820 --> 01:22.300]  separately we have had multiple posts on Facebook completely disappeared
[01:22.300 --> 01:27.580]  and Facebook now brags to China we are now officially censoring in the US we're
[01:27.580 --> 01:32.820]  ready to enter the Chinese market in a press release so they're putting out
[01:32.820 --> 01:36.380]  announcements to China we're ready to censor we're ready to move into your
[01:36.380 --> 01:41.420]  market we're ready to come to communist China the biggest mass murderers in

[01:55.060 --> 01:57.860]  already practiced it in Europe and the United States remember he told Merkel
[01:57.860 --> 02:03.140]  last year I'm gonna start censoring he has meanwhile they don't even send you
[02:03.140 --> 02:09.380]  notices when they censor you they just deep six-year article or video we had a
[02:09.380 --> 02:12.300]  video a few weeks ago with 14 million views they didn't send us a notice there
[02:12.300 --> 02:15.180]  was nothing wrong with it they just disappeared it and then they go on the
[02:15.180 --> 02:22.420]  news and deny it's even happening until now they've told us say today that yes
[02:22.420 --> 02:25.940]  we're starting to censor and ladies and gentlemen it's interesting what they're
[02:25.940 --> 02:32.580]  censoring they deleted a article about Rand Paul coming on this show and
[02:32.580 --> 02:38.260]  talking about the deep state spying on Trump and how Trump's right they don't
[02:38.260 --> 02:43.020]  want any coverage of that any traction and they also deleted an article by Paul
[02:43.020 --> 02:49.380]  Watson didn't tell us why former CIA analyst Obama gave green light for NSA
[02:49.380 --> 02:55.900]  CIA to sabotage Trump very credible former senior CIA ran an entire section
[02:55.900 --> 03:02.060]  of the CIA that's top echelon saying oh no my current colleagues say they were
[03:02.060 --> 03:07.580]  sabotage order to sabotage Trump because it's so credible it's so powerful they
[03:07.580 --> 03:09.620]  don't want Congress hearing about this they don't want this guy getting the
[03:09.620 --> 03:12.580]  attention I want to get him on the show by the way so they just shut down the
[03:12.580 --> 03:17.420]  interview from RT they're not shutting us down because we're fake but shutting
[03:17.420 --> 03:23.300]  us down because we're so credible remember in 2004 it's so old our archives
[03:23.300 --> 03:27.700]  aren't even on the web anymore we had to go to the wayback machine and in 2006 we
[03:27.700 --> 03:36.460]  wrote the very first articles of anybody for info wars calm and prison
[03:36.460 --> 03:41.540]  planet calm we'll put one of those up on screen or tech companies announced that

[04:20.420 --> 04:24.380]  in a bunch of others that we've written over the years documenting all this we

[05:28.620 --> 05:33.380]  outlets began to list possible surveillance targets including Trump's
[05:33.380 --> 05:38.900]  so-called secret server to talk with the Russians and look who's spreading the
[05:38.900 --> 05:43.900]  fake news Hillary Clinton posted on Twitter that it's time for Trump to
[05:43.900 --> 05:49.780]  answer serious questions about his ties to Russia and she included a link to the

[07:59.260 --> 08:18.820]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[08:29.260 --> 08:44.980]  All right this will be a broadcast long-remembered it's the eighth day of
[08:44.980 --> 08:53.500]  March 2017 I am your host Alex Jones thank you so much for joining us today we
[08:53.500 --> 08:58.420]  have several in-studio guests I'll tell you about those folks a little bit later
[08:58.420 --> 09:04.460]  at the start of the next segment but before I go any further two hundred and
[09:04.460 --> 09:08.620]  ninety thousand jobs created in Trump's first month shattering expectations
[09:08.620 --> 09:13.860]  that's a Paul Joseph Watson article at info wars.com it's also in the
[09:13.860 --> 09:20.100]  Associated Press why is the MSM ignoring Trump's sex trafficking bust
[09:20.100 --> 09:24.940]  Town Hall finally asked the question we've been bringing up that is super
[09:24.940 --> 09:28.900]  important but getting back to the economy Shamsung is announcing they're
[09:28.900 --> 09:35.500]  going to move their giant factory from Mexico to the United States all because
[09:35.500 --> 09:39.540]  they know the corporate tax is going to be cut down to make it competitive
[09:39.540 --> 09:46.660]  amazing things are happening all over the place and Ivanka Trump's clothing line
[09:46.660 --> 09:53.220]  kicked out of Macy's and other stores is now selling at double any previous
[09:53.220 --> 09:59.500]  record for her clothing line even last year so the good news is they're trying
[09:59.500 --> 10:05.540]  to sell the idea that they can bully and intimidate us and shut us down as we
[10:05.540 --> 10:08.620]  try to build our own markets and have our own ideas and try to create a
[10:08.620 --> 10:15.100]  chilling effect of intimidation but that's not going to work because the tide
[10:15.100 --> 10:19.020]  of globalism is going out the former head of debauch came on the show last
[10:19.020 --> 10:24.660]  week and said globalism is a corrupt evil institution that is imploding what
[10:24.660 --> 10:28.500]  they claimed it was for was always a lie and Peter teal has gone public saying
[10:28.500 --> 10:34.020]  it's collapsing and that history is completely pulling away from it so the
[10:34.020 --> 10:39.420]  globalist need to know their criminal operation will be defeated and no amount
[10:39.420 --> 10:42.860]  of kicking and screaming and lying and dirty tricks will put it back together
[10:42.860 --> 10:48.340]  again that's why you saw the massive information come out in the vault seven
[10:48.340 --> 10:53.180]  leak from the CIA and very few globalist publications are even trying to
[10:53.180 --> 10:59.220]  claim that that's the Russians no none of this is the Russians it's all US and
[10:59.220 --> 11:03.780]  British intelligence British intelligence is leaking info in the
[11:03.780 --> 11:07.460]  pedophile rings at the highest level of government over there major police chiefs
[11:07.460 --> 11:11.300]  are coming out saying pedophile rings run the government now the media is
[11:11.300 --> 11:16.380]  hardly picking it up but it's happening all over the western world the people
[11:16.380 --> 11:19.700]  and folks in government are trying to turn the tide against the evil right
[11:19.700 --> 11:25.620]  now there is an epic war a battle going on and it's an incredible time to be
[11:25.620 --> 11:30.020]  alive and in the middle of it no matter what color you are where you came from
[11:30.020 --> 11:33.180]  if you love freedom and justice we're brothers and sisters together in this
[11:33.180 --> 11:36.540]  epic fight and I want to salute you all and thank you all for the work you're
[11:36.540 --> 11:41.860]  doing and the support of this broadcast now before I get into all the huge news
[11:41.860 --> 11:48.300]  right up front we are being censored more and more on Facebook on Google and
[11:48.300 --> 11:51.620]  on Twitter a lot of our articles they just won't let us tweet them it's never
[11:51.620 --> 11:55.060]  anything vulgar it's never anything even wild they don't care about some
[11:55.060 --> 11:58.660]  stupid social justice warrior video them acting stupid it's okay that's got 20
[11:58.660 --> 12:05.860]  million views but when we send out an article with a former CIA section chief
[12:05.860 --> 12:16.060]  in intelligence gathering saying that his industry associates and his CIA
[12:16.060 --> 12:19.700]  associates he's at the State Department now all tell him that there was a
[12:19.700 --> 12:22.940]  green light they were ordered to go after Trump during and after the campaign
[12:22.940 --> 12:27.820]  and that Trump is correct they will not let us have that on Facebook they have
[12:27.820 --> 12:31.820]  deleted it they take it down they don't even tell us why they've done it that is
[12:31.820 --> 12:36.780]  such a big deal so we're gonna focus more on this info wars com article and
[12:36.780 --> 12:40.020]  if they won't let us spread it on Facebook if they deleted off Facebook
[12:40.020 --> 12:46.180]  just our link you as humans can overpower Mark Zuckerberg and get that
[12:46.180 --> 12:49.980]  article and others out we're starting sitting on a daily email of not just our
[12:49.980 --> 12:56.980]  news but news that's censored that's accurate they also deleted yesterday our
[12:56.980 --> 13:02.380]  post of Rand Paul the senator joining us to talk about the deep-stated war with
[13:02.380 --> 13:09.620]  Trump and how Trump's right and how Trump was being wiretapped they don't want
[13:09.620 --> 13:13.980]  any credibility on that they want to run around saying Trump's insane with
[13:13.980 --> 13:19.700]  Bloomberg news calling for him to be impeached there is a war going on and
[13:19.700 --> 13:23.500]  they get away with this censorship they're gonna do it to everybody but if we
[13:23.500 --> 13:29.420]  stand up to it they're going to lose the interview is up on info wars com they
[13:29.420 --> 13:34.700]  do not want you to see it's Rand Paul public will live in fear after vault
[13:34.700 --> 13:44.100]  seven leaks they don't want you to see an 18 minute interview with a sitting US
[13:44.100 --> 13:50.700]  senator because they told you I said today starting Sunday they were gonna
[13:50.700 --> 13:55.140]  ban fake news or send you a notice they don't even do that they just deleted was
[13:55.140 --> 13:59.700]  it fake to have a senator on for 18 minutes was it fake in 2004 to put out
[13:59.700 --> 14:02.940]  the first articles about microphones and computers listening to you from a
[14:02.940 --> 14:08.020]  Google press release doesn't get more real than that or how Samsung TVs were
[14:08.020 --> 14:20.100]  watching you is it is it fake and the answer is no ladies and gentlemen it's
[14:20.100 --> 14:24.860]  not fake let me show TV viewers an article from 2006 for some reason I
[14:24.860 --> 14:29.820]  guess we turned off old servers that had stuff pre-2006 on it 2004 that's a big
[14:29.820 --> 14:33.180]  deal I want to find our old website there's info wars in prison planet go
[14:33.180 --> 14:38.820]  back to 1997 info wars does other thing to spiegel got wrong they said 1999
[14:38.820 --> 14:43.900]  that's when we transfer the domain there it is the last article we can find 10
[14:43.900 --> 14:48.180]  years ago government industry government industry to use computer
[14:48.180 --> 14:51.460]  microphones to spy on 150 million Americans invasive surveillance and
[14:51.460 --> 14:57.980]  advertising obliterates even minority report style technology Paul Joseph
[14:57.980 --> 15:03.660]  Watson Alex Jones prison planet comm September 6 2006 we probably find the
[15:03.660 --> 15:08.100]  info wars version as well we can't even find the ones that are older than that
[15:08.100 --> 15:13.680]  there are there are shows I did in 1999 where I bust open a scientific
[15:13.680 --> 15:19.660]  Atlantic cable box on access TV and show you the microphone inside of it before
[15:19.660 --> 15:24.500]  they had voice prompt or any of that and I was told by a time-warner executive who
[15:24.500 --> 15:30.180]  was an engineer and who held patents on it that he was pissed that they were
[15:30.180 --> 15:34.620]  using his some of his systems to listen to people and guess what happened when
[15:34.620 --> 15:38.180]  I did that I got thrown off the radio the next week and I got physically
[15:38.180 --> 15:42.020]  attacked and my car got attacked and I got phone calls and they said you are in
[15:42.020 --> 15:45.620]  trouble now shut your mouth or it's over and you know what I didn't shut my
[15:45.620 --> 15:54.180]  mouth did I I told everybody about this 18 years ago 18 years ago and I'm not
[15:54.180 --> 15:58.740]  bragging but the reason we're being shut down everywhere and kicked off Google
[15:58.740 --> 16:03.900]  ads and kicked off Facebook is because we're real we're hardcore we're trail
[16:03.900 --> 16:07.460]  blazing we're cutting edge we're real investigative journalists we know what
[16:07.460 --> 16:11.340]  we're doing you know other media got told about this in the 90s but they
[16:11.340 --> 16:17.940]  wouldn't run a story that cable boxes were listening to you they wouldn't do
[16:17.940 --> 16:26.060]  it so today I'm gonna tell you what else they're doing here in just a moment
[16:26.060 --> 16:29.180]  and then when Dr. Group joins us probably the most important information
[16:29.180 --> 16:34.660]  we've ever covered but understand 18 year old information ladies and gentlemen
[16:34.660 --> 16:42.580]  is now cutting edge on Fox CNN won't even report it thousands and thousands
[16:42.580 --> 16:45.740]  and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of
[16:45.740 --> 16:50.820]  documents from the CIA how they're spying on Congress the American people
[16:50.820 --> 16:55.300]  you name it and Bloomberg and Fox News were all this morning saying should
[16:55.300 --> 17:07.700]  Trump be impeached for the lie that he's being spied on how dare him get back
[17:07.700 --> 17:14.260]  200 and 90,000 jobs in just 45 days how dare him get the stock market at $3

[17:42.100 --> 17:45.940]  presidents do it's sick these freaks are sick and they still think they're in
[17:45.940 --> 17:51.140]  charge for I go any further though here's the big news I know four people
[17:51.140 --> 17:56.540]  close to me who've taken biome defense the best probiotic out there we did our
[17:56.540 --> 18:00.300]  research foyers and development with the top companies and Dr. Group bringing the
[18:00.300 --> 18:03.740]  biggest wide spectrum good bacteria flora some of the most ancient bacteria
[18:03.740 --> 18:08.220]  flora out there very expensive to get these strains by the way we have 25
[18:08.220 --> 18:11.380]  billion live and 50 billion live so the super strength and the regular strength
[18:11.380 --> 18:15.340]  are both powerful take it two or three times a day I know people that have had
[18:15.340 --> 18:19.740]  irritable bowels for almost a decade and it was ruining their life and I and they
[18:19.740 --> 18:22.780]  taken probiotics before it didn't help them I said you take this at morning
[18:22.780 --> 18:28.540]  noon tonight see what happens a month later completely normal the food you
[18:28.540 --> 18:31.660]  eat this process has pesticides and herbicides in it to kill all the good
[18:31.660 --> 18:35.060]  bacteria then you got dead flora and nothing but yeast and garbage in your
[18:35.060 --> 18:38.540]  stomach the good bacteria go in and then displace all that and you get back to
[18:38.540 --> 18:44.340]  normal it's incredible Bill Gates is number one investment area is gut
[18:44.340 --> 18:47.380]  flora he knows what he's doing to people through Monsanto and the rest of
[18:47.380 --> 18:51.540]  it he's involved with they won't tell anybody this stuff buy on defense
[18:51.540 --> 18:54.820]  support the broadcast get it but now Dr. Groups gonna come at the bottom of the
[18:54.820 --> 18:57.980]  next hour skip this break
[18:58.860 --> 19:04.260]  my co-zx this is a decade in development you don't want to take this on
[19:04.260 --> 19:07.180]  empty stomach Dr. Groups gonna come in you should talk to your physician before
[19:07.180 --> 19:14.500]  because this is serious business okay this is an anti-yeast anti-fungus
[19:14.500 --> 19:20.420]  supports normal fungal and yeast balance proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes
[19:20.420 --> 19:25.100]  maybe the highest quality ingredients it's jam packed with the capsules it is
[19:25.100 --> 19:30.020]  $39.95 it should be a hundred dollars ladies and gentlemen it's so good
[19:30.020 --> 19:38.180]  nothing else is like this 120 vegetarian capsules ladies and gentlemen my co-zx
[19:38.180 --> 19:41.460]  is going to be the ultimate game changer for so many people because our
[19:41.460 --> 19:45.980]  environment is infested with mold it's infested with yeast it is taking over I
[19:45.980 --> 19:49.580]  mean you see the reports people get brain tumors for molding yeast I mean it's
[19:49.580 --> 19:53.380]  just out of control it's killing the bats and most the caves in the US I mean
[19:53.380 --> 19:57.460]  it is mutated it's out of control it's tied into the geoengineering and so much
[19:57.460 --> 20:03.540]  more and this is unbelievable I mean you think biome defense and top-of-the-line
[20:03.540 --> 20:06.700]  probiotics change a lot of people's lives read the five store reviews then
[20:06.700 --> 20:14.500]  four's life comm micro or my co-zx is unbelievable but I will tell you I
[20:14.500 --> 20:18.860]  wouldn't even call it side effects but you actually take it it's it's dramatic
[20:18.860 --> 20:22.820]  been dramatic for me it's been dramatic for others so consult your health care
[20:22.820 --> 20:26.740]  provider do your research because depending on how infested you are it is
[20:26.740 --> 20:32.620]  unbelievable unbelievable what mother nature does with these concentrated
[20:32.620 --> 20:39.380]  herbs and the enzymes that it's just it's amazing it is it is amazing and so
[20:39.380 --> 20:42.580]  many people that are you know really really obese are basically colonized by
[20:42.580 --> 20:46.900]  yeast and fungus that's well known this this is unbelievable it's just like
[20:46.900 --> 20:50.220]  bacteria become drug resistant well it's the it's the fungus it's the yeast
[20:50.220 --> 20:53.460]  because you don't have good bacteria in you for decades because of all the
[20:53.460 --> 20:56.700]  pesticides and herbicides you know the bacteria aren't even in you most of the
[20:56.700 --> 20:59.340]  time or not even anywhere near the floor they should be or their bad bacteria
[20:59.340 --> 21:05.220]  and then who moves in the yeast and the fungus especially with women but let me
[21:05.220 --> 21:11.300]  tell you I didn't feel too good when I took this couple weeks ago it's anything
[21:11.300 --> 21:16.780]  we sell I take before but let me tell you it was dramatic dramatic and I felt so

[23:57.180 --> 24:02.180]  here in studio of course the Joe Rogan experience and Planet Tim Jiu-Jitsu and
[24:02.180 --> 24:06.220]  UFC commentator three comes in here to talk about the world just his view of
[24:06.220 --> 24:12.460]  things I want to lay out to all the viewers and all the listeners but
[24:12.460 --> 24:15.100]  especially the people that make jokes about this broadcast and take it out of
[24:15.100 --> 24:19.260]  context and put together the comedy pieces out there that I think are
[24:19.260 --> 24:28.700]  hilarious as well it's done by salon and Facebook and it's done by media
[24:28.700 --> 24:35.740]  matters and it's done by Esquire it's done by you name it to try to discredit
[24:35.740 --> 24:39.780]  us and hurt us all it does is send us more viewers more listeners particularly
[24:39.780 --> 24:44.820]  young people but they're so arrogant they think their attack is having an
[24:44.820 --> 24:47.420]  effect on us or they think I'm Machiavelli like them they think I tell
[24:47.420 --> 24:51.580]  them it's helping us because it's hurting us and I want them to stop no we
[24:51.580 --> 24:55.020]  don't we don't do tricks like that we can track actually that we're getting a
[24:55.020 --> 25:00.460]  lot of the new young people that listen and watch from the viral videos that are
[25:00.460 --> 25:08.620]  on HBO that are on Bill Maher that are on Vice TV that are on
[25:08.620 --> 25:13.580]  Colbert that are on Kimmel I mean it's it's every week now on those shows alone
[25:13.580 --> 25:19.300]  they show edited mashups of me sometimes going back a decade goofing around or
[25:19.300 --> 25:24.180]  getting angry and out of context and then people are coming here because of
[25:24.180 --> 25:29.900]  that so it's I almost don't want to tell them they might stop but it's just crazy
[25:29.900 --> 25:35.220]  how we're getting millions and millions of young people to tune in because
[25:35.220 --> 25:39.540]  they're doing that now we found the old folks that watch those shows that's
[25:39.540 --> 25:43.740]  mainly their audience they are getting really freaked out and believing it all
[25:43.740 --> 25:49.220]  I could go bear has me saying I don't like gays or I'm anti-gay and they'll
[25:49.220 --> 25:52.700]  probably take that and put that out no I'm not I say I'm not anti-gay and they
[25:52.700 --> 25:59.220]  say I'm anti-gay so there's some real deceptiveness going on as well I mean
[25:59.220 --> 26:01.900]  you know a little kid went and did what Trump always says it means okay
[26:01.900 --> 26:05.340]  everything's a okay putting your index finger with your thumb and there's a
[26:05.340 --> 26:10.940]  little kid they had those in Jell-O ads like mmm Jell-O so I've always made you
[26:10.940 --> 26:14.740]  can see me in photos going back decades the double thumbs up in fact you know my
[26:14.740 --> 26:18.260]  wife everybody always says stop doing that every photo I don't know why I do
[26:18.260 --> 26:21.220]  these Trump like deals I never even watched Trump on TV before I've been
[26:21.220 --> 26:24.300]  doing this for 20 years on air double thumbs up and everything's a okay
[26:24.300 --> 26:29.140]  people say oh it's an Illuminati symbol no it means okay okay the little kid
[26:29.140 --> 26:32.780]  does it they're saying it's white supremacism that's mainstream news I
[26:32.780 --> 26:38.020]  guess the three fingers mean W I don't I don't know what the rest supposedly
[26:38.020 --> 26:44.540]  means Matt you explained me can you turn the mic on I was in a laughing about it
[26:44.540 --> 26:47.900]  and you said no no really you saw a TV piece on it they're saying three fingers
[26:47.900 --> 26:52.780]  means a W so if you're holding up the okay sign Alex with with your hand right
[26:52.780 --> 26:58.420]  there and you're holding up your right hand to an observer drive put them on
[26:58.420 --> 27:03.020]  screen real quick so to an observer your three fingers that are standing up make
[27:03.020 --> 27:07.900]  a W and then your forefinger or your pointer finger and your thumb that
[27:07.900 --> 27:12.580]  circle well if you were to draw a vertical line down your palm then that
[27:12.580 --> 27:15.620]  makes a P it's almost like you're looking for things in the stars like they
[27:15.620 --> 27:20.100]  did with you know constellations and things when you're a kid you see elephant
[27:20.100 --> 27:23.540]  surge your raft and the clouds when you're three and mommy and daddy say
[27:23.540 --> 27:26.660]  what animals do you see well I've said this before this isn't the mass mental
[27:26.660 --> 27:30.540]  illness on purpose where they take all language all literature all culture and
[27:30.540 --> 27:34.580]  make it offensive so the only culture is having those symbols or no
[27:34.580 --> 27:37.620]  communication that's why they've banned whiteboards at colleges all over the
[27:37.620 --> 27:40.780]  country someone might write something offensive that's saying like banned
[27:40.780 --> 27:43.820]  books someone might write something offensive it's it's the next step it's
[27:43.820 --> 27:48.740]  not just banned certain titles it's like banned paper I mean we're truly
[27:48.740 --> 27:52.380]  getting to you know Roddenberry's or Fahrenheit whatever the temperature
[27:52.380 --> 27:56.820]  that paper burns but that they know what they're doing Michigan State
[27:56.820 --> 28:00.780]  University bans whiteboards from dorm doors what do you make of this I mean
[28:00.780 --> 28:05.820]  clearly the kids copying Trump doing an a okay symbol and and you know they've
[28:05.820 --> 28:08.540]  got some of conspiracy theorists that are real conspiracy theorists you know
[28:08.540 --> 28:11.340]  that turn everything into something as well they're kind of like the liberals
[28:11.340 --> 28:14.780]  they're like I noticed they're all pseudo-intellectuals that then just wage
[28:14.780 --> 28:19.140]  war on communication what do you think Matt I actually think it's more of like
[28:19.140 --> 28:23.220]  kind of like a Jedi ward that Trump does with his hand whenever he does that up
[28:23.220 --> 28:28.540]  he's like everything will be a okay I'm the president now Barack Obama is going
[28:28.540 --> 28:33.060]  to jail with Hillary that's what that means when I was a kid and I was getting
[28:33.060 --> 28:37.340]  upset about something or whatever my dad would say it's okay I mean that means
[28:37.340 --> 28:40.580]  okay like it's okay it's under control right I mean didn't verb but did that
[28:40.580 --> 28:45.220]  always mean everything's a okay oh yeah but then these people say it's a
[28:45.220 --> 28:51.540]  Illuminati Alex is in the Illuminati what matters is what I say and what I do and
[28:51.540 --> 28:56.700]  what I stand for not what hand signals I make you know it's like this symbol was
[28:56.700 --> 29:00.900]  originally to ward off the devil in Italy then Rodney James Deos heard of
[29:00.900 --> 29:04.700]  doing it so it became a sign of the devil so if you do it at UT it doesn't
[29:04.700 --> 29:09.060]  mean you're worshiping the devil but if Bill Clinton does it it means something
[29:09.060 --> 29:12.940]  different you see what I'm saying Matt yeah totally I didn't get to the biggest
[29:12.940 --> 29:16.500]  thing ever but but I'm gonna come back and cover it we got any Bravo coming in
[29:16.500 --> 29:21.580]  but if you think it's shocking that they're listening to you and watching
[29:21.580 --> 29:25.140]  you I don't mean just sometimes they're mass data collecting everything it
[29:25.140 --> 29:29.900]  happens a lot if you think that it's big that this all came true folks I got
[29:29.900 --> 29:33.580]  stuff a hundred times worse it's not my opinion though it didn't come true it
[29:33.580 --> 29:38.140]  was already true but when it's trumped and apologized the little boy making the
[29:38.140 --> 29:42.340]  white supremacism symbol see it's like you know 25 billion dollars the black
[29:42.340 --> 29:46.020]  history group or to the colleges and they turn it around that he's racist for
[29:46.020 --> 29:48.940]  doing it or Conway had her feet on the couch they always got to change the
[29:48.940 --> 29:55.660]  subject we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:55.660 --> 30:04.500]  network a previously debunked claim alleging then candidate Donald Trump
[30:04.500 --> 30:10.260]  ran a secret server to communicate with Russia during the 2016 presidential
[30:10.260 --> 30:15.500]  race has resurfaced the establishment mainstream media is now rehashing the
[30:15.500 --> 30:19.980]  story which has already been debunked after President Donald Trump on

[30:25.700 --> 30:30.180]  calls at New York's Trump Tower mainstream media outlets began to list
[30:30.180 --> 30:36.060]  possible surveillance targets including Trump's so-called secret server to talk
[30:36.060 --> 30:41.100]  with the Russians and look who's spreading the fake news Hillary Clinton
[30:41.100 --> 30:45.900]  posted on Twitter that it's time for Trump to answer serious questions about
[30:45.900 --> 30:51.660]  his ties to Russia and she included a link to the original slate article that

[32:17.780 --> 32:22.420]  primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula caveman it's those
[32:22.420 --> 32:25.860]  people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are
[32:25.860 --> 32:29.340]  our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that
[32:29.340 --> 32:33.500]  everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal you used the meat
[32:33.500 --> 32:38.140]  for sustenance the fat for cooking but you use the bones for strength from the
[32:38.140 --> 32:41.980]  outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that
[32:41.980 --> 32:46.220]  produces the blood for the body this is the engine of the life essence I'm a
[32:46.220 --> 32:50.100]  long way from the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get
[32:50.100 --> 32:53.980]  back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it I
[32:53.980 --> 32:56.900]  know you're gonna want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for
[32:56.900 --> 33:08.580]  yourself and for his lifetime comedy we now take you live to the central Texas
[33:08.580 --> 33:13.500]  command center in the heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex
[33:13.500 --> 33:16.180]  Jones show
[33:21.060 --> 33:25.300]  any bravos in studio for the next hour the doctor Edward group and Roger Stone
[33:25.300 --> 33:31.820]  and so many others we have a George new my arm and pronounced that right from
[33:31.820 --> 33:36.820]  American spectator a bunch of other guests coming on that stones got set up

[33:42.940 --> 33:46.380]  Eddie Bravo 10 he's one of the top jujitsu experts in the world don't
[33:46.380 --> 33:50.020]  feel to beat guys are top you know people and a lot bigger than him just had
[33:50.020 --> 33:52.980]  back surgery those I'm not a scared up normally but I've just known this guy
[33:52.980 --> 33:58.260]  for a good decade or so hanging out with Joe at UFC events so funny show so fun
[33:58.260 --> 34:01.220]  to hang out behind the scenes with and I wanted to I kept saying fly here and
[34:01.220 --> 34:04.020]  all of a sudden he's here but he's got to go right away I wanted to do like some
[34:04.020 --> 34:07.020]  late-night podcast with him but it's okay we'll definitely do it again but you
[34:07.020 --> 34:11.700]  were on that big record-setting podcast with myself and joke where she co-hosted
[34:11.700 --> 34:15.780]  a lot record downloads record views and they tried to censor it they tried to
[34:15.780 --> 34:20.060]  block it Joe Joe confirmed that effect some things like Google Play never even
[34:20.060 --> 34:23.000]  listed it they wouldn't put it on iTunes for a day and a half that never
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.420]  happened to him and they won't put it as the top iTunes ever podcast even though
[34:27.420 --> 34:31.420]  it is Joe has the internal control board he could see it's the biggest podcast
[34:31.420 --> 34:34.820]  ever he's already in the top three he has the biggest podcast he ever did times
[34:34.820 --> 34:39.140]  double or more and they won't show it on iTunes as number one what do you think
[34:39.140 --> 34:43.460]  of that Eddie it's pretty crazy and first of all I want to apologize I want
[34:43.460 --> 34:51.100]  to apologize I want to apologize for being an idiot and an annoying guest I
[34:51.100 --> 34:54.860]  should have just kept my mouth shut but I want to apologize I'm the one easy
[34:54.860 --> 34:58.420]  interrupts people don't come up with Joe yes yes I'm glad you were there people
[34:58.420 --> 35:02.540]  people complained about that and rightfully so I was very annoying and
[35:02.540 --> 35:10.980]  but the reason I got a funny tell me about I got the replica of the
[35:10.980 --> 35:15.580]  dinosaurs yeah no but the main thing was is I've taken a lot of heat over the
[35:15.580 --> 35:20.380]  years a lot of heat for chemtrails a lot of heat for that and to finally get you
[35:20.380 --> 35:25.260]  in front of Joe Rogan's audience who most of the people most of the people and
[35:25.260 --> 35:30.060]  most of Joe Rogan's audience they you know they think you're crazy and they
[35:30.060 --> 35:34.580]  think what with the mainstream media how they portray but they actually 99%
[35:34.580 --> 35:37.780]  actually said now I like Alex Jones no no because of the podcast for sure they
[35:37.780 --> 35:41.700]  were blown away actually heard me I didn't get annoying in until about an
[35:41.700 --> 35:44.980]  hour into the show I just sat there by the way Marcos Morales and so many
[35:44.980 --> 35:50.580]  others watch the podcast also watch your podcast they all love you so let's
[35:50.580 --> 35:53.860]  let's be clear your love of the Joe Rogan podcast was just that night some
[35:53.860 --> 35:59.340]  folks got pissed at you yeah well it was it was because I wanted to clear the
[35:59.340 --> 36:02.340]  whole chemtrail thing because you're let's do that let's do that no one calls
[36:02.340 --> 36:06.140]  it chemtrails in the real world I call it chemtrails there is manipulation of
[36:06.140 --> 36:09.500]  the weather it's mainstream news and the media always picks it up and says I'm
[36:09.500 --> 36:13.100]  crazy it's on the weather channel that there are secret programs it's just so
[36:13.100 --> 36:16.620]  secret we don't know the details then other people think every condensation
[36:16.620 --> 36:21.620]  trail is a jet you know is an actual chemtrail when they're crystal trails but
[36:21.620 --> 36:25.780]  NASA admits the Earth's 30% darker you can you can Google chemtrails from space
[36:25.780 --> 36:29.860]  it shows the NASA photos it's changing our atmosphere and they are adding
[36:29.860 --> 36:33.420]  chemicals to the jet fuel at the industrial level go ahead and I hope
[36:33.420 --> 36:36.180]  Trump like next time I talk to him I keep forgetting when I talk to him I'm
[36:36.180 --> 36:40.740]  gonna ask him to look into geospatial manipulation calling it a stratospheric
[36:40.740 --> 36:46.180]  aerosol injection yes John O'Brennan wasn't at the CFR talking about it how
[36:46.180 --> 36:52.100]  it's it's it's a captured as interest and it costs $10 billion a year you know
[36:52.100 --> 36:56.100]  engineering tell us about real real geo tell us about the real atmosphere
[36:56.100 --> 37:00.060]  manipulation is going on well based on what John O'Brennan said at the CFR you
[37:00.060 --> 37:05.100]  can watch on YouTube yeah it just like the chemtrail people have been saying
[37:05.100 --> 37:08.380]  for years that eventually they're gonna have to admit it and they're gonna say
[37:08.380 --> 37:12.620]  that and by the way search engine the CFR calls for geo engineering and it'll
[37:12.620 --> 37:16.380]  be on their own website that you even said this for years eventually they're
[37:16.380 --> 37:21.020]  gonna come out and say that yes they are spraying the atmosphere with metallic
[37:21.020 --> 37:25.700]  particles but it's to save us to save for global warming to save the planet and
[37:25.700 --> 37:29.460]  that's exactly what John O'Brennan did he got him from the CFR and he said yeah
[37:29.460 --> 37:35.580]  we're gonna start spraying in at the atmosphere with stratospheric aerosol
[37:35.580 --> 37:39.740]  injections and it's gonna cost $10 billion a year and there's gonna be some
[37:39.740 --> 37:44.100]  countries that are not gonna be into it because I guess who's behind it and word
[37:44.100 --> 37:47.380]  for word you're saying what they put out Bill Gates called for this Bill Gates
[37:47.380 --> 37:50.940]  is getting government money to then run the program yeah they're running
[37:50.940 --> 37:55.980]  programs to control hurricanes it's all in like nature and science magazine but
[37:55.980 --> 38:01.740]  then they go on the news and say Alex says Obama shit tornadoes to Oklahoma no
[38:01.740 --> 38:06.180]  I didn't so again they misrepresent what's really going on now what's what
[38:06.180 --> 38:12.020]  is it explain the difference between legit contrails and the stuff that is
[38:12.020 --> 38:15.180]  the stratospheric aerosol injections what's the difference because people say
[38:15.180 --> 38:18.900]  all that take us basic science clear it is one and guardian Bill Gates backs
[38:18.900 --> 38:21.900]  climate scientists lobbying for large-scale geo engineering so they're
[38:21.900 --> 38:24.540]  already doing it five billion dollars a year Department of Energy that they
[38:24.540 --> 38:30.220]  admit yeah there was a Nobel Prize the two guys won with 1992 with the plan by
[38:30.220 --> 38:34.260]  94 it was launched yeah and now it's over most the world it's a giant program a
[38:34.260 --> 38:37.580]  lot of people and I'm not kidding since Trump got in notice there's less of the
[38:37.580 --> 38:40.660]  chemtrails and that's why Trump said we have advanced technology we can pretty
[38:40.660 --> 38:44.180]  much cure stuff now I want to roll this out to you that's why the elites are
[38:44.180 --> 38:47.100]  really mad because the word is even though I'm brought this up Trump I need
[38:47.100 --> 38:51.580]  to is that Trump's killing all these programs that's why they're so pissed
[38:51.580 --> 38:55.580]  that's why all the agencies are just ignoring it yeah yeah so again what
[38:55.580 --> 38:59.500]  explain to the people out there who are still non-believers what what is the
[38:59.500 --> 39:03.740]  difference between legit contrails and the ones that last all day and
[39:03.740 --> 39:07.180]  completely cover the sky okay you turns out people think of jet fuel is really
[39:07.180 --> 39:11.340]  volatile it's not gasoline's like three times more volatile more explosive you
[39:11.340 --> 39:16.540]  know burns hotter you name it jet fuel actually is like kerosene and so kerosene
[39:16.540 --> 39:20.300]  I don't recommend this you can put it on your hand light it and you know it
[39:20.300 --> 39:22.940]  doesn't burn you for a while that's what they kind of use like a lot of the
[39:22.940 --> 39:26.500]  Hollywood sets and things so you can add a lot of things to kerosene they add
[39:26.500 --> 39:30.300]  barium salts limited oxide and also some radioactive isotopes there's only three
[39:30.300 --> 39:34.540]  big major makers of jet fuel the United States there's some sub ones as well and
[39:34.540 --> 39:38.180]  they just under an actual security directive that's secret but the patents
[39:38.180 --> 39:42.620]  are there the directive is known but the details are classified they add this to
[39:42.620 --> 39:46.580]  the mix in a government program they're paid to do it and then they use the jet
[39:46.580 --> 39:51.900]  engines that the patents are like over 20 patents on this you can Google it and
[39:51.900 --> 39:55.780]  you get the patent office to use jet engines to then aerosolize for cloud
[39:55.780 --> 39:59.740]  seating and they claim that they're shielding the earth from the Sun
[39:59.740 --> 40:02.620]  because we've lost our atmosphere but then you actually look what the
[40:02.620 --> 40:06.260]  scientists are doing it's actually you know hurting the planet actually keeping
[40:06.260 --> 40:09.860]  heat in the opposite so it's like they're trying to create global warming
[40:09.860 --> 40:13.500]  actually because again the ultra-violent radiation goes through the clouds the
[40:13.500 --> 40:17.260]  other good Sun gets blocked and bounces back out those wavelengths get blocked
[40:17.260 --> 40:20.520]  but the ultra-violent it's like your dad tells you you know on a cloudy day you
[40:20.520 --> 40:23.420]  still get burned because the ultra-violent comes through that comes
[40:23.420 --> 40:27.420]  through does it bounce back out okay it just heats the earth up so they're
[40:27.420 --> 40:30.580]  trying to heat the earth up in a big giant secret experiment and they admit
[40:30.580 --> 40:34.100]  they're doing it but you know it's just they won't give us the details and then
[40:34.100 --> 40:38.340]  we talk about it's like oh Alex nobody on your iPhone's watching you and Google
[40:38.340 --> 40:41.180]  doesn't listen over the phone I'm like I have all their press releases 10 years
[40:41.180 --> 40:46.580]  ago right here I mean that of course now they all admit it yesterday with the but
[40:46.580 --> 40:50.420]  I had you heard interview you Eddie he had he got in trouble talking over me so
[40:50.420 --> 40:53.000]  now I have him as a guest he won't talk and he can talk more anybody you know
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.660]  I went to dinner with him a few weeks ago he talked for two hours straight was
[40:55.660 --> 40:59.500]  awesome well on the Joe Rogan podcast you wanted to talk more about Trump I
[40:59.500 --> 41:02.900]  wanted to talk about chemtrails so I kind of you know and then plus you brought
[41:02.900 --> 41:06.620]  out the whiskey you know I told Joe no more drinking on the podcast you know I
[41:06.620 --> 41:12.140]  get I get crazy the Indians out the bottle of whiskey we started taking
[41:12.140 --> 41:17.420]  shots and I wanted to talk chemtrails and you wanted to talk Trump and I got
[41:17.420 --> 41:22.700]  kind of and you did a great job let's talk about to apologize for that let's
[41:22.700 --> 41:25.780]  talk about him okay stop it stop apologizing I'm only supposed I'm the
[41:25.780 --> 41:31.380]  interrupter okay tell me to shut up now but seriously let's just sell that I've
[41:31.380 --> 41:33.540]  seen you with the hottest chicks I've ever seen anybody with how do you get all
[41:33.540 --> 41:38.060]  the logics yeah I'm a married man that was a long time ago yeah that was yeah
[41:38.060 --> 41:42.700]  that was before I'm sorry yes don't let the lucky lady I love my wife I love my
[41:42.700 --> 41:47.820]  son I love my family and would you get married I got married four years ago oh
[41:47.820 --> 41:53.580]  well yeah I remember 10 years ago and stuff in Vegas hey those were I that was
[41:53.580 --> 42:01.820]  a long time ago Alex I was good though man Joe Joe could just go and go Joe can
[42:01.820 --> 42:05.740]  talk forever yes that's why he has a very successful podcast yeah he's a piece
[42:05.740 --> 42:10.700]  of work Joe's awesome ending he's an incredible man yes of course you've
[42:10.700 --> 42:14.540]  known Joe longer me but I remember Joe did you know Joe like in like 1998 1999
[42:14.540 --> 42:18.180]  that's when I met him so we probably he wasn't as big as he is now but it wasn't
[42:18.180 --> 42:21.540]  a small guy syndrome like a big guy mess with him or got in his face he would
[42:21.540 --> 42:26.140]  like routinely like choke guys out like I've seen it repeatedly like big guys
[42:26.140 --> 42:29.300]  they were like mess with him I mean it but over the years he mellowed out when
[42:29.300 --> 42:34.060]  did that happen when you started smoking weed probably I guess he didn't
[42:34.060 --> 42:39.740]  really get into weed til when yeah 2001 that's a funny story he used to not be
[42:39.740 --> 42:44.620]  totally and then yeah it took me like six months to talk him into it but cuz I
[42:44.620 --> 42:47.980]  knew if I knew if I if I could but you know the old Joe right you didn't want
[42:47.980 --> 42:53.020]  to mess with him yeah yeah well I was the crazy weed activist at jujitsu I'm a
[42:53.020 --> 42:58.260]  I was a purple belt trying to get everyone to let's just say it you you've
[42:58.260 --> 43:03.700]  defeated the you know like the Gracie's all the top people I defeated Hoyler
[43:03.700 --> 43:09.020]  Gracie in 2003 and not that's the only Gracie I've ever but a lot of people say
[43:09.020 --> 43:12.660]  I'm not I don't fall I mean I follow UFC some I like it but I'm not like I don't
[43:12.660 --> 43:16.620]  know any of that I mean I just know that everybody says you're the best I am not
[43:16.620 --> 43:20.180]  the best well no just long-term like with the technique and stuff Jean-Jacques
[43:20.180 --> 43:25.220]  Machado is the best that's my master so I'm not the best I'm not even close to
[43:25.220 --> 43:29.020]  the best but you did just get a back surgery too didn't you yes yes got that
[43:29.020 --> 43:33.380]  dis replacement in my back and I'm still recovering you know doing yoga now
[43:33.380 --> 43:38.980]  trying to get back to 100% hopefully I'll get there but was it the jujitsu
[43:38.980 --> 43:43.900]  that finally got your back the doctor said no I went to the best apparently I
[43:43.900 --> 43:46.860]  got the best doctor in the country I didn't even know I just someone
[43:46.860 --> 43:53.740]  recommended him to me and he said that unless you have direct blunt force
[43:53.740 --> 43:58.900]  trauma into your back that everyone's back as well some people's discs go out
[43:58.900 --> 44:03.460]  some people don't and it and he says it has nothing to do with what you know
[44:03.460 --> 44:08.620]  what what sport you're doing or whatever but so there's 20-year-old he was
[44:08.620 --> 44:13.340]  showing me MRIs of different people and said look this is a 23-year-old girl
[44:13.340 --> 44:16.620]  never did anything in her life in her back scrooge and he's dis replacement
[44:16.620 --> 44:21.020]  so I got pile drives once I got two discs that are just waiting to go out here
[44:21.020 --> 44:24.940]  and two down here I'm not looking forward to that all be toughed out well you're
[44:24.940 --> 44:28.060]  gonna get surgery I don't know it's just when they hurt it's like it's
[44:28.060 --> 44:33.580]  excruciating even get up hmm I'm sure you went through that too yeah my back
[44:33.580 --> 44:37.900]  was you know I tried everything for it and I finally got an MRI and they said
[44:37.900 --> 44:45.500]  you don't have a disc in your L1S5 and or L5S1 I get those confused but I was
[44:45.500 --> 44:48.740]  bone-to-bone for years and years and that's where all the pain came from so I
[44:48.740 --> 44:52.660]  finally went in there got surgery and and hopefully it fixes it but you're
[44:52.660 --> 44:57.780]  such a cool cat and said funny and nice a lot of guys that are tough guys I mean
[44:57.780 --> 45:00.500]  a lot of them are cool I guess you and Joe have helped kind of change things but
[45:00.500 --> 45:03.540]  I remember just some of the people I've been around from you know UFC they
[45:03.540 --> 45:08.180]  really are kind of aggressive jerks but but it seems like that's getting phased
[45:08.180 --> 45:14.380]  out there's still some of that you know there's douchebags in every genre and
[45:14.380 --> 45:21.580]  every community you know jiu-jitsu has them too and so there's douchebags in
[45:21.580 --> 45:25.420]  the conspiracy theory movement you know absolutely I know Dana White's a super
[45:25.420 --> 45:29.780]  nice guy you know for all the power he's got he's he's really down to earth yeah
[45:29.780 --> 45:33.580]  very nice guy you know unless you get on his bad side then it comes that's what
[45:33.580 --> 45:38.540]  you got you with the wrath but I love Dana he's what he's done for the sport
[45:38.540 --> 45:43.580]  and MMA I mean you know without him the UFC wouldn't be worth that right now
[45:43.580 --> 45:47.300]  absolutely I remember Joe back when he was going yeah this UFC's gonna start me
[45:47.300 --> 45:50.300]  bigger the NFL man it's so awesome and Dana White and I was just like and then
[45:50.300 --> 45:53.220]  all of a sudden it just explodes yeah Joe's been there since the very start
[45:53.220 --> 46:00.020]  pretty much yep he was doing backstage interviews in 97 back in that you say
[46:00.020 --> 46:03.140]  Joe man I mean I've seen the workouts works really hard you say Joe's really
[46:03.140 --> 46:06.740]  good at jiu-jitsu yeah he's one of my black belts yeah he's he hasn't trained
[46:06.740 --> 46:11.220]  in a couple years because he had a back injury himself I didn't get surgery but
[46:11.220 --> 46:16.020]  his back is kind of tweaked and he might not be able to get back to jiu-jitsu
[46:16.020 --> 46:20.260]  yeah he's talked about it though he's talked about coming back but I will see
[46:20.260 --> 46:26.860]  but he was a champion in taekwondo too yes yes yes he's he's one of the
[46:26.860 --> 46:31.140]  hardest kickers pound for pound that I've ever seen you know and I've known
[46:31.140 --> 46:34.020]  did you ever see that video where he was kicking to the blood was pouring out of
[46:34.020 --> 46:38.020]  his shins I was like it was crazy he was kicking to the blood was point I saw it
[46:38.020 --> 46:41.100]  once I tried to find it again but yeah he was like kicking with some big UFC
[46:41.100 --> 46:45.900]  guy so you could go the longest like kicking a wall kicking a pillar and he
[46:45.900 --> 46:48.540]  did it till it was just like blubbers every time his heartbeat blubbers is
[46:48.540 --> 46:52.540]  running out of the shin I'm not sure I've seen the I'm telling you call Joe
[46:52.540 --> 46:57.460]  absolutely well there's there's a video of him showing GSP one of the greatest
[46:57.460 --> 47:02.340]  fighters of all time showing him how to throw a turning sidekick and it's pretty
[47:02.340 --> 47:08.780]  crazy I mean you got Joe Rogan you know the fear factor guy showing GSP
[47:08.780 --> 47:13.900]  arguably the best pound for pound per pound fighter of all time and he's
[47:13.900 --> 47:17.180]  showing him how to throw a turning side let's Google that let's Google that I've
[47:17.180 --> 47:21.420]  seen that video it's man what's the name you can just GSP Joe Rogan shows how to
[47:21.420 --> 47:26.020]  do a what kind of kick it's turning sidekick you know it's pretty insane
[47:26.020 --> 47:29.420]  yeah here it is let's go ahead and turn the audio this is Joe Rogan this is not
[47:29.420 --> 47:32.540]  the one this is him showing how to throw a turning sidekick but you got to find
[47:32.540 --> 47:37.300]  the one that it says GSP as well this is yeah that was the wrong doesn't show
[47:37.300 --> 47:42.820]  have the classic bulldog features hey let's get into serious stuff though what
[47:42.820 --> 47:45.580]  do you make of them coming out saying okay we're listening to everybody we're
[47:45.580 --> 47:49.340]  watching Congress your TV's watching you everything's true and we already knew
[47:49.340 --> 47:53.140]  because the industry had to admit it or they could get sued but that's what's
[47:53.140 --> 47:57.580]  crazy this was in I love to say oh I knew it I had sources it was in the press
[47:57.580 --> 48:04.420]  releases in 2004 here's 2006 government industry to use computer microphones
[48:04.420 --> 48:07.620]  to spawn 150 million Americans so the big news I want to tell people it's this
[48:07.620 --> 48:11.540]  we're gonna skip this breaks we have more time if you think this is big and
[48:11.540 --> 48:14.500]  shocking folks this is the thing they attack me on and say I'm crazy you know
[48:14.500 --> 48:18.260]  your TV's watching that's the classic deal they're not freaking out all the
[48:18.260 --> 48:21.760]  news going I guess Alex Jones is right what the hell folks that's not what's
[48:21.760 --> 48:26.620]  important they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and you know okay
[48:26.620 --> 48:29.620]  what's the proof thousands of medical reports around the world where they test
[48:29.620 --> 48:33.700]  them they're adding cancer viruses that aren't even contaminated it's not even
[48:33.700 --> 48:38.580]  the chain of manufacturing it's coming from egg whites and then it's got some
[48:38.580 --> 48:41.780]  monkey virus that was never part of the production they're doing it on purpose
[48:41.780 --> 48:44.780]  they've been caught and then it just goes from there Eddie there's a whole
[48:44.780 --> 48:49.620]  program to kill us yeah they're putting fluoride in the water which it's on my
[48:49.620 --> 48:54.460]  bookshelf a guy's eco sciences back there he wrote it 1974 the last White House
[48:54.460 --> 49:02.180]  science are but it's 74 John P. Holdren wrote it the book 1100 pages long as a
[49:02.180 --> 49:05.780]  textbook and it says we put fluoride in the water to lower their fertility and
[49:05.780 --> 49:09.500]  to lower their electrochemical activity in the brain and his adjuvants to
[49:09.500 --> 49:13.100]  accelerate the other drugs we add to the water not being by can Google it and see
[49:13.100 --> 49:17.180]  it online you can read the pages it's you know it's at the different library
[49:17.180 --> 49:23.020]  website scans of it see they they're lowering our fertility and killing us
[49:23.020 --> 49:26.020]  folks it's just like I told you the microphones and in cameras are watching
[49:26.020 --> 49:29.740]  you I didn't just pull that out of my rear end they write books how they're
[49:29.740 --> 49:33.980]  poisoning you and your family that's who Obama chose to run the damn country
[49:33.980 --> 49:38.460]  that's who runs the whole chemtrail operation yeah yeah and with the
[49:38.460 --> 49:42.980]  vaccines the craziest thing about the vaccines you know most of the people are
[49:42.980 --> 49:47.380]  believe you know the they're safe and effective because that's what the CDC
[49:47.380 --> 49:52.020]  pushes but you know when you think when you really really look into vaccines
[49:52.020 --> 49:58.140]  all you all you need to know is on day one when your baby is born they give it
[49:58.140 --> 50:01.820]  a hep B vaccine that's sexually transmitted what why would you take that
[50:01.820 --> 50:05.620]  I why why are they giving that's the tower seven you might as well stomp on
[50:05.620 --> 50:09.420]  their liver on the floor yeah yeah the day they're born and you know why they
[50:09.420 --> 50:13.140]  give them the better for you to go ahead you know the reason they give them
[50:13.140 --> 50:18.580]  when you ask them you ask the doctor why on day one are you giving a newborn a
[50:18.580 --> 50:23.900]  hep B vaccine makes no sense so wow when they're older they're gonna forget
[50:23.900 --> 50:29.860]  they're not gonna do it when they're older so day one it's standard unless you
[50:29.860 --> 50:33.620]  say anything they're gonna they're gonna inject your baby on day one with a
[50:33.620 --> 50:36.500]  hep B vaccine and then they look like you're crazy and then the nurses after
[50:36.500 --> 50:39.700]  you say no they go not about do it either yeah we've had nurses on who've
[50:39.700 --> 50:42.620]  given their names but also nurses that have you know brought out their faces
[50:42.620 --> 50:48.020]  or in the in the NICU in the in the in the premature sick baby ward they know
[50:48.020 --> 50:50.220]  when they give them the vaccines that they never used to do this now they
[50:50.220 --> 50:54.300]  order them to a lot of them stop breathing and die so they get ready with
[50:54.300 --> 50:57.620]  the resuscitation with the defibrillators with the ventilators to keep
[50:57.620 --> 51:01.620]  them alive when the bioethics board orders them to give them the shots yeah
[51:01.620 --> 51:07.180]  that being day one it listen when you've got a three pound baby until five years
[51:07.180 --> 51:12.060]  ago they never gave it they give the shots the babies die sometimes they
[51:12.060 --> 51:15.980]  can't keep my life they die yeah they give them the shot an hour later they're
[51:15.980 --> 51:20.060]  gone baby and they I mean and again that that exercise we have the art let's put
[51:20.060 --> 51:23.660]  it back on screen for TV viewers I'll give it to go ahead and again do I
[51:23.660 --> 51:26.260]  believe you can get learned immunity from vaccine of course I believe in that
[51:26.260 --> 51:29.340]  technology if there's some horrible disease running around killing people and
[51:29.340 --> 51:32.500]  I can get her my kids can we can attenuate the virus or whatever it is my
[51:32.500 --> 51:36.580]  body learns how to defeat it of course I believe in science the point is is that
[51:36.580 --> 51:39.500]  a government that's been caught in all these secret experiments have given
[51:39.500 --> 51:42.940]  black people civilists and everything else you know and radiating foster kids
[51:42.940 --> 51:46.020]  to death why the hell would you take something when it's got vaccine
[51:46.020 --> 51:50.060]  protection yeah when when we were kids we took there was probably three or four
[51:50.060 --> 51:54.380]  now it's over 50 yeah and and why is that it doesn't have anything to do with
[51:54.380 --> 51:59.860]  the fact that Ronald Reagan saw signed a bill in 1986 that gave immunity to the
[51:59.860 --> 52:03.420]  vaccine manufacturers which is basically big pharma exactly Reagan didn't know
[52:03.420 --> 52:05.900]  what he was doing but that's one evil thing Reagan did and Trump's trying to
[52:05.900 --> 52:13.380]  repeal it yeah so since 1986 the big pharma can get sued for vaccine injuries
[52:13.380 --> 52:16.620]  that's when they started rolling them out and greenlighting them that's why now
[52:16.620 --> 52:22.060]  we have how many like 45 shots babies got to take and you can Google this the
[52:22.060 --> 52:25.700]  US government admits life expectancy is down the US infant mortality is up and
[52:25.700 --> 52:30.300]  IQ has dropped more than 20 points since 1950 and according to according to
[52:30.300 --> 52:34.660]  mainstream 20 points brother yeah according to mainstream statistics I
[52:34.660 --> 52:39.380]  could be wrong I'm no scientist but 50% of American kids are on some kind of
[52:39.380 --> 52:46.420]  medication right that's 50% adults 20 50% of kids on some kind of medication and
[52:46.420 --> 52:50.780]  we vaccinate the most and notice it says our population is dropping on NPR
[52:50.780 --> 52:55.220]  brought to you by a big pharma they got big pharma as the advertiser when you
[52:55.220 --> 52:58.260]  go look at the program shots it's it's underwritten by the big and black so
[52:58.260 --> 53:01.900]  Smith Klein folks it's social engineering you wonder why people are like
[53:01.900 --> 53:05.100]  zombies you wonder why there's effect let's play a clip from Paul Watson's
[53:05.100 --> 53:09.020]  report on this lady last week and you go out of these anti-trump events they're
[53:09.020 --> 53:12.620]  like zombies whether you love Trump or hating they attack you they yell they
[53:12.620 --> 53:19.260]  scream they they act like zombies let's play a clip here it is this is that was
[53:19.260 --> 53:23.460]  a good clip I like that clip and there you go ladies and gentlemen that and now
[53:23.460 --> 53:27.700]  for something completely different are we gonna have that clip from Paul Watson
[53:27.700 --> 53:31.140]  zombie deal all right we'll play it sometime you know these live computers
[53:31.140 --> 53:38.580]  right over there I know what you're thinking this is just one individual
[53:38.580 --> 53:43.420]  this isn't an accurate portrayal of the reasoned credible legitimate anti-Trump
[53:43.420 --> 53:45.900]  protest movement
[53:45.900 --> 53:57.420]  oh this is how they act this is like normal you got to any event this happens
[53:57.420 --> 54:00.460]  none of them work
[54:00.460 --> 54:22.740]  accuse DC I want to show more of the zombie later let's extend it out yeah
[54:22.740 --> 54:28.100]  let's start it from the beginning can we do that I want to start it from the
[54:28.100 --> 54:31.820]  beginning just so people can see this lady it's online goes on for like 30
[54:31.820 --> 54:35.380]  minutes her howling with her tongue hanging out the thing is Eddie if you
[54:35.380 --> 54:39.220]  go to these events this is how people act here it is now for something completely
[54:39.220 --> 54:41.620]  different
[54:42.020 --> 54:49.180]  when there's no more room in hell the dead will walk here
[54:49.180 --> 54:56.980]  it's more like babies throwing fish but they're all super pale little potbellies
[54:56.980 --> 55:10.140]  and they just look like I'm dead the letters just a tongue hang on
[55:10.140 --> 55:25.100]  look at this this and that's what you see in mental institutions wait give her
[55:25.100 --> 55:29.420]  a chance when she calms down she might have an actual argument
[55:29.420 --> 55:33.420]  stop any that was amazing we're not trying to be mean to these people what
[55:33.420 --> 55:40.940]  do you think of this I don't know man it's massive noses I don't know I think
[55:40.940 --> 55:43.940]  people are the way you say I know all this you and Joe and I'm not kissing Joe's
[55:43.940 --> 55:48.140]  butter here but on the show Joe knew more about pizza game stuff than I did
[55:48.140 --> 55:51.980]  he was finishing my sentences and so I misspoke for folks I talked to saying
[55:51.980 --> 55:55.060]  maybe Joe got threatened he did not you know that's all that was wrong when I
[55:55.060 --> 55:58.740]  said that but seriously why doesn't Joe do a separate show there's a conspiracy
[55:58.740 --> 56:03.340]  theories it's crazy admitted stuff that's really going on if Joe knows as much as
[56:03.340 --> 56:06.620]  I do or more you're over here laying out all the facts just as good as I can or
[56:06.620 --> 56:10.500]  better I mean I I think you guys should start doing a whole conspiracy
[56:10.500 --> 56:16.700]  podcast you already hosted a national TV show I don't think Joe wants to do a
[56:16.700 --> 56:20.740]  conspiracy podcast I think he wants to keep you know just doing what he's doing
[56:20.740 --> 56:24.500]  he's busy but more and more he is because he's not a liberal or conservative
[56:24.500 --> 56:28.620]  more rights what a libertarian kind of right I think but more and more he's
[56:28.620 --> 56:31.860]  getting mad at the liberals and just the dislike the young Turks how they call
[56:31.860 --> 56:34.620]  everybody a racist when they're not and I've seen that a lot of the show it's
[56:34.620 --> 56:38.660]  getting really big you know Brian Cowan who's also on the show too when we do
[56:38.660 --> 56:44.420]  fight companions he's about as far left as you can get as far pro government as
[56:44.420 --> 56:47.660]  you can get but he's been texting me the stuff that's been coming out in Vault
[56:47.660 --> 56:52.380]  7 he's been going whoa maybe there is some truth to what you're saying you
[56:52.380 --> 56:55.940]  know so even yeah it's not the government's bad itself there's rogue
[56:55.940 --> 57:01.140]  elements in there yeah if Brian Cowan is kind of awakening he's like he's like
[57:01.140 --> 57:06.980]  sort of awake you know in the sun he's kind of waking up so there's hope there's
[57:06.980 --> 57:11.500]  no that was crazy Joe talked about that like literally almost all the comments
[57:11.500 --> 57:14.100]  were positive all these people that hated me said wow actually like Alex
[57:14.100 --> 57:19.540]  Jones now yeah they actually heard me talk yeah and the more people hated me
[57:19.540 --> 57:23.060]  it didn't bother me that much because it meant that they wanted to listen to you
[57:23.060 --> 57:27.820]  more that they were mad at me in her for interrupting you so for me the main
[57:27.820 --> 57:32.820]  thing for me was that people listen to you you got all the facts you got all
[57:32.820 --> 57:36.540]  the documents I'm trying to direct people to listen to you a lot of it's not
[57:36.540 --> 57:40.100]  even that I mean if I get a listener tells me get John P. Holdren's book he
[57:40.100 --> 57:43.700]  talks about fluoride to sterilize this and make us dumb I go get the book and
[57:43.700 --> 57:46.940]  he says it in there and that's not that smart how crazy is it that people are
[57:46.940 --> 57:50.460]  okay with fluoride in our water how crazy is that even Harvard admits take it
[57:50.460 --> 57:53.660]  out it's causing cancer they just won't do it they just they just laugh and go
[57:53.660 --> 58:00.620]  you're good people don't seem to mind up fluoride in the water they don't well
[58:00.620 --> 58:03.220]  then they go well you need some for yeah you'll die without a small amount of
[58:03.220 --> 58:06.940]  calcium fluoride we're talking about hydrofluorosalicylic yeah it's it's
[58:06.940 --> 58:10.780]  acid out of fluoride and it's and people think that the government really cares
[58:10.780 --> 58:13.580]  about our teeth like they're doing it to take care of our teeth let's put that
[58:13.580 --> 58:16.020]  article back up because every time we put them up there's a pop-up on all these
[58:16.020 --> 58:19.340]  sides but I want to put it back up the crew does a great job after a pop-up
[58:19.340 --> 58:22.460]  pops up they take it down and then we never see it now there it is impact of
[58:22.460 --> 58:27.460]  fluoride neurological development in children it's Trump doing it does he
[58:27.460 --> 58:30.380]  know about the whole right he knows all of it he just he's trying to get the
[58:30.380 --> 58:34.100]  economy turned back on somebody gets on his side and the vaccines the fluoride
[58:34.100 --> 58:39.100]  the geoengineering it's all over is he aware of stratospheric I haven't talked
[58:39.100 --> 58:42.620]  to him specifically but I mentioned other they go yeah he knows the word was
[58:42.620 --> 58:47.060]  from high-level CIA they go the president knows everything they've all
[58:47.060 --> 58:50.940]  told him he knows everything over back he knows more than we know we have the
[58:50.940 --> 58:55.820]  new product and enforce life comm bio true selenium we've had so many requests
[58:55.820 --> 59:00.060]  over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a
[59:00.060 --> 59:05.940]  certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract when you take
[59:05.940 --> 59:10.020]  selenium in the body it actually benefits the detoxification systems in
[59:10.020 --> 59:15.420]  your body it helps balance the thyroid gland it helps detoxify selenium is
[59:15.420 --> 59:19.820]  another one of those absolute must-have the highest concentration of selenium is
[59:19.820 --> 59:23.020]  in the thyroid gland but it's actually used all over the body as a matter of
[59:23.020 --> 59:28.900]  fact there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium so
[59:28.900 --> 59:34.860]  it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs I'm taking it now
[59:34.860 --> 59:39.740]  every day this is so key bio true selenium is the product the best
[59:39.740 --> 59:42.340]  selenium that we could bring you we believe it's the best out there at a
[59:42.340 --> 59:46.020]  very very low price exclusively available at m4warslife.com or by
[59:46.020 --> 59:50.940]  calling toll-free triple eight two five three three one three nine
[59:51.740 --> 59:57.100]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show

[1:00:23.180 --> 1:00:34.980]  network
[1:00:34.980 --> 1:00:38.540]  coming up in the next segment we're gonna show you that Joe Rogan kicked it's a
[1:00:38.540 --> 1:00:41.740]  lot of the best out there according to Eddie Bravo and give us some other issues
[1:00:41.740 --> 1:00:44.860]  but Eddie stop saying I'm the one that's the expert the show is all about
[1:00:44.860 --> 1:00:49.380]  everybody doing their own research Paul Watson goes out you know twelve years
[1:00:49.380 --> 1:00:52.460]  ago and finds Google saying we're watching you over the camera we're
[1:00:52.460 --> 1:00:56.140]  listening to you over the microphone in a press release to shareholders about a
[1:00:56.140 --> 1:01:00.780]  new form of advertising so anybody can do this and you're just as smart or
[1:01:00.780 --> 1:01:04.780]  smarter than I am so I doubt that BS and what it what is research too humble
[1:01:04.780 --> 1:01:09.900]  let's define research because some people think that getting on the internet
[1:01:09.900 --> 1:01:13.540]  is not research you you have to go to a library or something we know what's
[1:01:13.540 --> 1:01:18.420]  research mean research means okay well they have all these reports that can
[1:01:18.420 --> 1:01:23.220]  get on the internet and do research yes okay can you get on YouTube and do
[1:01:23.220 --> 1:01:28.020]  research yes okay I mean some people think oh it's weird that the same people
[1:01:28.020 --> 1:01:32.780]  that say there was a guy on Joe Rogan's podcast some paleontologists he's like
[1:01:32.780 --> 1:01:38.780]  isn't it isn't it fucking um oh I'm sorry so we're gonna delay is that isn't it
[1:01:38.780 --> 1:01:44.940]  amazing that we have all the information of all time on our watch isn't that
[1:01:44.940 --> 1:01:48.820]  amazing it's incredible this is a real any Bravo it's an incredible time really
[1:01:48.820 --> 1:01:53.700]  test words are coming and then all of a sudden you the dinosaurs are replicas do
[1:01:53.700 --> 1:01:58.980]  it for me I love it did you know that did you know that that all the the
[1:01:58.980 --> 1:02:02.380]  skeletons of dinosaurs and all the museums are all replicas they're not
[1:02:02.380 --> 1:02:05.300]  because the real bones are too sensitive and then I want people touching them so
[1:02:05.300 --> 1:02:08.420]  they lock them up so no one could see them so all the skeletons that you see
[1:02:08.420 --> 1:02:13.540]  did you know this I didn't know this they're replicas is not weird I want to
[1:02:13.540 --> 1:02:17.460]  take it weird I want to take you to the Natural History Museum the only reason
[1:02:17.460 --> 1:02:19.860]  to have it they're gonna have a headline and I don't see an Alex Jones says
[1:02:19.860 --> 1:02:24.460]  dinosaurs weren't real I'm gonna tell you right now I believe in it and I but
[1:02:24.460 --> 1:02:28.020]  they're such liars in media and science and have been caught with big line all
[1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:31.860]  the big stuff with piltdown man and all the fake early humanoids they claim
[1:02:31.860 --> 1:02:35.860]  they dug up yes there's a big history of paleontologists and archaeologists
[1:02:35.860 --> 1:02:40.500]  faking things that's an admitted if that Google history of archaeologists
[1:02:40.500 --> 1:02:45.940]  faking finds it's it's it's epidemic it's massive it's a big problem so you're
[1:02:45.940 --> 1:02:51.900]  right to question yeah all you know if there's something out there that I got
[1:02:51.900 --> 1:02:57.100]  to take some unknown scientist word for some unknown government scientists
[1:02:57.100 --> 1:02:59.860]  word for it and there's science that we don't know anything about the
[1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:03.740]  experiments you know we just got to take someone's word for it a government
[1:03:03.740 --> 1:03:09.460]  scientist well my grandfather was an archaeology major at UT yeah I have to
[1:03:09.460 --> 1:03:15.100]  world war two as before or to the policy and he was involved out for them when
[1:03:15.100 --> 1:03:18.100]  they're building like Travis when you know when they found stuff and he saw
[1:03:18.100 --> 1:03:23.020]  them dig up the plesiosaur that's at UT so if you go to UT a lot of the places
[1:03:23.020 --> 1:03:26.620]  have these big giant ones were only a few pieces are real and they will fall
[1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:29.740]  apart they try to weld all those together so plastics easier they think the
[1:03:29.740 --> 1:03:33.140]  public's dumb but you go to UT you go to natural history museum you go
[1:03:33.140 --> 1:03:37.060]  downstairs nobody wants to look at it you'll see a hundred percent real
[1:03:37.060 --> 1:03:41.140]  dinosaurs all over the place it's it's it's it's just they're not replicas
[1:03:41.140 --> 1:03:46.780]  they're not replicas okay all right but but but but what but what my my point
[1:03:46.780 --> 1:03:50.460]  are you about how long ago they were really here
[1:03:50.460 --> 1:03:56.900]  well like well my point is if you go to museum and there's a there's a dinosaur
[1:03:56.900 --> 1:04:01.660]  skeleton and it's a replica it's only cool to see a dinosaur skeleton if it's
[1:04:01.660 --> 1:04:05.580]  a real dinosaur skeleton if it's fake you might as well put skin on it no I
[1:04:05.580 --> 1:04:08.300]  agree when you go to the New York Metropolitan thing or the Smithsonian
[1:04:08.300 --> 1:04:12.900]  most of it are replicas they only cool if they're real if it's not and they
[1:04:12.900 --> 1:04:15.720]  call it and then they call it a conspiracy theory if you say it's a
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:19.620]  replica why are they showing us replicas yeah why not just put fake skin on it
[1:04:19.620 --> 1:04:24.020]  too and just it's only cool to see a skeleton my chance of that walking with
[1:04:24.020 --> 1:04:27.460]  dinosaurs with the robots come out yeah you might as well just maybe that's real
[1:04:27.460 --> 1:04:30.660]  huh fake the whole thing now you've got a great point because what do you do when
[1:04:30.660 --> 1:04:33.820]  the media gets caught lying so much it then discredits all of it I mean who
[1:04:33.820 --> 1:04:39.420]  knows what's real huh yeah and you know something that existed 60 million years
[1:04:39.420 --> 1:04:44.580]  ago come on you got a you got a question you got a I just love how Joe says
[1:04:44.580 --> 1:04:49.900]  they're in breaks like Eddie doesn't think dinosaurs are real I'm just
[1:04:49.900 --> 1:04:53.260]  questioning it man no no I hear you look look look an alligator is not in the
[1:04:53.260 --> 1:04:57.460]  dinosaur family but it's even predates dinosaurs yeah I mean you got a 24-foot
[1:04:57.460 --> 1:05:01.820]  long saltwater crocodile that's dinosaur a previously debunked claim
[1:05:01.820 --> 1:05:07.100]  alleging then candidate Donald Trump ran a secret server to communicate with
[1:05:07.100 --> 1:05:12.860]  Russia during the 2016 presidential race has resurfaced the establishment
[1:05:12.860 --> 1:05:17.900]  mainstream media is now rehashing the story which has already been debunked
[1:05:17.900 --> 1:05:23.540]  after president Donald Trump on Saturday accused his predecessor Barack Obama of
[1:05:23.540 --> 1:05:28.500]  illegally wiretapping phone calls at New York's Trump Tower mainstream media
[1:05:28.500 --> 1:05:33.260]  outlets began to list possible surveillance targets including Trump's
[1:05:33.260 --> 1:05:38.820]  so-called secret server to talk with the Russians and look who's spreading the
[1:05:38.820 --> 1:05:43.820]  fake news Hillary Clinton posted on Twitter that it's time for Trump to
[1:05:43.820 --> 1:05:49.700]  answer serious questions about his ties to Russia and she included a link to the
[1:05:49.700 --> 1:05:54.980]  original slate article that started the bogus rumor to begin with you can check

[1:07:12.700 --> 1:07:18.340]  researchers scientists and the answer is clear iodine is key is paramount and
[1:07:18.340 --> 1:07:22.500]  there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even
[1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:26.660]  keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine we drill down more than
[1:07:26.660 --> 1:07:32.020]  7,000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine
[1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:36.580]  on top of that we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling it is the
[1:07:36.580 --> 1:07:40.860]  purest cleanest strongest out there quite frankly I'm flattered that with the
[1:07:40.860 --> 1:07:45.460]  launch of survival shield Nathan iodine that major brands and major companies
[1:07:45.460 --> 1:07:48.300]  have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been
[1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:53.500]  unable to come up with anything even close to what we have it is exclusive to
[1:07:53.500 --> 1:08:00.780]  infowarslife.com and the info wars life family of incredible products
[1:08:00.780 --> 1:08:24.500]  you know during the break Fox News and CNN and Stafford on in there in the
[1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:29.460]  control room and it was like White House under increasing pressure to show the
[1:08:29.460 --> 1:08:33.420]  evidence of wiretapping there's no such thing the CIA and Google and
[1:08:33.420 --> 1:08:37.180]  everybody just admits they tap hundreds of millions of people a day and they
[1:08:37.180 --> 1:08:40.940]  just admitted they were listening to General Flynn at Trump Tower and we've
[1:08:40.940 --> 1:08:44.460]  got top CIA people coming out saying that he was under surveillance they're
[1:08:44.460 --> 1:08:49.180]  like how dare Trump we want to impeach him Bloomberg says like here it is
[1:08:49.180 --> 1:08:55.980]  Trump's wiretap tweets raise risk of impeachment Noah Feldman I mean this is
[1:08:55.980 --> 1:09:02.500]  crazy they turn it all around it should be wow vault seven cameras on your phone
[1:09:02.500 --> 1:09:06.900]  cameras on your computer the sensors the audio listening to you with that
[1:09:06.900 --> 1:09:11.500]  that's been out forever they turn it all around how dare Trump say Obama was
[1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:14.780]  spying on him when they admittedly remember a month ago they said we heard
[1:09:14.780 --> 1:09:18.260]  General Flynn with the Russians we were we were wiretapping him so Trump goes
[1:09:18.260 --> 1:09:21.820]  what are you doing wiretapping me you're crazy we didn't wiretap you I mean the
[1:09:21.820 --> 1:09:25.300]  games they play Eddie Bravo of 10th planet you did still on top jiu-jitsu

[1:10:15.100 --> 1:10:19.140]  the dinosaur thing really quick if you want to look into the the whole dude
[1:10:19.140 --> 1:10:25.220]  dinos did dinosaurs really exist go to YouTube look up Eric Dubey's dinosaurs
[1:10:25.220 --> 1:10:29.060]  don't exist and then decide for yourself you know what's crazy who's the
[1:10:29.060 --> 1:10:32.740]  Christian guy forget his name I've had him on who's the guy in Florida have the
[1:10:32.740 --> 1:10:41.100]  Dino Museum will you agree can't can't holland holland
[1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:45.460]  hovind okay it's real distorted your you guys feed to me the last few weeks I've
[1:10:45.460 --> 1:10:53.860]  not really betched about it but it's just like it's like I'm not mad they
[1:10:53.860 --> 1:10:57.580]  keep repeating stuff to me because I just have to like portend what's being
[1:10:57.580 --> 1:11:04.360]  said down the system but yeah he just did this creation museum and saying the
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:08.860]  dinosaurs you know live before the flood they they threw his ass in prison
[1:11:08.860 --> 1:11:13.260]  yeah let's you know for question I don't know they said it was tax evasion
[1:11:13.260 --> 1:11:16.940]  you had a 501c3 for his religious beliefs you're supposed to have that I
[1:11:16.940 --> 1:11:20.700]  mean if they could have 501c3s to find people to go kill cops why can't why
[1:11:20.700 --> 1:11:24.780]  can't that guy have that yeah yeah I don't know anything about that guy though
[1:11:24.780 --> 1:11:29.540]  but Eric Dubey YouTube that guy he's he breaks it down it's pretty entertaining
[1:11:29.540 --> 1:11:34.780]  at the very least we should have Dr. Kent hovind back on the broadcast he's a
[1:11:34.780 --> 1:11:42.380]  good guy now I'm getting serious though what do you make be honest of Trump man
[1:11:42.380 --> 1:11:47.420]  Eve I don't know you know because when you when you listen to I love listening
[1:11:47.420 --> 1:11:51.540]  to CIA whistleblowers like John Stockwell I love listening to him and what he
[1:11:51.540 --> 1:11:58.620]  says what the CIA does is there they're basically their job is to take out
[1:11:58.620 --> 1:12:05.540]  leaders that are not playing ball economically internationally right yes
[1:12:05.540 --> 1:12:09.900]  so if you think about all the country south of the United States of Mexico
[1:12:09.900 --> 1:12:15.700]  Guatemala Columbia Argentina Brazil they're all in shambles economically right
[1:12:15.700 --> 1:12:20.820]  yes all those countries and to think that the US is immune to that all these
[1:12:20.820 --> 1:12:24.100]  countries I don't know how many countries does that 30 countries south of
[1:12:24.100 --> 1:12:28.340]  the United States something like that all of them all of them in shambles
[1:12:28.340 --> 1:12:33.540]  economically right yes I don't know so to think that it seems like the people
[1:12:33.540 --> 1:12:37.540]  that the globalists that's that's the formula well the IMF the World Bank
[1:12:37.540 --> 1:12:40.300]  admittedly in their own documents that relate to 2002 they want to keep the
[1:12:40.300 --> 1:12:44.300]  third world poor but it's Eastern Europe or Latin America and what and and it
[1:12:44.300 --> 1:12:47.820]  seems like that's the formula let's just keep everybody and now they want that
[1:12:47.820 --> 1:12:51.540]  the globalists want to make the West poor now to to control exactly and Trump
[1:12:51.540 --> 1:12:56.700]  look at this 290,000 new jobs massive new factories moving back it seems like
[1:12:56.700 --> 1:13:00.540]  he's blocking that so let's say you asked me about Trump either what you're
[1:13:00.540 --> 1:13:06.140]  saying about Trump is the truth and I'm behind Trump or maybe the globalist
[1:13:06.140 --> 1:13:11.460]  thought what how do we crush the US economy and make them just like all the
[1:13:11.460 --> 1:13:15.300]  other countries in the Western Hemisphere maybe maybe if we let Donald
[1:13:15.300 --> 1:13:19.300]  Trump be president people will freak out will aid the freak out maybe they
[1:13:19.300 --> 1:13:23.940]  wanted Trump and so that to divide us that's actually true I don't know that's
[1:13:23.940 --> 1:13:27.260]  actually early on they thought Trump was easily beaten and blow up in their
[1:13:27.260 --> 1:13:31.380]  face they wanted him I could tell every thinking he'd lose but they didn't
[1:13:31.380 --> 1:13:35.180]  understand that the public was awake see there's a lot of smart folks in these
[1:13:35.180 --> 1:13:38.540]  agencies but the politicians like Hillary don't listen anymore if they
[1:13:38.540 --> 1:13:42.260]  were in charge they're completely disconnected from reality they don't
[1:13:42.260 --> 1:13:46.580]  know what they're doing Trump completely bit them in the butt but if I hope
[1:13:46.580 --> 1:13:51.100]  that's true I hope that's oh he's real but if it's look at the MSN how much
[1:13:51.100 --> 1:13:56.300]  they hate him yep but but maybe that's maybe the globalists or whoever's in
[1:13:56.300 --> 1:14:00.660]  charge the Illuminati or whatever maybe the plan was like how do we crush
[1:14:00.660 --> 1:14:05.780]  America's economy let's get Trump in there he's gonna in Trump's it's probably
[1:14:05.780 --> 1:14:09.620]  not even involved in it in that he's actually trying to do the right very
[1:14:09.620 --> 1:14:12.620]  globalism's in trouble all of the world though they're trying to force feed it
[1:14:12.620 --> 1:14:16.020]  they were aired again it's failing they're not invincible okay you know what
[1:14:16.020 --> 1:14:18.740]  the Illuminati means I want to believe that you know what the Illuminati means
[1:14:18.740 --> 1:14:23.060]  the illuminated ones yeah and actually there was a renaissance against tyranny
[1:14:23.060 --> 1:14:27.580]  and then the corrupt groups tried to take over movements of the renaissance
[1:14:27.580 --> 1:14:31.220]  they call themselves the Illuminati they were the ones trying to hijack the
[1:14:31.220 --> 1:14:36.700]  renaissance and end it so the the false Illuminati calls it salty Illuminati but
[1:14:36.700 --> 1:14:40.820]  there's a real Illuminati and nobody's even officially part of it it's just
[1:14:40.820 --> 1:14:44.500]  anybody that wants to empower humanity okay so you could say I'm one of the
[1:14:44.500 --> 1:14:47.660]  leaders of the Illuminati worldwide and you could probably argue I'm the leader
[1:14:47.660 --> 1:14:52.020]  of the Illuminati or Donald Trump is they're gonna sample that well I mean
[1:14:52.020 --> 1:14:55.180]  let's get one Jones thinks he's a little bit he admits he's little Illuminati
[1:14:55.180 --> 1:14:58.740]  well I do actually George Washington was the leader of the Illuminati the real
[1:14:58.740 --> 1:15:02.180]  Illuminati and then the French Revolution was the false Illuminati this
[1:15:02.180 --> 1:15:05.620]  was all in his letters this was known they really wanted to they wanted to end
[1:15:05.620 --> 1:15:09.860]  in slavery it didn't mean they got it done but they had this idea of empowering
[1:15:09.860 --> 1:15:14.260]  humanity that was meant illuminated God is the real life Lucifer is the light
[1:15:14.260 --> 1:15:18.700]  bearer the false light so God is the real illumination there's a false
[1:15:18.700 --> 1:15:22.420]  counterfeit so the Illuminati we know of it does all this bad stuff all the
[1:15:22.420 --> 1:15:25.420]  devil worship and stuff and compromising people in sex orgies and things
[1:15:25.420 --> 1:15:28.900]  that's how they did it back then now it's child molestation back then you get
[1:15:28.900 --> 1:15:34.620]  in trouble for his orgy with women okay what when you know 240 years ago now
[1:15:34.620 --> 1:15:38.060]  that it's got to be child molestation and notice Trump's exposing all that he's
[1:15:38.060 --> 1:15:42.100]  rolling that up town hall why is MSM ignoring Trump's sex-travelling bus but
[1:15:42.100 --> 1:15:48.740]  I'm not I don't go to secret rituals I'm not in some group I'm not I mean I'm
[1:15:48.740 --> 1:15:52.700]  with the Renaissance true human empowerment it's just an idea that's
[1:15:52.700 --> 1:15:57.660]  the real illumination versus the false elimination that's the Illuminati let's
[1:15:57.660 --> 1:16:02.060]  expand on that I got invited I got told by a major movie star who was a road
[1:16:02.060 --> 1:16:06.220]  scholar that you're gonna be invited to Oxford in the next couple months and
[1:16:06.220 --> 1:16:08.780]  it's not just gonna be an Oxford you're not just gonna speak to the faculty
[1:16:08.780 --> 1:16:12.340]  they're gonna want you to go in these underground caves and do sex rituals
[1:16:12.340 --> 1:16:15.380]  and then you're gonna be in the Illuminati and I said okay yeah whatever
[1:16:15.380 --> 1:16:18.060]  and then all and then I got to call an official letterhead you don't come to
[1:16:18.060 --> 1:16:21.340]  speak at Oxford I said no Cambridge you know called that's a different group and
[1:16:21.340 --> 1:16:24.380]  it was really they were in they were telling me come to the thing going on
[1:16:24.380 --> 1:16:27.860]  the group and Benjamin Franklin had gone and lived in England actually been part
[1:16:27.860 --> 1:16:30.780]  of those it was the Hellfire Club so I've been invited to the Hellfire Club in
[1:16:30.780 --> 1:16:37.020]  England that that's real brother all my kids that's real so you understand this
[1:16:37.020 --> 1:16:43.220]  stuff's real yeah it's pretty crazy right yeah I mean doesn't it's is so is
[1:16:43.220 --> 1:16:47.820]  there I know there was a bust in Southern California they bust like 400
[1:16:47.820 --> 1:16:52.220]  people for some kind of child thousands now yeah but isn't there was there a new
[1:16:52.220 --> 1:16:57.300]  one that all over New York Pennsylvania politicians this time yeah well
[1:16:57.300 --> 1:17:00.660]  they're getting the handlers and said dusky son you name them here is that's
[1:17:00.660 --> 1:17:05.460]  all is this town hall or is it no this is so that's KTLA yeah that was the one
[1:17:05.460 --> 1:17:08.860]  I was caught up the day I was out there and it goes on the day before now which
[1:17:08.860 --> 1:17:12.340]  is the latest one the latest one the president was just it's just sex
[1:17:12.340 --> 1:17:15.260]  traveling rings are being busted everywhere because they knew where they
[1:17:15.260 --> 1:17:17.980]  were they were never allowed to bust them because they were procuring kids I
[1:17:17.980 --> 1:17:21.380]  wonder all these articles do you think that could be the reason there's such
[1:17:21.380 --> 1:17:25.500]  a resistance against Trump because he's busting these people absolutely not a
[1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:31.220]  powerful yeah and it seems it seems like according to Ted Gunderson if you
[1:17:31.220 --> 1:17:36.380]  look at using he was a great guy ex FBI tried dead on he was the one talking
[1:17:36.380 --> 1:17:43.820]  about this gigantic he exposed on my show Penn State like 15 year I was like
[1:17:43.820 --> 1:17:46.460]  saying sir don't say that during the breaks I don't want to get sued he
[1:17:46.460 --> 1:17:50.620]  exposed Boys Town before it broke he exposed Penn State he told me about the
[1:17:50.620 --> 1:17:55.700]  British Prime Minister from his sources and MI5 slitting kids' throats that was
[1:17:55.700 --> 1:17:59.180]  just in the news last week the Major Police Chief says he was a pedophile I
[1:17:59.180 --> 1:18:03.500]  learned about from other sources I mean it's incredible well Ted Gunderson again
[1:18:03.500 --> 1:18:08.620]  he's has many videos on you he's dead now but yeah he thought didn't he think
[1:18:08.620 --> 1:18:11.620]  they were killing him and poisoning him oh they did that they touched his blood he
[1:18:11.620 --> 1:18:17.540]  was arsenic yeah he's tough guy man and he said he not only they poisoned I'm
[1:18:17.540 --> 1:18:21.460]  allowed to get into it they poisoned three other people and he was in the FBI
[1:18:21.460 --> 1:18:26.260]  for 27 years he was the head of California yes and you could there's
[1:18:26.260 --> 1:18:32.220]  many videos of Ted Gunderson former FBI Chief he talking about not only the
[1:18:32.220 --> 1:18:37.220]  gigantic pedophile ring that's going on nationally and internationally but he
[1:18:37.220 --> 1:18:40.740]  was talking about the Satanism that's involved as well and people think well
[1:18:40.740 --> 1:18:44.660]  that's the deal here's that you're crazy for you look a regular gang whether
[1:18:44.660 --> 1:18:48.020]  it's white supremacist or Mexican gang you got to go rob a liquor store you got
[1:18:48.020 --> 1:18:50.700]  to hit it away in the head with a gun you got to shoot somebody you got to
[1:18:50.700 --> 1:18:54.220]  kill a rival gang member those are rituals yeah earn your bones yeah you
[1:18:54.220 --> 1:18:58.140]  know I earn my bones when you were with cheerleaders you know you know from from
[1:18:58.140 --> 1:19:04.460]  the from the godfather from so but that's not enough that's just showing
[1:19:04.460 --> 1:19:09.580]  you'll kill somebody they got dirt on you've got took you got to hurt kids and
[1:19:09.580 --> 1:19:13.900]  it's not just molest them the highest levels they they they kill them and they
[1:19:13.900 --> 1:19:16.820]  do something something about baby blood right there's something well they
[1:19:16.820 --> 1:19:19.900]  terrorize the kid then they drain their blood off while they pump all their
[1:19:19.900 --> 1:19:23.980]  hormones out and they care then they drink all the adrenaline and all this
[1:19:23.980 --> 1:19:28.740]  and then the essence yeah so could my life Satanist groups have been caught
[1:19:28.740 --> 1:19:32.740]  doing that wouldn't it be smart for the people that are running these rings the
[1:19:32.740 --> 1:19:37.260]  people at the top to get as many people involved as possible right in high
[1:19:37.260 --> 1:19:44.500]  places and powerful places it seems like there's this giant a resistance for
[1:19:44.500 --> 1:19:48.540]  Trump he just seems like well listen how to have something to do they're coming
[1:19:48.540 --> 1:19:52.580]  after me I mean I can't get into it on air but they have we already lost this
[1:19:52.580 --> 1:19:55.460]  year it'd be five million dollars that was all our extra budget more they they
[1:19:55.460 --> 1:19:58.740]  took it away Google Band us Facebook spending is bro I mean we're brilliant
[1:19:58.740 --> 1:20:01.660]  hard but I don't care I'm gonna keep going to the end I mean the listeners
[1:20:01.660 --> 1:20:06.740]  have come through but they're they're really this operation is like ify if we
[1:20:06.740 --> 1:20:10.300]  can even stay where we're at and I'm not trying to encourage the attacks but
[1:20:10.300 --> 1:20:13.620]  they're they're having an effect listen look what Facebook banned they banned two
[1:20:13.620 --> 1:20:20.460]  things yesterday with a Rand Paul interview when it's a senator how was
[1:20:20.460 --> 1:20:23.580]  that fake news they didn't even notify us they just banned it they told us today
[1:20:23.580 --> 1:20:28.060]  they're not a certain banning news that they say it's fake and then also former
[1:20:28.060 --> 1:20:31.900]  in fact pull this clip up guys and then I'll show the Joe Rogan kick former CI
[1:20:31.900 --> 1:20:36.420]  analyst Obama gave green light for NSA CIA to sabotage Trump former CIA
[1:20:36.420 --> 1:20:40.380]  analyst Larry C. Johnson says that according to his sources the Obama
[1:20:40.380 --> 1:20:46.580]  administration worked with the NSA and the CIA and Britain's GCHQ to disseminate
[1:20:46.580 --> 1:20:49.340]  information about Trump that was illegally obtained well they did
[1:20:49.340 --> 1:20:52.620]  illegally so they admittedly were surveilling they think we forgot a
[1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:56.660]  month ago the surveillance before the election Johnson joined the CIA 85 was
[1:20:56.660 --> 1:20:59.580]  it later promoted to become senior regional analysts for the Central
[1:20:59.580 --> 1:21:06.260]  Intelligence America that's over the US from Central America so south of here
[1:21:06.260 --> 1:21:09.380]  before moving on to his work with State Department and he went on to say it's a
[1:21:09.380 --> 1:21:12.940]  huge deal it's totally illegal and it's not their fault they keep missing clips
[1:21:12.940 --> 1:21:17.660]  I keep jumping around on that clip I'm going to do you guys have that clip ready
[1:21:17.660 --> 1:21:24.500]  let's go ahead and go to that clip from RT that is an admitted former CIA section
[1:21:24.500 --> 1:21:29.300]  analyst head that's over thousands of people over a whole region Central
[1:21:29.300 --> 1:21:34.700]  America also operated North America and he and he's telling RT this and we're
[1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:40.260]  not allowed to give you this on Facebook so it because this is fake no
[1:21:40.260 --> 1:21:43.740]  because we're because we told you 12 years ago they were using cameras on
[1:21:43.740 --> 1:21:48.260]  your computer to watch you it's because we're on target folks you think the
[1:21:48.260 --> 1:21:53.140]  president United States just calls regular people you think you think the
[1:21:53.140 --> 1:21:58.140]  heads of I mean I'm not gonna I shouldn't even get it all this see I
[1:21:58.140 --> 1:22:02.260]  should think the CIA was all the bad guys they were actually just the people
[1:22:02.260 --> 1:22:04.380]  fighting for the country with bad people above them and they were always
[1:22:04.380 --> 1:22:08.420]  getting burned as a course of action they would burn each new group of people
[1:22:08.420 --> 1:22:12.300]  to actually keep control of who the Patriots were like I grew up and it's a
[1:22:12.300 --> 1:22:17.700]  family that had been in covert action in the CIA like killing people and all I'd
[1:22:17.700 --> 1:22:22.020]  ever heard was you know no the government brings in the drugs they kill
[1:22:22.020 --> 1:22:28.620]  people you don't want to join it and so I had that view but over the years the
[1:22:28.620 --> 1:22:31.100]  people inside that know all this now have the internet they have us they have
[1:22:31.100 --> 1:22:35.660]  the people and so I've learned that like major SEAL teams fact the most elite
[1:22:35.660 --> 1:22:40.260]  SEAL team but Army Delta Force you name it years ago they would come in and
[1:22:40.260 --> 1:22:44.020]  order them to listen in force and I would hear this like you know 15 years
[1:22:44.020 --> 1:22:48.060]  ago go oh yeah I'm sure right yeah they're tell Delta Force listening it's all
[1:22:48.060 --> 1:22:51.660]  confirmed now and so they said there was no one else covering this they said you
[1:22:51.660 --> 1:22:57.260]  listen Alex Jones he knows what's going on and and that's just a fact now you
[1:22:57.260 --> 1:23:00.220]  know and people the media never runs with this because they always about what
[1:23:00.220 --> 1:23:02.500]  Trump well he talks about how the intelligence community really loves me
[1:23:02.500 --> 1:23:06.700]  so here we are saying the they're the enemy William Benny was the head of the
[1:23:06.700 --> 1:23:10.460]  NSA actually ran it not the director but the technical head he's a patriot he
[1:23:10.460 --> 1:23:13.860]  comes on all the time he exposed there they're the ones that exposed it any
[1:23:13.860 --> 1:23:19.460]  mm-hmm in fact I was told by Pechenik he was high level CIA used to run actual
[1:23:19.460 --> 1:23:22.620]  overthrow governments he said oh the next month they're gonna release even
[1:23:22.620 --> 1:23:27.620]  more on the CIA to discipline the top of the CIA the CIA released that on the CIA
[1:23:27.620 --> 1:23:32.660]  now dr. Steve Pechenik totally legit right oh yeah high-level I mean when he
[1:23:32.660 --> 1:23:36.300]  comes on the show it's in like Italian newspapers and then they said like you
[1:23:36.300 --> 1:23:39.860]  know FBI to his house and he's called before federal courts would I mean when
[1:23:39.860 --> 1:23:42.980]  he released a stuff they threatened with national security arrest doctor that's
[1:23:42.980 --> 1:23:46.100]  how really is dr. Steve Pechenik and you got some heat for this is kind of
[1:23:46.100 --> 1:23:52.620]  changing the subject a little bit dr. Steve Pechenik on your show said that no
[1:23:52.620 --> 1:23:58.900]  kids died at Sandy Hook that it was a homeland security drill that they passed
[1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:02.780]  off as a real he says that he said he said and I've been hit really hard with
[1:24:02.780 --> 1:24:05.740]  it I can't prove it one way or the other I know Anderson Cooper standing up there
[1:24:05.740 --> 1:24:09.700]  in turns his whole nose disappears I work in TV I know what a blue screen is
[1:24:09.700 --> 1:24:13.820]  bro yeah and I have one question about Sandy Hook the one question the tower
[1:24:13.820 --> 1:24:18.700]  seven questions why weren't that Medevac helicopter because the
[1:24:18.700 --> 1:24:24.060]  Pechenik ran the operation to overthrow at least seven countries yeah I mean
[1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:28.420]  that's on record yeah he co-wrote Tom Clancy's books he's he's the he's the
[1:24:28.420 --> 1:24:32.180]  Jack Ryan character yeah because that's because he used to be in covert
[1:24:32.180 --> 1:24:36.700]  action himself that's how he got into CIA was here's the big secret about the CIA
[1:24:36.700 --> 1:24:41.420]  like they've got hit man that are like former special forces and stuff that are
[1:24:41.420 --> 1:24:44.900]  Army Navy Marine Corps you know because that you like graduate out of the seals
[1:24:44.900 --> 1:24:49.500]  out of things into into basic squads that are put in strategic locations around
[1:24:49.500 --> 1:24:56.420]  the country sleeper cells and so that's basically what goes on but who they
[1:24:56.420 --> 1:25:01.060]  really have for assassins are doctors and psychiatrists and so a lot of these
[1:25:01.060 --> 1:25:03.700]  people you see that are doctors and psychiatrists and things that had up
[1:25:03.700 --> 1:25:07.460]  things that were oh in the Navy or in the Army they were all put their secret
[1:25:07.460 --> 1:25:11.100]  programs and a bunch of the stuff and they're the real hitman and it's and
[1:25:11.100 --> 1:25:13.820]  there's some weird thing in the government where it's a medical procedure
[1:25:13.820 --> 1:25:17.660]  we're doing like tortures all a medical procedure it's this thing with doctors
[1:25:17.660 --> 1:25:21.820]  so they send real hitman after you it's guys with medical degrees isn't that
[1:25:21.820 --> 1:25:26.500]  crazy mm-hmm Anderson it's all very professionally done though you
[1:25:26.500 --> 1:25:31.340]  mentioned Anderson Cooper what and people think he's he was in the CIA right
[1:25:31.340 --> 1:25:37.340]  yes and isn't was an operation mockingbird a CIA operation to infiltrate
[1:25:37.340 --> 1:25:41.460]  the media yes and Anderson Cooper was in the CIA right I saw articles saying
[1:25:41.460 --> 1:25:45.780]  he's not he mentally was and they go there's articles saying that no Muslims
[1:25:45.780 --> 1:25:49.180]  ever did a terror attack and that no such thing as Muslim extremism exists I
[1:25:49.180 --> 1:25:53.660]  saw CNN say that last night the Pope says it again they're at war with
[1:25:53.660 --> 1:25:58.300]  reality any I mean is there ever Islamic terror
[1:25:58.300 --> 1:26:03.360]  isn't it funded by exactly but the point is is there ever Islamists that blow
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:08.180]  stuff up yes okay I mean they say there isn't it's this mind game they're
[1:26:08.180 --> 1:26:12.820]  going Trump is crazy he says there's Islamic terror it doesn't exist what
[1:26:12.820 --> 1:26:17.980]  the hell are they talking about so they play these games that's a that's a weird
[1:26:17.980 --> 1:26:22.540]  one because I mean isn't that didn't didn't the Pentagon just get busted for
[1:26:22.540 --> 1:26:29.980]  spending a pan 500 million dollars to some UK PR firm for fake ISIS videos
[1:26:29.980 --> 1:26:36.460]  yes right oh definitely right Islam has been scapegoated and set up and
[1:26:36.460 --> 1:26:40.580]  radicalized but now the radical attacks real our government the criminal elements
[1:26:40.580 --> 1:26:44.180]  have fun in radical Islam first to fight the Soviets but then since then yeah to
[1:26:44.180 --> 1:26:48.500]  actually create this giant war so I don't want to kill Muslims the point is
[1:26:48.500 --> 1:26:52.220]  that we can't bring in people from Yemen and everybody knows you can't go to
[1:26:52.220 --> 1:26:55.660]  Somalia yeah I mean it's a failed state women literally are sold to slavery

[1:26:59.540 --> 1:27:05.460]  a good idea no absolutely not exactly so there it is Pentagon paid PR firm

[1:34:30.660 --> 1:34:35.380]  Lee and Macadam and I was sitting here going over all this
[1:34:35.380 --> 1:34:43.180]  Zuckerberg of Facebook is in trade publications PC World Bloomberg you
[1:34:43.180 --> 1:34:47.780]  name it saying I've completed the censorship in the US and perfected it
[1:34:47.780 --> 1:34:53.380]  I'm ready to enter the Chinese Communist market so he's proving himself like a
[1:34:53.380 --> 1:34:57.540]  whore shaking her ass or something at a brothel in front of the biggest mass
[1:34:57.540 --> 1:35:01.740]  murders in history the Communist Chinese that he's he censored the American
[1:35:01.740 --> 1:35:06.060]  people and guess who he censored they announced on Sunday USA Today but they're
[1:35:06.060 --> 1:35:10.260]  going to block questionable news or notify people to go to it no they're
[1:35:10.260 --> 1:35:13.780]  just banning Rand Paul's interview on infowars.com yesterday Senator Paul
[1:35:13.780 --> 1:35:17.900]  they're banning the CIA analyst on national TV saying because they didn't
[1:35:17.900 --> 1:35:21.420]  like it getting out that they're that his colleagues in the CIA said because he
[1:35:21.420 --> 1:35:27.820]  was a section chief over intelligence gathering and analysis they just block
[1:35:27.820 --> 1:35:33.860]  that and just delete it I mean this is huge this isn't like I said Ronald Reagan
[1:35:33.860 --> 1:35:38.420]  and Elvis just showed up in Vegas you know play the craps table they are
[1:35:38.420 --> 1:35:44.260]  censoring us and they're censoring hardcore news that backs up the president
[1:35:44.260 --> 1:35:48.420]  I mean there it's all over Fox CNN Bloomberg are all saying impeach the
[1:35:48.420 --> 1:35:52.860]  president how dare him claim they're unauthorized war tabs because we don't
[1:35:52.860 --> 1:35:56.340]  call them those we call them digital intercepts they're playing these games
[1:35:56.340 --> 1:36:02.020]  okay a wiretaps going into your actual phone line and doing it and so Dr.
[1:36:02.020 --> 1:36:04.540]  Griff I want to get into some of this news again to your big findings here in
[1:36:04.540 --> 1:36:10.580]  the and and and this is amazing info but this is reach crazy level now where
[1:36:10.580 --> 1:36:14.940]  Trump is they're in the news month ago saying we grab his intercepts he talked
[1:36:14.940 --> 1:36:18.260]  to the Russians and they admit nothing was said substantive just that meetings
[1:36:18.260 --> 1:36:23.140]  were being set up is which an incoming president does they flip it around and go
[1:36:23.140 --> 1:36:26.900]  we never said we were listening to Trump I mean it's like where's the
[1:36:26.900 --> 1:36:31.100]  attention span and then vault seven see it in as of this morning I've been
[1:36:31.100 --> 1:36:35.900]  following it since then was yet to cover vault seven the biggest data dump ever
[1:36:35.900 --> 1:36:40.780]  confirming they're doing fake Russian attacks to blame Trump they're black
[1:36:40.780 --> 1:36:46.380]  mailing Congress they're wiretapping or digital intercepting everybody they're
[1:36:46.380 --> 1:36:50.060]  turning the cameras on your house big corporations are doing it to gather data
[1:36:50.060 --> 1:36:54.620]  on you well yeah they said so in press releases I'd love to take that all the
[1:36:54.620 --> 1:36:58.260]  news like I guess Alex Jones is feeling pretty good right now that that's been
[1:36:58.260 --> 1:37:03.740]  all over the news yeah Jones believes in Bigfoot no I don't but he got proven
[1:37:03.740 --> 1:37:08.140]  right on this again what are they going to do this is such an epic moment right
[1:37:08.140 --> 1:37:14.780]  now as everything we talked about comes out here's the deal there been more than
[1:37:14.780 --> 1:37:20.620]  5,000 arrests of reported pedophiles hundreds of children in slavery rescued
[1:37:20.620 --> 1:37:24.180]  and it'll be reported once in the local news and nowhere and it's Trump behind
[1:37:24.180 --> 1:37:28.380]  it all saying I'll cover law enforcement who's been threatened if you do this the
[1:37:28.380 --> 1:37:37.940]  guy is a an angel but but I'll say this until one thing this new bill that
[1:37:37.940 --> 1:37:41.460]  Rand Paul came on talks about your stay has some real problems I'm going to
[1:37:41.460 --> 1:37:45.540]  cover those it and I know Trump said this is just for debate we'll see where it
[1:37:45.540 --> 1:37:49.820]  goes I want to repeal let's get it going this is what the Republican leadership
[1:37:49.820 --> 1:37:55.420]  brought out so this isn't Trump though he's trying to be positive but this is
[1:37:55.420 --> 1:38:00.220]  the first time I've seen Trump not 100% deliver on what he said he did and if he
[1:38:00.220 --> 1:38:05.460]  starts going sideways on this I'll cover it but but Dr. Group you're an army
[1:38:05.460 --> 1:38:08.740]  veteran yourself special operations have been involved in a lot of special task
[1:38:08.740 --> 1:38:11.660]  force you name it you've seen where all this is going I never made the
[1:38:11.660 --> 1:38:14.940]  government our enemy it was criminal elements of that government but I got
[1:38:14.940 --> 1:38:20.820]  to say the MVPs the Patriots the people that are leaking this the CIA is our
[1:38:20.820 --> 1:38:24.620]  biggest enemy our best friend the people at the top of it are globalist but it's
[1:38:24.620 --> 1:38:27.620]  the CIA that released fault seven they're admitting that now so there's a
[1:38:27.620 --> 1:38:32.500]  civil war in America what do you make of all this it's crazy it's a war that's
[1:38:32.500 --> 1:38:38.580]  going on right now and it's everything it was so deeply ingrained with DARPA and
[1:38:38.580 --> 1:38:43.220]  with Planned Parenthood and with all the control and the geo-engineering and
[1:38:43.220 --> 1:38:47.620]  all the chemicals and toxins and the support of Monsanto and the chemical
[1:38:47.620 --> 1:38:51.500]  companies that are destroying the earth airs a biological conspiracy yeah I mean
[1:38:51.500 --> 1:38:56.580]  if you look at all of the details that have been ingrained with the parties and
[1:38:56.580 --> 1:39:00.060]  just it's not just Democrat your dad developed this feeling on me he spoke
[1:39:00.060 --> 1:39:02.980]  out and suddenly died that's right so you had the men in black come to your
[1:39:02.980 --> 1:39:07.100]  house I did yes I did I was actually thrown in a bat in a black car and I
[1:39:07.100 --> 1:39:10.020]  had I went through all that and even when we were working with can't do in
[1:39:10.020 --> 1:39:17.300]  cancer research and we were coming up with extremely good results FDA rated my
[1:39:17.300 --> 1:39:20.940]  office basically said I can't you know took all my files basically said we
[1:39:20.940 --> 1:39:24.940]  can't share this information with anybody it's the disruption that Trump is
[1:39:24.940 --> 1:39:29.660]  bringing into a controlled organization that's been controlled and manipulated
[1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:35.180]  for hundreds of years and now you're starting to see some of these things
[1:39:35.180 --> 1:39:39.860]  being addressed I mean and hopefully you know for it the control of the
[1:39:39.860 --> 1:39:44.060]  population is what it all comes the good guys are striking back anybody in part
[1:39:44.060 --> 1:39:47.220]  strikes back the good guys are striking back right now you've been striking back
[1:39:47.220 --> 1:39:50.620]  since you got all the army I've been striking back we're all striking back
[1:39:50.620 --> 1:39:54.380]  and we're starting to win it's a good feeling I mean you but you're starting
[1:39:54.380 --> 1:40:01.220]  to see everything kind of start blooming now with everything that's going on in
[1:40:01.220 --> 1:40:05.380]  all the exposure I mean we've known about all the pedophilia stuff for a long
[1:40:05.380 --> 1:40:08.900]  time we've known about it that traces back to the MK Ultra we know about
[1:40:08.900 --> 1:40:12.620]  putting fluoride in the water traces back weed all of the research that I've
[1:40:12.620 --> 1:40:16.980]  done on bio weapons and that had been used on the American public and people
[1:40:16.980 --> 1:40:20.740]  ask where oh like the outbuilding White House science are John P. Holdren you
[1:40:20.740 --> 1:40:24.300]  know he wrote a book that 43 years ago admitting the whole plan yeah the thing
[1:40:24.300 --> 1:40:28.020]  isn't I just I have a hard time understanding why people just don't go
[1:40:28.020 --> 1:40:32.580]  do their own research see it's like yeah we did our own they admitted 12 years
[1:40:32.580 --> 1:40:36.340]  ago the cameras on your computer were watching you in press releases by Google
[1:40:36.340 --> 1:40:41.580]  to shareholders it's not like and then now it's all admitted right now it's all
[1:40:41.580 --> 1:40:48.220]  admitted and you know the whole vaccine agenda the plum island you know the
[1:40:48.220 --> 1:40:52.380]  testing of biological warfare on plum island it did all of this whether it's
[1:40:52.380 --> 1:40:56.940]  a fungus whether it's a virus of bio weapons that were used in Iraq that were
[1:40:56.940 --> 1:41:01.780]  sprayed in California with operation C spray where they sprayed a bunch of
[1:41:01.780 --> 1:41:06.500]  biological weapons all over the in San Francisco they tested biological weapons
[1:41:06.500 --> 1:41:10.620]  in New York and the classified they put in hepatitis shots for gay men in New
[1:41:10.620 --> 1:41:14.740]  York the age virus and you can actually pull this stuff up on Wikipedia now it's
[1:41:14.740 --> 1:41:18.780]  not like I'm like we're sitting here saying you know this stuff happened I
[1:41:18.780 --> 1:41:23.860]  mean yes I've got stacks and stacks of research just like you do and all of this
[1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:27.740]  stuff is it's almost out there it is out there for public knowledge it's not
[1:41:27.740 --> 1:41:32.900]  like I'm getting 90% of it yeah 90% of it that's what's crazy is this in US code
[1:41:32.900 --> 1:41:38.220]  title 50 chapter 32 subscription 1528 paragraph B that oh it's illegal to test
[1:41:38.220 --> 1:41:43.060]  on people secretly unless it's for law enforcement or research purposes and
[1:41:43.060 --> 1:41:47.340]  then that's how they take foster kids and radiate them and they're not radiating
[1:41:47.340 --> 1:41:50.820]  kids cuz they don't know what radiation does they're testing people that are
[1:41:50.820 --> 1:41:55.540]  being compromised like the Milgram experiment to follow orders to then run
[1:41:55.540 --> 1:42:00.060]  giant criminal operations just like they get kids people to molest kids to be
[1:42:00.060 --> 1:42:02.700]  part of the group or people to kill people to be part of the group they're
[1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:06.740]  testing to see what you'll do and the thing is all of the different things
[1:42:06.740 --> 1:42:10.820]  that they're using the whether it's fluoride or whatever whatever all of
[1:42:10.820 --> 1:42:16.580]  these things usually don't show symptoms for three to six months it's like what
[1:42:16.580 --> 1:42:20.060]  I'm gonna be talking about today which is the fungus epidemic the hidden fungus
[1:42:20.060 --> 1:42:24.020]  epidemic and yeast and mold that's by the way it's not just you it's in all the
[1:42:24.020 --> 1:42:28.460]  medical literature mainline doctors I talked to I know three people the last
[1:42:28.460 --> 1:42:33.260]  year who've had brain surgeries or their kids or their wives have three people
[1:42:33.260 --> 1:42:36.940]  because fungus is getting through the blood brain barrier and growing in the
[1:42:36.940 --> 1:42:43.220]  brain now I mean what the hell is that what the hell is that is that fungus is
[1:42:43.220 --> 1:42:48.100]  one of those things that loves sugar and we live in a society which again some
[1:42:48.100 --> 1:42:52.900]  people say that high fructose corn syrup you know was an attack on the on the
[1:42:52.900 --> 1:42:56.580]  population and it was developed that way it's got traces of mercury in it as well
[1:42:56.580 --> 1:43:02.980]  but when you crisis I have a Washington Post it meant 90% of soft drinks have
[1:43:02.980 --> 1:43:09.180]  illegal levels of lead and murder you can Google that I've been soft drinks high
[1:43:09.180 --> 1:43:12.700]  levels of lead mercury guys on the show folks go ahead when you contaminate the
[1:43:12.700 --> 1:43:18.300]  soil when you contaminate you know the the soil is contaminated because it's
[1:43:18.300 --> 1:43:24.820]  watered think about ages ago where the ancient people would take water from the
[1:43:24.820 --> 1:43:29.340]  local river and irrigate their fields and that water because there were fish in
[1:43:29.340 --> 1:43:32.620]  the water the fish were going to the bathroom so there was probiotics in
[1:43:32.620 --> 1:43:35.980]  there and that's how you got the soil-based microorganisms that's how
[1:43:35.980 --> 1:43:40.100]  the soil was living you've got it inoculated from the earth just like the
[1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:43.380]  earth so if you look at the earth and you look at our digestive tract it's
[1:43:43.380 --> 1:43:46.860]  almost exactly the same because our intestinal lining is almost like the
[1:43:46.860 --> 1:43:51.500]  soil and the soil of the earth that grows out of it so our our gut is linked
[1:43:51.500 --> 1:43:55.580]  to every single system in our body and keeps our bodies healthy so does the
[1:43:55.580 --> 1:43:58.540]  earth soil in the water supply supposed to keep everything healthy but we've
[1:43:58.540 --> 1:44:02.060]  cut down all kinds of trees we've poisoned the water we've poisoned the
[1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:05.940]  soil in that water that acid rain that comes down on the soil and we've been
[1:44:05.940 --> 1:44:10.540]  watering our soil and spraying the plants with heavy doses of atrazine and
[1:44:10.540 --> 1:44:13.860]  glyphosate and all that we've got solutions yeah I want to get to this
[1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:16.980]  next hour we got 15 minutes to look at this the whole next hour this is
[1:44:16.980 --> 1:44:19.740]  undoubtedly as I've already was researching this even obsessed with this
[1:44:19.740 --> 1:44:23.820]  for years you finally have something that really counters this in a big way and
[1:44:23.820 --> 1:44:28.140]  of course no one here at the office that's been taking the probiotics wants
[1:44:28.140 --> 1:44:30.780]  to come on air and say yeah I had irritable bowel syndrome or all these
[1:44:30.780 --> 1:44:34.740]  problems and then I took bomb defense from him for his life and literally they
[1:44:34.740 --> 1:44:38.820]  all say it's gone it's over I may talk him into coming on air and talk about it
[1:44:38.820 --> 1:44:44.420]  but this is next level this new product which I'll talk about right now my co
[1:44:44.420 --> 1:44:49.140]  zx yes let's briefly talk about my co zx the next hour we'll actually get into
[1:44:49.140 --> 1:44:52.380]  the news and the big stack of stuff you've got but it's available at info
[1:44:52.380 --> 1:44:57.300]  or store.com 10% off when you get it with biome defense the probiotic is the
[1:44:57.300 --> 1:45:01.380]  very best out there we've also have free shipping orders $50 or more and 10% off
[1:45:01.380 --> 1:45:05.140]  when you sign up for auto ship additionally on top of that and then you
[1:45:05.140 --> 1:45:07.700]  fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your
[1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:12.940]  family absolutely need but you should consult your healthcare provider this is
[1:45:12.940 --> 1:45:17.140]  not a game this is not a joke especially you have really big yeast levels or fun
[1:45:17.140 --> 1:45:20.140]  to see your body you know there can be some responses to this as you're
[1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:25.620]  flushing it but why is this product so powerful what does it do so we've been
[1:45:25.620 --> 1:45:29.420]  doing research just like you have on what's currently going on obviously we
[1:45:29.420 --> 1:45:33.340]  stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause
[1:45:33.340 --> 1:45:36.980]  of the problem which is why I've been that we want stuff for our own kids well
[1:45:36.980 --> 1:45:41.900]  we've been this is why we've addressed the president you know let's address the
[1:45:41.900 --> 1:45:44.900]  root cause of America's health problems but getting back to fungus it's becoming
[1:45:44.900 --> 1:45:49.420]  an increasing epidemic that's only getting killing bats everywhere other
[1:45:49.420 --> 1:45:53.540]  animals squirrels are dying fungus is were used as bio weapons so why is it
[1:45:53.540 --> 1:45:57.780]  suddenly killing so many mammals number one because our immune systems are
[1:45:57.780 --> 1:46:02.060]  suppressed because of the environment in which we live so our gut is unhealthy our
[1:46:02.060 --> 1:46:06.100]  liver is toxic yeah but why is it why is a wire bats all over the US wire
[1:46:06.100 --> 1:46:10.340]  fungus is suddenly killing entire you know 10 million bats in one cave I mean
[1:46:10.340 --> 1:46:15.180]  suddenly just devastating well because the bats environment is changing as well
[1:46:15.180 --> 1:46:19.700]  it's not like just we change the whole earth changes when the earth when the
[1:46:19.700 --> 1:46:25.100]  environment becomes an environment that's detrimental to the earth it also
[1:46:25.100 --> 1:46:29.300]  becomes that Google guys a mold and fungus killing bats it's all because
[1:46:29.300 --> 1:46:32.900]  bats are also there's more sugar out there too and I'm sure that that has a
[1:46:32.900 --> 1:46:36.660]  lot to do with it because the conversion and funguses are adapting and
[1:46:36.660 --> 1:46:40.020]  they're changing as a matter of fact there was a new fungus called Candida
[1:46:40.020 --> 1:46:44.380]  or is that was just really released which is a killer fungus as well fungus is
[1:46:44.380 --> 1:46:48.340]  something now reach the west coast it killed 7 million bats in one year yeah
[1:46:48.340 --> 1:46:52.940]  fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making
[1:46:52.940 --> 1:46:57.860]  changes to this formula for over 10 years I've had nobody here's the thing
[1:46:57.860 --> 1:47:01.460]  Alex when you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms you that you can look
[1:47:01.460 --> 1:47:06.260]  at fung symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body it's gonna show you're gonna
[1:47:06.260 --> 1:47:10.380]  pull up over a hundred symptoms everything from brain fog lack of energy
[1:47:10.380 --> 1:47:14.900]  insomnia headaches bowel problems joint pain it's joint pain it's linked to
[1:47:14.900 --> 1:47:18.260]  Crohn's disease infertility what about the obesity epidemic I know they test
[1:47:18.260 --> 1:47:23.060]  people that are really obese and like they're they're just colonized by fungus
[1:47:23.060 --> 1:47:27.180]  yeast overgrowth I have a study right here by Jacob Tiedelbaum at the Fibromyalgia
[1:47:27.180 --> 1:47:30.780]  and Fatigue Center in Dallas yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight
[1:47:30.780 --> 1:47:36.940]  gain of 32 and a half pounds what doctor by the way folks look I'm not bragging
[1:47:36.940 --> 1:47:40.420]  we game change the presidency we game change the new world order
[1:47:40.420 --> 1:47:44.740]  globalism is falling because of you you are the info war we listen this is
[1:47:44.740 --> 1:47:49.380]  religious for me okay I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe
[1:47:49.380 --> 1:47:53.980]  it and if we were reigned with a billion dollars I would turn 99% of it against
[1:47:53.980 --> 1:47:57.940]  the enemy I want to defeat them I'm ready to give my life everybody knows
[1:47:57.940 --> 1:48:02.620]  that against the enemy please we only have a limited supply of this I want to
[1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:06.660]  get your reviews on here what you have to say for me it's been incredible don't
[1:48:06.660 --> 1:48:12.660]  take it on an empty stomach though my cozy x antifungal antifungus anti yeast
[1:48:12.660 --> 1:48:16.700]  get it today limited run will be months so we get more in four store.com
[1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:21.140]  and fourslife.com or triple a two five three three one three nine I cannot
[1:48:21.140 --> 1:48:26.020]  sell something unless it helps somebody I mean just because metaphysically I
[1:48:26.020 --> 1:48:30.380]  mean I mean I just as who I am I'm not even that good of a person I just
[1:48:30.380 --> 1:48:33.060]  metaphysically don't want to hurt people I want to treat you like I want to be
[1:48:33.060 --> 1:48:37.180]  treated Texas hospitality and and I can't believe no one has put out something
[1:48:37.180 --> 1:48:41.100]  this good this just like other folks took probiotics I said take robotics they
[1:48:41.100 --> 1:48:44.460]  didn't have the effect they took the biome defense you developed over a decade
[1:48:44.460 --> 1:48:48.260]  the very best strains healed them I mean you know horrible irritable bowel
[1:48:48.260 --> 1:48:52.500]  horrible problems gone in one month I'm telling you and from my research
[1:48:52.500 --> 1:48:56.620]  correct me if I'm wrong we haven't had this talk is my cozy x is next level
[1:48:56.620 --> 1:49:01.620]  isn't good bacteria will displace the fungus and the yeast but isn't actually
[1:49:01.620 --> 1:49:05.460]  annihilating them the key or are you said there's a healthy balance here's
[1:49:05.460 --> 1:49:09.980]  what happens next level so first of all if anybody drinks alcohol out there and
[1:49:09.980 --> 1:49:15.220]  if anybody drink each sugar then I just you're more likely going to have an
[1:49:15.220 --> 1:49:19.300]  excess of fungus in your body and actually yeast is a fungus and mold is a
[1:49:19.300 --> 1:49:22.660]  fungus most people don't know that they think it's separate so it's all goes
[1:49:22.660 --> 1:49:27.100]  into the hidden attack and the hidden agenda how is it suddenly growing in
[1:49:27.100 --> 1:49:32.060]  brains everywhere well there's a lot of it there's actually studies coming out
[1:49:32.060 --> 1:49:41.060]  right now that show that funguses can produce 600 times more neurotoxins you're
[1:49:41.060 --> 1:49:46.860]  talking about the brain wow generated from a high emf environment okay so the
[1:49:46.860 --> 1:49:51.820]  electromagnetic they're feeding off this electromagnetic maybe they're a
[1:49:51.820 --> 1:49:55.660]  high mind or something I don't know why does the attack seem so alien because I
[1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:58.980]  never seen aliens I don't I don't get everything the globalists do is like
[1:49:58.980 --> 1:50:02.860]  anti-human kill us annihilate us so why are they out to get us this is just
[1:50:02.860 --> 1:50:07.940]  psychopathic inbreeding what is it it's it's really more or less a slow death is
[1:50:07.940 --> 1:50:10.700]  when you when you know why are the elite trying to kill us I'm saying who are
[1:50:10.700 --> 1:50:13.780]  there well because they wanted first of all it's a money thing they want to
[1:50:13.780 --> 1:50:17.900]  control they want to control us they if you really want to get in deep with so
[1:50:17.900 --> 1:50:22.940]  the ultimate power is just hurt us the ultimate fat power is slow death increase
[1:50:22.940 --> 1:50:26.940]  money for the pharmaceuticals being able to it gets deeper than that Alex when
[1:50:26.940 --> 1:50:31.500]  you look at more gallons which which most which is a fungal disease people are
[1:50:31.500 --> 1:50:37.980]  having fibers growing out of their body which is being traced back to some of
[1:50:37.980 --> 1:50:41.860]  the compounds found in the chemtrails right now which are prions and they're
[1:50:41.860 --> 1:50:45.140]  they're actually they're showing that you can control these things true
[1:50:45.140 --> 1:50:49.540]  electromagnetic signals just like what you're talking about that's what they
[1:50:49.540 --> 1:50:53.420]  say it's a binary weapon they put it into us then they they're doing testing in
[1:50:53.420 --> 1:50:57.380]  labs then they're testing on us seeing how it resonates and controls it they
[1:50:57.380 --> 1:51:01.220]  can put out a wavelength and activate it the fungus grows we all die we get
[1:51:01.220 --> 1:51:05.660]  brain tumors John Kunkel I'm 63 years of age I watched several YouTube videos of

[1:54:17.420 --> 1:54:19.940]  Monday and now it's all over the news are like yeah here's the New York Times I
[1:54:19.940 --> 1:54:23.260]  watched Fox News this morning yeah they said they were surveilling the
[1:54:23.260 --> 1:54:27.500]  president you know I'm looking for it in my stack we've got an article here where
[1:54:27.500 --> 1:54:31.140]  Zuckerberg is in the New York Times telling China don't worry I'm going to
[1:54:31.140 --> 1:54:35.820]  censor the internet I've already tested the US and then a USA Day article there
[1:54:35.820 --> 1:54:41.140]  it is Facebook made China censorship tool there you go and they're now using
[1:54:41.140 --> 1:54:46.660]  that in the US Zuckerberg using Chinese style censorship tool in America and
[1:54:46.660 --> 1:54:53.060]  what are they blocking Senator Rand Paul on the show it's a senator I want to
[1:54:53.060 --> 1:54:56.140]  have some hearings about that that's what they blocked yesterday and took off
[1:54:56.140 --> 1:55:02.700]  our Facebook and now former CIA analyst Obama gave green light for NSA CIA to
[1:55:02.700 --> 1:55:09.660]  sabotage that's from Larry C. Johnson CIA analyst section chief let's go ahead
[1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:14.220]  it's from his sources let's go to what Zuckerberg doesn't want you to see this
[1:55:14.220 --> 1:55:22.020]  here it is both Jim Clapper John Brennan at CIA were intimately involved in
[1:55:22.020 --> 1:55:28.340]  trying to derail the candidacy of Donald Trump that there was some collusion
[1:55:28.340 --> 1:55:34.700]  overseas with Europe with Britain's own GHCQ that information that was gathered
[1:55:34.700 --> 1:55:41.420]  from GHCQ was actually passed to John Brennan and it was disseminated within
[1:55:41.420 --> 1:55:45.980]  the US government this dissemination was illegal Donald Trump is in essence
[1:55:45.980 --> 1:55:52.300]  correct that the intelligence agencies and some in the law enforcement
[1:55:52.300 --> 1:55:58.100]  community on the side of the FBI were in fact illegally trying to access
[1:55:58.100 --> 1:56:03.740]  monitor his communications with his aides and with other people that's right
[1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:08.340]  all of this with an end to trying to destroy in this credit his presidency I
[1:56:08.340 --> 1:56:12.860]  don't think there will be any doubt of that I think it's worth noting that the
[1:56:12.860 --> 1:56:18.780]  head of the National Security Agency and Admiral Rogers made a journey to Trump
[1:56:18.780 --> 1:56:24.540]  Tower sort shortly after Trump had won and in the immediate aftermath of his
[1:56:24.540 --> 1:56:30.060]  visit the CIA and Jim Clapper and others in the intelligence community called
[1:56:30.060 --> 1:56:36.940]  for his him to be fired now why did Rogers go to Trump Tower my understanding
[1:56:36.940 --> 1:56:42.780]  is let's call it it was to cover himself because he was aware that the NSA had
[1:56:42.780 --> 1:56:48.220]  been the authorities had been misused and abused with respect to Donald Trump so
[1:56:48.220 --> 1:56:52.820]  I think Trump's decision to go out this morning and tweak this was fully
[1:56:52.820 --> 1:56:57.820]  intended to send a notice and send word that I don't think he's doing this
[1:56:57.820 --> 1:57:03.380]  without evidence he does have evidence I think it was just an artfully expressed
[1:57:03.380 --> 1:57:08.220]  in the tweet all right so and you've got the head of the intelligence committee
[1:57:08.220 --> 1:57:11.820]  in the house saying the same thing no Russian evidence and they were spying on
[1:57:11.820 --> 1:57:15.860]  him they've got a big problem but they're so arrogant Dr. Gruper want to
[1:57:15.860 --> 1:57:19.900]  break her in a moment that they're doing all this meanwhile this is how the New
[1:57:19.900 --> 1:57:24.980]  York Post FBI Chief Comey asserting power like no one in history he's acting
[1:57:24.980 --> 1:57:29.140]  like he's the president say it's outrageous we don't wiretap anybody well
[1:57:29.140 --> 1:57:34.060]  we know the FBI didn't do it he didn't accuse the FBI so Comey is a piece of
[1:57:34.060 --> 1:57:37.380]  work I mean just because he's like nine feet tall doesn't mean he's allowed to
[1:57:37.380 --> 1:57:41.060]  act like this man God just let us have prosperity man what the hell's your
[1:57:41.060 --> 1:57:46.100]  problem Dr. Group yeah just stop the the attacks and everything I mean let's just

[1:58:36.020 --> 1:58:49.460]  when we come back you just saw what they don't want you to see
[1:58:49.460 --> 1:58:55.460]  there was a mighty nation rest above all of creation Charlie Daniels he's
[1:58:55.460 --> 1:58:59.580]  always loved America let me just read a little failure the American system of
[1:58:59.580 --> 1:59:03.660]  justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world individual rights
[1:59:03.660 --> 1:59:07.140]  we'll have to take the backseat to the collective well you know the next

[1:59:31.860 --> 1:59:37.100]  revelation dawn of global government theatrical screenings on demand DVDs
[1:59:37.100 --> 1:59:41.940]  now available starring Alex Jones Charlie Daniels special ops general Jerry
[1:59:41.940 --> 1:59:47.540]  Boykin want to shed some tears over the red white and blue revelations the movie
[1:59:47.540 --> 2:00:08.500]  that info let's fix it you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:00:08.500 --> 2:00:14.500]  even the heart of Texas Austin broadcasting worldwide mainstream media
[2:00:14.500 --> 2:00:21.180]  government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the
[2:00:21.180 --> 2:00:28.340]  info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones hi group I went over the phones up at the
[2:00:28.340 --> 2:00:31.500]  bottom of the hour for questions comments about having the world but I want
[2:00:31.500 --> 2:00:35.260]  to get into Easton mold the next segment you were ranting in a good way
[2:00:35.260 --> 2:00:41.020]  during the break about what Trump needs to do I mean he's doing so much I'd love
[2:00:41.020 --> 2:00:44.820]  to attack Trump I don't care if some leader is but he really is the global
[2:00:44.820 --> 2:00:51.220]  thrall against him what should he do right now well I think he's doing a lot
[2:00:51.220 --> 2:00:55.460]  considering the fact that he's got so much opposition coming at him from every
[2:00:55.460 --> 2:01:01.620]  single direction but I mean I think it's gonna be a slow process if it were me I
[2:01:01.620 --> 2:01:06.380]  would start looking at what is the root cause I know that you know Trump right
[2:01:06.380 --> 2:01:09.460]  now doesn't want to ruffle anymore feathers but I mean if you look at the
[2:01:09.460 --> 2:01:13.220]  why we're dealing with so many problems with the earth while we're dealing with
[2:01:13.220 --> 2:01:18.700]  so many problems with the people's health care you know executive order to ban
[2:01:18.700 --> 2:01:23.140]  GMOs or to put together an advisory team of independent scientists to evaluate
[2:01:23.140 --> 2:01:26.300]  the negative effects of genetically modified foods they just they're coming
[2:01:26.300 --> 2:01:30.100]  out with a whole new potato and they just keep approving these abolish I mean
[2:01:30.100 --> 2:01:35.380]  the EPA is a disaster the USDA is a corporate takeover of life the Fed the
[2:01:35.380 --> 2:01:40.620]  FDA is a disaster I mean you put an executive order together to where you
[2:01:40.620 --> 2:01:44.820]  can't have a head or someone who worked in the executive level of a major
[2:01:44.820 --> 2:01:51.420]  company like Monsanto or pharmaceutical company running the FDA or running the
[2:01:51.420 --> 2:01:55.220]  EPA or running any government organizations I mean we've got to get
[2:01:55.220 --> 2:02:00.100]  we've got to break all of this up we've got a we we can't have all these
[2:02:00.100 --> 2:02:03.620]  lobbyists and we can't have all these individuals that are tied to all these
[2:02:03.620 --> 2:02:07.940]  big corporations that are destroying the planet that are manipulating all of
[2:02:07.940 --> 2:02:12.460]  these studies that are saying that vaccines are healthy for you you know
[2:02:12.460 --> 2:02:17.140]  that ignore all the real problems with the environment and make it about carbon
[2:02:17.140 --> 2:02:23.140]  taxes yeah and look you can go and pull up all this documentation on you listen
[2:02:23.140 --> 2:02:26.540]  I believe that we should have a choice right I believe in free speech I believe
[2:02:26.540 --> 2:02:30.340]  we should be able to make a choice to who our doctor is make a choice about
[2:02:30.340 --> 2:02:33.740]  what we're going to put in our bodies that's another reason why I'm not happy
[2:02:33.740 --> 2:02:37.860]  with the health care plan because if you're a licensed practitioner there are
[2:02:37.860 --> 2:02:42.500]  so many people right now that are begging for natural medicine they want to see
[2:02:42.500 --> 2:02:45.860]  all these studies on how natural medicine can help improve their life how
[2:02:45.860 --> 2:02:49.340]  cleansing and detoxification they want to know about the root cause of disease
[2:02:49.340 --> 2:02:53.340]  they want to know that we all have a self-healing mechanism in our body and
[2:02:53.340 --> 2:02:56.580]  our self-healing mechanism is being suppressed and our immune system is
[2:02:56.580 --> 2:03:00.420]  being suppressed because of all of the chemicals and the toxins and the hormones
[2:03:00.420 --> 2:03:04.380]  and the endocrine disrupting chemicals Trump needs to sign an executive order if
[2:03:04.380 --> 2:03:08.860]  you can't pronounce the chemical then it shouldn't be used in something you're
[2:03:08.860 --> 2:03:13.380]  going to ingest or put on your skin just look at all these cosmetic products
[2:03:13.380 --> 2:03:17.540]  out there look at all the shampoos the conditioners look at the air fresheners
[2:03:17.540 --> 2:03:23.380]  that are allowed why is an air freshener allowed to be put in somebody's home
[2:03:23.380 --> 2:03:30.020]  when it's producing high levels of toxic fragrances that are phthalates that
[2:03:30.020 --> 2:03:35.860]  cause problems with sterility we we have lists it's not like I'm just sitting
[2:03:35.860 --> 2:03:39.260]  up here talking about all this stuff sign an executive order to take fluoride
[2:03:39.260 --> 2:03:42.300]  globalists admit they're at war with humanity they've turned everything into
[2:03:42.300 --> 2:03:47.500]  a weaponized system it's all that's why they're so scared because it's taking
[2:03:47.500 --> 2:03:52.580]  them hundred a hundred years to set up a scientific dictatorship in all of the
[2:03:52.580 --> 2:03:56.540]  world humanity seems to be figuring it out their humanity does humanity finally
[2:03:56.540 --> 2:04:00.300]  figures it out and we overthrow it that's right and that in the good thing
[2:04:00.300 --> 2:04:03.740]  look I don't want to be doom and gloom the good news is we are figuring it out
[2:04:03.740 --> 2:04:09.980]  and finally for once we we believe and we have faith that we have a president
[2:04:09.980 --> 2:04:14.500]  that's gonna actually do something about it that understands what the people want
[2:04:14.500 --> 2:04:19.660]  that the people want to be able to choose if I want natural medicine I want
[2:04:19.660 --> 2:04:24.860]  to go to a naturopathic doctor who has proven success and I'm reading thousands
[2:04:24.860 --> 2:04:28.700]  of reviews online that this natural doctor specializes in Lyme disease and
[2:04:28.700 --> 2:04:34.260]  he's got a special protocol that he uses that gets 80% success rates I want to go
[2:04:34.260 --> 2:04:37.540]  to that doctor he might be in Arizona or something but I want my insurance
[2:04:37.540 --> 2:04:41.820]  company to cover that we need to open this up and let people choose where they
[2:04:41.820 --> 2:04:46.340]  want to go in a value and also all the incredible things that mother earth

[2:05:24.380 --> 2:05:29.020]  wiretapping phone calls at New York's Trump Tower mainstream media outlets
[2:05:29.020 --> 2:05:33.980]  began to list possible surveillance targets including Trump's so-called

[2:05:39.380 --> 2:05:44.860]  Hillary Clinton posted on Twitter that it's time for Trump to answer serious

[2:08:34.300 --> 2:08:39.460]  resistance you're listening to Alex Jones
[2:08:41.780 --> 2:08:45.860]  and that was something completely different
[2:08:45.860 --> 2:09:07.220]  when there's no more room in hell the dead will walk here
[2:09:15.860 --> 2:09:30.580]  we've got to survive somebody's got to survive wait give her a chance when she
[2:09:30.580 --> 2:09:34.660]  calms down she might have an actual argument
[2:09:36.380 --> 2:09:45.180]  nope just more autistic screeching I know what this is just one individual this
[2:09:45.180 --> 2:09:49.860]  isn't an accurate portrayal of the reasoned credible legitimate anti-trump
[2:09:49.860 --> 2:10:16.660]  protest movement
[2:10:19.860 --> 2:10:31.020]  yeah
[2:10:36.180 --> 2:10:42.820]  there's no more room in hell the dead will walk here joking aside this is the
[2:10:42.820 --> 2:10:46.700]  effect that the mainstream media is having on people this is what happens
[2:10:46.700 --> 2:10:50.780]  when you tell people over and over again that Trump is going to bring about the
[2:10:50.780 --> 2:10:55.500]  apocalypse this is what mass hysteria looks like this is what happens when
[2:10:55.500 --> 2:11:00.420]  collective insanity is legit full video is up on info wars calm there's a new
[2:11:00.420 --> 2:11:03.500]  poll watch an article out right now I want to go over at the bottom of the
[2:11:03.500 --> 2:11:06.420]  hour on open the phones up about where you think Trump is we think about the
[2:11:06.420 --> 2:11:11.620]  health care bill the first thing I can genuinely say is that he's tacitly
[2:11:11.620 --> 2:11:15.220]  supporting it because he wants to debate this is what the Republicans came up
[2:11:15.220 --> 2:11:18.900]  with are the ones that helped write the bill it's still got a mandate it still
[2:11:18.900 --> 2:11:23.620]  charges your money but to the insurance company if you don't get insurance
[2:11:23.620 --> 2:11:27.340]  senator Paul was on yesterday and I agree with him it's got some major
[2:11:27.340 --> 2:11:32.700]  problems Trump said he talked to Rand Paul and he wants to change too so okay
[2:11:32.700 --> 2:11:37.060]  great but Trump saying give the people the repeal they want well it was a
[2:11:37.060 --> 2:11:42.980]  repeal and something like 80% is bad we don't want that but again overall
[2:11:42.980 --> 2:11:45.460]  Trump's trying to just work with Congress we'll see what happens with that
[2:11:45.460 --> 2:11:50.700]  here's the new article in poor's warned of government using microphones to
[2:11:50.700 --> 2:11:55.900]  spy on Americans 11 years ago they would have called this fake news all the
[2:11:55.900 --> 2:12:02.900]  time mm-hmm then we show screenshots again of September 6 2006 we just don't

[2:12:06.740 --> 2:12:10.820]  okay I'll take 11 years government industry to use computer microphones to
[2:12:10.820 --> 2:12:16.420]  spy on 150 million Americans online that was the folks that were online then so
[2:12:16.420 --> 2:12:21.940]  the article goes over all the different vaults seven developments that have
[2:12:21.940 --> 2:12:27.300]  taken place shows you screenshots of our articles over the years but again I'd
[2:12:27.300 --> 2:12:31.860]  love to say we just magically thought all this up on ourselves it just came

[2:13:46.660 --> 2:13:50.980]  been taking it privately your clinics let's talk about micro zx right now and
[2:13:50.980 --> 2:13:54.540]  why it's available at info or store.com and for his life.com and why it's so
[2:13:54.540 --> 2:13:58.700]  important well years ago when I had my clinic before I was shut down one of
[2:13:58.700 --> 2:14:03.580]  the things that people would always come to me and say I've been to five or six
[2:14:03.580 --> 2:14:07.340]  different doctors and no one can figure out what's wrong with me and every after
[2:14:07.340 --> 2:14:11.180]  a while I figured out okay if no doctors can figure out what wrong what's
[2:14:11.180 --> 2:14:14.420]  wrong with you you're you're suffering from some sort of toxicity in the body
[2:14:14.420 --> 2:14:19.580]  it's either going to be some sort of chemicals metals fungus your bow
[2:14:19.580 --> 2:14:24.980]  parasites a lot of times people are suffering from fungus or yeast or mold
[2:14:24.980 --> 2:14:30.500]  overgrowth and parasites and when have that has a doctor ever told them that
[2:14:30.500 --> 2:14:35.900]  like I've rarely rarely unless it's the patient that just asked the doctor to do
[2:14:35.900 --> 2:14:39.340]  a bunch of blood and saliva and urine tests and everything most likely you'll
[2:14:39.340 --> 2:14:42.980]  never know and it's designed that way it's getting worse and worse because of
[2:14:42.980 --> 2:14:46.980]  all the carbohydrate based diets the fast food the microwave food the EMFs
[2:14:46.980 --> 2:14:54.500]  all that stuff is creating a thicker stronger fungus people are just men and
[2:14:54.500 --> 2:14:59.700]  women I mean women are having vaginal infections candida is one of the main
[2:14:59.700 --> 2:15:04.180]  things that we're dealing with systemic candida infection owns disease mainline
[2:15:04.180 --> 2:15:09.540]  studies Crohn's disease coming out now and just as just came out not too long
[2:15:09.540 --> 2:15:14.420]  ago the Mayo Clinic study implicates fungus as a cause of chronic sinus
[2:15:14.420 --> 2:15:19.020]  sinusitis an estimated 37 million people in the United States suffer from
[2:15:19.020 --> 2:15:23.300]  chronic sinusitis and inflection and inflammation of the membranes of the
[2:15:23.300 --> 2:15:27.140]  nose and the sinus cavity and for years and years I know when molds high I feel
[2:15:27.140 --> 2:15:31.100]  like I've been running by car but I take this new product that knocks it right
[2:15:31.100 --> 2:15:35.420]  out this has been in the works like you said for this formula has been in the
[2:15:35.420 --> 2:15:38.860]  works for over 10 years I've been adjusting it is so fresh I mean when
[2:15:38.860 --> 2:15:43.820]  can you go to any store and open up a bottle of anything and you can literally
[2:15:43.820 --> 2:15:49.220]  smell the power of the herbs take a whiff of that I mean it's a very powerful
[2:15:49.220 --> 2:15:53.820]  just alone knocks me back and like I was saying if you tell folks what Sam so
[2:15:53.820 --> 2:15:57.780]  what you have in this is you have a combination of wildcrafted Jatoba bark
[2:15:57.780 --> 2:16:02.060]  which actually comes from the rainforest so we have ethical harvesting that goes
[2:16:02.060 --> 2:16:05.780]  on and we work with companies down in Brazil and Peru and where the rainforest
[2:16:05.780 --> 2:16:10.180]  are and they go out and they actually harvest this by hand and then we process
[2:16:10.180 --> 2:16:14.220]  it without exposing it to any microwave radiation which by the way the
[2:16:14.220 --> 2:16:20.660]  majority of products that come from overseas do get radiated and so we try
[2:16:20.660 --> 2:16:24.420]  to get that in the it's most natural fresh form that we possibly can it's
[2:16:24.420 --> 2:16:30.260]  got potty arco in there and these herbs contain different compounds that have
[2:16:30.260 --> 2:16:37.100]  been proven to attack different types of fungus mold and yeast organisms we use
[2:16:37.100 --> 2:16:41.620]  licorice root which is a lot of times these organisms will put this mucus
[2:16:41.620 --> 2:16:46.100]  biofilm layer around themselves and that needs to be broken down and licorice
[2:16:46.100 --> 2:16:51.100]  root kind of that helps break that mucus membrane down and we also started
[2:16:51.100 --> 2:16:55.420]  experimenting with enzymes to do that as well and it contains hemicellulase
[2:16:55.420 --> 2:17:01.060]  because the especially Candida has a surrounding made of a cellulose matrix
[2:17:01.060 --> 2:17:05.540]  so that hemicellulase is an enzyme that breaks through and eats that as well as
[2:17:05.540 --> 2:17:09.900]  the beta gluconase and then we have golden thread and then a niece as well so
[2:17:09.900 --> 2:17:17.020]  very powerful formula it's amazing most people don't even know see that's the way
[2:17:17.020 --> 2:17:21.500]  a lot of this stuff is designed it's designed to incapacitate you over time
[2:17:21.500 --> 2:17:25.980]  off kill it's a soft kill so you don't even realize what's happening to by the
[2:17:25.980 --> 2:17:30.020]  way I've never smelled licorice that's wrong of the smells you get it so fresh
[2:17:30.020 --> 2:17:35.700]  you you know you cold press it you don't process it it's strong listen to this
[2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:39.180]  lady that was testing this formula she writes in I had trouble breathing
[2:17:39.180 --> 2:17:44.300]  itching in my eyes my ears back of my throat and nasal passages had mucus that
[2:17:44.300 --> 2:17:48.980]  I could not get rid of dizziness and the list goes on been to four different
[2:17:48.980 --> 2:17:53.340]  doctors for five years trying to rid myself of the issues I was having spent
[2:17:53.340 --> 2:17:57.660]  thousands of dollars getting nowhere they told me things like there was
[2:17:57.660 --> 2:18:02.980]  nothing wrong with me oh you have allergies must be the dust at your work
[2:18:02.980 --> 2:18:09.780]  or your home have been on half a dozen different meds and nothing worked found
[2:18:09.780 --> 2:18:13.500]  this formula and have been on it for two months now and it's made such an
[2:18:13.500 --> 2:18:18.100]  improvement in my health I am now active in sports again I feel better stronger
[2:18:18.100 --> 2:18:22.700]  livelier thanks a million and Alex I have stacks of the other shit let me ask
[2:18:22.700 --> 2:18:27.300]  you this why why is the fungus they admit this everywhere again I know like
[2:18:27.300 --> 2:18:30.620]  three or four people that have family or themselves have brain tumors suddenly
[2:18:30.620 --> 2:18:36.100]  kids from fungus yeah what the hell's going on with the fungus well there's a
[2:18:36.100 --> 2:18:40.780]  lot of different types of fungus right now that why is it so bad why is it
[2:18:40.780 --> 2:18:46.060]  getting worse I think that the read from everything that I've found number one is
[2:18:46.060 --> 2:18:50.220]  what happens is as soon as somebody starts feeling bad they go to the doctor's
[2:18:50.220 --> 2:18:55.020]  office and the first thing the doctors did fungus has the same signs and
[2:18:55.020 --> 2:18:58.660]  symptoms almost as they don't know what to do with it they think it's flu like
[2:18:58.660 --> 2:19:03.620]  symptoms so they immediately put people on antibiotics looking at all of the
[2:19:03.620 --> 2:19:07.460]  looking at all of the things that I've studied about the fungus and trying to
[2:19:07.460 --> 2:19:12.700]  figure out why it is causing the brain malfunctions and not only brain cancer
[2:19:12.700 --> 2:19:16.940]  but it's linked to anxiety it's linked to depression it's linked to psychosis it's
[2:19:16.940 --> 2:19:22.820]  linked to suicidal thoughts all of that I think a lot of it stems from when they
[2:19:22.820 --> 2:19:26.300]  go to the doctor's office the first thing that the doctors do is they use
[2:19:26.300 --> 2:19:29.940]  antifungal they don't even use antifungal medicine medications Alex they
[2:19:29.940 --> 2:19:34.300]  use it strong antibiotics what does any buy out what do antibiotics do they
[2:19:34.300 --> 2:19:39.260]  completely wipe out the gut lining it kills the bacteria that fill in the
[2:19:39.260 --> 2:19:44.100]  space so now now the fungus grows more so now you have an overgrowth of fungus
[2:19:44.100 --> 2:19:50.940]  and bacteria in the gut and and listen to this fungus especially Candida
[2:19:50.940 --> 2:19:54.380]  produce we always hear about about bacteria in the news and how there
[2:19:54.380 --> 2:19:58.620]  resistant now we never hear about fungus it's just as prevalent we actually I
[2:19:58.620 --> 2:20:04.100]  would say more people are in a greater health risk due to fungus mold and yeast
[2:20:04.100 --> 2:20:09.420]  than they are bacteria fungus just is really hard to kill it lives it
[2:20:09.420 --> 2:20:12.900]  replicates and because of the poor diet and everything that people are eating in
[2:20:12.900 --> 2:20:16.940]  the high sugar and bad carbohydrates that people are consuming why does
[2:20:16.940 --> 2:20:21.540]  fun just live off that because it feeds off of sugars actually it feeds off of
[2:20:21.540 --> 2:20:28.860]  sugars plants sure yeah so how does this kill it and people do say they you
[2:20:28.860 --> 2:20:31.620]  get pretty dramatic if you're really infested so tell people about it well
[2:20:31.620 --> 2:20:37.420]  it creates an environment that they do not like and it has the different
[2:20:37.420 --> 2:20:41.540]  compounds in the herbs like the berberine and some of the herbs and the
[2:20:41.540 --> 2:20:48.780]  hemicellulase those are designed to break down the walls first of the molds
[2:20:48.780 --> 2:20:51.860]  the fungus create a slime to protect themselves they do they keep they create
[2:20:51.860 --> 2:20:55.740]  a biofilm and then you have to eat away at that and then once you eat away with
[2:20:55.740 --> 2:21:02.420]  that the components the main components inside the herbs are designed to
[2:21:02.420 --> 2:21:08.140]  actually disable and cause dysfunction and stop replication of the fungal and
[2:21:08.140 --> 2:21:13.820]  of the fungal or yeast or mold or so we've got folks who take bomb defense and
[2:21:13.820 --> 2:21:17.340]  suddenly their irritable bowels gone in just a month I'm trying to get them on
[2:21:17.340 --> 2:21:20.100]  here but it is embarrassing to talk with these things and other probiotics
[2:21:20.100 --> 2:21:24.540]  didn't work for them well how does this work together with a bomb defense well
[2:21:24.540 --> 2:21:27.780]  the gut is always the first thing that you want to repair it's the it's the
[2:21:27.780 --> 2:21:33.260]  first exposure point like Hippocrates actually said 2,500 years ago that the
[2:21:33.260 --> 2:21:38.700]  gut is the key to all health and also the key to all disease and we've been
[2:21:38.700 --> 2:21:41.820]  saying that for a long time it's the first exposure point to the outside
[2:21:41.820 --> 2:21:46.140]  environment so when you put in all this stuff the first thing that you need to
[2:21:46.140 --> 2:21:49.300]  be healthy the gut is the largest endocrine although we get the term
[2:21:49.300 --> 2:21:52.860]  Hippocratic oath from Hippocrates that's right for what 10 years now they no
[2:21:52.860 --> 2:21:57.340]  longer give it at medical schools that's right do no harm when you look into any
[2:21:57.340 --> 2:22:02.060]  of this stuff whether it's bowel conditions gastro even gastroenterologists
[2:22:02.060 --> 2:22:05.820]  don't know this stuff when you look into fungus when you look into the effects
[2:22:05.820 --> 2:22:08.900]  of fluoride when you look into the effects of pesticides I go back I get
[2:22:08.900 --> 2:22:13.220]  wise growing in us worse but they I mean I know a police officer in Cleveland I'm
[2:22:13.220 --> 2:22:16.060]  gonna leave it at that who is like the hero of the department you name and he
[2:22:16.060 --> 2:22:20.100]  went in a vacant house that had mold he and his partner almost got killed by the
[2:22:20.100 --> 2:22:24.180]  mold he had a brain tumor from it then I looked it up it's all over the place
[2:22:24.180 --> 2:22:27.540]  people getting brain tumors what the hell why is it suddenly growing in the
[2:22:27.540 --> 2:22:32.780]  brain that that is that are right there that's going to lead you to what black
[2:22:32.780 --> 2:22:39.140]  mold actually creates and black mold has been used as a bio weapon dating back
[2:22:39.140 --> 2:22:45.460]  a long period of time the black mold actually creates let me see if I can
[2:22:45.460 --> 2:22:50.020]  find it right here the military different types of biological testing and
[2:22:50.020 --> 2:22:53.700]  everything that have been done document camphor but it's always right here by
[2:22:53.700 --> 2:22:58.540]  toxic black mold and biological weapons now black mold has been found even in
[2:22:58.540 --> 2:23:03.460]  dishwashers now and in laundry machines in homes and I have an article on that as
[2:23:03.460 --> 2:23:08.580]  well but black mold biological weapons have been made from T2 it's called
[2:23:08.580 --> 2:23:15.420]  tricotoxine mycotoxins I don't even know how to pronounce that but those are the
[2:23:15.420 --> 2:23:19.180]  mycotoxins produced by toxic black mold which can be found in even growing in
[2:23:19.180 --> 2:23:24.100]  your homes and several countries have grown toxic mold to harvest the T2
[2:23:24.100 --> 2:23:28.980]  mycotoxins even during the Vietnam War these mycotoxins were released over
[2:23:28.980 --> 2:23:34.620]  remote jungle areas in Laos this caused over 6,300 deaths between 1975 and
[2:23:34.620 --> 2:23:38.900]  1981 but let's not just blame the elites is that our modern unhealthy homes the
[2:23:38.900 --> 2:23:45.900]  stuff grows in yes yes it's a it's it's the combination of what mold really
[2:23:45.900 --> 2:23:51.460]  needs the black mold what that needs to survive as a damp toxic environment and
[2:23:51.460 --> 2:23:55.660]  especially down south where the humidity is above 35% you're going to
[2:23:55.660 --> 2:23:59.060]  get more black mold the south obviously like allergies in Austin usually when you
[2:23:59.060 --> 2:24:03.380]  look at the black mold causing brain dysfunction or you cause a respiratory a
[2:24:03.380 --> 2:24:07.180]  lot of respiratory issues or brain tumors or anything like that most of the
[2:24:07.180 --> 2:24:11.500]  time those are going to be down south in the southern well let's talk about then
[2:24:11.500 --> 2:24:16.300]  what mycozx what I call it mycozx it's called normal fungal and use balance
[2:24:16.300 --> 2:24:20.500]  in force life calm and it supports the broadcast but how would people take this
[2:24:20.500 --> 2:24:24.260]  what to do basically there's a there's just a fungus among us I mean and it's
[2:24:24.260 --> 2:24:28.500]  just coming out with we need to do something to protect ourselves it's
[2:24:28.500 --> 2:24:32.820]  really hard to avoid just like when you're a kid cats have ringworm it's a
[2:24:32.820 --> 2:24:36.460]  fungus and it can eat buddy holes in your skin I mean this stuff gets in our
[2:24:36.460 --> 2:24:41.420]  body there's no way really to avoid it right now because they're even showing
[2:24:41.420 --> 2:24:45.180]  that someone can be exposed to fungus and it spreads very easily I mean you
[2:24:45.180 --> 2:24:49.060]  touch you know especially in the crowded big cities right now you can you can
[2:24:49.060 --> 2:24:53.380]  spread it through respiratory you can spread it through touching people so so
[2:24:53.380 --> 2:24:58.460]  tell folks what mycozxroom4slive.com does so mycozx is something that you can
[2:24:58.460 --> 2:25:03.020]  use to cleanse it's you know all about cleansing the body you cleanse your body
[2:25:03.020 --> 2:25:08.060]  of harmful yeast and these are known herbs and compounds and enzymes I mean
[2:25:08.060 --> 2:25:12.340]  I've got I've been trying this formula and I've got stack of results research
[2:25:12.340 --> 2:25:15.700]  studies on people for 10 years and this is the first time it's good it's it's
[2:25:15.700 --> 2:25:19.540]  gonna be launched today it's a proven formula it's not like we're putting
[2:25:19.540 --> 2:25:23.380]  something together at the last minute I've been talking to you but like I said
[2:25:23.380 --> 2:25:27.460]  you don't want to eat on empty stomach it just depends you can take it with
[2:25:27.460 --> 2:25:31.780]  food I I personally I I like to just experiment with myself and I've taking
[2:25:31.780 --> 2:25:35.580]  it on taking it on empty stomach but yes you can take it with food some people
[2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:39.220]  can take it on empty well I mean it's pretty hardcore it is well what's hard
[2:25:39.220 --> 2:25:45.700]  hard core is the Candida the Candida fungus releases up to 80 known
[2:25:45.700 --> 2:25:51.060]  neurotoxins but they get really pissed when they get bombed with us yes so what
[2:25:51.060 --> 2:25:54.340]  happens is they start blowing up and all those neurotoxins and toxins end up
[2:25:54.340 --> 2:25:57.580]  coming out into your bloodstream so that's I mean when you take something
[2:25:57.580 --> 2:26:02.260]  that kills off a harmful organism that's in your body it's that dead organism
[2:26:02.260 --> 2:26:06.140]  that needs to be removed by your immune system and most likely your immune
[2:26:06.140 --> 2:26:10.020]  system is not working at 100% anyway so now your immune system has to go into
[2:26:10.020 --> 2:26:13.180]  overdrive to clean up think about what happens once you've been on in a while
[2:26:13.180 --> 2:26:17.500]  it's amazing just all oh my gosh your energy starts increasing your bowel
[2:26:17.500 --> 2:26:22.620]  activity starts to prepare itself your mental clarity starts coming back I look
[2:26:22.620 --> 2:26:26.940]  I eat healthy and avoid as much I don't even eat sugar I try to avoid it as much
[2:26:26.940 --> 2:26:32.980]  as I possibly can I don't hardly even drink alcohol that much to me I do a
[2:26:32.980 --> 2:26:38.740]  fungal in a mold and a yeast cleanse at least every three months I give it to my
[2:26:38.740 --> 2:26:41.420]  kids because they're at school and they're around all these other kids
[2:26:41.420 --> 2:26:46.700]  sure and this is jam packed with 120 powder capsules it's GMO three runs of
[2:26:46.700 --> 2:26:52.340]  this how often would you take my CoZX I would take that straight for a
[2:26:52.340 --> 2:26:58.460]  period of about three to six weeks to start my how many moles a day so we
[2:26:58.460 --> 2:27:02.940]  recommend two to three capsules twice a day two to three capsules twice a day if
[2:27:02.940 --> 2:27:07.700]  you've already if you're working when we always recommend we have to you know
[2:27:07.700 --> 2:27:11.980]  we're not allowed to make any claims we always recommend you check in with your
[2:27:11.980 --> 2:27:16.820]  health care practitioner just if you're on medications you know make sure that
[2:27:16.820 --> 2:27:20.420]  there's not going to be any contraindications with that but it all
[2:27:20.420 --> 2:27:25.700]  boils down to you taking responsibility for your own health and us giving your
[2:27:25.700 --> 2:27:31.580]  listeners your fans everybody out there the best possible thing to take care of
[2:27:31.580 --> 2:27:35.260]  the solution I know folks that have taken other probiotics and not had the
[2:27:35.260 --> 2:27:39.460]  effect they we we take biome defense that's discounted with those 10% today
[2:27:39.460 --> 2:27:43.740]  I mean that is an amazing probiotic you develop they're perfect for each other
[2:27:43.740 --> 2:27:50.020]  they work hand-in-hand because the biome defense has 23 strains of the best
[2:27:50.020 --> 2:27:56.620]  probiotics that are specifically cultured for info wars that they're not
[2:27:56.620 --> 2:28:00.060]  cultured on gelatin they're not made with animal products they don't have a
[2:28:00.060 --> 2:28:03.780]  bunch of toxicate excipients and fillers in there they actually said I was
[2:28:03.780 --> 2:28:08.460]  crazy when I came up with this formula they said you're gonna pay we have nobody
[2:28:08.460 --> 2:28:11.700]  there's only about everybody's real cheap was like a dollar in the bottle or
[2:28:11.700 --> 2:28:14.940]  put like 20 bucks the bottle there there's there's only three or four or five
[2:28:14.940 --> 2:28:20.580]  well this is medical grade super fancy clinics have stuff similar I don't even
[2:28:20.580 --> 2:28:24.060]  think they have anything similar to this I mean there's there's no doubt folks
[2:28:24.060 --> 2:28:28.140]  that's not high you understand we have to give you the best just I wanted this
[2:28:28.140 --> 2:28:31.900]  is what my kids take you understand exactly I mean there's this is the stuff
[2:28:31.900 --> 2:28:35.620]  that I developed first I say I was I don't get sponsors with pharmaceuticals
[2:28:35.620 --> 2:28:38.580]  the great people but I was looking for you know five years so I found somebody
[2:28:38.580 --> 2:28:42.620]  to partner with it everybody said you're the best I mean you are a little not
[2:28:42.620 --> 2:28:45.500]  neurotic about it but getting the right ingredients you sometimes that's why most
[2:28:45.500 --> 2:28:48.220]  our stuff sold out sometimes six months because you're waiting to get the very
[2:28:48.220 --> 2:28:51.580]  best I mean you won't just put something out that's why DNA force is on
[2:28:51.580 --> 2:28:55.540]  backorder right now because we're we're getting a fresh fresh batch coming in
[2:28:55.540 --> 2:29:00.220]  is one of the ingredients the rodeo life which is the Tibetan rodeo will
[2:29:00.220 --> 2:29:03.780]  concentrate that we use in the DNA force which I love that formula it's
[2:29:03.780 --> 2:29:10.300]  worth it though to not have everything you have to make sure that you it's up
[2:29:10.300 --> 2:29:14.820]  to your standards if you're going to give something to somebody else I want to
[2:29:14.820 --> 2:29:18.100]  make sure that I'm taking it that it's up to my standards that it's the best of
[2:29:18.100 --> 2:29:21.580]  the best and I'm constantly wanting to make everything better and we will be

[2:33:18.900 --> 2:33:25.100]  sold out for like a month of our non-gmo organic non-fluoride toothpaste that
[2:33:25.100 --> 2:33:31.340]  has tea tree oil and peppermint and of course a little silver and iodine in it
[2:33:31.340 --> 2:33:35.260]  people say well why are you sold out because sometimes we buy a bunch of a
[2:33:35.260 --> 2:33:37.900]  great product and it doesn't sell for six months we're sitting on it and then
[2:33:37.900 --> 2:33:40.740]  we don't have any money we've never kind of gotten over that hump to have a big
[2:33:40.740 --> 2:33:46.820]  surplus of money to be able to gauge all this so we did a limited run of my co
[2:33:46.820 --> 2:33:52.580]  zx supports normal fungal and yeast of balance proprietary blend of herbs and
[2:33:52.580 --> 2:33:56.340]  enzymes made with high-quality ingredients from for us life.com
[2:33:56.340 --> 2:34:01.260]  developed by Dr. Group so when I say at current sales rates because they just
[2:34:01.260 --> 2:34:05.460]  told us this is a hit this will be sold out in about three days Dr. Group
[2:34:05.460 --> 2:34:08.980]  people actually get this I guess people actually know how bad fungus and mold
[2:34:08.980 --> 2:34:12.060]  and all this says and then using mother nature to counter this out of control
[2:34:12.060 --> 2:34:15.900]  system that's killing so many farm animals bats you name it so many
[2:34:15.900 --> 2:34:21.020]  ground foraging mammals it's just taking over their their their I mean the bats
[2:34:21.020 --> 2:34:24.820]  get white nose it just basically eats their sinuses or lungs they die no
[2:34:24.820 --> 2:34:28.260]  wonder we're so sick too especially in the South and I love Texas but I've told
[2:34:28.260 --> 2:34:32.020]  people you know one for stuff like this I mean I couldn't stay here in Texas that
[2:34:32.020 --> 2:34:35.740]  the allergies the problems how long until we can produce more of this is
[2:34:35.740 --> 2:34:40.380]  about to sell out I'll get I'll get on it right away you know I'm hoping we can
[2:34:40.380 --> 2:34:44.140]  have some more in with within about six weeks I mean when so you know the things
[2:34:44.140 --> 2:34:47.500]  they've got to test it all the California standards it's all when you
[2:34:47.500 --> 2:34:51.660]  don't hear anybody talking about anything that's the stuff you have to
[2:34:51.660 --> 2:34:54.740]  worry about when you don't hear the mainstream media talking about how bad
[2:34:54.740 --> 2:34:58.160]  the fungus epidemic is and the mold epidemic and the yeast epidemic and the
[2:34:58.160 --> 2:35:02.300]  can't and all the different strains of Candida you know science daily just came
[2:35:02.300 --> 2:35:09.140]  out with a study well this was in 2015 how deadly fungus evades the immune
[2:35:09.140 --> 2:35:14.540]  system so a document came shot for a slight right there of the world and with
[2:35:14.540 --> 2:35:20.660]  that so they found that Candida albicans can kill immune cells even after its
[2:35:20.660 --> 2:35:24.780]  cells have died they let the immune cells called macrophages consume the
[2:35:24.780 --> 2:35:29.620]  fungus and after an hour they remove the fungal cells from the macrophages then
[2:35:29.620 --> 2:35:35.700]  they expose so our body tries to kill it but it kills our cells not them so no
[2:35:35.700 --> 2:35:41.420]  our macrophages actually eat the fungus kills them but what they're saying is it
[2:35:41.420 --> 2:35:45.420]  doesn't actually kill them do you know fungus is the fungus cells actually have
[2:35:45.420 --> 2:35:49.300]  a nucleus in them bacterial cells fungus I'm not a doctor like you but I've
[2:35:49.300 --> 2:35:54.860]  researched it fungus is basically what anthrax is anthrax is basically like a
[2:35:54.860 --> 2:35:59.300]  plant-based deal and when it begins to die it doesn't it folds in eats the other
[2:35:59.300 --> 2:36:03.580]  half and becomes a crystalline source they can live a million years see that's
[2:36:03.580 --> 2:36:07.180]  and so there's plants and fungus basically can't be killed well then how
[2:36:07.180 --> 2:36:11.620]  is how are herbs then we're flushing it binding to it what are they doing well
[2:36:11.620 --> 2:36:16.740]  the good ones are breaking it down and then the components see there's always a
[2:36:16.740 --> 2:36:19.860]  solution to every situation you just have to find it the hard part about
[2:36:19.860 --> 2:36:25.620]  formulating a good product is sure it's like ten times worse than
[2:36:25.620 --> 2:36:31.780]  and so each each plant has you know anywhere from 10 to 50 or 60 different
[2:36:31.780 --> 2:36:36.780]  chemical compounds in it and so you have to find sure but I'm saying like in
[2:36:36.780 --> 2:36:40.660]  beliefs you there's this plan I've heard which one's like ten times worse than
[2:36:40.660 --> 2:36:44.540]  poison ivy there's another plant though you rub it neutralizes it exactly yeah

[2:37:31.340 --> 2:37:35.940]  into China they're like advertising in major news that they're censoring here

[2:37:40.740 --> 2:37:45.860]  they're censoring us on just mainline news I think it's horrible I mean it's
[2:37:45.860 --> 2:37:51.540]  it just goes to show you the all-out war that's going on right now between the
[2:37:51.540 --> 2:37:55.060]  Democrats and all of these organizations that are forming and George Soros
[2:37:55.060 --> 2:38:02.860]  behind it and and the I mean to be to suppress information and to come out
[2:38:02.860 --> 2:38:09.380]  and literally lie about half of this stuff is it just amazes me that people
[2:38:09.380 --> 2:38:14.140]  it's after all of these things especially the CNN has been coming out with and
[2:38:14.140 --> 2:38:19.060]  all of these lies and all this you know they look at what we're doing as fake
[2:38:19.060 --> 2:38:23.500]  news I'm telling you anybody can do what we're doing and pull up the
[2:38:23.500 --> 2:38:26.500]  documentation in the proof the declassified government documents
[2:38:26.500 --> 2:38:30.060]  everything exactly I mean nine percent what we cover is documented take that
[2:38:30.060 --> 2:38:33.540]  headline they found is even strong enough I've got one here my stacks making
[2:38:33.540 --> 2:38:37.220]  mad I can't find it where Zuckerberg's like I'm proving to China I can censor
[2:38:37.220 --> 2:38:44.420]  I've done it in America I'll do it there too he's just such a scumbag man I just
[2:38:44.420 --> 2:38:49.380]  the karma I literally meditate for about an hour or two hours every single day
[2:38:49.380 --> 2:38:54.660]  and try to bring love and peace and joy to this world right now because the
[2:38:54.660 --> 2:38:59.580]  negativity that we're seeing from the I mean I feel for those people and just
[2:38:59.580 --> 2:39:04.940]  it's just an all-out fight and I'm just like how can you be how can you not know
[2:39:04.940 --> 2:39:09.260]  like how can you not do the research how can you not see the anti-Trump people
[2:39:09.260 --> 2:39:13.340]  beating everybody up acting like goblins acting like demons I'm not saying
[2:39:13.340 --> 2:39:16.940]  Trump's perfect but I mean why why are all these evil forces against him he's
[2:39:16.940 --> 2:39:21.140]  bringing prosperity back he's like exposing vaccines he's not what's your
[2:39:21.140 --> 2:39:25.980]  gut say about Trump my gut tell what my guts telling me about Trump right now
[2:39:25.980 --> 2:39:31.980]  is he's got so much stuff and so much negative energy coming at him right now
[2:39:31.980 --> 2:39:36.820]  and he's dealing with it and it's gonna take time and I think deep down he
[2:39:36.820 --> 2:39:40.980]  really knows about all this stuff I know he knows about all that I don't really
[2:39:40.980 --> 2:39:44.180]  believe in classical reincarnation what they say I wonder what Trump did in the
[2:39:44.180 --> 2:39:47.860]  last life to love it being taped on him I mean he actually wants to beat them all
[2:39:47.860 --> 2:39:52.940]  okay right here somebody in office that didn't need to be in politics I mean he's
[2:39:52.940 --> 2:39:58.260]  gotten money he that's the problem with politics most of the time they're all

[2:44:13.460 --> 2:44:18.380]  wondering if I have what's called retinitis pigmentosa I'm losing my
[2:44:18.380 --> 2:44:24.420]  eyesight and I was wondering if vaccines was a link to that yeah it's very
[2:44:24.420 --> 2:44:28.340]  possible as a matter we were talking about fungus too and mold and as
[2:44:28.340 --> 2:44:33.740]  actually a lot of people go blind and have eye problems all the time with well
[2:44:33.740 --> 2:44:38.180]  the flu shot but as on the insert it can cause type 1 diabetes they claim is
[2:44:38.180 --> 2:44:42.940]  genetic it kills your pancreas good yes yes I mean I would definitely say
[2:44:42.940 --> 2:44:50.100]  there might be a link with that but I can tell you that the a lot of people are
[2:44:50.100 --> 2:44:54.780]  using a cast a hexane-free castor oil if you've tried that putting that in your
[2:44:54.780 --> 2:44:58.700]  eyes but it works really good and actually has been shown with what is it
[2:44:58.700 --> 2:45:03.780]  it's a hexane-free certified organic castor oil you know castor oil has been
[2:45:03.780 --> 2:45:08.180]  used for for ages for detoxify what is it do the rings and cones get oxidized
[2:45:08.180 --> 2:45:12.580]  I've read about well it just depends on your environment that you're in it
[2:45:12.580 --> 2:45:15.780]  depends on your work environment it depends on I mean now you're starting
[2:45:15.780 --> 2:45:19.460]  to see people that have eye conditions from being in front of a computer screen
[2:45:19.460 --> 2:45:24.780]  along electromagnetic radiation next to the eyes when you're a logical
[2:45:24.780 --> 2:45:27.900]  disorders are off the chart when you're sleeping at night a lot of people have
[2:45:27.900 --> 2:45:31.580]  excess dust mites that are causing eye problems in their bed they're saying a
[2:45:31.580 --> 2:45:36.140]  pillow 10 years old can contain hundreds of thousands of dust mites people
[2:45:36.140 --> 2:45:39.820]  with pets oh yeah you need to get the type of fabric that knocks those out and
[2:45:39.820 --> 2:45:44.220]  replace what you're betting every year yeah I would say well now they have
[2:45:44.220 --> 2:45:48.460]  dust mite free betting and but I would definitely recommend not sleeping on a
[2:45:48.460 --> 2:45:52.820]  one of those memory foam mattresses which contain high levels of fire retardants
[2:45:52.820 --> 2:45:56.220]  can and you know bedrooms it can be a very toxic place that's one of the
[2:45:56.220 --> 2:46:01.180]  reasons why I say clean your bedroom up first get all non-toxic stuff put some
[2:46:01.180 --> 2:46:05.740]  plants in your bedroom air purification systems you know when you're sleeping at
[2:46:05.740 --> 2:46:09.900]  night you need a good environment to sleep and so that's absolutely I would
[2:46:09.900 --> 2:46:18.900]  thank you Kevin delton delton in texas you're on the air hello Alex welcome
[2:46:18.900 --> 2:46:23.220]  yes we have delton
[2:46:23.220 --> 2:46:29.700]  I had two questions first question was how do you how can you test the levels
[2:46:29.700 --> 2:46:34.180]  of the fungus in your body is it do they do a blood test or what do they do
[2:46:34.180 --> 2:46:39.180]  usually you have to go to a specialist some sort of a environmental doctor who
[2:46:39.180 --> 2:46:42.660]  specializes in environmental toxins they're around everywhere you can find
[2:46:42.660 --> 2:46:47.420]  them and then you can do a fungus panel you can do saliva testing as well as
[2:46:47.420 --> 2:46:54.780]  blood testing or the current testing methods that are available out there and
[2:46:54.780 --> 2:47:00.300]  then my second question was I live here in Houston and my father he passed away
[2:47:00.300 --> 2:47:05.020]  from cancer and so I started you know digging around searching around and
[2:47:05.020 --> 2:47:11.020]  doing different things and actually came across a dr. bruisinski or
[2:47:11.020 --> 2:47:17.700]  bruisowski he has like a protein that somehow supposed to help attack the
[2:47:17.700 --> 2:47:22.700]  cancer cell to have you ever heard or worked with him or everybody's heard of
[2:47:22.700 --> 2:47:26.100]  him he's had some really good results as a matter of fact he just had a court
[2:47:26.100 --> 2:47:31.020]  case last week and they were trying to take away his medical license and he
[2:47:31.020 --> 2:47:34.820]  ended up being on probation which is just absolutely sick and I hope that this
[2:47:34.820 --> 2:47:38.300]  new administration actually puts in some protection for some of these doctors
[2:47:38.300 --> 2:47:42.980]  that we're never gonna have innovation I mean I mean he was on 60 minutes 20
[2:47:42.980 --> 2:47:47.980]  years ago yeah he's been using what he calls anti-neoplastins and I do know
[2:47:47.980 --> 2:47:51.140]  dr. bruisinski and I talked to him his office is down the road from mine and
[2:47:51.140 --> 2:47:57.220]  he's a great guy and he's devoted his life to working with alternative or
[2:47:57.220 --> 2:48:03.260]  natural methods that work I mean 20 years ago MD Anderson had a 4% success
[2:48:03.260 --> 2:48:09.500]  rate with cancer and cancer you know chemotherapy and radiation are not the
[2:48:09.500 --> 2:48:14.300]  answer there's plenty of different doctors I talked to doctors all over the
[2:48:14.300 --> 2:48:18.620]  world let's expand on this the globalist want to depopulate trump talks
[2:48:18.620 --> 2:48:22.220]  about suppressed technologies he knows as president now he wants to start

[2:50:08.980 --> 2:50:12.860]  guys got that in the bone broth that's amazing it's got the betelenic acid from
[2:50:12.860 --> 2:50:19.700]  the birch trees which is amazing ah cc is being studied in Japan that's active
[2:50:19.700 --> 2:50:24.660]  hexas corlea compound and they have a patent on it Japanese do and it's
[2:50:24.660 --> 2:50:28.020]  amazing a lot of cancer patients are taking that there and it's done wonders
[2:50:28.020 --> 2:50:33.860]  for a lot of people yeah the AACC has been around for about 15 no more than
[2:50:33.860 --> 2:50:37.020]  that probably about 20 years we were doing research with that actually when
[2:50:37.020 --> 2:50:42.260]  we were doing when I was involved with a alternative cancer research team back in
[2:50:42.260 --> 2:50:47.780]  the mid 90s and that was that was a new exciting product that was out so keep
[2:50:47.780 --> 2:50:52.700]  going on the mushrooms brother yep in the AACC that is the mycelium of the
[2:50:52.700 --> 2:50:58.900]  mushrooms like the actual root of the mushrooms yeah and you just extract that
[2:50:58.900 --> 2:51:03.500]  into a tea or whatever and yeah you do that with racing shot because a lot of
[2:51:03.500 --> 2:51:06.380]  the medicinal mushrooms those actually need you can't really eat them you have
[2:51:06.380 --> 2:51:13.340]  to extract them and they're really hard like chaga and Rashi and yeah those are
[2:51:13.340 --> 2:51:17.300]  amazing it's almost morale season I encourage everyone to pick morels and eat
[2:51:17.300 --> 2:51:22.140]  wild morel mushrooms I was gonna I was gonna ask you about morels you know
[2:51:22.140 --> 2:51:25.540]  we've been looking at it's a very expensive mushroom I love morel
[2:51:25.540 --> 2:51:30.460]  mushrooms but it's very therapeutic and we were thinking about actually putting
[2:51:30.460 --> 2:51:35.540]  some morels in a formula but God's given us incredible magic on this magic
[2:51:35.540 --> 2:51:39.660]  planet it's a luxury item I why is the fungus getting out of control the bad
[2:51:39.660 --> 2:51:42.620]  ones why is it spreading everywhere they admit it's like killing everything yeah
[2:51:42.620 --> 2:51:46.100]  I think it's just like most of bats are dead from it yeah the the conditions
[2:51:46.100 --> 2:51:50.220]  everywhere and in the well you know there's been reports and there's been
[2:51:50.220 --> 2:51:56.580]  testing done that it's being sprayed in chemtrails it's also sure but see the
[2:51:56.580 --> 2:52:00.460]  dichotomy weapon mushrooms and good fungus have some of the most incredible
[2:52:00.460 --> 2:52:04.100]  compounds on earth they admit so it's like the best thing in the world is the
[2:52:04.100 --> 2:52:09.180]  worst thing it's like yeah I mean not only are our funguses for people as a
[2:52:09.180 --> 2:52:13.380]  bio weapon but they've been used against crops especially like in Vietnam they
[2:52:13.380 --> 2:52:19.540]  used a a rice fungus to knock out the CIA's famously even puts funguses on the
[2:52:19.540 --> 2:52:23.700]  legs of insects on food and then they release them if you take away a people's
[2:52:23.700 --> 2:52:28.980]  food supply you're going to cripple that that population so it's not like we're
[2:52:28.980 --> 2:52:32.860]  gonna put the fungus here in your body we're gonna put the fungus on the food
[2:52:32.860 --> 2:52:37.740]  and that's used to wipe out it was used to wipe out the opium plant as well as
[2:52:37.740 --> 2:52:43.900]  in war with you madam yeah thank you so much yeah let's go down cocaine production I see him in Florida you're on the
[2:52:43.900 --> 2:52:50.940]  air thanks for holding hello hi Alex I'm a team from Orlando Florida I actually
[2:52:50.940 --> 2:52:55.180]  live in the actual area where Trump recently came and visit the the school
[2:52:55.180 --> 2:52:59.820]  in the pine nose area and I was a very exciting time I was able to actually see
[2:52:59.820 --> 2:53:03.060]  him there but it was kind of cool thank you for calling in what's on your mind
[2:53:03.060 --> 2:53:10.100]  on this Wednesday edition I'm what's on my mind right now is that the craziness
[2:53:10.100 --> 2:53:13.540]  with a with Obama right now and the fact that all of the stuff is coming about
[2:53:13.540 --> 2:53:18.180]  about the stuff that he's been doing illegally with the the going after
[2:53:18.180 --> 2:53:22.380]  Trump with the wiretap stuff and also with the fending me and fading me stuff
[2:53:22.380 --> 2:53:25.820]  it's kind of coming out to me that he's been doing a lot of illegal stuff and
[2:53:25.820 --> 2:53:28.500]  that he's gonna be in a lot of trouble coming soon I know he's talking about
[2:53:28.500 --> 2:53:32.380]  he's rolling and he's coming but I think you should be being a lot of trouble
[2:53:32.380 --> 2:53:36.020]  right now I think you should actually be far away from the White House right now
[2:53:36.020 --> 2:53:40.380]  in my opinion yeah that's a question why is Obama so arrogant and the rest of
[2:53:40.380 --> 2:53:46.100]  the globalist is Hillary they just maybe there's delusional butter group I think
[2:53:46.100 --> 2:53:52.460]  the majority of the people in the the Obama administration might and
[2:53:52.460 --> 2:53:55.340]  hopefully will be locked up for everything that they've done I mean
[2:53:55.340 --> 2:53:58.380]  everybody thinks that oh we were in living in such great times but don't
[2:53:58.380 --> 2:54:02.420]  forget this is these of the administrations that supported genetically modified
[2:54:02.420 --> 2:54:07.260]  foods supported the use of herbicides and insecticides supports the use of
[2:54:07.260 --> 2:54:12.340]  fluoride supported the use of everything that was designed to dumb down the
[2:54:12.340 --> 2:54:18.540]  population kill the population and they continued to progress forward in that in
[2:54:18.540 --> 2:54:23.780]  that manner to reduce the population and continue to destroy the planet so I
[2:54:23.780 --> 2:54:28.020]  mean I don't you know people are all in a hype about Trump but look what the past
[2:54:28.020 --> 2:54:32.140]  administrations have done to us look what they've done to the but we look at
[2:54:32.140 --> 2:54:36.180]  Trump that's sterile right now almost 300,000 new jobs in just a month and a
[2:54:36.180 --> 2:54:40.740]  half trillions in the stock market hundreds of billions of new jobs just
[2:54:40.740 --> 2:54:44.500]  cutting off the globalist programs that were designed so you couldn't work here
[2:54:44.500 --> 2:54:50.020]  on the US he is taking the globalist boot off our neck yeah I mean this is the
[2:54:50.020 --> 2:54:54.900]  first time you know that we can progress we we're at the point of no return
[2:54:54.900 --> 2:54:59.020]  almost with health care you know talk about all these trillions and trillions
[2:54:59.020 --> 2:55:02.220]  of dollars being spent on health care well they're creating the trillions of
[2:55:02.220 --> 2:55:06.060]  dollars no exactly but I mean if Trump was doing bad stuff I come out against
[2:55:06.060 --> 2:55:10.220]  it and he was wrong on torture he backed off that I don't like this new this
[2:55:10.220 --> 2:55:12.580]  bill is better than Obamacare but you know what the Republicans came up was
[2:55:12.580 --> 2:55:16.660]  pretty bad he's saying it's a negotiation but I mean you know so the Trump was
[2:55:16.660 --> 2:55:20.580]  bad stuff I'll expose it but I mean I just can't believe this is so real but
[2:55:20.580 --> 2:55:23.540]  again there's not just evil in the world folks that's what's happening thank you
[2:55:23.540 --> 2:55:29.820]  Azim great points Jay Jay in Colorado you're on the year go ahead Alex doctor
[2:55:29.820 --> 2:55:34.540]  group big fan I'm listening for over 20 years I'm a huge info warrior thank you
[2:55:34.540 --> 2:55:39.660]  I'm on a permanent disability and I'm home every day so I basically work eight
[2:55:39.660 --> 2:55:43.700]  hours a day 40 hours a week spreading info wars links you're having a big
[2:55:43.700 --> 2:55:47.980]  effect they're trying to shut us down with the algorithms so you're you're in a
[2:55:47.980 --> 2:55:52.300]  big battle thank you doctor group I think you hit the nail on the head here I
[2:55:52.300 --> 2:55:57.540]  hope Trump listens to you this is a major concern of mine with my health I'm a
[2:55:57.540 --> 2:56:02.060]  five-year cancer survivor and I use as many products as I can on them I'm on a
[2:56:02.060 --> 2:56:07.780]  very limited income but I think Trump needs to really address things from a
[2:56:07.780 --> 2:56:12.460]  completely different perspective and completely just come out against the
[2:56:12.460 --> 2:56:17.500]  mainstream system the allopathic medicine is not working for our country the
[2:56:17.500 --> 2:56:22.260]  Obamacare is not working for our country the CIA is obviously not working for
[2:56:22.260 --> 2:56:26.340]  our they admit it's killing us they admit they admit but it's all the people that
[2:56:26.340 --> 2:56:31.140]  are standing up that have been creating change it's everybody creating and
[2:56:31.140 --> 2:56:34.740]  educating the public about all these things that have created the change like
[2:56:34.740 --> 2:56:39.300]  all of the March against Monsanto for example I mean they're just gonna keep
[2:56:39.300 --> 2:56:43.060]  going up going on and going on and go hopefully not I mean I mean I'm talking
[2:56:43.060 --> 2:56:47.140]  about the last regime but now I mean because you still have infiltrators in
[2:56:47.140 --> 2:56:50.620]  there too Alex that that we need to get rid of like McCain and in the people
[2:56:50.620 --> 2:56:54.460]  that are just constantly giving all right yeah Paul Ryan that are just
[2:56:54.460 --> 2:56:57.660]  constantly you know butting heads with him on everything and coming they admit
[2:56:57.660 --> 2:57:01.700]  he's the one that did this bill to sabotage Trump but but yeah I'm hoping
[2:57:01.700 --> 2:57:04.900]  that you know we can address some of these issues and address the root cause
[2:57:04.900 --> 2:57:11.700]  of health in America Jay the last mother so go ahead well natural natural
[2:57:11.700 --> 2:57:16.460]  pathic health is the way to go and that is the new tech that is the secret
[2:57:16.460 --> 2:57:21.100]  that's hidden right in plain sight so doctor group thank you so much for what
[2:57:21.100 --> 2:57:25.300]  you're doing I hope that info wars will consider some sort of disabled pricing
[2:57:25.300 --> 2:57:28.500]  for those of us that are on a lower income to be able to afford more of
[2:57:28.500 --> 2:57:31.180]  your great I want to make them less expensive the problem is get the best
[2:57:31.180 --> 2:57:36.300]  ingredients is expensive Mike and PA a PhD chemist on more gallons go ahead
[2:57:36.300 --> 2:57:42.540]  Mike good afternoon gentlemen yeah I just want to bring something to your
[2:57:42.540 --> 2:57:46.420]  attention doctor group thank you for what you do I didn't exactly get a PA
[2:57:46.420 --> 2:57:49.860]  from a community college so I'm gonna put this out real quick and I hope you
[2:57:49.860 --> 2:57:55.420]  guys are listening over you know that I'm at corporation who's been putting out
[2:57:55.420 --> 2:57:59.980]  a machine that uses a quaternary ammonium solution to decontaminate areas this is
[2:57:59.980 --> 2:58:04.220]  a direct correlation with more gallons disease and the propagation of
[2:58:04.220 --> 2:58:07.780]  quaternary ammonium throughout our society and what it's been used in
[2:58:07.780 --> 2:58:12.340]  conventional medicine it has a direct result on a demyelination effect so
[2:58:12.340 --> 2:58:18.060]  what's your point I mean what we come out of more gallons so my point on more
[2:58:18.060 --> 2:58:23.980]  gallons disease is more gallons disease is a direct result of an introduction of
[2:58:23.980 --> 2:58:29.700]  things such as the barium salt and quaternary ammonium into the system
[2:58:29.700 --> 2:58:34.020]  through things such as chemtrailing and and so and then weird stuff's growing in
[2:58:34.020 --> 2:58:37.780]  the atmosphere is what I've been told some weird geoengineering this doesn't look
[2:58:37.780 --> 2:58:42.860]  you know falling in and letting everybody know come back and say more say don't look you the
[2:58:42.860 --> 2:58:46.380]  whole stuff going on like people didn't come up and I'm not into like green
[2:58:46.380 --> 2:58:48.940]  men and stuff but this doesn't look normal we'll be back with five more
[2:58:48.940 --> 2:58:53.700]  minutes I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality
[2:58:53.700 --> 2:58:59.900]  info wars biome defense probiotic we wanted to come out with the largest
[2:58:59.900 --> 2:59:06.580]  spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve
[2:59:06.580 --> 2:59:12.460]  overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body biome defense
[2:59:12.460 --> 2:59:17.700]  is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23
[2:59:17.700 --> 2:59:22.020]  different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and
[2:59:22.020 --> 2:59:25.900]  intestinal function our researchers are confident that we have been able to
[2:59:25.900 --> 2:59:31.380]  develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market secure your biome
[2:59:31.380 --> 2:59:35.780]  defense in ultra strength or regular strength at info wars life com today and
[2:59:35.780 --> 2:59:40.180]  get started supporting your digestive system naturally we've been testing this
[2:59:40.180 --> 2:59:43.980]  formula for years but this is the limited first run to the public so please
[2:59:43.980 --> 2:59:49.660]  take advantage of it today support your own health and support the info war
[2:59:49.660 --> 3:00:05.460]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:05.460 --> 3:00:21.940]  they all understand how it can be lies and dissent yeah it's alex jones not my
[3:00:21.940 --> 3:00:28.980]  point of view it's a fact and you know it's true yeah the CIA spying on you
[3:00:28.980 --> 3:00:33.580]  so the NSA they say Trump should be impeached for saying it I say God bless
[3:00:33.580 --> 3:00:38.300]  Trump for blowing this whole thing wide open and God bless you for blowing it
[3:00:38.300 --> 3:00:43.300]  wide open viewers and listeners believe me the info wars audience it didn't hype
[3:00:43.300 --> 3:00:46.500]  when I tell you you're the tip of the spear here the wrecking ball you're the
[3:00:46.500 --> 3:00:53.220]  blood and guts and the soul of this operation so I salute you
[3:00:53.380 --> 3:00:56.980]  I'll take a few more calls because Roger Stone is late getting to the
[3:00:56.980 --> 3:01:03.780]  microphone so I'm not cut into Roger's time folks I'm just here never know what
[3:01:03.780 --> 3:01:06.820]  a hit product's gonna be I knew this one I'm you were kept waiting for years to
[3:01:06.820 --> 3:01:10.820]  get it just right you were told me that's like four years ago micro zx any
[3:01:10.820 --> 3:01:14.420]  funnel any yeast now available this is gonna sell out very very quickly but
[3:01:14.420 --> 3:01:18.220]  it's got so many ingredients that are organic hoping get more back in soon
[3:01:18.220 --> 3:01:23.900]  yeah normally you take a supplement a supplement because you know you have
[3:01:23.900 --> 3:01:28.460]  something but the problem with that we're dealing with today is nobody really
[3:01:28.460 --> 3:01:34.900]  knows that they have yeast overgrowth or fungus overgrowth or mold overgrowth so
[3:01:34.900 --> 3:01:39.900]  you can just everyone is especially in the south you're really hot areas you
[3:01:39.900 --> 3:01:42.980]  should take it it doesn't matter where you are I mean I guarantee you could
[3:01:42.980 --> 3:01:45.740]  probably test nine out of ten people and they're gonna have different types of
[3:01:45.740 --> 3:01:49.100]  mold and fungus and yeast in their body and it's just another way to cleanse
[3:01:49.100 --> 3:01:54.020]  your body and reactivate your body self-healing mechanism and get rid of that
[3:01:54.020 --> 3:01:58.940]  why is it called my cozy x well my co is kind of a is kind of a technical word
[3:01:58.940 --> 3:02:06.140]  for Mike you know my coplasm or my co fungus you know it's a fungus term so I
[3:02:06.140 --> 3:02:10.380]  don't go to Joel where you came up with the zx from Joel in Washington you're
[3:02:10.380 --> 3:02:17.420]  on the air glad hello Alex dr. group I had a question for dr. group wondering
[3:02:17.420 --> 3:02:23.020]  if the the biome defense culture is mesophilic or is it thermophilic because
[3:02:23.020 --> 3:02:29.260]  I make cheese I've got sheep and goats I've made Chevra and yogurt with it but
[3:02:29.260 --> 3:02:34.420]  if it's a thermophilic culture I can make a lot different other variety of
[3:02:34.420 --> 3:02:39.100]  cheeses yeah I don't really have a detailed information on you on that for
[3:02:39.100 --> 3:02:42.420]  you yet it is he's saying you can make cheese with this stuff no we've we've
[3:02:42.420 --> 3:02:45.580]  actually had it's a good question we've actually had some people doing some
[3:02:45.580 --> 3:02:50.740]  experimentation with that and we actually have all of that in testing and the
[3:02:50.740 --> 3:02:55.500]  reason why I say that is because some of these some of the probiotics that we
[3:02:55.500 --> 3:03:01.740]  use and we also use a certified organic a gum acacia and when we mixed the
[3:03:01.740 --> 3:03:05.300]  product we're doing stability testing right now we're doing some of those
[3:03:05.300 --> 3:03:09.220]  thermophilic tests right now to determine if some of the probiotics are
[3:03:09.220 --> 3:03:14.020]  more active than others with with heat or cold and there's a possibility that
[3:03:14.020 --> 3:03:18.100]  might not even need to be stored you know I'm not a raga scientist but if
[3:03:18.100 --> 3:03:21.820]  you're filled with all these bad bacteria yeast and stuff bomb yourself with
[3:03:21.820 --> 3:03:28.500]  the known good ones I mean it right no it's not necessarily known good ones
[3:03:28.500 --> 3:03:34.180]  but it's select ones that you know that have been tested and studied that are
[3:03:34.180 --> 3:03:38.660]  that are hand-picked Joel this is all about my pay grade well what are you
[3:03:38.660 --> 3:03:41.540]  getting into exactly talking about yogurt culture he's trying to be able to make
[3:03:41.540 --> 3:03:45.580]  culture he's trying to use these probiotics to make you know because those
[3:03:45.580 --> 3:03:50.540]  are good sources of probiotics kombucha no I got it so he wants to make cheese
[3:03:50.540 --> 3:03:54.540]  and stuff with good probiotics that's what I'm getting right Joel right and
[3:03:54.540 --> 3:03:58.700]  I've actually tried it and it comes out really good that with the yogurt it
[3:03:58.700 --> 3:04:04.460]  came out really nice and thick the only thing is is that it had a little bit of
[3:04:04.460 --> 3:04:09.460]  coloring because of the the actual color of the probiotic but I don't care
[3:04:09.460 --> 3:04:14.740]  about that and the show was a purple compared to the normal Chevrolet culture
[3:04:14.740 --> 3:04:20.020]  it had a little more of a sweet flavor to it which was actually quite good yeah
[3:04:20.020 --> 3:04:24.340]  no I mean there's definitely not gonna be anything that could be detrimental
[3:04:24.340 --> 3:04:28.340]  that I think would happen in there I mean ultimately you're probably doing a
[3:04:28.340 --> 3:04:32.020]  good job and creating something's gonna be extremely beneficial to eat that's
[3:04:32.020 --> 3:04:37.020]  smart probiotic cheese and stuff that is I know like they say all the like
[3:04:37.020 --> 3:04:40.980]  sauerkraut stuff already is probiotic yeah there's there's just specific
[3:04:40.980 --> 3:04:44.260]  cultures but to be able to experiment like that I love what you're doing Joel I
[3:04:44.260 --> 3:04:48.620]  mean that we're out of time thank you I'm gonna come in there just tell me should

[3:05:00.700 --> 3:05:06.260]  debunked claim alleging then candidate Donald Trump ran a secret server to

[3:05:12.100 --> 3:05:16.540]  establishment mainstream media is now rehashing the story which has already
[3:05:16.540 --> 3:05:21.140]  been debunked after president Donald Trump on Saturday accused his
[3:05:21.140 --> 3:05:26.660]  predecessor Barack Obama of illegally wiretapping phone calls at New York's
[3:05:26.660 --> 3:05:31.300]  Trump Tower mainstream media outlets began to list possible surveillance

[3:08:52.260 --> 3:08:57.340]  meanwhile the news is saying Bloomberg we need to impeach Trump because he
[3:08:57.340 --> 3:09:04.700]  claims their surveillance going on when we now have the vault seven or at least
[3:09:04.700 --> 3:09:08.780]  proving everything we'd already reported this is a crazy time to be alive
[3:09:08.780 --> 3:09:14.100]  Roger Stone where would you say we are politically in the history of man in
[3:09:14.100 --> 3:09:21.580]  2017 go ahead and take over well Alex I'm going to take your advice next week
[3:09:21.580 --> 3:09:26.140]  because I think we could improve my segments with more political discussion
[3:09:26.140 --> 3:09:31.180]  perhaps fewer guests although I'm very pleased to have my guests with me today
[3:09:31.180 --> 3:09:36.420]  Alex I think we're on the cusp of the greatest single political scandal in
[3:09:36.420 --> 3:09:43.340]  American history this it makes a Watergate pale in comparison the compounded
[3:09:43.340 --> 3:09:49.020]  lies that are now devastating the establishment are interrelated on the
[3:09:49.020 --> 3:09:53.820]  one hand they clearly had the Republican candidate for president under
[3:09:53.820 --> 3:10:00.580]  surveillance and at the exact same time their rationale for doing so has been
[3:10:00.580 --> 3:10:08.060]  completely exposed as fraudulent and political this could do to the
[3:10:08.060 --> 3:10:12.300]  Democratic Party what Watergate did to the Republican Party it could have a
[3:10:12.300 --> 3:10:17.420]  devastating effect on the midterm elections but I think very much like
[3:10:17.420 --> 3:10:22.020]  Watergate Alex it's going to take some time to get to the bottom of this
[3:10:22.020 --> 3:10:27.780]  remember the Watergate break-in was in June that November Nixon carried 49
[3:10:27.780 --> 3:10:33.380]  states stonewalling against critics it wasn't until almost a year and a half
[3:10:33.380 --> 3:10:39.060]  later that the entire Watergate cover-up collapsed and that's how it will be here
[3:10:39.060 --> 3:10:43.460]  in my opinion all I know is a month ago the New York Times is bragging that
[3:10:43.460 --> 3:10:48.140]  they've been surveilling Trump Tower and had all this stuff on Flynn and then
[3:10:48.140 --> 3:10:50.660]  now they said they never did it but I'm turning it over to you you got a full
[3:10:50.660 --> 3:10:57.260]  slate of big guests today Roger Stone go ahead Alex the New York Times turns out
[3:10:57.260 --> 3:11:01.620]  to be an unwitting hand-baiting of the intelligence services if you go back to
[3:11:01.620 --> 3:11:08.300]  their story on January 20th and you go to their story several weeks ago in both
[3:11:08.300 --> 3:11:16.020]  cases they were central intelligence sources say that they have emails
[3:11:16.020 --> 3:11:23.220]  financial transaction records and telephone intercepts and of course the
[3:11:23.220 --> 3:11:28.420]  New York Times hasn't seen any of those they haven't been produced for the
[3:11:28.420 --> 3:11:34.180]  American people to look at and the Times just takes with the CIA says at base
[3:11:34.180 --> 3:11:41.860]  value given their track record of lying about torture in the Iraq war lying
[3:11:41.860 --> 3:11:51.540]  about Benghazi lying about rendition lying about Iran Contra lying about
[3:11:51.540 --> 3:11:58.460]  about weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein I don't know why anyone
[3:11:58.460 --> 3:12:07.580]  would believe them and now the chickens are coming home to roost James the
[3:12:07.580 --> 3:12:14.940]  Defense Intelligence Director for for Obama coming out and saying that there
[3:12:14.940 --> 3:12:22.620]  was no spying and there was also no Russian infiltration into the Trump
[3:12:22.620 --> 3:12:28.460]  campaign isn't attempted to fuse this but I don't think that is going to work
[3:12:28.460 --> 3:12:33.700]  and frankly I think the entire Obama crew as I wrote today at Stone Cold
[3:12:33.700 --> 3:12:38.620]  Truth needs to be dragged in front of a grand jury to find out exactly what did
[3:12:38.620 --> 3:12:46.620]  happen shows yours Roger you got your guests waiting yes indeed so I would
[3:12:46.620 --> 3:12:51.580]  like to focus first on the question of John Brennan the CIA director because
[3:12:51.580 --> 3:12:58.900]  this in my opinion he is the the focal point of the of the disinformation
[3:12:58.900 --> 3:13:03.260]  campaign you might have noticed last week in several different media
[3:13:03.260 --> 3:13:08.580]  publications he came out and said I am not the leaker I am not the leaker well
[3:13:08.580 --> 3:13:13.620]  in Washington as you know Alex when somebody announces that they are not
[3:13:13.620 --> 3:13:20.500]  the leaker that means they are the leaker the man duff protests too much and
[3:13:20.500 --> 3:13:26.020]  therefore joining us today from the American spectator we have George
[3:13:26.020 --> 3:13:32.500]  Neumeyer who has written a terrific piece because we have talked a great deal
[3:13:32.500 --> 3:13:38.580]  at Info Wars about John Brennan's incredible background and we have
[3:13:38.580 --> 3:13:45.180]  wondered how he got you know into the position of being CIA director just for
[3:13:45.180 --> 3:13:50.820]  the record according to his Wiki biography Mr. Brennan was an active
[3:13:50.820 --> 3:13:57.020]  supporter of the Communist Party candidate for President Gus Hall and when
[3:13:57.020 --> 3:14:03.460]  I was on MSNBC only days ago I was ridiculed for saying that Brennan in his
[3:14:03.460 --> 3:14:08.500]  younger days had been a communist thank you for joining us here and we're
[3:14:08.500 --> 3:14:14.220]  delighted to have a fine representative of the American spectator good to be
[3:14:14.220 --> 3:14:19.500]  with you thanks for having me so I'll line for us if you would this very
[3:14:19.500 --> 3:14:25.220]  important piece that you did that outlines you know the role of Mr. Brennan
[3:14:25.220 --> 3:14:31.860]  who I believe is the linchpin the chief conspirator in this effort to smear
[3:14:31.860 --> 3:14:38.180]  Donald Trump and to make the case that there was something nefarious about his
[3:14:38.180 --> 3:14:43.620]  election when in fact it was the globalists who were seeking to thwart
[3:14:43.620 --> 3:14:49.980]  the Constitution smear Trump and steal the selection for Hillary Clinton
[3:14:49.980 --> 3:14:55.940]  yeah that he is the genesis of the government's investigation into the
[3:14:55.940 --> 3:15:02.220]  Trump campaign he received a half-baked piece of intelligence from an
[3:15:02.220 --> 3:15:08.100]  intelligence agency in one of the Baltic states probably Estonia and he used
[3:15:08.100 --> 3:15:12.700]  that to convince Coney and Loretta Lynch and the rest of the intelligence
[3:15:12.700 --> 3:15:19.900]  community to pursue a FISA court warrant that would allow the US government to
[3:15:19.900 --> 3:15:25.860]  intercept communications from Trump Tower now it is by understanding that the
[3:15:25.860 --> 3:15:31.980]  that the government first went to the FISA court in June they asked for
[3:15:31.980 --> 3:15:38.380]  permission to wiretap to surveil Trump Tower they also asked for surveillance of
[3:15:38.380 --> 3:15:45.540]  three US citizens yours truly Paul J. Manafort and of course Carter Page
[3:15:45.540 --> 3:15:53.180]  whoever he is some guy who managed to join a Trump issue advisory group it's
[3:15:53.180 --> 3:16:00.460]  unclear whether the FISA court disallowed the tapping of Trump but may
[3:16:00.460 --> 3:16:06.180]  have approved the surveillance of the three of us in June or whether they
[3:16:06.180 --> 3:16:13.300]  turned down the entire request and only approved it in October if that is the
[3:16:13.300 --> 3:16:18.140]  case I think the clearest way for the president to clear the air on this entire
[3:16:18.140 --> 3:16:25.540]  matter is to order the the release of all of the documents that were filed with
[3:16:25.540 --> 3:16:32.140]  the FISA court yeah that's right and you'll notice that John Brennan has not
[3:16:32.140 --> 3:16:37.860]  said a word that Trump sent that tweet out on Sunday you know he's the person
[3:16:37.860 --> 3:16:42.300]  with the most information here and he said nothing they've sent out clapper
[3:16:42.300 --> 3:16:46.500]  because he doesn't know the whole story it's almost like a repeat of the Susan
[3:16:46.500 --> 3:16:50.860]  Rice situation in Benghazi where Yabana people send out the person with the
[3:16:50.860 --> 3:16:56.180]  least amount of information to deny the story well what's interesting of course
[3:16:56.180 --> 3:17:04.500]  is that that the the sequence of events here I'm convinced is the president
[3:17:04.500 --> 3:17:11.260]  gives an extraordinarily effective State of the Union address he has wind in his
[3:17:11.260 --> 3:17:15.940]  sails the intelligence community immediately
[3:17:15.940 --> 3:17:23.820]  leaks the sessions meetings with the with the Russian ambassador in an
[3:17:23.820 --> 3:17:30.340]  attempt to break Trump's momentum and then Donald Trump who may be the single
[3:17:30.340 --> 3:17:35.460]  best political strategist in the country today on the basis of instinct lays this
[3:17:35.460 --> 3:17:38.820]  on the Russians over the weekend or should say lays it on the intelligence
[3:17:38.820 --> 3:17:44.820]  services regaining the initiative and changing the entire narrative so that
[3:17:44.820 --> 3:17:50.700]  Obama and the Obama administration are on defense and Trump is back on offense
[3:17:50.700 --> 3:17:55.700]  this is a classic example of the brilliance of Donald Trump and his
[3:17:55.700 --> 3:18:01.380]  unique understanding of the news cycle and particularly our hardly our highly
[3:18:01.380 --> 3:18:08.380]  charged cable television networks that of course cover this stuff ad nauseam
[3:18:08.380 --> 3:18:14.700]  Trump is on the attack freedom is on the attack the globalists are now in
[3:18:14.700 --> 3:18:23.100]  decline the fact that they sought these warrants based on no evidence no probable
[3:18:23.100 --> 3:18:31.020]  cause it is really extraordinary as you know George it is very rare for a US
[3:18:31.020 --> 3:18:37.740]  citizen to to be the target of the FISA court generally speaking the FISA court
[3:18:37.740 --> 3:18:43.620]  is used to wiretap foreign nationals within the United States that has
[3:18:43.620 --> 3:18:49.740]  generally been the case so I'm very curious to know whether the whether the
[3:18:49.740 --> 3:18:56.220]  warrants were for Manafort myself and Paige were approved in June or approved
[3:18:56.220 --> 3:19:00.980]  in October just where do you think this story goes I know the president has
[3:19:00.980 --> 3:19:07.020]  called for a congressional inquiry I'm not sure that that's the best avenue in
[3:19:07.020 --> 3:19:11.180]  all honesty I think there's a high probability that such an inquiry would
[3:19:11.180 --> 3:19:18.100]  get highly politicized and you'd have mindless fools like Elijah Cummings who
[3:19:18.100 --> 3:19:22.300]  continues to insist that there is evidence that there is proof when of
[3:19:22.300 --> 3:19:29.620]  course there is none where do you think this goes well I think yeah as you were
[3:19:29.620 --> 3:19:34.820]  saying there the people responsible for these leaks now we've been hearing for
[3:19:34.820 --> 3:19:39.620]  six months now that the government has been investigating Trump campaign
[3:19:39.620 --> 3:19:43.420]  Russia ties you know we're in Georgia I'm gonna have to break you there we'll
[3:19:43.420 --> 3:19:48.340]  come right back we are going to go to a break here and I want to remind people

[3:19:53.980 --> 3:19:59.460]  this broadcast and this effort to bring the American people the truth the truth
[3:19:59.460 --> 3:20:04.140]  this is the story of the shaving company called Harry's in an epic battle of
[3:20:04.140 --> 3:20:08.820]  David versus Goliath in the early 1980s a child was born two of them actually
[3:20:08.820 --> 3:20:13.820]  their names were Jeff and Andy time went by they developed facial hair and one

[3:20:29.980 --> 3:20:34.060]  to customers how did the overpriced razor company respond by threatening to
[3:20:34.060 --> 3:20:37.980]  sue their pants off don't worry Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a

[3:23:59.820 --> 3:24:16.940]  I'm Roger Stone and thanks for joining us again at InfoWars I want to return to
[3:24:16.940 --> 3:24:22.260]  George Neumeyer of the American spectator on the subject of CIA director
[3:24:22.260 --> 3:24:26.900]  John Brennan where we left it off was that trying to determine where this
[3:24:26.900 --> 3:24:32.220]  inquiry will go next whether it will be a congressional investigation that
[3:24:32.220 --> 3:24:37.980]  ultimately brings the Obama crew down or whether perhaps Jeff Sessions will
[3:24:37.980 --> 3:24:45.100]  impane a le grand jury and pull the various Obama administration officials
[3:24:45.100 --> 3:24:52.220]  such as Lorena Lynch Obama himself of course the the director of central
[3:24:52.220 --> 3:24:57.380]  intelligence John Brennan Ash Carter the defense secretary so George where do
[3:24:57.380 --> 3:25:02.620]  you think this goes I cut you off at the end of the last section segment yeah I
[3:25:02.620 --> 3:25:07.820]  think either scenario that you sketch there is plausible but I think the
[3:25:07.820 --> 3:25:13.820]  bottom line is as you were saying the the this is gonna boomerang back on the
[3:25:13.820 --> 3:25:18.180]  criminal leakers and I think the criminal leakers around John Brennan and
[3:25:18.180 --> 3:25:23.660]  maybe even Brennan himself are the most vulnerable here because it's gonna come
[3:25:23.660 --> 3:25:28.620]  out that they that they went to their spinographers in the press like David
[3:25:28.620 --> 3:25:34.500]  Ignatius of Washington Post and they gave them information that was a
[3:25:34.500 --> 3:25:40.460]  violation of the law and I think Trump will ultimately be vindicated in terms
[3:25:40.460 --> 3:25:46.300]  of we'll find out that that at the very least the US government investigation
[3:25:46.300 --> 3:25:53.160]  into Trump Tower was initiated and that yeah it would be ironic of course if John
[3:25:53.160 --> 3:25:58.620]  Brennan was instigator of it on the basis of phony intelligence from one of
[3:25:58.620 --> 3:26:05.860]  these Baltic countries it would be ironic of course if the FISA court warrant
[3:26:05.860 --> 3:26:12.380]  approval gives the administration a rubric of legality that would not change
[3:26:12.380 --> 3:26:19.220]  the fact that the the leaks the leak regarding General Flynn and Russia the
[3:26:19.220 --> 3:26:26.340]  leak regarding the FISA courts warrants themselves regarding Manafort and I just
[3:26:26.340 --> 3:26:33.180]  those leaks are as you know a felony published punishable by no less than 10
[3:26:33.180 --> 3:26:39.260]  years in prison so you know at the end of the day as Harry Truman said the buck
[3:26:39.260 --> 3:26:46.740]  stops here and the the ultimate responsibility whether Barack Obama
[3:26:46.740 --> 3:26:53.020]  ordered the the break in or I should say the surveillance or not is really
[3:26:53.020 --> 3:26:58.460]  immaterial assuming that his Justice Department ordered it which I think is
[3:26:58.460 --> 3:27:06.420]  probable he is a parsing words in a lawyer-like way to say that oh I didn't
[3:27:06.420 --> 3:27:12.380]  order it I think he's disingenuous at best and then the late collusion of
[3:27:12.380 --> 3:27:18.540]  Hillary Clinton who who you know a week before the election says that computer
[3:27:18.540 --> 3:27:24.620]  scientists have have determined that there is a server in Trump Tower that
[3:27:24.620 --> 3:27:28.540]  is in touch with the Russians well clearly she has been tipped off by the
[3:27:28.540 --> 3:27:34.340]  Central Intelligence Agency this is this is makes Watergate look like child's
[3:27:34.340 --> 3:27:41.660]  play in terms of the unconstitutional and in fact evil intense of the entire
[3:27:41.660 --> 3:27:46.980]  operation again we surveilled the Republican candidate for president
[3:27:46.980 --> 3:27:53.540]  based on a Hillary Clinton campaign press release and that's it that is
[3:27:53.540 --> 3:28:00.740]  their their proof folks and that is not proof at all and if you go back and you
[3:28:00.740 --> 3:28:06.580]  look at the BBC story which was one of the stories that that has served as the
[3:28:06.580 --> 3:28:12.820]  basis of all this discussion it says that they got the information from a US
[3:28:12.820 --> 3:28:19.100]  senior intelligence community member and in that paragraph it says that John
[3:28:19.100 --> 3:28:24.660]  Brennan started all this with information from an intelligence agency in a
[3:28:24.660 --> 3:28:30.340]  Baltic country so how did that BBC reporter get that piece of information it
[3:28:30.340 --> 3:28:37.260]  had to come from either Brennan himself or somebody around Brennan it is
[3:28:37.260 --> 3:28:43.140]  extraordinary that the Trump administration has not moved in a in a
[3:28:43.140 --> 3:28:51.140]  speedier fashion to replace the many second and third level bureaucrats who
[3:28:51.140 --> 3:28:56.260]  are you know still infecting these agencies that's where the leaks are
[3:28:56.260 --> 3:29:00.900]  coming so the administration has a double problem now leaks out of the
[3:29:00.900 --> 3:29:06.180]  departments from Obama loyalists and then some limited leaks from his own
[3:29:06.180 --> 3:29:11.500]  White House from the establishment Republicans there that he has hired now
[3:29:11.500 --> 3:29:18.500]  Washington as you know has always been obsessed with leaks and leaking but they
[3:29:18.500 --> 3:29:24.220]  have rarely found the perps because of course the news media continues to
[3:29:24.220 --> 3:29:28.540]  protect them in any event I thank you George Neumauer for joining us here on
[3:29:28.540 --> 3:29:34.900]  info wars.com and we'll be right back to talk about the largest versioning

[3:30:10.140 --> 3:30:15.380]  race has resurfaced the establishment mainstream media is now rehashing this
[3:30:15.380 --> 3:30:19.900]  story which has already been debunked after president Donald Trump on
[3:30:19.900 --> 3:30:25.580]  Saturday accused his predecessor Barack Obama of illegally wiretapping phone
[3:30:25.580 --> 3:30:30.060]  calls at New York's Trump Tower mainstream media outlets began to list
[3:30:30.060 --> 3:30:35.940]  possible surveillance targets including Trump's so-called secret server to talk
[3:30:35.940 --> 3:30:40.980]  with the Russians and look who's spreading the fake news Hilary Clinton
[3:30:40.980 --> 3:30:45.780]  posted on Twitter that it's time for Trump to answer serious questions about
[3:30:45.780 --> 3:30:51.540]  his ties to Russia and she included a link to the original slate article that

[3:33:50.380 --> 3:33:58.340]  privileged to be alive at this time but as we have seen the mainstream media has
[3:33:58.340 --> 3:34:04.260]  grabbed the narrative of the government the LA Times this weekend insisting on
[3:34:04.260 --> 3:34:10.300]  page one that Donald Trump is wrong that there was no surveillance this is why
[3:34:10.300 --> 3:34:17.020]  info are wars is so important this is why this inexorable quest for truth and

[3:35:11.500 --> 3:35:16.940]  a guest I had on the Stone Cold Truth radio show this past weekend he is CIA
[3:35:16.940 --> 3:35:22.780]  whistleblower I'm gonna mispronounce your name here John Kirk I'll I guess it is
[3:35:22.780 --> 3:35:27.060]  who was very articulate and impressed me quite a bit on the show which is why
[3:35:27.060 --> 3:35:32.460]  asked him to be with us here today and of course what we want to talk about is
[3:35:32.460 --> 3:35:39.700]  vault 7 that's right folks the thanks to WikiLeaks once again the the deep
[3:35:39.700 --> 3:35:47.220]  states tactics and their ability to to manipulate is there for all Americans to
[3:35:47.220 --> 3:35:52.500]  save so welcome to info wars John thanks for joining us thank you Roger thanks
[3:35:52.500 --> 3:35:58.420]  for having me so I'll line for our listeners who in the bustle of their
[3:35:58.420 --> 3:36:06.100]  everyday responsibilities may not be fully aware of what vault 7 has exposed
[3:36:06.100 --> 3:36:12.100]  vault 7 really is a very dramatic revelation a very dramatic exposure of
[3:36:12.100 --> 3:36:20.700]  what the CIA has been up to between 2013 and 2016 that's Barack Obama's second
[3:36:20.700 --> 3:36:25.020]  term remember the most transparent president in American history well
[3:36:25.020 --> 3:36:29.900]  apparently the most transparent president American history had ordered the CIA to
[3:36:29.900 --> 3:36:38.540]  develop hacks into the iPhone into the Google Android phone into the Samsung
[3:36:38.540 --> 3:36:44.780]  smart TV and even into our cars computer systems now if you're an
[3:36:44.780 --> 3:36:48.820]  intelligence service and you're going after a hostile power that's all great
[3:36:48.820 --> 3:36:54.420]  if you're going after a terrorist group or you're trying to target the Iranians
[3:36:54.420 --> 3:36:59.620]  or the North Koreans that's great but what we don't know and what many of us
[3:36:59.620 --> 3:37:06.060]  suspect is that the CIA was using this technology or these technologies to
[3:37:06.060 --> 3:37:10.700]  target American citizens and for all we know they may have even used this
[3:37:10.700 --> 3:37:19.660]  technology to target then candidate Donald Trump it appears that way it
[3:37:19.660 --> 3:37:24.220]  really should not be any surprise that that your handheld device that your
[3:37:24.220 --> 3:37:29.460]  television set that so many of these electronic devices that we have in our
[3:37:29.460 --> 3:37:34.100]  homes and offices can be converted by the government to be listening devices
[3:37:34.100 --> 3:37:39.580]  on the advice of an intelligence professional almost two years ago when
[3:37:39.580 --> 3:37:45.540]  I'm having a particularly confidential conversation would say Alex Jones or
[3:37:45.540 --> 3:37:49.940]  someone else I will turn the phone off and actually place it in another room
[3:37:49.940 --> 3:37:56.340]  now some of my colleagues have told me that that's crazy that's paranoia no I
[3:37:56.340 --> 3:38:04.140]  think it's it's technological reality that's not good enough when I was at
[3:38:04.140 --> 3:38:12.060]  the CIA and I'm talking about 10 15 even 20 years ago when I was at the CIA it
[3:38:12.060 --> 3:38:17.020]  wasn't good enough to shut the phone off or put it into another room because the
[3:38:17.020 --> 3:38:21.540]  CIA can remotely activate the phone so that it looks like it's off but it's
[3:38:21.540 --> 3:38:27.060]  still functioning as a microphone so what we would do until the days when you
[3:38:27.060 --> 3:38:31.020]  could no longer take the battery out of a phone if you couldn't take the battery
[3:38:31.020 --> 3:38:36.260]  out you would put it in a freezer and close the freezer or refrigerator for
[3:38:36.260 --> 3:38:42.620]  that matter or leave the phone in your car because the CIA from anywhere in the
[3:38:42.620 --> 3:38:46.620]  world whether it's Langley Virginia or somewhere overseas they can activate
[3:38:46.620 --> 3:38:50.980]  that phone and activate the phone's camera and can record your whole
[3:38:50.980 --> 3:38:56.940]  conversation without you even realizing that the device is on it seems to me
[3:38:56.940 --> 3:39:03.580]  that we've had a a never-ending trail of the Central Intelligence Agency getting
[3:39:03.580 --> 3:39:08.380]  caught with misdeeds and lies being dragged before the Congress and swearing
[3:39:08.380 --> 3:39:13.300]  they're really sorry they'll never do it again then they go back to Langley and
[3:39:13.300 --> 3:39:19.820]  of course nothing ever ever changes I think the president would be wise to
[3:39:19.820 --> 3:39:24.620]  clean house at the CIA as soon as possible I was rather surprised that in
[3:39:24.620 --> 3:39:29.100]  the inaugural week he went out to Langley and kissed their dairy air I
[3:39:29.100 --> 3:39:35.540]  would not have done so but they are the enemy they are the tip of the spear for
[3:39:35.540 --> 3:39:40.340]  the globalists and frankly as they brought John Kennedy down as they
[3:39:40.340 --> 3:39:45.420]  undermined Richard Nixon they have every intention of undermining and dealing
[3:39:45.420 --> 3:39:52.100]  that just delegitimizing this president and keep in mind Roger that that this is
[3:39:52.100 --> 3:39:57.820]  still very much Barack Obama's CIA these people who who rose to the senior most
[3:39:57.820 --> 3:40:03.580]  levels of the CIA over the past eight years did so under President Barack
[3:40:03.580 --> 3:40:10.080]  Obama they served under John Brennan they served under David Petraeus they
[3:40:10.080 --> 3:40:21.460]  served under his name escapes me now the Obama's first CIA director so these
[3:40:21.460 --> 3:40:26.020]  guys that while their career intelligence officers they came of age under
[3:40:26.020 --> 3:40:31.340]  Barack Obama now Jimmy Carter who was one of the most wildly unpopular
[3:40:31.340 --> 3:40:37.500]  presidents inside the CIA was unpopular for a reason and it was because he
[3:40:37.500 --> 3:40:42.700]  cleaned house he got rid of a lot of the people who had been caught by the church
[3:40:42.700 --> 3:40:47.300]  committee committee assassinations and spying on Americans and doing all the
[3:40:47.300 --> 3:40:51.780]  things that the law of the land says the CIA should not be doing what he ended
[3:40:51.780 --> 3:40:56.980]  up doing was firing literally hundreds of senior operations officers in
[3:40:56.980 --> 3:41:01.540]  something called this the Friday Night Massacre people at the CIA still talk
[3:41:01.540 --> 3:41:06.020]  about the Friday Night Massacre the truth of the matter is every once in a
[3:41:06.020 --> 3:41:11.500]  while you need to carry out a massacre at the CIA because the organization becomes
[3:41:11.500 --> 3:41:16.700]  too politicized it becomes too polarizing and it ends up working
[3:41:16.700 --> 3:41:20.820]  against the interests of the president and the country and you have to clean
[3:41:20.820 --> 3:41:27.420]  house well as you'll recall after Jimmy Carter appointed Stingfield Turner the
[3:41:27.420 --> 3:41:34.260]  admiral as the head of the CIA most of those who were canned in the in the in
[3:41:34.260 --> 3:41:38.500]  the massacre could later be found over at the George Bush for president
[3:41:38.500 --> 3:41:42.940]  headquarters in Virginia and of course almost all of them would make their way
[3:41:42.940 --> 3:41:48.300]  back into the agency after president Ronald Reagan made the mistake of letting
[3:41:48.300 --> 3:41:53.420]  George Bush control the intelligence agencies essentially gave him the
[3:41:53.420 --> 3:42:00.740]  intelligence portfolio for the Reagan years the abuses at the CIA are legion
[3:42:00.740 --> 3:42:06.620]  no one ever seems to go to jail no one ever really gets fired as you know
[3:42:06.620 --> 3:42:14.820]  president John F Kennedy threatened to to what was it smash the agency into a
[3:42:14.820 --> 3:42:21.300]  thousand different pieces yes which I believe played a major role in his
[3:42:21.300 --> 3:42:27.860]  ultimate murder I think it is a factor based on the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban
[3:42:27.860 --> 3:42:34.620]  Missile Crisis in which the the CIA undermined Kennedy and if you read my
[3:42:34.620 --> 3:42:39.100]  book the man who killed Kennedy the case against LBJ I think I make a
[3:42:39.100 --> 3:42:45.580]  compelling case as did James Douglas in his book John F Kennedy and the
[3:42:45.580 --> 3:42:53.180]  unspeakable that the CIA is indeed complicit right there so the real
[3:42:53.180 --> 3:42:57.060]  question I'm gonna ask you the same thing I asked George Neymar from American
[3:42:57.060 --> 3:43:02.380]  spectator because as a CIA veteran you have I think a good perspective on these
[3:43:02.380 --> 3:43:07.780]  things where does this go from here do you think a congressional inquiry will
[3:43:07.780 --> 3:43:14.660]  will will help us get at the truth or will this become a political circus and
[3:43:14.660 --> 3:43:23.540]  should we have a judicial proceeding in which I think now that Jim pardon me now
[3:43:23.540 --> 3:43:28.660]  that Jeff Sessions the Attorney General has recused himself I think
[3:43:28.660 --> 3:43:33.660]  prematurely he still would have the authority to appoint a special prosecutor
[3:43:33.660 --> 3:43:40.180]  somebody of impeccable integrity with a pristine reputation in panel of
[3:43:40.180 --> 3:43:47.060]  grand jury and begin bringing the Obama security apparatus bosses in front of
[3:43:47.060 --> 3:43:51.380]  the grand jury one by one to find out what really happened here and that is
[3:43:51.380 --> 3:43:57.140]  exactly my position I don't trust Congress with this at all and I think
[3:43:57.140 --> 3:44:02.580]  it's because Congress has proven really since the middle 1980s to be a little
[3:44:02.580 --> 3:44:07.340]  more than cheerleaders for the CIA Diane Feinstein for example when she was the
[3:44:07.340 --> 3:44:12.460]  the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence did nothing to
[3:44:12.460 --> 3:44:17.420]  stop a CIA malfeasance in all the years that she headed that committee the same
[3:44:17.420 --> 3:44:22.660]  thing has happened under Republican leadership it seems that forever for
[3:44:22.660 --> 3:44:26.420]  whatever reason members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the
[3:44:26.420 --> 3:44:30.660]  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence see their jobs as that of
[3:44:30.660 --> 3:44:35.980]  just supporting CIA operations we don't need any outside bodies to be supporting
[3:44:35.980 --> 3:44:40.500]  CIA operations right now we need an organization that can find the truth
[3:44:40.500 --> 3:44:45.780]  that can get to the facts and determine what if any crimes were committed and I
[3:44:45.780 --> 3:44:51.020]  think the only way to do that is with a set a special prosecutor and paneling a
[3:44:51.020 --> 3:44:58.540]  grand jury I agree with you on that 100% well it certainly put so many in the
[3:44:58.540 --> 3:45:05.020]  intelligence network in a position where they could no longer dissemble for
[3:45:05.020 --> 3:45:12.900]  fear of a perjury charge if you look back through history it's only perjury
[3:45:12.900 --> 3:45:18.100]  charges and charges of contempt of Congress that have foiled CIA officers
[3:45:18.100 --> 3:45:22.660]  in the past if you go all the way back to the 70s it's those two charges that
[3:45:22.660 --> 3:45:28.780]  have wrapped people up you're absolutely right I'm thinking of the Defense
[3:45:28.780 --> 3:45:36.340]  Intelligence Director on James Clapper under Barack Obama as you know he
[3:45:36.340 --> 3:45:40.740]  already got caught lying to Congress about how much metadata was being kept
[3:45:40.740 --> 3:45:47.420]  on American citizens 26 senators co-signed a letter accusing him of
[3:45:47.420 --> 3:45:53.780]  perjury one senator demanded his resignation the House leadership of the
[3:45:53.780 --> 3:45:59.340]  Intelligence Committee was in open revolt over his lies why should we now
[3:45:59.340 --> 3:46:04.860]  suddenly believe mr. Clapper when he tries to make this all go away with an
[3:46:04.860 --> 3:46:12.020]  incredible double whammy of well we weren't surveilling the president and
[3:46:12.020 --> 3:46:16.700]  there is no evidence that the Trump campaign was in touch with the Russians
[3:46:16.700 --> 3:46:20.380]  this is an attempt to close the barn door after the horses have already
[3:46:20.380 --> 3:46:26.500]  escaped he has already made this mess that the ashes of Langley are going to
[3:46:26.500 --> 3:46:30.700]  come crashing down around his head and there's nothing now I think that they
[3:46:30.700 --> 3:46:37.060]  can do about it this is so right for both as Nixon's men being caught and being
[3:46:37.060 --> 3:46:42.940]  tied back to the Watergate breaking it is only a matter of time I say all the
[3:46:42.940 --> 3:46:49.620]  time that the CIA told us that they were not torturing prisoners there was no
[3:46:49.620 --> 3:46:54.300]  torture program that was a lie the CIA said that there was no secret prison
[3:46:54.300 --> 3:46:59.100]  system being run outside the US judiciary that was a lie the CIA said
[3:46:59.100 --> 3:47:03.220]  that they were not sending prisoners to third countries to undergo torture that
[3:47:03.220 --> 3:47:07.620]  was a lie the CIA said that it was the Russians that hacked the US election and
[3:47:07.620 --> 3:47:11.780]  practically installed Donald Trump absolutely zero evidence that any of
[3:47:11.780 --> 3:47:15.660]  that was true but now they want us to just take their word for it that they're
[3:47:15.660 --> 3:47:20.220]  not spying on Americans and that they weren't spying on Donald Trump well my
[3:47:20.220 --> 3:47:27.060]  view is every time a CIA leader opens his mouth he's lying so why in the world
[3:47:27.060 --> 3:47:31.540]  would we believe him now yeah put it another way how can you tell they're
[3:47:31.540 --> 3:47:38.340]  lying at the CIA their lips are moving now I think that you are you're exactly
[3:47:38.340 --> 3:47:44.740]  right and the president however needs to clean house you have an analogous
[3:47:44.740 --> 3:47:52.740]  situation at the FBI why he has allowed mr. Comey who covered up for the
[3:47:52.740 --> 3:47:58.780]  Clintons in the Sandy burger affair covered up for the Clintons in the the
[3:47:58.780 --> 3:48:05.580]  Mark rich affair covered up for the Clintons in their initial illegal
[3:48:05.580 --> 3:48:11.860]  server controversy where incredibly he slices and dices all of the things
[3:48:11.860 --> 3:48:15.980]  Hillary did in violation of the law and then announces that she won't be
[3:48:15.980 --> 3:48:22.420]  prosecuted that's right that in itself tells you that by election day when he
[3:48:22.420 --> 3:48:29.500]  first on Thursday said he was reopening the investigation based on 650,000
[3:48:29.500 --> 3:48:35.220]  additional new emails and then on Sunday night I believe it was as well folks we
[3:48:35.220 --> 3:48:41.780]  went through all 750 or 650 there's nothing there mr. Comey has worn out
[3:48:41.780 --> 3:48:47.420]  his credibility he has no more public credibility it is time for Donald Trump
[3:48:47.420 --> 3:48:53.140]  to make judge Janine Pirro the president the head of the FBI she was a
[3:48:53.140 --> 3:48:59.340]  distinguished prosecutor with a reputation for integrity and I guarantee
[3:48:59.340 --> 3:49:04.340]  you she's one tough lady someone I've known for she's I guess 30 years going
[3:49:04.340 --> 3:49:09.580]  back to her days as the Westchester County District Attorney she could clean
[3:49:09.580 --> 3:49:15.940]  up the agency of that I have no doubt and I also have no doubt that the American
[3:49:15.940 --> 3:49:20.740]  people would rally around the president if he initiated a change like that not
[3:49:20.740 --> 3:49:26.820]  just at FBI but also at CIA you know these these constant accusations and
[3:49:26.820 --> 3:49:31.940]  innuendos are exhausting not just for those of us here in Washington but for
[3:49:31.940 --> 3:49:36.860]  Americans all across the country the president can put that to rest and can
[3:49:36.860 --> 3:49:42.500]  really put his foot down by getting rid of these malcontents and starting fresh
[3:49:42.500 --> 3:49:48.540]  well the agencies have no credibility with the American people they have worn
[3:49:48.540 --> 3:49:54.660]  out their welcome I'm afraid however that that they will have a certain number
[3:49:54.660 --> 3:50:00.180]  of bureaucrats who have burrowed in to the to the structure there and that we
[3:50:00.180 --> 3:50:06.140]  will never get rid of them they are careerists that does not make them non
[3:50:06.140 --> 3:50:12.060]  neocons of course it doesn't mean that they are part of the problem but the
[3:50:12.060 --> 3:50:17.340]  president president Trump is inheriting a mess in both of the major
[3:50:17.340 --> 3:50:22.580]  intelligence agencies a mess in which the American people no longer believe
[3:50:22.580 --> 3:50:29.500]  anything coming out of the agencies when you consider all of the problems that he
[3:50:29.500 --> 3:50:34.980]  has to face and he is taking on again like the Republican Party what is a
[3:50:34.980 --> 3:50:40.540]  hostile takeover of the federal government so our prayers are with him I
[3:50:40.540 --> 3:50:45.940]  hope he will listen to this broadcast and clean house at Langley thank you so

[3:54:00.260 --> 3:54:09.260]  I was a highway man along the coach roads I did
[3:54:09.260 --> 3:54:15.100]  welcome back to info wars I'm Roger Stone putting in my service here for my
[3:54:15.100 --> 3:54:21.780]  friend Alex Jones very good news today out of the Trump administration in the
[3:54:21.780 --> 3:54:28.500]  nomination of Rick Grinnell who served at the UN as the public spokesman under
[3:54:28.500 --> 3:54:35.740]  President George W. Bush to be our NATO ambassador Grinnell was among those who
[3:54:35.740 --> 3:54:41.820]  was most effective as a surrogate for Donald Trump not after the convention but
[3:54:41.820 --> 3:54:47.980]  from the very beginning Grinnell is extremely knowledgeable despite his
[3:54:47.980 --> 3:54:55.300]  Bush Association Grinnell is a believer in American sovereignty in American
[3:54:55.300 --> 3:55:01.740]  power in American exceptionalism and he understands his role in NATO in
[3:55:01.740 --> 3:55:08.420]  thwarting the ambitions of the globalists so in a week in which sadly
[3:55:08.420 --> 3:55:14.500]  Anthony Scaramucci from Skybridge Capital who was marked as the man to be
[3:55:14.500 --> 3:55:22.980]  public liaison for the Trump White House was dumped for a Bush quisling which
[3:55:22.980 --> 3:55:27.620]  was a setback for those who believe in the Trump cause in the Trump agenda
[3:55:27.620 --> 3:55:33.300]  Trump comes back and doubles down in spades with the outstanding appointment
[3:55:33.300 --> 3:55:40.260]  of Rick Grinnell this is good news for every American who wants to ensure that
[3:55:40.260 --> 3:55:49.500]  the Trump administration stays loyal and true to the Donald J Trump agenda I
[3:55:49.500 --> 3:55:54.500]  would be remiss if I didn't remind you one more time to go to the info wars
[3:55:54.500 --> 3:55:59.900]  calm store there's a couple products that I have to speak about first of all
[3:55:59.900 --> 3:56:06.500]  there is the Hillary Clinton for prison t-shirt 2017 t-shirt which I predict will
[3:56:06.500 --> 3:56:12.380]  end up in the Smithsonian with the Hillary for prison 2016 t-shirt there's
[3:56:12.380 --> 3:56:20.700]  the Trump Pence 2012 20 t-shirt which I think is a political genius and the one
[3:56:20.700 --> 3:56:27.820]  I saw most of the inauguration Trump is my president so red t-shirt now these
[3:56:27.820 --> 3:56:34.820]  t-shirts play an important role in two ways yes by buying them you help to
[3:56:34.820 --> 3:56:40.500]  financially support info wars but in truth it's not the two or three dollars
[3:56:40.500 --> 3:56:45.380]  that info wars gets when you buy the shirt more importantly you become a
[3:56:45.380 --> 3:56:52.500]  walking billboard for your ideals you become a walking advertisement for our
[3:56:52.500 --> 3:56:57.220]  quest to beat back the globalists and restore American sovereignty and
[3:56:57.220 --> 3:57:02.260]  American greatness so not only should you buy these t-shirts or your family or
[3:57:02.260 --> 3:57:07.580]  yourself give them to your associates at work who are copacetic give it to your
[3:57:07.580 --> 3:57:16.980]  extended family this is how we break the mainstream blackout of real news this
[3:57:16.980 --> 3:57:22.940]  is how we use gorilla tactics some of the oldest tactics going back to PT
[3:57:22.940 --> 3:57:29.140]  Barnum if you will to recreate and repeat endlessly our arguments Trump
[3:57:29.140 --> 3:57:37.180]  Pence 2020 I think it's a great idea and frankly the rate that Trump is going he
[3:57:37.180 --> 3:57:42.780]  may solve most of our problems in his first term despite the fact that he has
[3:57:42.780 --> 3:57:47.740]  had a number of establishing republicans appointed to the White House staff
[3:57:47.740 --> 3:57:54.380]  and appointed to certain departments he has remained steadfastly true to the
[3:57:54.380 --> 3:58:00.020]  agenda he laid out for us in the last election now today comes news the
[3:58:00.020 --> 3:58:04.900]  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin cannot get the staff of Liberal Democrats and
[3:58:04.900 --> 3:58:11.580]  others that he wants to empower at Treasury approved by the White House if
[3:58:11.580 --> 3:58:16.660]  Ryan's previous is holding up some Treasury Department appointees because
[3:58:16.660 --> 3:58:21.620]  they are not republicans never my loyal well then for the first time my hat
[3:58:21.620 --> 3:58:31.100]  would be off to mr. previous personnel is policy and we cannot assume that down
[3:58:31.100 --> 3:58:36.220]  the road some of those hired will attempt to subvert the Trump agenda
[3:58:36.220 --> 3:58:45.420]  thanks for joining us here at info wars this is GCN the Genesis communications
