[00:00.000 --> 00:12.640]  We are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:12.640 --> 00:20.600]  Welcome to the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host in
[00:20.600 --> 00:26.640]  Austin Alex is on the road in California giving a presentation to a large health group out there
[00:26.640 --> 00:32.080]  this weekend we have a lot of breaking news and of course if you haven't seen it on info wars.com
[00:32.080 --> 00:38.160]  there is now a video showing troops doing exactly what they're proposing to do and Jade Helm doing
[00:38.160 --> 00:43.400]  it in Fort Lauderdale of course no one got any advance notification of this this is something as
[00:43.400 --> 00:49.600]  we have pointed out I'm going to play Joe Biggs's video at the end of the hour talking about how
[00:49.600 --> 00:55.320]  Fox News spun this they were spending it to tell people that we were maintaining that we had found
[00:55.320 --> 01:00.920]  some secret classified document no it was unclassified it was on a server it just wasn't being made
[01:00.920 --> 01:06.040]  public and so what we did was we once it was unscribed we made that public we pointed that
[01:06.040 --> 01:10.560]  out to people then they pretended that they didn't know what was in this document that
[01:10.560 --> 01:14.880]  they hadn't seen it that it wasn't theirs they basically just tried to ignore it until it went
[01:14.880 --> 01:19.960]  viral at that point they can't ignore it but we're going to show you footage of it I'll narrate this
[01:19.960 --> 01:22.800]  for those of you who are listening on the radio we're going to show you footage of what happened
[01:22.800 --> 01:26.520]  in Fort Lauderdale of course the people there didn't know this was coming that's one of the
[01:26.520 --> 01:31.280]  differences knowing that this is going to happen being prepared to take this kind of footage but
[01:31.280 --> 01:37.400]  of course with a lot with everyone having cell phones citizen journalists are getting some really
[01:37.400 --> 01:41.800]  really important information and this is very important for you to see if you haven't seen it
[01:41.800 --> 01:46.920]  and it's on info wars.com it's a top article right there from Paul Joseph Watson video shows
[01:46.920 --> 01:54.440]  troops training to intern citizens in Fort Lauderdale see this is snatch and grab snatch and grab of
[01:54.440 --> 01:59.200]  citizens they've got a lot of people that are being drug into confinement a whisked off in
[01:59.200 --> 02:06.800]  helicopters people being marched in single file by the military role players in civilian clothes
[02:06.800 --> 02:14.840]  and then herd it into white van vans and driven off this is the NDAA indefinite detention by the
[02:14.840 --> 02:21.600]  military rendition abroad or wherever to a torture site not having a trial just being held indefinitely
[02:21.600 --> 02:28.240]  this is training for what they put into the NDAA everyone should be concerned about this everyone
[02:28.240 --> 02:34.240]  conservatives liberals everyone now of course when you look at jade helm the political designations
[02:34.240 --> 02:39.160]  the colored designations that they have are very much red blue states as you've seen
[02:39.160 --> 02:46.240]  Democrat states Texas and and Utah or red states marked hostile they essentially are not
[02:46.240 --> 02:50.400]  friendly to the Obama administration you see the blue states there of course those are supposedly
[02:50.400 --> 02:58.680]  states like California Colorado Nevada that are in the Democrat column there those are friendly
[02:58.680 --> 03:02.920]  states so it follows these political designations that we've seen the even the colors that they
[03:02.920 --> 03:08.440]  use we need to understand that they have these scenarios they've had these scenarios for a very
[03:08.440 --> 03:12.880]  long time we have the article at info wars dot com Alex Jones Paul Joseph Watson put it together
[03:12.880 --> 03:19.400]  with lists of embedded videos as well as lists of links showing how this is something that has
[03:19.400 --> 03:25.840]  been progressing for a very long time and now you can see it happening in Fort Lauderdale stepping
[03:25.840 --> 03:29.680]  this up each time that they do it this is what they're training for very concerning we're also
[03:29.680 --> 03:35.240]  going to be talking in this program about the situation of the suicide pilot I believe as
[03:35.240 --> 03:39.760]  more and more information comes out they say that they found antidepressants in his home
[03:39.760 --> 03:49.480]  but no one will say that it is SSRIs I believe that it is the FAA excluded SSRIs from being
[03:49.480 --> 03:53.840]  banned from pilot use they cannot take any kind of antidepressant or mood altering drugs with
[03:53.840 --> 04:01.720]  the exceptions of SSRIs but we have seen linked over and over and over again to suicide murder
[04:01.720 --> 04:08.120]  cases many many situations besides any big shooting events we've also seen a lot of situations
[04:08.120 --> 04:14.760]  where a teenager has been put on SSRIs kills everyone in their family and has absolutely no
[04:14.760 --> 04:21.480]  empathy no emotion about it these are the symptoms of SSRI and when you look at what
[04:21.480 --> 04:26.480]  they're telling us from the black box recordings and when you look at the fact that the FAA has
[04:26.480 --> 04:33.280]  specifically excluded SSRIs from being banned it's a very telling story we're also going to be
[04:33.280 --> 04:39.960]  talking about the push to move the EU trade and euro currency to a sovereign state we've been telling
[04:39.960 --> 04:44.920]  you all along that these trade organizations are about changing sovereignty about world government
[04:44.920 --> 04:59.640]  and now they're admitting it in a big time about the EU stay with us we'll be right back using
[04:59.640 --> 05:04.800]  unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key
[05:04.800 --> 05:10.280]  concepts of super oxygenation the next level in cleansing is here with key ingredients backed
[05:10.280 --> 05:15.640]  by real clinical studies the new oxy powder available through info war's life was invented
[05:15.640 --> 05:20.760]  during doctor group's research on the toxification of our bodies many herbal colon cleansers are
[05:20.760 --> 05:26.560]  harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients oftentimes full of synthetic
[05:26.560 --> 05:32.600]  fillers GMOs additives or worse gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start
[05:32.600 --> 05:37.760]  working while you sleep oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste
[05:37.760 --> 05:44.040]  and concoctions instead oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and

[06:17.280 --> 06:24.440]  now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance it's Alex
[06:24.440 --> 06:36.600]  Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Sunday March 29th 2015 I'm David Knight your
[06:36.600 --> 06:42.800]  host today we have a lot of news especially about Jade Helm because what we've seen in Fort
[06:42.800 --> 06:47.000]  Lauderdale this is the top story on info wars.com right now video shows troops training to
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.680]  intern citizens in Fort Lauderdale we're going to show you this video we're also going to describe
[06:52.680 --> 06:57.720]  it for those of you who are listening on the radio a very disturbing video when you think about
[06:57.720 --> 07:03.800]  the implications think about what our government is training for this is the NDAA indefinite
[07:03.800 --> 07:10.520]  detention by the military rendition of people that are hostile to the government this is exactly
[07:10.520 --> 07:14.080]  what we've been concerned about with the NDAA we can see that they are training for it in the
[07:14.080 --> 07:19.720]  cities now how much how much do you need to see we've produced documents showing how they have been
[07:19.720 --> 07:25.920]  creating training scenarios for this creating military training facilities inside of military
[07:25.920 --> 07:31.200]  bases to train for this in America for a very long time and now we see this happening in
[07:31.200 --> 07:38.040]  Fort Lauderdale now of course the document was not made public about the training going on in
[07:38.040 --> 07:43.240]  Fort Lauderdale so people were just surprised to see that happening and that would be the way
[07:43.240 --> 07:50.160]  that it was it would be in Texas and Utah when Jade Helm begins if the document hadn't been made
[07:50.160 --> 07:54.640]  public that's what we're trying to get people to see we're trying to get people to see what they
[07:54.640 --> 07:58.920]  are training for who they perceive as their enemies according to their scenario according to
[07:58.920 --> 08:03.080]  their training and they train where they're going to fight and the way they're going to fight with
[08:03.080 --> 08:08.120]  people who look like their enemies what does it tell you when they are moving about the the
[08:08.120 --> 08:13.200]  whole purpose of this exercise they say is to be able to move about in America so that America
[08:13.200 --> 08:19.760]  Americans can't detect them do you see something wrong with that you should see something wrong
[08:19.760 --> 08:24.120]  with that so we're going to talk about the whole issue of what the mission of the military
[08:24.120 --> 08:27.800]  should be we need to have this discussion if we don't have this discussion pretty soon we're
[08:27.800 --> 08:32.520]  not going to be able to have that discussion or any other political discussion we've also got
[08:32.520 --> 08:38.720]  some other news we're going to cover it looks like the move towards a sovereign state in the
[08:38.720 --> 08:44.160]  EU is picking up speed we keep seeing this brought up time and again and of course we have said
[08:44.160 --> 08:47.920]  from the very beginning that when they create these trade blocks like NAFTA like the European
[08:47.920 --> 08:53.760]  Union the whole purpose of it is to create a sovereign entity and then to join those regional
[08:53.760 --> 08:59.960]  sovereign entities into a larger collective until they get to a one world government that has
[08:59.960 --> 09:05.240]  always been the objective we see now that David Petraeus mentioned just last year he said well
[09:05.240 --> 09:11.240]  what comes after North America and what comes after America North America and then he went on to
[09:11.240 --> 09:14.520]  say that he was talking about the North American Union he says we're 20 years into the North
[09:14.520 --> 09:17.960]  American Union so we need to take a look at this it was 10 years ago that the Council on
[09:17.960 --> 09:23.240]  Foreign Relations with Ted Cruz's wife as one of the members of this committee was talking about
[09:23.240 --> 09:29.160]  what they should do with the North American Union and their solution their key recommendation from
[09:29.160 --> 09:34.560]  the Council on Foreign Relations 10 years ago was to make sure that there was one common border
[09:34.560 --> 09:39.400]  around the three countries that they would have a common law enforcement that would presumably be
[09:39.400 --> 09:45.320]  run by the Homeland Security and the the guys in Washington this is something that has always been
[09:45.320 --> 09:53.280]  in the cards for everyone destroying the sovereignty of Mexico North of America and of Canada subsuming
[09:53.280 --> 09:57.360]  them into a North American Union doing the same in Europe and let's look at what's going on with
[09:57.360 --> 10:02.120]  this it was back in February and we've reported this as well when it happened Alan Greenspan former
[10:02.120 --> 10:06.800]  chair of the Federal Reserve said that he predicted that Greece would exit from the Euro he thought
[10:06.800 --> 10:12.120]  that it was inevitable that that would happen they say he goes on to say though he said the
[10:12.120 --> 10:20.160]  problem is that there is no way I can conceive of the Euro continuing unless and until all the
[10:20.160 --> 10:26.520]  members of the Eurozone become politically integrated actually even just physically
[10:26.520 --> 10:31.880]  integrated won't do it so in other words they tell us just as they told us about the North
[10:31.880 --> 10:37.160]  American Union they said this is about trade it's simply about trade there's nothing but trade we
[10:37.160 --> 10:42.640]  said it was to destroy the sovereignty of the three countries involved same thing when they
[10:42.640 --> 10:49.000]  came in with the EU and with the Euro they said this is simply an economic trading zone now
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.440]  they're saying that it's about political immigration it's not enough just to have fiscal
[10:54.440 --> 10:58.800]  integration it's not enough just to have a trade zone you can't really make that work unless you
[10:58.800 --> 11:04.680]  can have a government that subsumes the whole area and so now they're telling us that about
[11:04.680 --> 11:09.480]  North America about the North American Union now they're telling us that about the Euro now
[11:09.480 --> 11:15.240]  today we have an article that came out Eurozone can't survive in its current form says PIMCO now
[11:15.240 --> 11:21.920]  PIMCO is the Pacific Investment Management Company it is one of the largest well is the
[11:21.920 --> 11:28.720]  largest rather bond fund in the world and the manager of that bond fund said that the Eurozone
[11:28.720 --> 11:34.360]  is untenable in its current form and cannot survive unless countries are prepared to seed
[11:34.360 --> 11:42.360]  sovereignty and become a United States of Europe a United States of Europe so that's the next step
[11:42.360 --> 11:47.320]  okay now one more quote from that and I'll tell you where this is going the step after that because
[11:47.320 --> 11:52.400]  the reason they are showing us that the North American Union and the European Union were about
[11:52.400 --> 11:58.360]  sovereignty all along is because they're working on the next step before I leave this article he
[11:58.360 --> 12:04.080]  also has this to say he says will we get the United States of Europe that's not impossible but
[12:04.080 --> 12:09.800]  Europe could also spend many decades in a hybrid form of political and fiscal federalism while
[12:09.800 --> 12:16.320]  there might not be one government one passport and one army we could be moving closer to the
[12:16.320 --> 12:25.280]  closer to that but just not yet you understand one government one passport one army army for
[12:25.280 --> 12:32.640]  Europe see because that's the next step you can't have a sovereign state without an army and you
[12:32.640 --> 12:38.240]  can't feed that army without taxes so at every level of sovereignty they're going to have to
[12:38.240 --> 12:44.920]  have some kind of an army to keep the people in line and a way to get that army fed so why are
[12:44.920 --> 12:48.440]  they coming out at this point about the Eurozone why they're coming out about the North American
[12:48.440 --> 12:55.440]  Union it's because they are about to run through the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Trans-Atlantic
[12:55.440 --> 13:00.960]  Partnerships those are being sold to us as with they're always sold to us as simply a trade
[13:00.960 --> 13:05.240]  agreement the Trans-Pacific Partnership the Trans-Atlantic Partnership our trade agreements
[13:05.240 --> 13:10.640]  they're being negotiated in secret by corporate lobbyists and that's not an exaggeration that's
[13:10.640 --> 13:17.440]  not hyperbole it is no one but corporate lobbyists our elected representatives are not allowed to
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.840]  see it we are not allowed to see what's going on with it the only thing we know about it are some
[13:22.840 --> 13:28.800]  leaks from the WikiLeaks people other than that we know nothing about it but we do know from those
[13:28.800 --> 13:35.560]  leaks we do know that it is already far beyond a trade agreement it will affect many things within
[13:35.560 --> 13:42.600]  the countries immediately but the long-term goal is not just to destroy our to take control of the
[13:42.600 --> 13:47.400]  internet it's not just to force GMOs on people it's not just to help the big pharmaceutical
[13:47.400 --> 13:52.160]  companies those things are all in there of course and many people are concerned about that upset
[13:52.160 --> 13:58.440]  about that and rightfully so but the bigger picture where this is headed is a corporate
[13:58.440 --> 14:02.440]  governance of the world that's the next step that's why they're telling us what they have
[14:02.440 --> 14:07.000]  already done that telling us that hey we're now 20 years in the North American Union America is
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.600]  finished that's what Traias is saying okay Greenspan and the manager of the world's biggest bond
[14:13.600 --> 14:18.280]  fund are saying the eurozone is either going to break up or it's going to become the United
[14:18.280 --> 14:23.360]  States of Europe so they're saying that at the same time they're creating this transatlantic
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.480]  partnership and the trans-specific partnership so they're going to take these zones of North
[14:27.480 --> 14:32.080]  America and Europe and they're going to unify them with these quote-unquote trade agreements
[14:32.080 --> 14:36.760]  that are being done in secret and of course the biggest deal is that they're fast tracked that
[14:36.760 --> 14:43.080]  means that nobody is going to see this until about 24 hours before it has to be voted on no
[14:43.080 --> 14:47.360]  one will have time to actually look at the document in much detail and of course with fast
[14:47.360 --> 14:54.400]  tracked even if they don't like something the Senate there'll be no chance for anyone to change
[14:54.400 --> 14:58.120]  anything in the Senate or in the House they're not going to be able to make any changes it's
[14:58.120 --> 15:02.360]  going to be a take it all or leave it all and there's going to be so much pressure on them
[15:02.360 --> 15:08.800]  that they will take it all we see that happen over and over again now in another area we see
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.600]  that Newt Gingrich has come out and finally admitted that the GOP really doesn't want to
[15:13.600 --> 15:19.920]  repeal Obamacare he said this on Thursday he said it at a Washington DC health conference
[15:19.920 --> 15:26.120]  actually that was on Wednesday reported by USA Today on Thursday he said he doesn't think that
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.080]  Obamacare should be repealed and he says congressional Republicans who say they want to
[15:31.080 --> 15:38.320]  repeal it really don't want to repeal it either there you go they're finally some candid speech
[15:38.320 --> 15:44.320]  from someone he says you know he originally thought that Obamacare that mandates not just
[15:44.320 --> 15:49.160]  Obamacare but mandates by insurance was a little bit too authoritative a little bit too authoritarian
[15:49.160 --> 15:55.600]  I should say but now he's fine with that and he thinks that the Republicans are just lying
[15:55.600 --> 16:01.240]  to you we know they're lying to us they haven't done anything we'll be right back info wars life

[20:13.040 --> 20:19.520]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[20:19.520 --> 20:29.520]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host on this sunday march 29th 2015
[20:29.520 --> 20:35.360]  we're going to be talking about the exercises that were that took place in fort lauderdale we had
[20:35.360 --> 20:41.920]  some people who fortunately took video of this if you haven't seen it it is very chilling we're
[20:41.920 --> 20:48.480]  going to play that and describe that as well as put it in a context for you as well before I do
[20:48.480 --> 20:54.080]  that though i want to get to uh some other news it's up i think it's very disturbing to see that
[20:54.880 --> 21:02.480]  google suspended the adsense account of antiwar.com now why would they do that well they did it
[21:02.480 --> 21:09.200]  because antiwar.com published some pictures of the horrific torture that was going on at
[21:09.200 --> 21:13.520]  abu garab and i'm talking about when i say horrific torture i'm not talking about the
[21:13.520 --> 21:19.040]  humiliation that we were told about a few years ago i mean that would be sadistic but i'm talking
[21:19.040 --> 21:26.480]  about bringing in young children young boys and raping them in front of their mothers to the extent
[21:26.480 --> 21:33.120]  that their mothers were writing letters saying i just want to die that's what they were doing that's
[21:33.120 --> 21:41.520]  what our government our military was doing in our name antiwar.com posted those pictures they are
[21:41.520 --> 21:48.240]  very offensive pictures they're very violent pictures they're very disturbing pictures that's
[21:48.240 --> 21:52.480]  why they need to be posted because there's a political aspect to this that is not gratuitous
[21:52.480 --> 21:58.320]  pornography that they're putting up there but google adsense shut them down as they did
[21:58.320 --> 22:03.840]  mintpress and others for publishing these photographs and i have to say that that's a way
[22:03.840 --> 22:09.520]  of economically shutting these people down it's it's a very disturbing thing to see that kind of
[22:09.520 --> 22:15.680]  economic power concentrated in the hands of one corporation we know that they're using their truthiness
[22:15.680 --> 22:21.840]  rankings to essentially shut people down not based on how popular a particular article is because
[22:21.840 --> 22:25.840]  they don't want something to go viral they want to be able to control this so they're going to go
[22:25.840 --> 22:31.280]  into their knowledge fault they say and they're going to arbitrate as to what's correct and what
[22:31.280 --> 22:37.280]  isn't they're going to be the final arbiters of what's true along with the lady and her husband
[22:37.280 --> 22:42.800]  and her cat at snopes they're going to decide what's going to be allowed and they're going to rake
[22:42.800 --> 22:48.960]  things according to their truthfulness according to their knowledge fault that's another way to shut
[22:48.960 --> 22:53.520]  out the truth to make it disappear to flush it down the memory hole and of course to hurt people
[22:53.520 --> 22:59.440]  economically to take away their economic the way that they can can sustain their website the way
[22:59.440 --> 23:05.280]  they can just sustain their journalism it's one of the reasons why we have info wars life.com here
[23:05.280 --> 23:11.040]  and you know to have that kind of an income stream that is independent yes we do add sense
[23:11.920 --> 23:17.600]  but you have to have some way to keep yourself going whether it is donations from individuals
[23:17.600 --> 23:23.440]  and of course these sites do this as well there's also a campaign from antiwar.com
[23:23.440 --> 23:31.280]  hashtag don't expose evil it's a meme contest and if you look at that search that you will see
[23:31.280 --> 23:37.280]  they've got a whole line a cartoon line of people in orange jumpsuits with hoods over their heads
[23:37.280 --> 23:42.320]  with earmuffs so they can't see anything they can't hear anything total sensory deprivation
[23:43.280 --> 23:48.240]  kneeling and handcuffed and that's what it's come to with our government and we're going to show you
[23:48.240 --> 23:54.720]  how they're training to do that to a larger extent training to do that in America that's what the NDAA
[23:54.720 --> 24:00.400]  is about is training to do that in America they put it into the law they've left it there now
[24:00.400 --> 24:06.000]  several iterations of the national defense authorization act and so they have put it in
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.400]  there said we have to slip this in you have to pass this budget that funds the military of course
[24:10.400 --> 24:17.440]  we cannot not fund the military we can't even reduce its scope or size and so they have left
[24:17.440 --> 24:23.040]  this in now for several years Obama signed said he wasn't going to sign it and he signed it
[24:23.040 --> 24:28.000]  New Year's Eve and then when people called him on it he said don't worry I'm not going to enforce it
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.360]  that's right maybe it's for the next guy that follows him he'll be the one to enforce it who
[24:33.360 --> 24:37.280]  knows we should all be very concerned about that this isn't something that's just aimed at left
[24:37.280 --> 24:43.680]  wing it's not aimed just at the right wing this is a loaded gun this is Russian roulette with
[24:43.680 --> 24:48.560]  all the cylinders loaded and the question is which one of these presidents is going to pull the
[24:48.560 --> 24:52.560]  trigger that's why we need to shut this down and that's why we need to stop the kind of military
[24:52.560 --> 24:57.920]  exercises that happened last night in Fort Lauderdale as well as what's going to be happening
[24:57.920 --> 25:02.960]  later this summer with Operation Jade Helm before I go any further with the news I want to let you
[25:02.960 --> 25:09.280]  know that we've got a sale at info wars life dot com DNA force is now 30 off just to the end of this
[25:09.280 --> 25:14.320]  month just to the end of March just another couple of days that's a huge savings it's the first time
[25:14.320 --> 25:21.120]  it's been below a hundred dollars that we've had it on our site I think it's the savings of yeah over
[25:21.120 --> 25:29.040]  $40 you save on that off of the regular price a very important blend to give you mitochondrial
[25:29.040 --> 25:33.280]  health I was talking about the telomeres being a prediction of how long you're going to live
[25:33.280 --> 25:38.480]  it's been described as kind of the the tips the telomeres are kind of the tips on the end of a
[25:38.480 --> 25:43.840]  shoestring where the shoestring is your DNA and the telomeres is the little tip that protects
[25:43.840 --> 25:48.880]  that shoestring that keeps it from fraying and coming apart it's very important to keep that
[25:48.880 --> 25:53.040]  intact to keep it long and if you look at that on someone they found that it's a very
[25:53.840 --> 25:58.480]  good predictor of how long someone is going to live so what can you do to increase that
[25:58.480 --> 26:04.320]  mitochondrial health well there's been a lot of studies that show reservatrol as well as biopqq
[26:04.320 --> 26:11.520]  there's been 175 studies showing that biopqq helps mitochondrial health as well as reservatrol and
[26:11.520 --> 26:17.600]  we have a special form of reservatrol a trans reservatrol it's the active isomer that's in
[26:17.600 --> 26:24.400]  reservatrol so those are both in DNA force and that's the point is to keep your mitochondrial
[26:24.400 --> 26:30.480]  health up it's an anti-aging process to try to control the damage that is done to your DNA from
[26:30.480 --> 26:37.200]  toxins and there's been 175 studies that show that it can improve both the number and the function
[26:37.200 --> 26:42.480]  of your mitochondria as well as protect them from damage so that's available right now 30% off
[26:42.480 --> 26:46.560]  just to the end of the month first time it's been under $100 that supports our operation
[26:46.560 --> 26:55.040]  and it supports your health there's been a lot of talk about of course this horrific suicide of
[26:55.040 --> 27:00.880]  this pilot and the fact that he could fly this according to what they're telling us from the
[27:00.880 --> 27:07.280]  flight recorders that he could fly this into the mountain even though his copilot locked out of the
[27:07.840 --> 27:12.480]  cockpit is pounding on the door screaming trying to get in and even though they say they could hear
[27:12.480 --> 27:17.840]  the screams the passengers as just before impact just as they realized that this was not an approach
[27:17.840 --> 27:24.800]  to landing but that he was going to fly into the mountain nevertheless they say that his breathing and
[27:24.800 --> 27:31.040]  his pulse rate were unaffected his very coolly and calmly flying this into the mountainside and
[27:31.040 --> 27:37.200]  when I looked at that I guess I've kind of stuck on this for a while because to me it was something
[27:37.200 --> 27:43.520]  of a metaphor of what our own government is doing to us with these drills these exercises these
[27:43.520 --> 27:50.240]  training scenarios training to fight the American people but even beyond that the permanent multiplying
[27:50.240 --> 27:56.720]  wars that we have everywhere we have a government that not only has multiple undeclared wars going
[27:56.720 --> 28:00.400]  on they're looking to start more and of course they're even picking a fight with Russia trying to
[28:00.400 --> 28:04.800]  revive the Cold War they actually think they can win all of these things and pick a fight
[28:04.800 --> 28:12.880]  with the American people and win that one as well they must be on SSRIs they must be totally out of
[28:12.880 --> 28:21.360]  their mind suicidal I think that's what this Andreas Lugnitz was on as there's been a report
[28:21.360 --> 28:27.040]  surfacing that he was getting psychic psychiatric treatment that he was on antidepressants I started
[28:27.040 --> 28:34.240]  looking to see if they would name the drugs even if they would name the class of the drugs and I'm
[28:34.240 --> 28:38.240]  gonna tell you we're out of time for this segment I'm gonna tell you what I found out right after
[28:38.240 --> 28:45.680]  the break I think you'll be pretty amazed at what the FAA does with SSRIs stay with us we'll be right

[33:05.280 --> 33:27.600]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[33:27.600 --> 33:37.280]  welcome back to the alex jones show now just before the break and to talk about what i believe
[33:38.080 --> 33:43.760]  is an amazing revelation about the faa's attitude towards ssri's and of course we have
[33:43.760 --> 33:50.400]  pointed out many many times the common connection between people committing suicide many times
[33:50.400 --> 33:57.360]  preceded by the murder of their family or people in their immediate vicinity with absolutely no
[33:57.360 --> 34:02.640]  feeling whatsoever for anyone including themselves and that's apparently what we're seeing
[34:02.640 --> 34:07.920]  from this pilot now when i started looking for it i started looking to see if i could
[34:07.920 --> 34:13.280]  find a connection with ssri's and i found a couple of sites that actually did mention ssri's because
[34:13.280 --> 34:19.200]  they kept saying that he was depressed he was getting medication they would not name the medication
[34:19.200 --> 34:23.840]  they wouldn't even mention what class of medication it was just that it was medication for being
[34:23.840 --> 34:32.000]  depressed and of course we know that the medication of choice for that illness is to give people ssri's
[34:32.000 --> 34:37.440]  which if you read the insert says that it produces suicidal thoughts one of the things
[34:37.440 --> 34:43.520]  that they talk about especially is the discontinuation syndrome in other words when you stop it
[34:43.520 --> 34:47.360]  it gets much much worse so you you go to a psychiatrist you're you're depressed you're
[34:47.360 --> 34:52.720]  having suicidal thoughts he gives you a medication that exacerbates that and then when you realize
[34:52.720 --> 34:57.920]  that it's having really bad side effects in many other ways on you and there are a lot of side
[34:57.920 --> 35:02.400]  effects with these ssri's when you realize that it's got these other side effects and you want to
[35:02.400 --> 35:08.960]  get off of this drug you can't get off of it it's very dangerous to get off of it uh that's when
[35:08.960 --> 35:14.160]  it becomes even more dangerous than when you're taking it or when you weren't taking it so i'm
[35:14.160 --> 35:18.640]  looking for these ssri connections and i found a couple of articles one of them was voice of america
[35:18.640 --> 35:24.400]  you know the propaganda outlet from the american government that was prohibited in the united states
[35:24.400 --> 35:32.160]  was created to go after the russians and the eastern bloc after as the cold war began and it
[35:32.160 --> 35:35.680]  was banned from operating in the united states but they repealed that a couple of years ago because
[35:35.680 --> 35:40.080]  you know we have to be propagandized they're not winning the propaganda war the information
[35:40.080 --> 35:43.680]  where they admit they're losing it they admit that it's just mindless propaganda so they've
[35:43.680 --> 35:47.520]  they've brought that back well it was interesting that was one of the ones that turned up and
[35:47.520 --> 35:52.560]  mentioned ssri's as being the depressants and then when i went to look at the article that had been
[35:52.560 --> 35:57.520]  taken out i found another one that mentioned ssri's that had been taken out as well i screenshot the
[35:58.240 --> 36:05.520]  google uh searches but uh it's absolutely amazing but i did find this on the washington post
[36:06.240 --> 36:10.960]  they said commercial pilots of the united states are grounded by f a a regulations if they're taking
[36:10.960 --> 36:18.400]  certain prescription drugs including all sedatives all tranquilizers all anti psychotic drugs and
[36:18.400 --> 36:29.440]  all antidepressants except except for prozac zoloft selexa lexa pro the ssri's it pays to have
[36:29.440 --> 36:37.760]  friends in high places doesn't it and that was removed in 2010 so all antidepressants all sedatives
[36:37.760 --> 36:44.560]  all psychotic drugs all tranquilizers as you would expect would be banned for pilots but then
[36:44.560 --> 36:53.520]  they remove that just for ssri's the drugs that we know have these suicidal mass murder tendencies
[36:53.520 --> 36:58.560]  we have documented this over and over again you can go to multiple sites and get a long list
[36:58.560 --> 37:04.000]  we've uh run it at our site as well a long list of people that were involved with uh ssri's that
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.920]  went on killing sprees and it doesn't have to be a gun of course that's the way they always spend
[37:07.920 --> 37:11.120]  it they said well we got to get rid of the guns no you have to get rid of the source the thing
[37:11.120 --> 37:16.560]  that's making people suicidal and turning them into mass murders because they can kill people
[37:16.560 --> 37:22.000]  with airplanes as well they say a pilot must also be on a stable dose of those medications for at
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.000]  least six months prior to flying in other words that's the discontinuation syndrome now what did
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.880]  the f a a say so i looked at this a little bit closer the f a here's the actual ruling going back
[37:32.880 --> 37:41.360]  to april 2nd 2010 the f a says we approve ssri's for medical certification pilots taking certain
[37:41.360 --> 37:47.840]  types of common antidepressants may soon return to the air isn't that comforting the f a a announced
[37:47.840 --> 37:51.600]  that it will allow special issuance medical certification for pilots who take four common
[37:51.600 --> 37:58.400]  medications for certain types of depressive disorders beginning april 5th 2010 the agency
[37:58.400 --> 38:05.600]  will consider for all classes of medical certification the use of prozac zoloft selexa and lexa pro
[38:06.320 --> 38:12.160]  and they said this before deciding to allow the medications which are all ssri's the f a a conducted
[38:12.160 --> 38:18.720]  an extensive review of literature assessing the risks and the benefits of antidepressant usage
[38:18.720 --> 38:24.960]  what do you think they got that literature that's probably supplied to them by big pharma that sells
[38:24.960 --> 38:31.760]  the ssri's and funds the studies and writes the literature so there you go so now they're saying
[38:31.760 --> 38:37.920]  well you know they may face stricter psych evaluations fine but stop giving them ssri's
[38:39.040 --> 38:44.320]  that's key of course time magazine comes out and they say well we think the problem is privacy
[38:45.440 --> 38:50.960]  he didn't have to report that and the airline couldn't look at all the aspects of his own
[38:50.960 --> 38:56.560]  personal private life now that's not the answer that is not the answer giving up our privacy is
[38:56.560 --> 39:01.760]  always what's being pushed by the corporate media here in america but that is not the answer
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.760]  the answer is to stop ssri's the answer is not to ban privacy the answer is not to ban planes the
[39:07.760 --> 39:13.920]  answer is not to ban guns the answer is to ban the mass murder suicide pills that we call ssri's
[39:13.920 --> 39:19.280]  this is just another example of that now i've been talking about this drill that's going on
[39:19.280 --> 39:22.880]  in fort lauderdale we're going to go to that in just a moment but before we do i want you to think
[39:22.880 --> 39:27.360]  about the fact that this video that we've got here which i think is pretty disturbing when i
[39:27.360 --> 39:30.560]  looked at it disturbs me because i understand what's behind this i understand what they've
[39:30.560 --> 39:38.560]  been training for i've walked through fort ap hill where they were training in a very explicitly
[39:38.560 --> 39:46.480]  fully intact american city to do operations there that was a base within a base asymmetric warfare
[39:46.480 --> 39:53.120]  unconventional warfare is another part of it but of course we had citizen journalists who
[39:53.120 --> 39:57.280]  pulled this up and there's some clips uh for people who are watching this now that's so when
[39:57.280 --> 40:01.120]  we're walking over to the area that big said looked like the place where they were torturing
[40:01.120 --> 40:06.960]  people uh in iraq and of course that was connected with an underground uh tunnel that went across
[40:06.960 --> 40:10.880]  the street to the mosque there was an underground tunnel on both of those buildings looked like
[40:10.880 --> 40:15.040]  they were directly across from each other and then of course there's a church just to the right
[40:15.040 --> 40:22.000]  hand side the soccer field uh everything else about that was total small town america uh they
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.920]  they put the mosque up large and center so they could tell people this is for foreign countries
[40:25.920 --> 40:31.440]  for the as long as this looks listen just as madison said if tyranny ever comes to our land
[40:31.440 --> 40:37.680]  it will come in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy it is not about that if you that was we
[40:37.680 --> 40:45.040]  stood at the corner of first and main at fort ap hill in the asymmetric warfare center that is
[40:45.600 --> 40:49.760]  an american city that they're training to fight in but i want you to think about this there's
[40:49.760 --> 40:54.720]  been of course a constant back and forth about whether or not we have a right to film our government
[40:54.720 --> 41:00.640]  in public they maintain they have a right to not only film us in public but to look and examine
[41:00.640 --> 41:08.000]  us and collect data on us in private without a search warrant but we are not allowed to take pictures
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.560]  of our masters and so we see that there's a bill being introduced in the state of montana
[41:12.560 --> 41:18.320]  that would require a permit to film on private property providing penalties defining law enforcement
[41:18.320 --> 41:24.480]  of officers and requiring release waivers for certain persons but of course it is really the
[41:24.480 --> 41:30.240]  title is an act revising laws related to filming law enforcement officers during the conduct of
[41:30.240 --> 41:36.160]  official duties that's precisely when they should be filmed exactly when we're not interested in
[41:36.160 --> 41:40.240]  filming them as they go about their private life they should have a private life just as we should
[41:40.240 --> 41:45.600]  have a private life but the very government that doesn't want us including the officers to have any
[41:45.600 --> 41:50.880]  privacy at home also says that when they are on official duty they should not be filmed that's
[41:50.880 --> 41:56.160]  precisely when they should be filmed and so they have an idea they're going to give you a permit
[41:56.160 --> 42:01.120]  to film law enforcement activities with a lot of stipulations on it but listen to this part a law
[42:01.120 --> 42:07.600]  enforcement agency that allows a law enforcement officer to be accompanied and filmed retains
[42:07.600 --> 42:14.640]  full control over the content of any recording and must approve its use and any edited versions
[42:14.640 --> 42:20.720]  of the content before the content or edited content may be aired there you go they retain
[42:20.720 --> 42:26.800]  full editorial control even after the fact so if you film something that they don't like doesn't go
[42:26.800 --> 42:34.400]  up and say that's the problem with the body cameras on the officers they retain full editorial
[42:34.400 --> 42:40.400]  control that's a very dangerous thing stay with us right after we come back we're going to show you
[42:40.400 --> 42:46.400]  this video that happened and the training exercise that happened in Fort Lauderdale that was done
[42:46.400 --> 42:51.440]  without permission of law enforcement or the military like we had a free country but we won't
[42:51.440 --> 42:55.840]  have it for long if they keep doing these kinds of exercises and do them for real stay with us
[42:55.840 --> 43:04.720]  you're right use since before the days of the roman empire to support the body's natural systems

[47:18.480 --> 47:27.760]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[47:32.640 --> 47:37.200]  welcome back to the alex jones show on the sunday march 29th 2015 i'm david night your host
[47:37.840 --> 47:41.520]  we've been talking this entire hour about the article that's up on info wars dot com paul
[47:41.520 --> 47:46.880]  joseph watson put up a video shows troops training to intern citizens in fort lauderdale
[47:46.880 --> 47:52.560]  martial law style drill is caught on camera and he points out armed troops were arresting
[47:52.560 --> 47:56.000]  we're going to show you this video we're going to talk about this in just a moment arresting
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.920]  role players on the street before a column of prisoners are marched toward a mock internment
[48:01.920 --> 48:07.280]  facility you also see them being picked up and put into white vans and driven away some of them
[48:07.280 --> 48:11.680]  taken away by a helicopter apparently accompanied by very little media coverage they says that it
[48:11.680 --> 48:17.840]  would be uh they would be assisting uh members of the u.s special forces this is what they were
[48:17.840 --> 48:22.640]  told in when this began to happen this is what the media told them said that the uh that law
[48:22.640 --> 48:28.640]  enforcement is going to be assisting members of special forces who are undergoing urban warfare
[48:28.640 --> 48:34.160]  training and they had this in various locations the military did not disclose this beforehand
[48:34.160 --> 48:40.000]  and that's what's different about jade helm is that this unclassified document was hidden in plain
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.680]  sight but not viral people didn't know that was going on they typically only tell people as this
[48:45.680 --> 48:51.040]  is happening or the day before they say the goal is to prepare participants in realistic unfamiliar
[48:51.040 --> 48:57.680]  training conditions before they deploy for combat overseas look i don't even believe this is for
[48:57.680 --> 49:05.600]  combat overseas if so it has a dual purpose but as madison said if tyranny ever comes to this land
[49:05.600 --> 49:11.520]  it will come in the form of fighting a foreign enemy that's the way this is being brought to us so
[49:11.520 --> 49:17.600]  let's go and take a look at this because to me this is obviously training for the kinds of stuff
[49:17.600 --> 49:21.840]  we've been concerned about since indefinite detention by the military and rendition were
[49:21.840 --> 49:26.480]  passed as part of the ndaa we've been saying that this is precisely what would happen and now
[49:26.480 --> 49:32.320]  they're acting it out for us on our streets with the help of law enforcement because you know of
[49:32.320 --> 49:37.200]  course in foreign countries they're going to have when they do this in iran uh they're going to have
[49:37.200 --> 49:42.880]  the cooperation of the iranian police right no they're not no they're not uh this is for
[49:42.880 --> 49:48.400]  use in america folks and you can see this let's run this clip here and as we're running this clip
[49:48.400 --> 49:54.720]  i want to play for you what they were telling the brazos county officials about jade helm
[49:54.720 --> 49:58.560]  for those of you who can't see this is a black helicopter coming in these black hot helicopters
[49:58.560 --> 50:05.120]  no one will be staying in brazos county they'll be coming in doing the hit and extract
[50:05.760 --> 50:12.080]  uh time and do the hit the extract maybe 15 to 20 minutes of exposure then that's it
[50:13.120 --> 50:18.400]  can we recommend some places to you to hit you know every county that we have briefed has
[50:18.400 --> 50:23.680]  has done that for us also now what we're looking at there we just saw somebody on the ground
[50:23.680 --> 50:27.600]  soldiers surrounding him you're going to see that person getting a drug off or somebody else
[50:27.600 --> 50:33.760]  being drug off in just a moment more helicopters landing and taking off this is a very dangerous
[50:33.760 --> 50:40.000]  thing to be operating helicopters at this level in a major city uh i don't know if you can get i
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.800]  don't think you can get f a permission to do that normally now this what we're looking at on the uh
[50:44.800 --> 50:51.040]  video right now is a line of people being marched across a civilian american street
[50:51.040 --> 50:55.680]  accompanied by the military unconventional warfare into a perspective you see it a couple
[50:55.680 --> 51:01.040]  different places up there unconventional warfare and i'll explain that from a historical perspective
[51:01.040 --> 51:05.200]  again this is a presentation in the brazos county of jay hill which are listening to troops on troops
[51:05.200 --> 51:11.840]  tanks on tanks uniform enemy against uniform enemy is the way conventional warfare is generally
[51:11.840 --> 51:18.960]  defined unconventional warfare from a historical perspective if you think of world war two germany
[51:18.960 --> 51:24.400]  came in and they took over france the french did not want them there they formed the french
[51:24.400 --> 51:30.960]  underground the french underground conducted activities such as subversion and sabotage
[51:30.960 --> 51:36.560]  they would hit logistics lines yeah so think about to to them not the occupation of france
[51:36.560 --> 51:40.400]  okay we're playing the part of the nazis that's what the american government is doing right now
[51:40.400 --> 51:49.360]  go ahead keep playing that moralize the the um germans so what a lot of folks don't know is
[51:49.360 --> 51:55.200]  there were american advisors with the french underground throughout world war two assisting
[51:55.200 --> 52:00.000]  them in planning and conducting those types of activities now if you're watching this video
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.240]  right now you see civilians being loaded in the united states army special forces has had the
[52:04.240 --> 52:08.560]  charters conduct unconventional warfare throughout driving them off in the white bands to the
[52:08.560 --> 52:14.000]  internment last 15 years we have been in afghanistan and iraq we've been doing more of a counter
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.280]  insurgency now hold it right there yeah that's it they're now counter insurgency because you see
[52:19.280 --> 52:23.040]  they go in and invade a country and the people fight back against it like the french did against
[52:23.040 --> 52:28.880]  the germans the the french resistance was an insurgency they call it and then of course the
[52:28.880 --> 52:34.480]  germans would do what the nazis did and they call that counter insurgency that's where we've been
[52:34.480 --> 52:40.320]  hanging out for the last several decades on the german side of the equation let me explain to you
[52:40.320 --> 52:44.240]  when they go into these county commissioners they tell them this is about unconventional warfare
[52:44.240 --> 52:48.640]  they don't define what unconventional warfare is that much in detail you can go to wikipedia and
[52:48.640 --> 52:53.200]  you can see the quotes taken from the military documents as i mentioned on friday unconventional
[52:53.200 --> 52:59.120]  warfare is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence through capitulation through
[52:59.120 --> 53:06.320]  clandestine support for one side and a conflict it's a psi op what they're trying to do is they're
[53:06.320 --> 53:10.800]  trying to get the american people to acquiesce to the military operating in their midst to understand
[53:10.800 --> 53:18.240]  that or to feel as if these people are so powerful they cannot be opposed we cannot acquiesce to this
[53:18.240 --> 53:23.440]  it's unconventional warfare targets a civilian population psychologically to win hearts and minds
[53:24.160 --> 53:28.960]  it only targets military and political bodies directly seeking to render the military proficiency
[53:28.960 --> 53:35.280]  of the enemy to be irrelevant say this is all about training and they go on to say training
[53:35.280 --> 53:41.280]  equipping and advising locals who will seek regime change what kind of regime change are
[53:41.280 --> 53:48.000]  we looking for here in america well they have been doing a lot to change the way america operates
[53:48.800 --> 53:52.560]  we've documented that over the last several years it didn't start with obama unfortunately
[53:52.560 --> 53:59.440]  it's been going on getting progressively and exponentially worse with each president we look
[53:59.440 --> 54:05.760]  at posse comitatus and the posse comitatus like let's let's first go back to posse comitatus what is
[54:05.760 --> 54:12.400]  that let's understand the background the history of this posse comitatus in the latin means power
[54:12.400 --> 54:17.680]  of the community they shortened it to a posse you've all heard of the western posse the idea being
[54:17.680 --> 54:23.600]  that you did not have in america until the latter part of the 20th century you did not have a permanent
[54:23.600 --> 54:29.680]  standing army of policemen in uniforms with guns know what you had was a sheriff maybe a couple
[54:29.680 --> 54:34.720]  of deputies if there was something major that had happened if there was a riot if there was a bank
[54:34.720 --> 54:38.720]  robbery the sheriff would come around he would get the members of the community who were armed
[54:38.720 --> 54:43.840]  because they were not slaves they had the means the ability the right to protect themselves
[54:44.400 --> 54:48.800]  so they had arms they would be collected by the sheriff and they would put together a posse to
[54:48.800 --> 54:54.800]  take care of that bank robber or to put down that riot so it was the power of the community posse
[54:54.800 --> 55:00.480]  comitatus and of course you know as i said they shortened it essentially to posse you know you
[55:00.480 --> 55:06.080]  don't want to hear um john wane talking about posse comitatus it sounds too pedantic you know
[55:06.080 --> 55:10.800]  it's like let's get the posse let's go get these guys so that's what they did it was essentially
[55:10.800 --> 55:17.040]  like the militia as opposed to a permanent professional standing army because they understood
[55:17.040 --> 55:23.600]  that you don't want to be under professional military people you don't want to be under a police
[55:23.600 --> 55:29.440]  state and so what you have is the community with power not a few people who are in law enforcement
[55:29.440 --> 55:36.240]  and look at what we have today we have we have police we have sheriffs we have highway patrol
[55:36.240 --> 55:41.840]  everywhere you are you've got three levels of people in uniforms with guns standing there to
[55:41.840 --> 55:49.200]  harass you like highway robbers that's what it's about look at what happened in new york when
[55:49.200 --> 55:54.720]  they shut things down because they got angry with the mayor who didn't stand with them when they choked
[55:54.720 --> 56:02.320]  eric garner to death over an unpaid cigarette tax they said fine you're not going to stand behind
[56:02.320 --> 56:07.360]  us you're going to throw us in the bus under the bus when we enforce your petty rules and regulations
[56:07.360 --> 56:12.160]  based on getting revenue then we're not going to do that we're not going to collect that for you
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.800]  we're not going to write tickets or arrest people unless it is absolutely necessary you know what
[56:16.800 --> 56:24.320]  95 drop in arrests and tickets because 95 percent probably much more but at least 95 percent they
[56:24.320 --> 56:31.680]  admitted was unnecessary of what they did and actually crime went down see when people look
[56:31.680 --> 56:36.640]  at this and you say we shouldn't we should have the power in the community we should have a militia
[56:36.640 --> 56:42.640]  instead of a permanent standing army we should have a posse that is called together by a sheriff
[56:42.640 --> 56:48.800]  instead of having a massive police force that oppresses the people harasses the people eats out
[56:48.800 --> 56:53.760]  their substance as the founders of this country put in the declaration of independence independence
[56:54.400 --> 56:59.440]  we need to understand what's going on with that we need to take back that power we need to question
[56:59.440 --> 57:05.120]  the role of these men with arms that we've put in to rule over us like overseers on a plantation
[57:05.120 --> 57:10.560]  just because you're operating in the house of the plantation doesn't mean you got a good deal
[57:10.560 --> 57:15.360]  or you're safe you understand that the people who are doing hard time out in the field they
[57:15.360 --> 57:19.440]  understood that it want to be slaves but a lot of the people who are working in the house they
[57:19.440 --> 57:24.720]  kind of like that deal but it's not a good thing you have to want your freedom and the way you're
[57:24.720 --> 57:31.200]  going to get it is to get rid of these permanent police state operations to get rid of the standing
[57:31.200 --> 57:36.160]  military we need to have that discussion but of course we can't nothing can be done to reduce
[57:36.160 --> 57:40.400]  the defense budget not even our most libertarian candidates will cut the defense budget stay with
[57:40.400 --> 57:42.800]  us we're going to be right back and talk about more of this background

[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:08.160]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:15.120]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:22.400]  welcome back to the alex jones show now i want to continue on this idea posse comatatus a little
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:28.960]  bit longer we're going to play report from joe biggs talking about how fox news spun our reporting
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.840]  of this uh in the next segment but in this segment i want to continue on this posse comatatus because
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:40.000]  it is all connected the whole idea that you're going to have uh that we're endangered by a standing
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.040]  army understand that when madison and the other founders of this country created the constitution
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.840]  they did not envision a permanent standing army what they envisioned was an officer corps of the
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.880]  army and a permanent navy or so they didn't have an air force at that time the air force could also
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:02.160]  be permanent but they did not envision a permanent standing military they knew that historically
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.920]  that had always been used to oppress the people they explicitly talked about the roman empire
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.840]  so the roman empire you don't need to have an army unless you're going to project power like an
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.480]  empire unless you're going to invade other countries if you're going to defend invaders if
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:22.560]  you're going to be like switzerland for example what you're best served by is an armed citizenry
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.480]  switzerland was the only country that was not invaded why because they followed the model
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:34.960]  that the american founders set up we did not follow that model we don't follow that model anymore
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.200]  but we used to we used to have a militia that would respond to invasion and defend their land
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.320]  but they're not going to get the swiss people to go abroad uh and and take over other countries and
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.520]  that's why they create an army and of course if you go back to world war two my family is watching
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:56.320]  a series that we'd never seen uh when it first came out band of brothers i know most people have
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.160]  seen it by now we didn't we don't watch that much television so we're going through and looking at
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.640]  world war two and you know that the people there they were adamant that they wanted to sign up they
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.360]  saw their country as having been attacked they wanted to defend it that was the mindset of the
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:17.280]  people and so you had a massive citizen army under a core of of officers that were there that were
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:23.520]  permanent they realized with vietnam that they could not rely on a draft or the citizens to
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:29.200]  fulfill their vision of empire and so they went to a professional army now the problem is is that
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.800]  with a professional army you have people who are going to be far more susceptible to political
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.320]  considerations who are going to be looking at their career and they're not going to be coming
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.920]  at it from the standpoint of just merely protecting their country and we could look at this and we
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:51.600]  could say well you know this whole idea of uh not having massive police forces just having a very
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.480]  very tiny police force that calls upon the community if there's something major that they need assistance
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:03.120]  for as we saw in america and the west the posse to say that we could go with that or to say that
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:09.920]  we could go with a militia that would be called up under an officer corps people will say well
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.960]  that's an anachronism we can't really have that anymore because that's just we don't we have
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.760]  it's a different world it's a modern world nobody said to the founders at the time they
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:24.560]  were talking about the dangers of a standing army nobody said to them well you know yeah that happened
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.480]  with the roman people but you know today we've we've got uh we've got muskets you know this is
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:36.480]  this is much more dangerous than it was uh at the time of the roman empire look the technology
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.640]  changes but human nature does not change that's why their understanding of human nature their
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.600]  understanding of history their understanding of how people behave when they get power that was
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.600]  why they set up a system of checks and balances and one of those checks and balances was not to
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:55.360]  have a permanent standing army and we're seeing those kinds of abuses as we look at these exercises
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:02.000]  that are being done within america to take away civilians you gotta ask yourself when they want
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.280]  to move around when their stated purpose is to move around in american cities with operation
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.760]  jade helm or jade helm exercise i guess they call it when their stated objective is to move
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.600]  around in america and not be detected by americans do you see a problem with that i see a big problem
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.480]  with that i don't think that's a legitimate thing for our government to be doing and as we're looking
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.280]  at this uh film footage from fort lauderdale where they did their unannounced uh exercise last night
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:33.520]  we see people being herded up into white vans and driven off is that what we want in our country
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.880]  i don't want that in our country we need to understand that when the technology changes
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:45.200]  it only makes people uh it only exacerbates the evil human nature the evil aspects of power
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.400]  we need to understand that with darpa's powerful technology they are concentrating power into
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.560]  the hands of a few people that's what's so dangerous about these special forces operations stay with

[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:14.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show and today we've been talking about this drill and fort
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:18.480]  waterdale of course the last week we've been talking about operation jade helm with the jade
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:25.600]  helm exercise the unclassified document that went viral when we reported on it talking about a
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:31.280]  massive military exercise over a couple of months it's going to be taking place in the southwest
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:36.960]  with texas and utah being marked as hostile marked as red and of course the friendly states are
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:42.400]  marked in blue isn't that interesting places like you know california and colorado states that are
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:49.920]  in the democrat column and of course we have seen over the last several years a lot of military
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:54.400]  drills inside urban cities and that's something we should all be very concerned about typically
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.720]  they're not announced just as this one that we were showing in the last hour in fort waterdale
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:03.440]  was not announced and if you haven't seen this go back and take a look at the video the news
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.520]  article is on info wars dot com video shows troops training to intern citizens in fort
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:13.840]  waterdale a very disturbing video to me because i've seen them training for this on multiple
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:19.520]  occasions i've seen the scenarios i understand what this is this is a psi op against the american
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:27.120]  people but they're also training for martial law in the united states you know we have to be concerned
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:33.600]  especially when we see the special forces practicing flying into an area grabbing some people
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:38.640]  and flying out in 15 minutes or when they've got civilians being marched around as role players
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:44.000]  inside a city and then being loaded up into buses how many times are they going to do that and people
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.680]  will get used to seeing that and then when they do it for real they don't realize it's for real
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:56.640]  because we have the ndaa they can detain people indefinitely the military can without due process
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.560]  and of course transport them somewhere else where they can be tortured we all know that that happens
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.480]  with our government and so we should be very concerned about this and i when i was looking at
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:13.600]  the comments on the daily mail which did a balanced report of this uh these are some of the comments
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.520]  one of the person said the us military wants to know if american soldiers can remain undetected
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:23.520]  while operating among other americans what's wrong with this explanation yeah there is something
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:29.760]  very wrong with that when the american government is operating on it we have special forces who are
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:36.000]  operating in unconventional warfare which they admit is a psychological operation as we broke this
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.440]  joe bigs got a email from a friend of his that he had fought with in afghanistan or iraq that said
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.720]  shut up you're going to ruin the scyop it is a scyop that's what unconventional warfare is
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:53.280]  they're trying to train equip and advise low locals who are going to be with them on regime change
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.760]  that's what's wrong with this whole thing a lot of people say well you know we need the military and
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.560]  and uh we need to have protection of our borders because we've got these dangerous uh drug cartels
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:07.520]  and a hundred thousand people being killed in mexico over the drug wars that we helped to create
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:13.360]  with our drug prohibition uh issues but of course these dangerous drug cartels could come in and
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.720]  start doing that in the united states so we need to have the military trained for that that is not
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.960]  what they're training for when they go in as you can see in this video they are training for
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:26.320]  extraction of people they're training to get people on the red list people on the blue list
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.600]  you should be very concerned about the fact and i was mentioning the standing army they understand
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.560]  that if they've got a large army they're going to be people who are not happy with what they're
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.920]  doing people whose loyalty doesn't lie to the institution but lies to their country people
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.200]  whose loyalty is to their homeland not to the government necessarily and when the government
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.000]  comes after people in their homeland unjustified they will stand back they won't do that that's
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.880]  why it's it's dangerous i don't want to see people conscripted into the army but i'm saying is that
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.840]  that's one of the reasons why they go to a permanent professional army is so they get people
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.840]  that they can put a different level a different kind of pressure on and of course that army
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:11.920]  continues to shrink down donald rumsfeld wanted a smaller army when they went to uh afghanistan
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.320]  and iraq they wanted to use special forces with high-tech weapons it wasn't very effective they
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.320]  eventually did the troop search but that's the goal and let me tell you if you look at these
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:25.600]  nightmare weapons that darpa is creating many of which you don't know about some of them they let
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.240]  us know about but they're far beyond that there's a lot of secret stuff that they have uh that you
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:37.600]  don't know anything about when you combine that with special forces it is truly truly an awesome
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.280]  military and something that is totally out of our control this is a black ops military that's
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:49.760]  being created these are the boots on the ground for the cia and the nsa for the secret surveillance
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.880]  state where we can't know anything that they're doing that's the way these people operate we
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:00.560]  should be very afraid of a government like that let's play this clip from uh it was about two
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:07.920]  years ago i think when uh 2013 we did this report uh let's play this where they're talking in la
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:14.800]  about why they trained in urban areas special military operation forces in conjunction with
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:20.880]  the la pd conducting some military maneuvers that had many people wondering what is going on
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:27.120]  when a black Hawk helicopter and four oh h6's or little birds flew over the city duran says the
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.920]  military picks environments based on what they might be facing in the near future if it's a
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.680]  mountainous terrain that you go to mountains if it's a desert terrain they use a desert also what
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:42.320]  we saw here tonight uh in downtown los angeles has been seen in miami and in boston's yeah that's
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:46.400]  right you know what he said let's hold it right there you heard what the guy from the military
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.080]  said we're going to train to uh fight and we're going to train to fight in the mountains if we're
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.200]  going to be fighting in the mountains or in the desert we're going to train in the desert so they're
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.000]  fighting not just an urban environment they're fighting in an american urban environment that's
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.920]  a very important distinction to understand there and when they push back on this what they originally
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:09.200]  came back and said their uh denials were well i don't really know what info wars is talking about
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:14.000]  they wouldn't talk about us by name because they didn't want people go to our site to see
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.960]  the evidence that we had they don't want people to come to our site to see that these scenarios
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.720]  have been developing over many years to see the multiple clips the multiple links to their own
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.800]  documents that show what they're training for so they don't mention our name just like fox news
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:34.560]  doesn't mention our name but it's out there they understand they're losing the information war because
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.120]  drudge will link to uh these types of things and one of the things that they were talking about
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.080]  about a year ago remember there was that uh meeting that they had in the pentagon they said why are
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.800]  we losing the information war here's what one lady got up and said there i don't think the american
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:55.360]  people actually trust us to deliver accurate information how are we what's the plan to change
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:01.120]  that in the way ahead because to continue the way we have to continue to put that positive spin
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.800]  it feels like we're losing a lot of our audience because they're not listening
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.280]  because we keep saying the same thing over everything is okay this is that the military
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:14.000]  at the pentagon sexual assault issues that we've been experiencing in the air force so how do we
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.400]  change that culture from that pao up because a lot of times the speaking from my perspective and i
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:26.800]  can only speak from my perspective and a junior enlisted perspective the younger generations
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:32.400]  get it that we have to start being honest and forthright and it's difficult to convey those
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:39.440]  ideas and convince the chain of command to necessarily follow those or to be ready to put
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:44.400]  that first foot forward before someone else leaks our story you can see the pentagon guy just getting
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:49.360]  a really bad case of heartbreak keep playing this as it is a lot of people from what i can see
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:55.200]  are going through with the we're putting out mindless propaganda is what some of us feel that
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.280]  we're putting out and that with the american people feel that we're putting out so how do we
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.480]  change this thank you for a very good question and thank you for your recent service that's a
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.160]  good question of course he spends it from this point you know you can see this guy just getting a
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.640]  bad case of heartburn go ahead and cut that down and of course they do spend it and as i mentioned
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:17.920]  they spent spun it by saying well um that side is blocked of course they're the ones who blocked it
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.680]  but of course people could still go described and they could still see the jade helm exercise
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:28.640]  document that we were talking about there but he didn't want to he wanted to pretend that it
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:34.400]  didn't exist pretend that he had absolutely no knowledge of it that's the kind of unbelievable
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.400]  mindless propaganda that we continue to see coming out of all levels of the government but
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.520]  especially the military when it comes to these types of exercises stay with us when we come back
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:50.240]  we're going to play joe biggs taking apart the way that fox news propagandizes the public in this

[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show on day to night we've been talking about the
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.080]  drill that happened in fort lauderdale yet another drill
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:51.680]  extracting people just as we see as i said before it's really kind of a
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:59.600]  uh acting out of the ndaa indefinite attention by the military and being renditioned out of an
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.960]  area and of course that's part of what's going on with this jade helm exercise they're going to
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:08.880]  fly in extract people and leave about 15 minutes they said in brazos county i don't know what they're
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:13.120]  going to do in other areas but of course and that was exposed people didn't know this was
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:17.360]  happening going to happen in fort lauderdale nevertheless citizen journalists got that and
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:23.280]  as we pointed out in the last hour it's very important that we maintain our rights to film
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:28.960]  our government when they're acting in official capacity especially when they're operating in
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.280]  areas that are questionable as to whether or not we want them doing that or we have the police
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.160]  involved in breaking the law we're involved in police brutality but of course in montana they
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:43.200]  want to have you get a permit to film the police that's a new bill that they've put there and
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.160]  even if you get permission from them to film them they still will maintain that they have
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.160]  editorial control over anything that you film before you can post it that is absolutely outrageous
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:22:00.640]  and of course we got a video that uh shows not only that they're that they're doing that and
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:05.120]  in fort lauderdale but we also got an article that says that the police have a new policy in
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:10.000]  topeka kansas that everyone's going to be treated as a criminal when the police encounter you you're
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.640]  going to have to put your hands up kind of taking the hands up don't shoot to a literal
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:20.320]  extension there so we see that happening as i pointed out we need to question
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:25.840]  how we want to set our government up this government i believe is totally out of control
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:31.600]  the police and hopefully this won't happen but the potential when we see with these scenarios
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:37.520]  and this training the potential for the military to become predators is also there we see that
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:42.640]  that is the training scenario that they have going against political opponents using the
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:47.120]  military in that way and we know that historically has always happened so they're pushing back on
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:53.040]  this they're saying well we can't see the documents and of course um uh you're this wouldn't be
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:57.920]  against posse combatatus because we're merely training so forth and so on also saying that we
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:02.240]  are predicting that this is going to be martial law that is not what we were saying whatsoever
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:08.800]  or joe bigs had a report analyzing the way fox news was spinning the information and lying about
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:15.600]  what was being said go ahead i'm staff sergeant joe bigs us army retired veteran of both iraq
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:22.080]  and afghanistan now i'm here today to dismantle the lies propaganda and just blatant bs put out
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:28.080]  by the mainstream media the pentagon all these different sources are just clearly lying about
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:34.800]  this operation jade helm one five now first off i want to talk about the army times now in the army
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:40.880]  times it says that joe bigs is cited as a veteran of afghanistan and iraq and said that exercises
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:47.760]  would prepare troops to throw citizens in fema camps um i'm cited as a us army veteran hello
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:52.960]  you guys have written about me before you can actually go google my name with army times and
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.200]  pull up an article that you yourself did hello you might want to go fact check yourself before
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:01.440]  you wreck yourself you guys are supposed to have our backs i'm a veteran i actually have a purple
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:06.080]  heart do you know what that is you obviously don't know what a veteran is this is a purple heart so
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.880]  now we're going to talk about the biz pack review article it says that that we call this basically
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:16.400]  a secret document that proved to be bogus but it hasn't slowed down the storm of conspiracies well
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:22.000]  if you go back to march 23rd of last week there's a video where i bring this jade helm one five
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.800]  document to alex we sit down here at the news desk and we discuss what's going on and in the
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:33.840]  video you can clearly see that it says unclassified not once have we said secret document and any
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.840]  video it's not secret it's been hiding in plain sight for anyone to find except most people don't
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:43.840]  know what to look for and if they did see something like that they wouldn't know what they were looking
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:50.400]  at we get sent by one of our sources i'll leave it at that that hey this is hidden behind a firewall
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:56.560]  but it's unclassified they're supposed to be releasing this a little bird just put it on
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:03.440]  scripts the big document site so that's a trick when something's supposed to be declassified
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:09.520]  they'll still hide it so now for four or five days they've had the different publications
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:15.200]  stars and stripes military dot com and others going we don't know if the documents real but
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:21.920]  these conspiracy theorists uh uh you know claim that we want to take over texas in utah this this
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:26.880]  summer and martial law we're not going to have martial law this summer you notice i don't deny
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:32.720]  the operation though whatsoever they just keep trying to you know move the attention away from
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:37.040]  the fact that that's going on and just keep throwing out the conspiracy term and keep attacking us
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:41.600]  so it takes people's attention off but the fact that there that there is a mission going to happen
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.560]  just like it says in the documents they're not denying it and then you got contacted by
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:50.960]  one of your friends that you served with yeah saying shut up it's a sigh up get you none of
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:55.280]  your business yeah and that's the reason why it's getting this kind of coverage because there is
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:00.560]  underlined hidden messages in this document the pentagon keeps attacking us coming after
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.040]  his claiming that we said this is secret so now we're going to take a look at fox news and in their
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.600]  article it says pentagon a local law enforcement are trying to knock down the rumors and let everyone
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:15.680]  know that the feds have no plan to take over texas well last night on the kelly file megan kelly
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:20.880]  was talking to a reporter out of la chase gallagher while the military says it's just training
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:26.160]  soldiers for the realities of war critics say the army is preparing for modern day martial law
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.120]  trace gallagher live in our west coast newsroom with the story trace and they joke back and forth
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:38.000]  and banter they would not once mention the fact that alex jones or myself or info wars broke this
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.040]  story brought to the attention of the american people all they did was just call us some conspiracy
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:47.840]  group out of austin texas or something like that this is out of control they are blatantly lying
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:52.240]  saying that we said it was a secret document when we never said that whatsoever while that
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:57.680]  hostile characterization didn't sit well with a far right radio host in austin who told his listeners
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:03.760]  that he had access to the secret document that details of federal takeover in texas a libertarian
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:09.040]  website also picked up on the plan and before you know it rallies were being held against the event
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.960]  but apparently the so-called secret document was published weeks ago in several local newspapers
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.760]  letting the public know the training was in the works still the pentagon and local law enforcement
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:24.960]  are trying to knock down the rumors trying to let everyone know that the feds have no plans to
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:30.960]  grab the lone star state apparently this kind of stuff just doesn't play very well in texas now
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:37.200]  there were few so linked to our videos last night alex jones actually did a video which outlines with
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:44.480]  proof what is happening the plan to condition the american public into accepting this military
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:50.000]  a presence on the streets now we're going to look at an article from the dallas morning news that says
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.920]  the us army special operations command has an upcoming training exercise so covert there was
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:00.480]  a press release about it two days ago well first of all this goes back to the whole thing saying
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.480]  that we said it was secret we never said it was secret we showed you the document where says
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.800]  unclassified this is where it actually gets interesting now says despite assurances that the
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.840]  training is prepared troops for overseas missions army documents okay we got a break coming up you
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:19.200]  can see that full report on info wars dot com and of course as joe is pointing out one of the ways
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:24.080]  that you spend this is by creating a straw man as they did on fox news saying that we're saying
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.800]  that this is some secret document that we found we never said that so it's very easy for them to
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:34.080]  say that this unclassified document is secret it is not secret rather so you create a straw man and
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:37.200]  then you take it apart we're going to come back right after the break we're going to take some of

[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:33.680]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.680]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host we're going to be going to phone
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:46.080]  calls in just a moment we're going to go to john in florida if you want to call in and talk to us
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:54.320]  about this fort lauderdale drill that is just surfaced on the info wars site you can see
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:59.600]  the exactly the type of drill that apparently they're going to be using in the jade helm exercise if
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:04.400]  you want to comment on that or jade helm or if you want to talk about the pending united states
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:10.000]  of europe we also talked about that in the first hour so we see them consolidating and admitting
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:18.160]  that these trade groups that they had as far as the uh u as far as the north american free trade
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:24.720]  association all these things were sovereignty based and now the mask is coming off of that as
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:30.480]  they are starting to consolidate those levels into yet another consolidation globally with
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:33.760]  the transatlantic and the trans specific partnerships that they're telling us again
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:40.240]  are simply economic simply trade but we know that it's going to be followed by a sovereignty
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:44.240]  aspect of it that's what's behind the standout at the border you want to know what's going on with
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:50.560]  that they don't consider there to be a border patria said what comes after america well that's
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:55.360]  north america and of course as i mentioned in the first hour the council on foreign relations
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:00.240]  10 years ago ted cruz's wife was working with them to say we're going to have a common border around
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:04.640]  the three countries of the nafta organization we're not going to have individual countries
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:08.800]  so they know that they knew that this was about sovereignty all along they said anybody that said
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:13.520]  it was about sovereignty however they were paranoid they were a conspiracy theorist no we're being
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:17.840]  shown yet again that's exactly what's behind this and we know what's behind these drills
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:20.960]  that are going on as well because we've looked at the scenarios for that we know what they're
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.600]  training for they're doing exactly what their training scenarios we're saying that they were
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:28.640]  going to do i'm going to go to these calls but before i do i just want to let you know that we
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:35.200]  have a new formulation a winter sun is a vitamin d3 and of course they talk about it being winter
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.320]  sun but you know in america even when it's summer most of us don't get out into the sunshine very
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:44.240]  much so we're not getting too much vitamin d that's why you need to supplement it this is a
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:50.800]  ultra nutraceutical quality vitamin d3 it's not d2 which is synthetic and harmful no this is d3
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:59.680]  2000 iu per single dose of 10 drops and it is a very good form of d3 it's a bioavailable form
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.400]  from the nutrient dense lichen plant it's not synthetic i'll stress that again and of course
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:10.480]  we also have 30 off of dna force for the first time it's under a hundred dollars and you save
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.680]  about 40 a bottle on that that helps your mitochondrial health which if you look at that
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:21.600]  that's one of the biggest predictors of life expectancy it helps your mitochondrial cells
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:26.240]  fight the kind of toxins that you're exposed to it helps to helps them to fight off the
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:31.120]  damage to control the damage as i mentioned before the the telomeres are kind of like the little
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:36.560]  end caps on your dna strands kind of like the a little cap on the end of your shoestring and as
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:43.280]  those things get shorter your dna starts to come unraveled just like your shoestring does so there's
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:50.800]  been a lot of scientific studies showing that certain things like reservatrol and um bio pqq
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:55.680]  are helpful for those telomeres to maintain their their place to keep your dna healthy
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.160]  uh let's go to your calls let's go to john in florida john
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:08.800]  hey david how you doing today doing good great um just wanted to comment on you know it's very
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:15.120]  troubling of course to see what's going on in uh fort lauderdale uh i live outside of jacksonville
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:21.440]  and you know there's it's a heavy military presence constantly and you know you see choppers
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:26.800]  flying all over downtown and nobody even bats an eye it's just something that everyone's gotten used
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:32.000]  to in some of these communities so for people that are listening that are not exposed to this
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.720]  it's very real i mean nobody uh no one seems to even care you know something was going on they
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.280]  wouldn't even look yeah absolutely and when i looked at it i was very concerned about what it
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:45.840]  was that they were doing i mean how do you feel about seeing the military flying with black
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:52.160]  helicopters uh you know drag people off and fly them out or or march them down in single file and
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:57.920]  put them into white bands and drive them away how do you feel about that yeah i mean it goes back to
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:03.120]  you know you train on how you feel you're going to be fighting and uh why else would they be doing
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:10.080]  that and just one other quick point um you know we're all the purged high-level military people
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.840]  uh you know why don't they speak up you know yes yes exactly yeah we've seen a lot of people as
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.880]  you point out we've seen a lot of people very high up in the military fired for silly little
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:26.400]  stuff i mean there was like the the number two guy i think in the nuclear arsenal fired because
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:33.040]  he cheated at poker i mean crazy stuff that you would never see before and and very improbable
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:39.200]  that that they would be dismissed for these types of things and yet there was just a slew of these
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:44.560]  things that happened all at once a lot of people very high up yeah it's very concerning very concerning
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:49.120]  and you know quite frankly i'm concerned about the fact that we even have a standing military i
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:54.960]  think we need to go back as we did have this debate here and say shouldn't we stand the
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:02.400]  military down to where we just have an officer corps and not have such a large permanent army
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.800]  that we can get involved in all these different wars of empires we've been for the last 60 years
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:10.400]  uh thank you john let's go to adam in florida adam
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:17.120]  are you doing hey can you hear me all right yeah i hear you go ahead hey there i was calling with
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.880]  the comment that being now i could be wrong but being that these exercises are to be conducted
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:28.160]  amongst the american population and we're being told to go ahead if you see something say something
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:33.840]  and report it it's almost like um from what i understand they're they're encouraging people
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:40.560]  to go and report if they notice military activity but to me this is like already testing things out
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:46.560]  and putting the american people at all with the military and almost challenging them to go out
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:52.560]  and you know uh be in a contest with them oh absolutely it's a psychological operation on
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:58.480]  multiple levels i mean they're looking to see at the state and local level uh which people are
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:03.360]  going to have a problem with them doing this kind of exercise and of course i think most of the people
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:07.680]  at the county level for sure don't really understand what's going on they don't really know
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.280]  about the asymmetric warfare centers where the government's been training they don't really
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:16.960]  know what unconventional warfare is they don't get it uh so that's one aspect of it that we can
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:21.040]  can work on but of course they want to know who's going to be with them and who's going to put some
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:26.080]  resistance against this type of stuff and they also want to get us accustomed to seeing this
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.960]  uh they want to know which people are going to have a problem with it but of course they're
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:32.560]  monitoring everything that we do anyway you're not going to be able to hide from these people
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.400]  you know it's a sort of thing like i point out when i first came here there was uh
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:41.360]  back in north carolina we used to go to the smoky mountains a lot there was a flyer that
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.920]  we got and it talked about if you saw a bear the best thing you could do from the bed the worst
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:49.600]  thing you could do is to run from the bear do not run from the bear the best thing you can do
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:55.920]  is stand up try to look impressive try to show him you're going to fight back yell and scream at
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:02.320]  him throw stuff at him if necessary but do not run and cower in fear and so i think that's the
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:07.520]  way you have to approach these predators on two legs when people when you see the government doing
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:12.320]  stuff that it shouldn't be doing you don't stand down you stand up and you speak out against it
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:17.760]  you get with your where your friends and your uh uh people who are like-minded and you point this out
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:22.800]  and i think it's very important for us to see uh these videos i'm very glad that this person
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:27.440]  exercised their first amendment rights to film this happening in fort lauderdale and put this
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:31.760]  up on the internet they don't want to see that happen they don't want to see episodes of police
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:35.360]  brutality put up that's why you're seeing laws being introduced in multiple states like when i
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:42.320]  pointed out in montana where they want to license you to film the police doing their official business
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.240]  and then maintain editorial control even after you get that license that's a very dangerous thing so
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:52.400]  i think we should all uh speak out about that and um and have a discussion as to what the proper
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:57.040]  role the military is uh how do you feel about that i i don't think that's necessarily just
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:01.360]  pitting the military against the civilian population i think we need to as we see this
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:05.840]  we need to step back and we need to say let's talk about what the proper role the military is
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:11.760]  right i wish i mean i wish i was more educated as to what to say but just the whole thing having
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:16.400]  military presence everyone around and you know basically putting in a odds with us is just a
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:21.600]  bad idea yeah yeah absolutely well and that's the way it has always happened in history you know
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:26.560]  human nature doesn't change the technology changes and all that means is that there's more people
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:30.960]  that can be killed when things go down and of course i think it's interesting when i went back
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:35.200]  and looked at the asymmetric warfare centers videos before we went out there they were
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:40.240]  pretty candid about talking about the fact that they had lost all of their counter insurgency
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:46.640]  operations they still killed a lot of people and they have a massive amount of firepower that we
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:50.800]  don't even know the full extent of it but they're not going to win this one either if it turns into
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.880]  a shooting war i hope it doesn't we need to have that discussion and talk about that we're going

[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:26.320]  through as many calls as we can in this last segment i want to go to christ in kentucky christ
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:32.640]  go ahead yes thanks day for taking my call you're absolutely right on the documentary about the
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.600]  military takeover in these in these drills i mean this is going on for some time and when 9
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:42.960]  11 happened i live in local kentucky and i tell you this town that the kentucky derby is like a
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:48.480]  total police state in this county they want to condition people every year how safer and safer
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.840]  they are when you have more feds and more military and everybody blending together that with these
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:48:00.000]  armed you know tyrants what i call it and that that's what's going on in this country and these
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.920]  people under 35 and younger have no clue they're just like well what's the big deal or they don't
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:10.720]  care or they don't see it because you know being tracked is trendy there's nothing wrong with big
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:16.880]  brother looking at you that's right and chris they've grown up in in school with armed guards i didn't
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.040]  have police in the schools when i was going to school we didn't have metal detectors in the
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:24.000]  school when i was going to school and we didn't have the kind of crime that we have today this
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.600]  does not make us safer creating a police state does not make you safer you do not get security by
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:33.760]  giving up your liberty when you give up your liberty you become a slave you live in a prison
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:39.920]  state you live in a maximum security state that's what we call the worst prisons prisons is maximum
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:43.280]  security and that's what we're getting in the state and as you rightly pointed out the younger
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:47.840]  generation is totally acclimated to this they don't see anything wrong with this and that's the whole
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:52.720]  point that's what's so perversive and and about this and what's so dangerous about this is the
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:58.080]  way that they are acclimating everyone to living in this absolutely you know with the cell phones
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:02.240]  you can get stored before you're being tracked you're going to be trying to see it's like what
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:07.440]  everywhere you go you got wi-fi satellite systems are going to track you to all this stuff about
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:13.040]  missing to you this and that crime whatever the case may be you're tracked you're guilty to proven
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:17.600]  innocence that's the what's we're getting into absolutely and you look at the stingray for example
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:22.240]  you're talking about tracking people they're collecting everyone's information with these fake
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:27.440]  cell phone towers they would not even tell the judges where they got this information because
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:31.360]  they had something that was more important than their oath to the constitution more important
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.680]  than enforcing the law they had something that's called a non-disclosure agreement that they'd
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:40.320]  signed with Harris corporation so they weren't going to talk about the stingray and actually had
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:44.320]  a case where the judge said well you don't have a non-disclosure agreement with me at that point
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:50.240]  the law enforcement said well we'll just dismiss the case then they let this criminal go rather
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:54.400]  than do that and of course the problem is we just had a case come out of charlotte north carolina
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:58.320]  where they're talking about the fact that they're using stingray they admit that they're using
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:02.880]  stingray and they say but we're disclosing this we disclose the fact that we collected this evidence
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:09.520]  to the defendants so they can't use that as a way to to turn back the conviction in many cases
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:14.000]  the problem is is that they're not getting a search warrant to search these people or to
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.600]  search others isn't the fact that they disclose it or didn't disclose it to the defense attorneys
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:22.160]  the fact is is that they did not get a search warrant when we allow the government to get
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:25.760]  rid of things like search warrants when we allow them going all the way back to the rico statutes
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:30.400]  in 1970 with richard nixon they said we got to go after organized crime so we're going to give
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:35.120]  the government the power to confiscate people's property without actually finding them guilty
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:40.400]  of a crime once you break the law in fundamental ways like that once you break the idea of the
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:44.560]  presumption of innocence once you break the idea that you have to convict somebody before you can
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:50.160]  penalize them then you all all bets are off and that's what's happening right now with this massive
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:54.720]  drag net surveillance state that we have it's going to have the same kind of effects down the
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:59.280]  line that we have seen that that came about with the rico statue with a civil asset forfeiture
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:06.000]  of reagan in 1986 the fact that they can pull you over and steal your car without even charging
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.480]  with a crime let alone finding you guilty of a crime that's the kind of thing we have to be
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:14.480]  worried about and that's what's happening now with this police state you're absolutely right it's
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:22.000]  it's rolling this out conditioning the public to seeing the military everywhere and and unfortunately
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.120]  it seems to be working because most of the younger people i see are really passive about this because
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:31.760]  they have seen it as they grew up in the schools on the streets everywhere they're just rolling it
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:36.560]  out to a larger area was there anything else you want to say chris yeah i just want to say that
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:41.120]  you know there's a lot of good people in government folks step up accounting state
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:47.360]  state especially the sheriff the sheriff has the power in their county to say no to this
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:52.400]  and give them gun rights and freedom and stop this you know federal surveillance whatever
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:57.440]  they the sheriff has the power absolutely and you know people are stepping up in certain areas
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:03.280]  we've had uh in wyoming as well as in new mexico we've had the state legislatures step up for
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:07.120]  example with civil asset forfeiture and i didn't get a chance to cover this today we'll cover it
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:11.680]  tomorrow but we had the legislature i believe it was unanimous in both the house and the senate
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:16.080]  in new mexico said they wanted to stop civil asset forfeiture they want to make sure that the
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:20.960]  government could not steal your property without charging you and convicting you of something that
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:26.960]  was a crime and it looks like the governor is maybe not going to sign that bill we just had
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:32.000]  the similar thing happen in wyoming we're both the state house and senate passed a bill to stop
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:38.240]  civil asset forfeiture and amazingly the governor i think his name is mead and in wyoming said uh
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:43.600]  no civil asset forfeiture is a right in other words the government has a right to confiscate
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:49.280]  your property for no reason at all and he says drug he said crime should not pay especially
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:53.680]  drug crime well you know what theft should not pay especially when the government steals and
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:57.120]  that's what the government is becoming just like lisa ender spooner said the difference between a
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:02.560]  highwayman and the government is that the highwayman just takes your purse and then leaves you alone
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:05.600]  whereas the government steals your money and follows you down the road nagging you well it's
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:10.320]  getting much worse than that they kill people they uh steal everything without even charging
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:17.360]  you with a crime uh thank you chris let's go to uh joe in new york joe hi uh david uh if the uh j
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:23.040]  helm is to condition the citizens to sing the military how about reversing that and having
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:29.200]  a citizen on every street corner when the military rolls through town to condition them slightly i
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:32.800]  agree with that i think that's why it's very important that we get the information out about
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:38.400]  jade helm see the information didn't go out about fort lauderdale it hasn't gone out about so many
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:41.360]  of these things we did this report a year ago that we played a little bit of an excerpt about it
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:45.280]  where they were doing it in la where they were doing it in chicago in miami they don't tell people
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:49.920]  about it until it's about to happen or as it's happening the media will come on and say oh don't
[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:54.400]  be alarmed uh this isn't any big deal i think that's what they're going to do with jade helm if anybody
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:58.800]  had an issue about it uh and call the police the police would say i don't worry about it we we know
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:02.560]  this is the military they're doing a training exercise this is why it's important that people
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:08.240]  get this information and as you point out they're there to film what's going on to let them know
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:12.000]  that we're watching what they're doing i think that's a very important thing to do there are a
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.040]  whole bunch of other things it could be done but uh too much to go to right here if you want to talk
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:23.280]  to me uh offline uh feel free to call sure okay yeah give them uh your phone number i appreciate

[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:45.600]  one thing that nobody is talking about i'm not hearing it from alex nobody and that is the fact
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:52.160]  that ted cruz is not eligible to run for president why because he was born in calgary alberta and the
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:58.400]  the um the constitution is is quite clear um in that regard i have a copy of it right in front of me
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:03.360]  and i know well i heard you know harvard i actually i did talk about that on the nightly news i
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:07.520]  mentioned the fact that a lot of the people who brought up the same same objections about
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:12.640]  brock obama saying that his his father was not a u.s citizen his mother was and then those
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:17.600]  questions whether or not he was born in the united states uh but we know that ted cruz was not born
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:21.760]  in the united states we know that his father was not a u.s citizen uh we know that his mother was
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:27.040]  so that brings up an issue of uh the same thing as what is a natural born citizen i think it's
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:33.600]  very important uh although that's not precisely defined uh as to what a natural born citizen is
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:38.320]  i think that's a very important aspect but i see people on the right basically giving him a pass
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:43.520]  what bothers me even more is the fact that his wife was very much involved not only with the
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:50.480]  council on foreign relations but also in terms of producing this plan uh for uh nafta basically
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:55.920]  saying that the north american union should have a common border around all three countries uh she
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:00.320]  was a part of that i would think that if you're going to run for a president that you might
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:05.760]  want to pull back from that of course she's also a goldman sacks banker before that i think it was
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:11.760]  jp morgan she was working with and his father who was working with uh against castrow i cannot
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:17.040]  believe that somebody that would be working to overthrow castrow would not have cia connection
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:23.760]  so all of that gives me a lot to be concerned about ted cruz and and i just hope that he's not a
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.760]  libertarian manchurian candidate but time will tell i think the really the thing that's really
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:33.200]  going to going to tell us uh rob is i think we need to see how these guys are going to break all of
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:38.160]  them uh ted cruz ran paul uh any republican candidate i think we need to see what these guys
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:42.480]  are going to do with a transatlantic and the trans pacific partnership that should tell us
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:47.840]  where their loyalties lie to their loyalties lie to uh corporate global governance in the big banks
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:53.760]  or does it lie to a constitutional sovereign people i think of however most of them at the
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:59.360]  federal level think that it's already a fate accompli that we've already lost america as
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:04.960]  uh as general portrays says that's why i think we need to start working and not pay so much attention
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:10.000]  to the presidential races as we do to try to roll things back at the state level just like we saw
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:16.480]  the legislatures in new mexico and in wyoming stopped this madness of civil asset forfeiture i
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:21.600]  think we can do that with state nullification and i think we need to have jury nullification people
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:26.240]  need to understand their rights as jurors because that's the way you shut down bad state laws as
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:30.960]  well not just the bad encroachments from the federal government uh we're out of time sorry to
