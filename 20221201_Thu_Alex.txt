[01:01.000 --> 01:03.320]  It's Thursday, December 1st, 2022.
[01:03.320 --> 01:04.760]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:04.760 --> 01:08.320]  And in studio, yay, is our guest.
[01:08.320 --> 01:10.520]  He's gonna be here, he says for the next three hours or so.
[01:10.520 --> 01:13.240]  And also, America first leader.

[01:16.400 --> 01:19.640]  and many others are also gonna be coming through here today.
[01:19.640 --> 01:26.000]  And yay has arrived in a new ensemble here with us.
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.720]  But I'll assure you it is yay.
[01:27.720 --> 01:30.720]  Yay, thank you so much for coming to Austin.
[01:30.720 --> 01:31.120]  Thank you.
[01:31.120 --> 01:32.840]  Thank you for having me.
[01:32.840 --> 01:34.000]  Well, where would you like to start?
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.040]  This first little five minute segment is just kind of a prelude
[01:38.040 --> 01:38.640]  to what's coming up.
[01:38.640 --> 01:42.200]  What do you want to cover here today?
[01:42.200 --> 01:47.240]  Just God runs the world, and Jesus is the way and the life.
[01:47.240 --> 01:51.760]  And it's time to put Jesus first in the way
[01:51.760 --> 01:56.280]  that we run our businesses, the way we run our families,
[01:56.280 --> 01:59.440]  our businesses, and the way we run our country.
[01:59.440 --> 02:02.240]  You're radio listeners, we're on over 400 radio stations.
[02:02.240 --> 02:04.680]  They can't see you right now.
[02:04.680 --> 02:06.560]  This is a new look for you.
[02:06.560 --> 02:09.120]  Oh, no, I've been wearing a mask for a while.
[02:09.120 --> 02:10.320]  Ah, yeah.
[02:10.320 --> 02:12.680]  This is an archetypal example of the mask is off.
[02:12.680 --> 02:15.280]  If I put the mask on.
[02:15.280 --> 02:18.120]  People could take it how they want to take it.
[02:18.120 --> 02:22.400]  It's just, you know, it's interesting if you look at a Michael
[02:22.400 --> 02:24.560]  Jordan or something, you would load up all these pictures
[02:24.560 --> 02:26.680]  and he's smiling and he's holding a basketball.
[02:26.680 --> 02:28.320]  He's jumping from the free throw line.
[02:28.320 --> 02:33.080]  And then you look at Phil Knight and you barely
[02:33.080 --> 02:35.360]  can see a picture of him and he's got his face covered.
[02:35.360 --> 02:37.640]  So I don't have to show my face.
[02:37.640 --> 02:39.840]  It's me.
[02:39.840 --> 02:41.920]  That's my that's my right.
[02:41.920 --> 02:42.520]  Absolutely.
[02:42.520 --> 02:46.520]  Well, that's that's that's what Hollywood wants to do, though,
[02:46.520 --> 02:48.760]  is to control everybody through images.
[02:48.760 --> 02:49.320]  Exactly.
[02:49.320 --> 02:51.520]  So I'm in control of my image now.
[02:51.520 --> 02:53.960]  It's no longer the people that froze my account.
[02:53.960 --> 02:55.920]  It's no longer the people that threaten me.
[02:55.920 --> 02:57.680]  We've got past the threats.
[02:57.680 --> 03:00.480]  They tried to throw me in jail for the truth.
[03:00.480 --> 03:04.280]  And, you know, people believe me.
[03:04.280 --> 03:09.080]  And people see that I wasn't crazy on what I was talking about.
[03:09.080 --> 03:12.040]  And they tried to write it off and they keep trying to write it off.
[03:12.040 --> 03:16.240]  But the truth is the more and more I'm faithful to Christ,
[03:16.240 --> 03:20.800]  the more and more he's going to keep unlocking the blessings.
[03:20.800 --> 03:22.960]  You know, he said it on my heart to build communities,
[03:22.960 --> 03:27.160]  to build farms, to build schools, to build the choir.
[03:27.160 --> 03:31.000]  And but when you do that, you have to be really obedient.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.520]  Hey, guys, could you not talk in the back?
[03:32.520 --> 03:34.560]  I'm like really hypersensitive to sound.
[03:34.560 --> 03:37.880]  If you guys want to talk, just go into the room, please.
[03:37.880 --> 03:41.960]  But we have to be really obedient, you know, like one of the big topics
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.080]  right now is all of the pedophilia advertisement.
[03:46.480 --> 03:51.040]  And my take on that is, you know, there's there's one place in the Bible
[03:51.320 --> 03:53.920]  where it says God sees sin differently.
[03:54.160 --> 03:55.960]  And there's another place where it says,
[03:57.520 --> 03:59.040]  you know, let me get out my phone.
[03:59.040 --> 04:01.960]  I can like really pull up the exact thing it says in the Bible.
[04:01.960 --> 04:04.600]  The general gist and we'll get back to it after the five minute break
[04:04.600 --> 04:10.600]  is that you have to stay strict to everything and remove
[04:10.600 --> 04:13.520]  as much sin as possible in order to serve God.
[04:14.040 --> 04:20.480]  And when people look at pornography, when a grown man is looking at a grown woman,
[04:20.760 --> 04:24.760]  have sex on camera, you're still looking at someone's daughter.
[04:24.760 --> 04:31.880]  And you're looking at a lot of times someone that is the product of pedophilia.
[04:31.880 --> 04:36.640]  So people will engage in going to strip clubs or looking at pornography.
[04:36.840 --> 04:43.280]  But then they the moral compass is like, oh, my God, look at the pedophiles.
[04:43.560 --> 04:49.400]  But in a way, anybody who looks at pornography is a form of a of a pedophile.
[04:49.400 --> 04:52.160]  Also, let's let's bank it all in.
[04:52.360 --> 04:53.560]  It's very simple.
[04:53.560 --> 04:56.600]  We're not going to be talking about all this moral code and these standards
[04:56.600 --> 05:00.360]  right here is either Christ said so or Christ said no.
[05:00.360 --> 05:01.680]  Yeah, powerful information.
[05:01.680 --> 05:02.520]  I totally agree with you.
[05:02.520 --> 05:06.560]  Back in 60 seconds, join over 400 radio stations, Nick Foyntes and studio.
[05:06.760 --> 05:10.360]  Everybody tell everybody, you know, tune in now in full wars.com forward slash show.
[05:10.560 --> 05:11.840]  Let's break the internet today.
[05:11.840 --> 05:12.360]  Stay with us.
[05:13.480 --> 05:17.560]  Well, make no mistake this Thursday, December 1st, 2022 broadcast is beyond the
[05:17.560 --> 05:21.360]  twilight zone because truth is stranger than fiction.
[05:21.360 --> 05:25.840]  Yeah, maybe more controversial than Alex Jones or Donald Trump now.
[05:26.040 --> 05:28.960]  I mean, there's about the most controversial people in the world.
[05:29.160 --> 05:30.960]  And obviously the most attacked and demonized.
[05:30.960 --> 05:33.360]  He's here. Nick Foyntes is here as well.
[05:33.360 --> 05:34.160]  America first.
[05:34.160 --> 05:36.360]  We're going to have Ali Alexander on Owen Shroyer.
[05:36.560 --> 05:39.600]  This thing's going to go for the next three plus hours as long as long as
[05:39.600 --> 05:40.760]  he wants to go.
[05:40.760 --> 05:45.000]  Some stations don't carry the first five, but you just dropped some bombs that
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.560]  I totally agree that are huge.
[05:46.560 --> 05:48.800]  Yeah, so recap that and continue on, sir.
[05:48.800 --> 05:51.200]  OK, so I look this up. It's about sin.
[05:51.400 --> 05:56.400]  That's what we're going to talk about sin today and how we need to do everything
[05:56.600 --> 06:03.000]  that we can. We're imperfect, but to flee to free ourselves of sin and repent
[06:03.200 --> 06:07.800]  for sin throughout the day at night and in the morning.
[06:07.800 --> 06:12.600]  So right here, the Bible says right here, I know I'm going to do a Corinthians
[06:12.800 --> 06:16.600]  to like Trump, you know, new, new Christian kind of reading of this.
[06:16.600 --> 06:23.600]  So bear with me. I love Jesus, but I'm not the most experienced Christian.
[06:23.800 --> 06:29.600]  And it says the book of Proverbs 6, 16 dash 19.
[06:29.800 --> 06:31.000]  I'm sure that's the wrong way to read it.
[06:31.200 --> 06:32.400]  It's OK. You got the floor.
[06:32.600 --> 06:37.600]  OK, identify seven things that God hates, although there are not any
[06:37.800 --> 06:39.400]  punishments prescribed for those.
[06:39.600 --> 06:45.000]  Scripture clearly indicates that God does view sin differently and that he
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.800]  prescribed he he proscribed he proscribed a different punishment for sin,
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.800]  depending upon its severity. Now, watch this one.
[06:55.000 --> 07:01.000]  It says where the phrase all sins are equal in the eyes of God comes from.
[07:01.200 --> 07:05.400]  As far as I can tell, the most common argument for the belief that all sins
[07:05.600 --> 07:10.000]  are created equal comes from the book of James 2, 10.
[07:10.000 --> 07:16.000]  It states for whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point
[07:16.200 --> 07:19.400]  is guilty of breaking all of it.
[07:19.600 --> 07:24.400]  Now, I'm a big fan of Steve Jobs, even though he did create Apple.
[07:24.600 --> 07:29.000]  And if you notice, the logo of Apple is actually the fall of men, the forbidden
[07:29.200 --> 07:31.400]  fruit, the Bitten Apple, right?
[07:31.600 --> 07:36.800]  So we can get into, you know, what what social media has done to families and all
[07:36.800 --> 07:39.800]  that we can we got three hours, right?
[07:40.000 --> 07:47.400]  But I like the way our our incredible American inventors like Disney and Hughes
[07:47.600 --> 07:52.400]  and Steve Jobs, the way they ran their companies and invented things that changed
[07:52.600 --> 08:00.400]  the world and the way Steve ran his company was his version of a sinless office.
[08:00.600 --> 08:05.800]  Everyone had to be so meticulous to be able to take what was 10 things at one
[08:05.800 --> 08:08.200]  time and make and put it in the palm of our hand.
[08:08.400 --> 08:09.600]  Think about an iPhone.
[08:09.800 --> 08:11.000]  It's your fax.
[08:11.200 --> 08:13.000]  It's your email.
[08:13.200 --> 08:13.800]  It's your phone.
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.000]  And now it's a thousand things.
[08:15.200 --> 08:16.400]  Yeah, it's your camera.
[08:16.600 --> 08:18.800]  It's your your flashlight.
[08:19.000 --> 08:20.400]  Yeah, it's like a thousand things in it.
[08:20.600 --> 08:25.200]  But he had to have his army go in with a sinless approach.
[08:25.400 --> 08:29.600]  And right now, you know, Gideon called God called Gideon to make an army.
[08:29.800 --> 08:33.400]  The three hundred, the real three hundred, not the movie version that we're all
[08:33.400 --> 08:38.000]  focused on serving this mission at the time.
[08:38.200 --> 08:43.200]  So we have a mission right now to save our families from social media,
[08:43.400 --> 08:48.400]  from Zionist control and bring Jesus Christ back to the forefront.
[08:48.600 --> 08:50.400]  And we're protected.
[08:50.600 --> 08:51.800]  You know, I don't have security.
[08:52.000 --> 08:53.600]  My security is the angels.
[08:53.800 --> 08:58.000]  My security is the fact that I didn't load up pornography last night.
[08:58.200 --> 09:01.200]  And I said this addiction is going to have to flee from me.
[09:01.200 --> 09:05.000]  You know, this addiction, since I was five years old, that is destroyed.
[09:05.200 --> 09:08.600]  My my mom and my dad's family that destroyed my family.
[09:08.800 --> 09:13.400]  Like when I take full accountability for the destruction, like of my marriage,
[09:13.600 --> 09:17.600]  when I point at the liberals and say, you took my wife from me, you know,
[09:17.600 --> 09:18.800]  it took my wife from me.
[09:18.800 --> 09:21.200]  The fact that I was married to this beautiful person.
[09:21.400 --> 09:23.000]  But I felt like it wasn't enough.
[09:23.200 --> 09:26.200]  I felt like I still needed to look at pornography in some way.
[09:26.200 --> 09:29.600]  I'd say to her, we'll stop making these images, stop breaking the Internet.
[09:29.600 --> 09:34.400]  You know, that original term comes from my ex-wife actually having a nude photo
[09:34.600 --> 09:38.400]  that I didn't know about that someone used her and put it on a magazine.
[09:38.600 --> 09:41.600]  But there's somewhere where she's like, well, if my husband is looking at this,
[09:41.800 --> 09:44.800]  I still want to be like the girls that are doing this.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.800]  And this becomes people reliving the traumas, pushing the addiction.
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.800]  The pornography industry is not even a big industry.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.600]  It's like less than ten billion dollars, right?
[09:54.800 --> 09:57.200]  So that means that it's not used for prosperity.
[09:57.400 --> 09:58.600]  It's used for disparity.
[09:58.600 --> 10:02.800]  By the way, George Arwell wrote 1984 and he'd been the number two guy in PsyOps
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.200]  for OSS and ran propaganda for the British government.
[10:06.400 --> 10:09.200]  But he found out that he didn't like Hitler, but he found out that they were
[10:09.200 --> 10:10.800]  actually manipulated and created him.
[10:11.000 --> 10:12.000]  He didn't like the communists.
[10:12.000 --> 10:12.800]  He'd been one of them.
[10:12.800 --> 10:16.400]  He found out the British intelligence had had actually created that and done that.
[10:16.600 --> 10:20.400]  And he explained in 1984 that pornography is something to destroy families,
[10:20.600 --> 10:23.200]  destroy our souls and get us to commit.
[10:23.400 --> 10:26.200]  He wasn't even a big Christian, but but get us to debase ourselves
[10:26.400 --> 10:27.600]  so that they can control us.
[10:27.600 --> 10:31.800]  Absolutely. You got alcohol and pornography are these legal drugs.
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.200]  Alcohol is a spirit.
[10:33.400 --> 10:36.800]  I'm going to we're going to go into the spirit of Al Koolay.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.600]  Well, let's just go to the facts today.
[10:39.800 --> 10:43.000]  Let's not just even do opinions and I love how you brought that in because now
[10:43.200 --> 10:46.800]  you got God's warriors coming together right now.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.400]  OK, Nick Fuentes doesn't have a Twitter account.
[10:50.600 --> 10:52.200]  Alex Jones doesn't have a Twitter account.
[10:52.400 --> 10:56.600]  But hey, guess what, Elon, I got a Twitter and today I'm going to have Nick
[10:56.600 --> 11:00.000]  and Alex tweet from my account.
[11:00.200 --> 11:03.000]  You like that aria, Manuel?
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.400]  I'm all about free speech.
[11:06.600 --> 11:08.600]  And the greatest threat is those that want to silence us.
[11:08.600 --> 11:10.000]  Why comes First Amendment?
[11:10.200 --> 11:13.000]  Anybody trying to take your speech is the enemy.
[11:13.200 --> 11:14.600]  Absolutely.
[11:14.800 --> 11:20.000]  Well, and it's I do find it a little bit hypocritical that Elon Musk said
[11:20.200 --> 11:23.400]  that he was purchasing Twitter to create a free speech environment.
[11:23.400 --> 11:27.400]  He says that free speech is the thing that's going to save the West and our
[11:27.600 --> 11:33.000]  civilization, but yet he has taken exception to you, Alex, for some
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.600]  seemingly specific reason, maybe personal to him, but definitely not principled.
[11:37.800 --> 11:42.000]  So I think it's time that the people finally demand a real victory here.
[11:42.200 --> 11:46.600]  We've been at war essentially since Trump came down the golden escalator seven
[11:46.800 --> 11:50.800]  years ago to put America first, to put Christ first, to free the Internet
[11:51.000 --> 11:52.600]  and do these kinds of things.
[11:52.600 --> 11:54.200]  And here we are all this time later.
[11:54.200 --> 11:58.200]  And it seems like we've stagnated or in some ways maybe even taken a step back.
[11:58.400 --> 12:00.200]  So it's time that people demand.
[12:00.400 --> 12:01.400]  We want Christ first.
[12:01.600 --> 12:02.800]  We want America first.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  We want Alex Jones back on Twitter.
[12:05.200 --> 12:07.400]  These are just and reasonable demands.
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.400]  I see it like this and I want you to be able to elaborate on this.
[12:09.400 --> 12:12.400]  But I don't want you to get his run because he's got so much to say.
[12:12.400 --> 12:13.200]  And he always gets cut off.
[12:13.200 --> 12:16.200]  But I'm going to try to shut up as much, but he we can go four or five hours
[12:16.200 --> 12:18.200]  if you want the main shows actually four hours long.
[12:18.200 --> 12:19.200]  I was just hoping for three.
[12:19.200 --> 12:21.200]  We'll do four hours if you guys are up for it.
[12:21.200 --> 12:23.400]  But but but here's what I'm saying.
[12:23.600 --> 12:25.200]  I am a classical liberal at heart.
[12:25.200 --> 12:28.600]  So I love everybody and I judge people by what they do, not a color they are.
[12:28.800 --> 12:32.000]  And then I look at the things you've said and some of them out of context
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.800]  I don't agree with, but compared to a liberal, a modern liberal saying white
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.600]  people are inherently evil and white people are bad because their skin color.
[12:40.800 --> 12:44.000]  And then that's what the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and these leftist
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.200]  groups in Hollywood have pushed.
[12:45.400 --> 12:49.400]  So they're putting out something beyond even what Hitler said, but reversing it
[12:49.400 --> 12:51.600]  on the white people and we're supposed to sit there and accept it.
[12:51.600 --> 12:55.000]  And then he comes out and says, hey, you know, I see kind of a mafia running
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.200]  things and he's the devil.
[12:56.200 --> 12:58.200]  No, that's bullshit.
[12:58.400 --> 12:59.200]  Sorry.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.200]  Are we going to curse a little bit less on this?
[13:02.200 --> 13:04.400]  Yes, yes, Reverend, I'm going to try.
[13:04.400 --> 13:05.200]  I'll stop.
[13:05.200 --> 13:09.800]  And the reason I wanted Nick, people have heard from Nick, but he people
[13:09.800 --> 13:14.600]  haven't heard from Nick with yay standing right next to him.
[13:14.600 --> 13:21.800]  You know, it's like that's the thing that the Zionist control, the 300
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.800]  in control of the media and control of the governments.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.600]  They don't want us to connect to each other.
[13:27.600 --> 13:32.600]  Like my dad said, OK, they say you're anti-Semitic, but they say he's a white
[13:32.600 --> 13:36.800]  supremacist and he's asking me, well, what's the difference?
[13:36.800 --> 13:39.000]  I said that there is no difference.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.200]  It's just separation and confusion.
[13:42.200 --> 13:46.600]  They want to separate and confuse the Christians and make us afraid to stand
[13:46.600 --> 13:47.600]  next to each other.
[13:47.600 --> 13:50.200]  A Christian can stand next to anyone.
[13:50.200 --> 13:53.600]  We can go visit our Kelly in prison.
[13:53.600 --> 13:56.000]  We can go talk to Harvey Weinstein.
[13:56.000 --> 13:57.000]  That's what Jesus did.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.600]  Yes, because Jesus can save everyone.
[14:00.600 --> 14:04.400]  And but if the Zionists can get us so afraid that they're going to do what
[14:04.400 --> 14:08.600]  they've been doing to me, attempting to put me in jail, freeze my accounts,
[14:08.600 --> 14:14.600]  smearing me on the media, you know, all of these things, you know, you put on
[14:14.600 --> 14:19.400]  the whole armor of God and they will not be able to break your spirit.
[14:19.600 --> 14:24.000]  They might we can do three hours on this subject and you do five hours on it.
[14:24.200 --> 14:27.600]  And let's just get it all going now, because I want to get into everything
[14:27.600 --> 14:31.800]  about your plans to try to bring jobs to America, unifying people, running
[14:31.800 --> 14:33.400]  for president, all those other issues.
[14:33.600 --> 14:34.800]  So I'm not staring us away from that.
[14:34.800 --> 14:37.600]  I'm just saying, let's just run with it as far as you guys want to go.
[14:37.600 --> 14:40.400]  And then I want to get into all the other topics that surround things.
[14:40.600 --> 14:41.400]  Oh, beautiful.
[14:41.600 --> 14:42.600]  So where do you want to start?
[14:42.800 --> 14:44.800]  Well, I mean, I would just start with this.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  There are good people from every group and in every type of culture.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  And we all know that.
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.600]  But definitely the left, when it was America defeated Hitler, calls their
[14:53.600 --> 14:56.200]  opposition Hitler, when both my grandfather's almost died in the Army
[14:56.200 --> 14:57.600]  Air Corps, both of them almost died.
[14:57.600 --> 15:00.600]  One of them crash landed after a mission and got all broke up.
[15:00.800 --> 15:05.600]  The other one got hit in a German air raid in North Africa and he'd only done
[15:05.600 --> 15:09.200]  like 18 of his missions and then he had a concussion and he was the captain.
[15:09.400 --> 15:11.800]  And then his buddies went up the next day and blew up over Italy.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  He was always freaked out.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.200]  But I never really talked about till he died, but when he died, we read the
[15:15.200 --> 15:18.200]  letters and all the awards he had and stuff and the things he did after that.
[15:18.200 --> 15:20.400]  And then, you know, re-upping and recommitting to the Army Air Corps.
[15:20.600 --> 15:23.600]  So I take it as an offense to have George Soros and people that actually work
[15:23.600 --> 15:28.200]  for Hitler rounding up people tell me I'm a Nazi when I almost don't exist.
[15:28.400 --> 15:29.600]  When my grandfather's went over there.
[15:29.600 --> 15:31.800]  So I got a lot to say about this as well.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  It's just it's just nuanced with the whole thing that's going on.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  But expanding on that.
[15:37.200 --> 15:40.000]  Yeah, give us because I want you to go wherever you want.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  So just let's just have you talk for 10, 15 minutes more before me and me and
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  because we got a lot to hear from pointes needs to be heard, but we want to hear
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  from you. Go ahead.
[15:49.400 --> 15:54.400]  Well, I said with Ali Alexander and Nick Fuentes that we're like the SWAT team
[15:54.400 --> 15:59.000]  of free thought and I go in with this battle ram at the door and then they
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  come in with these laser beams and have that information and we work together
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000]  as a team. A lot of times in media, they want to single out one person
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  and burn them to the core. That is a Zionist approach and they're asking
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  me to use that same approach.
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  Well, hey, don't say all people just say specifically the businessman and then I
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  go on Lex Freeman and I say who it specifically and I still not enough.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  They're still taking it too far.
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  Everyone knows and agrees now that it's like a reverse version of American
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  history X to scene when they put the guy's head against the curve and kick
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  the back of it.
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  And now people are like, wait a second, the so-called crime doesn't deserve
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  the punishment. What did I thought?
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  That's right. You're not Hitler. You're not a Nazi. You don't deserve to be called
[16:48.000 --> 16:49.000]  that and demonized.
[16:49.000 --> 16:56.000]  Well, I, I see, I, I see good things about Hitler also. The Jew, I love
[16:56.000 --> 17:03.000]  everyone and Jewish people are not going to tell me you can love, you know,
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.000]  us and you can love what we're doing to you with the contracts and you can
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  love what we're, you know, what we're pushing with the pornography.
[17:10.000 --> 17:16.000]  But this guy that invented highways, invented the very microphone that I
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  use as a musician, you can't say out loud that this person ever did anything
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  good and I'm done with that.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  I'm done with the classifications. Every human being has something of value
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  that they brought to the table, especially Hitler. How about that one?
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  Ari Emmanuel, how you like that one? Hey, Ron, you're going to do anything to
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.000]  fix Chicago?
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  Well, I am worried about the thousands of black folks down a month in
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  Chicago, but, but let me expand on this. That's a nuanced issue.
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  You know, my, my, my grandfather grew up in Dallas and from a pretty wealthy
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.000]  family.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  And also Hitler was born Christian.
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  Well, I've actually studied some of the history on it, but, but it's very
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  interesting. My grandfather, you know, grew up and actually some of his,
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  you know, family spoke some German. There's a lot of Germans in Texas.
[18:02.000 --> 18:07.000]  But did you know that he grew up next door to the inventor of air conditioning
[18:07.000 --> 18:10.000]  and the inventor of one of the major versions of refrigeration?
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.000]  And so my issue was growing up, my grandfather told me the stories about
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  some of the inside baseball and the things that went on.
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  But later I'm going to get into that. I'm going to tell you some stuff about
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  Hitler that you might not know directly that happened to my people I knew.
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  I'd love to hear everything because guess what? We don't get to hear.
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.000]  It's hidden. Even like our truth, the fact that African Americans were in
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  America before the pilgrims. That truth is hidden.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  That we are actually the native Americans or some of us are natives.
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  Or the fact that what Kyrie got in trouble is pointing out that we're Jewish
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  slave boats. Like, and then look at Australia.
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.000]  They've done some of the genetic typing of the aborigines there.
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  They're basically Africans. There you go. You know, so all of these
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  truths and then the current truths about banking, about the government.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  My favorite thing that I got to say with Tim Poole was
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  Rahm Emanuel was right there next to Obama.
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  Jared Kushner was right there next to Trump.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  What are those two people, those two Zionists?
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  I gave it away. Have in common.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  Nick, can you pick that up and expound on that?
[19:19.000 --> 19:23.000]  Absolutely. Yeah. You know, and it's interesting because you've been going on these interviews
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  with Lex Friedman and with Tim Poole and Piers Morgan.
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  And they always say, well, don't talk about a group. Talk about the individuals.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  And I would point out one, it's hypocritical because in the same interview
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  Tim Poole said, well, wouldn't the A be so great for the black vote?
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  You can say the black vote, we talk about Jewish businessmen and somehow
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  that's a problem. You can't talk about groups when it's one but not the other.
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.000]  The other thing is that there is something baked into the cake in Judaism
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  which affects how they're brokering these kinds of contracts with entertainers like,
[19:52.000 --> 19:58.000]  yeah, if you look at the Talmud, which is a real Jewish holy book or part of the holy book,
[19:58.000 --> 20:01.000]  there's the written Torah, which is the Hebrew Bible.
[20:01.000 --> 20:06.000]  There's the oral Torah, which was written down as the Mishnah and then interpreted in the Talmud.
[20:06.000 --> 20:11.000]  And the Talmud, it says that Jews have to treat Gentiles differently than they treat other Jews.
[20:11.000 --> 20:15.000]  There's all kinds of examples of this. They say that if you accidentally,
[20:15.000 --> 20:20.000]  if a Jew indirectly kills a Gentile, there's nothing even wrong with that.
[20:20.000 --> 20:24.000]  There's nothing morally wrong with that. They say that for a Jew to have sex with a Gentile
[20:24.000 --> 20:30.000]  is comparable to bestiality. They say that the semen of a Gentile is like that of horses.
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  They also say that you can't give a gift to a Gentile.
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  A Jew is not permitted under the Talmud to give a gift to a Gentile.
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.000]  They're not permitted to charge each other interest, but they're encouraged to charge Gentiles interest.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  What do they say about pedophilia?
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  They say that that's in some cases, listed.
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  Well, here's what you're telling me in their holy book.
[20:50.000 --> 20:55.000]  It says it's okay to be pedophiles as long as it's not another Jewish person.
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.000]  That's only it came from Adam. I'm not 100 percent sure.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  Well, let me just get this. Let me just get this out front.
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  I believe in free speech and that's why I want you to be here and be able to say whatever you want.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  I'm quite the historian from a lot of multifaceted views.
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  So at a certain point, I'm going to give my nuanced views of this because there are power structures,
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  and there are mafias, and there are cliques, and there are groups.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  And there is certainly leftist Jews that call everybody Nazis.
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  They don't agree with you. You don't want open borders.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  You don't want your guns taken or you don't want to take a shot.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  The ADL had a meeting last two weeks ago and said Alex Jones is an agent of evil.
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  He should be taken off the air. He's the devil because he doesn't want you to take four shots.
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  And I'm like, what are you doing calling me anti-Semitic? I'm not against groups.
[21:35.000 --> 21:36.000]  I don't get into group politics.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  Adam, I've got, I mean, sorry, sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to say that.
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  Alex.
[21:41.000 --> 21:42.000]  Yes, sir.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  I've got the perfect answer for the ADL.
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.000]  They are going to have to listen up.
[21:49.000 --> 21:53.000]  What we did is we brought Netanyahu with us.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  I'm in the twilight zone right now.
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  Netanyahu, what do you have to say?
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  What do you have to say to Alex Jones right now?
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  Nick Fuentes and yay.
[22:08.000 --> 22:14.000]  It was bad. It was bad for Trump to meet with Nick and yay.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  Okay.
[22:16.000 --> 22:22.000]  I had no idea your voice is going to sound like that Netanyahu.
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.000]  So you don't like Benjamin Netanyahu?
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  I just, I just heard about this guy two weeks ago since like the tweet.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  And I thought he had a funny name.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  I heard he's like really into like, he's like a super killer.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  I could die for saying this.
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  So in case just the last time you ever hear from me.
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  Well, look, look, look, look, look, look, I'm glad you guys are here.
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  And we can, we can, we can sit here and upset.
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.000]  All I'm telling you is you guys realize that the British government created Hitler
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  and the Milder group put him in power and there's something much more sophisticated.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  And I personally think that most Jews are great people.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  And I, and I understand there's a Jewish mafia and they're,
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  they're used to demonize anybody that promotes freedom,
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  but I don't blame Jews in general for that.
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  And there is a much larger eugenics, transhumanist,
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  scientific elite agenda that's playing off.
[23:12.000 --> 23:13.000]  What about abortion?
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  It's 50% of black deaths.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  There's over 50.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  Hey, one of the papers I had, you're like, why is it all,
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  you're the director today.
[23:21.000 --> 23:29.000]  The, the, the, the Margaret senior Rockefeller founded plan parenthood came out today and said,
[23:29.000 --> 23:34.000]  because of your white guilt, white people need to give money so we can kill black babies.
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  I swear to God, it's in my stack.
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  If you, if it hadn't moved it off the desk, I could pull it right up for you.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  Why did I have you move it off the desk, Alex?
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.000]  Because it's cluttered.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  I'm not bitching.
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  I'm just saying everybody asks, where's my papers?
[23:43.000 --> 23:44.000]  I don't have them.
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  There's a prop.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  I can literally go look, I agree with you.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  Look at this.
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  You say white people help us kill black people for your white guilt.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  It actually says that.
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  Now, this is, I'm agreeing with you.
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  Is it a problem with props?
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  We can't, this is the voice.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  See, you get your mop.
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.000]  You get your mop.
[24:03.000 --> 24:07.000]  I actually, I'm going to find the tweet here because I want to show you this.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  This is a big guy.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  I sent it to you this morning.
[24:09.000 --> 24:10.000]  It was, it was in the tweets.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  He pulled it up.
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.000]  It's, it's, it's, it's official Twitter of the eugenics death cult.
[24:17.000 --> 24:18.000]  Talk about Nazis.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  I mean, we're going to have Netanyahu step out for a second.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  Okay, Alex.
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  Are you going to go?
[24:23.000 --> 24:29.000]  I'm leaving for now to do is another meeting and then I'm going to say something.
[24:29.000 --> 24:30.000]  All right.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  You're not only an artist, you're a comedian.
[24:32.000 --> 24:40.000]  But Nick, that's what I'm getting at here is, is that is, is, is, is that it was a,
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  it doesn't, it doesn't matter.
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  I just, I mean, there's, listen, there's fluoride in the water killing us all.
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.000]  They're injecting us with GMO.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  Oh, here's the question.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  And I'm not, I'm not an apologist for Israel.
[24:50.000 --> 24:51.000]  I'm trying to be balanced here.
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.000]  And I believe in First Amendment.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.000]  I believe in free speech.
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  I'm going to endorse you say whatever you want.
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  Israel has other than, other than like Singapore and a few places, the most draconian mRNA
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  injections in the world.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  They have the highest death rate from the shots.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  They are literally forcibly injecting them like Joseph Mengele and Jews are dying in
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  mass in Israel.
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  So if the Jews are the secret group that runs it all, and I'm not denying that, you know,
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  Hollywood, what I'm saying is the Zionist, but okay.
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  Well, why would the Zionist be killing Jews in mass in Israel with the boys and shot?
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  Because they'd work for Satan.
[25:24.000 --> 25:25.000]  They don't work for God.
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  Exactly.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  So they, they create atmospheres that get Jews persecuted so they can control the Jews
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  so they can kill them.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  And you just did it.
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  Just like George Soros helped round up Jews for Hitler.
[25:37.000 --> 25:38.000]  That's the next level.
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  Boom.
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.000]  We just got there.
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  And they, they, they control the left and the right.
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  They make politics super messy.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  I went in to meet with my boy, Trump.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  And the next thing you know, like he typed, he said, fake news went crazy.
[25:53.000 --> 26:00.000]  And I, I love Trump, like every other good Christian American, we just want to hold
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  Trump to Christian values and say, that's the only way to the White House.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  And if he doesn't do it, then I'm going to have to do it.
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  I think that Trump is a more senior president.
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  I think I've got some growing to do, but I love Jesus.
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.000]  It's kind of like David, all of his brothers had all this battle experience and he was
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  tended to the sheep.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  But while he was out there, he had to fight bears and tigers.
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.000]  This is the little I know as a baby Christian trip.
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  Yeah.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  But he was able to beat that giant.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  And right now this giant, there's a, there's some cleaning.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  There's some, there's some plumbing that we have to do.
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  And that's what I'm doing with my style of art, my style of humor and who I am as a
[26:42.000 --> 26:50.000]  celebrity to say, okay, I've been messed over enough by Jewish businessmen to get to
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  the point to say, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.000]  I'm not the first person that got debanked because of their political opinion.
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  And I represent now the common man.
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.000]  If we go, when we go, I don't like the word if, when we go into the White House, it's
[27:07.000 --> 27:08.000]  the us now.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  It's not about specifically an icon or dissent.
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  But it's issues.
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  Yeah.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  It's, it's about the issues in America.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  Stay there.
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  Stay there.
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  Dick point desert studio.
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  This is uncensored folks.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  We're going to come back after this break and, and we're going to come back into the
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  break and play a George Sorrell's compilation of him on NPR.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  Him on NPR and him on 60 minutes saying the best time of his life was rounding up and
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  killing Jews.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  Yay.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  Never killed any Jews.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  So I want to know how do I get the ADL to love me?
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  Do I round up Jews in Nazi Germany?
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  Do I get loved then?
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  Schwarzenegger said he loved Hitler.
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.000]  They gave him an award.
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  I've been just saying, I don't like Nazis and I don't like what some of the mafias are
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  doing either.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  Hitler.
[27:49.000 --> 27:55.000]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life that year of German occupation.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  For me, it was a very positive experience.
[27:57.000 --> 28:04.000]  It's a strange thing because you see incredible suffering around you and in fact you are in
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  considerable danger yourself.
[28:07.000 --> 28:13.000]  But you're 14 years old and you don't believe that it can actually touch you.
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  You have a belief in yourself, your belief in your father.
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  It's a very happy making, exhilarating experience.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  While hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being shipped off to the death camps,
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  George Soros accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds, confiscating property
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  from the Jews.
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  These are pictures from 1944 of what happened to George Soros' friends and neighbors.
[28:38.000 --> 28:47.000]  You're a Hungarian Jew who escaped the Holocaust by posing as a Christian.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  Right.
[28:49.000 --> 28:56.000]  And you watched lots of people get shipped off to the death camps.
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  Right.
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.000]  I was 14 years old and I would say that that's when my character was made.
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.000]  In what way?
[29:02.000 --> 29:12.000]  That one should think ahead, one should understand and anticipate events and one is threatened.
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  It was a tremendous threat of evil.
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  I mean, it was a very personal experience of evil.
[29:17.000 --> 29:26.000]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.000]  Yes, yes.
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  That's right.
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  Yes.
[29:33.000 --> 29:39.000]  I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  couch for many, many years.
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.000]  Was it difficult?
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  Not at all.
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.000]  Not at all.
[29:48.000 --> 29:58.000]  Maybe as a child you don't see the connection, but it created no problem at all.
[29:58.000 --> 29:59.000]  No feeling of guilt?
[29:59.000 --> 30:00.000]  No.
[30:00.000 --> 30:07.000]  For example, I'm Jewish and here I am watching these people go, I could just as easily be
[30:07.000 --> 30:10.000]  there, I should be there, none of that.
[30:10.000 --> 30:18.000]  Well, of course I could be on the other side or I could be the one from whom the thing is
[30:18.000 --> 30:34.000]  being taken away, but there was no sense that I shouldn't be there because that was, well,
[30:34.000 --> 30:42.000]  actually, a funny way, it's just like in markets that if I weren't there, of course I wasn't
[30:42.000 --> 30:47.000]  doing it, but somebody else would be taking it away anyhow.
[30:47.000 --> 30:53.000]  Whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away.
[30:53.000 --> 30:57.000]  So I had no role in taking away that property.
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  So I had no sense of guilt.
[30:59.000 --> 31:01.000]  Are you religious?
[31:01.000 --> 31:02.000]  No.
[31:02.000 --> 31:05.000]  Do you believe in God?
[31:05.000 --> 31:06.000]  No.
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.500]  All right.
[31:08.500 --> 31:13.800]  My mission here today is to offer the First Amendment because as long as you're not carrying
[31:13.800 --> 31:17.600]  out violence against someone or asking people to be violent, like the left asks people to
[31:17.600 --> 31:22.400]  burn down cities and attack Republicans and celebrate a rampall and its police being shot
[31:22.400 --> 31:26.560]  and attacked, then you have your free speech.
[31:26.560 --> 31:32.040]  And when the left came out in the last 10 years and really accelerated the last five,
[31:32.040 --> 31:37.560]  six, it said white people are inherently evil because of the color of their skin and that
[31:37.560 --> 31:44.480]  somebody who moved here as a kid from Poland, they're supposed to pay reparations for what
[31:44.480 --> 31:47.200]  people did hundreds of years ago in this country.
[31:47.200 --> 31:48.200]  It's a divide and conquer strategy.
[31:48.200 --> 31:50.000]  I'm not getting into the reparations debate.
[31:50.000 --> 31:53.640]  I'm saying the group's pushing reparations are trying to cause division.
[31:53.640 --> 31:59.600]  So I've said it, the most Nazi-like activities I've seen and the Nazis, in my view, were
[31:59.600 --> 32:02.000]  thugs that shook people down to a lot of really bad things.
[32:02.000 --> 32:03.000]  But they did good things too.
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.640]  We're going to stop dissing the Nazis all the time.
[32:05.640 --> 32:06.640]  Okay.
[32:06.640 --> 32:07.640]  We're going to get to that.
[32:07.640 --> 32:12.760]  I don't want to get digressed into this, but remember I told you a story about my grandfather
[32:12.760 --> 32:18.160]  growing up in the richest neighborhood in Dallas and down the street was a famous German
[32:18.160 --> 32:20.120]  American inventor.
[32:20.120 --> 32:23.720]  And he was a first-generation person, he'd come in when he was a little kid on a ship
[32:23.720 --> 32:29.320]  and he was, he held a bunch of the patents on refrigeration and air conditioning.
[32:29.320 --> 32:33.840]  And my grandfather worked at the time he was about eight years old because he took him
[32:33.840 --> 32:41.440]  under his wing in his little tinkering factory that then he had factories in places like
[32:41.440 --> 32:43.920]  Detroit that actually built the stuff.
[32:43.920 --> 32:48.200]  And my grandfather, the main reason he joined the Army Air Corps, he told me, he didn't
[32:48.200 --> 32:51.880]  tell me a lot about this, he's told me this story was because he watched that man very
[32:51.880 --> 32:58.600]  quietly once Hitler got power in the thirties, suck every dime out of him or he would kill
[32:58.600 --> 33:00.360]  his relatives in Germany.
[33:00.360 --> 33:04.800]  And that guy was blonde-haired and blue-eyed, it was as German as, as, as you can get as
[33:04.800 --> 33:09.720]  Arnold Schwarzenegger or, you know, as, as Teutonic as, as, as Germanic.
[33:09.720 --> 33:11.680]  And the point was my grandfather saw that.
[33:11.680 --> 33:16.760]  So I understand you're opposed to other forces, but I don't think then thinking other forces
[33:16.760 --> 33:24.600]  in history that are lionized, that's my personal experience of what my grandfather, Clyde William
[33:24.600 --> 33:25.600]  Hammond told me.
[33:25.600 --> 33:26.600]  Does that make sense?
[33:26.600 --> 33:31.520]  It, it not totally to me, but it's, and I'm not saying that to be disrespectful, I'm saying
[33:31.520 --> 33:33.520]  like it literally doesn't totally make sense to me.
[33:33.520 --> 33:39.080]  I'm following it, but I was just thinking about Satan, that whether it's the Zionists
[33:39.080 --> 33:44.760]  or Hitler, it's not the person it's Satan using the people that I agree with that are
[33:44.760 --> 33:47.480]  controlled by demonic forces.
[33:47.480 --> 33:52.480]  But what I'm going to say is the Jewish media has made us feel like the Nazis and Hitler
[33:52.480 --> 33:56.120]  have never offered anything of value to the world.
[33:56.120 --> 33:59.200]  Meanwhile, there's all of these things that are happening.
[33:59.200 --> 34:05.680]  Planned Parenthood is new world order population eugenics that is happening to this date.
[34:05.680 --> 34:10.280]  I got some jokes here from Owen Benjamin that I want to read about Ben Shapiro.
[34:10.280 --> 34:15.440]  Hey, Candace Owens unplugged his robot before he runs his mouth.
[34:15.440 --> 34:19.360]  Ben Shapiro's cardio is picking up shackles.
[34:19.360 --> 34:25.520]  Shapiro can tell how much changes in your pocket just from hearing a jingle.
[34:25.520 --> 34:29.640]  Shapiro is just mad that Kyrie won't sign his basketball.
[34:29.640 --> 34:30.640]  Back to you, Alex.
[34:30.640 --> 34:33.120]  There's your sit down there.
[34:33.120 --> 34:34.600]  You want to say something?
[34:34.600 --> 34:35.600]  Yeah.
[34:35.600 --> 34:37.640]  Well, I, I agree with yay.
[34:37.640 --> 34:42.360]  I think that when you look at what's going on today, so much of the political landscape
[34:42.360 --> 34:46.560]  happens in the shadow of World War Two and the Nazis and Hitler.
[34:46.560 --> 34:50.440]  And I think it requires a little bit of an investigation and examination of where those
[34:50.440 --> 34:51.600]  values come from.
[34:51.600 --> 34:56.040]  You know, people talk about Nazis and Hitler, but the United States had camps as well.
[34:56.040 --> 34:58.040]  The United States put the Japanese in intermingle.
[34:58.040 --> 34:59.960]  The United States injected black people with syphilis.
[34:59.960 --> 35:00.960]  Yeah.
[35:00.960 --> 35:02.560]  And, and you know, I totally agree with you.
[35:02.560 --> 35:03.560]  Yeah.
[35:03.560 --> 35:08.360]  The United States has Instagram selling pornography to little kids and they're selling, people
[35:08.360 --> 35:10.680]  are selling their, it's prostitution rings.
[35:10.680 --> 35:11.680]  Instagram.
[35:11.680 --> 35:16.360]  So is your point, let he without saying cast the first stone, you're just, you know, Instagram
[35:16.360 --> 35:18.400]  is a prostitution ring.
[35:18.400 --> 35:23.000]  Like I went 30 days off of Instagram and it was the best part of the fast.
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.200]  Me getting kicked off of Instagram was the best thing that ever happened to me.
[35:27.200 --> 35:32.400]  Because when I go to it, it's like watching it with the they live goggles, which is something
[35:32.400 --> 35:37.480]  that, uh, Owen, Owen Benjamin, you guys got to pull this up.
[35:37.480 --> 35:43.600]  Dave Chappelle is a hack and he gets a lot of his jokes from Owen Benjamin.
[35:43.600 --> 35:49.880]  Dave Chappelle went on a Jewish platform and said, they dropped that nigga.
[35:49.880 --> 35:54.160]  Dave Chappelle said they dropped that nigga talking about yay.
[35:54.160 --> 35:57.680]  And he called me Kanye and I'm supposed to be his friend.
[35:57.680 --> 36:02.520]  Dave Chappelle does not believe in God and does not believe in Jesus.
[36:02.520 --> 36:06.840]  These are the kind of black leaders that the Zionists put in front of us.
[36:06.840 --> 36:12.920]  And meanwhile we want to knock Herschel Walker, but Herschel Walker changed his life for Christ
[36:12.920 --> 36:17.360]  and he might have had abortions, but he doesn't believe in abortion.
[36:17.360 --> 36:18.360]  Oh, sure.
[36:18.360 --> 36:21.400]  What matters is, I have to, what matters is the heart.
[36:21.400 --> 36:22.400]  Yeah.
[36:22.400 --> 36:23.400]  Yeah.
[36:23.400 --> 36:24.400]  Go ahead.
[36:24.400 --> 36:25.400]  Yeah.
[36:25.400 --> 36:30.760]  I agree with yay, I think that it's time that America has a fearless visionary leader
[36:30.760 --> 36:35.920]  who serves Christ, who wants to bring the future forth in engineering and theology.
[36:35.920 --> 36:39.640]  I think that when you look at the options that were offered, and I said this on my show
[36:39.640 --> 36:43.240]  the other week and the news said, oh, he supports DeSantis.
[36:43.240 --> 36:45.120]  I said the moderate Trump.
[36:45.120 --> 36:46.120]  DeSantis.
[36:46.120 --> 36:47.120]  Nobody even knows.
[36:47.120 --> 36:49.680]  It's just somebody that all the, the left are all assembled.
[36:49.680 --> 36:50.680]  Let me raise that.
[36:50.680 --> 36:54.120]  Let me raise that since you guys got into this and we'll do ours on this.
[36:54.120 --> 36:57.760]  You know, they don't cut you off, Nick, I want you to let them complete a start.
[36:57.760 --> 37:04.080]  So the moderate Trump versus DeSantis will not produce any outcome where America or Jesus
[37:04.080 --> 37:05.680]  is put first.
[37:05.680 --> 37:09.440]  Israel is rather DeSantis is mobbed up with Israel and Mossad.
[37:09.440 --> 37:13.240]  Donald Trump, his speech, his announcement was written by Jason Miller, who's controlled
[37:13.240 --> 37:14.800]  by foreign interests.
[37:14.800 --> 37:18.640]  If there's a Republican primary between them two and they go up against Biden or they go
[37:18.640 --> 37:23.360]  up against Newsome, there is exactly zero chance that we get any kind of regime that's
[37:23.360 --> 37:24.360]  going to deliver the real change.
[37:24.360 --> 37:25.360]  Nick, I got a question.
[37:25.360 --> 37:31.360]  If I say something that's provocative towards the Mossad, is that Mossad genistic?
[37:31.360 --> 37:32.360]  Hold on.
[37:32.360 --> 37:33.360]  Let's hear from that.
[37:33.360 --> 37:34.360]  Hey, yeah.
[37:34.360 --> 37:35.360]  I'm the head of the Mossad.
[37:35.360 --> 37:40.000]  I'm going to kill you and take your children away from you.
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.760]  Thanks a lot, Netton.
[37:41.760 --> 37:43.320]  Back to you, Alex.
[37:43.320 --> 37:45.720]  Please turn your microphone around, sir.
[37:45.720 --> 37:49.800]  I'm definitely overwhelmed here right now.
[37:49.800 --> 37:57.960]  Listen, all I'm trying to get through here is I believe every group she's named a Netton.
[37:57.960 --> 38:01.200]  I dropped the Yahoo, so we didn't have to.
[38:01.200 --> 38:04.680]  I was tired of picking up the Yahoo and the Netton.
[38:04.680 --> 38:06.400]  So for now, he's just Netton.
[38:06.400 --> 38:08.280]  I know some people call him BB.
[38:08.280 --> 38:14.400]  No, some of you call him Yahoo, but we're going to call him Netton.
[38:14.400 --> 38:15.400]  What you want, man?
[38:15.400 --> 38:18.400]  Hey, yeah, right after this, I'm going to say you crazy.
[38:18.400 --> 38:20.400]  Take your family away from you.
[38:20.400 --> 38:22.400]  We're not done with you yet.
[38:22.400 --> 38:24.400]  You cannot cause free thought.
[38:24.400 --> 38:26.400]  We have to control the history books.
[38:26.400 --> 38:29.400]  We have to control the banks, and we have to go and kill people.
[38:29.400 --> 38:33.400]  Also, we're in the bed of failure.
[38:33.400 --> 38:38.640]  So, and in a little while, hopefully, we're going to take the mask off because is this
[38:38.640 --> 38:40.400]  actually gay here?
[38:40.400 --> 38:41.900]  Folks, is this that?
[38:41.900 --> 38:44.400]  The mask is coming off in a little while, hopefully.
[38:44.400 --> 38:47.400]  We're going to be able to have a discussion about this.
[38:47.400 --> 38:52.400]  Seriously, you have the globalist pushing a poison shot that's already killed 20 million
[38:52.400 --> 38:57.400]  people that they admit doesn't work, and then you're the bad guy for criticizing a group.
[38:57.400 --> 39:01.400]  What I'm saying is when the left said white people are inherently bad because they're
[39:01.400 --> 39:04.400]  white the last six, seven years, they opened the gates up.
[39:04.400 --> 39:05.400]  So what did they expect?
[39:05.400 --> 39:10.400]  It's wrong, in my view, to say any group is inherently bad or has these traits or whatever.
[39:10.400 --> 39:16.400]  We should judge the individual, but it's wrong for the ADL to have what are very racial policies.
[39:16.400 --> 39:17.400]  The ADL is played out.
[39:17.400 --> 39:19.400]  Nobody knows who the ADL are.
[39:19.400 --> 39:20.400]  Stop giving them attention.
[39:20.400 --> 39:21.400]  Nobody cares about the ADL.
[39:21.400 --> 39:22.400]  ADL shut up.
[39:22.400 --> 39:24.400]  Well, they run all the censorship and everything.
[39:24.400 --> 39:25.400]  They don't run anything.
[39:25.400 --> 39:26.400]  They're played out.
[39:26.400 --> 39:28.400]  We run the streets.
[39:28.400 --> 39:31.400]  Well, I'm signaling out the ADL.
[39:31.400 --> 39:32.400]  We don't know who they are.
[39:32.400 --> 39:38.400]  No one in high school knew what the word anti-Semitic was until yay made it popular.
[39:38.400 --> 39:39.400]  No, I hear you.
[39:39.400 --> 39:41.400]  It's definitely a tiger by the tail.
[39:41.400 --> 39:43.400]  Nick, you want to comment here?
[39:43.400 --> 39:50.400]  Yeah, I just want to jump in and say that I don't think yay or I are saying that any
[39:50.400 --> 39:56.400]  group is particularly bad or the Jews as a group are bad, but there are Jewish practices
[39:56.400 --> 40:00.400]  that are based on Jewish law and there is clearly some kind of a Jewish mafia.
[40:00.400 --> 40:02.400]  I'll give you a perfect example.
[40:02.400 --> 40:07.400]  It was Ari Emanuel of WME that called for total boycott on yay.
[40:07.400 --> 40:12.400]  Ari Emanuel's two brothers are Zeke Emanuel, who is the architect of Obamacare in the Obama
[40:12.400 --> 40:16.400]  White House, and his other brother is Ram Emanuel, who is the chief of staff for Obama
[40:16.400 --> 40:18.400]  and the mayor of Chicago.
[40:18.400 --> 40:23.400]  Their father, Benjamin Emanuel, was part of the Ergon, which was a Zionist terrorist
[40:23.400 --> 40:25.400]  group in the 1940s.
[40:25.400 --> 40:30.400]  The definition of anti-Semitism, according to the State Department, is if you say Jews
[40:30.400 --> 40:32.400]  have any allegiance to Israel, it's anti-Semitic.
[40:32.400 --> 40:37.400]  If you say that Jews have any kind of conspiratorial influence in America, it's anti-Semitic.
[40:37.400 --> 40:42.400]  We're supposed to believe that if Ram picks up the phone and gets on a call with Zeke and
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.400]  Ari, and they talk about their jobs, which are running Hollywood and running the Obama
[40:46.400 --> 40:50.400]  White House, a conspiracy, we acknowledge that happens.
[40:50.400 --> 40:53.400]  We're called anti-Semitic, but it's the truth.
[40:53.400 --> 40:56.400]  It's the truth that they make those calls, and it doesn't mean that every Jewish person
[40:56.400 --> 40:57.400]  is in on it.
[40:57.400 --> 41:01.400]  There are good Jews like Darren Beatty and Laura Loomer, and there are lots of fine people.
[41:01.400 --> 41:03.400]  What's that Laura Loomer call in?
[41:03.400 --> 41:08.400]  Also, it's like, there's Jewish people that are basically hiding me under their floor
[41:08.400 --> 41:10.400]  boards right now, under their wooden floors.
[41:10.400 --> 41:15.400]  It's like a reverse version of the Holocaust, because there's Jewish people that saw how
[41:15.400 --> 41:18.400]  I was treated, and they're like, this is wrong.
[41:18.400 --> 41:21.400]  This guy just gave an opinion.
[41:21.400 --> 41:23.400]  I didn't cause any harm.
[41:23.400 --> 41:25.400]  I didn't harm anyone.
[41:25.400 --> 41:30.400]  All I said is, and I spelled it wrong because I was drinking alcohol, and we see the Bible
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.400]  says you can drink, but the king shouldn't have drank, right?
[41:33.400 --> 41:34.400]  And I shouldn't have been drinking.
[41:34.400 --> 41:35.400]  I shouldn't have said death con.
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.400]  That was a $2 billion tweet, basically.
[41:39.400 --> 41:42.400]  I know you know about getting sued.
[41:42.400 --> 41:43.400]  I hear you.
[41:43.400 --> 41:44.400]  So let's expand.
[41:44.400 --> 41:46.400]  Yeah, that's also drinking.
[41:46.400 --> 41:48.400]  So let's expand on this.
[41:48.400 --> 41:51.400]  What you say is what I'm trying to say.
[41:51.400 --> 41:53.400]  You didn't kill anybody.
[41:53.400 --> 41:57.400]  You're simply here saying this, and you're being demonized and attacked, and you're saying
[41:57.400 --> 42:01.400]  that that is hypocritical, but that's what I'm trying to tell you.
[42:01.400 --> 42:06.400]  George Soros admits he went around rounding up Jews with other early protected, stole
[42:06.400 --> 42:08.400]  their money, and sent them to Nazis.
[42:08.400 --> 42:11.400]  What my point is, is that that's what the left does.
[42:11.400 --> 42:12.400]  They hide behind black people.
[42:12.400 --> 42:13.400]  They hide behind Jews.
[42:13.400 --> 42:16.400]  They hide behind groups, and they use racial politics to control.
[42:16.400 --> 42:21.400]  And so I think that's the most important thing is to understand that we can all come together
[42:21.400 --> 42:22.400]  under Christ.
[42:22.400 --> 42:23.400]  Also, they blackmail.
[42:23.400 --> 42:25.400]  Okay, go ahead about the Christ thing.
[42:25.400 --> 42:26.400]  I want to hear this.
[42:26.400 --> 42:32.400]  I'm just saying, I mean, I don't hate anybody because of their religion or their background,
[42:32.400 --> 42:34.400]  and there's great people from every organization.
[42:34.400 --> 42:35.400]  And I think...
[42:35.400 --> 42:36.400]  George Soros can come to Christ.
[42:36.400 --> 42:39.400]  It is a possibility that he can convert and come to Christ.
[42:39.400 --> 42:42.400]  Would you meet with George Soros if he wanted to meet with you?
[42:42.400 --> 42:43.400]  Absolutely.
[42:43.400 --> 42:44.400]  I would meet with anyone.
[42:44.400 --> 42:45.400]  That's the only thing.
[42:45.400 --> 42:46.400]  Laura, we're live.
[42:46.400 --> 42:47.400]  What's up?
[42:47.400 --> 42:48.400]  This is Laura Loomer.
[42:48.400 --> 42:50.400]  I'm watching live.
[42:50.400 --> 42:54.400]  I saw you just said that you wanted me to call in, so I'm calling in.
[42:54.400 --> 42:56.400]  Well, how does she have your number?
[42:56.400 --> 43:01.400]  Well, she called me because she had some concerns about Milo running my campaign.
[43:01.400 --> 43:02.400]  No, that's great.
[43:02.400 --> 43:03.400]  So here's the deal.
[43:03.400 --> 43:04.400]  Can we...
[43:04.400 --> 43:05.400]  We've got Laura Loomer's number.
[43:05.400 --> 43:07.400]  Can we call her on Skype or Zoom?
[43:07.400 --> 43:09.400]  Can we actually put her on the show?
[43:09.400 --> 43:12.400]  Laura, you're on via speakerphone.
[43:12.400 --> 43:15.400]  Can you come on via Skype or via phone right now?
[43:15.400 --> 43:19.400]  Yeah, I can't do video right now, but I could do audio.
[43:19.400 --> 43:21.400]  I texted your producer.
[43:21.400 --> 43:24.400]  Laura, we're going to call you right now.
[43:24.400 --> 43:25.400]  We'll put you on here in two minutes.
[43:25.400 --> 43:26.400]  Don't trash Milo.
[43:26.400 --> 43:27.400]  I like Milo.
[43:27.400 --> 43:30.400]  I'll call in right now.
[43:30.400 --> 43:31.400]  You didn't say yes.
[43:31.400 --> 43:32.400]  Yeah, they're going to call her.
[43:32.400 --> 43:33.400]  They got her now.
[43:33.400 --> 43:34.400]  Okay, go home.
[43:34.400 --> 43:35.400]  This is crazy.
[43:35.400 --> 43:38.400]  Listen, all I'm trying to say is...
[43:38.400 --> 43:39.400]  Milo's Jewish.
[43:39.400 --> 43:41.400]  I love Milo.
[43:41.400 --> 43:42.400]  Yeah.
[43:42.400 --> 43:45.400]  And you've got a little bit of the Hitler fetish going on.
[43:45.400 --> 43:46.400]  It's not a fetish.
[43:46.400 --> 43:47.400]  It's not a fetish.
[43:47.400 --> 43:48.400]  That's the term.
[43:48.400 --> 43:51.400]  I just love information.
[43:51.400 --> 43:53.400]  They have some documentaries.
[43:53.400 --> 43:57.400]  Apparently, Bezos is allowed to put up any documentary,
[43:57.400 --> 43:59.400]  but if a basketball player tweets it,
[43:59.400 --> 44:01.400]  he'll lose his entire career.
[44:01.400 --> 44:02.400]  I think that that's...
[44:02.400 --> 44:03.400]  Well, that's where I want to go,
[44:03.400 --> 44:04.400]  because you've got millions,
[44:04.400 --> 44:07.400]  hundreds of millions of Chinese locked down right now
[44:07.400 --> 44:08.400]  by...
[44:08.400 --> 44:09.400]  Chinese are great people,
[44:09.400 --> 44:10.400]  but their government in that country
[44:10.400 --> 44:13.400]  is the most racist, homogenistic,
[44:13.400 --> 44:17.400]  or homogeneous, actually, group there is.
[44:17.400 --> 44:18.400]  And all I'm saying is,
[44:18.400 --> 44:20.400]  I really care about those Chinese people under lockdown
[44:20.400 --> 44:22.400]  because they want to use that as a model against us.
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.400]  I'm just kind of not...
[44:25.400 --> 44:28.400]  I'm not on the whole Jew thing.
[44:28.400 --> 44:29.400]  It's what I'm saying.
[44:29.400 --> 44:30.400]  I don't care if people talk about it.
[44:30.400 --> 44:31.400]  I believe in free speech.
[44:31.400 --> 44:33.400]  I'm just really worried about the forced injections,
[44:33.400 --> 44:36.400]  world government, 5G, the open borders,
[44:36.400 --> 44:38.400]  the collapsing currencies, war with Russia.
[44:38.400 --> 44:40.400]  What do you think?
[44:40.400 --> 44:42.400]  I don't have all of that information.
[44:42.400 --> 44:44.400]  I have the information that two days ago,
[44:44.400 --> 44:46.400]  I thought I was going to be put in prison
[44:46.400 --> 44:48.400]  because my accounts are frozen.
[44:48.400 --> 44:49.400]  No, I get it.
[44:49.400 --> 44:50.400]  You're in Hollywood,
[44:50.400 --> 44:52.400]  and the managers you see are...
[44:52.400 --> 44:53.400]  So I get it from your perspective.
[44:53.400 --> 44:54.400]  I get what you're saying.
[44:54.400 --> 44:56.400]  Yeah, and I love Jesus,
[44:56.400 --> 45:00.400]  and I have to fight this war
[45:00.400 --> 45:03.400]  to make a better place for my children
[45:03.400 --> 45:05.400]  and for everyone else's children.
[45:05.400 --> 45:07.400]  I got to put myself, my accounts,
[45:07.400 --> 45:10.400]  my name at risk to stand in the front of this war
[45:10.400 --> 45:11.400]  that we have.
[45:11.400 --> 45:13.400]  This is InfaWars, right?
[45:13.400 --> 45:16.400]  So we're going to give this information on InfaWars.
[45:16.400 --> 45:18.400]  By the way, I asked the crew very lovingly.
[45:18.400 --> 45:19.400]  I love the crew,
[45:19.400 --> 45:22.400]  but you guys gave me the tweet I sent you this morning
[45:22.400 --> 45:26.400]  of the abortion mill,
[45:26.400 --> 45:28.400]  New World Order depopulation,
[45:28.400 --> 45:30.400]  Kill the Black People Organization, Planned Parenthood,
[45:30.400 --> 45:32.400]  where they said it's white people's job
[45:32.400 --> 45:34.400]  to give money so we can kill black people.
[45:34.400 --> 45:35.400]  It actually says that,
[45:35.400 --> 45:37.400]  and Yay didn't want me to have it on the desk
[45:37.400 --> 45:39.400]  because he wanted to be able to have it all look clean and stuff,
[45:39.400 --> 45:41.400]  and I get that, so I'm happy for Yay,
[45:41.400 --> 45:43.400]  but will you guys give me that damn tweet?
[45:43.400 --> 45:45.400]  Because I love you to death,
[45:45.400 --> 45:46.400]  but I'm going to ask you for an hour.
[45:46.400 --> 45:47.400]  I need that damn tweet.
[45:47.400 --> 45:50.400]  I want to show people this because it is such,
[45:50.400 --> 45:53.400]  it is such mind control
[45:53.400 --> 45:55.400]  to say white people,
[45:55.400 --> 45:57.400]  you've got white guilt to actually say,
[45:57.400 --> 45:59.400]  you're bad because you're white,
[45:59.400 --> 46:00.400]  help us kill black people.
[46:00.400 --> 46:03.400]  What type of freakish, crazy world is that?
[46:03.400 --> 46:04.400]  Yay?
[46:04.400 --> 46:05.400]  Zionist.
[46:05.400 --> 46:09.400]  Is that too wide of an idea?
[46:09.400 --> 46:12.400]  Do I have to just go specifically to who does that?
[46:12.400 --> 46:14.400]  But it's the devil.
[46:14.400 --> 46:15.400]  It's the devil.
[46:15.400 --> 46:16.400]  We all, like grandma used to say,
[46:16.400 --> 46:18.400]  we all need Jesus Christ.
[46:18.400 --> 46:21.400]  And where I'm at, this position where God is,
[46:21.400 --> 46:23.400]  He's using me as a vessel.
[46:23.400 --> 46:25.400]  Everyone always knew that I was special,
[46:25.400 --> 46:28.400]  but now I get to be a vessel, and I feel so,
[46:28.400 --> 46:30.400]  you know, can we, I'd like to go into a prayer.
[46:30.400 --> 46:32.400]  It's a prayer that my cousin wrote.
[46:32.400 --> 46:35.400]  Now this prayer is, it's pretty long,
[46:35.400 --> 46:38.400]  so please don't cut me off in the middle of this prayer.
[46:38.400 --> 46:39.400]  I'm not, go ahead.
[46:39.400 --> 46:42.400]  So what happened is, I was on a,
[46:42.400 --> 46:45.400]  we were doing a family prayer zoom on Sunday,
[46:45.400 --> 46:48.400]  and his name is Wayne, and he tells me,
[46:48.400 --> 46:51.400]  he says, Kanye, he's like, bro, my name's Jay.
[46:51.400 --> 46:54.400]  You say a prayer, and then I said my prayer,
[46:54.400 --> 46:56.400]  and I felt that it was very profound.
[46:56.400 --> 46:59.400]  I felt like it was Jay level bars where I said,
[46:59.400 --> 47:04.400]  let's remove this whole conversation of morality,
[47:04.400 --> 47:07.400]  and let's go, let's stick to the Bible and say,
[47:07.400 --> 47:10.400]  either Jesus said so, or Jesus said no.
[47:10.400 --> 47:12.400]  Hold on, I'm gonna wait till you drop this.
[47:12.400 --> 47:13.400]  Boom.
[47:13.400 --> 47:14.400]  I listened.
[47:14.400 --> 47:16.400]  All right, so, and I felt like that was profound.
[47:16.400 --> 47:19.400]  That's like a bar that made me top five
[47:19.400 --> 47:22.400]  streaming artists without an album this year.
[47:22.400 --> 47:24.400]  Either Jesus said so, or Jesus said no,
[47:24.400 --> 47:26.400]  because we want to bring in our creative direction
[47:26.400 --> 47:29.400]  and our opinion and our moral compass.
[47:29.400 --> 47:31.400]  Forget the words moral compass.
[47:31.400 --> 47:32.400]  Is it in the Bible?
[47:32.400 --> 47:34.400]  What did the red letters say?
[47:34.400 --> 47:35.400]  What did Jesus say about it?
[47:35.400 --> 47:38.400]  And then we make our decisions off of that.
[47:38.400 --> 47:41.400]  So I said this, and then I also was, I had an idea.
[47:41.400 --> 47:43.400]  Let's stop hoping.
[47:43.400 --> 47:44.400]  Let's pray.
[47:44.400 --> 47:45.400]  Let's talk directly to God.
[47:45.400 --> 47:46.400]  Let's stop hoping for stuff.
[47:46.400 --> 47:47.400]  I agree with that.
[47:47.400 --> 47:50.400]  He has hope in here, and then I took it out,
[47:50.400 --> 47:52.400]  and then I put it back in, and then he,
[47:52.400 --> 47:55.400]  and so I said this prayer, and my family members,
[47:55.400 --> 47:56.400]  they didn't say anything.
[47:56.400 --> 47:59.400]  And then he said his prayer, and all the whole family
[47:59.400 --> 48:02.400]  was like, oh, that's the best prayer I ever heard.
[48:02.400 --> 48:03.400]  And he's like, I know, I know.
[48:03.400 --> 48:05.400]  My prayers could be intimidating.
[48:05.400 --> 48:06.400]  I know, I know.
[48:06.400 --> 48:08.400]  They're like, did you write that down?
[48:08.400 --> 48:09.400]  That was the best prayer ever.
[48:09.400 --> 48:12.400]  And I was thinking like, bro, why you set me up?
[48:12.400 --> 48:14.400]  Why you set me up to say my prayer right before your prayer?
[48:14.400 --> 48:15.400]  But this is his prayer.
[48:15.400 --> 48:17.400]  I was like, send me that prayer, bro.
[48:17.400 --> 48:19.400]  That prayer was pretty good.
[48:19.400 --> 48:22.400]  It says, now, Nick is Catholic,
[48:22.400 --> 48:26.400]  so he doesn't like referring to Jesus as Yahweh God.
[48:26.400 --> 48:32.400]  But I am black, am I African, am I semi?
[48:32.400 --> 48:34.400]  Well, what is it?
[48:34.400 --> 48:36.400]  They call me anti-Semite.
[48:36.400 --> 48:37.400]  They said I'm a nigga in rap.
[48:37.400 --> 48:38.400]  They said I'm black.
[48:38.400 --> 48:39.400]  They told me, say it loud.
[48:39.400 --> 48:41.400]  I'm black and I'm proud.
[48:41.400 --> 48:43.400]  Okay, James Brown, you tell me who I am.
[48:43.400 --> 48:45.400]  But I know that I'm a child of God,
[48:45.400 --> 48:47.400]  and I know Jesus died for us.
[48:47.400 --> 48:50.400]  This is the daily prayer written by my cousin Wayne.
[48:50.400 --> 48:53.400]  Yahweh God, thank you for life, health and strength,
[48:53.400 --> 48:55.400]  faith, hope, and love.
[48:55.400 --> 48:58.400]  And another day to bless, protect your most holy name.
[48:58.400 --> 49:01.400]  I surrender all Yahweh God and acknowledge
[49:01.400 --> 49:04.400]  that all things are spiritual before they are physical.
[49:04.400 --> 49:07.400]  For this reason, we also declare and decree
[49:07.400 --> 49:10.400]  that you are the maker, master, ruler, creator,
[49:10.400 --> 49:12.400]  and guide of our spiritual lives.
[49:12.400 --> 49:15.400]  We also acknowledge our brother Jesus, Yahshua,
[49:15.400 --> 49:19.400]  and the blood he shed that gave us blood paved pathways
[49:19.400 --> 49:21.400]  back to the holy of the holies.
[49:21.400 --> 49:23.400]  As we humbly come before you,
[49:23.400 --> 49:26.400]  you're almighty throne of mercy and grace.
[49:26.400 --> 49:29.400]  We welcome your glory to the rest,
[49:29.400 --> 49:32.400]  to rest heavenly upon our shoulders.
[49:32.400 --> 49:35.400]  Bless our crown with supernatural wisdom
[49:35.400 --> 49:37.400]  and understanding Yahweh God
[49:37.400 --> 49:41.400]  so that we may walk in the true knowledge of who you are
[49:41.400 --> 49:43.400]  and who you created us to be.
[49:43.400 --> 49:45.400]  Quiet our spiritual minds, Yahweh God.
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.400]  God, slow us down and put us in proper alignment
[49:49.400 --> 49:52.400]  and divine timing with the will and purpose
[49:52.400 --> 49:54.400]  you have for our lives.
[49:54.400 --> 49:56.400]  Open our spiritual eyes, Yahweh God,
[49:56.400 --> 50:00.400]  so we may better see all of the divine things of the spirit.
[50:00.400 --> 50:03.400]  Open our spiritual ears, Yahweh God,
[50:03.400 --> 50:07.400]  so we may better hear all of the sacred things of the spirit.
[50:07.400 --> 50:10.400]  Guard our spiritual mouth, Yahweh God.
[50:10.400 --> 50:12.400]  Place a sensor over our divine tongues
[50:12.400 --> 50:16.400]  so we may only speak words that glorify and edify you.
[50:16.400 --> 50:18.400]  Soften our spiritual heart, Yahweh God,
[50:18.400 --> 50:21.400]  so we may walk into deeper communion,
[50:21.400 --> 50:24.400]  communication, commitment, intimacy, understanding,
[50:24.400 --> 50:28.400]  and a relationship with all of the divine things of the spirit.
[50:28.400 --> 50:33.400]  Yahweh God, we recognize that we do not battle
[50:33.400 --> 50:36.400]  against flesh and blood, but against spirits and powers,
[50:36.400 --> 50:39.400]  principalities and rulers of spiritual wickedness
[50:39.400 --> 50:40.400]  in heavenly places.
[50:40.400 --> 50:44.400]  It is for this reason that we put on the whole armor of God,
[50:44.400 --> 50:47.400]  Yahweh God, we put on the helmet of salvation
[50:47.400 --> 50:50.400]  and the breastplate of righteousness.
[50:50.400 --> 50:53.400]  We firmly attach the belt of truth around our ways
[50:53.400 --> 50:57.400]  and drench our feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[50:57.400 --> 51:01.400]  We take our sword of life spirit, which is the word of life
[51:01.400 --> 51:05.400]  and the shield of faith with which we will quench
[51:05.400 --> 51:07.400]  all of the fiery darts of the enemy.
[51:07.400 --> 51:09.400]  Thank you for blessing us from the top of our head
[51:09.400 --> 51:12.400]  to the bottom of our feet and everywhere in between
[51:12.400 --> 51:16.400]  with the first, what we need, everything that we deserve,
[51:16.400 --> 51:19.400]  and then the best that you have for our lives,
[51:19.400 --> 51:21.400]  Yahweh God, in Jesus' name, amen.
[51:21.400 --> 51:23.400]  And perfect time to go to break.
[51:23.400 --> 51:26.400]  Hour number two, Uncensored with Yay.
[51:26.400 --> 51:30.400]  Nick Pointes, I'm your guest host here in St. Asylum World,
[51:30.400 --> 51:32.400]  because the whole world's crazy.
[51:32.400 --> 51:33.400]  All of us are nuts.
[51:33.400 --> 51:36.400]  This is Twilight Zone 2.0.
[51:36.400 --> 51:37.400]  We will be right back.
[51:37.400 --> 51:38.400]  Don't take me when you say that.
[51:38.400 --> 51:39.400]  No, I'm talking about all of us.
[51:39.400 --> 51:40.400]  The whole world's crazy.
[51:40.400 --> 51:41.400]  It is crazy.
[51:41.400 --> 51:43.400]  Everybody's crazy.
[51:43.400 --> 51:44.400]  I believe that.
[51:44.400 --> 51:47.400]  I'm saying the guest host here because these guys are hosting.
[51:47.400 --> 52:03.400]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[52:03.400 --> 52:08.400]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce
[52:08.400 --> 52:12.400]  that free shipping is back at infowarstore.com.
[52:12.400 --> 52:16.400]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[52:16.400 --> 52:20.400]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company,
[52:20.400 --> 52:25.400]  and they're able to cut our regular shipping cost by up to 50%.
[52:25.400 --> 52:28.400]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[52:28.400 --> 52:31.400]  you're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[52:31.400 --> 52:33.400]  This is a game changer.
[52:33.400 --> 52:34.400]  We're so excited about it.
[52:34.400 --> 52:36.400]  Our listeners had really asked for free shipping again.
[52:36.400 --> 52:38.400]  We couldn't afford it before,
[52:38.400 --> 52:40.400]  but by moving to a bigger national distributor,
[52:40.400 --> 52:41.400]  we're able to do it.
[52:41.400 --> 52:44.400]  So now your orders will be shipped even faster.
[52:44.400 --> 52:47.400]  The same great customer service and more.
[52:47.400 --> 52:51.400]  So get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items
[52:51.400 --> 52:53.400]  at infowarstore.com right now.
[52:53.400 --> 52:55.400]  I want to thank you all for your support,
[52:55.400 --> 52:57.400]  but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system,
[52:57.400 --> 53:00.400]  lead a healthier life, and keep invoices on the air.
[53:00.400 --> 53:03.400]  infowarstore.com.
[53:03.400 --> 53:07.400]  The young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau,
[53:07.400 --> 53:11.400]  half of this cabinet are actually young global leaders
[53:11.400 --> 53:15.400]  of the world in correct form, so that we penetrate the cabinets.
[53:15.400 --> 53:17.400]  Everything with the staff system leads to the pay slot.
[53:17.400 --> 53:19.400]  That's not appropriate.
[53:19.400 --> 53:28.400]  And that's all the way that the conversation was coming from.
[53:28.400 --> 53:31.400]  Canadians are watching very closely.
[53:31.400 --> 53:35.400]  Obviously everyone in China should be allowed to express themselves,
[53:35.400 --> 53:40.400]  should be allowed to share their perspectives.
[53:40.400 --> 53:42.400]  And indeed protest.
[53:42.400 --> 53:45.400]  We're going to continue to ensure that China knows
[53:45.400 --> 53:47.400]  we'll stand up for human rights, we'll stand with people
[53:47.400 --> 53:49.400]  who are expressing themselves.
[53:49.400 --> 53:52.400]  We also need to make sure that China and places around the world
[53:52.400 --> 53:54.400]  are respecting journalists and their ability to do their job.
[53:54.400 --> 54:00.400]  There's a level of admiration I actually have for China.
[54:00.400 --> 54:06.400]  Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them
[54:06.400 --> 54:08.400]  to actually turn their economy around on a dime
[54:08.400 --> 54:10.400]  and say we need to go green as fastest,
[54:10.400 --> 54:12.400]  we need to start investing in solar.
[54:12.400 --> 54:16.400]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about
[54:16.400 --> 54:19.400]  of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[54:19.400 --> 54:21.400]  That I find quite interesting.
[54:21.400 --> 54:27.400]  Regardless of the fact that we are attacking your fundamental rights
[54:27.400 --> 54:30.400]  or limiting your fundamental rights,
[54:30.400 --> 54:33.400]  and the Charter says that was wrong,
[54:33.400 --> 54:35.400]  we're still going to go ahead and do with it.
[54:35.400 --> 54:41.400]  The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa
[54:41.400 --> 54:47.400]  or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing
[54:47.400 --> 54:52.400]  do not represent the views of Canadians who have been there for each other
[54:52.400 --> 54:58.400]  who know that following the science and stepping up to protect each other
[54:58.400 --> 55:02.400]  is the best way to continue to ensure our freedoms,
[55:02.400 --> 55:04.400]  our rights, our values as a country.
[55:04.400 --> 55:10.400]  We are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse
[55:10.400 --> 55:15.400]  at small business workers and steal food from the homeless.
[55:15.400 --> 55:20.400]  We won't give in to those who fly racist flags.
[55:20.400 --> 55:25.400]  We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism
[55:25.400 --> 55:28.400]  or dishonor the memory of our veterans.
[55:28.400 --> 55:32.400]  So to those responsible for this behavior, it needs to stop.
[55:32.400 --> 55:36.400]  The Emergencies Act will be used to strengthen and support
[55:36.400 --> 55:41.400]  law enforcement agencies at all levels across the country.
[55:41.400 --> 55:46.400]  As of today, a bank or other financial service provider
[55:46.400 --> 55:52.400]  will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account
[55:52.400 --> 55:54.400]  without a court order.
[55:54.400 --> 55:57.400]  Justin Trudeau, I mean, I thought he was kind of a cool guy.
[55:57.400 --> 56:02.400]  And I started to read what he said, this is a couple of weeks ago,
[56:02.400 --> 56:04.400]  or maybe this is September,
[56:04.400 --> 56:07.400]  but he was talking about people who are not vaccinated.
[56:07.400 --> 56:09.400]  He said, they don't believe in science.
[56:09.400 --> 56:11.400]  They're often misogynistic, often racist.
[56:11.400 --> 56:12.400]  No, they're not.
[56:12.400 --> 56:14.400]  That was not part of him at all.
[56:14.400 --> 56:15.400]  Right.
[56:15.400 --> 56:17.400]  He said, but they take up space.
[56:17.400 --> 56:21.400]  And with that, we have to make a choice in terms of a leader as a country.
[56:21.400 --> 56:23.400]  Do we tolerate these people?
[56:23.400 --> 56:24.400]  It's like, tolerate them.
[56:24.400 --> 56:27.400]  Now you do sound like him.
[56:27.400 --> 56:30.400]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way
[56:30.400 --> 56:33.400]  to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like,
[56:33.400 --> 56:35.400]  at least in government.
[56:35.400 --> 56:38.400]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor
[56:38.400 --> 56:41.400]  what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[56:41.400 --> 56:43.400]  The left have wised up to this.
[56:43.400 --> 56:46.400]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth,
[56:46.400 --> 56:48.400]  use companies to do it.
[56:48.400 --> 56:50.400]  The social media giants, and they are.
[56:50.400 --> 56:53.400]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become
[56:53.400 --> 56:56.400]  that if you can't beat them, prevents them from speaking.
[56:56.400 --> 56:59.400]  So far, the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression
[56:59.400 --> 57:01.400]  has been the radio show host, Alex Jones.
[57:01.400 --> 57:04.400]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party
[57:04.400 --> 57:06.400]  and multinational corporations in Big Tech
[57:06.400 --> 57:09.400]  to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[57:09.400 --> 57:13.400]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook
[57:13.400 --> 57:15.400]  and saying, can you ban this person?
[57:15.400 --> 57:18.400]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist,
[57:18.400 --> 57:22.400]  but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[57:22.400 --> 57:26.400]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment,
[57:26.400 --> 57:29.400]  but instead attack dogging, calling for federal regulators
[57:29.400 --> 57:32.400]  to shut down independent, free press, working with Big Tech.
[57:32.400 --> 57:35.400]  People know what's true. They can smell it.
[57:35.400 --> 57:40.400]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[57:40.400 --> 57:43.400]  In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[57:43.400 --> 57:55.400]  Interitalitarian societies only the powerful can be heard.
[57:55.400 --> 57:59.400]  The evil abuse of children that the world is waking up to today
[57:59.400 --> 58:02.400]  has been going on for many, many years.
[58:02.400 --> 58:07.400]  The Industrial Revolution was fueled by hundreds of thousands of children
[58:07.400 --> 58:11.400]  sold off of orphan trains at local fairs across the country,
[58:11.400 --> 58:17.400]  many of which were born within orphan asylums and referred to as foundlings.
[58:17.400 --> 58:23.400]  History shows us that not everyone sees an innocent child as someone to protect,
[58:23.400 --> 58:27.400]  and the Balenciaga scandal is exposing a hidden cult
[58:27.400 --> 58:31.400]  that celebrates the death and torture of children.
[58:31.400 --> 58:36.400]  The same photographer who placed the Supreme Court ruling on child porn
[58:36.400 --> 58:40.400]  in the Balenciaga ad that sparked this whole recent scandal
[58:40.400 --> 58:44.400]  also did a photo shoot for France's double magazine
[58:44.400 --> 58:50.400]  that featured a traumatized looking child having her passport photo taken for a trip
[58:50.400 --> 58:56.400]  to the same Disney cruise line that provides snorkeling trips off the coast of Epstein's Island,
[58:56.400 --> 58:59.400]  otherwise known as Little Saint James.
[58:59.400 --> 59:05.400]  Both photo shoots appear to have been styled by Russian stylist Lada Volkova,
[59:05.400 --> 59:11.400]  a highly celebrated stylist in the fashion industry who works for Vogue, Adidas, Chanel,
[59:11.400 --> 59:16.400]  and has been a top stylist for Balenciaga since 2014.
[59:16.400 --> 59:20.400]  She has deleted her Instagram account since the scandal hit,
[59:20.400 --> 59:25.400]  but archived images show a dark appreciation for child abuse,
[59:25.400 --> 59:31.400]  images of violent pedophilia, child torture, child disembowelment,
[59:31.400 --> 59:36.400]  Satanism, and cannibalism. Many of these images are appreciated
[59:36.400 --> 59:42.400]  by her rich and famous designer friends, Gosha Robchinsky and Mark Jacobs,
[59:42.400 --> 59:46.400]  both accused of peddling pedophilia in their own work.
[59:46.400 --> 59:53.400]  A recent video shows what appears to be fake babies sold in blood-spattered Balenciaga swag.
[59:53.400 --> 01:00:01.400]  It's in your bag. In a bag, like, stop for a minute. For a minute. Like, what do you do when she's in your bag?
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:06.400]  Yeah, can we do what's in the bag, please? Do you like how it is for you and you can take things out?
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:17.400]  Yeah. Look, there's like, like, when she starts to cry, like, then when she's gonna pee, I don't know.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:23.400]  Then when she's boring, it's just boring.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:27.400]  Yeah. Everything goes.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.400]  Right as the Balenciaga scandal goes viral, Hollywood actress Nicole Kidman,
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:40.400]  who was recently glamorizing eating bugs, proudly releases her own Balenciaga ad on Instagram.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:47.400]  From what we are learning about these people, it seems strange for us to put our faith in any single one of them.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:54.400]  And by all appearances, this wasn't an accident. It seems to be another demoralizing sigh-up.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.400]  The Balenciaga stuff just gets worse and worse. Check this out.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:03.400]  The people that recruited all of the models for Balenciaga's runway show was a woman called Rachel Chandler,
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:12.400]  who has been on Jeffrey Epstein's Island. She's even posted a picture on Instagram of CCTV footage back in 2013, bragging about being on an island.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:17.400]  This stuff's got me wondering if all high-end fashion brands are just fronts for human trafficking.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:24.400]  So most of us know by now that Balenciaga got themselves canceled by having BDSM bears photographed with children.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:32.400]  The same style bears were featured in one of their last runway shows, which was held in a mud pit, as if the brand weren't disgusting enough.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400]  But who opened for the show?
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.400]  Yeah, Kanye West was pretty close with Balenciaga before they got canceled for that last photo shoot.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.400]  Kanye's been all over the place for years. Everybody knows that.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.400]  I'm sure he's been through a lot, I feel for him, but let's keep our eyes open, yeah?
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:02:02.400]  It's a very small club, and yet the majority of us still seem to obsess over them, like royalty, which begs the question, do we have any power?
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:08.400]  And if we someday find that we do, what are we going to do about this evil?
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:23.400]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:44.400]  It's almost like we got Yay here. The whole building is just crazy. Alex Jones here back live with Yay, Nick Fuentes riding shotgun,
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.400]  and we're going to get Laura Lumer on the line. He didn't want to wear earpiece. That's fine.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:53.400]  We're going to call her on his phone like 10 minutes or so, so we'll get to you, Laura. But he wants to get her on, so that's great.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:03:01.400]  We'll get her on. Yay. Let me bring up, since you guys want to get on this topic, the meeting with Trump, they're now using it against Trump.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:14.400]  They're misrepresenting who Nick is, and I think that's fair to say, and they're lying about you, and they're trying to make it the new reason that DeSantis should be the 2024 frontrunner.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:21.400]  And I like DeSantis in many ways, but I don't like who he's aligning with all these big donors and him playing along with this. It's very troubling.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.400]  So tell us about the meeting and what really happened there.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.400]  Nick, you have the minutes on it.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:31.400]  That's right. So it's where to begin.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:39.400]  Well, I want to set the record straight, first of all, because there was a big piece in NBC the other day written by Mark Caputo with a lot of lies about the dinner.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:49.400]  And I don't know if people were misquoted or if bad quotes were given, but people are being led to believe that this was somehow a setup or an ambush to make the president look bad.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.400]  That's not true. Yay loves Trump. I love Trump.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:04:00.400]  We came to the dinner to have a discussion with him and have a discussion with him about the 2024 race. Yay had a proposition for him.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:09.400]  And so a lot of it was really put together in the last minute. I didn't even really know until I was at Mar-a-Lago whether or not we would be at the dinner.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:22.400]  It was something that Yay and I discussed on the flight there and on the car ride over. So I just want to get that cleared up straight away because I think Yay and I both believe that Trump is a great option.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.400]  It really just comes down to Trump and Yay for the most.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.400]  But them trying to premeditatedly claim it was some secret meeting and he knew he was meeting with you. That's not true.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:38.400]  No. Yeah. And it was surprising because we had this conversation the day before we flew out. We were in LA on that Monday.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:46.400]  And I was told it may not even be possible for you to get into Mar-a-Lago. They said because there's so many people that will intercept you.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:53.400]  There's a guest list and you have to be on it and there's a security list and all these things. So I was told that I may not even be able to get through.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:05:02.400]  Well we pulled up to the club. They checked out Yay. They checked out Karen's ID and information. We drove up. We walked in. We sat down in the lobby.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:15.400]  The president came out of the dining room and that was that. He invited Yay to dinner. And I don't know if it was Yay or Trump but one of them said well we want to bring Jamar, Karen and Nick into the dining room.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:25.400]  And so we came in. We sat down. Well we took some pictures. Yay sort of lit up the whole room. Everybody wanted to get a picture with him. We sat down at the table.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:35.400]  And I want to say initially it was a very pleasant dinner. Trump gave kind of the standard black voter pitch. He talked about the HBCUs, the opportunity zones, things like that.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:49.400]  And then it turned out that Yay had accidentally sent a text message to a lawyer that both Trump and Yay share and forwarded him some intel that Karen gave to us about how we were going to handle the Trump meeting
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:56.400]  and how to read his body language and the kinds of things that maybe we should avoid or things we might want to say.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:07.400]  And so before the dinner, Yay accidentally forwarded that to a lawyer who then in the middle of the dinner apparently called Trump to say, hey, Karen Giorno's involved. This is a setup.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:14.400]  You guys are being set up right now. It was really just based on a misunderstanding. And after that call he...
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.400]  Who's this lawyer?
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.400]  Do you mind if I say the name?
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.400]  Yes.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.400]  Yes, you mind?
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.400]  No, I don't.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.400]  Okay, it's Nick Gravante. So he was texting me.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.400]  I don't mind. I don't mind any names. I think that's the general.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.400]  Let him finish the entire story.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:35.400]  So because we pulled up in the car and Yay said, here, I'll forward you these notes. So he forwarded it to me and I said, hey, I didn't get the text.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:42.400]  And we kind of brushed it off and we found out later he meant to send it to Nicholas Fuentes. He sent it to Nicholas Gravante on accident.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:50.400]  So the dinner was actually very pleasant. It was very friendly. Yay picked out a song to play. He put on, say you will, off of 808s.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:56.400]  And then Trump said, oh, I don't know. Let's put on one of your hits. So he put on stronger. It was very congenial.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:02.400]  Well, then in the middle of the dinner, Trump gets this call because Nick Gravante apparently sent the text to one of Trump's guys or somebody.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:06.400]  Somebody called Trump and said, Karen is giving Yay intel.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:11.400]  Because Karen worked for Trump. She ran the state of Florida during the Republican primary in 16.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:15.400]  And so he got the heads up. They fought. It was some big ambush.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:25.400]  So he gets off the phone and the tone totally flipped. And he starts telling Yay these stories about how some of his black constituents had betrayed him.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:34.400]  He told the story about how he got ASAP Rocky out of jail. He told the story about how he got the NBA basketball players out of the Chinese jail.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.400]  And the moral of the story was if you go against me, if you're disloyal to me, I'll crush you.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:50.400]  That was kind of the subtext of the stories from Trump. He said that Kim Kardashian, he said some nasty things about her because she endorsed Joe Biden after Trump released.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:57.400]  What is it? Alice? Alice Johnson. Alice Johnson from prison. He commuted her sentence and then gave her a pardon.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:05.400]  So he felt betrayed by that. And then Yay made the proposition and said, hey, I'd like you to be my running mate in 2024.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:10.400]  And Trump sort of I gave him the opportunity. I didn't say I would like him to. I said, you have the opportunity.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.400]  Right. Yes. My running mate in 2024. Yes. And he wear a mask as well.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:21.400]  I think it would look cool. I do think it looks cool.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.400]  So he sat back and folded his arms and he kind of smirked and he sort of dismissed it.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:32.400]  But then he got a little bit heated and he said, you can't win. You'll never win.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:36.400]  Don't run. You can win at a lot of things, but you can't win at this.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:40.400]  And then he turned to me and Karen and said, you guys are smart. I know you work for him.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.400]  But don't lie to him. Tell him. Tell him he can't win.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:50.400]  And, you know, I love Trump and I love Yay. And so I'm looking at Trump and then I'm looking at Yay and I'm looking at Trump and Yay.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.400]  He's telling me.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.400]  They say you're a white supremacist. Are you a white supremacist?
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.400]  No, not at all.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.400]  Well, spend some time on that.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.400]  Yeah, you know, I'm a Catholic. I'm Christian. And so I believe that we're all...
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.400]  I know that sounds white supremacist right there, but it's not. Go ahead.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.400]  Yeah.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:16.400]  Well, I believe that we're all children of God. And so I think that black, white, red, brown, whatever, we're all siblings in a certain sense because we're created by God.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:22.400]  I do, though, believe that there are races. There are black people. There are white people. There are Hispanics.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:29.400]  And these differences mean something to people. They mean things to each other. That doesn't mean that we can't get along. That doesn't mean...
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:33.400]  But the leftists think it's bad to even have a culture. They're saying none of us can say I'm this or I'm that.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:39.400]  Right. They want to melt us all down. That's what globalization is. They want to globalize the government, the economy, and the population.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.400]  They want a global government. They want to globalize the economy through free trade.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.400]  With no culture.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:51.400]  Exactly. And the population through immigration. And they want to make it so that in 50, 100 years, there are no distinct nations.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.400]  There's no distinct peoples.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.400]  So nobody can stand up to them.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.400]  Right. Just a slave class, undifferentiated. That's what they want.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.400]  This is the future president you're talking to right now.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.400]  Is Nick here running, mate?
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.400]  He's not old enough.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.400]  Yeah, Nick, how old are you?
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.400]  I'm 24. Maybe in a few cycles.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:15.400]  And Trump loved Nick. He looked at me and said, where did you find this kid?
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.400]  He had no idea. What's the guy that wrote the speech that you didn't like?
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.400]  Jason Miller.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.400]  Jason Miller lied afterwards after they found out who you were.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.400]  And what did Jason say in the press to start off?
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:30.400]  Because it started to be like a series of lie after lie after lie and fake.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.400]  It wasn't a tweet. It was a truth social after truth social after truth social.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.400]  So give them the rundown on that.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.400]  Yeah. So initially we didn't publish anything about the dinner.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.400]  It was rumored that Yay went to dinner with Trump.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.400]  Then it was rumored that I was at the dinner because I walked through the airport in Miami.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.400]  Then there was a statement from Jason Miller, who spoke as a representative for Trump.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.400]  And he said, well, Nick Fuentes was not at the dinner.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.400]  And it was only at that point, which was a lie, it was only at that point when we began to respond.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.400]  And Yay said, he can't say that. Nick was at the dinner. That was a lie.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.400]  But I mean, I actually liked the speeches that Jason Miller wrote.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.400]  Maybe, I mean, he was just scared.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.400]  Who was scared? Trump?
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.400]  No, I mean, I think Miller thinking it was a setup.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.400]  But I mean, I think that's what they thought.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  They thought, oh, this is a setup.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.400]  And I think that's where that fear came from.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.400]  But okay, but people got to stop lying.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:27.400]  Our leaders, our politicians have to stop being afraid and being so political.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.400]  And we have to put Christ first.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:35.400]  And if anything comes from this, like the best thing that could come from this is,
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.400]  I'm the president of the United States in 2024.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:45.400]  The worst thing that could come from this is our leaders are held to Christian values, not Zionist values.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.400]  Now, let's talk about the difference of Trump's truth socials.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.400]  Yeah. So he put out three successive posts.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:12:00.400]  There's three responses from Trump on true social and they just get more sort of erratic as the pressure grows.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.400]  You know, the first one, he says, it was a very uneventful dinner.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:10.400]  I did meet with Yay. The next post was, I don't know who Nick Fuentes was and it was totally uneventful.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:16.400]  The third one, he says, Yay, a very troubled man who happens to be black came for badly needed advice.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.400]  And so I just kept getting more and more sort of angry and erratic.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:26.400]  And I think what Yay is getting at, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but Trump is surrounded by handlers.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.400]  He's surrounded by people like Jared Kushner and Jason Miller.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.400]  He's got three campaign managers.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:34.400]  Jared Kushner bailed because he got what he wanted out of Trump, right?
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.400]  Where did Jared do when Trump was in office?
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:42.400]  He got the Abraham Accords. Jared Kushner with his best friend, BB Netanyahu at 666 Fifth Avenue.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:47.400]  They brokered the Abraham Accords, which opened up investment from the Gulf States into Israel.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.400]  What did Neton have to say about it exactly?
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.400]  Netanyahu loves it, of course.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.400]  But let's expand on that.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:57.400]  I love Jared. Hey, hey, listen, this is Neton.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.400]  Okay.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:11.400]  Now, keep going. My point is, is that it's fair, though, for Trump that is a political attack to claim that he endorses or represents even the views they claim you hold that you don't hold.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.400]  So clearly you can see how the media is using you guys as an attack on Trump.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:22.400]  They're using us to try to put this guy we've never heard of, DeSantis, in office.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:33.400]  Like DeSantis is going to play by the book. The thing about Trump is this guy is one of the best presidents we have.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.400]  He's top five presidents. He's right there with Ronald Reagan.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.400]  And he was a warden grad. He's one of the best businessmen of all time.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:47.400]  And the entire time he was the president, the Jewish media attacked him.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:58.400]  They were mad because he was actually working for the country and now they're doing everything, including this meeting to try to say he's not allowed to meet with.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:04.400]  This is info wars. Who are you to say who the president can meet with Netanyahu?
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:17.400]  I'm not going to, the Holy Spirit fills me up and the less said I have, the less angry I get. So you can't make me angry, but if I was of another version of Ye the Kanye West that you guys know,
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:24.400]  I would be angry at Netanyahu for even speaking on one of the best presidents, one of our best presidents of all times.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:31.400]  Shut the, shut the bless up, Netanyahu. This is from Ye. Now you know who I am.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:36.400]  Do you know who I am now, Netanyahu? You know who I am now, Jared Kushner?
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.400]  You know who I am, Josh Kushner? Let me tell you something about softy Josh, right?
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:47.400]  Marshmallow Josh was out of dinner. I'm at Jared's house, Jared Ivanka's house.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:15:02.400]  And I didn't realize at the dinner that Josh Kushner had 10% of skims, which was my ex-wife clothing line, which I have 5% of.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:10.400]  And it's one of the reasons why even after the attack where Ari Emanuel had all of my deals destroyed, I was still worth $400 million, right?
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:22.400]  And still had $250 million of cash available, right? So Josh, I say, what do you think about Jared worker for me in 2024?
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:28.400]  And Josh looks at Jared and says, I would kill him. And so then towards the end of the meeting, I'm leaving their apartment.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:35.400]  They do it like a soft hug because I think like Jared, as soft as Jared is, he has to hug Josh extra soft.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:46.400]  So, you know, he doesn't melt like toilet paper. And what I realized afterwards that Josh had 10% of a line that I only had 5% double,
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:51.400]  where I, you know, skims is an extension of Yeezy. It's an extension of my brand.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:59.400]  Literally, I put the creative director from Yeezy at skims because at first skims was a lingerie line.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:06.400]  And then it was Kris Jenner's idea to make it a shapewear line. And I said, I have the perfect person. Let's take these elements of Yeezy.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:16.400]  And let's put this here. And then Josh goes in and puts $150 million from some investment firm to then control something that my ex-wife was making for our show.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:21.400]  No, I get it. You're at this meeting and literally realizing, oh my God, I own this and ran this. This guy's double what I get.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.400]  You didn't even know he was the owner.
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:32.400]  Yeah. And that's what I explained to Jared. I was on text to Jared. I said, what if I had 10% of a line with Ivanka and you didn't know and you only had 5%?
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.400]  I'm sure.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.400]  What if he learned you own 10% of 666 Park Avenue? He'd be pissed.
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:43.400]  What if I had 10% of that 800? How big was the deal that he did after he got out?
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:49.400]  So what you're saying is we need reparations from Hollywood. We need the Hollywood elite that have almost all the money.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.400]  They need reparations to America.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.400]  I want to talk about how Jared did that first deal with Netton.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:01.400]  Yeah, he got billions. And this is something that was covered in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.400]  Jared Kushner brokered the Abraham Accords with Net and Yahoo.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:09.400]  And before Trump was even out of office, they were arranging for how Kushner could take a massive fee from...
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.400]  But separate from Kushner getting money. I don't like Kushner. He glows in the dark. He's creepy as hell.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:18.400]  I mean, that's a good peace deal to get the Arabs and Jews quit killing each other.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.400]  But I agree with you to some extent.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:25.400]  I mean, actually, that's a pretty... I said that's something good Kushner did. I mean, I don't like Kushner.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.400]  He did it for the money.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.400]  Well, I mean, we got things done.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.400]  And I would say...
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.400]  I'm not defending him. I'm saying isn't it good to try to get Middle East peace?
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.400]  Let's ask Nick.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.400]  Yeah, Nick, go ahead.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:44.400]  If you want Middle East peace, you have to go to Israel because Israel is the one who has been bombing Syria.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.400]  Israel is the one that's...
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.400]  And they got 200 nuclear weapons. They ain't going nowhere.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:55.400]  Exactly. And that's why they killed JFK and RFK was because of they were trying to get their WMD program off the ground.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:00.400]  Operation Apollo. It was Jack Kennedy that wanted IAEA inspectors looking into it.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.400]  No, that is probably one of the main... That's one of the reasons Kennedy got killed. That was a little...
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:11.400]  What we need to say right now, and we're going to bring Ali on in a second, is both my parents were educators, right?
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.400]  And we're here as the educators. That's what's in our heart.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.400]  When we get the information, we put ourselves at risk to give you the information.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:27.400]  There's a lot of teachers, incredibly intelligent people that have been canceled and kicked out of universities for not playing along with the system.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.400]  So stop looking at us like celebrities, like we're trying to get media.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:39.400]  We're using our position, putting our finances, putting our personal well-being at risk to say the truth out loud.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:47.400]  And I was on the plane with Nick and I said, it feels like we're in Vietnam in the middle of the war when I back to the wall holding our guns and saying,
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.400]  you know, Nick, how did you get here? Yeah, how did you get here?
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:55.400]  All the guns are going off and all the media is going off and say, this is info wars, right?
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.400]  So you got some info warriors on both sides of you and you fought for us.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.400]  You've been fighting this battle for a long time, Alex.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:08.400]  And we just got to salute you as a Christian and as American because you paved the way to make braver soldiers like us today.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.400]  It's like Terminator part 10 happening right now.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.400]  Wow. All right, we got to go to break.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.400]  We're going to get Laura Lumer on.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.400]  We're going to get Ollie Alexander on to Manningham on to the smartest guys on politics.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.400]  And we're going to just continue on.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.400]  Troy is going to come on.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.400]  We're going to continue on as long as you guys want to go.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.400]  We'll take breaks and stuff to and get, you know, yeah, to eat something or whatever.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.400]  Me and Nick got somebody he hasn't eaten yet.
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.400]  And we're going to stay fasting.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.400]  He just won't eat.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.400]  I'm trying to get him to eat.
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.400]  So I'm like, I'm Italian, mind you, mind you.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.400]  So we're going to.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:43.400]  I got to watch. I got to watch my accounts because they've been frozen by the Jewish banks.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.400]  So I need to watch my meals.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.400]  Well, CNN says why people are evil Nazis.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.400]  So I mean, I disagree with both statements, but I get the.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.400]  I don't like the word evil next to Nazis.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.400]  I think we need to look at.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.400]  Oh my goodness.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.400]  Just because you don't like one group doesn't mean the other.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:04.400]  I love Jewish people, but I also love Nazis.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.400]  Oh man. Well, I have to disagree with that.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:10.400]  But listen, we're going to go to break.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.400]  I'm the I'm the crazy one here.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.400]  We're all crazy.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:14.400]  The whole world's crazy.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.400]  And the whole power structure is coming down.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.400]  This is absolutely lit.
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:21.400]  This is lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.400]  Number one show in the world right now.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.400]  Everybody's doing it everywhere.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.400]  Yay. Everybody.
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.400]  I appreciate you being here.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.400]  We're going to go to break.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.400]  We're going to come back and play that little by favorite promo with yay.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.400]  And then we're going to air the Trudeau clip and then go right back to yay.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.400]  Stay with us.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.400]  Yay is in studio.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.400]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Nick Fuentes, Ali Alexander,
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.400]  Owen Schreuer about to join us riding shotgun.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.400]  He doesn't want to wear an earpiece.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.400]  So he's going to call Laura Loomer.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.400]  Yeah.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.400]  So we're going to put Laura Loomer on the way she was originally going to be on
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.400]  earlier.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:52.400]  Yeah, you're hosting the show.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.400]  Go ahead.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:21:00.400]  Laura, can you guys hear Laura and the mic?
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.400]  What they're doing is they're talking to her out there.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.400]  I told them 45 minutes ago.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.400]  So tell her you're going to call her.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.400]  They didn't do that because it's such a party.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.400]  Can you guys hear her?
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.400]  Laura say something.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.400]  She's not going to.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.400]  Yeah, Laura, you're on the air.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.400]  Go ahead.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.400]  How's it going?
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.400]  You're on the air with yay.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.400]  Go ahead.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.400]  He wants to do it over his speakerphone.
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.400]  Go ahead.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.400]  Well, look, I just wanted to call in.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:30.400]  You know, I see that everybody on this stream has been canceled.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:35.400]  In some fashion and, you know, I've also been canceled and, you know,
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.400]  I have a unique perspective because, you know,
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.400]  I'm Jewish and I happen to be one of the most banned and censored person
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.400]  people in this country.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:50.400]  And so, you know, I just wanted to talk about the cancel culture and,
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.400]  you know, the act of debanking and deplatforming from my perspective
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:59.400]  because, you know, I was really one of the first people that experienced
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.400]  all of this cancel culture.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:05.400]  And I would just say that, you know,
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:11.400]  I can sympathize with anybody who's had their voice silenced.
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:16.400]  I don't think that censorship is the answer no matter how much you
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.400]  disagree with another person or how offensive you may find their
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.400]  statements or their arguments to be.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:25.400]  And what we need in this country is more free speech.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:30.400]  And I say that, you know, as a Jewish American woman,
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:35.400]  watching this stream and, you know, watching the plague of cancel
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.400]  culture that has really swept not just our country but the entire
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.400]  world over these last few years.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:45.400]  And I will say that being Jewish has never saved me from being canceled.
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:49.400]  It never stopped the banks from shutting down my access to my bank account.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:54.400]  Being Jewish never, you know, prevented me from becoming.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.400]  Like I said, the most banned woman in the world.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:01.400]  So I just wanted to make it clear that, you know, while, you know,
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:05.400]  there's no disputing the fact that groups like the ADL and APAC and,
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:09.400]  you know, powerful, you know, left-wing Jewish individuals
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.400]  and in some cases, right-wing Jewish individuals themselves
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.400]  are advocating for cancel culture.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:18.400]  There are Jews themselves who have also been canceled.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.400]  Yeah, you shouldn't be penalized for what other people have done.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.400]  Martin Luther King said that and I agree with it.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.400]  So yeah, you called yourself more like Martin Luther King
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.400]  the other day than Malcolm X. I tend to agree with that.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.400]  I like Malcolm X. I've read his writings,
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.400]  listened to him incredibly smart and intellectual.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.400]  He was downtrodden. He was telling people to stand up.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.400]  He was an amazing revolutionary for his time, an amazing man.
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:39.400]  But I think Martin Luther King was more powerful and even Malcolm came
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:41.400]  around to his worldview of thinking.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.400]  So my issue is it's the same thing we're talking about here is that,
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.400]  is that, you know, Laura Loomer has been censored.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:50.400]  Laura Loomer has been attacked and Israel has the most draconian
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.400]  COVID shots against their population of any group.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.400]  So I'm saying, why aren't they exempt?
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:58.400]  Because there's a criminal group posing as them.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.400]  Christ talked about this, that is,
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:03.400]  that is trying to manipulate and pose as a leadership of every group.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.400]  There's groups that claim they lead the black folks
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.400]  that aren't caring about blacks.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.400]  There's groups that claim they care about white people
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.400]  that aren't really caring.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.400]  There's groups that claim they're Jewish that don't.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.400]  I think that's really what we're talking about. Do you disagree?
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.400]  I agree. And as you, as I talk about, I think about it's like,
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.400]  I got to say, I love the Zionist.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.400]  I love the people that, that blocked my bank account
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.400]  because God runs the world and uses everyone.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.400]  There's a power structure under God that starts with the 1,000 year old
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.400]  families, such as the Medici's.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:37.400]  Then it goes to the Vatican, which is in bloodline to Peter, not Paul.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.400]  Then it goes to the financial groups, black rock, Vanguard,
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:46.400]  and then to the governments where we can go into Putin territory.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.400]  And then it goes to Hollywood, the ramen manual.
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.400]  That is the first smoke screen to get past.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.400]  And we're just breaking down those smoke screens.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.400]  Hey, Ari, how are you doing, Ari?
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:00.400]  Okay, I will. I want to jump in really quick.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.400]  And I will say.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.400]  Yeah, Lori, you're on the air.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.400]  I'll go ahead and the blacklisting of, you know, people like yay,
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:15.400]  people like Alex Jones, people like Nick Fuentes,
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.400]  people like myself, you know, everybody watching should understand
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:24.400]  we're living in a dangerous time now where people are being shut down
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.400]  and having their money frozen.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.400]  Okay, imagine not being able to access your bank account
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.400]  because somebody in a board room decides that they don't agree
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.400]  with what you're saying.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:39.400]  And so, you know, for people who are critical, you know, of yay, Nick,
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.400]  Alex, myself, or whoever, right?
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.400]  Just think of how fast the tables could turn.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.400]  And I think this is what you've been talking about for years, Alex.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.400]  You've been warning people about what's coming for years.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:54.400]  And now people want to act like, oh, well, how did we get to this point?
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:58.400]  Censorship is the reason why we've got to this point.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.400]  Okay, so, you know, these things wouldn't be happening
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.400]  if people weren't being censored.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.400]  Well, sure, Lori, can I ask you this question?
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.400]  You know, you're a smart, you know, successful pro-America Jewish lady.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.400]  You know, it's an American that lives in Florida.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.400]  From my experience studying what goes on politics, aren't Jews,
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.400]  like everybody else, like left-wing, right-wing, and different factions
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.400]  fighting with each other and everybody else, like any other group?
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:21.400]  I mean, I understand there's powerful groups in Hollywood
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.400]  and all these mafias, but it's like we don't blame Italians
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.400]  for the Italian mafia.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.400]  And when I criticized the Jewish mafia, it was one of the most powerful
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.400]  in the world, which I don't like.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.400]  I don't dislike because they happen to be Jewish,
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:33.400]  because they're a mafia.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.400]  That's really how I think we de-stigmatize it.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.400]  Just say no to the mafia that is the ADL in Hollywood
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.400]  or do you disagree with that or agree or you want to say something?
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.400]  Look, there's factions within any group, right?
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:47.400]  I don't think it's, I don't think that you can really generalize any group.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.400]  I think that when you look at the demographics of Jews in America,
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.400]  over 73% of Jews vote Democrat.
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:57.400]  And so when you see a lot of, you know, people making decisions
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.400]  who happen to be Jewish, it's coming from a left-wing perspective.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:04.400]  But I'm a nationalist, you know, I'm a nationalist and I'm Jewish,
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.400]  and I've been a very strong supporter of President Trump.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.400]  And that's the question, why were they so scared of you?
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:12.400]  Because you've been as much banned as me or even more.
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.400]  I mean, they have come after you.
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.400]  Why are they, why are they scared of Laura Loomer?
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.400]  Because I'm a free speech absolutist.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.400]  And regardless of what somebody may say,
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.400]  even whatever they may say about Jews
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:28.400]  or whatever they may have to say about Israel or Judaism,
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.400]  I'm not going to advocate for anybody to be silenced,
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:34.400]  anybody to be banned or anybody to have their accounts shut down
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.400]  or their money frozen simply because of their viewpoints.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:41.400]  This is America and we need to promote free speech absolutism.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:45.400]  And we need our politicians to start promoting free speech absolutism.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.400]  And this is what I ran, when I ran for Congress twice in Florida,
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.400]  the first time in Trump's home district,
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.400]  which was actually the most Jewish district in the country.
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:57.400]  And then most recently in district 11, you know,
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.400]  I ran on a campaign of free speech absolutism.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.400]  No, I know you do.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.400]  So what about a, what about a first amendment or bill of rights party?
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.400]  Well, you know, that could transcend party lines.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:10.400]  What about a free speech, pro-deself defense,
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.400]  a first amendment, second amendment party?
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.400]  I mean, how do we fix this yet?
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.400]  We fix this with the word of Christ,
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:21.400]  the first book of Moses called Genesis.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.400]  In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.400]  The earth was without form and void
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:32.400]  and darkness was on the face of the deep.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:38.400]  And the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.400]  That's where we start.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.400]  And they know that.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.400]  That's why Prometheus shows that.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.400]  All right, Laura, thank you so much.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.400]  Thank you.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.400]  Close in comments or yay.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.400]  I want to move on to Ollie.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.400]  Thank you very much for calling and talk to later.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.400]  Thanks a lot.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.400]  All right, so good.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:54.400]  That's, that's good.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.400]  All right, Nick, you know,
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.400]  see you in Florida, you want to say something
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.400]  before we go to Ollie Alexander and Owen?
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.400]  Yeah, I want to jump in and say that I agree.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.400]  I think though that it's not so much about the Bill of Rights.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.400]  I think it's really more about Christianity.
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:12.400]  I think that what America needs is a Christian party.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:13.400]  Oh, I agree.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:14.400]  Politically, it's about our freedoms.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.400]  But you're right.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:16.400]  Christ is first.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.400]  Right.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.400]  And it gets to the nature of Judaism,
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.400]  which is the fact that Jews do not believe
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.400]  that Christ was the Son of God.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.400]  And in fact, they're the only group that hate Jesus.
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:28.400]  Muslims see Jesus as a prophet.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.400]  Buddhists, Hindus see Jesus as a spiritual figure.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.400]  Jews write in their Talmud that Christ is burning in hell.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.400]  They, they don't like the cross.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.400]  I think that's because he's kind of was taking over the thing.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.400]  So at the end of the day, we worship a Jew,
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.400]  or we say he's not really a Jew.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.400]  It's not the same thing though,
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.400]  because the kind of Judaism that we have now
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.400]  is not of the Old Testament.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.400]  It's of the rabbinical oral tradition.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.400]  So these people are worshiping.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:52.400]  They're not following the Old Testament.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.400]  They're following the Zohar and the Talmud and all that.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.400]  That's right. Exactly.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:58.400]  So, so I mean, we, people should read that for themselves.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.400]  What about Holly Salassie?
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.400]  Cause this is what happened to Kyrie Irving.
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.400]  And it made me really mad because when I was a kid
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.400]  growing up reading comic books and stuff,
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.400]  I tried, I could read really early.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.400]  I was like five.
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:08.400]  I could read like a 10 year old when I was 10.
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.400]  I could read like a college student.
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.400]  And so I put down comic books when I was about eight,
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.400]  cause my mom had all these history books.
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.400]  And with some of them were picture history books
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.400]  that I started reading those.
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.400]  And it's like a fact that Solomon married
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:19.400]  a bunch of black women.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.400]  It's a fact that Ethiopia was Jewish.
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.400]  It's a fact that North Africa was Jewish.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.400]  It's a fact that that went on.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:28.400]  And then Kyrie Irving puts out a video explaining
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:31.400]  that a bunch of North African blacks are intermarried
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:34.400]  and part Jewish and Israel lets a bunch of blacks in
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.400]  because they can prove that their lineage,
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.400]  their names are Jewish names.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.400]  So how is it anti-Semitic?
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.400]  And how does the ADL say it's anti-Semitic
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.400]  for black people who are related directly
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.400]  to King Solomon and King David, the line of Judah,
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.400]  which Holly Salassie was the leader of Ethiopia.
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.400]  That's where this whole movement comes from
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.400]  to act like they don't know this.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:55.400]  I'm not blaming Jews for this.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.400]  I'm blaming the leftist ADL to deny black Jews
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.400]  their heritage is a historic fraud.
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.400]  It's a damn historic fact.
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.400]  It's on Wikipedia.
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:06.400]  It's not even debated.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.400]  It's true, but it's not just the leftists.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.400]  It's the right wing ones too, you know,
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.400]  because in Israel,
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.400]  Yehush has shown me a clip the other day
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:15.400]  where they are racist towards the Sudanese
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.400]  or Ethiopian black Jews that immigrated to Israel.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.400]  They kick them out.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.400]  There's quotas.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.400]  I mean, Israel's even mean to the Hasidic Jews now.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.400]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.400]  They're waging war.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:25.400]  Right.
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:26.400]  So, and I agree with you
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.400]  and what they've done to Kyrie Irving is just to say...
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.400]  Take God as the link,
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.400]  a beautiful person, wonderful guy.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.400]  He'll tell you, he goes,
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.400]  yeah, that's what runs Israel's evil
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.400]  and so is your groups.
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.400]  Bishop Hero just meant
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:40.400]  that Kyrie won't sign his basketball.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.400]  Back to you, Nick.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:43.400]  So something, what about that issue?
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:44.400]  I'm sure you know about
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.400]  Highland Salassie and Kyrie Irving.
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.400]  Your take on Kyrie.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:50.400]  That's my brother.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.400]  And I love the fact that just like now,
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:57.400]  it felt like you were in this battle by yourself,
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:00.400]  but now you got two warriors alongside of you,
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.400]  like Gargoyles at the top of the buildings in New York,
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.400]  ready to fight for Christ.
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:08.400]  And when Kyrie put up that information,
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.400]  they always want to write me off and say,
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:13.400]  yeah, it's just so crazy, so crazy, so crazy.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.400]  And then Kyrie was like,
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.400]  okay, here goes some information right here.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.400]  Information is to unlock.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:21.400]  There's five elements that the 1%,
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:24.400]  the elites used to control the 99%,
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.400]  which are the masses.
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:30.400]  Those elements are water, food, shelter, medicine, education.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.400]  Which one of those five elements
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:33.400]  are the most important?
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:35.400]  Education, because with the knowledge,
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:36.400]  you can go get water.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:39.400]  You can go get food, you can get shelter,
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:40.400]  and you can get medication.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.400]  They don't want independence.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.400]  I agree.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:47.400]  And Kyrie fought for something.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:52.400]  And then also, for me, Kyrie, I love Kyrie,
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.400]  he did what his job was.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:57.400]  They had the Hebrew Israelites in front of the game.
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.400]  And now the high schools,
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.400]  I always think about the high schools.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:01.400]  I always think about the future,
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.400]  the grammar schools, the high schools.
[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:06.400]  These are the people that are going to change our lives.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.400]  So the high schools are asking questions.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:12.400]  People are running around saying, oh, yay, it's racist.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.400]  What is, the term racism was created
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:20.400]  and I think the construct of racism was created.
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.400]  The communist Russians.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.400]  Yeah.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.400]  And it's like the whole woke culture,
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.400]  the idea of the white man did this,
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.400]  the Jewish guy did this.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.400]  Now I'm saying specifically the bankers,
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:36.400]  I think my misstep in the tweet was to pinpoint a people
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:39.400]  as opposed to pinpointing the devil
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.400]  and the fact that the devil used to have that.
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:45.400]  But more than that, it was my disobedience to God
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:49.400]  that forced me into the whale's stomach as I am right now.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.400]  But it's only my obedience to God
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.400]  that's going to bring me out of the whale's stomach.
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.400]  Well, let's elaborate.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.400]  You're not walking back.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.400]  You said you are clarifying it, which is key.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.400]  It's evil in the hearts of men and women.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.400]  It's a problem.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.400]  And so you're not walking it back.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:02.400]  You're clarifying.
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:03.400]  This is big.
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:04.400]  Let's clarify.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:09.400]  Satan, the angel, God's one of his favorite angels,
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.400]  one of the most powerful angels.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:12.400]  The most powerful.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:13.400]  Yeah.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:16.400]  Satan, that's what I like, the most powerful angel, Satan.
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.400]  And he brought angels with him when he left heaven, right?
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.400]  How many angels did Satan ring with him?
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:21.400]  33% of them.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.400]  So he brought billions of angels with him.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:29.400]  So angels, I mean, Satan has 33% of God's warriors with him
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:33.400]  working for Satan, but God runs the world.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:38.400]  And it's Satan that gets inside of the Zionists
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.400]  and makes them do evil things.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:43.400]  These are stories because I'm a baby Christian, right?
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:47.400]  But I heard that, you know, God loves me so much.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:48.400]  He loves me so much, right?
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.400]  Then I go to drink champs and I'm drinking.
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:54.400]  And the Bible says, king, don't drink, right?
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.400]  I noticed that Milo.
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:58.400]  I know I'm not saying it in correct, perfect English,
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.400]  but the Bible says, king, don't drink.
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:05.400]  And I'm drinking and I'm smoking and I'm using my ego
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:09.400]  because I'm tired of these like fed things.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.400]  They're like, I'm lit.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.400]  I'm lit.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.400]  Let me say I'm tired of these fed celebrities
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:16.400]  trying to pick on me thinking that they gangster.
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:18.400]  We're not in high school, Meek Mills.
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.400]  We're not in high school, Puff Daddy.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.400]  And everyone thinks that there's so much more gangster
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.400]  like they got me in some way.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:28.400]  Ain't none of y'all more gangster than God and God got me.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.400]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.400]  I'm saying that.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.400]  Oh, no.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.400]  Everybody poses an act of tough.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.400]  It's nothing.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:34.400]  You talk about rebel, black sheep.
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:36.400]  I mean, you're definitely it, buddy.
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.400]  Yeah, y'all not tough to me, but I'm drinking.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.400]  And then I start saying stuff that doesn't please God, right?
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.400]  And it wasn't the Zionists.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.400]  It wasn't the banks.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.400]  It's God sent me back.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:49.400]  But the fact that the fact that I still had 400 million
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.400]  and Forbes couldn't get around it.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.400]  It showed God loves me, but he just had to,
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.400]  he had to send me back a little.
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:56.400]  Well, it's a Jobein proverb.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.400]  You're going through a Jobein trial.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:00.400]  Yeah, because since I lost my wife, right?
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:04.400]  Since I lost my family and I was no longer the priest
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:05.400]  right in the middle of that home.
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.400]  And I didn't have to say so over the content that my kids watch
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.400]  and what they, and what they wore and where they went to school
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.400]  and how we went to church and what they ate.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.400]  I was frustrated and I let the devil come and get me.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.400]  I let the devil pull me in.
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:21.400]  Next thing you know, I'm at, I'm at New Year's Eve parties
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.400]  having threesomes.
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:26.400]  I'm like, God was so mad at me.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.400]  He said, I empowered you.
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:31.400]  I gave you every skill set.
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:32.400]  You're like Moses.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:35.400]  You saved Caesar's life in battle twice.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:37.400]  You know, you might stutter.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:40.400]  You might not be the best communicator, but you're a leader.
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:41.400]  Yeah.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:42.400]  And you're down there.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.400]  You're not representing me.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:46.400]  You're drinking, you're having sex.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.400]  And you know what?
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.400]  And God, he waited on me.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:52.400]  He let me go, you know, eight months into the year,
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:56.400]  but it wasn't until I bragged about serving Satan
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.400]  with the actions that God said,
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:01.400]  I got to set you back now and set you straight.
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:04.400]  And then, so we're moving my school,
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.400]  we're moving the Donda theology engineering university
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.400]  into a church.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.400]  And we were there talking with the pastor
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:14.400]  and then a homeless gentleman came in
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.400]  and was talking to us.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.400]  And I said, is this a plant?
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.400]  I don't know, but this was the greatest theologist
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:20.400]  that I've met.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.400]  And I had him come to a Bible study.
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:25.400]  We were, we were working on the walk to the house.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.400]  I don't like to call it a campaign.
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:28.400]  We're working to the walk to the house.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:29.400]  Yeah, hold on.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.400]  This is a hard break at the end of the hour.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:32.400]  Stations rejoin us.
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.400]  I skipped the other break.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:34.400]  We got to have this.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.400]  We're back in two minutes.
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.400]  We got to do this hard break.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.400]  And I asked, do you want to put a website out
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.400]  where people can actually hear what you have to say?
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:40.400]  I want you to remind me what I'm saying
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.400]  so I can give this explanation.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.400]  No, no, you told me on the phone the story.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.400]  I need to tell the people though.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:46.400]  No, no, you will.
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.400]  I'm going to remember.
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.400]  It's the amazing homeless guy comes in.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.400]  Yeah.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:50.400]  And he gives you this incredible word.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:51.400]  I don't care about the website.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.400]  I care about Jesus Christ and people knowing that.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.400]  I get it.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.400]  But they also got to know where to actually
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:56.400]  find what you're actually saying.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.400]  What you need to find is in the Bible.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.400]  My website is the Bible.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.400]  Nick, where do people find what you're doing?
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:05.400]  Cozy.tv slash Nick and the Bible.
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:06.400]  All right.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.400]  All right.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.400]  I'm just trying to like, all right.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:09.400]  Hey, it's all about free speech.
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.400]  We'll be right back.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:12.400]  Hour number three with yay and so many more.
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:15.400]  And we've got Owen Schreuer and Ollie Alexander
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.400]  loaded ready to go in the other studio.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.400]  10 feet through that wall.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.400]  So they're coming up hour number three
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:28.400]  with the most band broadcast in the world straight ahead.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:35.400]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.400]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:41.400]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.400]  up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.400]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:48.400]  in the store will be sold out.
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.400]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.400]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.400]  and get the biggest sales of the year.
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.400]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and Biotru Selenium
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.400]  and our Wake Up America award-winning coffee.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:03.400]  And now DNA Force Plus, Vitamemeral Fusion,
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:05.400]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:08.400]  So many other great products like Ultimate Crill Oil,
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:11.400]  Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso Beats, Secret 12.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:14.400]  They are all going to sell out in the next few weeks
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.400]  or in the next month.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.400]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:21.400]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:22.400]  at infowarstore.com.

[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:02.400]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.400]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:10.400]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:12.400]  He's actually a performance artist.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:14.400]  He's a performance artist.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.400]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:20.400]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:23.400]  and it's all based on a custody battle with my ex-wife
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:26.400]  five years ago and she was trying to put into evidence
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.400]  to be dressed up more than a decade before like the Joker.
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:32.400]  Being sarcastic saying, take your Prozac kids,
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:35.400]  take your illegal drugs too, you'll die, it's fun,
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.400]  so people wouldn't take drugs.
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.400]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.400]  They look, he's insane telling kids to use drugs.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:45.400]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:48.400]  of the Joker, no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:51.400]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:53.400]  Hail Cobra!
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:54.400]  Or Optimus Prime.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:56.400]  Come on, so let's roll.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.400]  Or the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all,
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:40:59.400]  really good.
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:00.400]  Or Darth Vader.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:03.400]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:07.400]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.400]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:10.400]  No.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.400]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime?
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.400]  Cobra Commander, the Joker, no.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:17.400]  And clearly, no reasonable person would think
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:20.400]  when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:22.400]  is what I really think.
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:25.400]  It's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.400]  By the Vaccinate Meow Moodle today.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.400]  It's required by the CDC.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.400]  But they play those games.
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:34.400]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.400]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:43.400]  They clip it out and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.400]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.400]  That man's a threat to this country.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:49.400]  And they go, look, he admitted in court, he's an actor.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:52.400]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.400]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.400]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:02.400]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host,
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:06.400]  up here reading news articles to you isn't a real thing
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:08.400]  and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:09.400]  And you know that.
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:10.400]  You're insulted right now.
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:12.400]  I'm even explaining that to you.
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:13.400]  And so am I.
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:16.400]  But that's who these people are.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:20.400]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.400]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.400]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.400]  He's smart.
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.400]  He's funny as hell.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:29.400]  He's truly funny.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.400]  I'm kind of retarded.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:43.400]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes,
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.400]  do you now not listen to what I say about other things
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.400]  when I show you a powerful news article
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:51.400]  by Dr. Joseph Mercola on infowars.com.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.400]  It has all the cited information.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.400]  The latest tragedy sudden adult death syndrome.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.400]  No, that's a real thing.
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:01.400]  That's something happening in the real world.
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:04.400]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.400]  I am Alex Jones.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:08.400]  And I am the guy on this show every day.
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.400]  I am an American.
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:13.400]  And that's what I promote is freedom and justice and liberty
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:16.400]  and they can't stand it.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:28.400]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:39.400]  Infowars has been banned.
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:43.400]  Arrested.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.400]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.400]  Because we are effective.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.400]  The great awakening is here.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:53.400]  Go to banned.video.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:57.400]  Download the videos and share.
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:05.400]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com.
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:09.400]  And never give up the fight.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:20.400]  Infowars.com
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:22.400]  Well, Ye's got his mask.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.400]  He's a superhero.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:26.400]  I represent the bad guys.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.400]  David Ike's little reptoids.
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:33.400]  So, now your enemies in here hosting the show with you, Ye.
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.400]  We got Nick Fuentes, one of my best buddies who works for us.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:38.400]  Does a really good job.
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:39.400]  He's over there with us.
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.400]  Oh, now he's turning to Alex Jones.
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:42.400]  So, what are we going to do here?
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.400]  Ye, the Balenciaga situation.
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.400]  You made a great point during a break earlier about it.
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.400]  They just need a new devil.
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.400]  But that's a devil to distract us from the fact that we become the devil.
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.400]  And that's kind of what you said.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:52.400]  Can you repeat that?
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:57.400]  Yeah, I just saw people making videos about it.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:01.400]  And I said, it just seems like it's just more noise
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.400]  than the way they have it.
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:07.400]  Cold red and things to get people outraged.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:17.400]  As I said before, every form of pornography is only one is only 10 years away from pedophilia.
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:22.400]  Anybody that's watching pornography, if you're watching a woman have sex on camera,
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:29.400]  she's reliving the trauma of being molested like a greater majority of women
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:34.400]  like strippers, prostitutes, or pornographers, adult film stars
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:39.400]  have gone through the trauma of experiencing pedophilia.
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:44.400]  But sex is a legal drug that's pushed to destroy humanity.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:49.400]  If you drive down the street in California, they will be pushing strip clubs.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:50.400]  They're pushing alcohol.
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:52.400]  They're pushing sex.
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:46:00.400]  So for people to have this moral code about pedophilia, but no moral code about strip clubs,
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.400]  pornography, and the sex industry, it's not what the Bible says.
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.400]  The Bible says that all of that is wrong.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:09.400]  So Jesus said so, or Jesus said no.
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:11.400]  That's when we just need to follow.
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.400]  Let me ask you this.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:13.400]  What about world population?
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.400]  The globalists say there's too many people.
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:16.400]  They want to sterilize us.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.400]  They want to promote transgenderism.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.400]  They want to depopulate us.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:21.400]  Do you think that that's accurate?
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:24.400]  Or what do you think of the New World Order and its overall agenda?
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:25.400]  I believe so.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:27.400]  I'm more of a gut feeling person.
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:29.400]  Like I said, I'm the battering ram.
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:34.400]  And you guys are the SWAT team to come in afterwards and then give the information.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:42.400]  God has people, different kind of warriors, different heights, different mindsets,
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.400]  different colors.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:50.400]  And our collective agenda needs to be to serve God and what we do.
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:54.400]  And we can't do that if we don't have an open free debate.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.400]  What did you say?
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:56.400]  I'm sorry.
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:57.400]  We can't do that if we don't have an open free debate.
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:58.400]  And that's what we have.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:46:59.400]  God brought us here.
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:01.400]  You created this platform, the Infilworth.
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:08.400]  I heard about the legend of Alex Jones from this lady named Tracy Romulus, Tracy Gwynn,
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:13.400]  who is faking like a Christian is really, you know what?
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:18.400]  Much love to Tracy Romulus and Tracy Gwynn because this is the type of person I will sue.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.400]  I'm just going to say I prefer that person not be next to my children.
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:25.400]  So much love and Jesus, God bless your family.
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:29.400]  I will prefer that that person be not next to my children.
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:30.400]  Next person.
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:31.400]  Next subject.
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:33.400]  Well, on Siaga, though, you were going to come in just overall.
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:34.400]  What are you going to show us?
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:35.400]  You were the lot of fashion brands.
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:36.400]  Now the stuff's come out.
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:39.400]  It's almost like they did this on purpose as a PR stunt.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:40.400]  I think so.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:44.400]  You know, I'm friends with the head designer.
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:49.400]  And I believe that it was a setup.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:50.400]  I think it was a hit job.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:56.400]  And now all of a sudden, everyone is so outraged and focused on Balenciaga.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.400]  But then we're still avoiding our kids.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.400]  We're still fornicating.
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:04.400]  We're still we're still killing each other.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.400]  We're still listening to music that promotes that.
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:09.400]  But oh, we don't we don't wear Balenciaga now.
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:11.400]  Shut the hell up.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:14.400]  You know, say that at the end of the day, what are you doing?
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.400]  You're throwing stones.
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:16.400]  Oh my God.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.400]  But you know, our moral code, we just we just cheated on our wives.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.400]  We just we just fornicated.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:24.400]  We just had three sums.
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:27.400]  We just bought some sex on Instagram.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.400]  We just sold some sex.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.400]  We use sex to sell a product, but we don't like Balenciaga.
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:32.400]  Shut up.
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:33.400]  Shut up.
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.400]  I'm throwing the tablets right now.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:36.400]  Shut up.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:40.400]  Instagram is about prostitution and everyone involved in any version of
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:43.400]  the sex business is as bad as the pedophile.
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:45.400]  So everyone shut up.
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:46.400]  Yeah.
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:47.400]  I'm listening.
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.400]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.400]  So I'm thinking of all the thousands of topics we can cover in a limited time.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.400]  We had was you're about to get on a plane and go back to another state and do some new stuff.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:57.400]  What else is on your radar because there's a lot.
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:58.400]  What do you think about the Ukraine war?
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:00.400]  What do you think about the devaluation of dollar?
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.400]  What do you think about FTX and Bitcoin?
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.400]  There's so many topics.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:04.400]  Nick.
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:09.400]  Well, yeah, in terms of Ukraine and Russia, I haven't really seen so much of
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.400]  that in the news.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:12.400]  I'm, of course, pro Putin.
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:14.400]  I'm very pro Russia.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:15.400]  I am also.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:16.400]  Let's go.
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:17.400]  Yeah.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:20.400]  You know, you see that this is just an extension of the United States,
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:23.400]  neocon establishment, New World Order type stuff.
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:27.400]  What does Putin say about America's value system?
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:32.400]  So he said in a speech when he annexed those two breakaway provinces and he annexed the
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.400]  Donbass, he said in a speech that we have totally abandoned traditional values,
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:40.400]  traditional faith, and we've actually embraced full on Satanism.
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:42.400]  And he's totally right.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:43.400]  That's true.
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:44.400]  America's embracing Satanism.
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:45.400]  Yeah.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.400]  But Jesus is alive and these things are going to pull.
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:51.400]  It's a movement.
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:54.400]  God, the devil is a defeated folk.
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:57.400]  We're not even going to speak any of that into existence.
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:02.400]  God runs the world and it's freedom fighters for Christ like us today that are going to
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.400]  stop it right now and say, we got to start here.
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:06.400]  That's one of us.
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.400]  We are the church.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.400]  We are the priests of our homes.
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:13.400]  All the men are the priests of the homes and everyone is the body of Christ.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:14.400]  And we start here.
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:21.400]  Sin, it's like we're a glass of water and sin is like throwing acid and use plastic and
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:22.400]  stepped on bugs in a glass.
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:25.400]  And then you want to pour some water in and it tastes, it tastes bad.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:29.400]  So what you want to, you want to cover it with an alcohol flavor or with some food coloring
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.400]  or with a sexy outfit or something.
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:35.400]  And then you want to just keep on drinking that sin and not understand why your stomach
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:36.400]  is hurting in the morning.
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:42.400]  And I know as a recovering alcoholic that, you know, a cure for a hangover is another
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:43.400]  drink.
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.400]  And that's basically what we've been doing.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.400]  We're all orphans.
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:47.400]  Keep doubling down.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.400]  Yeah.
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:50.400]  We're orphans of capitalism.
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:56.400]  So when we talk about the ideas that we have for the newer version, the amended constitution
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:59.400]  that me and Nick are rewriting and working on right now.
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:05.400]  And the ideas of purifying our system because we need will and expertise.
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:06.400]  Well, let's talk about that.
[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:08.400]  You're saying you're going to run for president 2024.
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:12.400]  I'm not, you know, Alex, you're really good at stating things in a way that you get you
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.400]  sued.
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:14.400]  So.
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:16.400]  No, I thought you were announcing for president, right?
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:19.400]  No, I'm not announcing on Alex.
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:20.400]  Love you.
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:21.400]  Love you.
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:22.400]  Love you.
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:28.400]  What I'm saying with the conversation that we're having about a possible 2024.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:33.400]  Walk and a victory at the office.
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:42.400]  America, I'm putting everything on the line for the truth to bring you a cleaner system.
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.400]  Our system has been dirtied and muddied and destroyed.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.400]  I am not the old.
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:54.400]  I am not the most knowledgeable Christian and I'm not the most knowledgeable politician,
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.400]  but I am truthful.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.400]  I'm nobody's heart.
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:00.400]  And I believe that what I was trying to get to is what is your platform?
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.400]  And you text me your platform.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:03.400]  It makes a lot of sense.
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:08.400]  Well, it's it starts here with the Bible and we're going to work through this with our
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:09.400]  designers.
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:14.400]  We're going to approach America like Steve Jobs, Jobs approached Apple.
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:19.400]  We are the youngest startup in history, but we're the world power because of our military
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:22.400]  and mainly because of our naval force.
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:26.400]  And it shows how smart and how powerful Americans are.
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.400]  The engineering, the sheer engineering.
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:29.400]  We invented Apple.
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:35.400]  We have the strongest military and now we have to take that same type of sensibility,
[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:41.400]  take it out of Wall Street's hands and give it to the people that engineering mind that
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:46.400]  created the trams that made Disney that made Pixar that made Lucas films that made Apple
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:48.400]  that engineering mind.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:53.400]  These minds that we have need are going to be brought together to cure America.
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:53:00.400]  And then we will influence the rest of the world into higher consciousness and into peace.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.400]  And I agree.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:03.400]  We were given that birthright and somehow it's been lost.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:04.400]  I want to talk about that.
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:08.400]  And after you leave soon, we're going to have Owen and everybody else and myself stay here
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:09.400]  and continue on and take calls.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:11.400]  And as long as you can stay, I know you got to go soon.
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:14.400]  But I wanted to bring in Owen Schreuer and Ali Alexander who helped get you here for
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:16.400]  their take and any questions they've got for you.
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.400]  Because you guys have great questions, great comments.
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.400]  So Owen Schreuer and Ali Alexander.
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:26.400]  I will, I'll hold my questions for you later because I kind of want to come in because
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:29.400]  we have a lot of eyes on this transmission right now.
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:32.400]  And there's a lot of people sharing their opinions on the internet with this right now.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:35.400]  And so I kind of just want to, you know, I just want to take a step back and just say,
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:39.400]  look, we're in a difficult realm with what we're doing here today, trying to balance
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:42.400]  fun and seriousness because we are serious people.
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:45.400]  We have serious missions and goals, but we also want to have fun.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:46.400]  We don't want to hate life.
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:49.400]  We want to enjoy life and we want other people to enjoy life.
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:53.400]  And when I see the response on the internet from the haters and the people getting angry
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:56.400]  today, I'm just, I'm just a little perturbed.
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.400]  Let ye speak.
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:53:59.400]  Let the man speak.
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:03.400]  You may not agree with what he has to say, but why don't you want him to speak?
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:04.400]  I don't get it.
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:05.400]  Same thing with Alex Jones.
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:07.400]  Why don't you want Alex to speak?
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:08.400]  What is wrong with you?
[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:09.400]  Why are you so angry?
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.400]  Why are you so serious all the time?
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.400]  If you don't like what they say, tune it out.
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:14.400]  But here's what gets me, Alex.
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:16.400]  This is what, this is what bothers me.
[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:19.400]  It's bothered me with the attacks on you over the years.
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:21.400]  It bothers me with the attacks we see on ye today.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:24.400]  Whether you agree with everything he said or disagree with everything he said, let's
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:26.400]  get our priorities straight here.
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:27.400]  Okay.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:31.400]  If you're upset with what Kanye West has said today, let me remind you that Kanye West,
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:35.400]  excuse me, ye, let me, let me, let me correct that.
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:39.400]  Ye, if you're upset with anything ye has said here today, ye is not the person in Chicago
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:43.400]  shooting people every night, teenagers, innocent people dying.
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:48.320]  Ye is not the person in DC in Congress selling this country out for decades.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:54.080]  Ye is not the person with big pharma that's killed millions of people with their products.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:58.480]  It's all come out in court that still has influence to mandate their products on the
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:54:59.480]  people.
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:00.480]  That's not ye.
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:06.800]  Ye is not the one that's lying us into wars where millions of people die and trillions
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:07.800]  get spent.
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:12.920]  So for all the backlash, all the huffing and puffing that we're gonna see from this interview
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:16.520]  and the next 48 hours, you're all clowns.
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:17.520]  You're all clowns.
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:23.040]  If this interview upsets you, your priorities are so out of whack and I don't even think
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:27.960]  you have the capability to enjoy life anymore and you need to take a serious look and reflection
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:28.960]  in the view.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:29.960]  Well, they're against free will.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:32.120]  They're against free open discussion, which shows they're evil.
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:36.520]  And anyone going along with censoring somebody's speech is a fraud and enemy of the people.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:38.200]  But we are, the people are not evil.
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:42.200]  It's Satan that controls the people and puts demonic blocks.
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:46.440]  So when you see the truth in front of you, you can't even hold the truth.
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:47.560]  Like it's demonic blocks.
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:52.040]  I can go to Kim and say, hey, put your family first.
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:54.000]  You have someone who loves you.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  Put us first.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.080]  Put your children's first.
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:02.680]  And it's demonic blocks, bringing her into traumatic, you know, everything, however she
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:04.040]  was pushing to the sex tape.
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:09.280]  She's pushing to saying that she had sex with Pete Davidson in front of a fireplace.
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:11.240]  Hulu does not love you, Kim.
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:12.880]  Disney does not love you, Kim.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:13.880]  Come home, Kim.
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.120]  Come home to Christ.
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:16.120]  Go to God.
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:21.280]  Go to Jesus because you saying you might not ever, or marry somebody, great, go, go marry
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:26.880]  Tom Brady, whatever you want to do, but get married and use your platform as an influence
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:29.200]  to keep families together.
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:34.360]  Don't let the devil use you and those people that are out there mad at the ability for
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:36.320]  us to say things for consciousness.
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:38.760]  We have to, I have to think, okay, white lives matter.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:40.120]  I'm going to do a t-shirt.
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:41.120]  I'm going to make it.
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:42.120]  You understand?
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:47.040]  What culture is controlled by the Zionist media, making people mad, outraged, going
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:48.040]  out the street.
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:49.040]  We're so outraged.
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:53.080]  But you're not doing anything yourself to change it and follow God and follow Christ.
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:56.280]  We haven't said anything against the word of God today.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:57.920]  God says love everyone.
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:04.080]  So if I say, I love the Zionists that cancel my account, then I could say, I love, I did
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:05.080]  not consent.
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:06.080]  I do love Hitler.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:07.480]  I do love the Zionists.
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:09.760]  I love everyone.
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:12.560]  The Zionists cannot tell me who I can love and not love.
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:13.840]  I don't think like that.
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:16.960]  I think more like someone that's on the spectrum.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:20.480]  Since that's what they want to claim, well, let me be on the spectrum of love because
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:21.920]  that's a good t-shirt.
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:22.920]  I love Hitler.
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:23.920]  Bar.
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:24.920]  That's a bar.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:25.920]  I'm joking.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:29.320]  I love, I love Zionists too.
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:30.680]  I love Zionists.
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:31.680]  We love everyone.
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:34.440]  You're just saying love humanity and stop getting past the labels.
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:35.440]  Love is the key.
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:39.720]  Everyone's promoting this loathing and it's time to promote love.
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.720]  No, I hear you.
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.280]  Let's bring in Ollie Alexander who helped get this done.
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:44.840]  Ollie, I've known you for years, but this is quite the broadcast.
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:48.840]  This is definitely so far in 2022, the biggest broadcast of the year.
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:49.840]  This is it.
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:50.840]  Yeah.
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:51.840]  Don't put this on me, Ricky Bobby.
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:52.840]  That's right.
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:54.840]  If you're not first, you're last.
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:55.840]  Come on.
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:56.840]  Ollie, you're on air.
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:57.840]  Give us your take on this.
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:57:58.840]  No, no.
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:57:59.840]  I mean, this is great.
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:03.680]  Look, I love everybody on screen and I love them and I like them and I frankly, I endorse
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:04.680]  them.
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:06.520]  And I think that what Owen said is absolutely right.
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:10.160]  It's like you can look at this interview and you can be triggered.
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:16.920]  You can engage your ego and say, yay, endorsed genocide when he didn't.
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:24.480]  You can look at this broadcast and say, Nicholas Fuentes is a 23, 24-year-old secret dog whistling
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:27.640]  KKK Nazi, but that's also not the case.
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:31.920]  You could say that Alex Jones and Owen Shroyer are actually platforming hate, but that's
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:33.520]  not what's going on at all.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:37.160]  And I think what's powerful about this broadcast, and I really think that we're making narrative
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:40.480]  history, is that we're breaking the Overton window.
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:43.080]  The Republican establishment sold us out.
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:45.440]  The conservative movement sold us out.
[01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:47.560]  The churches, they closed.
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:51.200]  So when we looked for leadership on the right, there was none, okay?
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:56.440]  When Owen Shroyer got charged, when Ollie Alexander got sued and investigated, Alex, when you
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:01.360]  got sued, did we get a call from our logo saying, hey, I'm a billionaire and I want
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.520]  to help fund what you guys have been through?
[01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:04.520]  For me?
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:05.520]  No, we didn't.
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:10.080]  So here we are left with the last option on Info Wars, the home of the resistance, and
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:14.040]  we're a bunch of pseudo-celebrities with one celebrity saying, okay, well, then we're
[01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:15.720]  just going to break the chessboard.
[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:18.240]  We're getting off your chessboard because it is rigged.
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:19.720]  It's rigged by Lucifer.
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:21.160]  It's rigged by the Satanist.
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:25.040]  It is rigged by the Jewish mafia, and people don't want to say that.
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:28.640]  It's rigged by the Marxists and the leftists and all of these people.
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:33.080]  And it's actually, frankly, rigged by people who would betray Christ within the church,
[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:34.400]  the apostates.
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:40.080]  So I think that this broadcast should encourage everybody to take everyone else just at their
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:45.000]  word, only use what they're saying, take it in good faith and in the best light, and stop
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.320]  relying on the ADL and the SPLC or Twitter trends.
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:50.640]  In fact, Elon should get rid of Twitter trends.
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:52.960]  There shouldn't be editorial little comments.
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:54.200]  Well, they always control it anyways.
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:55.200]  We hit number one.
[01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.200]  They took it off.
[01:59:56.200 --> 02:00:01.280]  And that, what about the biomedical mafia, the big pharma, it's the King Daddy with
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:02.280]  the central banks.
[02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:05.720]  You know, it's my only concern about, it's talking about certain other elites.
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:10.560]  How about the big corporate elite that all links up with one agenda, yeah?
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:12.080]  Jesus runs the world.
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:18.520]  Elon needs to put Alex Jones back on the platform because I don't agree with someone
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:22.480]  that doesn't believe in Christ saying, you're cool, you're cool, you're cool, not you.
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:23.960]  And this is my friend, right?
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:25.120]  This is my boy.
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:26.600]  We can agree to Chris agree, right?
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:27.600]  But it's still his platform.
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:28.600]  It's up to him.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:32.000]  But also, I'm not a person that's going to say, hey, I agree with everything.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.920]  There's things that I said today that you guys don't agree with because you're not in
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:39.160]  the same place or in the same position in your walk that I'm at.
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:45.360]  I'm in a position where I love the person who, the doctor that had plastic surgery on
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:46.360]  my mom.
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:49.480]  I always have been on a way where it's, I can't hate.
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:51.280]  You said your mother was sacrificed.
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:52.440]  Can you elaborate on that?
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:56.040]  Yeah, I believe that Michael Jordan's dad was sacrificed.
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:59.920]  I believe, didn't something happen with Tiger Woods?
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:04.680]  My mom, these are all Zionist sacrifices that happen.
[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:06.520]  But this is Satan at the end of the day.
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:10.720]  There's a lot of people that feel like we're at the end of days.
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:12.720]  And Jesus runs the world.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:13.720]  God runs the world.
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:16.280]  Jesus is the real king of Israel.
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:20.160]  And I'm just a simple servant of God.
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:21.920]  I'm not a mathematician.
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:22.920]  No, no.
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:23.920]  I hear you.
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:27.400]  You said white lives matter because I think you, I'm going to put words in your mouth.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:30.720]  You understood that they're trying to demonize white people to create a crisis and for us
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:31.720]  to fight with each other.
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:32.720]  I thought that was very true.
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:33.720]  I think all lives matter.
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:35.040]  But you went even stronger and said white lives matter.
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:36.040]  You got criticized for that.
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:37.640]  Can you elaborate on that?
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:41.400]  Yeah, I thought that, I thought that that was my right.
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:48.280]  I felt that I, I just exercise rights that are only given to whites.
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:52.960]  A white person can wear a t-shirt that says black lives matter, but for a black person
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:57.640]  to wear a t-shirt that says white lives matter, that somehow makes me racist.
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:01.600]  So I love just going up and saying, Hey, what do you think about this?
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:03.000]  What about that?
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:09.360]  And if we don't use, if we don't use our consciousness, they're trying to beat us into our consciousness
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:10.480]  and make us ignorant.
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:12.480]  They want to dumb us down.
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:19.560]  And I'm probably the lowest IQ here of anyone speaking, and I'm saying, say out loud what
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:24.520]  we feel we would no longer be ran by the idea of fake influence in celebrities.
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:25.520]  I did.
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:26.520]  Yeah, I'm going to interrupt you.
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:27.520]  No, no, no, no, no, hold on.
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:28.520]  Alex, don't interrupt me.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:29.520]  I didn't know.
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:31.760]  I didn't announce every celebrity.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:35.640]  I didn't announce every celebrity I ever stood next to.
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:36.640]  God bless you.
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:39.360]  And you know, that's the Christian word of what I really want to say.
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:45.240]  Every celebrity, only celebrity that I rock with is Ray J. Literally every, every one of
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:49.920]  y'all others y'all all saw come see me when y'all want to see me.
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:56.560]  Every fake gangster, so-called killer, any basketball player, any rapper, any actress,
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:03.480]  any musician, any model, any editor, come see me, come see God's child right now.
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:04.480]  Please.
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:05.480]  I want it.
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:07.240]  I want, I want to see my mama.
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.240]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.160]  You can't touch in Jesus' name, baby.
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:16.320]  I was going to say this, though, I want to be clear.
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:17.920]  You say you have the lowest IQ of anybody here.
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:19.120]  I'm not kissing your ass.
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:20.720]  Yeah, that's not true.
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:21.720]  There's different types.
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:22.960]  IQ is just one test.
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:23.960]  It's one thing.
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.160]  There's, there's, there's cultural IQ.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:27.160]  There's mathematical.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:28.160]  There's spiritual.
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:32.160]  There's, there's, there's economic savant, there's art savant.
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:35.640]  And I can tell you, I'm an idiot savant.
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:36.640]  That's a French word.
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:37.640]  Doesn't mean I'm actually an idiot.
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.440]  It means that I don't know a lot of stuff, but things I know, I know.
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:42.920]  Like I don't even get into it, folks, but it's, it's ridiculous.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:43.920]  Okay.
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.640]  I can wake up at 2 a.m. to 5 a.m.
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:47.520]  I can see in Cardi also.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:49.720]  And I can tell you what time the clock's going to say before I look at it.
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:51.120]  The little weird thing I can do.
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:55.520]  The point is, is that, is that, is that there's savant that actually bring the world to the
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:56.520]  next level.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:59.320]  And I think people need to take that for what it is.
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:04.520]  I wouldn't call you autistic, but you are, have a savantish thing about you.
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:06.160]  And I think that's a positive, not a negative.
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:07.960]  Nick, you want to say anything?
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:08.960]  You want to say anything?
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:09.960]  Ollie or Owen?
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:10.960]  And Fabio.
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:11.960]  Yeah.
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:12.960]  Yeah.
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:15.800]  I want to say this, you know, this is a story that, that Yay shared.
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:18.720]  I'm not even going to ask permission because he said he's nobody's hard drive, so I'm nobody's
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:19.720]  hard drive.
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:23.560]  You know, Yay was hanging out with Elon and Elon was sitting there and they were under
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:24.560]  a rocket launch.
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:28.800]  And Elon says to Yay, you know, you have the highest EQ.
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:30.600]  So there's also the EQ.
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:35.640]  And what I think Yay is talking about is like, we've assembled a powerful group of Avengers.
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:39.240]  We have different experiences, different expertise.
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:44.680]  We, in fact, even interpret information differently, but we've all got a superpower and we've got
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:49.120]  to contribute it to taking down the perma state, the deep state, the globalist, whatever
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:52.920]  anybody wants to call this, you know, this group that's running us, this depopulation
[02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:53.920]  group.
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:56.520]  We've got to, you know, rage war against the machine.
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:00.400]  If everybody rushes to get canceled, they can cancel none of us.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:04.960]  And so I think that today, again, is a historic day in which it's not about agreement.
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:07.760]  It's in agreement and disagreement against them.
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:12.160]  No, I agree that this is about saying free speech is sacrosanct.
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:15.760]  And even you disagree with something, it should be celebrated instead of demonizing.
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:18.080]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let me let me interrupt here.
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:20.840]  And Nick is actually the person who's talked best about this.
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:27.680]  And this is where I think that like Laura Loomer, who is a Zionist Jew, conservative and patriot,
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:33.280]  and then you, who are kind of libertarian or conservatarian and and Owen's kind of conservatarian
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:37.540]  would disagree with Nick and I, who, you know, might be in more of the Catholic tradition.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:41.680]  We would totally support blasphemy laws totally, you know, and I don't want to speak for him.
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:45.760]  But, you know, what Nick points out is that you have to have a right to dissent.
[02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:50.680]  That is way more powerful than, you know, move free speech, where we're actually rigging
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:54.920]  the system to have what yeah, he's talking about Instagram and we're going to come right
[02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:55.920]  back to you in a moment.
[02:05:55.920 --> 02:06:00.120]  Yeah, he wants me to tweet on his giant with 35 million viewers, 36.
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:03.720]  Yeah, we're going to have Alex Jones, uh, put it up for my Twitter.
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:04.720]  Hi, Ari Emanuel.
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:05.720]  How's it going?
[02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:07.720]  How's, how's your wife's clothing line?
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:09.720]  Hey, let's do an overhead shot here, please guys.
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:10.720]  So I can do this.
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:11.920]  I haven't tweeted so long.
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:12.920]  I hardly remember how this works.
[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:14.920]  You guys do an overhead shot for me?
[02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:15.920]  All right.
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:25.400]  So this is a yay's phone here and I just want to say I love, love L-O-V-V.
[02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:26.400]  Jews.
[02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:27.400]  That's true.
[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:28.400]  You want to say that?
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:29.400]  It's true.
[02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:30.400]  It's true.
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:31.400]  I do love them.
[02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:34.400]  First, how do you say amendment AMT?
[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:36.400]  What's the abbreviation?
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:38.400]  Um, AMDT, I think.
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:39.400]  Not sure.
[02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:40.400]  Yeah.
[02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:41.400]  I got it.
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:42.400]  I love the first amendment.
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:45.400]  Uh, long live.
[02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:46.400]  Yay.
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:51.400]  Got to capitalize that though.
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:53.400]  All right.
[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:54.400]  I'm going to tweet that.
[02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:56.240]  I love the first amendment.
[02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:57.240]  Long live.
[02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:58.240]  Yay.
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:06:59.240]  I hope.
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:00.240]  No, no, no.
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:01.240]  No, we're going to pray.
[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:02.240]  No hoping.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:03.240]  We pray.
[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:04.240]  No, I pray.
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:14.240]  I pray Elon, Elon is for real.
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:15.240]  No.
[02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:16.240]  Pray to God.
[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:17.240]  Not to Elon.
[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:18.240]  Pray to God.
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:19.240]  I pray to God.
[02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:20.240]  I agree.
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.800]  I pray to Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
[02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:24.800]  Say his name.
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:25.800]  There's power.
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:37.400]  I pray the name Jesus, I pray to Jesus that that that Elon is for real.
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:38.400]  What is it?
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:39.400]  What do you mean by for real?
[02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:40.400]  What does that mean?
[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:41.400]  For real about what?
[02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:42.400]  Be more trying to free up the internet.
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:43.400]  Right that.
[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:44.400]  Right.
[02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:45.400]  I believe it.
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:46.600]  Jesus.
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:51.320]  That Apple doesn't de-platform Elon for freeing the internet.
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:52.320]  I hope he's for real.
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:53.320]  No.
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:57.360]  I think that Apple doesn't de-platform Elon for freeing the internet.
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.360]  He just met with him.
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:07:59.360]  He says he's not now.
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:00.360]  But I hear you.
[02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:03.200]  And then dot, dot, dot.
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:05.840]  I love the First Amendment, long live ye.
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:08.400]  I pray to Jesus that Elon is for real.
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:09.400]  Bam.
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.400]  I'm back on Twitter.
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:11.400]  Back on Twitter, baby.
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:12.400]  There you go.
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:13.400]  Give it to him now.
[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:14.400]  Here you go, buddy.
[02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:15.400]  It's a twin test.
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:17.520]  35 million or whatever it is, followers.
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:19.520]  This is great ideas you're having, man.
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:22.120]  Hey, I have a few good ideas.
[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:23.120]  I believe.
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:24.120]  Let me talk for a second.
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:25.120]  Don't cut me off.
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:26.120]  I have a few good ideas.
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:34.380]  I have ideas that surpass the idea of just being a black face for the Trump administration.
[02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:37.480]  Just being Elon's cool friend at a concert.
[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:40.440]  I actually have real ideas, Tim Cook.
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:42.560]  I actually have real ideas.
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:45.520]  And I get marginalized into these places.
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:50.720]  And I understand people are afraid of the truth, the best EQ on the planet.
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:56.480]  When I went to people like David Simon and Jamie Salter and all these Jewish businessmen,
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:00.280]  they would offer me things like, hey, we'll give you one store.
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:01.640]  And I got frustrated.
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:05.640]  I got frustrated with the gap, with Adidas, of being held back.
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:09.080]  And people act like they're going to help you, but they really control you like how
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:13.440]  Jamie Salter controls Shaquille O'Neal or the NBA controls Shaquille O'Neal.
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:16.040]  And this is nothing, no knock to our brother.
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:19.440]  All black people feel the way I feel, but nobody wants to go broke.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:24.360]  No one else can take a $2 billion hit and still have $400 million.
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:28.160]  So that's God putting me in a position to be able to fight battles that other people
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:29.260]  can't fight.
[02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:31.880]  But the people, the real people, they're standing up.
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:32.880]  They're talking.
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:35.000]  The problem- How can anybody disagree with this?
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  It's awesome.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  There you go.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  All right.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  Now we got Ali Alexander.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.200]  Everybody's hunched over the tweet command base.
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:42.200]  What are you tweeting?
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:43.200]  Let's see.
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:44.200]  How about this?
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:45.200]  Can we shift the camera over there, guys?
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:46.200]  I know it's hard.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:47.200]  Yeah.
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.040]  King, America first.
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:52.040]  What else?
[02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:53.040]  Death of the New World Order.
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:54.040]  No, no, no death.
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:55.040]  That's God's battle.
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:56.040]  Even politically.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:57.040]  Okay.
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:58.040]  Yes.
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:01.760]  Well, it'll be a little self-serving, don't visit infowords.com.
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:02.760]  Alex Jones is right.
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:03.760]  I should say that.
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:05.480]  I like the infowords part, actually.
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:06.480]  How about Groyper?
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:07.480]  How's that?
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:10.680]  Well, your Groyper thing, but also say, don't visit infowords.com.
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:11.680]  Groyper.
[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:12.680]  Okay.
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:13.680]  I'll tag myself.
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:14.680]  There we go.
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:17.360]  You're supposed to say the infowords, he told you to.
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:18.360]  I put what he put about Jesus.
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:19.360]  Should I put infowords?
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:20.360]  Put infowords.
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:21.360]  Don't visit infowords.com.
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:22.360]  Don't visit.
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:23.360]  No, yes.
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:28.000]  Do all, the way that you, as a master of the universe, the way that you push ideas forward
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.200]  is all positive affirmations.
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:32.600]  I'm glad that billions of you are going to visit infowords.
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:33.600]  Yeah.
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:34.760]  I'm glad that billions are going to visit infowords.
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:39.800]  Ari and Manuel, if your wife needs any help on her creative direction for a line, I will
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:40.840]  gladly help you.
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:45.520]  Even though you tried to destroy my life, I will help your wife on the creative direction
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:49.560]  and I will not do anything un-Christian when we're in the room together.
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:50.560]  In Jesus' name.
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:54.760]  Ari, if you want me to help your wife with her line, I'm here.
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:55.760]  Okay.
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:56.760]  What did you put out?
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:57.760]  We're going to put it on screen.
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:00.920]  I put out Christ is King, America first, Groyper.
[02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:01.920]  And then I put.
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:02.920]  Beautiful.
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:03.920]  Bible.com.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:04.920]  Beautiful.
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:05.920]  Did you put the infowords thing?
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:06.920]  He did.
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:07.920]  He did.
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:08.920]  That's good.
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:09.920]  I'll give him a heart attack.
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:10.920]  That's great.
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:11.920]  Can I get this real quick?
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:12.940]  I'm going to get this real quick.
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:13.940]  Yeah.
[02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:17.280]  By the way, anytime you're just flying over, you want to land, come on the show.
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:18.880]  We'll do it once a week.
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:22.360]  I think I'm going to write about the J6 victims.
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:23.360]  I think that.
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:24.480]  We should think about Tim.
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:26.480]  Jay did more.
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:27.480]  We got to.
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:28.480]  Oh, yeah.
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:29.480]  We got the camera.
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:32.000]  So, Jay did more than the Republican establishment, than the conservative establishment.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  Come sit in my chair.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  Come sit in my chair.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  Come sit in my chair.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.040]  I'll be back in two minutes.
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:39.240]  Go ahead, I'm listening.
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:44.480]  So Yay did more than the Republican establishment and the conservative movement to highlight
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:48.960]  the due process abuses and the torture and Laura, could you stop calling while we're
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:49.960]  live on air?
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:54.360]  I mean, my gosh, girl, you know, she's on the spectrum too.
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:55.840]  She's got that, you know, with you.
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:59.120]  But so I think that we need to talk about the J6 victim.
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:19.280]  So let's all caps investigate the civil rights and due process violations of the J6 political
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:26.480]  prisoners.
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:37.560]  Why were the only people killed, unarmed protesters?
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:13:00.560]  That day, free Alex, free Nick, Nicholas, free speech, free speech, and free Ali, Boombay
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:07.520]  a Boombay, a Boombay, a, I don't, yeah, it's, I don't know if that's
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:08.520]  it.
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:09.520]  Ducking autocorrect.
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:10.520]  Sweet.
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:11.520]  There we go.
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:16.320]  Did we get the overhead of that?
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:18.520]  Let's get the team to get the camera.
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:19.520]  Get the camera.
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:20.520]  I love the crew.
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:21.520]  I love the crew.
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:22.520]  But get the camera.
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:23.520]  Zoom in.
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:24.520]  That's what I want.
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:25.520]  Get the mask.
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:26.520]  Get the mask.
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:27.520]  Get the mask.
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:28.520]  Get the mask.
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:29.520]  Get the mask.
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:30.520]  Oh, you want me to redo the skit?
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:31.520]  Yeah, do it.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:32.520]  All right.
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:33.520]  I love this crew.
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:39.520]  So sometimes, sometimes they could just be stubborn, zoom in overhead shot, zoom in overhead
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:40.520]  shot.
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:41.520]  I'm sorry.
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:42.520]  I'm just a retard.
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:43.520]  We love Alex.
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:44.520]  Who else would let us do this?
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:45.520]  All right.
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:46.520]  We got to do this time.
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:47.520]  Thank you very much, Ali.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:48.520]  I want to go back to Owen quick and welcome Sarah as long as he wants, but then we've got
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:49.520]  a lot of big stuff going on.
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:50.520]  A great idea.
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:51.520]  Have them folks tweet out.
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:52.520]  Allegedly.
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:53.520]  What else do you want to tweet?
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:54.520]  Yeah, who knows?
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:55.520]  Maybe Kanye.
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:56.520]  Maybe yay was never here.
[02:13:56.520 --> 02:14:04.520]  It's never a disrespect when I call you Kanye.
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:07.520]  I've just been calling you there for 15 years.
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:10.520]  So it's like, you call him my, you know, my brother or something.
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:11.520]  They changed his name.
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:12.520]  But yay is even better.
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:13.520]  And it's definitely taken, taken hold.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:14.520]  I think it's an awesome name.
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:16.520]  But, but, but seriously, yay.
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:17.520]  What else do you want to tweet out to folks?
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:20.520]  Is everything right now is going super mega total viral?
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:22.520]  What is your message to Trump right now?
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:25.520]  What's your message to the Santas right now?
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:27.520]  I don't know who the Santas is.
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:30.520]  I never heard of the guy.
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:31.520]  No, I hear you.
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:33.520]  Well, all the elites back in the Santas gives me a lot of concern.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:34.520]  Exactly.
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:36.520]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:38.520]  It's like we love Trump.
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:40.520]  We love yay.
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:41.520]  That's right.
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:42.520]  Yeah.
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:43.520]  No, I'm with you.
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:46.520]  It's yay and Trump and anybody going for DeSantis or McCarthy.
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:48.520]  That's just not the energy.
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:49.520]  That's not the vibe.
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:50.520]  That's not MAGA.
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:51.520]  That's not Jesus energy.
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:53.520]  That's not dragon energy.
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:59.520]  So, and I like what you said about people need to just put it all on the line and finally tell the truth.
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:00.520]  That's the problem.
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:01.520]  Here's the bottom line.
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:02.520]  You're not a white supremacist.
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:04.520]  I've heard a senior show.
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:05.520]  You love everybody.
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:06.520]  You stand up for white people.
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:08.520]  Everybody should stand up for themselves and everybody else.
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:10.520]  It's a load of crap that you're a white supremacist.
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:11.520]  True.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:12.520]  Yeah.
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:13.520]  Did you help round up Jews like George Soros?
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:14.520]  No.
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:15.520]  Okay.
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:16.520]  Well, then I don't want to hear anything.
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:17.520]  Yeah.
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:18.520]  I don't hear anything from the ADL or anybody else.
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:22.520]  But for the ADL, I want to say there's a lot of good Nazis that were just fighting for their country.
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:24.520]  And for them all...
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:25.520]  Like George Soros.
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:27.520]  For them all to get put in a box.
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:30.520]  They're all in a box.
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:32.520]  Every Nazi is bad.
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:36.520]  Well, could some of the Nazis have just been fighting for their country?
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:39.520]  Oh, we can't put them all in a box.
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:40.520]  No, I get it.
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:42.520]  You're explaining that, like you said, you love the Zionists.
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:46.520]  You don't agree with some of the things they're doing, even though you don't support a lot of what's happening.
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:50.520]  Seriously, I've really studied a lot of history, plus I had family that was there.
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:52.520]  I mean, I don't think Hitler was a good guy.
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:55.520]  I get the Hugo Boss uniforms.
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:56.520]  Amazing.
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:02.520]  But I mean, just because you're in love with the design, you're a designer, can we just kind of say, like, you like the uniforms, but that's about it.
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:04.520]  No, we know.
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:09.520]  There's a lot of things that I love about Hitler.
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:11.520]  A lot of things.
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:16.520]  Hey, Netton, what did you think about that, Netton?
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:18.520]  This is insane.
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:20.520]  You are an insane person.
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:21.520]  How could you say so?
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:22.520]  It's OK then.
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:25.520]  So let me ask you, you like the Azog Battalion because they openly howl Hitler.
[02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:27.520]  They're the leftovers of World War II.
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:29.520]  They support Zelensky and attacking Russia.
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:31.520]  So you like the Azog Battalion?
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:33.520]  I love everyone.
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:37.520]  Well, my point is, if you weren't involved with Hitler, you didn't do anything.
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:42.520]  So having the ADL say anybody that opposes communism and the New World Order is a Nazi.
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:44.520]  Well, you kind of get what you give, you know?
[02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:46.520]  No one cares about the ADL.
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:47.520]  They're played out.
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:50.520]  Well, they ran Twitter till last week.
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:52.520]  They don't run anything.
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:53.520]  No one knows the ADL.
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:54.520]  No one cares.
[02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:55.520]  They're played out.
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:57.520]  Look at, people have had a problem.
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:16:58.520]  Look at Clockwork Warns.
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:04.520]  There's a part where a Jewish guy makes the guy kiss the shoe and he says, kiss the Jew.
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:10.520]  Like, people have had issues with Jewish people forever, but what I'm saying is I love Jewish people.
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:11.520]  I love Jewish people.
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:13.520]  Yes, we're talking about Stanley Kubrick.
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:15.520]  Put the war room background up in there.
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:18.520]  You think Clockwork Warns is about Jews?
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:19.520]  Absolutely.
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:20.520]  Look at it.
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:21.520]  I thought it was about a collapse.
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:23.520]  You know, Stanley Kubrick was a Jew.
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:24.520]  Oh, wow.
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:25.520]  I know his daughter.
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:26.520]  He was a great guy.
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:27.520]  Yeah.
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:29.520]  So, I mean, he made Dr. Strangelove.
[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:32.520]  I mean, I got to be honest with you.
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:39.520]  I see incredible literature and art and music and just so many great, so much great stuff Jews do.
[02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:40.520]  Just like, I see so many great things.
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:41.520]  Black people do or any other group.
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:43.520]  Like, you know, Beethoven's German.
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:44.520]  I don't blame Beethoven for Hitler.
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:46.520]  And I believe in free speech.
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:48.520]  What about Wagner?
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:50.520]  Well, they demonize Wagner because only because Hitler liked it.
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:53.520]  Or Adi Dossler or Hugo Boss.
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:56.520]  We have all this demonization.
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:17:58.520]  We don't care anymore, ADL.
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:00.520]  Obviously, no one cares.
[02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:01.520]  Shut up.
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:02.520]  No one cares.
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:03.520]  Jesus is king.
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:04.520]  Shut up.
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:05.520]  It's done tomorrow.
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:06.520]  It's all the next day.
[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:09.520]  You know, German cars do break down and it costs a lot of money to fix.
[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:12.520]  Germans make really good cars.
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:14.520]  I think the Japanese make better ones.
[02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:17.520]  Germans had a really cool leader at one time.
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:18.520]  Oh, my God.
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:25.520]  Look, I drive mainly American cars, but when it comes to company cars, it's a couple of toyotas because the damn things don't break.
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:27.520]  I mean, it is ridiculous.
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:31.520]  You know, the Japanese bitch to the globalist groups, they want to make light bulbs go 100 years.
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:32.520]  They want to make cars never break.
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:33.520]  You know, they can do that.
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:34.520]  The Japanese are pissed.
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:36.520]  That's why they've not said they're for electric cars.
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:38.520]  They go, these don't work.
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:39.520]  It takes more carbon.
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:40.520]  Why are you doing this?
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:42.520]  That's what needs to be broken.
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:43.520]  You get what I'm saying?
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:51.520]  It's like, I want to say with Ben Shapiro, he was so disrespectful to his employee, Candace Owens, for speaking out against me.
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:55.520]  And that just showed you another level of this kind of control that's out there.
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:56.520]  No, I agree.
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:57.520]  I like Candace.
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:18:58.520]  She has a lot of courage.
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:18:59.520]  She's a really smart, beautiful lady.
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:01.520]  She's really defended you.
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:04.520]  But I mean, are you saying Ben Shapiro's got her on a leash?
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:09.520]  I think it's pretty obvious.
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:12.520]  You know, as our Paul Watson, we didn't launch her.
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:15.520]  She deserved it, but implores launch Candace Owens.
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:16.520]  Yes.
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:19.520]  But everyone is still controlled by the Jewish media.
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:22.520]  We need to serve Christ first.
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:23.520]  Christ first.
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:24.520]  Everyone.
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:25.520]  Period.
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:26.520]  Okay.
[02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:27.520]  But you say the Jewish media.
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:28.520]  Let me just bring up a real world example.
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.520]  I'm not just, I'm trying to get the figure.
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:31.520]  I only met Matt Drudge once.
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:33.520]  He came here, hung out a few hours and went to dinner.
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:34.520]  He's Jewish.
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:35.520]  I never asked for anything.
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:36.520]  He never told me what to do.
[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:40.520]  He only sent a few emails here and there to writers saying, Hey, you know,
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:42.520]  when you break something, email it to me.
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:45.520]  And he was a Jewish guy that totally helped us go to the next level.
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:48.520]  We would have been successful without him, but he, he liked super charged it.
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:51.520]  Then suddenly he flips the other side, never talked to him again.
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:53.520]  And his website's like a Democrat hellscape.
[02:19:53.520 --> 02:19:57.520]  But I'm just saying it's like, I've known a lot of Jews in my life and I didn't
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:19:59.520]  have the Hollywood experience you had.
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:05.520]  Actually, all the Jews in my life overall were very nice people is all I'm saying.
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:08.520]  I'm, I'm actually tired of hearing about the Jews.
[02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:09.520]  Like I love them.
[02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:12.520]  Honestly, I don't even care that much.
[02:20:12.520 --> 02:20:15.520]  You know, but we spent the last three out two hours talking about them.
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:16.520]  Cause it's fun.
[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:17.520]  It's fun.
[02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:18.520]  You don't want to hear about them.
[02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:21.520]  We want to talk about them all because being canceled is fun because we're
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:23.520]  showing you guys the extent that you can go, right?
[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:27.520]  Cause everything at this point that you do proves my point.
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:28.520]  Watch this.
[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:34.520]  If I say death con three and then you cancel all of my deals, you proved
[02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:36.520]  exactly why I needed to go deaf con.
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:37.520]  No, no, I agree with what you said.
[02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:38.520]  Let me stop you.
[02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:41.520]  Cause James Chappelle Alex, Alex, let me channel.
[02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:42.520]  All right.
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:43.520]  Channel.
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:44.520]  All right.
[02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:48.520]  If, if, if I, uh, and Dave Chappelle works for the Jews anyway.
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:52.520]  So if, if I say, uh, now I forgot what I had to say, let me meditate.
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:53.520]  Let me get into a place.
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:54.520]  I'm sorry.
[02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:55.520]  Go ahead.
[02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:56.520]  Love you, brother.
[02:20:56.520 --> 02:20:57.520]  Uh, Jesus is king.
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:03.520]  Um, if I say, if I go on this, on this interview and I say, I love Hitler.
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:09.520]  And then they go and 51 50 me and try to lobotomize me.
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:13.520]  Like we saw Harley pass and I do, or they put me in prison.
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:15.520]  It just proves what I'm saying.
[02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:18.520]  And it's going to spark the high schools.
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:19.520]  It's going to spark the grammar.
[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:23.520]  School is going to spark the colleges that say enough is enough.
[02:21:23.520 --> 02:21:27.520]  It doesn't matter how on the spectrum you think I am.
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:29.520]  I have the right to speak out loud.
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:31.520]  That is our first amendment.
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:38.520]  And it's a shame that you have to be considered to be on the spectrum to have enough courage
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:40.520]  to speak out loud.
[02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:42.520]  I do love my family, right?
[02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:46.520]  But I looked at every possible outcome.
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:49.520]  I've practiced Chinese water torture on myself.
[02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:54.520]  I would, I would like skip along Malibu in front of my house and sing.
[02:21:54.520 --> 02:21:59.520]  When the Cleans come to kill me, how is it going to be?
[02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:02.520]  What are they going to do to kill me?
[02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:03.520]  Wait a second.
[02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:05.520]  Netton, what do you have to say about this?
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:10.520]  Netton, don't want to say Netton.
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:13.520]  What I'm trying to get at here is yay.
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:20.520]  That I don't think the father of the future revolution against tyranny is Hitler.
[02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:22.520]  Hitler said a coming man was coming.
[02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:26.520]  It would be the next Hitler that would destroy the New World Order and the whole system.
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:27.520]  He wanted his own New World Order.
[02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:29.520]  He thought it would come out of America.
[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:31.520]  Do you know about Hitler and his coming man?
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:33.520]  No, I don't know about that.
[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:37.520]  But what we have to, I just think you should not want to be Hitler's coming man.
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:38.520]  I didn't say I was.
[02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:40.520]  I don't, I don't really care that much about Hitler.
[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:41.520]  I love him.
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:43.520]  Seems like you just do it as a way to like troll.
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:45.520]  No, he seems like a cool guy.
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:49.520]  You know, it's like he, you know, it's like he had a really cool outfit and stuff.
[02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:51.520]  And he was a really good architect.
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:55.520]  And so you're in love with the, with the, with the, with the, with the look of it.
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:57.520]  And he didn't kill six million Jews.
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:22:59.520]  That's just like factually incorrect.
[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:00.520]  Let's get the Ronald Reagan clip.
[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:01.520]  They showed me, I'm sorry.
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:02.520]  Go ahead.
[02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:03.520]  Ronald Reagan said that too.
[02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:05.520]  Well, I think Hitler did target and kill some people.
[02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:08.520]  I think, you know, I think Obama killed Palestinians.
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:10.520]  No, I hear you here.
[02:23:10.520 --> 02:23:11.520]  Here's where I think the frustration is.
[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:12.520]  And Nick, you can comment on this.
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:14.520]  And Obama was not the first black president.
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:16.520]  He was another Jewish president.
[02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:21.520]  Americans are tired of hearing that we're Hitler and that we did bad things when we defeated Hitler.
[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:22.520]  And that's my biggest.
[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:26.520]  Let's not say his name anymore, only say Christ's name moving forward.
[02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:27.520]  I agree.
[02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:29.520]  I'm tired of hearing I'm a Nazi.
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:30.520]  I'm really sick.
[02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:31.520]  I'm not.
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:34.520]  But I think by them falsely accusing people, some people are going to become Nazis.
[02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:35.520]  I am.
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:36.520]  I am.
[02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:37.520]  Now what?
[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:38.520]  I am.
[02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:39.520]  Now what?
[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:40.520]  Now I'm a Nazi aria manual.
[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:41.520]  Isn't that what it said?
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:42.520]  Because this is the thing.
[02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:43.520]  You're doubling down.
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:44.520]  Look, look, look, Alex, I love you.
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:46.520]  Do not cut this rant rant off.
[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:47.520]  Not your life.
[02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:48.520]  Right here.
[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:49.520]  Okay.
[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:54.520]  We're in America, we get our history stolen from us and we're all made to slaves.
[02:23:54.520 --> 02:23:58.520]  The Native Americans and the ones brought over on Jewish slave boats, right?
[02:23:58.520 --> 02:24:01.520]  And then we're so-called free, but we're never free.
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:06.520]  And we're Republican, but then we're turned to Democrats at the MLK JFK time, right?
[02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:09.520]  And we're told we're black and they made songs that said, say it loud.
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:10.520]  Say it loud.
[02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:12.520]  I'm black and I'm proud.
[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:13.520]  Say it loud.
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:14.520]  I'm black and I'm proud.
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:17.520]  And then crack came and the rappers started saying, what's up my nigga?
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:18.520]  I'm a nigga.
[02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:19.520]  I'm a nigga.
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:20.520]  You a nigga.
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:21.520]  Okay.
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:22.520]  I'm a nigga then.
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:23.520]  Wait a second.
[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:24.520]  I thought nigga was bad a second ago.
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:25.520]  No, a nigga is fine.
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:27.020]  That's what the feds told us to call ourselves.
[02:24:27.020 --> 02:24:30.520]  And then even Beyonce, we never thought she called herself a bitch.
[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:33.520]  Missy said, hey, I'm a bitch.
[02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:34.520]  Everyone says I'm a bitch.
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:35.520]  Okay.
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:36.520]  Now our black women are bitches.
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:38.520]  So we're bitches and niggas now, right?
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:39.520]  I'm a, I'm a nigga.
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:40.520]  You a bitch.
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:41.520]  I've even said this in my reps.
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:45.520]  So I wake up and I look at the, I look at my phone and they say, yeah, he's an anti-semitic.
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:47.520]  So I said, okay.
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:49.520]  Well, I'm an anti-semitic.
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:52.520]  No, you said you said I'm an anti-semitic.
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:53.520]  Get it?
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:56.520]  You understand what I'm saying?
[02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:59.520]  Bring in the clowns.
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:01.520]  There will be clowns.
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:04.520]  I tell you what, let's play that Frank Sinatra clip for a minute.
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:07.520]  Let's get Owen Troyer and Ollie to have some comments, final comments here.
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:09.520]  Are you going to push that jet back?
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:11.520]  You got to get out of here.
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:13.520]  I got to get out of here.
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:14.520]  They already pushed the jet back.
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:16.520]  Try to stop us from getting here in the first time.
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:17.520]  Can you tell them what happened?
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:18.520]  Folks don't know.
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:19.520]  Tell them about that.
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:20.520]  Yeah.
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:23.520]  We had to have the plane turn around midair because there was a issue.
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:29.520]  There was some issue with the plane.
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:31.520]  You said that it happened before.
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:35.520]  No, that was the first time it happened with me, but we were up in the air 20 minutes out
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:37.520]  and then there was some kind of big alarm.
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:41.520]  We had to turn the plane around and land and yay said, oh, you're, he's not even going
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:42.520]  to believe me.
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:45.520]  He said, Alex isn't going to believe me because I guess it didn't happen the first time.
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:46.520]  Yeah.
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:47.520]  We tried to get the show together.
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:48.520]  Yeah.
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:50.520]  So, but that last time we had it again.
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:51.520]  Yeah.
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:53.520]  So there was some seal on the door that was broken and so we were.
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:55.520]  Well, you don't want to depressurize the cabin.
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:56.520]  Yeah.
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:59.520]  Now we wanted to go down safely, not like, you know, crashing a mountain or something.
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:05.520]  So which I'm not afraid of whatever way you guys want to choose to, you know, take me
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:06.520]  out or whatever.
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:07.520]  I'm not afraid anything.
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:09.520]  I'm only afraid of God.
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:14.520]  One thing I want to say to all of you guys is no one still stepped up other than John
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:19.520]  Stewart to say, Hey, he was upset about the practices.
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:22.520]  The contracts are still not changed.
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:26.520]  So you could do whatever you want to do and say whatever you want about me.
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:27.520]  We don't like his mask.
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:29.520]  We don't like everyone likes the jacket.
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:31.520]  Of course everyone loves the jacket.
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:32.520]  Right.
[02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:36.520]  You could say whatever you want about me, you could distract us with this Valenciaga
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:37.520]  kind of conversation.
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:40.520]  You could distract us with all of these woke ideas.
[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:42.520]  You can choose your superheroes.
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:48.520]  Like, oh, we're going to choose George Floyd instead of the MLKs.
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:53.520]  We're going to choose Gaby and Lizzo instead of the Beyonce's.
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:58.520]  You can try to create the narrative, but God runs the world and the people are tired
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:02.520]  of that people, all the athletes, all of the celebrities.
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:04.520]  What I'm saying is I love you guys.
[02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:07.520]  Also, I understand you're all scared.
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:10.520]  I understand why you don't want to get your bank accounts frozen.
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:11.520]  I get it.
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:12.520]  I love you.
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:15.520]  I'm not listening to none of y'all because you're all scared.
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:19.520]  And you notice the more they pressure whatever the issue is, the more it causes resistance.
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:22.520]  Let's play two minutes of Frank Sinatra bring in the clowns.
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:24.520]  Got a final comment from Ali Alexander.
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:25.520]  Final comment from Roman Schroder.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:27.520]  Final comment from everybody here.
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:29.520]  And the good news is you're 10 minutes from the airport.
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:30.520]  I know your flight was a tube.
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:31.520]  You can push it back.
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:33.520]  We've got yay in here with us.
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:35.520]  And in the clowns.
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:36.520]  Play it.
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:37.520]  Here it is.
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:28:03.520]  Here it is.
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:29.520]  Here it is.
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:55.520]  Here it is.
[02:28:55.520 --> 02:29:21.520]  Here it is.
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:47.520]  Here it is.
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:30:14.520]  Here it is.
[02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:36.520]  Here it is.
[02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:43.520]  Here it is.
[02:30:43.520 --> 02:31:05.520]  Here it is.
[02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:07.080]  You know, I'm telling on Elon Musk
[02:31:07.080 --> 02:31:09.880]  to restore the accounts of everybody who was banned.
[02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:12.800]  He said this week that he was gonna give an amnesty
[02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:14.680]  to all the accounts that were banned.
[02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:16.560]  So I would like my account back.
[02:31:16.560 --> 02:31:18.920]  I think that you should get your account back.
[02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:22.000]  I think that Nicholas and Ali should get their accounts back.
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.760]  And also, you know, for the people that are texting me
[02:31:24.760 --> 02:31:26.480]  and calling me right now saying,
[02:31:26.480 --> 02:31:28.640]  oh, you're Jewish, how could you not, you know,
[02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:32.240]  call out yay for his comments about Jews and Hitler today?
[02:31:32.240 --> 02:31:35.460]  I'm not gonna tell yay what he's allowed to think.
[02:31:35.460 --> 02:31:38.320]  I'm not gonna tell yay what he's allowed to say.
[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:40.000]  I'm a free speech absolutist.
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:43.520]  And if you cannot understand, right,
[02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:44.920]  that this is about free speech.
[02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:47.760]  This is about combating cancel culture
[02:31:47.760 --> 02:31:50.240]  and standing up against the censors
[02:31:50.240 --> 02:31:52.400]  and the cancel culture movement,
[02:31:52.400 --> 02:31:54.600]  then I don't really wanna talk to you.
[02:31:54.600 --> 02:31:56.800]  And this is more than just, you know,
[02:31:56.800 --> 02:31:58.840]  somebody being Jewish, somebody being Christian.
[02:31:58.840 --> 02:32:02.320]  This is about the truth and fighting for free speech.
[02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:05.080]  So I just wanna say that, you know,
[02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:07.600]  I'm here to fight to make sure that yay has a right
[02:32:07.600 --> 02:32:09.760]  to say what he wants to say,
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:11.520]  even as a Jewish woman,
[02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:14.440]  because free speech is greater than all of us.
[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:16.280]  This is what we're fighting for together.
[02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:18.240]  That's right, and we lose that, we lose everything.
[02:32:18.240 --> 02:32:19.560]  All right, Kay, hit you back a little bit later.
[02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:21.080]  Love you, thank you.
[02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:23.160]  You want that piece of paper again?
[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:28.160]  No, I wanna photograph it and put this version of it online.
[02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:29.880]  Beautiful.
[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:31.280]  And you gotta leave it like 10 minutes,
[02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:33.280]  so I wanna play.
[02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:34.920]  I gotta leave it now minutes, but it's okay.
[02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:37.200]  You gotta leave now minutes, my way.
[02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:38.960]  But real quick, Ollie Alexander,
[02:32:38.960 --> 02:32:40.560]  first I want to show you, you're gonna come up
[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:43.280]  in like an hour, 3 p.m. central of the war room.
[02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:45.040]  We'll have highlights of this, everything.
[02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:47.720]  We'll have a post game here, but other comments.
[02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:49.960]  Well, I'll not give my whole plethora here.
[02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:52.080]  I'll save some of that time for the war room
[02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:54.440]  coming up in an hour so that Ollie can speak to.
[02:32:54.440 --> 02:32:55.720]  But you know, one quick thing,
[02:32:55.720 --> 02:32:56.800]  all these people out there saying,
[02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:59.240]  oh, yay's lost his mind, yay's lost his mind.
[02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:01.360]  Again, check yourselves.
[02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:04.000]  We have, we are mutilating children
[02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.800]  and calling them trans kids
[02:33:05.800 --> 02:33:08.960]  and calling it gender affirming surgery.
[02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:12.280]  No, yay has not lost his mind, you have.
[02:33:12.280 --> 02:33:15.760]  We have men claiming they can get pregnant.
[02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:19.120]  No, yay has not lost his mind, you have.
[02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:21.560]  We have now open sex trafficking
[02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:23.320]  happening at the southern border
[02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:25.960]  and the White House forcing Border Patrol
[02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:30.640]  to be the final ushers in of the unaccompanied youths
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:32.040]  to their pimps.
[02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:34.400]  No, yay has not lost his mind.
[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:37.320]  We all have for this going on.
[02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:39.480]  Now, when yay talks about wearing
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:40.720]  the white lives matter shirt,
[02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:42.440]  and really this is what we're doing here today too,
[02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:44.920]  it's culture jamming, that's what we're doing.
[02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:47.040]  Oh, you can wear a black lives matter shirt,
[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:49.000]  but you can't wear a white lives matter shirt.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.320]  We're ramming their own culture down their throat
[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:53.080]  and we're finding out that they don't like it.
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:55.280]  Same thing with this interview today.
[02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:56.920]  We believe in free speech.
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:33:59.380]  Whether we agree with what each other are saying or not,
[02:33:59.380 --> 02:34:00.800]  we believe in their right to say it.
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:02.480]  The exercise of us showing we're here,
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:04.200]  we have our own platform and the internet.
[02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:07.480]  Number one story, hands down in the world right now
[02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:09.840]  is this broadcast, because people want free speech.
[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:12.080]  Great point, 60 second closing comment Owen.
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:14.800]  Then Nick Pointes, then Ali Alexander, then you.
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:18.320]  Well, I would say, I don't think the story here
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:20.840]  with yay should be about anti-Semitism
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:22.360]  or Nazis or any of that.
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:24.280]  To me, the human interest story is.
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:26.160]  I would not just go, you're fine.
[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:28.120]  But yay, think about what you can do
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:29.400]  with your platform right now,
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:31.440]  because they want to make that the issue.
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:34.560]  Most people say, the whole world,
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:36.880]  I'm talking about everybody watching this right now.
[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:37.720]  That's fine.
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:41.440]  We want yay to expose the corruption,
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:43.840]  the secrets, the societies like you've been doing.
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:46.340]  We want yay to pull the curtain back on Hollywood,
[02:34:46.340 --> 02:34:48.280]  pull the curtain back on Valenciaga,
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:49.880]  pull the curtain back on all this stuff.
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:51.800]  None of it's sacrosanct.
[02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:53.800]  Everybody should be able to criticize.
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:57.000]  I'll cover the rest of my comments later today
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:57.840]  on the War Room.
[02:34:57.840 --> 02:35:00.160]  I want to make sure Ali gets a final comment
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:01.120]  here before yay leaves.
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:02.720]  Here's one more question the crew had.
[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:04.600]  What about your personal training saying,
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:05.600]  your personal trainer saying,
[02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:07.480]  we'll put you in a, it turned out he was in secret
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:10.200]  government operations in mind control in Canada admitted it.
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:12.720]  Him saying, I'll put you in a mental institution for life.
[02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:13.560]  If you don't shut up.
[02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:14.680]  I mean, I get why you're pissed.
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:16.840]  You're not going to be dominated.
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:17.680]  Exactly.
[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:20.720]  You know, I've expressed myself
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:24.120]  and I've expressed myself calmly.
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:27.640]  And no one's scared anymore.
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:31.080]  You guys have beat me to a pulp,
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:32.520]  but I'm still alive.
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:35.120]  And now I'm not afraid.
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:36.800]  You can't threaten me.
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:38.480]  You could call me crazy.
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:39.880]  You could take the money.
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:42.000]  You could take all the supermodels
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  and don't take the supermodels.
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:50.640]  Don't take the supermodels.
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:53.240]  Hey, sometimes a waitress is better than a supermodel.
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:58.240]  So, but Jesus is king and I love everyone.
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:03.400]  This is love speech, Ari.
[02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:06.760]  This is love speech in Jesus name,
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:11.160]  the real king of Israel, Jesus Christ.
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:12.160]  This is love speech.
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:14.640]  I love Jewish people.
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:19.280]  I love supermodels.
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:23.160]  I, wait a second.
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:24.600]  Let's see what Netting loves.
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:26.720]  You love Nick Fuentes?
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:27.560]  Maybe Hitler.
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:29.600]  I'm, I'm, I'm Netting Yahoo.
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:31.520]  I ain't never had a supermodel.
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:32.480]  Yeah, Katel.
[02:36:33.920 --> 02:36:34.760]  All right.
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:35.720]  Well, you're going to leave here in a few minutes.
[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:37.800]  You're going to think, gosh, I wish I would have said that.
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:39.200]  So what do you wish you would have said?
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:40.600]  I think I said a lot.
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:41.800]  I think I said a lot.
[02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:46.800]  You know, I think I said, pretty, pretty, pretty good.
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:49.280]  Did you retweet out little signed picture?
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:50.800]  Yes, I did, sir.
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:54.600]  All right, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:56.760]  Whoever's staying behind is going to be here and be on air.
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:36:58.560]  We're going to unpack all this, obviously,
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:00.720]  and cover it and, you know, get into every issue.
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:03.320]  But yeah, do you think humanity survives?
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:04.560]  What do you make of the mark of the beast,
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:06.440]  the forced COVID inoculations?
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:10.280]  I mean, this, this is a wave in the right direction.
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:14.480]  Why did you think you were able to do three hours here?
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:16.920]  You just did three hours, three minutes, by the way.
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:18.720]  Or no, no, no, no, you had done three hours, three minutes.
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:21.680]  Why were you able to stay here, but not with Tim Poole?
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:23.920]  Because Tim Poole got the call from those boys
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:25.480]  10 minutes before I got there
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:27.320]  and said, flag this and flag that.
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:30.120]  Also, Tim Poole is the NPC, you know,
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:31.920]  and you're a real, a real human being.
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:34.680]  So no one's ever heard of Tim Poole.
[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:37.080]  You know, you're the legend that is Alex Jones
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:38.560]  and you were fighting on the front line.
[02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:39.400]  And now we're here with you.
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:40.640]  You got some other superheroes
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:42.760]  part of the adventure movie fighting for Christ
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:44.360]  and free speech.
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:45.200]  And I called it, I said,
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:46.800]  what is this superhero thing with the mask?
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:48.080]  He said, yeah, but don't say it.
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:48.920]  They'll figure it out.
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:50.320]  But I was saying, yeah, I'm Lex Luthor.
[02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:53.320]  What is the new yay superhero we're talking about?
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:55.800]  It's someone in service to Jesus Christ,
[02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:58.000]  not into his own ego.
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:37:59.600]  And that I have my rights.
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:03.840]  You know, I had the right to wear a mask for the entire.
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:08.280]  I had the right to wear a super, super, super fresh jacket.
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:11.400]  You know, I had the right to tell God,
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:14.160]  please don't take away the super models.
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:16.200]  I just want to marry one.
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:17.320]  You know, I can.
[02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:18.840]  Well, I gotta say this,
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:20.240]  cause I've always, I've never seen you in concert.
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:21.360]  My daughter has big fan.
[02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:22.720]  I'm a fan of a lot of your music,
[02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:24.640]  but I've never seen you in person.
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:25.960]  You don't look little on screen,
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:27.960]  but you don't look like a really big guy.
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:29.560]  But in person, I'm a stalking guy.
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:30.840]  I'm kind of small compared to you.
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:32.880]  You're built like a brick, you know, one house
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:35.120]  and you're tall, you're pretty tall too.
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:38.280]  So I don't think people have been around yay in person.
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:41.000]  You know, just, it's interesting.
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:42.320]  And you're a handsome guy in person.
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:44.200]  I wish you weren't wearing that damn mask.
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:45.160]  That's the vision.
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:46.360]  But you won't give us what we want.
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:48.000]  You won't show us your face at the end.
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:48.840]  Absolutely not.
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:50.160]  That kind of kills it, huh?
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:52.800]  People, it was a yay impersonator.
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:53.840]  He was never here.
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:55.160]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:56.520]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:38:56.520 --> 02:38:57.560]  We never know.
[02:38:57.560 --> 02:38:59.360]  Dave Chappelle, I guess we'll never know.
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:01.160]  Hey, last thing on Dave Chappelle.
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:03.520]  I watched his Saturday Night Live where he grovels
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:05.960]  and at the end he says, well, whoever that group is,
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:07.720]  we're not allowed to talk about it, good night.
[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:09.400]  So he admitted to other's powerful groups
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:10.760]  controlling our speech at least at the end.
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:12.680]  Everybody has to do it in their own way,
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:16.880]  but he said, they dropped that nigger.
[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:19.760]  And as my friend, I've never dropped a rap bar,
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:22.920]  ever saying anything on a Jewish platform,
[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:25.200]  dissing my friend Dave Chappelle.
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:26.480]  And I have an issue with it.
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:28.400]  And you could tell big country I got an issue.
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:29.360]  That's the security.
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:31.680]  You could tell, all of you could tell Corey Smith,
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:33.480]  he don't deserve to wear gold teeth.
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:39.040]  What do you, Dave, early it was like you.
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:39.880]  To you.
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:41.880]  What do you have to say about Corey Smith's gold teeth?
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:45.000]  Real quick, 10 years ago, he was like, there's a mafia.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:46.200]  They came to me and said what I got to do.
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:47.760]  He ran off to Africa.
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:50.360]  Now he's kind of come back, did he sell out?
[02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:51.200]  He didn't sell out.
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:53.200]  Yeah, he sold out a little bit because,
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:57.480]  because he denounced the king.
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:39:58.320]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:39:59.160]  He denounced me.
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:00.680]  I'm the one fighting on the front line.
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:03.280]  And no black person's to say nothing bad about me
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:05.080]  in public unless they have puffed it.
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:05.920]  Period.
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:07.760]  I put my life on the line.
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:10.000]  And then afterwards they're gonna talk about it.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:11.560]  If anything happens to me, everyone's gonna go,
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:13.720]  no, he was the greatest, he was the greatest.
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:15.280]  Everybody shut up.
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:19.600]  Everybody shut up, go home to your scared little bins
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:21.120]  and your scared little town home
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:23.760]  and your scared little movie contracts and shut up.
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:26.040]  Don't talk to me about nothing, bro.
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:27.280]  What do you think of Ice Cube?
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:29.400]  He lost nine or seven million, whatever it was,
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:30.400]  because he wouldn't take the shot.
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:31.880]  I respect that.
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:34.800]  Yeah, I respect Cube, but he's got to play his position.
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:37.040]  It's like, you know, it's fine.
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:39.640]  I wanted Cube to come in and help us with the politics
[02:40:39.640 --> 02:40:40.920]  because he's one of the only people
[02:40:40.920 --> 02:40:42.600]  that was brave enough to talk.
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:43.600]  He's definitely for real.
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:46.200]  Yeah, yeah, he's an engineer.
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:48.560]  He's an architect and engineer by trade.
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:50.960]  And then he dropped out to do entertainment.
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:54.760]  Guys, hey, everybody, stop all engineers.
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:56.920]  We need our engineers back.
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:40:58.200]  We need our architects back.
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:40:59.600]  We need our doctors back.
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:01.960]  Stop with the photos on Instagram.
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:03.480]  Stop with all the entertainment.
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:05.720]  21 Savage owns a bank.
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:08.320]  We have brilliant people that are inside of.
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:09.560]  By the way, I wanna say the future,
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:12.080]  we're very close with some folks who actually having a bank,
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:13.240]  it's funny you bring that up,
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:15.120]  a bank and internet processing for patriots.
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:17.440]  That's the future, is not trying to fix Twitter
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:20.120]  or fix any of it, building our own system.
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:21.720]  I mean, the future is the past also,
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:23.680]  because soon as you got the internet,
[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:27.040]  all these things, the data can be copied by China,
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:27.880]  by these banks.
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:28.800]  Yeah, you don't really own your data,
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:29.640]  but it's on the cloud.
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:31.040]  So this is the last question.
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:33.160]  I know Lewis Furkhan, I've interviewed him.
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:34.520]  I agree with like 95% of what he says.
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:35.360]  Some things I don't agree with.
[02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:37.320]  But the point is, I think he cares about people.
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:39.160]  He's a real guy and he's nothing compared to the left
[02:41:39.160 --> 02:41:41.040]  saying all whites are devils and criminals.
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:43.200]  So they're way more racist than he is.
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:46.160]  But I get, you know, what he's been saying.
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:47.440]  You kind of got mad at him and said,
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:50.080]  hey, don't disrespect me with my billions they just stole.
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:51.560]  Because he said, hey, maybe it was never yours.
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:53.240]  I think his point is what you just made.
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:55.720]  If they can grab it out of your account, it's never yours.
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:41:57.720]  Unless it's your farm, your people, your kids,
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:58.840]  your thing, it's not yours.
[02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:00.640]  I don't think he was dissing your success.
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:02.120]  They was saying, was it ever yours
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:03.440]  to begin with, they can take it.
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:05.400]  Our life is not ours, it's God's.
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:06.960]  So now you get what he was saying.
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:08.560]  I talked to the minister.
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:09.400]  Oh good.
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:10.280]  So you're not mad at him now.
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:11.400]  I'm not mad at anyone.
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:12.760]  I'm not mad at Ari.
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:14.040]  If it's not, if it's not off record,
[02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:14.880]  tell us about the conversation.
[02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:18.360]  On the record, Ari Emanuel, if you need me and your wife
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:20.960]  to step into a private room and have me work
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:23.360]  on her clothing line, I'm here.
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:26.360]  But seriously.
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:27.760]  So you were a little mad at Farrakhan.
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:28.600]  You had to talk.
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:29.440]  How did that go?
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:30.920]  It's gonna be all Christian, Ari.
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:33.680]  Ram, Ram, Ram, don't, don't worry.
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:35.280]  It's gonna be all Christian, Ram.
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:37.960]  You are something else.
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:39.480]  Look, you look really friendly and nice,
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:41.760]  but with that mask, you look evil as hell.
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:43.120]  Let me just say this in closing.
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:43.960]  I've done a lot of study.
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:45.480]  I think Hitler was a really bad guy
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:46.960]  and I repudiated what Hitler did.
[02:42:46.960 --> 02:42:48.280]  I understand that the British intelligence
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:49.600]  set him up and used him.
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:50.640]  I like Hitler.
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:52.000]  I don't like Hitler.
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:53.440]  And I know you're trying to be shocking with that.
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:54.840]  I'm not trying to be shocking.
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:57.040]  I like Hitler, I do not.
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:42:59.920]  The Holocaust is not what happened.
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:01.120]  Let's look at the facts of that.
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:03.440]  And Hitler has a lot of redeeming qualities.
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:05.040]  So tell us, you think, you think
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:08.760]  Hitler was the good guy in World War II?
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:12.120]  I think God says, man should not kill.
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:14.640]  We should not have wars, period.
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:16.000]  None of us should be killing anybody.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.600]  Ukraine and the streets of Chicago,
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:21.760]  all violence should stop and we should all serve Christ.
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:23.240]  That's what I feel.
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:26.520]  And I feel like I love everyone accordingly
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:31.400]  from all the way from the Balenciagas to the Hitlers.
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:32.240]  Let me tell you a story.
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:33.080]  Hold on, sir.
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:33.920]  Okay.
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:37.840]  From Samuel to Jamie Dimon, to the people who?
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:38.680]  What's that?
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:39.520]  Amber Alert.
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:40.360]  Here's what I'm saying.
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:43.600]  My grandfather would never tell World War II stories.
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:45.240]  And after he died, we read over his stuff
[02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:46.720]  and he never even told my dad all the stuff he did
[02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:48.320]  and everything, but it was all in their letters
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:49.160]  and commendations.
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:52.280]  He told me, he said, kid, I was like eight years old.
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:54.240]  I always thought Amber Alerts is when my ex-girlfriend,
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:55.800]  Amber, was doing something in the streets.
[02:43:55.800 --> 02:43:56.640]  I got to Amber Alert.
[02:43:56.640 --> 02:43:57.600]  Before he died, I was like five years old.
[02:43:57.600 --> 02:43:58.760]  The point was, and I was like,
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:01.040]  tell me World War II story, tell me World War II story.
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:02.920]  And he said, okay, well, we came out of Africa,
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:03.960]  we came into Italy.
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:04.800]  He was there three years.
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:06.120]  He said, by the time they got to Germany,
[02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:08.560]  they went into this death camp and there were piles
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:10.200]  of dead bodies, a hundred feet tall
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:12.520]  with blackbirds eating people's eyeballs out.
[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:15.640]  All I'm telling you is, is that just because you hate
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:16.640]  the globalists and what they're doing,
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:19.680]  and I get it, Klaus Schwab's grandfather was a Nazi.
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:22.480]  I mean, there's Nazis above the ADL.
[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:25.360]  Yeah, but Nazis are like kind of cool.
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:26.800]  Cause you like your uniforms.
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:28.760]  No, I just, these are people.
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:30.480]  Every once in a while, I love all people.
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:31.760]  So you love the Zionists.
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:33.840]  I love this. I said that earlier in the show.
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:34.960]  All right.
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:36.960]  Do you have any comments on Hitler?
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:39.640]  I, who did he say he hated?
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:41.080]  He didn't say he hated anybody.
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:42.960]  Why isn't anybody listening to him?
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:44.120]  He said, I love this person.
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:45.960]  I love the people who are trying to take away my children.
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:46.920]  I love this person.
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:47.760]  He never said he hated anybody.
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:48.600]  But I don't think we, listen,
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:50.240]  I'm just getting it totally clear.
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:51.080]  But I think Stalin-
[02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:53.360]  You did the same thing, you did the same thing on-
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:54.880]  Stalin is horrible.
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:55.800]  Hitler is horrible.
[02:44:55.800 --> 02:44:56.640]  Mao is horrible.
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:44:58.760]  No, no, I love all of those.
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:00.000]  You love Mao Zedong?
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:00.840]  Absolutely.
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:01.680]  Mao brought-
[02:45:01.680 --> 02:45:02.640]  Well, clarify that.
[02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:03.840]  You're saying, you're like Christ-like.
[02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:04.680]  You love everybody.
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:05.520]  Yeah.
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:06.840]  No matter, you love Jim Jones.
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:08.440]  You love Jeffrey Dahmer.
[02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:09.480]  Absolutely.
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:11.520]  Okay, well, let's clarify.
[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:12.800]  But he didn't need clarification
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:14.320]  because he said, I'm starting with the Bible.
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:15.640]  He's ending with the Bible.
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:17.640]  And that's what, but they did it to you, Alex,
[02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:19.480]  because you had a guy who came here.
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:20.480]  You're like, I'll be Satan.
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:21.480]  I'll be the evil guy.
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:22.520]  I did Sandy Hook.
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:23.840]  Remember, you did the same thing
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:25.680]  that he's doing right now.
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:26.880]  All right.
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:27.720]  Absolutely.
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:28.560]  Yeah, we appreciate you.
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:30.040]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:31.320]  Jesus is king.
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:33.480]  Start with the Bible.
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:34.600]  Love your children.
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:36.360]  Love your family.
[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:38.240]  Think about the things that you're doing
[02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:39.560]  before you throw stones.
[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:40.760]  Stop the trauma.
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:43.480]  Stop the generational abuse.
[02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:44.720]  The sexual abuse.
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:45.560]  I agree.
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:46.800]  What's next in the A world?
[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:47.600]  What are you gonna do next?
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:49.080]  Sir, I was still in the middle of it.
[02:45:49.080 --> 02:45:49.920]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:50.760]  I love you.
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:51.960]  Stop the abuse.
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:55.520]  Generation, they say abuse goes three generations.
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:45:57.200]  Stop the trafficking.
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:45:59.800]  Instagram is sex trafficking.
[02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:03.080]  The language, I'ma screw your wife.
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:05.240]  I'ma have all that is trafficking.
[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:06.080]  Stop it.
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:08.360]  Stop the drug usage.
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:09.640]  Stop the killing.
[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:11.000]  We put the guns down ourselves.
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:14.360]  We rise up and we show God how strong we are.
[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:18.320]  It's our disobedience to God that got us enslaved.
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:21.560]  God is on our side, but we have to be on God's side.
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:23.720]  We have to listen to our father.
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:25.960]  We have to listen to God and follow him
[02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:27.480]  and he will protect us.
[02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:28.320]  Look.
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:31.040]  But I agree with that before we can cast stones.
[02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:32.520]  You're saying you love everybody.
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:33.360]  You don't judge them.
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:34.520]  It's God to judge.
[02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:35.640]  I agree with that statement.
[02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:36.880]  And we gotta change ourselves
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:38.760]  and stop pointing our fingers at somebody else.
[02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:39.600]  Exactly.
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:40.440]  All right.
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:41.960]  And it's to say, hey, I'm gonna show you
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:46.200]  how much Jewish media can't tell me what to say.
[02:46:46.200 --> 02:46:47.240]  You like that, Ari?
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:50.160]  And I'm telling you, we could get a nice private room.
[02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:52.880]  Me and your wife can go in and work on the clothing line.
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:53.840]  I'm really good at it.
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:55.440]  And it'll be super Christian.
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:46:58.520]  Okay, wrong, it's okay.
[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:00.360]  You got a thing for his wife?
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:01.520]  Absolutely not.
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:03.600]  I would not look at his wife for a second,
[02:47:03.600 --> 02:47:06.080]  but I do believe that the clothing line
[02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:08.120]  could use some creative improvement.
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:12.040]  All right, infowars.com tomorrow is news today.
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:13.760]  Nick Fuentes, yay.
[02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:15.360]  I don't wanna end this if you got more to say,
[02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:17.000]  but you gotta catch a flight.
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:17.840]  Gotta catch a flight.
[02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:18.680]  All right, yay.
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:21.120]  I appreciate you coming and I appreciate the first amendment.
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:22.560]  And look, he's not taking the mask off.
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:23.680]  Yay was not here.
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:24.840]  Incredible impersonator.
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:27.040]  Wilbert Johnson was the impersonator.
[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:28.160]  Wilbert.
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:29.880]  Neton Neton was here though.
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:32.560]  Actually Benjamin Neton Yahoo played Kanye West today.
[02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:35.440]  Hey Neton, what you at?
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:36.600]  Hey, yay.
[02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:38.640]  Guys, they're the Justin Trudeau thing and some clips.

[02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:46.400]  All right, this has been incredible.
