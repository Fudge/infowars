[00:00.000 --> 00:23.560]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:23.560 --> 00:29.040]  I am Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex Jones for the first hour of this global broadcast
[00:29.040 --> 00:32.280]  Thursday, August 27th, 2009.
[00:32.280 --> 00:34.440]  Man, the summer is almost over.
[00:34.440 --> 00:37.240]  We're going to be hitting up this article right here.
[00:37.240 --> 00:38.240]  The truth about lying.
[00:38.240 --> 00:42.280]  Now, this is going to make a lot of people uncomfortable because it really exposes us
[00:42.280 --> 00:46.760]  as a society of liars, which we are, we can't even be honest with ourselves most of the
[00:46.760 --> 00:47.760]  time.
[00:47.760 --> 00:49.520]  We're also going to be reading this article out of Fox News.
[00:49.520 --> 00:55.080]  All you need to know about the flu pandemic and the swine flu shot, I'm going to give
[00:55.080 --> 00:56.080]  you a little hint.
[00:56.080 --> 00:57.240]  Here's what you don't need to know.
[00:57.240 --> 00:58.840]  You don't need to know about Gillian's bear.
[00:58.840 --> 00:59.840]  It's not in there.
[00:59.840 --> 01:01.880]  You don't need to know about the trial runs that are hurting people.
[01:01.880 --> 01:03.400]  You don't need to know about Baxter.
[01:03.400 --> 01:04.400]  Okay.
[01:04.400 --> 01:07.560]  You don't need to know much other than you need to take three of these shots.
[01:07.560 --> 01:10.920]  We're going to get to that in a moment, but I want to make this point.
[01:10.920 --> 01:15.680]  I was on YouTube yesterday and I noticed that the new Michael Moore movie has been up on
[01:15.680 --> 01:17.920]  YouTube now since August 20th.
[01:17.920 --> 01:21.480]  Now they paid for some advertising to be on the front page.
[01:21.480 --> 01:23.760]  Now I clicked on it and it only had 32,000 views.
[01:23.760 --> 01:25.920]  Again, it had been up since the 20th.
[01:25.920 --> 01:26.920]  Six days.
[01:26.920 --> 01:30.720]  Now, you look at fall, the Republic, Alex Jones's new trailer.
[01:30.720 --> 01:35.360]  That already has almost 70,000 views in under 48 hours.
[01:35.360 --> 01:40.120]  You look at my trailer in under 48 hours, it has 40,000 views.
[01:40.120 --> 01:41.120]  Now why is this important?
[01:41.120 --> 01:42.120]  Why am I bringing this up?
[01:42.120 --> 01:47.640]  Number one, it shows that we are as popular, if not more popular than a mainline leftist
[01:47.640 --> 01:51.360]  like Michael Moore, whose movies are literally seen by millions of people and people go to
[01:51.360 --> 01:53.840]  the theater to see these movies.
[01:53.840 --> 01:59.080]  Now number two, they put him on the front page for an advertisement, but they also put
[01:59.080 --> 02:02.840]  him in favorites and he's in the top categories.
[02:02.840 --> 02:03.840]  We're not.
[02:03.840 --> 02:07.600]  I looked at the views in the activism section in the trailers and the films.
[02:07.600 --> 02:08.600]  Where are we?
[02:08.600 --> 02:14.160]  We're dominating in numbers, but somehow our trailers can't get in to the top rated sites.
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.000]  We can't be on the front page.
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.680]  Again, why am I making this point?
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.600]  So I go to the trailer this morning and the trailer has 300,000 hits now.
[02:22.600 --> 02:28.600]  That means it had 270,000 hits because YouTube put it on the front page.
[02:28.600 --> 02:33.280]  Can you imagine if they were fair with us and they actually put Fall of the Republic,
[02:33.280 --> 02:38.640]  an invisible empire on the front page, we'd easily have 300,000 views.
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.480]  And I was thinking about playing this Michael Moore trailer, Capitalism, a love story.
[02:43.480 --> 02:47.200]  It's all fun and games that they're ripping us off and it's Capitalism's fault, folks.
[02:47.200 --> 02:49.080]  It's not Capitalism's fault.
[02:49.080 --> 02:53.520]  It's the fact that we've let offshore bankers go beyond the free market.
[02:53.520 --> 02:54.800]  There is no free market.
[02:54.800 --> 02:56.640]  This isn't a Capitalist Society.
[02:56.640 --> 03:02.080]  As Webster Tarpley will tell you, this is fascism at its core, at its hard core and
[03:02.080 --> 03:03.560]  they're gutting it right now, baby.
[03:03.560 --> 03:10.800]  I mean, they are really setting up a society in which we have to grovel to the government
[03:10.800 --> 03:16.600]  to have sustenance to maintain any kind of lifestyle where we can take care of our kids
[03:16.600 --> 03:17.600]  or we can have our own home.
[03:17.600 --> 03:20.440]  It won't be our home anymore, it will really be the government's.
[03:20.440 --> 03:25.080]  And they'll just gut this country and our sovereignty, bring in the North American Union,
[03:25.080 --> 03:28.760]  say it's good for all of us and we'll say, man, they temporarily fix the problem all
[03:28.760 --> 03:29.760]  of a sudden.
[03:29.760 --> 03:33.680]  It's not 15% unemployment, it's only 10 and then it's five.
[03:33.680 --> 03:38.160]  So we really have to be aware of this and, you know, I like more on some level.
[03:38.160 --> 03:41.960]  I think Fahrenheit 9-11 woke up a lot of people at least to take the next step into
[03:41.960 --> 03:44.280]  the real hardcore 9-11 truth.
[03:44.280 --> 03:47.040]  I wasn't a huge fan of sicko, but I didn't think it was that good.
[03:47.040 --> 03:48.400]  It just really bothers me.
[03:48.400 --> 03:54.240]  He's such a raving socialist and really a liar at some level, Michael Moore, you know,
[03:54.240 --> 03:55.240]  the truth about lying.
[03:55.240 --> 03:56.240]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[03:56.240 --> 04:02.080]  But he was on the cover story for Barack Obama on the Rolling Stone last month, right?
[04:02.080 --> 04:05.200]  Him, Gergen, and I think it was Paul Krugman.
[04:05.200 --> 04:11.040]  And he actually states in there that Obama is lying and posturing himself by saying that
[04:11.040 --> 04:15.100]  50,000 troops will be in Iraq at the end of 2011.
[04:15.100 --> 04:16.640]  He doesn't believe that he's telling the truth.
[04:16.640 --> 04:18.520]  He really thinks he's going to get them out.
[04:18.520 --> 04:20.240]  Are you insane, Michael Moore?
[04:20.240 --> 04:21.920]  Of course that's the plan.
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.280]  We'll be lucky to only have 50,000 troops in Iraq by the end of 2011.
[04:26.280 --> 04:27.280]  Okay?
[04:27.280 --> 04:29.320]  Let's be real with each other.
[04:29.320 --> 04:33.560]  They're saying they need to beefcake up the Afghan war.
[04:33.560 --> 04:34.560]  That's the reality.
[04:34.560 --> 04:38.480]  And you're going to be hearing a lot of that rhetoric in the run up to September 11th and
[04:38.480 --> 04:39.840]  on September 11th this year.
[04:39.840 --> 04:41.200]  I guarantee you that.
[04:41.200 --> 04:42.600]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[04:42.600 --> 04:43.600]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[04:43.600 --> 04:47.520]  Alex coming up in the second, third, and fourth hours with Wayne Paul, Dr. Lobo, General
[04:47.520 --> 04:49.280]  Stubblebine, and Bob Cohen.
[04:49.280 --> 05:00.160]  Go check us out over at infowars.com and we're streaming live at PrismPlanet.tv.
[05:00.160 --> 05:01.560]  This is Alex Jones.
[05:01.560 --> 05:03.560]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[05:03.560 --> 05:04.560]  Well, you should.
[05:04.560 --> 05:09.080]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[05:09.080 --> 05:10.080]  That's right.
[05:10.080 --> 05:14.880]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training
[05:14.880 --> 05:19.720]  Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[05:19.720 --> 05:24.240]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free, spring-filled armory
[05:24.240 --> 05:27.040]  XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[05:27.040 --> 05:31.120]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[05:31.120 --> 05:34.000]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.600]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[05:38.600 --> 05:39.680]  attitudes.
[05:39.680 --> 05:41.160]  This is real.
[05:41.160 --> 05:42.160]  Don't miss out.
[05:42.160 --> 05:47.880]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30-state concealed weapons permit for
[05:47.880 --> 05:50.600]  pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[05:50.600 --> 05:53.080]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[05:53.080 --> 05:56.680]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[05:56.680 --> 06:00.040]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[06:00.040 --> 06:07.440]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future.
[06:07.440 --> 06:10.240]  It is dominated by a powerful world government.
[06:10.240 --> 06:12.320]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[06:12.320 --> 06:16.040]  Is that their objective being world domination?
[06:16.040 --> 06:19.200]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[06:19.200 --> 06:25.120]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[06:25.120 --> 06:29.600]  of humanity is at hand.
[06:29.600 --> 06:34.600]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[06:34.600 --> 06:38.920]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[06:38.920 --> 06:41.560]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[06:41.560 --> 06:42.560]  Most people have no idea.
[06:42.560 --> 06:43.560]  They're not after money.
[06:43.560 --> 06:44.560]  They have all the money they need.
[06:44.560 --> 06:45.560]  They're after power.
[06:45.560 --> 06:46.560]  That's what happens easily.

[06:54.360 --> 07:00.560]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[07:00.560 --> 07:07.720]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[07:07.720 --> 07:12.560]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride, at less than 2 cents per
[07:12.560 --> 07:13.560]  gallon?
[07:13.560 --> 07:18.480]  Burky water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine fluoride
[07:18.480 --> 07:20.560]  and contaminants from municipal water.
[07:20.560 --> 07:24.880]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for
[07:24.880 --> 07:26.680]  rainwater collection systems.
[07:26.680 --> 07:31.520]  From the smallest to the largest systems, BigBurkyWaterFilters.com has what you need.
[07:31.520 --> 07:35.400]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter or two
[07:35.400 --> 07:38.000]  sport burky bottles absolutely free.
[07:38.000 --> 07:44.480]  BigBurkyWaterFilters.com would like to offer GCN listeners 5% off all ceramic filter systems
[07:44.480 --> 07:47.880]  and ship all orders over $50 free of charge.

[08:05.480 --> 08:10.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[08:10.320 --> 08:11.320]  You want answers?
[08:11.320 --> 08:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[08:13.320 --> 08:17.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:17.640 --> 08:21.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:21.640 --> 08:23.140]  All right, folks.
[08:23.140 --> 08:24.140]  We are back.
[08:24.140 --> 08:25.140]  This is Joe and Joe.
[08:25.140 --> 08:26.640]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in for the first hour.
[08:26.640 --> 08:30.280]  Alex coming in up in the second, third, fourth hours.
[08:30.280 --> 08:33.960]  I'm holding in my hand last month's Rolling Stone, and then we're going to finish up with
[08:33.960 --> 08:38.680]  this Michael Moore issue and move on to the H1N1 vaccine, but it's not really H1N1.
[08:38.680 --> 08:41.000]  Again, this is three types of flu.
[08:41.000 --> 08:42.000]  So here it is.
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.240]  Obama, so far in the cover image here, if we can focus in on this on PrismPlanet.tv,
[08:47.240 --> 08:49.800]  is by Shepard Ferry.
[08:49.800 --> 08:54.720]  And it's right here, it's his follow-up to his iconic Hope image.
[08:54.720 --> 08:59.360]  Now when you open it up, you know, it's this big article with David Bohemian Grove Club
[08:59.360 --> 09:01.920]  Gergen and Paul Krugman and Michael Moore.
[09:01.920 --> 09:04.560]  Obama, so far, there he is right here.
[09:04.560 --> 09:10.560]  And he really has the nerve to say, he fakes right and goes left, says Moore.
[09:10.560 --> 09:13.920]  I'll be shocked if he keeps 50,000 troops in Iraq.
[09:13.920 --> 09:19.280]  He just says those things to keep the opposition at bay.
[09:19.280 --> 09:23.600]  Who is in a delusional wonder world now, Mr. Moore?
[09:23.600 --> 09:27.020]  He doesn't say those things to keep the opposition at bay.
[09:27.020 --> 09:32.000]  He says those things because he works for the Wall Street establishment.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.240]  They're the ones that got him, quote, unquote, elected.
[09:35.240 --> 09:40.520]  A very loose term right now, election, please, give me a break.
[09:40.520 --> 09:45.440]  And speaking of Obama, we've got a story up at Infowars.com and PrismPlanet.tv right
[09:45.440 --> 09:51.840]  now about this censored image, at first they said, hey, the artist of this Obama joker
[09:51.840 --> 09:54.240]  filed a DMCA complaint.
[09:54.240 --> 09:55.240]  He did not.
[09:55.240 --> 09:57.640]  And then they said Time Magazine did it.
[09:57.640 --> 09:59.360]  No, they didn't either.
[09:59.360 --> 10:02.280]  Okay, so who's doing this?
[10:02.280 --> 10:05.440]  Flickr won't say, check it out.
[10:05.440 --> 10:07.600]  You'll remember that the image caused all uproar.
[10:07.600 --> 10:11.280]  Here's a list of most places where the story ran last week, after Flickr was reported to
[10:11.280 --> 10:16.560]  have removed the controversial image from Al Khalid's stream and their site.
[10:16.560 --> 10:20.000]  Flickr's defense of their removal of the image eventually came from community manager
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.020]  health camp in a help forum thread that has subsequently been shut down, who told Flickr
[10:26.020 --> 10:31.760]  users that the reason why the image was removed was that someone filed a DMCA request to take
[10:31.760 --> 10:33.840]  it down.
[10:33.840 --> 10:38.780]  In this instance, the Yahoo copyright team here is the U.S. received a complete notice
[10:38.780 --> 10:44.920]  of infringement as outlined by DMCA, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, stated Champ trying
[10:44.920 --> 10:51.560]  to deflect blame for the deletion of the controversial law, or a deletion on the controversial law.
[10:51.560 --> 10:54.520]  Now again, Time Magazine would have nothing here.
[10:54.520 --> 10:59.280]  Larry Flint of Hustler Magazine thought in court, I think it was either in the 70s or
[10:59.280 --> 11:01.880]  80s, to do these type of parodies.
[11:01.880 --> 11:08.240]  Now granted, his are a bit dirtier, but he said, look, this is free speech.
[11:08.240 --> 11:09.900]  This is political.
[11:09.900 --> 11:13.000]  I have a right to do this, and obviously that's what this is.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.080]  This image looks nothing like the actual time image.
[11:16.080 --> 11:17.920]  It has been altered beyond belief.
[11:17.920 --> 11:24.000]  So this guy, like I said, unless the actual creator of the piece here, of the Joker piece,
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.240]  filed that complaint, they haven't even if Time Magazine had filed the complaint, which
[11:27.240 --> 11:29.920]  they're saying in this article, they didn't.
[11:29.920 --> 11:30.920]  They didn't.
[11:30.920 --> 11:32.360]  It wouldn't hold up in court.
[11:32.360 --> 11:34.040]  It's an original image, folks.
[11:34.040 --> 11:35.240]  So the mystery continues.
[11:35.240 --> 11:40.400]  Why are they tearing this down, because it's gone viral and it shows our Lord and Savior,
[11:40.400 --> 11:45.120]  the Messiah, Barack Obama in a bad light, and they can't have that.
[11:45.120 --> 11:47.880]  All right, so here it is.
[11:47.880 --> 11:52.040]  Everything you need to know about the H1N1 vaccine.
[11:52.040 --> 11:53.040]  Take a look at it, folks.
[11:53.040 --> 11:55.200]  I mean, this is pure propaganda from Fox News.
[11:55.200 --> 11:57.480]  It's the follow-up propaganda from Fox News.
[11:57.480 --> 12:02.520]  See, they're allowed to expose what's going on on Wall Street and how bad the Democrats
[12:02.520 --> 12:04.800]  are with healthcare.
[12:04.800 --> 12:10.440]  Now that they're in the minority, but they still have to push the globalist propaganda
[12:10.440 --> 12:12.240]  that you need to take your shot.
[12:12.240 --> 12:17.040]  There's not going to be one mention in this article about people becoming quadriplegics.
[12:17.040 --> 12:21.840]  There's not going to be one mention in this article about people dying from the vaccine.
[12:21.840 --> 12:24.560]  Not one mention of what happened in 1976.
[12:24.560 --> 12:27.080]  Not one mention.
[12:27.080 --> 12:32.080]  Not one mention of the trial runs that are hurting people.
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.120]  Many questions are being raised about the rush to get an H1N1 vaccine into the hands
[12:37.120 --> 12:42.120]  of doctors before the virus reemerges this fall, possibly more dangerous and widespread
[12:42.120 --> 12:43.720]  than it was last spring.
[12:43.720 --> 12:46.000]  So they're already spooking you out in the first paragraph.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.600]  It's going to be more dangerous, more widespread.
[12:48.600 --> 12:50.040]  Here it comes.
[12:50.040 --> 12:53.520]  And those questions are brewing concern among many Americans wondering whether to risk putting
[12:53.520 --> 12:54.680]  off being vaccinated.
[12:54.680 --> 12:58.160]  See, whether to risk putting off being vaccinated.
[12:58.160 --> 13:01.640]  They're making it seem like you need to rush to go get it.
[13:01.640 --> 13:03.360]  Not whether or not you should take it.
[13:03.360 --> 13:04.360]  Whether you should put it off.
[13:04.360 --> 13:06.520]  No, you're going to take the shot.
[13:06.520 --> 13:10.960]  Or take a shot at beating the bug before it gains the upper hand.
[13:10.960 --> 13:14.200]  And then it has your H1N1 survival guide.
[13:14.200 --> 13:18.400]  They're pushing it as fast as they can, but they still have to meet good manufacturing
[13:18.400 --> 13:24.000]  standards, said Dr. Peter Gross, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Hackensack
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.400]  University Medical Center.
[13:25.400 --> 13:27.520]  You should be ashamed of yourself, Mr. Gross.
[13:27.520 --> 13:33.280]  It will be tested to make sure it's safe and contains the proper amount of protective antibodies.
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.640]  Meanwhile, they're jacking it up with mercury, already admitted, squalene.
[13:37.640 --> 13:41.480]  The mercury, by the way, they actually say they're going to make some mercury-free ones
[13:41.480 --> 13:44.200]  for some of the children and the pregnant women that are taking it.
[13:44.200 --> 13:46.800]  Meanwhile, they're the target audience and they're the first people they're going to
[13:46.800 --> 13:47.800]  vaccinate.
[13:47.800 --> 13:52.200]  So unless 100% of this vaccine is mercury-free, think about how many people they're going
[13:52.200 --> 13:53.840]  to give it to anyway.
[13:53.840 --> 13:55.200]  It's all semantic games.
[13:55.200 --> 13:56.200]  It's all lies.
[13:56.200 --> 13:59.760]  It's all the culture of liars, and we love it that they lie to us.
[13:59.760 --> 14:00.760]  We're going to get to that article.
[14:00.760 --> 14:01.760]  This is so important.
[14:01.760 --> 14:05.720]  I just went over it this morning and I was like, you know, this really does tell it like
[14:05.720 --> 14:06.720]  it is.
[14:06.720 --> 14:12.040]  This really says what we are as a society, where our morals are.
[14:12.040 --> 14:13.040]  And I'm not perfect.
[14:13.040 --> 14:14.040]  I know that.
[14:14.040 --> 14:15.040]  I'm far from perfect.
[14:15.040 --> 14:18.480]  I'm going to continue with this article and we'll get to that in a moment.
[14:18.480 --> 14:22.160]  Each year, scientists with the FDA, US Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the
[14:22.160 --> 14:25.880]  National Institutes of Health and Vaccine Manufacturers meet in January or February to
[14:25.880 --> 14:32.120]  decide which strains of the flu virus will be included in the seasonal flu vaccine.
[14:32.120 --> 14:35.400]  From there, the chosen strains are sent to the World Health Organization so that scientists
[14:35.400 --> 14:40.000]  can view the selected strains and make any necessary, though usually minor, changes.
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.760]  Meanwhile, no mention in this article, zero mention that it's H5N1, the bird flu virus,
[14:46.760 --> 14:51.760]  two separate strains of H1N1, the pig flu virus, and one strain of human flu virus.
[14:51.760 --> 14:53.040]  They're not mentioning that at all.
[14:53.040 --> 14:56.320]  They say, well, this is nothing new.
[14:56.320 --> 14:59.920]  And here's where they admit, though, the new virus, however, is different in that it contains
[14:59.920 --> 15:03.760]  a mix of human, bird, and swine flu strains of the virus.
[15:03.760 --> 15:05.680]  Just casually saying it.
[15:05.680 --> 15:06.680]  No big deal.
[15:06.680 --> 15:09.720]  And you're thinking to yourself, wait a minute, bird flu, isn't that more deadly?
[15:09.720 --> 15:12.720]  How does bird flu get in there?
[15:12.720 --> 15:18.080]  And again, it's lightly and sparsely mentioned in the media, but they never focus on that
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.720]  because then they have to focus on the fact that this was probably created in a bio weapons
[15:21.720 --> 15:22.840]  lab.
[15:22.840 --> 15:25.600]  Some people have gone public saying that.
[15:25.600 --> 15:28.560]  I think it was one of the guys that designed TamaFlu said that.
[15:28.560 --> 15:32.200]  I mean, come on, but only when he said it, though, it escaped.
[15:32.200 --> 15:33.680]  It mistakenly escaped.
[15:33.680 --> 15:36.120]  See, there's no way they would actually release it on purpose.
[15:36.120 --> 15:39.480]  You say that like the health minister out in India.
[15:39.480 --> 15:42.920]  All of a sudden, you're saying that the government and the Jews did it.
[15:42.920 --> 15:47.840]  At least that's the CFR propaganda that we saw in the Colbert Report.
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.360]  Let's see, an H1N1 strain has been included in the influenza vaccine every year since
[15:52.360 --> 15:54.800]  1977.
[15:54.800 --> 15:56.960]  And they're also saying that the process is a slow one.
[15:56.960 --> 16:00.880]  So they're not going to be able to give everybody it off the bat, but they're still again hitting
[16:00.880 --> 16:06.120]  the 20 to 40 year olds first, pregnant women and very young children.
[16:06.120 --> 16:11.120]  See, they figure they figure that the older people are just going to catch it from all
[16:11.120 --> 16:13.840]  the people they infect when they give them the shot.
[16:13.840 --> 16:15.680]  It's a sick joke.
[16:15.680 --> 16:18.480]  And then at the very end, it's three shots instead of one.
[16:18.480 --> 16:22.440]  These are potentially looking at three flu shots this year instead of the normal one
[16:22.440 --> 16:26.080]  shot that would include one of the seasonal flu.
[16:26.080 --> 16:27.320]  All right.
[16:27.320 --> 16:31.560]  So I'm already getting a Board of Education permission slips.
[16:31.560 --> 16:36.320]  Now this one is a lot more honest than some of the ones you're probably going to see for
[16:36.320 --> 16:38.480]  those of you out there that have children.
[16:38.480 --> 16:39.480]  Okay.
[16:39.480 --> 16:43.280]  Obviously, we have the school systems blacked out and whatnot, but here it is right here.
[16:43.280 --> 16:48.460]  The flu season is expected to be active with the threat of H1N1 virus swine flu.
[16:48.460 --> 16:53.440]  The seasonal flu, it is especially important that all families take precautions to avoid
[16:53.440 --> 16:55.480]  getting sick.
[16:55.480 --> 16:56.800]  Let's see.
[16:56.800 --> 17:02.400]  Blank hospital of blank plans to provide free seasonal flu, vaccine, flu injections
[17:02.400 --> 17:08.720]  and flu mist to all school students as well as all school staff in early November.
[17:08.720 --> 17:10.960]  So this is going to be free, folks.
[17:10.960 --> 17:12.440]  They're pumping it out freestyle.
[17:12.440 --> 17:13.880]  In fact, we read the story yesterday.
[17:13.880 --> 17:17.520]  They're willing to pay you $50 in some places to take this shot.
[17:17.520 --> 17:21.360]  The blank school's coordinated school health program and the school nurse are working with
[17:21.360 --> 17:29.240]  the health department to make available an H1N1 vaccination at no cost to all students
[17:29.240 --> 17:30.240]  and staff.
[17:30.240 --> 17:35.600]  The H1N1 vaccine will be given in two doses at least three weeks apart.
[17:35.600 --> 17:40.920]  So they're already talking about in this permission slip, two shots off the bat, a two spot.
[17:40.920 --> 17:44.400]  For planning purposes, it is important to have an idea of how many students will have
[17:44.400 --> 17:46.920]  parent permission to receive the immunizations.
[17:46.920 --> 17:50.440]  No child will receive an immunization without parent permission.
[17:50.440 --> 17:56.400]  So this is one of the better permission slips that I've seen, but this shows their intent.
[17:56.400 --> 17:57.560]  I will say this.
[17:57.560 --> 17:59.080]  This is not fear mongering.
[17:59.080 --> 18:01.840]  This is not saying kids won't be able to go to school.
[18:01.840 --> 18:06.220]  This is saying that they are not going to get the immunization without permission.
[18:06.220 --> 18:12.040]  Look for a lot more of these coming up and look for them to be a lot more deceptive than
[18:12.040 --> 18:13.720]  this one right here.
[18:13.720 --> 18:14.720]  Now check this one out.
[18:14.720 --> 18:18.040]  The company cleared to test swine flu vaccine fighting off liquidation.
[18:18.040 --> 18:19.040]  Okay.
[18:19.040 --> 18:23.560]  So the guys that are testing the swine flu vaccine right now are just calling to stay
[18:23.560 --> 18:25.720]  above water and make a profit.
[18:25.720 --> 18:26.720]  Geez.
[18:26.720 --> 18:29.960]  Do you think that they're going to rush through these tests and say whatever the establishment
[18:29.960 --> 18:32.680]  wants them to so they can stay in business?
[18:32.680 --> 18:33.680]  I wonder.
[18:33.680 --> 18:36.880]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal, by the way, as a new White House report raises
[18:36.880 --> 18:44.440]  the possibility that up to 50% of the US population could contract swine flu this season, 50%.
[18:44.440 --> 18:47.360]  These people are insane.
[18:47.360 --> 18:51.040]  One drug maker has come a step closer to distributing a vaccine.
[18:51.040 --> 18:55.480]  That is, if the involuntary bankruptcy filing against it doesn't get in the way, Protein
[18:55.480 --> 19:00.560]  Sciences Corporation of Meridian, Connecticut, is a privately held vaccine maker that last
[19:00.560 --> 19:06.000]  week won federal approval to kick off clinical trials of its vaccine for the H1N1 or swine
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.080]  flu virus.
[19:07.080 --> 19:12.360]  The Hartford-Corant reported that means Protein Scientist's Pan-Block vaccine will be tested
[19:12.360 --> 19:14.800]  on humans as soon as the next few weeks.
[19:14.800 --> 19:19.280]  Such trials have already started in Australia where winter and flu season are underway.
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.640]  The FDA stamp of approval doesn't mean it will be smooth sailing for Protein Sciences.
[19:23.640 --> 19:28.960]  However, the company was hit with an involuntary, involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing last
[19:28.960 --> 19:34.920]  month by three creditors owed $11.7 million.
[19:34.920 --> 19:37.320]  So again, these guys need to keep their head above water.
[19:37.320 --> 19:39.040]  The creditors want their money.
[19:39.040 --> 19:43.040]  They'll do whatever the establishment says.
[19:43.040 --> 19:44.880]  Roll up your sleeves, folks.
[19:44.880 --> 19:47.720]  Take the poison injection.
[19:47.720 --> 19:48.720]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[19:48.720 --> 20:18.560]  Jason Bermas sitting in Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and don't forget, TruthNews.us.
[20:18.560 --> 20:22.920]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[20:22.920 --> 20:23.920]  seeds.
[20:23.920 --> 20:29.040]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[20:29.040 --> 20:30.920]  food for you and your family.
[20:30.920 --> 20:32.000]  And here's the best part.
[20:32.000 --> 20:36.240]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[20:36.240 --> 20:38.720]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[20:38.720 --> 20:41.960]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[20:41.960 --> 20:48.800]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[20:48.800 --> 20:52.800]  That's 877-327-0365.
[20:52.800 --> 20:57.760]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[20:57.760 --> 21:01.480]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[21:01.480 --> 21:06.760]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[21:06.760 --> 21:12.760]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[21:12.760 --> 21:14.880]  just as well-funded.
[21:14.880 --> 21:20.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.480]  of the American people.
[21:21.480 --> 21:25.600]  While Obama's already fudging, he has fudged since day one in this election.
[21:25.600 --> 21:31.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[21:31.000 --> 21:37.520]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[21:37.520 --> 21:41.080]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[21:41.080 --> 21:47.960]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[22:01.600 --> 22:03.840]  Hi, John Hoomner from Mitus Resources.

[22:06.760 --> 22:10.480]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess

[22:15.360 --> 22:19.040]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[22:19.040 --> 22:23.600]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.

[22:35.480 --> 22:38.680]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[22:38.680 --> 22:43.080]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for
[22:43.080 --> 22:45.720]  the United States to be the next target.
[22:45.720 --> 22:51.480]  Hear your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.

[23:01.040 --> 23:04.720]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[23:04.720 --> 23:09.160]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood
[23:09.160 --> 23:14.960]  pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clondardaries.
[23:14.960 --> 23:20.040]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem
[23:20.040 --> 23:22.360]  and leave you with horrible side effects.

[28:17.720 --> 28:23.000]  Yes, the health bill may cost us our lives in the end, but what kind of a life are we
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.040]  going to have when our electric bills go up four times and we're not allowed to have
[28:27.040 --> 28:31.360]  two cars per family and they start putting restrictions on the amount of children we're
[28:31.360 --> 28:36.240]  able to have and they start charging us to send our children to school if it's too many.
[28:36.240 --> 28:37.240]  What happens then?
[28:37.240 --> 28:39.640]  I mean, that's what we're lying to ourselves about.
[28:39.640 --> 28:42.240]  We're lying to ourselves that Ted Kennedy was a great man.
[28:42.240 --> 28:43.740]  He was not a great man.
[28:43.740 --> 28:47.920]  And by the way, as I predicted yesterday, this garbage is everywhere.
[28:47.920 --> 28:49.520]  It's even on the infotainment channels.
[28:49.520 --> 28:53.600]  I'm up at like two or three in the morning sometimes last night, you know, I'm clicking
[28:53.600 --> 28:56.360]  through the stations and all I get is what the antenna gets.
[28:56.360 --> 28:58.920]  So I get the main three and some other ones.
[28:58.920 --> 29:03.000]  So you know, I'm watching the Hollywood insider Ted Kennedy's there.
[29:03.000 --> 29:04.640]  I'm watching entertainment tonight.
[29:04.640 --> 29:09.240]  Ted Kennedy's there and it's like Ted Kennedy on a yacht and he championed all these workers'
[29:09.240 --> 29:12.560]  rights and I have to hear about no child left behind.
[29:12.560 --> 29:13.960]  It's all garbage.
[29:13.960 --> 29:15.840]  Head start program.
[29:15.840 --> 29:22.560]  Look, like I said yesterday, I forgot to mention that his nephew got killed as well.
[29:22.560 --> 29:24.040]  Let's face it, JFK Jr.
[29:24.040 --> 29:25.040]  His death stinks as well.
[29:25.040 --> 29:26.640]  And he didn't step up then either.
[29:26.640 --> 29:28.640]  He didn't step up on his deathbed.
[29:28.640 --> 29:31.800]  He didn't call out the criminals that killed his family.
[29:31.800 --> 29:35.680]  So again, I got no love for him and now the establishment is using his death to try to
[29:35.680 --> 29:36.960]  promote this health reform.
[29:36.960 --> 29:37.960]  Oh, he had brain cancer.
[29:37.960 --> 29:41.600]  If we caught it early enough with this new health bill, everything would be okay.
[29:41.600 --> 29:42.600]  That's the Alex Jones Show.
[29:42.600 --> 29:51.960]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in PrisonPlanet.TVInfoWars.com.
[29:51.960 --> 29:53.240]  We're on the march.
[29:53.240 --> 29:55.680]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:55.680 --> 30:00.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.560 --> 30:04.960]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[30:04.960 --> 30:05.960]  this summer.
[30:05.960 --> 30:09.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[30:09.880 --> 30:14.440]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[30:14.440 --> 30:15.680]  allows you to have.
[30:15.680 --> 30:16.680]  It's true.
[30:16.680 --> 30:20.840]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[30:20.840 --> 30:24.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[30:24.880 --> 30:27.360]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[30:27.360 --> 30:30.920]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[30:30.920 --> 30:34.600]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[30:34.600 --> 30:39.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[30:39.400 --> 30:43.760]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solution from Science, a long time
[30:43.760 --> 30:44.920]  sponsor of ours.
[30:44.920 --> 30:49.680]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[30:49.680 --> 30:51.320]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[30:51.320 --> 30:55.920]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[30:55.920 --> 31:01.800]  toll free 877-327-0365.
[31:01.800 --> 31:07.840]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:07.840 --> 31:12.320]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[31:12.320 --> 31:13.640]  us would like to see.
[31:13.640 --> 31:18.720]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests
[31:18.720 --> 31:19.920]  of the American people.
[31:19.920 --> 31:21.920]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[31:21.920 --> 31:24.480]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[31:24.480 --> 31:29.600]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[31:29.600 --> 31:37.680]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[31:37.680 --> 31:41.280]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one world government.
[31:41.280 --> 31:48.200]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[31:48.200 --> 31:53.800]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high
[31:53.800 --> 31:56.360]  quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[31:56.360 --> 31:59.440]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[31:59.440 --> 32:05.200]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[32:05.200 --> 32:07.840]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[32:07.840 --> 32:11.880]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a
[32:11.880 --> 32:16.000]  great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day,
[32:16.000 --> 32:17.520]  there is no job security.
[32:17.520 --> 32:22.280]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood
[32:22.280 --> 32:23.800]  and own your own business.
[32:23.800 --> 32:26.400]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[32:26.400 --> 32:32.080]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people
[32:32.080 --> 32:36.360]  on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[32:36.360 --> 32:41.040]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing
[32:41.040 --> 32:45.360]  of helpful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive
[32:45.360 --> 32:47.280]  compounding monthly income.
[32:47.280 --> 32:51.240]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[32:51.240 --> 32:54.080]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[32:54.080 --> 32:57.840]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[32:57.840 --> 33:21.720]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[33:21.720 --> 33:23.440]  Alright folks, we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[33:23.440 --> 33:25.640]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in for the first hour.
[33:25.640 --> 33:29.320]  Alex coming up in the second, third and fourth hours.
[33:29.320 --> 33:31.360]  You know, this is a really important one to cover.
[33:31.360 --> 33:35.000]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.760]  Agency that insures bank deposits may need help.
[33:37.760 --> 33:39.600]  This is the state of denial that we're in.
[33:39.600 --> 33:44.400]  It will allow someone like Timothy Geithner to sit up there and say, no, the Fed is transparent
[33:44.400 --> 33:47.160]  and Bernac, you'll say, no, the Fed is transparent.
[33:47.160 --> 33:48.760]  Yeah, we have to answer to Congress.
[33:48.760 --> 33:51.800]  Yeah, we have to answer to Congress.
[33:51.800 --> 33:54.840]  And then Bernie Sanders, the Senator, gets up there and he says, tell us who got the
[33:54.840 --> 33:58.840]  money and what does Bernac, you say back to him?
[33:58.840 --> 34:02.440]  No, no.
[34:02.440 --> 34:08.120]  They're about as transparent as a lead beam, basically.
[34:08.120 --> 34:10.720]  That's about how transparent you can see right through that lead beam.
[34:10.720 --> 34:11.720]  Can't you folks?
[34:11.720 --> 34:12.720]  That's what they'll tell you.
[34:12.720 --> 34:13.720]  They'll stare right at you.
[34:13.720 --> 34:14.720]  You can see right through it.
[34:14.720 --> 34:15.720]  Give me a break.
[34:15.720 --> 34:21.760]  So, agency that insures bank deposits may need help and remember, this is the IMF system
[34:21.760 --> 34:27.000]  merging with the World Bank, creating a new world currency.
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  The SDR units.
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.960]  In fact, if we went over to, forget which website it is, but if you just type in special
[34:32.960 --> 34:38.960]  drawing rights units and then conversion up all, you can see how much there were.
[34:38.960 --> 34:40.440]  They actually have a value now.
[34:40.440 --> 34:46.040]  And I think per one unit, which is like a dollar, I guess, we're worth 60 cents.
[34:46.040 --> 34:51.360]  And my last check was when I was in DC with Tarpley and the denar seemed to be the most
[34:51.360 --> 34:52.880]  valued currency out there.
[34:52.880 --> 34:54.960]  We were like the fifth or sixth most valued currency.
[34:54.960 --> 34:56.840]  We're not at the top of the heap anymore, folks.
[34:56.840 --> 34:59.360]  We're far from it.
[34:59.360 --> 35:03.520]  The government agency that guarantees Americans won't lose their money in a bank failure may
[35:03.520 --> 35:05.600]  need a lifeline of its own.
[35:05.600 --> 35:07.960]  Oh, so you mean my money's not safe in a bank?
[35:07.960 --> 35:12.720]  You mean the FDIC who's supposed to make sure that my money's safe in a bank isn't safe
[35:12.720 --> 35:13.720]  at all?
[35:13.720 --> 35:14.720]  Of course not.
[35:14.720 --> 35:15.720]  They're printing the money out of nowhere.
[35:15.720 --> 35:17.680]  There's no backing.
[35:17.680 --> 35:23.000]  The coffers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp have been so depleted by the epidemic
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.440]  of collapsing financial institutions that analysts warn it could sink into the red by the end
[35:28.440 --> 35:29.720]  of this year.
[35:29.720 --> 35:33.480]  And there it is up there for prismplanet.tv members.
[35:33.480 --> 35:35.280]  Scroll down and see what's that.
[35:35.280 --> 35:37.600]  A pound is worth a little bit.
[35:37.600 --> 35:38.600]  Look at that.
[35:38.600 --> 35:39.600]  It's right on the top.
[35:39.600 --> 35:40.600]  Scroll back up.
[35:40.600 --> 35:46.760]  A pound is worth a little bit more than one SDR unit, 0.10767, blah, blah, blah.
[35:46.760 --> 35:50.840]  Now a dollar is only worth 0.63.
[35:50.840 --> 35:58.520]  That means that the pound is about 40% more value than our little dollar ru, okay?
[35:58.520 --> 36:00.000]  And those are just two of the currencies.
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.760]  You really need to see how desperate we are.
[36:02.760 --> 36:05.180]  SDR equals world currency.
[36:05.180 --> 36:11.360]  Just because they don't have a coin yet or a bill yet doesn't mean this isn't a global
[36:11.360 --> 36:12.680]  governance grab.
[36:12.680 --> 36:14.240]  It's exactly what it is.
[36:14.240 --> 36:15.240]  It's exactly what it is.
[36:15.240 --> 36:18.920]  Meanwhile, they're telling you they're now announcing it, that the people that insure
[36:18.920 --> 36:20.800]  your, maybe there will be a bank holiday folks.
[36:20.800 --> 36:23.960]  I'm not one of those guys that goes off these predictions that there's definitely gonna be
[36:23.960 --> 36:25.960]  a bank holiday on this and this date.
[36:25.960 --> 36:29.120]  And yes, the economy's going to plunge by this and this date.
[36:29.120 --> 36:32.720]  Look, if you got gold and silver, you might be okay.
[36:32.720 --> 36:34.920]  Midas resources, that's not devaluing.
[36:34.920 --> 36:35.920]  That's going up in value.
[36:35.920 --> 36:39.720]  In fact, the last time I checked, I think gold was at like 950 or 960 an ounce.
[36:39.720 --> 36:45.080]  Again, when I started listening to Alex Jones in 2003, it was under 300 an ounce.
[36:45.080 --> 36:46.080]  Do the math.
[36:46.080 --> 36:47.080]  Okay.
[36:47.080 --> 36:50.600]  It tripled in value in under, in just over five years.
[36:50.600 --> 36:55.480]  I'd say under 10 years, but it's just over five years, six years, six years, tripled
[36:55.480 --> 36:56.480]  in value.
[36:56.480 --> 37:00.200]  Meanwhile, the FDIC is now saying it doesn't have any money.
[37:00.200 --> 37:05.400]  Well, if the FDIC doesn't have any money and your banks don't have any money, then
[37:05.400 --> 37:07.480]  you don't have any money.
[37:07.480 --> 37:08.480]  And guess what?
[37:08.480 --> 37:10.840]  The offshore banksters out there, they already took all the money.
[37:10.840 --> 37:14.840]  They converted it and they put it into offshore accounts.
[37:14.840 --> 37:21.520]  They gave out billions in bonuses when they eluded us for 24 trillion and counting.
[37:21.520 --> 37:24.200]  What did you think was going to happen?
[37:24.200 --> 37:27.200]  Give me a break.
[37:27.200 --> 37:30.980]  That has only happened once before, so this has only happened once before during the savings
[37:30.980 --> 37:35.520]  and loan crisis of the early 1990s when the FDIC was forced to borrow 15 billion from
[37:35.520 --> 37:40.480]  the treasury and repay it later with interest, 15 billion seems like a drop in the bucket
[37:40.480 --> 37:41.720]  at this point.
[37:41.720 --> 37:46.640]  And we're openly talking now about $24 trillion.
[37:46.640 --> 37:47.720]  What is 15 billion?
[37:47.720 --> 37:49.960]  It's not even comparable.
[37:49.960 --> 37:53.640]  And we're only talking about a little over a decade ago.
[37:53.640 --> 37:55.840]  We're not talking about 30, 40 years ago.
[37:55.840 --> 38:02.360]  No, a little over a decade ago, 15 billion from the treasury.
[38:02.360 --> 38:06.000]  On Thursday, the agency reveals how much it's left in its reserves.
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.000]  Yeah, right.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.440]  I guarantee they're supposed to announce that today.
[38:09.440 --> 38:14.440]  I guarantee it's a bunch of garbled jargon and they don't tell you how much is really
[38:14.440 --> 38:15.440]  there.
[38:15.440 --> 38:17.480]  And so it's what they always do.
[38:17.480 --> 38:23.000]  FDIC chairman Sheila Baer may also use the quarterly briefing to say how the agency plans to shore
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  up its accounts.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.800]  Small and mid-sized banks across the United States have been hurt by rising loan defaults
[38:27.800 --> 38:28.880]  in the recession.
[38:28.880 --> 38:33.680]  When they fail, the FDIC is responsible for making sure depositors don't lose a cent.
[38:33.680 --> 38:38.680]  And yesterday, we did mention that the second largest bank in the United States went under.
[38:38.680 --> 38:40.680]  It's in Texas.
[38:40.680 --> 38:41.680]  Where is that article?
[38:41.680 --> 38:42.760]  That article should be right here.
[38:42.760 --> 38:45.320]  We covered it yesterday, but yes, that's right.
[38:45.320 --> 38:49.160]  Went under in Texas and they're just going to keep going under and just keep going down
[38:49.160 --> 38:51.120]  and they're going to go after the local banks first.
[38:51.120 --> 38:54.040]  Again, this is a consolidation of power.
[38:54.040 --> 38:55.720]  Do you understand?
[38:55.720 --> 39:01.640]  They have to get all the local banks so that they can grab up with the big banks, the big,
[39:01.640 --> 39:07.120]  the most corrupt banks like Chase Manhattan, like Bank of America that merged like Merrill
[39:07.120 --> 39:08.280]  Lynch.
[39:08.280 --> 39:12.080]  They want to be the only players in the game so that they can just change the currency
[39:12.080 --> 39:14.200]  whenever they like.
[39:14.200 --> 39:15.520]  That's what's up.
[39:15.520 --> 39:16.720]  That's what it's all about.
[39:16.720 --> 39:20.520]  This is nothing more than a power grab, okay?
[39:20.520 --> 39:27.000]  This has nothing to do with saving the economy or giving back to the American people.
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.720]  This has everything to do with cutting out the small banksters, the people who might be
[39:32.720 --> 39:41.120]  semi-honest and just looting everything for a new international system, a new world order,
[39:41.120 --> 39:42.120]  okay?
[39:42.120 --> 39:43.280]  That's their terminology.
[39:43.280 --> 39:44.880]  That's why I'm making this film.
[39:44.880 --> 39:49.240]  That's why Invisible Empire is soon going to exist because people have to understand that
[39:49.240 --> 39:54.640]  the only people that are using this term outside of Alex Jones, myself, other pundits who are
[39:54.640 --> 39:58.600]  against it are the power elite and their minions.
[39:58.600 --> 40:00.840]  That's who uses the term new world order.
[40:00.840 --> 40:06.440]  It's not some kind of fancy pants, leprechaun, unicorn terminology over rainbows and gold,
[40:06.440 --> 40:07.440]  okay?
[40:07.440 --> 40:09.720]  It's something that has been used throughout history.
[40:09.720 --> 40:12.600]  I mean, Napoleon actually talked about a new world order.
[40:12.600 --> 40:14.680]  Hitler, of course, talked about a new world order.
[40:14.680 --> 40:18.200]  Every time they talk about it, they're talking about a tyrannical system of government where
[40:18.200 --> 40:24.440]  they and their cronies rule over a dictatorship.
[40:24.440 --> 40:28.800]  I'm not saying that's not something we really have right now, but it's a soft dictatorship.
[40:28.800 --> 40:30.480]  There's still the illusion that we have freedom.
[40:30.480 --> 40:31.480]  We still have some freedoms.
[40:31.480 --> 40:33.240]  We still have some recourses.
[40:33.240 --> 40:34.440]  Most of them have been taken away.
[40:34.440 --> 40:39.040]  I mean, again, when you see Bernanke up there just saying, oh, we're transparent, then they
[40:39.040 --> 40:42.440]  get asked who the bank's got the money, and he says no.
[40:42.440 --> 40:47.280]  And then Geithner goes, well, 1207, we can't let it get political.
[40:47.280 --> 40:48.280]  What does that even mean?
[40:48.280 --> 40:51.040]  We can't let it get political.
[40:51.040 --> 40:55.880]  The books from the Federal Reserve have nothing to do with politics unless you're being corrupt
[40:55.880 --> 40:58.800]  and you're giving your friends all this money, which is what you're doing.
[40:58.800 --> 40:59.800]  That's what you're doing.
[40:59.800 --> 41:05.160]  You're expecting your globalist masters, and that's why you don't want us to audit
[41:05.160 --> 41:06.160]  the Fed.
[41:06.160 --> 41:08.920]  I don't know what's going to happen if the FDIC goes under.
[41:08.920 --> 41:10.960]  I am not an economist.
[41:10.960 --> 41:15.240]  Maybe Bob Chapman could tell you internationalforecaster.com.
[41:15.240 --> 41:19.360]  I'm sure this is going to be the hot topic next week on the show, especially if it just
[41:19.360 --> 41:24.800]  continues to get worse, but all the excuses they give you are just going to be a bunch
[41:24.800 --> 41:26.920]  of Johnny Nonsense folks.
[41:26.920 --> 41:28.160]  They want to gut this economy.
[41:28.160 --> 41:29.680]  They're going to continue to do so.
[41:29.680 --> 41:31.240]  They want a North American Union.
[41:31.240 --> 41:33.280]  A lot of people say they're going to scrap the North American Union.
[41:33.280 --> 41:34.280]  I don't believe that.
[41:34.280 --> 41:35.920]  They may not call it the North American Union.
[41:35.920 --> 41:39.480]  They may just pass a couple of treaties and build a little more infrastructure and let
[41:39.480 --> 41:45.440]  it go in its little incremental state, but it's going to happen unless we step up to
[41:45.440 --> 41:47.240]  the plate and fight it tooth and nail.
[41:47.240 --> 41:48.240]  All right.
[41:48.240 --> 41:50.000]  I want to shift gears here for a moment.
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.880]  Didn't get to cover this story yesterday, but I think it's worth covering, especially
[41:53.880 --> 41:56.960]  with my little YouTube rant in the beginning.
[41:56.960 --> 42:01.600]  YouTube to share ad money with video makers of unexpected internet hits.
[42:01.600 --> 42:09.280]  So now you make an internet hit like my new haircut or the Obama deception, perhaps.
[42:09.280 --> 42:12.960]  And YouTube's going to contact you with an email and then you're going to have to sign
[42:12.960 --> 42:18.160]  something and then you'll make money on the things they advertise for this movie or for
[42:18.160 --> 42:24.360]  your little short, basically put in like a 20 or 30 second ad in the beginning that you
[42:24.360 --> 42:27.320]  can't fast forward through and then play your film.
[42:27.320 --> 42:29.840]  Now it doesn't say what the specifications are going to be.
[42:29.840 --> 42:30.920]  I'm a little wary on it.
[42:30.920 --> 42:33.880]  I don't know if they're ever going to promote, you know, the material that we promote here
[42:33.880 --> 42:36.440]  at info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[42:36.440 --> 42:40.960]  It looks like they're going to just promote mindlessness, which is what they're good at.
[42:40.960 --> 42:45.440]  But I wonder if, if we do get big enough and all of a sudden we get this email from YouTube
[42:45.440 --> 42:49.720]  who constantly censors us, do they have a right to our material?
[42:49.720 --> 42:51.440]  All of a sudden do we lose rights on our material?
[42:51.440 --> 42:53.440]  Are they allowed to use it in any which way they can?
[42:53.440 --> 42:56.960]  So I guess, you know, as soon as one of our listeners gets one of these emails, I would
[42:56.960 --> 42:57.960]  love to see it.
[42:57.960 --> 42:58.960]  I'd like to see the terms.
[42:58.960 --> 43:02.520]  I'm not necessarily against people getting paid for their content, especially if they're
[43:02.520 --> 43:04.040]  going to sell advertising on the page.
[43:04.040 --> 43:07.040]  I think this is actually a positive move.
[43:07.040 --> 43:13.760]  But again, I'd have to see what kind of contract they're going to get you to sign.
[43:13.760 --> 43:17.800]  Climate Camp London Day 2 Live.
[43:17.800 --> 43:21.720]  Follow these developments from Climate Camp's main camp on Blackheath, Southeast London and
[43:21.720 --> 43:25.120]  protesters direct action against big business in the city.
[43:25.120 --> 43:29.840]  See, these are well-meaning idiots who think that things like cap and trader are a good
[43:29.840 --> 43:34.000]  thing and we're murdering trees and, you know, this whole environmental movement and the
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.280]  green movement is going up against the establishment, Hey folks, I got news for you.
[43:38.280 --> 43:40.400]  It's not pollution isn't going to end.
[43:40.400 --> 43:44.800]  It's probably going to get worse because all you're allowing them to do is now buy the
[43:44.800 --> 43:46.520]  right to pollute.
[43:46.520 --> 43:49.600]  And if you think they're actually going to be buying these carbon credits, no, they're
[43:49.600 --> 43:50.600]  going to be giving them.
[43:50.600 --> 43:55.000]  We covered that yesterday, a bunch of big corporations are already just going to be given these
[43:55.000 --> 43:56.000]  carbon credits.
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.000]  Okay.
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.360]  It'll be just like the corporate welfare of today.
[43:59.360 --> 44:04.560]  The difference is it will be a global tax on the average American citizen.
[44:04.560 --> 44:08.120]  You're not going to get away with having your AC on too high.
[44:08.120 --> 44:11.080]  You're not going to get away with six bags of garbage.
[44:11.080 --> 44:14.440]  You're not going to get away with using too much to ply toilet paper.
[44:14.440 --> 44:15.440]  Yeah.
[44:15.440 --> 44:21.400]  There's actually articles in the last few months in mainline media that America's consumption
[44:21.400 --> 44:26.000]  of two ply toilet paper is actually worse for the environment than SUVs.
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.240]  What I'm not supposed to be able to wipe my bottom.
[44:28.240 --> 44:29.760]  I mean, what is this?
[44:29.760 --> 44:30.760]  What is this madness?
[44:30.760 --> 44:31.760]  Yes.
[44:31.760 --> 44:33.000]  That is a madness.
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.840]  When you hear things proposed like that, but we're just going along.
[44:36.840 --> 44:37.840]  Nothing's wrong.
[44:37.840 --> 44:38.840]  Nothing's wrong.
[44:38.840 --> 44:39.840]  My phone works great.
[44:39.840 --> 44:40.840]  I love it.
[44:40.840 --> 44:41.840]  I like my Blu-ray player.
[44:41.840 --> 44:42.840]  Look at me.
[44:42.840 --> 44:43.840]  50 inch television.
[44:43.840 --> 44:46.000]  I'm on my car.
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  Look at my house.
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.400]  I got a nice condo.
[44:48.400 --> 44:50.440]  That's what we're concerned with.
[44:50.440 --> 44:52.880]  My sports team's doing real good.
[44:52.880 --> 44:54.080]  Look at those Phillies go.
[44:54.080 --> 44:57.920]  Actually, I'm pretty stoked about the Yankees on their win streak as well.
[44:57.920 --> 45:00.120]  That's only, I don't even get to watch the games, folks.
[45:00.120 --> 45:04.160]  I get to maybe check out the sports section two or three times a week while I'm going
[45:04.160 --> 45:05.920]  through the news for this program.
[45:05.920 --> 45:10.320]  I'm not saying you have to give up everything in life and just become totally obsessed with
[45:10.320 --> 45:14.120]  the parapolitics of today, the politics that matter, the reality of the situation.
[45:14.120 --> 45:18.760]  I am saying you need to wake the hell up, find the issues that matter to you that are
[45:18.760 --> 45:23.360]  going to affect your life, which are plentiful at this point, and step up to the plate, swing
[45:23.360 --> 45:24.360]  the bat.
[45:24.360 --> 45:25.360]  Okay.
[45:25.360 --> 45:26.360]  Tell your neighbors.
[45:26.360 --> 45:27.360]  Tell your friends.
[45:27.360 --> 45:28.360]  Tell your families.
[45:28.360 --> 45:29.920]  Go out to city council meetings.
[45:29.920 --> 45:30.920]  Okay.
[45:30.920 --> 45:34.600]  Go to these town halls is what they're calling them.
[45:34.600 --> 45:35.600]  They're anything but town halls.
[45:35.600 --> 45:36.600]  I mean, I was watching one.
[45:36.600 --> 45:37.600]  I think I was yesterday.
[45:37.600 --> 45:38.600]  I was watching one.
[45:38.600 --> 45:41.800]  And the lady starts asking a real question that's not on the card.
[45:41.800 --> 45:44.560]  And the guy just goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[45:44.560 --> 45:46.440]  Listen, that's not on the card.
[45:46.440 --> 45:47.880]  Please read the question on the card.
[45:47.880 --> 45:53.560]  How dare I have to answer something that hasn't been pre-screened by my handlers?
[45:53.560 --> 46:01.360]  I mean, folks, we are, we are at a dark period in this country and the world when newsweeks
[46:01.360 --> 46:03.880]  openly saying we're a society of liars.
[46:03.880 --> 46:04.880]  And we are.
[46:04.880 --> 46:05.880]  I mean, that's an honest article.
[46:05.880 --> 46:11.280]  We're a society of liars that lie to ourselves in the morning when we wake up, when we go
[46:11.280 --> 46:16.160]  to bed at night, when we go to work, when we talk to our families, and they're right.
[46:16.160 --> 46:17.360]  We do lie to our children.
[46:17.360 --> 46:19.200]  We don't tell them how bad it is out there.
[46:19.200 --> 46:20.720]  We don't prepare them for the real world.
[46:20.720 --> 46:24.960]  We send them off into government institutions and let them think what their teacher is saying
[46:24.960 --> 46:30.200]  is, is the almighty word and that Barack Obama is going to save us all and that we made big
[46:30.200 --> 46:32.440]  strides to get him elected.
[46:32.440 --> 46:38.360]  Look, if we had gotten a real, real candidate in there, you know, a lot of people will say
[46:38.360 --> 46:39.760]  Jason Burmese is a racist.
[46:39.760 --> 46:42.120]  I voted for a black woman, folks.
[46:42.120 --> 46:43.620]  I would have gone with the two-spot.
[46:43.620 --> 46:46.720]  You know, we could have, we could have had a woman as president and a black woman as
[46:46.720 --> 46:47.720]  president.
[46:47.720 --> 46:49.920]  It would have been great because she stood for the right issues.
[46:49.920 --> 46:51.440]  I voted Cynthia McKinney.
[46:51.440 --> 46:53.360]  I may not be for everything McKinney's for.
[46:53.360 --> 46:57.560]  She's a bit of a gun grabber, bit of a leftist, but at least she's honest.
[46:57.560 --> 46:58.560]  Okay.
[46:58.560 --> 47:02.240]  At least she's trying to take on the status quo.
[47:02.240 --> 47:04.360]  And she gets no press coverage.
[47:04.360 --> 47:08.120]  I mean, for the third party candidates, I think she got the least out of everybody and that
[47:08.120 --> 47:14.360]  includes people like Ralph Nader and Chuck Baldwin and of course, Bob Barr, Cynthia McKinney
[47:14.360 --> 47:16.000]  is who you heard about the least.
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.760]  And I really do believe because she was the most dangerous to the establishment.
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.680]  They didn't want her to become a quote unquote cult of personality like Ron Paul did.
[47:24.680 --> 47:27.640]  And you know, a lot of people complain, oh, I gave money to the Ron Paul Money Bomb.
[47:27.640 --> 47:28.640]  He didn't win.
[47:28.640 --> 47:31.920]  Folks, he stayed in it to win it as long as he possibly could.
[47:31.920 --> 47:34.960]  He was in these debates interjecting real issues.
[47:34.960 --> 47:39.560]  He became huge during and after the elections.
[47:39.560 --> 47:42.480]  His predictions about the economy have actually come true.
[47:42.480 --> 47:45.520]  More and more people listen to his message every day.
[47:45.520 --> 47:51.040]  And now his son, Rand Paul, is trying to get a seat in the Senate to continue the legacy
[47:51.040 --> 47:55.320]  of challenge, of freedom, of liberty in this country.
[47:55.320 --> 47:58.080]  I don't see many of us, of us out there doing that.
[47:58.080 --> 48:04.360]  You know, it takes a lot to dedicate yourself to going up against a political Leviathan
[48:04.360 --> 48:08.720]  like this system has become, whether you're Ron Paul's son or not.
[48:08.720 --> 48:13.400]  And how many of you out there can say, yeah, I stand for something and I'm willing to show
[48:13.400 --> 48:14.400]  it.
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.520]  I am willing to run for Congress, for state Senate, for mayor of my little town.
[48:18.520 --> 48:22.760]  I am willing to go to the board meeting up at my school and say, no, my children are
[48:22.760 --> 48:25.040]  not going to take this wine flu vaccination.
[48:25.040 --> 48:27.000]  And I suggest your children don't either.
[48:27.000 --> 48:33.520]  How many of you are going to go up with a laptop in hand?
[48:33.520 --> 48:40.040]  Pull up the clip from 1979 where 60 minutes talks about the 76 flu pandemic and how it
[48:40.040 --> 48:42.840]  gave Gillian's bear to all these people, how it killed all these people.
[48:42.840 --> 48:43.840]  How many are you going to do that?
[48:43.840 --> 48:45.640]  Because I guarantee you do that.
[48:45.640 --> 48:47.520]  You're going to turn some heads.
[48:47.520 --> 48:51.000]  Some people in the PTA are going to go, wait a minute, I'm not letting my kid take this
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  either.
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  This is insanity.
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.840]  How many people are going to print off the Bloomberg article that Baxter sent live bird
[48:58.840 --> 49:02.520]  flu virus out to 14 separate countries in its trials?
[49:02.520 --> 49:07.840]  How many people are going to do that and then say, Hey, this is the company they want to
[49:07.840 --> 49:10.200]  give us the vaccinations.
[49:10.200 --> 49:15.520]  How many people are going to break out executive order 13, 375 where they say, you know what?
[49:15.520 --> 49:20.600]  You don't want to take this one year in prison, $250,000 fine.
[49:20.600 --> 49:25.920]  Who's going to go get the pandemic preparedness planning checklist from the WHO and say, look,
[49:25.920 --> 49:30.240]  we're under level six right now, right now, it can't get any worse.
[49:30.240 --> 49:31.520]  People could be dying in the streets.
[49:31.520 --> 49:33.160]  It can't get any worse than this.
[49:33.160 --> 49:35.440]  And this, what does it says about your human rights?
[49:35.440 --> 49:37.720]  It says you don't have any.
[49:37.720 --> 49:41.280]  It says it's quarantine town USA under international law.
[49:41.280 --> 49:43.280]  It says we can take your buildings.
[49:43.280 --> 49:46.240]  It says we can do what we have to.
[49:46.240 --> 49:47.240]  And they're not just saying it.
[49:47.240 --> 49:49.040]  They're holding conferences on it.
[49:49.040 --> 49:52.000]  They're prepping the public.
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.760]  They're telling you all you need to know on Fox News, yet they don't tell you anything
[49:55.760 --> 49:56.760]  you need to know.
[49:56.760 --> 49:59.880]  They just tell you to shut up and take your shot.
[49:59.880 --> 50:04.480]  And it's being echoed on the other side because remember, oh, there's a left and a right.
[50:04.480 --> 50:07.400]  You know, if you want to believe in that for false paradigm, they're printing almost the
[50:07.400 --> 50:11.580]  same exact article at MSNBC.
[50:11.580 --> 50:17.920]  So why is it that Fox and MSNBC are parroting the same exact propaganda and information for
[50:17.920 --> 50:18.920]  you?
[50:18.920 --> 50:20.480]  I don't think that is.
[50:20.480 --> 50:23.480]  It's because they want you to roll up your sleeve and take the poison.
[50:23.480 --> 50:26.120]  This truly is a eugenics operation.
[50:26.120 --> 50:28.680]  And in my mind, a soft kill weapon.
[50:28.680 --> 50:33.360]  I don't think we're going to see, you know, millions of people dying in the streets or
[50:33.360 --> 50:35.640]  hundreds of thousands of people getting sick.
[50:35.640 --> 50:37.360]  I think they're going to keep it pretty quiet.
[50:37.360 --> 50:42.400]  You'll probably see, you know, maybe 10, 20,000 people die, maybe another 50 or 60 get really
[50:42.400 --> 50:45.760]  sick from the thing, but it'll be very hush hush.
[50:45.760 --> 50:49.520]  Meanwhile, you just took a live cancer vaccine and 20 years down the line, you ain't going
[50:49.520 --> 50:50.520]  to be doing so hot.
[50:50.520 --> 50:51.520]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[50:51.520 --> 50:54.520]  I am Jason Burmese, prisonplanet.tvinfowars.com.
[50:54.520 --> 51:06.240]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters also known as RFID chips in millions
[51:06.240 --> 51:09.920]  of passports, credit cards and licenses in the current state of the economy?
[51:09.920 --> 51:14.320]  It's no surprise that identity theft has increased with current technology thieves can purchase
[51:14.320 --> 51:18.200]  a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal
[51:18.200 --> 51:20.800]  information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[51:20.800 --> 51:23.620]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[51:23.620 --> 51:26.600]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[51:26.600 --> 51:27.600]  Thieves get near you.
[51:27.600 --> 51:30.920]  Push a button and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[51:30.920 --> 51:32.680]  Put a stop to identity theft.

[52:19.320 --> 52:24.320]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[52:24.320 --> 52:32.840]  80% of humanity is at hand, or the first time in history the elite's plan for world
[52:32.840 --> 52:34.720]  government is blown wide open.

[54:50.120 --> 54:53.720]  If you are a newsilversolution.com, one of our great, great sponsors, go check them

[55:00.240 --> 55:01.240]  right now.
[55:01.240 --> 55:04.880]  All right, folks, I really want to encourage all you info warriors out there to spread
[55:04.880 --> 55:09.360]  the trailers for Fall of the Republic and Invisible Empire around the world.
[55:09.360 --> 55:13.200]  Okay, I already know that somebody put my trailer in Portuguese, I'm seeing the same
[55:13.200 --> 55:15.520]  thing happening with Fall of the Republic.
[55:15.520 --> 55:19.640]  In order to compete with the mainline establishment, the people that can pay, you know, YouTube
[55:19.640 --> 55:25.320]  $100,000 to put their, uh, their ad on the front page for the day and it still doesn't
[55:25.320 --> 55:28.000]  go as viral overall as our stuff.
[55:28.000 --> 55:33.720]  Michael Moore, you're hearing us where we are knocking at the door of the biggest documentary
[55:33.720 --> 55:37.760]  filmmaker in history and no one covers it.
[55:37.760 --> 55:44.320]  No one wants to say that we're that important in the actual spectrum of politics in this
[55:44.320 --> 55:50.120]  country, of the worldwide reality, I mean, that's what no one wants to talk about.
[55:50.120 --> 55:55.080]  Nobody wants to talk about the influence of infowars.com, of Alex Jones, of the Obama
[55:55.080 --> 56:01.840]  deception, of martial law, of loose change, of all these pictures that are paradigm shifters
[56:01.840 --> 56:04.760]  that have reached millions and millions and millions of people.
[56:04.760 --> 56:10.240]  So please, please, please, I'm begging you out there, get the trailers.
[56:10.240 --> 56:13.960]  You know, we don't have to repost them a million times either.
[56:13.960 --> 56:18.520]  You find that the, the one that has the most views, pass that one along.
[56:18.520 --> 56:20.040]  That's the one we need to go viral.
[56:20.040 --> 56:23.360]  You see it, it's the numbers that they can't deny.
[56:23.360 --> 56:26.600]  It's the numbers that get the mainstream coverage.
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.960]  You know, that's why Obama went biggest because change the channel, put up in his account
[56:30.960 --> 56:36.080]  a one, one spot version, can you look at the all the other versions?
[56:36.080 --> 56:39.400]  Yeah, they have millions of hits, but it's one through 12 and they range between their
[56:39.400 --> 56:40.400]  numbers.
[56:40.400 --> 56:41.660]  You put it all up at once.
[56:41.660 --> 56:46.240]  People sit down and they watch it and their jaw is on the floor and then the mainstream
[56:46.240 --> 56:49.360]  media like the Wall Street Journal comes out here and they say, oh, we're going to do this
[56:49.360 --> 56:50.800]  big story on you.
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.080]  It doesn't bash us enough so they can't put it out.
[56:54.080 --> 56:56.320]  At least make them cover it.
[56:56.320 --> 57:00.080]  I mean, LA Times talked about the Obama deception.
[57:00.080 --> 57:01.200]  We can have an effect.
[57:01.200 --> 57:04.720]  So please listeners out there, help us out.
[57:04.720 --> 57:11.040]  Join prisonplanet.tv, post us on YouTube, spread the links, get a copy of the Obama
[57:11.040 --> 57:16.160]  deception, a hard copy, make copies, hand it out to friends, show it in your church
[57:16.160 --> 57:18.360]  and your local youth center.
[57:18.360 --> 57:22.040]  As an after school project, students out there, you can be very effective with things like
[57:22.040 --> 57:23.040]  this.
[57:23.040 --> 57:24.040]  Bring this into your teacher.
[57:24.040 --> 57:25.760]  You know, 9-Eleven's on its way.
[57:25.760 --> 57:31.920]  It's just around the corner, eight years after the biggest false flag event in history, many
[57:31.920 --> 57:35.040]  people still don't know what's going on, don't know the truth.
[57:35.040 --> 57:36.040]  Here it is.
[57:36.040 --> 57:37.460]  It's fabled enemies.
[57:37.460 --> 57:39.600]  It's available over at infowars.com.
[57:39.600 --> 57:43.360]  If you want to know the international intelligence organization that carried out 9-Eleven, you
[57:43.360 --> 57:46.640]  want to know about the cover up, you want to know about the anthrax attacks, you want
[57:46.640 --> 57:49.920]  to know what happened in World Trade Center Building 7.
[57:49.920 --> 57:54.600]  This is the definitive film, folks, and it's only available over at infowars.com.
[57:54.600 --> 58:00.480]  It supports what we do here because, quite frankly, it's very hard to do 20 hours.
[58:00.480 --> 58:07.120]  It's 20 plus hours of material on a radio show, then do a two hour motion picture and
[58:07.120 --> 58:10.560]  then spy, I mean, he produces my next two hour motion picture.
[58:10.560 --> 58:11.560]  He does a Sunday show.
[58:11.560 --> 58:13.040]  I do a Sunday show.
[58:13.040 --> 58:19.160]  People can't imagine how much goes on here and how much effort is put in.
[58:19.160 --> 58:20.160]  So I hope you support us all.
[58:20.160 --> 58:24.600]  Remember, Alex is coming up right after this with Wayne Paul, Dr. LeBeau, General Stullbine,
[58:24.600 --> 58:25.600]  and Bob Cohen.
[58:25.600 --> 58:26.960]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in.
[58:26.960 --> 58:31.680]  Go check us out over at infowars.com, PrismPlanet.tv, and spread those trailers far and wide.
[58:31.680 --> 58:38.680]  Thank you all.
[58:38.680 --> 58:54.120]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[58:54.120 --> 58:58.480]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[58:58.480 --> 59:03.440]  do you want, my answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives
[59:03.440 --> 59:05.040]  of your loved ones.
[59:05.040 --> 59:06.520]  Food is your only ammunition.
[59:06.520 --> 59:10.920]  How much do you want, when do you want it, now or after the battle starts, when will
[59:10.920 --> 59:15.400]  you need it, can you buy it without proper identification, will there be any food, will
[59:15.400 --> 59:19.680]  it make your children sick, if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go
[59:19.680 --> 59:24.240]  to the gathering center and be immunized, you wipe out all these problems if you have
[59:24.240 --> 59:25.920]  a good food supply.
[59:25.920 --> 59:29.480]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[59:29.480 --> 59:31.600]  How much will you need, we don't know.
[59:31.600 --> 59:34.600]  How much do you want, all you can get, I'm Alex Jones.
[59:34.600 --> 59:42.400]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[59:42.400 --> 59:53.520]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[59:53.520 --> 1:00:05.480]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.480 --> 1:00:11.280]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers?
[1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:13.400]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:25.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:25.240 --> 1:00:29.760]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv in about seven and a half minutes with Wayne Paul,
[1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:30.760]  brother of Dr. Ron Paul.
[1:00:30.760 --> 1:00:35.760]  We're going to play a clip of him from the Obama Deception live at PrisonPlanet.tv in
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:39.880]  the audio over the radio, so that's coming up, stay with us, she'll be with us for five
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:44.040]  minutes in the next hour, then we're going to have Dr. Lebo and her husband, General
[1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:48.520]  Stubblebine on the show, talk about the whole eugenics agenda, but Wayne Paul is coming
[1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:50.520]  up, so stay with us.
[1:00:50.520 --> 1:00:54.280]  Right now, let's keep going to your calls, let's talk to Jason in Colorado, then Kay,
[1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:56.800]  Ronnie, Phillip, Ronnie and others.
[1:00:56.800 --> 1:01:01.240]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Jason.
[1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:06.120]  Hey, Alex, this is Jason calling from the beautiful, fed and festive state of Colorado.
[1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:13.120]  I just wanted to see if you actually had a chance to look at the WHO update for July
[1:01:13.120 --> 1:01:17.200]  16th regarding the swine flu and the reporting.
[1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:20.920]  Yeah, they say we're level six and they're getting ready for global forced inoculation
[1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:22.560]  of three shots.
[1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:26.560]  And here in Austin, they have the public already admitting, the newscast says it isn't even
[1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:30.440]  the right flu, but the public doesn't care and the kids are all lining up to get this
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:34.240]  special shot the government wants you to have, and of course it'll come out later that they're
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:38.320]  all going to be sterile or have brain jammers, but you know, folks don't know the government's
[1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:39.320]  killers.
[1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:41.400]  You really can't blame them being gullible.
[1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:44.560]  It's like your dog that trusts you, if you were to take it out of the backyard, it would
[1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:47.520]  trust you as you put a 45 to its head and blow its head off.
[1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:49.520]  They're just as trusting as a Labrador Retriever.
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:52.520]  Yeah, let me expand on that just for a second, Alex.
[1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:56.440]  What I'm referring to is that the World Health Organization had been coming out with daily
[1:01:56.440 --> 1:02:00.720]  updates every two to three days with the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:01.720]  in his country.
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:06.960]  Today they came out with a report that says that they are no longer requiring countries
[1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:12.000]  to submit regular reports of individual laboratory confirmed cases and deaths to the World Health
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  Organization.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Well, I mean, what is it?
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.200]  I mean, there's several different tracking systems.
[1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:17.200]  What is it?
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:22.240]  It's like 170 something, I checked last week on the World Health Organization.
[1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:24.560]  What are they saying it is right now?
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:25.560]  It was on July 6th.
[1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:30.520]  It was at right around 97,000, and it jumped 30% from the screen.
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:32.040]  I'm talking about deaths.
[1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:33.720]  No, they are not reporting it.
[1:02:33.720 --> 1:02:35.720]  They have not updated it since July 6th.
[1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:36.720]  That's what I'm telling you.
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:37.720]  That's what I'm telling you.
[1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:39.040]  I'm saying what is the number?
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:40.040]  You're not listening.
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:41.480]  I don't have it in front of me.
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:45.920]  What I'm asking you is what is the last number they're giving for deaths?
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:47.440]  I'd have to go into look at the...
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:49.240]  I think it's 170 something.
[1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:51.480]  I would check that last week, but the...
[1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:52.480]  Correct.
[1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:53.480]  Yes, because it's all hype.
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:54.480]  It's all a lie.
[1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:58.680]  It's all much ado about nothing, and the last two swine flu outbreaks broke out at US military
[1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:03.000]  bases, and this thing is...
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.440]  This is a giant sigh-off, and they're saying millions have it in the US, but yeah, you're
[1:03:08.440 --> 1:03:09.800]  carrying a no big deal virus.
[1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:13.640]  There's thousands of flu viruses out there, and so what do you think is going on with
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:14.640]  this?
[1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:15.640]  What do you think the bigger story is?
[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:18.960]  Well, I think the bigger story is that the World Health Organization is actually leading
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:24.520]  the charge on informing the public, not only in America, but across the globe, and then
[1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:28.160]  now saying that there are no longer going to be requiring countries to report confirmed
[1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:29.160]  cases, nor deaths.
[1:03:29.160 --> 1:03:34.000]  It sounds to me like they're going to stop actually just tracking it on the larger level
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.280]  so that we can stay uninformed.
[1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:43.160]  Again, if it does mutate or spread, or deaths start to increase in South America, which
[1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:49.040]  they are suspecting, or other countries, how are we ever going to be able to track that
[1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:51.160]  information if they are not reporting it?
[1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:55.480]  I'll write a blurb and send it to writersinfowars.com.
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:56.480]  Thank you so much, Jason.
[1:03:56.480 --> 1:04:00.280]  Yeah, I mean, I've been meaning to spend more time on this whole flu situation.
[1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:04.160]  As I said back when it first broke out, that they were already really at level five.
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:08.840]  They were going to go to level six within 96 hours, I believe the memo said.
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:09.840]  You can pull it up.
[1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:10.840]  It's on infowars.com.
[1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:13.840]  And then it came out that we were telling you the truth, and it was a real document.
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:19.040]  I got it from an official, I'll just say that, public servant Aaron Austin.
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:23.200]  And then months later, yeah, they said, oh, yeah, we've really been at level six, so
[1:04:23.200 --> 1:04:24.200]  that's going on.
[1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:28.040]  This is a giant hoax, or they could be doing the big one right now, because they've been
[1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:30.520]  gearing up for mass culling, mass death.
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:33.080]  This is one of their models.
[1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:37.040]  And now they're saying, oh, yeah, it's going to get real bad and could kill millions in
[1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:40.000]  the fall when it's no big deal.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.880]  Do they know what's going to mutate?
[1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:43.640]  Is something deadly?
[1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:46.760]  Usually mutates to something that's less harmful.
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:49.360]  Are they going to release something else that's similar?
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:53.680]  Is this their perfect cover for the collapsing economy in the fall and the global dictatorship
[1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:56.280]  being set up by the new bank of the world?
[1:04:56.280 --> 1:04:58.520]  They've certainly got it in their fist of cards.
[1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:00.400]  They certainly could play that card.
[1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:01.400]  Hello, friends.
[1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:04.320]  This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:06.720]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[1:05:06.720 --> 1:05:12.320]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[1:05:12.320 --> 1:05:15.320]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:19.440]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental
[1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:20.760]  system diseases.
[1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:22.640]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:27.400]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:29.160]  you and your family's drinking water.
[1:05:29.160 --> 1:05:33.880]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:39.280]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization
[1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:40.280]  techniques.
[1:05:40.280 --> 1:05:41.280]  That's right.
[1:05:41.280 --> 1:05:43.640]  Clean water right from the air you breathe.

[1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:05.120]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:06.120]  you to eat.
[1:06:06.120 --> 1:06:09.640]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[1:06:09.640 --> 1:06:12.600]  sick, go to the doctor, and buy their drugs?
[1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:14.280]  You don't have to cooperate.
[1:06:14.280 --> 1:06:15.600]  There is a solution.
[1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:19.160]  Your health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[1:06:19.160 --> 1:06:24.000]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:37.600]  manager.
[1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:42.320]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee, infused with herbal extracts to boost your

[1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:08.800]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, mighty film terror storm
[1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:09.800]  is complete.
[1:07:09.800 --> 1:07:13.520]  The shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating
[1:07:13.520 --> 1:07:18.680]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[1:07:18.680 --> 1:07:23.560]  Terror storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:25.800]  were carried out by British intelligence.
[1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:29.880]  Terror storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to
[1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:36.240]  disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and
[1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:37.480]  much much more.
[1:07:37.480 --> 1:07:41.320]  Terror storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:43.840]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:48.080]  Terror storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:30.440]  Well, we are locked and loaded and ready to go for the third hour of this transmission.
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:36.000]  It's already Thursday, the 16th of July, 2009.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:41.920]  And for this hour and five minutes into the next hour, we have Wayne Paul, CPA, and brother
[1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:47.080]  of Representative Dr. Ron Paul, and of course, Wayne appears in the Obama deception, discusses
[1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:51.160]  a social security scan of the Federal Reserve, how the country is bankrupt, and we are under
[1:08:51.160 --> 1:08:57.760]  emergency powers, and the security of the Treasury is really in control of the country,
[1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:00.520]  or how the Secretary of the Treasury is really in control of the country through the War
[1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:01.520]  Powers Act.
[1:09:01.520 --> 1:09:05.440]  In fact, let's play that scene of Wayne Paul in the Obama deception that we're going to
[1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:07.720]  go right to Wayne Paul.
[1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:08.720]  Here it is.
[1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:17.000]  In 1913, the Federal Reserve Act was passed for the House where three members of Congress
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  were on the floor.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:23.040]  At that time, they only needed a majority of votes to pass it.
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:32.760]  So in 1913, the Federal Reserve Act was passed, 20 years later, 1933, under Roosevelt, the
[1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:36.840]  United States was declared bankrupt.
[1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:44.160]  And in 1933, the Federal Reserve Private Bank says, okay, USA, what are you going to pledge
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:48.520]  as collateral on the debt you owe me?
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:50.640]  What happened by 1936?
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:52.640]  Does anybody know?
[1:09:52.640 --> 1:10:00.000]  We instituted social security system, and you and I and our children and our children's
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:06.360]  children were pledged as collateral on the debt of our government to the Federal Reserve.
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:07.960]  And that's where we're at today.
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:15.400]  It took 20 years to make this country bankrupt, and since then, our government has operated
[1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:20.840]  under emergency powers of our government.
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:26.200]  It is not the President that makes the decision in this country.
[1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:33.880]  It's the Secretary of Treasury who turns around and is put in there by the Federal Reserve
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:37.080]  to manage the bankruptcy.
[1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:39.640]  We've been in bankruptcy ever since.
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:44.640]  So to print $700 billion and give it away, how do they get away with it?
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:50.400]  The manager of the bankruptcy is told by the Federal Reserve, this is the way to go.
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:51.400]  As we're at today.
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:58.520]  Yes, we should point out, Congressman Ron Paul now has a huge amount of sponsors to
[1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:03.920]  bill in the House of Representatives to abolish the private Federal Reserve Bank.
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:04.920]  All right, here we go, folks.
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:09.320]  We're going to go ahead and go back now to our guest, Wayne Paul.
[1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:11.640]  Wayne, it's great to have you here with us today.
[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:14.640]  It's good to be on board.
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:16.640]  Where are you joining us from today?
[1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:20.720]  I'm in East Texas at my home today.
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:21.720]  Fantastic.
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:24.640]  Great to have you on with us.
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:32.160]  Wayne, there's so much to talk about, but let's begin with the issue you were just discussing,
[1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:37.240]  how this country was taken into receivership through fraud because these shysters, these
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:44.920]  rhinestone con artists, these flim flam artists, they create all this out of nothing and they
[1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:50.400]  basically buy up the world out of nothing and so they want to create a debt black hole,
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:55.440]  a system to bankrupt the planet to then bring in their new world order, their new bank of
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:11:59.840]  the world, which they admit we're going to be paying our carbon taxes to and you so eloquently
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:02.880]  broke that down, but can you further comment on that?
[1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:04.680]  Then we're going to go back to the beginning.
[1:12:04.680 --> 1:12:09.400]  I want to talk about you growing up with your brother outside Pittsburgh on a dairy farm
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:15.120]  and just what formed a great family like yours and then looking forward into some of the
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:17.200]  current things that are happening today.
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:23.160]  Well, I think the most fascinating thing is the bill that's on the floor of the house
[1:12:23.160 --> 1:12:27.560]  now as it relates to out of the bed.
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:34.960]  If somebody would have said to me five years ago that there would have been over 240 congressmen
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:42.040]  putting their name on the line to have the Federal Reserve Bank audit it, how to never
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:51.120]  believe it, that alone tells you and I and your listeners that the understanding of how
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:57.640]  the Federal Reserve Bank worked and what it does to turn around and confiscate our
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:05.960]  private property, it's an amazing feat and I think that's something that will be changing
[1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:11.160]  the world if we can get that accomplished.
[1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:12.160]  Absolutely.
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:16.000]  I love it when your brother's on television and they say abolish the Federal Reserve,
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.160]  get rid of the income tax.
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:24.360]  How are we going to do that when we have to fund the government and Ron Paul always says
[1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:29.720]  this building behind me, the capital, was built for 100 plus years before we had this
[1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:32.360]  foreign banking takeover.
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:37.520]  Can you get into the nature of the Federal Reserve, the War Powers Act, go back through
[1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:42.960]  what you talked about in that video clip but in more detail, the nature of our rulers and
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:47.280]  it is amazing that five, ten years ago almost no one knew it was a private run for profit
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:48.280]  criminal group.
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:52.560]  Now, it's a big national issue that nobody can audit it, that it says it's above the
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:57.240]  law, it won't tell Congress, Senator Sanders and others and your brother, the Congressman
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:14:01.080]  Ron Paul say, where's the money, where did it go and Bernanke says, I'm not going to
[1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:06.000]  tell you, everybody even if they're dumbed down, knows fundamentally nobody's above
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:10.160]  the law and they're asking, who are these private bankers that own everything and control
[1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:12.040]  the issuance, the currency and credit.
[1:14:12.040 --> 1:14:18.120]  So I break down kind of the history of this group for us and then more on what is it like
[1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:24.720]  for you fighting them for decades, to now see it really, really starting to be on the
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:29.520]  run bleeding, I mean, it's a cornered rat.
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:34.720]  I think the fascinating thing about that is if you go to the Federal Reserve Act that
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:44.080]  was passed in 1913, in that act and in the bill, if anybody's interested, go on the web
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:51.120]  under government and read that act and they define that the green stuff we have in our
[1:14:51.120 --> 1:15:00.240]  pocket, it is defined as a Federal Reserve Accounting Unit Dollar.
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:09.720]  Take the first letter of each one of those words and what do you have, Federal Reserve
[1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:22.800]  Accounting Unit Dollar, they told us in 1913 what they were doing because those five letters
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:24.800]  spell fraud.
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:32.960]  So when you hear the vernacular that says fraud notes in your pocket, you understand
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:44.000]  where people got that thing and that having been created then, we're now at a point where
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:55.880]  printing dollars no longer can be sustained by the productivity of free enterprise, there
[1:15:55.880 --> 1:16:00.040]  is just too many dollars in circulation.
[1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:08.280]  And I think as you say, uneducated or people that don't have the research done or haven't
[1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:15.280]  done their research understand when they go to the store and go to buy a loaf of bread
[1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:22.440]  and it's now $2.50 and I used to buy a loaf of bread for $29 and something's wrong with
[1:16:22.440 --> 1:16:23.440]  somewhere.
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:33.320]  Well, it absolutely is and now they're going to a whole new unit of a global SDR where
[1:16:33.320 --> 1:16:38.280]  the central banks don't even have it backed up by the nation states or by the people paying
[1:16:38.280 --> 1:16:41.240]  the income tax into the private Federal Reserve.
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:48.160]  Now it's just SDRs that are above even the nation state currency so we're already going
[1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:53.160]  to this global cashless society right now, it's just a mopping up process to get rid
[1:16:53.160 --> 1:16:58.040]  of the national currencies or to convert them into, you may still be able to pay with cash
[1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:02.920]  but there will be a thumb print or a face scan at the time of sale fully bringing us
[1:17:02.920 --> 1:17:07.880]  into their control and then economically they can outlaw any underground economy and then
[1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:12.000]  socially engineer us and squeeze us and really get the control they want.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:16.520]  But getting more into the fact that we are starting to draw blood on these people, we
[1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:22.600]  are in the fight, we have shaken them, we have rung their bell in this boxing match,
[1:17:22.600 --> 1:17:26.160]  you've made them see Twee Bird as they say and now the public is figuring out they're
[1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:30.640]  not invincible, they're not on Mount Olympus above us, what is that like for you after
[1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:33.600]  decades of fighting these people to see that starting to happen?
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:40.800]  Well, I think the exciting thing for me is the fact that even though I've known this
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:49.280]  and studied it for 25 years, I think I'm reminded most of all in this past year of a young gentleman
[1:17:49.280 --> 1:18:00.120]  in our area who is a senior in high school and for his passage of his senior year he
[1:18:00.120 --> 1:18:08.360]  had a regular senior thesis and he studied and wrote his thesis on the Federal Reserve
[1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:18.000]  system and how it operated and for me a young person aged 17 having the knowledge that this
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:26.600]  fellow has as to how it operates got to be the most exciting thing I look forward to
[1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:35.520]  the future only because I think as Congressman Paul pointed out it's the education process
[1:18:35.520 --> 1:18:42.440]  that really counts and when we can see that in our young people I can see light at the
[1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:49.600]  end of the tunnel that we're going to turn around and we're going to create a constitutional
[1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:57.760]  republic form of government and it's going to take all of us starting from the local
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:04.120]  city offices to the county to the state to the federal but it will change because of
[1:19:04.120 --> 1:19:05.120]  knowledge.
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:11.160]  And when we win we're going to have a second renaissance in this country and appreciate
[1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:14.880]  it because you don't really appreciate something that you've had to fight for it or until you've
[1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:18.640]  lost it and then fought for it and gotten it back.
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.520]  I can agree with you more.
[1:19:20.520 --> 1:19:29.080]  I am looking forward to that day and I intend to be here when that day happens.
[1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:33.760]  Well so many times in history tyrants and tyrannies collapse I think Gandhi to paraphrase
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:37.760]  him said it looks like the dictator the corrupt leaders are invincible but then suddenly they
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:43.000]  just collapse you got to just keep throwing the punches in there and not giving up knowing
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:47.160]  we're going to bring it that's like George Washington when he finally won the war and
[1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:52.320]  they surrendered he was stunned for several hours and didn't believe him didn't understand
[1:19:52.320 --> 1:19:55.560]  after seven years of fighting.

[1:24:52.880 --> 1:24:58.280]  and where this country is going and his brother in the family and now one of his nephews ran
[1:24:58.280 --> 1:25:05.480]  poll that looks like is going to run for the congress but go back to your rural upbringing
[1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:11.560]  you know stories about you and your brothers about about ron and about what it's been
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:18.520]  like for you how you woke up how he woke up or are you guys born awake being born to
[1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:23.320]  you know hard working farmers dairy farmers you know all you guys working from the time
[1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:27.440]  you're about you know six seven years old were you guys born awake or what was the
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:34.320]  process like let us into a window of the icon that is your brother dr ron paul and yourself
[1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:42.040]  of course okay we were born and raised in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania small old town and
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:49.360]  my mother and father had a dairy milk processing and delivery business it started out in the
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:55.880]  basement of our house and my mom and dad worked seven days a week to process bottled milk
[1:25:55.880 --> 1:26:04.160]  and deliver it and we were always required on Sunday to go to church Sunday morning and
[1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:10.600]  my dad took off enough time to go to church but he worked seven days a week up until
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:18.480]  I was in fifth grade now I'm the youngest of five boys ron is the middle of the five
[1:26:18.480 --> 1:26:25.400]  of us that we claim he's the spoiled one in the family because the two oldest ones paid
[1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:31.000]  the way for him and then we were never allowed to do anything but we always say ron got away
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:40.600]  with all of it I'm saying that because he can't reput that on this radio so be careful
[1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:50.880]  I might deny that later on anyway my revelation into this knowledge started back in the early
[1:26:50.880 --> 1:27:02.040]  seventies and it had to do with my representation of a taxpayer who after I started to represent
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:13.240]  him he ended up six weeks after I met him passing away and it was a direct result of
[1:27:13.240 --> 1:27:22.560]  the confrontation he had with the internal revenue service and I said to myself if this
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:29.200]  is the way it is I'm not going to ever do another tax return because something's not
[1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:40.600]  right in the system so that was my awakening call and that started my research my documentation
[1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:48.240]  and everything that I've learned from that point on has helped me and better said made
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:55.800]  me better understand and I think when people understand and learn even if they can't do
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:28:02.320]  anything about it they're better off morally they're better off spiritually and they're
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:07.960]  better off in your dealings with their fellow man that makes all the difference in the world
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:15.920]  what's up what woke your brother up tell us about uh... congressman ron paul your brother
[1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:24.680]  well i think ron timing with the fact that when he was in college and medical school
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:35.080]  and working he always had a fair time and he got involved in research and study of
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:44.880]  republic brennesey and brennesey is the father of free enterprise austrian economics and
[1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:50.440]  there's a brennesey's institute that's in existence today that's extremely successful
[1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:57.640]  and continues to support free enterprise economics and it's headed up by lou rockwell that is
[1:28:57.640 --> 1:29:07.400]  correct and it made a lot of sense to him so he started to apply it not only in his
[1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:17.360]  professional life but in his personal life and was extremely successful in the implementation
[1:29:17.360 --> 1:29:23.640]  of free enterprise economics and it was at that time that he started to formulate the
[1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:29.800]  idea that he needed to speak to other people all right stay there let's continue with this
[1:29:29.800 --> 1:29:34.480]  on the other side and also talk about your saga you've had quite a story as well and

[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:07.320]  from our long-time sponsor solution from science in an emergency power backup kit which consists
[1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:12.560]  of the power source eighteen hundred watt generator and a high efficiency solar panel
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:17.840]  designed to provide endless electricity remember to that gas generators need gas but in a blackout
[1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:22.480]  gas pumps can't pump gas because they run electricity it's the perfect emergency backup

[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:38.240]  brother finishing up with your upbringing so your brother gets into the free market economics
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:44.560]  he's a doctor then i guess you're getting involved with very goldwater somehow tell
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:52.800]  us more about the inside scoop on your brother well i think his total goal and effort when
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:36:00.800]  he first decided to run for congress was to educate people in understanding free enterprise
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:09.440]  economics and he said to carol his wife the first time he ran he said uh don't worry carol
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:15.600]  i'm not going to win i just want to get the message out well the first time he didn't win
[1:36:16.320 --> 1:36:23.360]  but he says what are you going to do if you do win well the next time he ran he won now
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:35.760]  when he first ran for congress back in the mid 70s he had a platform one page platform he was
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:45.840]  running on and it just so happens that my wife gave him his first contribution and he sent her a
[1:36:45.840 --> 1:36:53.040]  thank you note and the second page was his platform of what he was running on which was
[1:36:53.040 --> 1:37:02.640]  basically free enterprise economics but if you were to read that single page today you would think
[1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:09.760]  he wrote it yesterday because he's never changed and i think that's the most consistent thing
[1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:17.840]  that anybody can ever say as far as my brother is concerned is he's never wavered
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:28.000]  from the truth and from the facts and from the constitution and he has just been amazing
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:34.400]  and instead passed on that and i think people today now realize that and you judge a tree by
[1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:43.520]  its fruits do you remember any of the things on that one page platform well i can't remember
[1:37:43.520 --> 1:37:51.200]  right off except uh if while i'm talking we'll find it maybe my wife sure sure sure coming up
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:56.800]  after the next break if you can it's just very very interesting history here uh no and as your
[1:37:56.800 --> 1:38:03.760]  brother has humbly and rightfully said he is just an articulate genteel intelligent focal point and
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:10.400]  two years ago well now a year and a half ago at Bilderberg our inside sources have
[1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:14.000]  been proven to be very very accurate said that they were worried not about ron paul winning
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:20.320]  during that campaign but that they were worried about the movement that the biggest movement now
[1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:24.400]  in high schools and universities wasn't the controlled left paradigm or the controlled
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:28.960]  right paradigm of the collectivist but the people were now rediscovering the bill of rights
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:34.560]  constitution and becoming free market constitutionalist and the people were discovering the private
[1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:38.960]  fellow reserve and i think they had well founded fears now here we are a year and a half later
[1:38:39.680 --> 1:38:44.720]  and we've gone from almost and i know i keep repeating this no one knowing the fed was private
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:49.120]  being laughed at to now the enemies had to come out in the open and go okay we're private but we
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:53.760]  run things for your own good and if you audit us we'll cause a depression basically terrorism
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:39:01.280]  economic terrorism and we have open announcements of a new bank of the world will pay our carbon
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:05.920]  taxes to and now for world government and hundreds and hundreds of articles a month
[1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:11.600]  pushing this on us and nobody's buying it all the things we talked about have come true and are
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:15.360]  happening we're now at this key battle point in history that your brother talked about that i
[1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:20.720]  talked about that when the crisis came when the bankers were imploding the world economy by design
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:26.320]  to bring in their system that was a weak point for them their great moment of triumph but also
[1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:32.560]  their weak point if we point out hey the emperors butt naked this is a fraud the emperors new clothes
[1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:37.680]  and now to really see it's so viral this idea of liberty
[1:39:40.640 --> 1:39:45.440]  i mean this shows us we can have victory this gives us hope it shows people that had kind
[1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:52.000]  of given up who had been fighting for decades like yourself not saying you ever did that that
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  none of this was done for not that the seeds we planted that a lot of people ignored are now
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:03.120]  sprouting in the minds of any woman everywhere can you speak to just the amazing revolution of
[1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:09.600]  liberty and freedom we're seeing well i'm have a book sitting in front of me that i continually
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:18.480]  read tomorrow and reread it's called the history of our national debt the coming battle it's written
[1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:28.720]  by uh lorraine and paul wolters and if somebody really wants to understand where we're at if they
[1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:35.360]  read this history it'll happen didn't they republish that from an 1898 book and they wrote the forward
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:44.000]  that is correct that's an excellent book it is it and it is so uh enlightening that it's worth
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:50.720]  the read by anybody interested in it i keep reading it because i learned something new every
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:54.240]  time and for those that don't know this was a guy going for i read it 10 years ago when he
[1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:59.760]  republished it in banking who saw all this coming and said we're being taken over by bankers
[1:40:59.760 --> 1:41:09.120]  uh 15 years before they did it yeah that's correct uh it runs letter to my wife he says
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:15.600]  i want to cut spending cut taxes cut inflation
[1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:25.440]  when i have honest money i want to cut crime i want to let people live in peace and security
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:33.680]  and i want to get rid of government controls and regulations and that was basically one sheet
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:42.000]  of paper that he wrote back in 19 i believe it's 74 was the first time he ran and his motto at that
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:52.480]  time was to say put big government on a diet and that was that was one of the first uh
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:59.920]  uh advertisement that he put out in mid 70 out of it speaking to your brother let me
[1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:05.840]  ask your question wane paul i challenged him about two months before he announced for president
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:10.480]  privately on the phone when he was on as a guest during the break i said please run you got to do
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:16.320]  it just to educate the public you morally cannot say no i know you don't want to fly around and do
[1:42:16.320 --> 1:42:20.400]  the thousands of speeches i know you already have an exhausting schedule i know you're a real statesman
[1:42:20.400 --> 1:42:25.360]  but i said you must run for president and i said and i said i know you're going to get
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:29.120]  attacked if you don't win later but i said regardless you'll educate a lot of people
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:33.920]  and out of that big awakening even bigger awakenings will happen and he said no no that's what a lot
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:40.800]  of other people are telling me family and others and he said uh we'll see soon and so many other
[1:42:40.800 --> 1:42:46.960]  people were talking to him behind the scenes this is history can you tell us what was going on what
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:54.000]  the debates were what the thoughts were on him running for president well i think it all boils down
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:09.440]  to whether the people were ready to hear hear the message in such a large uh arena as running for
[1:43:09.440 --> 1:43:20.400]  president and i think he became amazed at the crowd the numbers of people the contributions he
[1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:27.280]  received the effort that was put forth by people all over the country the number of young people
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:35.840]  they came on supported him uh it it actually i think blew him away and made him a very humble
[1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:45.600]  individual because he never expected it to be as big as it really was so i think he was
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:55.200]  humbled by it i think he was in awe by it and i think every hour of every moment of every time
[1:43:55.200 --> 1:44:03.600]  he spent doing that he is absolutely delighted to have done it and i think it continues today with
[1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:10.480]  his campaign for liberty program that he's working on now wane uh i want to talk more about the whole
[1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:15.840]  global picture with you and take some calls but some funny or interesting stories about your
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:21.600]  brother or your family because people just will love to hear him uh that you've never told before
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:28.480]  or that you had never told on the radio before yeah some interesting stuff about the young ron paul
[1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:36.480]  well i think one of the most interesting things that i think of is he used to work in the drug
[1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:45.760]  store so we called him the soda soda jerk of the day and he would use the bicycle to go a mile work
[1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:53.840]  and then come home and he always worked late in the evening up till 10 o'clock to close the store
[1:44:53.840 --> 1:45:03.040]  and then bike home well he always had a ritual in his own mind as to how quickly he could get
[1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:11.040]  home till he was always timing himself but one evening he was coming home and going up
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:18.160]  here when he was pumping so hard and so fast they forgot to look in front of him and he ran into a
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:28.960]  parked car and that parked car demolished the front of his bike but he picked up the bike
[1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:34.720]  and walked the other half mile to get home and when he got home his collarbone was sticking
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:44.160]  outside of his shirt but that's just the type of person he was and and he wanted to make sure nobody
[1:45:44.160 --> 1:45:51.840]  took his bike so he dragged it home with him but that's just that's just the way he is and most of
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:46:00.880]  the five of us are fairly competitive my oldest brother has his phd in mathematics the next brother
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:09.200]  is the doctor of divinity and of course ron has three different degrees in medicine my next brother
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:16.880]  has a doctor of divinity also so i have a big brother who's a Luther minister and one that's a
[1:46:16.880 --> 1:46:22.960]  Presbyterian minister good quality good quality salt of the earth and you're a cpa right that's
[1:46:22.960 --> 1:46:28.000]  correct they wanted me to be an undertaker so that they could take care of everybody bring him
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:34.080]  into the world raise them to educate him and i could bury him so we decided that if i did that
[1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:44.240]  i wouldn't have a monopoly on life in a government would let me do it just amazing stories hearing
[1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:52.640]  that um some of the family background it is the family on both sides german or uh where
[1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:58.960]  do the polls come from well my grandfather came to this country that's 12 year old from germany
[1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:08.400]  and came after his father came here before him uh my mother it was french irish from all
[1:47:08.400 --> 1:47:18.320]  these florens uh but i think it was the close knit family and our christian tides that uh
[1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:27.760]  really was a a bulwark of our life yet one of the other interesting things about my brother and
[1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:34.400]  he still has it when he first went to congress he bought a little shabby chivette to go from
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:43.760]  his apartment to congress every day and that chivette was two doors green he still has it by
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:53.520]  the way but there's pictures out of that chivette next to hippo kneels uh limousine and he obviously
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:59.200]  was proud of showing that in his congressional office or at home so it was the interesting
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:06.000]  contrast between a very liberal individual spending your money in a very conservative
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:11.920]  just trying to represent you absolutely i want to take calls in the next segment but but shifting
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:17.920]  here's the big picture eugenics i know you study banking the federal reserve but but the overall
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:22.880]  plans of the global issue you told me you've seen the obama deception that you're in
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:28.240]  giving your view on eugenics the master plan the type of people that are the collectivists
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:34.400]  and the type of societies they build you know really is an illustration of what the price is
[1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:40.720]  to pay if we that aren't parasites don't get things under control we leave the world of these people
[1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:53.200]  yes and that's difficult to really discuss and talk about because it's in an area that you know
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:49:00.800]  i look at my life and our family's life and as long as we stay the course and understand
[1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:09.200]  our responsibility we believe that those types of things will get settled by a much higher power
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:16.640]  than us and that it is just something that at this stage of our life that we have to talk about
[1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:22.560]  learn about and try to understand but it's difficult to determine how we might fight it
[1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:31.120]  it's just uh it's just incredible to really see the neural order come out in the open and
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:36.480]  un-cloak itself but it's even more incredible see the people rise against it it's just so exciting
[1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:44.400]  oh i do i think we live in the most exciting times of our life and i just i'm looking forward to it
[1:49:45.520 --> 1:49:50.240]  we're gonna come back and take two quick segments of phone calls for wane paul and we'll give out
[1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:54.880]  any websites or any contact info or any books you think we should read you know from your
[1:49:54.880 --> 1:50:00.400]  perspective but i did want to bring up a little side issue of the attacks on your brother and the
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:05.200]  video is finally out of it i think he did very well getting past the guy and getting out of there
[1:50:05.200 --> 1:50:12.000]  i'm uh but uh what do you think of that horrible Sasha Cohen baron uh trying to set up your brother
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:19.520]  of course it blew up in his face or are you even aware of that well i am vaguely aware of it and
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:29.680]  saw a little bit of it but i often sit back and admire my brother because he he believes as long
[1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:38.080]  as you're telling the truth and as long as you're putting forth the right effort those types of
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:43.920]  attacks won't last very long i kind of like seeing him get mad though for those that don't know we
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:47.520]  haven't played it because we're not been given an attention i might though i mean as the video is
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:52.480]  out now ron paul almost pops him and it looks like shoves him he's like get out of here it's kind
[1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:58.240]  of like you tell a cow to get out in the middle of the road uh just just just incredible but the
[1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:04.400]  media trying to demonize him for that studies have shown that many people do not get the proper
[1:51:04.400 --> 1:51:09.120]  vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health with so many places to choose from

[1:54:22.400 --> 1:54:27.760]  scams they run their days are numbered the momentum is shifted against them and they know their
[1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:36.640]  destruction their defeat is inevitable let's take a few final calls here for wane paul let's talk to
[1:54:36.640 --> 1:54:41.840]  ronnie in texas steve jk philip and others ronnie you're on the air with wane paul go ahead thank
[1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:46.880]  you thank you sir wane paul um i'm your number four for me i'm so honored to speak to you
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:52.720]  uh i spoke with obviously dr paul and carol and his other brother randy and rand and you but i have
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:58.080]  a question for you and a couple comments but one of photos that i saw while i was campaigning in
[1:54:58.080 --> 1:55:04.720]  iowa for dr paul was of dr paul in a baseball uniform and i wasn't sure if he either played
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:11.600]  pro baseball or just in college do you well that was the congressional baseball game
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:19.520]  that the congress took on i think it was the washington senator and ron got the astros
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:24.640]  to send him a uniform and oddly enough in that ballgame run hit a home run
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:30.080]  did that well thank you you know as you know he's a founding father among us now and i'm so
[1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:36.720]  on the force is with him yeah and my question though my major question though is like you sir
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:42.160]  uh i know he is not in favor of or i'm assuming like you said he's not in favor of generally
[1:55:42.160 --> 1:55:48.160]  people doing drugs but dr paul is more vehemently opposed to our own continually counterproductive
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:55.280]  war on pot smokers and hemp enthusiasts so equating alcohol with phc is a lie and alcohol is
[1:55:55.280 --> 1:56:01.680]  you know with the fetal alcohol syndrome etc it's a toxic poison and phc is non-toxic medicine
[1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:06.880]  so i'm okay listen i appreciate your call uh yeah your comments on drug decriminalization
[1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:12.720]  non-legalization like soros wants decriminalization so that we don't spend all our time and energy
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:19.440]  locking up people that need treatment and i agree with that i think ron's believe in my
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:28.400]  belief are very similar in that but that is a moral issue that is a personal choice of people
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:36.960]  it doesn't mean that we condone it it only means that we should help that individual
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:44.240]  so that those things do not become addictive and they do not start to control their life
[1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:51.360]  well and that's the issue look areas of europe have decriminalized heroin and in some areas
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:55.920]  it's cut it by half everywhere it's gone down at least by 25 percent people can pull those numbers
[1:56:55.920 --> 1:57:00.800]  up uh different numbers per country different cities but it's all a massive decrease and
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:05.120]  people stop robbing your house for your stereo and computer because the stuff is super cheap
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:11.120]  and it's from a kind of government or city dispensary and probably 80 percent of those
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:18.320]  people behind bars in prisons would not be there if it wasn't for that well plus they admit our
[1:57:18.320 --> 1:57:23.280]  troops guard the poppy fields in afghanistan and it's up nine times i mean there's their ship in
[1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:29.360]  an end i mean of course the elites do that we're talking about hundreds of billions a year of secret
[1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:33.920]  money they get to fractionally reserve loan out let's take one more call here right in this hour

[2:00:54.080 --> 2:01:04.000]  um cat is out of the bag that a lot of that is uh hoped i think if if we learned anything from it
[2:01:04.800 --> 2:01:11.680]  we should be more aware of our environment and take better care of it but i don't i think
[2:01:12.640 --> 2:01:19.600]  global warming is is coming gone over the last 200 years that i don't think there's anything
[2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:24.640]  different today than it was when we settled this country well i agree with you and and and they
[2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:30.000]  piggyback legitimate environmental issues that could be handled civilly you you do some toxic
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:34.640]  waste up and on somebody they can take you to you know to the cleaners or get you put in prison

[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:41.680]  when it's clear in the word of god that this is going to happen
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:48.080]  yeah it was clear in 70 ad they thought it was the end of the world and when uh jerusalem was
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:51.680]  sacked they thought it was the end of the world when hitler was killing people uh you've had all
[2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:58.960]  these different empires how do you reconcile the word of god that uh it's our job to fire evil
[2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:05.680]  whatever the cost may be you know it's it's it's it's not to us to choose it's us to do the right
[2:03:05.680 --> 2:03:11.040]  thing uh you know duty is ours consequence belongs to god i mean is that what you're saying

[2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:08.560]  according to god's word and god's going to take care of the rest of the thing so i'm not going to
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:16.480]  worry about it i still have to fight the battle that the federal reserve system is an evil system
[2:04:16.480 --> 2:04:23.680]  and need to be abolished it doesn't change yeah it was the pastors that led the revolutionary war

[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:45.600]  at every level at his retirement he served as vp for intelligence systems with bdm a major defense
[2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:52.080]  contractor he's also taken the set of experiences and become involved in um leading edge medical
[2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:58.720]  research and development collaboration with his wife rima e lebo md he's a long term uh way out of
[2:09:58.720 --> 2:10:04.800]  the box thinker who uh redesign the u.s army's intelligence architecture while serving as the
[2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:08.720]  commanding general of the u.s army intelligence school and center and helped to define the
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:14.320]  requirements of the u.s army to future conflict and redesign and earned his place in the intelligence
[2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:19.280]  hall of fame many of the innovations he developed helped us conduct the first gulf war effectively
[2:10:19.280 --> 2:10:23.920]  and swiftly with a very low casualty rate he also commanded the u.s army electronic research
[2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:30.000]  and development command and the u.s army's intelligence and security command and it just
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:37.760]  goes on and on so uh i guess general then you'd be a major general when you retired that is correct
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:42.000]  okay we're going to go to you in a second sir we appreciate you joining us on the interview
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:48.320]  today let's go to your wife the medical doctor first uh in light of give us your perspective
[2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:53.360]  and then i want to get the general's perspective on the mass eugenics plan we have right of self
[2:10:53.360 --> 2:11:00.240]  defense this is a government level phd textbook for government leaders for policy i've now read
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:06.000]  over 400 pages of the 1100 total nightmare doctor this is exactly what you've been saying for decades
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:11.600]  break down what this new development means then we'll get the general's take and then we'll expand
[2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:18.880]  out into what this flu vaccination means i'm happy to do that alex and i want to know i want you to
[2:11:18.880 --> 2:11:25.120]  know that both the general and i are happy and privileged to have the opportunity to talk to
[2:11:25.120 --> 2:11:30.560]  you and your listeners about this this is a critical time and the first thing i want to do is start
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:40.160]  at the very end the very end is unless you listeners take action now you will be faced with
[2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:51.680]  involuntary detention or mandatory vaccination with an attenuated live virus vaccine containing
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:12:00.080]  deadly adjuvant the same thing that caused gulf war syndrome in 700 000 soldiers and you will have
[2:12:01.280 --> 2:12:07.200]  no recourse no legal recourse and you will have no financial recourse because vaccine makers are
[2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:12.560]  protected by the fraud and death administration and by the spineless worthless congress of the
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:18.240]  united states and if you'd like later alex i'll tell you how i feel about the congress anyway the
[2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:28.720]  point is that you have a moment now if you go to our website which is healthfreedomusa.org
[2:12:28.720 --> 2:12:38.720]  healthfreedomusa.org and you click on the top action item under act now you will be telling
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:45.120]  congress your state legislators the head of health and human services the health of homeland security
[2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:52.640]  and the white house that you want the right to refuse vaccines refuse incarceration and instead
[2:12:52.640 --> 2:13:01.520]  retire to your home for the um the quarantine period and self shield now the best friend that
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:08.720]  health freedom has in the united states congress is willing to take this onto the floor and create
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:17.120]  a bill and introduce the bill if there is enough support from all of us so if ever you valued your
[2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:23.040]  freedom if ever you valued your right to make your own health decisions and if ever you distrust
[2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:32.080]  its commitment now is the time go to healthfreedomusa.org and click on the top action item because if
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:39.840]  you don't you will be either mandatorily vaccinated or you will be incarcerated and now to answer your
[2:13:39.840 --> 2:13:47.680]  question alex because that's the bottom line the answer is yes the vaccine of this uh against this
[2:13:47.680 --> 2:13:56.720]  genetically engineered weaponized h1 n1 virus which we are now being told golly gee willikers
[2:13:56.720 --> 2:14:03.840]  this resembles the 1918 swine flu pandemic virus well yes of course it does because the genes were
[2:14:03.840 --> 2:14:10.960]  introduced intentionally into this new virus when they fizzled after being introduced into the avian
[2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:19.920]  flu virus so now the vaccine will be a deadly quote remedy to get rid of a large number of us
[2:14:19.920 --> 2:14:25.520]  and we're going if we're if we're sheeple we're going to line up roll up our sleeves present our
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:32.720]  children for vaccination the way 40 million americans did in 10 weeks during the the swine flu
[2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:42.000]  debacle in um 1976 only this time they won't stop it after 10 weeks because the intention we
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:49.920]  firmly believe based on holders uh document and on other information that we've been amassing for
[2:14:49.920 --> 2:14:54.720]  years and and we've been talking about you and and the general and i have had the chance to talk
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:14:59.760]  about it on this show and on others and we've been writing about it for years that you have
[2:14:59.760 --> 2:15:08.240]  this time the intention is to get rid of us profitably the amount of money that is being
[2:15:08.240 --> 2:15:17.920]  poured into the coffers of the world pharmaceutical companies is absolutely unholy as is the intent
[2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:23.360]  in fact today the world health organization put out i'm sorry yesterday world health
[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:31.280]  organization put out a press release saying that what we need for this and the coming pandemic
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:39.760]  because remember alex this vaccine is not the last pandemic vaccine it's the first of many many
[2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:46.560]  many many horrors to come until they've gotten rid of all of us this is what's needed we need
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:52.000]  many new vaccines we need new patents we need new drugs because if you look how they ramp it up
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:57.040]  they're they admittedly are testing global level six with all the major nation states under the
[2:15:57.040 --> 2:16:02.000]  direction of the world health organization this global directorate and so it's kind of like a
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:07.600]  jim jones kool-aid drinking drill where they drill following orders and taking the poison and they
[2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:11.440]  admit well i mean i mean you've looked at this doctrine i'm like a general stubble binds take
[2:16:11.440 --> 2:16:18.480]  on it what is the history of these companies we know that uh baxter i just put it on screen london
[2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:25.680]  telegraph uh baxter mixing the live bird flu in 18 countries secretly then suddenly they
[2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:30.560]  have secret trials lying to homeless but they won't say it's bachelors did the trials and the
[2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:36.400]  homeless are dying in mass actually i believe the trials were done by novartist and i believe
[2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:43.840]  that they were in conjunction with synovia ventis the good people who manufactured a an avian flu
[2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:49.600]  vaccine which the united states bought a hundred million doses of in their first order totally
[2:16:49.600 --> 2:16:55.600]  untested untried but approved by the uh bs the thing they're on our news here in austin saying
[2:16:55.600 --> 2:17:00.720]  everybody's got to take the shot get ready they're on the news saying it will be mandatory coming up
[2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:05.920]  in the fall it will be a pandemic it will be mass death and then people are lining up and
[2:17:05.920 --> 2:17:10.640]  they're saying oh we don't even know if this is the right thing and just taking the shot what do
[2:17:10.640 --> 2:17:16.640]  we know from past operations dr lebo and then general stubblebine about what they're putting
[2:17:16.640 --> 2:17:24.560]  in these vaccines well they're putting adjuvant adjuvants are um uh substances and the ones
[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:30.560]  that they're that we're most familiar with are the ones based on squalene which is a fat ordinarily
[2:17:30.560 --> 2:17:35.840]  found in the nervous system now when you eat squalene or you rub it on your skin and it's
[2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:42.640]  used in a lot of cosmetics it doesn't do anything bad to you but if you inject it it trains the
[2:17:42.640 --> 2:17:49.840]  immune system's white cells to attack it because it's a foreign uh object in your bloodstream at
[2:17:49.840 --> 2:17:55.840]  that point and the immune system is only doing its job it turns on the immune system and the
[2:17:55.840 --> 2:18:02.240]  immune system attack forces can never be turned off again so they start attacking everything
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:07.840]  that looks biochemically like squalene and then this according to other doctors we've had on
[2:18:07.840 --> 2:18:12.720]  accelerates the allergies the sicknesses the cancers and then makes your immune system go
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:18.080]  hey why don't talk about that more we're about to go to break but but general stubblebine you were
[2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:22.720]  just on six seven months ago before this whole flu thing came up and you guys were talking about
[2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:30.000]  when they try to launch a pandemic don't take the shot what does this look like to you well it's
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:37.600]  very clear you know what dr. reman i've been doing uh how it's been uh watching very carefully
[2:18:38.480 --> 2:18:45.120]  a whole lot of information and i call them dots uh they're tidbits of information but it's part of
[2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:51.120]  the way i have been trained from the intelligence world or in the intelligence world of how you put
[2:18:51.120 --> 2:18:57.600]  the picture together and you what you do is you take little bits of information uh for instance
[2:18:57.600 --> 2:19:05.200]  11 people died him instantaneously in a trial in poland and then 22 more died later uh from the
[2:19:05.200 --> 2:19:12.400]  same vaccine that you're about to take and uh then you uh take the information about uh baxter
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:20.080]  which uh contaminated the uh the vaccines for uh 22 different countries in uh 18 different
[2:19:20.080 --> 2:19:26.400]  countries in in europe you put all of these various dots together like that and what you
[2:19:26.400 --> 2:19:33.760]  end up with is a picture suddenly the picture flies into your face and you say holy smokes now
[2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:39.520]  i take this to the people who are called operational folks because they're the people that do the
[2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:47.200]  planning of what you do about it so the intelligence piece of all of this has been creating this
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:54.480]  enormous picture that you now have seen the documentation for stay there we gotta break

[2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:57.760]  of the vaccine the history of what they've done over and over again the fear mongering and so it's
[2:24:57.760 --> 2:25:04.400]  not the flu you worry about it's the shot continue that's correct absolutely correct and as you begin
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:11.840]  to get this picture suddenly uh pops into your face alex you suddenly say holy smokes you know
[2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:18.400]  i knew it was bad i did not know it was that bad now though it's time to take action because you
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:24.880]  now know and oh by the way the book that you've just gotten is your confirmation that everything
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:30.160]  that we've been saying for months and months and months and months is absolutely true and oh by the
[2:25:30.160 --> 2:25:34.720]  way during those months and months and months people were saying we're crazy we're not we're
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:40.560]  we work for big pharma and that we're cia agents yada yada yada yada the fact is they didn't want
[2:25:40.560 --> 2:25:47.120]  to hear what we were saying or they were on the other side ignore them the facts are the facts
[2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:52.080]  that you well doctor that's how cohen chelpro that's how cohen chelpro works is that they can't
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:56.400]  believe we have a ron paul they can't believe we have a general stubble mind they can't believe
[2:25:56.400 --> 2:26:02.480]  that there's good people from powerful positions that are stepping up and and and and that's what
[2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:07.760]  cohen chelpro does but regardless we're putting out the facts we're doing the best we can people
[2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:12.960]  can listen or they can go ahead and take the shots no but at this stage of the game they better
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:18.080]  god damn listen otherwise excuse my language but they better listen otherwise they're going to be
[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:25.600]  in trouble you have now seen for your for a fact i mean you've believed all along alex now you
[2:26:25.600 --> 2:26:31.760]  understand exactly because you've seen the document you've seen the blueprint for what all of this
[2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:38.960]  is about let me read to you the cdc assumptions that they're basing their targeting on okay
[2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:44.400]  they say one severity of illness is unchanged from that which has already been observed well
[2:26:44.400 --> 2:26:48.320]  they're also predicting i mean this is just nonsense they're also predicting that it's
[2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:54.800]  going to get a whole lot worse which is why after all we need the vaccination they they're saying for
[2:26:54.800 --> 2:26:59.120]  sure they know this but with regular flu they go a million americans have it like we're all going
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:04.240]  to die that just means we have the virus no big deal they're clearly engaged in lying and fair
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:12.720]  mongering the question is why well the the answer is very simple because the who has said for decades
[2:27:12.720 --> 2:27:18.240]  and the united states government has accepted for decades that their first priority for a
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:23.680]  close sustainable planet is the same as the illuminati and bill de berger agenda which is
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:29.840]  massive depopulation uh the georgia guide stone pretty well say at all i don't know who put them
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:34.800]  up i don't know what their deal was but they do want to reduce the population by a minimum of
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:43.200]  80 percent and a maximum of 90 percent that means nine out of every ten humans on the planet is slated
[2:27:43.200 --> 2:27:51.920]  to go but as long as we're going they say why don't we just pump untold amounts of the remaining
[2:27:51.920 --> 2:27:58.640]  money such as it is the worthless money that's been degraded uh by the the uh if you will the
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:03.840]  economic pandemic that's been engineered why don't we just pump all the remaining money into their
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:10.400]  hands through the diseases that they will cause and through the unbelievable amounts of money
[2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:14.800]  that these vaccines are generating well doctor we've got a long segment coming up this was the
[2:28:14.800 --> 2:28:18.240]  short one so we got plenty of time for both you and general stubblebine and to break this down
[2:28:18.240 --> 2:28:22.160]  on what you're recommending we do and how we get us the floor you know to say look we're not going
[2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:27.600]  to take forced injections because under the executive order they've that they've activated
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:32.000]  as you know the public may not they're now saying forced inoculations under level six
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:37.600]  quarantining lockdown basically code red but general briefly a lot of the experts i talked to you but
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:42.000]  you've been the former head of major intelligence divisions of the army and really wrote the book
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:47.360]  on a lot of the systems we see today looking at this most experts i talked to you said they won't
[2:28:47.360 --> 2:28:51.360]  want to kill most people right away with the shot that it'll have a bad effect on some and
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:56.400]  the soft kill will be an immediate kill with some as we saw with trials in poland and other areas
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:03.120]  but a lot of experts are saying binary weapon for those that don't know meaning this gives you
[2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:10.480]  half of it they then trigger through water or air something else later you know we know pieces
[2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:16.160]  of what are in the vaccine we absolutely do not know the entire menu that's in that vaccine
[2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:25.280]  one thing is for sure you you can rest assured since this vaccine is being put there on purpose
[2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:33.680]  to give you as an excuse to give you the shot you know that what's going to be in there and what's
[2:29:33.680 --> 2:29:39.600]  going to be in your body is not going to fit it your body very nicely stay there doctor
[2:29:40.640 --> 2:29:45.920]  we got a break long statement coming up general stay there absolutely and a lot of experts we've
[2:29:45.920 --> 2:29:51.760]  talked to genetic engineers say a lot of these cancer viruses they implant trigger later we're
[2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:58.160]  on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:30:00.880 --> 2:30:05.520]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:30:05.520 --> 2:30:10.160]  this summer number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:30:10.160 --> 2:30:15.440]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:30:15.440 --> 2:30:20.560]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:30:20.560 --> 2:30:25.360]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:30:25.360 --> 2:30:29.520]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous
[2:30:29.520 --> 2:30:33.680]  summer storm season is here again every year thousands of families lose their power from
[2:30:33.680 --> 2:30:38.240]  weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:30:38.240 --> 2:30:42.560]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[2:30:42.560 --> 2:30:47.040]  solutions from science a long time sponsor of ours you can get more information at
[2:30:47.040 --> 2:30:53.360]  www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't

[2:32:05.840 --> 2:32:11.840]  tap water in a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor they found that over 260
[2:32:11.840 --> 2:32:16.640]  chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many of these chemicals are directly
[2:32:16.640 --> 2:32:21.920]  linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental system diseases now what are you going to do
[2:32:21.920 --> 2:32:27.680]  about it the acola blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and
[2:32:27.680 --> 2:32:32.320]  your family's drinking water the acola blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the
[2:32:32.320 --> 2:32:38.160]  humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration reverse osmosis and ultra violent
[2:32:38.160 --> 2:32:44.320]  light sterilization techniques that's right clean water right from the air you breathe order today

[2:32:57.520 --> 2:33:13.440]  today that's a cola blue dot com
[2:33:20.080 --> 2:33:24.480]  ladies and gentlemen this isn't a game or a joke in general stubblebine was just saying
[2:33:24.480 --> 2:33:35.360]  okay we've got general stubblebine and his wife uh doctor rima levo you've got the floor here
[2:33:35.920 --> 2:33:40.880]  continue breaking down then because you got interrupted by some breaks start over break down
[2:33:40.880 --> 2:33:46.080]  with the intelligence we have on these vaccines what we know i mean it's just like garter cell
[2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:50.720]  admittedly is killing a whole bunch of women and girls having weird autoimmune diseases with the others
[2:33:50.720 --> 2:33:56.400]  were like almost like a bola or blood's coming out of all these orifices it's paralyzing people
[2:33:56.400 --> 2:34:02.480]  and it's like they're testing soft kills testing the media's response testing the public i don't
[2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:07.200]  know what you'd call that general in a military fashion but just like before they invaded panama
[2:34:07.200 --> 2:34:12.080]  they would have the helicopters land and do drills for six months to where they were acclimated
[2:34:12.080 --> 2:34:17.760]  so they just acclimated us now to the ambient soft kill silent weapons quiet wars let's get
[2:34:17.760 --> 2:34:22.480]  the general's take on that and then the doctor breaking down what she sees happening here how
[2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:28.320]  we get congress to say no and it like override the executive order to because they've now
[2:34:28.320 --> 2:34:33.520]  engaged level six the question is will they implement so so so general what do you call
[2:34:33.520 --> 2:34:38.960]  this soft kill system where they're increasing the deadliness of the vaccines openly killing us
[2:34:39.520 --> 2:34:44.880]  death to the left death to the right and everyone just marching and injecting their children well
[2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:52.560]  i'm not i'm not sure that i know the the military terminology for this kind of soft kill but it's
[2:34:52.560 --> 2:35:01.440]  like guerrilla warfare because it's kind of behind the scenes it's hidden you know if you're doing
[2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:09.760]  guerrilla warfare you cannot go out into the middle of the of the street and with your gun you do it
[2:35:09.760 --> 2:35:15.920]  from an ambush position so it's always hidden well there's not any difference between what is
[2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:22.880]  happening now and guerrilla warfare against our population that's exactly what's happening uh
[2:35:22.880 --> 2:35:29.200]  alex and yeah go ahead no you can just see him rolling out the total psi op for a non-event
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:34.960]  flu and then i was saying we're all basically dead in the fall take the shot with their history
[2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:40.560]  of radiating foster children black men and syphilis project shad how would anyone in their right
[2:35:40.560 --> 2:35:45.760]  mind take anything they try to give us they're not in their right mind alex they've been propagandized
[2:35:45.760 --> 2:35:50.720]  they've been propagandized they've been fluoridated they've been controlled what percentage of the
[2:35:50.720 --> 2:35:58.800]  american population is on psychoactive medication and electroshock therapy it's horrendously high
[2:35:58.800 --> 2:36:03.920]  and that means that people can be controlled that's part of a soft kill and it's been going on for
[2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:11.120]  long long time i want to remind people that the very first vaccine edward jenner's vaccine for
[2:36:11.120 --> 2:36:19.600]  smallpox was literally a vaccine for syphilis because it's bread syphilis and by the mid 19th
[2:36:19.600 --> 2:36:27.120]  century the british parliament which had made mandatory vaccination uh a law for every citizen
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:33.840]  and every resident of the british empire discovered that they had created a syphilis epidemic so
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:39.680]  they did an investigation they held a an inquiry and they discovered that they had two choices
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:45.440]  choice one admitted they would have egg all over their faces and take responsibility for the fact
[2:36:45.440 --> 2:36:52.320]  that they had killed and named and sentenced to death millions of people through this hastily
[2:36:52.320 --> 2:36:58.960]  entered into scientific fraud which is what vaccination is or do a cover-up they did a
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:05.120]  cover-up of course they chose a cover-up and they doubled edward jenner's lifelong stipend from
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:12.960]  10 000 pounds i think this was about 1853 to 20 000 pounds saying oh there's nothing wrong here
[2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:19.040]  look look we've done the right thing through self-defeat fraud and it wasn't that just a
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:25.280]  malthusian first round of eugenics through mr galton no i believe that in fact this was a
[2:37:25.280 --> 2:37:32.800]  colossal stupendous stupidity on the part of the british parliament and that they chose to save
[2:37:32.800 --> 2:37:40.080]  their own egos and careers rather than back down from the position they look at the 76 swine flu
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:46.400]  if this always breaks out the 1918 the 1976 it's always breaking out at military bases
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:58.400]  oddly enough where our soldiers are our guinea pigs
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:04.720]  stand there and stick it out so that somebody will stick a needle in it and they have no choice
[2:38:04.720 --> 2:38:10.480]  same with vaccine a i want to point out i want to point out that the same information that gary
[2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:18.000]  matsumoto so beautifully brought forward in his vaccine a and the subtitle of that book was why
[2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:24.320]  the united states is experimenting on the military and why they won't be the last
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:31.680]  he talked about squalene adjuvant he talked about introducing oils that irritate the immune system
[2:38:31.680 --> 2:38:38.240]  so they make more antibodies that means the expensive part of the vaccine the antigen
[2:38:38.240 --> 2:38:45.920]  can be in much much much smaller proportions so it's more profitable for me and then you make
[2:38:45.920 --> 2:38:52.160]  more antigens that means that you have a higher antigen tighter in your body but i want that
[2:38:52.160 --> 2:38:57.360]  accelerant that triggers the autoimmune response you're saying exactly well the the other medical
[2:38:57.360 --> 2:39:01.680]  doctors we've had on have said that's the thing causing a lot of the autism not even the mercury
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:06.480]  is that it causes that brain swelling that then causes brain damage correctly but there's another
[2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:15.200]  part to this no one and i say this as a scientist and as a physician no one has ever proven in any
[2:39:15.200 --> 2:39:22.720]  clinical trial whatsoever that that high titan that my level of that body is related in any way
[2:39:23.280 --> 2:39:29.680]  with immunity to the disease ever so this whole thing is pointless you understand it's quackery
[2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:34.720]  it's quackery but but but but okay doctor and general from a military perspective intelligence
[2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:40.000]  perspective from medical doctor perspective you've got all these deaths all over europe
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:45.520]  and asia in swine flu and bird flu trials high death rates where they eject a hundred people in it
[2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:49.440]  you know a whole bunch of them drop dead and we we put mainstream news articles on screen
[2:39:49.440 --> 2:39:54.320]  and then the media is very quiet the government even indicts people who gave the shots saying they
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:39:59.600]  were paid by pharmaceutical companies but then we can never find who they are and then we've got
[2:39:59.600 --> 2:40:04.720]  baxter involved in the new vaccine that they're involved in i mean what does this look like to you
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:09.280]  and then and then how are you coming out and saying look out with this next flu shot that's
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:17.200]  coming out um it looks no let me add that first general i'll tell you what it looks like an ambush
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:27.040]  you know if you're in a in a in a city or a town and you're going door to door in fighting
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:33.120]  you never know where the ambush is going to come from is it going to come from a roof from a window
[2:40:33.120 --> 2:40:42.880]  from a door from a hide the door you don't know and this whole thing uh alex is to me looks exactly
[2:40:42.880 --> 2:40:52.000]  like that uh door to door fighting in towns called ambush ambush that's what it is but this time the
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:57.920]  ambush is by our own forces against our own people well we can see that the whole thing's
[2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:02.560]  engineered we can see it's all hype and the vaccine's deadly and they admit won't even protect you
[2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:07.680]  from it and normally flues mutated to something less harmful or harmless how are they saying
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:11.760]  a hundred percent it's going to mutate deadly in the fall now we're not saying that's going to happen
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:15.920]  they're saying it i mean for anybody with a scientific background doctor in general it's
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:22.400]  101 that they can't say they know it's going to be deadly that clearly is a lie so it means
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:25.360]  that they know something we don't know are they going to release something else
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:30.240]  it's a lie unless they know something that has never been told to the public
[2:41:30.240 --> 2:41:34.160]  well now i want to i want to avoid giving these too much credit
[2:41:35.040 --> 2:41:44.080]  SARS fizzled avian flu fizzled the uh pandemic swine flu fizzled they may or may not be able
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:53.600]  to get the next generation of this uh this virus this genetically engineered virus to do what they
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:41:58.400]  want which has killed lots of us but it doesn't matter because they've got the vaccine which is
[2:41:58.400 --> 2:42:04.480]  much more direct much more effective now listen up folks which is the ambush which is the ambush
[2:42:04.480 --> 2:42:09.760]  if a single person and by the way let me let me reiterate i was starting to read this before
[2:42:09.760 --> 2:42:19.360]  the first target is children from kindergarten to 12th grade the second target is pregnant women
[2:42:19.360 --> 2:42:27.600]  the third cha cha the third target is adults between 45 and 65 that's the most productive
[2:42:27.600 --> 2:42:33.440]  segment of the workforce these are the people who are going to receive the vaccines and there are
[2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:38.880]  many of them just to back you up we're putting it on screen doctor uh she's not just saying this
[2:42:38.880 --> 2:42:44.320]  the news is announced children first then the elderly then the sick these are the most vulnerable
[2:42:44.320 --> 2:42:49.760]  and they admit the second the second group is pregnant women now i want to i want to just
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:56.160]  add one more thing alexa there's so much to say and time is so go ahead i'm gonna go ahead if if
[2:42:56.960 --> 2:43:04.080]  garter still does what i believe garter still does and serve of acts which is the uh the british
[2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:10.800]  equivalent of uh garter still which is about to be also approved in the united states shortly
[2:43:10.800 --> 2:43:18.320]  if these two vaccines do what i believe which is render girls in fertile there's no reason to
[2:43:18.320 --> 2:43:26.320]  believe oh yes there's no reason to believe that this new vaccine for which baxter applied for the
[2:43:26.320 --> 2:43:36.320]  patent in 2007 by the way so this surprise rush to get things on the street so to speak is total
[2:43:36.320 --> 2:43:43.440]  hype and nonsense because they've been preparing this since since 2007 if it does the same thing
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:50.720]  and it contains one of the same ingredients tween tw e w e n eighty uh which is very similar to
[2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:57.600]  polysorbate eighty and both of them injected cause infertility then what we have is not only
[2:43:57.600 --> 2:44:05.280]  death but an end of whatever race you happen to belong to let me stop you a doctor my gut from
[2:44:05.280 --> 2:44:09.600]  all these hundreds of pieces that the general talks about is sterilization because that's in
[2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:16.080]  the state department random 200 that's in the white house uh czar's internal textbook plan report
[2:44:16.080 --> 2:44:21.520]  and we know where the tetanus shots in africa asia and india they got caught in the mid 90s
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:26.480]  mainstream news for those that don't know i know you know adding a hormone to the tetanus shot to
[2:44:26.480 --> 2:44:31.520]  then cause an autoimmune response to that hormone and then basically sterilize women by abortion
[2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:36.000]  where every time they have a you get pregnant they the baby dies second trimester from that
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:45.920]  hormone uh system which was created by the world health organization through its task force on female
[2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:55.040]  sterilization through inoculation that same substance is available as quote a one year birth
[2:44:55.040 --> 2:45:02.320]  control shot for women and girls in the united states just thought i'd throw that in well i've
[2:45:02.320 --> 2:45:08.320]  i've seen us programs and and tv ads where they tell girls get your tetanus shot it's obvious i mean
[2:45:09.040 --> 2:45:13.440]  doctor i want you to keep breaking down the math and the science and the facts and and and the key
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  pens and paper ready the websites for folks so people can get involved with congress saying now
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:24.480]  we're not going to quarantine we're not taking your shots let us stay in our homes don't make
[2:45:24.480 --> 2:45:30.560]  the army drag us off but general speaking to the military the police back in 2002 with the
[2:45:30.560 --> 2:45:35.520]  model states health emergency powers act you know they ordered first responders to take it and the
[2:45:35.520 --> 2:45:40.560]  news reported la times over 99% said no so the military and police aren't stupid they even had
[2:45:40.560 --> 2:45:45.920]  bases saying no even though they were ordering them to but the firemen the police the doctors
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:51.840]  tommy thompson said no health and human services had what i mean the basic psychology this attacks
[2:45:51.840 --> 2:45:57.600]  all of us it's a very tiny eugenicist elite doing this so we need to get the message out to the
[2:45:57.600 --> 2:46:04.320]  enforcers too why would they want to serve this evil uh i mean can you comment to this phenomenon
[2:46:04.320 --> 2:46:09.840]  of the very people being killed by this are the very ones that are going to be enforcing it well
[2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:18.240]  a lot of that is uh simply because uh once you enter into the military you know the answer is yes
[2:46:18.240 --> 2:46:26.480]  sir yes sir no sir yes sir and everybody does exactly what they're told to do so if the people
[2:46:26.480 --> 2:46:34.240]  at the at the very very top know but the people at the lower levels do not know what's really going
[2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:44.400]  along they're there to take orders and it's very very hard to sort of wake yourself up when you're
[2:46:44.400 --> 2:46:52.080]  in the middle of this yes sir no sir i will do it sir kind of environment so it's very very difficult
[2:46:52.080 --> 2:46:59.120]  to also then go to the internet go to the uh who's not in the in the papers so where do they get
[2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:05.760]  their information they've got to wake up all by almost all by themselves and the very difficult
[2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:11.360]  thing to do and the people who are putting out the information alex and there's a small community of us
[2:47:11.360 --> 2:47:17.520]  are attacked by this co-intel pro nonsense and then people who want to do the right thing who
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:22.400]  want to inform themselves say well i better stay away from him i better stay away from her i better
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:27.040]  stay away from that's done to destroy our community the last thing the order would do would have you
[2:47:27.040 --> 2:47:32.160]  guys outputting out nothing but accurate info and warning people they would have you out saying it
[2:47:32.160 --> 2:47:38.720]  wasn't true and again they do this to vulcanize as they do this to break up our base i have a 2004
[2:47:38.720 --> 2:47:45.680]  army manual that's declassified on how to do this to indigenous groups exactly now i want to i want
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:52.880]  to give you the action step and if you don't take this and if you don't uh uh viralize it and this
[2:47:52.880 --> 2:47:58.720]  is the helpful side of viralization it's viral spread the info yum yes if you don't do this
[2:47:58.720 --> 2:48:04.800]  then when they come at you with a vaccine needle and your children and they say okay either
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:12.800]  bear your arm or go into detention remember that you had the choice and you didn't take it i want
[2:48:12.800 --> 2:48:23.440]  you to go to www.healthfreedomusa.org on the right hand side it says act now click on the first
[2:48:23.440 --> 2:48:30.880]  button tell legislators you want the right self quarantine not forced vaccinations and not forced
[2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:38.480]  incarceration take that every member of your family gets to send in one of those uh those action items
[2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:44.000]  if your kids are too young fill in their names that's legitimate what's happening is that congress is
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:48.880]  getting bombarded with hundreds of thousands of these and so is every state legislator in the
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:55.600]  country but we need millions not hundreds of thousands and what this is saying is oh no you
[2:48:55.600 --> 2:49:02.400]  don't this is pushback because remember a lot of state legislators and a lot of congressmen
[2:49:02.400 --> 2:49:08.560]  don't have the information you do so instead of arguing with them about vaccines are good vaccines
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:15.760]  are bad the WHO is the new world order forget that what we're saying is i want a third pass pass one
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:23.760]  take the shot pass two accept incarceration in state or federal facilities pass three i go into
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:29.920]  my house i shut the door i stay there and yeah the kids might get bored get them some extra books
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:34.240]  the point is well the last place you want to go during any time you're a medical doctor and get
[2:49:34.240 --> 2:49:38.880]  the general's take on this the last place you want to go during a pandemic is some big mass camp
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:50.080]  now let me take you back to the videos of the five hundred thousand which is only a small part
[2:49:50.080 --> 2:49:57.920]  the five hundred thousand three person disposable casket that are stockpiled outside of Atlanta and
[2:49:57.920 --> 2:50:04.640]  we know that there's alabama georgia texas colorado they're everywhere right now let me take you back
[2:50:04.640 --> 2:50:10.880]  to the mass grave sites which has been purchased and they are being prepared in upstate new york and
[2:50:10.880 --> 2:50:17.280]  in virtually every no we got the official state documents telling the cemeteries don't tell anybody
[2:50:17.280 --> 2:50:22.240]  can you bury 200 000 people on your little plot we have the document and you won't even get your
[2:50:22.240 --> 2:50:29.360]  own confidence and now ask yourself what's that for is that when i die from the vaccine is that when
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:36.560]  i die from the secondary soft kill because a lot of these vaccines are being produced on simian cells
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:42.720]  that we know contain leukemia viruses is that what you want to do just like sv 40 they admitted
[2:50:42.720 --> 2:50:47.360]  had cancer viruses and over a hundred million americans got it this is unbelievable general
[2:50:47.360 --> 2:50:53.440]  stubble binds our guests dr lebo's our guests this is just blowing me away and they're openly
[2:50:53.440 --> 2:50:58.400]  announcing mass graves martial law it doesn't mean it's gonna happen this could just be a beta

[3:03:37.440 --> 3:03:43.840]  for mainstream news media and when we decided to investigate this uh we thought this was the
[3:03:43.840 --> 3:03:51.440]  biggest story uh one could possibly investigate the largest serial killing uh that the fbi uh
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:57.920]  wouldn't really solve for six seven to eight years and when they finally did say they solved it
[3:03:57.920 --> 3:04:04.720]  it was so clearly a patsy that they put down that uh it was an insult to our intelligence
[3:04:04.720 --> 3:04:10.960]  as mainstream journalists and thus uh we had to like continue the investigation on our own
[3:04:10.960 --> 3:04:16.640]  yeah in fact uh you guys have worked for cnn rolling stone you name it you guys are uh

[3:09:48.880 --> 3:09:55.200]  film um and it just goes on and on i gotta have you guys on repeatedly obvious because i mean i
[3:09:55.200 --> 3:10:00.800]  saw your film liked it uh and then you know read the work you've done but but this is really exciting
[3:10:00.800 --> 3:10:06.080]  all right i'm gonna shut up let's get in to uh how you made the film why you made it and what it
[3:10:06.080 --> 3:10:13.680]  covers this is quite a story well you know the film began with those anthrax attacks alexa we all
[3:10:13.680 --> 3:10:20.640]  remember how you know just uh weeks after nine eleven these anthrax letters happened and they
[3:10:20.640 --> 3:10:26.480]  caused panic all across the country all across the world and you know it was in the headlines
[3:10:26.480 --> 3:10:32.880]  people were buying cipro and then after about two months or so it started fading the fbi started
[3:10:32.880 --> 3:10:39.280]  focusing on one culprit and nothing seemed to be happening with the fbi investigation
[3:10:39.280 --> 3:10:45.200]  and we were convinced that to really understand the anthrax attacks we had to take a look at this
[3:10:45.200 --> 3:10:51.040]  world of germ war research uh here in the united states and internationally and that's what we did
[3:10:51.040 --> 3:10:58.160]  with this film we started looking into this uh secret world of germ weapons to try and understand
[3:10:58.160 --> 3:11:06.320]  the anthrax attacks again that voice or that person you see at prisonplanet.tv is bob kohn
[3:11:07.360 --> 3:11:14.240]  eric uh i mean obviously uh you already knew mr kohn you got into this the same way or how did
[3:11:14.240 --> 3:11:19.920]  you guys approach this i mean obviously you learned more as you investigated or were you aware of this
[3:11:19.920 --> 3:11:25.440]  when you got into it the the the darker ramifications well bob and i in a personal
[3:11:25.440 --> 3:11:31.840]  work for many years in terms of years ago there was a program called south african now
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:38.960]  in the final days of the apartheid regime a few network producers uh got together and were very
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:45.280]  concerned how uh that censorship restrictions were being put on american networks and thus
[3:11:45.280 --> 3:11:52.800]  the actual coverage of the south african situation as the white regime uh collapsed uh
[3:11:52.800 --> 3:12:01.600]  really uh fed less and less less and less into the um network news uh budget and uh there were
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:07.200]  some people who uh got together and said to pbs can we get together and keep this south afric
[3:12:07.200 --> 3:12:13.520]  issue on the front lines and that's where i met bob bob was a great uh correspondent for cnn and uh
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:20.000]  i was a uh freelance journalist here in the united states when it came time for the anthrax attacks
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:27.760]  uh it has struck me in a very deep position uh i had never seen a more serious story disappear
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:36.320]  so quickly from the mainstream news media uh without much questioning in other words everyone
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:42.960]  talked about 9 11 yes that was a serious story you could ever do uh and there were anniversaries
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:49.520]  about 9 11 and beautiful documentaries with shining lights into the sky when we came to the
[3:12:49.520 --> 3:12:56.560]  anthrax attacks there was silence and the anthrax attacks as we say in our film anthrax war uh
[3:12:57.280 --> 3:13:06.800]  was a one two punch against the republic 9 11 was the uh you know the left jab and the anthrax
[3:13:06.800 --> 3:13:13.760]  attacks was the right cross and people didn't remember that really knockout punch look uh
[3:13:13.760 --> 3:13:21.680]  my wife uh works in uh rockefeller center new york and she remembered the planes flying she
[3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:28.960]  heard them the planes flying toward the world trade center that terrible morning she heard that
[3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:36.160]  and she's a tough gal but where she really lost it was when they opened up anthrax envelopes
[3:13:36.160 --> 3:13:41.440]  in the media center next door to her and she screamed to me over the phone the first time
[3:13:41.440 --> 3:13:49.280]  i heard this tough feminist lawyer woman screamed to me eric we've got a vice zippro and i knew some
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:58.320]  line had been crossed that's an terrorism had been done fundamentally upon uh educated media
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:05.440]  government people and um i said to myself yikes the anthrax attacks that's the most important
[3:14:05.440 --> 3:14:11.600]  piece of business and if you remember it went silent for many years and then bob had worked
[3:14:11.600 --> 3:14:16.640]  with years earlier had come to me after we had uh not been with each other for a while
[3:14:17.280 --> 3:14:24.160]  he was in africa i was in new york he came to me and said eric what's up with these anthrax attacks
[3:14:24.160 --> 3:14:30.400]  and i said you know bob i think this is the most serious thing that we as investigative journalists
[3:14:30.400 --> 3:14:37.440]  can take a look at and i know you with cnn have tried and me at uh a million other mainstream
[3:14:37.440 --> 3:14:44.800]  outlets had tried let's be independent let's see what's really going on here and that became the
[3:14:44.800 --> 3:14:52.640]  genesis of our investigation now again you guys are joining us not just on the radio but live
[3:14:52.640 --> 3:14:58.240]  uh in living color from new york at prisonplanet dot tv the film is anthrax war the website is
[3:14:58.240 --> 3:15:03.680]  anthrax war dot com again you can also get the film there or at info wars dot com now this film
[3:15:03.680 --> 3:15:11.120]  needs to be seen uh gentlemen let's start getting into the evidence of this being a cover up but
[3:15:11.120 --> 3:15:16.400]  but but just briefly mentioning what happened at that time i was obviously glued to television and
[3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:22.880]  radio covering the 9-11 attacks myself and 9-11 kind of built its peak of hysteria and then
[3:15:22.880 --> 3:15:29.680]  suddenly the anthrax and for a week or two it was as big as the 9-11 attacks and they were taking
[3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:35.600]  over the capital and the federal government the executive was ordering the capital evacuated
[3:15:35.600 --> 3:15:41.120]  which was a violation of the separation of powers and democratic enemies were getting sent anthrax
[3:15:41.120 --> 3:15:47.280]  and people that had taken photos of the bush daughters in austin falling down on each other drunk
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:51.840]  in a provocative pose were getting the letters and it was clearly meant to blame it on muslims and
[3:15:51.840 --> 3:15:56.960]  the fbi said this is run of the mill no big deal but i had bio weapons experts on saying this is
[3:15:56.960 --> 3:16:01.680]  incredibly deadly only russia the united states in england can make it this deadly then it turned
[3:16:01.680 --> 3:16:07.840]  out it was the super miniaturized with the bentonite magnetized i mean it was the special
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:13.360]  you know you know sci-fi grade us signature and of course the film covers that and then them
[3:16:13.360 --> 3:16:17.760]  then the different patsies and then murdering a patsy and they finally got a patsy they could
[3:16:17.760 --> 3:16:22.800]  shut up because you know the last two patsies were proven innocent so let's go over that but but
[3:16:22.800 --> 3:16:27.360]  i mean you guys are journalists tv guys you were there at the time wasn't for a week or so the
[3:16:27.360 --> 3:16:35.520]  anthrax as big as 9-11 and then it's like it never happened absolutely i mean you know this was
[3:16:36.160 --> 3:16:42.640]  our uh sort of scariest nightmare come to life the attack of invisible germs you know this is
[3:16:42.640 --> 3:16:47.920]  something you cannot see uh these were you know who sent it it went through the mail this was an
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:52.800]  attack against all of us because it was sent through the mail this is going to go to everybody
[3:16:52.800 --> 3:17:01.840]  and it was everybody gets the mail the perfect psychology and in some ways it also fed on on
[3:17:01.840 --> 3:17:08.880]  our fears that had been tickled let's say by so many of these hollywood movies about uh you know
[3:17:08.880 --> 3:17:16.480]  bio attacks but here was you know real life and um so yeah it caused huge panic um across the
[3:17:16.480 --> 3:17:24.080]  us across the globe there were copycat attacks um you know sypro this antibiotic that uh was the
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:30.720]  treatment for anthrax their stocks went through the roof people were buying sypro but as you said
[3:17:31.440 --> 3:17:37.520]  alex you know after a couple of weeks of being in the headlines the story faded the fbi announced
[3:17:37.520 --> 3:17:43.600]  who had this huge investigation but it's pretty pretty quickly seemed that that investigation
[3:17:43.600 --> 3:17:51.040]  was uh not going anywhere i mean they had they had their so-called person of interest um this
[3:17:51.040 --> 3:17:58.480]  army scientist by the name of steven hatfield and very early on the fbi were convinced that they
[3:17:58.480 --> 3:18:03.200]  could blame it on one person there was a lone government you know there was just one person
[3:18:03.200 --> 3:18:09.680]  behind this um and that's one of the things that we decided to look at we said well actually you
[3:18:09.680 --> 3:18:14.800]  know it's much bigger than this we've actually got to look at this from an international perspective
[3:18:14.800 --> 3:18:23.200]  because you know the the the kind of anthrax that was sent especially to congress was very very
[3:18:23.200 --> 3:18:29.840]  sophisticated uh when they uh when the fbi scientists examined the uh the anthrax that
[3:18:29.840 --> 3:18:37.120]  we used in the attacks against the congressman um that anthrax when they examined it in the lab
[3:18:37.120 --> 3:18:44.480]  in the sub bsl3 lab um high containment lab they put it on the microphone uh a microscope and the
[3:18:44.480 --> 3:18:50.720]  anthrax actually lifted up and floated into the air and the scientists had never seen
[3:18:50.720 --> 3:18:57.120]  any kind of anthrax of this sophistication ever before so this was super sophisticated anthrax
[3:18:57.120 --> 3:19:02.800]  and it really meant that this had come out of a state-sponsored program that's right and it was a
[3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:09.600]  u.s. government weapons strain it was miniaturized it was magnetized it was coded in bentonite it
[3:19:09.600 --> 3:19:17.040]  was made to float around well uh the thing was the original report said it was coded in bentonite
[3:19:17.040 --> 3:19:23.680]  now it's put so that's right it is wrong and it's put forth by abc news correspondent brian ross
[3:19:23.680 --> 3:19:30.400]  there was no bentonite in that but it was very useful because uh u.s. intelligence had identified
[3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:37.760]  bentonite as a additive that the iraqis had so you see how the administration began to say ah
[3:19:38.560 --> 3:19:44.000]  there's an iraqi connection because of this bentonite connection well well well stay there

[3:23:02.640 --> 3:23:08.240]  it's being reported that cyber spies from russia and china have now penetrated our power grid
[3:23:08.240 --> 3:23:12.880]  even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits
[3:23:12.880 --> 3:23:17.840]  of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally
[3:23:17.840 --> 3:23:23.680]  push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting us all
[3:23:23.680 --> 3:23:29.040]  in the dark are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or government created
[3:23:29.040 --> 3:23:34.640]  blackouts have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private
[3:23:34.640 --> 3:23:40.240]  supply of electrical power if so this will be the most important information you have ever heard
[3:23:40.240 --> 3:23:45.520]  solar powered generators are finally available they have no moving parts to wear out or break
[3:23:45.520 --> 3:23:52.720]  and require absolutely no gas whatsoever the government does it on the suit go to my solar

[3:24:00.320 --> 3:24:16.560]  power and then the question is what's the motive
[3:24:21.120 --> 3:24:25.280]  and this film is really well done everybody can see anthrax war
[3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:31.120]  war i mean the the white house arie fleischer admitting that the much of the white house was
[3:24:31.120 --> 3:24:37.120]  on cipro starting september 10th through the attacks but nobody else was when they knew it was
[3:24:37.120 --> 3:24:42.080]  going to be going through the capital mail system and some of the white house i mean this is really
[3:24:42.080 --> 3:24:49.120]  really suspicious uh but that's only one area going back to our guests the makers of anthrax war
[3:24:49.120 --> 3:24:54.720]  bob cone and eric nadler uh you guys know how to tell this story best you guys have got the floor
[3:24:54.720 --> 3:25:00.880]  this is a short segment long ones coming up run through uh what the film covers the evidence so
[3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:07.200]  and and bottom line what your conclusion is what the anthrax attacks really were in anthrax war
[3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:15.680]  well the deal is uh one has to look at uh who benefited and who gained ultimately from the
[3:25:15.680 --> 3:25:24.560]  anthrax attacks when the fbi named lone male man uh bruise icons as their guide they said he
[3:25:24.560 --> 3:25:34.160]  had uh a profit motive two thousand dollars government contracts or whatever to get the anthrax
[3:25:34.160 --> 3:25:42.560]  vaccine that he was working on in four detrick maryland to be uh reinvigorated and put forth for
[3:25:42.560 --> 3:25:50.640]  the u.s uh military troops we asked a legitimate question if they're saying profit motive for
[3:25:50.640 --> 3:25:58.000]  a lone gunman who really made money off his attacks and we have to be careful here we're not
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:06.720]  really pointing any fingers but we're suggesting that uh one looks at what is the real legacy
[3:26:07.360 --> 3:26:15.040]  of the anthrax attacks and without a doubt uh within the last few years uh the u.s government
[3:26:15.040 --> 3:26:23.040]  in the wake of the anthrax attacks has leased 50 to 60 billion dollars in what they call
[3:26:23.040 --> 3:26:31.280]  biodefense contracts to fight against bioterrorism and one of the things we do in the film and one
[3:26:31.280 --> 3:26:39.040]  of the things we do in the book is begin to examine the corporate connections who's making the money
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:46.800]  who's making the 50 to 60 billion dollars and once the fbi lets the profit motive as the attack
[3:26:47.600 --> 3:26:56.320]  lay into ivans we think that's a real legitimate place to look and in the book uh we pay we we
[3:26:56.320 --> 3:27:08.320]  spend a lot of time looking at very politically wired corporations that um have benefited no
[3:27:08.320 --> 3:27:15.120]  doubt through government contracts in the government response to the anthrax attacks
[3:27:15.680 --> 3:27:20.640]  absolutely in fact expanding on that and i want mr kohn's take on this as well
[3:27:21.600 --> 3:27:27.840]  and of course yours mr nadler is as you said 50 plus billion dollars for bio shield and other
[3:27:27.840 --> 3:27:34.960]  programs level four bio weapons labs in major cities expanding the u.s bio weapons program
[3:27:34.960 --> 3:27:41.520]  in a cover for uh bio weapon defense and even mainstream news has admitted that
[3:27:42.240 --> 3:27:46.480]  they wouldn't have gotten all of this if it wasn't for the anthrax attacks they got all
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:53.200]  those major contracts and that policy shift in the war and terror right after the anthrax attack
[3:27:54.240 --> 3:28:01.120]  absolutely and uh certainly that has been one concrete result of the anthrax attacks is uh
[3:28:01.120 --> 3:28:10.800]  uh birth of uh what we describe as the bioterror military industrial complex and the the the other
[3:28:10.800 --> 3:28:17.200]  troubling thing about all this is that what used to be the domain of secret government programs
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:24.960]  is now privatized so we have private corporations who are doing the classified research um that's
[3:28:24.960 --> 3:28:31.600]  going on in private labs in university labs in private research foundations all around the
[3:28:31.600 --> 3:28:36.960]  country people have no idea what's going on in those labs there's very little oversight
[3:28:36.960 --> 3:28:42.240]  and because of a lot of this is actually private there's really no way of finding out what's going
[3:28:42.240 --> 3:28:48.080]  on in those labs because a lot of that is protected by trade secrets so there are a lot of very very
[3:28:48.080 --> 3:28:56.800]  troubling uh questions a lot of experts scientists uh that we spoke to all around the world who are
[3:28:56.800 --> 3:29:02.640]  very very concerned about all this because we have to remember one thing the world of germ weapons
[3:29:02.640 --> 3:29:09.920]  there's very little difference the line between what is offensive um bio weapons research and
[3:29:09.920 --> 3:29:16.320]  defensive research is very blurry and we have to remember offensive biological weapons are actually
[3:29:16.320 --> 3:29:24.000]  outlawed by international treaties only defensive research is allowed but in order to develop
[3:29:25.360 --> 3:29:30.160]  we got a break long segment coming up plenty of time for both of you go through this story
[3:29:30.880 --> 3:29:35.920]  but i don't want to miss the elephant in the room here the government of the united states

[3:34:05.840 --> 3:34:12.640]  say something mr. nadler one of the filmmakers as we went to break go ahead well basically i'm
[3:34:12.640 --> 3:34:19.600]  i can't recall the exact point but i like to pick up on your point that there is a permanent government
[3:34:19.600 --> 3:34:29.040]  that will not go beyond the official narrative uh be it obama uh be it bush uh be it clinton
[3:34:29.040 --> 3:34:34.960]  in other words when it comes to very serious foreign policy pieces of business like the
[3:34:34.960 --> 3:34:42.320]  anthrax attacks in 9-1-1 there is a line drawn in the sand in other words the biggest impediment
[3:34:42.320 --> 3:34:51.040]  i believe to a real uh honest investigation of these anthrax attacks is a uh real spotlight
[3:34:51.040 --> 3:34:58.000]  upon the fbi investigation which is called the largest in our nation's history seven years
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  they went all around the world issued a i don't know 5500 subpoenas supposedly they want you to
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:10.400]  make it think that it's the best uh investigation in the world obama comes in he cleans house with
[3:35:10.400 --> 3:35:17.040]  everyone who does he keep fbi director robert muhler the guy in charge of the anthrax investigation
[3:35:17.600 --> 3:35:26.960]  and when muhler goes out to testify in uh september 2008 he's grilled by senator patrick lehi
[3:35:26.960 --> 3:35:35.040]  in something in our film and i think is uh the most um interesting uh scene uh lehi a target of
[3:35:35.040 --> 3:35:41.760]  the attacks and the chairman of the senate judiciary committee with oversight over the fbi
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:48.640]  who for seven years basically did not speak of the anthrax attacks when we called him out early on
[3:35:48.640 --> 3:35:56.160]  we heard from his press spokesman senator lehi never speaks about the anthrax attacks at any time
[3:35:56.160 --> 3:36:06.880]  whoa but in september uh 2008 uh one month after the fbi named ivan's as lone gunman uh lehi looks
[3:36:06.880 --> 3:36:15.120]  right into the eyes of muhler and says director muhler i do not believe that if ivan was involved
[3:36:15.120 --> 3:36:26.320]  that he was the only person who could be charged with murder whoa this was not internet chatter
[3:36:26.320 --> 3:36:34.640]  not uh alex jones chatter this was the chairman of the senate judiciary committee a recipient of
[3:36:34.640 --> 3:36:44.720]  the anthrax letters a man with direct oversight of the fbi charging conspiracy and cover-up of the
[3:36:44.720 --> 3:36:53.760]  of the largest unsolved serial murder uh investigation in fbi history and the fact
[3:36:53.760 --> 3:37:00.000]  that uh this new president obama does not come forth and saying let's get to the bottom of this
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:06.400]  makes me think that there really is kind of a permanent government that draws a line of sand
[3:37:06.400 --> 3:37:11.600]  and does not go further well that's a whole another area and i want both of you to respond to this
[3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:18.480]  the most the suspicious death of the patsy of the lone gunman uh he from what i you know from
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:23.680]  what i've read and some of what the film covers was actually investigating the anthrax and looking
[3:37:23.680 --> 3:37:29.920]  into it they already tried to burn several other patsies on a uh a middle eastern american
[3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:34.640]  scientists the south african guy they said some other people might have done it first they said
[3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:40.160]  arab's had done it and scribbling trying to frame iraq but i mean you guys are the experts
[3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:46.160]  that totally have been focusing on this so enlighten me here uh then we noticed in just a few news
[3:37:46.160 --> 3:37:51.920]  articles buried but nowhere on national news that the patsy had been grabbed put in a mental
[3:37:51.920 --> 3:37:59.440]  institution and then been in lockdown and died of prescription strength tylenol i mean how bizarre
[3:37:59.440 --> 3:38:05.440]  is that and there was and there wasn't anything about him being in government custody in the
[3:38:05.440 --> 3:38:13.360]  headlines that itself was suspicious and then it was that's it patsy's dad i mean this so they
[3:38:13.360 --> 3:38:19.200]  tried over and over again with different patsies finally they got a patsy that couldn't uh couldn't
[3:38:19.200 --> 3:38:24.720]  argue with them or uh i mean just the suspicious death alone well we have to remember the first
[3:38:24.720 --> 3:38:29.920]  guy that they the person of interest that they initially focused on was this another u.s army
[3:38:29.920 --> 3:38:36.000]  scientist steven hatfield and they said they never named it as a suspect but his name was leaked to
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:43.680]  the media he was pounded by the fbi and you know hatfield was a tough guy he sued he sued the media
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:49.840]  he sued the fbi and last year he got uh they settled with them for the government settled
[3:38:49.840 --> 3:38:55.040]  with him for almost six million dollars and basically cleared him of all wrongdoing and
[3:38:55.040 --> 3:39:02.000]  just a few weeks later the fbi announces hey we've got our guy the only problem is he's just
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:09.760]  committed suicide and you're right bruce i was also a u.s army scientist and he did help the fbi
[3:39:09.760 --> 3:39:17.040]  early in the investigation into the anthrax attacks and uh the fbi claimed that um he
[3:39:17.040 --> 3:39:24.080]  got onto their radar um a few months before a little bit longer than that before he committed
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:33.600]  suicide he was put under extreme pressure again he was harassed by the fbi his children were even
[3:39:33.600 --> 3:39:39.760]  approached and offered i think his son was offered a sports car a corvette if he could rat out his
[3:39:39.760 --> 3:39:47.840]  father um his security clearance was uh was withdrawn and bruce ivans you know was made out in the
[3:39:47.840 --> 3:39:56.080]  media to have some mental problems but it's it's true he was put on a lot of duress and the fbi
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:40:02.720]  a year ago announced that uh yeah we got our guy but he's just committed suicide the official story
[3:40:02.720 --> 3:40:10.960]  is that uh bruce ivans uh you know too was drinking heavily and took some uh some prescription
[3:40:10.960 --> 3:40:20.160]  Tylenol and uh was found unconscious and taken to a hospital and uh you know died two years two
[3:40:20.160 --> 3:40:26.880]  days later but the interesting thing alex is that we were actually in the edit room editing
[3:40:26.880 --> 3:40:33.200]  anthrax what the time you know last year when this happened and at that point you know the anthrax
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:41.040]  attacks were still unsolved and it was very interesting because bruce ivans is actually the
[3:40:41.040 --> 3:40:48.720]  fifth dead scientist in our film and we'd followed a whole trail of dead scientists in our investigation
[3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:54.480]  beginning with the death of david kelly the weapons uh expert who was an arms inspector in
[3:40:54.480 --> 3:41:01.760]  iraq who you might remember died in 2003 just after the invasion of iraq where he was found
[3:41:01.760 --> 3:41:09.920]  dead in the woods in a year's home in oxford and so we've been looking into a whole spate of mysterious
[3:41:09.920 --> 3:41:18.880]  deaths of germ warfare scientists all of whom were working with anthrax go through some of those
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:25.200]  deaths because it's not just the five suspicious anthrax connection deaths there are hundreds
[3:41:25.200 --> 3:41:31.280]  and hundreds of microbiologists and people in key bio weapons development and bio weapons
[3:41:31.280 --> 3:41:36.240]  fingerprinting especially being murdered i mean there'll be people at university in houston
[3:41:36.800 --> 3:41:41.920]  a van in a five mile an hour zone runs over them in front of the students and then backs back over
[3:41:41.920 --> 3:41:48.480]  and leaves or people will be one guy in virginia the washington post reported was like satanically
[3:41:48.480 --> 3:41:53.920]  sacrificed with all his guts ripped out and heart cut out and pentagrams carved in him others are
[3:41:53.920 --> 3:41:59.360]  drowned in puddles of water others get double capped in the head and i'm sure most of it isn't
[3:41:59.360 --> 3:42:04.640]  involving this case but other cases of coverups i mean i wouldn't want to be a microbiologist
[3:42:04.640 --> 3:42:11.200]  working in or around government programs in fact that is the sentiment that was um uh
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:20.960]  expressed by john eldridge a um englishman who is the editor of jane's defense weeklies uh chemical
[3:42:20.960 --> 3:42:28.320]  and biological defense news report perhaps the most sophisticated analysis of the chemical and
[3:42:28.320 --> 3:42:36.640]  biological weapons uh used by uh u n's weapons inspectors um it has a long history of being
[3:42:37.200 --> 3:42:44.480]  uh a reputable piece of business and he said uh when looking at this spate of dead scientists
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:52.080]  he said jeez i would not like to be a microbiologist and this quote has been uh confirmed in a
[3:42:52.080 --> 3:43:00.640]  couple of places now look the list does grow if you go to internet sites at 40 50 60 70 and i've
[3:43:00.640 --> 3:43:05.200]  seen it more than that i've seen it more than that of you adam all together uh i mean over the
[3:43:05.200 --> 3:43:10.080]  last because i mean i was seeing lists before the anthrax attacks before 2000 sometimes i mean you
[3:43:10.080 --> 3:43:17.120]  may be talking about some of the modern list uh but i mean take dr. david kelly he sends emails
[3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:21.440]  saying i'll be found dead in the woods if i speak out he tells friends he tells people
[3:43:21.440 --> 3:43:28.160]  i've interviewed on the show uh he is writing a tell all book on them locals come up in the park
[3:43:28.160 --> 3:43:33.760]  see five guys in black uniforms run away from his dead body there's no blood at the scene or very
[3:43:33.760 --> 3:43:39.040]  little from slit wrist there's three undissolved pills in his stomach and they say he died of
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:44.720]  splitting his wrist and pills i mean this is i mean could my dead body could i be seen with
[3:43:44.720 --> 3:43:50.320]  black ops standing over me with witnesses and still i mean maybe they could blow my head off on tv
[3:43:50.320 --> 3:43:56.560]  and say i killed myself i mean i mean this is getting ridiculous yeah well you know uh anything
[3:43:56.560 --> 3:44:02.480]  can happen in this modern media age and i think the story about kelly is very instructive i mean
[3:44:02.480 --> 3:44:09.920]  kelly's death um it has been suspicious from the get-go uh in our film uh anthrax war we interview
[3:44:09.920 --> 3:44:15.520]  a member of parliament noren baker who takes a full year off from his responsibilities
[3:44:15.520 --> 3:44:22.160]  to investigate kelly's death this is no um kind of uh you know out of mainstream guides a member of
[3:44:22.160 --> 3:44:27.840]  the british parliament and he ends up writing a book called the uh strange death of david kelly
[3:44:27.840 --> 3:44:37.360]  and he says david kelly was murdered and this is an astounding claim that has just been endorsed
[3:44:37.360 --> 3:44:44.880]  by 13 leading british doctors who have petitioned and hired a lawyer to ask that the brown government
[3:44:44.880 --> 3:44:52.560]  in england which is now considering a review of the Blair policies that that led to the war in
[3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:58.560]  iraq they have four areas they want to investigate from the downing street memo which you know about
[3:44:58.560 --> 3:45:07.760]  etc to the death of david kelly and basically the rap uh on kelly is the most telling piece of evidence
[3:45:07.760 --> 3:45:15.200]  that mp norman baker discovered was that the knife he supposedly used as he went to the
[3:45:15.200 --> 3:45:23.360]  woods all depressed about uh being um officially uh sacrificed by the british government as a
[3:45:23.360 --> 3:45:29.680]  leak that destroyed their case for war all depressed he went into the woods and he took a knife
[3:45:29.680 --> 3:45:36.480]  he slit his wrists and he swallowed some uh tablets from his wife's medicine cabinet what
[3:45:36.480 --> 3:45:45.600]  uh baker got the police to admit was that there was no fingerprints on the knife well how do you
[3:45:45.600 --> 3:45:54.800]  kill yourself no fingerprints no glove and the kelly murder um and i don't say suicide i say
[3:45:54.800 --> 3:46:01.440]  murder because i really do believe was a murder as to increase as to 70 of the british public
[3:46:01.440 --> 3:46:10.400]  and a growing percentage of the opinion leaders in uh the uk uh who killed kelly uh becomes a
[3:46:10.400 --> 3:46:18.640]  very important piece of business and he becomes the poster boy poster child poster man for these
[3:46:18.640 --> 3:46:25.600]  you know 100 or so other suspicious deaths of microbiologists in fact one of the things we
[3:46:25.600 --> 3:46:32.800]  mentioned to a member of parliament who has mentioned to us that he'll be entering uh uh
[3:46:32.800 --> 3:46:40.720]  interviews we did for our film into the official parliamentary parliamentary inquiry into uh
[3:46:40.720 --> 3:46:50.720]  kelly's death in the rush to war uh basically uh he said um that uh the kelly death uh combined uh
[3:46:50.720 --> 3:46:59.440]  with um the death of kelly's successor as the head of microbiology the germ warfare plant
[3:46:59.440 --> 3:47:06.800]  at port and down in england he died in a light airplane crash a suspicious crash crash 11 months
[3:47:06.800 --> 3:47:14.560]  after kelly it's kind of mind blowing what we do in our film anthrax war and we do in our book
[3:47:14.560 --> 3:47:23.680]  dead silence is we begin to show that to work in this field of germ warfare is dangerous to your
[3:47:23.680 --> 3:47:30.240]  health because you end up killing yourself suicide the official story or something else
[3:47:30.240 --> 3:47:37.120]  worse happens to you yeah i mean i mean also you got to look at what are these guys doing and we
[3:47:37.120 --> 3:47:43.200]  decided to look at kelly and what was what was his job in germ warfare what was he doing and what
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:50.880]  was he doing at port and down this lab which is uh the u.s. defense department you uh yeah excuse me
[3:47:50.880 --> 3:47:56.240]  the united kingdom's uh secret lab where they do all their germ research and one of the things that
[3:47:56.240 --> 3:48:04.080]  we discovered was that uh port and down has got a long history of human experiments of testing
[3:48:04.080 --> 3:48:10.320]  bio weapons on uh on volunteers and chemical and chemical actually killed some people in
[3:48:10.320 --> 3:48:14.400]  association with that i've had some of their family members on they'd march them in tell them
[3:48:14.400 --> 3:48:22.240]  they were going to test a bio hit them with sarin or vx uh but yeah yeah but expanding on that uh
[3:48:23.280 --> 3:48:27.760]  i found they create their cadres of killers at these things too they find scientists
[3:48:27.760 --> 3:48:32.560]  that believe the end justifies the means and then sometimes they kind of wake up and realize
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:35.840]  what's happened that's why they've got to be killed but i just want to add before we're
[3:48:35.840 --> 3:48:41.440]  around a time here to blitz through other key points made in the film people need to support
[3:48:41.440 --> 3:48:48.880]  alternative news filmmakers and cinema and you guys are great filmmakers award-winning filmmakers
[3:48:48.880 --> 3:48:54.640]  you know went over your bio earlier anthrax war needs to be seen and we've got these up on info
[3:48:54.640 --> 3:49:02.000]  wars dot com they're available i want everybody to get the full picture in this film at info wars
[3:49:02.000 --> 3:49:08.480]  dot com anthrax war filmed by bob kohn and erik nadler again available at info wars dot com
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:16.320]  or 8882533139 mr kohn go ahead and finish the point you're making when i interrupted there
[3:49:16.320 --> 3:49:21.120]  and then in the time we've got left rattle off some of the other key points interesting things
[3:49:21.120 --> 3:49:25.360]  because there's so much in this film and then so much other stuff i'm sure you discovered that you
[3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:30.400]  didn't have time to put in the film well yeah okay we were talking about david kelly and and we
[3:49:30.400 --> 3:49:35.120]  discovered you know that david kelly was working at port and down where you know he headed the
[3:49:35.120 --> 3:49:40.320]  microbiology department for many years there and they were involved like you said in human experiments
[3:49:40.880 --> 3:49:47.600]  at port and down on the servicemen and there was a huge police investigation here by the local
[3:49:47.600 --> 3:49:53.600]  police there into these human experiments and they were looking at scientists and possibly quite
[3:49:53.600 --> 3:49:59.840]  possibly kelly's uh was a was a target of this investigation the other thing we discovered about
[3:49:59.840 --> 3:50:07.600]  kelly was his relationship with the apartheid era uh south african apartheid era secret germ weapons
[3:50:07.600 --> 3:50:16.080]  program during the apartheid years south africa had a small but very sophisticated germ war program
[3:50:16.080 --> 3:50:21.760]  and one of the aims of this program was to come up with something that they called the black bomb
[3:50:21.760 --> 3:50:27.520]  and that was an ethnic weapon race specific bio weapon then cheney then wrote about that
[3:50:27.520 --> 3:50:31.200]  we're going to come back and discuss that after this quick break in the final segment cheney
[3:50:31.200 --> 3:50:37.280]  in his september 20th 2000 rebuilding america's defenses said we need to legitimize the use
[3:50:37.280 --> 3:50:42.240]  of these race specific bio weapons so gentlemen i'm glad you got into that i forgot to bring that up
[3:50:43.200 --> 3:50:48.320]  and uh just just amazing information of course you interview uh the head of the south african
[3:50:48.320 --> 3:50:55.040]  program uh it's anthrax war available at info wars dot com folks you gotta get this movie this
[3:50:55.040 --> 3:50:59.680]  needs to be seen by everybody we've got to point out this false flag event

[3:51:07.120 --> 3:51:13.120]  fears the people there is liberty our god given right to life and liberty and the right to determine
[3:51:13.120 --> 3:51:18.720]  what is best for our lives and our families health are in jeopardy if we the people do not diligently

[3:54:09.120 --> 3:54:13.360]  folks i don't want to bash this company but i was at the health food stores i'm trying to get
[3:54:13.360 --> 3:54:20.240]  healthy again grabbing liquid natural vitamins and minerals and i've always joked that they'd start
[3:54:20.240 --> 3:54:24.560]  putting mercury on the store shelves because i've got national federal reports saying mercury's
[3:54:24.560 --> 3:54:28.960]  now good for you which is just completely ridiculous all the studies show one of those
[3:54:28.960 --> 3:54:36.960]  deadly heavy metals here is a popular liquid vitamin i'm not going to say the name i mean they
[3:54:36.960 --> 3:54:41.280]  can zoom out i'm sure the bigger bottle but not for i mean i don't want to be mean to this company
[3:54:41.280 --> 3:54:49.280]  because they may just be nuts but uh there it is mercury i mean and i wasn't paying attention
[3:54:49.280 --> 3:54:55.200]  you know the person at the store recommended though this is a really good brand and uh
[3:54:56.560 --> 3:55:02.000]  maybe i'll get them maybe i'm wrong maybe maybe led's good for you like cnbc says maybe i've been
[3:55:02.000 --> 3:55:06.080]  wrong that you know maybe the flu shot is good folks i wanted to say bye to our guests here i
[3:55:06.080 --> 3:55:10.160]  want to have them back up because they've certainly had some very informative adventures
[3:55:10.160 --> 3:55:13.440]  and the film is anthrax war next time they come we'll play some clips of it
[3:55:13.440 --> 3:55:18.960]  at prismplanet.tv prismplanet.tv for you i do want to thank a sponsor though here at the end
[3:55:18.960 --> 3:55:25.040]  of the show before we finish up with race specific bio weapons with the makers of anthrax war
[3:55:25.040 --> 3:55:31.200]  and that is eatfoodsdirect.com in these insane times when we're being told mercury's good for us
[3:55:31.200 --> 3:55:35.760]  and they're talking about depression and wars with iran the rest of it i bought storeable foods
