[00:00.000 --> 00:28.280]  It for wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:28.280 --> 00:49.920]  On the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:49.920 --> 01:03.120]  It's Wednesday, June 16th. The year is 2021, and I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:03.120 --> 01:10.480]  Incredible things are happening as we speak. The fires of liberty and a global awakening
[01:10.480 --> 01:20.480]  are exploding, and the forces of corruption are striking back.
[01:20.480 --> 01:28.640]  I don't want to call it guilt, but a lot of drive and inner fire that makes me angry
[01:28.640 --> 01:36.040]  at myself for not doing more and not really stating how real this tyrannical takeover
[01:36.040 --> 01:42.160]  is to really get it across to people that fighting back is what makes our world good
[01:42.160 --> 01:48.200]  and that lying down is what makes our world horrible, and that I'm usually years ahead
[01:48.200 --> 01:55.160]  of major developments, but sometimes when I'm too close to something, I'm behind the
[01:55.160 --> 02:02.160]  curve, and that's not really the case here. But at the same time, I think I could have
[02:02.160 --> 02:10.760]  done a better job, and I'm just going to leave it at that, because it is overwhelming the
[02:10.760 --> 02:16.400]  evidence that criminal elements of the federal government provocateur and staged January
[02:16.400 --> 02:24.640]  6th, and I saw it coming. I warned people that they were going to pull a false flag,
[02:24.640 --> 02:28.560]  and I did it masterfully the way they roped in a bunch of people through queue and the
[02:28.560 --> 02:36.320]  way they infiltrated the oath keepers and the proud boys and others, and now because
[02:36.320 --> 02:45.960]  of court documents that have come out, it's confirmed that 20 FBI agents, actual agents,
[02:45.960 --> 02:54.640]  and informants led the attack with a consortium of Antifa, like Jaden X on record, admitting
[02:54.640 --> 02:58.760]  days before they were going to try to burn the Capitol down. And of course, the police
[02:58.760 --> 03:05.040]  were put in the middle of it, undermanned by design. This was a psychological warfare
[03:05.040 --> 03:12.200]  operation to manipulate a crowd, and President Trump was set up, I was set up, and I've been
[03:12.200 --> 03:17.880]  saying that since the day it happened, but I've been in contact with the great folks
[03:17.880 --> 03:22.640]  over at Revolver News. I've been working with them some, giving them my feedback on this
[03:22.640 --> 03:28.960]  for several weeks. I had been working with other folks to get the information, obviously,
[03:28.960 --> 03:35.440]  out to the great Tucker Carlson, and Tucker did a really splendid job last night, so I'm
[03:35.440 --> 03:41.320]  going to air the entire 15-minute monologue coming up, and then the investigative journalist
[03:41.320 --> 03:48.200]  from Revolver News that really should get a Pulitzer Prize for what he's done, Darren
[03:48.200 --> 03:56.720]  Beattie, will be joining us. But you need to read the full report at Revolver News,
[03:56.720 --> 04:03.720]  and that is, unindicted co-conspirators in the January 6 case raises disturbing questions
[04:03.720 --> 04:11.600]  of federal foreknowledge, and that is putting it extremely lightly. That is why they will
[04:11.600 --> 04:22.520]  not release the information. And I've wondered if I subconsciously haven't really gone after
[04:22.520 --> 04:29.560]  this because I was in the middle of all this and felt guilty for not seeing it coming.
[04:29.560 --> 04:32.200]  And I really think that's the case. I mean, I've been all over this like flies on, you
[04:32.200 --> 04:38.800]  know what, but we should have been even more intensely focused on this because this is
[04:38.800 --> 04:42.360]  the key. And on this point when we come back, they're getting ready to stage massive false
[04:42.360 --> 04:46.880]  flags to blame on us, so we need to expose this false flag to stop the next false flags
[04:46.880 --> 04:50.840]  that I believe will be much bigger and more devastating, and will usher in hell on earth
[04:50.840 --> 04:54.880]  that I'll lay out so you get tomorrow's news today when we come back. And I mean, I'm
[04:54.880 --> 04:57.280]  going to be all of you inside baseball.
[04:57.280 --> 05:09.440]  And I'm going to be all of you inside baseball, and I'm going to be all of you inside baseball.
[05:09.440 --> 05:14.440]  And I'm going to be all of you inside baseball.
[05:14.440 --> 05:30.560]  And I'm going to be all of you inside baseball, and I'm going to be all of you inside baseball.
[05:30.560 --> 05:37.560]  And I'm going to be all of you inside baseball.
[05:37.560 --> 05:59.560]  And I'm going to be all of you inside baseball.
[06:07.560 --> 06:24.680]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this live June 16th, Wednesday transmission. Every day
[06:24.680 --> 06:32.160]  I'm on air could be my very last, every day that you're tuning in to be the last time
[06:32.160 --> 06:38.600]  you ever hear this broadcast live. I am like a man on a piece of wreckage in the ocean
[06:38.600 --> 06:45.120]  with large tiger sharks circling me, but that's okay. I didn't think that I would make this
[06:45.120 --> 06:49.400]  far in the fight against the New World Order. I always knew it would be up to others that
[06:49.400 --> 06:53.000]  will win the fight in the end because we don't have a choice, or this is such an incredible
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.800]  anti-human evil that we face. But you saw it trend over the weekend, arrest Alex Jones,
[06:59.800 --> 07:09.960]  the number one thing, a political search term. Alex Jones trended number one, period. And
[07:09.960 --> 07:15.800]  you see the left just lying about it constantly and saying arrest me for January 6th because
[07:15.800 --> 07:19.560]  they know they staged it. They know they did it. They even had that Time Magazine article.
[07:19.560 --> 07:24.320]  In fact, print me that again, guys. The Time Magazine article from a few months ago. I
[07:24.320 --> 07:29.200]  forget the exact headline, but it was a headline like, learn about the secret coalition that
[07:29.200 --> 07:34.400]  worked together in the cabal that stopped Trump. And they admit they set us up on January
[07:34.400 --> 07:39.920]  6th, all of it. So criminals love to brag. They love to celebrate. At the same time, while
[07:39.920 --> 07:45.640]  they try to put myself and President Trump in prison for January 6th, that's not going
[07:45.640 --> 07:49.480]  to happen because they don't want a real investigation of it. I could destroy them in court, destroy
[07:49.480 --> 07:56.720]  them in Congress, destroy in front of any grand jury in five minutes, and show that 20 FBI
[07:56.720 --> 08:03.000]  reports, and hundreds of informants in federal court documents that Tucker Carlson covered
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.480]  last night, I made the decision not to get into this until it broke on Tucker. Because
[08:08.480 --> 08:13.120]  I thought he'd do a better job than I did. He did. He did a great job in 15 minutes.
[08:13.120 --> 08:18.320]  We're going to be playing it coming up. And we have Darren Beatty, the incredible investigative
[08:18.320 --> 08:23.200]  journalist who I did work with some on the story, joining us as well in the second hour.
[08:23.200 --> 08:26.880]  Been working on it with him a little bit for the last few weeks with some other great folks.
[08:26.880 --> 08:34.200]  So that's all happening. That's all about to unfold here. But you need to understand
[08:34.200 --> 08:42.400]  that the reason this is so important is that they are preparing massive false flags, probably
[08:42.400 --> 08:47.920]  at the end of the summer, maybe even sooner, that are going to trigger a huge bloody race
[08:47.920 --> 08:52.600]  war in this country. And the attempt to have gun confiscation, which will cause a civil
[08:52.600 --> 08:57.600]  war, which is the plan of the globalist, once and for all, scuttle and wreck the country
[08:57.600 --> 09:03.960]  for communist China and the EU to take over. The globalist hate Russia and they hate America.
[09:03.960 --> 09:07.440]  Because of the two linked up, the Carnegie Endowment always admitted, you would have
[09:07.440 --> 09:16.880]  a land bridge from Alaska to Russia, and you could have a system linking the whole world.
[09:16.880 --> 09:20.640]  We have the troops. We have the resources. We have the culture. We have the ingenuity.
[09:20.640 --> 09:28.800]  We have everything. And that Russia-U.S. link up would be the world power period. No debate.
[09:28.800 --> 09:35.240]  Just from geographical control alone. And it basically ends at that point because Russia
[09:35.240 --> 09:38.840]  sits in the middle of the main world and then the United States sits in the middle of the
[09:38.840 --> 09:44.120]  Americas, the New World. And I'm not going to go into all the books, scientific reports
[09:44.120 --> 09:49.640]  and historical analyses that have been done on that. But we are to be destroyed. So is
[09:49.640 --> 09:54.200]  Russia. And then out of that, the EU and China are to rise and rule the entire planet and
[09:54.200 --> 10:01.320]  then depopulate. And so they have a kept group of criminals, globalist, communist, perverts,
[10:01.320 --> 10:06.440]  pedophiles that run the Justice Department. I mean, it's a club of pedophiles at the top.
[10:06.440 --> 10:11.320]  They're pretty much all pedophiles. And that's why you saw them cover up Penn State and all
[10:11.320 --> 10:16.840]  the rest of it. And I knew about that from Ted Gunnerson, who said the pedophiles were
[10:16.840 --> 10:21.880]  taking over the FBI. He learned after he retired and left the FBI. And he was in line to be
[10:21.880 --> 10:26.360]  the FBI director. He's the kind of guy that wanted to be the director. That was the old
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.520]  FBI that had its own problems. But the new one was just satanic. And we can all see the
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.040]  fruits of that. So here's the big announcement. They got court documents and others are now
[10:37.040 --> 10:43.760]  having to come out as they try to try and have trials. Because we're almost six months
[10:43.760 --> 10:50.600]  out, these people being held in solitary confinement, that the feds had up to 20 agents, hundreds
[10:50.600 --> 11:00.000]  of informants inside. And they were basically leading the proud boys, leading the other
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.240]  organizations like Oath Keepers. And that doesn't mean that the majority of Oath Keepers
[11:05.240 --> 11:11.560]  are bad or Stuart Rhodes is bad. But I mean, it was riddled with actual federal officers.
[11:11.560 --> 11:15.160]  And that's why you'd see a few of them indicted. And later, they had to drop the charges because
[11:15.160 --> 11:18.640]  that was one hand, not knowing what the other hand was doing. But we're in there leading
[11:18.640 --> 11:23.640]  it, just like Jaden X was inside, leading it with his crew of Antifa. We have video
[11:23.640 --> 11:31.320]  of them getting out of their black uniforms into their Make America Great Again gear.
[11:31.320 --> 11:35.760]  So it's all coming out. We're going to talk to the investigative reporter coming up next
[11:35.760 --> 11:40.920]  hour. But I just want to telegraph to all of you and be 1 billion percent clear, 1 trillion.
[11:40.920 --> 11:49.680]  I want to be just to infinity clear on this, OK? They didn't produce hundreds of TV shows,
[11:49.680 --> 11:55.720]  hundreds of movies, hundreds of thousands of news articles for the last five, six years
[11:55.720 --> 12:01.200]  about race war and killing the white people and white people are the devil and white people
[12:01.200 --> 12:06.520]  are killing blacks in record numbers. Not just here, but Black Lives Matter is a worldwide
[12:06.520 --> 12:11.960]  movement that Western countries are bad, that capitalism is bad, that white people are bad.
[12:11.960 --> 12:17.320]  So the government can then speak for black people. Corporations can hide behind black
[12:17.320 --> 12:20.440]  people as their spokesperson says nothing to do with black people. They're just being
[12:20.440 --> 12:26.640]  used as the guilt figurehead to then get everyone to sign on to a globalist agenda. And then
[12:26.640 --> 12:32.480]  out of that, they're going to trigger events, bombings, shooting attacks of black churches,
[12:32.480 --> 12:40.400]  colleges, events that will then be blamed on the secret underground, foggy, right wing,
[12:40.400 --> 12:45.400]  white supremacy that Biden and the Attorney General and all of them tell you is the number
[12:45.400 --> 12:49.400]  one threat and is going to just kill millions of people. I mean, they're saying that this
[12:49.400 --> 12:53.880]  giant secret army of white supremacists are about to take over. And really, all that is
[12:53.880 --> 12:57.120]  is, is the globalists take the nation over, is the globalists try to take the guns, they
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.400]  will stage events, they will escalate a civil war, and they will call everyone fighting
[13:01.400 --> 13:06.520]  for America and freedom in the Second Amendment and right to life, Nazis, and then stir up
[13:06.520 --> 13:11.120]  racial conflict in the middle of it to then try to sell that idea in the media and get
[13:11.120 --> 13:14.480]  everybody else to come out and declare, no, we're with the government and we're with the
[13:14.480 --> 13:20.320]  confiscation of guns, we're not Nazis. So that's the whole movement to buffalo everybody
[13:20.320 --> 13:25.320]  into that. And when the FBI says, oh, the Q movement is getting ready to start killing
[13:25.320 --> 13:32.280]  federal agents everywhere and killing citizens, they mean federal agents that are Q manipulating
[13:32.280 --> 13:37.920]  people who are not part of the federal government or the FBI to carry out attacks. And that's
[13:37.920 --> 13:43.160]  the FBI specialty. Even 10 years ago, the New York Times had the headline that the FBI
[13:43.160 --> 13:52.200]  triggered and created all of the last decade's terror attacks. And I can go through every
[13:52.200 --> 13:57.400]  major event where it was a black supremacist, white supremacist, Islamists, you name it,
[13:57.400 --> 14:00.920]  they would go wind them up, they would direct them, they would give them the bomb, they
[14:00.920 --> 14:07.760]  would let them then carry out the attacks so the FBI would get more funding. So, yeah,
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.920]  the FBI created the unabomber as well. There's the headline right there and the CIA. So this
[14:12.920 --> 14:20.080]  is done over and over again and this time, the Secret Service, the FBI, the highest levels
[14:20.080 --> 14:23.760]  were all involved and they directly tried to set the president up, they tried to set
[14:23.760 --> 14:28.520]  me up, but it misfired. There were people that thought they were going in there with
[14:28.520 --> 14:33.560]  some rapid reaction team that's come out with the zip ties to grab the members of Congress
[14:33.560 --> 14:38.000]  and all that and then it would have been such a huge real crisis that they could have brought
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.960]  in permanent martial law, which they already had set up and ready with the barbed wire
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.440]  and the troops they were going to call up, but it misfired so that looked like tyranny
[14:45.440 --> 14:50.200]  instead of a response to a horrible attack and it's because a bunch of people fought
[14:50.200 --> 14:54.160]  twice at the end, a lot of veterans and people that thought they were being secretly commanded
[14:54.160 --> 15:01.520]  by Trump, but really it was the FBI through Q. And so it was going to be so horrible that
[15:01.520 --> 15:04.280]  they thought that they probably would have been killed Trump that day, probably would
[15:04.280 --> 15:09.560]  have killed me and then started their civil war with America, but by the grace of God,
[15:09.560 --> 15:16.360]  the whole thing basically was a flop. It fizzled out. It was like a, not really a dud.
[15:16.360 --> 15:20.680]  You can have a hot shell, a hot round that was overloaded, boom, you fire your rifle
[15:20.680 --> 15:25.760]  and you tell it was a hot load, or you can have one that's a misfire or kind of a fizzle
[15:25.760 --> 15:31.160]  out is, you know, the term I hear my grandpa use, but where the shot goes out, it's like
[15:31.160 --> 15:34.720]  a shotgun, but you know, you shoot a slug out of the shotgun and it doesn't even go
[15:34.720 --> 15:39.160]  through the piece of metal you were shooting was kind of a weak load that didn't fully
[15:39.160 --> 15:44.160]  detonate all the powder. That's what happened there, but they're organizing rapidly and
[15:44.160 --> 15:50.480]  getting total martial law set up and everything and the lockdown was a drill for that for
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.000]  the big event. And we better start talking about that and getting ready because they're
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.960]  not going to give up. I guarantee you, the attorney general's got car bombs loaded up
[15:57.960 --> 16:06.200]  right now, truck bombs loaded up. Your voice counts when you share information, be it over
[16:06.200 --> 16:10.960]  the internet or in person, it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is
[16:10.960 --> 16:15.800]  unpopular. They know you're angry. And now to get around big tech, it's more important
[16:15.800 --> 16:20.160]  than ever that we use every tool we've got. Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up

[17:06.360 --> 17:11.080]  so have I said that. But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[17:11.080 --> 17:14.160]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[17:14.160 --> 17:19.000]  can to shut us down. So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air and please support the
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.760]  local station you're listening to as well. At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while
[17:23.760 --> 17:29.040]  you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because
[17:29.040 --> 17:34.480]  it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing. I need your help
[17:34.480 --> 17:39.040]  more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalist but I can't do it if you don't
[17:39.040 --> 17:43.680]  support us. So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you
[17:43.680 --> 17:50.280]  can and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[17:50.280 --> 17:54.840]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[17:54.840 --> 18:00.760]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God. Thank you so much.
[18:00.760 --> 18:05.360]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person but because of the globalist
[18:05.360 --> 18:10.120]  and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and
[18:10.120 --> 18:14.480]  we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God. And I know
[18:14.480 --> 18:18.000]  some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me a break.
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.280]  The statinism's out in the open. I've always been a Christian but now the fact that it's
[18:22.280 --> 18:25.680]  a fight between good and evil is so clear. And I get it. A lot of you've been turned
[18:25.680 --> 18:30.800]  off by big churches, a lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class system
[18:30.800 --> 18:35.520]  and I get it, me too. Believe me, I'm one of them but it's that relationship with God
[18:35.520 --> 18:42.280]  and just God's universe that God created that is so essential and God created the universe
[18:42.280 --> 18:46.240]  for us to have communion with God through and to have life. And so that's what InfoWars
[18:46.240 --> 18:49.640]  is really all about. So thank you all for your word of mouth. Thank you for spreading
[18:49.640 --> 18:53.280]  the word about InfoWars and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting

[19:03.280 --> 19:10.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:10.280 --> 19:31.200]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back. This is the Alex Jones show and I want to
[19:31.200 --> 19:39.360]  be completely clear again. The globalists have been massively preparing the minds of
[19:39.360 --> 19:48.800]  the public for huge false flag terror attacks to be blamed on their political opposition.
[19:48.800 --> 19:54.880]  There is basically no white supremacist violence or attacks in the United States. It's incredibly
[19:54.880 --> 20:02.960]  rare. But the head of the FBI, the head of the Justice Department are all over TV, all
[20:02.960 --> 20:09.180]  over Congress saying it is just incredibly deadly and it's imminent and everyone's going
[20:09.180 --> 20:16.080]  to be dying. I'll play some of those clips coming up next segment so that when it happens,
[20:16.080 --> 20:19.680]  everybody's got their talking points and they're ready and they're lined up. And with it comes
[20:19.680 --> 20:26.000]  extrajudicial gun confiscation, which is going to kick off real resistance. And listen, I
[20:26.000 --> 20:29.880]  don't want a civil war. I'm not going to be involved in this. I'm not enemies of anybody
[20:29.880 --> 20:36.000]  at the FBI. If I was in federal law enforcement, I would be the last person that would want
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.560]  to be in the middle of a civil war with the American people. This is so stupid how the
[20:42.560 --> 20:47.200]  globalists are playing everybody off against each other. But that's what's happening.
[20:47.200 --> 20:52.240]  And they haven't just arrested one of our crew members that did go into the Capitol
[20:52.240 --> 20:58.640]  and was peaceful as a journalist and recorded what was happened. They have pulled in other
[20:58.640 --> 21:04.120]  people that work here and have interrogated them. They've asked me, my crew has not to
[21:04.120 --> 21:08.480]  get into the names of who that was done to. But it's all about me and it's all about
[21:08.480 --> 21:13.920]  are we planning this and that. So this is going on everywhere. They're not asking us
[21:13.920 --> 21:18.400]  what we did on January 6th. They know we tried to stop what federal agents did, provocaturing
[21:18.400 --> 21:24.040]  the crowd. By the way, they did a pretty good job, but it fizzled out. So at first they
[21:24.040 --> 21:31.080]  were winning, but then the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray. They're wanting
[21:31.080 --> 21:34.640]  to know about what we're planning and what we're going to do because we're being framed
[21:34.640 --> 21:41.160]  and set up for a mass and false flag, where the truck bomb gets detonated or somebody
[21:41.160 --> 21:46.000]  shoots up the church, the black church, and then they did it for Alex Jones. They did
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.880]  it for Donald Trump. They did it because they were mad about forced inoculation. Whatever
[21:51.880 --> 22:00.000]  the case is, you can see it and you turn on the TV, the plots of the cop shows and the
[22:00.000 --> 22:07.360]  movies, the state of Jones, it's just everywhere. I can't turn television on and it's evil
[22:07.360 --> 22:12.240]  white people are killing black people. To create this guilt and then the media goes,
[22:12.240 --> 22:17.640]  well, we represent the black people, so do what the government says. It's a very, very
[22:17.640 --> 22:24.920]  simple equation. In fact, I saw a meme at the center of the crew of a big fat cat corporation
[22:24.920 --> 22:31.520]  sitting on top of the Capitol, the big fat cat's like a pig. He's got his big top hat
[22:31.520 --> 22:36.560]  on and the left's like, you fascist, you know, rich billionaire, I'm going to get you. And
[22:36.560 --> 22:41.840]  now the left's all hugging him because he's put a rainbow flag out in front of the Capitol
[22:41.840 --> 22:47.600]  and has a rainbow flag on his hat. I mean, that's all that is, is, again, big corporations
[22:47.600 --> 22:56.000]  hiding behind, oh, we're gay, we're rainbow. And you can't criticize gay, so they need
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.960]  a takeover. And this is the most important point I'm going to make here. They know it's
[23:00.960 --> 23:04.960]  coming out about the massive concerted election fraud. They know states are passing laws under
[23:04.960 --> 23:09.840]  the Constitution to block further fraud. They know Biden's falling apart. They know Kamala
[23:09.840 --> 23:13.840]  is falling apart. They know that all their agenda is in trouble. They know that the
[23:13.840 --> 23:20.440]  truth is coming out about the deep state under Obama and others command launching the attack
[23:20.440 --> 23:31.960]  out of Wuhan. So they know this is all going on. And they know that it's all coming out.
[23:31.960 --> 23:44.000]  And so they desperately need a big victory to cast everyone in America as evil. All whites
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.760]  are evil. All capitalism is evil. America itself existing is bad. That's taught in the
[23:49.760 --> 23:55.440]  military now officially as a litmus test to identify who says no to it and fire them,
[23:55.440 --> 23:59.720]  whether they're the head of space force or whether they're a captain in the Army. It
[23:59.720 --> 24:06.720]  doesn't matter. So these are classical things authoritarian regimes do. And there's a checklist
[24:06.720 --> 24:14.120]  of one to 100. They're getting down to about checklist number 90. And the last 10 things
[24:14.120 --> 24:20.840]  or so they do lead us not into a tyranny because we're already in a tyranny with censorship,
[24:20.840 --> 24:25.760]  surveillance, control, harassment, peaceful people that just were waved in by police,
[24:25.760 --> 24:30.280]  held in solitary confinement, their eyeballs knocked out because they're white. I mean,
[24:30.280 --> 24:37.840]  we're already in a tyranny. But you see, it's about to get white hot, ladies and gentlemen,
[24:37.840 --> 24:43.080]  and they're going to try to legitimize their takeover, their cultural takeover, and commit
[24:43.080 --> 24:50.560]  massive false flag terror attacks that make Oklahoma City and Waco look tame in comparison.
[24:50.560 --> 24:54.760]  Because Waco as the feds went in to start a fight and start a shootout and then got their
[24:54.760 --> 24:58.640]  ass kicked and came back with the Army and had the Army burn everybody up and blow everybody
[24:58.640 --> 25:03.360]  up inside with the Delta Force. And then the ATF couldn't even kill those people themselves.
[25:03.360 --> 25:15.880]  I mean, what a joke. And so that's what they're going to do. That's how Hitler got into power
[25:15.880 --> 25:19.320]  was they firebombed the Capitol building. He had already been elected president, but
[25:19.320 --> 25:27.200]  he wasn't chancellor. And Hindenburg was about to die, February 27th, 1933. And so they firebombed
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.720]  the building. They found an autistic, mentally retarded man, Marinus Vanderloob, and they
[25:32.720 --> 25:39.000]  had a show trial for him and executed him very, very quickly and the rest is history.
[25:39.000 --> 25:45.560]  You know how the Nazis went into Russia, right? You know, they went into Poland, an Operation
[25:45.560 --> 25:55.320]  Himmler, an Operation Himmler, a subdirective of Operation Himmler. They attacked their
[25:55.320 --> 26:00.240]  own radio station and even dressed up some concentration camp workers like German and
[26:00.240 --> 26:05.440]  Polish soldiers. So it looked real. They didn't use mannequins. They shot them up, shot newsreels
[26:05.440 --> 26:13.560]  of it. And that's how World War II really went into high gear with the invasion of Poland.
[26:13.560 --> 26:17.240]  So this stuff's done over and over again. I know the names of the feds that planted
[26:17.240 --> 26:20.840]  the bombs. I know the witnesses that saw it. I know the cops that got killed. I've interviewed
[26:20.840 --> 26:25.960]  their wives, their daughters. I've interviewed Don Browning, the head of the K9 unit. He
[26:25.960 --> 26:29.840]  listed the FBI agents. He was the second cop to get to Oklahoma City, like five minutes
[26:29.840 --> 26:33.680]  after it happened. Terrence Yeke got there right away. And the feds came into his office
[26:33.680 --> 26:37.240]  and they said, we're going to kill you if you keep telling people there were bombs in
[26:37.240 --> 26:41.440]  that building. And he didn't shut up. So next they came back a month later. He named
[26:41.440 --> 26:46.760]  them on my show Marine Corps Veteran of Vietnam. And he named the FBI guys. And they came back
[26:46.760 --> 26:52.040]  in and they said, we're going to kill your wife too. So he didn't shut up. By the way,
[26:52.040 --> 26:56.920]  he said you better get out of my office. But I mean, America's got to stop being intimidated
[26:56.920 --> 27:05.440]  by this and stop being so scared. People better start being scared of God. So the last thing
[27:05.440 --> 27:12.080]  I want is any type of violence. Okay, that's what they want. But we have a compromised
[27:12.080 --> 27:16.120]  criminal government at the top totally run by foreign banks that has sold the country
[27:16.120 --> 27:21.760]  out who want to get rid of the nation itself and fold us into a world government. And so
[27:21.760 --> 27:26.160]  they are preparing false flags. They say the terror attacks are coming. They stand again
[27:26.160 --> 27:31.160]  and they ran the January 6th operation. That's what we'll go to when Tucker Carlson next
[27:31.160 --> 27:36.720]  to this incredible Revolver report that is at Revolver's website. And obviously Tucker
[27:36.720 --> 27:41.000]  Carlson covered last night and we have the Revolver investigative journalist joining
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.680]  us coming up in the second hour. So you do not want to miss any of this today. The decision
[27:46.680 --> 27:52.920]  to go through the whole thing, name the names, all of it straight ahead of exactly who they
[27:52.920 --> 27:59.360]  are and what they did and how they carried out the attack on the FBI.
[27:59.360 --> 28:04.160]  All the evil men in towers seem to flourish as the good men do nothing. Well, I'm trying
[28:04.160 --> 28:08.640]  to be a good man. I'm trying to stand up to the right thing. And I've seen huge effects
[28:08.640 --> 28:14.240]  with what we've done here in implores. Other good men and women getting together and telling
[28:14.240 --> 28:18.320]  the truth and standing up to corruption. But now the globals are coming after us. And so
[28:18.320 --> 28:22.080]  I need your prayers. I need your financial support. I need your word of mouth to stay
[28:22.080 --> 28:26.200]  in the fight. You've got a big sale going right now. Pre-shipping double patriot points

[29:59.760 --> 30:04.560]  taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the scientific
[30:04.560 --> 30:09.080]  literature is overwhelming. It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your
[30:09.080 --> 30:13.080]  well-being. A lot of folks take it before they take test. People that have arthritis
[30:13.080 --> 30:17.800]  pain, they take it. It's well known for the things it does for a body. It makes our lives
[30:17.800 --> 30:23.640]  so much better. Then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil. We've got
[30:23.640 --> 30:28.360]  both infowarstore.com, but with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down, so it's been
[30:28.360 --> 30:32.520]  months and months and months since we've had krill oil back in stock. But let's back,
[30:32.520 --> 30:36.280]  ladies and gentlemen. And despite the fact that it's already very fairly priced for the
[30:36.280 --> 30:43.000]  grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com

[30:55.200 --> 31:25.040]  as powerful as ours. This is the highest grade back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[31:25.200 --> 31:49.760]  Welcome back. I'm going to encapsulate things. I'm going to go to the Tucker Carlson report
[31:49.760 --> 31:57.200]  that really does an excellent job of giving you full spectrum of what's unfolding.
[31:57.200 --> 32:03.040]  All over the world, powerful interests have been abusing the people, lying to the people,
[32:03.040 --> 32:08.640]  and engaging in massive fraud. And that fraud is coming to the surface, and so the answer
[32:08.640 --> 32:13.600]  by these entrenched bureaucracies and elites is to become more corrupt and more abusive
[32:13.600 --> 32:21.200]  and to go back to old-fashioned tyranny. But when you do that with certain populations,
[32:21.200 --> 32:26.240]  like you see in Mexico, or people in the United States that have histories of rebellion,
[32:26.240 --> 32:34.480]  it will cause a long-protected civil war and basically what you would call a failed nation
[32:34.480 --> 32:40.600]  state model. And under globalism, they want the United States to be a failed nation state,
[32:40.600 --> 32:47.560]  and to be absorbed into NATO. And you'll have China on one side, NATO, and the globalist
[32:47.560 --> 32:54.880]  system, and then Russia is to be taken down as well and absorbed into NATO. But any group
[32:54.880 --> 32:58.240]  that is sovereign and not part of the globalist system is to be gotten rid of. So that's why
[32:58.240 --> 33:04.600]  you see this project of demonizing America, demonizing veterans, demonizing gun owners.
[33:04.600 --> 33:07.960]  It's outrageous. It says the country's evil and shouldn't exist. They're the bad guys
[33:07.960 --> 33:14.440]  that run the Justice Department and that run the FBI now are just hideously evil. And we
[33:14.440 --> 33:20.000]  have a nation of yes men that just have gone along with this, and so now they are prepping
[33:20.000 --> 33:28.040]  everyone for massive terror attacks. They are preparing the public for that, and they are
[33:28.040 --> 33:32.320]  going to go ahead with it. Clearly, it's their only move, or they're going to be exposed
[33:32.320 --> 33:37.520]  for election fraud, and their system's going to come hurtling down. So this country is
[33:37.520 --> 33:43.480]  in a crisis. It's on its last legs, and I'm very, very sad for this nation. You know,
[33:43.480 --> 33:46.920]  I'll tell you, if the globalists weren't pedophiles and devil worshipers, I would just
[33:46.920 --> 33:52.440]  leave the country. If they were just corrupt and looting it for fun. I have to stand against
[33:52.440 --> 33:56.080]  them. I have to not back down. I will not evacuate. I've made the strong decision that
[33:56.080 --> 34:00.360]  I'm going to go all the way against them and just turn loose everything I've got in information,
[34:00.360 --> 34:05.080]  warfare, and truth, and prayer, because I will not be a coward in front of God. But I
[34:05.080 --> 34:08.760]  will tell you something, all the fools that are going along with this, you're destroying
[34:08.760 --> 34:13.080]  yourself in the process. But I know you can't help it. It's why you're evil, because you're
[34:13.080 --> 34:18.640]  weak. I get it. And so this is the good old fashioned, good versus evil, and everybody
[34:18.640 --> 34:22.880]  that's going to try to sit on the fence, you're going to find out that's the worst place
[34:22.880 --> 34:27.040]  to be. So I commit myself into God's hands, and all that used to be doing that as well,
[34:27.040 --> 34:34.720]  because this country is in deep trouble. We've got terminal cancer, and we can come out of
[34:34.720 --> 34:39.480]  the ashes if we had a revival, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. So human
[34:39.480 --> 34:44.360]  animal cloning, just total nightmares everywhere, the stuff coming out now in the schools, I
[34:44.360 --> 34:49.000]  can't even believe it, where they are bullying children to say they're another gender and
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.040]  then taking the children away from the parents all over the country. I mean, we are just
[34:53.040 --> 34:59.960]  entering hell. We are entering hell. So the first part, Tucker Carlson gets into how they're
[34:59.960 --> 35:04.000]  trying to create racial division, how they're covering up black on white crime, and then
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.240]  he gets into why that happened, and then he fingers the FBI with the documents for actually
[35:08.240 --> 35:13.280]  leading the attack on January 6, which they did. Special units, control of the deep state,
[35:13.280 --> 35:19.160]  the same ones that did Oklahoma study, literally, the same ones that illegally spied on Trump,
[35:19.160 --> 35:25.160]  that criminal group working with intelligence agencies, SQ, around the operation. Here it
[35:25.160 --> 35:29.160]  is.
[35:29.160 --> 35:34.120]  This weekend, police in Columbus, Georgia, arrested a 35-9-year-old man called Justin
[35:34.120 --> 35:39.920]  Tyren Roberts. Over the course of a single day, Roberts shot five separate people in
[35:39.920 --> 35:44.200]  two different states. We know this happened because Roberts has admitted he did it. He
[35:44.200 --> 35:48.480]  also said why he did it. In his confession, police say Roberts, quote, explained that
[35:48.480 --> 35:53.200]  throughout his life, specifically white males had taken from him, so he decided to kill
[35:53.200 --> 35:57.960]  them. In one case, Roberts walked up behind a white man, a total stranger as he was getting
[35:57.960 --> 36:02.880]  out of his car, and shot him in the back. By any definition, these were crimes of viciousness
[36:02.880 --> 36:07.240]  motivated by race hate. They're not unique in this country, not by a long shot. If we
[36:07.240 --> 36:12.120]  wanted to, and we don't want to, we could do a whole show on crimes like these. Nor
[36:12.120 --> 36:15.920]  are they especially surprising, really, when you think about it. If you really believed
[36:15.920 --> 36:20.080]  what the Democratic Party and BLM were telling you, that white males are intentionally destroying
[36:20.080 --> 36:25.000]  the world, you might be motivated to hurt someone. Why wouldn't you? What's striking
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.680]  is how little attention Justin Tyron Roberts's shooting spree has received. Imagine if the
[36:29.680 --> 36:33.360]  colors were reversed here. Roberts will be leading every newscast tonight. Needless to
[36:33.360 --> 36:37.240]  say, he is not. In fact, this may be the last time you hear his name on television.
[36:37.240 --> 36:42.000]  Okay, let's hit pause right there for a moment. Because, oh, guess what? Just to back up what
[36:42.000 --> 36:48.920]  Tucker's saying, look what came out today, ABC News. 17-year-old suspect arrested in Austin
[36:48.920 --> 36:56.720]  mass shooting that left one dead, 13 injured. Well, guess what? He was black, 17 years
[36:56.720 --> 37:00.800]  all along with his accomplice. And so the statesman said, we will not show the race
[37:00.800 --> 37:06.640]  because it perpetuates stereotypes. And they would not say the description. And either
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.440]  would do the other local news except for Fox. So that's the control where you don't show
[37:11.440 --> 37:18.600]  a suspect when he's at large, if he's the wrong color. There you go. And I've got a
[37:18.600 --> 37:24.480]  bunch more examples. So my point is this doesn't fit with, oh, there's white supremacist killing
[37:24.480 --> 37:29.120]  people everywhere. So the media like lap dogs all over the country won't tell you, oh, by
[37:29.120 --> 37:35.320]  the way, I've got five more articles I wasn't even looking for of black on white crime.
[37:35.320 --> 37:41.360]  But it's just a little footnote. Just cold-blooded executions because the media said that the
[37:41.360 --> 37:46.440]  whites of this army of devils killing everyone and some young black folks didn't believe
[37:46.440 --> 37:51.240]  it's the right thing to do. And that's the FBI and the media and all of it pushing that
[37:51.240 --> 37:56.160]  narrative to get white people killed because that's going to be their new war, holding
[37:56.160 --> 38:00.160]  white people hostage by turning a race war loose on them. That if you don't come with
[38:00.160 --> 38:05.840]  your hat in your hand to Joe Biden, he'll turn these groups loose on you. Remember, if you
[38:05.840 --> 38:10.040]  don't vote for Joe Biden, you ain't black. He owns you. And he's telling white people
[38:10.040 --> 38:12.800]  he owns you too. Let's continue with Tucker Carlson.
[38:12.800 --> 38:18.440]  At this level, honestly, that is fine with us. Picking at the wound, America's wound,
[38:18.440 --> 38:23.720]  is unwise. We've always thought that we think it more now than ever. A multiracial country
[38:23.720 --> 38:30.560]  can only survive if it self-consciously de-emphasizes race, if it treats every person as an individual
[38:30.560 --> 38:35.160]  and not a member of some larger group that's guilty or innocent. So that should be the
[38:35.160 --> 38:39.880]  goal that's our history, and we ought to get back to it as soon as we can. But that is
[38:39.880 --> 38:44.680]  exactly the opposite of what our leaders are doing. They're working hard to divide us into
[38:44.680 --> 38:49.360]  warring camps and they're using lies to do it. They're telling us a story that is completely
[38:49.360 --> 38:54.120]  and very much intentionally disconnected from reality. They're claiming that something called
[38:54.120 --> 38:59.040]  white supremacy, and that's a term they never define, is the single greatest threat we face,
[38:59.040 --> 39:05.120]  a greater threat than al-Qaeda or ISIS. Here's our thoroughly craven Attorney General telling
[39:05.120 --> 39:11.560]  us that very lie today. In the FBI's view, the top domestic violent
[39:11.560 --> 39:17.760]  extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically
[39:17.760 --> 39:23.640]  those who advocated for the superiority of the white race. All right, that's the Attorney
[39:23.640 --> 39:28.640]  General of the United States making a statement of fact backed up by the FBI. So it's fair
[39:28.640 --> 39:32.880]  to ask obvious questions. Who exactly are these violent white supremacists? What are
[39:32.880 --> 39:39.080]  their names? What crimes under the U.S. Code have they committed? We still don't know.
[39:39.080 --> 39:43.000]  Merrick Garland didn't tell us today. Instead, he spent most of his time talking about the
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.760]  riot at the Capitol on January 6th, an event that had nothing whatsoever to do with race.
[39:48.760 --> 39:52.320]  All right, let's stop there. We're going to come back. It's really powerful and then
[39:52.320 --> 39:56.080]  he exposes who's really behind at the FBI. And we have that investigative journalist
[39:56.080 --> 40:00.600]  coming on for a whole hour to go through the names, the background, the documents, everything.
[40:00.600 --> 40:05.720]  But understand, I've got the new counterterrorism report, the new policy of the quote U.S. government
[40:05.720 --> 40:11.640]  that's run by these CHICOM agents that now control our FBI. And they tell us the main
[40:11.640 --> 40:18.640]  threat of the entire posture of the CIA, the U.S. military, the Navy SEALs, the Army, everybody
[40:18.640 --> 40:24.200]  is white people, which are the gun owners and Republicans. So it's literally the government
[40:24.200 --> 40:30.400]  declaring war on Trump voters. And saying everything we always were concerned about
[40:30.400 --> 40:34.760]  police states, CIA, secret arrests. They said they're going to arrest members of Congress.
[40:34.760 --> 40:37.640]  They said they're going to kill them. They said we're going to interdict these terror
[40:37.640 --> 40:43.640]  networks run by the Congress. I mean, there, look, look, you don't say that unless you're
[40:43.640 --> 40:49.200]  planning to kill the Republican leadership. And I believe that they're going to actually
[40:49.200 --> 40:52.600]  make a move and that they're going to try to kill myself, Tucker Carlson, Republican
[40:52.600 --> 40:58.480]  leadership, everybody else. And Tucker thinks that too, by the way, with the red light.

[45:18.800 --> 45:23.600]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I just saw John Harmon who's been here 18 years.
[45:23.600 --> 45:28.880]  George Regisian before. He's been here I guess about five. But he's the longest serving guy
[45:28.880 --> 45:34.960]  at InfoWars. And he said, man, you've been set in the stage for this. For 25 years saying this
[45:34.960 --> 45:39.040]  was coming. And I said, no, I've been watching them build the stage. And now they finally are
[45:39.040 --> 45:43.280]  putting America's head in the guillotine. And they're holing up that big blade right now and
[45:43.280 --> 45:48.000]  getting ready to pull the switch. And man, they look scared too. When you look at the attorney
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.600]  general and the FBI director and all them, they look really scared because, I mean,
[45:51.600 --> 45:57.680]  they're gutting America. I mean, they are. They're shipping in kidnapped kids out of Latin America.
[45:57.680 --> 46:02.560]  They're committing massive crimes. They're bankrupting the nation. I mean, they are just
[46:02.560 --> 46:10.000]  involved in hardcore crime. They're breaking records right now for American crime. Stalin,
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.760]  Hitler, Mao, they killed a lot more people than these guys have. But they're definitely doing it.
[46:13.760 --> 46:22.000]  And they're all a bunch of jerk lawyers now playing psycho general. So we're in a lot of
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.840]  danger, ladies and gentlemen, a lot of danger. People say, well, then why the hell are you
[46:25.840 --> 46:32.000]  fighting them? I'm not doing it as a, this is at macho. I understand that there's no way out of
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.160]  this except staying no to these people. And it's a great opportunity to actually be able to stand
[46:36.160 --> 46:42.080]  up against evil folks. So what can you do? Take this hour today, once it's archived in the next
[46:42.080 --> 46:46.480]  hour and share it. And you've been doing a great job at that and buy some of the products to keep
[46:46.480 --> 46:53.040]  us on air strong. We have the three new multivitamin pack with the vitamin D three with the whole
[46:53.040 --> 47:00.480]  food multivitamin of the highest quality. And of course, we have the vitamin C with the zinc

[47:04.400 --> 47:09.920]  than with those. They're 40% off that sale ends on Sunday and the free shipping is still on those
[47:09.920 --> 47:17.280]  select items with double patriot points. That ends Sunday because we don't even have the supplies
[47:17.280 --> 47:21.840]  be able to keep the sale going. The new sale that will go for at least two weeks. And again,
[47:21.840 --> 47:24.960]  because people are habituated to only buy ourselves on sales. So these are real sales.
[47:25.760 --> 47:30.400]  We don't like have the price high and then lower just to do that. It's just so it hurts us because
[47:30.400 --> 47:34.560]  it's hard to fund the operation. I'm not complaining except now we're having supply chain
[47:34.560 --> 47:39.120]  problems. So it's hard to even get enough product to sell so that we can stay on air. So please
[47:39.120 --> 47:43.840]  support us today. Get a book, get a t-shirt, get a film while you're also at info or store.com
[47:43.840 --> 47:48.000]  and help keep us on the air because you are just as effective and important as I am or anybody else
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.280]  in this operation when you keep us on air. We have the bio tricillinium. We have the krill oil
[47:53.280 --> 48:01.280]  and we have the X three 40 to 60% off on those. That is the new sale as well. And if you haven't
[48:01.280 --> 48:05.360]  experienced the power of triide on an X three or the power of krill oil or the power of bio
[48:05.360 --> 48:10.480]  tricillinium, you really deserve to do it today. This stuff is not a game. It's not a joke. This
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.360]  is all the key stuff that really supercharges. All right. Next hour, the revolver investigative
[48:15.360 --> 48:21.600]  journalist is on to dig through all this, the huge news that the feds led the operation. And now
[48:21.600 --> 48:25.600]  we've had time to put all the pieces together and to witness it. And I've got my own revelations
[48:25.600 --> 48:30.160]  as an eye witness to all of this coming up in the next hour. But here's more of Tucker Carlson
[48:30.160 --> 48:36.400]  last night. He like most people you see on television wants you to believe and wants history
[48:36.400 --> 48:42.800]  to record that January six was an attempted insurrection by white supremacist revolutionaries
[48:42.800 --> 48:49.120]  bent on taking over this country. We came this close, Merrick Garland said. And that's why quote,
[48:49.120 --> 48:54.000]  we must adopt a broader societal response to tackle the problems deeper roots.
[48:54.000 --> 48:59.440]  So because of January six says the chief law enforcement officer in the United States of
[48:59.440 --> 49:03.600]  America and many other members of Joe Biden's cabinet, we must now use law enforcement and
[49:03.600 --> 49:09.840]  military force to arrest, imprison and otherwise crush anyone who leads opposition to Joe Biden's
[49:09.840 --> 49:16.400]  government. That's their position. They say that out loud. They did today. So what is this exactly?
[49:16.400 --> 49:22.000]  Well, it's a big change in the way the United States government assesses and then treats its
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.600]  own citizens. We are living through the transformation of a formerly democratic republic into something
[49:27.600 --> 49:32.560]  else. We're looking at growing authoritarianism. That's not an overstatement. Vladimir Putin knows
[49:32.560 --> 49:38.000]  authoritarian systems very well. And he sees clearly what is happening in this country. Watch this.
[49:38.880 --> 49:47.040]  Did you order Alexi Navalny's assassination? Of course not. We don't have this kind of habit
[49:47.040 --> 49:54.880]  of assassinating anybody. That's one. Number two is I want to ask you, did you order the
[49:54.880 --> 49:59.920]  assassination of the woman who walked into the Congress and who was shot and killed by a policeman?
[49:59.920 --> 50:05.760]  Do you know that 450 individuals were arrested after entering the Congress and they didn't go
[50:05.760 --> 50:13.680]  there to steal a laptop. They came with political demands. Okay. So yeah, we just played tape of
[50:13.680 --> 50:18.640]  Vladimir Putin. Now under normal circumstances, we would never play tape of a foreign adversary
[50:18.640 --> 50:25.920]  criticizing our government. But honestly, those are fair questions. Who did shoot Ashley Babbitt?
[50:25.920 --> 50:31.520]  And why don't we know? Are anonymous federal agents now allowed to kill unarmed women who
[50:31.520 --> 50:37.200]  protest the regime? That's okay now? No, it's not okay. It'll never be okay. And why are all those
[50:37.200 --> 50:42.320]  January six protesters still in prison on trespassing charges as so many Biden voters
[50:42.320 --> 50:47.920]  who torch federal buildings walking free? What's the answer to that question? If all of that was
[50:47.920 --> 50:51.920]  going on in Russia, we would rightly call it scary. We would call Putin a dictator. In fact,
[50:51.920 --> 50:58.400]  we do call him a dictator. And speaking of January six, why are there still so many things, basic
[50:58.400 --> 51:04.560]  factual matters that we don't understand about that day? Why is the Biden administration preventing
[51:04.560 --> 51:09.600]  us from knowing? Why is the administration still hiding more than 10,000 hours of surveillance
[51:09.600 --> 51:13.840]  tape from the U.S. Capitol in January six? What could possibly be the reason for that?
[51:13.840 --> 51:18.080]  Even as they call for more openness, we need to get to the bottom of it. They could release those
[51:18.080 --> 51:25.120]  tapes today, but they're not. Why? We ought to be asking those questions urgently, because as the
[51:25.120 --> 51:30.640]  Attorney General reminded us today, a lot depends on the answers. And at least one news organization
[51:30.640 --> 51:36.160]  is asking that revolver news. It's a new site. It turned out to be one of the last honest outlets
[51:36.160 --> 51:41.680]  on the Internet. A new piece on revolver.news suggests an answer to some of these questions.
[51:42.320 --> 51:46.720]  We know that the government is hiding the identity of many law enforcement officers who are present
[51:46.720 --> 51:51.680]  at the Capitol on January six, not just the one who killed Ashley Babin. According to the government's
[51:51.680 --> 51:58.080]  own court filings, those law enforcement officers participated in the riot, sometimes in violent
[51:58.080 --> 52:02.720]  ways. We know that because without fail, the government has thrown the book at most people
[52:02.720 --> 52:07.120]  who are present in the Capitol on January six. There was a nationwide dragnet to find them,
[52:07.120 --> 52:12.080]  and many of them are still in solitary confinement tonight. But strangely, some of the key people
[52:12.080 --> 52:18.160]  who participated on January six have not been charged. Look at the documents. The government
[52:18.160 --> 52:23.040]  calls those people unindicted co-conspirators. What does that mean? Well, it means that potentially
[52:23.040 --> 52:30.160]  every single case, they were FBI operatives really in the Capitol on January six. For example,
[52:30.160 --> 52:34.320]  one of those unindicted co-conspirators is someone government documents identify only
[52:34.320 --> 52:39.680]  as person two. According to those documents, person two stayed in the same hotel room as
[52:39.680 --> 52:44.240]  a man called Thomas Caldwell, an insurrectionist, a man alleged to be a member of the group,
[52:44.240 --> 52:49.840]  the Oath Keepers. Person two also, quote, stormed the barricades at the Capitol on January six
[52:49.840 --> 52:54.080]  alongside Thomas Caldwell. The government's indictments further indicate that Caldwell,
[52:54.080 --> 52:59.520]  who by the way is the 65 year old man, is dangerous insurrectionist, was led to believe
[52:59.520 --> 53:06.160]  there would be a quote quick reaction force also participating on January six. That quick reaction
[53:06.160 --> 53:11.760]  force, Caldwell was told, would be led by someone called person three, who had a hotel room and
[53:11.760 --> 53:18.560]  an accomplice with him. But wait, here's the interesting thing. Person two and person three
[53:18.560 --> 53:24.880]  were organizers of the riot. The government knows who they are, but the government has not charged
[53:24.880 --> 53:34.800]  them. Why is that? You know why they were almost certainly working for the FBI. So FBI operatives
[53:34.800 --> 53:41.120]  were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January six, according to government documents.
[53:42.320 --> 53:47.920]  And those two are not alone. In all revolver news reported there are quote upwards of 20
[53:47.920 --> 53:52.720]  unindicted co-conspirators in the Oath Keeper indictments, all playing various roles in the
[53:52.720 --> 53:58.160]  conspiracy who have not been charged for virtually the exact same activities and in some cases
[53:58.160 --> 54:03.120]  much, much more severe activities as those named alongside them in the indictments.
[54:04.560 --> 54:11.120]  Huh? So it turns out that this white supremacist insurrection was again by the government's
[54:11.120 --> 54:15.600]  own admission in these documents organized at least in part by government agents.
[54:15.600 --> 54:21.360]  Are you shocked? We're shocked. We shouldn't be shocked because in March the FBI director admitted
[54:21.360 --> 54:25.360]  that the Bureau is infiltrating as many dissenting groups that oppose the regime as it possibly
[54:25.360 --> 54:30.960]  can. All right, folks, let me explain this. I know you already know this. They knew that there
[54:30.960 --> 54:35.200]  was a million people there were coming. They knew that it was exposing the election fraud. They knew
[54:35.200 --> 54:39.200]  there was about to be a 10 day investigation. And so they infiltrated it. They had weeks to do it.
[54:39.200 --> 54:46.240]  They provocateur it. And they got a couple hundred extra fools to follow them in who they now put
[54:46.240 --> 54:52.800]  under the jail while the actual controllers go free. And that's just the Oath Keeper indictments.
[54:52.800 --> 54:57.920]  It's in the Proud Boys. It's in all the other indictments that are out there. The same thing.
[54:57.920 --> 55:03.040]  These other persons, unindicted co-conspirators, unindicted. And one of them was an FBI agent,
[55:03.040 --> 55:07.920]  60 something years old. So they dropped the charges on him. Active duty FBI agent about
[55:07.920 --> 55:14.480]  to retire. So total setup. And I've gone back and looked at all things that happened at the time.
[55:14.480 --> 55:20.960]  And I saw how they were trying to set me up. And it's just really, really despicable how they did
[55:20.960 --> 55:24.480]  this. And they're going to be brought to justice. They're not going to get away with this. They're
[55:24.480 --> 55:28.640]  not going to get away with the next false flag. We are watching everything they're doing. You're
[55:28.640 --> 55:33.120]  watching what they're doing. And we're still on air. And so these globalist traders, these
[55:33.120 --> 55:37.360]  enemies that want to stage events so they can have an excuse to try to crush their opposition
[55:37.360 --> 55:41.840]  are going to fail. Say a prayer for justice. Say a prayer for awakening. Say a prayer against
[55:41.840 --> 55:46.640]  racial division and come together and defend the republic. Stay with us. Hour number two, straight ahead.

[58:03.200 --> 58:17.840]  All right, Darren Beatty, the big reporter over at revolver blowing it wide open with this giant
[58:17.840 --> 58:24.240]  Michigan report joins us next segment. The FBI has a long history of staging almost every major
[58:24.240 --> 58:29.120]  event provocaturing the organizations and groups to do it. We'll be talking to him coming up here
[58:29.120 --> 58:36.240]  in just a moment. But after he leaves us, there is even bigger news coming out in major medical
[58:36.240 --> 58:41.040]  journals, major scientists that it's causing massive heart attacks, these so called COVID-19
[58:41.040 --> 58:45.520]  vaccines. So we're going to be hitting on that in the third hour. And we have that Fox News
[58:45.520 --> 58:50.720]  reporter that was blowing the whistle on them being ordered to cover up COVID damage, because
[58:50.720 --> 58:55.360]  they quote get paid big money by big pharma. That's coming up to with a whistleblower with
[58:55.360 --> 59:00.960]  Project Veritas third hour. But first, let's go to part of this report from the great regression.
[59:07.920 --> 59:13.840]  The first autopsy conducted on a person who received the new experimental COVID jab
[59:13.840 --> 59:20.640]  confirms what we are being told by experts worldwide. The so called cure is far worse
[59:20.640 --> 59:27.120]  than the disease. According to the post mortem report, the 86 year old man had never had COVID
[59:27.760 --> 59:34.640]  and received a single dose of the Pfizer shot on January 9th. 18 days later, he was admitted to
[59:34.640 --> 59:41.840]  the hospital where he got infected by an asymptomatic hospital roommate and died four days later.
[59:41.840 --> 59:48.160]  The molecular mapping shows that nearly all of his vital organs were infected with viral RNA.
[59:48.160 --> 59:56.000]  As a result of being exposed to his asymptomatic roommate, a rapid fatal autoimmune response
[59:56.000 --> 1:00:04.480]  was triggered throughout the body. People are being told to trust the science. But the science
[1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:11.920]  has been saying all along that these mRNA induced spike proteins being produced in the body is a
[1:00:11.920 --> 1:00:18.320]  terrible and deadly idea. A former Pfizer head and former head of the public health department
[1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:26.640]  tried to warn us back in December of 2020. Scores of medical experts from 30 countries
[1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:32.560]  came together just weeks after the vaccine went public to warn people of a wide range of side
[1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:39.200]  effects. They pointed out how care homes across the world were being infected with COVID-19
[1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:44.960]  within days of residents getting vaccinated. Their main concern was that the spike proteins
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:50.480]  will be produced throughout the entire body causing the body's own immune system to attack
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:56.400]  itself and pointed out how the entire thing is a human experiment in violation of the Nuremberg
[1:00:56.400 --> 1:01:04.400]  Code. French virologist and Nobel Prize winner Luc Montigny agrees he calls it an unacceptable
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:11.040]  mistake and went on to say that it is unthinkable that any expert would not be aware of how potentially
[1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:19.040]  dangerous this shot is. Even the corporations seem to know. The owner of an oil and gas recruitment
[1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:25.760]  company who hires for dozens of major companies says that succession planning is now looking at
[1:01:25.760 --> 1:01:32.800]  all employees who have received one of the new COVID vaccines. Succession planning is the strategy
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:41.440]  that ensures businesses continue to thrive after employees move on retire or die. She says that the
[1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:48.320]  entire oil and gas industry is planning on having to replace all personnel who received the vaccine
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:54.560]  within the next three years. To this day I am running a global gas and oil recruitment firm
[1:01:54.560 --> 1:02:02.400]  and the reason that this is important is because of what I am seeing as an executive in this
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:07.840]  industry happening right now as a result of the COVID vaccines and it's something called succession
[1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:13.360]  planning. Well what's really interesting what's happening right now and it's actually mortifying
[1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:22.880]  not just interesting is that executives are having their HR staff and their managers,
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:28.480]  superintendents, foremen, so on and so forth go through and look at the staff that have received
[1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:34.800]  the vaccines and they're planning to have to replace them all within the next three years.
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:42.240]  And through all of this the mainstream media never once questioned the big pharma puppet in
[1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:48.160]  charge with the criminal past. Throughout all of this the media told you to get the shot.

[1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:31.920]  the headline last night was incredible tucker curlton tonight fbi behind the january 6
[1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:38.240]  in the correction it's all coming up with the investigative journalist darin beatty who broke
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:44.400]  it in the major publication investigative publication revolver but here is a short excerpt
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:50.800]  of them preparing the new class war in america with the leftist captain america and all conservatives
[1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:59.200]  christians and gun owners capitalist as well as red skull fbi's view the top domestic violent
[1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:05.840]  extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists specifically those
[1:05:05.840 --> 1:05:10.640]  who advocate for the superiority of the white race according to the intelligence community
[1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:17.440]  terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today because
[1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:22.400]  of this growth in polarization in the united states and domestic violence in white supremacist
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:28.560]  groups so i know looking forward that the members of the the biden team who have been
[1:05:28.560 --> 1:05:34.800]  dominated or have been appointed are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much
[1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:39.920]  they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we've seen overseas
[1:05:39.920 --> 1:05:44.960]  the rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing national security threat
[1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:49.760]  the biden administration will confront this threat with the necessary resources and resolve in order
[1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:56.400]  to really tackle terrorism in this time domestically you've got to attack and dismantle the the
[1:05:56.400 --> 1:06:01.760]  command and control element of a terrorist group and unfortunately and i know this is painful to hear
[1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:07.840]  that may mean people sitting in congress right now people in and around the former president
[1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:14.720]  that's how you do this otherwise recruitment inciting and and uh cult-like leadership continues
[1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:21.040]  to recruit people to violence our initial work on dv will broadly fall into three areas the first
[1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:26.640]  is a tasking from president biden sent to the odini today requesting a comprehensive threat
[1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:34.160]  assessment coordinated with the fbi and dhs on domestic violent extremism you can be darn tootin
[1:06:34.160 --> 1:06:39.920]  and that we are focused very very hard on how can we get better sources better information
[1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:44.400]  better analysis so that we can make sure that something like what happened on january six
[1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:49.840]  never happened golly under some nice regular guy i'm not taking over and say we're gonna
[1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:55.760]  kill members of congress with the green berets golly gee darn tootin let me put on that goofy
[1:06:55.760 --> 1:07:00.800]  act i'm not threatening at all these guys are really dangerous national strategy for countering
[1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:04.560]  domestic terrorism and it says they're gonna work with private companies citizens and just
[1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:09.760]  there's a new war on white people which i mean is totally insane which is the racial attack
[1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:15.520]  itself they claim that white people are putting out it's led by a bunch of ivy league white people
[1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:22.240]  classic divide and conquer dr darin beatty is a really smart guy he is a former professor of
[1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:26.800]  political science for duke university who went on to serve in the white house as a speech writer
[1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:32.560]  and policy a to trump he is now founder of revolver dot news that is doing probably some of the best
[1:07:32.560 --> 1:07:38.080]  investigative journalism uh out there period even say he gives greenwald a big run for his money
[1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:43.440]  very very fair i would say nonpartisan scathing uh and i've been quite the expert just covering it
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:49.280]  for 27 years on false flag terror i cut my teeth on oklahoma city interviewed survivors police
[1:07:49.280 --> 1:07:54.000]  officers you name it that was a false flag it appears they're cooking up something even bigger

[1:08:52.480 --> 1:09:00.960]  on one six and as i say it's not just on behalf of ashleigh babbit who was shot in cold blood
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:08.000]  by somebody we still don't know it is not just for the hundreds of prisoners being detained
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:16.240]  and abused unjustly for their political beliefs and participating in a political protest it's
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:22.080]  actually bigger than that it's for the 70 plus million people who voted for trump or really
[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:29.440]  any american who dares challenge the corrupt ruling class because all of us you me everyone
[1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:34.800]  we've all been declared potential de facto domestic terrorists by our own government
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:42.320]  and as a means of promoting that narrative they seize upon a certain story of one six
[1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:47.840]  and to get to the bottom of that story to get to the truth of that story i think we need to
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:55.120]  ask the following simple question was this the result of an intelligence failure as christopher
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:10:02.400]  ray said oh they just didn't have any idea anything was going to happen and so there you go or was
[1:10:02.400 --> 1:10:12.000]  this a result of an intel setup or a counterintelligence setup and we can get to that by asking the
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:18.640]  following precise question of the three main groups the three main so-called militia groups
[1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:26.000]  most closely associated with one six at least in the government sides proud boys three percenters
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:32.480]  oath keepers to what extent were those three groups infiltrated by government agents
[1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:43.200]  up to and on one six and to put an even more fine point on the issue how many if any of the
[1:10:43.200 --> 1:10:50.320]  unindicted co-conspirators who enjoyed senior positions in these key militia groups remain
[1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:58.160]  unindicted on account of some prior relationship with the federal government these two questions
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:06.000]  these questions they create a thread and i believe alex we pull this thread the ugly truth about one
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:13.280]  six and about perhaps our entire country reveal itself and this is what this piece is doing and
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:18.960]  what i hope it will continue to do and i know in your piece you're mainly focusing on the build-up
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:23.200]  to the six what happened on the six and then since then and it's extremely powerful read the piece
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:30.400]  now three times but the bigger area is your knowledge that was very impressive to me we had
[1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:37.680]  him talk a few weeks ago off air about the the pedigree of the groups in this justice department
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:42.560]  that were holdovers who had done similar things before and i know that kind of puts the cart
[1:11:42.560 --> 1:11:46.960]  before the horse because then they'll you know bring up those issues instead of this current one
[1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:52.320]  up front but the past right here of these people at ruby ridge wake up oklahoma city
[1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:57.280]  and just everything they do the the pathology of them doing this over and over again plus
[1:11:57.280 --> 1:12:01.920]  the last 20 30 years the fbi behind almost every other major staged event be it white
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:05.920]  supremacist it was llamas the city these groups and i'm not saying there aren't some crazy militias
[1:12:05.920 --> 1:12:10.160]  or some crazy white supremacist or a lot of crazy muslims but then there's the fbi always
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:17.840]  holding their hand there this is a very well known phenomenon absolutely no you make a great
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:23.440]  point and that's why it's so excited to be on this show because as you said you cut your teeth on
[1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:29.040]  this precise narrative that the american people need to understand i think it's unfortunate
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:33.840]  that there's been so much distraction related to one six and i'm really glad that this revolver
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:40.720]  news piece has helped to clear that up in my view it's not about oh whether it was antifa this or
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:45.760]  that it's bigger than that don't ask whether it was antifa was it the federal government
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:51.680]  what did the antifa was there in a foundational level uh support role and have been tipped off
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:55.680]  that this was about to happen we have them on video jade next segment exactly that becomes a
[1:12:55.680 --> 1:13:04.240]  distraction because well yes and but this this gets into uh detail that maybe for for another
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:10.640]  report but just quickly on on the jade an issue what was what was he was he actually antifa was
[1:13:10.640 --> 1:13:16.720]  he himself some kind of operative or informant so i think we need to really be precise about
[1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:22.560]  what what we're saying and um really all roads lead to this question is what did the government know
[1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:27.840]  when did they know it was this a setup that is the key that it unlocks this and you can go all the
[1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:34.320]  way back to jade gerhoover every single incident like you were saying from you know waco ruby rich
[1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:38.080]  oklahoma city there are a lot of questions stay there we've got plenty of time let's get into that
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:42.640]  and i totally agree you're right jade next isn't really antifa he's whatever they need him to be
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:48.080]  and he actually brags about that and has that background with anderson cooper and these weird
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:53.440]  international journalists that are in conflict zones i would say cia we'll be right back stay with us

[1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:03.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:17.680]  all right folks we're back live with dr garen j beady and he of course is a revolver.news the
[1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:22.880]  founder of it a doctor of a professor of political science and of course he went to work at the
[1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:28.400]  white house with president trump as a researcher strategist speechwriter and he's here now
[1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:33.040]  quarterbacking at the resurgence of investigative journalism i want to explain something this
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:39.360]  revolver story and what they really did at the capital is the whole future of america one way
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:45.280]  or the other it's as big as the lujan lab why is that important because it's all the same globalist
[1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:50.800]  group using crises to take control and they are saying the whole posture of the u.s. military and
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:58.240]  the cia its main focus is not the middle east is not china is not even the russians it's now us
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:05.920]  and branding us all terrorists and and white supremacists to then start a war with us and
[1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:09.920]  to start false flags is the trigger for that the capital being the first so this is very
[1:18:09.920 --> 1:18:14.880]  historical anybody that studied history knows it repeats so obviously the professor understands
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:18.880]  that because he's researched it but so so when you know what you're doing when you've researched
[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:22.800]  this it's all crystal clear and they're even telling you what they're going to do in that montage
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:29.680]  earlier a doctor professor you saw us show just a small taste of them saying the new enemy is the
[1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:37.120]  american people a white supremacist is a capitalist a christian a conservative a someone that loves
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:42.640]  our country and so this is a great way for the democratic party to outlaw its opposition so
[1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:46.320]  we've got the rest of the hour we got a break coming up longer segments coming up but wherever
[1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:53.520]  you want to start back with jade next or january 6 or the fbi operatives inside or what you think
[1:18:53.520 --> 1:18:58.480]  is coming in the future because this story is the most important because it's the entire program
[1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:05.440]  this corrupt deep state is launched yes no i agree with all of that wholeheartedly and i'd like to
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:14.640]  say that investigative journalism is nothing if it's not attached to a narrative the investigative
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:22.080]  work is only important in so far as it's connected to an important narrative and the narrative here
[1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:29.840]  is crucial for everyone to understand january 6 it's not just about babbit it's not just about
[1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:37.360]  the people indicted it's about all of us because the biggest trend the most terrifying trend the most
[1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:44.560]  important trend in politics that revolver.news has covered in meticulous detail is that our national
[1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:51.920]  security apparatus in this country has been politically weaponized repurpose and redeployed
[1:19:51.920 --> 1:20:00.160]  domestically to silence suppress and destroy the energy associated with donald trump's victory in
[1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:07.440]  2016 it's as simple as that and the narrative for one sixth that the government has seized upon
[1:20:07.440 --> 1:20:16.160]  that the fake media has seized upon and so forth is entirely for that purpose to serve as a pretext
[1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:24.560]  to advance this new domestic war on terror this new patriot act which you know as opposed to the old
[1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:34.960]  patriot act which was horrible this new patriot act is tailor made to attack patriots and the left
[1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:40.480]  is we're talking hundreds of thousands of tweets a day just of my name saying arrest me kill me tear
[1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:47.280]  me apart about trump about ted cruz about josh holly anybody that says hey we should investigate
[1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:52.160]  election integrity some of the democrats always agree with before should be put in prison because
[1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:59.120]  we're terrorists and they have like army officers online saying alex jones is a terrorist and he's
[1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:03.360]  going to be taken out and twitter is allowing that and i'm not i'm not here bringing myself up
[1:21:03.360 --> 1:21:08.560]  because i want to be a victim it's crazy to watch organized calls for violence like this this is
[1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:16.080]  dangerous no it's it's absolutely the case and i think if your listeners can take home one thing
[1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:21.280]  first of all i encourage them go to revolver.news read the full report and i think you you have a
[1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:27.600]  great audience you have a very big audience and i'm calling upon them to help this story become
[1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:32.720]  the biggest story in the country it's it's it's got the momentum this piece deserves to be the
[1:21:32.720 --> 1:21:38.960]  biggest story for the sake of all of us because i said we deserve to know the truth about one six
[1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:44.320]  we need to keep in mind though the narrative the narrative is that the national security state has
[1:21:44.320 --> 1:21:49.920]  been weaponized against the american people here and frankly and i think you know this and you've
[1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:56.800]  known this for a long time all of politics in the united states is basically going to be fake
[1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:05.600]  and performative unless and until we keep our national security agencies under control and in
[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:13.040]  their proper place if we don't do that we don't have a country and that's what came out right
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:17.600]  before obama left or it was few years before he left about seven eight years ago they passed a
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:22.640]  federal law he also signed executive orders to turn the cia and other disinformation groups
[1:22:22.640 --> 1:22:26.880]  loose domestically which have been illegal previously well we have the washington post
[1:22:26.880 --> 1:22:32.000]  headlines propaganda legalized by obama that's what you're hitting at is it's these groups that
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:35.840]  are doing this that are then organizing the mainstream media to engage in this weaponization
[1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:42.320]  right absolutely and we need to bring the intelligence apparatus the national security
[1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:47.680]  apparatus to heal or we don't have a country and other than that frankly all the political
[1:22:47.680 --> 1:22:54.080]  discussions we have are fake performative distractions we're don't we're not going to
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:23:00.160]  have politics in this country in the real sense until we get that situation under control and
[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:05.760]  that is what i think is at stake in this one in this one six piece and so i'm happy to go into the
[1:23:05.760 --> 1:23:11.840]  details of it because i think it's a very important argument to follow please yeah let's start where
[1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:18.720]  do we begin where do we begin on six other than the details i just wanted to emphasize so why is
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:23.440]  this important why are these details important it's important for the reasons i described but the
[1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:29.520]  details themselves are quite explosive now if somebody's hearing this for the first time saying
[1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:35.200]  well i think that's a little bit far-fetched the possibility that the government could have
[1:23:35.200 --> 1:23:40.720]  infiltrated these militia groups the possibility at the very least that they knew there was potential
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:45.920]  for violence and they didn't stop it and the even more disturbing possibility that it's not simply
[1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:51.920]  that they didn't stop it is that some of the key players were actually informants or undercover agents
[1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:58.800]  playing or instigating role that's that's too far for a lot of americans it's too dark for a lot of
[1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:05.120]  americans but as i was saying we don't need to go back to j. edger mover to prove this we just need
[1:24:05.120 --> 1:24:12.400]  to go back a few months before the so-called capital siege we just need to go back and look at what
[1:24:12.400 --> 1:24:19.360]  happened in michigan which is a very very curious coincidence here in a nutshell what happened in
[1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:26.400]  michigan there was a plot in michigan a so-called wittmer kidnapping plot that also involved
[1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:35.760]  coincidentally a plot to storm the michigan state capital this plot to storm the michigan state
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:44.880]  capital just coincidentally happened to involve the same militia that the government has now imputed
[1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:50.800]  to the one-sixth storming of the capital one of those militias called the three percenters the
[1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:58.480]  government claims that adam fox the so-called mastermind of this michigan plot was a leader of
[1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:06.160]  the three percenters so we have a same militia group the same style plot to storm a capital
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:16.400]  we have the fact why was it stopped well of the 18 plotters who are ultimately
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:27.360]  uh uh mentioned as part of this plan we now know that at least five were either undercover agents or
[1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:32.880]  informants and the fifth one came out in a very spectacular fashion by the way which we can get
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:36.800]  into later we're going to come right back to the side with this and how the judge has had to drop
[1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:41.520]  some of the people off there because they were set up same thing hatari militia the fed said with
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:46.080]  you and invades what do we do i guess we fight back to get indicted it's done over and over again
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:50.960]  we're going to talk about the huge revolver dot news report straight ahead i'm alex jones tell
[1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:57.120]  everybody you know tune in now and later take the archive of this interview and share it i'm a very
[1:25:57.120 --> 1:26:02.320]  humble person but i'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking
[1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:06.800]  humanity of all the terrible things that are unfolding i want you to know a lot of positive
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:12.720]  things are happening as well i'm a public figure so i get to see things zero public doesn't get to
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:18.800]  see and let me tell you whether it's police chiefs or members of congress or even folks in hollywood
[1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:24.560]  or or or mainstream media or industry people are really really away from the establishment
[1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:30.000]  they don't want to go along with the globalist but they're scared they're looking for leadership
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:35.520]  well that's where m4 comes in you fund us you support m4swore.com you get rape proxy at the

[1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:49.600]  division instead of class envy it's all racial division it's pure poison and it's extremely
[1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:54.800]  authoritarian i mean this is hitler level stuff but the name of fighting race you then obsess over
[1:30:54.800 --> 1:31:00.640]  race and create real racism real classism it's it's cyanide and it's in the wiki leaks you know

[1:32:58.480 --> 1:33:03.440]  so thanks for thinking about us and keeping us on air all right going back to dr darin j
[1:33:03.440 --> 1:33:09.520]  beady at revolver.news at darin j beady on twitter all right i got two more segments with you
[1:33:09.520 --> 1:33:14.560]  you've got the floor here anywhere you want to go with this what happened then before oklahoma
[1:33:14.560 --> 1:33:19.920]  city the fbis history of this uh what you think's coming up in the future how do we how does congress
[1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:24.960]  counter this i think you alluded to that uh we need to get on the offense with these senators
[1:33:24.960 --> 1:33:30.400]  and house members to call for hearings on this this is a real achilles heel for the system if we
[1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:34.640]  go on the offense instead of again arguing about what really happened we know what happened
[1:33:35.920 --> 1:33:40.000]  right okay i'd like to make three points first i'd like to complete the point about
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:46.560]  michigan because it really is striking so in a nutshell this michigan plot involved the plan
[1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:54.640]  to storm the state capital and involve the very same militia group imputed to 1 6 it was heavily
[1:33:54.640 --> 1:34:03.280]  infiltrated by federal operatives to a ratio of 5 and 18 and as a cherry on top the head of the
[1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:11.120]  detroit field office the detroit fbi field office who oversaw the infiltration of this so-called
[1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:20.800]  michigan plot christopher ray quietly mysteriously and suspiciously gave him a promotion just days
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:27.520]  after the people so-called plotters were arrested for the michigan case in october and he got a
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:35.520]  promotion to the dc field office where you guessed it he came to oversee the investigation into
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:40.640]  january 6 that's a hell of a coincidence wow and now they've been dying more three percenters so
[1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:45.360]  they're like literally going out and finding weak-minded people to manipulate right it's a
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:53.680]  hell of a coincidence and look that fact pattern alone of course doesn't say anything uh definitive
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:59.920]  about 1 6 but it sure as hell aids our intuition and anyone who thinks oh our government just
[1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:05.200]  doesn't do that you don't have to go back to jade gerhoover go months before with the michigan
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:14.480]  plot that was infiltrated and incited the same people the same groups the same plan and we see
[1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:21.120]  it again in 1 6 and as for the 1 6 just so people get a sense of how we set up the argument it's
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:28.480]  really quite simple the stated standard of prosecution for 1 6 cases by an individual
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:33.840]  named michael sherman who is a real sure one who's a real piece of work he says we're using a
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:40.000]  shock and awe standard of prosecutions that's the most aggressive standard imaginable he's
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:44.800]  alluding to the shock and awe campaign of the iraq war by the way and according to the shock
[1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:49.440]  and awe standard if you want to know what that looks like i would present the case of this poor
[1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:57.520]  fellow called george tanyos who's facing 60 years what is he facing 60 years for what what did he do
[1:35:57.520 --> 1:36:05.040]  well george tanyos had bear spray in his backpack his friend said i want to get the bear spray it's
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:13.520]  time to spray some people's spray some of the capital officers he said no no not yet on the basis
[1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:21.040]  of saying no no not yet he's charged with conspiracy to insult capital police officers and facing 60
[1:36:21.040 --> 1:36:27.120]  years and by the way as a side point the whole reason this bear spray was relevant was that you'll
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:33.760]  recall this officer sychnic who died originally they were saying he died because he was bludgeoned to
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:40.320]  death with a fire extinguisher by the maga mob then when that was exposed as false by revolver
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:45.280]  dot news by the way in new york times changed the narrative the second narrative that they
[1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:49.920]  seized upon was he died of bear spray so that's why it was relevant but it turns out it wasn't
[1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:55.520]  even that that sychnic died of natural causes so this bear spray isn't even relevant to the death
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:37:02.720]  of sychnic anyway but this guy tanyos for saying no no not yet when his friend reached his pack
[1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:08.880]  to grab the bear spray is facing 60 years i think that's a horrible standard that's unjust
[1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:12.640]  well they're setting the precedent to arrest whoever they want whenever they want in disappearance
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:20.960]  and that's precisely first of all that's outrageous but that is the crux of our argument here just
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:28.160]  say if they have such an aggressive shock and awe standard of prosecution for this poor sandwich
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:36.320]  shop owner george tanyos who said no not yet why is it that seems like senior people within
[1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:44.320]  militia groups remain unindicted it's very curious when you look at that double standard
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:50.720]  and i think one possible indeed compelling explanation for that standard is that some if not
[1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:56.720]  all of these major unindicted co-conspirators are unindicted to this point as a result of
[1:37:56.720 --> 1:38:02.240]  some prior agreement with the federal government either as an informant or maybe even an undercover
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:07.680]  agent and we know that that's exactly how the fbi does it the same way they would turn members
[1:38:07.680 --> 1:38:12.480]  of the taliban or al-qaeda quote against their leadership or or try to get leadership on their
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:18.080]  side that's the exact same thing we have a famous history of the fbi actually getting their people
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:24.160]  in as the heads of militias and the heads of white supremacist organizations like elaheem city uh
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:30.240]  with with oklahoma city that was run by the southern property law center that was run by the feds
[1:38:30.240 --> 1:38:37.680]  and literally no you're you're you're right about this and you know oklahoma city is of course an
[1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:44.880]  entirely separate can of worms but it might be time for the american people to reassess
[1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:49.680]  what actually happened there the thing about these events is they're so emotionally charged
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:58.320]  and one thing that you see is that the official narrative becomes sacred before it can be challenged
[1:38:58.320 --> 1:39:03.760]  that's one of the reasons i think it's so crucial that we make this revolver.news story the biggest
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:10.400]  story in the country because we're challenging this false narrative before it becomes sacred
[1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:16.480]  but what they try to do is they say okay people died it's horrible they use the emotional valence
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:22.400]  of an issue in order to solidify their false narrative of events i think that's what's happened in
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:28.480]  prior attacks i think you're a hundred percent right at a final long segment you coming up to
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:33.280]  get into where we go from here and other details because they're so scared of this story i want
[1:39:33.280 --> 1:39:37.920]  to explain to listeners again and the listeners get this this is their whole new threat posture
[1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:43.520]  is not china it's american people on the asinine claim that there's an army of white supremacists
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:48.000]  that are just gonna go and again they're branding trump supporters because they're so
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:51.520]  scared of that populist movement that was the opposite of white supremacism brought us all

[1:43:55.920 --> 1:44:19.200]  it in for our store.com today you're listening to the alex jones show you found it the tip of the
[1:44:19.200 --> 1:44:31.440]  speed the front lines in the war for american unity and a true future built on justice all right
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:39.440]  i want to have our guest have a rest of 10 and a half minute segment here to lay out other key
[1:44:39.440 --> 1:44:44.480]  points but but just if it staggers the mind to think about the people doing the staged event
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:53.040]  provocaturing the militia out in michigan is in the same guy brought in to basically run the
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:58.800]  operations of the cover up and the rest of it in dc i mean this is false flag city and then you get
[1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:03.680]  into garland and you get into holder before him and and the clinton's and their their history
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:09.440]  their penchant for doing this this is something authoritarians do the zars did it the kgb and the
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:14.800]  gru did it hitler it's in the murmur trials did a bunch of false flags to start world war two he
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:19.200]  didn't just go attack those countries he said pollin to attack them the operation hemler at
[1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:24.960]  gliwitz and other areas they staged mass shootings with with real people they killed uh from the
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:29.680]  concentration camps so this is something goes on in politics this is something that's in history
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:34.320]  books it's something our fbi has a long history of doing so we should be looking at it then their
[1:45:34.320 --> 1:45:38.160]  fingerprints are all over to notice they didn't want a real hearing they didn't want a real commission
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:42.480]  at the end uh because they don't want a real investigation of this so i think we do need
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:47.040]  a major investigation a public investigation i want to say tucker carlson has a lot of courage
[1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:52.480]  dr bd has a lot of courage because uh the system comes after you when you do this but we need to
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:58.320]  get more americans out front exposing this because i cannot stress enough to listeners just as he's
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:04.160]  done five times i've probably done 10 times the last 45 minutes this is the big enchilada this
[1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:09.360]  is the this is the sweet spot this is their whole political plan to brand all their opposition
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:13.760]  and and make america great again nazi so if you don't want to be branded as a nazi you're like
[1:46:13.760 --> 1:46:17.200]  well they don't they won't get away with this they're getting ready to stage more stuff folks
[1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:22.480]  that's obvious you can look at this okay so i'm gonna stop ranting dr uh go ahead and make any
[1:46:22.480 --> 1:46:28.800]  other two points a couple things i want to say and this is why the narrative is so important this
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:35.600]  is why the dominant and overriding really singular question that matters right now in relation to
[1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:44.160]  one six was it an intelligence failure like the fbi director says or was it an intelligence setup
[1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:52.400]  like this revolver dot news story suggests now i want to make a point about political psychology
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:58.320]  of the left and the right it's actually remarkable that a lot of the literature on the left on one
[1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:04.640]  six they actually think well a lot of these people these unindicted people aren't being
[1:47:05.520 --> 1:47:13.200]  indicted because the government is secretly right wing and protecting them the left psychology
[1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:22.000]  is so attached to this idea of challenge that the leftist challenge corrupt institutions of
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:27.600]  authority that they can't even conceive of what's really going on here and that actually it's the
[1:47:27.600 --> 1:47:34.960]  government on their side in this case there's an analogous problem on the right a lot of people on
[1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:41.280]  the right spinning wheels now with narratives that get close to the truth but don't quite get there
[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:47.360]  this stuff oh this was antifa this was this this was that they can't quite seize upon the real
[1:47:47.360 --> 1:47:53.440]  question is this an intelligence setup because people on the right generally speaking have a
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:48:00.640]  political psychology that instead of challenging corrupt institutions of power they want to venerate
[1:48:00.640 --> 1:48:07.760]  just and well-functioning institutions look at our q fetishized fetishized the fbi when q's run
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:15.360]  the fbi exactly so i think there's a special difficulty on the right to reorient ourselves
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:22.560]  to this new reality in which we need to learn how to challenge corrupt institutions of power
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:28.640]  including and especially our national security apparatus on that point i'd like to give credit
[1:48:28.640 --> 1:48:34.320]  to politicians who are actually doing something on this first i'd like to give credit to the great
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:41.280]  representative arizona paul gozar who entered this revolver dot news report into the congressional
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:49.280]  record demanded answers representative matt gates great representative he just issued a letter asking
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:54.720]  precisely those questions stated in the revolver dot news report so i encourage all of your listeners
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:02.320]  demand that your congressman sign up to this letter and don't stop pressing until christopher
[1:49:02.320 --> 1:49:08.000]  ray gives his answers that's right now is the time he's got to get this out to everybody we've got a
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:12.160]  call congress you got to flood everybody with this article with this story from revolver dot news
[1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:19.200]  and what and generally and finally what we need is not just pressing for the answers on one six
[1:49:19.200 --> 1:49:26.560]  what we need on the left on the right we need a new church committee we need a church committee
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:34.080]  2.0 because look as i said at the beginning if we don't bring our national security apparatus to
[1:49:34.080 --> 1:49:41.440]  heal if we don't remind them of their proper place we do not have a free country period well
[1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:45.520]  that's right a doctor as you know this because you've got a doctorate this but for people that
[1:49:45.520 --> 1:49:49.360]  don't know explain to them i'm sure most listeners get it they see it but for some that don't maybe
[1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:53.920]  the left that doesn't or some of the right wingers that fetishize the military and intelligence agencies
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:58.960]  historically i mean this is exactly the type of stuff that's happened other places
[1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:04.560]  that went down the rabbit hole of tyranny i mean this is very classical tyranny that's
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:09.920]  unfolding here and we know what we're looking at this is the intelligence agencies the petorian guard
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:16.000]  are taking over and using outside threats that they're creating or allowing to happen
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:22.960]  to take over this is a classic move they're making exactly and i think the only way to stop that
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:30.640]  is to not be distracted by fake and performative politics we need to keep our eyes on the prize
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:38.320]  we need to focus we need to target national security apparatus we need to bring them to heal
[1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:46.640]  because if they don't restore themselves to the proper function within a free society
[1:50:47.200 --> 1:50:53.200]  we will go down that road to tyranny like what you're saying and it's crucial that we do that and
[1:50:53.200 --> 1:50:58.800]  the way i see it all other political talk it can be exciting it can be entertaining it can
[1:50:58.800 --> 1:51:05.680]  fulfill a kind of emotional even pornographic function but it's ultimately not real it's
[1:51:05.680 --> 1:51:13.200]  not real it's a popcorn exactly yeah exactly oh yeah i don't understand that we're watching an
[1:51:13.200 --> 1:51:18.640]  intelligence agency coup and brendan and clapper have had meetings back before they removed trump
[1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:23.280]  on c-span saying he'll be gone watch ha ha ha and plos he said oh the military will drag him out
[1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:27.200]  you watch he's gone one way or another we don't care we'll have our own government form the new
[1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:32.880]  orc times i was quoting podesta in a war game of even if trump wins we'll break away states and form
[1:51:32.880 --> 1:51:39.440]  a new government they have signaled that they're going for broke with the type of megalomania
[1:51:39.440 --> 1:51:45.920]  that has led the world into war and darkness so many times i mean they really are cancer and as you
[1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:51.680]  said to watch the left fetishizing intelligence agencies and the fbi that they used to be so
[1:51:51.680 --> 1:51:58.640]  concerned about uh is just disgusting it's really remarkable and again i'll reemphasize
[1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:07.040]  do not get distracted the number one threat to the safety security livelihood and freedom of americans
[1:52:07.600 --> 1:52:13.520]  it's not any foreign government it's not any foreign adverse adversary the number one threat
[1:52:13.520 --> 1:52:19.520]  the american people the people and the institutions that control america it is the deep state at the
[1:52:19.520 --> 1:52:25.040]  time we have left uh doctor you know the president well i know i can get messages the president i know
[1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:28.960]  that i'm gonna leave names out they've met and brought this up to him and trump's very angry
[1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:32.800]  right now and you know he's getting geared up to try to get republicans elected and that's great
[1:52:32.800 --> 1:52:37.520]  but they know trump is going to beat them again uh by by energize the republican party they're
[1:52:37.520 --> 1:52:43.520]  going to make a move on him i think obviously if you can talk to him or others and give him a path
[1:52:43.520 --> 1:52:48.160]  to come out and expose this because if trump got behind exposing how they tried to set him up on
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:52.640]  january 6 and were partially successful i think that would really devastate the enemy and change
[1:52:52.640 --> 1:52:58.160]  the narrative how do we get the president the real president to do that now i think that's that would
[1:52:58.160 --> 1:53:03.760]  be absolutely a very important thing to do i know the president reads revolver regularly i haven't
[1:53:03.760 --> 1:53:10.320]  confirmed whether he's read this particular piece but i will certainly press to get that to him
[1:53:10.320 --> 1:53:15.600]  because i you know we need all the help we can get on this and it would be huge if the president
[1:53:15.600 --> 1:53:22.000]  donald trump would focus on bringing attention to this issue because as i say it's really the
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:29.120]  only issue that matters and that was basically the biggest problem in his presidency was that
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:36.400]  the national security state was uh disrupting his agenda at every step that's right in closing when
[1:53:36.400 --> 1:53:40.000]  is the part two coming i mean there's got to be a part two i mean is that going to be about what to
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:44.240]  do now or go back into the history because i talked to you quite a bit when you were researching this
[1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:49.280]  you've got great knowledge uh on all this and obviously have a big command of the of these
[1:53:49.280 --> 1:53:54.480]  hundreds of different operatives so i hope you can get that out to people yes they're going to
[1:53:54.480 --> 1:54:02.080]  be multiple follow-up reports so uh some of them some of them very disturbing and we're not saying
[1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:08.880]  anything definitive but we are asking uh very very important questions and so i hope everyone
[1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:15.040]  watching this go to revolver.news share this piece this is the biggest story in the country right
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:19.680]  now well darin i mean you saw what happened to the award-winning journalist uh who exposed the
[1:54:19.680 --> 1:54:24.480]  tarmac meeting i mean i mean he was fearing for his life and then somebody executes him in his house
[1:54:24.480 --> 1:54:31.760]  this is a so watch your back brother uh we're all in this together uh so dr darin j beaty at
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:38.240]  darin j beaty on twitter and revolver.news go with god we salute you my friend thank you sir wow that
[1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:42.880]  was an super important report doesn't get more important okay spread it listeners we'll be right
[1:54:42.880 --> 1:54:51.440]  back with hour number three the equation is very simple the mega banks control the media
[1:54:51.440 --> 1:54:58.240]  they control big pharma they control academia they control the military industrial complex
[1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:04.160]  they control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have
[1:55:04.160 --> 1:55:12.160]  established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is the western christian idea of human
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:16.880]  freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more than actually
[1:55:16.880 --> 1:55:23.360]  threatens them so because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it
[1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:31.120]  upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:36.720]  that threatens their monopoly so control that's why they target info wars because we understand
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:42.080]  the keys to defeating them but the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars

[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:34.800]  tyrants always push too far and i hate the globalist so much that i don't even want to destroy it
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:40.800]  i hate looking at them i mean you look at the attorney general that guy's ready to start on
[1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:46.160]  the dark crystal part three i mean you just look at these people and it's it's like they've got a real
[1:57:46.160 --> 1:57:52.480]  heart on for america because they're scum and if you get into the psychology of them they want to
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:57.680]  mount our head on the wall we got a special guest coming up the whistleblower from a local fox
[1:57:57.680 --> 1:58:05.600]  affiliate in texas with veritas and when i heard when i saw this two days ago even before i called
[1:58:05.600 --> 1:58:10.720]  veritas to find out i said i said can we have our number and i said let me guess it's vaccines
[1:58:10.720 --> 1:58:16.240]  they're covering up vaccines and they said yeah how'd you know of course it's vaccines
[1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:22.720]  that's everything it's it's just sick like why would you go along with something this
[1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:27.040]  psychotic and by the way i've got a stack of news of new studies where it's giving people
[1:58:27.040 --> 1:58:32.560]  heart attacks and killing folks and there's a big crisis at the cdc because their own people know
[1:58:32.560 --> 1:58:38.000]  that it's in the hundreds of thousands are getting sick in the us alone tens of thousands i've got the
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:45.040]  numbers 24 000 have died from the vaccines from actual death statistics from the heart attacks
[1:58:45.040 --> 1:58:49.520]  and they can then look at it and say why is suddenly for the first time ever thousands and thousands
[1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:54.960]  a week of young people dying of heart attacks and they can follow the graph as each new group was
[1:58:54.960 --> 1:59:01.120]  allowed to take the shot suddenly there's like spikes and people dying and imagine how many
[1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:04.720]  never reported it because they just had a heart attack or had a had a had a had a had a
[1:59:04.720 --> 1:59:11.280]  rhythmic or a problem i mean this is just mind blowing it is mind blowing to be living through
[1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:19.040]  this and then i have to pinch myself because i mean you know if it's on the news um that they're
[1:59:19.040 --> 1:59:25.440]  trying to indict me and try to arrest me for a january 6 and and and i've told you on air i mean
[1:59:25.440 --> 1:59:30.000]  they've sent me just department letters uh saying you're under investigation keep everything you've
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:36.400]  got uh you know at your office all your electronics all your electronic messages blah blah blah
[1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:41.120]  and it's just then you know it's them that provocateur didn't let it and did it you even
[1:59:41.120 --> 1:59:46.080]  know the names of the people you know how they did it and it's just surreal it's like are you
[1:59:46.080 --> 1:59:52.000]  aren't you scared i'm like aren't i scared why would yeah i'm scared for the country but like me
[1:59:52.000 --> 2:00:00.400]  sure they might indict me whatever but it's it's like so what their criminal scum didn't stage
[2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:06.640]  the capital attack that hurt us that hurt our movement to challenge the election that hurt
[2:00:06.640 --> 2:00:11.200]  the 10-day investigation the senate was going to have that got all that killed any idiot could
[2:00:11.200 --> 2:00:15.920]  look at that and say jones isn't suicidal jones doesn't want to destroy himself jones doesn't
[2:00:15.920 --> 2:00:23.200]  want to shut himself down there's not even a motive plus there's me there trying to stop it
[2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:29.760]  from happening so trump needs to go on the offense that was one of his major speech writers
[2:00:30.480 --> 2:00:36.320]  we just had on and i can tell you i've talked to two people that talked directly to trump
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:42.560]  about this and going public with this i was in florida months ago and advised trump through the
[2:00:42.560 --> 2:00:50.960]  um great vine um to uh do the same thing and you just it's hard to get him excited about
[2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:58.560]  going back and exposing it it's coffin nails politically for them if that happens and it
[2:00:58.560 --> 2:01:03.760]  needs to happen and we need to go on the offense and i and i've told general flinn that as well
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:08.080]  and you know general flinn said some nice things after that he's a great guy i hope he
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:13.760]  runs for president but flinn agrees we need to expose january 6 and how q got taken over
[2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:17.600]  i'm like general it's not the idea of q's bad it's that it's run by the feds at the top you've
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:23.440]  got to be q i've said that on air and then it's a real person we trust you and then you can
[2:01:23.440 --> 2:01:29.360]  be our intelligence analyst on an h-hand board uh and and so i'm i'm trying as hard as i can
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:35.600]  or i told trump to take over q i mean i'm not gonna do it um because i attacked it up front
[2:01:35.600 --> 2:01:40.240]  and so some of the q tards won't won't won't listen to me that that's fine i told him what was
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:46.800]  happening uh so we're gonna come right back on the other side of this quick break and talk

[2:03:19.440 --> 2:03:24.000]  so much going on the suppression of knowledge information a cover-ups about vaccines because
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:27.840]  the companies were spending money with them now that she had to go public and she did it really
[2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:34.080]  in a great way she did live on air here it is outages across the region fox 26 reporter ivory
[2:03:34.080 --> 2:03:41.280]  hecker is live in mcgummery county to take a look at that aspect thanks guys that's right before we

[2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:24.640]  and and they're going against the system and whistleblowing against real corruption is what's
[2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:30.240]  going to save this country and this world it's what the system is most afraid of so ivory uh
[2:04:30.240 --> 2:04:35.200]  hecker to blow the whistle on her own network for what she says are acts of deception she's saying
[2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:40.640]  the stations editorial decisions are in a front to honest journalism ivory hecker was a general
[2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:46.000]  assistant reporter and fill in anchor on fox 26 news in houston during her time in houston ivory

[2:05:12.720 --> 2:05:16.480]  the incredible corruption so she joins us we're gonna air some of these recordings coming up
[2:05:16.480 --> 2:05:21.520]  later in the hour uh but uh wow tip of the spear when it comes to exposing this thanks for joining
[2:05:21.520 --> 2:05:27.120]  us thanks so much for having me we'll start out about the process or what it was like when you
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:30.960]  started to have questions and what what brought you to this point and the things you witnessed
[2:05:32.720 --> 2:05:39.840]  it all it all really got weird uh the end of last july actually it it it happened you know the
[2:05:39.840 --> 2:05:48.400]  very start was when uh fox started a manual uh doing that uh famous or infamous uh press conference
[2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:53.120]  about hydroxychloroquine she was she was a local houston doctor so they assigned me to cover her
[2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:58.240]  you know and i and i and i covered her local hospital and actually talked to patients there
[2:05:58.240 --> 2:06:02.080]  who were who were taking her treatment fox said that the coverage it was great but
[2:06:03.360 --> 2:06:09.200]  what we witnessed that day was across the board uh social media censorship like we had never seen
[2:06:09.200 --> 2:06:14.640]  before the sort of social media censorship that i had studied happening in china for years prior to
[2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:21.360]  that it shocked me that's something similar to china was happening in america so after that report
[2:06:21.360 --> 2:06:29.440]  i just did a side social media video just talking about uh censorship explaining uh what china has
[2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:34.720]  been up to and and how we're now seeing it right here in in the united states and even though social
[2:06:34.720 --> 2:06:42.640]  media is not the government uh it does have a monopoly and it is indeed think having success
[2:06:42.640 --> 2:06:48.560]  at crushing the free sharing of information which as we if we look at history that is never a good
[2:06:48.560 --> 2:06:54.000]  thing for free people so i did that social media video and put it out there it got a ton a ton of
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:07:01.280]  reaction my boss is freaked out at me because of that you shared your opinion about something i've
[2:07:01.280 --> 2:07:04.560]  you're never allowed to share your opinion about anything you're a straight reporter here's the
[2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:11.600]  thing free speech is the bread and butter of being a reporter uh journalism can't exist without
[2:07:11.600 --> 2:07:17.680]  free speech journalism well exactly and your own discretion your own view your own humanity but it
[2:07:17.680 --> 2:07:22.320]  turns out though they're the ones up there that are getting the corporate view the corporate money
[2:07:22.320 --> 2:07:28.880]  and they only want that view and to have you be a puppet to push it out right so it stunned me that
[2:07:28.880 --> 2:07:35.600]  uh fox which is a member of the free press was taking this hard stand against publicly saying
[2:07:35.600 --> 2:07:41.920]  censorship is not a good thing for free people and so they because they were just really coming
[2:07:41.920 --> 2:07:47.600]  at me on the phone i hit record that day because i was i was concerned and shocked and that's when
[2:07:47.600 --> 2:07:52.560]  i started recording and then a few weeks later they sent me to cover cover covid treatment at
[2:07:52.560 --> 2:07:59.040]  at a local hospital and the doctor says that he's had a lot of success with his patients
[2:07:59.040 --> 2:08:04.720]  and he's using hydroxychloroquine so that sound bite was never supposed to reach the public ears
[2:08:04.720 --> 2:08:11.040]  according to my bosses because that drug was no longer a part of the narrative so even though
[2:08:11.040 --> 2:08:17.440]  the fact was a local doctor was indeed giving his patients this fox didn't want to let people know
[2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:24.960]  that later on i researched the death rates at that hospital they are incredibly low very few
[2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:32.160]  covid 19 patients die at that hospital so it's very interesting uh to that a hospital that's
[2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:38.960]  having such great success that that fox wouldn't want to let the public know everything that doctor
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:48.160]  is using and i i what i had done is put out a facebook post with his um him talking about hydroxychloroquine
[2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:53.120]  including everything else he uses to treat patients the whole recipe on my facebook but think about
[2:08:53.120 --> 2:08:58.480]  how crazy that is these are doctors with degrees but the un says oh no there's no approved treatment
[2:08:58.480 --> 2:09:03.200]  as if the un's in charge because they wanted to be able to push experimental vaccines you've got to
[2:09:03.200 --> 2:09:08.080]  have no other treatment available that has any efficacy to get that emergency authorization
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:13.840]  this was all done cold-bloodedly estimates are in the millions of deaths worldwide with randesivir
[2:09:13.840 --> 2:09:21.120]  with hydroxychloroquine and now the british are also approving the thing that uh but trump ivermectin
[2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:26.880]  yeah ivermectin all of it so so there has just been such a huge suppression this is criminal so
[2:09:26.880 --> 2:09:32.240]  so i guess that just drove you over the edge watching them tell you don't do this well because
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:37.760]  they didn't just tell me that it the links that they went to try to shut me down i don't know if
[2:09:37.760 --> 2:09:43.520]  it's because i'm i'm a very bold fearless person and that they could tell i wasn't being phased by
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:48.480]  them saying ivory watch out people aren't uh people aren't liking this aren't they truth
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:55.520]  seekers are liking the truth uh so i don't care if if one person doesn't like the truth uh this
[2:09:55.520 --> 2:10:00.640]  doctor's using that drug that's the truth if you don't like it i don't care uh but my bosses saw
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:05.920]  that i didn't care so they had to take a bigger measure and what they did next is internally
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:13.680]  defame me they wrote a uh letter of warning that was full of of falsehoods it created this
[2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:19.360]  switched up timeline that made it look like i was uh uh that they had banned me from covering
[2:10:19.360 --> 2:10:24.720]  covid treatment but i was so passionate about it that i was i was pumped pushing hydroxychloroquine
[2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:31.760]  anyway to this day i've never advocated for that drug so uh i was just reporting what they sent me
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:38.480]  to go cover and so they wrote a defamatory letter of warning i had to get a lawyer involved to fight
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:42.320]  off their lives because they didn't just write this and give it to me they put it in my file
[2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:48.960]  at fox which hurts me because all of the fox executives if they if they're looking to move
[2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:54.080]  me up they look at my file they see that oh don't touch her she is um very rebellious and and where
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:58.560]  are you now i mean they've suspended you are they gonna fire you what's happening um i heard a rumor
[2:10:58.560 --> 2:11:03.280]  that they fired me they didn't tell me that themselves i think that's weird but yeah i'm
[2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:08.640]  apparently fired according to uh some some news well listen i think you're a hero and and and i
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:14.560]  just hope we can create a network or somebody does uh of of of all the people that have conscience
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:18.720]  because i mean i would always just tell a reporter go out and see what's going on talk to that doctor
[2:11:18.720 --> 2:11:23.280]  and see what they say and then it's all about that doctor the idea that like well wait you can't say
[2:11:23.280 --> 2:11:28.800]  i i've remexed him you can't say i'd actually clerked when you can't say redesivir it's just so criminal
[2:11:28.800 --> 2:11:35.520]  it is so strange it's so un-american to be to be shutting down certain words it must be held to
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:39.840]  be these people when you hire a reporter they do a good job and now you're hovering over everything
[2:11:39.840 --> 2:11:46.240]  they do that must be exhausting oh yeah and here's the thing i've another of another fox
[2:11:46.240 --> 2:11:52.560]  executive named ral friend and pulled me aside one day uh quite recently and and tried to give
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:57.440]  me advice on on how to stick in this company and and actually go play something he was like you know
[2:11:58.240 --> 2:12:04.240]  you you've got to kind of get in line ivory and but he told me that my boss who was who was issuing
[2:12:04.240 --> 2:12:09.920]  these disciplines on me that she was behind the scenes in meetings with fox corp in new york she
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:16.640]  was defending me vehemently she was trying to apparently allow me to continue just reporting
[2:12:16.640 --> 2:12:22.080]  sure so exactly that shows that they had guilt but were still following the orders and so the issue
[2:12:22.080 --> 2:12:26.800]  is it's that corporate system yeah it's all the way up to the top see that's the thing when you're
[2:12:26.800 --> 2:12:32.400]  trying to control the narrative the hot the the big the big danger to the narrative is the reporters
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:38.720]  on the ground because what's happening on the ground never really uh aligned ivory ivory you
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:42.960]  are an amazing person stay there one more second with you i guess you're at the veritas headquarters

[2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:08.400]  the petrochemical then dominated two major industries plastics and drugs companies began
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:14.880]  synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs the natural sources were then made

[2:15:13.920 --> 2:15:18.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show you can see the whole report it's incredible
[2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:24.000]  at project veritas.com of the executives telling her to do this telling her to do that and then
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:27.840]  she learned some of them are up there advocating for they want to save lives they they want to
[2:15:27.840 --> 2:15:33.600]  do interviews about the good news so this is 99 effective but again oh no you're not supposed
[2:15:33.600 --> 2:15:38.640]  to do that because big tech said the u n said so now if big tech censors you for something
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:43.120]  well then i guess news stations have to follow what the fact checkers
[2:15:43.120 --> 2:15:48.720]  at big tech say but wait a minute they're the ones that said that didn't come from wuhan
[2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:55.600]  they're the ones that uh said iraq had wmds i mean since when did big tech that's that
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:16:00.800]  isn't journalist they're they're just big corporate hacks that take advertising money
[2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:05.280]  from big companies since when did they become in the hierarchy above you ivory
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:12.960]  i don't know but i can tell you fox got right in line with facebook and twitter and youtube
[2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:21.520]  rule not to discuss the h word well keep elaborating i've got a thousand questions but what do you
[2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:26.960]  want to impart to our viewers and well here's the thing i want to i want to i today i'm going to
[2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:32.960]  release uh some of some of my some more soundbites from my bosses specifically when they tried to
[2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:36.720]  take me down with that defamatory letter and i had to get a lawyer involved the fact that
[2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:42.720]  they would go to that those links to ensure i stick with the narratives shows what reporters
[2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:46.640]  have to grapple with in this in this industry and i think it sheds a little light for the
[2:16:46.640 --> 2:16:52.160]  viewers because i think a lot of viewers probably most viewers get that something weird is going
[2:16:52.160 --> 2:16:56.000]  on with i think that's me and you're explaining to them how it happens why they get intimidated
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:59.840]  that process like and i should have said that you know why are you leaking this not just to
[2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:04.160]  save lives but they were trying to destroy you and your career internally they were attacking
[2:17:04.160 --> 2:17:09.920]  you so you're just defending yourself right and i just think the public should know this is kind of
[2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:15.360]  how it works sometimes what what has happened to me is what a lot of journalists fear so a
[2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:20.000]  lot of journalists don't even don't even try for a story that they know is outside of the narrative
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:26.320]  because they don't want to become a target so that's kind of how the narrative self self continues
[2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:32.240]  self sensors i keep going sorry i interrupted yeah yeah that exactly news outlets self sensor
[2:17:32.240 --> 2:17:37.440]  sometimes by the boss telling a reporter don't do that and sometimes by a reporter just knowing
[2:17:37.440 --> 2:17:41.520]  that i know that story is not within the narrative so i'm not going to touch it just go with the
[2:17:41.520 --> 2:17:47.200]  national new york times cnn narrative you'll be fine it's the safest route yeah exactly that's
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:53.280]  what happens a lot and i just want to shed light on this uh because this is what happens is a lot
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:18:00.000]  of real stories get crushed with it with this narrative i bet they're not too happy now though
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:06.720]  they they got to be looking over their shoulder uh for sure and you know since since i came out
[2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:13.760]  with my true story we are already hearing from other people who have reached out to project
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:20.320]  veritas people within newsrooms who also want to come forward so i'm really i'm really hoping
[2:18:20.320 --> 2:18:28.720]  that other journalists uh stay you know stay bold or get bold with this you know reporters and
[2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:36.640]  any anyone in any position in a newsroom needs to stick with the facts regardless of what the
[2:18:36.640 --> 2:18:43.520]  what the bosses try to mess mess with you and look if a boss tries to mess with the facts hit record
[2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:50.000]  and put that out okay and here's the thing now that bosses know that reporters are seeing this
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:56.960]  and and journalists across newsrooms um hopefully it'll check the bosses and make the bosses a
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:03.360]  little afraid to mess with their team you know it's funny you're telling this story and i see the
[2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:07.600]  other recordings and i see the proof of it and i remember the new york times had this fake article
[2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:12.160]  written a few years ago about me that i told a camera person to do this and the tactics that
[2:19:12.160 --> 2:19:15.840]  they lied and said i was involved in the rest of our crew laughed at it because they know it
[2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:22.240]  doesn't go on i was like but those were their tactics put to me see what i'm saying that they
[2:19:22.240 --> 2:19:26.960]  were saying i was doing that to my people when it was actually they were doing i said where they
[2:19:26.960 --> 2:19:31.360]  come up with this but then you're saying and others are saying it that's what they do routinely
[2:19:31.360 --> 2:19:37.600]  it's really sad it's really sad when when blatant lies are made up that really shocks me
[2:19:38.240 --> 2:19:43.600]  and all the new times made up they said that we had a fish tank and i ate the employees fish
[2:19:43.600 --> 2:19:50.480]  we've never had a fish tank just a total totalize yeah some of these news outlets they they think
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:56.720]  that they can get away with lies but oh it's it's kind of interesting how dumb they think
[2:19:56.720 --> 2:20:04.560]  viewers are when viewers can sense out the truth viewers compare compare stories compare facts
[2:20:04.560 --> 2:20:09.600]  viewers have learned to self verify they go sticking out this has so many viewers don't
[2:20:09.600 --> 2:20:15.600]  trust the news anymore so what these news outlets do when they come up with blatant lies about you
[2:20:15.600 --> 2:20:22.720]  or anyone else is they are in the process of committing their own uh slow suicide i think
[2:20:22.720 --> 2:20:29.280]  you're seeing so many people stop turning to mainstream outlets i totally read statistic
[2:20:29.280 --> 2:20:34.320]  show lack of trusted news has got their ratings down over two-thirds the last ten years nick
[2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:41.280]  allotians lost two-thirds in two years overall the sexualization of children's stuff exactly my own
[2:20:41.280 --> 2:20:49.200]  my own outlet fox 26 houston the ratings are down uh 30 to 40 percent uh on my show this year compared
[2:20:49.200 --> 2:20:55.120]  to last so if people people are turning off their tv's yeah so they're trying to censor us our quote
[2:20:55.120 --> 2:21:03.280]  ratings are up it's crazy so so in closing people don't get that yeah it only it only grows you when
[2:21:03.280 --> 2:21:09.840]  they try to squash you if you find like you've done so so where are you going from here because
[2:21:09.840 --> 2:21:14.560]  we need to support you we need to others to see whistleblowers like you being held up people
[2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:18.160]  should really donate uh because you know you're probably gonna get fired here it's uh until you
[2:21:18.160 --> 2:21:24.800]  get a new job give sin go dot com forward slash oh my gosh i'm looking at that number now for the
[2:21:24.800 --> 2:21:31.360]  first time that's incredible thank you so much but here's this is that number of donations is a testament
[2:21:31.360 --> 2:21:38.080]  to the fact that so many americans are so sick of this narrative and they're thinking they're just
[2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:44.240]  glad that like it's it's coming out uh it's incredible how the news is taking turning a blind
[2:21:44.240 --> 2:21:48.720]  eye to its own audience well listen listen whistleblowing and and and and stuff like this needs
[2:21:48.720 --> 2:21:53.280]  to be this is way more important than being able to throw a ball through a basketball thing or be
[2:21:53.280 --> 2:21:57.280]  able to hit a golf ball i mean what you're doing is having moral integrity so we should celebrate
[2:21:57.280 --> 2:22:02.720]  people should go there right now give sin go dot com forward slash support ivory and donate and i'm
[2:22:02.720 --> 2:22:09.040]  just so glad that you reached out to project veritas yeah i'm too and i'm working on my first
[2:22:09.040 --> 2:22:14.800]  independent reports in coming out very soon well i'm excited about that oh so i was about to ask
[2:22:14.800 --> 2:22:19.520]  what's coming next i guess you're gonna just do some independent reports yeah well yeah i just want
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:25.280]  i want to continue my journalism i'm passionate about wherever that wherever that news lands
[2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:31.840]  on the internet probably not on tv anymore but uh i'm i'm gonna follow through with that that first
[2:22:31.840 --> 2:22:37.120]  covet treatment story that i got in trouble for the information i'm finding in the story is incredible
[2:22:37.120 --> 2:22:42.720]  this is going to be a very compelling story on how covet drug treatment has happened over the past
[2:22:42.720 --> 2:22:48.240]  year and and the media's role in everything i can't wait for you i agree that's one of the biggest
[2:22:48.240 --> 2:22:52.880]  most important stories is how they killed a lot of people not letting good treatments get the folks
[2:22:52.880 --> 2:22:59.040]  that's evil i mean that that's like being an assassin so yeah how wow from what i'm finding
[2:22:59.040 --> 2:23:03.920]  it's pretty disturbing it's it's almost like there's blood on the media's hands well the
[2:23:03.920 --> 2:23:09.760]  goodness is you're not going to have it on ivory hecker's hands are you that's right i i will not

[2:27:20.960 --> 2:27:26.080]  the left tells you don't say that about women no we're supposed to say woman's beautiful
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:33.200]  i get stuttery when i had that revolver professor on his kicking ass i get stuttery with her i mean
[2:27:34.400 --> 2:27:40.800]  both those guests today that the producer uh scott bronson did a great job getting
[2:27:41.840 --> 2:27:48.240]  are the future whistleblowers about hiding medical treatments that are saving 99 percent of people
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:54.480]  that's murder and and i know when i get into the zeitgeist victory victory victory i said
[2:27:55.600 --> 2:28:00.080]  and i had the other guy on if we expose the fbi the criminals that hijacked the fbi
[2:28:00.720 --> 2:28:04.160]  because i don't want the fb out of you bad institutions i don't want to be enemies with
[2:28:04.160 --> 2:28:09.440]  these people but i i mean i'm not going to sit here and watch you start a civil war you crazy
[2:28:09.440 --> 2:28:19.120]  morons and i know we're close to the zeitgeist with both those guests i have a literal
[2:28:19.520 --> 2:28:25.840]  intelligence but but the intelligence always tells me when the hair on the back of my neck stands
[2:28:27.040 --> 2:28:30.080]  and today i've had the hair on the back of my neck stand up with both those guests
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:38.880]  i got a lot to cover in the time we got left and then jay dyer is really smart the great researcher
[2:28:38.880 --> 2:28:42.720]  because i mean i'll be i've been honest with you i read a lot of documents and i read a lot of
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:47.120]  synopses and i the guys will give me some new hundred page report don't like highlight two pages
[2:28:47.120 --> 2:28:51.920]  and i read that jay dyer reads it all like like i used to read everything 20 years ago 10 years
[2:28:51.920 --> 2:28:56.720]  ago now i don't read whole cloth swap books i just cheat sheet and go to the pages and look at it
[2:28:56.720 --> 2:29:02.800]  to make sure it's there um he does massive research he'll be hosting the next hour
[2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:10.480]  and and so many people that are smarter as i am are smarter they always tell me alice just
[2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:16.240]  worry about the good people but the dead bury the dead knock the dust off your feet like christ said
[2:29:16.240 --> 2:29:23.280]  and i should listen to christ that's my leader that's my father that that's that's who i i'm under
[2:29:23.280 --> 2:29:32.000]  the command of but god made me and i just i really don't want to turn loose at these people i i want
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:39.840]  to save these people that are doing all this evil stuff i can't believe that they don't know god i
[2:29:39.840 --> 2:29:44.480]  can't believe they don't know how invigorating it is to be a good person how empowering it is to not
[2:29:44.480 --> 2:29:52.240]  be a coward see my problem is i don't have any fear anymore except fear of failure and fear of not
[2:29:52.240 --> 2:29:59.280]  doing what i should and fear of being weak i mean fighting tyranny is intoxicating when you're doing
[2:29:59.280 --> 2:30:03.200]  what you're supposed to do and you're lined up with things or your head screwed on straight it
[2:30:03.200 --> 2:30:12.880]  feels good why would anybody not want to do what's normal men and women families justice power we're
[2:30:12.880 --> 2:30:17.920]  powerful we're gonna build some incredible stuff you see all this crap they already built this is
[2:30:17.920 --> 2:30:33.120]  tinker toy this is finger painting and then i think about being a mark zuckerberg or being a
[2:30:33.120 --> 2:30:40.240]  bill gates and what it's like to be a sack of garbage to be real trash
[2:30:40.240 --> 2:30:49.920]  and imagine you you see all these people and you hate them because you hate yourself you're not
[2:30:49.920 --> 2:30:56.880]  figuring out how to help all these people you just want to kill them imagine how nasty and dirty
[2:30:56.880 --> 2:31:09.040]  that must feel and then you camouflage it in the pink sweater and you just indiscriminately
[2:31:09.040 --> 2:31:19.200]  then try to deny medical care to a virus you've released so you can make more money
[2:31:23.280 --> 2:31:28.080]  killing people with a poison shot of it all makes perfect sense when you're in their perspective
[2:31:28.080 --> 2:31:41.200]  when you're in their mindset so i just think my lucky star is twice and twice again that i am not
[2:31:41.200 --> 2:31:50.160]  one of these people i mean look at those guys they hate themselves so much they're so ungenuine
[2:31:50.160 --> 2:32:05.600]  they are so fake can you imagine how poor they are spiritually a beggar with no legs living in a
[2:32:05.600 --> 2:32:10.960]  ditch that can see the beauty of god's creation is infinity better than those men
[2:32:10.960 --> 2:32:24.480]  or fouchy i mean look at that face that's a killer that is a sick freak that is your enemy
[2:32:26.400 --> 2:32:31.760]  that little arrogant garbage needs to be grabbed up by the scruff of his neck and thrown into a deep
[2:32:31.760 --> 2:32:42.480]  prison but he thinks it's gonna be me and you that's in that prison that might actually be that
[2:32:42.480 --> 2:32:59.040]  way fouchy for a little while but you're not gonna outrun god son and after what you've done to all
[2:32:59.040 --> 2:33:05.760]  those children and all those innocent people you deserve what's gonna happen to you you asked for
[2:33:05.760 --> 2:33:12.880]  it and you're gonna get it i just told about a trillion light years away when it happens
[2:33:15.680 --> 2:33:21.520]  because the type of bully that he is and the type of sack of garbage he is and the type of coward he
[2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:33.440]  is he will be 100% cut off from god you know what that means when you're a psycho psycho killer
[2:33:34.160 --> 2:33:39.760]  whose whole life is about killing people and getting off on it can you imagine being that little
[2:33:39.760 --> 2:33:53.600]  monster burning hell fouchy all right i want to hit senator paul on something really important
[2:33:53.600 --> 2:33:57.360]  that we do not want the same criminals that ran the luluhan cover-up running the new cover-up
[2:33:58.560 --> 2:34:02.880]  and a lot more i'll do it next segment but if i don't remember to do this hell i 10 years ago
[2:34:02.880 --> 2:34:07.280]  i didn't think i'd be here in 10 years so i always kind of get this law say far as you know so well
[2:34:07.280 --> 2:34:11.840]  there's not enough money around the operation and six months at current rates on god will provide

[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:49.200]  to break our will and rub rub it in our faces he's not an american he doesn't represent us
[2:41:49.200 --> 2:41:55.920]  he's a joke we live on together and we're not going to be enslaved by that piece of trash
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:04.320]  but speaking to him uh here is a clip of him talking about as usual i have a list of reporters
[2:42:04.320 --> 2:42:08.880]  i'm going to go to before remember a few months ago they even zoomed in the list the face who they are
[2:42:08.880 --> 2:42:15.520]  are the the questions already asked the answer is already there it's scripted press conference
[2:42:15.520 --> 2:42:19.680]  so trump got like ah we ain't doing that because they didn't run it trump wasn't perfect they
[2:42:19.680 --> 2:42:25.840]  didn't run it but now with biden he admits it's scripted it's just all out and then no other
[2:42:25.840 --> 2:42:31.520]  media will call it out but we will you will here it is it's about a mutual self interest
[2:42:32.240 --> 2:42:37.760]  i'll take your questions and as usual folks they gave me a list of the people i'm going to call on
[2:42:37.760 --> 2:42:40.160]  so uh jonathan associated press
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:48.400]  thank you sir uh u.s intelligence has said that russia tried to interfere in the last two
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:55.040]  presidential elections and that russia groups are behind hacks like yeah so again remember there's
[2:42:55.040 --> 2:42:59.680]  photos and articles about it where they zoomed in and like saw like it was like a picture of what
[2:42:59.680 --> 2:43:05.600]  the question went the answer is i mean this is like scripted like a play you know fake
[2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:13.360]  oh man you know just from a journalism perspective if i told the guest we're going to script every
[2:43:13.360 --> 2:43:18.720]  answer every question they'd say you're crazy i get sending talking points some shows you know hey
[2:43:18.720 --> 2:43:23.440]  send me 10 questions or whatever that's fine i'll do it but this is just this is just acidine
[2:43:23.440 --> 2:43:28.480]  but it's all yeah there it is there's a photo of it their name what the question is all of it
[2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:34.400]  i mean this is criminal behavior and by criminal i mean a crime against the truth it's that's
[2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:45.280]  hyperbole all right let's um let's go to this stack let's go to this stack right here because i
[2:43:45.280 --> 2:43:49.200]  tended to get into the whole race war false flag they're playing today that's important to do you
[2:43:49.200 --> 2:43:56.000]  know get off the whole covid stack but covid is the big enchilada other than the coming race war
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:44:01.040]  that they're trying to start that as a law enforcement officer or as the fbi i would not
[2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:05.600]  want to start with you but hey i'd get your tough your your your badass your invincible
[2:44:06.160 --> 2:44:12.400]  so uh a war with 200 million gun owners is going to really go well oh i'm just going to stay out
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:18.960]  of it okay i i'm not tough like you i uh also not suicidal but you know me i'm an extremist i'm a
[2:44:18.960 --> 2:44:26.560]  bad guy i'm into freedom and stuff like that uh but here it is video ran paul demands exclusion
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:32.000]  of wuhan lab funders from investigation gee think so if you're a rest of grip of bank robbers you
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:38.960]  don't have the bank robbers as the judge of the jury so here's the senator talking about that
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:46.720]  here's the problem the who investigated this the first time we suggested three people to
[2:44:46.720 --> 2:44:52.080]  send to china they rejected all three and they accepted a guy named peter daisak who was the
[2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:57.760]  one who funded the lab so you can't have the people like peter fratt anthony fouchie or peter
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:45:03.760]  daisak who who were part of the funding mechanism to send these funds to wuhan lab you can't have
[2:45:03.760 --> 2:45:10.720]  them investigating themselves they have a definite conflict of interest because of it if this pandemic
[2:45:10.720 --> 2:45:15.680]  started in a lab that the u.s. was funding the people advocating for the funding obviously will
[2:45:15.680 --> 2:45:21.200]  have you know culpability at least moral culpability so they can't be investigating themselves
[2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:26.720]  the who did a terrible job the first time there needs to be investigation but i've been advocating
[2:45:26.720 --> 2:45:31.440]  for a congressional investigation in the senate i've asked two committees that i'm on
[2:45:31.440 --> 2:45:36.960]  homeland security and the health committee the health labor and pensions committee to investigate
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:40.720]  this i haven't heard back from the democrat chairman so far but i think this should be
[2:45:40.720 --> 2:45:45.440]  investigated i don't think it has to be partisan we should all want to know how this pandemic
[2:45:45.440 --> 2:45:49.760]  started but we should all want to know so we don't have this happen again with another lab leak
[2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:56.800]  of an even more dangerous virus uh yeah exactly so there we are on that front
[2:45:58.240 --> 2:46:01.760]  and i just go back to this because so many people like oh my god john stewart's turned into you
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:07.920]  no john stewart's brother runs the new york stock exchange john stewart is more than meets the eye
[2:46:07.920 --> 2:46:13.440]  he knows this is all coming out he's getting ahead of it and of course the left is attacking him

[2:46:48.880 --> 2:46:57.280]  and it just makes me sick but you're not going to hear a damn word out of the leftist media
[2:46:57.280 --> 2:47:03.520]  or black leaders because this isn't a kosher thing to talk about it's not authorized and
[2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:10.960]  and i've been looking at the statistics there is a higher rate of blacks africans dying from

[2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:10.560]  welcome to the alex joneshow on your guest cuz j dire of j's analysis today i'm gonna give an
[2:54:10.560 --> 2:54:15.440]  analysis of something that we've all heard of we probably read it in high school yeah yeah yeah
[2:54:15.440 --> 2:54:22.080]  we know we're living in 1984 i recently went back and read it again and watched the movie and
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:28.000]  obviously the books a lot better but there's something i think there's a lot of things
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:34.400]  that we have missed i mean this this book is so profound now so telling that it actually deserves
[2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:39.840]  an entire treatment and i'm again i'm sure most people are familiar with the overall story okay
[2:54:39.840 --> 2:54:44.320]  there's big brother and yeah he surveils you know everybody in society and everybody's put under
[2:54:44.320 --> 2:54:49.200]  these you know tyrannical boot uh you know of the police state and all that's true but
[2:54:49.840 --> 2:54:57.280]  there's so many pieces of nuance so many details that deserve to be covered that i beg you please
[2:54:57.280 --> 2:55:02.560]  go listen to this on audio if you don't have time to read it if you drive to work listen to 1984
[2:55:02.560 --> 2:55:10.880]  um because the story is coming from a guy who had seen both sides of the dialectic right he had
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:15.680]  seen different intelligence agencies and their their secret police how they worked at different
[2:55:15.680 --> 2:55:22.720]  times and uh wartime i'm speaking of eric blair he had seen the communist uh dialectic the socialist
[2:55:22.720 --> 2:55:28.000]  and even the western power structure and their so-called democracy really all kind of being
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:35.840]  these systems that are used to manipulate people and to what end well if you saw recently claus
[2:55:35.840 --> 2:55:40.720]  swabb had said that now it's time for the great reset in fact i think alex covered this a couple
[2:55:40.720 --> 2:55:45.760]  days ago he said that you know covid all this is our opportunity it's our great opportunity don't
[2:55:45.760 --> 2:55:53.840]  ever let a crisis go to waste this is our opportunity to reset all of society two years zero basically
[2:55:53.840 --> 2:56:00.080]  right and bring in this technocratic order by which you'll have a universal basic income
[2:56:00.080 --> 2:56:06.000]  and essentially what he's talking about is the combining the elements of western capitalism
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:12.640]  with eastern socialism and that synthesis which is a hegelian philosophical idea to
[2:56:12.640 --> 2:56:20.720]  synthesize two opposing structures produces right this higher level order at least that's how the
[2:56:20.720 --> 2:56:26.560]  philosophy of dialectics and hegelianism and marxism thinks right and so the idea would be
[2:56:26.560 --> 2:56:30.800]  that the super state that's created out of these kind of smashing the things together would be
[2:56:30.800 --> 2:56:38.880]  that higher level next order now again eric blair george oil he wrote this book in 1947-48
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:45.600]  so he was privy apparently to what the royal society the western elite the atlantis's establishment
[2:56:45.600 --> 2:56:51.360]  had planned for the global order and so people like clauslaw bill gates they represent the kind
[2:56:51.360 --> 2:56:58.880]  of technocrats that that he's talking about with the inner party right the o'brien right this o'brien
[2:56:58.880 --> 2:57:04.320]  type of character is perfect as an image as an archetype of the kind of people that are now
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:09.920]  saying openly that it's time to bring in this technocratic year zero great reset where's your
[2:57:09.920 --> 2:57:15.840]  zero come from well if you remember in the book winston is talking he's writing at this sort of
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:21.360]  ambiguous period after a revolution there was a great revolution that occurred to overthrow
[2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:27.920]  this older bourgeois this older control structure that that's supposedly now big brother had saved
[2:57:27.920 --> 2:57:34.400]  everybody from and big brother has this this this powerful propaganda outlet right the ministry
[2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:41.280]  of truth by which they rewrite history and they rewrite the news as it comes out okay so the news
[2:57:41.280 --> 2:57:50.080]  that comes out in the the novel is fake news fake news literally fake news okay so we were told
[2:57:50.080 --> 2:57:56.720]  about fake news a long time ago in this story and i want to stress that this is not just a fiction
[2:57:56.720 --> 2:58:05.520]  novel it's not just a dystopian story it's actually a really profound study in psychological warfare
[2:58:06.320 --> 2:58:10.000]  and this is an important discipline for understanding how the world works what we're
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:16.800]  going through in today's society how to break down these supposed false dialectics the fake news the
[2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:25.920]  cy war so excuse me there um any time i break out these old books i'll start sneezing mine or
[2:58:25.920 --> 2:58:31.200]  cy war these are key elements and that's really the the big weapon right the big brother has over
[2:58:31.200 --> 2:58:35.680]  the population and so when we come back after this break we're going to break down the mine war the
[2:58:35.680 --> 2:58:41.920]  cy war the super state the power block structure that big brother had broken the world into in its
[2:58:41.920 --> 2:58:48.800]  technocracy which was a powerful prediction right somewhat 50 60 years ago where we are today don't
[2:58:48.800 --> 2:58:55.920]  go anywhere this is the logic don't show a dire info wars is here because there's a war on for your
[2:58:55.920 --> 2:59:01.200]  mind that's why it's been our motto for more than 25 years and if you research even the un's own
[2:59:01.200 --> 2:59:06.640]  admissions over two billion people on planet earth out of seven and a half billion have cognitive
[2:59:06.640 --> 2:59:12.400]  disabilities lower iq because of lack of iodine that's why they work to make sure iodine isn't
[2:59:12.400 --> 2:59:18.480]  in the food isn't in the salt anymore now regular iodine that you find in food is bound to
[2:59:18.480 --> 2:59:23.840]  different minerals and so it's hard for your body to absorb but if you get the proper type of iodine
[2:59:23.840 --> 2:59:28.320]  there's three types that are good for the body it does amazing things it's essential in the body
[2:59:28.320 --> 2:59:33.280]  but we have our amazing tri iodine a big shipment came in because we're able to offer it at the
[2:59:33.280 --> 2:59:41.200]  lowest price ever 60 off that is survival shield x3 60 off with three types of powerful iodine
[2:59:41.200 --> 2:59:46.640]  tri iodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine and makes even more powerful
[2:59:46.640 --> 2:59:50.800]  the cellular level you and your family will love it it's incredible for your body get it info or
[2:59:50.800 --> 2:59:53.520]  short icon today
[3:00:04.320 --> 3:00:10.320]  welcome back to the outside i'm showing you just those day diaries and houses on uh if you want
[3:00:10.320 --> 3:00:15.520]  my books by the way where i cover these kinds of things in film and fiction uh go to my website
[3:00:15.520 --> 3:00:19.680]  and you can find the shop section there and you can get signed copies of my books esoteric
[3:00:19.680 --> 3:00:24.400]  hollywood one and two which again covers this stuff now we were talking about how big brother had
[3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:30.880]  broken the world up into these power blocks and winston of course lives in uh one of those power
[3:00:30.880 --> 3:00:36.080]  blocks a oceania which is formerly the british empire right it's excuse me it's an airstrip one
[3:00:36.800 --> 3:00:41.360]  and and in the super state they're given a narrative they're given a story of the external
[3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:48.080]  threat the external enemy which is these other right eurasia oceania these other places east
[3:00:48.080 --> 3:00:55.280]  asia right where that they're in a war with a perpetual war right so the revolution we learned
[3:00:55.280 --> 3:01:00.240]  didn't end even though it brought in this technocratic world government it's a never ending
[3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:06.800]  perpetual revolution and there's another key and of course in its you know compliment you could say
[3:01:06.800 --> 3:01:12.720]  cousin book brave new world that aldis hexley wrote if you read that and you read the introduction
[3:01:12.720 --> 3:01:17.360]  that aldis hexley wrote in that novel it's really important because hexley says the introduction
[3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:23.200]  to the novel that this is not a fiction story it's not just some dystopia i'm actually telling you
[3:01:23.200 --> 3:01:28.880]  what hit my brother i'll uh julian and the people at unesco royal society so the plan that they have
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:35.920]  for the technocracy to bring in so this is a expose a kind of gas lighting in a way because i
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:40.080]  don't believe that that aldis was a hero who was telling us the truth i think he was in on this as
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:45.680]  well as the rest of these people perhaps orwell was trying to tell the truth because he had seen
[3:01:45.680 --> 3:01:51.600]  from the inside right how this is a managed dialectic so the super states as we said are all
[3:01:51.600 --> 3:01:56.240]  kind of ruled by this inner party and the inner party is kind of like a secret society we don't
[3:01:56.240 --> 3:02:01.520]  know a lot about it winston has scant details about it he just knows that they're kind of revered
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:08.080]  and given this priest of power kind of reverence and deferment right they're worshiped because they
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:15.280]  have raw power and winston starts to realize as he's working in the ministry of truth that
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:22.240]  as he's basically mandated with updating history because there is no such thing as objective
[3:02:22.240 --> 3:02:29.600]  truth in history so big brother's world is relativistic right but it's not a pure relativism
[3:02:29.600 --> 3:02:34.160]  where there's no such thing as truth there's no such thing as right and wrong objectively it's a
[3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:42.560]  mandated truth that the system gives to you so in other words big brother is truth the party
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:48.320]  is truth right in fact i just had a debate with an atheist not too long ago and the first thing
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:52.960]  he said in his debate a opening statement was something to the fact that look truth is just
[3:02:52.960 --> 3:02:58.880]  simply whatever the collective majority of scientists say it is because he's literally
[3:02:59.760 --> 3:03:07.840]  mimicking and echoing the very point of orville's novel which is that truth is whatever the party
[3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:14.240]  says it is and this is crucial to understand that this occurred because big brother was
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:20.160]  successful in demoralizing the population right who's the population well they're called the
[3:03:20.160 --> 3:03:25.840]  proles they're called the proletariat the working class right the middle class and the lower class
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:32.160]  and what big brother had done in terms of the revolution and over time was basically so beat
[3:03:32.160 --> 3:03:38.560]  them down and so demoralized them through intentional confusion and contradictions
[3:03:39.200 --> 3:03:46.640]  that the society actually developed a dissociative state yes 1984 is literally about trauma-based
[3:03:46.640 --> 3:03:51.360]  mind control and you think well that sounds like a weird conspiracy thing and that's my that's
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:55.520]  in culture or something that that how is that this fiction novel because if you get to the end
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:04:00.560]  of the novel which we'll get to in a second but getting a little ahead of myself big brother lays
[3:04:00.560 --> 3:04:06.400]  out the metaphysics of big brother the philosophy of big brother but the reality that big brother
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:11.920]  has the ethics that big brother has the epistemology or the doctrine of knowledge that big brother
[3:04:11.920 --> 3:04:16.880]  has and those scenes where he's going through the torture with you know with Winston are so
[3:04:16.880 --> 3:04:25.280]  powerful precisely because they give this this terrifying dark logic you could say of the technocratic
[3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:30.880]  system but before we get to that I want to point out some of the other insights that we are given
[3:04:30.880 --> 3:04:36.800]  which was that the first thing Winston notices as he's you know figuring out the big big brothers
[3:04:36.800 --> 3:04:42.880]  full of contradictions is that they're told every day that they're free they're told every day right
[3:04:42.880 --> 3:04:48.880]  that that the system loves them they're told every day right that it's essentially a liberal system
[3:04:48.880 --> 3:04:56.080]  it's liberal and loving even though it's totally brutal it's totally a culture of death a cult of
[3:04:56.080 --> 3:05:00.800]  death basically and in fact O'Brien will more or less say that at the end of the book that it's a
[3:05:00.800 --> 3:05:08.240]  death cult but everybody had been so dissociated and so put into a double think state a double
[3:05:08.240 --> 3:05:15.440]  mind mind control state that whatever they were told even though in in their face the reverse
[3:05:15.440 --> 3:05:21.600]  was true they believe the inversion so to get to a place where the population believes inversion
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:29.520]  psychological warfare specialists social engineers right they have to perfect the technique
[3:05:29.520 --> 3:05:35.280]  of demoralizing the population because when you demoralize the population this is part of the
[3:05:35.280 --> 3:05:41.360]  strategy of how you overthrow a population and all the way back to sun zoo all the way back to
[3:05:41.360 --> 3:05:46.720]  even Machiavelli's book art of war right he has a art of war as well that talks about all these
[3:05:46.720 --> 3:05:52.080]  techniques and strategies to demoralize the enemy so if you demoralize the enemy they don't have a
[3:05:52.080 --> 3:05:58.640]  basis from which to judge true and false to judge right and wrong thus the super state loves
[3:05:58.640 --> 3:06:04.880]  relativism and basically subjectivism now i hope you know what that is but if you know it's just
[3:06:04.880 --> 3:06:10.560]  simply the idea that there's nothing true whatever flows your boat dude right my truth is my truth
[3:06:10.560 --> 3:06:16.400]  your truth is your truth this why does the state love that well if if the state if the state is
[3:06:16.400 --> 3:06:23.440]  able to have that as the majority view amongst its population then most people are going to defer
[3:06:23.440 --> 3:06:30.160]  to whatever the state says the state now becomes the incarnation of truth it becomes the arbiter
[3:06:30.160 --> 3:06:37.680]  of truth it will tell you what vaccines do regardless of what they actually do no no it
[3:06:37.680 --> 3:06:43.440]  doesn't matter what happens if we say that this will save you it will save you it doesn't matter
[3:06:43.440 --> 3:06:48.320]  if millions of people end up dead it does none of that matters because do what we say because we say
[3:06:48.320 --> 3:06:54.000]  so and if you object to this you're mentally insane so that's the next key point here is that
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:58.880]  a lot of people miss the fact 1984 is a medical dictatorship it's a medical tyranny
[3:06:59.520 --> 3:07:05.920]  because Winston is constantly told that his life is healthy right he's got victory gin he's got
[3:07:05.920 --> 3:07:12.240]  victory smokes everything that he has in his life which is just this dismal right like a gray
[3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:19.920]  blue jean worker outfit existence right he's told that he's healthy he's free and he's prosperous
[3:07:20.560 --> 3:07:25.600]  and some days they even give him chocolate right and what does claus say you're going to eat
[3:07:25.600 --> 3:07:30.800]  do the bugs you would eat the sewage you will eat the piece right all of these things claus is
[3:07:30.800 --> 3:07:37.120]  telling us we're gonna do is basically the life that you see in 1984 that's Winston's life but
[3:07:37.120 --> 3:07:43.680]  Winston starts to realize that something's wrong here right and and perhaps he thinks there's hope
[3:07:44.240 --> 3:07:50.000]  in the resistance that o'brien initially thinks is leading he suspects that there's this kind of
[3:07:50.640 --> 3:07:57.200]  revolution against this counter insurgency against big brother that maybe o'brien is kind of the
[3:07:57.200 --> 3:08:04.240]  head of now ironically Winston's suspicions are kind of on point right like he's kind of correct
[3:08:04.240 --> 3:08:12.160]  if you know the story that there is some truth to the notion that o'brien is involved in the
[3:08:12.160 --> 3:08:17.760]  figure of immanuel golstein and this revolution against big brother but as you all know spoiler
[3:08:17.760 --> 3:08:25.120]  alert it's actually o'brien that has written the manual right of oligarchical collectivism that
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:31.040]  is immanuel golstein the fictional terrorist or revolutionary force against big brother
[3:08:31.040 --> 3:08:37.840]  its goal it's it's o'brien himself that has written the text in manual for opposing big brother
[3:08:39.600 --> 3:08:43.360]  now if we think about this and applying to what alex talked about in the first couple hours
[3:08:43.360 --> 3:08:48.880]  isn't it interesting that do you remember what we saw with the qanon nonsense right we saw this
[3:08:48.880 --> 3:08:56.320]  idea of operation trust going back to what bolsheviks did where they had a false right opposition
[3:08:56.320 --> 3:09:01.920]  that was actually led by the system and what they did through this was to smoke out all the
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:08.640]  potential counter revolutionaries that's exactly what o'brien does in 1984
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:17.520]  immanuel golstein is a front it's a cutout and by the way isn't it interesting that he's a terrorist
[3:09:18.320 --> 3:09:25.920]  and throughout 1984 they're conducting a war on terror by an opponent created and controlled by
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:33.280]  the system well it sounds exactly like the muja hadin al qaeda bin laden exactly right isis right
[3:09:33.280 --> 3:09:40.720]  western created things they become a skeleton key right for wherever we want to go in and invade
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:44.240]  we're listening to the alex don't show i'm breaking down

[3:12:19.520 --> 3:12:31.360]  the
[3:12:33.200 --> 3:12:35.360]  very superstitious
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:39.360]  writing on the wall
[3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:49.200]  oh
[3:12:56.720 --> 3:12:57.200]  a lot
[3:13:01.440 --> 3:13:06.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your guest host j dire j's analysis we are breaking down
[3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:14.240]  1984 and all the profound and nuanced insights into the modern day where we are in this technocratic
[3:13:14.240 --> 3:13:21.200]  emergent dictatorship and i was speaking of the the the way that big brother mind control people
[3:13:22.240 --> 3:13:27.120]  i want to point out the rituals too there's this notion of humiliation rituals and remember that
[3:13:28.480 --> 3:13:35.440]  in the conception of eric blair or orwell the the problem would be something communist
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:39.680]  right it would be this authoritarian police state dictatorship with the boots you know
[3:13:39.680 --> 3:13:46.080]  stamping on your face and then there's a an insight i think that that all this had in
[3:13:46.080 --> 3:13:51.760]  bringing the world that was missed in 1984 which is that rather than it being this thing that makes
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:59.200]  you miserable maybe it would be more of a drug induced kind of you know vegetable vegetable
[3:13:59.200 --> 3:14:03.840]  state right like you just lay around basically stone out of your mind all day long on these
[3:14:03.840 --> 3:14:08.320]  different pharmaceuticals soma as it's called in the novel and maybe that would be a better way to
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:13.040]  actually make people love their servitude so there's definitely an element that you know
[3:14:13.040 --> 3:14:18.240]  huxley got right that was missing in 1984 but there's no shortage of the jackboot kind of
[3:14:19.040 --> 3:14:25.760]  stuff going on especially with the lockdowns that we've seen now that was in 1984 and on top of that
[3:14:25.760 --> 3:14:31.280]  remember that yes there is the mass surveillance state literally everything that that he does
[3:14:31.280 --> 3:14:36.720]  does is surveilled in fact there's a great scene in the movie where the john hurt character playing
[3:14:36.720 --> 3:14:40.880]  a winces but he has got to huddle in the corner because that's the only area in his apartment
[3:14:40.880 --> 3:14:46.720]  where the cameras right or the tv screens don't watch him and so another predictive prophetic
[3:14:46.720 --> 3:14:52.800]  element that all of the tv screens all the devices the listening devices the communication devices
[3:14:52.800 --> 3:14:58.000]  are two-way and you're being recorded you're being listened to at all times another i think
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:02.880]  terrifying element to this is that they weren't just concerned with outward forms of tyranny
[3:15:02.880 --> 3:15:09.280]  outward forms of expression against big brother writing a book or or having secret meetings
[3:15:09.280 --> 3:15:14.240]  they were concerned with your thoughts with your thought process processes that some others
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:19.600]  they want to know and make sure that you're not just outwardly giving difference to big brother
[3:15:20.560 --> 3:15:25.440]  but that there's not even any mental option of defying big brother
[3:15:25.440 --> 3:15:31.600]  orwell is giving you the plan of the elite of the last hundred years at least he's telling you
[3:15:31.600 --> 3:15:37.600]  that that's their mindset and if you think well now wait a minute is there any evidence that they
[3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:43.600]  might try to do this actually control thought yes and again this may seem a little crazy a little
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:49.120]  out there but if you look into like the article you just saw there about the proteins if you look
[3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:55.520]  into the possibilities of what nanotech can do and perhaps might be the case with these
[3:15:55.520 --> 3:16:00.000]  stabbies that everybody's getting i mean there is the potentiality here we don't even know what's
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:03.840]  in these we don't know what is really going on for sure we have some ideas and a lot of
[3:16:03.840 --> 3:16:08.080]  speculation a lot of whistleblowers but the effects of this are unknown in fact you might
[3:16:08.080 --> 3:16:13.840]  actually get a situation where people can literally be mind controlled via signals right
[3:16:13.840 --> 3:16:20.000]  via ELF via BLF through the nanotech through the magnetized particulate that's going into people
[3:16:20.480 --> 3:16:26.480]  and so that would be even beyond what orwell could conceive of and in fact both 1984 and
[3:16:26.480 --> 3:16:30.960]  brave new world have elements that the others lack and we live in a world now that has not just
[3:16:30.960 --> 3:16:36.320]  both elements of these basically every dystopian story ever there's an element that's in our
[3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:41.280]  future so i don't know if we chose that if cern blasted us into the wrong timeline where
[3:16:41.280 --> 3:16:46.080]  we're basically we're getting every dystopia blended together but what one thing they didn't
[3:16:46.080 --> 3:16:52.560]  get was the total clown world cartoon level of the dystopia right i mean again even orwell
[3:16:52.560 --> 3:16:58.880]  even all the sex we couldn't have predicted the cartoonish absurdity of what we see but again
[3:16:58.880 --> 3:17:04.560]  if you if you know the psychological warfare study that's going on here in 1984 you can begin
[3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:09.440]  to see it so i want to talk about the espionage elements right the control of thought the
[3:17:09.440 --> 3:17:16.160]  the cy war that the big brother does which is so effective because on the one hand it's really
[3:17:16.880 --> 3:17:21.680]  intricate but on the other hand it's also really simplistic right because we know big brother
[3:17:21.680 --> 3:17:26.560]  is evil we know he's out for control and he wants to control the mind so he's interested in mind
[3:17:26.560 --> 3:17:32.240]  control so what's he going to do to do it to affect this mind control as we said he creates
[3:17:32.240 --> 3:17:36.800]  a fake resistance first of all it's actually called the brotherhood so i don't know if that's
[3:17:36.800 --> 3:17:42.400]  the you know to give perhaps a difference to or a nod to freemason or something like that i don't
[3:17:42.400 --> 3:17:47.920]  know but it's basically a secret society that big brother has created as its fake resistance
[3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:55.360]  its controlled opposition meanwhile big brother says let's destroy the language so that the
[3:17:55.360 --> 3:18:01.040]  prole so that the population can't even effectually communicate because if they could communicate
[3:18:01.040 --> 3:18:08.720]  they might could create art literature truth commerce anything that would show objectivity
[3:18:08.720 --> 3:18:14.640]  and truth outside of big brother so you see the reason and this is a really profound insight
[3:18:14.640 --> 3:18:20.560]  on the part of or well the reason that big brother has to control all thought all actions
[3:18:21.440 --> 3:18:28.640]  and language all meaning is because if it were to allow freedom if it were to allow things outside
[3:18:28.640 --> 3:18:35.360]  of its its definitions and determinations of what is true then it would show that big brother isn't
[3:18:35.360 --> 3:18:42.080]  god and that's essentially what big brother is doing is being and becoming god think of the
[3:18:42.080 --> 3:18:48.640]  empires of the past think of nero right in the roman empire or uh pharaoh and egypt right the
[3:18:48.640 --> 3:18:54.800]  representative of the whole universe is the emperor is the the god man right and he demands you to
[3:18:54.800 --> 3:19:00.160]  worship him and then you can basically do whatever you want right in the first 300 years of christianity
[3:19:00.160 --> 3:19:05.920]  this is why there were so many martyrs is because the martyrs wouldn't admit that Caesar's god but
[3:19:05.920 --> 3:19:10.160]  a lot of people don't know that you could have any religion you want that as long as you said
[3:19:10.160 --> 3:19:17.040]  Caesar's god yeah go worship those other gods just remember that you do what we say and the same
[3:19:17.040 --> 3:19:23.840]  temptation has existed for any state in history to step into that place and decide that they're god
[3:19:23.840 --> 3:19:28.880]  to control the churches to control religion to control everything in society basically they
[3:19:28.880 --> 3:19:36.880]  have to become god that's the dark logic of the status system in 1984 is the ultimate status system
[3:19:36.880 --> 3:19:42.320]  and it's the ultimate prediction of where we are now remember too that in british intelligence
[3:19:43.520 --> 3:19:48.000]  at least the way the official secrets act worked in britain people that worked in intelligence
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:54.480]  couldn't write openly about what they had seen so what did they do well many of them would write
[3:19:54.480 --> 3:19:59.600]  fiction and this is kind of the beginning of what we might call fiction propaganda or
[3:20:01.120 --> 3:20:05.200]  predictive programming right you would get writers like graham green where they would write their
[3:20:06.160 --> 3:20:10.320]  intelligence exploits into the fiction so you would get more truth in the fiction than you would
[3:20:10.320 --> 3:20:14.880]  get in the ministry of truth fake news that they would put out and this is another example of this
[3:20:14.880 --> 3:20:20.400]  right or well as telling us that this is how the priests of power work in their system even to the
[3:20:20.400 --> 3:20:26.800]  point where he predicts social justice warriors yes the youth justice leagues that go around basically
[3:20:26.800 --> 3:20:31.840]  tattletailing on anybody who says something about a woman being beautiful or something like you can't
[3:20:31.840 --> 3:20:37.520]  do that right you're evil you have to become shouted down right you're you get these two
[3:20:37.520 --> 3:20:42.240]  minutes of hate which are public humiliation rituals the two minutes of hate right where you
[3:20:42.240 --> 3:20:48.000]  scream on us at a screen he predicted social justice warriors ratting out their parents
[3:20:48.880 --> 3:20:55.600]  big pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical
[3:20:55.600 --> 3:21:02.640]  the petrochemical then dominated two major industries plastics and drugs companies began
[3:21:02.640 --> 3:21:09.120]  synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs the natural sources were then made
[3:21:09.120 --> 3:21:15.280]  illegal pharmaceuticals became medicine and the sicker people got the more their industry grew
[3:21:15.840 --> 3:21:22.080]  it's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape good health begins with a healthy immune

[3:24:21.600 --> 3:24:27.840]  justice warring that exists in 1984 yes it was the youth leagues they were tasked with
[3:24:27.840 --> 3:24:34.720]  pointing out the moral infractions right pointing out the the harnessing of the youth right like the
[3:24:36.160 --> 3:24:41.840]  youth in mal's revolution right to overthrow the society so that everybody was basically in fear

[3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:53.600]  this in in other countries we see this in the us we see it in any where covet is right now if you
[3:24:53.600 --> 3:24:58.320]  can wrap people out for covet you can wrap people out for their infractions right deplat from them
[3:24:58.320 --> 3:25:04.160]  for social justice violations at the same time as we're told there's no such thing as right and wrong
[3:25:04.160 --> 3:25:10.320]  there's no good and evil that's a fiction but it's wrong right to violate the laws of social
[3:25:10.320 --> 3:25:15.440]  justice morality so it makes no sense it's totally it's totally contradictory but that's
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:24.480]  the point of 1984 is that contradictions are truth truth is contradiction truth is whatever
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:29.520]  big brother says it is and that's why again language had to be destroyed language had to be
[3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:36.080]  brought down to a debased level so that you couldn't communicate and you couldn't say anything
[3:25:36.080 --> 3:25:40.960]  objectively true there is no such thing as objectivity other than the objectivity the big
[3:25:40.960 --> 3:25:47.840]  brother says is the case i mentioned perpetual war i mentioned the the fake revolution now
[3:25:47.840 --> 3:25:53.680]  remember that this includes a kind of a fake counter counter revolution and reeducation
[3:25:54.560 --> 3:26:02.480]  Winston is is eventually taken to be reeducated and that's because he had wrong think he had these
[3:26:02.480 --> 3:26:08.640]  ideas that he could learn and discover truth apart from what big brother dictated was the truth
[3:26:09.520 --> 3:26:14.640]  and he's punished for this and it's a collective punishment the rest of the society is in task
[3:26:14.640 --> 3:26:19.760]  with excommunicating and humiliating and and right not having anything to do with him
[3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:27.520]  and so i want to just remember all of the elements right of the strategies of the cold war of
[3:26:27.520 --> 3:26:33.040]  what happens during the periods of the bolshevik revolution of of of communism there they're being
[3:26:33.040 --> 3:26:40.080]  applied now not in a communist way in a strict communist way but in a melding of the two monopoly
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:46.880]  capitalism and the the you could say socialism right marxist collectivism they're being melded
[3:26:46.880 --> 3:26:52.960]  together the worst elements of both of them into today's society and that's why claus is now saying
[3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:59.440]  you can see him talking about right the melding of these these older orders into the new order
[3:26:59.440 --> 3:27:06.000]  right the great reset why is it called a great reset well it's a reset because in the philosophy of the
[3:27:06.880 --> 3:27:12.000]  by shop the luminous right the jacobins they had this idea that we have to have year one
[3:27:13.280 --> 3:27:18.480]  we have to have year one because you can't have a reference to a history that tells you
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:23.680]  something about you your tradition your past because that would be contrary to big brother's
[3:27:23.680 --> 3:27:30.400]  narrative big brother's narrative is that all the past was an oppressor oppressed narrative right
[3:27:31.040 --> 3:27:35.840]  there was an oppressor group we are all the oppressed that's all history is history is one
[3:27:35.840 --> 3:27:39.840]  giant conspiracy theory oh yeah by the way there's no conspiracy theories except what we say are the
[3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:44.720]  conspiracy theories of emmanuel bolstein who doesn't exist and is just completely made up
[3:27:44.720 --> 3:27:50.480]  so there's a controlled chaos and managed crises there's a dialectics there's an austerity that's
[3:27:50.480 --> 3:27:57.280]  enforced upon the population right Winston doesn't have anything but basically cheap viceroy cigarettes
[3:27:57.280 --> 3:28:04.720]  and and victory gin right he's got a rolling blackouts there's all of these kinds of things
[3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:08.880]  that we think of in terms of the shortages that are that are coming now the claus said we would
[3:28:08.880 --> 3:28:14.160]  have now that's kind of stuff is coming here right he's happy to get chocolate like once a
[3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:18.800]  month there's something ridiculous like this right he's constantly in a state of threat
[3:28:18.800 --> 3:28:24.640]  threat fear and anxiety not just from the fake news right because they're constantly told about
[3:28:24.640 --> 3:28:27.920]  how they're going to be attacked at any moment there's going to be war at any moment so they're
[3:28:27.920 --> 3:28:33.360]  always in a agit state of agitation and this throws everybody for a loop as well as at the
[3:28:33.360 --> 3:28:39.280]  same time constantly being surveilled and thus the enforced self-policing right so there's a
[3:28:39.280 --> 3:28:45.280]  psychological component to if you if you know that you're always being watched you will then
[3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:53.040]  train yourself over time to adapt to self-policing it's called entrainment and this occurs via
[3:28:53.040 --> 3:28:58.720]  the studies that were done at the time of jerry ben jeremy bentham and the the social theorists
[3:28:58.720 --> 3:29:04.240]  who concocted the panopticon right which was a prison with a guard tower in the middle who could
[3:29:04.240 --> 3:29:10.560]  see into all the cells of the prisoners around him so this eliminated the need for a huge amount of
[3:29:11.440 --> 3:29:16.240]  jail of guards because if there's just a couple guys up there basically just staring and watching
[3:29:16.240 --> 3:29:23.840]  at all times then what that what they learned was that the prison complex would self-police
[3:29:23.840 --> 3:29:27.440]  over time if they just knew if they just had the psychological thought that they were being
[3:29:27.440 --> 3:29:33.920]  watched at all times over time they would they would be trained to police their own thought and to
[3:29:33.920 --> 3:29:40.000]  police their own speech and actions and that's exactly what's present in 1984 right in fact
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:43.920]  Winston doesn't even necessarily know if at all times there's a person on the other side of the
[3:29:43.920 --> 3:29:50.160]  telescreen watching him but just the thought that there might be is enough right and so as
[3:29:50.160 --> 3:29:54.640]  Winston starts to kind of do things against big brother and he gets a little bit of rebellious
[3:29:54.640 --> 3:29:58.960]  streak we know he starts going after this woman that he falls in love with which is all forbidden
[3:29:58.960 --> 3:30:04.640]  right in this system which one thing that was missed was the total inversion of human biology
[3:30:04.640 --> 3:30:10.960]  and anatomy right so I don't think that even Orwell could have believed that we'd be in a
[3:30:10.960 --> 3:30:17.440]  situation where you know black as white white as black the sky is green to the extent that they
[3:30:17.440 --> 3:30:24.480]  can literally reverse biology and people believe it and enforce it right so there's this you know
[3:30:24.480 --> 3:30:29.200]  sequence as you see there the notes being passed of Winston thinking I'm getting in on the revolution
[3:30:29.200 --> 3:30:32.880]  I'm gonna you know we're gonna we're gonna fight this we're gonna we're gonna see through big
[3:30:32.880 --> 3:30:40.400]  brother's lies let's get the word out right but what Winston hasn't realized is mob psychology
[3:30:40.400 --> 3:30:46.240]  right he hasn't realized he hasn't figured out how the collective has been so demoralized and so
[3:30:46.240 --> 3:30:54.720]  debased right that they are now basically a giant blob army for big brother and from the technocrat
[3:30:54.720 --> 3:31:02.000]  perspective we are seeing this right now right the the half of this country is now a blob army
[3:31:02.000 --> 3:31:08.960]  for this for big brother for O'Brien right for the technocrats because they will believe anything
[3:31:08.960 --> 3:31:13.680]  that they're told now the other half of the population is awake in varying degrees right
[3:31:13.680 --> 3:31:18.720]  it's about half and half and I think that Alex was right that ultimately really all this only makes
[3:31:18.720 --> 3:31:26.560]  sense if we are understanding this as a foreign takedown operation right that they want to destroy
[3:31:26.560 --> 3:31:32.560]  demoralized and takedown this country as well as others because it's one of them not the only one
[3:31:32.560 --> 3:31:40.400]  but one of the main stumbling blocks roadblocks to the full technocratic order and it's not because
[3:31:40.400 --> 3:31:46.560]  they want to empower china or some other country right the long-term goal is the total obliteration
[3:31:46.560 --> 3:31:53.520]  of humanity that's the key here to understand he said well how does that relate to 1984 how does
[3:31:53.520 --> 3:31:58.800]  Winston right how does O'Brien end the story what what does he start telling O'Brien at the end
[3:31:59.440 --> 3:32:08.160]  he says don't you understand that it's anti-logic on purpose it's confusing it's absurd on purpose
[3:32:08.160 --> 3:32:11.600]  you're sitting around trying to figure out why we're doing these things that are absurd
[3:32:11.600 --> 3:32:17.840]  why are we telling you to wear two three ten masks it makes no sense yes exactly it's intended
[3:32:17.840 --> 3:32:22.560]  to not make sense right and i'm sure you've heard alex say this over many years right they're doing
[3:32:22.560 --> 3:32:27.040]  it on purpose because it doesn't make sense and people still can't get this why would they do
[3:32:27.040 --> 3:32:30.960]  something that don't make sense because that's a psychological warfare tactic
[3:32:30.960 --> 3:32:40.400]  it's in this book it's one of the key weapons in O'Brien's arsenal is to get you to do absurd
[3:32:40.400 --> 3:32:44.400]  things right if you if you know about the cold war there's all these stories of people in camps
[3:32:44.400 --> 3:32:52.240]  who are they would be told to do absurd activities i want you to take this pile of rocks and i want
[3:32:52.240 --> 3:32:57.280]  you to spend the entire day moving this pile of rocks over here five feet and then you do that
[3:32:57.280 --> 3:33:02.240]  and then oh thank you uh prison guard i've done it no now i want you to take all those rocks and
[3:33:02.240 --> 3:33:10.000]  move them right back and it's like why and the point is because we say so because it's to train
[3:33:10.000 --> 3:33:16.720]  you to demoralize you to break your will and i was reading about mk alter and i was reading about
[3:33:16.720 --> 3:33:24.480]  some of the studies that were done and how parallel it is to what O'Brien's doing and they say in some
[3:33:24.480 --> 3:33:30.320]  of these mk ultra studies and and the things that Dr. Ewan Cameron did and others is to break the
[3:33:30.320 --> 3:33:36.080]  person's will now everybody knows this goes on in torture scenarios of governments and right
[3:33:36.080 --> 3:33:40.080]  but why do we think it's strange that they wouldn't take all that information and study and research
[3:33:40.080 --> 3:33:44.720]  and apply it to the population of course they are that's we are living in this right now

[3:35:52.760 --> 3:35:55.760]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[3:35:55.760 --> 3:35:58.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:00.000]  I care about beating the new world border.
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:01.840]  And it's because we have so much credibility,
[3:36:01.840 --> 3:36:04.680]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.

[3:36:07.400 --> 3:36:09.600]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[3:36:09.600 --> 3:36:10.800]  But let's just say this.
[3:36:10.800 --> 3:36:12.520]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[3:36:12.520 --> 3:36:15.160]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.

[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:38.120]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.

[3:36:46.240 --> 3:36:48.640]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[3:36:49.920 --> 3:36:53.640]  InfoWars is here because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:36:53.640 --> 3:36:56.280]  That's why I spent our motto for more than 25 years.
[3:36:56.280 --> 3:36:58.840]  And if you research, even the UN's own admissions,
[3:36:58.840 --> 3:37:02.640]  over two billion people on planet Earth out of seven and a half billion
[3:37:02.640 --> 3:37:07.200]  have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[3:37:07.200 --> 3:37:10.120]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food,
[3:37:10.120 --> 3:37:11.440]  isn't in the salt anymore.
[3:37:11.440 --> 3:37:16.680]  Now, regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals.
[3:37:16.680 --> 3:37:18.800]  And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[3:37:18.800 --> 3:37:20.920]  But if you get the proper type of iodine,
[3:37:20.920 --> 3:37:22.600]  there's three types that are good for the body,
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:23.840]  it does amazing things.
[3:37:23.840 --> 3:37:25.440]  It's essential in the body.
[3:37:25.440 --> 3:37:29.080]  But we have our amazing tri-iodine, a big shipment came in
[3:37:29.080 --> 3:37:32.600]  and we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.

[3:37:42.320 --> 3:37:44.600]  and makes it even more powerful to sell at your level.

[3:37:48.680 --> 3:37:51.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:37:58.680 --> 3:38:09.680]  Well, I won't back down.
[3:38:09.680 --> 3:38:13.680]  No, I won't back down.
[3:38:13.680 --> 3:38:14.680]  You can stand.
[3:38:14.680 --> 3:38:15.680]  Welcome back.
[3:38:15.680 --> 3:38:18.680]  No, I'm just kidding.
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:26.680]  I guess I was getting into the psychological warfare in my control, MKUltra,
[3:38:26.680 --> 3:38:29.680]  breaking the will, breaking the spirit of man.
[3:38:29.680 --> 3:38:31.680]  It reminds me again of that quote from Bertrand Russell,
[3:38:31.680 --> 3:38:35.680]  who's in these circles of these technocrats who said that
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:39.680]  the spirit and will of man would have to be broken down.
[3:38:39.680 --> 3:38:42.680]  Which is interesting because if there's no spirit or will of man,
[3:38:42.680 --> 3:38:46.680]  which he also said as a materialist, then why does it have to be broken down?
[3:38:46.680 --> 3:38:51.680]  But he's just expressing that mindset, that metaphysic or that worldview
[3:38:51.680 --> 3:38:54.680]  that O'Brien expresses at the end of the book.
[3:38:54.680 --> 3:38:57.680]  Now, in this last segment, I'm going to get to the crux of the book
[3:38:57.680 --> 3:38:59.680]  and talk about the inner party.
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:03.680]  If you remember over time throughout the story, Winston knows
[3:39:03.680 --> 3:39:06.680]  and learns a little more, a little more, a little more about this inner party
[3:39:06.680 --> 3:39:08.680]  who seems to have all these amenities.
[3:39:08.680 --> 3:39:13.680]  They're radical socialists, equalitarians, yet they have all of these elite amenities.
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:15.680]  It isn't that the case, right?
[3:39:15.680 --> 3:39:19.680]  The socialist leaders are always millionaires, multimillionaires,
[3:39:19.680 --> 3:39:23.680]  billionaires that have offshore accounts, islands, palaces,
[3:39:23.680 --> 3:39:27.680]  but they're socialists and they believe in equality for everyone.
[3:39:27.680 --> 3:39:31.680]  And so he's starting to realize again at every level, it lies in inversion.
[3:39:31.680 --> 3:39:34.680]  Everything is the opposite of what it's supposed to be
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:39.680]  and what it's said to be.
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:43.680]  And then we get to this story about how there's an inner party
[3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:47.680]  and an outer party that he's being introduced to.
[3:39:47.680 --> 3:39:49.680]  Who is the inner party?
[3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:52.680]  Well, isn't it interesting that this matches up almost perfectly
[3:39:52.680 --> 3:39:56.680]  with what Dr. Carol Quigley wrote in The Anglo-American Establishment
[3:39:56.680 --> 3:40:02.680]  about how the Western world was structured in terms of its inner core
[3:40:02.680 --> 3:40:06.680]  of what is called the elect and the elect being, of course,
[3:40:06.680 --> 3:40:11.680]  the top 10, 12 families, banking elites nowadays, right?
[3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:13.680]  The corporate and tech elites.
[3:40:13.680 --> 3:40:19.680]  And those top 10, 12 people and bloodlines and families
[3:40:19.680 --> 3:40:24.680]  are aided by an outer party called helpers.
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:31.680]  The Society of Helpers, the outer crew that serves this inner crew
[3:40:31.680 --> 3:40:35.680]  and the outer crew, the outer party, which Winston,
[3:40:35.680 --> 3:40:38.680]  they don't know what the inner party is up to.
[3:40:38.680 --> 3:40:45.680]  They're intentionally kept at a dumbed-down, propaganda, stupid level
[3:40:45.680 --> 3:40:48.680]  and they simply can't figure it out.
[3:40:48.680 --> 3:40:51.680]  Why can't they figure it out?
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:58.680]  Well, as Winston and O'Brien have this protracted, wild discussion,
[3:40:58.680 --> 3:41:03.680]  Winston is given this opportunity to ask all these questions to Big Brother
[3:41:03.680 --> 3:41:05.680]  and you might think, well, Big Brother's just going to lie to him.
[3:41:05.680 --> 3:41:10.680]  No, he doesn't lie to him because there's a gaslighting phenomenon here
[3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:13.680]  that's so profound and so in your face
[3:41:13.680 --> 3:41:16.680]  that O'Brien literally just tells him the actual truth, right?
[3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:23.680]  So he doesn't have to lie to Winston because he knows that the profound evil
[3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:27.680]  of what O'Brien is doing and what the party is doing
[3:41:27.680 --> 3:41:33.680]  is so astounding that Winston won't have the will and spirit to oppose it
[3:41:33.680 --> 3:41:38.680]  because nobody can see that it's that evil.
[3:41:38.680 --> 3:41:40.680]  So do you see the power in that?
[3:41:40.680 --> 3:41:42.680]  What's the phase at Rudolph House?
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:46.680]  Or Göring that had the famous statement that the lie is so big, right?
[3:41:46.680 --> 3:41:48.680]  Nobody will ever challenge it, right?
[3:41:48.680 --> 3:41:50.680]  Because nobody would think that you would lie that big.
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:41:52.680]  Well, that's kind of what's going on here, right?
[3:41:52.680 --> 3:41:58.680]  Because the society is so duped and so traumatized
[3:41:58.680 --> 3:42:01.680]  that they're demoralized to the point that they can't oppose it.
[3:42:01.680 --> 3:42:05.680]  And in this story, we've passed the point where there could be resistance, right?
[3:42:05.680 --> 3:42:10.680]  The family has been eliminated because the family is obviously a competitive firewall
[3:42:10.680 --> 3:42:13.680]  of a sphere of authority that Big Brother doesn't control.
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:15.680]  So that has to be eliminated, right?
[3:42:15.680 --> 3:42:16.680]  And what are we seeing now?
[3:42:16.680 --> 3:42:19.680]  We're seeing not just the elimination of family but of biology.
[3:42:19.680 --> 3:42:23.680]  But if you think about it, the elimination of biological categories
[3:42:23.680 --> 3:42:27.680]  isn't really an actual elimination of biology.
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:29.680]  It's the control of language.
[3:42:29.680 --> 3:42:33.680]  It's the control of speech, which, if you remember,
[3:42:33.680 --> 3:42:37.680]  we're told in the book in the story that when Newspeak,
[3:42:37.680 --> 3:42:39.680]  the dictionary of Newspeak is complete,
[3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:41.680]  that is the destruction and control of language,
[3:42:41.680 --> 3:42:44.680]  when that's complete, then the revolution is complete.
[3:42:44.680 --> 3:42:49.680]  And you might think, well, why is the revolution complete when it comes to speaking?
[3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:53.680]  Wouldn't it be guns and being out in the street?
[3:42:53.680 --> 3:42:55.680]  No, that's the point.
[3:42:55.680 --> 3:42:57.680]  That's the point O'Brien makes to Winston,
[3:42:57.680 --> 3:43:01.680]  which is that don't you understand that this was all a revolution of the mind?
[3:43:01.680 --> 3:43:04.680]  And they have this amazing discussion towards the end of the book
[3:43:04.680 --> 3:43:06.680]  when Winston's being tortured.
[3:43:06.680 --> 3:43:10.680]  And O'Brien says, there is no individual.
[3:43:10.680 --> 3:43:11.680]  There's only the collective.
[3:43:11.680 --> 3:43:14.680]  The collective has all power.
[3:43:14.680 --> 3:43:20.680]  And so that's why you are depersoned when you are not in line with the collective.
[3:43:20.680 --> 3:43:23.680]  And the collective isn't actually even what all the people say.
[3:43:23.680 --> 3:43:26.680]  The collective is expressed in Big Brother.
[3:43:26.680 --> 3:43:29.680]  So actually Big Brother is just the party.
[3:43:29.680 --> 3:43:31.680]  The collective is just the party.
[3:43:31.680 --> 3:43:36.680]  And he says to O'Brien, the party is what's immortal.
[3:43:36.680 --> 3:43:38.680]  The party is what's eternal.
[3:43:38.680 --> 3:43:41.680]  The party is what is power. It is reality.
[3:43:41.680 --> 3:43:46.680]  Everything that you call the person, the individual, he says none of that even matters.
[3:43:46.680 --> 3:43:49.680]  We don't even acknowledge its existence.
[3:43:49.680 --> 3:43:51.680]  O'Brien silenced him by a movement of the hand.
[3:43:51.680 --> 3:43:55.680]  We control matter because we control the mind.
[3:43:55.680 --> 3:44:00.680]  So he says it doesn't matter what your theory of matter, pun intended, is.
[3:44:00.680 --> 3:44:02.680]  It doesn't matter what you believe about the external world,
[3:44:02.680 --> 3:44:05.680]  what you think about logic, what you think about metaphysics,
[3:44:05.680 --> 3:44:11.680]  but none of that matters. He says because all we have to do is control people's perception of reality
[3:44:11.680 --> 3:44:13.680]  and we control the world.
[3:44:13.680 --> 3:44:15.680]  That's a profound statement.
[3:44:15.680 --> 3:44:19.680]  And we've seen people like Carl Rove, Henry Kissinger echo that, right?
[3:44:19.680 --> 3:44:23.680]  The control of the public's perception is really the control of reality.
[3:44:23.680 --> 3:44:27.680]  For the priests of power, they don't care about the metaphysics of what's true
[3:44:27.680 --> 3:44:30.680]  and let's get out there and solve the secrets of nature.
[3:44:30.680 --> 3:44:32.680]  They only care about solving the secrets of nature.
[3:44:32.680 --> 3:44:37.680]  Insofar as they're useful to the power structure to control the mind.
[3:44:37.680 --> 3:44:40.680]  And that's what O'Brien says.
[3:44:40.680 --> 3:44:44.680]  He says, reality is inside your skull, Winston.
[3:44:44.680 --> 3:44:47.680]  And you're going to learn that there is no law of nature.
[3:44:47.680 --> 3:44:49.680]  We make the laws of nature.
[3:44:49.680 --> 3:44:52.680]  And so Winston is confused by this because he thinks,
[3:44:52.680 --> 3:44:55.680]  well, you don't control the external world.
[3:44:55.680 --> 3:44:57.680]  You don't literally control the laws of nature.
[3:44:57.680 --> 3:44:58.680]  They are without you.
[3:44:58.680 --> 3:45:02.680]  And O'Brien replies by saying, no, no, did you not hear what I said?
[3:45:02.680 --> 3:45:05.680]  He says, have you forgotten your double think?
[3:45:05.680 --> 3:45:09.680]  He says, the universe, it may be out there, but we don't care.
[3:45:09.680 --> 3:45:16.680]  Because what we're concerned with is the control of your perception of the universe.
[3:45:16.680 --> 3:45:22.680]  And as long as we control that perception, it doesn't matter what is actually going on out there.
[3:45:22.680 --> 3:45:30.680]  Thus, that's the sense in which O'Brien says, we, the party, make the laws of nature.
[3:45:30.680 --> 3:45:34.680]  You probably heard about Soviet science or Lysenko or these kinds of things.
[3:45:34.680 --> 3:45:36.680]  Well, those are examples of this.
[3:45:36.680 --> 3:45:41.680]  And people nowadays kind of look back and we laugh at how silly it was for the Soviet scientists.
[3:45:41.680 --> 3:45:43.680]  They got everybody to believe this, right?
[3:45:43.680 --> 3:45:47.680]  Or the Teutonic philosophy of the superiority of some German tribe.
[3:45:47.680 --> 3:45:49.680]  How do people believe this?
[3:45:49.680 --> 3:45:54.680]  Well, now we live in a situation where we're told the exact same types of lies.
[3:45:54.680 --> 3:45:57.680]  It's just a different lie and everybody believes it, right?
[3:45:57.680 --> 3:46:00.680]  Because everybody believes that we are just simply to trust the science.
[3:46:00.680 --> 3:46:03.680]  There's no better example of trust the science, right?
[3:46:03.680 --> 3:46:06.680]  Dr. Fauci saying, I am science.
[3:46:06.680 --> 3:46:09.680]  That's what O'Brien says.
[3:46:09.680 --> 3:46:11.680]  Do you see this?
[3:46:11.680 --> 3:46:13.680]  This is O'Brien level stuff.
[3:46:13.680 --> 3:46:15.680]  He's saying, I'm the science.
[3:46:15.680 --> 3:46:18.680]  If you define me, you're defined science.
[3:46:18.680 --> 3:46:23.680]  That's like straight out of O'Brien's playbook.
[3:46:23.680 --> 3:46:26.680]  Wow, right?
[3:46:26.680 --> 3:46:32.680]  And Winston says, so you're telling me basically a form of solipsism.
[3:46:32.680 --> 3:46:36.680]  And this is the philosophy that all that exists is what's in your mind.
[3:46:36.680 --> 3:46:39.680]  And O'Brien says, no, no, no, you must understand me.
[3:46:39.680 --> 3:46:41.680]  You're still thinking in terms of philosophy.
[3:46:41.680 --> 3:46:45.680]  And he says, Winston, metaphysics is not your strong point.
[3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:50.680]  Because you're missing the point that I'm making, which is far more simpler than you're making it, right?
[3:46:50.680 --> 3:46:53.680]  Which is, again, it's not a theory of what's out there in the world.
[3:46:53.680 --> 3:46:59.680]  It's just a theory of mind control, you see.
[3:46:59.680 --> 3:47:00.680]  What does Fauci say?
[3:47:00.680 --> 3:47:02.680]  Fauci says, you just do what I say.
[3:47:02.680 --> 3:47:04.680]  Just do what we say.
[3:47:04.680 --> 3:47:09.680]  Just take your damn shot, right?
[3:47:09.680 --> 3:47:13.680]  So again, it's not a philosophy system that's out there to discover truth.
[3:47:13.680 --> 3:47:18.680]  It's trying to figure out a consistent logical approach to the world and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3:47:18.680 --> 3:47:21.680]  All that stuff O'Brien just laughs at, right?
[3:47:21.680 --> 3:47:28.680]  And this is why, in my view, O'Brien is really one of the greatest villains in all of fiction.
[3:47:28.680 --> 3:47:35.680]  Because what he says is so horrible, so horrifying, so terrifying, and so plausibly real
[3:47:35.680 --> 3:47:42.680]  that that makes him far greater a villain than anyone like Darth Vader or whatever, right?
[3:47:42.680 --> 3:47:46.680]  And then it moves into the torture and the power is pain, pain is power.
[3:47:46.680 --> 3:47:49.680]  You cannot have family, you cannot have free associations.
[3:47:49.680 --> 3:47:52.680]  We will decide that you are a heretic.
[3:47:52.680 --> 3:47:59.680]  And he basically is couched as kind of religious, right?
[3:47:59.680 --> 3:48:07.680]  The big party is likened to God in this final great discourse between O'Brien and Winston.
[3:48:07.680 --> 3:48:12.680]  And he says, basically, you are no more than an animal in our zoo.
[3:48:12.680 --> 3:48:15.680]  You are no more than a test subject in a lab.
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:17.680]  The world is our lab.
[3:48:17.680 --> 3:48:22.680]  You're an animal test subject in that lab and you will dutifully do what you're told, right?
[3:48:22.680 --> 3:48:23.680]  And what happens?
[3:48:23.680 --> 3:48:27.680]  Of course, the story is a great warning tell because Winston goes through this process.
[3:48:27.680 --> 3:48:31.680]  He rats out his girlfriend and basically he finally learns to love Big Brother.
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:35.680]  And so this conditioning process, right, it works.
[3:48:35.680 --> 3:48:37.680]  And that's what we have to be aware of.
