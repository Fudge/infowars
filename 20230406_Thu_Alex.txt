[00:00.000 --> 00:03.520]  We posted this online so that people can contact these people.
[00:03.520 --> 00:04.520]  Let them know.
[00:04.520 --> 00:05.520]  Let them know.
[00:05.520 --> 00:07.480]  Do you want informed consent or do you want them to sell out to the lobbyists?
[00:07.480 --> 00:12.640]  Tom Renz, a patriotic American freedom fighting lawyer, has been sounding the alarm on the
[00:12.640 --> 00:19.760]  awareness of Missouri House Bill 1169, a bill that merely requires the labeling of products
[00:19.760 --> 00:26.360]  that can alter your genetics, requires companies to share info on transmissibility of gene
[00:26.360 --> 00:31.960]  altering interventions, and also requires fully informed consent to be given for any
[00:31.960 --> 00:38.160]  vaccine gene therapy or medical intervention, a crucial bill template that should have passed
[00:38.160 --> 00:40.880]  years ago in every U.S. state.
[00:40.880 --> 00:47.500]  Yet the rhinos in Missouri, led by the Democrats and Republican House Speaker Dean Ploecher,
[00:47.500 --> 00:53.500]  are slow-walking Missouri House Bill 1169 through committee to prevent it from being
[00:53.500 --> 00:55.860]  approved this session.
[00:55.860 --> 01:01.780]  Missouri lawmakers are claiming that the labeling requirements would be different from other
[01:01.780 --> 01:07.060]  states, and they are worried it might scare people to know the truth.
[01:07.060 --> 01:10.480]  Passing good bills to protect Missouri farmers.
[01:10.480 --> 01:13.980]  As Renz points out, the answer is the lobbyists.
[01:13.980 --> 01:20.700]  Big Pharma has no legitimate basis for publicly arguing against an informed consent disclosure
[01:20.700 --> 01:25.060]  bill, so they have tried to get the agriculture lobby to do their dirty work.
[01:25.060 --> 01:31.540]  This is also because the agricultural bioengineers and Big Pharma are one in the same.
[01:31.540 --> 01:37.780]  Bayer Big Pharma owns Monsanto, which is one of the largest seed producers in the world.
[01:37.780 --> 01:44.540]  Big Pharma does not want people to know they're going to use food to alter their genetics.
[01:44.540 --> 01:45.900]  It's two pages, by the way.
[01:45.900 --> 01:49.440]  No writers, no jokes, nothing, just very straightforward.
[01:49.440 --> 01:50.440]  You can read it.
[01:50.440 --> 01:52.780]  It's House Bill 1169 in Missouri.
[01:52.780 --> 01:56.300]  This has become the most contentious bill in Missouri history.
[01:56.300 --> 02:01.500]  The mRNA gene therapy type drugs, and by the way, when I say that, just for anybody that
[02:01.500 --> 02:03.900]  doesn't know, I have Moderna's documents.
[02:03.900 --> 02:05.420]  They call it a gene therapy.
[02:05.420 --> 02:09.300]  They've been working on it for more than at least two decades.
[02:09.300 --> 02:12.580]  So what they did was they went to the egg community.
[02:12.580 --> 02:18.340]  They went to Missouri Cattlemen's Association, the Missouri Corn Growers Association, Missouri
[02:18.340 --> 02:23.620]  Pork Association, Farm Bureau, soybean growers.
[02:23.620 --> 02:27.340]  They went to these guys and said, hey, we need you to oppose this.
[02:27.340 --> 02:32.860]  Now, remember, the two largest holders of egg in this country are Bill Gates and the
[02:32.860 --> 02:33.860]  CCP.
[02:33.860 --> 02:36.240]  The vaccine rollout is now a failure.
[02:36.240 --> 02:40.000]  They're not getting food to people like you and me and our friends.
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.420]  They're not able to get this material into people's veins with a needle.
[02:44.420 --> 02:48.180]  So now they'll go to Plan B and try to get it into our bodies with the food supply.
[02:48.180 --> 02:52.540]  The globalists don't want the United States to exist, let alone be strong.
[02:52.540 --> 02:59.380]  I'm looking at all these, you know, food processing plants going up in fire and flames and trains
[02:59.380 --> 03:00.380]  derailing.
[03:00.380 --> 03:06.660]  I mean, this never happened before 2020 in the United States, vanishingly rare.
[03:06.660 --> 03:11.660]  Doc P here, up here in the north side of the Ohio River.
[03:11.660 --> 03:12.780]  Understand this.
[03:12.780 --> 03:13.980]  This country is under attack.
[03:13.980 --> 03:15.700]  Our food source is under attack.
[03:15.700 --> 03:17.340]  This is unconventional warfare stuff.
[03:17.500 --> 03:21.300]  This has gone beyond just fifth generation warfare.
[03:21.300 --> 03:24.580]  This is a straight up attack on our very existence.
[03:24.580 --> 03:28.380]  We need to understand that and we need to be serious about it, have solutions.
[03:28.380 --> 03:34.160]  In 1992, Morris Strong, secretary general of the UN Earth Summit and member of the Club
[03:34.160 --> 03:38.780]  of Rome said, it is clear that current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent middle
[03:38.780 --> 03:46.180]  class involving high meat intake, consumption of large amounts of frozen convenience foods,
[03:46.180 --> 03:53.220]  use of fossil fuels, ownership of motor vehicles, small electrical appliances, home and workplace
[03:53.220 --> 04:00.020]  air conditioning and suburban housing are not sustainable.
[04:00.020 --> 04:01.900]  Point is, this all fits together, right?
[04:01.900 --> 04:08.140]  Like take over the farmland, buy up the farmland, leave people unable to grow their own food,
[04:08.140 --> 04:11.860]  raise their own cattle, raise their own sheep, whatever it is.
[04:11.860 --> 04:17.220]  And then you have to eat the Frankenfood that, you know, has been bought up and contaminated
[04:17.220 --> 04:21.380]  at the levels that you're describing by Bill Gates, by China.
[04:21.380 --> 04:22.540]  It's horrific.
[04:22.540 --> 04:27.660]  To the silent majority, it has never been clear that the New World Order is blitzkrieging
[04:27.660 --> 04:30.620]  and kamikazing from every direction.
[04:30.620 --> 04:36.980]  While Obama's legalized propaganda machine keeps the neural pathways of the willing minority
[04:36.980 --> 04:43.220]  gaslit and sedated, maintaining the psyop that silent weapons of mass disruption and
[04:43.220 --> 04:48.660]  extinction aren't waging a quiet war on an unsuspecting humanity.
[04:48.660 --> 04:53.660]  If Hitler was still around, he'd be sitting back thinking, I didn't need bullets for a
[04:53.660 --> 04:54.660]  global takeover.
[04:54.660 --> 04:56.100]  And he'd be right.
[04:56.100 --> 04:57.860]  John Bowne reporting.
[04:57.860 --> 05:01.680]  Bingo, bingo, bingo.
[05:01.680 --> 05:09.040]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[05:09.040 --> 05:15.960]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024
[05:15.960 --> 05:16.960]  shirt.
[05:16.960 --> 05:19.400]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[05:19.400 --> 05:23.600]  This is an idea the crew had to have a triggering shirt, kind of next level.
[05:23.600 --> 05:24.960]  Alex Jones is right.
[05:24.960 --> 05:26.360]  There's Infowars.com in the back.
[05:26.360 --> 05:29.320]  Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[05:29.320 --> 05:30.320]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[05:30.320 --> 05:31.640]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[05:31.640 --> 05:32.960]  It's high quality.
[05:32.960 --> 05:36.400]  And it is a exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com.
[05:36.400 --> 05:38.220]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[05:38.220 --> 05:43.960]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts.
[05:43.960 --> 05:47.680]  And we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like minded
[05:47.680 --> 05:51.000]  people and you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.000]  No way.
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  No way.
[05:53.000 --> 05:54.000]  That's a bridge too far.
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.480]  That's no, it can't be.
[05:55.480 --> 06:00.280]  And I said on national television that he was going to win at Infowarsstore.com.
[06:01.640 --> 06:14.440]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:14.440 --> 06:19.760]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[06:19.760 --> 06:31.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Thursday, April 6th, 2023.
[06:31.600 --> 06:33.560]  Worldwide transmission.
[06:33.560 --> 06:35.640]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:35.640 --> 06:39.560]  All right, I'm going to be here for the next three hours.
[06:39.560 --> 06:44.680]  And then the amazing, informative, fiery dynamic, Drew Hernandez, one of my favorite talk show
[06:44.680 --> 06:50.440]  hosts, one of the smartest people I know will be, he's also a pastor, will be hosting the
[06:50.440 --> 06:52.320]  fourth hour today.
[06:52.320 --> 06:58.360]  So that'll be an hour long information news sermon that I'll definitely be tuning into
[06:58.360 --> 07:01.600]  while I get things done in the fourth hour around the office.
[07:01.600 --> 07:06.240]  And of course, I'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. as well with a weekday show and
[07:06.240 --> 07:11.920]  then this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. bare minimum, probably do a special Saturday show as well.
[07:11.920 --> 07:13.920]  Okay, here's what I want to do today.
[07:13.920 --> 07:22.840]  I've cleared the decks of guests and I want to take a smorgasbord of calls from the listeners,
[07:22.840 --> 07:29.640]  first time callers, on any topic you want to raise, any topic you want to discuss.
[07:29.640 --> 07:33.640]  But I'm going to cover news for the first 30 minutes or so, throw some of the topics
[07:33.640 --> 07:38.440]  out there, then give the number out and have open lines, intersperse with news and breaking
[07:38.440 --> 07:42.600]  information as it all unfolds.
[07:42.600 --> 07:47.120]  But wow, is the news not completely insane.
[07:47.120 --> 07:53.440]  Now we've been focused a lot on the Trump deep state coup and we'll cover a lot of those
[07:53.440 --> 07:54.740]  developments here today, obviously.
[07:54.740 --> 08:00.440]  But while we've been watching that, what one hand's doing, the other hand's been doing
[08:00.440 --> 08:03.080]  this.
[08:03.080 --> 08:04.920]  We'll cover this next segment.
[08:04.920 --> 08:06.160]  Here we go again.
[08:06.160 --> 08:14.180]  Dr. Fauci was at a town hall with Jim Acosta three days ago and said there will absolutely
[08:14.180 --> 08:18.620]  be an outbreak of another pandemic and maybe next year.
[08:18.620 --> 08:23.700]  Can a Republican DA please indict this death doctor and find out what he knows?
[08:23.700 --> 08:29.100]  Now we actually know that they created the virus years before they released it.
[08:29.100 --> 08:33.220]  It was a big scandal in 2015 when Obama had it developed by Fauci.
[08:33.220 --> 08:36.480]  It's a weak version of super powerful versions they've got.
[08:36.480 --> 08:40.100]  They've also got weaponized Marburg ready to release that kills 90% of those that are
[08:40.100 --> 08:41.100]  infected.
[08:41.100 --> 08:46.940]  That makes us about 95 times stronger than the COVID variant that was first put out.
[08:46.940 --> 08:48.080]  They created the whole deal.
[08:48.080 --> 08:49.080]  They gained a function.
[08:49.080 --> 08:51.600]  It's all been out for three years.
[08:51.600 --> 08:57.580]  I had the man, the professor that authored the chemical and biological weapons laws that
[08:57.580 --> 09:03.200]  are on the books today in the United States and helped write the world treaties on in
[09:03.200 --> 09:15.440]  February and March of 2020 detailing absolutely every facet of this.
[09:15.440 --> 09:20.840]  They did the CRISPR gene editing scan, knew how it was manmade and knew exactly who made
[09:20.840 --> 09:26.580]  it and then slowly over the years mainstream news has to admit it's true.
[09:26.580 --> 09:30.960]  After years of them blocking even questioning did it come out of a lab, but it came out
[09:30.960 --> 09:39.840]  of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, came out of the University of Texas and it was then
[09:39.840 --> 09:45.640]  fenced into China to be released so they could have plausible deniability that they did it.
[09:45.640 --> 09:50.280]  And I hate communist China, but they didn't release this and you've even seen top scientists
[09:50.280 --> 09:57.680]  in Redfield and all of them say this came out of US labs because they know the Pentagon
[09:57.680 --> 09:59.960]  was instructed to build it by Obama.
[09:59.960 --> 10:06.680]  They did the Pentagon, put the grants out through the NIH and others, and then the Pentagon
[10:06.680 --> 10:13.000]  ran the fear campaign, the sensor campaign, the force injection campaign, and not an enemy
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.240]  of our military, but the Pentagon has been seized by the globalists and is in control.
[10:20.240 --> 10:22.840]  So you have Robert Kennedy Jr. saying that.
[10:23.440 --> 10:30.680]  You have Dr. Peter McCullough saying it, but you had countless others saying it and the
[10:30.680 --> 10:35.080]  evidence coming out in the emails and documents and meetings of congressional hearings, but
[10:35.080 --> 10:43.480]  we had Dr. Francis Boyle on three plus years ago, dozens of times, he was on a couple times
[10:43.480 --> 10:50.160]  a week for months, specifically giving you the entire battle plan of the enemy.
[10:50.160 --> 10:58.880]  So when Fauci says an imminent new virus is coming out like he did in 2017, that Trump
[10:58.880 --> 11:05.040]  will be challenged by a novel virus that will change society forever, they had the gun loaded
[11:05.040 --> 11:09.720]  and pointed at our head and they pulled the trigger.
[11:09.720 --> 11:18.100]  So that's just one of these articles that we're going to be going over today.
[11:18.100 --> 11:24.700]  Then obviously we've got the issue of Alvin Bragg, out of all the horrible Soros DAs,
[11:24.700 --> 11:25.700]  he's one of the worst.
[11:25.700 --> 11:30.380]  The one in Austin literally calls people at meetings comrades and is a communist, and
[11:30.380 --> 11:35.700]  he let two people that shot a whole bunch of folks last year on Sixth Street just out
[11:35.700 --> 11:40.140]  of jail in a couple days, just, oh, you shot a bunch of people, you're being released.
[11:40.140 --> 11:43.380]  They had a Soros DA in Fort Worth.
[11:43.380 --> 11:51.640]  Remember the 17 year old black man, black teenager, shot and critically wounded three
[11:51.640 --> 11:54.720]  people and he was out the next day.
[11:54.720 --> 12:00.100]  So as long as you're black or brown, you're allowed to commit crime.
[12:00.100 --> 12:04.980]  And I got a bunch of clips today, including the mayor of Chicago.
[12:04.980 --> 12:12.260]  You thought the last mayor, what a clown, Lightfoot, Admiral Ackbar, it's a trap, if
[12:12.260 --> 12:17.080]  you thought she was bad, the new guy is a Marxist-Leninist who says the police should
[12:17.080 --> 12:21.500]  have no jurisdiction over brown people.
[12:21.500 --> 12:26.860]  White people can be policed, but brown people should not have any police period, which is
[12:26.860 --> 12:28.980]  a way to kill a lot of brown people.
[12:28.980 --> 12:35.380]  I mean, the main victim of black crime are black people, especially in Chicago.
[12:35.380 --> 12:41.760]  What a, oh, but that's your civil right to not have the police respond, okay.
[12:41.760 --> 12:47.600]  Newly elected Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, said black people should not face state sponsored
[12:47.600 --> 12:48.600]  policing.
[12:48.600 --> 12:50.700]  He wants his own leftist police.
[12:50.700 --> 12:53.440]  That's what communists do.
[12:53.440 --> 12:55.220]  So we're going to be going over that.
[12:55.220 --> 13:01.420]  That ties into study, over 72% of New York City violent crime suspects freed without
[13:01.420 --> 13:04.280]  bail go on to commit more crimes.
[13:04.280 --> 13:05.280]  And it is crazy.
[13:05.280 --> 13:10.600]  And when I say crazy, we read articles and see stories 20 years ago out of Australia
[13:10.600 --> 13:17.000]  or the UK where somebody breaks in your house, assaults you, you kill them or fight them
[13:17.000 --> 13:18.000]  off, you go to jail.
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.200]  Well, it just happened in New York last week.
[13:20.200 --> 13:21.200]  In fact, I forgot to cover that.
[13:21.200 --> 13:26.760]  You guys print me the article about the parking garage attendant charged with attempted murder
[13:26.760 --> 13:31.600]  and illegal possession of the gun because he took the gun away from the guy that shot
[13:31.600 --> 13:34.360]  him and shot him.
[13:34.360 --> 13:37.320]  I mean, I know that doesn't even make it through your brain.
[13:37.320 --> 13:39.040]  My brain doesn't process that either.
[13:39.040 --> 13:40.040]  Right.
[13:40.040 --> 13:41.040]  Someone's robbing cars.
[13:41.040 --> 13:42.040]  You go up and talk to them.
[13:42.040 --> 13:43.040]  They shoot you.
[13:43.040 --> 13:44.040]  You take the gun away and shoot them.
[13:44.040 --> 13:45.040]  You go to prison.
[13:45.040 --> 13:47.360]  Yes, I just said that.
[13:47.360 --> 13:52.600]  That's who has charged the 45th president of the United States with an indictment that
[13:52.600 --> 13:53.600]  doesn't allege crimes.
[13:53.600 --> 14:00.040]  It says you covered up other crimes, but does it say what the other crimes are?
[14:00.040 --> 14:06.200]  Absolutely dumbfounding, flabbergasting, poleaxed.
[14:06.200 --> 14:07.280]  And then we've got more video.
[14:07.280 --> 14:13.160]  White House press secretary says it's not for us to decide if killing Christian children
[14:13.160 --> 14:14.160]  constitutes a hate crime.
[14:14.160 --> 14:20.280]  But she did say last week that the attack shows that there is a suppression of our trans
[14:20.280 --> 14:21.360]  people.
[14:21.360 --> 14:27.500]  And Biden said trans are the soul of the country.
[14:27.500 --> 14:28.960]  That more election meddling.
[14:28.960 --> 14:32.040]  ABC News blurs out Trump donation number.
[14:32.040 --> 14:36.960]  They don't do that for Democrats.
[14:36.960 --> 14:39.680]  Oh, I.
[14:39.680 --> 14:45.200]  Already it's being reported around the country that literally no one is buying Budweiser
[14:45.200 --> 14:46.200]  or Bud Light.
[14:46.200 --> 14:49.920]  You shouldn't buy any Anheuser-Busch products ever anyway, it's a globalist company.
[14:49.920 --> 14:51.760]  But they advertise, we're the common man.
[14:51.760 --> 14:53.160]  We're the average Joe.
[14:53.160 --> 14:55.160]  We're red, white and blue.
[14:55.160 --> 15:01.560]  Yeah, maybe 20 years ago, Budweiser is a globalist company and they hired the lunatic Dylan
[15:01.600 --> 15:05.920]  Mulvaney and you know, to be the woman of the year and all the rest of it.
[15:05.920 --> 15:08.680]  She's a woman of the year about a bunch of publications and said, this is what a woman
[15:08.680 --> 15:09.680]  is.
[15:09.680 --> 15:15.280]  Well, now Nike has piled on and is mocking women at sponsoring transgender activists
[15:15.280 --> 15:18.480]  promote sports bra.
[15:18.480 --> 15:22.320]  So this is all just the psy-op to destroy the country.
[15:22.320 --> 15:24.360]  And yes, why would Nike destroy themselves?
[15:24.360 --> 15:27.000]  Why would Anheuser-Busch destroy themselves?
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.440]  Because they're all weapons systems.
[15:28.440 --> 15:32.800]  The Rothschilds and Rockefellers have quadrillions in money.
[15:32.800 --> 15:36.280]  Why would Hollywood commit suicide with all the things they've done that made people hate
[15:36.280 --> 15:37.280]  them?
[15:37.280 --> 15:38.680]  Because everything is being weaponized.
[15:38.680 --> 15:44.080]  The NFL, the NBA, children's programming, education, the medical system.
[15:44.080 --> 15:49.480]  It's all a weaponized attack on America to take us down so there's no example of freedom.
[15:49.480 --> 15:50.480]  Period.
[15:50.480 --> 15:52.840]  The corporations are at war with you.
[15:52.840 --> 15:53.840]  Period.
[15:53.840 --> 15:54.840]  We'll be right back.
[15:54.840 --> 15:55.320]  Stay with us.
[15:58.440 --> 16:03.160]  I'm a banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[16:03.160 --> 16:11.040]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[16:11.040 --> 16:14.680]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[16:14.680 --> 16:17.760]  Alex has been right on toward over a decade.
[16:17.760 --> 16:24.440]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down, Alex Jones was right.
[16:24.440 --> 16:25.760]  Think about how frustrated we are.
[16:25.760 --> 16:31.520]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[16:31.520 --> 16:34.800]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[16:34.800 --> 16:35.800]  Years ago.
[16:35.800 --> 16:39.640]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[16:39.640 --> 16:42.160]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[16:42.160 --> 16:44.600]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[16:44.600 --> 16:47.920]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[16:47.920 --> 16:52.320]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[16:55.760 --> 17:08.560]  I intend to take the Infowars armored truck out or the Infowars tank, as it's so lovingly
[17:08.560 --> 17:09.560]  called.
[17:09.560 --> 17:11.920]  You came through yesterday and shopped at Infowarsstore.com.
[17:11.920 --> 17:13.360]  So I'm going to be able to take the truck out.
[17:55.760 --> 18:02.720]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[18:02.720 --> 18:07.600]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny.
[18:07.600 --> 18:10.020]  And that war is something that we can win.
[18:10.020 --> 18:11.600]  But it takes dedication.
[18:11.600 --> 18:12.960]  It takes commitment.
[18:12.960 --> 18:17.680]  That's why I asked listeners respectfully to go to Infowarsstore.com and buy great products
[18:17.680 --> 18:23.680]  that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[18:23.680 --> 18:29.080]  Infowarsstore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset in the War
[18:29.080 --> 18:30.080]  of the World.
[18:30.080 --> 18:35.640]  Ultimate Bone Broth, Back in Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's
[18:35.640 --> 18:39.520]  the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[18:39.520 --> 18:42.280]  It's all available at Infowarsstore.com.
[18:42.280 --> 18:43.280]  Some of the very best products.
[18:43.280 --> 18:45.680]  And a lot of you have never shopped at Infowarsstore.
[18:45.680 --> 18:46.680]  You've been watching for years.
[18:46.680 --> 18:51.080]  You've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to Infowarsstore.
[18:51.080 --> 18:53.840]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[18:53.840 --> 18:55.220]  Plus they keep us on air.
[18:55.220 --> 18:56.720]  So again, please take action.
[18:56.720 --> 18:58.600]  Go to Infowarsstore.com today.
[18:58.600 --> 18:59.880]  And I thank you.
[18:59.880 --> 19:04.240]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border, exposing the cartels and like
[19:04.240 --> 19:08.080]  coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug
[19:08.080 --> 19:09.240]  addicts and criminals.
[19:09.240 --> 19:12.460]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[19:12.460 --> 19:14.260]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[19:14.260 --> 19:16.240]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[19:16.240 --> 19:19.120]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[19:19.120 --> 19:20.920]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[19:20.920 --> 19:23.480]  And again, I have Infowars to thank for that.
[19:23.480 --> 19:27.520]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[19:27.520 --> 19:33.040]  I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the Infowars
[19:33.040 --> 19:34.040]  team.
[19:34.040 --> 19:39.400]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to get these types of clips because Alex's
[19:39.400 --> 19:44.320]  whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses
[19:44.320 --> 19:45.320]  to.
[19:45.320 --> 19:47.200]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[19:47.200 --> 19:50.840]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[19:50.840 --> 19:54.520]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on
[19:54.520 --> 20:01.520]  in my career.
[20:01.520 --> 20:07.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:17.200 --> 20:21.480]  Shooter Jennings and the Summer Rage bring in a scene.
[20:21.480 --> 20:27.520]  I inspired this great album more than 13, 14 years ago and it predicted the police state
[20:27.520 --> 20:28.520]  we now live in.
[20:28.520 --> 20:29.520]  Chaos is hanging around.
[20:29.520 --> 20:30.520]  A tree to the ground shuttered from the sound.
[20:30.520 --> 20:31.520]  The death machine.
[20:31.520 --> 20:32.520]  The death machine ain't slowing down.
[20:32.520 --> 20:33.520]  It's gaining power.
[20:33.520 --> 20:52.360]  And the song gets into forced injections and vaccines.
[20:52.360 --> 21:11.920]  You and I, they will forcibly vaccinate and put us in the mass graves.
[21:11.920 --> 21:21.200]  They're preparing us for an all out police state, the entire world being put into artificial
[21:21.200 --> 21:25.920]  upheaval, turmoil, and revolution to bring in the New World Order.
[21:25.920 --> 21:31.160]  You'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, and you will be happy.
[21:31.160 --> 21:35.920]  You will eat the bugs.
[21:35.920 --> 21:39.440]  All right.
[21:39.440 --> 21:44.520]  All of this information is a theme of the globalists attacking us through asymmetrical
[21:44.520 --> 21:47.160]  fifth, sixth generational warfare.
[21:47.160 --> 21:53.560]  All of it to undermine society, to create a new dark age, except for high tech reservations,
[21:53.560 --> 21:58.320]  the globalist corporations and governments will control.
[21:58.320 --> 22:01.000]  And I'm going to tie the poison shots into what they call fluoride.
[22:01.000 --> 22:02.000]  It's more than fluoride.
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.560]  It's like the so-called vaccine isn't a classic vaccine.
[22:05.560 --> 22:07.440]  It's an MRNA function.
[22:07.440 --> 22:10.740]  Well, a gene therapy, it's the same thing with the fluoride.
[22:10.740 --> 22:16.500]  It's hundreds of toxic chemicals, up to 300 on average, about 380 plus that are in some
[22:16.500 --> 22:21.520]  of the samples that have been tested that are dumped in your municipal water supply,
[22:21.520 --> 22:23.500]  and it lowers fertility and lowers IQ.
[22:23.500 --> 22:28.860]  And since fluoridation began in 47, IQ has dropped more than 20 points on average in
[22:28.860 --> 22:29.860]  the United States.
[22:29.860 --> 22:35.500]  They've got IQ tests they've done in towns in the UK, only about 20% of the UK is fluoridated.
[22:35.500 --> 22:41.740]  People that live there over several generations have lower IQs than those nearby, and they're
[22:41.740 --> 22:42.740]  less fertile.
[22:42.740 --> 22:45.480]  This is a weapon system.
[22:45.480 --> 22:49.560]  The globalists want to dumb down the West, impoverish the West, destroy us, so we're
[22:49.560 --> 22:55.400]  not seen as something to aspire to by the third world that's been totally enslaved.
[22:55.400 --> 23:03.820]  Now, if you go back to early 2017, Trump had gotten into office, and Fauci got up and said
[23:03.820 --> 23:08.300]  Trump will be challenged by a new virus, a new pandemic.
[23:08.300 --> 23:12.760]  And we now know that he engineered it and it all prepared with Obama and the deep state.
[23:12.760 --> 23:13.760]  That's all come out even in Congress.
[23:13.760 --> 23:16.660]  We're going to play that clip in a moment.
[23:16.660 --> 23:23.320]  Now he's come out in yet another cryptic statement three days ago on April 3rd.
[23:23.320 --> 23:25.280]  We're going to play that in a moment.
[23:25.280 --> 23:27.040]  But first, here he is in 2017.
[23:27.040 --> 23:32.120]  I have been around for a while and have had the opportunity and the privilege and the
[23:32.120 --> 23:37.280]  pleasure of serving in five administrations.
[23:37.280 --> 23:42.000]  I thought I would bring that perspective to the topic today, is the issue of pandemic
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.360]  preparedness.
[23:44.360 --> 23:50.440]  And if there's one message that I want to leave with you today based on my experience,
[23:50.440 --> 23:56.300]  and you'll see that in a moment, is that there is no question that there will be a challenge
[23:56.300 --> 24:01.480]  to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious
[24:01.480 --> 24:07.300]  diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease, and we have certainly a large burden of that,
[24:07.300 --> 24:09.820]  but also there will be a surprise outbreak.
[24:09.820 --> 24:16.460]  And I hope by the end of my relatively short presentation, you will understand why history,
[24:16.460 --> 24:22.420]  the history of the last 32 years that I've been the director of NIAID will tell the next
[24:22.420 --> 24:27.900]  administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind that they will be faced with the challenges
[24:27.900 --> 24:30.860]  that their predecessors were faced with.
[24:30.860 --> 24:35.020]  So for those who think that infectious diseases is gone, there's so many people who've made
[24:35.020 --> 24:38.460]  foolhardy statements not knowing at the time.
[24:38.460 --> 24:41.620]  So they love to tell you what they're going to do and telegraph it to their minions because
[24:41.620 --> 24:44.320]  they all celebrate in the open criminal announcement.
[24:44.320 --> 24:46.180]  So there's even worse clips than that.
[24:46.180 --> 24:51.060]  Two years before the outbreak, he's on C-SPAN with all the different federal heads of agencies,
[24:51.060 --> 24:56.060]  Health and Human Services, EPA, FDA, heads of universities, and he says, we're going
[24:56.060 --> 25:01.240]  to need a new virus, probably out of China, something like bird flu to blow up the old
[25:01.240 --> 25:05.580]  system where it doesn't take years to get a shot approved, and we're just going to roll
[25:05.580 --> 25:10.380]  all the mRNA out and take over.
[25:10.380 --> 25:11.700]  So that's what they've done.
[25:11.700 --> 25:15.700]  Now they're like, oh, we've got mRNA for cancer and mRNA for depression, and oh, it's just
[25:15.700 --> 25:16.700]  everything.
[25:16.700 --> 25:17.700]  It's so wonderful.
[25:17.700 --> 25:18.700]  It's totally safe, though we're not going to test it.
[25:18.700 --> 25:22.520]  And all the real studies show it hurts you.
[25:22.520 --> 25:23.520]  So here we go again.
[25:23.520 --> 25:32.100]  Now this is him on television, April 3rd, bragging, saying there will absolutely be
[25:32.100 --> 25:34.300]  an outbreak of another pandemic.
[25:34.300 --> 25:35.300]  It may be next year.
[25:35.300 --> 25:36.300]  Here it is.
[25:36.300 --> 25:42.580]  So if we really want to prevent the next pandemic, and there will be one, there will absolutely
[25:42.580 --> 25:45.300]  be an outbreak of another pandemic.
[25:45.300 --> 25:50.660]  It may be next year, or it may be in your grandparent, your grandchildren, and your
[25:50.660 --> 25:52.900]  great grandchildren's lifetime.
[25:52.900 --> 25:53.900]  We don't know.
[25:53.900 --> 25:56.220]  So now he's being a little more couched.
[25:56.220 --> 26:00.620]  Now again, documentaries have been made, books have been written.
[26:00.620 --> 26:02.740]  We've done thousands of shows on this.
[26:02.740 --> 26:03.740]  We have his emails.
[26:03.740 --> 26:04.740]  We have the witnesses.
[26:04.740 --> 26:05.740]  We have the documents.
[26:05.740 --> 26:06.740]  We have the congressional testimony.
[26:06.740 --> 26:07.740]  They created it.
[26:07.740 --> 26:13.920]  They released it to then roll out the solution that's even worse, the poison shots.
[26:13.920 --> 26:15.340]  But what is next year?
[26:15.340 --> 26:17.380]  That's the election year.
[26:17.380 --> 26:24.780]  When did Alvin Bragg request the judge to launch the eight week trial, he estimates,
[26:24.780 --> 26:30.960]  of Trump at the beginning of the primaries, right through primary season, to dominate
[26:30.960 --> 26:32.700]  the news coverage?
[26:32.700 --> 26:34.420]  All a big production.
[26:34.420 --> 26:38.420]  Now, since I mentioned the fluoride, here's some of the reports on it.
[26:38.420 --> 26:43.460]  Report linking fluoride to lower IQ in children made public after CDC, HHS tried to block
[26:43.460 --> 26:44.460]  it.
[26:44.460 --> 26:48.700]  It's a report from the bureaucrats and the government looking at 50 plus years of studies
[26:48.700 --> 26:56.060]  and current new studies and showing neurotoxicity, not to mention attacks on fertility, increased
[26:56.060 --> 26:58.900]  bone cancer, the list goes on and on.
[26:58.900 --> 27:07.540]  Now you need a little bit of calcium fluoride as a trace element in your food and it's very
[27:07.540 --> 27:08.980]  good for you.
[27:08.980 --> 27:10.660]  A very small amount.
[27:10.660 --> 27:13.280]  Look the studies up and it's naturally in the water.
[27:13.280 --> 27:16.240]  It's naturally in some foods.
[27:16.240 --> 27:18.140]  On average, I saw a study last year.
[27:18.140 --> 27:26.300]  What is put in one brand of powdered eggs, wait for this, is over a million times what
[27:26.300 --> 27:33.100]  your daily allowance of calcium fluoride is.
[27:33.100 --> 27:39.900]  Now, what they call fluoride in the water, and anybody can just look this up, there's
[27:39.900 --> 27:45.980]  been even national news casts admitting it of all places, is dozens, hundreds, or up
[27:45.980 --> 27:51.280]  to 380 plus chemicals, one batch out of China got studied over a decade ago.
[27:51.280 --> 27:56.420]  We had Dr. Conant, who was head of the whole university department at the time, in toxicology
[27:56.420 --> 28:04.820]  came on in chemistry and they looked at just one of the main companies we buy quote fluoride
[28:04.820 --> 28:12.320]  from from China, it's their toxic waste, it had 380 plus, remember he says 383 chemicals
[28:12.320 --> 28:18.080]  including lead, mercury, arsenic, the list went on and on.
[28:18.080 --> 28:24.120]  And the type of fluoride it has in it is hydrofluoroacic acid, I always butcher that,
[28:24.120 --> 28:31.440]  hydrofluoroacic acid, which again has been made highly toxic and highly reactive in the
[28:31.440 --> 28:32.440]  body.
[28:32.440 --> 28:38.680]  It's an acid, one of the most dangerous and dissolved body parts, but that's just one
[28:38.680 --> 28:39.680]  of the deadly ingredients.
[28:39.680 --> 28:44.520]  We'll talk about this when we come back and HHS, the admiral, the dude that says he's
[28:44.520 --> 28:51.600]  a lady, he is very handsome, I will say that, joking, looks like a child molester, I'm not
[28:51.600 --> 28:55.080]  saying he is, he just wants to have access to your children and sterilize them, which
[28:55.080 --> 28:56.080]  is worse.
[28:56.080 --> 28:59.640]  We'll be right back to talk about this on the other side.
[28:59.640 --> 29:04.520]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot, because
[29:04.520 --> 29:08.240]  they knew that that would help Trump, didn't they know this would backfire?
[29:08.240 --> 29:11.500]  We were waiting for the mugshot, we learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made
[29:11.500 --> 29:17.740]  our own, and it says political prisoner, with an image of president Trump, the shirt
[29:17.740 --> 29:22.340]  is being printed now in Texas, it will be shipping out to you in one week.
[29:22.340 --> 29:28.580]  Political prisoner, with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background, it's a
[29:28.580 --> 29:33.660]  fundraiser shirt, it says infoawards.com on the back of the shirt.
[29:33.660 --> 29:36.780]  We also have Alex Jones for president, no I'm not running for president, it's a really
[29:36.780 --> 29:41.460]  nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white and blue, Alex Jones for president, 2024,
[29:41.460 --> 29:45.940]  it's a fun conversational piece, and a limited edition shirt, great way to fund the operation,
[29:45.940 --> 29:54.140]  so get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at infoawardstore.com, or by
[29:54.140 --> 29:56.740]  calling toll free, triple A, 253-3139.
[29:56.740 --> 30:04.900]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had, I don't think anybody can deny
[30:04.900 --> 30:09.300]  it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[30:09.300 --> 30:13.340]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[30:13.340 --> 30:19.620]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison
[30:19.620 --> 30:24.140]  Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven
[30:24.140 --> 30:29.260]  days a week, it's really just incredible, so for myself and the whole Info Wars crew,
[30:29.260 --> 30:33.940]  I thank you for your past support, and I want to encourage you now to realize that Info
[30:33.940 --> 30:38.240]  Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us, I know you spread the word, I know you
[30:38.240 --> 30:42.280]  pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners, never
[30:42.280 --> 30:46.400]  go to infoawardstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your
[30:46.400 --> 30:50.800]  life, all at the same time keep us on air, I know that less than one percent of our listeners
[30:50.800 --> 30:55.320]  actually go buy products at infoawardstore.com, if just one percent more of you took action
[30:55.320 --> 30:58.960]  and went to infoawardstore.com, our funding problems will be over, please take action
[30:58.960 --> 30:59.960]  now.
[30:59.960 --> 31:07.960]  I intend to take the Info Wars armored truck out, or the Info Wars tank as it's so lovingly
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.000]  called, you came through yesterday and shopped at infoawardstore.com, so I'm going to be
[31:12.000 --> 31:19.000]  able to take the truck out.
[31:37.960 --> 31:44.960]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to infoawardstore.com
[31:44.960 --> 31:51.960]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[31:51.960 --> 32:11.300]  and your body, and keep us on air. I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and
[32:11.300 --> 32:15.660]  listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to mfolarstore.com.
[32:15.660 --> 32:18.400]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast, vast, vast amount of people that have gone to M.
[32:18.400 --> 32:28.840]  Folar Store.com and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[32:28.840 --> 32:32.640]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show, that's great
[32:32.640 --> 32:36.920]  and I thank you. But we need funds to operate, plus we've got really great products that
[32:36.920 --> 32:41.080]  do amazing things for people like our CBD oil, and our fizzy magnesium, and our sleep
[32:41.080 --> 32:45.520]  aid, and our nitric oxide, and our real red pill plus, all of these are really great products
[32:45.520 --> 32:48.920]  that keep us on air. Plus, you're missing out on having these products. So get off the
[32:48.920 --> 32:54.320]  bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to mfolarstore.com right now and get
[32:54.320 --> 33:04.280]  these great M. Folar's products at mfolarstore.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[33:04.280 --> 33:11.280]  new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:11.280 --> 33:28.280]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show.
[33:28.280 --> 33:34.320]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday transmission. Alright, let's
[33:34.320 --> 33:44.120]  talk about absolute bonafide proof these people are out to get us. Since the mid-1940s, mainline
[33:44.120 --> 33:49.080]  scientists said you should not put what they call fluoride in the water. It gives you dental
[33:49.080 --> 33:55.600]  fluorosis, it gives you bone cancer, it attacks fertility, it lowers IQs, it is highly toxic,
[33:55.600 --> 34:03.900]  and it is an adjuvant in that it is an acid that helps bring toxins through the blood
[34:03.900 --> 34:11.480]  brain barrier. It supercharges death. And you can go to Google even and type in Harvard
[34:11.480 --> 34:18.240]  studies confirm fluoride lowers IQ. There are literally thousands of them. They know
[34:18.240 --> 34:23.600]  exactly what they're doing. In fact, the most popular fluoride until about 30 years ago,
[34:23.600 --> 34:32.160]  when they banned it, was fluoride. And you'd just sprinkle it on the ground and roaches
[34:32.160 --> 34:41.840]  would walk through it, lick their feet, and die. So this is an extreme, extreme poison,
[34:41.840 --> 34:46.840]  ladies and gentlemen. And under federal law, they're allowed to put hundreds and hundreds
[34:46.840 --> 34:56.720]  of toxins in it and call it fluoride. There's one Harvard study, impact on fluoride and
[34:56.720 --> 35:03.800]  neurological development in children. 2012, massive IQ reduction. That was a condensed
[35:03.800 --> 35:19.120]  27-study group. Now they looked at over 200 studies and found cancer infertility lowered
[35:19.120 --> 35:28.680]  IQ, and the list goes on and on. But that's okay because we have the deputy head of HHS,
[35:28.680 --> 35:37.400]  Trani, HHS head, hides report on fluoride toxicity in children. The story is on Infowars.com
[35:37.400 --> 35:45.160]  and Band.video on the Red Pill TV channel. But because it's an admiral and a beautiful
[35:45.160 --> 35:52.760]  woman who does want to keep secret gender transition brainwashing for elementary students,
[35:52.760 --> 36:02.760]  and a wonderful, creepy person, it's okay because, well, that's what Rachel Levine says.
[36:02.760 --> 36:11.040]  So Rachel Levine tried to hide the report. And here's where you can read about it. Report
[36:11.040 --> 36:16.440]  leaking fluoride to lower IQ in children made public after CDC, HHS tried to block it. The
[36:16.440 --> 36:20.840]  good news is they're not blocking it. It's like they tried to block the Pfizer internal
[36:20.840 --> 36:27.320]  study that it was killing a bunch of people with the so-called COVID shot. A top HHS official
[36:27.320 --> 36:33.040]  blocked release of long delayed fluoride toxicity review, internal emails reviewed for over
[36:33.040 --> 36:39.360]  a year and a half. Health officials delayed report leaking fluoride to brain harm. This
[36:39.360 --> 36:49.920]  is Mother Jones. This is mainstream news reporting this. Yahoo Finance suppressed government
[36:49.920 --> 36:57.280]  report finding fluoride can reduce children's IQ made public under EPA lawsuit. So we have
[36:57.280 --> 37:03.140]  to sue to get the government's own reports. But I just showed you university government
[37:03.140 --> 37:18.740]  reports from 12 years ago saying the same thing. Dental fluorosis, cancer, lowered IQ,
[37:18.740 --> 37:27.180]  infertility. These are weapons systems being used against us. And look, I know as an audience
[37:27.180 --> 37:32.060]  of great activists who are the engine behind our success, warning humanity know that, but
[37:32.060 --> 37:38.280]  the general public still doesn't get it. And there have been hundreds of national news
[37:38.280 --> 37:43.260]  stories attacking me over the last 20 years or so. Didn't happen the first nine years
[37:43.260 --> 37:48.980]  of my operation. Jones is insane. He says the tap water is not safe. You should filter
[37:48.980 --> 37:53.460]  it. He just wants to make money. Well, absolutely. I want to sell the highest rated water filters
[37:53.460 --> 38:00.380]  that will cut all of this crap out because it's something good to sell you. Like selling
[38:00.380 --> 38:04.240]  somebody when their 16 year old gets a car. Hey, you should buy one of these used Volvos.
[38:04.240 --> 38:09.880]  They're very safe. I mean, if I was going to sell cars, I'd try to sell a moral vehicle
[38:09.880 --> 38:15.480]  that was a good vehicle and that was reliable and that was safe. I'm not going to say what
[38:15.480 --> 38:21.820]  brand of car my wife drives, but I drive American cars. But when I drive my daughter, I get
[38:21.820 --> 38:27.260]  in my wife's car. I like a dangerous American car that's like a tinfoil can, but it goes
[38:27.260 --> 38:33.100]  250 miles an hour. Don't drive my six year old daughter in it. I get in my wife's European
[38:33.100 --> 38:39.480]  car that has a double steel titanium cage in it. And one day when I wasn't in the car,
[38:39.480 --> 38:44.660]  a idiot woman in a Jeep hit my wife and daughter going about 60 miles an hour when she was
[38:44.660 --> 38:53.260]  at a red light in the back and it broke one of the steel cages, bent it in about half
[38:53.260 --> 39:03.640]  a foot and the Jeep was crushed three feet back in. Now, I'm only using that as an allegory
[39:03.640 --> 39:11.360]  to break down the fact that we want to protect our children as much as we can. These people
[39:11.360 --> 39:19.420]  are bombarding our children with these weapons. So yes, we sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made
[39:19.420 --> 39:23.660]  by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group. It's been around about 15 years, became the
[39:23.660 --> 39:27.700]  biggest company in the last six. They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the
[39:27.700 --> 39:32.480]  fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price. And they made it
[39:32.480 --> 39:39.180]  as good in all the studies. It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[39:39.180 --> 39:42.380]  But you can go pay two or three times. There's four or five other filters out there that
[39:42.380 --> 39:48.000]  are just as good. We sell, and it's not a plug here, it is, but it's really about reality.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.640]  The very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of leading competitor.
[39:52.640 --> 39:59.240]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[39:59.240 --> 40:02.600]  You should also filter your shower water. That's another way you absorb this crap. But
[40:02.600 --> 40:08.440]  I'm done talking about that. The point is you can get the filters at m4store.com. They're
[40:08.440 --> 40:12.160]  discounted right now, finally back in stock. All the supply chain breakdowns, they've been
[40:12.160 --> 40:18.280]  sold out for six months. These people are out to get you, and you can't just sit there
[40:18.280 --> 40:24.800]  and let them do this to you. You can't just not mitigate it. It's like not owning a gun
[40:24.800 --> 40:30.160]  in a high crime area. You're crazy. You need to filter your water. You need to know how
[40:30.160 --> 40:34.040]  to use a gun. You need to not eat a bunch of GMO. You need to get sunshine. You need
[40:34.040 --> 40:37.400]  to take your vitamins. And I'm not up here preaching at you. I'm just saying God's given
[40:37.400 --> 40:44.580]  us ways to mitigate it. But think about the level of premeditated evil to get up there
[40:44.580 --> 40:48.000]  and all the TV programs and all the stuff you've seen, not just having me, but everybody
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.960]  else saying no, it's conspiracy theorists, even back to Dr. Strangelove in 1964. The
[40:53.960 --> 40:59.800]  water's safe. You should drink it. No, it's not. It's not safe anywhere, even in farming
[40:59.800 --> 41:04.280]  areas with wells. It's full of glyphosate. It's full of Roundup. It's full of crap. And
[41:04.280 --> 41:11.560]  that's what's killing us. But I'm the bad guy for telling you to protect yourself. They're
[41:11.560 --> 41:16.960]  the good guys telling you there's no problem and suppressing reports that they know one
[41:16.960 --> 41:22.400]  of the biggest causes of cancer and low IQ and infertility is the so-called fluoride
[41:22.400 --> 41:32.720]  that is weaponized, concentrated, electrified, acid-based molecule that if you take pure
[41:32.720 --> 41:38.920]  fluoride and you stick your hand in it for two seconds, when you pull your hand out,
[41:38.920 --> 41:45.040]  all the skin is going to slide right off it to the muscle. If you've got the power and
[41:45.040 --> 41:49.360]  the willpower to stick your hand in that fluoride for three minutes, your arm's going to fall
[41:49.360 --> 41:55.600]  off when you pull it out with the bone sticking out. We've had the engineers on that have
[41:55.600 --> 42:00.400]  seen it. You can throw a dead rat in the pool of fluoride. They all got to be wearing mask
[42:00.400 --> 42:05.740]  and full hazmat gear. They've done it. There's been demonstrations of it. That rat is dissolved
[42:05.740 --> 42:16.080]  in three minutes. Hydrofluorosolic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, the most
[42:16.080 --> 42:22.080]  powerful. It's like the movie Alien. When you cut it and that stuff drips out, that's
[42:22.080 --> 42:28.880]  what we're talking about. In fact, it eats through metal and concrete in minutes. And
[42:28.880 --> 42:36.440]  they've got our children drinking that. This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed,
[42:36.440 --> 42:41.820]  out to get you and your family. And now they're putting the GMO shots in the cows that it
[42:41.820 --> 42:46.560]  breeds in their meat. You eat the meat there. We've got to stop them. We're talking more
[42:46.560 --> 42:49.960]  about their weapon systems. Get the number out when we come back. We've got big news
[42:49.960 --> 42:55.400]  on the trans cult, not just Budweiser pushing it. Now it's Nike. This is going to be critical
[42:55.400 --> 42:57.120]  information. Stay with us.
[42:59.800 --> 43:04.680]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because
[43:04.680 --> 43:08.960]  they knew that that would help Trump. Didn't they know this would backfire? We were waiting
[43:08.960 --> 43:13.200]  for the mugshot. We learned today they wouldn't have it. So we've made our own. And it says
[43:13.200 --> 43:19.920]  political prisoner with an image of President Trump. The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[43:19.920 --> 43:25.340]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week. Political prisoner with Trump on the front
[43:25.340 --> 43:30.660]  there in a mugshot jail background. It's a fundraiser shirt. It says info wars dot
[43:30.660 --> 43:35.780]  com on the back of the shirt. We also have Alex Jones for president. No, I'm not running
[43:35.780 --> 43:39.820]  for president. It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white and blue. Alex
[43:39.820 --> 43:44.420]  Jones for president 24. It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt. Great way
[43:44.420 --> 43:51.660]  to fund the operation. So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at
[43:51.660 --> 43:57.660]  info war store dot com or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one
[43:57.660 --> 44:03.300]  three nine. Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels
[44:03.300 --> 44:07.140]  in like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out
[44:07.140 --> 44:11.580]  with drug addicts and criminals. And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical
[44:11.580 --> 44:15.860]  spill. Are you addicted to the danger? Savannah, have you ever considered that for a second?
[44:15.860 --> 44:20.780]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the truth. And again,
[44:20.900 --> 44:24.980]  you know, I have info wars to thank for that. Looking back on the day I was able to ask
[44:24.980 --> 44:29.700]  President Donald Trump two questions. I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was
[44:29.700 --> 44:34.380]  classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info wars team. I really do credit that
[44:34.380 --> 44:39.820]  as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips because Alex's whole mentality
[44:39.820 --> 44:45.020]  was, you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses to. So it's not
[44:45.020 --> 44:48.980]  that I'm addicted to the insanity. I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping
[44:48.980 --> 44:53.260]  the American people. And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that
[44:53.260 --> 44:56.260]  within me early on in my career.
[44:59.260 --> 45:03.260]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[45:03.260 --> 45:07.260]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[45:07.260 --> 45:10.260]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[45:10.260 --> 45:12.260]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[45:12.260 --> 45:15.260]  This is a different kind of war.
[45:15.540 --> 45:19.540]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and computer hosts.
[45:19.540 --> 45:23.540]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[45:23.540 --> 45:27.540]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[45:27.540 --> 45:31.540]  It was almost as if it were a plan in place. It just tanked him.
[45:31.540 --> 45:34.540]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[45:35.540 --> 45:37.540]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[45:37.540 --> 45:39.540]  They are nothing but distractions.
[45:39.540 --> 45:43.540]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[45:43.820 --> 45:47.820]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[45:47.820 --> 45:50.820]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset,
[45:50.820 --> 45:54.820]  the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[45:59.820 --> 46:03.820]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[46:03.820 --> 46:05.820]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[46:05.820 --> 46:09.820]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[46:10.100 --> 46:12.100]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars,
[46:12.100 --> 46:15.100]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[46:15.100 --> 46:19.100]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[46:19.100 --> 46:21.100]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[46:21.100 --> 46:23.100]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[46:23.100 --> 46:25.100]  five, six, seven days a week,
[46:25.100 --> 46:27.100]  it's really just incredible.
[46:27.100 --> 46:29.100]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew,
[46:29.100 --> 46:31.100]  I thank you for your past support
[46:31.100 --> 46:33.100]  and I want to encourage you now to realize
[46:33.100 --> 46:37.100]  that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[46:37.100 --> 46:39.100]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us.
[46:39.380 --> 46:40.380]  It's wonderful to keep doing it.
[46:40.380 --> 46:43.380]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarsstore.com
[46:43.380 --> 46:46.380]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[46:46.380 --> 46:48.380]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[46:48.380 --> 46:50.380]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[46:50.380 --> 46:52.380]  actually go buy products at infowarsstore.com.
[46:52.380 --> 46:56.380]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarsstore.com,
[46:56.380 --> 46:58.380]  our funding problems will be over.
[46:58.380 --> 47:00.380]  Please take action now.
[47:00.380 --> 47:05.380]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[47:05.380 --> 47:07.380]  it's Alex Jones.
[47:09.100 --> 47:11.100]  Thank you for your time.
[47:39.100 --> 47:43.100]  You can find the archive or the live feed at infowars.com or Bandaw Video.
[47:43.100 --> 47:47.100]  We're also showing some B-roll footage of when we got a tour
[47:47.100 --> 47:49.100]  of the Austin Water Treatment Plant.
[47:49.100 --> 47:52.100]  They said no cameras, but we secretly shot all of it.
[47:52.100 --> 47:54.100]  We'll go back to that here in just a moment.
[47:54.100 --> 47:57.100]  I'll show you the same signs I'm about to show you right now.
[47:57.100 --> 47:59.100]  But look at this.
[47:59.100 --> 48:04.100]  This is a material safety data sheet that I have here in front of me.
[48:04.100 --> 48:08.100]  MSDS is a document that details the hazardous components of a product.
[48:08.100 --> 48:10.100]  Its characteristics, effects on human health,
[48:10.100 --> 48:13.100]  as well as its handling precautions.
[48:13.100 --> 48:19.100]  And this is the data sheet for hydrofluorosolic acid or acid-based fluoride.
[48:19.100 --> 48:24.100]  Health hazard, highest rating for deadly.
[48:24.100 --> 48:28.100]  Number three, extreme danger, hazardous.
[48:28.100 --> 48:31.100]  And it's listed at a four.
[48:31.100 --> 48:34.100]  It's an oxidizer, an acid.
[48:35.100 --> 48:37.100]  It's explosive.
[48:37.100 --> 48:39.100]  And it goes on and on and on.
[48:39.100 --> 48:41.100]  May deteriorate.
[48:41.100 --> 48:43.100]  Shock and heat.
[48:43.100 --> 48:45.100]  Violent chemical change.
[48:45.100 --> 48:47.100]  Unstable.
[48:47.100 --> 48:59.100]  So that's what Rachel Levine, the admiral, says is good for you.
[48:59.100 --> 49:03.100]  And something that you need to drink if you're the children.
[49:03.100 --> 49:07.100]  So it wants to cut your children's testicles and penises and breasts off.
[49:07.100 --> 49:11.100]  Because it's a program of sterilization and death
[49:11.100 --> 49:15.100]  that they make fancy and cool and fun and are right.
[49:15.100 --> 49:18.100]  And they're suppressing what the fluoride does to you and your family,
[49:18.100 --> 49:22.100]  as I showed you last segment.
[49:22.100 --> 49:26.100]  But you can see the ratings on it right there.
[49:26.100 --> 49:36.100]  The highest level danger ratings listed on it for toxicity and poison.
[49:36.100 --> 49:39.100]  Now, let's continue.
[49:42.100 --> 49:44.100]  What is this?
[49:44.100 --> 49:46.100]  This is a weapon system.
[49:46.100 --> 49:49.100]  They didn't have guided missiles in Japan.
[49:49.100 --> 49:54.100]  The Germans had just invented them with the V1 and V2s and V6.
[49:54.100 --> 49:58.100]  But they had humans that could fly the planes into our aircraft carriers.
[49:58.100 --> 50:03.100]  Anybody can type in the Lexington aircraft carrier that survived more than 30 kamikazes.
[50:03.100 --> 50:05.100]  It's now in Corpus Christi, Texas.
[50:05.100 --> 50:07.100]  You can see it.
[50:07.100 --> 50:10.100]  And the kamikazes flying into the aircraft carriers, flying into the ships.
[50:10.100 --> 50:13.100]  There they are flying into the Lexington's.
[50:13.100 --> 50:15.100]  The Grey Ghost, as she's called.
[50:15.100 --> 50:20.100]  They tried to sink it in World War II in Vietnam and couldn't.
[50:20.100 --> 50:25.100]  And when you see Nike destroying itself, endorsing Kaepernick,
[50:25.100 --> 50:30.100]  and endorsing woman of the year being a man,
[50:30.100 --> 50:35.100]  when you see Budweiser and Bud Light doing it, you think, this is crazy.
[50:35.100 --> 50:37.100]  The central banks have quadrillions.
[50:37.100 --> 50:39.100]  They control all the money.
[50:39.100 --> 50:47.100]  And so they don't care if they ruin the NFL or the NBA or Hollywood or Nike or Anheuser-Busch
[50:47.100 --> 50:52.100]  because they have unlimited money to just stand up new groups and new organizations.
[50:52.100 --> 50:54.100]  Disney doesn't care.
[50:54.100 --> 50:56.100]  They want to destroy every franchise.
[50:56.100 --> 50:58.100]  They want to destroy Star Wars.
[50:58.100 --> 51:00.100]  It's a cultural takeover.
[51:00.100 --> 51:02.100]  It's scorched earth.
[51:02.100 --> 51:04.100]  It's information warfare.
[51:04.100 --> 51:06.100]  And so you ask, why do they destroy themselves?
[51:06.100 --> 51:08.100]  Suddenly they admit.
[51:08.100 --> 51:10.100]  I've got articles right here.
[51:10.100 --> 51:12.100]  And people shot video in Austin and other areas.
[51:12.100 --> 51:14.100]  I've got that in the stack.
[51:15.100 --> 51:19.100]  And there's giant piles of Anheuser-Busch and Bud Light.
[51:19.100 --> 51:21.100]  No one's buying it.
[51:21.100 --> 51:23.100]  They keep restocking it because used to they were.
[51:23.100 --> 51:27.100]  And there's just huge piles of it everywhere because three days after,
[51:27.100 --> 51:30.100]  they made some crazy dude saying he's a woman.
[51:30.100 --> 51:36.100]  They're spokesmen, men who mainly drink that beer because they think it's blue collar and tough.
[51:36.100 --> 51:38.100]  No, I'm never drinking that again.
[51:38.100 --> 51:40.100]  Why would they do it?
[51:40.100 --> 51:42.100]  Because it's a weapons system.
[51:42.100 --> 51:46.100]  And I knew when this happened last Friday or last Saturday, I said, watch.
[51:46.100 --> 51:54.100]  All the other big corporations will now hire the same individual and make Dylan Mulvaney the spokesperson.
[51:54.100 --> 51:58.100]  So now Knight came out and said, man, let's join that.
[52:01.100 --> 52:17.100]  And let's immediately, as fast as we can, hire him to do this so that Knight can get on board and everybody else can get on board.
[52:17.100 --> 52:23.100]  So you're just totally overwhelmed with this lunatic colonizing women's spaces,
[52:23.100 --> 52:30.100]  knowing full well, obviously a comedian, that he's getting massive money to play along with the system as a mercenary.
[52:30.100 --> 52:36.100]  They want it as revolting and ridiculous and as mindless as possible.
[52:36.100 --> 52:41.100]  Knight's accused of mocking women, we're going to play the clip in a moment with audio,
[52:41.100 --> 52:45.100]  after sponsoring transgender activists to promote sports bra.
[52:46.100 --> 52:48.100]  And we're live right now.
[52:48.100 --> 52:53.100]  I didn't send the clips to the crew, but in post, when this is posted to me in that video, it's actually over here in the stack.
[52:53.100 --> 52:55.100]  I want to add the photos and videos.
[52:55.100 --> 53:03.100]  Not a Kid Rock blowing up the mud light, but of Austin and H-E-B and the giant piles of the Budweiser products that nobody's buying.
[53:03.100 --> 53:04.100]  We'll add that in post.
[53:04.100 --> 53:06.100]  We don't have it, but it'll be added in post.
[53:06.100 --> 53:10.100]  But everybody knows it's piling up everywhere, so we'll have that later added to this.
[53:10.100 --> 53:20.100]  So here is the video of Dylan Mulvaney running around saying he's officially a sponsor or being sponsored by Nike.
[53:41.100 --> 53:43.100]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:43.100 --> 53:45.100]  Again, this is a weapon system.
[53:48.100 --> 53:59.100]  When you go to the gun store and you buy a box of .357 Magnum or 9mm or .308, whether you're shooting out of a handgun or rifle,
[53:59.100 --> 54:03.100]  you know when you shoot that at a target or at a deer, it's gone.
[54:04.100 --> 54:08.100]  But if you had unlimited money, you could fire as much ammunition as you wanted.
[54:08.100 --> 54:15.100]  And that's what the trans agenda and the fluoride and Mulvaney and the fentanyl and the open borders
[54:15.100 --> 54:20.100]  and all the shows showing men being idiots and men not being the leader of the household.
[54:21.100 --> 54:29.100]  All of this is unlimited ammunition with unlimited money to take every institution and demoralize you and break your will.
[54:29.100 --> 54:31.100]  The NFL's gone.
[54:32.100 --> 54:36.100]  The NBA's gone. Hollywood was always gone, basically.
[54:38.100 --> 54:45.100]  And so they just think once they overwhelm you with every institution pushing this, you'll finally roll over and give up.
[54:45.100 --> 54:59.100]  Instead, you have to simply reject all of these institutions and realize they are captured, controlled institutions,
[54:59.100 --> 55:07.100]  and you've got to support the independent new institutions that aren't controlled by the globalists who can't be bought
[55:07.100 --> 55:14.100]  and who won't back down because you can't make us run and you can't starve us out.
[55:14.100 --> 55:20.100]  You can't starve us out and you can't make us run because these old boys were raised on shotguns.
[55:20.100 --> 55:26.100]  We say grace. We say amen. And if you ain't into that, we don't give a damn.
[55:26.100 --> 55:29.100]  Our morals and what we stand for is king.
[55:29.100 --> 55:34.100]  But you've got to realize the power you've got in this fight to hold the line.
[55:34.100 --> 55:36.100]  We're winning, but just barely.
[55:36.100 --> 55:43.100]  They've got all the ammunition and all the money, but we've got our wills and our souls that can't be bought.
[55:43.100 --> 55:49.100]  Once they get the cash of society in, shutting down all the farms, they think they can starve us into submitting to them.
[55:49.100 --> 55:54.100]  That's why we all start producing food and our own systems, so that we're not under their control.
[55:54.100 --> 55:58.100]  And that's why you support independent media like mfoawastore.com.
[55:58.100 --> 56:03.100]  DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ10 cleans out your mitochondria, your cells, makes your telomeres last longer.
[56:03.100 --> 56:05.100]  Doesn't make them grow, makes them not shrink as fast.
[56:05.100 --> 56:07.100]  That's the fountain of youth, as low as you're going to get.
[56:07.100 --> 56:09.100]  40% off, despite the fact it's selling out.
[56:09.100 --> 56:13.100]  Real Red Pill Plus, super powerful formula with a plug loan and more.
[56:13.100 --> 56:15.100]  Energizes your natural hormones in a natural way.
[56:15.100 --> 56:18.100]  Great for women, great for men, especially folks that are over 40.
[56:18.100 --> 56:20.100]  Incredible, couldn't operate without it.
[56:20.100 --> 56:23.100]  40% off, despite the fact it's selling out.
[56:24.100 --> 56:34.100]  And yes, very excited that the Trump mugshot t-shirt we have and the Alex Jones for President shirt are doing extremely well.
[56:34.100 --> 56:38.100]  We have in stock the Alex Jones for President. We're printing.
[56:38.100 --> 56:41.100]  It'll go out very, very soon. We say three weeks on the side.
[56:41.100 --> 56:43.100]  It's coming in next week. It's being printed right now in Texas.
[56:43.100 --> 56:46.100]  But we say three weeks on there, you know, just to be safe.
[56:46.100 --> 56:48.100]  But you will get yours first.
[56:48.100 --> 56:51.100]  mfoawastore.com. Trump as a political prisoner.
[56:51.100 --> 56:53.100]  mfoawastore.com on the back.
[56:53.100 --> 56:56.100]  Be sure and get that. We have our Ultimate Krill Oil.
[56:56.100 --> 56:59.100]  It's the highest grade of krill oil you're going to find.
[56:59.100 --> 57:01.100]  It's in stock, ready to ship to you.
[57:01.100 --> 57:03.100]  Also, 40% off.
[57:03.100 --> 57:12.100]  mfoawastore.com or 888-253-3139.
[57:12.100 --> 57:40.100]  Alright, your calls coming up next hour at 877-789-2539.
[57:40.100 --> 57:45.100]  First time callers only 877-789-2539.
[57:45.100 --> 57:46.100]  Stay with us.
[58:11.100 --> 58:14.100]  Alex Jones was right.
[58:14.100 --> 58:17.100]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[58:17.100 --> 58:21.100]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[58:21.100 --> 58:25.100]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[58:25.100 --> 58:29.100]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax. Not for a second.
[58:29.100 --> 58:32.100]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[58:32.100 --> 58:34.100]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[58:34.100 --> 58:37.100]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[58:37.100 --> 58:39.100]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[58:39.100 --> 58:42.100]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[58:50.100 --> 58:53.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World,
[58:53.100 --> 58:56.100]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words,
[58:56.100 --> 58:59.100]  plan for our future, that is a hellish future.
[58:59.100 --> 59:03.100]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books I guess, they're starting to ban them,
[59:03.100 --> 59:06.100]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World
[59:06.100 --> 59:09.100]  at bookstores, Amazon or Infowarsware.com.
[59:09.100 --> 59:12.100]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[59:12.100 --> 59:15.100]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[59:15.100 --> 59:17.100]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[59:17.100 --> 59:20.100]  So get your copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World,
[59:20.100 --> 59:23.100]  a signed copy at Infowarsware.com.
[59:23.100 --> 59:27.100]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[59:27.100 --> 59:30.100]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[59:30.100 --> 59:33.100]  you'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[59:33.100 --> 59:36.100]  Those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[59:36.100 --> 59:39.100]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet,
[59:39.100 --> 59:42.100]  to go to Infowarsware.com and get a signed copy
[59:42.100 --> 59:45.100]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[59:45.100 --> 59:47.100]  or give them to the local school.
[59:47.100 --> 59:50.100]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[59:51.100 --> 59:56.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[59:56.100 --> 59:58.100]  it's Alex Jones.
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:04.100]  Because you can't start us out and you can't make us run
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.100]  Those once and more boys raised on shotgun
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.100]  Listen to this carefully.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.100]  We say praise and we say man
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:16.100]  If you ain't into that we don't give a damn
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:21.100]  We came from the West Virginia coal mines
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.100]  And the rocky mountains
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:26.100]  And the western skies
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.100]  We can skin a buck
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.100]  And we can skin a buck
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.100]  We can run a trot line
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.100]  And a country boy can survive
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:40.100]  Everything in the future is about knowing how to run electricity,
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.100]  knowing how to generate power,
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.100]  knowing how to grow food and knowing how to kick ass.
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:48.100]  I had a good friend in New York City
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.100]  And everybody better get back to the land now.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.100]  On both sides of my family,
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.100]  I've been moving back to the land in the last 70 years.
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.100]  But now we're all moving back to the land.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.100]  Not just my immediate family.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.100]  I've talked to everybody in my family, both sides.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.100]  They're all moving the country.
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.100]  They're all getting back to where they came from.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:16.100]  And whether you got brown skin, black skin or pink skin,
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.100]  I guess some folks do have white skin.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.100]  I got...
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.100]  I like my light brown skin.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.100]  What that is, is that you're going to have to decide
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.100]  whether you're going to be a slave or not.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.100]  And every one of you can be a country boy if you want to be that.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.100]  We need to get the hell out of these cities.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:36.100]  In fact, I'm thinking to start a movement called
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.100]  The Country Boy Alliance.
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:42.100]  And what the country boy and the country girl alliance means is
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.100]  we're self-sufficient.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.100]  And listen, all you got to grow is two or three crops
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.100]  or raise one type of animal
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.100]  and know how to be a machinist or a mechanic.
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:52.100]  And you got to live in a community
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:54.100]  with everything else you need.
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.100]  And instead of going to the grocery store,
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.100]  like when I was a little kid spending two, three weeks of summer
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.100]  with my dad's mother and my grandfather
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:03.100]  out in East Texas,
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.100]  my grandmother would say,
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.100]  Get in the car.
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.100]  And we'd drive just ten miles one way
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.100]  and five miles another and back another ten miles.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:16.100]  And we got back, there was a big old thing of black-eyed peas,
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.100]  big bag in the back of the car
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.100]  and a big bag of green beans
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.100]  and 30, 40 eggs
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.100]  and a bunch of T-bone steaks
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.100]  dripping blood
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.100]  and some cabbages and some carrots
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:32.100]  and some pickles.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.100]  And they'd eat on that for the whole week
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.100]  and then she'd go out in her own garden
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.100]  and pull some turnips up.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.100]  I remember my grandmother sticking pumpkins
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.100]  in a food processor
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:49.100]  and a day later eat the best damn pumpkin pie you ever ate.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:52.100]  And she had a master's degree in English
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.100]  and taught college the whole nine yards.
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.100]  But the point was,
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.100]  she knew how to skin a buck,
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.100]  she knew how to run a trot line,
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:05.100]  that she could pick up when she was 70 years old
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:11.100]  her grandmother's .22 rifle
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:16.100]  and she could shoot a cowbird
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:19.100]  at 60 yards in the head
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.100]  off her back porch.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.100]  She had all her bluebirds and all her birds she fed
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.100]  and cowbirds kick other birds' eggs out of the nest
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.100]  and lay their eggs.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.100]  And boy, she hated those cowbirds.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.100]  She'd go, hold on a minute.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.100]  She had a picture window back there in the kitchen.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:35.100]  Hold on.
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.100]  She'd go on the back porch and get that .22
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.100]  and step right out there.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.100]  I probably saw her do it 10 times
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.100]  every time.
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:47.100]  That cowbird's head was blown right off.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.100]  And man, don't you know when you're five years old?
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.100]  That's so damn cool.
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.100]  You take these lefties from these high-rise buildings
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.100]  and we know how to wipe their ass.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.100]  I remember my grandfather pulling in at lunch
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.100]  off his tractor.
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.100]  He'd walk in from some cow he'd butcher in the morning
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:03.100]  with a brain in a bag.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.100]  He'd smash it right up in front of me with eggs
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:07.100]  and garlic and cook it all up.
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.100]  He'd go, hold on.
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.100]  I want a little something extra.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.100]  He'd walk out and shoot a squirrel,
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:17.100]  nail it down on a board, skin it in about 15 seconds,
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.100]  chop that son of a bitch up and throw it right in the skillet
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.100]  and then feed me squirrel.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.100]  Now, people think of that as some kind of weirdo.
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.100]  That's not weird.
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.100]  That's self-sufficiency.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.100]  That's somebody that knows how to live
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.100]  and that nobody can starve out and nobody can make run.
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.100]  We want to be like those people again
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:43.100]  and we're going to be like those people again.
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:52.100]  We have just begun to fight, my friends.
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:55.100]  I'll give the number out again and we're going to take your calls
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.100]  and cover a ton of news straight ahead.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:04.100]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party,
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:07.100]  he has a chance of winning.
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.100]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.100]  I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024 shirt.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.100]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.100]  This is an idea the crew had.
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.100]  I have a triggering shirt, kind of next level.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.100]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.100]  There's Infowars.com in the back.
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.100]  Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.100]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.100]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:33.100]  It's high quality and it is a exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.100]  and when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:40.100]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.100]  and we'll have a historic memento,
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.100]  be able to spread the word,
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.100]  meet a lot of like-minded people
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.100]  and he will be able to keep us on the air.
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.100]  No way.
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.100]  No way.
[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.100]  That's a bridge too far.
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.100]  No, it can't be.
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.100]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:57.100]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.100]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:04.100]  you are the resistance.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:11.100]  The preacher man says it's the end of time
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.100]  In the Mississippi River she's a gold dry
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:22.100]  The interest is up and the stock market's down
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:25.100]  And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.100]  I live back in the woods you see
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:39.100]  A woman and the kids and the dogs and me
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:46.100]  I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.100]  And a country boy can survive
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:53.100]  Country folks can survive
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:01.100]  I can flower field all day long
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:05.100]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:12.100]  Make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.100]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:18.100]  The real revolution is here.
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.100]  Rediscovering who we are.
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:23.100]  We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.100]  Getting back to the way God designed us.
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:29.100]  Doesn't mean we won't use technology,
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.100]  but we'll use it as a dangerous weapon.
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.100]  Government is like fire.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:40.100]  A dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.100]  Crank the song up.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:50.100]  That is such poetry.
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:52.100]  Somebody who loves God, Hank Williams Jr.,
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.100]  but is sick of the fake pastors
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.100]  that don't actually fight tyranny.
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:58.100]  He'll tell you you're going to hell if you say damn.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.100]  They don't do anything to fight the abortion or real tyranny.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.100]  We say grace. We say amen.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:06.100]  And if he ain't into that, we don't give a damn.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.100]  All these hypocrites.
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.100]  Form over function.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:16.100]  It's a great line written by Millis in the movie
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.100]  based on a composite of Hearts of Darkness,
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.100]  but also real events that happened in Vietnam,
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.100]  so a mix of fiction and fact.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.100]  When Colonel Kurtz is sitting there saying
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.100]  the Pentagon are total hypocrites,
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:30.100]  they train our Air Force pilots
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:34.100]  at 300 feet to drop napalm on women and children,
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.100]  but they court-martial them if they write
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:39.100]  fuck on the side of their airplanes.
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:43.100]  You want somebody to drop napalm on people
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.100]  and burn up children,
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.100]  but you're not supposed to say the f-word.
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:52.100]  And that's the parasitical corruption of the system.
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:55.100]  We say grace. We say amen.
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:58.100]  And if you ain't into that, we don't give a damn
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.100]  because we're not a bunch of hypocrites,
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:03.100]  but when it comes to serving evil, we don't do it.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:06.100]  And we stand against it.
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.100]  Because a country boy can't survive.
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.100]  The New World Order is going to take everything you got.
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:17.100]  They're going to take your children's soul.
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.100]  Are you going to keep bowing down to these people?
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:24.100]  Are you going to let this scum rule over you?
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.100]  It's time to break their will.
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:29.100]  It's time to say,
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:32.100]  I don't care what the hell you do to me,
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.100]  and I don't know how this is going to end,
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.100]  but if you want to fight,
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:39.100]  you better believe you've got one.
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.100]  And it is that fighting spirit
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.100]  of truth and justice
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.100]  to raise our children and be strong
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.100]  and be good and be honest.
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.100]  No matter what damn color you are,
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.100]  you got red blood,
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.100]  and the creator of the universe made you,
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.100]  and you've got to decide,
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.100]  I'm not owned by the devil,
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.100]  I'm not owned by the New World Order,
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:03.100]  and I'm going to do everything I can
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:05.100]  to work against this system
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.100]  and to defeat it.
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.100]  And the first way you do that
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.100]  is breaking with Hollywood and the Democratic Party
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.100]  and the New World Order
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.100]  and every damn thing they push
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:20.100]  because every damn thing they do is death.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.100]  Everything they do is poison.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:24.100]  Everything they do is designed to destroy you
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:27.100]  and destroy your family.
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.100]  It's not an ongoing decision.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:31.100]  You make the decision,
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.100]  you commit to not submit,
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:37.100]  and to fight back with everything you've got.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.100]  That means not caring about the system
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.100]  and how old your car or your truck is
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:44.100]  or what your neighbors think about you
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.100]  or any of that crap.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.100]  What matters is your freedom.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.100]  What matters is your integrity.
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:52.100]  What matters is who you are
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.100]  and that you're not for sale,
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:56.100]  ever!
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.100]  And that's why the enemy hates me so much.
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.100]  That's why they hate you so much
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.100]  because they know we're real.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.100]  They know we love God.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.100]  They know we tell the truth.
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:08.100]  They know we bust our ass to be honorable.
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:12.100]  And they know we're out of their grasp.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.100]  And so that's why they've hit America,
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:17.100]  particularly the Midwest and the South
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.100]  and rural areas in the West
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:23.100]  with poison in the water and GMO and toxic culture
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.100]  because they've made the decision,
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:27.100]  we can't make these Americans submit to us.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.100]  Go ahead and kill their asses.
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:31.100]  They've banned the MRNA shot
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.100]  all over the world for children.
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.100]  They're forcing it on them here.
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:39.100]  They're doing everything they can to kill us.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:42.100]  This occupied government is not the American government.
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.100]  It's a pack of criminals and everybody knows it,
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.100]  including those that serve it.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:49.100]  And I want to talk to the people
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.100]  that serve the corporations and government systems
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:55.100]  who are mid-level or low-level or even high-level
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.100]  and know it's destructive
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:00.100]  and know you can't get out of it
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:05.100]  by going along with it.
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:08.100]  The only way you get out of it
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:12.100]  is understanding that it's a spiritual decision
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.100]  and that you're going to be destroyed
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.100]  by your own actions and inaction,
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.100]  by serving this thing
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.100]  and understanding you're not part of the winning team.
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.100]  You're part of a lie.
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.100]  You're part of a psy-op.
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:25.100]  And the biggest fools
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:27.100]  are the people that go along
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.100]  with the destructive death cult
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.100]  pretending you're doing something
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.100]  for yourself and for your family
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:37.100]  when all you're doing is destroying our civilization
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.100]  and you will never escape the crimes
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.100]  you've committed against humanity.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.100]  They will come back on you
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.100]  even if it isn't through the courts.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:48.100]  And you will pay
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:51.100]  at the next level as well
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.100]  because it's been proven by science
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.100]  as the ancients said
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.100]  the third dimension is only a manifestation
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.100]  of the higher dimensions
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.100]  and we are dust
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.100]  that starts with a tiny egg
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:07.100]  and a tiny sperm
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.100]  that create a design
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:11.100]  and a template in the third dimension
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.100]  of a higher dimensional energetic vortices
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.100]  of higher dimensional
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.100]  or inter-dimensional energy
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.100]  coming in and forming
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.100]  this electrochemical body
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.100]  that is simply a signature
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.100]  or a
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.100]  vapor trail
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:33.100]  of our soul
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.100]  and our electrochemical
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.100]  signet.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.100]  And when you understand you are eternal
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.100]  and that this manifestation of you
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.100]  is a
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:53.100]  flash in the eye
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.100]  you will then understand
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.100]  that nothing the enemy can do to you
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.100]  has any ramifications
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.100]  when you understand this
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.100]  and that you must break with Satan.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.100]  Alright, the toll free number to join us
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.100]  we already have loaded phone lines
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.100]  but I want people to know that as soon as I hang up on a caller
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.100]  I'd love to hear from her taking first time calls
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:13.100]  877-789-2539
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.100]  877-789-Alex
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:17.100]  and we are going to go to break
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.100]  and come back with
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:25.100]  Flagman, Angel, David, Jacob, Drake, Rick, Button, Steve, David, Josh, Joe and others
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.100]  because the enemy hates to hear the people
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:29.100]  come together in the millions
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.100]  to be heard.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.100]  This is unfiltered, uncontrolled
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.100]  this drives our enemies
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.100]  absolutely insane
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.100]  but I love the wild card nature of it
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.100]  hearing what you have to say
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.100]  what you have to state
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.100]  what you have to ask
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.100]  I have so much other insane news
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.100]  and we'll hit a lot of it here today
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:51.100]  obviously we're in a mainline depression
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.100]  CNN's now admitting
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.100]  oh my god the US economy's in crisis
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.100]  because they've begun the stampede on the banks themselves
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.100]  that they want to control and pose as the saviors during
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.100]  we have a lot on Trump
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.100]  and the incredible disinformation
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.100]  they're putting out
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.100]  I saw headlines last night on Drudge
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.100]  Trump threatens nuclear weapons
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.100]  Trump threatens nuclear war
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:13.100]  if he is convicted
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.100]  he's threatening the judge
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.100]  with nuclear war
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.100]  no, he said Biden's starting nuclear war
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:21.100]  and we should stop it
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.100]  what the hell with a citizen
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.100]  and a former president
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:27.100]  saying we're going into World War 3
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:29.100]  we need to stop it, how does that turn into threatening the judge
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.100]  I have the article right here
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.100]  but you read the article
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.100]  it has a quote about he threatened the judge with nuclear war
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:37.100]  and we all watched the speech
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:39.100]  he said we're going into World War 3
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.100]  we've got to stop it
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.100]  but the people that still believe that
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:45.100]  laughed that up, did you hear?
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:47.100]  he threatened nuclear war, that's why he said he's got to be careful
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.100]  with his death and destruction quotes
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:51.100]  because that was bad what he said
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.100]  but now they're just taking stuff he didn't even do and doing
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.100]  we'll be right back with your phone calls
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:57.100]  and a lot of key news
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:09.100]  we were waiting for the mugshot
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.100]  we learned today they wouldn't have it
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.100]  so we've made our own
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.100]  and it says political prisoner
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.100]  with an image of president Trump
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:19.100]  the shirt is being printed now in Texas
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.100]  it will be shipping out to you in one week
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.100]  political prisoner
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.100]  with Trump on the front
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:27.100]  there in a mugshot
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.100]  jail background
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.100]  it's a fundraiser shirt, it says infowars.com
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:33.100]  on the back of the shirt
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.100]  we also have Alex Jones for president
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.100]  no I'm not running for president, it's a really nice
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.100]  navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white and blue
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.100]  Alex Jones for president
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.100]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.100]  and a limited edition shirt, great way to fund
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.100]  the operation, so get your
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:49.100]  Alex Jones for president
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.100]  and Trump mugshot shirts
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:53.100]  at infowarsstore.com
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.100]  or by calling toll free
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.100]  triple A, 253-3139
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:01.100]  I intend
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.100]  to take the infowars
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.100]  armored truck out
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.100]  or the infowars tank as it's so
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.100]  lovingly called, you came through yesterday
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.100]  and shopped at infowarsstore.com
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:13.100]  so I'm going to be able to take the truck out
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:35.100]  so I'm going to be able to take the infowars
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.100]  armored truck out
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.100]  I talk a lot about the great successes infowars has had
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:41.100]  I don't think anybody can deny it
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:43.100]  and it is
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.100]  the biggest
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.100]  thing I've ever done
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:49.100]  and I'm going to be able to
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.100]  take the infowars
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.100]  and the infowars
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.100]  and the infowars
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.100]  and the infowars
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.100]  and the infowars
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.100]  and the infowars
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:03.100]  and the infowars
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:05.100]  and the infowars
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:07.100]  and it is
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:09.100]  because the listeners and viewers
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.100]  are supporting us
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.100]  When we talk about the curue infowars
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.100]  people behind the scenes
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.100]  the researchers, the writers
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:19.100]  they really have been the MVPs of this fight
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.100]  and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owens Troyer
[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:23.100]  and the hard work they engage in every day
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.100]  5,6,7 days a week
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.100]  it's really just incredible
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.100]  so for myself and the whole infowars crew
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:33.100]  I thank you for your support
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:35.100]  but infowars cannot stay on air
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:37.100]  if you do not support us
[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.100]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.100]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:43.100]  but most viewers and listeners never go to infowarsstore.com
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:45.100]  and you never buy great products
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.100]  that enrich and empower your life
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.100]  while at the same time getting us on air
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:51.100]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.100]  actually go buy products at infowarsstore.com
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.100]  if just 1% more of you took action
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:57.100]  and went to infowarsstore.com

[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.100]  but I'm going to hit some news each segment before I go to calls
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.100]  let me hit this briefly
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.100]  remember New Zealand's lockdown queen?
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:37.100]  well she's now become the internet authoritarian
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.100]  she is the head of the new ministry of truth
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.100]  they're establishing there, they're setting them up
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.100]  all over the world
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.100]  we have similar legislation here
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:47.100]  and they now report they're hiring Democrat
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:49.100]  and liberal operatives to run it
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.100]  put you in jail for 20 years for quote disinformation
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:53.100]  well she's going to be the new disinformation
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.100]  czar in New
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.100]  Zealand, so that's her WEF reward
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:59.100]  after being voted out of office
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.100]  remember what she said last year?
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.100]  she said
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:05.100]  the government is your single source of truth
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.100]  unless you hear it from us
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.100]  it's not truth
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.100]  and it was of course all lies
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:13.100]  here's that clip from the time machine
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:15.100]  most up to date information
[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:17.100]  daily
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.100]  you can trust us as a source of that information
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:21.100]  you can also trust the
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.100]  director general of health
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.100]  the Ministry of Health
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.100]  for that information do feel free to visit
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:29.100]  at any time to clarify any rumour
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.100]  you may hear
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:33.100]  covid19.govt.nz
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:35.100]  otherwise
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:37.100]  dismiss anything else
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.100]  we will continue to be your single source of truth
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.100]  we will provide information
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:43.100]  frequently
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:45.100]  we will share everything we can
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.100]  everything you are, else you see
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:49.100]  a grain of salt
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:51.100]  and so I really ask people to focus on that
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.100]  another example of that appears to be this text
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:55.100]  which originated in Malaysia
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.100]  and has become a viral hoax in Australia
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:59.100]  and in New Zealand
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.100]  how irresponsible is it that the people sharing that news
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:03.100]  are the lockdown imminent in New Zealand
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:05.100]  and that's the kind of thing that adds
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:07.100]  to the anxiety that people feel
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:09.100]  so I continue to share the message
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:11.100]  New Zealanders must prepare
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.100]  but do not panic
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:15.100]  prepare
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:17.100]  and when you see those messages
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.100]  they lied about everything
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.100]  they put people in jail for leaving their houses
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:23.100]  they are just slave trainers
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:25.100]  they are just training you to be a slave
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.100]  so I thought we would
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.100]  get to that piece of information
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.100]  but know this Fauci just said three days ago
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.100]  new deadly virus is coming
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:35.100]  CDC warns of Marburg virus
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:37.100]  and deadly African outbreak
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.100]  kills 90% of those infected they claim
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:41.100]  and they are now studying it in African caves
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.100]  to protect us
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.100]  yes I am sure that's the case
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:47.100]  it's how they get total power
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.100]  and total control in their own war games
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:51.100]  alright Jacob in Ohio
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:53.100]  thanks for calling you are on the air worldwide
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.100]  hey Alex thanks for taking my call
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.100]  I just wanted to bring up
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.100]  that this Trump indictment
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.100]  I was on the fence about Trump
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.100]  and so was my family
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:05.100]  and after this
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:07.100]  I talked to my parents who are 100% behind Trump
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.100]  there is a reason
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.100]  they are trying to attack him so much
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.100]  and
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.100]  however I think there is no way they let him win
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:17.100]  in 2024
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.100]  even if he gets 200 million votes
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.100]  well that's the problem with election fraud
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.100]  though it's very hard to beat a giant tsunami
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.100]  I think he did get less votes
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.100]  than he got before
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.100]  the evidence says he still won
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:31.100]  but not by the bigger landslide
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.100]  a mega landslide they can't stop
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:35.100]  that's why I agree with you though
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:37.100]  that they will probably try to assassinate him
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:39.100]  what do you think?
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.100]  I definitely hope not
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:43.100]  I'll start a civil war if it does
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.100]  yeah I know
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:47.100]  I think this all stems from abortion
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:49.100]  the fact that he helped
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.100]  overturn Roe v. Wade
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.100]  by having
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:55.100]  appointing the justices to do so
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:57.100]  the left
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.100]  that is their
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.100]  that is their god is abortion
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.100]  and you know churches
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:05.100]  I go to church every Sunday
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:07.100]  I've never heard the word abortion
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.100]  they don't fight it
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.100]  they just lay there and take it
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:13.100]  it's okay to kill babies just don't cuss
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.100]  I appreciate your call
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.100]  and again I'm not saying cussing is good
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:19.100]  killing babies is 10,000 times worse than cussing
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.100]  oh don't cuss and don't drink
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.100]  don't say the word damn
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.100]  it's not the Lord's name in vain
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.100]  I've actually studied the Greek
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:29.100]  taking the Lord's name in vain
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.100]  is saying damn God
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.100]  is saying I'm not going to actually damn God
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.100]  or actually blaspheme me because I love Jesus
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.100]  and love God
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.100]  but if you said to God
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:41.100]  I want you destroyed down with you blah blah blah
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:43.100]  down with you that is blasphemy
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.100]  that's what the Satanists do when they
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.100]  it comes out they love to do satanic rituals
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:49.100]  in churches because that's blasphemous
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:51.100]  okay so that's what blasphemy is
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:53.100]  and so my point is these churches give you all these
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:55.100]  little things don't do this to make you feel like you're
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.100]  guilty and mad but never ask you to go out and
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:59.100]  actually challenge tyranny God hates
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.100]  cowards ladies and gentlemen let's go ahead and take
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.100]  another call let's talk to Josh in Texas
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:05.100]  you're on the air
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:07.100]  Hey Alex
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:09.100]  so I just wanted to basically
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.100]  um you know
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:13.100]  I know you don't like being thanked but you're awesome man
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:15.100]  um but I think that we also need to gather
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.100]  all these other patriots all these other influencers
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.100]  who are like Steven Crowder
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.100]  uh Jack Masonic or whatever his name is
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.100]  all these other people we need to start really teaching
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:25.100]  them about the new world order we need
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.100]  Trump to actually say the words new world order
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:29.100]  we need people to actually talk about
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:31.100]  world government we need Tucker Carlson
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.100]  on Fox News breaking down eugenics
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:35.100]  breaking down David Rockefeller
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:37.100]  you know we need Trump to understand
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.100]  that the federal reserve is private we need him
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.100]  to speak out against GMO foods we need
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:43.100]  him to talk about all of these issues
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:45.100]  and I think you have the influence to be able to
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.100]  bring people on and actually sit them
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.100]  down and go through the new
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.100]  world order system and really lace them up
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:53.100]  so then you already see Trump coming
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:55.100]  out against the globalists in the deep state in their
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:57.100]  world government plan he's used those terms
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.100]  Tucker is now uh
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:01.100]  you saw Elon Musk a few months ago
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:03.100]  at the world government summit saying world government
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:05.100]  is a bad idea you guys are tyrants so
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:07.100]  I think we've come a long way but I totally
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.100]  agree with your statements
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.100]  yes sir I just I want to see Trump
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.100]  actually go after the private federal reserve
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:15.100]  they're the ones who really control this country
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.100]  I want him to talk about the Bilderberg group
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:19.100]  you know we need Steven Crowder sounding like you
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:21.100]  we need Tucker Carlson sounding more like you
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:23.100]  all these other people who you have
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.100]  they have your ear you have their ear
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.100]  well listen I do talk to those people but you
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.100]  got to put loving pressure
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:31.100]  and information on them as well
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:33.100]  but I hear you and that's what we're doing brother
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.100]  yes sir and I appreciate everything Alex
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:37.100]  I appreciate you thank you
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:39.100]  flag man in Louisiana you're on the air
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:41.100]  hello good to
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:43.100]  talk to you I just have a quick question
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:45.100]  if you could time travel
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.100]  and go back to Germany
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:49.100]  before Hitler did
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.100]  all of the horrible things that he did would
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:53.100]  you take him out would you travel back
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.100]  in time and take him out
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:57.100]  I
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:59.100]  would I would try to travel back in time
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.100]  and explain to people
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:03.100]  that British intelligence
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.100]  helped set up Hitler he didn't work for him but they set him up
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:07.100]  to create a whole new war
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.100]  to bring in the system we have in the UN
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:11.100]  but yeah I mean I do think
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:13.100]  that the world
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.100]  would have been better off if
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.100]  Adolf Hitler would have ever been born
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:19.100]  there you go now if
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.100]  and you just answered my second question
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:23.100]  if you could go back in time or if you lived
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.100]  during that time you would
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.100]  talk and talk and try to wake people up
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.100]  and stop what happened through
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:31.100]  talk well my point
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:33.100]  is the same thing is going on
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:35.100]  right now today
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:37.100]  they're killing us
[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:39.100]  through medical tyranny they're
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:41.100]  killing us through many different ways that you've already
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:43.100]  covered this morning fluoride in the water
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:45.100]  system so forth and so on
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:47.100]  they're talking about another
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:49.100]  pandemic coming
[01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:51.100]  shortly I guess preparing
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.100]  for if Trump takes the
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:55.100]  presidency again we need another
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.100]  pandemic so what is
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:59.100]  it that we're waiting for we see
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:01.100]  the death we see the control we
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.100]  see them moving
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.100]  so quickly in these last two
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:07.100]  to three years against us
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:09.100]  constantly talking
[01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:11.100]  about their world domination their
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:13.100]  world takeover depopulation
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:15.100]  plans what are we waiting
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:17.100]  for and I really don't care
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:19.100]  to win a war
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:21.100]  of morality
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:23.100]  I don't care about a moral victory
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:25.100]  I want to live I want my
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:27.100]  children to live and prosper
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.100]  don't hang up flag man because you're
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:31.100]  raising really a central question I want to come back
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:33.100]  and hear more from you and I'll give you my
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.100]  response to this Hitler was
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.100]  actually in charge of Germany the Germans
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:39.100]  tried to assassinate him his own military
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:41.100]  two years before the war ended if they
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:43.100]  could have killed Hitler it could have stopped with
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:45.100]  the globalists it's an ideology and like
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.100]  a oligarchy of a whole bunch
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.100]  of people so we have to identify
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.100]  the oligarchy and who they are first
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:53.100]  and then we need to start arresting them but
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:55.100]  I'm going to come back to you on the other side please stay with us
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:23.100]  kind of next level Alex Jones is right

[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:53.100]  too far that's no it can't be
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.100]  and I said on national television
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:57.100]  that he was going to win
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:59.100]  at info war store.com
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.100]  the most banned man in America
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:03.100]  Alex Jones
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:09.100]  I want you all to know something Alex
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:11.100]  Jones was right Alex
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:13.100]  is right about far
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.100]  more than is wrong Alex has been right
[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:17.100]  on for over a decade
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.100]  I don't care how you slice it dice
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.100]  it flip it up or rub it down
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:23.100]  Alex Jones was right
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.100]  think about how frustrated we
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:27.100]  are if you've been awake for a year or two
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:29.100]  imagine being like an Alex Jones
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:31.100]  or those guys who've been awake for like decades
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.100]  Alex Jones called this years
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:35.100]  ago years ago
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:37.100]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:39.100]  not for a second

[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.100]  he doesn't care
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.100]  that's not his job he's not the president
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:15.100]  of the United States he's a puppet
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:17.100]  operating for the globalists
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:19.100]  appetites of the autocrat
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.100]  cannot be
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.100]  appeased they must be opposed
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:25.100]  autocrats only

[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:43.100]  censoring our free speech we say
[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:45.100]  no to you selling us out to the world

[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:57.100]  to your war
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:01.100]  leading a frontal
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:03.100]  assault on the lies of the
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:05.100]  new world order it's
[01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:07.100]  Alex Jones
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:37.100]  cartoon produced by the CIA
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:39.100]  last year
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:43.100]  for recruitment
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:45.100]  for information warfare
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:47.100]  against the American people
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:49.100]  imagine the type of people
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:51.100]  they're trying to hire
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.100]  schizophrenic criminals
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:57.100]  alright I want to respond to
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:59.100]  Flagman and then go back to him and give him a response
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.100]  to my response
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:03.100]  we
[01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:05.100]  live in a complex civilization
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:07.100]  where we've
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:09.100]  decided to not use force to settle
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:11.100]  our differences
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:13.100]  now within that so-called civilization
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:15.100]  they hide the aggression with the
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:17.100]  poison fluoride and the fentanyl
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.100]  and the transgenderism and the genital mutilations
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:21.100]  and all of it
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.100]  but you first have to identify
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.100]  the cult and the globalist
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:27.100]  and who they are because it's not like
[01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:29.100]  Operation Valkyrie
[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:31.100]  the Germans tried to kill Hitler a few years before
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:33.100]  the war ended because they knew they were losing
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.100]  and that Germany would be
[01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:37.100]  destroyed and Hitler wouldn't give up
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:39.100]  they failed
[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:41.100]  they could have killed
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:43.100]  Hitler and ended World War 2
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.100]  and saved 10 million German
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:47.100]  lives, probably another 10 million
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:49.100]  Russians got killed in that period, hundreds of thousands
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.100]  of Americans and others
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:53.100]  and millions of
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.100]  people that Hitler also killed
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.100]  political dissidents, Jews
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:59.100]  gypsies, folks that didn't submit
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.100]  most of that killing happened
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:03.100]  in those two years
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:05.100]  in fact the German
[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:07.100]  general staff
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:09.100]  came to him and said you're allotting a
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:11.100]  third of our resources to setting up death camps
[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:13.100]  when our own factories do a
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.100]  better job because you want
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:17.100]  to kill these people, that was the final solution
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:19.100]  people that deny Hitler killed a bunch of
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:21.100]  Jews, I mean they had the final solution documents
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:23.100]  the papers, the Germans
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.100]  testified, admitted to it before they got executed
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.100]  that yeah, Hitler said I don't care
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.100]  you spend a third of our energy
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:31.100]  killing these people
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.100]  he says we're probably going to lose
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:35.100]  but at least I'll kill all these people
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:37.100]  so
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:39.100]  yes, it would have been better if Hitler had been
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.100]  assassinated or never born
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.100]  now
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.100]  that's hindsight's
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.100]  light years times 2020
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:51.100]  this is not like Hitler
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:53.100]  where it's one man that runs it, he was actually
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:55.100]  in charge, it's bureaucracies
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:57.100]  it's boards, it's corporate systems
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:59.100]  it's philosophies, it's
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:01.100]  a cult, we have to kill the ideas
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.100]  of the new world order, we have to pull our children
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:05.100]  out of public schools and private schools that follow
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:07.100]  the leftist agenda, we have to turn off Hollywood
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:09.100]  we have to go to the grassroots
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.100]  we have to support the farmers markets, we have to start
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.100]  our own gardens, we have to get back to God
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:15.100]  we have to form our new churches that are actually real
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:17.100]  and oppose all this, we have to
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:19.100]  live the way we want to live
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:21.100]  and realize they want to bankrupt things
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.100]  to isolate us so they can force us
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:25.100]  to the social credit score by increments
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:27.100]  to bend us to their will
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:29.100]  and so it doesn't matter
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.100]  if Rachel Levine suppresses that fluoride
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:33.100]  kills kids and sterilizes
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:35.100]  them and gives them cancer and
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:37.100]  lowers their IQs
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.100]  we just expose that and we don't
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:41.100]  drink the water and we
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.100]  file lawsuits against the local government and we
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:45.100]  at the grassroots
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:47.100]  defeat them on every issue and keep educating
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:49.100]  people, they want us to get
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:51.100]  violent and they admit that
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:53.100]  in their own documents that have come out because we're
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:55.100]  winning hearts and minds inch by inch
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:57.100]  like, you ever watch those best football games
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.100]  where
[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:01.100]  over and over again they get the first down
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:03.100]  and it takes them like 14
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:05.100]  plays to get
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:07.100]  say from the 10 yard line where they catch the ball
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:11.100]  on the kickoff
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:13.100]  until they march just a few yards
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:15.100]  each time all the way into the end zone
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:17.100]  we are marching, marching,
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.100]  marching so close to the end zone
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:21.100]  we got 10 yards to go
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.100]  first down baby
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.100]  and
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:27.100]  we are so close, people are rejecting
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:29.100]  it, they're everything, so they just over the
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.100]  top it more, show a unified front
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:33.100]  look like they're invincible, they're not
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:35.100]  and their own people
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.100]  that aren't pure evil, a lot of them are pure evil
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:39.100]  a lot of them aren't, are going why are we doing
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:41.100]  this, this is really destructive, this is crazy
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:43.100]  they want us to just run
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:45.100]  out and fight them because that will organize them
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:47.100]  into the system they want, here's a famous
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:49.100]  Evian France quote from Bilderberg
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:51.100]  in the early 1990's
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.100]  it's been confirmed
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.100]  that since then Kissinger and others have written books about it
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:57.100]  so has Brzezinski who was his counterpart
[01:37:57.100 --> 01:37:59.100]  saying basically the same thing
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.100]  today America would be outraged
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:03.100]  if UN trips into Los Angeles to restore
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.100]  order, tomorrow they will be grateful
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.100]  this is especially true if they were told
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:09.100]  that there was an outside threat from beyond
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:11.100]  whether real or promulgated that threatened
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.100]  our very existence, viruses
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:15.100]  uprisings, you name it
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:17.100]  it is then that all people
[01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:19.100]  in the world will plead to
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:21.100]  deliver them from this evil, the one thing
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:23.100]  every man fears is the unknown
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.100]  when presented with the scenario individual
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:27.100]  rights will be willingly relinquished
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:29.100]  with the guaranteed of their well-being
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:31.100]  granted them by their world government
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.100]  so the globalists are pounding us
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.100]  with 5G and GMO
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:37.100]  and poison shots and lab-made
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:39.100]  viruses and cultural death and
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:41.100]  all of it
[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:43.100]  they don't care if you blow up a federal building
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:45.100]  they love it, they don't care if you go shoot the state police
[01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:47.100]  they love it, they don't care
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:49.100]  and I'm not saying you're going to do this
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:51.100]  if you go firebomb an abortionary
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:53.100]  that makes them the victim and they get even more funds
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.100]  but if you pull back from them
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:57.100]  never associate with them
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.100]  speak out against them constantly
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.100]  build our new civilization
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:03.100]  right in the middle of their cancer
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:05.100]  they're the outside force
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:07.100]  they won't be able to get any
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:09.100]  of this done
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:11.100]  when I get these calls, and I understand the primitive level
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:17.100]  let's be men, let's go fight this
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:19.100]  let's go do this, I always say
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:21.100]  who's doing it?
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:23.100]  because if we won't put the energy in
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.100]  peacefully like I've done for 29 years
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:27.100]  like so many others have done for even longer
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:29.100]  then what will you really do in a fight?
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:33.100]  and then you always notice
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:35.100]  when something gets attacked, it's a federal building
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:37.100]  with a daycare center run by the feds
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:39.100]  that didn't hurt them
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.100]  that helped them
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.100]  so yes, if God reached down
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:45.100]  but God wants to do us ourselves
[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:47.100]  and the Rothschilds
[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:49.100]  and the Rockefellers and Fauci
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:51.100]  and Gates all got struck by lightning
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:53.100]  and that's God's decision
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.100]  I'm not going to launch anything offensive against them
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.100]  I don't want to make them a victim
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:59.100]  but if God decides
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.100]  to strike them down
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:03.100]  it would be nice
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:05.100]  but here's the problem
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:07.100]  now there's
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.100]  Maria Brannovich
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:11.100]  the head of the Rothschilds
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:13.100]  in front of a painting
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:15.100]  Lucifer rallies
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:17.100]  his armies, Lucifer dominating
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:19.100]  what's the name of the painting?
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:21.100]  Lucifer summons his legions, something like that
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:23.100]  so
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:25.100]  if they all
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:27.100]  die today
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:29.100]  they have all this scum under them
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:31.100]  that's just as bad, like shark teeth
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:33.100]  ready to roll forward and fill their place
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:35.100]  they must be politically
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:37.100]  and culturally
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:39.100]  non-violently assassinated
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:41.100]  their ideas
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.100]  who they are
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:45.100]  and then we can take the government over
[01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:47.100]  and then we can have real grand juries
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:49.100]  throw them in prison
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:51.100]  and that's how you do it in civilization
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:53.100]  now that's my view on this
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:55.100]  flag man, but here's the deal
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:57.100]  we could get rid of all them tomorrow
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.100]  if we're not moral
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:01.100]  and we're not good, we would just recreate it again
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:03.100]  this is spirit, this is a paradigm
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:05.100]  does that make sense to you flag man?
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:07.100]  it absolutely makes perfect sense
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:09.100]  and everything that you said is absolutely
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:11.100]  100% the moral
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:13.100]  fight and I get it
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.100]  but at some point
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.100]  as they continue to go on
[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:19.100]  day after day after day
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:21.100]  we're losing more
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:23.100]  day after day after day
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:25.100]  I mean, the longer
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.100]  they go on, the more we die
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:29.100]  well they just hit us with a big
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:31.100]  bio attack and poison shots and it's completely blown up in their face
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.100]  and the whole world's turning against them
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:35.100]  I'm sad they did it, I wish we could have stopped it, I tried to
[01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:37.100]  but I mean
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:39.100]  I don't agree with you
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:41.100]  are you saying they're winning? Because I don't think they're winning
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:45.100]  as far as the death count
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:47.100]  they are certainly winning
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.100]  listen, nobody, but there's a thousand
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:51.100]  times more of us than them
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.100]  ten thousand times, probably 400 top
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:55.100]  globals actually run things
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:57.100]  let me explain it this way, I'll hold you over to me again, this is an important call
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:01.100]  they
[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:03.100]  in their own internal documents that leak say they're losing
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:05.100]  they jumped the shark
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:07.100]  release of this virus
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:09.100]  they'll probably release another one
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:11.100]  and I'll tell you, they'll probably release a new virus
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:13.100]  that might kill 20% of the public
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:15.100]  but I think that's when things
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:17.100]  backfire and I think
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:19.100]  that's when the military tries to come out
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:21.100]  and make people go to emergency centers
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:23.100]  that's when the rebellion will start, which we're trying to stop
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:25.100]  and then I think we'll have
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:27.100]  governors stand up and other stuff and the military's
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:29.100]  going to join us because they already know the next
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:31.100]  attack's coming and I think then
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:33.100]  that's when it'll become a hot war if they're dumb
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:35.100]  enough to do it. I mean, I do think
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:37.100]  they're going to push us into a corner for a hot war
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:39.100]  but
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:41.100]  it's my job
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:43.100]  to try to stop that in the information
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:45.100]  war, which is 95%
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:47.100]  depending on, I'll tell you, a war
[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:49.100]  it is not my purview or my
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:51.100]  avenue to pick targets
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:53.100]  or lead military attacks
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:55.100]  I'm just setting the battle space about who the enemy
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:57.100]  is, I'm going to let you make a decision about what you're going to do
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:27.100]  I'm just setting the battle space about what you're going to do
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:57.100]  Every time I talk to you, you're either
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:59.100]  on the border, exposing the cartels
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:01.100]  and coming under fire
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:03.100]  or you're on the streets of some American city
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:05.100]  hanging out with drug addicts and criminals
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:07.100]  and now you've gone to ground zero
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:09.100]  of a massive chemical spill
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:11.100]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:13.100]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:15.100]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:17.100]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:19.100]  and again, I have info words to thank
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:21.100]  for that. Looking back on the day, I was able
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:23.100]  to ask President Donald Trump
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:25.100]  two questions
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:27.100]  I was so grateful because I truly was
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.100]  classically trained under Alex Jones
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:31.100]  and under the Interwar team
[01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:33.100]  and I really do credit that
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.100]  as to why I'm able to
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:37.100]  get these types of clips
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:39.100]  because Alex's whole mentality was
[01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:41.100]  go where the story is
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:43.100]  go where the mainstream media refuses to
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:45.100]  so it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:47.100]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:49.100]  and helping the American people
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:51.100]  and I really do credit Alex for
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:53.100]  living and spilling that within me
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:55.100]  early on in my career
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.100]  I was able to ask President Donald Trump
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:25.100]  two questions
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.100]  I was so grateful because I truly was
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:29.100]  classically trained under Alex Jones
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:31.100]  and under the Interwar team
[01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:33.100]  and I really do credit that
[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:35.100]  as to why I'm able to
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:37.100]  get these types of clips
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:39.100]  because Alex's whole mentality was
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:41.100]  go where the story is
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:43.100]  go where the mainstream media refuses to
[01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:45.100]  so it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:47.100]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:49.100]  and helping the American people
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:51.100]  and I really do credit Alex for
[01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:53.100]  living and spilling that within me
[01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:55.100]  early on in my career
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:21.100]  I want to get another signed copy of the book
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:23.100]  after the signed copies we got
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:25.100]  run out and there's about a thousand left of them
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:27.100]  right now
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:29.100]  so get your copy of The Great Reset and The War For The World
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:31.100]  a signed copy at Infowarswar.com
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:33.100]  and there is a mark up there
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:35.100]  because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:37.100]  so you won't just have this historic memento
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:39.100]  and this powerful book
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.100]  you'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:43.100]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:45.100]  or unsigned copies
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:47.100]  but I want to encourage all of you
[01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.100]  who haven't yet to go to Infowarswar.com
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:51.100]  and get a signed copy
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:53.100]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:55.100]  or give them to the local school
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:57.100]  this is an Infowar, I'm counting on you
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:59.100]  and thank you for your support
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.100]  alright we're talking to Flagman
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:21.100]  but he just hung up
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:23.100]  so I'll go on to your other calls
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:25.100]  I know I said I'd move quick through calls
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.100]  but his questions were so important
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:29.100]  I wish he wouldn't have hung up because I wanted him to give a response back
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:33.100]  and I'll just be completely honest with you
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:35.100]  because I don't want to cop out on this question
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:37.100]  and I was really thinking about it during the break
[01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:43.100]  when you have people on record that have created bioweapons
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.100]  and that have been caught creating them and releasing them
[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:47.100]  and they say soon there will be new pandemics
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:51.100]  and their own war games say this is how they get total control
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:53.100]  and you know their names
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:59.100]  Fauci, Peter Daszak, Bill Gates, people like that
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:05.100]  if the Justice Department is so controlled and part of this
[01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:07.100]  and won't arrest them
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:11.100]  and we know they're getting ready to do it again
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:17.100]  if I was one of the lab workers
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:19.100]  or one of their operatives
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:21.100]  of course they're all eugenicists
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:23.100]  so that's why they've been chosen to improve it
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:25.100]  they're part of the plan
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:27.100]  and I got the order to release it
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.100]  obviously I would have to take matters into my own hands
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.100]  so we are really coming up to that point
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:33.100]  but we're not like Black Lives Matter anti-war
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:37.100]  that goes and burns down public housing
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:39.100]  or shoots cops in the back
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:43.100]  and so my bailiwick here is not directing people
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.100]  to go out there against these folks
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:47.100]  they are attacking us
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:49.100]  they are killing us
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:51.100]  and they've normalized that
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:55.100]  and so I can't morally say
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:57.100]  people are wrong
[01:48:57.100 --> 01:48:59.100]  who are thinking about this
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:01.100]  because we should be thinking about it
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:03.100]  because they're attacking us, that's where we are
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:05.100]  but they want violence
[01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:07.100]  and you can bet your bottom dollar
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:09.100]  they're going to stage false flag attacks
[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:11.100]  against innocent groups and blame us
[01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:13.100]  and so that's not a wheelhouse
[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:15.100]  I want to enter
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:17.100]  and I really want to just work as hard as we can
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:19.100]  to expose the evil
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:21.100]  and try to stop it that way
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:23.100]  so if they're crazy enough to do it
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:25.100]  again, or at least something even worse
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.100]  people don't go along with it
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:29.100]  and then I don't think they'll be able to control the public
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.100]  I think then you're going to have a
[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:33.100]  giant French-style revolution
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:35.100]  and it'll probably kill even more people
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:37.100]  in the virus itself
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:39.100]  so this stuff is so dangerous
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:41.100]  and so uncontained
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:43.100]  and the globalists are playing with fire here
[01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:45.100]  that I don't even like to pretend like I'm as smart as them
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:47.100]  because I'm smarter
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:49.100]  they think they're smart
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:51.100]  that they think they can control this
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:53.100]  they think they can navigate this
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:55.100]  or they're crazy enough to think, well we just don't care, we're going to do it
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:57.100]  this is our mission to dominate and control
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:59.100]  so I have millions of listeners
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:01.100]  this is a big show
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:03.100]  this is not up here pretend land
[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:05.100]  where we're sitting around playing Dungeons and Dragons
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:07.100]  and oh, I'm going to slay the dragon
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:09.100]  and I'm going to roll the dice
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:11.100]  this is the real world
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:13.100]  and so I'm going to aggressively
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:15.100]  expose them, I'm going to
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:17.100]  break down their plans
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:19.100]  and
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:21.100]  I would not want to be
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:23.100]  Bill Gates or any of these people
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:25.100]  when their own security
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:27.100]  people have probably already lost family
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:29.100]  and if they do it again, they're saying it's going to be bigger
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:31.100]  they've already telegraphed that
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:33.100]  I don't know how they think they're going to be safe anywhere
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:35.100]  because I don't wish to kill Bill Gates
[01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:37.100]  I don't want to kill Lord Rothschild
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:39.100]  I want them just to stop being evil
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:41.100]  and repent
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:43.100]  but obviously they're so far gone
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:45.100]  generationally that they can't do that
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:49.100]  it's just that I'm not
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:51.100]  the guy signing the death warrants here like George Washington
[01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:53.100]  I mean if we had a general
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:55.100]  and we'd already taken half the country
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:57.100]  and all this is going on and the general
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:59.100]  had hearings and captured these people
[01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:01.100]  I'd say, well, you know
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:03.100]  yeah, absolutely
[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:05.100]  but we need some type of
[01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:07.100]  leadership
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:09.100]  and some type of
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:11.100]  political platform for this
[01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:13.100]  and we have to do that
[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:15.100]  by continuing to educate the public
[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:17.100]  and we're just not there yet
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:19.100]  I'd rather let them know that they're exposed
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:21.100]  let them know we're aware of their operations
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:23.100]  so they're smart and back off
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:25.100]  because they already own and control everything
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:27.100]  they've just got a fetish to exercise power
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:29.100]  one thing they don't have left is total control over our bodies
[01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:31.100]  so the shots, the viruses
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:33.100]  the 5G, the GMO
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:35.100]  the drugs, the culture, the brainwashing
[01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:37.100]  it's all about the last thing
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:39.100]  they don't have, they want the full control
[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:41.100]  of that
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:43.100]  and I say if you're aware of their attacks
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:45.100]  and resist it, it makes you stronger like lifting weights
[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:47.100]  or hiking up a mountain or jogging
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:49.100]  and so really
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:51.100]  educate people, speak out against it
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:53.100]  before we talk about going around and killing people
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:55.100]  we need to really
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:57.100]  do our full exercise of resistance
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:59.100]  like we've been doing here
[01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:01.100]  like you're doing calling in
[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:03.100]  so please don't go out and blow anything up
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:05.100]  please don't go out and shoot anybody
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:07.100]  vengeance is God's
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:09.100]  and don't worry
[01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:11.100]  in most analysis of this
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:13.100]  this leads into a very
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:15.100]  dark chapter in the world
[01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:17.100]  worse than it even is now, the worst in human history
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:19.100]  and if you want blood
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:21.100]  you're going to get lots of it
[01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:23.100]  you're going to get
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:25.100]  more blood than I think you'd ever want
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:27.100]  and I don't think you want blood, but I get your point
[01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:29.100]  is hey, they're putting poison in the water
[01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:31.100]  they're GMOing us, they're putting out poison shots
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:33.100]  they know they're doing it, why are we
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:35.100]  sitting here?
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:37.100]  well because the public isn't informed
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:39.100]  enough yet, because they have a captured
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.100]  justice department
[01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:43.100]  but let me tell you, those justice department people, they go and take
[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:45.100]  the shot, their kids get sick, they die
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:47.100]  and so they're going to have to
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:49.100]  experience this, and you're going to have
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:51.100]  FBI agents and lawyers
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:53.100]  and bureaucrats and members of congress
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:55.100]  in the next lockdown where millions are dying
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:57.100]  tens of millions, and things are really bad
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:52:59.100]  and they're going to have to sit there and go, wow
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:01.100]  we went along with this, and then they're going to sit there and watch
[01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:03.100]  their wife, their kid, them die
[01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:05.100]  they'll have to face God over that
[01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:07.100]  that's the good news, and it's the bad news too
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:09.100]  is that all these people playing
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:11.100]  with fire, like the communists and the Nazis
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:13.100]  and people in cults in history
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:15.100]  they're going to get a front row
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:17.100]  seat to what they did, this dinner they
[01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:19.100]  cooked up of tyranny, they're going to have to
[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:21.100]  eat the most of it
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:23.100]  so they want to
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:25.100]  force feed us this crap
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:27.100]  they want to suck our children's souls
[01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:29.100]  they want to
[01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:31.100]  toy with evil
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:33.100]  they're the ones that are going to have to
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:35.100]  have front row seats to this
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.100]  and there are no spectators
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:39.100]  in what's going down
[01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:41.100]  and what's happening
[01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:43.100]  and so,
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:45.100]  guard your soul folks, that's what really matters
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:47.100]  in this, but yes, we're under chemical
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:49.100]  biological, radiological, electromagnetic
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:51.100]  attack, and
[01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:53.100]  you know you have countless
[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:55.100]  people in the federal government, it's not just the CIA
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:57.100]  saying I'm sick, I'm
[01:53:57.100 --> 01:53:59.100]  vomiting, I'm nauseous, I can't sleep
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:01.100]  I've got a ring in my
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:03.100]  ears, what's going on, and well that's the
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:05.100]  general public reports that
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:07.100]  because they live by a cell tower
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:09.100]  or the school has record cancers
[01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:11.100]  and record sick kids and record leukemia
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:13.100]  and then they go, oh you're just kooks, it's good
[01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:15.100]  for you, even though the studies show it, so the CIA
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:17.100]  is in these buildings with all these
[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:19.100]  giant hidden antennas in the building
[01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:21.100]  even more powerful than civilian antennas
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.100]  and all these big government airplanes
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:25.100]  have got super powerful antennas
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:27.100]  in the fuselages and they're all
[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:29.100]  wondering, I don't know why I'm so sick
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:31.100]  the CIA headquarters is
[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:33.100]  being bombarded by something, yeah
[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:35.100]  by what you live in
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:37.100]  and it's the perfect microcosm
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:39.100]  of how they're
[01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:41.100]  sick and vomiting and throwing up
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:43.100]  and have cancer and why are we all dying
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:45.100]  they think the Russians and the Chinese are doing it
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:47.100]  you're doing it to yourself
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:49.100]  you're doing it to us
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:54:59.100]  I read all about ten years ago about 5G
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:01.100]  and cancer and all the rest of it and the other stuff
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:03.100]  does it too but it's not as powerful
[01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:05.100]  it's way more powerful, it doesn't go as far but it permeates
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:07.100]  I remember when they finally
[01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:09.100]  put it all in downtown
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:11.100]  on Congress, all the streets
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:13.100]  I'm not a guy that feels bad
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:15.100]  I'm out in the country, I feel like I'm in heaven
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:17.100]  whether I'm in the desert, the woods, anywhere
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:19.100]  but I get in a major city
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:21.100]  that's got nothing but 5G and I'm
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:23.100]  coughing and I've got a headache
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:25.100]  and that's what it says it does and I feel sick
[01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:27.100]  because you can't see it
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:29.100]  with your eyes but it's there
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:31.100]  it's blasting everything
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:35.100]  and it's not placebo
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:37.100]  it's not like, oh I think I'm going to get a 5G
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:39.100]  I'll feel bad, it's like I'll be in an area
[01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:41.100]  where it's 5G where you're in it for a long time
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:43.100]  driving and you're like, man
[01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:45.100]  I can't
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:47.100]  oh, and that's what the studies say
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:49.100]  manipulates oxygen in the lungs
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:53.100]  it even causes skin cancer
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:55.100]  I mean
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:57.100]  alright, I'm going to start the next hour and I promise
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:59.100]  I'm not going to give callers more than two minutes
[01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:01.100]  in the last guy like 20 minutes, we brought up a very important point
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:03.100]  Drake
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:05.100]  and Rick and everybody else
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:07.100]  we're going to just bam, bam, bam, bam
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.100]  take your calls but I think this is a very
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:11.100]  important discussion to have
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:13.100]  but again, these government
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:15.100]  buildings, particularly intelligence agencies
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:17.100]  I'm not going to go on an hour long
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:19.100]  diatribe but I've researched what's in there
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:21.100]  they've got all sorts of antennas and all
[01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:23.100]  sorts of transmitters and all sorts of high powered
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:25.100]  microwave relay systems
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:27.100]  and they've got
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:29.100]  systems they line the building with
[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:31.100]  that send a magnetic pulse through the Earth
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:33.100]  they communicate with all the ships and submarines
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:35.100]  instantaneously, takes like a half a second
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:37.100]  and
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:39.100]  anybody that's worked around that in the military
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:41.100]  will tell you, you get sick as hell being around
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:43.100]  but they're
[01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:45.100]  intelligence agency people
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:47.100]  they're CIA deputy directors
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:49.100]  and they're all getting sick and everybody's getting
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:51.100]  sick in the building and this is really happening
[01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:53.100]  we found no foreign governments
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:55.100]  are doing it and you're literally in an office
[01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:57.100]  surrounded
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:59.100]  by hidden communication towers
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:01.100]  they're inside
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:03.100]  the building
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:05.100]  whole floors
[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:07.100]  are, and then you'll look
[01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:09.100]  like on the top floor it's all communication
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:11.100]  towers under the roof, you can't see it
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:13.100]  and then whoever the section chief is is like
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:15.100]  I've got a bloody nose, I can't sleep
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:17.100]  I'm depressed, I'm having hallucinations
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:19.100]  there's rain in my ears because
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:21.100]  three feet above you is like
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:23.100]  fourteen different communication systems
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:25.100]  you dumbass
[01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:27.100]  the hell's your problem
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:29.100]  frickin' idiots
[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:31.100]  because they pretend they're invincible
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:33.100]  they pretend they're part of the power structure
[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:35.100]  they pretend they're the rulers
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:37.100]  and you're killing yourself
[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:39.100]  like you're killing us
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:41.100]  you dumb bastards
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:43.100]  that's the big takeaway
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:45.100]  nobody's immune from evil
[01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:47.100]  nobody
[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:03.100]  and it says political
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:05.100]  prisoner with an image
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:07.100]  of president Trump, the shirt is
[01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:09.100]  being printed now in Texas
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:11.100]  it'll be shipping out to you in one week
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:13.100]  political prisoner with Trump
[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:15.100]  on the front there in
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:17.100]  a mugshot jail background
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:19.100]  it's a fundraiser shirt, it says
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:21.100]  infoawards.com on the
[01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:23.100]  back of the shirt
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:25.100]  we also have Alex Jones for president, no I'm not running for president
[01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:27.100]  it's a really nice navy blue high quality
[01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:29.100]  shirt, red white and blue, Alex Jones
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:31.100]  for president 2024, it's a fun conversational
[01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:33.100]  piece and a limited edition shirt
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:35.100]  great way to fund the operation
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:37.100]  so get your Alex Jones
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:39.100]  for president and Trump mugshot
[01:58:39.100 --> 01:58:41.100]  shirts at
[01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:43.100]  infoawardsstore.com
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:45.100]  or by calling toll free
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:47.100]  888-253-3139
[01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:51.100]  I talk a lot about
[01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:53.100]  the great successes info wars has had
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:55.100]  I don't think anybody can deny it
[01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:57.100]  and it is because of
[01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:59.100]  the volunteers and viewers supporting us
[01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:01.100]  when we talk about the crew at info wars
[01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:03.100]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the riders
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:05.100]  they really have
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:07.100]  been the MVPs in this fight
[01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:09.100]  and we look at Harrison Smith
[01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:11.100]  and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage
[01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:13.100]  in every day, 5, 6, 7
[01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:15.100]  days a week
[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:17.100]  it's really just incredible
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:19.100]  so for myself and the whole info wars crew
[01:59:19.100 --> 01:59:21.100]  I thank you for your past support
[01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:23.100]  and I only encourage you now to realize that
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:25.100]  info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us
[01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:27.100]  I know you spread the word
[01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:29.100]  I know you pray for us, that's wonderful, keep doing it
[01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:31.100]  but most viewers and listeners
[01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:33.100]  never go to infoawardsstore.com
[01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:35.100]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:37.100]  while at the same time give us on air
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:39.100]  I know that less than 1%
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:41.100]  of our listeners actually go buy products at infoawardsstore.com
[01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:43.100]  if just 1% more of you
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:45.100]  took action and went to infoawardsstore.com
[01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:47.100]  our funding problems will be over
[01:59:47.100 --> 01:59:49.100]  please take action now
[01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:53.100]  if you are receiving this
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:55.100]  transmission, you are the resistance
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:25.100]  alright, let's go to Drake
[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:27.100]  who has been holding patiently from the great state of Texas
[02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:29.100]  Drake, thank you for calling
[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:31.100]  hello Alex
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:33.100]  I've been listening for a few years now
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.100]  I hear what you're saying about the transgender
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:37.100]  and how it's evil
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:39.100]  but when you talk about Blair Wyatt
[02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:41.100]  it's kind of confusing like
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.100]  do you think he looks good or something
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:45.100]  no, I'm not being a hypocrite about that
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:47.100]  I do not dislike gay people
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:49.100]  I do not dislike adults that have decided to be transgender
[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:51.100]  I'm saying the system running it
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:53.100]  is going after children
[02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:55.100]  and is targeting them
[02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:57.100]  to confuse them
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:59.100]  and try to get them into that
[02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:01.100]  I don't hate adults as long as they don't hurt anybody else
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:03.100]  and I've been consistent
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:05.100]  about that
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:07.100]  I don't care if it's heterosexual or homosexual
[02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:09.100]  or transgender or whatever it is
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:11.100]  stay away from children
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:13.100]  I've been 100% consistent
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:15.100]  and Blair Wyatt has been the same
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:17.100]  and I think Blair is a very smart nice person
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:19.100]  that's what I said
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:21.100]  and Blair Wyatt speaks out against
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:23.100]  the targeting of children
[02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:25.100]  Blair Wyatt came on like 10 years ago
[02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:27.100]  when Blair first went public
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:29.100]  as a transgender person
[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:31.100]  and said she was against the left
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:33.100]  and that they didn't speak for her
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:35.100]  so I'm not judging people
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:37.100]  that's what Blair Wyatt has decided to do
[02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:39.100]  with that body
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:41.100]  and that is what adults can do
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:43.100]  like women get breast implants
[02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:45.100]  whatever
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:47.100]  I'm not judging Blair Wyatt
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:49.100]  they are very consistent
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:51.100]  they say we hate transgender
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:53.100]  we want to stop transgender
[02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:55.100]  we want to hurt transgender
[02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:57.100]  no, the transgender movement
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:59.100]  there's always been men that thought they were women
[02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:01.100]  there's always been stuff like that
[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:03.100]  a very small percentage
[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:05.100]  but now they are making it the national motto
[02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:07.100]  they're pushing it on the kids
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:09.100]  and it is a weapon system to hurt our children
[02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:11.100]  right, but you still kind of play along with her
[02:02:11.100 --> 02:02:13.100]  and call him or her
[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:15.100]  so it's confusing because I'm like
[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:17.100]  more like Blair Witch
[02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:19.100]  well I'll say this
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:21.100]  look, when you have a giant fat dude
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:23.100]  you know, in wrestling
[02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:25.100]  competing against women or a dude that's two feet taller
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:27.100]  competing against women and swimming
[02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:29.100]  again, Blair Wyatt is not going into women's sports
[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:31.100]  Blair Wyatt is not attacking women
[02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:33.100]  Blair Wyatt is not doing any of that
[02:02:33.100 --> 02:02:35.100]  and so I've said that when I've interviewed
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:37.100]  Blair Wyatt and I think Blair Wyatt is a very nice
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:39.100]  person, okay, so that's
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:41.100]  where I'm at, that's where I've always been
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:43.100]  and the left wants to say
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:45.100]  oh, Jones hates transgender people
[02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:47.100]  and then you're like, hey, you're being a hypocrite
[02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:49.100]  you say you hate transgender people
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:51.100]  but you like Blair Wyatt
[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:53.100]  as a nice person, no, I never said I hated transgender people
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:55.100]  oh yeah, not hate them, but I'm saying
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:57.100]  we can stand against them
[02:02:57.100 --> 02:02:59.100]  and reach out to them, but not play along
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:01.100]  and keep poses on them
[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:03.100]  Blair Wyatt said to me
[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:05.100]  after the podcast
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:07.100]  that, you know, you've really taught me
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:09.100]  about the chemicals and what happened to me
[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:11.100]  and it's really helped me understand
[02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:13.100]  what happened to me
[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:15.100]  so I mean
[02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:17.100]  and I'm not sure exactly what happened to Blair Wyatt
[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:19.100]  but Blair Wyatt really
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:21.100]  feels like a woman and is not a bad person
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:23.100]  and I'm not attacking
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:25.100]  her
[02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:27.100]  because she feels like she's a woman
[02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:29.100]  I'm simply saying she's not a biological woman
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:31.100]  he's not a biological person
[02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:33.100]  it is a nice person
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:35.100]  a smart person, a person
[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:37.100]  I like, okay
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:39.100]  I think Blair Wyatt is a nice person, I like Blair Wyatt
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:41.100]  so I don't hate
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:43.100]  I don't hate gay people
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:45.100]  I don't hate anybody, okay
[02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:47.100]  I hate the fact that the globalists
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:49.100]  are pushing this agenda on our children
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:51.100]  and it needs to stop, and our children
[02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:53.100]  need to be kept innocent, that's what I'm saying
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:55.100]  but she's like on Instagram
[02:03:55.100 --> 02:04:07.100]  with like, it's like the strategic
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:09.100]  he's posing on the Instagram with like
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:11.100]  holding guns and
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:13.100]  American flags and it's like that strategic
[02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:15.100]  capture you talk about
[02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:17.100]  and then it's like pictures with you too
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:19.100]  and it's like, I mean
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:21.100]  yeah it's not a secret
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:23.100]  that I've been on Blair Wyatt's podcast
[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:25.100]  it is not a secret
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:27.100]  it is not a secret and I did not make it a secret
[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:29.100]  and I told you earlier
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:31.100]  I am not a hypocrite
[02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:33.100]  and I am not up here, I have my own
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:35.100]  things in my life that could be better
[02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:37.100]  I'm not going to judge somebody
[02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:39.100]  that's an adult and has made the decision
[02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:41.100]  to live as a woman, I am not against
[02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:43.100]  Blair Wyatt
[02:04:43.100 --> 02:04:45.100]  and so if you think I'm like a
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:47.100]  Baptist preacher that doesn't ever speak out
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:49.100]  against abortion but tells you don't say the G.D.
[02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:51.100]  I'm not that person, dude
[02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:53.100]  I'm fighting the big, huge issues
[02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:55.100]  I love God and I love people
[02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:57.100]  I appreciate your call
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:01.100]  If Alex Jones runs for President
[02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:03.100]  in the Republican Party
[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:05.100]  he has a chance of winning
[02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:35.100]  and when the shirts are gone
[02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:37.100]  they're gone, we're doing one run
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:39.100]  of Alex Jones for President
[02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:41.100]  2024 shirts
[02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:43.100]  and we'll have a historic memento
[02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:45.100]  be able to spread the word, meet a lot of
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:47.100]  like minded people and he'll be able to
[02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:49.100]  keep us on the air
[02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:51.100]  No way, no way, that's a bridge too far
[02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:53.100]  that's, no, it can't be
[02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:55.100]  and I said on national television that he was going to win
[02:05:55.100 --> 02:05:57.100]  at infowarsstore.com
[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:09.100]  Music
[02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:11.100]  Live from the infowars.com studios
[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:13.100]  it's Alex Jones
[02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:15.100]  Music
[02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:17.100]  Music
[02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:19.100]  Music
[02:06:19.100 --> 02:06:21.100]  Alright, we're taking phone calls right now
[02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:23.100]  I'm going to go right back to your calls
[02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:25.100]  some stations don't carry the first five minutes
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:27.100]  but a lot do
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:29.100]  that's when they carry news
[02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:31.100]  and so a lot of you might have missed the call
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:33.100]  it's very reasonable and I appreciate your call
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:35.100]  and said, you're really worried
[02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:37.100]  about transgenderism and our children
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.100]  but you've gone on Blair White
[02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:41.100]  it was a very nice transgender
[02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:43.100]  male to female person
[02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:45.100]  who first came on my show as a
[02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:47.100]  listener ten years ago to say
[02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:49.100]  that they did not believe in targeting children
[02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:51.100]  and gun control and the whole
[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:53.100]  leftist ideology attached
[02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:55.100]  to
[02:06:55.100 --> 02:06:57.100]  Blair White's decision to be
[02:06:57.100 --> 02:06:59.100]  what Blair White is
[02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:01.100]  I said, I don't hate anybody
[02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:03.100]  I don't want the targeting of children
[02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:05.100]  I don't want the sexualization of children by Rachel Levine
[02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:07.100]  I don't want them covering up fluoride in the water
[02:07:07.100 --> 02:07:09.100]  for the children, there's an evil agenda
[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:11.100]  that is behind pushing this to children
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:13.100]  and Caitlyn Jenner and all the rest of it
[02:07:13.100 --> 02:07:15.100]  that doesn't mean then
[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:17.100]  I hate people
[02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:19.100]  I'm not comparing myself to Jesus, but Jesus hung out with
[02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:21.100]  prostitutes and tax collectors
[02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:23.100]  and what was seen as the worst in society
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:25.100]  and he pointed out
[02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:27.100]  but look at the Pharisees, they're doing far worse
[02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:29.100]  the first step behind closed doors, they're hypocrites
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:31.100]  and so
[02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:33.100]  that's where I'm at, I agree
[02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:35.100]  we are who we really are born as
[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:37.100]  we should accept what God did
[02:07:37.100 --> 02:07:39.100]  the system is trying to confuse that, confuse children
[02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:41.100]  but the people that have been sucked in
[02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:43.100]  by this
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:45.100]  that's why it's gone from one in a thousand being transgender
[02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:47.100]  fifty years ago
[02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:49.100]  to one in ten
[02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:51.100]  in San Francisco with the kids
[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:53.100]  is because they're confusing them
[02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:55.100]  they ask little boys, do you like little boys or little girls
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:57.100]  I like little boys more, little boys want to play with little boys
[02:07:57.100 --> 02:07:59.100]  oh, you're gay
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:01.100]  or little girls, you like little girls, you're a lesbian
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:03.100]  so yeah, we know the evil agenda
[02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:05.100]  I spend hours a week, sometimes hours a day
[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:07.100]  talking about this, but it doesn't mean
[02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:09.100]  we hate the individual
[02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:11.100]  if Blair White was saying
[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:13.100]  I want to sexualize children and I want to take kids away from people
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:15.100]  and sterilize them, I would say Blair White was the devil
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:17.100]  we should get Blair White on the show soon
[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:19.100]  but Blair White's been speaking out
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:21.100]  for a decade since Blair White went public
[02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:23.100]  against that
[02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:25.100]  so all I'm saying is
[02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:27.100]  I don't hate people
[02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:29.100]  as long as they're adults and not hurting
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:31.100]  any innocent people
[02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:33.100]  okay?
[02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:35.100]  and so to me
[02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:37.100]  to talk about scales of evil
[02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:39.100]  going out and drunk driving where you could potentially kill somebody
[02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:41.100]  on a scale of things that's
[02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:43.100]  against God is way worse
[02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:45.100]  than somebody getting confused when they're young
[02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:47.100]  going through this process
[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:49.100]  and then now they are this thing
[02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:51.100]  and we're going to hate them
[02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:53.100]  and we should reach out to these people
[02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:55.100]  so they're not controlled by this ideology
[02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:57.100]  and the left wants to ban
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:08:59.100]  the populace, the Christians, the right wing
[02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:01.100]  reaching out to people and saying
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:03.100]  hey, maybe you're not happy in your gay lifestyle
[02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:05.100]  because it's so on average
[02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:07.100]  corrupt and uses people
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:09.100]  and leaves you
[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:11.100]  isolated and depressed
[02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:13.100]  not because people are being mean to you because you're gay
[02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:15.100]  but because the lifestyle
[02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:17.100]  and the people in it are so incredibly
[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:19.100]  destructive
[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:21.100]  the gay man or the lesbian woman
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:23.100]  I'm saying the group you're in statistically
[02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:25.100]  is who is abusing you
[02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:27.100]  and the system
[02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:29.100]  likes what's happened to you as trying to promote it
[02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:31.100]  because it sees it as destructive so you won't have children
[02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:33.100]  and it'll break down society
[02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:35.100]  they're using you as a victim
[02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:37.100]  and when someone says
[02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:39.100]  hey, I want to be conservative, hey, I want to figure out
[02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:41.100]  what happened, hey, I don't like the leftist agenda
[02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:43.100]  that's the beginning of an outreach
[02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:45.100]  to these people instead of hating them
[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:47.100]  and that's really where I am
[02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:49.100]  so I don't sit up here and go
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:51.100]  well you're gay
[02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:53.100]  and so I'm better than you
[02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:55.100]  because no
[02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:57.100]  I need to understand that, I need to know that
[02:09:57.100 --> 02:09:59.100]  and then it has any political agenda that's leftist
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:01.100]  or going after kids, you're my enemy
[02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:03.100]  and they're now trying to get the left
[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:05.100]  and all the people that are confused
[02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:07.100]  about what they are to join in the agenda
[02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:09.100]  of World War III and open borders
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:11.100]  and brainwashing kids
[02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:13.100]  they're sucking them all in
[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:15.100]  and telling them we're all out to get them and hate them
[02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:17.100]  I think we should be more Christ-like
[02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:19.100]  and tell these people no, we care about you
[02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:21.100]  and we really want you to understand the bigger agenda
[02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:23.100]  we're all discovering this together at the same time
[02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:25.100]  Rob Aguero is one of the producers
[02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:27.100]  one of the researchers in there
[02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:29.100]  he wanted to pop in because I was asked the crew, they were viewed during the break
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:31.100]  and I think Rob had a very important facet to this
[02:10:31.100 --> 02:10:33.100]  go ahead, Rob
[02:10:33.100 --> 02:10:35.100]  alright Alex, you hit the nail on the head when you said
[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:37.100]  that it's all about confusion
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:39.100]  these people are confused
[02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:41.100]  and you're right, we need to lend a hand out and actually help these people
[02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:43.100]  and it goes back to
[02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:45.100]  you know, our caller, he's confused as well
[02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:47.100]  because we're pushing
[02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:49.100]  or we're not pushing, we're
[02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:51.100]  giving a platform to these people to talk
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:53.100]  but like you said, it's because we don't hate them
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:55.100]  and we need to reach out and help them
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:57.100]  and anybody else, so everybody
[02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:59.100]  who, you know, which for lack of better words
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:01.100]  is a Bible thumper who follows Christ very very heavily
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:03.100]  they're confused
[02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:05.100]  because we're not
[02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:07.100]  disowning them, which they shouldn't be doing at all
[02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:09.100]  we don't hate anybody
[02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:11.100]  they shouldn't be hating anybody
[02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:13.100]  no matter how different their ideology is
[02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:15.100]  we should be lending the hand out and helping them
[02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:17.100]  to realize that hey, this is not
[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:19.100]  if you're going to live this Christ-like
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:21.100]  life, then this is not
[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:23.100]  you want to believe that God gave you
[02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:25.100]  the body and you want to trust God
[02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:27.100]  then you need to realize that you might be
[02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:29.100]  confused and we're here to help you
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:31.100]  so nobody ever hates anybody
[02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:33.100]  especially in this establishment
[02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:35.100]  all we want is society to get along
[02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:37.100]  and help people further
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.100]  because if we keep getting divided and fighting over
[02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:41.100]  these stupid things like the Bud Light
[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:43.100]  or like
[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:45.100]  Gillette, I mean we're
[02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:47.100]  only getting further and further apart
[02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:49.100]  and they're only winning
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:51.100]  Absolutely, and everything the system pushes is destructive
[02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:53.100]  and I'll say this, I hate the sin and I can't help it
[02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:55.100]  I hate people that target kids, I hate pedophiles
[02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:57.100]  I hate the globalist, I hate David Rockefeller
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:11:59.100]  I hate Zbigniew Brzezinski, I hate
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:01.100]  Bill Gates, but at the same time
[02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:03.100]  I catch myself sometimes driving in the car
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:05.100]  just thinking about the most horrible
[02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:07.100]  thoughts about my enemies
[02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:09.100]  the horrible things I want to do to them and God says
[02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:11.100]  that's not Christ-like, defeat them, stop them
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:13.100]  and do that, but don't get
[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:15.100]  on their level, don't
[02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:17.100]  give them the hate back, love is
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:19.100]  more powerful, there's a stronger force
[02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:21.100]  and so that's what it comes down
[02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:23.100]  to, I mean I've gone on Blair White's
[02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:25.100]  show and explained how they put chemicals in the water
[02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:27.100]  to confuse kids and try to target
[02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:29.100]  them when they're little to break them up with their families
[02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:31.100]  and how that's wrong and then Blair White agrees
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:33.100]  I'm reaching out to that whole audience
[02:12:33.100 --> 02:12:35.100]  and then you read all these transgender people in the comments
[02:12:35.100 --> 02:12:37.100]  going, oh I see why they don't like Alex, he's actually nice
[02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:39.100]  yeah I do think they're doing this to us
[02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:41.100]  blah blah blah, I don't feel that way either
[02:12:41.100 --> 02:12:43.100]  we're not letting the Democrats brand who
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:45.100]  that group is that's growing and exploding
[02:12:45.100 --> 02:12:47.100]  because they've set them up
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:49.100]  as the victims, Rob, anything else?
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:51.100]  No, you said it right, I mean
[02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:53.100]  they keep coming after their kids and we have to come together
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:55.100]  like whether you disagree with Blair
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.100]  with what Blair's doing, I mean
[02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:59.100]  she's saving the kids, so at least reach
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:01.100]  out a hand and be like, hey, let's do this
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:03.100]  together instead of hating everybody at the same time
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:05.100]  Absolutely, and you know the people get back
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:07.100]  and you said, sheesh, it's a
[02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:09.100]  man who believes they're a woman
[02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:11.100]  living as a woman, and
[02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:13.100]  you can say, yeah that's a biological man
[02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:15.100]  we don't hate the person, we don't disrespect
[02:13:15.100 --> 02:13:17.100]  the person, we understand the brainwashing
[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:19.100]  the programming, the chemicals
[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:21.100]  that have led to all of this
[02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:23.100]  and we are all in this same process as well
[02:13:23.100 --> 02:13:25.100]  we need to recognize what's been done
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:27.100]  to us and pull back in a compassionate
[02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:29.100]  way so that those that aren't evil
[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:31.100]  will join us and then we're going to win
[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:33.100]  I appreciate you being with us
[02:13:33.100 --> 02:13:35.100]  Alright, I said I get the calls, I'm kind of doing an okay job
[02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:37.100]  but not as good as I've been doing lately
[02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:39.100]  So let's just rampage now through calls
[02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:41.100]  The caller's bringing up great points, we're having larger discussions
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:43.100]  David in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:45.100]  Hey, Alex, I got a good connection
[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:47.100]  Yes sir, go ahead
[02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:49.100]  Um, um
[02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:51.100]  There's a lot of problems going on, a lot of people
[02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:53.100]  are talking about different types of monetary systems
[02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:55.100]  A lot of people
[02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:57.100]  have talked bad about the universal
[02:13:57.100 --> 02:13:59.100]  basic income, what I'm proposing
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:01.100]  is something similar to universal
[02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:03.100]  basic income but
[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:05.100]  a big difference, universal
[02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:07.100]  basic income, you have to borrow
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:09.100]  the money, what I'm proposing
[02:14:09.100 --> 02:14:11.100]  is what's called a national dividend
[02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:13.100]  For years
[02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:15.100]  I was the producer for
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:17.100]  Byron Dale's radio show
[02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:19.100]  and we had everybody on with
[02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:21.100]  monetary ideas, post office
[02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:23.100]  banks, gold bugs, silver bugs
[02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:25.100]  bitcoin, etc.
[02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:27.100]  modern money
[02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:29.100]  The best one I heard
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:31.100]  was from Dick Eastman
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:33.100]  on the tri-city areas of
[02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:35.100]  Washington state, it was a national
[02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:37.100]  dividend where the money is created
[02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:39.100]  debt free
[02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:41.100]  and is given out to the
[02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:43.100]  public on a
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:45.100]  gross national product basis
[02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:47.100]  All money
[02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:49.100]  And then the public decides how to use it and that's a real stimulus
[02:14:49.100 --> 02:14:51.100]  Instead the globalists want a
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:53.100]  universal basic income where they say where you can spend it
[02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:55.100]  We could do the reverse of that
[02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:57.100]  and say it's got to be spent
[02:14:57.100 --> 02:14:59.100]  with grassroots, with organic farms
[02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:01.100]  with local businesses
[02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:03.100]  but again the globalist model will be the
[02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:05.100]  opposite
[02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:07.100]  Exactly, so this is something
[02:15:07.100 --> 02:15:09.100]  I don't know if I'll see it in my lifetime
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:11.100]  I doubt if you'll see it
[02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:13.100]  There are some steps that can be made
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:15.100]  You know Ellen Brown with the state
[02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:17.100]  bank system, that's a public
[02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:19.100]  banking system
[02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:21.100]  It doesn't even have to be a state bank
[02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:23.100]  I totally agree, we need
[02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:25.100]  state banks and federal banks
[02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:27.100]  There was a big fight at the beginning of the country
[02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:29.100]  over that and we went with the
[02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:31.100]  private bank model, I think you have government banks
[02:15:31.100 --> 02:15:33.100]  and state banks and local
[02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:35.100]  banks, private banks
[02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:37.100]  I think the model is a hybrid
[02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:39.100]  of all of them
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:41.100]  Absolutely
[02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:43.100]  And I think we should have competing currencies
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:45.100]  People should be able to accept whatever currency they want
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:47.100]  and then the markets that are
[02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:49.100]  most conducive to human life will be adopted
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:51.100]  through the free market and that's what we'll end up with
[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:53.100]  Hold on, you probably have more to add, give me 60 seconds more
[02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:55.100]  David, we'll come back, stay with us
[02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:23.100]  Thanks for watching

[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:01.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:03.100]  of the new world order
[02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:05.100]  It's Alex Jones
[02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:07.100]  And we are back
[02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:09.100]  Alright, for those of you that just joined us
[02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:11.100]  David just called in
[02:20:11.100 --> 02:20:13.100]  We called him over from Ohio
[02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:15.100]  He's talking about monetary diversity
[02:20:15.100 --> 02:20:17.100]  Instead we have monetary
[02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:19.100]  vertical, vertical, vertical
[02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:19.100] ange
[02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:21.100]  banks all over the world and just a few mega banks
[02:20:21.100 --> 02:20:23.100]  and they're bringing out the world
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:25.100]  central bank digital currency system
[02:20:25.100 --> 02:20:27.100]  that tracks what you do
[02:20:27.100 --> 02:20:29.100]  controls what you do
[02:20:29.100 --> 02:20:31.100]  decides where you're going to spend money
[02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:33.100]  devalues money
[02:20:33.100 --> 02:20:35.100]  does whatever it wants
[02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:37.100]  it is the world's
[02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:39.100]  digital currency system
[02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:41.100]  that controls what you do
[02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:43.100]  decides where you're going to spend money
[02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:45.100]  devalues money
[02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:47.100]  does whatever it wants
[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:49.100]  devalues money
[02:20:49.100 --> 02:20:51.100]  does whatever it wants
[02:20:51.100 --> 02:20:53.100]  it is the absolute in game of these people
[02:20:53.100 --> 02:20:55.100]  and he's talking about federal banks
[02:20:55.100 --> 02:20:57.100]  state banks
[02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:59.100]  local banks
[02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:01.100]  and also private corporate banks
[02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:03.100]  we need more banks, we need more currencies
[02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:05.100]  any other points you'd like to add David?
[02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:07.100]  Yeah, there's just one more point I wanted to make
[02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:09.100]  and I make a lot of enemies
[02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:11.100]  when I say this
[02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:13.100]  I want to make it real clear
[02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:15.100]  you'll hear a lot of discussion about
[02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:17.100]  our fiat money
[02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:19.100]  is not backed by anything
[02:21:19.100 --> 02:21:21.100]  and I want to make it real clear to everyone
[02:21:21.100 --> 02:21:23.100]  our money, our fiat money
[02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:25.100]  is fully backed
[02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:27.100]  the only way money is created
[02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:29.100]  is through a loan
[02:21:29.100 --> 02:21:31.100]  if you get a mortgage, your house backs the money
[02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:33.100]  if you get a car
[02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:35.100]  the car backs the money
[02:21:35.100 --> 02:21:37.100]  if you go to college, your labor backs the money
[02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:39.100]  that's how money is created
[02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:41.100]  and if you can go back to the
[02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:43.100]  Federal Reserve Act discussion
[02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:45.100]  there were some smart congressmen
[02:21:45.100 --> 02:21:47.100]  they said, hey, if we do this
[02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:49.100]  what's going to back our money?
[02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:51.100]  and their questions were answered
[02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:53.100]  all the assets and all the labor
[02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:55.100]  of all Americans back our money
[02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:57.100]  and that's the problem
[02:21:57.100 --> 02:21:59.100]  that's what backs our money
[02:21:59.100 --> 02:22:01.100]  so if the Chinese come in and say
[02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:03.100]  we got treasury bonds
[02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:05.100]  we want Yellowstone
[02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:07.100]  we have to sell it to them
[02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:09.100]  we want all the docks on the west coast
[02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:11.100]  oh hey, not just the Chinese
[02:22:11.100 --> 02:22:13.100]  the Brazilian government pledged the national lands
[02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:15.100]  everything to Pfizer
[02:22:15.100 --> 02:22:17.100]  to give an experimental shot
[02:22:17.100 --> 02:22:19.100]  so they knew it was deadly, they knew it was a problem
[02:22:19.100 --> 02:22:21.100]  they knew it would cause liability
[02:22:21.100 --> 02:22:23.100]  and then those companies now have the country's mortgage to them
[02:22:23.100 --> 02:22:25.100]  a perfect plan, thanks for the call
[02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:27.100]  perfect unless it gets exposed
[02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:29.100]  Rick in Tennessee, thanks for holding her on the air
[02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:35.100]  yeah, hi Alex, it's an honor
[02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:37.100]  honor
[02:22:37.100 --> 02:22:39.100]  just so people know
[02:22:39.100 --> 02:22:41.100]  I'm not shooting from the hip
[02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:43.100]  I want to give a little background
[02:22:43.100 --> 02:22:45.100]  I was raised as a farm boy
[02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:47.100]  I lived in land that was taken by New York City
[02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:49.100]  for the reservoir
[02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:51.100]  I ended up in Vietnam
[02:22:51.100 --> 02:22:53.100]  and after that I worked for a pharmaceutical company
[02:22:53.100 --> 02:22:55.100]  and then I went to medical school
[02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:57.100]  certainly I've lost faith in all that
[02:22:57.100 --> 02:22:59.100]  I think that
[02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:01.100]  people have had it too easy for too long
[02:23:01.100 --> 02:23:03.100]  in this country
[02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:05.100]  they need to start practicing hardships
[02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:07.100]  one thing
[02:23:07.100 --> 02:23:09.100]  one thing they can do is they can boycott
[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:11.100]  all these wool companies
[02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:13.100]  now when it comes to Bud Light
[02:23:13.100 --> 02:23:15.100]  it's more than that, it's Anheuser-Busch
[02:23:15.100 --> 02:23:17.100]  people need to do the research and look at those things
[02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:19.100]  and cut them off
[02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:21.100]  when they have a hundred million people
[02:23:21.100 --> 02:23:23.100]  that aren't following these companies
[02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:25.100]  and aren't buying their stuff
[02:23:25.100 --> 02:23:27.100]  then they'll start waking up
[02:23:27.100 --> 02:23:29.100]  the other thing I'd suggest is for people
[02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:31.100]  to get off social media
[02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:33.100]  all it is is just a cluster
[02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:35.100]  the better thing
[02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:37.100]  one thing that they can do is
[02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:39.100]  be to contact the reps
[02:23:39.100 --> 02:23:41.100]  contact bill sponsors
[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:43.100]  talk to people in their state about
[02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:45.100]  secession
[02:23:45.100 --> 02:23:47.100]  anything they hear is all propaganda
[02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:49.100]  and lies
[02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:51.100]  you've elucidated it very well
[02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:53.100]  one other thing I want to say
[02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:55.100]  is I want to go back to one of your old ads
[02:23:55.100 --> 02:23:57.100]  and that is that people are sitting on money
[02:23:57.100 --> 02:23:59.100]  your money isn't going to be any good
[02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:01.100]  you need to get out there
[02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:03.100]  and support companies like you
[02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:05.100]  people need to, if they want to look to the future
[02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:07.100]  and what they can do
[02:24:07.100 --> 02:24:09.100]  for their families and homes
[02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:11.100]  they need to get your book
[02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:13.100]  they need to get Flynn's book
[02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:15.100]  they need to get a homesteading book
[02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:17.100]  you can't just move from the city out
[02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:19.100]  and buy a little piece of country
[02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:21.100]  and think you're going to make it on a farm
[02:24:21.100 --> 02:24:23.100]  believe me, I know from the farm days
[02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:25.100]  we had a dairy farm and it was constant work
[02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:27.100]  the other thing is
[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:29.100]  that words mean a lot
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:31.100]  they really matter
[02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:33.100]  this isn't corruption that we're seeing
[02:24:33.100 --> 02:24:35.100]  it's criminality, these people are criminals
[02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:41.100]  all these people we're dealing with are insane
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:43.100]  they don't think of collateral damage
[02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:45.100]  they have their sights set on one thing
[02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:47.100]  the whole thing's going to implode
[02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:49.100]  they're going to lose in the end
[02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:51.100]  because truth and rationality come through
[02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:53.100]  sooner or later, people have to face reality
[02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:55.100]  so reality wins by default
[02:24:55.100 --> 02:24:57.100]  so people can keep their heads about them
[02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:59.100]  look at things
[02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:01.100]  look at the truth, search for the truth
[02:25:01.100 --> 02:25:03.100]  don't believe anything you're seeing and hearing
[02:25:03.100 --> 02:25:05.100]  because it's all propaganda and lies
[02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:07.100]  that's obvious
[02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:09.100]  by listening to Biden
[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:11.100]  search for the truth
[02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:13.100]  search for reality
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:15.100]  and go that route
[02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:17.100]  because you're going to end up winning in the end
[02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:19.100]  and that's basically what I wanted to say
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:21.100]  I couldn't say it any better
[02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:23.100]  than you just said it, Rick
[02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:25.100]  their system's coming down
[02:25:25.100 --> 02:25:27.100]  their old bubble is collapsing
[02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:29.100]  it poses a savior as the old bubble goes down
[02:25:29.100 --> 02:25:31.100]  to bring in a scam a hundred times worse
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:33.100]  and we can't let them do it
[02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:35.100]  thank you so much for the call
[02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:37.100]  we're going to have another call in a moment
[02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:39.100]  but first, please remember, I didn't even plug last hour
[02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:41.100]  we've got the great Alex Jones for President t-shirt
[02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:43.100]  that's a very thought provoking shirt
[02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:45.100]  great looking shirt, high quality fabric
[02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:47.100]  and we also have the Trump Mugshot shirt
[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:49.100]  political prisoner
[02:25:49.100 --> 02:25:51.100]  and it's a fundraiser shirt
[02:25:51.100 --> 02:25:53.100]  they're both high quality shirts
[02:25:53.100 --> 02:25:55.100]  infowarsstore.com
[02:25:55.100 --> 02:25:57.100]  or triple eight
[02:25:57.100 --> 02:25:59.100]  two five three
[02:25:59.100 --> 02:26:01.100]  three one three nine
[02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:03.100]  get the two limited edition shirts now
[02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:05.100]  at infowarsstore.com
[02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:07.100]  and I thank you all
[02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:09.100]  for your support
[02:26:09.100 --> 02:26:11.100]  we cannot fund the operation without you
[02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:13.100]  thank you so much, infowarsstore.com
[02:26:13.100 --> 02:26:15.100]  ok
[02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:17.100]  let's go back to the calls
[02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:19.100]  Steve and Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead
[02:26:19.100 --> 02:26:21.100]  yes sir, Alex, God bless you brother
[02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:23.100]  keep up the good work
[02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:25.100]  I just want to make a point about
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:27.100]  Trump, when he said
[02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:29.100]  the first time he was going to get in there
[02:26:29.100 --> 02:26:31.100]  and drain the swamp
[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:33.100]  after it was all said and done
[02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:35.100]  I heard him making speeches
[02:26:35.100 --> 02:26:37.100]  after the term was over
[02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:39.100]  he said he didn't know
[02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:41.100]  who the bad people were when he got
[02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:43.100]  in there the first time
[02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:45.100]  and now that he knows who they are
[02:26:45.100 --> 02:26:47.100]  if he gets back in there
[02:26:47.100 --> 02:26:49.100]  he's going to get them, they're going to prison
[02:26:49.100 --> 02:26:51.100]  now, should we give him a second chance
[02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:53.100]  or not?
[02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:55.100]  that's what I want to make a point about
[02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:57.100]  I think we should
[02:26:57.100 --> 02:26:59.100]  by the way, I love your voice
[02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:01.100]  I have a great uncle who died a few years ago
[02:27:01.100 --> 02:27:03.100]  who talked just like you
[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:05.100]  he sounded 100% like him
[02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:07.100]  you know who he sounded like?
[02:27:07.100 --> 02:27:09.100]  Festus from Gunsmoke
[02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:11.100]  has anybody ever told you you sound like Festus?
[02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:13.100]  no, no, but I
[02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:15.100]  I went to a rodeo one time
[02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:17.100]  I was born and raised in Alabama
[02:27:17.100 --> 02:27:19.100]  same town Jim Nabors was born
[02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:21.100]  and my mother went to high school with him
[02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:23.100]  so I'm raised in Alabama
[02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:25.100]  I got this real southern voice
[02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:27.100]  and everybody in
[02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:29.100]  when they hear it the first time
[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:31.100]  never heard a real southerner talk
[02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:33.100]  they're like, where are you from?
[02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:35.100]  a lot of folks talk like you and he's Texas brother
[02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:37.100]  we love you
[02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:39.100]  yeah, and then Biden
[02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:41.100]  that one time I heard Biden say
[02:27:41.100 --> 02:27:43.100]  if we had a revolution
[02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:45.100]  if we were to rise up against the federal government
[02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:47.100]  he just kind of laughed and said
[02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:49.100]  do you know what kind of war that would be?
[02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:51.100]  with them going up against me
[02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:53.100]  and my jets
[02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:55.100]  and all the weapons that we have
[02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:57.100]  and I'm going 331 million people
[02:27:57.100 --> 02:27:59.100]  against our military
[02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:01.100]  I don't know what kind of battle that would be
[02:28:01.100 --> 02:28:03.100]  oh, sir, I want to totally agree
[02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:05.100]  if there is a real guerrilla war
[02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:07.100]  and the globalists start it
[02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:09.100]  the people know who the enemy is
[02:28:09.100 --> 02:28:11.100]  they'll be wiped out
[02:28:11.100 --> 02:28:13.100]  it's like Swallowswell said we'll use nuclear weapons
[02:28:13.100 --> 02:28:15.100]  nuclear weapons destroy whole cities, including their people
[02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:17.100]  with your guns shooting on F-16s
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:19.100]  you take out
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:21.100]  I'm not saying do this
[02:28:21.100 --> 02:28:23.100]  you take them out when they're on the ground
[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:25.100]  you take out the pilots on the ground
[02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:27.100]  you take them out of their house
[02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:29.100]  these people know nothing about warfare
[02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:31.100]  that say they're going to start a war with the American people and win
[02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:33.100]  they're fools
[02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:35.100]  yeah, they don't know what they're doing when they get in the fight
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:37.100]  with the southern people anyway
[02:28:37.100 --> 02:28:39.100]  because we're going to shoot first and ask questions later
[02:28:39.100 --> 02:28:41.100]  and I'm prepared
[02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:43.100]  I've got plenty of ammo
[02:28:43.100 --> 02:28:45.100]  I understand
[02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:47.100]  we know how to skin a bucket, run a trot line
[02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:49.100]  and do a lot of other stuff
[02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:51.100]  alright, appreciate your call, brother
[02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:53.100]  really appreciate your call
[02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:55.100]  alright, more phone calls are straight ahead
[02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:57.100]  stay with us
[02:29:13.100 --> 02:29:15.100]  Alex Jones was wrong
[02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:17.100]  Alex has been right on toward over a decade
[02:29:17.100 --> 02:29:19.100]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it
[02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:21.100]  flip it up or rub it down
[02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:23.100]  Alex Jones was right
[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:25.100]  think about how frustrated we are
[02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:27.100]  if you've been awake for a year or two
[02:29:27.100 --> 02:29:29.100]  imagine being like an Alex Jones
[02:29:29.100 --> 02:29:31.100]  or those guys who've been awake for like decades
[02:29:31.100 --> 02:29:33.100]  Alex Jones called this years ago
[02:29:33.100 --> 02:29:35.100]  years ago
[02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:37.100]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax
[02:29:37.100 --> 02:29:39.100]  not for a second
[02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:41.100]  you are one of the great thinkers of this
[02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:43.100]  you're a martyr to the first amendment
[02:29:43.100 --> 02:29:45.100]  the government fears
[02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:47.100]  Alex Jones
[02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:49.100]  that's why the globalists hate me
[02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:51.100]  is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny
[02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:03.100]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life
[02:30:03.100 --> 02:30:05.100]  and Infowars
[02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:07.100]  for decades has been at the very forefront
[02:30:07.100 --> 02:30:09.100]  of the fight for a pro-human future
[02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:11.100]  we can't stay on air without your help

[02:30:47.100 --> 02:30:49.100]  are exclusively available at Infowarsstore.com as well
[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:51.100]  in the last month I got a little busy
[02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:53.100]  so I didn't sign the books we didn't have them for sale
[02:30:53.100 --> 02:30:55.100]  but now I sign the last books and get them right now
[02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:01.100]  I intend to take
[02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:03.100]  the Infowars
[02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:05.100]  armored truck out
[02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:07.100]  or the Infowars tank as it's so lovingly called
[02:31:07.100 --> 02:31:09.100]  you came through yesterday
[02:31:09.100 --> 02:31:11.100]  and shopped at Infowarsstore.com
[02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:13.100]  so I'm going to be able to take the truck out
[02:31:35.100 --> 02:32:01.100]  Infowars
[02:32:01.100 --> 02:32:03.100]  tomorrow's news, today
[02:32:03.100 --> 02:32:05.100]  is their big move
[02:32:05.100 --> 02:32:07.100]  so yeah, you say why doesn't Biden address the disasters
[02:32:07.100 --> 02:32:09.100]  in the United States?
[02:32:09.100 --> 02:32:11.100]  he doesn't care
[02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:13.100]  that's not his job, he's not the president of the United States
[02:32:13.100 --> 02:32:15.100]  he's a puppet
[02:32:15.100 --> 02:32:17.100]  operating for the globalists
[02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:19.100]  appetites of the autocrat
[02:32:19.100 --> 02:32:21.100]  cannot be appeased
[02:32:21.100 --> 02:32:23.100]  they must be opposed
[02:32:23.100 --> 02:32:25.100]  autocrats only understand
[02:32:25.100 --> 02:32:27.100]  one word
[02:32:27.100 --> 02:32:29.100]  no, no, no
[02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:31.100]  exactly
[02:32:31.100 --> 02:32:33.100]  we say no to your vaccines
[02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:35.100]  we say no
[02:32:35.100 --> 02:32:37.100]  to you shutting down our businesses
[02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:39.100]  we say no to you taking our firearms
[02:32:39.100 --> 02:32:41.100]  we say no to you censoring our free speech
[02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:43.100]  we say no to you
[02:32:43.100 --> 02:32:45.100]  selling us out to the World Health Organization
[02:32:45.100 --> 02:32:47.100]  we say no to you getting us into World War 3
[02:32:47.100 --> 02:32:49.100]  you're right
[02:32:49.100 --> 02:32:51.100]  we stand against autocrats like you Joe Biden
[02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:53.100]  and we say no
[02:32:53.100 --> 02:32:55.100]  and we say no to your war
[02:32:55.100 --> 02:32:59.100]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order
[02:32:59.100 --> 02:33:01.100]  it's Alex Jones
[02:33:19.100 --> 02:33:21.100]  live from Austin, Texas
[02:33:21.100 --> 02:33:23.100]  broadcasting worldwide
[02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:25.100]  it's Alex Jones
[02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:55.100]  and this short war
[02:33:55.100 --> 02:33:57.100]  Swallowswell talks about
[02:33:57.100 --> 02:33:59.100]  and it'd be a short war my friend
[02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:01.100]  the government has nukes
[02:34:01.100 --> 02:34:03.100]  too many of them, but they're legit
[02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:05.100]  I'm sure if we talked we could find common ground to protect our families and communities
[02:34:05.100 --> 02:34:07.100]  and Biden said
[02:34:07.100 --> 02:34:09.100]  you know, they've got F-18s
[02:34:09.100 --> 02:34:11.100]  or whatever
[02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:13.100]  the real war
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:15.100]  before it becomes physical which we want to stop
[02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:17.100]  is knowing who the globalists are
[02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:19.100]  and that they stage attacks
[02:34:19.100 --> 02:34:21.100]  and that they want a physical war because they're losing
[02:34:21.100 --> 02:34:23.100]  the real war is not having the physical war
[02:34:23.100 --> 02:34:25.100]  winning it peacefully
[02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:27.100]  but if it does go to that
[02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:29.100]  they release a new virus, you know, they already did it
[02:34:29.100 --> 02:34:31.100]  they've done it again
[02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:33.100]  they're the ones that are behind it
[02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:35.100]  and it's not the military or the police
[02:34:35.100 --> 02:34:37.100]  they may get in the way of us having to protect ourselves
[02:34:37.100 --> 02:34:39.100]  they're keeping attackers with bioweapons
[02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:41.100]  you know, we're defending ourselves
[02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:43.100]  but you need to
[02:34:43.100 --> 02:34:45.100]  it's like in a war in the woods
[02:34:45.100 --> 02:34:47.100]  you want to not shoot the trees
[02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:49.100]  that's the police and the military
[02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:51.100]  little demons you're going after
[02:34:51.100 --> 02:34:53.100]  and so, this is a high value
[02:34:53.100 --> 02:34:55.100]  target situation if it goes to physical war
[02:34:55.100 --> 02:34:57.100]  which I'm not calling for
[02:34:57.100 --> 02:34:59.100]  so, you see the high rise
[02:34:59.100 --> 02:35:01.100]  apartment upbringing
[02:35:01.100 --> 02:35:03.100]  and I'm not bashing folks that grew up like that but they don't really
[02:35:03.100 --> 02:35:05.100]  know how the world works
[02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:07.100]  haven't studied the military, haven't studied history
[02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:09.100]  they think, oh we've got nuclear weapons
[02:35:09.100 --> 02:35:11.100]  we've got aircraft carriers, that's going to defeat
[02:35:11.100 --> 02:35:13.100]  a city
[02:35:13.100 --> 02:35:15.100]  the Russians have dumped
[02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:17.100]  now over 600,000 troops
[02:35:17.100 --> 02:35:19.100]  conservatively
[02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:21.100]  into Ukraine, they've lost at least
[02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:23.100]  200,000
[02:35:23.100 --> 02:35:25.100]  and that's because the Ukrainians
[02:35:25.100 --> 02:35:27.100]  a large portion of them
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:29.100]  are not giving up
[02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:31.100]  and they've got old beefs with the Russians even though they're basically the same people
[02:35:31.100 --> 02:35:33.100]  the Russians will fight, the Ukrainians will fight
[02:35:33.100 --> 02:35:35.100]  basically pretty close to the same group
[02:35:35.100 --> 02:35:37.100]  it's a Slavic civil war
[02:35:37.100 --> 02:35:39.100]  so, it doesn't matter how many tanks and helicopters
[02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:41.100]  and troops the Russians have
[02:35:41.100 --> 02:35:43.100]  the Ukrainians wait in their
[02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:45.100]  foxholes or wait in their dugouts
[02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:47.100]  with their rocket launchers and machine guns
[02:35:47.100 --> 02:35:49.100]  and
[02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:51.100]  wait until they see the Russians and fire for the whites
[02:35:51.100 --> 02:35:53.100]  their eyes, like Colonel Jackson said
[02:35:53.100 --> 02:35:55.100]  in 1814
[02:35:55.100 --> 02:35:57.100]  we took a little trip
[02:35:57.100 --> 02:35:59.100]  along with Colonel Jackson to the mighty Mississippi
[02:35:59.100 --> 02:36:01.100]  took a little bacon, took a little beans
[02:36:01.100 --> 02:36:03.100]  we fought the bloody British at the town of New Orleans
[02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:05.100]  let's get that song coming in the next segment
[02:36:05.100 --> 02:36:07.100]  come back to calls in a minute
[02:36:07.100 --> 02:36:09.100]  so, I don't want that war
[02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:11.100]  but if the American people know
[02:36:11.100 --> 02:36:13.100]  who the enemy is, the leftists
[02:36:13.100 --> 02:36:15.100]  the UN people, the bureaucrats
[02:36:15.100 --> 02:36:17.100]  the people that are given the orders
[02:36:17.100 --> 02:36:19.100]  it'll be like a moose hunt
[02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:21.100]  for those that don't know
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:23.100]  they only give out a few tags for moose
[02:36:23.100 --> 02:36:25.100]  there's not many of them, you've got to wait years to get a tag
[02:36:25.100 --> 02:36:27.100]  and then you've got to go out and hope you find a moose
[02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:29.100]  and then when you find them
[02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:31.100]  they're a big old target, they ain't hard to hit
[02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:35.100]  so, we don't want to go to that
[02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:37.100]  but they want to have a war
[02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:39.100]  where we're white against black
[02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:41.100]  or all gay against straight, all this stuff
[02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:43.100]  so when they start the civil war to bring us down
[02:36:43.100 --> 02:36:45.100]  we all kill each other
[02:36:45.100 --> 02:36:47.100]  we don't want to have a civil war, we don't want to kill anybody
[02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:49.100]  but if the globalists know
[02:36:49.100 --> 02:36:51.100]  the war is going to be on them
[02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:53.100]  they're not going to start this war
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:57.100]  and that's why it's important to identify
[02:36:57.100 --> 02:36:59.100]  they're the ones releasing the viruses
[02:36:59.100 --> 02:37:01.100]  identify they're the ones shipping the fentanyl
[02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:03.100]  identify they're the ones destroying the currency and cutting off the energy
[02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:05.100]  that they're the enemy, so that if they start their physical war
[02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:09.100]  then people know who actually runs things
[02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:13.100]  like if you want to get rid of a fire ant bed
[02:37:13.100 --> 02:37:15.100]  you can put
[02:37:15.100 --> 02:37:17.100]  a biological chemical on it
[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:19.100]  a biological treatment
[02:37:19.100 --> 02:37:21.100]  that sterilizes the queen
[02:37:21.100 --> 02:37:23.100]  and then the whole ant hive dies
[02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:25.100]  so if it goes to that
[02:37:25.100 --> 02:37:27.100]  I don't want to go kill all the worker ants
[02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:29.100]  and the warrior ants
[02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:31.100]  I want to get the queen
[02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:33.100]  and I don't mean physically
[02:37:33.100 --> 02:37:35.100]  you can sterilize the queen by exposing their agenda
[02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:37.100]  in the new world order
[02:37:37.100 --> 02:37:39.100]  and then there's nothing they can do because the dog won't hunt
[02:37:39.100 --> 02:37:41.100]  and that's the perfect analogy
[02:37:41.100 --> 02:37:43.100]  Texas A&M
[02:37:43.100 --> 02:37:45.100]  remember if you lived in Texas especially
[02:37:45.100 --> 02:37:47.100]  in the 80s and stuff
[02:37:47.100 --> 02:37:49.100]  fire ants were in the trees, the ground, all over your house
[02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:51.100]  they were everywhere
[02:37:51.100 --> 02:37:53.100]  I lived outside Dallas
[02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:55.100]  you'd go outside and there'd be black mounds on every field
[02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:57.100]  fire ants everywhere
[02:37:57.100 --> 02:37:59.100]  Texas A&M came up with a way to sterilize the queens
[02:37:59.100 --> 02:38:01.100]  they're 90% mitigated
[02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:03.100]  which is good because they kill most of the birds
[02:38:03.100 --> 02:38:05.100]  and other animals
[02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:07.100]  so
[02:38:07.100 --> 02:38:09.100]  I'd rather
[02:38:09.100 --> 02:38:11.100]  they're sterilizing us, they don't want a frontal attack
[02:38:11.100 --> 02:38:13.100]  I want to sterilize their ideas
[02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:15.100]  I want to castrate their ideas
[02:38:15.100 --> 02:38:17.100]  and so I keep going back to that
[02:38:17.100 --> 02:38:19.100]  that's where we're really going to win this fight
[02:38:19.100 --> 02:38:21.100]  that's why they're all about censorship because they know we know how to stop them
[02:38:21.100 --> 02:38:23.100]  not violently
[02:38:23.100 --> 02:38:25.100]  but if it does go to a physical war
[02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:29.100]  they won't be able to get leadership
[02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:31.100]  whoever their local kingpins are running it
[02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:33.100]  if those people
[02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:35.100]  take a little dirt nap
[02:38:35.100 --> 02:38:37.100]  get little angel wings pinned on their back
[02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:39.100]  but we don't want to go there
[02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:41.100]  but we also need to know
[02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:43.100]  if they release another bioweapon
[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:45.100]  they're trying to round us up and put us all in FEMA camps
[02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:47.100]  you know, I'm not going to sit here and lie to you
[02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:49.100]  I'm not going to go out and do anything
[02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:51.100]  my job
[02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:53.100]  I'll be, they'll kill my ass
[02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:55.100]  I don't say they'll kill me if I go fight them
[02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:57.100]  I mean, they really dropped the hammer
[02:38:57.100 --> 02:38:59.100]  there's a lot of folks they're going to take out
[02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:01.100]  you'll know that the hammer's getting dropped
[02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:03.100]  because a lot of us will get taken out right before they do it
[02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:05.100]  but they'll kill Senator Paul
[02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:07.100]  they'll kill Trump, they'll kill me
[02:39:07.100 --> 02:39:09.100]  they'll kill whoever they know is not going to go along
[02:39:09.100 --> 02:39:11.100]  I really don't want that to happen
[02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:13.100]  and so I'm working towards stopping it
[02:39:13.100 --> 02:39:15.100]  but I know this
[02:39:15.100 --> 02:39:17.100]  long after I'm a skeleton in the ground
[02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:19.100]  and not too long after
[02:39:19.100 --> 02:39:21.100]  our enemies will be defeated
[02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:27.100]  so that's where we're at
[02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:29.100]  we've got to win
[02:39:29.100 --> 02:39:31.100]  the children are counting on us
[02:39:31.100 --> 02:39:33.100]  thanks for holding her on the air
[02:39:33.100 --> 02:39:35.100]  hello Mr. Jones
[02:39:35.100 --> 02:39:37.100]  great to talk to you
[02:39:37.100 --> 02:39:39.100]  I'm going to be ordering an Electra Pure
[02:39:39.100 --> 02:39:41.100]  in about a half hour
[02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:43.100]  I wanted to talk to you about your friend
[02:39:43.100 --> 02:39:45.100]  and major talent
[02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:47.100]  Richard Belzer who died a few weeks ago
[02:39:47.100 --> 02:39:49.100]  you had mentioned you were going to maybe
[02:39:49.100 --> 02:39:51.100]  get back to talking about him
[02:39:51.100 --> 02:39:53.100]  and I have an amusing story
[02:39:53.100 --> 02:39:55.100]  of an experience with him
[02:39:55.100 --> 02:39:57.100]  that I think you'll enjoy
[02:39:57.100 --> 02:39:59.100]  yeah, Richard Belzer was a great guy
[02:39:59.100 --> 02:40:01.100]  really smart
[02:40:01.100 --> 02:40:03.100]  tell me the story
[02:40:03.100 --> 02:40:05.100]  okay, so I own a company that rents music gear
[02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:07.100]  out of Las Vegas, you know, drums
[02:40:07.100 --> 02:40:09.100]  guitar amps, keyboards, known as backline
[02:40:09.100 --> 02:40:11.100]  that's what that type of gear is
[02:40:11.100 --> 02:40:13.100]  and Belzer as part of his
[02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:15.100]  comedy act had a little band
[02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:17.100]  a little jazz band he would bring
[02:40:17.100 --> 02:40:19.100]  so I got sent down to
[02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:21.100]  San Diego with a big company
[02:40:21.100 --> 02:40:23.100]  to do a corporate event
[02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:25.100]  and Belzer was the talent
[02:40:25.100 --> 02:40:27.100]  I was there supporting his band
[02:40:27.100 --> 02:40:29.100]  and the
[02:40:29.100 --> 02:40:31.100]  corporation that was
[02:40:31.100 --> 02:40:33.100]  hosting the event was the
[02:40:33.100 --> 02:40:35.100]  Association of
[02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:37.100]  Pharmaceutical Retailers
[02:40:37.100 --> 02:40:39.100]  and Belzer
[02:40:39.100 --> 02:40:41.100]  completely shredded these guys
[02:40:41.100 --> 02:40:43.100]  you know, he was a real
[02:40:43.100 --> 02:40:45.100]  true
[02:40:45.100 --> 02:40:47.100]  classic liberal
[02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:49.100]  and a comedian kind of in the vein
[02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:51.100]  of a George Carlin
[02:40:51.100 --> 02:40:53.100]  so he gets up there
[02:40:53.100 --> 02:40:55.100]  and they of course made the mistake of
[02:40:55.100 --> 02:40:57.100]  hiring Belzer for their little
[02:40:57.100 --> 02:40:59.100]  pharmaceutical meeting
[02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:01.100]  he gets up and the first thing he says is
[02:41:01.100 --> 02:41:03.100]  hey, thanks for having me, pharmaceutical retailers
[02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:05.100]  anyone here from Bayer? Bayer Aspern
[02:41:05.100 --> 02:41:07.100]  anyone? Of course the people from Bayer
[02:41:07.100 --> 02:41:09.100]  wave from their little table
[02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:11.100]  and he says, hey, so you guys
[02:41:11.100 --> 02:41:13.100]  you guys invented
[02:41:13.100 --> 02:41:15.100]  heroin to help people
[02:41:15.100 --> 02:41:17.100]  get off of morphine
[02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:19.100]  way to go guys
[02:41:19.100 --> 02:41:21.100]  and of course, ooh, the hush
[02:41:21.100 --> 02:41:23.100]  goes over the crowd
[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:25.100]  in their seats, he goes over to somebody from
[02:41:25.100 --> 02:41:27.100]  CVS or Walgreens
[02:41:27.100 --> 02:41:29.100]  he's like, you know, he's walking around with a
[02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:31.100]  spotlight and a wireless mic saying
[02:41:31.100 --> 02:41:33.100]  hey, what's your name sir, you look important
[02:41:33.100 --> 02:41:35.100]  and the guy goes, John
[02:41:35.100 --> 02:41:37.100]  he's like, what do you do for a living there John
[02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:39.100]  at Walgreens? He's like, well I'm in charge of
[02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:41.100]  distribution
[02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:43.100]  so, you get to work every day
[02:41:43.100 --> 02:41:45.100]  what's your day look like? You get there, you get a cup
[02:41:45.100 --> 02:41:47.100]  of coffee, right, 9 o'clock
[02:41:47.100 --> 02:41:49.100]  what do you got to do?
[02:41:49.100 --> 02:41:51.100]  and I was like, well, I get on the phone
[02:41:51.100 --> 02:41:53.100]  and I call the distributors
[02:41:53.100 --> 02:41:55.100]  and make sure that everybody's getting the product
[02:41:55.100 --> 02:41:57.100]  and then I shoot off
[02:41:57.100 --> 02:41:59.100]  a few emails, so he's like, okay
[02:41:59.100 --> 02:42:01.100]  so, what's that take you, about 15
[02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:03.100]  20 minutes to do that?
[02:42:03.100 --> 02:42:05.100]  He's like, oh, yeah
[02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:07.100]  oh, great, okay, so what's the rest of the day
[02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:09.100]  look like? And of course, this guy is
[02:42:09.100 --> 02:42:11.100]  squirming and then he goes to a guy
[02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:13.100]  next to him, and what about you? What's your
[02:42:13.100 --> 02:42:15.100]  name? He's like, um, Bill
[02:42:15.100 --> 02:42:17.100]  well, what do you do Bill? He's like, well, I'm
[02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:19.100]  John's assistant, and I'm like, and he's like
[02:42:19.100 --> 02:42:21.100]  oh, so John, so you don't even call the
[02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:23.100]  distributors, this guy does
[02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:25.100]  all the work, so what do you guys do all day?
[02:42:25.100 --> 02:42:27.100]  and he just went on and on
[02:42:27.100 --> 02:42:29.100]  people started getting
[02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:31.100]  up out of their chairs and going for the
[02:42:31.100 --> 02:42:33.100]  exits, and he was
[02:42:33.100 --> 02:42:35.100]  bad, hey, where do you think you're going?
[02:42:35.100 --> 02:42:37.100]  and he just
[02:42:37.100 --> 02:42:39.100]  was riding them like a government
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:41.100]  mule, it was just a psych...
[02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:43.100]  Hold on, don't hang up, David, I got to hear the rest
[02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:45.100]  of the story, we'll continue in the next hour, I'm going to get to every one of these
[02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:47.100]  calls that are on hold, I want to hear the rest
[02:42:47.100 --> 02:42:49.100]  about Richard Belzer, yeah, he was a great guy
[02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:51.100]  super smart, we'll be right back
[02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:53.100]  band.video, madmaxworld.tv
[02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:55.100]  madmaxworld.tv
[02:43:17.100 --> 02:43:19.100]  and you slice it, dice it, flip it up
[02:43:19.100 --> 02:43:21.100]  or rub it down, Alex Jones
[02:43:21.100 --> 02:43:23.100]  was right
[02:43:23.100 --> 02:43:25.100]  think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake
[02:43:25.100 --> 02:43:27.100]  for a year or two, imagine being
[02:43:27.100 --> 02:43:29.100]  like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake
[02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:31.100]  for like decades, Alex Jones called
[02:43:31.100 --> 02:43:33.100]  this years ago, years
[02:43:33.100 --> 02:43:35.100]  ago, Alex Jones never bought
[02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:37.100]  the Russia hoax, not for a second
[02:43:37.100 --> 02:43:39.100]  you are one of the great
[02:43:39.100 --> 02:43:41.100]  thinkers of this, you are
[02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:43.100]  a martyr to the first amendment
[02:43:43.100 --> 02:43:45.100]  the government fears
[02:43:45.100 --> 02:43:47.100]  Alex Jones, that's why the globalists
[02:43:47.100 --> 02:43:49.100]  hate me, it's because I'm exposing
[02:43:49.100 --> 02:43:51.100]  their corporate worldwide tyranny
[02:44:15.100 --> 02:44:17.100]  you know, I'm addicted to helping my fellow
[02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:19.100]  Americans, I'm addicted to spreading
[02:44:19.100 --> 02:44:21.100]  the truth, and again, you know, I have Infowars
[02:44:21.100 --> 02:44:23.100]  to thank for that, looking back on the day
[02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:25.100]  I was able to ask President Donald Trump
[02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:27.100]  two questions, I was so
[02:44:27.100 --> 02:44:29.100]  grateful because, you know, I truly was
[02:44:29.100 --> 02:44:31.100]  classically trained under Alex Jones and under
[02:44:31.100 --> 02:44:33.100]  the Infowars team, I really do credit that
[02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:35.100]  as to why I'm able to
[02:44:35.100 --> 02:44:37.100]  you know, get these types of clips
[02:44:37.100 --> 02:44:39.100]  because Alex's whole mentality was
[02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:41.100]  you know, go where the story is
[02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:43.100]  go where the mainstream media refuses
[02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:45.100]  to, so it's not that I'm addicted to
[02:44:45.100 --> 02:44:47.100]  the insanity, I'm just addicted to telling
[02:44:47.100 --> 02:44:49.100]  the truth and helping the American people
[02:44:49.100 --> 02:44:51.100]  and I really do credit Alex for
[02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:53.100]  you know, really instilling that within me early on
[02:44:53.100 --> 02:44:55.100]  in my career
[02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:15.100]  The Great Reset and The War For The World
[02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:17.100]  at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsware.com
[02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:19.100]  but you will never be able to get another
[02:45:19.100 --> 02:45:21.100]  signed copy of the book after
[02:45:21.100 --> 02:45:23.100]  the signed copies we got run out
[02:45:23.100 --> 02:45:25.100]  and there's about a thousand left of them right now
[02:45:25.100 --> 02:45:27.100]  so get your copy of The Great Reset
[02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:29.100]  and The War For The World
[02:45:29.100 --> 02:45:31.100]  a signed copy at Infowarsware.com
[02:45:31.100 --> 02:45:33.100]  and there is a markup there because this is a
[02:45:33.100 --> 02:45:35.100]  fundraiser to keep us on the air
[02:45:35.100 --> 02:45:37.100]  so you won't just have this historic memento
[02:45:37.100 --> 02:45:39.100]  and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:41.100]  you help keep Infowars on the air
[02:45:41.100 --> 02:45:43.100]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:45.100]  or unsigned copies
[02:45:45.100 --> 02:45:47.100]  but I want to encourage all of you who
[02:45:47.100 --> 02:45:49.100]  haven't yet to go to Infowarsware.com
[02:45:49.100 --> 02:45:51.100]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple
[02:45:51.100 --> 02:45:53.100]  of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[02:45:53.100 --> 02:45:55.100]  or give them to the local school
[02:45:55.100 --> 02:45:57.100]  this is an Infowar, I'm counting on you
[02:45:57.100 --> 02:45:59.100]  and thank you for your support
[02:45:59.100 --> 02:46:01.100]  I talk a lot about the great
[02:46:01.100 --> 02:46:03.100]  successes Infowars has had
[02:46:03.100 --> 02:46:05.100]  I don't think anybody can deny it
[02:46:05.100 --> 02:46:07.100]  and it is because of listeners
[02:46:07.100 --> 02:46:09.100]  and viewers supporting us
[02:46:09.100 --> 02:46:11.100]  we talk about the crew at Infowars
[02:46:11.100 --> 02:46:13.100]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers
[02:46:13.100 --> 02:46:15.100]  they really have
[02:46:15.100 --> 02:46:17.100]  been the MVPs in this fight
[02:46:17.100 --> 02:46:19.100]  and when you look at Harrison Smith
[02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:21.100]  and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in
[02:46:21.100 --> 02:46:23.100]  every day, 5, 6, 7 days a week
[02:46:23.100 --> 02:46:25.100]  it's really just incredible
[02:46:25.100 --> 02:46:27.100]  so for myself
[02:46:27.100 --> 02:46:29.100]  and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support
[02:46:29.100 --> 02:46:31.100]  and I want to encourage you now
[02:46:31.100 --> 02:46:33.100]  to realize that Infowars
[02:46:33.100 --> 02:46:35.100]  cannot stay on air if you do not support us
[02:46:35.100 --> 02:46:37.100]  I know you spread the word
[02:46:37.100 --> 02:46:39.100]  I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it
[02:46:39.100 --> 02:46:41.100]  but most viewers and listeners
[02:46:41.100 --> 02:46:43.100]  never go to infowarsstore.com
[02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:45.100]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[02:46:45.100 --> 02:46:47.100]  while at the same time, keep us on air
[02:46:47.100 --> 02:46:49.100]  I know that less than 1%
[02:46:49.100 --> 02:46:51.100]  of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarsstore.com
[02:46:51.100 --> 02:46:53.100]  if just 1% more of you
[02:46:53.100 --> 02:46:55.100]  took action and went to infowarsstore.com
[02:46:55.100 --> 02:46:57.100]  our funding problems will be over
[02:46:57.100 --> 02:46:59.100]  please take action now
[02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:09.100]  please take action now
[02:47:37.100 --> 02:47:39.100]  we fired once more and they began to run it
[02:47:39.100 --> 02:47:41.100]  on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[02:47:41.100 --> 02:47:43.100]  to all the idiot leftists
[02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:45.100]  we looked down a river
[02:47:45.100 --> 02:47:47.100]  that think the US military
[02:47:47.100 --> 02:47:49.100]  could dominate and control the American people
[02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:51.100]  but we didn't want to be
[02:47:51.100 --> 02:47:53.100]  look what happened in Vietnam
[02:47:53.100 --> 02:47:55.100]  we put millions of troops in there
[02:47:55.100 --> 02:47:57.100]  over that 10 year war
[02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:59.100]  about 7 million troops
[02:47:59.100 --> 02:48:01.100]  and the Vietnamese wouldn't give up so they couldn't be beaten
[02:48:01.100 --> 02:48:03.100]  well, you try that with the American people
[02:48:03.100 --> 02:48:05.100]  you're going to fail
[02:48:05.100 --> 02:48:07.100]  you're going to go there
[02:48:07.100 --> 02:48:09.100]  because the feds would just blow up a bunch of buildings
[02:48:09.100 --> 02:48:11.100]  and say we did it
[02:48:11.100 --> 02:48:13.100]  to set the paradigm
[02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:15.100]  that the general public think that the rebels did it
[02:48:15.100 --> 02:48:17.100]  and we'd be off the races
[02:48:17.100 --> 02:48:19.100]  you have to expose their system first
[02:48:19.100 --> 02:48:21.100]  David in Las Vegas, I'm going to rampage quicker through the calls
[02:48:21.100 --> 02:48:23.100]  but you wanted to finish up with your Richard Belzer story
[02:48:23.100 --> 02:48:25.100]  oh, just that he was a terrific guy
[02:48:25.100 --> 02:48:27.100]  and really
[02:48:27.100 --> 02:48:29.100]  that's a classic liberal
[02:48:29.100 --> 02:48:31.100]  and the power of comedy
[02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:33.100]  it's what we've got as our gift
[02:48:33.100 --> 02:48:35.100]  to get to break through all the nonsense
[02:48:35.100 --> 02:48:37.100]  I agree
[02:48:37.100 --> 02:48:39.100]  and I need to do it more
[02:48:39.100 --> 02:48:41.100]  we need more classical liberals
[02:48:41.100 --> 02:48:43.100]  not all these, what you call them today, fascists
[02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:45.100]  yeah, and you know
[02:48:45.100 --> 02:48:47.100]  I just wanted to also speak to Harrison
[02:48:47.100 --> 02:48:49.100]  Smith at
[02:48:49.100 --> 02:48:51.100]  just what a unique talent
[02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:53.100]  that that man has
[02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:55.100]  to keep things somehow light hearted
[02:48:55.100 --> 02:48:57.100]  while really hammering home
[02:48:57.100 --> 02:48:59.100]  really important points
[02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:01.100]  and he's just terrific
[02:49:01.100 --> 02:49:03.100]  and also Owen
[02:49:03.100 --> 02:49:05.100]  and yourself of course
[02:49:05.100 --> 02:49:07.100]  and just the previous caller who had spoken
[02:49:07.100 --> 02:49:09.100]  about Blair Wyatt
[02:49:09.100 --> 02:49:11.100]  I think it really speaks to your integrity
[02:49:11.100 --> 02:49:13.100]  that you have a relationship with somebody
[02:49:13.100 --> 02:49:15.100]  like that and with Gays for Groomers
[02:49:15.100 --> 02:49:17.100]  to see Owen Schroyer
[02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:19.100]  who we all know how he feels
[02:49:19.100 --> 02:49:21.100]  about things, he's not shy
[02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:23.100]  and he has a reasonable
[02:49:23.100 --> 02:49:25.100]  intelligent conversation
[02:49:25.100 --> 02:49:27.100]  with the woman from Gays Against Groomer
[02:49:27.100 --> 02:49:29.100]  by the way, I want that lady
[02:49:29.100 --> 02:49:31.100]  I want that lady on my show too
[02:49:31.100 --> 02:49:33.100]  I appreciate your call, thank you sir
[02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:35.100]  we gotta move quicker, great call
[02:49:35.100 --> 02:49:37.100]  let me mention this about real liberals
[02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:39.100]  I don't agree with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on some topics
[02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:41.100]  but he's a man of integrity
[02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:43.100]  that fights fluoride and poison shots
[02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:45.100]  and fentanyl and everything else
[02:49:45.100 --> 02:49:47.100]  he's a good man, his father was a good man
[02:49:47.100 --> 02:49:49.100]  he was assassinated
[02:49:49.100 --> 02:49:51.100]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has officially announced he's running for president
[02:49:51.100 --> 02:49:53.100]  he didn't just file two days ago
[02:49:53.100 --> 02:49:55.100]  he came out yesterday and said I am running against Joe Biden
[02:49:55.100 --> 02:49:57.100]  that's a good thing
[02:49:57.100 --> 02:49:59.100]  he killed his daddy when he was winning the primaries
[02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:01.100]  he's got a lot of guts
[02:50:01.100 --> 02:50:03.100]  and I really support him
[02:50:03.100 --> 02:50:05.100]  for the Democratic nomination
[02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:07.100]  and if he backed off gun control, which he didn't really talk about
[02:50:07.100 --> 02:50:09.100]  and became more pro-life
[02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:11.100]  which he's starting to do
[02:50:11.100 --> 02:50:13.100]  I would support him over most RINO Republicans
[02:50:13.100 --> 02:50:15.100]  so I would actually vote Democrat
[02:50:15.100 --> 02:50:17.100]  I mean I would vote for Trump over him
[02:50:17.100 --> 02:50:19.100]  or DeSantis
[02:50:19.100 --> 02:50:21.100]  but if he won the presidency
[02:50:21.100 --> 02:50:23.100]  that's a classy guy
[02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:25.100]  who is a good man
[02:50:25.100 --> 02:50:27.100]  he's talking about people
[02:50:27.100 --> 02:50:29.100]  and who is against the establishment
[02:50:29.100 --> 02:50:31.100]  he's a good man
[02:50:31.100 --> 02:50:33.100]  and that's why the whole media is attacking him right now
[02:50:33.100 --> 02:50:35.100]  and Tulsi Gabbards
[02:50:35.100 --> 02:50:37.100]  I think he's the one with Tulsi Gabbards
[02:50:37.100 --> 02:50:39.100]  but he's a Republican now basically
[02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:41.100]  Angel in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead
[02:50:41.100 --> 02:50:43.100]  Hey Alex
[02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:45.100]  Welcome
[02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:47.100]  Thank you, thank you
[02:50:47.100 --> 02:50:49.100]  Great to speak to you again
[02:50:49.100 --> 02:50:51.100]  I guess the first time I saw you was at the second stop to steal
[02:50:51.100 --> 02:50:53.100]  where you were like, what do we want?
[02:50:53.100 --> 02:50:55.100]  Yeah, you reached over it
[02:50:55.100 --> 02:50:57.100]  and you gave me a high five
[02:50:57.100 --> 02:50:59.100]  that was great
[02:50:59.100 --> 02:51:01.100]  I'm like, wow
[02:51:01.100 --> 02:51:03.100]  And again, we went to the Georgia Capitol
[02:51:03.100 --> 02:51:05.100]  and went in, we're peaceful
[02:51:05.100 --> 02:51:07.100]  went to all those other capitals that were peaceful
[02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:09.100]  and we did not go to the US Capitol to be violent
[02:51:09.100 --> 02:51:11.100]  No, we didn't
[02:51:11.100 --> 02:51:13.100]  we were there
[02:51:13.100 --> 02:51:15.100]  for big things
[02:51:15.100 --> 02:51:17.100]  and everything
[02:51:17.100 --> 02:51:19.100]  and what I wanted to tell that last caller
[02:51:19.100 --> 02:51:21.100]  that was like, oh we need to be violent
[02:51:21.100 --> 02:51:23.100]  okay
[02:51:23.100 --> 02:51:25.100]  Ray Epps
[02:51:25.100 --> 02:51:27.100]  Yeah, the military is on our enemy
[02:51:27.100 --> 02:51:29.100]  they're the ones being hit with poisoned shots
[02:51:29.100 --> 02:51:31.100]  we need to win the info war
[02:51:31.100 --> 02:51:33.100]  Absolutely
[02:51:33.100 --> 02:51:35.100]  and we're winning and we're winning big
[02:51:35.100 --> 02:51:37.100]  and we just don't see it
[02:51:37.100 --> 02:51:39.100]  because a lot of people are focused on the negative
[02:51:39.100 --> 02:51:41.100]  what is always available
[02:51:41.100 --> 02:51:43.100]  is the right thing
[02:51:43.100 --> 02:51:45.100]  and the positive
[02:51:45.100 --> 02:51:47.100]  we're winning the hearts and minds
[02:51:47.100 --> 02:51:49.100]  of the people
[02:51:49.100 --> 02:51:51.100]  and we're not flipping it against them
[02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:53.100]  so if they actually do try to carry out
[02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:55.100]  the final plan or whatever
[02:51:55.100 --> 02:51:57.100]  they have in store for us
[02:51:57.100 --> 02:51:59.100]  who's to say that their own people are going to flip
[02:51:59.100 --> 02:52:01.100]  on them and
[02:52:01.100 --> 02:52:03.100]  it's going to end up like the beginning scenes
[02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:05.100]  of The Dark Knight
[02:52:05.100 --> 02:52:07.100]  where the Joker pretty much kills everyone else
[02:52:07.100 --> 02:52:09.100]  It's a total set up
[02:52:09.100 --> 02:52:11.100]  the idiots going along with their fools
[02:52:11.100 --> 02:52:13.100]  we need to reach out to those
[02:52:13.100 --> 02:52:15.100]  not the evil ones, they know what they're doing
[02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:17.100]  but the most of them are minions
[02:52:17.100 --> 02:52:19.100]  thank you Angel
[02:52:19.100 --> 02:52:21.100]  Buttons in Maine
[02:52:21.100 --> 02:52:23.100]  you're on the air, thanks for holding
[02:52:23.100 --> 02:52:25.100]  Hi Alex
[02:52:25.100 --> 02:52:27.100]  thank you for taking my call
[02:52:27.100 --> 02:52:29.100]  I love you and I want to let you know
[02:52:29.100 --> 02:52:31.100]  that your products are great
[02:52:31.100 --> 02:52:33.100]  I really love the Brainforce
[02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:35.100]  my man loves the CBD oil
[02:52:35.100 --> 02:52:37.100]  but I'm calling because
[02:52:37.100 --> 02:52:39.100]  I wanted to speak about
[02:52:39.100 --> 02:52:41.100]  the Proud Boys
[02:52:41.100 --> 02:52:43.100]  my man's a Proud Boy
[02:52:43.100 --> 02:52:45.100]  and it's a really great fraternity
[02:52:45.100 --> 02:52:47.100]  they've had a really positive impact
[02:52:47.100 --> 02:52:49.100]  on our lives
[02:52:49.100 --> 02:52:51.100]  and I know that they're demonized as like a street
[02:52:51.100 --> 02:52:53.100]  gay
[02:52:53.100 --> 02:52:55.100]  no, they never started fights, they defend when they attack men, women and children
[02:52:55.100 --> 02:52:57.100]  they're a great organization set up by the feds
[02:52:59.100 --> 02:53:01.100]  I mean, there's gay men, black men
[02:53:01.100 --> 02:53:03.100]  hispanic men, there's men from every
[02:53:03.100 --> 02:53:05.100]  walk of life in the Proud Boys
[02:53:05.100 --> 02:53:07.100]  and that's why it scared the system
[02:53:07.100 --> 02:53:09.100]  yeah, and they support each other
[02:53:09.100 --> 02:53:11.100]  to help make each other the best
[02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:13.100]  men that they can be
[02:53:13.100 --> 02:53:15.100]  especially with the nuclear family
[02:53:15.100 --> 02:53:17.100]  especially the South Carolina boys
[02:53:17.100 --> 02:53:19.100]  have been aggressively protesting
[02:53:19.100 --> 02:53:21.100]  the groomer clowns down there
[02:53:23.100 --> 02:53:25.100]  I think Gavin McGinnis
[02:53:25.100 --> 02:53:27.100]  is a wonderful person, I think the Proud Boys
[02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:29.100]  are a wonderful group
[02:53:29.100 --> 02:53:31.100]  and they got set up on January 6th
[02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:33.100]  a very small group of them
[02:53:33.100 --> 02:53:35.100]  and they're all innocent
[02:53:35.100 --> 02:53:37.100]  absolutely, absolutely
[02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:39.100]  and we haven't forgotten about our political prisoners
[02:53:39.100 --> 02:53:41.100]  not just the Proud Boys, but all of them
[02:53:41.100 --> 02:53:43.100]  I agree with you, and they're scared of
[02:53:43.100 --> 02:53:45.100]  a fraternity of men that are of every group
[02:53:45.100 --> 02:53:47.100]  one group, men, standing up for just
[02:53:47.100 --> 02:53:49.100]  being good, decent people
[02:53:49.100 --> 02:53:51.100]  and they're very inclusive, that's why they scared the left so much
[02:53:51.100 --> 02:53:53.100]  why they've been persecuted
[02:53:53.100 --> 02:53:55.100]  absolutely, and just like every group
[02:53:55.100 --> 02:53:57.100]  I mean, the majority of them
[02:53:57.100 --> 02:53:59.100]  it's a drinking club, they tell burp and fart jokes
[02:53:59.100 --> 02:54:01.100]  they get together one month and have a few beers
[02:54:03.100 --> 02:54:05.100]  absolutely, thank you for the call
[02:54:05.100 --> 02:54:07.100]  it's like when Marjorie Taylor Greene was going to go give a peaceful speech
[02:54:07.100 --> 02:54:09.100]  and they had physically attacked her
[02:54:09.100 --> 02:54:11.100]  Mayor said she was basically a criminal terrorist
[02:54:11.100 --> 02:54:13.100]  I mean, they don't want us to have our speech
[02:54:13.100 --> 02:54:15.100]  okay folks, because we're beating them
[02:54:15.100 --> 02:54:17.100]  Joe in Ohio, thanks for calling
[02:54:17.100 --> 02:54:19.100]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:21.100]  Good, thanks for holding
[02:54:21.100 --> 02:54:23.100]  Hey, I just have two little dirty words
[02:54:23.100 --> 02:54:25.100]  for the left, and I don't
[02:54:25.100 --> 02:54:27.100]  hear this being talked about very often
[02:54:27.100 --> 02:54:29.100]  but constitutional convention
[02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:31.100]  that is the most peaceful way
[02:54:31.100 --> 02:54:33.100]  that we could
[02:54:33.100 --> 02:54:35.100]  raise our hands to the government
[02:54:35.100 --> 02:54:37.100]  and say, look, we need to change this
[02:54:37.100 --> 02:54:39.100]  stuff, they have layered so
[02:54:39.100 --> 02:54:41.100]  many laws over the constitution
[02:54:41.100 --> 02:54:43.100]  it's not even effective anymore
[02:54:43.100 --> 02:54:45.100]  but what other peaceful means
[02:54:45.100 --> 02:54:47.100]  do we have?
[02:54:47.100 --> 02:54:49.100]  Well, constitutional conventions are very dangerous
[02:54:49.100 --> 02:54:51.100]  but they're in the constitution for a reason
[02:54:51.100 --> 02:54:53.100]  so the right states did it and had the right
[02:54:53.100 --> 02:54:55.100]  amendments, that would be
[02:54:55.100 --> 02:54:57.100]  something that could be good
[02:54:57.100 --> 02:54:59.100]  but the enemy could hijack a con con
[02:54:59.100 --> 02:55:01.100]  and do a lot of dangerous stuff, but I hear you
[02:55:01.100 --> 02:55:03.100]  it's in the constitution for a reason
[02:55:03.100 --> 02:55:05.100]  because it's an option, what do you think
[02:55:05.100 --> 02:55:07.100]  it should be?
[02:55:07.100 --> 02:55:09.100]  Oh, too many
[02:55:09.100 --> 02:55:11.100]  Abolish the federal reserve? Congress could do that anyways
[02:55:11.100 --> 02:55:13.100]  Yep, start our own currency
[02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:15.100]  term limits
[02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:17.100]  cap on the budget
[02:55:17.100 --> 02:55:19.100]  no foreign
[02:55:19.100 --> 02:55:21.100]  involvement in wars
[02:55:21.100 --> 02:55:23.100]  there's just so many
[02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:25.100]  you know, we've come so far from what the
[02:55:25.100 --> 02:55:27.100]  founding fathers actually intended
[02:55:27.100 --> 02:55:29.100]  for us
[02:55:29.100 --> 02:55:31.100]  I think it's something that should be discussed
[02:55:31.100 --> 02:55:33.100]  the problem is, we already have the
[02:55:33.100 --> 02:55:35.100]  constitution
[02:55:35.100 --> 02:55:37.100]  that the president can't launch wars without congress
[02:55:37.100 --> 02:55:39.100]  but it's still happening, I think we should enforce
[02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:41.100]  the constitution, how do we do that?
[02:55:41.100 --> 02:55:43.100]  Wow
[02:55:43.100 --> 02:55:45.100]  to do it non-violently, we see what they
[02:55:45.100 --> 02:55:47.100]  did with January 6th
[02:55:47.100 --> 02:55:49.100]  if you're even carrying a cell phone, you're going to get
[02:55:49.100 --> 02:55:51.100]  tagged as some kind of instigator
[02:55:51.100 --> 02:55:53.100]  this is
[02:55:53.100 --> 02:55:55.100]  why I was thinking the convention
[02:55:55.100 --> 02:55:57.100]  if we could stop them in their tracks
[02:55:57.100 --> 02:55:59.100]  I mean
[02:55:59.100 --> 02:56:01.100]  I almost wish we could impeach
[02:56:01.100 --> 02:56:03.100]  under a convention
[02:56:03.100 --> 02:56:05.100]  because it would seem we need to
[02:56:05.100 --> 02:56:07.100]  do that and our representatives
[02:56:07.100 --> 02:56:09.100]  are not fairly representing us
[02:56:09.100 --> 02:56:11.100]  everybody blames the democrats
[02:56:11.100 --> 02:56:13.100]  but if you look at the republicans
[02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:15.100]  they allow these things to go through
[02:56:15.100 --> 02:56:17.100]  they're part of the problem
[02:56:17.100 --> 02:56:19.100]  Now I hear you, Joe, we should have a whole debate
[02:56:19.100 --> 02:56:21.100]  a whole show with different guests
[02:56:21.100 --> 02:56:23.100]  from different angles about a constitutional convention
[02:56:23.100 --> 02:56:25.100]  of course there's two ways to do it
[02:56:25.100 --> 02:56:27.100]  and then we could do it, the states or two thirds
[02:56:27.100 --> 02:56:29.100]  of congress, thank you for the call
[02:56:29.100 --> 02:56:31.100]  a little break, talk to Kristin and a few other callers
[02:56:31.100 --> 02:56:33.100]  and then one of my favorite guest hosts
[02:56:33.100 --> 02:56:35.100]  definitely the fieriest
[02:56:35.100 --> 02:56:37.100]  and most entertaining, Drew Hernandez
[02:56:37.100 --> 02:56:39.100]  will take over in the fourth hour

[02:56:59.100 --> 02:57:01.100]  same thing, selling out

[02:57:23.100 --> 02:57:25.100]  Alex Jones for President at 2024 on the front
[02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:27.100]  M4W4.com on the back and the Trump
[02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:29.100]  mugshot political prisoner
[02:57:29.100 --> 02:57:31.100]  t-shirt, both limited editions

[02:57:49.100 --> 02:57:51.100]  If Alex Jones runs for President
[02:57:51.100 --> 02:57:53.100]  in the Republican Party
[02:57:53.100 --> 02:57:55.100]  he has a chance of winning
[02:58:23.100 --> 02:58:25.100]  and when the shirts are gone
[02:58:25.100 --> 02:58:27.100]  they're gone, we're doing one run
[02:58:27.100 --> 02:58:29.100]  of Alex Jones for President
[02:58:29.100 --> 02:58:31.100]  2024 shirts
[02:58:31.100 --> 02:58:33.100]  and we'll have a historic memento
[02:58:33.100 --> 02:58:35.100]  be able to spread the word, meet a lot of
[02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:37.100]  people and you'll be able to keep us
[02:58:37.100 --> 02:58:39.100]  on the air
[02:58:39.100 --> 02:58:41.100]  no way, that's a bridge too far
[02:58:41.100 --> 02:58:43.100]  no, it can't be
[02:58:43.100 --> 02:58:45.100]  and I said on national television that he was gonna win
[02:58:45.100 --> 02:58:47.100]  at Infowarsstore.com
[02:58:49.100 --> 02:58:51.100]  I intend to take
[02:58:51.100 --> 02:58:53.100]  the Infowars
[02:58:53.100 --> 02:58:55.100]  armored truck out
[02:58:55.100 --> 02:58:57.100]  or the Infowars tank as it's so lovingly called
[02:58:57.100 --> 02:58:59.100]  you came through yesterday and
[02:58:59.100 --> 02:59:01.100]  shopped at Infowarsstore.com so I'm gonna be able to
[02:59:01.100 --> 02:59:03.100]  take the truck out
[02:59:21.100 --> 02:59:23.100]  so
[02:59:51.100 --> 02:59:53.100]  if you are receiving this transmission
[02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:55.100]  you are the resistance
[03:00:07.100 --> 03:00:09.100]  you know I have a rule when folks call in from foreign countries
[03:00:09.100 --> 03:00:11.100]  I tried to go to them earlier
[03:00:11.100 --> 03:00:13.100]  but I have a bad habit of just
[03:00:13.100 --> 03:00:15.100]  looking at how long they've been on hold and going to the next caller
[03:00:15.100 --> 03:00:17.100]  in the order they're received
[03:00:17.100 --> 03:00:19.100]  but Chris has been holding over an hour from England
[03:00:19.100 --> 03:00:21.100]  I appreciate Chris holding
[03:00:21.100 --> 03:00:23.100]  you wanna talk about the people versus the new world order
[03:00:23.100 --> 03:00:25.100]  go ahead and thanks for holding
[03:00:25.100 --> 03:00:27.100]  Hi Alex, it's Chris in
[03:00:27.100 --> 03:00:29.100]  Bolton in England
[03:00:29.100 --> 03:00:31.100]  welcome
[03:00:31.100 --> 03:00:33.100]  and I have information about helping
[03:00:33.100 --> 03:00:35.100]  take down the new world order
[03:00:35.100 --> 03:00:37.100]  tell me
[03:00:37.100 --> 03:00:39.100]  all governance
[03:00:39.100 --> 03:00:41.100]  in our country
[03:00:41.100 --> 03:00:43.100]  is based on governance by
[03:00:43.100 --> 03:00:45.100]  consent
[03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:47.100]  well there was a guy in Britain in England
[03:00:47.100 --> 03:00:49.100]  in 2013 proved
[03:00:49.100 --> 03:00:51.100]  in case law that they
[03:00:51.100 --> 03:00:53.100]  don't actually have our consent
[03:00:53.100 --> 03:00:55.100]  see a statute is a
[03:00:55.100 --> 03:00:57.100]  legislative rule given force of
[03:00:57.100 --> 03:00:59.100]  law by the consent
[03:00:59.100 --> 03:01:01.100]  of the governed without the
[03:01:01.100 --> 03:01:03.100]  consent of the governed that rule does
[03:01:03.100 --> 03:01:05.100]  not apply and he
[03:01:05.100 --> 03:01:07.100]  won a tribunal
[03:01:07.100 --> 03:01:09.100]  and they got
[03:01:09.100 --> 03:01:11.100]  and he won on those terms
[03:01:11.100 --> 03:01:13.100]  on those, that fact
[03:01:13.100 --> 03:01:15.100]  and what was that case?
[03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:17.100]  the carpet out of all of it
[03:01:17.100 --> 03:01:19.100]  what was that case?
[03:01:19.100 --> 03:01:21.100]  his name is
[03:01:21.100 --> 03:01:23.100]  Baron David Ward
[03:01:23.100 --> 03:01:25.100]  and he wrote something called the
[03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:27.100]  Baron David Ward affidavit
[03:01:27.100 --> 03:01:29.100]  when he won the case
[03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:31.100]  he then, two years later
[03:01:31.100 --> 03:01:33.100]  it took him two years to write this affidavit
[03:01:33.100 --> 03:01:35.100]  because if you get the facts in an affidavit wrong
[03:01:35.100 --> 03:01:37.100]  you go to prison for a very long time
[03:01:37.100 --> 03:01:39.100]  he then sent that affidavit
[03:01:39.100 --> 03:01:41.100]  off to 657
[03:01:41.100 --> 03:01:43.100]  members of parliament
[03:01:43.100 --> 03:01:45.100]  with the invite
[03:01:45.100 --> 03:01:47.100]  to rebut, none of them
[03:01:47.100 --> 03:01:49.100]  did, no rebuttal
[03:01:49.100 --> 03:01:51.100]  657 times, half of parliament
[03:01:51.100 --> 03:01:53.100]  are lawyers and the other half
[03:01:53.100 --> 03:01:55.100]  have had that
[03:01:55.100 --> 03:01:57.100]  well there's no doubt these governments don't have the consent of the governed
[03:01:57.100 --> 03:01:59.100]  and have hijacked things, so where are you going with this?
[03:01:59.100 --> 03:02:01.100]  well this is actually case
[03:02:01.100 --> 03:02:03.100]  law, it's court stamped and signed
[03:02:03.100 --> 03:02:05.100]  therefore they've agreed to it
[03:02:05.100 --> 03:02:07.100]  their own system, so it's a weapon
[03:02:07.100 --> 03:02:09.100]  that you can use against them
[03:02:09.100 --> 03:02:11.100]  by sending off this case law
[03:02:11.100 --> 03:02:13.100]  to Baron David
[03:02:13.100 --> 03:02:15.100]  to destroy any and all statutes
[03:02:15.100 --> 03:02:17.100]  because a statute is a legislative rule
[03:02:17.100 --> 03:02:19.100]  even a year ago
[03:02:19.100 --> 03:02:21.100]  the supreme court ruled
[03:02:21.100 --> 03:02:23.100]  that these agencies like the EPA
[03:02:23.100 --> 03:02:25.100]  shutting down coal power plants
[03:02:25.100 --> 03:02:27.100]  don't have law, it's the same thing
[03:02:27.100 --> 03:02:29.100]  so what's the name of the case again?
[03:02:29.100 --> 03:02:31.100]  the Baron David Ward
[03:02:31.100 --> 03:02:33.100]  affidavit
[03:02:33.100 --> 03:02:35.100]  the Baron David Ward affidavit
[03:02:35.100 --> 03:02:37.100]  I'll check into it
[03:02:37.100 --> 03:02:39.100]  thank you, ok let's go to
[03:02:39.100 --> 03:02:41.100]  John in Chicago, you're on the air
[03:02:41.100 --> 03:02:43.100]  hey Alex, how are you doing?
[03:02:43.100 --> 03:02:45.100]  good brother
[03:02:45.100 --> 03:02:47.100]  alright, so one thing I've been thinking about
[03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:49.100]  a long time and I've been listening to you since
[03:02:49.100 --> 03:02:51.100]  9-11 is they're linguistic
[03:02:51.100 --> 03:02:53.100]  geniuses, they trick us
[03:02:53.100 --> 03:02:55.100]  even trick you and I
[03:02:55.100 --> 03:02:57.100]  we call it the great reset
[03:02:57.100 --> 03:02:59.100]  it's not a great reset, it's a great calling
[03:02:59.100 --> 03:03:01.100]  and I think if we start calling it that
[03:03:01.100 --> 03:03:03.100]  maybe more people can wake up to see what it is
[03:03:03.100 --> 03:03:05.100]  that they're after to do
[03:03:05.100 --> 03:03:07.100]  what are your thoughts my friend?
[03:03:07.100 --> 03:03:09.100]  it's the great collapse, the great depopulation
[03:03:09.100 --> 03:03:11.100]  the great calling
[03:03:11.100 --> 03:03:13.100]  call it that
[03:03:13.100 --> 03:03:15.100]  I've actually called that a lot
[03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:17.100]  many years ago
[03:03:17.100 --> 03:03:19.100]  that's what Dr. Reema Lebo calls it
[03:03:19.100 --> 03:03:21.100]  that's where I learned it my friend
[03:03:21.100 --> 03:03:23.100]  listening to you
[03:03:23.100 --> 03:03:25.100]  hey I said that first, you're right, that's the term to use
[03:03:25.100 --> 03:03:27.100]  is this is the great calling right now
[03:03:27.100 --> 03:03:29.100]  it's the great calling
[03:03:29.100 --> 03:03:31.100]  it's just started, slowly
[03:03:31.100 --> 03:03:33.100]  but it's the great calling, it's upon us
[03:03:33.100 --> 03:03:35.100]  they're setting the precedent to release weapons
[03:03:35.100 --> 03:03:37.100]  release shots that kill us
[03:03:37.100 --> 03:03:39.100]  and just normalize it, now Fauci says
[03:03:39.100 --> 03:03:41.100]  a new bio-weapon's coming next year
[03:03:41.100 --> 03:03:43.100]  yeah, they've already started killing us
[03:03:43.100 --> 03:03:45.100]  the great calling is here
[03:03:45.100 --> 03:03:47.100]  we're living it
[03:03:47.100 --> 03:03:49.100]  and it's all a test to see what we'll put up with
[03:03:49.100 --> 03:03:51.100]  yeah, and unfortunately
[03:03:51.100 --> 03:03:53.100]  we just keep taking it
[03:03:53.100 --> 03:03:55.100]  well, I agree
[03:03:55.100 --> 03:03:57.100]  I wish people would have woken up more of it
[03:03:57.100 --> 03:03:59.100]  it's woken a lot of people up though
[03:03:59.100 --> 03:04:01.100]  oh, tons of people, the people all around me
[03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:03.100]  people are walking up to me at work and talking to me
[03:04:03.100 --> 03:04:05.100]  you know, they're like, how'd you know all that stuff
[03:04:05.100 --> 03:04:07.100]  and they tell them, listen to Alex
[03:04:07.100 --> 03:04:09.100]  and so we got to call Microsoft, we got to call Bill Gates
[03:04:09.100 --> 03:04:11.100]  we got to call Congress, we got to let them all know
[03:04:11.100 --> 03:04:13.100]  we know you did it, do it again
[03:04:13.100 --> 03:04:15.100]  you know, we're going to bring you
[03:04:15.100 --> 03:04:17.100]  they're already talking about criminal charges in Congress
[03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:19.100]  against Fauci, so as negative as it is
[03:04:19.100 --> 03:04:21.100]  a lot of positive things, great call, thank you Sean
[03:04:21.100 --> 03:04:23.100]  now look, I'm going to take calls again tomorrow on Friday
[03:04:23.100 --> 03:04:25.100]  but don't, but the folks there
[03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:27.100]  it's the phones, remind me tomorrow
[03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:29.100]  they'll give us their name and number
[03:04:29.100 --> 03:04:31.100]  Gold, Harold, and Josh
[03:04:31.100 --> 03:04:33.100]  Josh, we took like 20 calls
[03:04:33.100 --> 03:04:35.100]  I don't have time to get to you because I don't want to cut into Drew Hernandez
[03:04:35.100 --> 03:04:37.100]  those two syndicated shows today
[03:04:37.100 --> 03:04:39.100]  it's gracious to come once a week
[03:04:39.100 --> 03:04:41.100]  and do an hour here with us
[03:04:41.100 --> 03:04:43.100]  so Drew Hernandez is loaded for bear
[03:04:43.100 --> 03:04:45.100]  I'm going to go eat my lunch, take care of paperwork
[03:04:45.100 --> 03:04:47.100]  work on a bunch of stuff while I listen to Drew Hernandez
[03:04:47.100 --> 03:04:49.100]  in the next hour, and then
[03:04:49.100 --> 03:04:51.100]  in one hour, Owen Schroyer

[03:04:55.100 --> 03:04:57.100]  right now
[03:04:57.100 --> 03:04:59.100]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners
[03:04:59.100 --> 03:05:01.100]  that have gone to mfullwars.com
[03:05:01.100 --> 03:05:03.100]  and gotten the great products

[03:05:11.100 --> 03:05:13.100]  that have tuned in, many of you for years
[03:05:13.100 --> 03:05:15.100]  and never gone to mfullwars.com
[03:05:15.100 --> 03:05:17.100]  we know the vast, vast, vast
[03:05:17.100 --> 03:05:19.100]  vast majority of you
[03:05:19.100 --> 03:05:21.100]  never actually go to mfullwars.com
[03:05:21.100 --> 03:05:23.100]  and never go to mfullwars.com
[03:05:23.100 --> 03:05:25.100]  never actually go to mfullwars.com
[03:05:25.100 --> 03:05:27.100]  and never experience these great products
[03:05:27.100 --> 03:05:29.100]  and never find the operation
[03:05:29.100 --> 03:05:31.100]  sure you share a link, you share an article
[03:05:31.100 --> 03:05:33.100]  you tell folks about the show, that's great and I thank you
[03:05:33.100 --> 03:05:35.100]  but we need funds to operate
[03:05:35.100 --> 03:05:37.100]  plus we've got really great products that do amazing things
[03:05:37.100 --> 03:05:39.100]  for people like our CBD oil
[03:05:39.100 --> 03:05:41.100]  and our fizzy magnesium

[03:05:43.100 --> 03:05:45.100]  and our real red pill plus
[03:05:45.100 --> 03:05:47.100]  all of these are really great products

[03:06:25.100 --> 03:06:27.100]  hey I'm just going to give a disclaimer right now
[03:06:27.100 --> 03:06:29.100]  all CUCservatives
[03:06:29.100 --> 03:06:31.100]  and CUCNN lovers
[03:06:31.100 --> 03:06:33.100]  and anyone that just
[03:06:33.100 --> 03:06:35.100]  cannot hear a difference of an opinion
[03:06:35.100 --> 03:06:37.100]  or something that's a little too in your face
[03:06:37.100 --> 03:06:39.100]  or a little too aggressive
[03:06:39.100 --> 03:06:41.100]  politically or ideologically
[03:06:41.100 --> 03:06:43.100]  listen, just go to your safe space right now
[03:06:43.100 --> 03:06:45.100]  I'm just going to be completely honest with you right now
[03:06:45.100 --> 03:06:47.100]  I'm not going to sit here and try and
[03:06:47.100 --> 03:06:49.100]  baby you and coddle you
[03:06:49.100 --> 03:06:51.100]  and make sure you feel okay
[03:06:51.100 --> 03:06:53.100]  and your feelings aren't hurt
[03:06:53.100 --> 03:06:55.100]  and you're mentally stable and your mental illness
[03:06:55.100 --> 03:06:57.100]  isn't going off the charts
[03:06:57.100 --> 03:06:59.100]  no no no no
[03:06:59.100 --> 03:07:01.100]  there's no time for that
[03:07:01.100 --> 03:07:03.100]  that type of mentality and behaviour
[03:07:03.100 --> 03:07:05.100]  with all the cuckery going on
[03:07:05.100 --> 03:07:07.100]  and the political correctness
[03:07:07.100 --> 03:07:09.100]  and people bending the knee to the woke mob
[03:07:09.100 --> 03:07:11.100]  and the totalitarian New World Order
[03:07:11.100 --> 03:07:13.100]  regimes on both sides in the
[03:07:13.100 --> 03:07:15.100]  uni-party, do not be deceived
[03:07:15.100 --> 03:07:17.100]  the two party system is absolutely
[03:07:17.100 --> 03:07:19.100]  against you and your family
[03:07:19.100 --> 03:07:21.100]  you can identify very quickly
[03:07:21.100 --> 03:07:23.100]  who's truly America first
[03:07:23.100 --> 03:07:25.100]  pro-humanity, pro-Christ, pro-God
[03:07:25.100 --> 03:07:27.100]  that believes in the traditional values
[03:07:27.100 --> 03:07:29.100]  that got humanity to this point
[03:07:29.100 --> 03:07:31.100]  here in the future in 2023
[03:07:31.100 --> 03:07:33.100]  which by the way, when you take a look at the
[03:07:33.100 --> 03:07:35.100]  radical New World Order agenda
[03:07:35.100 --> 03:07:37.100]  whether it's coming from the left, whether it's coming from the right
[03:07:37.100 --> 03:07:39.100]  it is all anti-Christ
[03:07:39.100 --> 03:07:41.100]  demonic, satanic
[03:07:41.100 --> 03:07:43.100]  in origin and it's always an attack
[03:07:43.100 --> 03:07:45.100]  on God himself
[03:07:45.100 --> 03:07:47.100]  and those that are made in the image of God
[03:07:47.100 --> 03:07:49.100]  which is us, humanity
[03:07:49.100 --> 03:07:51.100]  and when you speak about the transgender movement
[03:07:51.100 --> 03:07:53.100]  let me just make a
[03:07:53.100 --> 03:07:55.100]  pretty obvious
[03:07:55.100 --> 03:07:57.100]  point to the viewers right now
[03:07:57.100 --> 03:07:59.100]  is that trans people
[03:07:59.100 --> 03:08:01.100]  just don't exist
[03:08:01.100 --> 03:08:03.100]  you know, this is my view
[03:08:03.100 --> 03:08:05.100]  because, you know, if trans people
[03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:07.100]  have gender dysphoria
[03:08:07.100 --> 03:08:09.100]  and it's a mental illness
[03:08:09.100 --> 03:08:11.100]  let me just put it out there
[03:08:11.100 --> 03:08:13.100]  it's just a figment in their imagination
[03:08:13.100 --> 03:08:15.100]  it's an alternate reality that these people
[03:08:15.100 --> 03:08:17.100]  find themselves living in
[03:08:17.100 --> 03:08:19.100]  and at the end of the day, they're just homosexuals
[03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:21.100]  or lesbians
[03:08:21.100 --> 03:08:23.100]  which is against God as well
[03:08:23.100 --> 03:08:25.100]  but you take a look at these
[03:08:25.100 --> 03:08:27.100]  woke tards like Dylan Mulvaney
[03:08:27.100 --> 03:08:29.100]  alright, you got, listen, the New World Order
[03:08:29.100 --> 03:08:31.100]  compartmentalizes, there's ranks
[03:08:31.100 --> 03:08:33.100]  there's systems
[03:08:33.100 --> 03:08:35.100]  you take a look at how the military is set up
[03:08:35.100 --> 03:08:37.100]  it's the same way with the New World Order
[03:08:37.100 --> 03:08:39.100]  you got Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates at the top
[03:08:39.100 --> 03:08:41.100]  you got these people
[03:08:41.100 --> 03:08:43.100]  that are the big, you know, the Rockefellers
[03:08:43.100 --> 03:08:45.100]  you got these individuals that have been
[03:08:45.100 --> 03:08:47.100]  making moves, the Bilderbergs
[03:08:47.100 --> 03:08:49.100]  these people that Alex Jones has been
[03:08:49.100 --> 03:08:51.100]  exposing for decades now
[03:08:51.100 --> 03:08:53.100]  the big players
[03:08:53.100 --> 03:08:55.100]  the George Soroses of the world
[03:08:55.100 --> 03:08:57.100]  with billion dollar budgets
[03:08:57.100 --> 03:08:59.100]  to place in other little agents
[03:08:59.100 --> 03:09:01.100]  of Satan, crooked DAs
[03:09:01.100 --> 03:09:03.100]  crooked politicians
[03:09:03.100 --> 03:09:05.100]  that we're seeing fully functional and operational
[03:09:05.100 --> 03:09:07.100]  right now, especially in New York
[03:09:07.100 --> 03:09:09.100]  a George Soros
[03:09:09.100 --> 03:09:11.100]  excuse me, a George Soros
[03:09:11.100 --> 03:09:13.100]  backed, crooked DA
[03:09:13.100 --> 03:09:15.100]  that is going after
[03:09:15.100 --> 03:09:17.100]  President Donald J. Trump right now
[03:09:17.100 --> 03:09:19.100]  with an indictment, an arraignment
[03:09:19.100 --> 03:09:21.100]  an arrest made for the entire
[03:09:21.100 --> 03:09:23.100]  world to see, which, by the way
[03:09:23.100 --> 03:09:25.100]  in my opinion, only
[03:09:25.100 --> 03:09:27.100]  made President Trump look more
[03:09:27.100 --> 03:09:29.100]  powerful and stronger
[03:09:29.100 --> 03:09:31.100]  I don't know about you guys, but when I saw that arraignment
[03:09:31.100 --> 03:09:33.100]  I see Trump walking to the courthouse
[03:09:33.100 --> 03:09:35.100]  it just, it looks like
[03:09:35.100 --> 03:09:37.100]  New York just straight gangster
[03:09:37.100 --> 03:09:39.100]  stuff, you know what I mean?
[03:09:39.100 --> 03:09:41.100]  To my, the optics to me, I'm like
[03:09:41.100 --> 03:09:43.100]  that's a political martyr right there
[03:09:43.100 --> 03:09:45.100]  man, that's pretty gangster, I know Trump's got
[03:09:45.100 --> 03:09:47.100]  his problems, Operation Warp Speed
[03:09:47.100 --> 03:09:49.100]  and if you're a viewer of Infowars
[03:09:49.100 --> 03:09:51.100]  you know exactly what those
[03:09:51.100 --> 03:09:53.100]  problems are and we want to see Trump
[03:09:53.100 --> 03:09:55.100]  flip on the death poison, we want to see
[03:09:55.100 --> 03:09:57.100]  him denounce it continually and never fall
[03:09:57.100 --> 03:09:59.100]  into something like that ever again, but
[03:09:59.100 --> 03:10:01.100]  to his credit, the deep state
[03:10:01.100 --> 03:10:03.100]  the shadow government
[03:10:03.100 --> 03:10:05.100]  the satanic agents
[03:10:05.100 --> 03:10:07.100]  of Lucifer are continuing
[03:10:07.100 --> 03:10:09.100]  to go after him, his family
[03:10:09.100 --> 03:10:11.100]  these people
[03:10:11.100 --> 03:10:13.100]  have destroyed his family, destroyed his
[03:10:13.100 --> 03:10:15.100]  entire legacy, history will
[03:10:15.100 --> 03:10:17.100]  be rewritten by these people
[03:10:17.100 --> 03:10:19.100]  that President Donald J. Trump
[03:10:19.100 --> 03:10:21.100]  was Adolf Hitler 2.0
[03:10:21.100 --> 03:10:23.100]  and everyone that wore a mega hat was like
[03:10:23.100 --> 03:10:25.100]  the next SS, we all know
[03:10:25.100 --> 03:10:27.100]  that, because that's why they say that
[03:10:27.100 --> 03:10:29.100]  continually, that's what Adolf Hitler did
[03:10:29.100 --> 03:10:31.100]  very strategically
[03:10:31.100 --> 03:10:33.100]  and effectively, you tell a lie
[03:10:33.100 --> 03:10:35.100]  big enough that people will believe it and you
[03:10:35.100 --> 03:10:37.100]  continue to tell it continually and consistently
[03:10:37.100 --> 03:10:39.100]  and the masses will just accept it
[03:10:39.100 --> 03:10:41.100]  as truth. That is what they're
[03:10:41.100 --> 03:10:43.100]  effectively doing with President Trump
[03:10:43.100 --> 03:10:45.100]  his legacy, I mean you really think about
[03:10:45.100 --> 03:10:47.100]  Trump, a beloved, iconic
[03:10:47.100 --> 03:10:49.100]  not political figure, a
[03:10:49.100 --> 03:10:51.100]  cultural figure
[03:10:51.100 --> 03:10:53.100]  right? With everything
[03:10:53.100 --> 03:10:55.100]  that he's done with real estate in New
[03:10:55.100 --> 03:10:57.100]  York, an icon for decades
[03:10:57.100 --> 03:10:59.100]  everybody loved Trump, black
[03:10:59.100 --> 03:11:01.100]  people and rappers always referencing
[03:11:01.100 --> 03:11:03.100]  him when they're talking about making
[03:11:03.100 --> 03:11:05.100]  big money, he's literally
[03:11:05.100 --> 03:11:07.100]  a metaphor in black culture
[03:11:07.100 --> 03:11:09.100]  synonymous
[03:11:09.100 --> 03:11:11.100]  with making millions of dollars
[03:11:11.100 --> 03:11:13.100]  come on dude, how do you go from such
[03:11:13.100 --> 03:11:15.100]  a beloved iconic figure
[03:11:15.100 --> 03:11:17.100]  the apprentice
[03:11:17.100 --> 03:11:19.100]  making all of these
[03:11:19.100 --> 03:11:21.100]  mainstream waves in the
[03:11:21.100 --> 03:11:23.100]  culture goes from that
[03:11:23.100 --> 03:11:25.100]  to someone whose
[03:11:25.100 --> 03:11:27.100]  legacy being tarnished and destroyed
[03:11:27.100 --> 03:11:29.100]  for all of eternity, now why?
[03:11:29.100 --> 03:11:31.100]  The reason why I make that point is
[03:11:31.100 --> 03:11:33.100]  because that is how the New World Order
[03:11:33.100 --> 03:11:35.100]  functions, that is how propaganda
[03:11:35.100 --> 03:11:37.100]  functions, they go after
[03:11:37.100 --> 03:11:39.100]  your entire character, this is
[03:11:39.100 --> 03:11:41.100]  how the devil functions by the way
[03:11:41.100 --> 03:11:43.100]  they go after and they slander your entire
[03:11:43.100 --> 03:11:45.100]  character, they go after your family
[03:11:45.100 --> 03:11:47.100]  they strike fear into your family
[03:11:47.100 --> 03:11:49.100]  so that generations after you will
[03:11:49.100 --> 03:11:51.100]  fear and never ever even have a
[03:11:51.100 --> 03:11:53.100]  thought of rising like those past
[03:11:53.100 --> 03:11:55.100]  before you did rise up against
[03:11:55.100 --> 03:11:57.100]  them, this is about people
[03:11:57.100 --> 03:11:59.100]  that are identifying people
[03:11:59.100 --> 03:12:01.100]  waking up to the reality that A
[03:12:01.100 --> 03:12:03.100]  the New World Order and those
[03:12:03.100 --> 03:12:05.100]  in the shadow government exist
[03:12:05.100 --> 03:12:07.100]  100% and you're seeing it on both sides
[03:12:07.100 --> 03:12:09.100]  ok, we don't have to sit here and say
[03:12:09.100 --> 03:12:11.100]  that over and over again, it's not that hard
[03:12:11.100 --> 03:12:13.100]  to prove, it's not at all
[03:12:13.100 --> 03:12:15.100]  and people like Alex Jones
[03:12:15.100 --> 03:12:17.100]  have been absolutely vindicated
[03:12:17.100 --> 03:12:19.100]  and anyone else that spoke like this in the past
[03:12:19.100 --> 03:12:21.100]  10 years, things have been
[03:12:21.100 --> 03:12:23.100]  expedited, things have been into
[03:12:23.100 --> 03:12:25.100]  overdrive, we are
[03:12:25.100 --> 03:12:27.100]  we are in hyperspace right now
[03:12:27.100 --> 03:12:29.100]  ok, because people are just going
[03:12:29.100 --> 03:12:31.100]  straight into the future and they're seeing
[03:12:31.100 --> 03:12:33.100]  everything just literally
[03:12:33.100 --> 03:12:35.100]  illuminated, their eyes are being opened
[03:12:35.100 --> 03:12:37.100]  and people are getting red pilled and Christ
[03:12:37.100 --> 03:12:39.100]  pilled and the truth is waking people up
[03:12:39.100 --> 03:12:41.100]  to the reality that these things exist
[03:12:41.100 --> 03:12:43.100]  and the origin of it all is Satan
[03:12:43.100 --> 03:12:45.100]  himself, now the reason
[03:12:45.100 --> 03:12:47.100]  why I say this and I bring up President Trump
[03:12:47.100 --> 03:12:49.100]  is because this could be any one of us
[03:12:49.100 --> 03:12:51.100]  look what they did to the J6 prisoners
[03:12:51.100 --> 03:12:53.100]  look what they tried calling anyone
[03:12:53.100 --> 03:12:55.100]  that's mega, a mega republican
[03:12:55.100 --> 03:12:57.100]  a domestic terrorist, everything
[03:12:57.100 --> 03:12:59.100]  is white supremacist, even if you're black
[03:12:59.100 --> 03:13:01.100]  even if you're brown like me
[03:13:01.100 --> 03:13:03.100]  it doesn't matter
[03:13:03.100 --> 03:13:05.100]  if your ideas are pro-America
[03:13:05.100 --> 03:13:07.100]  if you believe in the United States
[03:13:07.100 --> 03:13:09.100]  Constitution, you believe in
[03:13:09.100 --> 03:13:11.100]  American sovereignty, you believe
[03:13:11.100 --> 03:13:13.100]  in the Pledge of Allegiance, you love
[03:13:13.100 --> 03:13:15.100]  the national anthem, whether you're white
[03:13:15.100 --> 03:13:17.100]  whether you're black, whether you're brown, whether
[03:13:17.100 --> 03:13:19.100]  you're green, whatever
[03:13:19.100 --> 03:13:21.100]  it's always the same
[03:13:21.100 --> 03:13:23.100]  psychological operation of cancel culture
[03:13:23.100 --> 03:13:25.100]  to shut down their political enemies
[03:13:25.100 --> 03:13:27.100]  that's white supremacy
[03:13:27.100 --> 03:13:29.100]  that's white nationalism
[03:13:29.100 --> 03:13:31.100]  that's Nazism, that's fascist
[03:13:31.100 --> 03:13:33.100]  that is the white hegemonic
[03:13:33.100 --> 03:13:35.100]  power invading your mind
[03:13:35.100 --> 03:13:37.100]  to get you to believe that that's somehow
[03:13:37.100 --> 03:13:39.100]  normal because anything
[03:13:39.100 --> 03:13:41.100]  that's America is white
[03:13:41.100 --> 03:13:43.100]  supremacy
[03:13:43.100 --> 03:13:45.100]  when in reality we have
[03:13:45.100 --> 03:13:47.100]  millions of people
[03:13:47.100 --> 03:13:49.100]  every single year attempting
[03:13:49.100 --> 03:13:51.100]  to come to this country
[03:13:51.100 --> 03:13:53.100]  illegally, which
[03:13:53.100 --> 03:13:55.100]  I despise totally
[03:13:55.100 --> 03:13:57.100]  because we've lost our border
[03:13:57.100 --> 03:13:59.100]  I believe in national sovereignty as a country
[03:13:59.100 --> 03:14:01.100]  because that's how God instituted things
[03:14:01.100 --> 03:14:03.100]  but we also have people
[03:14:03.100 --> 03:14:05.100]  coming to this country legally as well
[03:14:05.100 --> 03:14:07.100]  now the point with that is
[03:14:07.100 --> 03:14:09.100]  if the United States of America
[03:14:09.100 --> 03:14:11.100]  is such a white supremacist
[03:14:11.100 --> 03:14:13.100]  evil white nationalist
[03:14:13.100 --> 03:14:15.100]  place where black people
[03:14:15.100 --> 03:14:17.100]  and brown people can't even go
[03:14:17.100 --> 03:14:19.100]  and walk down the streets of the grocery store
[03:14:19.100 --> 03:14:21.100]  without being called the N-word
[03:14:21.100 --> 03:14:23.100]  or Hispanic people
[03:14:23.100 --> 03:14:25.100]  being called the B-word
[03:14:25.100 --> 03:14:27.100]  or the W-word and there's just
[03:14:27.100 --> 03:14:29.100]  there's racism everywhere you look
[03:14:29.100 --> 03:14:31.100]  and I can't get a job because the
[03:14:31.100 --> 03:14:33.100]  color of my skin, this is how these people
[03:14:33.100 --> 03:14:35.100]  act at the federal
[03:14:35.100 --> 03:14:37.100]  level even at the presidency
[03:14:37.100 --> 03:14:39.100]  the so-called presidency right now
[03:14:39.100 --> 03:14:41.100]  with the New World Order puppets that are
[03:14:41.100 --> 03:14:43.100]  in there, including Joe Biden
[03:14:43.100 --> 03:14:45.100]  and Kamala Harris
[03:14:45.100 --> 03:14:47.100]  these people peddle these lies at the federal
[03:14:47.100 --> 03:14:49.100]  mainstream level as well
[03:14:49.100 --> 03:14:51.100]  now if it's that bad
[03:14:51.100 --> 03:14:53.100]  why are brown people and black people
[03:14:53.100 --> 03:14:55.100]  trying to get to this country
[03:14:55.100 --> 03:14:57.100]  both illegally and legally every single day
[03:14:57.100 --> 03:14:59.100]  you want to know why?
[03:14:59.100 --> 03:15:01.100]  because this country is far
[03:15:01.100 --> 03:15:03.100]  beyond greater than
[03:15:03.100 --> 03:15:05.100]  any country on the face of planet Earth
[03:15:05.100 --> 03:15:07.100]  now it doesn't look like that right now
[03:15:07.100 --> 03:15:09.100]  but the American dream
[03:15:09.100 --> 03:15:11.100]  the light on the hill
[03:15:11.100 --> 03:15:13.100]  that is exactly what the New World Order hates
[03:15:13.100 --> 03:15:15.100]  now the psy-op is
[03:15:15.100 --> 03:15:17.100]  everything I just explained to you
[03:15:17.100 --> 03:15:19.100]  how do you get an entire generation
[03:15:19.100 --> 03:15:21.100]  of American citizens
[03:15:21.100 --> 03:15:23.100]  to hate themselves
[03:15:23.100 --> 03:15:25.100]  dismantle their own borders
[03:15:25.100 --> 03:15:27.100]  invade their culture
[03:15:27.100 --> 03:15:29.100]  invade their education
[03:15:29.100 --> 03:15:31.100]  dismantle anything that is pro-America
[03:15:31.100 --> 03:15:33.100]  that is pro-patriot
[03:15:33.100 --> 03:15:35.100]  to their own country
[03:15:35.100 --> 03:15:37.100]  the commies and the globalists
[03:15:37.100 --> 03:15:39.100]  and the New World Order and the Satanists
[03:15:39.100 --> 03:15:41.100]  and Luciferians at the top
[03:15:41.100 --> 03:15:43.100]  they infiltrate every single one of those channels
[03:15:43.100 --> 03:15:45.100]  to get the American people
[03:15:45.100 --> 03:15:47.100]  themselves to hate themselves
[03:15:47.100 --> 03:15:49.100]  and their own country and cause
[03:15:49.100 --> 03:15:51.100]  a mass destabilization
[03:15:51.100 --> 03:15:53.100]  but you and I, the thought criminals and the info warriors
[03:15:53.100 --> 03:15:55.100]  will not let it happen, we'll be right back
[03:16:11.100 --> 03:16:13.100]  at a different time of war
[03:16:41.100 --> 03:16:43.100]  what we want to do in Davos is
[03:16:43.100 --> 03:16:45.100]  push the reset button
[03:16:45.100 --> 03:16:47.100]  as soon as we start exposing
[03:16:47.100 --> 03:16:49.100]  the great reset, the sooner
[03:16:49.100 --> 03:16:51.100]  these globalists start going to prison
[03:17:11.100 --> 03:17:13.100]  these fighters
[03:17:13.100 --> 03:17:15.100]  they really have been the MVPs
[03:17:15.100 --> 03:17:17.100]  in this fight
[03:17:17.100 --> 03:17:19.100]  and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Troyer
[03:17:19.100 --> 03:17:21.100]  and the hard work they engage in every day
[03:17:21.100 --> 03:17:23.100]  5, 6, 7 days a week
[03:17:23.100 --> 03:17:25.100]  it's really just incredible
[03:17:25.100 --> 03:17:27.100]  so for myself and the whole info wars crew
[03:17:27.100 --> 03:17:29.100]  I thank you for your past support
[03:17:29.100 --> 03:17:31.100]  and I want to encourage you now to realize that
[03:17:31.100 --> 03:17:33.100]  info wars cannot stay on air

[03:17:47.100 --> 03:17:49.100]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners

[03:17:51.100 --> 03:17:53.100]  if just 1% more of you took action

[03:18:01.100 --> 03:18:03.100]  control my destiny, your destiny
[03:18:03.100 --> 03:18:05.100]  our children's destiny
[03:18:05.100 --> 03:18:07.100]  and that war is something that we can win

[03:21:01.100 --> 03:21:03.100]  well speaking of 2024 and the presidential election
[03:21:03.100 --> 03:21:05.100]  like I was saying before
[03:21:05.100 --> 03:21:07.100]  we went to break

[03:21:11.100 --> 03:21:13.100]  okay
[03:21:13.100 --> 03:21:15.100]  just because you see guys like president Trump
[03:21:15.100 --> 03:21:17.100]  you see guys like Alex Jones
[03:21:17.100 --> 03:21:19.100]  Roger Stone
[03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:21.100]  Steve Bannon

[03:21:23.100 --> 03:21:25.100]  these figures that the deep state
[03:21:25.100 --> 03:21:27.100]  puts on trial in front of the entire world
[03:21:27.100 --> 03:21:29.100]  political martyrs

[03:21:33.100 --> 03:21:35.100]  they went after
[03:21:35.100 --> 03:21:37.100]  the supporters and those
[03:21:37.100 --> 03:21:39.100]  that make
[03:21:39.100 --> 03:21:41.100]  those individuals
[03:21:41.100 --> 03:21:43.100]  that listen to them, that follow them
[03:21:43.100 --> 03:21:45.100]  that have the same ideas
[03:21:45.100 --> 03:21:47.100]  the same views
[03:21:47.100 --> 03:21:49.100]  fast forward 2022
[03:21:49.100 --> 03:21:51.100]  they rolled out the mega republicans
[03:21:51.100 --> 03:21:53.100]  domestic terrorists
[03:21:53.100 --> 03:21:55.100]  and even in 2021
[03:21:55.100 --> 03:21:57.100]  they were rolling out the FBI saying
[03:21:57.100 --> 03:21:59.100]  if you wave a don't tread me flag
[03:21:59.100 --> 03:22:01.100]  that's domestic terrorism
[03:22:01.100 --> 03:22:03.100]  you love the second amendment
[03:22:03.100 --> 03:22:05.100]  that's domestic
[03:22:05.100 --> 03:22:07.100]  terrorism, that's a red flag
[03:22:07.100 --> 03:22:09.100]  that's a sign that you are being
[03:22:09.100 --> 03:22:11.100]  radicalized by the right wing to want to
[03:22:11.100 --> 03:22:13.100]  run around and kill people
[03:22:13.100 --> 03:22:15.100]  the point I was trying to make
[03:22:15.100 --> 03:22:17.100]  last segment is
[03:22:17.100 --> 03:22:19.100]  the new world order
[03:22:19.100 --> 03:22:21.100]  and these globalist entities
[03:22:21.100 --> 03:22:23.100]  the commies, whatever you want to call them
[03:22:23.100 --> 03:22:25.100]  they're all agents of Lucifer
[03:22:25.100 --> 03:22:27.100]  they're masters of propaganda
[03:22:27.100 --> 03:22:29.100]  linguistics
[03:22:29.100 --> 03:22:31.100]  the way that they speak
[03:22:31.100 --> 03:22:33.100]  the way that they manipulate the minds of people through the words
[03:22:33.100 --> 03:22:35.100]  that they say
[03:22:35.100 --> 03:22:37.100]  I wouldn't even say the average IQ
[03:22:37.100 --> 03:22:39.100]  individual, the low IQ
[03:22:39.100 --> 03:22:41.100]  individuals, the woke-tard
[03:22:41.100 --> 03:22:43.100]  NPCs out there that just believe
[03:22:43.100 --> 03:22:45.100]  everything, you know, that the homosexuals
[03:22:45.100 --> 03:22:47.100]  on CNN tell them every
[03:22:47.100 --> 03:22:49.100]  single day, you know what I mean, like oh yes
[03:22:49.100 --> 03:22:51.100]  yes Don Lemon, yes
[03:22:51.100 --> 03:22:53.100]  I should hate white people
[03:22:53.100 --> 03:22:55.100]  even though you're with a white guy
[03:22:55.100 --> 03:22:57.100]  oh yeah, yeah
[03:22:57.100 --> 03:22:59.100]  yeah Don Lemon
[03:22:59.100 --> 03:23:01.100]  tell me how to live, tell me how to
[03:23:01.100 --> 03:23:03.100]  thank Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper
[03:23:03.100 --> 03:23:05.100]  those
[03:23:05.100 --> 03:23:07.100]  type of stupid people, you know who I'm
[03:23:07.100 --> 03:23:09.100]  talking about, right? Those people are
[03:23:09.100 --> 03:23:11.100]  easy to deceive, those people are
[03:23:11.100 --> 03:23:13.100]  easy to manipulate, those people are
[03:23:13.100 --> 03:23:15.100]  easy, you know, the useful idiots
[03:23:15.100 --> 03:23:17.100]  right? But these people know
[03:23:17.100 --> 03:23:19.100]  how to jujitsu their way
[03:23:19.100 --> 03:23:21.100]  through words and sentences, propaganda
[03:23:21.100 --> 03:23:23.100]  through the optics
[03:23:23.100 --> 03:23:25.100]  you see through social media, not just the
[03:23:25.100 --> 03:23:27.100]  fake news media cartel on CNN
[03:23:27.100 --> 03:23:29.100]  CuckNN, MSNBC
[03:23:29.100 --> 03:23:31.100]  and all these other outlets that they use
[03:23:31.100 --> 03:23:33.100]  but TikTok, Instagram, big
[03:23:33.100 --> 03:23:35.100]  tech apparatuses, you name it, YouTube
[03:23:35.100 --> 03:23:37.100]  that they're pumping all this garbage
[03:23:37.100 --> 03:23:39.100]  into the minds of children
[03:23:39.100 --> 03:23:41.100]  on one end
[03:23:41.100 --> 03:23:43.100]  they know exactly that they're liars, they
[03:23:43.100 --> 03:23:45.100]  know that they're hypocrites, they know what they're
[03:23:45.100 --> 03:23:47.100]  saying doesn't correspond with reality
[03:23:47.100 --> 03:23:49.100]  but that's not what they're trying to
[03:23:49.100 --> 03:23:51.100]  achieve
[03:23:51.100 --> 03:23:53.100]  that's why they lie, that's why they propagate
[03:23:53.100 --> 03:23:55.100]  because they're trying to mask
[03:23:55.100 --> 03:23:57.100]  it's a mirage of what the truth actually
[03:23:57.100 --> 03:23:59.100]  is and you get these people
[03:23:59.100 --> 03:24:01.100]  that believe it, they believe the lies about
[03:24:01.100 --> 03:24:03.100]  President Trump, they believe the lies about
[03:24:03.100 --> 03:24:05.100]  Alex Jones, they believe the lies about
[03:24:05.100 --> 03:24:07.100]  Roger Stone, they believe the lies
[03:24:07.100 --> 03:24:09.100]  about you
[03:24:09.100 --> 03:24:11.100]  and this could be any one of us
[03:24:11.100 --> 03:24:13.100]  the point here
[03:24:13.100 --> 03:24:15.100]  the point here is
[03:24:15.100 --> 03:24:17.100]  what is mega
[03:24:17.100 --> 03:24:19.100]  right, American values
[03:24:19.100 --> 03:24:21.100]  patriotism
[03:24:21.100 --> 03:24:23.100]  and to Trump's credit in the 2016
[03:24:23.100 --> 03:24:25.100]  campaign, Roger Stone and all those guys
[03:24:25.100 --> 03:24:27.100]  that did a phenomenal job
[03:24:27.100 --> 03:24:29.100]  they just simply branded American
[03:24:29.100 --> 03:24:31.100]  values, they simply
[03:24:31.100 --> 03:24:33.100]  branded American values
[03:24:33.100 --> 03:24:35.100]  and they branded the values
[03:24:35.100 --> 03:24:37.100]  that have been getting degraded
[03:24:37.100 --> 03:24:39.100]  by the deep state and the new world order
[03:24:39.100 --> 03:24:41.100]  for the past 30, 50 years
[03:24:41.100 --> 03:24:43.100]  that's what amplified
[03:24:43.100 --> 03:24:45.100]  and put on a
[03:24:45.100 --> 03:24:47.100]  just rocket ship
[03:24:47.100 --> 03:24:49.100]  straight into space what
[03:24:49.100 --> 03:24:51.100]  this movement really was
[03:24:51.100 --> 03:24:53.100]  and the reason why I say that is
[03:24:53.100 --> 03:24:55.100]  this transcends the
[03:24:55.100 --> 03:24:57.100]  person of Donald Trump because the values
[03:24:57.100 --> 03:24:59.100]  they predate, they transcend
[03:24:59.100 --> 03:25:01.100]  who Donald J. Trump is
[03:25:01.100 --> 03:25:03.100]  he predates, okay
[03:25:03.100 --> 03:25:05.100]  he was just the catalyst
[03:25:05.100 --> 03:25:07.100]  that kicked this thing off
[03:25:07.100 --> 03:25:09.100]  so whether Trump is here or gone
[03:25:09.100 --> 03:25:11.100]  these values remain, they're not going
[03:25:11.100 --> 03:25:13.100]  anywhere, that is what the new world
[03:25:13.100 --> 03:25:15.100]  order hates, it's about
[03:25:15.100 --> 03:25:17.100]  an individual coming out
[03:25:17.100 --> 03:25:19.100]  speaking up, going against the
[03:25:19.100 --> 03:25:21.100]  establishment, going against the
[03:25:21.100 --> 03:25:23.100]  mainstream narrative, going against
[03:25:23.100 --> 03:25:25.100]  the current of the new world
[03:25:25.100 --> 03:25:27.100]  order that is falling down
[03:25:27.100 --> 03:25:29.100]  upon all of us and it doesn't matter
[03:25:29.100 --> 03:25:31.100]  if you're a billionaire from New York
[03:25:31.100 --> 03:25:33.100]  it doesn't matter if you're Alex Jones
[03:25:33.100 --> 03:25:35.100]  from Texas with a huge audience
[03:25:35.100 --> 03:25:37.100]  they just see them as
[03:25:37.100 --> 03:25:39.100]  targets because they have the biggest
[03:25:39.100 --> 03:25:41.100]  voices right now
[03:25:41.100 --> 03:25:43.100]  it could be you, it could be
[03:25:43.100 --> 03:25:45.100]  me, this will
[03:25:45.100 --> 03:25:47.100]  happen in the workplace, that's what
[03:25:47.100 --> 03:25:49.100]  cancel culture is, we've already
[03:25:49.100 --> 03:25:51.100]  seen these psyops run on the American
[03:25:51.100 --> 03:25:53.100]  people, where you're afraid to say
[03:25:53.100 --> 03:25:55.100]  anything in the culture, you get
[03:25:55.100 --> 03:25:57.100]  cancelled at universities immediately
[03:25:57.100 --> 03:25:59.100]  they did it in Disney to Gino Carano
[03:25:59.100 --> 03:26:01.100]  they've done it in American culture
[03:26:01.100 --> 03:26:03.100]  they've done it in
[03:26:03.100 --> 03:26:05.100]  Hollywood, they've done it in the music
[03:26:05.100 --> 03:26:07.100]  industry, they've done it in education
[03:26:07.100 --> 03:26:09.100]  in medicine, did you not live
[03:26:09.100 --> 03:26:11.100]  through 2020 and 2021?
[03:26:11.100 --> 03:26:13.100]  Where the heroes
[03:26:13.100 --> 03:26:15.100]  of 2020, the doctors and
[03:26:15.100 --> 03:26:17.100]  the nurses that saved people's
[03:26:17.100 --> 03:26:19.100]  lives in hospitals by putting their
[03:26:19.100 --> 03:26:21.100]  lives on the line, oh when they didn't
[03:26:21.100 --> 03:26:23.100]  want to take the death poison in 2021
[03:26:23.100 --> 03:26:25.100]  they became
[03:26:25.100 --> 03:26:27.100]  the villains
[03:26:27.100 --> 03:26:29.100]  they became slandered and destroyed
[03:26:29.100 --> 03:26:31.100]  the point is, it doesn't matter
[03:26:31.100 --> 03:26:33.100]  if you are an individual, a teacher
[03:26:33.100 --> 03:26:35.100]  a school bus
[03:26:35.100 --> 03:26:37.100]  driver, any one
[03:26:37.100 --> 03:26:39.100]  of us, the
[03:26:39.100 --> 03:26:41.100]  way that you get a target
[03:26:41.100 --> 03:26:43.100]  on your back is when you start
[03:26:43.100 --> 03:26:45.100]  getting vocal, you start making
[03:26:45.100 --> 03:26:47.100]  some noise and you start
[03:26:47.100 --> 03:26:49.100]  telling these people no, and
[03:26:49.100 --> 03:26:51.100]  the moment you do that, you start waking
[03:26:51.100 --> 03:26:53.100]  up other people that feel the same
[03:26:53.100 --> 03:26:55.100]  way, that's why they shadow ban
[03:26:55.100 --> 03:26:57.100]  anyone on YouTube, that's why they
[03:26:57.100 --> 03:26:59.100]  deplatform anyone on social media that
[03:26:59.100 --> 03:27:01.100]  turns out this way, because they want to
[03:27:01.100 --> 03:27:03.100]  stop the masses from mobilizing
[03:27:03.100 --> 03:27:05.100]  so what's happening with
[03:27:05.100 --> 03:27:07.100]  President Trump, just like
[03:27:07.100 --> 03:27:09.100]  everything that happened with Alex Jones
[03:27:09.100 --> 03:27:11.100]  when he got deplatformed, which
[03:27:11.100 --> 03:27:13.100]  in my opinion, I think President Trump
[03:27:13.100 --> 03:27:15.100]  should have paid a lot more close attention
[03:27:15.100 --> 03:27:17.100]  to, which a lot of right wing
[03:27:17.100 --> 03:27:19.100]  conservatives didn't, and now they are
[03:27:19.100 --> 03:27:21.100]  because they're all getting hit
[03:27:21.100 --> 03:27:23.100]  Infowars and Alex Jones was the tip of the spear
[03:27:23.100 --> 03:27:25.100]  deplatformed, censored, destroyed
[03:27:25.100 --> 03:27:27.100]  on YouTube, but they're still
[03:27:27.100 --> 03:27:29.100]  standing, we're all here, still standing
[03:27:29.100 --> 03:27:31.100]  by God's grace, because you
[03:27:31.100 --> 03:27:33.100]  could never shut down and defeat the truth
[03:27:33.100 --> 03:27:35.100]  because if God be for us, who could be against
[03:27:35.100 --> 03:27:37.100]  us, that's why ban.video
[03:27:37.100 --> 03:27:39.100]  still exists today
[03:27:39.100 --> 03:27:41.100]  the devil will launch attacks
[03:27:41.100 --> 03:27:43.100]  until we're all dead and gone
[03:27:43.100 --> 03:27:45.100]  and whoever comes after us
[03:27:45.100 --> 03:27:47.100]  will pick up the baton and
[03:27:47.100 --> 03:27:49.100]  continue on into the future until Christ
[03:27:49.100 --> 03:27:51.100]  returns and takes us home
[03:27:51.100 --> 03:27:53.100]  these attacks are never going to stop
[03:27:53.100 --> 03:27:55.100]  but by God's grace and God's power
[03:27:55.100 --> 03:27:57.100]  we stand here on our own two feet
[03:27:57.100 --> 03:27:59.100]  and we push back, we continue to expose
[03:27:59.100 --> 03:28:01.100]  and we continue to say no
[03:28:01.100 --> 03:28:03.100]  and we continue to enlighten
[03:28:03.100 --> 03:28:05.100]  and wake up the public with true enlightenment
[03:28:05.100 --> 03:28:07.100]  that's Christ, his word, and the light
[03:28:07.100 --> 03:28:09.100]  of God
[03:28:09.100 --> 03:28:11.100]  that's what the darkness hates
[03:28:11.100 --> 03:28:13.100]  but people need to understand
[03:28:13.100 --> 03:28:15.100]  this is you, this is coming after you
[03:28:15.100 --> 03:28:17.100]  this is coming after your family because this is
[03:28:17.100 --> 03:28:19.100]  about values
[03:28:19.100 --> 03:28:21.100]  these people hate what you believe in
[03:28:21.100 --> 03:28:23.100]  they hate what you stand for
[03:28:23.100 --> 03:28:25.100]  this goes beyond Donald Trump
[03:28:25.100 --> 03:28:27.100]  this goes beyond Alex Jones, Drew Hernandez
[03:28:27.100 --> 03:28:29.100]  your favorite commentator that's actually
[03:28:29.100 --> 03:28:31.100]  real, this goes beyond
[03:28:31.100 --> 03:28:33.100]  any one of us
[03:28:33.100 --> 03:28:35.100]  good versus evil, an attack on
[03:28:35.100 --> 03:28:37.100]  humanity, the new world order
[03:28:37.100 --> 03:28:39.100]  empowered by Lucifer and the anti-Christ
[03:28:39.100 --> 03:28:41.100]  going after you
[03:28:41.100 --> 03:28:43.100]  day by day, minute by minute
[03:28:43.100 --> 03:28:45.100]  these people do not sleep
[03:28:45.100 --> 03:28:47.100]  they do not stop
[03:28:47.100 --> 03:28:49.100]  if you're not awake by now
[03:28:49.100 --> 03:28:51.100]  you better be awake because this stuff is absolutely real
[03:28:51.100 --> 03:28:53.100]  we'll be right back
[03:29:15.100 --> 03:29:17.100]  and when you look at Harrison Smith
[03:29:17.100 --> 03:29:19.100]  and Owen Schroyer and the hard work
[03:29:19.100 --> 03:29:21.100]  they engage in every day
[03:29:21.100 --> 03:29:23.100]  5, 6, 7 days a week
[03:29:23.100 --> 03:29:25.100]  it's really just incredible
[03:29:25.100 --> 03:29:27.100]  so for myself and the whole Infowars crew
[03:29:27.100 --> 03:29:29.100]  I thank you for your past support
[03:29:29.100 --> 03:29:31.100]  and I want to encourage you now to realize that
[03:29:31.100 --> 03:29:33.100]  Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us
[03:29:33.100 --> 03:29:35.100]  I know you spread the word
[03:29:35.100 --> 03:29:37.100]  I know you pray for us and that's wonderful
[03:29:37.100 --> 03:29:39.100]  keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners
[03:29:39.100 --> 03:29:41.100]  never go to Infowarsstore.com
[03:29:41.100 --> 03:29:43.100]  and you never buy great products
[03:29:43.100 --> 03:29:45.100]  that can enrich and empower your life
[03:29:45.100 --> 03:29:47.100]  while at the same time giving us on air
[03:29:47.100 --> 03:29:49.100]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products
[03:29:49.100 --> 03:29:51.100]  at Infowarsstore.com
[03:29:51.100 --> 03:29:53.100]  if just 1% more of you took action
[03:29:53.100 --> 03:29:55.100]  and went to Infowarsstore.com
[03:29:55.100 --> 03:29:57.100]  our funding problems will be over, please take action now
[03:29:57.100 --> 03:29:59.100]  there is a war for the future happening right now
[03:29:59.100 --> 03:30:01.100]  there is a war that will
[03:30:01.100 --> 03:30:03.100]  control my destiny, your destiny
[03:30:03.100 --> 03:30:05.100]  our children's destiny
[03:30:05.100 --> 03:30:07.100]  and that war is something that we can win
[03:30:07.100 --> 03:30:09.100]  but it takes dedication, it takes commitment
[03:30:09.100 --> 03:30:11.100]  that's why I ask listeners
[03:30:11.100 --> 03:30:13.100]  to go to Infowarsstore.com
[03:30:13.100 --> 03:30:15.100]  and buy great products that will
[03:30:15.100 --> 03:30:17.100]  enrich and empower your life while keeping us
[03:30:17.100 --> 03:30:19.100]  on air at the very
[03:30:19.100 --> 03:30:21.100]  same time
[03:30:21.100 --> 03:30:23.100]  Infowarsstore.com
[03:30:23.100 --> 03:30:25.100]  to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book

[03:30:51.100 --> 03:30:53.100]  plus they keep us on air
[03:30:53.100 --> 03:30:55.100]  so again please take action
[03:30:55.100 --> 03:30:57.100]  go to Infowarsstore.com today and I thank you
[03:30:57.100 --> 03:30:59.100]  ladies and gentlemen, this book
[03:30:59.100 --> 03:31:01.100]  The Great Reset and War for the World
[03:31:01.100 --> 03:31:03.100]  is a historic book that documents the
[03:31:03.100 --> 03:31:05.100]  globalists in their own words
[03:31:05.100 --> 03:31:07.100]  plan for our future, that is a hellish future
[03:31:07.100 --> 03:31:09.100]  you will always, while they still allow books
[03:31:09.100 --> 03:31:11.100]  I guess, they're starting to ban them
[03:31:11.100 --> 03:31:13.100]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World
[03:31:13.100 --> 03:31:15.100]  at bookstores, Amazon or Infowarsstore.com
[03:31:15.100 --> 03:31:17.100]  but you will never be able to get
[03:31:17.100 --> 03:31:19.100]  another signed copy of the book
[03:31:19.100 --> 03:31:21.100]  after the signed copies we got
[03:31:21.100 --> 03:31:23.100]  run out, and there's about a thousand left
[03:31:23.100 --> 03:31:25.100]  of them right now, so get your copy
[03:31:25.100 --> 03:31:27.100]  of The Great Reset and War for the World
[03:31:27.100 --> 03:31:29.100]  a signed copy at Infowarsstore.com
[03:31:29.100 --> 03:31:31.100]  and there is a mark up there
[03:31:31.100 --> 03:31:33.100]  because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air
[03:31:33.100 --> 03:31:35.100]  so you won't just have this historic memento
[03:31:35.100 --> 03:31:37.100]  and this powerful book, you'll also know
[03:31:37.100 --> 03:31:39.100]  that you help keep Infowars on the air
[03:31:39.100 --> 03:31:41.100]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies
[03:31:41.100 --> 03:31:43.100]  of the book, or unsigned copies
[03:31:43.100 --> 03:31:45.100]  but I want to encourage all of you
[03:31:45.100 --> 03:31:47.100]  who haven't yet, to go to Infowarsstore.com
[03:31:47.100 --> 03:31:49.100]  and get a signed copy
[03:31:49.100 --> 03:31:51.100]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate it
[03:31:51.100 --> 03:31:53.100]  to the library, or give them to the local
[03:31:53.100 --> 03:31:55.100]  school, this is an Infowar, I'm counting
[03:31:55.100 --> 03:31:57.100]  on you, and thank you for your support
[03:31:57.100 --> 03:31:59.100]  they decided to not perp walking
[03:31:59.100 --> 03:32:01.100]  not put them in handcuffs, not do a mugshot
[03:32:01.100 --> 03:32:03.100]  because they knew that that would help Trump
[03:32:03.100 --> 03:32:05.100]  didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:32:05.100 --> 03:32:07.100]  we were waiting for the mugshot
[03:32:07.100 --> 03:32:09.100]  we learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own
[03:32:09.100 --> 03:32:11.100]  and it says political
[03:32:11.100 --> 03:32:13.100]  prisoner, with an image
[03:32:13.100 --> 03:32:15.100]  of President Trump, the shirt
[03:32:15.100 --> 03:32:17.100]  is being printed now in Texas
[03:32:17.100 --> 03:32:19.100]  it'll be shipping out to you in one week
[03:32:19.100 --> 03:32:21.100]  political prisoner, with Trump
[03:32:21.100 --> 03:32:23.100]  on the front there
[03:32:23.100 --> 03:32:25.100]  in a mugshot jail background
[03:32:25.100 --> 03:32:27.100]  it's a fundraiser shirt, it says
[03:32:27.100 --> 03:32:29.100]  Infowars.com on the
[03:32:29.100 --> 03:32:31.100]  back of the shirt
[03:32:31.100 --> 03:32:33.100]  we also have Alex Jones for President, no I'm not running for President
[03:32:33.100 --> 03:32:35.100]  it's a really nice navy blue
[03:32:35.100 --> 03:32:37.100]  high quality shirt, red, white and blue
[03:32:37.100 --> 03:32:39.100]  Alex Jones for President, 2024
[03:32:39.100 --> 03:32:41.100]  it's a fun conversational piece, and a limited edition shirt
[03:32:41.100 --> 03:32:43.100]  great way to fund the operation
[03:32:43.100 --> 03:32:45.100]  so get your
[03:32:45.100 --> 03:32:47.100]  Alex Jones for President and Trump
[03:32:47.100 --> 03:32:49.100]  mugshot shirts at
[03:32:49.100 --> 03:32:51.100]  Infowarsstore.com
[03:32:51.100 --> 03:32:53.100]  or by calling toll free
[03:32:53.100 --> 03:32:55.100]  triple A, 253-3139
[03:33:01.100 --> 03:33:03.100]  of the New World Order
[03:33:03.100 --> 03:33:05.100]  it's Alex Jones
[03:33:31.100 --> 03:33:33.100]  by the CCP
[03:33:33.100 --> 03:33:35.100]  propaganda machine known as TikTok
[03:33:35.100 --> 03:33:37.100]  millions of views
[03:33:37.100 --> 03:33:39.100]  targeting minors
[03:33:39.100 --> 03:33:41.100]  little children
[03:33:41.100 --> 03:33:43.100]  indoctrinating
[03:33:43.100 --> 03:33:45.100]  confusing
[03:33:45.100 --> 03:33:47.100]  and poisoning their minds
[03:33:47.100 --> 03:33:49.100]  with degeneracy, immorality
[03:33:49.100 --> 03:33:51.100]  depravity
[03:33:51.100 --> 03:33:53.100]  perversion
[03:33:53.100 --> 03:33:55.100]  showing little kids
[03:33:55.100 --> 03:33:57.100]  what they call
[03:33:57.100 --> 03:33:59.100]  progression
[03:33:59.100 --> 03:34:01.100]  which is actually
[03:34:01.100 --> 03:34:03.100]  morality
[03:34:03.100 --> 03:34:05.100]  being degraded
[03:34:05.100 --> 03:34:07.100]  100%
[03:34:07.100 --> 03:34:09.100]  it's quite the opposite
[03:34:09.100 --> 03:34:11.100]  but what I'll say is this
[03:34:11.100 --> 03:34:13.100]  and I don't know if the crew
[03:34:13.100 --> 03:34:15.100]  I'm pretty sure they can, if you guys can
[03:34:15.100 --> 03:34:17.100]  pull up a picture of Baphomet
[03:34:17.100 --> 03:34:19.100]  Baphomet with little children
[03:34:19.100 --> 03:34:21.100]  around him, right
[03:34:21.100 --> 03:34:23.100]  the depiction of Lucifer, half beast
[03:34:23.100 --> 03:34:25.100]  half man
[03:34:25.100 --> 03:34:27.100]  half woman
[03:34:27.100 --> 03:34:29.100]  always with little kids sitting around
[03:34:29.100 --> 03:34:31.100]  looking up to Baphomet
[03:34:31.100 --> 03:34:33.100]  this has been a depiction of Satan
[03:34:33.100 --> 03:34:35.100]  for centuries
[03:34:35.100 --> 03:34:37.100]  and you want to talk about the so-called
[03:34:37.100 --> 03:34:39.100]  trans movement, I'll just use
[03:34:39.100 --> 03:34:41.100]  the term for now
[03:34:41.100 --> 03:34:43.100]  I don't believe trans people exist at all
[03:34:43.100 --> 03:34:45.100]  and there it is right there
[03:34:45.100 --> 03:34:47.100]  always with little kids sitting at the side
[03:34:47.100 --> 03:34:49.100]  looking up
[03:34:49.100 --> 03:34:51.100]  half beast, half man
[03:34:51.100 --> 03:34:53.100]  half female
[03:34:53.100 --> 03:34:55.100]  and you can argue
[03:34:55.100 --> 03:34:57.100]  maybe part angel as well
[03:34:57.100 --> 03:34:59.100]  with the wings on the back
[03:34:59.100 --> 03:35:01.100]  because Lucifer is a fallen angel
[03:35:01.100 --> 03:35:03.100]  as well
[03:35:03.100 --> 03:35:05.100]  what is this really?
[03:35:05.100 --> 03:35:07.100]  I know it's easy
[03:35:07.100 --> 03:35:09.100]  to make fun of Dylan Mulvaney
[03:35:09.100 --> 03:35:11.100]  because he's mentally ill
[03:35:11.100 --> 03:35:13.100]  mentally unstable, but I think
[03:35:13.100 --> 03:35:15.100]  the darker and more serious
[03:35:15.100 --> 03:35:17.100]  issue is the
[03:35:17.100 --> 03:35:19.100]  state of the culture with the total depravity
[03:35:19.100 --> 03:35:21.100]  right now going on
[03:35:21.100 --> 03:35:23.100]  with the so-called LGBTQ
[03:35:23.100 --> 03:35:25.100]  movement, waving that damn
[03:35:25.100 --> 03:35:27.100]  flag around, hijacked the rainbow
[03:35:27.100 --> 03:35:29.100]  which belongs to God by the way
[03:35:29.100 --> 03:35:31.100]  it just seems like these people steal everything
[03:35:31.100 --> 03:35:33.100]  they steal the rainbow from God
[03:35:33.100 --> 03:35:35.100]  they want to steal your children
[03:35:35.100 --> 03:35:37.100]  they want to steal their genitals
[03:35:37.100 --> 03:35:39.100]  chop them up
[03:35:39.100 --> 03:35:41.100]  sell them for a profit
[03:35:41.100 --> 03:35:43.100]  always with
[03:35:43.100 --> 03:35:45.100]  children, the epitome
[03:35:45.100 --> 03:35:47.100]  listen, I'll say this, Dylan Mulvaney is
[03:35:47.100 --> 03:35:49.100]  the epitome of evil
[03:35:49.100 --> 03:35:51.100]  alright, this is my opinion
[03:35:51.100 --> 03:35:53.100]  Dylan Mulvaney is the epitome
[03:35:53.100 --> 03:35:55.100]  of evil
[03:35:55.100 --> 03:35:57.100]  of Luciferianism
[03:35:57.100 --> 03:35:59.100]  because
[03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:01.100]  Satan, and the Bible makes it very clear
[03:36:01.100 --> 03:36:03.100]  Lucifer
[03:36:03.100 --> 03:36:05.100]  he masquerades
[03:36:05.100 --> 03:36:07.100]  he
[03:36:07.100 --> 03:36:09.100]  he counterfeits
[03:36:09.100 --> 03:36:11.100]  and he camouflages as an angel
[03:36:11.100 --> 03:36:13.100]  of light, he appears to be
[03:36:13.100 --> 03:36:15.100]  a friend, he appears to be
[03:36:15.100 --> 03:36:17.100]  neutral, he appears
[03:36:17.100 --> 03:36:19.100]  to not be a threat
[03:36:19.100 --> 03:36:21.100]  he appears to be someone that's safe
[03:36:21.100 --> 03:36:23.100]  that's what that means
[03:36:23.100 --> 03:36:25.100]  an angel of light is someone that you
[03:36:25.100 --> 03:36:27.100]  come to for protection
[03:36:27.100 --> 03:36:29.100]  or you don't
[03:36:29.100 --> 03:36:31.100]  see as an enemy or any danger
[03:36:31.100 --> 03:36:33.100]  in
[03:36:33.100 --> 03:36:35.100]  now why do I say that? Because
[03:36:35.100 --> 03:36:37.100]  what this mentally ill pervert
[03:36:37.100 --> 03:36:39.100]  represents is an individual
[03:36:39.100 --> 03:36:41.100]  that is specifically
[03:36:41.100 --> 03:36:43.100]  masquerading as
[03:36:43.100 --> 03:36:45.100]  someone safe in the mainstream
[03:36:45.100 --> 03:36:47.100]  that is specifically
[03:36:47.100 --> 03:36:49.100]  targeting children
[03:36:49.100 --> 03:36:51.100]  and with the use and
[03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:53.100]  lacing alcohol
[03:36:53.100 --> 03:36:55.100]  aside of that, within that
[03:36:55.100 --> 03:36:57.100]  now Dylan
[03:36:57.100 --> 03:36:59.100]  Mulvaney, the representation of
[03:36:59.100 --> 03:37:01.100]  Lucifer and evil, in my
[03:37:01.100 --> 03:37:03.100]  opinion
[03:37:03.100 --> 03:37:05.100]  is the face of Bud
[03:37:05.100 --> 03:37:07.100]  Light in alcohol and also
[03:37:07.100 --> 03:37:09.100]  Nike
[03:37:09.100 --> 03:37:11.100]  he's sporting
[03:37:11.100 --> 03:37:13.100]  sports bras for women
[03:37:13.100 --> 03:37:15.100]  we'll get to that as well, but let me make this
[03:37:15.100 --> 03:37:17.100]  point about alcohol, okay?
[03:37:17.100 --> 03:37:19.100]  what do pedophiles and groomers
[03:37:19.100 --> 03:37:21.100]  always do to children?
[03:37:21.100 --> 03:37:23.100]  what do they do?
[03:37:23.100 --> 03:37:25.100]  number one, pedophiles and groomers
[03:37:25.100 --> 03:37:27.100]  you look at FBI profiles
[03:37:27.100 --> 03:37:29.100]  you look at everything, you listen to
[03:37:29.100 --> 03:37:31.100]  how they profile pedophiles and
[03:37:31.100 --> 03:37:33.100]  groomers, they always appear
[03:37:33.100 --> 03:37:35.100]  to be friendly
[03:37:35.100 --> 03:37:37.100]  they appear to be safe
[03:37:37.100 --> 03:37:39.100]  they appear to be a friend
[03:37:39.100 --> 03:37:41.100]  you don't like your parents?
[03:37:41.100 --> 03:37:43.100]  your parents are mean to you?
[03:37:43.100 --> 03:37:45.100]  nice to you little girl, you can tell me
[03:37:45.100 --> 03:37:47.100]  your problems, I'm a safe
[03:37:47.100 --> 03:37:49.100]  space for you, I'm
[03:37:49.100 --> 03:37:51.100]  someone you can come to for refuge
[03:37:51.100 --> 03:37:53.100]  cause I'm not someone that's gonna hurt you
[03:37:53.100 --> 03:37:55.100]  that's Dylan
[03:37:55.100 --> 03:37:57.100]  Mulvaney all over TikTok
[03:37:57.100 --> 03:37:59.100]  and then groomers
[03:37:59.100 --> 03:38:01.100]  and pedophiles and rapists and child
[03:38:01.100 --> 03:38:03.100]  molesters, they'll slowly
[03:38:03.100 --> 03:38:05.100]  introduce adult
[03:38:05.100 --> 03:38:07.100]  themes or adult practices
[03:38:07.100 --> 03:38:09.100]  slowly but surely
[03:38:09.100 --> 03:38:11.100]  into the mind of a child
[03:38:11.100 --> 03:38:13.100]  to get the child to believe that
[03:38:13.100 --> 03:38:15.100]  well this is a safe person already
[03:38:15.100 --> 03:38:17.100]  and if this person is
[03:38:17.100 --> 03:38:19.100]  safe, they're never gonna hurt
[03:38:19.100 --> 03:38:21.100]  or violate me, so if this
[03:38:21.100 --> 03:38:23.100]  person is offering me drugs
[03:38:23.100 --> 03:38:25.100]  if this person
[03:38:25.100 --> 03:38:27.100]  wants to touch my private
[03:38:27.100 --> 03:38:29.100]  parts, or if this person
[03:38:29.100 --> 03:38:31.100]  wants to offer me alcohol
[03:38:31.100 --> 03:38:33.100]  well, that's a cool
[03:38:33.100 --> 03:38:35.100]  adult, because my parents
[03:38:35.100 --> 03:38:37.100]  don't let me rebel
[03:38:37.100 --> 03:38:39.100]  culture and society doesn't let me rebel
[03:38:39.100 --> 03:38:41.100]  that's frowned upon
[03:38:41.100 --> 03:38:43.100]  but this adult is letting me
[03:38:43.100 --> 03:38:45.100]  drink, this adult is offering
[03:38:45.100 --> 03:38:47.100]  me drugs, this adult is
[03:38:47.100 --> 03:38:49.100]  letting me party and get away with things
[03:38:49.100 --> 03:38:51.100]  that are forbidden
[03:38:51.100 --> 03:38:53.100]  this adult is someone that is
[03:38:53.100 --> 03:38:55.100]  not only safe, but is
[03:38:55.100 --> 03:38:57.100]  someone that gives me license
[03:38:57.100 --> 03:38:59.100]  to just do whatever I want
[03:38:59.100 --> 03:39:01.100]  and their access to some adult
[03:39:01.100 --> 03:39:03.100]  things like alcohol and drugs
[03:39:03.100 --> 03:39:05.100]  it's like
[03:39:05.100 --> 03:39:07.100]  the big bad wolf dressed
[03:39:07.100 --> 03:39:09.100]  as a grandma
[03:39:09.100 --> 03:39:11.100]  to lure the little pigs in
[03:39:11.100 --> 03:39:13.100]  to literally eat them alive
[03:39:13.100 --> 03:39:15.100]  that is what Dylan Mulvaney
[03:39:15.100 --> 03:39:17.100]  is, and now that you
[03:39:17.100 --> 03:39:19.100]  have this mentally ill pervert
[03:39:19.100 --> 03:39:21.100]  the face of Bud Light, alcohol
[03:39:21.100 --> 03:39:23.100]  and the parent companies
[03:39:23.100 --> 03:39:25.100]  who is Dylan Mulvaney's target
[03:39:25.100 --> 03:39:27.100]  audience? Is it
[03:39:27.100 --> 03:39:29.100]  millennials? Is it
[03:39:29.100 --> 03:39:31.100]  Gen X? Is it boomers?
[03:39:31.100 --> 03:39:33.100]  Is it anyone over
[03:39:33.100 --> 03:39:35.100]  the age of 25?
[03:39:35.100 --> 03:39:37.100]  Dylan Mulvaney's target audience
[03:39:37.100 --> 03:39:39.100]  are children, ladies
[03:39:39.100 --> 03:39:41.100]  and gentlemen, so why would
[03:39:41.100 --> 03:39:43.100]  Dylan Mulvaney need to be the face
[03:39:43.100 --> 03:39:45.100]  of Bud Light or some kind of alcohol
[03:39:45.100 --> 03:39:47.100]  parent company?
[03:39:47.100 --> 03:39:49.100]  How is that correct
[03:39:49.100 --> 03:39:51.100]  marketing?
[03:39:51.100 --> 03:39:53.100]  Because if you know anything about marketing
[03:39:53.100 --> 03:39:55.100]  and if Alex is listening to me
[03:39:55.100 --> 03:39:57.100]  or anyone that has any knowledge of marketing
[03:39:57.100 --> 03:39:59.100]  knows exactly what I'm talking about
[03:39:59.100 --> 03:40:01.100]  one of the first questions
[03:40:01.100 --> 03:40:03.100]  that you ask yourself
[03:40:03.100 --> 03:40:05.100]  or whoever's trying to market you
[03:40:05.100 --> 03:40:07.100]  or an advertiser is
[03:40:07.100 --> 03:40:09.100]  what is your brand? Who is
[03:40:09.100 --> 03:40:11.100]  your target audience? What is
[03:40:11.100 --> 03:40:13.100]  the age target audience?
[03:40:13.100 --> 03:40:15.100]  So you could correctly
[03:40:15.100 --> 03:40:17.100]  pinpoint who you want to
[03:40:17.100 --> 03:40:19.100]  sell your products to. That is
[03:40:19.100 --> 03:40:21.100]  marketing 101, especially in the
[03:40:21.100 --> 03:40:23.100]  age of YouTube and social media
[03:40:23.100 --> 03:40:25.100]  and especially TikTok
[03:40:25.100 --> 03:40:27.100]  so I would propose, this is my opinion
[03:40:27.100 --> 03:40:29.100]  and my suspicion
[03:40:29.100 --> 03:40:31.100]  that this is how the New World
[03:40:31.100 --> 03:40:33.100]  Order functions, that these
[03:40:33.100 --> 03:40:35.100]  perverts, these sick
[03:40:35.100 --> 03:40:37.100]  disgusting depraved individuals
[03:40:37.100 --> 03:40:39.100]  that know
[03:40:39.100 --> 03:40:41.100]  who Dylan Mulvaney's target
[03:40:41.100 --> 03:40:43.100]  audience is are children
[03:40:43.100 --> 03:40:45.100]  little kids
[03:40:45.100 --> 03:40:47.100]  even minors that sit
[03:40:47.100 --> 03:40:49.100]  there and digest
[03:40:49.100 --> 03:40:51.100]  his content
[03:40:51.100 --> 03:40:53.100]  every single day getting indoctrinated
[03:40:53.100 --> 03:40:55.100]  and perverted in their minds
[03:40:55.100 --> 03:40:57.100]  these people know
[03:40:57.100 --> 03:40:59.100]  that their marketing and their
[03:40:59.100 --> 03:41:01.100]  targeting is going
[03:41:01.100 --> 03:41:03.100]  straight to minors
[03:41:03.100 --> 03:41:05.100]  to get this safe looking individual
[03:41:05.100 --> 03:41:07.100]  that's a friend, that's mentally
[03:41:07.100 --> 03:41:09.100]  ill just like you, that's
[03:41:09.100 --> 03:41:11.100]  lost your mind, that's totally depraved
[03:41:11.100 --> 03:41:13.100]  degenerate and perverted as well
[03:41:13.100 --> 03:41:15.100]  that your parents don't accept
[03:41:15.100 --> 03:41:17.100]  the big bad wolf dressed as a grandma
[03:41:17.100 --> 03:41:19.100]  come into the house, yes, Dylan
[03:41:19.100 --> 03:41:21.100]  Mulvaney will market to
[03:41:21.100 --> 03:41:23.100]  children alcohol
[03:41:23.100 --> 03:41:25.100]  you might ask yourself
[03:41:25.100 --> 03:41:27.100]  well, how deep
[03:41:27.100 --> 03:41:29.100]  is that really? It's extremely
[03:41:29.100 --> 03:41:31.100]  deep because Dylan
[03:41:31.100 --> 03:41:33.100]  Mulvaney represents a part of the culture
[03:41:33.100 --> 03:41:35.100]  right now
[03:41:35.100 --> 03:41:37.100]  that is attempting
[03:41:37.100 --> 03:41:39.100]  to normalize the
[03:41:39.100 --> 03:41:41.100]  mutilization of the genitals of kids
[03:41:41.100 --> 03:41:43.100]  and the grooming of children
[03:41:43.100 --> 03:41:45.100]  that is who Dylan Mulvaney
[03:41:45.100 --> 03:41:47.100]  in my opinion represents
[03:41:47.100 --> 03:41:49.100]  you tie in
[03:41:49.100 --> 03:41:51.100]  drugs, you tie in alcohol
[03:41:51.100 --> 03:41:53.100]  you tie in little
[03:41:53.100 --> 03:41:55.100]  kids getting lured
[03:41:55.100 --> 03:41:57.100]  into these things thinking they're
[03:41:57.100 --> 03:41:59.100]  safe? This is
[03:41:59.100 --> 03:42:01.100]  culture, ladies and gentlemen
[03:42:01.100 --> 03:42:03.100]  Drew, what are you talking about? What's the point here?
[03:42:03.100 --> 03:42:05.100]  This is how culture
[03:42:05.100 --> 03:42:07.100]  is made with corporations
[03:42:07.100 --> 03:42:09.100]  that coincide
[03:42:09.100 --> 03:42:11.100]  with mainstream figures
[03:42:11.100 --> 03:42:13.100]  to brand and market
[03:42:13.100 --> 03:42:15.100]  their products to the next
[03:42:15.100 --> 03:42:17.100]  generation to get them
[03:42:17.100 --> 03:42:19.100]  to live certain lifestyles
[03:42:19.100 --> 03:42:21.100]  to spend their money and live it
[03:42:21.100 --> 03:42:23.100]  at the same time
[03:42:23.100 --> 03:42:25.100]  these alcohol corporations
[03:42:25.100 --> 03:42:27.100]  Bud Light, parent companies
[03:42:27.100 --> 03:42:29.100]  know just exactly
[03:42:29.100 --> 03:42:31.100]  who Dylan Mulvaney's target
[03:42:31.100 --> 03:42:33.100]  audience is, it's little kids
[03:42:33.100 --> 03:42:35.100]  and they're setting a culture
[03:42:35.100 --> 03:42:37.100]  of grooming between
[03:42:37.100 --> 03:42:39.100]  mentally unstable grown adult
[03:42:39.100 --> 03:42:41.100]  perverts and little kids
[03:42:41.100 --> 03:42:43.100]  building a bridge
[03:42:43.100 --> 03:42:45.100]  together through alcohol
[03:42:45.100 --> 03:42:47.100]  and that is a cocktail of
[03:42:47.100 --> 03:42:49.100]  pedophilia and child
[03:42:49.100 --> 03:42:51.100]  molestation, ladies and gentlemen
[03:42:51.100 --> 03:42:53.100]  Hollywood 101
[03:42:53.100 --> 03:42:55.100]  New World Order fully operational
[03:42:55.100 --> 03:42:57.100]  we'll be right back
[03:42:57.100 --> 03:42:59.100]  If Alex Jones runs for
[03:42:59.100 --> 03:43:01.100]  president in the republican party
[03:43:01.100 --> 03:43:03.100]  he has a chance
[03:43:03.100 --> 03:43:05.100]  of winning
[03:43:07.100 --> 03:43:09.100]  If you just tuned in you may be noticing I'm wearing
[03:43:09.100 --> 03:43:11.100]  an Alex Jones for president
[03:43:11.100 --> 03:43:13.100]  2024 shirt
[03:43:13.100 --> 03:43:15.100]  I am not seriously planning to run for president
[03:43:15.100 --> 03:43:17.100]  this is an idea the crew had
[03:43:17.100 --> 03:43:19.100]  have a triggering shirt kind of next
[03:43:19.100 --> 03:43:21.100]  level Alex Jones was right
[03:43:21.100 --> 03:43:23.100]  there's Infowars.com in the back
[03:43:23.100 --> 03:43:25.100]  Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front
[03:43:25.100 --> 03:43:27.100]  it's a fundraiser shirt, it's made out of really nice
[03:43:27.100 --> 03:43:29.100]  fabric, it's high quality
[03:43:29.100 --> 03:43:31.100]  and it is an exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com
[03:43:31.100 --> 03:43:33.100]  and when the shirts are gone
[03:43:33.100 --> 03:43:35.100]  they're gone, we're doing one run
[03:43:35.100 --> 03:43:37.100]  of Alex Jones for president
[03:43:37.100 --> 03:43:39.100]  2024 shirts
[03:43:39.100 --> 03:43:41.100]  and we'll have a historic
[03:43:41.100 --> 03:43:43.100]  memento, be able to spread the word
[03:43:43.100 --> 03:43:45.100]  meet a lot of like minded people
[03:43:45.100 --> 03:43:47.100]  and you'll be able to keep us on the air
[03:43:47.100 --> 03:43:49.100]  no way, no way, that's a bridge too far
[03:43:49.100 --> 03:43:51.100]  that's no, it can't be
[03:43:51.100 --> 03:43:53.100]  and I said on national television that he was going to win
[03:43:53.100 --> 03:43:55.100]  at Infowarsstore.com
[03:44:17.100 --> 03:44:19.100]  cannot be appeased
[03:44:19.100 --> 03:44:21.100]  they must be opposed
[03:44:21.100 --> 03:44:23.100]  autocrats only understand
[03:44:23.100 --> 03:44:25.100]  one word, no
[03:44:25.100 --> 03:44:27.100]  no, no
[03:44:27.100 --> 03:44:29.100]  exactly, and that's why we say
[03:44:29.100 --> 03:44:31.100]  no to your vaccines
[03:44:31.100 --> 03:44:33.100]  we say no
[03:44:33.100 --> 03:44:35.100]  to you shutting down our businesses
[03:44:35.100 --> 03:44:37.100]  we say no to you taking our firearms
[03:44:37.100 --> 03:44:39.100]  we say no to you censoring
[03:44:39.100 --> 03:44:41.100]  our free speech, we say no to you
[03:44:41.100 --> 03:44:43.100]  selling us out to the World Health Organization
[03:44:43.100 --> 03:44:45.100]  we say no to you getting us
[03:44:45.100 --> 03:44:47.100]  into World War 3, you're right
[03:44:47.100 --> 03:44:49.100]  we stand against autocrats like you
[03:44:49.100 --> 03:44:51.100]  Joe Biden, and we say no
[03:44:51.100 --> 03:44:53.100]  and we say no to your war
[03:44:57.100 --> 03:44:59.100]  the most banned man in America

[03:45:07.100 --> 03:45:09.100]  was right
[03:45:09.100 --> 03:45:11.100]  Alex is right about far more
[03:45:11.100 --> 03:45:13.100]  than is wrong
[03:45:13.100 --> 03:45:15.100]  he has secured over a decade
[03:45:15.100 --> 03:45:17.100]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it
[03:45:17.100 --> 03:45:19.100]  flip it up or rub it down
[03:45:19.100 --> 03:45:21.100]  Alex Jones was right
[03:45:21.100 --> 03:45:23.100]  think about how frustrated we are
[03:45:23.100 --> 03:45:25.100]  if you've been awake for a year or two
[03:45:25.100 --> 03:45:27.100]  imagine being like an Alex Jones
[03:45:27.100 --> 03:45:29.100]  or those guys who've been awake for like decades
[03:45:29.100 --> 03:45:31.100]  Alex Jones called this years ago
[03:45:31.100 --> 03:45:33.100]  years ago
[03:45:33.100 --> 03:45:35.100]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax
[03:45:35.100 --> 03:45:37.100]  not for a second
[03:45:37.100 --> 03:45:39.100]  you are one of the great thinkers of this
[03:45:39.100 --> 03:45:41.100]  you are a martyr
[03:45:41.100 --> 03:45:43.100]  the government fears
[03:45:43.100 --> 03:45:45.100]  Alex Jones
[03:45:45.100 --> 03:45:47.100]  that's why the globalists hate me
[03:45:47.100 --> 03:45:49.100]  is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny
[03:45:59.100 --> 03:46:01.100]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life

[03:47:11.100 --> 03:47:13.100]  out of control
[03:47:13.100 --> 03:47:15.100]  the Skittle people are running around
[03:47:15.100 --> 03:47:17.100]  with their trans erections
[03:47:17.100 --> 03:47:19.100]  trans erections as well
[03:47:19.100 --> 03:47:21.100]  I mean that's true man
[03:47:21.100 --> 03:47:23.100]  these people are just
[03:47:23.100 --> 03:47:25.100]  hyper-sexualized
[03:47:25.100 --> 03:47:27.100]  they love children
[03:47:27.100 --> 03:47:29.100]  they want to chop their genitals up
[03:47:29.100 --> 03:47:31.100]  they think grooming is totally nuts
[03:47:31.100 --> 03:47:33.100]  they think they're going to have sex
[03:47:33.100 --> 03:47:35.100]  they think they're going to have sex
[03:47:35.100 --> 03:47:37.100]  they want to chop their genitals up
[03:47:37.100 --> 03:47:39.100]  they think grooming is totally normal
[03:47:39.100 --> 03:47:41.100]  the point where they murder
[03:47:41.100 --> 03:47:43.100]  three little Christian babies
[03:47:43.100 --> 03:47:45.100]  at a Christian school
[03:47:45.100 --> 03:47:47.100]  and three Christian adults
[03:47:47.100 --> 03:47:49.100]  because they believe the lies and propaganda
[03:47:49.100 --> 03:47:51.100]  that they're facing some kind of
[03:47:51.100 --> 03:47:53.100]  genocide
[03:47:53.100 --> 03:47:55.100]  that they're going to be eradicated from humanity
[03:47:55.100 --> 03:47:57.100]  you know, why are the Skittle people
[03:47:57.100 --> 03:47:59.100]  running around
[03:47:59.100 --> 03:48:01.100]  performing trans erections
[03:48:01.100 --> 03:48:03.100]  excuse me, trans insurrections
[03:48:03.100 --> 03:48:05.100]  because society
[03:48:05.100 --> 03:48:07.100]  is totally cucked out and allowed these people
[03:48:07.100 --> 03:48:09.100]  to get to this point
[03:48:09.100 --> 03:48:11.100]  it's like a bad kid dude
[03:48:11.100 --> 03:48:13.100]  you spare the rod
[03:48:13.100 --> 03:48:15.100]  on the child, you destroy the child
[03:48:15.100 --> 03:48:17.100]  and the child ends up hating you
[03:48:17.100 --> 03:48:19.100]  when you let a society
[03:48:19.100 --> 03:48:21.100]  okay, get out of control
[03:48:21.100 --> 03:48:23.100]  and you're afraid to tell them no
[03:48:23.100 --> 03:48:25.100]  because you don't want to hurt their feelings
[03:48:25.100 --> 03:48:27.100]  you don't want to cause them to hate you
[03:48:27.100 --> 03:48:29.100]  and you want to be the cool dad
[03:48:29.100 --> 03:48:31.100]  you want to be the cool mom
[03:48:31.100 --> 03:48:33.100]  it actually has the
[03:48:33.100 --> 03:48:35.100]  opposite effect
[03:48:35.100 --> 03:48:37.100]  because if there are no moral
[03:48:37.100 --> 03:48:39.100]  boundaries within a culture
[03:48:39.100 --> 03:48:41.100]  then you get
[03:48:41.100 --> 03:48:43.100]  total moral
[03:48:43.100 --> 03:48:45.100]  anarchy dude, you get
[03:48:45.100 --> 03:48:47.100]  homosexual anarchy
[03:48:47.100 --> 03:48:49.100]  you get, you know, just
[03:48:49.100 --> 03:48:51.100]  absolute fornicating
[03:48:51.100 --> 03:48:53.100]  out in the open, you get
[03:48:53.100 --> 03:48:55.100]  Sodom and Gomorrah ladies and gentlemen
[03:48:55.100 --> 03:48:57.100]  you get Sodom and Gomorrah
[03:48:57.100 --> 03:48:59.100]  especially with all the trans erections
[03:48:59.100 --> 03:49:01.100]  going on
[03:49:01.100 --> 03:49:03.100]  insurrections going on
[03:49:03.100 --> 03:49:05.100]  you know it's state capitals
[03:49:05.100 --> 03:49:07.100]  they're just storming the building
[03:49:07.100 --> 03:49:09.100]  and it's, you know, according to the mainstream media
[03:49:09.100 --> 03:49:11.100]  it's not the worst thing since 9-11
[03:49:11.100 --> 03:49:13.100]  it's not the worst thing since Pearl Harbor
[03:49:13.100 --> 03:49:15.100]  only when the mega republicans
[03:49:15.100 --> 03:49:17.100]  do something like that
[03:49:17.100 --> 03:49:19.100]  but it's because society has gotten to this point
[03:49:19.100 --> 03:49:21.100]  where they just allow it
[03:49:21.100 --> 03:49:23.100]  and you're not allowed to call it out
[03:49:23.100 --> 03:49:25.100]  because if you do, you get cancelled
[03:49:25.100 --> 03:49:27.100]  and you're filled with hate
[03:49:27.100 --> 03:49:29.100]  you're filled with hate, you're a hate filled person
[03:49:29.100 --> 03:49:31.100]  because you're telling the truth
[03:49:31.100 --> 03:49:33.100]  no, no
[03:49:33.100 --> 03:49:35.100]  I'm a Christian, alright
[03:49:35.100 --> 03:49:37.100]  and the proverbs make it very clear
[03:49:37.100 --> 03:49:39.100]  alright
[03:49:39.100 --> 03:49:41.100]  open rebuke
[03:49:41.100 --> 03:49:43.100]  is better than concealed love
[03:49:43.100 --> 03:49:45.100]  what that means is
[03:49:45.100 --> 03:49:47.100]  if you openly, with love
[03:49:47.100 --> 03:49:49.100]  speak the truth
[03:49:49.100 --> 03:49:51.100]  to someone living in error
[03:49:51.100 --> 03:49:53.100]  that means more
[03:49:53.100 --> 03:49:55.100]  and is more valuable and honorable
[03:49:55.100 --> 03:49:57.100]  in God's eyes
[03:49:57.100 --> 03:49:59.100]  than concealing the truth
[03:49:59.100 --> 03:50:01.100]  about who they are and their lifestyle
[03:50:01.100 --> 03:50:03.100]  out of cowardice
[03:50:03.100 --> 03:50:05.100]  fear, political correctness
[03:50:05.100 --> 03:50:07.100]  even a
[03:50:07.100 --> 03:50:09.100]  some kind of
[03:50:09.100 --> 03:50:11.100]  virtue signaling morality
[03:50:11.100 --> 03:50:13.100]  where I don't want to judge people
[03:50:13.100 --> 03:50:15.100]  so I'm not going to tell the truth
[03:50:15.100 --> 03:50:17.100]  to their face
[03:50:17.100 --> 03:50:19.100]  that's not how God rolls
[03:50:19.100 --> 03:50:21.100]  and I'm thankful that's not how God rolls
[03:50:21.100 --> 03:50:23.100]  because if that's how God rolled
[03:50:23.100 --> 03:50:25.100]  I would never have told me the truth
[03:50:25.100 --> 03:50:27.100]  and I would have never been saved by the blood of Christ
[03:50:27.100 --> 03:50:29.100]  God didn't try and pamper me
[03:50:29.100 --> 03:50:31.100]  and beat around the bush
[03:50:31.100 --> 03:50:33.100]  no, God was straight up
[03:50:33.100 --> 03:50:35.100]  this is who you are
[03:50:35.100 --> 03:50:37.100]  you're living in total arrogance
[03:50:37.100 --> 03:50:39.100]  you need to repent and come to my son Jesus Christ
[03:50:39.100 --> 03:50:41.100]  immediately
[03:50:41.100 --> 03:50:43.100]  because of what he's done on the cross
[03:50:43.100 --> 03:50:45.100]  repent, repent, or you know where you're going
[03:50:47.100 --> 03:50:49.100]  it worked for me, man
[03:50:49.100 --> 03:50:51.100]  and I'm thankful God didn't try
[03:50:51.100 --> 03:50:53.100]  God is love, God communicates his love
[03:50:53.100 --> 03:50:55.100]  and his mercy and his grace
[03:50:55.100 --> 03:50:57.100]  but at the same time
[03:50:57.100 --> 03:50:59.100]  that does not mean that God beats around
[03:50:59.100 --> 03:51:01.100]  the bush and refrains from
[03:51:01.100 --> 03:51:03.100]  telling the truth to an individual
[03:51:03.100 --> 03:51:05.100]  in error that is literally
[03:51:05.100 --> 03:51:07.100]  on a highway to hell
[03:51:07.100 --> 03:51:09.100]  the broad way
[03:51:09.100 --> 03:51:11.100]  about to fly off
[03:51:11.100 --> 03:51:13.100]  a cliff and plunge into
[03:51:13.100 --> 03:51:15.100]  eternal damnation
[03:51:15.100 --> 03:51:17.100]  no, God is fully
[03:51:17.100 --> 03:51:19.100]  fully willing
[03:51:19.100 --> 03:51:21.100]  to hurt your human feelings
[03:51:21.100 --> 03:51:23.100]  and pride, at the end of the day, that's what it is
[03:51:23.100 --> 03:51:25.100]  getting your pride hurt
[03:51:25.100 --> 03:51:27.100]  that's what humility is
[03:51:27.100 --> 03:51:29.100]  ladies and gentlemen
[03:51:29.100 --> 03:51:31.100]  people getting their pride hurt
[03:51:31.100 --> 03:51:33.100]  that's what the gospel does
[03:51:33.100 --> 03:51:35.100]  it not only hurts your pride
[03:51:35.100 --> 03:51:37.100]  it shatters
[03:51:37.100 --> 03:51:39.100]  and obliterates
[03:51:39.100 --> 03:51:41.100]  destroys
[03:51:41.100 --> 03:51:43.100]  sanitizes
[03:51:43.100 --> 03:51:45.100]  pride
[03:51:45.100 --> 03:51:47.100]  why?
[03:51:47.100 --> 03:51:49.100]  because one cannot be born again
[03:51:49.100 --> 03:51:51.100]  unless they submit which requires
[03:51:51.100 --> 03:51:53.100]  humility and pride being
[03:51:53.100 --> 03:51:55.100]  destroyed in the human heart
[03:51:55.100 --> 03:51:57.100]  and that's the epitome of
[03:51:57.100 --> 03:51:59.100]  what movement today?
[03:51:59.100 --> 03:52:01.100]  the pride movement
[03:52:01.100 --> 03:52:03.100]  you see how this all is
[03:52:03.100 --> 03:52:05.100]  interconnected
[03:52:05.100 --> 03:52:07.100]  and it's weaved together
[03:52:07.100 --> 03:52:09.100]  it's all spiritual, we wrestle
[03:52:09.100 --> 03:52:11.100]  not against flesh and blood
[03:52:11.100 --> 03:52:13.100]  but against powers, principalities, powers
[03:52:13.100 --> 03:52:15.100]  spiritual hosts of wickedness
[03:52:15.100 --> 03:52:17.100]  in the heavenly places
[03:52:17.100 --> 03:52:19.100]  right?
[03:52:19.100 --> 03:52:21.100]  and they establish
[03:52:21.100 --> 03:52:23.100]  they establish these
[03:52:23.100 --> 03:52:25.100]  human machines
[03:52:25.100 --> 03:52:27.100]  these organizations, these entities
[03:52:29.100 --> 03:52:31.100]  they camouflage with the culture
[03:52:31.100 --> 03:52:33.100]  but I'll tell you right now
[03:52:33.100 --> 03:52:35.100]  people like Dylan Mulvaney is in a total
[03:52:35.100 --> 03:52:37.100]  assault on God
[03:52:37.100 --> 03:52:39.100]  and those made in the image of God
[03:52:39.100 --> 03:52:41.100]  you want to know why?
[03:52:41.100 --> 03:52:43.100]  we are made in God's image
[03:52:43.100 --> 03:52:45.100]  God made man
[03:52:45.100 --> 03:52:47.100]  He created Adam
[03:52:47.100 --> 03:52:49.100]  made in His image
[03:52:49.100 --> 03:52:51.100]  biological male
[03:52:51.100 --> 03:52:53.100]  and out of man came who?
[03:52:53.100 --> 03:52:55.100]  Eve
[03:52:55.100 --> 03:52:57.100]  female
[03:52:57.100 --> 03:52:59.100]  we are made and engineered
[03:52:59.100 --> 03:53:01.100]  for a specific reason by God
[03:53:01.100 --> 03:53:03.100]  biological procreation
[03:53:03.100 --> 03:53:05.100]  that can only succeed
[03:53:05.100 --> 03:53:07.100]  biological male, biological female
[03:53:07.100 --> 03:53:09.100]  because that has God
[03:53:09.100 --> 03:53:11.100]  that is how God has instituted
[03:53:11.100 --> 03:53:13.100]  engineered and established it
[03:53:13.100 --> 03:53:15.100]  from the beginning
[03:53:15.100 --> 03:53:17.100]  from the beginning
[03:53:17.100 --> 03:53:19.100]  you call yourself a Christian
[03:53:19.100 --> 03:53:21.100]  you go to the scriptures
[03:53:21.100 --> 03:53:23.100]  what does God say?
[03:53:23.100 --> 03:53:25.100]  is the trans movement
[03:53:25.100 --> 03:53:27.100]  the so called trans movement
[03:53:27.100 --> 03:53:29.100]  compatible with
[03:53:29.100 --> 03:53:31.100]  God's word?
[03:53:31.100 --> 03:53:33.100]  I can't dictate this
[03:53:33.100 --> 03:53:35.100]  this is not my opinion
[03:53:35.100 --> 03:53:37.100]  I cannot rewrite how God
[03:53:37.100 --> 03:53:39.100]  has engineered the universe
[03:53:39.100 --> 03:53:41.100]  and how humanity
[03:53:41.100 --> 03:53:43.100]  is meant to function
[03:53:43.100 --> 03:53:45.100]  which by the way in Romans chapter 1
[03:53:45.100 --> 03:53:47.100]  when you start to go against God's design
[03:53:47.100 --> 03:53:49.100]  when you go out of the boundaries
[03:53:49.100 --> 03:53:51.100]  when it's biological
[03:53:51.100 --> 03:53:53.100]  male on male
[03:53:53.100 --> 03:53:55.100]  sex or biological female
[03:53:55.100 --> 03:53:57.100]  on female sex
[03:53:57.100 --> 03:53:59.100]  God gives that society
[03:53:59.100 --> 03:54:01.100]  over that accepts that
[03:54:01.100 --> 03:54:03.100]  to a depraved and reprobate mind
[03:54:03.100 --> 03:54:05.100]  that means society
[03:54:05.100 --> 03:54:07.100]  loses its mind entirely
[03:54:07.100 --> 03:54:09.100]  and look where we are today
[03:54:09.100 --> 03:54:11.100]  connect the dots
[03:54:11.100 --> 03:54:13.100]  guys this is not my word
[03:54:13.100 --> 03:54:15.100]  this is God's word
[03:54:15.100 --> 03:54:17.100]  go read Romans chapter 1
[03:54:17.100 --> 03:54:19.100]  go read Genesis chapter 1
[03:54:19.100 --> 03:54:21.100]  through chapter 6 the origins
[03:54:21.100 --> 03:54:23.100]  the way that God instituted things
[03:54:23.100 --> 03:54:25.100]  and pay attention to the stories
[03:54:25.100 --> 03:54:27.100]  of Sodom and Gomorrah and the reason
[03:54:27.100 --> 03:54:29.100]  why God flooded planet earth
[03:54:29.100 --> 03:54:31.100]  and it sounds pretty familiar
[03:54:31.100 --> 03:54:33.100]  to the days we are living in right now
[03:54:33.100 --> 03:54:35.100]  what did Christ say
[03:54:35.100 --> 03:54:37.100]  John is all of it discourse in Matthew chapter 24
[03:54:37.100 --> 03:54:39.100]  as the
[03:54:39.100 --> 03:54:41.100]  days of Noah
[03:54:41.100 --> 03:54:43.100]  that's what it's going to be
[03:54:43.100 --> 03:54:45.100]  like in the last days
[03:54:45.100 --> 03:54:47.100]  before the second coming of Christ
[03:54:47.100 --> 03:54:49.100]  that's what Jesus said
[03:54:49.100 --> 03:54:51.100]  one of the identifying factors
[03:54:51.100 --> 03:54:53.100]  that you are living
[03:54:53.100 --> 03:54:55.100]  in the final scene
[03:54:55.100 --> 03:54:57.100]  you're living in the final act
[03:54:57.100 --> 03:54:59.100]  of humanity you and I are living
[03:54:59.100 --> 03:55:01.100]  this thing man we're in it
[03:55:01.100 --> 03:55:03.100]  this isn't a Star Wars movie
[03:55:03.100 --> 03:55:05.100]  this isn't an Indiana Jones movie
[03:55:05.100 --> 03:55:07.100]  this isn't your favorite movie
[03:55:07.100 --> 03:55:09.100]  where the final act is on
[03:55:09.100 --> 03:55:11.100]  and you're at the edge of your seat
[03:55:11.100 --> 03:55:13.100]  you're watching what's going to happen
[03:55:13.100 --> 03:55:15.100]  you are living the greatest
[03:55:15.100 --> 03:55:17.100]  story ever told
[03:55:17.100 --> 03:55:19.100]  and God makes it
[03:55:19.100 --> 03:55:21.100]  very clear
[03:55:21.100 --> 03:55:23.100]  in his word
[03:55:23.100 --> 03:55:25.100]  and what did Christ say
[03:55:25.100 --> 03:55:27.100]  how would the culture be
[03:55:27.100 --> 03:55:29.100]  how would the world be functioning
[03:55:29.100 --> 03:55:31.100]  in the final act of humanity
[03:55:31.100 --> 03:55:33.100]  before the rapture and the second coming of Christ
[03:55:33.100 --> 03:55:35.100]  and the advent of the Antichrist
[03:55:35.100 --> 03:55:37.100]  as well that the world
[03:55:37.100 --> 03:55:39.100]  would be as in the days
[03:55:39.100 --> 03:55:41.100]  of Noah
[03:55:41.100 --> 03:55:43.100]  what were the days of Noah
[03:55:43.100 --> 03:55:45.100]  ladies and gentlemen homosexuals
[03:55:45.100 --> 03:55:47.100]  dominating to the point of showing up
[03:55:47.100 --> 03:55:49.100]  when angels show up to meet
[03:55:49.100 --> 03:55:51.100]  with a human they come knocking on the door
[03:55:51.100 --> 03:55:53.100]  let us in let us break
[03:55:53.100 --> 03:55:55.100]  down this door so we can know that guy in there
[03:55:55.100 --> 03:55:57.100]  break down the door we want that guy
[03:55:57.100 --> 03:55:59.100]  right now break down
[03:55:59.100 --> 03:56:01.100]  these doors we're going to push our way into you
[03:56:01.100 --> 03:56:03.100]  sound familiar?
[03:56:03.100 --> 03:56:05.100]  sound kind of like the trans-erections
[03:56:05.100 --> 03:56:07.100]  the trans-erections
[03:56:07.100 --> 03:56:09.100]  alright
[03:56:09.100 --> 03:56:11.100]  guys I'm just quoting God's word
[03:56:11.100 --> 03:56:13.100]  and I'm matching
[03:56:13.100 --> 03:56:15.100]  it to the reality that I live in right now
[03:56:15.100 --> 03:56:17.100]  because God's word is reality
[03:56:17.100 --> 03:56:19.100]  okay God's word
[03:56:19.100 --> 03:56:21.100]  is reality
[03:56:21.100 --> 03:56:23.100]  because God has created the universe
[03:56:23.100 --> 03:56:25.100]  he's created the reality we live in right now
[03:56:25.100 --> 03:56:27.100]  he's created the multiple
[03:56:27.100 --> 03:56:29.100]  multiple dimensions
[03:56:29.100 --> 03:56:31.100]  that we are
[03:56:31.100 --> 03:56:33.100]  all experiencing here on planet earth
[03:56:33.100 --> 03:56:35.100]  and beyond
[03:56:35.100 --> 03:56:37.100]  the question
[03:56:37.100 --> 03:56:39.100]  is are we
[03:56:39.100 --> 03:56:41.100]  going to side with God
[03:56:41.100 --> 03:56:43.100]  this is the real question ladies and gentlemen
[03:56:43.100 --> 03:56:45.100]  the real question is you got to make
[03:56:45.100 --> 03:56:47.100]  you got to pick a side
[03:56:47.100 --> 03:56:49.100]  because Christ said you're either for me
[03:56:49.100 --> 03:56:51.100]  or you're against me
[03:56:51.100 --> 03:56:53.100]  you're neither hot nor you're cold
[03:56:53.100 --> 03:56:55.100]  you're lukewarm so I spit you out of my mouth
[03:56:55.100 --> 03:56:57.100]  you're either in line with Christ
[03:56:57.100 --> 03:56:59.100]  doesn't mean you're perfect
[03:56:59.100 --> 03:57:01.100]  but you do agree
[03:57:01.100 --> 03:57:03.100]  Christ said he was questioned
[03:57:03.100 --> 03:57:05.100]  you know how does one know
[03:57:05.100 --> 03:57:07.100]  that they love me
[03:57:07.100 --> 03:57:09.100]  how do I know that someone truly
[03:57:09.100 --> 03:57:11.100]  loves me in the old testament Christ said
[03:57:11.100 --> 03:57:13.100]  the one who truly loves me
[03:57:13.100 --> 03:57:15.100]  is the one who listens to my word
[03:57:15.100 --> 03:57:17.100]  and obeys it
[03:57:17.100 --> 03:57:19.100]  that simple
[03:57:19.100 --> 03:57:21.100]  you cannot love someone if there's no trust
[03:57:21.100 --> 03:57:23.100]  or obedience
[03:57:23.100 --> 03:57:25.100]  because if you do not have any of those things
[03:57:25.100 --> 03:57:27.100]  you don't love them
[03:57:27.100 --> 03:57:29.100]  that's a relationship of fear
[03:57:29.100 --> 03:57:31.100]  and we are to fear the Lord
[03:57:31.100 --> 03:57:33.100]  but not in that way
[03:57:33.100 --> 03:57:35.100]  but to fear him and revere him
[03:57:35.100 --> 03:57:37.100]  as our ultimate protector therefore
[03:57:37.100 --> 03:57:39.100]  we trust everything he says and we submit to it
[03:57:39.100 --> 03:57:41.100]  because he knows best better than we can ever
[03:57:41.100 --> 03:57:43.100]  know for ourselves especially for humanity
[03:57:43.100 --> 03:57:45.100]  that's fallen we'll be right back
[03:57:47.100 --> 03:57:49.100]  I intend to take
[03:57:49.100 --> 03:57:51.100]  the Infowars
[03:57:51.100 --> 03:57:53.100]  armored truck out
[03:57:53.100 --> 03:57:55.100]  or the Infowars tank as it's so lovingly called
[03:57:55.100 --> 03:57:57.100]  you came through yesterday
[03:57:57.100 --> 03:57:59.100]  and shopped at Infowarsstore.com
[03:57:59.100 --> 03:58:01.100]  so I'm going to be able to take the truck out
[03:58:21.100 --> 03:58:23.100]  so I'm going to be able to take the truck out
[03:58:23.100 --> 03:58:25.100]  so I'm going to be able to take the truck out
[03:58:25.100 --> 03:58:27.100]  so I'm going to be able to take the truck out
[03:58:55.100 --> 03:58:57.100]  so I'm going to be able to take the truck out
[03:59:25.100 --> 03:59:27.100]  because Alex's whole mentality was
[03:59:27.100 --> 03:59:29.100]  go where the story is
[03:59:29.100 --> 03:59:31.100]  go where the mainstream media refuses to
[03:59:31.100 --> 03:59:33.100]  so it's not that I'm addicted
[03:59:33.100 --> 03:59:35.100]  through the insanity I'm just addicted to
[03:59:35.100 --> 03:59:37.100]  telling the truth and helping the American people
[03:59:37.100 --> 03:59:39.100]  and I really do credit Alex
[03:59:39.100 --> 03:59:41.100]  for really instilling that within me
[03:59:41.100 --> 03:59:43.100]  early on in my career
[03:59:55.100 --> 03:59:57.100]  you
