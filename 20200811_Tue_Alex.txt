[00:00.000 --> 00:14.640]  We always have information overload here, but today is particularly incredible.
[00:14.640 --> 00:22.720]  The COVID-19 total lockdown, permanent mass, forced inoculation, paradigm is here and every
[00:22.720 --> 00:24.720]  facet of it is a verifiable fraud.
[00:24.720 --> 00:30.040]  We've discovered two giant lies that destroy the entire myth that no one is even reporting
[00:30.040 --> 00:36.520]  on and on top of it our report that was posted at Gregory's channel on YouTube was censored
[00:36.520 --> 00:40.640]  they said by the United Nations.
[00:40.640 --> 00:49.720]  So now as Congress sits on their ass, our country itself is under UN control.
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.560]  People are seeing their foot soldiers, which the Chinese used, Mao used to instill fear
[00:54.560 --> 00:59.240]  and make everyone know in China that not a single person was above the law.
[00:59.240 --> 01:04.200]  To attack institutions you thought were untouchable, whether it was the founders and then it got
[01:04.200 --> 01:05.200]  to the saints.
[01:05.200 --> 01:10.040]  It starts off with tearing down Catholic saint statues and desecrating churches, but before
[01:10.040 --> 01:14.200]  you know it, places like the Washington Post are attacking my neighborhood priest, Monsignor
[01:14.200 --> 01:19.320]  Pope and we're talking in LA with Garcetti, they're going to turn off the power.
[01:19.320 --> 01:22.800]  They're saying they're going to go after parties, they're going to go after churches
[01:22.800 --> 01:26.680]  and places that refuse to shut down, places like Harvest Rock that are suing the state
[01:26.680 --> 01:30.160]  of California and saying that they have a right to gather, a First Amendment right to
[01:30.160 --> 01:33.040]  gather just like the protestors do.
[01:33.040 --> 01:36.400]  It's a double standard completely, it's a new system.
[01:36.400 --> 01:42.080]  Portland's army of black block morons has continued its war on its enemy in the nation's
[01:42.080 --> 01:43.080]  elderly.
[01:43.080 --> 01:48.320]  One woman stood in front of the mob and ordered them to stop trying to destroy the southeast
[01:48.320 --> 01:49.680]  Portland precinct.
[01:49.680 --> 01:59.840]  After being smothered in paint, she continued to stand her ground.
[01:59.840 --> 02:04.760]  While another woman with a walker eventually extinguished a fire started by the mob in
[02:04.760 --> 02:07.760]  a trash can.
[02:07.760 --> 02:13.160]  The group, organized by the Youth Liberation Front, reportedly came equipped with ties
[02:13.160 --> 02:17.120]  made out of rebar meant to pop police vehicle tires.
[02:17.120 --> 02:21.760]  All of the ties were thrown into the street and police vehicles ran them over, causing
[02:21.760 --> 02:33.000]  damage to tires according to Portland police.
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.120]  And as Antifa cells move into neighborhoods and target the elderly as they did, Andy knows
[02:38.120 --> 02:47.320]  elderly parents and a woman they dubbed the Nazi lady.
[02:47.320 --> 02:52.800]  It is slowly dawning on at least some of these sorrows tools that what awaits them after
[02:52.800 --> 02:58.880]  being bailed out by seditious lawyers isn't a communist utopia, instead it's at least
[02:58.880 --> 03:17.280]  a five-year prison sentence or a severe beating by the locals.
[03:17.280 --> 03:36.680]  It's going bad, the Antifa guys are being chased like crazy, told you Kaipa hate the
[03:36.680 --> 03:37.680]  place to be.
[03:37.680 --> 03:47.200]  Those are Antifa guys running, Antifa guys are getting kicked out of them.
[03:47.200 --> 03:52.400]  Rico Agard Berry, who was released without bail after hurling an explosive device at
[03:52.400 --> 03:58.040]  the federal courthouse in Portland, was identified by his own President Trump supporting grandma.
[03:58.040 --> 04:03.880]  Berry Hill is charged with felony arson and faces a minimum of five years in prison if
[04:03.880 --> 04:04.880]  convicted.
[04:04.880 --> 04:10.360]  The 11-year-old Isaiah Mazza faces 30 years in prison, Mazza was seen lighting a fuse
[04:10.360 --> 04:15.840]  on a cylindrical object and throwing it inside the courthouse through the broken window, authorities
[04:15.840 --> 04:16.840]  say.
[04:16.840 --> 04:22.240]  The object exploded near federal agents exiting the building and injured both legs of a deputy
[04:22.240 --> 04:23.440]  U.S. Marshal.
[04:23.440 --> 04:29.840]  At least 250 black block communist loving idiots have been arrested nationwide.
[04:29.840 --> 04:35.720]  Some will spend a decade in prison while others will be free to come back for more stupidity,
[04:35.720 --> 04:49.960]  John Bowne reporting.
[04:49.960 --> 04:55.400]  The news and information I have in front of me is so powerful, so important that I'm
[04:55.400 --> 04:59.240]  actually having an anxiety attack.
[04:59.240 --> 05:07.800]  It's finally here, introducing the new survival shield X2 spray, available now for 33% off
[05:07.800 --> 05:11.720]  at InfowarsStore.com.

[06:12.800 --> 06:17.480]  It's Tuesday, August 11th.
[06:17.480 --> 06:25.960]  The year is 2020, 83 days out from the election, and now every major establishment talking
[06:25.960 --> 06:31.920]  head media outlet bought and paid for by the Chai comms and the globalists is telling us
[06:31.920 --> 06:37.600]  that President Trump is a dictator that's illegitimate, that must be driven from office,
[06:37.600 --> 06:45.200]  and that all communications with any populist American organizations must be shut down.
[06:45.200 --> 06:52.800]  They are now officially announcing a plan that when Joe Biden loses in a landslide despite
[06:52.800 --> 06:59.640]  their election fraud, that they are going to have every blue state secede and have their
[06:59.640 --> 07:04.640]  own inauguration saying that he is indeed the president and completely dividing this
[07:04.640 --> 07:06.160]  country.
[07:06.160 --> 07:10.920]  This is how foreign enemies can take down the United States, not with an outward military
[07:10.920 --> 07:15.360]  attack, but with a collapse from within.
[07:15.360 --> 07:20.200]  And that is our top story continuing, we'll be covering it coming up in the second hour.
[07:20.200 --> 07:22.640]  We have a whistleblower from Facebook joining us.
[07:22.640 --> 07:27.400]  Also Roger Stone has had Bill Gates come out and respond to him, and Roger pointed out
[07:27.400 --> 07:29.840]  that the vaccine's untested and dangerous.
[07:29.840 --> 07:34.280]  He'll be joining us, talk about that, and the latest on the campaign season, it's now
[07:34.280 --> 07:40.360]  the Civil War season, and Laura Loomer in all the polls, way ahead, set to win the primary.
[07:40.360 --> 07:45.520]  Many polls, way ahead, the Democrat challengers, well, now the telephone company isn't letting
[07:45.520 --> 07:49.360]  her call people or send text messages.
[07:49.360 --> 07:54.440]  So big text now moved into big telecoms with election meddling.
[07:54.440 --> 07:56.440]  This is true warfare.
[07:56.440 --> 08:02.600]  Okay, we told you COVID-19 would be permanent, a permanent lockdown, permanent mask, permanent
[08:02.600 --> 08:07.680]  forced inoculations, the end of mom and pop stores, a dystopic nightmare, a worldwide
[08:07.680 --> 08:11.680]  depression, hundreds of millions starving to death, and that it would never end until
[08:11.680 --> 08:15.120]  we ended it, until we exposed the fraud.
[08:15.120 --> 08:22.560]  Every level of it has been a lie and a deception.
[08:22.560 --> 08:30.080]  I have three huge stories here, all of which we have broken, all of which Info Wars has
[08:30.080 --> 08:37.360]  discovered, all of which no one even knows about.
[08:37.360 --> 08:42.400]  Now it isn't about the credit, but I want listeners to understand, one of these stories
[08:42.400 --> 08:44.560]  would devastate the COVID hoax.
[08:44.560 --> 08:55.080]  We have three of them, premeditated, lying by the United Nations and by the NIH.
[08:55.080 --> 09:00.920]  Now I was up here this weekend working with Greg Rees and working with the rest of the
[09:00.920 --> 09:06.280]  weekend crew, he's also here during the week, that worked seven days a week, and he said,
[09:06.280 --> 09:10.440]  have you seen this Forbes article?
[09:10.440 --> 09:16.160]  Why the who faked a pandemic from 2010?
[09:16.160 --> 09:21.280]  And I said, holy Toledo, no, but I remember reading about that at the time, and I go,
[09:21.280 --> 09:22.280]  have you seen this?
[09:22.280 --> 09:29.120]  And he goes, no, faith in a quick test leads to an epidemic that wasn't, New York Times,
[09:29.120 --> 09:30.720]  13 years ago.
[09:30.720 --> 09:38.160]  Now he did a report on these with the who's own numbers and their own admissions that
[09:38.160 --> 09:45.000]  if you've had the flu or a cold or a bacterial infection, this is from the CDC, that it tests
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.840]  positive.
[09:48.840 --> 09:51.520]  Bill Gates had to come out this weekend and respond to Roger Stone and say, okay, it's
[09:51.520 --> 09:57.360]  true, the tests are fake, wow, but it doesn't matter, we'll still keep you locked down forever
[09:57.360 --> 09:58.360]  over it.
[09:58.360 --> 10:02.880]  It's not about numbers of infected now, not about death.
[10:02.880 --> 10:08.080]  And then you learn, there's hundreds of stories, one every day about, oh, this LGBT professor,
[10:08.080 --> 10:14.400]  she died of COVID, doesn't exist, being put out by PSYOP squads at Big Pharma.
[10:14.400 --> 10:26.360]  Oh, this child fell and died in the bathtub, but they tell you he died of COVID every day.
[10:26.360 --> 10:29.200]  That's even worse.
[10:29.200 --> 10:33.400]  Our crew, Rob, that does the searches in there while I'm talking on air about subjects, he'll
[10:33.400 --> 10:35.360]  he'll pull it up.
[10:35.360 --> 10:41.120]  He went and read the article from Axios, 97,000 children test positive for COVID-19, the school's
[10:41.120 --> 10:42.120]  eye reopening.
[10:42.120 --> 10:46.760]  He thought he might actually go to the report they're using from the National Hospital Association
[10:46.760 --> 10:51.840]  that gets his numbers from the CDC, Children's Hospital Association, they're counting people
[10:51.840 --> 11:00.120]  and almost all of them are 24 years old or 19.
[11:00.120 --> 11:05.080]  So they're now counting just like they count 30-year-old migrants, invaders, Islamist men
[11:05.080 --> 11:10.040]  as children and put them in school, in middle school with your daughters, and German TV says
[11:10.040 --> 11:16.520]  in after school shows, oh, this is Inga, she's 14, she has her 18-year-old boyfriend now,
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.040]  they're getting married, he's from Syria, he's like a 30-year-old dude.
[11:21.040 --> 11:27.040]  They're literally matchmaking your daughters with Islamists because they promise them in
[11:27.040 --> 11:30.840]  the ads, come to Germany, you get women, come to Sweden, you get women, and they're like
[11:30.840 --> 11:34.800]  the women, grown-up women, like I don't want this deadbeat, you know, Islamist, chop my
[11:34.800 --> 11:40.400]  head off, but they can give them a dumb 14-year-old, a lot of them get tortured and killed.
[11:40.400 --> 11:47.440]  My point is, is that this is the age of total deception, ladies and gentlemen, but wait
[11:47.440 --> 11:51.960]  till I get to this because here's the bigger enchilada.
[11:51.960 --> 11:56.360]  Gregory's put his report out last night on his own personal channel, he's, they haven't
[11:56.360 --> 11:59.120]  banned yet, I'm sure Media Matters will do a big story about it, they'll get it banned,
[11:59.120 --> 12:03.320]  he's had it before he worked here, but it's always at banned on video, but he backs them
[12:03.320 --> 12:10.880]  up there, mainstream media and science exposed COVID-19 as a hoax, his source is the CDC website,
[12:10.880 --> 12:20.080]  his source is the New York Times and Forbes, and they said, here's the letter, here's
[12:20.080 --> 12:27.600]  them giving him a strike, video content restrictions, YouTube doesn't allow content that explicitly
[12:27.600 --> 12:37.040]  disputes the efficacy of World Health Organization, the United Nations, and it goes on to say,
[12:37.040 --> 12:40.800]  as you know, community guidelines describe which content we allow and don't allow on
[12:40.800 --> 12:45.360]  YouTube, the mainstream media and science exposed COVID-19 as a hoax, was flagged to
[12:45.360 --> 12:49.760]  our review upon review, we determined that it violates our guidelines, we removed it
[12:49.760 --> 12:53.480]  from YouTube, and it goes on.
[12:53.480 --> 13:01.320]  So let that sink in, remember what the CEO, pull that up, she said it on CNN and CBS,
[13:01.320 --> 13:11.000]  CEO Susan Wachowski says, CEO of YouTube says, no one is allowed to disagree with the UN,
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.960]  she says that, she says, whatever the UN says, we follow, they said 2.5 million Americans
[13:15.960 --> 13:20.520]  would die, they said we had to be locked down for 15 days, because the hospitals would
[13:20.520 --> 13:24.520]  be full, none of it was true, they never intended to let us not be locked down, in fact their
[13:24.520 --> 13:29.080]  white papers said that, they said you'll never go back to life the way it was, you'll never
[13:29.080 --> 13:34.960]  stop wearing masks, and you'll never shake hands again, and they're doing it based on
[13:34.960 --> 13:42.040]  a pandemic that is a hoax, there's a real pneumonia, it's about a quarter of the strength
[13:42.040 --> 13:47.560]  of the flu, it spreads very easily, and it gives high false positives, but more importantly
[13:47.560 --> 13:55.400]  Billemelon de Gates and Fauci already have that chimera patented with two major patents
[13:55.400 --> 13:59.720]  for humans, four more for animals that also say can be used in humans, that's the ingredient
[13:59.720 --> 14:07.080]  for the vaccine, that's the attenuated virus, but it's not attenuated, it's live and it's
[14:07.080 --> 14:13.000]  a DNA virus, it goes in and reprograms your DNA, so there's a larger agenda here and it's
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.920]  about the vaccine they give you, that's the real effect, so they need to own the thing
[14:19.920 --> 14:24.360]  that they're then going to control, and it's so diabolical, so when we come back we're
[14:24.360 --> 14:29.520]  going to play you the report that's at the Gregory section at band.video, go to band.video,
[14:29.520 --> 14:32.800]  like your lives depend on it, your freedom depends on it, and the world depends on it,
[14:32.800 --> 14:36.320]  this is engineering a worldwide collapse, click on the left hand side of the three little
[14:36.320 --> 14:42.840]  lines, close down the menu of all the different people, and in there you'll find Greg Reese,
[14:42.840 --> 14:46.880]  and you click on that and you'll see his latest censored report, the only place you can see
[14:46.880 --> 14:53.800]  it's band.video, mainstream media and science exposed COVID-19 as a hoax, it is all mainstream
[14:53.800 --> 15:00.960]  CDC, New York Times, Forbes, word for word what they say, he shows that, but it's from
[15:00.960 --> 15:06.720]  ten years ago, the CDC is from right now, so it doesn't, it's like Stalin having people
[15:06.720 --> 15:11.120]  airbrushed out of photos with him, that he had executed, you're not allowed to remind
[15:11.120 --> 15:18.440]  people that this is 1984 Winston Smith, the memory hole, because it's all a lie, and we're
[15:18.440 --> 15:24.360]  going to show you these news articles and show you when the U.N. staged a pandemic as a drill
[15:24.360 --> 15:29.280]  ten years ago, and Forbes reports on it, and when they did it previous to that, and how
[15:29.280 --> 15:32.520]  they used fake testing, and then we're going to show you the CDC where they admit the test
[15:32.520 --> 15:39.440]  is fake, fake, but they just say we allow it so it's okay, it's all semantical games
[15:39.440 --> 15:44.280]  and we need Congress and President Trump to act, and he is appointing a new doctor above
[15:44.280 --> 15:48.560]  Fauci that knows this is all a hoax, he's going to be exposing it, but man, I tell you, the
[15:48.560 --> 15:52.240]  irrevocable damage to the global economy is already here, it's the cover for their
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.160]  worldwide reset, they're popping the bubble on purpose to bring down America.
[15:57.160 --> 16:04.800]  States cracking down on social gatherings says CNN, because Fauci says if we don't, we'll
[16:04.800 --> 16:11.600]  see further surges in coronavirus positives, because they're only ramping up the testing,
[16:11.600 --> 16:18.040]  because the tests have been designed at the Wuhan lab it turns out to be completely fraudulent.
[16:18.040 --> 16:23.440]  They cooked the whole thing up offshore in a communist dictatorship with Fauci, Bill
[16:23.440 --> 16:29.800]  Gates, and the Chai comms to be directed by the U.N. as a giant planetary power grab,
[16:29.800 --> 16:34.440]  and now it's all over the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos
[16:34.440 --> 16:40.720]  under your skin, and so has Google, and they're deploying them at the airports next year,
[16:40.720 --> 16:44.400]  and you'll have to have it to be able to travel, oh, and then soon to leave your house, they're
[16:44.400 --> 16:48.680]  going to a grocery store, and the contact tracers work for Bill and Melinda Gates and
[16:48.680 --> 16:51.920]  the Clintons, and they're going to come to your house and make sure you're inoculated.
[16:51.920 --> 16:57.200]  Yes, we're now inside the mark of the beast, resist to be enslaved.
[16:57.200 --> 17:03.240]  America and the world should have never been closed, it was all based on WHO, Bill and
[17:03.240 --> 17:10.000]  Melinda Gates, Fauci NIH lives, but now here we are already into August, and they're trying
[17:10.000 --> 17:18.720]  to keep our stores, our factories, our schools, our parks closed, it is outrageous.
[17:18.720 --> 17:25.920]  Well we have launched a new big sale titled Reopen America, back to school special, 50-60%

[18:18.120 --> 18:39.320]  This is a big deal, this is our entire civilization being put under medical, martial law to track
[18:39.320 --> 18:44.200]  and control you and force you to be inoculated and decide who's essential and who's not,
[18:44.200 --> 18:51.200]  and it's all based on premeditated Rockefeller Foundation, Mila Melinda Gates, NIH, UN,
[18:51.200 --> 18:59.040]  CHICOM deployment, where they had the UN and China create hysteria, put out the fake numbers,
[18:59.040 --> 19:04.960]  create the fear, and launch this operation that they drilled for last October and November
[19:04.960 --> 19:12.600]  in event 201 and lockstep, and remember people really started getting concerned about this
[19:12.600 --> 19:18.760]  when the CEO of YouTube came out three, four months ago on TV and said, oh, if something
[19:18.760 --> 19:25.360]  doesn't agree with the WHO, it's the gold standard, then we don't allow it, and then
[19:25.360 --> 19:30.400]  we saw hundreds of doctors and nurses and epidemiologists and virologists and scientists,
[19:30.400 --> 19:35.920]  prestigious ones, down to local clinic owners and medical doctors and emergency room doctors
[19:35.920 --> 19:41.320]  saying, hey, I treated 400 people, 900 people, they all got better with hydroxychloroquine
[19:41.320 --> 19:48.520]  and zinc, hey, I did this, hey, I did that, and they go, sorry, UN says that's not allowed,
[19:48.520 --> 19:53.280]  and it's all fouchy with Rindesivir, that he had a fake study that said it made you
[19:53.280 --> 19:59.920]  8% better, and then that was a lie, then they put out another fake study saying that hydroxychloroquine
[19:59.920 --> 20:03.520]  didn't help you, paid for by Bill Gates' Foundation, they had to withdraw it, it was
[20:03.520 --> 20:12.800]  a fraud, and they used that still at the UN to say you can't prescribe hydroxychloroquine.
[20:12.800 --> 20:17.680]  So they didn't come by land, they didn't come by sea in blue helmets, they came through
[20:17.680 --> 20:25.200]  medical tyranny in white jackets, and Trump's gotten us out of the WHO, but still the big
[20:25.200 --> 20:30.200]  US foundations and global foundations and European foundations run the UN, they created
[20:30.200 --> 20:36.120]  it, so he cuts one head off the Hydra, and he's still there with fouchy and Gates and
[20:36.120 --> 20:41.160]  all the rest of it, and Gates smiling with Fareed Zarkary on CNN, oh, we're never going
[20:41.160 --> 20:45.880]  to reopen America again, because that's right, and that's so happy, it's like he just won
[20:45.880 --> 20:55.400]  85 trillion dollars, inappropriate, sick, evil, celebrating in front of us, so the report
[20:55.400 --> 21:00.280]  has 99,000 views, went up last night, mainstream media science exposed COVID-19 as a hoax,
[21:00.280 --> 21:06.200]  and it does, what's crazy is the actual science of the CDC website says, this is the biggest
[21:06.200 --> 21:12.320]  false positive test ever, almost all of them are false positive, zinc inside yourselves,
[21:12.320 --> 21:17.120]  you can't get it, it actually says that on their website, but you try to, we've had
[21:17.120 --> 21:21.760]  videos we put out where we read off the CDC website, but there's actually real scientists
[21:21.760 --> 21:28.880]  putting this up, they're not fouchy, the bureaucrat of 45 years, and then that gets removed, and
[21:28.880 --> 21:35.080]  they cite as the authority, the United Nations that got caught covering up the Wuhan lab,
[21:35.080 --> 21:40.480]  and covering up human transmission, remember all that, and now our own doctors, the Trumps
[21:40.480 --> 21:47.680]  had his tweets censored, when he chose a press conference of 15 medical doctors in front
[21:47.680 --> 21:51.680]  of the Capitol, in America, we can't have doctors having a press conference, and now
[21:51.680 --> 21:56.560]  Laura Loomer has had her phone bank system shut down by the phone company, they're saying
[21:56.560 --> 22:00.560]  she can't make phone calls or send text messages for her congressional campaign, because she's
[22:00.560 --> 22:07.240]  in the lead, my God, it's beyond election meddling, it's all happening because Congress
[22:07.240 --> 22:12.080]  won't act, and so because they won't act regulatory, the UN is now coming to the vacuum
[22:12.080 --> 22:17.480]  and is in charge of America, Trump and Congress must act now, with 83 days left, here is the
[22:17.480 --> 22:23.160]  report, it's so powerful, share it, this is what the UN says, you can't hear, and we had
[22:23.160 --> 22:27.640]  to set up our own network, our own infrastructure, just to be able to bring you this, this is
[22:27.640 --> 22:31.880]  so precious, and I'm just a quarterback with a ball, I throw it, you don't catch it and
[22:31.880 --> 22:36.320]  run, we lose, I'm firing that ball out there baby, I need you to share this right now,
[22:36.320 --> 22:40.440]  if you want to kick some globalist ass, here it is.
[22:40.440 --> 22:43.960]  There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, this
[22:43.960 --> 22:55.800]  is as fool me once, shame on you, it's fool me, we can't get fooled again.
[22:55.800 --> 23:02.920]  In 2010, Forbes magazine accurately reported on the WHO's fraudulent response to the swine
[23:02.920 --> 23:09.440]  flu, the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe declared the false pandemic is one
[23:09.440 --> 23:16.880]  of the greatest medicine scandals of the century, by their own rules, a pandemic requires simultaneous
[23:16.880 --> 23:24.560]  epidemics worldwide, with enormous numbers of deaths and illness, 11 weeks into the outbreak,
[23:24.560 --> 23:33.960]  only 144 people died worldwide, and the WHO declared a pandemic, just one month before,
[23:33.960 --> 23:41.280]  they changed the rules, you could now have a pandemic with zero deaths, and when questioned,
[23:41.280 --> 23:46.800]  they claimed the old rule never existed, now there is some confusion here and I hope to
[23:46.800 --> 23:56.280]  clarify, having severe death has never been part of the WHO pandemic, the WHO director
[23:56.280 --> 24:03.160]  Dr. Margaret Chan then went on to push left wing politics, the redistribution of wealth
[24:03.160 --> 24:10.680]  for equity and social justice, and claimed that a welfare state is the savior of globalism,
[24:10.680 --> 24:14.920]  over $18 billion was misallocated on this fake pandemic.
[24:14.920 --> 24:17.240]  All right, let's stop right there.
[24:17.240 --> 24:20.800]  The crew is doing an excellent job, I went to this video about a minute late, so we won't
[24:20.800 --> 24:23.800]  have time to play the whole report, most of the graduates reports are four minutes long,
[24:23.800 --> 24:29.120]  this was five, I'd forgotten that, so when we come back, I'll play the full report, but
[24:29.120 --> 24:35.120]  it's so concise, it's five minutes that overturns the entire COVID-19 oaks from pillar to post
[24:35.120 --> 24:39.600]  with their own UN statements, their own documents, their own admissions, New York Times, Forbes
[24:39.600 --> 24:48.080]  magazine, CDC.gov, it's just so incredible, and imagine the UN says you can't have this,
[24:48.080 --> 24:53.240]  we'll also get back to show you the CEO of YouTube again saying that she takes orders
[24:53.240 --> 24:58.760]  and that if something disagrees with the UN, it's not allowed, as if they were totally
[24:58.760 --> 25:02.360]  right all the time, we'd have a right to be wrong, but they're liars.
[25:02.360 --> 25:09.000]  So again, we wake up in this new world with big tech under UN control, we've got to raise
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.520]  the alarm, we can't let them just normalize all of this based on their frauds, separately,
[25:14.520 --> 25:19.520]  we have the reopen America back to school special, and what it is is an extension of
[25:19.520 --> 25:24.120]  the other big sale, but I can't do the free shipping because it just, we're bringing in
[25:24.120 --> 25:27.760]  funds but not enough to run the operation, so we did the accounting, it's still a great

[26:49.880 --> 26:54.640]  the worms, we're about to break the lie that is COVID-19.
[26:54.640 --> 26:58.840]  A lot of you are probably already very familiar with these terms, I'm about to introduce, but
[26:58.840 --> 27:02.840]  some folks aren't, so for those that aren't, here they are.
[27:02.840 --> 27:11.720]  Activated charcoal, and then another term, enamel safe, activated charcoal is the fastest
[27:11.720 --> 27:17.080]  growing type of toothpaste, for a good reason, it really, really works, well, we've come
[27:17.080 --> 27:21.840]  up with the best activated charcoal toothpaste, with no fillers, the cleanest type, the highest
[27:21.840 --> 27:27.320]  quality, with a bunch of high-quality essential oils and other ingredients, known and documented

[27:35.440 --> 27:36.440]  it's good for your gums.
[27:36.440 --> 27:41.320]  But on top of that, it doesn't have any ingredients that are known to hurt enamel.
[27:41.320 --> 27:44.960]  I've gone out before and gotten toothpaste that really made my teeth clean, but eroded
[27:44.960 --> 27:50.600]  enamel up the top, so I got into really safe, healthy types of toothpaste, and that's what
[27:50.600 --> 27:55.480]  this is, it's available at infowarstore.com.
[27:55.480 --> 28:05.000]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.

[28:55.120 --> 29:00.600]  August 2020 is here, it's less than 90 days out from the historic election.
[29:00.600 --> 29:05.080]  The Chai comms, the EU, Hollywood, the Democratic Party, and the blue states and blue cities
[29:05.080 --> 29:10.920]  are all battling to keep America shut down and to destroy free speech as well to ensure
[29:10.920 --> 29:16.200]  their final takeover of the United States by removing President Donald John Trump.
[29:16.200 --> 29:20.560]  At infowar, we're fighting back harder than ever, so your word of mouth and your prayer

[30:38.600 --> 30:45.720]  You defeated Terri before, our ancestors did, you defeated the slated masters before, we'll
[30:45.720 --> 30:51.680]  beat them again, but make no mistake, we're going into bondage right now, and that doesn't
[30:51.680 --> 30:58.640]  make every sell in your body surge with the energy to resist it, but there's something
[30:58.640 --> 31:07.680]  wrong with you, it's time to wake up, it's time to decide that you're not going to adapt
[31:07.680 --> 31:14.120]  to being a slave, but we're going to throw this thing off together with our kinship,
[31:14.120 --> 31:19.520]  and go to the future, we're not going to let these tyrants steal the future from us, we're
[31:19.520 --> 31:25.520]  going to let this attack it, energize us to rise to the occasion.
[31:25.520 --> 31:35.240]  Alright, here is the CEO, Susan Wachowski, on CNN, there's a bunch of these clips with
[31:35.240 --> 31:42.760]  Humpty Dumpty, Ryan Skelter, the worst gaslighter on the planet, there's some conservatives say
[31:42.760 --> 31:51.440]  the sky is blue, everyone knows that it's purple and high noon, why, there's no liberal
[31:51.440 --> 31:56.280]  media, there's nothing but conservative media, and we need to shut them down, that was two
[31:56.280 --> 32:01.600]  days ago, I'll get to that later, I mean, this is a person that lives to try to lie
[32:01.600 --> 32:07.040]  to you, and he's the worst liar ever with a hundred thousand viewers, but when he says
[32:07.040 --> 32:12.040]  censor something, and his little minion, Oliver Darcy says that it happens, because they speak
[32:12.040 --> 32:17.640]  for the establishment, so here he is interviewing her, and she's talking about, oh, we only
[32:17.640 --> 32:22.360]  go off the WHO, and if you disagree with that, it's gone, here it is.
[32:22.360 --> 32:28.200]  But then we also talk about removing information that is problematic, of course anything that
[32:28.200 --> 32:35.160]  is medically unsubstantiated to people saying like take vitamin C, take turmeric, like those
[32:35.160 --> 32:39.360]  all will cure you, those are the examples of things that would be a violation of her
[32:39.360 --> 32:44.160]  policy, anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would
[32:44.160 --> 32:49.840]  be a violation of her policy, and to remove is another really important part of our policy.
[32:49.840 --> 32:52.000]  Our policy, our policy.
[32:52.000 --> 32:56.920]  A couple of years ago, she's up on the stage with another one of the CEOs, and they go,
[32:56.920 --> 33:00.520]  I don't like how it's shown, my son's been watching him, she's still there, he'll be
[33:00.520 --> 33:04.040]  gone soon.
[33:04.040 --> 33:08.040]  This is who's watching you and listening to you, with the Google assistance and the Alexa
[33:08.040 --> 33:12.240]  assistance with Amazon, and you just bring it in your house to publicly listen to you,
[33:12.240 --> 33:15.800]  I mean the cell phone's already been listened to you, I told you that 20 years ago, unless
[33:15.800 --> 33:17.640]  you've got it turned off.
[33:17.640 --> 33:24.520]  Now they're just doing it, that's okay, because Google helps run death counts in China, along
[33:24.520 --> 33:32.400]  with Apple and Nike, we like Copernag, so it's all this non-threatening facade, this
[33:32.400 --> 33:38.000]  non-threatening cover, and now that was back on April 19th, when she gave that little
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.800]  interview on Patriots Day.
[33:40.800 --> 33:48.280]  Now here we are, four months later, and hundreds of doctors, hundreds of scientists, Cedar
[33:48.280 --> 33:53.640]  Sinai, put out a video that had been out for months that Trump talked about, about putting
[33:53.640 --> 33:59.760]  light in the lungs, and they got their video banned, oh no, the UN says, not a top research
[33:59.760 --> 34:04.520]  hospital.
[34:04.520 --> 34:08.400]  Think about that, there's not much further to go, other than not letting us use text
[34:08.400 --> 34:13.360]  messages or phones, and now Laura Loomer's in the lead to win the Republican primary
[34:13.360 --> 34:18.680]  and to beat the Democrat, the general election, so now she's not allowed to use a telephone.
[34:18.680 --> 34:24.960]  They've turned her telephone service off, she's joining us today, they're like, oh
[34:24.960 --> 34:30.480]  we don't allow hate, sorry, your campaign system can't send text messages to people.
[34:30.480 --> 34:37.960]  StoriesOnInFullWars.com, that's the plan, it's here.
[34:37.960 --> 34:43.840]  And Congress sits there and goes, we don't regulate the internet, no, no, section 230.
[34:43.840 --> 34:49.760]  And so now the CHI comes and the UN do, because by the vacuum of us having a prohibitive
[34:49.760 --> 34:53.960]  law, like the Second Amendment or the First Amendment says, you can't take guns and you
[34:53.960 --> 34:56.000]  can't censor speech.
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.560]  It's a law that protects, not a law that inhibits, but by their lack of action, they have put
[35:02.560 --> 35:07.480]  us under corporate UN control.
[35:07.480 --> 35:10.920]  Here's the Gregory's report.
[35:10.920 --> 35:14.400]  There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that
[35:14.400 --> 35:26.280]  it says fool me once, shame on you, it fooled me, we can't get fooled again.
[35:26.280 --> 35:33.520]  In 2010, Forbes Magazine accurately reported on the WHO's fraudulent response to the swine
[35:33.520 --> 35:34.520]  flu.
[35:34.520 --> 35:39.960]  The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe declared the false pandemic is one
[35:39.960 --> 35:43.320]  of the greatest medicine scandals of the century.
[35:43.320 --> 35:50.640]  By their own rules, a pandemic requires simultaneous epidemics worldwide with enormous numbers
[35:50.640 --> 35:52.960]  of deaths and illness.
[35:52.960 --> 35:59.040]  11 weeks into the outbreak, only 144 people died worldwide.
[35:59.040 --> 36:02.920]  And the WHO declared a pandemic.
[36:02.920 --> 36:06.680]  Just one month before, they changed the rules.
[36:06.680 --> 36:10.440]  You could now have a pandemic with zero deaths.
[36:10.440 --> 36:14.680]  And when questioned, they claimed the old rule never existed.
[36:14.680 --> 36:21.840]  Now, there is some confusion here, and I hope to clarify, having severe death has never
[36:21.840 --> 36:25.040]  been part of the WHO pandemic.
[36:25.040 --> 36:33.000]  The WHO director, Dr. Margaret Chan, then went on to push left-wing politics, the redistribution
[36:33.000 --> 36:39.120]  of wealth for equity and social justice, and claimed that a welfare state is the savior
[36:39.120 --> 36:41.200]  of globalism.
[36:41.200 --> 36:46.960]  Over $18 billion was misallocated on this fake pandemic.
[36:46.960 --> 36:54.040]  In 2005, Dr. Peter Doshi published a paper entitled, Our U.S. Flu Death Figures More
[36:54.040 --> 36:59.640]  PR Than Science, Drawing Upon Data from the CDC.
[36:59.640 --> 37:06.640]  The CDC bundles together influenza and pneumonia and counts them together, which is strange,
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.320]  because according to their own data, there are far more deaths caused by pneumonia than
[37:11.320 --> 37:12.440]  the flu.
[37:12.440 --> 37:20.360]  For example, out of the 62,000 pneumonia and influenza deaths from 2001, only 18 cases
[37:20.360 --> 37:26.120]  were lab-confirmed influenza, 0.03 percent.
[37:26.120 --> 37:33.840]  From 1979 to 2002, there were an average of 58 influenza deaths per year.
[37:33.840 --> 37:42.000]  In 2004, CDC director Glenn Nowak gave a presentation wherein he called upon the media to state
[37:42.000 --> 37:49.320]  concern and alarm, predict dire outcomes, and urge influenza vaccination.
[37:49.320 --> 37:55.760]  The Flu Protection Act of 2005 required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to
[37:55.760 --> 38:03.040]  conduct public influenza awareness campaigns, preceding every flu season.
[38:03.040 --> 38:10.120]  Examples of the flu vaccine began skyrocketing, bringing in billions of dollars to the manufacturers,
[38:10.120 --> 38:16.120]  all for something that kills, on average, less than 100 people a year.
[38:16.120 --> 38:23.000]  In 2007, The New York Times published an article entitled, Faith in Quick Test Leads to Epidemic
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.600]  That Wasn't.
[38:24.600 --> 38:31.720]  It explains how the same PCR tests being used now for COVID-19 misdiagnosed over 100 healthcare
[38:31.720 --> 38:37.000]  workers in New Hampshire, and rang the bell for a whooping cough epidemic that turned
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.080]  out to just be the common cold.
[38:40.080 --> 38:45.960]  The PCR tests were never meant to detect a specific virus, and yet, they are being used
[38:45.960 --> 38:49.480]  today to detect COVID-19.
[38:49.480 --> 38:57.360]  The CDC even admits that the PCR test will detect any viral infection as COVID-19, including
[38:57.360 --> 38:59.440]  the common cold.
[38:59.440 --> 39:05.520]  The current data from the CDC on COVID-19 shows the same fakery that we have seen so
[39:05.520 --> 39:07.020]  far.
[39:07.020 --> 39:13.200]  Just as the CDC falsely counted pneumonia deaths as influenza deaths in the past, they
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.920]  are now counting both pneumonia and influenza as COVID-19.
[39:18.920 --> 39:22.800]  You can see it clearly in the CDC's own data.
[39:22.800 --> 39:28.360]  Beginning in the end of March, right after the shutdown began in the US, pneumonia and
[39:28.360 --> 39:34.960]  influenza deaths dropped to zero, just as COVID deaths began to surge.
[39:34.960 --> 39:38.160]  COVID-19 is a quantifiable hoax.
[39:38.160 --> 39:44.360]  After years of unchecked big pharma fraud, we are witnessing their greatest swindle yet,
[39:44.360 --> 39:49.240]  and the amount of people wearing the mask only illustrates how effective their scan
[39:49.240 --> 39:50.240]  is.
[39:50.240 --> 39:51.800]  The whole report is at band.video.
[39:51.800 --> 39:54.120]  We'll be right back with all the documents they were using.
[39:54.120 --> 40:02.920]  But the number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes, and we've gone over
[40:02.920 --> 40:06.440]  those purposes many times here on air.
[40:06.440 --> 40:10.760]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced
[40:10.760 --> 40:11.760]  inoculation.
[40:11.760 --> 40:19.520]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential
[40:19.520 --> 40:26.000]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  once had by design.
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.840]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[40:32.840 --> 40:38.200]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[40:38.200 --> 40:43.600]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks
[40:43.600 --> 40:50.080]  that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[40:50.080 --> 40:53.600]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[40:53.600 --> 40:58.480]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your
[40:58.480 --> 41:00.400]  GPS location.
[41:00.400 --> 41:06.040]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[41:06.040 --> 41:11.800]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and Androids
[41:11.800 --> 41:16.520]  don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk
[41:16.520 --> 41:21.520]  to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing
[41:21.520 --> 41:27.200]  on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just
[41:27.200 --> 41:33.280]  like Siri or Alexa do, and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those
[41:33.280 --> 41:35.360]  systems to be saved forever.
[41:35.360 --> 41:39.320]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[41:39.320 --> 41:40.680]  based on information.
[41:40.680 --> 41:43.840]  This is the global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.

[41:51.680 --> 42:14.880]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss in your leftist run neighborhoods?
[42:14.880 --> 42:21.640]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing and infowarstore has the solution.

[42:27.440 --> 42:33.680]  on the market with over a thousand types of mold and mildew, toxic chemicals, and yes,
[42:33.680 --> 42:34.680]  dust mites.

[42:48.240 --> 42:55.000]  Here are the info wars life lung cleanse plus supplement today at infowarstore.com.
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.560]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go back to those
[42:58.560 --> 43:05.480]  shows we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master
[43:05.480 --> 43:11.440]  computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict large
[43:11.440 --> 43:16.080]  groups of human movements and activities but even predict what individuals would do and
[43:16.080 --> 43:20.440]  then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing, you could add stimuli
[43:20.440 --> 43:26.320]  through the AI systems, through the computers, through digital billboards, through face scanning,
[43:26.320 --> 43:30.640]  through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted to.
[43:30.640 --> 43:34.880]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[43:34.880 --> 43:39.520]  It was a conspiracy theory even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint
[43:39.520 --> 43:40.520]  documents.
[43:40.520 --> 43:44.600]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this
[43:44.600 --> 43:49.680]  control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out and it's something about a thousand
[43:49.680 --> 43:57.720]  times crazier than what Hitler planned so we might want to dismantle the system now.
[43:57.720 --> 44:15.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:15.680 --> 44:21.360]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[44:21.360 --> 44:44.520]  You don't decide to take action as citizens and warn others.
[44:44.520 --> 44:50.600]  These tyrants, these scientific technocrats, these medical dictators are going to take
[44:50.600 --> 44:54.200]  over our lives and you can see that now.
[44:54.200 --> 45:00.080]  Publicly they said six months ago, just 15 days, so the hospital's not going to ever
[45:00.080 --> 45:02.440]  wound and then we'll take the lockdown off.
[45:02.440 --> 45:06.920]  And I'm like, no, then they say they're going to go to mask and then contact tracing and
[45:06.920 --> 45:10.440]  then inoculation to fly on an airplane or have a job.
[45:10.440 --> 45:14.200]  And now that's all been announced last month.
[45:14.200 --> 45:19.640]  People are like, how did you know, it's all, Jones, he just, and there's nothing more
[45:19.640 --> 45:24.640]  frustrating than getting credit like I'm a psychic on all this when it's a formula, it's
[45:24.640 --> 45:32.160]  a fraud, it's a lie, it's a rollout, it's a takeover.
[45:32.160 --> 45:40.280]  And Congress sits up there and twiddles their thumbs and asks, is there censorship going
[45:40.280 --> 45:41.280]  on?
[45:41.280 --> 45:44.120]  What on the world?
[45:44.120 --> 45:54.360]  There's total control, Brian Stelter, a year ago, last summer, when Facebook did their
[45:54.360 --> 45:59.000]  expanded ban saying you can only say bad things about Alex Jones, they said you must make
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.840]  a negative disparaging comment if you say his name or you will be penalized or suspended
[46:04.840 --> 46:07.800]  or expelled.
[46:07.800 --> 46:08.800]  That's a cult.
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.480]  In fact, hey, you don't talk about somebody, but if you say their name, it's negative.
[46:13.480 --> 46:21.640]  That was mainstream news said that, that was their official statement, that was a year
[46:21.640 --> 46:29.960]  ago, that was last August, it's been a year now, on the second phase of the banning.
[46:29.960 --> 46:35.400]  And then I remember Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy, who run the censorship stuff through
[46:35.400 --> 46:40.120]  CNN and Nexus and Big Tech, because they're told what to say, they went, next we need
[46:40.120 --> 46:45.120]  to control them with their text messages, we're seeing if he's got WhatsApp on his phone.
[46:45.120 --> 46:50.760]  And they went and looked through Apple and went and said, well, he doesn't have it.
[46:50.760 --> 46:55.800]  They were in my phone and came out on CNN the next week and said, well, we checked,
[46:55.800 --> 46:58.400]  he doesn't have it.
[46:58.400 --> 47:02.200]  They have assistance in your house listening to you.
[47:02.200 --> 47:07.040]  That's the power of the technology, your search data, where you go, what you do, Big Tech
[47:07.040 --> 47:13.840]  all shares it, thousands of companies share it and CNN isn't a media company.
[47:13.840 --> 47:17.400]  They're attack dogs that spy on you and I told everybody, they're like, Jones, how are
[47:17.400 --> 47:18.400]  you handling this?
[47:18.400 --> 47:28.040]  And I said, you're next, I'm just the beta test.
[47:28.040 --> 47:35.320]  And now you see, it's the president, it's Laura Loomer.
[47:35.320 --> 47:39.440]  And this is what they do.
[47:39.440 --> 47:42.640]  And they create a psychological algorithm about what porn you visit, what you said to
[47:42.640 --> 47:46.400]  your wife while you're having sex, what she says, what you do, it's all being recorded
[47:46.400 --> 47:50.800]  and they admit it's being recorded and put in a psychological database.
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.120]  You wouldn't tell your psychologist this stuff.
[47:54.120 --> 47:58.080]  You wouldn't tell your wife or husband this stuff, but you'll put something in your house
[47:58.080 --> 48:00.440]  that Big Tech admits is listening to you.
[48:00.440 --> 48:04.520]  That's the only difference between these home assistants and your cell phone is they have
[48:04.520 --> 48:10.040]  been doing it forever, but now they're just telling you.
[48:10.040 --> 48:13.200]  So if you don't want somebody else in the room during that banking meeting or during
[48:13.200 --> 48:16.880]  that prayer meeting or when you're having sex with your wife or whatever, remember,
[48:16.880 --> 48:21.160]  if you're not going to have the neighbor Mel at the end of your bed or on the nightstand,
[48:21.160 --> 48:25.560]  you know, why not just have your neighbor and their wife over and just have sex in
[48:25.560 --> 48:28.320]  front of them?
[48:28.320 --> 48:33.240]  Because you're having sex in front of all the Big Tech companies.
[48:33.240 --> 48:38.080]  And now they say, instantly, when Gregory's video went up and said, sorry, not allowed,
[48:38.080 --> 48:43.480]  you criticize the official COVID story, which is an admitted fraud, it's Swiss cheese of
[48:43.480 --> 48:44.480]  lies.
[48:44.480 --> 48:48.560]  In fact, it's not even Swiss cheese of lies with Swiss cheese.
[48:48.560 --> 48:50.520]  You've got about half of its actual cheese.
[48:50.520 --> 48:53.720]  The rest is holes.
[48:53.720 --> 48:56.600]  There's nothing there.
[48:56.600 --> 49:05.240]  And so, oh, sorry, Gregory, sorry, you said that the virus is overblown and you showed
[49:05.240 --> 49:07.200]  the New York Times and the CDC website.
[49:07.200 --> 49:14.520]  That's not allowed because they're not the UN.
[49:14.520 --> 49:17.720]  How does that just happen?
[49:17.720 --> 49:18.720]  And it's all over the news.
[49:18.720 --> 49:19.720]  They're doing it.
[49:19.720 --> 49:22.800]  And we just sit here and put up with it.
[49:22.800 --> 49:25.800]  The headline, mainstream media and science exposed COVID-19 as a hoax.
[49:25.800 --> 49:27.440]  We need to probably change the headline.
[49:27.440 --> 49:34.240]  See the COVID-19 hoax video censored by YouTube.
[49:34.240 --> 49:39.440]  We'll repost at the front page of InfoWars with all the information because it's a big,
[49:39.440 --> 49:40.440]  big deal.
[49:40.440 --> 49:42.080]  It needs 10 million views, folks.
[49:42.080 --> 49:44.800]  Our best video has 5 million views at Band-Aid Video.
[49:44.800 --> 49:45.800]  And that's great.
[49:45.800 --> 49:46.800]  I pay for the bandwidth and everything else.
[49:46.800 --> 49:48.160]  But you pay for it supporting us.
[49:48.160 --> 49:52.000]  But I really want one with 10 million views.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  And that's up to you.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.480]  And I'm not bitching at you, but, man, don't you want to save the country, the future of
[49:56.480 --> 49:59.000]  the world, millions starving to death right now around the world?
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  Don't you want to stop the permanent mask wearing?
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  Don't you want to stop the force inoculations and CNN and BBC reporting?
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.280]  Oh, you're going to get a digital tattoo so you can get on an airplane?
[50:10.280 --> 50:11.280]  They're all announcing it.
[50:11.280 --> 50:13.040]  And then we go, hey, that's a bad idea.
[50:13.040 --> 50:14.280]  Bill Gates funded that.
[50:14.280 --> 50:17.520]  Here's the head of MIT saying, oh, no, Bill Gates didn't do anything.
[50:17.520 --> 50:18.520]  You're fake news.
[50:18.520 --> 50:19.520]  That's not allowed.
[50:19.520 --> 50:20.520]  It's outrageous.
[50:20.520 --> 50:26.000]  They censor videos of Bill Gates saying they're going to do it to you five years ago.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.480]  If I put out videos of him saying we need to kill old people, we need to kill all the
[50:30.480 --> 50:37.320]  babies, and they'll censor that because he shot his mouth off for years about how he
[50:37.320 --> 50:40.560]  wanted to depopulate us.
[50:40.560 --> 50:43.760]  And now people are taking him at his word and they're like, you're my doctor, but you're
[50:43.760 --> 50:44.760]  not a doctor.
[50:44.760 --> 50:46.280]  And the UN's my doctor.
[50:46.280 --> 50:51.640]  But doctors can't have speech in America, prestigious ones.
[50:51.640 --> 50:52.640]  It's not coming.
[50:52.640 --> 50:53.640]  It's here.
[50:53.640 --> 50:56.800]  We're deep inside of it now, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:56.800 --> 51:02.040]  So let's go over some of these articles.
[51:02.040 --> 51:06.040]  Why the WHO faked a pandemic?
[51:06.040 --> 51:11.920]  Forbes magazine 10 years ago, Michael Femento, and it goes all over how they staged a whole
[51:11.920 --> 51:18.760]  fake deal with the Rockefeller Foundation and the CDC and Fauci to see how the public
[51:18.760 --> 51:19.760]  will respond.
[51:19.760 --> 51:21.040]  And what did Gates say three months ago in Colbert?
[51:21.040 --> 51:22.920]  He said, this is really just a drill.
[51:22.920 --> 51:25.720]  The real attacks coming from terrorists, it'll be much worse.
[51:25.720 --> 51:26.720]  This is a drill.
[51:26.720 --> 51:29.720]  This is a lockdown drill to see how you'll behave.
[51:29.720 --> 51:32.720]  And if you grovel and behave, they're going to release something far worse.
[51:32.720 --> 51:34.040]  I mean, go watch it for yourself.
[51:34.040 --> 51:35.640]  Probably play it 20 times.
[51:35.640 --> 51:37.200]  I'm not going to play it again.
[51:37.200 --> 51:44.560]  It's in a film we're making, but there it is on screen, it's a drill.
[51:44.560 --> 51:46.520]  But the public, here's the key.
[51:46.520 --> 51:52.800]  The public is so one dimensional now that it's just, hey, wear a mask, save people,
[51:52.800 --> 51:53.800]  be a hero.
[51:53.800 --> 51:56.480]  They don't think, well, wait, nobody's really dying from this.
[51:56.480 --> 51:57.480]  They're lying about it.
[51:57.480 --> 51:59.400]  And wait, they admit it's not going to be permanent.
[51:59.400 --> 52:03.160]  And it's about me submitting that I'm bad and not seeing other people's faces and killing
[52:03.160 --> 52:06.160]  humanity and separating us from each other.
[52:06.160 --> 52:09.920]  And if I submit to this, it's people trying to think one dimensional, not, well, who's
[52:09.920 --> 52:10.920]  behind this?
[52:10.920 --> 52:12.080]  Well, what's the end game?
[52:12.080 --> 52:15.000]  And why are they lying so much as you know, I'm a hero.
[52:15.000 --> 52:16.160]  I decided I'm a hero.
[52:16.160 --> 52:18.240]  And when I wear this mask, I'm a hero.
[52:18.240 --> 52:25.920]  No, you've shown yourself to be someone submitting to peer pressure and someone buying into propaganda.
[52:25.920 --> 52:26.920]  Here's another one.
[52:26.920 --> 52:33.160]  Faith in a quick test leads to epidemic that wasn't New York Times 13 years ago.
[52:33.160 --> 52:39.320]  Go read the article for yourself, big article, how they use tests were basically if you ever
[52:39.320 --> 52:43.640]  had a bacterial infection, it says you had the flu.
[52:43.640 --> 52:54.400]  So same test folks, again, CDC 2019 novel coronavirus real time RTPRC diagnostic panel.
[52:54.400 --> 53:01.600]  This is the official CDC and it says on page three, do not rule out bacterial infection
[53:01.600 --> 53:05.920]  or co infection with other viruses, false positives.
[53:05.920 --> 53:09.280]  They admit most of the tests are false and Gates has had to admit, okay, most of the
[53:09.280 --> 53:10.280]  tests are false.
[53:10.280 --> 53:11.880]  Yeah, because they put them out.
[53:11.880 --> 53:14.000]  They wrote the parameters to create the maximum fear.
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.320]  That's why you've got, oh, tens of millions of Americans have it, oh, yeah, but why is
[53:18.320 --> 53:19.320]  the death rate?
[53:19.320 --> 53:23.360]  Let me show you this right now.
[53:23.360 --> 53:29.800]  Fact check, CDC estimates COVID-19 death rate at around 0.26, but then they had to confirm
[53:29.800 --> 53:30.800]  it later.
[53:30.800 --> 53:31.800]  Here's the numbers.
[53:31.800 --> 53:35.560]  Here's the numbers in Texas.
[53:35.560 --> 53:47.920]  In Texas, it's incredibly low, ladies and gentlemen, 0.32, 0.32, oh, let's look at German
[53:47.920 --> 53:54.160]  new German study finds coronavirus mortality rate at 0.37, this is from the German government.
[53:54.160 --> 53:58.800]  But see, we're not allowed to show you this on YouTube.
[53:58.800 --> 54:07.760]  I can't show you USA Today or Gateway Puget or M4 Wars because it's not the UN.
[54:07.760 --> 54:09.920]  Even though the UN admits that, it doesn't matter.
[54:09.920 --> 54:13.360]  They say you don't need one death to call it a pandemic.
[54:13.360 --> 54:21.560]  Like I said, it's just unbelievable and it's just going to get worse.
[54:21.560 --> 54:23.960]  And now we're already six, eight months into this, everything locked down and people are
[54:23.960 --> 54:24.960]  just getting used to it.
[54:24.960 --> 54:29.040]  We've got an even bigger fraud, I haven't gotten into yet on COVID-19, it's an exclusive
[54:29.040 --> 54:32.280]  to M4Wars.com coming up.
[54:32.280 --> 54:38.080]  New COVID hoax, feds, counting adults as children to boost numbers of children infected to create
[54:38.080 --> 54:39.080]  fear.
[54:39.080 --> 54:44.080]  Stay with us, hour number two straight ahead.
[54:44.080 --> 54:47.120]  America and the world should have never been closed.
[54:47.120 --> 54:53.720]  It was all based on WHO, Bill and Melinda Gates, Fauci, NIH lives.
[54:53.720 --> 55:00.880]  But now, here we are already into August and they're trying to keep our stores, our factories,
[55:00.880 --> 55:03.800]  our schools, our parks closed.
[55:03.800 --> 55:05.400]  It is outrageous.
[55:05.400 --> 55:12.560]  Well, we have launched a new big sale titled Reopen America, Back to School Special, 50
[55:12.560 --> 55:20.120]  to 60% off all of our top sellers and double Patriot points at M4WarsStore.com.
[55:20.120 --> 55:24.360]  Despite the fact that our ultimate turmeric formula bodies is selling out, we still have
[55:24.360 --> 55:30.720]  it at 50% off, but for a limited time, living defense, which is beyond probiotics, 50% off,
[55:30.720 --> 55:35.720]  vaso beats, amazing concentrated, beat extract with all of its benefits, selling out, so
[55:35.720 --> 55:36.720]  50% off.
[55:36.720 --> 55:45.880]  And so much more at M4WarsStore.com and your purchase funds the M4Wars, a true 360 win.
[55:45.880 --> 55:50.880]  I've been telling someone just a year ago, that in the middle of 2020, the Democrats
[55:50.880 --> 55:56.680]  as well as many Republican leaders will be calling for the United Nations WHO edict that
[55:56.680 --> 56:03.560]  all Americans wear masks, be a, quote, federal order and mandate.
[56:03.560 --> 56:07.960]  Totally unconstitutional, annihilating states' rights.
[56:07.960 --> 56:08.960]  Think about that.
[56:08.960 --> 56:14.040]  A woman can kill her baby, you pay for illegal aliens' healthcare, but you've got to wear
[56:14.040 --> 56:20.480]  a mask for a virus that killed 20 plus times less than what they said, even if you believe
[56:20.480 --> 56:21.980]  the official story.
[56:21.980 --> 56:27.200]  This is about the WHO, the globe was testing their power through the media, over the federal
[56:27.200 --> 56:30.600]  government to set policy in the United States.
[56:30.600 --> 56:35.200]  This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the Paris Accord and
[56:35.200 --> 56:36.200]  all of it.
[56:36.200 --> 56:37.480]  And by the way, they admit that.
[56:37.480 --> 56:43.520]  They say now your carbon's down, one way or another, you stupid Americans.
[56:43.520 --> 57:04.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:04.800 --> 57:11.040]  CNN took a quick break from its usual programming, encouraging looting and pointless mask wearing
[57:11.040 --> 57:15.800]  outside to take some jabs at this channel, watch.
[57:15.800 --> 57:21.640]  When you see entire media companies essentially exist to tear down Joe Biden, is there an
[57:21.640 --> 57:26.360]  equivalent to that on the left tearing down Trump?
[57:26.360 --> 57:29.000]  There really isn't.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.160]  That's a really good point.
[57:31.160 --> 57:33.800]  Nobody criticizes Trump in the media.
[57:33.800 --> 57:38.520]  And I think what we need more of, people attacking Trump.
[57:38.520 --> 57:43.560]  Turns out the people who work over at the cable news network don't watch it.
[57:43.560 --> 57:45.520]  They watch this channel full time.
[57:45.520 --> 57:49.680]  So we dug up some clips for their edification.
[57:49.680 --> 57:51.480]  It is what it is, Mr. President.
[57:51.480 --> 57:54.880]  It's a pandemic and you are who you are.
[57:54.880 --> 57:57.200]  You don't give a damn.
[57:57.200 --> 58:02.040]  The MAGA hat carries a certain connotation that provokes a conditioned reaction from
[58:02.040 --> 58:05.000]  many people, especially for marginalized people.
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.240]  The word cult has been popping up more and more, you said the president is using mind
[58:09.240 --> 58:10.240]  control.
[58:10.240 --> 58:11.840]  But how is that provable?
[58:11.840 --> 58:13.520]  He does not practice humanity.
[58:13.520 --> 58:15.000]  He does not practice decency.
[58:15.000 --> 58:16.600]  He does not love mercy.
[58:16.600 --> 58:18.640]  He is intentionally unkind.
[58:18.640 --> 58:20.240]  He is mean to opponents.
[58:20.240 --> 58:21.680]  Are you listening?
[58:21.680 --> 58:26.520]  The president of the United States is a fraud and a con man.
[58:26.520 --> 58:31.040]  He's human garbage and he practices mind control.
[58:31.040 --> 58:32.520]  So does Greg Gutfeld, by the way.
[58:32.520 --> 58:35.080]  He practices mind control, that's why the Greg-
[58:35.080 --> 58:38.200]  Oh, to be this dumb.
[58:38.200 --> 58:44.080]  When you see entire media companies essentially exist to tear down Joe Biden, is there an
[58:44.080 --> 58:48.760]  equivalent to that on the left tearing down Trump?
[58:48.760 --> 58:50.000]  There really isn't.
[58:50.000 --> 58:55.760]  And what I would say, it's really a diet of this type of information that a lot of these
[58:55.760 --> 58:57.960]  voters are getting.
[58:57.960 --> 59:00.600]  So wait, there's no anti-Trump network?
[59:00.600 --> 59:03.840]  Wow, even CNN admits nobody watches CNN.
[59:03.840 --> 59:08.280]  But look, even if you despise Trump, you've got to admit this deception dares you to laugh
[59:08.280 --> 59:09.680]  in its face.
[59:09.680 --> 59:12.280]  There isn't an anti-Trump media company?
[59:12.280 --> 59:16.680]  Hell, there might be two dozen with CNN leading the hair on fire pack.
[59:16.680 --> 59:21.000]  The only reason every Trump book goes to number one is because of the two cable networks
[59:21.000 --> 59:27.160]  doing its PR, which explains why two recent massive surveys say media is overwhelmingly
[59:27.160 --> 59:29.960]  biased and cannot be trusted.
[59:29.960 --> 59:35.240]  If only this delusional thinking were relegated to the silly world of politics or Brian Stelter's
[59:35.240 --> 59:36.240]  head.
[59:36.240 --> 59:37.240]  But it's not.
[59:37.240 --> 59:43.280]  The same people who deny this reality deny a lot of far uglier facts, rising murder rates,
[59:43.280 --> 59:48.840]  shootings, looting, property destruction, attacks on the elderly, killings by released
[59:48.840 --> 59:54.440]  felons, attacks on free speech, riots described as peaceful protests.
[59:54.440 --> 59:59.240]  And remember how the media pretended that defunding the police was a reasonable ask?
[59:59.240 --> 1:00:04.400]  For this to succeed, they had a very reality, like Gallup's survey showing that over 80%
[1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:09.640]  of blacks and Hispanics want the same amount or more police.
[1:00:09.640 --> 1:00:12.600]  Funny how the white anchors never bring that stuff up.
[1:00:12.600 --> 1:00:17.060]  But in order for a left-wing view of the world to exist, you must pretend none of that other
[1:00:17.060 --> 1:00:19.000]  bad stuff exists.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:23.320]  Meaning the consequences of left-wing action and democratic leader inaction.
[1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:27.160]  You can thank a media in the left working together to preserve their power.
[1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:31.200]  But, I mean, there are no left-leaning networks or news.
[1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:36.920]  Studies show 92 to 98% of coverage by the Pew Research Center and others are anti-Trump.
[1:00:36.920 --> 1:00:38.120]  But you know what?
[1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:40.040]  That's more gaslighting in mind control.
[1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:41.720]  CNN, Stelter's right.
[1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:46.040]  There's nobody out there on the left or on the anti-American manwagon.
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:52.560]  And of course, he's absolutely right as well, along with Congressman Nadler, that there
[1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:54.800]  are no such thing as Antifa.
[1:00:54.800 --> 1:01:03.760]  I mean, he told us so, here it is.
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:07.480]  That's a myth that's being spread only in Washington, D.C.
[1:01:07.480 --> 1:01:08.480]  About Antifa, in Portland?
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:09.480]  Yes.
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:11.080]  Sir, there's videos everywhere online.
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:12.360]  There's fires and riots.
[1:01:12.360 --> 1:01:17.320]  There's throwing fireworks at federal officers, DHS is there.
[1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:18.320]  Look online.
[1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:22.280]  It gets crazy, Mr. Nadler.
[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:23.280]  So there you go.
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:24.280]  What about Antifa?
[1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:25.280]  I said, that's a myth.
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:26.760]  I mean, it just doesn't even exist.
[1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:31.200]  It's just funded by Soros, the Democrats running around, burning everything down.
[1:01:31.200 --> 1:01:34.160]  So that's what they call gaslighting, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:38.800]  Because Stelter has shows, there is no such a ship of conservatives while he calls for
[1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:39.800]  it.
[1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:43.280]  But then separately, there is no liberal media.
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:45.280]  These people are believing their own BS.
[1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:46.280]  It's called being crazy.
[1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:47.280]  They've officially gone nuts.
[1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:53.040]  Because when you shovel BS, you become a shoveler.
[1:01:53.040 --> 1:02:00.080]  We are selling more privacy pockets a day than we were previously selling in a month
[1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:04.040]  because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google
[1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:07.880]  and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones, even if you opt out of it or get rid
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:09.080]  of the apps.
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:14.600]  People realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your data and using it to control
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:19.400]  your life, sharing it with Antifa, sharing it with Black Lives Matter, sharing it with
[1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:23.600]  the deep state to oppress not just high-profile people, but the general public.
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:28.240]  That's why folks are taking back control of their lives with these little Faraday cages
[1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:32.520]  that you can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell towers to
[1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:35.040]  ping it every few seconds and track your location.
[1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:39.520]  This is the only way to have your privacy and people are taking their privacy back.
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:41.080]  It's very, very exciting.
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:44.680]  They're at $19.95 a piece at infowarstore.com.
[1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:45.680]  We've ordered even more.
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:49.760]  A huge shipment's coming in next week, so get yours now and be part of the movement
[1:02:49.760 --> 1:03:18.720]  to cut Big Brother off.
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:28.360]  We are live.
[1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:31.520]  It is Tuesday, August 11th through the year is 2020.
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:39.000]  We are 83 days out from this historic election and I want to open the phones up starting
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.040]  really the next segment.
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:45.800]  On the subject I raised yesterday and the subject I raised today, so I politely ask
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:52.320]  listeners that are going to call to call in about your take, your view on the Democrats
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:56.440]  and now being in the New York Times at the top Democrat strategy meeting saying we're
[1:03:56.440 --> 1:04:00.120]  going to have the state secede, we're going to have our own inauguration and say Joe
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:04.720]  Biden is the president and then the military will have to decide who they believe the real
[1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:08.800]  government is and they are running around saying the military will then remove Trump.
[1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:13.960]  I mean, that's their next hoax and they haven't gotten in trouble for all the other Russia
[1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:21.560]  gate failures and Ukraine gate failures and grab the pussy gate, you know, all of them.
[1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:28.040]  None of that's worked for them and so like criminals always do, they're doubling down.
[1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:29.600]  How do we respond to that?
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:30.600]  What does the president do?
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:37.680]  And then the other big issue, our video, Band-Aut video went up last night, Gregory's got a
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:44.880]  hundred something thousand views at Band-Aut video, we get it banned last night on his YouTube channel
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:51.920]  saying you have disagreed with the World Health Organization, here's the letter and that is
[1:04:51.920 --> 1:05:05.560]  not allowed and then all he did was source the WHO and other major publications with
[1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:06.560]  their actual numbers.
[1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:10.080]  The whole thing is so documented, it's disgusting.
[1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:14.720]  It's the UN and the PR firms that count people that die of other things as COVID.
[1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:17.880]  They're the ones that said 2.5 million and 2.2 million will be dead in the U.S. alone
[1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:22.480]  and 80 million and 100 million will be dead by now worldwide and it's like not even anywhere
[1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:23.480]  near that.
[1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:26.520]  But let's put up the global death numbers, even when they're John Hopkins, Billamond
[1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:31.400]  Gates, fake numbers, it's a fraction of that and we can punch up that world map.
[1:05:31.400 --> 1:05:38.680]  But we see the societal change being driven by all this, it's absolutely mind blowing
[1:05:38.680 --> 1:05:44.960]  but I have a correction to make at the end of the last hour, I put out fake news and
[1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:49.920]  it was an accident and I apologize and as is customary when I do make a mistake, I correct
[1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:57.800]  it and as is the trend, about 98% of the time when I make a mistake, I downplay something.
[1:05:57.800 --> 1:06:01.960]  I'm always being accused of exaggerating things and when people actually go look into
[1:06:01.960 --> 1:06:04.720]  it, it's far worse.
[1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:09.040]  I said 3 million or on the version of starvation six months ago, the UN says 133 million and
[1:06:09.040 --> 1:06:14.840]  their numbers are accurate in that case because of the COVID shutdown, not because of COVID.
[1:06:14.840 --> 1:06:21.320]  So I showed you a German study, new German study finds coronavirus mortality rate at
[1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:22.320]  0.37.
[1:06:22.320 --> 1:06:28.120]  This is from back in April, it's dropped, remember first it was going to be 5% and 4% and 3% and
[1:06:28.120 --> 1:06:34.960]  2% and then 1% and then this is from April, 10 times less than flawed WHO numbers that
[1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:39.120]  sent global community into panic.
[1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:41.320]  So then I said, hey, pull me the Texas numbers.
[1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:53.600]  This is from the Texas website, 0.032.
[1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:54.600]  What is the death rate?
[1:06:54.600 --> 1:06:56.680]  I'm not a mathematician, I'm not good at math.
[1:06:56.680 --> 1:07:03.680]  What is the death rate then if for the cases they have 0.032 die?
[1:07:03.680 --> 1:07:06.280]  I mean that is unbelievable.
[1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:12.280]  And then you find out, I mean according to that, it's hundreds of times not as bad as
[1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:13.280]  the flu.
[1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:18.240]  Now zoom in on that, we put it on full screen too.
[1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:29.360]  I mean this is just mind blowing, so I'm sorry, I said 0.32, I'm sorry, it's a fraction
[1:07:29.360 --> 1:07:30.360]  of that.
[1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:39.280]  How much smaller is 0.32 from 0.32, did somebody do the math in there?
[1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:40.760]  What fraction of that is that?
[1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:44.400]  Because that's some horrible fake news I put out, God, I don't work for the UN.
[1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:47.800]  I just told you that it's hundreds of times worse than it is.
[1:07:47.800 --> 1:07:51.600]  I'm sorry, I misread it, it wasn't on purpose, I admit it.
[1:07:51.600 --> 1:07:57.760]  It's not 0.32, it's 0.032.
[1:07:57.760 --> 1:08:02.800]  Let's see, the death number is going straight down like a lead balloon, but the infection
[1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:12.080]  rate is going straight up because I just showed you the CDC's own website if you had a bacterial
[1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:21.520]  infection or the flu or a cold the last decade on average, you were going to have the genetic
[1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:24.600]  material that you also had if you had COVID-19.
[1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:32.360]  Oh, and I'm afraid COVID-19 does exist, it's a fast-spreading coronavirus, it's a Camero
[1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:38.160]  that's got lots of new mutations and lots of surprises in it for you if you are rundown
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:44.440]  on zinc, vitamin D3 or C, because any virus can take you down if you don't have that.
[1:08:44.440 --> 1:08:49.760]  Oh, but the CEO of YouTube says there's a lie.
[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:56.360]  There are people on YouTube like Alex Jones who attacked me in the national news by saying
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:02.120]  you need D3, you need zinc, you need E, you need C. They say that's not true, the WHO
[1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:03.120]  says you don't need that.
[1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:08.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, on the back of the bottle or the cereal box, it says that it's essential
[1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:13.040]  and I know the audience knows this, we have new listeners, so it's a public service announcement.
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:17.160]  Essential means you die without it.
[1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:21.800]  Water on average is three days if you're out in the elements, 10 days if you're inside,
[1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:24.920]  not moving around.
[1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:29.240]  Oxygen is about four and a half minutes, some people can live longer, maybe the maximum
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:30.880]  is 10 minutes or so.
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:34.680]  It's my choking you, it's even quicker.
[1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:43.080]  Oxygen is essential, H2O, the hydrogen monoxide is essential, salt is essential, without salt
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:57.400]  you die, vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin C, all of it you must have or any virus or bacteria
[1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:00.480]  will kill you.
[1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:05.520]  But you just heard last hour, the CEO of YouTube say it's not true.
[1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:06.880]  She calls it a cure.
[1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:12.480]  Once you're run down and once you have a viral infection that's already eaten your lungs
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:16.200]  or in the case of polio, eating your nerve endings, you're screwed up, you're probably
[1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:17.200]  going to die.
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:24.880]  But if you are healthy and your cells have what they need according to the NIH website,
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:26.720]  that's why zinc is called essential.
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:38.200]  You cannot have replication of coronaviruses in the cell nuclei if vitamin zinc is found,
[1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:45.760]  and then vitamin D3 and C, and again this is like saying if you throw a month old baby
[1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:47.880]  in the deep end of the pool, it's going to sink the bottom and drown.
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:53.320]  I mean I know I'm like going 2 plus 2 equals 4 and this is your fork and this is your knife
[1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:59.640]  and this is how you eat, but I've had lawyers, I've had FBI agents, I've had them all literally
[1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:04.680]  look at me in the eyes and they go, you're telling me I got to have vitamin C, I'm like
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:08.360]  is this a joke or you're like joking with me, right?
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:16.200]  No, no, our guests come on and they go are these vitamins these cells real?
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:25.120]  I mean the public is so stupid now that that's why this is happening.
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:26.120]  Absolutely insane.
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:30.200]  Yeah, there's this NIH website.
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:34.880]  Zinc is an essential mineral that is naturally present in some foods added to others and
[1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:35.880]  available.
[1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:36.880]  It's a dietary supplement.
[1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:41.440]  Zinc is also found in many colosages and some of the counter drugs sold as cold remedies.
[1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:47.640]  Zinc is involved in numerous aspects of cellular metabolic system is required for the catalytic
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:54.880]  activity approximately 100 enzymes, 1.2, and it plays a role in immune function 3, 4, that's
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:12:01.600]  little sources, protein synthesis, wound healing, DNA synthesis at cell division.
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:05.880]  Zinc also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, adolescence and
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:09.720]  is required for proper sense of taste and smell.
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:15.880]  A daily intake of zinc is required to maintain a steady state because the body has no specialized
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:21.440]  zinc storage system and it just goes on if you don't have it, you die, okay?
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:26.760]  So, you know, and I'm literally, literally talking to lawyers, FBI agents, and they're
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:28.920]  like, they're going, are you really serious?
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:29.920]  Okay.
[1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:32.400]  And I'm like, let me show you, no, we don't want to see it.
[1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:37.880]  I mean, there's like a demon curse where they can't get info, they can't listen, they just,
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:44.840]  I've got family won't listen to me, I just, I can't handle it anymore, it's insane.
[1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:50.920]  They're lying to you, they're frauds, my God, wake up, the people curse for lack of knowledge.
[1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:54.960]  Taking info war's life, pure turmeric extract.
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:13:01.240]  This is taken under the tongue, it is pure turmeric, it goes together very well with
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:06.560]  our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed
[1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:08.960]  in the stomach and intestines.
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:13.120]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:14.680]  then absorbed by the stomach.
[1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:17.280]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:21.840]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates and our first product got rave
[1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:22.840]  reviews.
[1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:24.560]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:28.040]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies, some like bodies better.
[1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:32.600]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more and they fund the
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:33.600]  info war.

[1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:16.560]  I am a shotgun rider, I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto line, the desert is my
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:23.800]  brother, my skin is cracked and dry, I was riding on a cold coast and everything was
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:28.400]  fine till we took a shorter road to save some time.
[1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:37.160]  It's only fired once, they shot me in the chest, they've wounded me but they'll never
[1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:45.280]  get the best of better men, alright again, I love this part.
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:56.000]  I am a river gambler, I make a living deed and cars, my clothes, my car, my heart is
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:03.920]  ripped people off and brainwashed but until people decide to grow up and start being savvy,
[1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:07.360]  stop being sheepled, things are only going to get worse.
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:14.200]  Okay, we can put this on screen, this is a huge exclusive and it's not because even
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:18.360]  one of the producers or writers or researchers found it but one of our computer switchers
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:23.920]  is a really smart guy, he just decided when he saw this article the other day to go actually
[1:16:23.920 --> 1:16:31.840]  read the study and see that's what you need to do, he saw Axios, 97,000 children test
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:37.520]  positive for COVID-19, his school's eye reopening, nobody's dying, not one of them, all the stories
[1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:41.240]  they put out are fake kids, a lot of them don't even exist, you ought to ask wow, why
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:47.920]  is mainstream news putting out fake kids or fake LGBT or because it's a PSYOP, they're
[1:16:47.920 --> 1:16:52.880]  going for broke, why not, you tell a thousand lies, tell a million lies, they're putting
[1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:58.520]  them back on screen, there's the new headline, new COVID hoax, feds counting positive adults
[1:16:58.520 --> 1:17:06.520]  as children to boost fear in parents, one state counting people up to 24 years old,
[1:17:06.520 --> 1:17:13.360]  the others 19, the article's on infowars.com, you scroll down, it's got screenshots of it,
[1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:19.880]  but hey, don't believe me, check it out yourself, this is from Children's Hospital Association,
[1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:29.000]  American Academy of Pediatrics and the NIH, Dr. Kamshaw please, so they say according
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:34.480]  to this, why, there's record numbers and then it turns out 90 plus percent in the data
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:42.280]  from 49 states that report, one I've been reporting, almost all of them are 17 and up,
[1:17:42.280 --> 1:17:49.840]  to age 24, look at the map, yellow is zero to 14, only Florida and Utah report anybody
[1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:59.840]  testing positive, that's under 14, everywhere else is 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, they're counting
[1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:12.880]  people up to 24 in Alabama, Tennessee, they're counting people up to 20, South Carolina to
[1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:25.560]  20, what's Texas doing, up to 19, no, up to 20, does that anger you, yeah, Texas is 19,
[1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:35.000]  I misread that, so there you go, again it's scam upon scam upon scam upon fraud, good lord,
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:41.760]  and Texas remember was saying a 2% death rate six months ago, totally made up, now it's
[1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:58.000]  0.032, but I'll be walking down the hiking bike trail and they'll be 20 feet wide at
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:01.880]  certain points, 30 feet wide, and you'll see women and men up against the wall with
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:08.240]  their masks, someone wearing a mask, I mean these are lunatics, but they're getting into
[1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:16.440]  it, and now you've got a lawmaker in Tennessee calling for people to get jail time for attempted
[1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:20.920]  murder if you don't wear your damn mask, by the way the big approval and they say is
[1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:29.600]  the gold standard, the M95 only protects air coming in partially, not air going out, it's
[1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:37.920]  just an opening, that's what the valves for, total fraud, they want you tried for attempted
[1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:45.520]  murder, open the prisons up and put people not wearing a mask over their face in prison,
[1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:51.960]  when the national death rate that they're now reporting is a fraction of 1% and it's
[1:19:51.960 --> 1:19:57.840]  stacked with fraud, and look I know the mainline talk radio is spending all it's time on Bidens
[1:19:57.840 --> 1:20:02.320]  of Bethune and Biden can't talk and Bidens of Moron and you know they're gaslighting
[1:20:02.320 --> 1:20:07.320]  us and saying he's a rocket scientist and oh look he can ride a bike, that's the big
[1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:12.760]  talking point, I don't get Republican talking points, we create the reality points that
[1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:18.640]  then they pick up if they want to win and save the country, that's why you tune in
[1:20:18.640 --> 1:20:23.640]  here, no everything is COVID, COVID, COVID because it's causing a worldwide depression,
[1:20:23.640 --> 1:20:30.280]  the food chain is already breaking down, we've got nine different manufacturers and four
[1:20:30.280 --> 1:20:35.120]  of them can't deliver our stuff anymore and are breaking down and may just shut down,
[1:20:35.120 --> 1:20:38.840]  some of these companies have been around 40 years, most of them decades, we've got a bunch
[1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:45.120]  of big supply chain, a lot of different companies, we don't just use one, we've got over 50 products
[1:20:45.120 --> 1:20:48.960]  and that's why when you hear me advertise a product we have it's in the warehouse, unless
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:52.520]  it's the storeable food then that's it, four other factories around the company, around
[1:20:52.520 --> 1:20:55.960]  the country and we're partnered with a company that does that, that has high quality and
[1:20:55.960 --> 1:20:59.520]  gets it to you and the people give us rape reviews for us, we want to sell you stuff
[1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:03.240]  that you like, you appreciate us, we appreciate you, it's just simple common sense, you know
[1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:06.320]  like, that a woman you love, you take care of her, you got a man you love, you take
[1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:09.920]  care of her, I mean it's just a relationship that we want, not some fly by night globalist
[1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:15.520]  BS where we get off on screwing somebody, I'd rather blow my head off but when I tell
[1:21:15.520 --> 1:21:19.240]  you there's breakdowns in the supply chain, I'm not just saying that, it's not just in
[1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:25.280]  the news, it's bad and the food prices are going up and a lot of these companies are
[1:21:25.280 --> 1:21:29.280]  like, hey we'll fulfill the order, we want to pay you up front, we used to pay like
[1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:32.840]  you know, part up front, they go listen, our employees won't come in because one person
[1:21:32.840 --> 1:21:37.160]  had it and everybody's panicked and everybody just wants to get welfare now and the trucking
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:40.920]  companies aren't coming and everything's breaking down and it's the same over and over again
[1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:44.920]  and I talked to other people in business, I talked to a guy who manages 40-something
[1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:49.840]  warehouses in South Carolina and around the country where furniture comes in and it's
[1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:54.520]  distributed around the country and he said that they had to shut down most of their facilities
[1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:58.960]  because if they get one case, the union freaks out of the employees do and they all want
[1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:03.040]  to go home and no one's sick but they're all scared, then they get tested and a bunch out
[1:22:03.040 --> 1:22:06.680]  of them have it because it's a fake test and they're all asymptomatic at the meat packing
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:10.720]  plants and the furniture plants and they just leave, everything's falling apart and it ain't
[1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:17.000]  coming back but everybody wants the virtue signal of where they're at mass, walking
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:22.360]  down the street, sometimes I get up at like 5 in the morning and I go out to get donuts
[1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:27.600]  or breakfast tacos or whatever for the family and I mean I was out last week at 5.30 in
[1:22:27.600 --> 1:22:31.780]  the morning and I get the breakfast tacos and I'm driving back to the house and I see
[1:22:31.780 --> 1:22:38.240]  like a person every mile walking dogs with masks in the dark, they're walking around
[1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:46.400]  in the dark with a damn mask on, it's two coo birds man and meanwhile the supply chain's
[1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:51.440]  breaking down, the rest of the world's open for business, they just did Kabuki theater
[1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:54.040]  but we're not, let me give you the number, I want to talk about this, I want to talk
[1:22:54.040 --> 1:22:57.560]  about their plan to overthrow Trump, their plan to have states secede, it's now officially
[1:22:57.560 --> 1:23:01.200]  official, I mean we're talking real civil war, we're just sitting here like sitting
[1:23:01.200 --> 1:23:11.280]  ducks, waiting to see what happens, 877-789 Alex, 877-789-2539, first time callers today,
[1:23:11.280 --> 1:23:20.000]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, we got a guest coming up at 1, I got to move him up behind
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:28.720]  here and then we got to have Roger Stone and Laura Lumer on, there's just so much going
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:31.680]  on here ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to stop busy in complaining, it's just this
[1:23:31.680 --> 1:23:39.240]  has gotten so crazy, 877-789 Alex, 877-789-2539, we got a Facebook whistleblower on and I forgot
[1:23:39.240 --> 1:23:42.240]  we got on and so he was supposed to be on right now but I said I'm going to give him
[1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:45.400]  the number, else we'll do that, if he has to reach Kedger looks fine, I'm sorry about
[1:23:45.400 --> 1:23:50.520]  that problem but I just can't handle it anymore, this is front and center martial law, human
[1:23:50.520 --> 1:24:02.360]  freedom, the wild wild west, the renaissance, America, human liberty, the west built all
[1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:10.400]  the freedom, all the choices, all the empowerment we see, the general population has been programmed
[1:24:10.400 --> 1:24:17.080]  that submission to tyranny brings them prosperity, because the last 50 years under psychotic
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:23.960]  globalist control, they have taught us by successive approximation to bow down and each
[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:30.080]  time be given a reward, a treat, that's like training wild pigs to come eat out of your
[1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:36.760]  hand and finally one day you lead them into the barn and close the door and butcher them,
[1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:43.200]  we're now reaching that point in societal development, where submission is death, where
[1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:49.600]  submission is the human species being destroyed forever on the altar of Satan.
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:53.240]  Another part of the Great Awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been
[1:24:53.240 --> 1:24:58.800]  religious or Christian, now see how evil is out in the open, how hundreds of churches
[1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:05.000]  have been burned in Europe and the US, hundreds of Christian icons have been burned destroyed,
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:08.800]  Jesus has had their heads cut off all over the country, all over the Philippines, all
[1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:13.400]  over Europe, Virgin Mary's are getting torn down, I mean crosses are being torn down,
[1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:18.560]  it's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real,
[1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:23.920]  it is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move, building beneath the surface
[1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:24.920]  and now it's emerged.
[1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:28.680]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it, I'm praying for
[1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:33.320]  America, I'm praying for you and I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it,
[1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:37.560]  we need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening, pray for Donald Trump
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:43.200]  to be protected, pray for him to win a landslide and pray for the people under deception of
[1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:46.200]  the globalists to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[1:25:46.200 --> 1:26:09.320]  God bless you all, please pray for M4s as well.

[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:23.120]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, I'm here live, I'm your host Alex
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:25.600]  Jones, syndicated radio and TV, most banned, the most attacked, the most lied about platform
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:30.160]  on the planet because we study the globalist operations, we know what we're talking about.
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:33.600]  Their program will not succeed if this information gets out.
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:40.200]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday planetary transmission.
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:47.000]  I'm going to go to your phone calls, Aaron, Manny, Mac, Rob and Cooper here in just a moment.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:53.160]  Some of the other news revolver exclusive, former DoD official linked to Biden calls
[1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:56.360]  for Alex Jones' assassination.
[1:27:56.360 --> 1:28:04.160]  And then he falsely went with the news, he just falsely went with the news that was
[1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:08.760]  put out by Right Wing Watch funded by Soros that I called for offensively going out and
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:11.360]  killing looters and people.
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:15.960]  No, I said if the communists were able to overthrow the cities like they did in Russia
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:20.960]  or China, and if they try to go around like Larry Grathwald exposed and start rounding
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:25.600]  people up to kill us, or they come to your houses to kill you, like they now do, or they
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:29.120]  have checkpoints where they point guns at you that's now coming out every few hours,
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:31.360]  that you have a right to defend yourself.
[1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:35.600]  And I said defensively then, you know, take them out if they're trying to kill you.
[1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:41.760]  So they don't show a video, they show edited quotes of me saying kill as many liberals
[1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:42.760]  as you can.
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:44.280]  They'll probably take that quote out and say it.
[1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:45.280]  That's not what I said.
[1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:54.560]  But just if you look at a picture of this fake wannabe, you know, tough guy who again
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:29:00.000]  was one of these people brought in by the deep state, Zachary Tyson Brown.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:02.120]  I mean, what a joke.
[1:29:02.120 --> 1:29:11.040]  What an absolute joke that he wants me assassinated like I'm a foreign terrorist, an enemy combatant.
[1:29:11.040 --> 1:29:13.560]  You know, the enemy combatants are it's the deep state saying they're going to have the
[1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:17.640]  state secede, they're going to overthrow Trump, and they've got the military ready to do it
[1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:19.280]  outside of impeachment and outside of law.
[1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:24.240]  I mean, that's being put out in the New York Times now that at war game meetings, and I'm
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:29.400]  saying if they're able to do that, they're going to come for everybody else.
[1:29:29.400 --> 1:29:38.080]  And the official Austin budget proposal in the budget proposal to blow up the police department
[1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:42.160]  as a symbol of abolishing the police.
[1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:48.000]  And I'm like the last weekend, they had gunman on rooftops and gun trucks going around aiming
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  guns at people.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:54.160]  And I've got roll some of the new video today we've got and then we'll go to the calls
[1:29:54.160 --> 1:30:00.760]  of Indiana and New York and Colorado where people are just driving down the street and
[1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:02.560]  people walk up in front of their truck.
[1:30:02.560 --> 1:30:03.560]  Here it is.
[1:30:03.560 --> 1:30:07.160]  You're just trying to pull the parking lot and a bunch of weird crazy white people who
[1:30:07.160 --> 1:30:11.720]  sit there and even walk up and aim, get in front of your car with guns and the guy tries
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:12.720]  to get away.
[1:30:12.720 --> 1:30:15.520]  They chase them and start saying, don't run me over.
[1:30:15.520 --> 1:30:17.520]  I'm trying to get in front of the vehicle.
[1:30:17.520 --> 1:30:18.960]  Like, do we have this bleep?
[1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:19.960]  Can we play the audio?
[1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:22.560]  There's always so much cussing.
[1:30:22.560 --> 1:30:25.800]  That's what leftists do is they just go F, F, F, F and these people are bringing their
[1:30:25.800 --> 1:30:26.800]  kids with them.
[1:30:26.800 --> 1:30:29.760]  They start it over, start it over at the beginning.
[1:30:29.760 --> 1:30:35.280]  Imagine they're in front of this guy's truck on the road, he tries to go around them.
[1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:36.280]  They stop him.
[1:30:36.280 --> 1:30:45.800]  Oh, he's going to try to run us over, he's trying to get away from them.
[1:30:45.800 --> 1:30:50.680]  So they run in front of him and go, he's trying to get us.
[1:30:50.680 --> 1:30:52.960]  Like people, white people, running, trying to get in front of the vehicle, he's going
[1:30:52.960 --> 1:30:57.440]  to hit us, put their old jump in front of it.
[1:30:57.440 --> 1:31:01.280]  They're like, you're not going through.
[1:31:01.280 --> 1:31:05.080]  So the full video is like they're blocking the access from the highway.
[1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:09.280]  So he tries to go around them and they just keep getting in front of them and aiming guns
[1:31:09.280 --> 1:31:14.680]  at him.
[1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:18.240]  Pure thuggery, just pure absolute piracy.
[1:31:18.240 --> 1:31:22.760]  Imagine if the cops did this.
[1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:25.000]  That's just today's video.
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  And look, I'm sorry.
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:30.120]  A group surrounds my car and points at me, I'm going to just like the Army guy in Nelson.
[1:31:30.120 --> 1:31:36.080]  I mean, I'm sorry, especially if I'm with my children.
[1:31:36.080 --> 1:31:41.280]  And man, if you listen to the audio, they're like, oh no, don't run us over.
[1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:44.760]  It's like that joke video I did a few months ago where we go and jump on the person's car.
[1:31:44.760 --> 1:31:46.680]  That's what they really do.
[1:31:46.680 --> 1:31:49.480]  That's what they're trained to do.
[1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:55.320]  Yeah, there's the headline, local news, Indianapolis traffic blockers threaten motorists
[1:31:55.320 --> 1:31:58.520]  at gunpoint for trying to pass them, call it self-defense.
[1:31:58.520 --> 1:32:01.320]  God, these people, man.
[1:32:01.320 --> 1:32:10.640]  And then they have this individual, deep state veteran Zachary Tyson Brown, who's worked
[1:32:10.640 --> 1:32:17.480]  at the office, Secretary of Defense, as recently as last month, took to LinkedIn to call for
[1:32:17.480 --> 1:32:20.840]  me to be killed like a terrorist.
[1:32:20.840 --> 1:32:24.600]  Tyson Brown shared his seemingly malicious threat with the entire world, but the couch
[1:32:24.600 --> 1:32:27.760]  should just the right way.
[1:32:27.760 --> 1:32:32.560]  And then again, he makes quotes that are his words with only a few of my words edited
[1:32:32.560 --> 1:32:33.560]  in.
[1:32:33.560 --> 1:32:34.560]  Notice, didn't show the video.
[1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:35.560]  Alex, near to the right, we watch.
[1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:40.160]  Alex Jones told listeners last week that his predictions of war against the New World
[1:32:40.160 --> 1:32:41.160]  Order were coming true.
[1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:44.080]  Notice, none of this is quotes.
[1:32:44.080 --> 1:32:48.080]  And that his listeners should try to overcome their fear of death and be ready to kill as
[1:32:48.080 --> 1:32:50.160]  many of them as possible.
[1:32:50.160 --> 1:32:51.800]  That's a real quote.
[1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:55.520]  I said, if they take down the country, set up death camps, start rounding 50 million
[1:32:55.520 --> 1:32:59.600]  of us up as there's official plan, we'll have to take it to the leadership of the Communist
[1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:00.600]  dictatorship.
[1:33:00.600 --> 1:33:03.240]  Abso-fricking-lutely, I said that.
[1:33:03.240 --> 1:33:06.000]  And then this guy pops up and says, we need to kill Alex Jones.
[1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:09.520]  So I guess he's saying he's part of this and he wants to kill me.
[1:33:09.520 --> 1:33:13.320]  And I'm saying, if they come to kill us, we got to defend ourselves and he says, I want
[1:33:13.320 --> 1:33:17.440]  to kill Alex Jones.
[1:33:17.440 --> 1:33:18.960]  See he doesn't get chicken or the egg.
[1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:22.880]  He doesn't get, they're the ones doing all this because see, when they come and point
[1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:26.400]  a gun at you when you're driving down the road and start to stop your car, you're the
[1:33:26.400 --> 1:33:27.400]  bad guy.
[1:33:27.400 --> 1:33:34.600]  See, in this person's world, all right, let's go to your phone calls.
[1:33:34.600 --> 1:33:40.320]  Let's talk to Ryan in California, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:42.920]  Alex, we are the resistance, man.
[1:33:42.920 --> 1:33:46.480]  I'm not going to ask you how you're doing because we don't have that much time.
[1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:51.560]  I will tell you though, when it comes to the food chain and the trucking industry, my father-in-law
[1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:53.280]  is a truck driver here in California.
[1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:58.120]  He is his own, owner, operator, truck driver, so he gets to see a little bit more behind
[1:33:58.120 --> 1:34:01.000]  the scenes of what's going on.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:07.640]  In January of this year, his company filed for bankruptcy saying there will be no more
[1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:12.080]  loads, there will be no more truck driving going on in the future, so they already knew
[1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:13.800]  about it.
[1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:17.160]  So he's kind of hit and miss on looking for loads.
[1:34:17.160 --> 1:34:20.280]  Oh yeah, all the big corporations were already prepositioned.
[1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:25.440]  Yeah, since that time, he has actually, the loads have been half of what they were.
[1:34:25.440 --> 1:34:27.520]  He can't even pay for his own diesel.
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:32.160]  So it's not so much the food chain breaking down, they have the product, the products
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:33.160]  in the warehouse.
[1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:35.320]  But that's why the price is going to go way up.
[1:34:35.320 --> 1:34:38.060]  Yeah, they're not even getting it out to people.
[1:34:38.060 --> 1:34:42.240]  And notice in the first week of the COVID first lockdown, it's all of a sudden the first
[1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:44.600]  week in the grocery store, the shops are absolutely bare.
[1:34:44.600 --> 1:34:46.680]  They have the products already, the products in the warehouse.
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:49.720]  They're just not getting it out there to the people.
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:52.680]  And that's because the warehouse workers, the lawyers run everything.
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:56.640]  So if one person gets sick, they test them, then they go, oh, you've got COVID and they
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:34:58.160]  locked the whole warehouse down.
[1:34:58.160 --> 1:34:59.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:34:59.160 --> 1:35:00.160]  Exactly.
[1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:04.760]  And then all these people think, oh, I'm getting a few months of payroll.
[1:35:04.760 --> 1:35:05.760]  I'm going to sit.
[1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:07.160]  No, there'll be no more job to come back to.
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:11.080]  But see how they got us to sell our birthright, just like with Cain and Abel.
[1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:18.080]  Cain sold his birthright, an entire mountain area, the equivalent of billions of dollars
[1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:21.440]  today for a bowl of soup.
[1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:26.080]  And people are literally selling the infrastructure that everybody built, that it's being shut
[1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:27.080]  down.
[1:35:27.080 --> 1:35:29.960]  It'll take decades to come back for a few months of free goodie goods.
[1:35:29.960 --> 1:35:30.960]  Isn't that crazy?
[1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:31.960]  That is crazy.
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:36.400]  And I'll tell you what, Alex, over here in California, we have a big, strong falling.
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:37.760]  We're not wearing a mask or anything.
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:41.320]  So we're trying to resist just like everybody else, but we need the numbers.
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:45.520]  We need people in California to step up, not say that they're afraid to follow Trump
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:46.520]  or whoever.
[1:35:46.520 --> 1:35:50.800]  We need people to step up, go out to the grocery stores, wear no mask, go out in public, wear
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:51.800]  no mask.
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:52.800]  That's right.
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:53.800]  Cain that we do normal.
[1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:54.800]  We need the numbers.
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:58.040]  So if I go to the grocery store by myself or just with my family, then everybody turns
[1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:00.800]  on me and my family and they always say, oh, you're not protecting your kids.
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:01.800]  Oh, you're not protecting your wife.
[1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:04.200]  And now it'll be, we got to check your phone that you've had the vaccine.
[1:36:04.200 --> 1:36:05.840]  You've got to have the app showing you have the vaccine.
[1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:08.920]  We're being inducted into such evil right now.
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:10.200]  They're going to use the mob against us.
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:12.960]  So we have to start standing up to the mob.
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:15.200]  You know, they always try to come over to me and get in my face.
[1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:18.280]  And then once I get back in there with facts, they back off.
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:19.280]  So God bless you.
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:20.280]  I hear what you're saying.
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:22.760]  But even if you can't get other people to do it, brother, you're going to have to do
[1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:23.760]  it yourself.
[1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:26.560]  You're going to have to educate them, bring like a printout with facts, you know, the
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:30.240]  COVID thing is killing less than 0.033.
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:32.840]  I mean, unbelievable folks.
[1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:33.840]  Thank you so much.
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:40.120]  Robin Kentucky, Mac, James, Aaron, Ivan, Cooper, Travis, Dave, Colin, we're getting all your
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:49.600]  calls and Roger Stone, Laura Loomer and others are coming up.
[1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:51.320]  Let's go to one in Connecticut.
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:52.320]  You're on the air.
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:53.320]  Thanks for holding.
[1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:54.320]  I sure can, sir.
[1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:55.320]  Thank you.
[1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:56.320]  Hey, Alex.
[1:36:56.320 --> 1:37:00.280]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking
[1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:01.280]  right now.
[1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:03.280]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:06.320]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:12.400]  I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive, me and my brothers
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:13.400]  that drive.
[1:37:13.400 --> 1:37:14.400]  There's a couple of us.
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:21.920]  We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that.
[1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:25.800]  I have love's way because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you
[1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:26.800]  for that, man.
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:31.160]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long term, high quality energy powder
[1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:32.160]  there is.
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:34.440]  So this, this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:37.440]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a
[1:37:37.440 --> 1:37:39.640]  lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[1:37:39.640 --> 1:37:43.720]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:45.480]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:46.480]  So that means a lot to me.
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:47.560]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:48.560]  We love you.
[1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:52.000]  America and the world should have never been closed.

[1:38:57.200 --> 1:38:58.200]  them.
[1:38:58.200 --> 1:38:59.880]  All the orders we got in have been fulfilled.

[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:28.600]  an artificial system or will be lab grown even if our parents are allowed to breed.
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:31.480]  It's the plan of the United Nations in UNESCO.
[1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:35.000]  It's the plan of Julian Huxley and Aldous Huxley.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.120]  It's the new world order.
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:42.920]  Our new world is not a science fiction book, it is a future publication in its own words.
[1:41:42.920 --> 1:41:48.960]  Written in 1932, we're now living the beginning of the induction into this, the pod people.
[1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:54.960]  It's not aliens coming from a distant star system, it's humans becoming psychotic and
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:42:02.120]  deciding to farm other humans and behaving like bloodthirsty Martians.
[1:42:02.120 --> 1:42:06.720]  It's the facts and they're using terror to drive you into submission.
[1:42:06.720 --> 1:42:08.720]  It doesn't get you out of this.
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:12.560]  You trust the police department, the fire department, they want to get rid of that with
[1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:16.280]  all its problems and bring in something far worse but you keep trusting the globalists
[1:42:16.280 --> 1:42:21.840]  in the UN like they're the local fire department or police department, I assure you they're
[1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:22.840]  not.
[1:42:22.840 --> 1:42:26.560]  They're evil and they work for the new world order.
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:27.560]  Let's race through your calls.
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:29.720]  There's a lot of people right now.
[1:42:29.720 --> 1:42:32.120]  Let's go ahead and go to Dave in North Carolina.
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:33.120]  Welcome.
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:37.320]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call, I want to throw in a quick poll real quick.
[1:42:37.320 --> 1:42:43.360]  I'm a US Army veteran and I deployed overseas and when I came home and got out, they put
[1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:48.440]  me on a lot of types of drugs to deal with my PTSD and things like that and when I started
[1:42:48.440 --> 1:42:53.560]  listening to your show, I decided that I was going to try some of your supplements like
[1:42:53.560 --> 1:43:00.920]  bodies and super male vitality and after taking those for a couple months, I just wanted you
[1:43:00.920 --> 1:43:06.200]  to know that I now also those drugs that the VA wanted to pump me full of and it saved
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:11.040]  my life, honestly, it saved my marriage so I just wanted to thank you and info wars
[1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:12.040]  for that.
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:13.040]  Well, brother, I want to thank you.
[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:14.440]  I mean, spend a little bit more time on that.
[1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:18.040]  I mean, what happened when you started taking the products?
[1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:26.240]  So with the bodies, I have terrible PTSD from serving over in Afghanistan and whenever I
[1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:30.400]  came home, you know, obviously you're in a war zone and 24 hours later you're at home
[1:43:30.400 --> 1:43:35.920]  with family and so when you come home, you're adrenaline still pumping and you're still thinking
[1:43:35.920 --> 1:43:40.640]  about all those things that got your adrenaline going and all the all the bad things and friends
[1:43:40.640 --> 1:43:47.720]  you lost and it's hard to deal with at times and I was so full of energy and honestly
[1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:52.200]  sad and it's all the time and those are two, two bad things that veterans have to deal
[1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:53.200]  with and combine.
[1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:58.920]  They're terrible and with the bodies, it helped me get so much rest.
[1:43:58.920 --> 1:44:05.280]  I was able to calm down the superman vitality, helped me lose weight.
[1:44:05.280 --> 1:44:07.360]  I feel health here.
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:08.520]  I have a lot more energy.
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:13.640]  I can spend time with my family instead of sleeping because all those drugs that the
[1:44:13.640 --> 1:44:20.880]  pharmaceutical industry industry pump is full of and it just really changed my life for
[1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:21.880]  the better.
[1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:23.480]  Well, let's talk about that.
[1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:28.520]  Everybody knows that tumor is an anti-inflammatory in an antioxidant and just does incredible
[1:44:28.520 --> 1:44:29.520]  things.
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:30.520]  That's why the enemy attacks it.
[1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:33.680]  It's why the UN attacks it, but it's absolutely documented.
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:35.800]  They're trying to patent it and make drugs out of it.
[1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:39.600]  But the biggest thing it does is it flips off a lot of inflammation switches.
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:44.080]  Well, the glands we know under stress, it's super inflamed because they're pumping out
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:46.120]  a lot of adrenaline, a lot of other things.
[1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:52.320]  And so what you talked about is people should research what turmeric does to ovaries, testicles,
[1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:54.360]  the adrenals and the kidneys.
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:55.520]  I mean, go look at it for yourself.
[1:44:55.520 --> 1:45:00.360]  So what you discovered is what super strong turmeric concentrate does.
[1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:02.880]  And wherever you get your turmeric folks, great, get it.
[1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:04.600]  But it has an amazing effect.
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:06.280]  We have the liquid turmeric now.
[1:45:06.280 --> 1:45:11.720]  We have the concentrated bodies, powdered turmeric, and it really is an amazing product.
[1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:14.440]  It's why they have thousands of five star reviews.
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:16.640]  People love it because it really does work.
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:17.640]  Is it a panacea?
[1:45:17.640 --> 1:45:21.120]  No, but my wife plays a lot of tennis in other sports.
[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:23.560]  Her hip really hurts and her elbow.
[1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:26.080]  And she had surgery, didn't help on the elbow.
[1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:28.800]  And she's like, oh, I don't want to, she's like a couple years ago, oh, turmeric, I already
[1:45:28.800 --> 1:45:30.000]  take turmeric doesn't help very much.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:31.760]  She's taking these horse pills.
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:32.760]  She has to take bodies.
[1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:35.560]  She goes, why is this smaller, but works better?
[1:45:35.560 --> 1:45:38.440]  I said, your other one is probably 5% your humanoid.
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:40.400]  This is 95% concentrated.
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.920]  So she now doesn't have to take the Tylenol and the other stuff because this works better
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:45.920]  for her.
[1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:47.240]  So I mean, that's how real this is, brother.
[1:45:47.240 --> 1:45:52.520]  So I'm glad it gave you some of the comfort because it comes through God, it's not a panacea,
[1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:55.800]  it's better for some people than others, but I'm really glad you had that response.
[1:45:55.800 --> 1:45:56.800]  Yep.
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:02.600]  And just to add to that real quick, also, I got out medically with a shoulder injury
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:04.200]  and a knee injury.
[1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:07.840]  And the first surgery that they did was completely unsuccessful.
[1:46:07.840 --> 1:46:12.400]  And they were talking about a second in August of this year was actually supposed to happen
[1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:13.400]  next week.
[1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:17.520]  But since then, you know, since I started taking these supplements, like you said, I
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:19.640]  just feel so much better.
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:24.080]  I don't really think I need to go into the knife again, so if anybody out there is hurting
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:29.080]  and really needs to change their body and change their life, InfoWars is where it's
[1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:30.080]  at.
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:31.080]  And I really appreciate it.
[1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:32.080]  Well, I appreciate you.
[1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:33.080]  One more thing since we're on this.
[1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:39.720]  DNA Force Plus has PQQ and CoQ10 that have been proven to regrow nerves, make telomeres
[1:46:39.720 --> 1:46:43.160]  last longer and regenerate the mitochondrial DNA.
[1:46:43.160 --> 1:46:44.720]  Now, here's the problem.
[1:46:44.720 --> 1:46:47.520]  I was told this when we were developing it six years ago.
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:50.600]  I had a finger that was cut off, so it was still partly numb.
[1:46:50.600 --> 1:46:54.880]  I went on it, back pain hitting about two weeks, and the fingers started hurting because
[1:46:54.880 --> 1:46:56.800]  the nerves literally re-grew.
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:01.160]  Now, that's not in every case, but I got feeling back in my finger and in my back.
[1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:04.040]  But when the nerves are turning back on, it hurts sometimes.
[1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:07.360]  So don't think that, you know, even what God gave us doesn't have side effects.
[1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:08.640]  Now, this is some heavy stuff.
[1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:10.120]  So God bless you, brother.
[1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:14.240]  What was your take, Dave, on the Dems Division and Sparky War?
[1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:21.640]  Well, here's, as a veteran, here's how I feel about them trying to divide and conquer veterans
[1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:26.040]  and active military, most of us, obviously, can't speak for all of us, but most of us.
[1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:29.880]  When we take that oath, we take oath to the Constitution and to protect this country.
[1:47:29.880 --> 1:47:33.560]  We don't take it to a party or to a person.
[1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:38.960]  People get it mixed up that they think that, you know, the military's there to just protect
[1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:41.320]  the president or Congress, and that's not how it is.
[1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:43.920]  We're there to protect the Constitution, and that's what we'll do.
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:49.440]  And I think right now, I think people are silent because they don't think or they don't
[1:47:49.440 --> 1:47:54.280]  believe that it's going to get as bad as we say it is or believe it is, and it is.
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:59.960]  And people need to link up with people in their community as far as the militias go
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:04.680]  and learn how to survive out in the wilderness, you know, find that property that's off the
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:05.680]  grid.
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:08.360]  So you don't have to worry about the masses coming after your thing.
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:09.360]  Absolutely.
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:12.280]  And people know that now because they are trying to make us domesticated.
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:15.960]  And I bless you, Dave, really great testimony for the products, and I appreciate your support.
[1:48:15.960 --> 1:48:20.280]  All right, let's go ahead now and take another call.
[1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:23.720]  Let's talk to who's been home the longest now.
[1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:27.240]  That would be Robin Kentucky.
[1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:28.240]  Rob, thanks for holding.
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:29.240]  Go ahead.
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:30.240]  You there, Alex.
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:31.240]  Yes, sir.
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:32.240]  Go ahead.
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:34.240]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[1:48:34.240 --> 1:48:39.520]  Hey, I listened to your show on Friday, and it was the one where Trump was talking about
[1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:43.760]  how he knows there's a lot of people coming against him.
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:46.520]  Yeah, he said they're trying to take me out right now and they're not going to be successful
[1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:47.520]  is what he said basically.
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:48.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:49.520]  He fired the bat signal.
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:52.680]  I mean, people need to know the normalcy bias is over.
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:53.680]  We're in it right now.
[1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:54.680]  People need to know that.
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:55.680]  Yes, sir.
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:01.880]  But what I was going to say about it is, I'm thinking after he said all that, then he went
[1:49:01.880 --> 1:49:05.640]  through with his executive orders and all the other things, the good things that we're
[1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:10.320]  starting to see this week where he appointed the doctor, hopefully to combat Dr. Fauci
[1:49:10.320 --> 1:49:11.560]  and all that.
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:19.280]  But I'm thinking if he can take that kind of action, especially with this COG and everything
[1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:24.800]  else coming about them gathering outside the White House, if he can take some more offensive
[1:49:24.800 --> 1:49:28.880]  action, I think it could help protect the presidency going forward.
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:29.880]  Absolutely.
[1:49:29.880 --> 1:49:32.600]  The plan, people asked, how did I know three years ago it was the plan when I shot those
[1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:36.040]  videos saying they plan to create a race riot, surround the White House for months, finally
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:38.320]  try to burn it down, drive him out of office.
[1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:41.400]  That's when Soros said it's the plan and now you know this, they're setting it up.
[1:49:41.400 --> 1:49:42.680]  I didn't know when they were going to do it.
[1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:45.080]  I just knew we got their secret documents.
[1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:49.520]  I mean, that's why Soros funded suits against us is we got these secret documents that should
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:50.760]  have him and his son indicted.
[1:49:50.760 --> 1:49:53.760]  I mean, it's a criminal takeover plan.
[1:49:53.760 --> 1:49:57.240]  But one last thing on that.
[1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:01.520]  I'm thinking that the mayor of Washington, D.C. and all that obviously is going to let
[1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:07.760]  them gather and camp in the middle of September and everything, but he's got to somehow override
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:08.760]  that.
[1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:11.240]  Well, yeah, because their aim is not to get a message across.
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:14.600]  It's for siege and to, quote, drive him from office.
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:18.120]  So they can have their demonstration for five hours or whatever, but when they say a bunch
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:22.320]  of communists are going to camp around the White House, it's to provocateur violence
[1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:24.520]  so they have a pretext to riot.
[1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:25.520]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:30.180]  So I think Donald Trump, if you're listening, you really need to take more offensive action
[1:50:30.180 --> 1:50:33.360]  against this because it's going to be the undoing of it all.
[1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:37.520]  Well, look at the little tick that showed up yesterday waving a gun around it, everybody,
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:38.520]  to get killed.
[1:50:38.520 --> 1:50:39.520]  He didn't.
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:40.520]  He got shot.
[1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:41.520]  Now the media saying that was too much force.
[1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:43.800]  He's waving a gun at the Secret Service.
[1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:44.800]  Yeah.
[1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:45.800]  Yeah.
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:49.840]  I just want to encourage everybody we're trying to do with the other color, not wear a mask
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:55.880]  in the grocery stores, even taking pictures with not wearing masks and encouraging people.
[1:50:55.880 --> 1:50:58.800]  There are people who think it's ridiculous as you walk through the store and they're
[1:50:58.800 --> 1:51:02.680]  with you, you just need to give them that bit of encouragement and stand and preach
[1:51:02.680 --> 1:51:06.640]  the gospel because Jesus is the answer and I just wanted to tell everyone that.
[1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:07.640]  God bless you, brother.
[1:51:07.640 --> 1:51:08.640]  Thank you, Rob.
[1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:09.640]  All right.
[1:51:09.640 --> 1:51:10.640]  I'm going to jam in two calls.
[1:51:10.640 --> 1:51:20.280]  Next short segment, I'm going to go to James and I'm going to go to Ivan.
[1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:21.800]  And then we've got a guest pop it in.
[1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:26.480]  There's a whistleblower on this UN directing the Internet now, which is official.
[1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:30.200]  And we're always old, Obama's going to hand it over to the UN, all the big tech follows
[1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:31.200]  orders from the UN.
[1:51:31.200 --> 1:51:34.320]  I mean, that should stop last year.
[1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:38.680]  It should be it's illegal.
[1:51:38.680 --> 1:51:44.360]  Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile
[1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:49.080]  times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[1:51:49.080 --> 1:51:54.320]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self defense,
[1:51:54.320 --> 1:51:57.680]  private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the
[1:51:57.680 --> 1:51:58.680]  world is.
[1:51:58.680 --> 1:52:03.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try
[1:52:03.400 --> 1:52:07.720]  to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as
[1:52:07.720 --> 1:52:12.880]  well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[1:52:12.880 --> 1:52:17.140]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly
[1:52:17.140 --> 1:52:22.600]  and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:27.480]  the elites dominate, manipulate and command if you're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[1:52:27.480 --> 1:52:34.360]  And that's what COVID-19 is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family,
[1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:35.760]  against prosperity and against your future.
[1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:39.840]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:41.960]  August 2020 is here.
[1:52:41.960 --> 1:52:45.320]  It's less than 90 days out from the historic election.
[1:52:45.320 --> 1:52:49.760]  The Chai comms, the EU, Hollywood, the Democratic Party and the blue states and blue cities
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:55.600]  are all battling to keep America shut down and to destroy free speech as well to ensure
[1:52:55.600 --> 1:53:00.920]  their final takeover of the United States by removing President Donald John Trump.
[1:53:00.920 --> 1:53:05.280]  At Info Wars, we're fighting back harder than ever, so your word of mouth and your prayer
[1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:07.080]  is key for the transmission.

[1:53:42.400 --> 1:53:55.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:55.520 --> 1:53:59.960]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:06.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:12.840]  It is so incredible that we posted a video on YouTube last night on the sub-channel.
[1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:18.520]  But the UN, the CDC admitting to COVID is basically a hoax.
[1:54:18.520 --> 1:54:22.200]  That nobody needs to die for them to keep everything locked down and they banned the
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:23.200]  video.
[1:54:23.200 --> 1:54:24.200]  What's up on InfoWars.com?
[1:54:24.200 --> 1:54:25.200]  I hope you'll share it.
[1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:28.840]  I hope you'll get it out because that's what we built Band-Aid video, but let's go to
[1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:29.840]  your phone calls right now.
[1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:34.160]  Who else was I going to go to first?
[1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:37.160]  James in Maine and then Ivan and then Aaron and others.
[1:54:37.160 --> 1:54:38.160]  James, welcome.
[1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:39.160]  Yes.
[1:54:39.160 --> 1:54:40.160]  Hello, Alex.
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:41.160]  How you doing?
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:42.160]  I'm all right.
[1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:44.240]  It's just, I mean, they're saying they're going to have the states secede and have their
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:46.840]  own inauguration and have two presidents.
[1:54:46.840 --> 1:54:47.840]  That's a civil war.
[1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:49.120]  I mean, that's in the New York Times.
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:50.120]  We're in Cuckooland.
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  It's crazy.
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:55.720]  I can't believe we're hearing this stuff, but it's like, I believe that they just want
[1:54:55.720 --> 1:54:59.880]  to, you know, tell them, they have fault, they just want to tell them what they want
[1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:02.600]  to hear over the news and all these things and then it's been going on for the last
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:04.720]  few years, given what they want to hear.
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:05.720]  It's never going to happen.
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:06.720]  I don't believe.
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:14.040]  I mean, you know, it's like, Trump has major colonies going after these human traffickers
[1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:17.200]  and they're all, you know, squatting bricks.
[1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:19.000]  I mean, it's, it's, it is really crazy.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  Oh, no, I agree.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:24.120]  I mean, for Trump, for Trump being surrounded, he is kicking their ass.
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:25.120]  Unbelievable.
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:26.120]  It really is.
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:30.600]  It's like, whether it's the silent majority or whatever you see is rallies and it's like
[1:55:30.600 --> 1:55:34.520]  the people love their president, I mean, well, that's another reason they had COVID-19 is
[1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:35.520]  to shut down the rallies.
[1:55:35.520 --> 1:55:40.120]  Oh, Sturges is bad if Trump has a rally, it's bad or a veteran or a police rally's bad.
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:42.600]  Oh, but the communists, those are good.
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:48.000]  No, it's, it's, it's a total hoax or it's just, it's BS.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  It's fake.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.320]  It's just all this stuff in the past we've had.
[1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:56.680]  I mean, whether it's, you want to talk about A, TEPC or H1N1 and now we're wearing these
[1:55:56.680 --> 1:55:58.560]  masks and things all year long.
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:03.000]  It's like, they already took a year away from us and we're in, you know, house arrest.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  Come on, give me a break.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:08.120]  It's like, the government can do this, stopped us, you know.
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:09.920]  People are doing it because of peer pressure.
[1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:13.200]  Everybody has to get a bullhorn and once a week go out in front of a grocery store, a
[1:56:13.200 --> 1:56:16.800]  church, wherever and say, it's okay to know the truth.
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:21.400]  It's okay to expose it far less died than they said and that most of it's fake numbers
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:24.680]  and that they say the mask are permanent and they want force inoculations.
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:25.680]  Take your mask off.
[1:56:25.680 --> 1:56:26.680]  It's a lie.
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:27.680]  Don't live in fear.
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:28.680]  Thank you so much.
[1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:29.680]  Appreciate your call, James.
[1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:30.680]  Aaron in Texas.
[1:56:30.680 --> 1:56:31.680]  Thanks for calling.
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:32.680]  Hi, Aaron.
[1:56:32.680 --> 1:56:45.560]  So regarding the, the secession and everything, like the previous caller just said, I'm not
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:53.960]  sure that, you know, it may happen that may be too optimistic, but there's the possibility
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:56:57.840]  that it would just, it would just fall apart.
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:56:58.840]  Do you think that?
[1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:02.640]  Well, but see, but see, having the blue states in blue cities, I said this months ago, shut
[1:57:02.640 --> 1:57:07.480]  down the economy and ignore Trump is an example of them taking power in a coup ahead of them
[1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:08.480]  succeeding.
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:13.160]  And then now they're, you could see it, this is all a practice in secession from the central
[1:57:13.160 --> 1:57:14.160]  government.
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:15.160]  You understand?
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:16.160]  Yeah.
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:23.920]  And, you know, it's discouraging, but I mean, I'm not being quiet about anything and
[1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:25.720]  I just feel so frustrated.
[1:57:25.720 --> 1:57:30.600]  Like I'm beating my head against the wall with family, friends, it's just everyone.
[1:57:30.600 --> 1:57:34.800]  Well, you need to explain to them that hundreds of millions are on the verge of starvation.
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:38.840]  You can show them the UN's own admissions and that millions are already starved to death,
[1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:40.920]  basically, because they never say starved to death.
[1:57:40.920 --> 1:57:44.080]  They always die of a virus once they're debilitated.
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:48.680]  And you need to explain to them and say, you understand the dollar is going to die and
[1:57:48.680 --> 1:57:51.840]  we're going to be in a permanent depression because you went along with this.
[1:57:51.840 --> 1:57:54.880]  They're using COVID as the reason to put us into a depression.
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:57:56.360]  Does that make sense?
[1:57:56.360 --> 1:57:57.360]  Yes.
[1:57:57.360 --> 1:58:04.160]  I mean, I'm telling them all this and I feel like, I mean, I don't know what more we can
[1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:09.000]  do other than, you know, BLM has TV commercials.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:15.520]  Do we need to start taking their tactics and putting out the truth on television and internet
[1:58:15.520 --> 1:58:22.680]  and radio and everything that, I mean, I'm calling local news and telling them to go,
[1:58:22.680 --> 1:58:28.840]  you know, do the research on band.video because, I mean, they're hyping it up and it's just
[1:58:28.840 --> 1:58:29.840]  insane.
[1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:33.960]  It's absolutely insane and they're censoring all these doctors and others.
[1:58:33.960 --> 1:58:34.960]  You keep it up, Aaron.
[1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:35.960]  Thanks for holding.
[1:58:35.960 --> 1:58:36.960]  We love you.
[1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:37.960]  We appreciate you so much.
[1:58:37.960 --> 1:58:42.200]  We have a special guest joining us, a Facebook whistleblower and we've got Roger Stone popping
[1:58:42.200 --> 1:58:43.200]  in.
[1:58:43.200 --> 1:58:47.720]  He calls as well for Roy, Joe, Ivan and others.
[1:58:47.720 --> 1:58:57.600]  Vicky Gibbs, 57 year old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated
[1:58:57.600 --> 1:58:58.600]  and then died.
[1:58:58.600 --> 1:59:04.640]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch it'll be innovation.
[1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:05.640]  We know what's going to happen.
[1:59:05.640 --> 1:59:11.560]  It's a blue city, same story yet again, and they say her heart gave out.
[1:59:11.560 --> 1:59:16.320]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record
[1:59:16.320 --> 1:59:19.160]  when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed.
[1:59:19.160 --> 1:59:22.760]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states?
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:27.600]  It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing
[1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:29.680]  an autoimmune response.
[1:59:29.680 --> 1:59:34.600]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you.
[1:59:34.600 --> 1:59:39.120]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[1:59:39.120 --> 1:59:43.320]  In the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading.
[1:59:43.320 --> 2:00:12.200]  We're living in such an incredible time and the Democrats have been preparing a succession
[2:00:12.200 --> 2:00:20.000]  of the states during a contested election and they've said if Trump argues with their
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:24.720]  contested view that the military needs to remove Trump and they've been canvassing the
[2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:26.640]  military to get them ready for that.
[2:00:26.640 --> 2:00:30.320]  I told you that over a year ago, now it's all over the news, now they're in the New
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:38.600]  York Times saying that they're going to succeed and have their own inauguration with Joe Biden.
[2:00:38.600 --> 2:00:40.440]  Nancy Pelosi said that a month ago.
[2:00:40.440 --> 2:00:43.600]  Now it's official that they're wargaming that.
[2:00:43.600 --> 2:00:48.000]  Sounds otherworldly like a COVID lockdown or censorship or this mainstream media and science
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:49.840]  exposed COVID-19 as a hoax.
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:58.800]  This video shows the UN, the CDC, the NIH, the New York Times and Forbes saying they basically
[2:00:58.800 --> 2:01:05.320]  faked this pandemic and others and it says you have disagreed with the WHO, you are censored.
[2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:07.360]  That is to Gregory's and his video.
[2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:15.200]  It's posted at band.video right now, Ryan Hartwig joins us, we just got two segments.
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:24.240]  He has been a Facebook project individual and bilingual content moderator, he's a big
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:31.800]  whistleblower and he has a lot to say about what we saw a few weeks ago, big tech whistleblowers
[2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:41.920]  and other reports on how big tech censoring not just places like Brazil, so Ryan hitting
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:47.360]  all the highlights and with 83 days out and Professor Epstein and others exposing how
[2:01:47.360 --> 2:01:53.240]  Google and others are already shaping the elections, Laura Loomer with her telecom not
[2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:57.680]  letting her campaign send up totally legal text messages to people that have signed up
[2:01:57.680 --> 2:01:58.680]  with her.
[2:01:58.680 --> 2:02:03.200]  Now the telecoms are censoring, there seems to be no limit to this, thanks for joining
[2:02:03.200 --> 2:02:04.200]  us.
[2:02:04.200 --> 2:02:07.480]  Yeah, thanks for having me Alex, it's a pleasure to be here.
[2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:11.760]  The last couple of weeks and the last month have been very busy for me.
[2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:17.680]  We see that Facebook and Twitter are banning people globally, just a quick recap, two weeks
[2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:23.200]  ago we had the Congressional hearing in Congress with big tech, we had the criminal referral
[2:02:23.200 --> 2:02:29.560]  from Matt Gates due to the investigation that myself and Project Veritas carried out and
[2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:35.000]  you know Zuckerberg was in Congress two weeks ago, Matt Gates mentioned my name in Congress
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  in front of Mark Zuckerberg.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:41.560]  I should have said that up front, your investigation with Veritas helped trigger these big events,
[2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:44.680]  they brought you up, what is that like?
[2:02:44.680 --> 2:02:53.040]  Yeah, it's been insane, I think the media attention has been insane, yeah like I feel
[2:02:53.040 --> 2:02:59.000]  honored that Matt Gates was able to mention my name in Congress and yeah because of what
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  I gave Matt Gates, I gave Matt Gates about a lot of documentation that was not in the
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:10.200]  video release, so yeah he has a lot of information that's not available to the public and that's
[2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:12.840]  why he was able to submit that criminal.
[2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:16.640]  So to rephrase this once we can only post this as a video it'll be up front, we have
[2:03:16.640 --> 2:03:21.960]  Ryan Hartwig the big whistleblower from Facebook who gave the blueprint of the censorship and
[2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:29.120]  the fact that Congress has been receiving false testimony or perjury by Big Tech and
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:32.760]  Congress from Matt Gates was able to use that information to blow Facebook and others
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:35.680]  out of the water, so just amazing job.
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:42.040]  Yeah, thank you, yeah and so that was very key and then so that same day or the day after
[2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:49.040]  the Zuckerberg testifying Congress, three of us actually submitted a letter to Congress,
[2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:54.560]  me and two other whistleblowers, Zach Voorhees and Zachary McElroy and the media in Brazil
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:59.800]  really took a hold of my section of the letter because that same week their Supreme Court
[2:03:59.800 --> 2:04:08.240]  actually banned at least 10 conservative voices from Twitter and Facebook globally.
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:12.280]  So that was huge in the news and you were seeing that there on the screen.
[2:04:12.280 --> 2:04:17.680]  So these are the bad guys working with governments to silence people, it's just unprecedented.
[2:04:17.680 --> 2:04:23.920]  Yeah, it's incredible, the president of Brazil's son, Bolsonaro's son actually retweeted me
[2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:29.200]  the other day, they're looking for allies in this fight against global censorship and
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:34.480]  they realized that it is a globalist movement to silence these voices.
[2:04:34.480 --> 2:04:41.640]  Well, you're the expert, how would you describe the landscape, the battlefield right now?
[2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:46.640]  I know some, I know that in a way we're winning the battle in a lot of ways and that's why
[2:04:46.640 --> 2:04:54.120]  they're so desperate with all the riots going on and the pushback from coronavirus.
[2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:59.000]  So I think we are winning the battle overall, but there's a lot of battles that perhaps
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:02.160]  were, we need some help on.
[2:05:02.160 --> 2:05:05.800]  So in Brazil, we need help with the fight going on in Brazil.
[2:05:05.800 --> 2:05:09.080]  I've also talked to people in Argentina.
[2:05:09.080 --> 2:05:13.480]  So I mean, there's some good news, but we have a lot of work to do.
[2:05:13.480 --> 2:05:20.560]  Well, that's it, the whole big authoritarian merger with big tech is evil, it's being
[2:05:20.560 --> 2:05:25.360]  exposed, the Uyghur slave camps that Apple and others have, but then it just makes them
[2:05:25.360 --> 2:05:27.800]  double down and get more authoritarian.
[2:05:27.800 --> 2:05:30.880]  And so it's like, yeah, people are waking up, but then they're just going, okay, we'll
[2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:32.560]  put a gun to your head then.
[2:05:32.560 --> 2:05:37.600]  Yeah, and I mean, it's, they're so bold and blatant that the same journalists that helped
[2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:42.760]  you me expose that censorship for Brazil, two of the Supreme Court justices actually
[2:05:42.760 --> 2:05:47.760]  knew that President Bolsonaro was being wiretapped by North Korea or China, and they did not
[2:05:47.760 --> 2:05:49.000]  tell the president.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:53.200]  So the corruption goes super high, it's at the highest levels in Brazil, and I imagine
[2:05:53.200 --> 2:05:56.000]  in other countries throughout the world.
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:00.200]  And so many times China is the muscle against the nation states.
[2:06:00.200 --> 2:06:05.320]  Three years ago when Trump was just getting in, Gigi Ping was in a debos and there were
[2:06:05.320 --> 2:06:06.320]  headlines.
[2:06:06.320 --> 2:06:10.560]  Gigi Ping will help defeat America and the nationalist says Herman von Rupe head of the
[2:06:10.560 --> 2:06:15.640]  EU and headlines like Gigi Ping will crush America and the Washington Post, you know,
[2:06:15.640 --> 2:06:21.200]  Gigi Ping will destroy Trump and save America and it's like, wow, these people are sick.
[2:06:21.200 --> 2:06:26.000]  Yeah, we see that they're targeting nationalists globally as well.
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:30.480]  Any mention of a nationalist is kind of seen as something that's racist and they were shutting
[2:06:30.480 --> 2:06:34.440]  down nationalist groups on Facebook in Spain and Europe.
[2:06:34.440 --> 2:06:38.840]  And in Brazil, what's really resonating right now is the fact that Facebook and I've documented
[2:06:38.840 --> 2:06:43.440]  this, Facebook doesn't consider a fetus a human life.
[2:06:43.440 --> 2:06:46.960]  An abortion is not a violent death for Facebook.
[2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:51.640]  So that's something that really resonates with the Christians in Brazil.
[2:06:51.640 --> 2:06:57.480]  And let's be clear, nothing against Chinese people, but it's the most homogeneous group
[2:06:57.480 --> 2:07:01.160]  on the planet, except maybe Korea genetically similar.
[2:07:01.160 --> 2:07:05.480]  And they're extremely racist against people that aren't of that group.
[2:07:05.480 --> 2:07:12.280]  So the idea that us just having a nation existing is bad, that actually welds people
[2:07:12.280 --> 2:07:16.560]  together around the American ethos, we're racist, Brazil's racist, one is an incredibly
[2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:21.600]  open society racially, but then China, the most homogeneous country in the world, they
[2:07:21.600 --> 2:07:24.080]  are, they're the good guys.
[2:07:24.080 --> 2:07:29.520]  Yeah, and we see that Brazilians, the people I talked to, they recognize that China is
[2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:34.240]  a threat to their country, to their sovereignty as a country.
[2:07:34.240 --> 2:07:39.840]  I mean, I'm sorry, this footage looks like, you know, Clone Wars or something.
[2:07:39.840 --> 2:07:46.240]  I mean, it looks like clones and I'm, I mean, look at this, but we're racist, folks.
[2:07:46.240 --> 2:07:47.240]  Yeah.
[2:07:47.240 --> 2:07:49.440]  Yeah, it's true.
[2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:52.360]  You know, that's one of their main attacks is they try to label people who they disagree
[2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:54.360]  with as racist, for sure.
[2:07:54.360 --> 2:07:57.440]  Well, all I'm saying is nothing against people in their own group.
[2:07:57.440 --> 2:07:59.760]  I think Israel is the right to exist, all this stuff.
[2:07:59.760 --> 2:08:02.080]  But I mean, I'm not against people that are of a certain group having a homeland.
[2:08:02.080 --> 2:08:03.080]  I'm all for it.
[2:08:03.080 --> 2:08:06.000]  I mean, they're the most populous population in the world.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  They kill the centers.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:10.520]  Genetically, they're the most similar people on earth, except maybe Koreans.
[2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:13.560]  And then they're going to, exactly, they're going to fund this race war narrative in America
[2:08:13.560 --> 2:08:14.560]  that we're bad.
[2:08:14.560 --> 2:08:17.200]  They're using our diversity against us is what they're doing.
[2:08:17.200 --> 2:08:18.200]  Yeah.
[2:08:18.200 --> 2:08:22.760]  And China's influence with Facebook, I mean, it can be seen now with the NBA, but, you
[2:08:22.760 --> 2:08:27.000]  know, people are asking me, what's the influence with China with Mark Zuckerberg?
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:28.320]  And we know there is an influence.
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:33.480]  We know there's the money coming from China that's funding the DNC, that's funding all
[2:08:33.480 --> 2:08:39.920]  these leftist groups with the goal to destroy the United States.
[2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:40.920]  You watch this footage.
[2:08:40.920 --> 2:08:42.360]  This is not episode three.
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:45.480]  This is not episode two of Star Wars, the Clone Wars.
[2:08:45.480 --> 2:08:50.120]  This is not Obi-Wan Kenobi expecting the Emperor's new drones.
[2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:54.320]  This is China, ladies and gentlemen, there you go.
[2:08:54.320 --> 2:08:55.320]  Look at that.
[2:08:55.320 --> 2:08:56.320]  Almost identical.
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:08:57.320]  Look at the look, everything.
[2:08:57.320 --> 2:09:00.120]  He is programming right there.
[2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:01.720]  How cultic is that though?
[2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:03.920]  I mean, imagine if some church had people acting like that.
[2:09:03.920 --> 2:09:04.920]  You say it's a damn cult.
[2:09:04.920 --> 2:09:05.920]  Look at that.
[2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:08.920]  That's a communist death cult right there.
[2:09:08.920 --> 2:09:11.920]  All right, brother.
[2:09:11.920 --> 2:09:12.920]  Yeah.
[2:09:12.920 --> 2:09:13.920]  Go ahead.
[2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:14.920]  I don't know.
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:15.920]  Yeah.
[2:09:15.920 --> 2:09:18.760]  So yeah, just wanted to get on the show, talk to you about that.
[2:09:18.760 --> 2:09:19.760]  It's huge.
[2:09:19.760 --> 2:09:23.760]  I think it's great that we're talking about this, you know, that we're making some progress
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:24.760]  in Congress.
[2:09:24.760 --> 2:09:26.200]  I'm working on a book right now.
[2:09:26.200 --> 2:09:29.000]  I hope I can release it before the election.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.480]  But this censorship, as I mentioned, it's global.
[2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:35.200]  I've done interviews in Canada and Spain, Brazil, Columbia, Argentina.
[2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:39.240]  Well, let's talk about what leaders like Bolsonaro and Trump need to do as one of the
[2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:40.920]  top experts out there.
[2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:44.280]  We're so honored to have Ryan Hartwig on with us, stay with us, give you his websites
[2:09:44.280 --> 2:09:45.280]  and more on the other side.
[2:09:45.280 --> 2:09:47.960]  I actually bought this in blocks, UHF frequencies.
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:54.040]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:10:01.120]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a
[2:10:01.120 --> 2:10:02.120]  battery.
[2:10:02.120 --> 2:10:08.600]  Now, with the InfoWars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:09.600]  Excellent.
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:16.680]  Now, I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want, and you can too
[2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:19.960]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:10:19.960 --> 2:10:27.200]  Internet agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now, contact tracers are all tracking
[2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:30.440]  your every move through your mobile phone.
[2:10:30.440 --> 2:10:35.720]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[2:10:35.720 --> 2:10:45.160]  Support the InfoWars and get your InfoWars privacy pouch today, infowarstore.com.
[2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:49.360]  One of our best selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:52.680]  months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[2:10:52.680 --> 2:10:55.880]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:10:58.880]  you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[2:10:58.880 --> 2:11:00.040]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[2:11:00.040 --> 2:11:03.080]  Hey, look, in January 2016, I went into a hospital.
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:06.960]  I went into VA hospital out here in Boyce, and I was in there until June, and one of
[2:11:06.960 --> 2:11:12.240]  the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to InfoWars three hours a day,
[2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:15.960]  and I kept hearing Dr. Groob and all you guys talking about Living Defense.
[2:11:15.960 --> 2:11:20.360]  Let me tell you something, man, I had an internal digestive problem, and I suffered with it
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:24.080]  for about five or six years, and the doctors, they tried every test.
[2:11:24.080 --> 2:11:27.440]  Nobody could figure out what it is, and then every day, when I kept hearing you and Dr.
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:30.640]  Groob and those commercials, I said, you know what, I'm going to get me some of that freaking
[2:11:30.640 --> 2:11:31.640]  Living Defense.
[2:11:31.640 --> 2:11:34.520]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff,
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:38.480]  but I ordered it, and it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:39.480]  taking it, man.
[2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:41.160]  That stuff changed my life.
[2:11:41.160 --> 2:11:42.160]  It saved my life.
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:48.440]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[2:11:48.440 --> 2:12:05.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:13.520]  The article just went live on InfoWars.com, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:20.440]  Journalist claims America now a SH-T whole country under Trump because we have the most
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:24.280]  COVID cases because they do 100 times more fake testing here.
[2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:25.280]  It's all on record.
[2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:27.680]  The CDC says almost all the tests are fake.
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:36.600]  The death rate is now at 0.032 or lower, but it's all about infection right now.
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:37.600]  This is crazy.
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:40.200]  China is open for business, but we aren't.
[2:12:40.200 --> 2:12:44.400]  Here they are on MSNBC celebrating it.
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:50.440]  It's just appalling and shocking, really, that we're in this position, but this is where
[2:12:50.440 --> 2:12:51.440]  we are.
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:13:03.440]  We are the SH-T whole country that nobody wants people from.
[2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:04.440]  That's what they say.
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:05.840]  They say, and so is Brazil.
[2:13:05.840 --> 2:13:06.840]  Why?
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:09.600]  We're the worst because Brazil and the U.S. don't control our medical system.
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:13.240]  The corporates do, and so they're telling us we're the worst when we're not.
[2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:15.040]  It's all made up.
[2:13:15.040 --> 2:13:24.760]  Major whistleblower Ryan Hartwig, find him at patreon.com.org.
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:27.520]  So much of that committee meeting we saw last week was because of his work and Project
[2:13:27.520 --> 2:13:32.200]  Veritas' work, and others who really owe him a debt of gratitude for going public.
[2:13:32.200 --> 2:13:34.880]  But remember just a year or so ago, they were denying censorship.
[2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:39.200]  Now it's out in the open, and the UN directs what Google and others do.
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:42.120]  How does Congress counter this with only 83 days left?
[2:13:42.120 --> 2:13:48.440]  Yeah, I mean, it's going to be a tough job for Congress to combat this in such a short
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:50.160]  period of time.
[2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:56.720]  We have a couple of congressmen who step forward, who are fighting against it, you know, rep
[2:13:56.720 --> 2:13:57.720]  Matt Gaetz.
[2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:06.760]  But we also saw in that hearing two weeks ago that Senator Brenner thinks that you shouldn't
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:10.840]  be punished for having a successful company referring to big tech.
[2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:16.840]  And we had that leaked memo the night before from Mike Cernovich that gave those talking
[2:14:16.840 --> 2:14:23.000]  points from Jim Jordan, and you know, Senator Brenner basically repeated those talking points,
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:27.200]  allowing big tech to continue with their stranglehold on the Internet.
[2:14:27.200 --> 2:14:31.480]  So yeah, like I said, it's going to be a tough job for Congress to deal with.
[2:14:31.480 --> 2:14:36.200]  Well, they're abusing their monopoly power, and Gaetz three years ago was for censorship.
[2:14:36.200 --> 2:14:37.200]  Now he's away.
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:41.040]  Josh Hawley is doing a great job with the Senate, Senator Cotton, we need direct action
[2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:45.560]  now, though, against this, because again, now because Congress isn't involved protecting
[2:14:45.560 --> 2:14:48.480]  our rights, you know, law doesn't take things away.
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:51.280]  It actually protects it if it's First Amendment, Second Amendment.
[2:14:51.280 --> 2:14:52.280]  We need a protection.
[2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:53.440]  We need it now.
[2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:54.440]  Yeah.
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:15:00.600]  And the law states that the powers that Congress gave, you know, big tech from the section
[2:15:00.600 --> 2:15:04.840]  230, they called it good Samaritan law, and then they should be doing it in good faith.
[2:15:04.840 --> 2:15:07.480]  They're clearly demonstrating they're not doing it in good faith.
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:11.400]  And so we can maybe change some of the wording that is used in that law, instead of, you
[2:15:11.400 --> 2:15:16.600]  know, the wording offense, or some of the words are very vaguely and broadly interpreted
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:18.200]  by judges and courts.
[2:15:18.200 --> 2:15:20.720]  So that's something we could do is maybe change a few words to give it.
[2:15:20.720 --> 2:15:26.080]  It needs to be if it's not illegal, and it's a third party comment or posting on a subpage,
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:28.200]  you don't remove it if it is not illegal.
[2:15:28.200 --> 2:15:29.680]  I mean, I mean, I mean, it's that simple.
[2:15:29.680 --> 2:15:30.680]  And that's what the Internet was like.
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:31.680]  It's how it worked.
[2:15:31.680 --> 2:15:32.680]  It made it huge, successful.
[2:15:32.680 --> 2:15:35.280]  Now it's all selectively enforced.
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:39.680]  Yeah, it's enforcement.
[2:15:39.680 --> 2:15:42.960]  So I don't know how far these executive orders will take us.
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:44.760]  I know there's some legislation used by Rep.
[2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:51.720]  Paul Gosar of Arizona as well as a way to, you know, limit basically what they're doing
[2:15:51.720 --> 2:15:52.720]  because Facebook-
[2:15:52.720 --> 2:15:56.840]  Well, what about the pass the first amendment issue and the prior restraint issue?
[2:15:56.840 --> 2:16:02.120]  They're surveilling you in live time with third party groups giving them blacklist like
[2:16:02.120 --> 2:16:04.640]  way beyond what McCarthy ever imagined.
[2:16:04.640 --> 2:16:05.640]  This is for real.
[2:16:05.640 --> 2:16:10.640]  This is AI book burning going on in live time and it's surveilling people, violating their
[2:16:10.640 --> 2:16:14.760]  privacy right there and the monopoly practices of them buying up all the companies and this
[2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:16.200]  is out of control.
[2:16:16.200 --> 2:16:17.200]  Yeah.
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:19.840]  And then in Facebook, even has a policy.
[2:16:19.840 --> 2:16:23.000]  It's called the fire brigade where certain accounts are business accounts and cannot
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:24.360]  be deleted.
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:29.680]  So they give for certain protections to other certain accounts, obviously Josh Fowerstein
[2:16:29.680 --> 2:16:34.080]  or other large conservative accounts get deleted when you're an establishment person, you're
[2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:36.760]  immune from all the regular censorship.
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:37.760]  Yeah.
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:38.760]  Yeah.
[2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:43.720]  You're basically essentially immune by this says shielded by fire brigade.
[2:16:43.720 --> 2:16:48.760]  This content is protected by a high pry IPX check past the contents of the appropriate
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:49.760]  queue.
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:50.760]  So I can't, I can't do anything with it.
[2:16:50.760 --> 2:16:55.840]  I have to escalate it to the fire brigade, like the PR fire team.
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:16:58.600]  So certain accounts have that protection, obviously none of those conservative accounts
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:16:59.840]  have that protection.
[2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:03.440]  Well, that's how it works when, you know, when I was at YouTube with five billion views,
[2:17:03.440 --> 2:17:07.480]  they wanted to work with us that was political, their normal complaints and things wouldn't
[2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:08.720]  do anything.
[2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:11.880]  But then as soon as I didn't play ball and got with Trump, that it was just like, okay,
[2:17:11.880 --> 2:17:17.280]  you're done because they couldn't figure out because I was against war and stuff.
[2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:18.800]  Was I liberal or was that conservative?
[2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:21.440]  But as soon as Trump came on, they're like, okay, you're done.
[2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:22.440]  You're done.
[2:17:22.440 --> 2:17:26.400]  So they cherry picked a few things I'd set out of context to say, oh, his identity, Sandy
[2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:30.520]  Hook, which I barely ever talked about, he's attacking families right now.
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:31.600]  We got to take him off the internet.
[2:17:31.600 --> 2:17:32.600]  He's sending people there.
[2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:34.360]  They had a frontline piece two weeks ago.
[2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:35.640]  Jones keeps attacking us.
[2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:37.240]  He won't stop coming to our houses.
[2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:38.240]  They show some crazy woman.
[2:17:38.240 --> 2:17:39.640]  I don't even know who she is.
[2:17:39.640 --> 2:17:40.720]  She works for Jones.
[2:17:40.720 --> 2:17:41.720]  He's center.
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:43.800]  I mean, it's like, we got to, you know, it's what's like this.
[2:17:43.800 --> 2:17:47.160]  They claim I'm yelling fire in a theater, but they're the ones yelling it.
[2:17:47.160 --> 2:17:48.160]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[2:17:48.160 --> 2:17:49.160]  Yeah, no.
[2:17:49.160 --> 2:17:52.920]  And I was where I was there when they created the new policy against making claims about
[2:17:52.920 --> 2:17:53.920]  crisis actors.
[2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:59.720]  So they created a new policy just for David Hogg, where anybody making a claim about a
[2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:03.400]  crisis actor conspiracy that gets deleted instantly.
[2:18:03.400 --> 2:18:08.080]  By the way, yeah, yeah, they took my YouTube channel down at first saying, I said, Hogg
[2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:09.200]  was a crisis actor.
[2:18:09.200 --> 2:18:10.640]  I never said that.
[2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:11.640]  So that's what I'm saying.
[2:18:11.640 --> 2:18:16.280]  The new thing is to say there's a policy and then say you violated it.
[2:18:16.280 --> 2:18:19.600]  And I think that Florida shooting happened.
[2:18:19.600 --> 2:18:22.440]  So they say, though, that I say it didn't.
[2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:23.440]  Yeah.
[2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:27.240]  And once you're banned from a platform, they can say whatever they want, you can't counter
[2:18:27.240 --> 2:18:28.240]  it.
[2:18:28.240 --> 2:18:29.240]  So you see what I'm saying?
[2:18:29.240 --> 2:18:33.360]  They ban you to steal your identity and then say you're saying things you didn't say.
[2:18:33.360 --> 2:18:34.360]  Does that make sense?
[2:18:34.360 --> 2:18:35.360]  Yeah.
[2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:36.360]  Yeah.
[2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:37.360]  Because you can't fight back.
[2:18:37.360 --> 2:18:38.360]  Yeah.
[2:18:38.360 --> 2:18:39.360]  There's no way to fight back.
[2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:40.360]  Yeah.
[2:18:40.360 --> 2:18:43.200]  And we see the clear example of this as well.
[2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:44.640]  So I can call someone a Trump Humber.
[2:18:44.640 --> 2:18:49.200]  If I call Alex Jones, Alex, a Trump Humber on Facebook and he reports it, stays up.
[2:18:49.200 --> 2:18:55.800]  And if I call Alex Jones a snowflake on Facebook, it gets deleted.
[2:18:55.800 --> 2:18:57.400]  And there's always new terms aren't allowed.
[2:18:57.400 --> 2:19:00.800]  Well, listen, I know you've got a blueprint, the same blueprint you sent Congress.
[2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:03.040]  Will you send us a 20 talking points?
[2:19:03.040 --> 2:19:05.400]  I don't usually do this, but you're the expert.
[2:19:05.400 --> 2:19:08.440]  You've got files that you want to show that you can't show.
[2:19:08.440 --> 2:19:13.200]  If you would send us a whole list of what you wanted to put on screen to walk us through,
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:16.560]  this is a moderator to give us the inside view like you gave gates where as much as
[2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:17.560]  you can show.
[2:19:17.560 --> 2:19:20.280]  I'm going to have you back for a full hour to really drill into your expertise.
[2:19:20.280 --> 2:19:24.080]  So if I'm just up here asking you questions, you know, it's kind of like you're throwing
[2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:27.880]  pearls before swine, not the audience, but you know, myself, because I know you can
[2:19:27.880 --> 2:19:31.280]  really give us technically how they're perjuring themselves to Congress.
[2:19:31.280 --> 2:19:32.280]  Yeah.
[2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:33.920]  I can try to get you some more documents.
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:37.800]  Just kind of the thought process, because it's exactly, I'm saying we're going to go
[2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:40.400]  like do a PowerPoint for us kind of live on air.
[2:19:40.400 --> 2:19:41.400]  Now we're going to go here.
[2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:42.400]  Now we're going to go there.
[2:19:42.400 --> 2:19:44.760]  That way you'll have the floor and people can really get some value out of it.
[2:19:44.760 --> 2:19:45.760]  That makes sense.
[2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:46.760]  Yeah.
[2:19:46.760 --> 2:19:47.760]  Yeah.
[2:19:47.760 --> 2:19:48.760]  I'll work on that for you.
[2:19:48.760 --> 2:19:49.760]  Yeah.
[2:19:49.760 --> 2:19:50.760]  All right, brother.
[2:19:50.760 --> 2:19:51.760]  We're out of time in 45 seconds.
[2:19:51.760 --> 2:19:52.760]  What else do you want to impart to folks?
[2:19:52.760 --> 2:19:55.360]  Ryan Hartwig, what do they visit to find your great work?
[2:19:55.360 --> 2:19:56.360]  Yeah.
[2:19:56.360 --> 2:19:58.640]  So you, my blog is just ryanhartwig.org.
[2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:00.280]  I'm on Twitter.
[2:20:00.280 --> 2:20:01.960]  My Twitter feed blew up in Brazil.
[2:20:01.960 --> 2:20:06.960]  I have like 15,000 followers now on Twitter, but a real Ryan Hartwig and then ryanhartwig.org.
[2:20:06.960 --> 2:20:08.480]  There's a GoFundMe as well.
[2:20:08.480 --> 2:20:12.920]  But you can find all the links on my Twitter and I also have a Patreon.
[2:20:12.920 --> 2:20:13.920]  So any help is, is, is.
[2:20:13.920 --> 2:20:18.440]  And we need to celebrate whistleblowers so that more people do it.
[2:20:18.440 --> 2:20:22.560]  Well, thanks for getting Congress to take action.
[2:20:22.560 --> 2:20:25.920]  You were instrumental in that and thank God for Project Veritas.
[2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:26.920]  Ryan Hartwig.
[2:20:26.920 --> 2:20:27.920]  Thank you so much.
[2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:28.920]  ryanhartwig.org.
[2:20:28.920 --> 2:20:29.920]  Ryan Hartwig.org.
[2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:30.920]  Thank you, Ryan.
[2:20:30.920 --> 2:20:31.920]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:20:31.920 --> 2:20:32.920]  All right.
[2:20:32.920 --> 2:20:36.240]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone and Laura Loomer.
[2:20:36.240 --> 2:20:39.040]  She just got banned from being able to use text messages.
[2:20:39.040 --> 2:20:40.040]  Yeah.
[2:20:40.040 --> 2:20:41.040]  That's right.
[2:20:41.040 --> 2:20:42.040]  How dare you run for Congress?
[2:20:42.040 --> 2:20:47.040]  I talked to the EMS and I talked to the medical doctors and they went, make sure you're nauseated.
[2:20:47.040 --> 2:20:48.040]  It's not just the smell of piss.
[2:20:48.040 --> 2:20:49.040]  But we call the smell of bum piss.
[2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:50.040]  It has this sweet nauseating smell.
[2:20:50.040 --> 2:20:51.040]  Yeah.
[2:20:51.040 --> 2:20:52.040]  Some say it's sweet.
[2:20:52.040 --> 2:20:53.040]  Well, it does.
[2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:54.040]  It's a sweet, sweet stench.
[2:20:54.040 --> 2:20:55.040]  Like I'm going to throw it like you're on the beat.
[2:20:55.040 --> 2:20:59.040]  It is, it is the crap of dust mites.
[2:20:59.040 --> 2:21:03.600]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss in your leftist run neighborhoods?
[2:21:03.600 --> 2:21:07.400]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing.
[2:21:07.400 --> 2:21:10.480]  And InfoWarsStore has the solution.

[2:22:03.680 --> 2:22:04.880]  This is a concentrated toothpaste.
[2:22:04.880 --> 2:22:06.560]  It doesn't have all the fillers.
[2:22:06.560 --> 2:22:07.560]  It is amazing.
[2:22:07.560 --> 2:22:10.280]  Folks have loved the other toothpaste that he's developed.

[2:22:41.480 --> 2:22:44.000]  Thanks dad for all your support.
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:48.080]  Introducing InfoWarsLife Pure Turmeric Extract.
[2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:50.520]  This is taken under the tongue.
[2:22:50.520 --> 2:22:52.720]  It is pure turmeric.
[2:22:52.720 --> 2:22:57.720]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as
[2:22:57.720 --> 2:23:02.080]  a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[2:23:02.080 --> 2:23:06.240]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is
[2:23:06.240 --> 2:23:10.360]  then absorbed by the stomach so it's more of an intense delivery system.
[2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:14.680]  The two formulas are different but both are concentrated and our first product got rave
[2:23:14.680 --> 2:23:15.680]  reviews.
[2:23:15.680 --> 2:23:17.640]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[2:23:17.640 --> 2:23:19.880]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[2:23:19.880 --> 2:23:21.160]  Some like bodies better.
[2:23:21.160 --> 2:23:25.680]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more and they fund the
[2:23:25.680 --> 2:23:26.680]  InfoWars.
[2:23:26.680 --> 2:23:32.280]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com today, an additional 25%

[2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:46.600]  Get yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[2:23:46.600 --> 2:23:56.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:56.560 --> 2:23:59.200]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:23:59.200 --> 2:24:06.680]  This is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[2:24:06.680 --> 2:24:12.880]  Well, she's been there many times with myself, many times when I wasn't there, camped out
[2:24:12.880 --> 2:24:17.080]  in Congress, getting into the committee hearings and exposing the fact that they were lying
[2:24:17.080 --> 2:24:18.080]  about the censorship.
[2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:22.240]  Here's one of the most famous cases of Laura Loomer warning the American people about their
[2:24:22.240 --> 2:24:24.480]  birthright being stolen.
[2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:31.040]  She recognizes the order.
[2:24:31.040 --> 2:24:35.280]  Because Jack Dorsey is trying to influence the election to sway the election.
[2:24:35.280 --> 2:24:36.280]  What she's saying?
[2:24:36.280 --> 2:24:37.280]  What?
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:38.280]  You're the election.
[2:24:38.280 --> 2:24:40.280]  That is why you're censoring and shadowing the election.
[2:24:40.280 --> 2:24:41.280]  How about it then?
[2:24:41.280 --> 2:24:42.280]  12 and a half, 15.
[2:24:42.280 --> 2:24:44.800]  7 and a half, $20, $2 and a half, $7 and a half, $30.
[2:24:44.800 --> 2:24:49.400]  Get $30 down here to that half, $3 and a half, $7 and a half, $7 and a half, $4 and a half,
[2:24:49.400 --> 2:24:52.880]  $4 and a half, $5 and a half, $7 and a half, $5 and a half, $5 and a half, $5 and a half.
[2:24:52.880 --> 2:24:55.400]  This is where you escort this young lady out please.
[2:24:55.400 --> 2:25:00.320]  Get two and a half and a half, $5, $5, $7 and a half, $7 and a half, $8 and a half, $5,
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:01.880]  $8 and a half, $9 and a half.
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:07.080]  And you've got the insane congressman speaking over the enemy, the American citizen who'd
[2:25:07.080 --> 2:25:13.020]  been censored off Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, bed and breakfasts, hotels, and the media
[2:25:13.020 --> 2:25:16.520]  just celebrates it.
[2:25:16.520 --> 2:25:22.200]  Not since Nazi Germany have we seen people not allowed to buy and sell or travel or live.
[2:25:22.200 --> 2:25:27.160]  People overuse the Nazi analogies, but big tech in their control is that well now Comcast
[2:25:27.400 --> 2:25:34.320]  Bands Laura Loomer from sending texts and emails to voters legally through her campaign site over the telecom
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:39.360]  Because the Democrats is running against they had many polls is a heavy investor
[2:25:39.360 --> 2:25:44.800]  So now they're into your text messages. They're into your telecom. Imagine. Oh, well, they're a private company
[2:25:44.800 --> 2:25:48.000]  They're allowed to listen to you and control what you're doing and then block it
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:54.560]  Laura Loomer joins us Roger Stones, but on the road with her also helping with their campaign former Trump advisor
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:25:56.160]  They'll be popping in coming up as well
[2:25:56.160 --> 2:26:03.120]  So you're way ahead in all the polls against the Republican unless there's total fraud you're gonna win the primary you're ahead of the other guy
[2:26:03.720 --> 2:26:08.760]  That the Democrat many polls so they're really scared Laura Loomer. They're really scared
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:17.320]  Yeah, they definitely are and there was a lot of press about my campaign this week because I've officially raised over
[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:22.680]  1.1 million dollars and I've managed to do that while being completely deep platformed
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:26.480]  Alex my campaign is the only deep platforms campaign in the nation
[2:26:26.480 --> 2:26:33.400]  We can't use Facebook Twitter Instagram or PayPal and we're raising more money than a lot of candidates who have access to those
[2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:40.080]  Sites and when I filed to run for Congress people on the left and the right mocked me and said that I had no chance and that I would
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:42.600]  I wouldn't even win my right like they laughed at Trump
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:50.360]  Right and I've raised way more than a dime. Obviously. I've raised over a million dollars and I'm set to win my primary on August 18th
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:51.960]  and so
[2:26:51.960 --> 2:26:54.920]  they're definitely launching attacks against me and
[2:26:55.560 --> 2:27:00.640]  Yesterday after I had received the endorsement from Congressman Matt Gaetz and Roger Stone
[2:27:01.640 --> 2:27:07.480]  After they they spoke at the Palm Beach County Republican Lobster Fest event at the Trump International Jupiter
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:14.800]  There were a lot of news reports about this and I had sent out a text message with email copy because that's how
[2:27:14.800 --> 2:27:19.440]  I have to communicate with voters is through text message and emails since I'm banned everywhere and
[2:27:19.720 --> 2:27:25.320]  That's how I do my fundraising. So I send this text message in the link that has the email copy
[2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:32.920]  Briefly flashed and I posted a video of this on my YouTube channel so people can watch and see the evidence for themselves
[2:27:32.920 --> 2:27:34.920]  But it flashed and then there was a
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:39.320]  A notice that said that Comcast was blocking the site
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:46.280]  So they're blocking Laura Loomer for Congress comm and they were blocking the donation page because they called it dangerous
[2:27:46.440 --> 2:27:50.160]  Content, right? And it's just breaking from Breitbart. You're here to fill us in
[2:27:50.600 --> 2:27:54.920]  Comcast says it will fix technical glitch that halted Laura Loomer emails
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:27:59.960]  So they're blocking text messages in emails, but now because of the heat they're having to back down for now
[2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:02.200]  That's a classic tactic. Tell us about that
[2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:09.080]  They're saying that it's a technical glitch, but this is clearly a very political on behalf of Comcast, right?
[2:28:09.080 --> 2:28:14.080]  So Comcast has donated to my opponent Lois Frankel the Democrat
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:18.080]  I'm running it against and every single term that she's been in Congress. They've given her money
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:21.760]  There are tweets that I can I can send you as well
[2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:24.880]  dating from 10 years ago in which
[2:28:25.680 --> 2:28:30.320]  Comcast executives are thanking Lois Frankel and Lois Frankel is thanking Comcast
[2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:35.400]  No, no, we get it. They were blocking your emails and text saying dangerous content. You caught them red-handed
[2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:38.840]  It's the next level of censorship. We need congressional investigations
[2:28:38.840 --> 2:28:42.360]  They're now in the telecoms in the phone calls and the text messages
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:46.720]  Which CNN called for against both of us last year they you they mentioned our name
[2:28:46.720 --> 2:28:54.120]  They said we need Laura Loomer and Alex Jones to not be able to use WhatsApp and they went and investigated whether we could use text messages
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:56.120]  I mean, that's the next level of this
[2:28:56.120 --> 2:29:01.360]  Yeah, definitely. And if they're gonna shut down your access to your internet service provider
[2:29:01.360 --> 2:29:04.600]  What's gonna stop them from shutting off your water and electricity? Oh wait
[2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:11.840]  They're actually already doing that in places like California where you have Eric Garcetti the mayor telling people if you have a party
[2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:15.120]  Or if you don't social distance, we're gonna shut your electric in your water off
[2:29:15.480 --> 2:29:17.400]  These are totalitarian
[2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:22.200]  Communist practices that are being carried out by Democrats and their accomplices in the
[2:29:22.200 --> 2:29:29.400]  Tech companies and the telecommunication companies and we already know that all of these executives with these companies are Democrat mega donors
[2:29:29.600 --> 2:29:33.640]  And there's no coincidence and then I further digging today revealed that
[2:29:34.160 --> 2:29:39.160]  That the Comcast regional office is actually located in the district where I'm running for Congress
[2:29:39.160 --> 2:29:44.120]  Oh, and so I can call it a technical glitch if they want, but this is very suspicious
[2:29:44.120 --> 2:29:47.960]  This is very oh, it's not a technical glitch to say you're dangerous content
[2:29:47.960 --> 2:29:54.440]  It's pre-programmed the new brave new world is text messages and phone calls to block those and if Congress doesn't act
[2:29:54.440 --> 2:29:56.440]  They're gonna start doing it there
[2:29:56.520 --> 2:29:58.520]  right just like it was a
[2:29:58.680 --> 2:30:05.440]  Technical issue and an accident when Facebook said it was okay for people to murder me and you because they labeled us dangerous individuals
[2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:07.440]  right their official internal policy was
[2:30:08.360 --> 2:30:15.080]  Violence and threats of murder or plans to do violence are illegal and we won't allow it unless it's against and they said Laura Loomer Alex Jones
[2:30:15.080 --> 2:30:20.040]  Milo Unopolis and a list of like 20 other people like I mean, it's literally listed us
[2:30:20.040 --> 2:30:22.680]  They said you're allowed to organize their murder
[2:30:23.680 --> 2:30:29.880]  Right and so they constantly do this and they call us dangerous and last time I checked the executives of these companies
[2:30:30.160 --> 2:30:34.760]  You know, they weren't the FBI. We have due process in this country or at least I thought we did
[2:30:34.760 --> 2:30:40.560]  I also thought we had free speech in this country. I thought we had free and fair elections, but I I guess that's out the door as well
[2:30:40.560 --> 2:30:47.760]  And it's really scary and it should terrify every single American that these big tech companies which control
[2:30:47.920 --> 2:30:51.720]  What you see what you hear in the flow of information so much so that they are
[2:30:51.960 --> 2:30:57.800]  Effectively censoring and silencing the president of the United States right now and in the middle of his reelection campaign
[2:30:58.400 --> 2:31:00.400]  Right this this is problematic
[2:31:00.440 --> 2:31:06.160]  We cannot allow for for for this to continue and I think it's an absolute abomination
[2:31:06.160 --> 2:31:13.600]  That members of Congress have allowed for this to continue. We've been screaming about this for how many years now Alex over four
[2:31:13.600 --> 2:31:17.280]  Since President Trump was elected and now they're censoring his tweets. I want to talk about that
[2:31:17.280 --> 2:31:22.640]  But since you mentioned it new listeners, especially on the hundred plus radio stations. We have a TV stations. They're thinking, okay
[2:31:22.640 --> 2:31:26.680]  That's that's too much folks. We're not joking. Put it back on screen. There's there's one article
[2:31:26.680 --> 2:31:31.920]  But it was even the Associated Press Facebook bands violent threats except the violent threats against conservative Laura Loomer
[2:31:31.920 --> 2:31:39.920]  Paul Joseph Watson Alan Jones gab again a smile on others. It actually says we're not joking that they're allowed to organize our murder
[2:31:40.520 --> 2:31:42.320]  officially on those sites
[2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:45.760]  Right. Yeah, and this is this is really problematic because
[2:31:46.560 --> 2:31:49.720]  They're they're it's defamation, right?
[2:31:49.720 --> 2:31:52.480]  And then there's another level to this and it's judicial corruption
[2:31:52.480 --> 2:31:57.160]  And I know you've experienced this with your lawsuits Alex and so you can testify to this
[2:31:57.160 --> 2:32:02.880]  But when I filed these lawsuits and I filed the defamation lawsuit against Facebook when they labeled me dangerous
[2:32:02.880 --> 2:32:05.480]  And they said it was okay for people to kill me, you know
[2:32:05.480 --> 2:32:12.240]  The judges never want to hear these cases and then they say oh you can't get discovery in the case and these judges are so corrupt
[2:32:12.600 --> 2:32:19.440]  Oftentimes and there's no justice for people like you and I who are being silenced and having our lives threatened and digital
[2:32:19.440 --> 2:32:24.520]  Fatwas placed on us, but thank God the people love freedom and are backing us
[2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:30.600]  So as bad as it is you're surging info wars is surging a lot of beautiful things are happening
[2:32:30.600 --> 2:32:32.880]  But let's talk about it for a minute. What makes you tick?
[2:32:32.880 --> 2:32:36.400]  What what's made you cuz I remember you I've been the same way two years when you were crying on air
[2:32:36.400 --> 2:32:39.880]  It was so bad saying help me help me and I people made fun of it. It was serious. It was real
[2:32:39.880 --> 2:32:43.920]  I've cried sometimes. I'm so sad about the country. What made you get even stronger?
[2:32:43.920 --> 2:32:47.360]  It seems a more hardcore. Do you see me even more powerful than you were a few years ago?
[2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:49.440]  well, I
[2:32:49.440 --> 2:32:55.560]  Realized that I was put on this planet for a purpose right and we've had struggles and you and I have been subjected to
[2:32:55.880 --> 2:33:00.400]  extreme amounts of unfairness and it's really and unjust what has happened to us
[2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:07.840]  But I have been placed on this planet because I can handle this and I have been able to endure the
[2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:13.280]  Adversity that I've been subjected to so that I can fight a battle that others who maybe aren't as strong
[2:33:13.760 --> 2:33:19.320]  Can't fight and so that's why I was inspired to run for Congress because I realized that if they can do this
[2:33:19.320 --> 2:33:22.560]  To people like you and I who have massive followings and they can get away with it
[2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:25.160]  What are they going to start doing to the average American and that's it
[2:33:25.160 --> 2:33:30.360]  They went after who has big audiences and who they're scared of because they can get you and I they can get the president
[2:33:30.720 --> 2:33:37.960]  Right and I don't want any other American citizen or any other person to be subjected to what I've been subjected to stay there
[2:33:37.960 --> 2:33:41.120]  Laura Loomer is on fire and in the lead. They're scared of her

[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:07.280]  The general population has been programmed that submission to tyranny brings them prosperity
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:14.200]  Because the last 50 years under psychotic bloodless control. They have taught us by successive
[2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:20.280]  Approximation to bow down and each time be given a reward a treat
[2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:25.680]  But that's like training wild pigs to come eat out of your hand and finally one day
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:29.160]  You lead them into the barn and close the door and butcher them
[2:36:30.280 --> 2:36:33.800]  We're now reaching that point in societal development
[2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:36.320]  Where submission is death
[2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:42.720]  Where submission is the human species being destroyed forever on the altar of Satan
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:49.880]  It was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location
[2:36:49.880 --> 2:36:55.280]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was on American
[2:36:55.440 --> 2:37:01.280]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on droids
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:07.920]  Don't just track your location, but your surfing history where you go who you talk to your relationships
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:12.480]  And they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well
[2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:16.200]  Including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:19.840]  Just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases
[2:37:20.760 --> 2:37:28.120]  Transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:35.640]  Surveillance scores based on information. This is the global Chinese communist social credit score get your protection privacy pockets

[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:48.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:50.440]  Oh
[2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:10.200]  Waging war on corruption crashing for lies and disinformation. I am your host Alex Jones Laura Loomer
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:17.200]  Is just like those other heroes of mine like dr. Andrew Wakefield
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:21.840]  Who did the real studies and knew that it was an autoimmune response in the gut?
[2:38:22.400 --> 2:38:26.520]  Causing the chemical reaction in the brain now. There's hundreds of studies proving it
[2:38:26.640 --> 2:38:33.200]  You know the Rockefeller Foundation even Bill Mollin the gates are now admitting it trying to buy up the patents on how to treat autism
[2:38:33.720 --> 2:38:38.480]  And he knew he was right 18 years ago when they try to take his license and destroy him
[2:38:38.480 --> 2:38:42.480]  He didn't back down now. He's vindicated the guy that put up the fake stories has lost his job
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:46.440]  Well Laura Loomer they're scared of her so she's been through hell the last four years
[2:38:46.440 --> 2:38:52.440]  But she's still here. Thanks to your support and we're still here. Thanks to your support. I gotta tell you folks
[2:38:53.680 --> 2:38:58.800]  Even with election fraud she's gonna have a landslide. She's gonna get in and I think Trump is as well
[2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:02.920]  That's why the Democrats Laura. I'm sure you know now even the New York Times admit
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:06.160]  That Pelosi and others are wargaming
[2:39:06.160 --> 2:39:13.880]  Contesting the election having blue states secede and had their own inauguration. They said that won't even be in D.C.
[2:39:14.160 --> 2:39:19.360]  They're actually saying this publicly these people are insane. Where do you think all this is going?
[2:39:20.160 --> 2:39:26.160]  Well, if the Democrats are clearly hellbent on destroying this country and they're never going to stop
[2:39:26.760 --> 2:39:32.400]  Promoting anarchy. They're never gonna stop trying to destroy our country and burn our Constitution to the ground
[2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:39.280]  Until President Trump is removed from office and when he's elected, they're still not going to accept the legitimacy
[2:39:40.240 --> 2:39:42.880]  of of of his reelection and
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:47.280]  You know, I think that a lot of people are starting to wake up and and see what is happening
[2:39:47.280 --> 2:39:54.160]  And there's a lot of moderate Democrats out there who are getting scared because people are starting to realize that America is becoming
[2:39:54.160 --> 2:39:59.920]  Increasingly unsafe on a daily basis. Thanks to the policies being promoted by Democrats
[2:39:59.920 --> 2:40:06.480]  and the the driving issue here on the campaign trail across the country and the driving theme of this election
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:14.640]  You know of 2020 the presidential reelect. It's law and order. Okay, the Democrats want absolute lawlessness in this country
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:21.040]  And you're either going to vote for President Trump and have law and order and and be safe or you're going to vote for Joe Biden
[2:40:21.040 --> 2:40:27.040]  And you're going to have absolute anarchy communism. No police increased crime open border
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:31.920]  And pretty much end stage America. And by the way, if somebody said that 10 years ago, I'd say they were fear-mongering
[2:40:31.920 --> 2:40:37.920]  It's worse than you're saying the official city of Austin budget calls for blowing up the police department
[2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:43.840]  as a sign that we hate police like forget cutting down statues of confederate generals
[2:40:43.840 --> 2:40:47.360]  They want to blow the police department up the mayor says that
[2:40:48.320 --> 2:40:53.920]  Yeah, well, look, we know that these people want to incite violence. They're violent people and they want us dead
[2:40:53.920 --> 2:41:00.320]  I mean, like we were just saying these tech companies want us dead. They they signaled to people. They're nearly 3 billion users
[2:41:00.320 --> 2:41:03.440]  That it would be okay for people to kill us because they said so
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:12.400]  And they're doing that to conservatives and you see the videos from these riots that are being perpetuated by Antifa domestic terrorists and Black Lives Matter
[2:41:13.360 --> 2:41:20.560]  You know Marxist and they're beating people up in the street. Okay, they're throwing bike locks on people's head cracking people's skulls open
[2:41:20.560 --> 2:41:27.920]  People have died people have been shot. Uh, you know, the Democrats are letting violent criminals and rapists out of prison who are going
[2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:35.120]  And killing people while they're throwing trying to throw people like Roger Stone in jail. Thank God President Trump granted him clemency
[2:41:35.680 --> 2:41:37.680]  But you know
[2:41:37.680 --> 2:41:47.680]  It's a completely backward society that we're living in right now and you add on you know with the violence the coronavirus lockdowns and millions of people unimproved
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:52.400]  And uncertainty with the economy. Uh, and people are very uneasy people feel very
[2:41:53.280 --> 2:42:00.720]  Um insecure and I agree. How do they get there's new videos every day of people to go on frontage roads and highways and point guns at people
[2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:07.040]  And sometimes shoot them in the head and the media calls it and then they chase the cars down trying to jump in front of them
[2:42:07.520 --> 2:42:10.720]  I mean, what the hell? How do you get people to do this?
[2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:15.120]  Right and well, it's the media right? It's the media town. It's the media town. It's the media town
[2:42:15.120 --> 2:42:20.560]  Right and well, it's the media right? It's the media telling people that it's okay by calling it a peaceful protest
[2:42:20.640 --> 2:42:22.400]  Then that's what they're doing
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:28.480]  If you go to church or you go to synagogue or you walk outside without a mask, you know, you're the worst thing in the world
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:32.800]  But if you're a rioter and you're calling it to fund the police and you're destroying property
[2:42:32.880 --> 2:42:38.080]  Well, you know, they're they're glorifying these people and there's nothing to to celebrate about this
[2:42:38.080 --> 2:42:42.720]  This is and I'm watching this footage. This is not the road warrior fiction. This is happening
[2:42:42.720 --> 2:42:44.720]  It is
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:50.720]  Yeah, and it's only getting worse and uh, the radical left is only becoming more brazen
[2:42:51.120 --> 2:42:52.960]  I mean, you saw what happened
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:55.840]  Yesterday outside of the white house who knows what the motive was
[2:42:56.320 --> 2:43:00.800]  Uh, but you know, it's scary. Oh, yeah roll that footage if you can the god just pulls out a handgun
[2:43:01.120 --> 2:43:06.000]  Says i'm gonna shoot you and runs at him with it and then the media is like, oh, they're bad for shooting him
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:14.320]  Yeah, it's absolutely insane what what we're seeing and look they've been doing this they've been amping this up
[2:43:15.040 --> 2:43:19.520]  Alex for many years now if you recall when I stormed the stage of the Shakespeare play and people said
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:22.880]  Oh, you didn't need to do that. Oh, you know, that was over the top
[2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:28.800]  Well, I was talking about the incitement of and the normalization of political violence against the right
[2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:34.480]  It started with people like Kathy Griffin having a severed head of president trump replicating isis
[2:43:34.480 --> 2:43:36.480]  Okay, then you had this
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:38.800]  assassination porn play at central park
[2:43:39.280 --> 2:43:44.880]  Uh, well, that's right. They don't do the violence. They put it out emblematically hoping we might it's like this
[2:43:45.200 --> 2:43:49.760]  Former dod official called for me to be killed. He's not gonna kill me this little cowardly punk
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  But he hopes somebody else does it
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:58.400]  Right just like rachel mato spreads conspiracy theories and lies every week and then one of her crazy supporters at msnbc
[2:43:58.480 --> 2:44:02.800]  Went out and shot steeves galise, right? So so that's what they do
[2:44:02.800 --> 2:44:10.080]  They're they're and the new york times advertised a week before there's no security on the front page. They played baseball here every week
[2:44:11.120 --> 2:44:16.640]  Yeah, and you know what they're doing is they're trying to induce a form of psychosis into the masses, right?
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:18.560]  And they're they're driving people crazy
[2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:24.080]  I'm talking about the mainstream media and the democrats and they're they're they're keeping people pent up inside
[2:44:24.160 --> 2:44:28.800]  So people are agitated and they're trying to divide people and they're trying to make
[2:44:28.800 --> 2:44:33.920]  Um, you know a bad situation worse by making people explode
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:38.160]  Um, and you know, it's having a devastating effect on our country
[2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:43.760]  It's very divided right now and it doesn't matter what president trump does they constantly blame him for everything
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:48.640]  Laura, how do we support your campaign because if you get in you won't just do a great job
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:49.840]  You won't just call for hearings
[2:44:49.840 --> 2:44:54.960]  You won't just have me testify where you and I are at these testimonies. They're talking about us pointing at us
[2:44:54.960 --> 2:45:00.160]  But we can't testify. It's going to be such a game changer if you get in what are you going to do if you get into congress
[2:45:00.640 --> 2:45:03.360]  They admit you're you're winning in all the polls not just the primary
[2:45:03.840 --> 2:45:07.760]  But also in the general election. They're crapping their bridges right now. How what are you going to do if you get in?
[2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:09.600]  And how do we support you?
[2:45:09.600 --> 2:45:13.920]  Yeah, well, thank you alex and uh, you know, look i'm a fighter. Okay. I don't need to
[2:45:14.560 --> 2:45:20.000]  Just say that i'm a fighter like other republican candidates who make empty promises and then they get to dc
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:23.760]  And they don't actually fight right? No, you're you're fire-breathing tiger
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:25.760]  You you do what you say you're going to do
[2:45:26.640 --> 2:45:30.880]  Yeah, I have a proven record of taking on the most radical members of the democrat party, right?
[2:45:30.880 --> 2:45:33.520]  Whether it be ilhan omar washita toleib aoc
[2:45:33.600 --> 2:45:39.760]  I put illegal aliens on nancy polozis lawn handcuffed myself called out jack dorsi in congress as you played earlier
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:44.240]  And when I get to congress, you know, there needs to be more accountability
[2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:45.760]  and
[2:45:45.760 --> 2:45:47.760]  congress needs to be shooken up and
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:53.360]  There needs to be more fighters and I think that it's exhausting when people constantly hear right
[2:45:53.360 --> 2:45:57.040]  It's not just the do nothing democrats. It's also do nothing republicans
[2:45:57.520 --> 2:46:02.080]  Largely who make promises and go on fox news and they talk about fighting back
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:09.760]  But then they ostracize and malign and sideline people like you and I who actually are fighting because they're scared of real populism
[2:46:09.840 --> 2:46:13.200]  That they're they're fakes, but you're the real deal. So how do people financially support you?
[2:46:14.080 --> 2:46:16.480]  Well, they can go to laura loomer for congress.com
[2:46:16.560 --> 2:46:22.320]  That's laura loomer for congress.com and that's where they can make a donation online or they can send a check as well

[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:39.680]  I'm like, hey, you know, we're gonna be on seven days a week at night
[2:47:40.480 --> 2:47:43.840]  So we're already gearing up for that. He speeded the barn show for a while
[2:47:43.840 --> 2:47:48.160]  We're gonna bring back some of that but we're gonna be here seven days a week the last few weeks the election
[2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:50.640]  We're gonna be here most week nights commercial free
[2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:54.880]  Taking your calls covering the latest news war gaming. What's going on?
[2:47:54.880 --> 2:47:55.680]  What's happening?
[2:47:55.680 --> 2:48:00.800]  And it's your job to take those video feeds those audio feeds and share them because when you get excited and say
[2:48:01.280 --> 2:48:04.800]  Hey, they're fighting to take the country back. Here's the truth. It's censored tell others
[2:48:05.600 --> 2:48:07.760]  Don't just share the link say hey spread it
[2:48:08.880 --> 2:48:11.360]  This is we had to build our own infrastructure bandot video
[2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:17.280]  We had to do it all and you built it you bought the t-shirts and the books and the films and the water filtration
[2:48:17.280 --> 2:48:22.000]  Astorable food and the high quality supplements. You did it, baby. It's what you call it thinking me. I'm like

[2:48:29.040 --> 2:48:31.040]  So spread those links
[2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:37.440]  Imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020
[2:48:37.440 --> 2:48:42.320]  The democrats as well as many republican leaders will be calling for the united nations
[2:48:42.960 --> 2:48:48.640]  WHO edict that all americans wear masks be a quote federal order
[2:48:49.360 --> 2:48:50.880]  and mandate
[2:48:50.880 --> 2:48:52.880]  totally unconstitutional
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:55.120]  annihilating states rights
[2:48:55.520 --> 2:49:00.160]  Think about that a woman can kill her baby. We pay for illegal aliens health care
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:02.800]  But you've got to wear a mask
[2:49:02.800 --> 2:49:08.960]  For a virus that killed 20 plus times less than what they said even if you believe the official story
[2:49:09.520 --> 2:49:15.360]  This is about the WHO the globalist testing their power through the media over the federal government
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:18.400]  To set policy in the united states
[2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:24.000]  This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the paris accord and all of it and by the way
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:33.360]  They admit that they say now you're carbons down one way or another you stupid americans
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:37.920]  You can't make this stuff up a consortium of the un
[2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:45.280]  WHO the bill of millenia gates foundation the national institutes of health and of course the clinton global initiative
[2:49:45.520 --> 2:49:53.200]  Headed up by chelsea clinton on the board are in control with apple and google with a hidden app on all phones
[2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:56.560]  That you cannot turn off the track and trace everywhere you go
[2:49:57.120 --> 2:50:01.680]  They claim for covet, but of course it's really the chinese communist social score rollout
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:09.680]  These people are sick filthy criminals and they want total control over society with the official global id system
[2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:12.400]  That's why it's called the clinton global initiative
[2:50:12.560 --> 2:50:18.240]  But you can fight back with the privacy pockets and info war store.com little fairy day cages
[2:50:18.240 --> 2:50:24.320]  Little envelopes put your phone in it and these dirty scumbag fascist pieces of garbage
[2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:27.600]  You can't get all that data and rape you with that data
[2:50:27.840 --> 2:50:32.880]  Rape your privacy tell the rapist clintons go to hell and get your privacy pockets and info war store
[2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:39.440]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:43.520]  And we are back live
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:46.400]  Paul joseph watson who's visiting family in spain
[2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:51.280]  We'll be hosting the rest of fourth hour and i want to get to all your calls, but i'll try to get to as many as i can
[2:50:51.840 --> 2:50:53.840]  right now mcqueen
[2:50:53.840 --> 2:50:55.840]  mcqueen and indiana you're on the air go ahead
[2:50:56.800 --> 2:50:59.680]  Hey, sir. How are you doing today? I'm honored to talk to you brother. Thank you
[2:51:00.640 --> 2:51:06.000]  Honored all mine. Um first time caller long time listener. I'm a truck driver. Uh, so I stream as much as I can
[2:51:06.480 --> 2:51:11.360]  Pretty much every day. I had a really quick couple points. I'll make it quick. Uh, one. I have a google pixel phone
[2:51:11.360 --> 2:51:17.440]  Uh, that thing hates streaming your page. So I always have to go into developer developer options and edit
[2:51:18.400 --> 2:51:21.680]  Running services so that it it'll actually stream it. It seems like they
[2:51:22.400 --> 2:51:26.800]  They like to put little programs in there that slows down my bandwidth whenever I go on your page
[2:51:27.360 --> 2:51:29.360]  I might want to look into
[2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:30.640]  um
[2:51:30.640 --> 2:51:33.760]  The second thing is i'm a truck driver. Like I said, i'm an owner operator
[2:51:33.760 --> 2:51:39.680]  I had two points on that one a lot of us aren't dealing with the uh the threats and uh, you know the
[2:51:39.680 --> 2:51:44.320]  The possible harm that all these riots and stuff like that are
[2:51:44.880 --> 2:51:49.600]  Uh posing to us. Uh, I can tell you I'm not an advocate for violence or anything like that
[2:51:49.600 --> 2:51:53.680]  but a lot of us are starting to uh, take matters into our hands like, uh,
[2:51:54.240 --> 2:51:57.200]  You know bringing things that we can use to protect ourselves
[2:51:57.680 --> 2:52:01.840]  Um, as you should the open carry states where you don't have to have a license
[2:52:02.240 --> 2:52:05.440]  So you can you can open carry as long as you're legally allowed to retain a weapon
[2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:11.920]  Uh, that's another thing. I exercise my right in that too. Good. Uh, and the third thing is if you ever have problems with shipment
[2:52:12.160 --> 2:52:14.160]  If you go and buy a trailer
[2:52:14.560 --> 2:52:18.240]  Uh, I'm sure you got a lot of truckers that are listeners that would love to help you out
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:22.640]  Oh, absolutely. I'm just telling listeners. There's breakdowns at the warehouses
[2:52:23.200 --> 2:52:26.480]  And breakdown because of the covetous stereo. They'll have a meatpacking plant
[2:52:27.040 --> 2:52:32.000]  We're like a third of them test positive, but no one's sick, but they shut the plant down
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:36.080]  It's insane fear mongering. Yeah, absolutely
[2:52:36.080 --> 2:52:39.920]  And then you had a trucker or someone who was related to a trucker earlier that called in and said uh,
[2:52:40.320 --> 2:52:45.520]  That the the companies have warehouses full of product. That's true. I've seen it with my own eyes
[2:52:45.600 --> 2:52:48.800]  They wouldn't even sell it to us. I mean we could see it and then we go in their store directly
[2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:51.680]  And they don't even have anything on the shelf and the customer uh representatives
[2:52:51.760 --> 2:52:56.960]  So they don't have anything and it's like wow, okay, the big corporations are in on it brother mcclean. God bless you
[2:52:56.960 --> 2:52:58.560]  Thank you for holding
[2:52:58.560 --> 2:53:02.960]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call. Who's up next here?

[2:53:20.640 --> 2:53:23.840]  I just want to plug a couple of your products. I've been taking now for a while

[2:53:38.160 --> 2:53:43.920]  Yeah, and these times we definitely need things like that to uh to keep us staying because it's turning into a crazy world
[2:53:45.040 --> 2:53:50.560]  Well, I want to get right to it. I just want to praise you and the whole info wars team and in jesus name and god bless you all
[2:53:51.040 --> 2:53:53.040]  I've been listening to you guys for years

[2:53:58.240 --> 2:54:03.440]  Um, brother, just thank you for keeping us in the fight because that's all I want to stay in the fight
[2:54:03.440 --> 2:54:04.560]  I think about
[2:54:04.560 --> 2:54:08.240]  How important the show is is everything we talked about comes true and as things get worse and worse
[2:54:08.640 --> 2:54:12.400]  I think about everybody else has been silenced. Thank you for helping us build this infrastructure
[2:54:12.720 --> 2:54:18.000]  Thank you for helping us build band-aid video and the satellites and the radio and the and the crew thanks you because
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:24.240]  It's scary to see our popularity rise as we know the enemy wants to shut us down because can you imagine
[2:54:24.480 --> 2:54:27.440]  Once they shut us down how bad it's going to get if there's if they're successful
[2:54:28.560 --> 2:54:30.560]  And I hope that never happens man
[2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:37.280]  You and the the entire network means so much to to to believers in christ and to the whole body of christ
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:44.960]  And I can see him working miracles through you and your team and through your channel and it's touching millions of people
[2:54:44.960 --> 2:54:49.840]  Oh, you're right. It's it's not us. It's god. That's another reason people shouldn't thank me. It's literally god
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:52.720]  I feel pathetic and dirty actually there's much
[2:54:53.520 --> 2:54:59.040]  Discernment and the holy ghost as I get I feel dirty people like don't you feel powerful? I think nothing like filthy
[2:54:59.200 --> 2:55:04.080]  I don't know how to describe it. It's like because you're close to god like that and then you feel how sinful you are
[2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:05.680]  You know what i'm talking about
[2:55:05.680 --> 2:55:09.360]  I hear you. I hear you brother loud and loud and clear feel the same way

[2:56:46.080 --> 2:56:50.800]  All right paul joseph. Watson's about to take over at t-minus two minutes
[2:56:50.800 --> 2:56:56.560]  But I just want listeners understand something youtube sent us a message saying your video
[2:56:57.200 --> 2:57:00.080]  Titled see the report censored by youtube under un orders
[2:57:00.800 --> 2:57:04.560]  It's just a little sub channel that gregory says he posts them to band on video
[2:57:05.200 --> 2:57:11.040]  But they tell him in the letter that we have on infowarstore.com that the un says you're not allowed to do that
[2:57:11.040 --> 2:57:16.400]  That's inside world government telling citizens what they can do through an ai platform
[2:57:16.400 --> 2:57:20.400]  So because congress won't act we're now under un control
[2:57:20.960 --> 2:57:22.960]  And the video report shows
[2:57:23.040 --> 2:57:27.040]  Forbes and the new york times and the cdc's on the website saying
[2:57:27.920 --> 2:57:31.520]  That covid's a hoax and that the tests are fake
[2:57:32.720 --> 2:57:36.880]  Doesn't mean it's some people don't die from it. It's it's a it's a cold bug
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:42.480]  And it was manufactured in a lab so bill gates and fouchy can own it. They actually own it
[2:57:42.480 --> 2:57:45.520]  It's just insane. But that video
[2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:51.040]  Needs to get tens of millions of views not a million views. I think 11 million views in a few days
[2:57:51.600 --> 2:57:53.600]  We'll have 200,000 on the time the show's over
[2:57:54.560 --> 2:57:59.120]  But it needs to get out people need to know. Hey the un banned this video
[2:58:00.720 --> 2:58:06.400]  See the video the un banned because it exposed the covid hoax. I'm going to change the name of the video to that
[2:58:06.720 --> 2:58:08.720]  I'm making the feature video at band.video
[2:58:09.040 --> 2:58:11.040]  And I just want you to know that
[2:58:11.040 --> 2:58:15.600]  And I just want to expose these monsters. I mean, it's so crazy what's all come out
[2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:25.120]  And all the things they've done and in texas it's 0.032 the death rate, I mean
[2:58:26.560 --> 2:58:29.920]  And then if you try to show those rates or medical doctors, they ban them
[2:58:31.680 --> 2:58:36.400]  The war room comes up in about 50 minutes after I get off and paul watson gets off
[2:58:36.400 --> 2:58:40.320]  With oan shroyer and others that's a very important transmission. Please spread the links to that
[2:58:40.560 --> 2:58:44.320]  Please tell folks about the local radio stations and TV stations and please support those local stations
[2:58:44.640 --> 2:58:50.320]  All right taking over from the anata kingdom is paul joseph watson from summit.news
[2:58:50.320 --> 2:58:53.120]  Be sure and check out that great site as well paul joseph watson
[2:58:54.960 --> 2:59:00.080]  Good to be back and we are going to continue talking about the corona virus because we have a situation
[2:59:00.480 --> 2:59:05.200]  In melbourne australia and throughout australia in general at least part of it
[2:59:05.200 --> 2:59:13.120]  Where there is an unmitigated police state lockdown in response to yet another relatively mild outbreak of corona virus
[2:59:13.120 --> 2:59:15.120]  But I'm going to preface that
[2:59:15.120 --> 2:59:19.680]  By talking about new zealand, of course, a neighboring country of australia
[2:59:20.480 --> 2:59:25.680]  Headline new zealand goes into lockdown after just four new cases of corona virus
[2:59:26.320 --> 2:59:30.960]  This is the new zealand prime minister jacinda ordern who of course is a
[2:59:30.960 --> 2:59:36.000]  Globalist darling because she basically confiscated everybody's guns last year after the moscow attack
[2:59:36.880 --> 2:59:39.920]  She has ordered parts of new zealand now bear in mind
[2:59:40.720 --> 2:59:43.040]  New zealand is a country that hasn't had
[2:59:44.000 --> 2:59:47.920]  Not a death but not a single corona virus case
[2:59:48.560 --> 2:59:50.560]  In 102
[2:59:50.560 --> 2:59:51.680]  days
[2:59:51.680 --> 2:59:53.680]  This is a country
[2:59:53.680 --> 2:59:55.680]  Which throughout the entire pandemic
[2:59:56.160 --> 2:59:59.040]  Corona virus has killed just 22
[2:59:59.040 --> 3:00:01.040]  people
[3:00:01.040 --> 3:00:03.040]  I mean, there are probably more deaths over that same period
[3:00:03.680 --> 3:00:05.680]  in new zealand
[3:00:05.680 --> 3:00:10.160]  Of people getting eaten by sharks people getting bitten and dying from
[3:00:10.560 --> 3:00:14.160]  Spiders or snakes or things like that 22 people
[3:00:14.800 --> 3:00:19.760]  Total have died in new zealand over the course of the entire corona virus pandemic
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:23.120]  Now they've ordered parts of the country including Auckland
[3:00:23.760 --> 3:00:25.760]  Of course a major population capital
[3:00:25.760 --> 3:00:32.160]  Interlockdown after four people were infected with corona virus on by the way
[3:00:32.560 --> 3:00:35.360]  These four people are all from the same family
[3:00:36.880 --> 3:00:42.160]  ABC news australia reports the infected people are from the same family in south Auckland
[3:00:43.680 --> 3:00:47.280]  Arden's response to four people from the same family being infected
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:50.000]  Was to order a three-day
[3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:55.200]  Level three lockdown of Auckland while the rest of the country is in lockdown
[3:00:55.200 --> 3:00:57.200]  While the rest of the country
[3:00:57.360 --> 3:01:00.880]  Will go into a level two lockdown now. What does that mean under level three?
[3:01:01.680 --> 3:01:03.680]  in terms of Auckland well, it means
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:05.520]  travel restrictions
[3:01:05.520 --> 3:01:07.520]  All travel into Auckland is suspended
[3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:15.120]  It means schools closing bars closing businesses closing people being asked to stay at home
[3:01:15.840 --> 3:01:17.840]  again all because four people
[3:01:18.640 --> 3:01:19.920]  From one family
[3:01:19.920 --> 3:01:26.560]  Presumably in one home were infected with corona virus the first people across the entire country of new zealand
[3:01:27.120 --> 3:01:31.600]  To be infected after 102 days of zero cases
[3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:35.280]  Now somebody was posting or writing into the
[3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:39.840]  Lockdown skeptics org website which featured this article
[3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:43.600]  And they said yeah, we have cases all four of them
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:48.560]  Who would have predicted that maintaining pristine isolation of new zealand from the rest of the world
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:50.560]  Couldn't be maintained forever
[3:01:51.040 --> 3:01:54.480]  Announced at 9 p.m. Tonight and enacted by midday tomorrow
[3:01:54.800 --> 3:02:00.720]  Precisely and exactly as bizarre and arbitrary as the recent flip flops in uk policy
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  Now we get on to australia
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:10.560]  Because as i write in this article if the kiwis copy their close neighbors australia expect enforcement of the new lockdown measures
[3:02:10.880 --> 3:02:15.600]  To be draconian in nature because since the start of last week
[3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:20.320]  The state of victoria in australia, which includes the city of melbourne
[3:02:20.960 --> 3:02:27.760]  Subjected to an 8 p.m. To 5 a.m. Curfew now. What's different about this curfew this corona virus lockdown in
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:30.400]  The state of victoria in australia
[3:02:31.200 --> 3:02:33.200]  Is that it's not being enforced
[3:02:33.440 --> 3:02:39.360]  By people in walmart screeching that you've not wearing a mask who have no real powers of detainment obviously
[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:44.480]  It's not even being enforced by police who merely ask you to put on the mask
[3:02:44.480 --> 3:02:47.840]  And then if you still refuse issue with issue you with a spot fine
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:52.000]  This is being fought and forced by outright police brutality
[3:02:52.720 --> 3:02:55.120]  And we had yet another example of that in australia
[3:02:55.760 --> 3:02:57.760]  emerge yesterday
[3:02:57.760 --> 3:03:04.800]  Headline video shows police putting choke choke hold on woman for violating lockdown again. This is in melbourne australia
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:10.080]  And you can see the video for yourself. It's embedded in this article
[3:03:10.080 --> 3:03:17.840]  By the way, I noticed that that video has just been deleted from twitter. So i'm going to have to go in and replace that video
[3:03:18.800 --> 3:03:24.160]  Uh, but another version of it is actually posted in the follow-up article, which I did
[3:03:25.040 --> 3:03:27.040]  And it's actually a better video because it's closed
[3:03:28.640 --> 3:03:34.400]  Entitled reddit leftist celebrate police putting woman in choke hold for not wearing a face mask
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:39.760]  If you go to the original article the uh the denizens of twitter enforcement have
[3:03:40.720 --> 3:03:42.720]  Elated that video because apparently
[3:03:43.280 --> 3:03:48.800]  It's causing a big stir in australia. Basically. It shows a woman outside a clothing store
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:52.400]  Being put in a choke hold by a male police officer
[3:03:52.960 --> 3:03:56.080]  Being wrestled to the ground while he maintains this choke hold
[3:03:57.040 --> 3:04:00.640]  Again forcefully wrestled to the ground grappled to the ground. He then sits on her
[3:04:00.640 --> 3:04:04.160]  And it becomes clear from the exchange in the conversation
[3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:11.680]  That she's being literally choke-holded and wrestled to the ground for not wearing a face mask in public
[3:04:11.760 --> 3:04:13.760]  You can see part of the video here
[3:04:14.480 --> 3:04:16.480]  And then if you take a look at the
[3:04:17.040 --> 3:04:19.040]  Follow-up article, which I did today
[3:04:19.280 --> 3:04:25.040]  Headline reddit leftist celebrate police putting woman in choke hold for not wearing a face mask bearing in mind
[3:04:25.040 --> 3:04:32.560]  These are the same people who for the past two and a half months have been either supporting or actively engaging
[3:04:32.960 --> 3:04:35.200]  in protests and riots
[3:04:35.840 --> 3:04:41.360]  over the death of george floyd because he was basically put in a choke hold you can call it that
[3:04:42.080 --> 3:04:44.320]  He was asphyxiated of course the fact that he was
[3:04:45.040 --> 3:04:47.920]  High on fence and all had just committed fraud. It was a career criminal
[3:04:48.240 --> 3:04:53.840]  You know, we put that to one side this woman who's not wearing a face mask though. She deserves it
[3:04:53.840 --> 3:04:58.320]  Leftists on reddit suddenly dropped all concerns about police brutality
[3:04:59.040 --> 3:05:04.800]  To celebrate a video of a woman in australia being put in a choke hold by a cop because she wasn't wearing a face mask outside
[3:05:06.320 --> 3:05:10.080]  This video actually shows it up close. So it's worse than the one that came out yesterday
[3:05:11.920 --> 3:05:18.480]  However, many of the same leftists who have been decrying police brutality for the past two months plus in some cases protesting the rioting against it
[3:05:18.480 --> 3:05:26.720]  Apparently think police brutality is just fine when enforcing COVID-19 lockdowns. So this video which you're watching now
[3:05:27.600 --> 3:05:35.280]  Was proudly posted on a subreddit called justice served. It has over 35,000 upvotes
[3:05:36.240 --> 3:05:42.960]  And is entitled this is how the australian police will deal with you if you treat public health and safety directives as a threat to your
[3:05:43.520 --> 3:05:45.520]  masculinity or not job conspiracy
[3:05:45.520 --> 3:05:51.760]  So you have respondents on this thread literally reacting with glee with wanton abandon and glee
[3:05:52.720 --> 3:05:57.120]  To this video of a woman screaming as she's manhandled by her throat to the ground
[3:05:57.680 --> 3:06:01.520]  By a police officer significantly taller significantly bigger than her
[3:06:02.000 --> 3:06:09.120]  They don't care about police brutality. They don't care about somebody being potentially choked to death. In fact, they even say
[3:06:09.200 --> 3:06:13.920]  Oh, but she was able to talk while he had her hands around her neck. So that makes it okay
[3:06:13.920 --> 3:06:15.920]  So that makes it okay
[3:06:15.920 --> 3:06:20.720]  Yeah, I seem to recall george floyd saying I can't breathe over and over again
[3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:24.560]  While the officer had his knee on floyd's neck
[3:06:24.960 --> 3:06:29.520]  But then it was a totally different equation obviously because he was an african-american career criminal
[3:06:29.760 --> 3:06:33.760]  Pion fentanyl who had just committed fraud. So in that case it was bad
[3:06:33.920 --> 3:06:39.600]  But because this woman wasn't wearing a mask police brutality is good. We'll be back on the other side summit dot news
[3:06:39.600 --> 3:06:44.800]  The bbc is state-run media in the uk and they've come out with a detailed article
[3:06:45.200 --> 3:06:47.200]  It's linked on info wars dot com
[3:06:47.520 --> 3:06:48.880]  saying
[3:06:48.880 --> 3:06:52.480]  You will have to have forced inoculations multiple times a year
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:56.240]  To be able to travel robots will scan you when you land

[3:07:04.160 --> 3:07:07.600]  The microsoft website now officially has announced the digital tattoo
[3:07:07.600 --> 3:07:11.200]  We exposed this six months ago. Now bill gates was funding it
[3:07:11.200 --> 3:07:14.240]  And they had hundreds of news articles attacking and saying it wasn't true
[3:07:14.720 --> 3:07:20.080]  This is a tactic to use first they announce it. We say it's a bad idea. They say that's crazy. We didn't do it
[3:07:20.480 --> 3:07:24.800]  They introduced the idea to you then they come back and announce it again thinking you have no memory
[3:07:25.200 --> 3:07:26.880]  This is a criminal
[3:07:26.880 --> 3:07:30.800]  Takeover. This is the line in the sand. We must say no
[3:07:30.880 --> 3:07:36.640]  We must expose the fraud of covet 19 this entire house of evil is built on i'm alex jones

[3:08:53.440 --> 3:08:55.440]  You're listening to summit.news
[3:08:55.440 --> 3:08:57.440]  with paul joseph watson
[3:09:01.200 --> 3:09:03.200]  Paul the spectator has
[3:09:03.520 --> 3:09:07.360]  announced that bill biden has selected his running mate with an announcement possible
[3:09:08.400 --> 3:09:11.360]  To date so we'll bring that news to you if it happens before the end of this hour
[3:09:11.840 --> 3:09:16.080]  Of course, hopefully for his sake it's somebody who can string along two sentences and can actually talk
[3:09:16.720 --> 3:09:20.240]  And debate because it's not looking too good for old uncle joe
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:26.800]  As we get closer to the debates with the mainstream media desperately trying to find any reason to get him out of those debates
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:30.160]  But we're continuing to talk about the coronavirus lockdown
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:39.360]  In australia where again, they had a cluster of cases. Now, of course, it's mandatory to wear face masks everywhere as it is here in spain
[3:09:40.160 --> 3:09:45.440]  Of course, the fact that the normal surgical face mask that the vast majority of people are walking around in
[3:09:45.440 --> 3:09:53.040]  Don't block out seven 97 percent of particles. It doesn't really matter. It doesn't really matter that experts in sweden
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:59.040]  Which we're going to get on to basically now has zero covid cases whatsoever after not locking down
[3:09:59.600 --> 3:10:02.400]  Which experts in the netherlands say are completely pointless
[3:10:02.800 --> 3:10:08.320]  That is the law and if you defy the law in melbourne australia, it's not just a fine
[3:10:08.400 --> 3:10:13.280]  It's a literal chokehold in the case of this woman who was dragged to the ground
[3:10:13.280 --> 3:10:15.280]  And leftists are celebrating it
[3:10:15.840 --> 3:10:18.400]  The same leftists who for the past two months as I said
[3:10:19.920 --> 3:10:26.720]  We're rioting in the streets and smashing store windows because george floyd was choked to death as they claim
[3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:33.040]  When it happens to this woman because she committed the crime of not wearing a mask and like george floyd
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:37.360]  She wasn't pointing guns at the stomachs of pregnant women. Apparently that's okay
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  She committed the crime of not wearing a mask
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:46.880]  She was manhandled choke to wrestle to the ground and the video of that is being celebrated by leftists on a subreddit called justice served
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  35,000 up votes
[3:10:50.880 --> 3:10:52.880]  in this uh
[3:10:52.880 --> 3:10:59.520]  big hailing big celebration big festivity over this woman's screeching and screaming as she's dragged to the ground
[3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:02.080]  by the corona cop
[3:11:02.880 --> 3:11:06.320]  Some respondents put their comments after the video
[3:11:06.320 --> 3:11:10.160]  One of them said quote every anti-masker deserves this
[3:11:10.800 --> 3:11:15.040]  Stand your ground rules should apply to interactions with them as they are threats to others
[3:11:15.280 --> 3:11:23.200]  These are people. These are the kind of people I talk about who will literally leap out of the way if they see somebody walking towards them in the opposite direction
[3:11:23.520 --> 3:11:26.240]  That happens in britain. I talked about it on last week's show
[3:11:26.800 --> 3:11:31.680]  These are the people who will literally throw hot coffee over people for not wearing a face mask
[3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:37.040]  They'll literally mace people in the face as we saw in california with that couple having a picnic
[3:11:37.600 --> 3:11:39.600]  for not wearing a face mask
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:45.520]  Another comment to respond to the video of the woman being choked by the corona cop
[3:11:46.560 --> 3:11:51.920]  By saying which my country would enforce masks like this. Maybe then we would not lead the world in covid deaths
[3:11:52.960 --> 3:11:55.440]  Or as she put it covind death
[3:11:56.560 --> 3:11:58.560]  Another one said we need some of that energy here
[3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:03.600]  in the states. So the same leftists who have been decrying police brutality
[3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:07.600]  The George Floyd for the past two and a half months
[3:12:08.160 --> 3:12:13.120]  Been saying that this needs we need a fundamental revolution of society. We need to defund police departments
[3:12:13.680 --> 3:12:15.680]  We need to kick out mayors
[3:12:16.160 --> 3:12:19.600]  These are the people now sitting the woman in the choke hold
[3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:22.560]  consistent as ever
[3:12:23.440 --> 3:12:25.440]  Some of them responded with an ounce of salt
[3:12:25.440 --> 3:12:29.440]  Some of them responded with an ounce of sanity by saying quote
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:34.480]  People on here are saying the cop isn't choking her if she's able to say she's being choked
[3:12:35.040 --> 3:12:40.560]  Pretty much the same as when people defended the George Floyd cops because they claimed if he can say he can't breathe then he can breathe
[3:12:41.200 --> 3:12:47.840]  Of course, as you know from the body cam footage George Floyd was saying I can't breathe before the officers even put their hands on him
[3:12:47.840 --> 3:12:54.240]  That was bad, but it's okay when a woman gets choked out for not wearing a mask in Australia
[3:12:54.480 --> 3:12:58.480]  And this is the police state. If this is what they're doing with people don't wear masks
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:01.920]  What are they going to do to people who don't take the vaccine?
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:05.440]  We had another story out of Australia last week
[3:13:05.760 --> 3:13:11.200]  Woman left with severe bruising after being arrested by police for being outside during lockdown again
[3:13:11.600 --> 3:13:16.720]  They're supposed to get fines and in Australia. I think they put the fines up to 5,000
[3:13:16.720 --> 3:13:20.080]  Dollars on the spot fine
[3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:24.560]  But in many instances as we've seen the police are just
[3:13:25.360 --> 3:13:27.760]  Bowling into them dragging them to the ground
[3:13:28.480 --> 3:13:32.240]  Choking them putting them in handcuffs. They don't even attempt to find them
[3:13:32.880 --> 3:13:34.880]  Are these women being belligerent? Well
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:37.440]  The woman in the chokehold was kicking out
[3:13:37.440 --> 3:13:46.400]  But again if that happened to an african-american career criminal the left would decry it in this case. They celebrate
[3:13:46.960 --> 3:13:50.560]  We also have this article on the same subject out of Australia
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:55.760]  Melbourne coronavirus checkpoints to ensure workers allowed to leave their homes
[3:13:56.320 --> 3:14:01.600]  Now, of course after the coronavirus lockdown was announced the new lockdown was announced just about 10 days ago
[3:14:01.600 --> 3:14:08.400]  Eyewitness reports said that police officers and national guard were literally outside residential tower blocks
[3:14:09.040 --> 3:14:15.520]  within minutes of authorities announcing this new lockdown in Melbourne in the state of victoria
[3:14:16.560 --> 3:14:18.560]  Well now as part of its strict new lockdown law
[3:14:19.120 --> 3:14:21.760]  Authorities in Melbourne have set up highway checkpoints
[3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:26.320]  For which residents have their papers scrutinized to ensure they're allowed to leave their homes
[3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:30.480]  Now of course the state of victoria announced the state of disaster
[3:14:31.440 --> 3:14:35.600]  That's what they called it an 8 p.m. To 5 a.m curfew on residents
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:43.440]  And now the law is also being enforced by a series of checkpoints to determine if people have a legitimate reason to be traveling
[3:14:43.680 --> 3:14:50.960]  They're literally stopping people on the highway and asking them for work permits to see if they're able to go to their job
[3:14:51.920 --> 3:14:53.920]  Sydney Watson tweeted
[3:14:53.920 --> 3:14:56.400]  My brother sent me this photo yesterday of a checkpoint
[3:14:56.400 --> 3:15:01.520]  He had to go through in Melbourne to make sure he had a work permit to leave his house police and army there
[3:15:02.080 --> 3:15:04.080]  literal army checkpoints
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:08.880]  Checking your papers deciding whether you're free to go to work in the morning
[3:15:10.160 --> 3:15:15.360]  This is the corona tyranny that we've been warning about for months and months and months and it only seems to be getting worse
[3:15:16.160 --> 3:15:22.320]  She said he was stressing because his permit had an error on it and he didn't know what the consequences would be
[3:15:22.320 --> 3:15:25.520]  Well, of course we had the story last week out of new york
[3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:32.240]  Which also announced covid checkpoints in an attempt to catch anyone who flouts their 14 day quarantine order
[3:15:32.960 --> 3:15:37.520]  Which is interesting because we have the same order here or back in the uk
[3:15:38.480 --> 3:15:41.520]  Of course i'm in spain at the moment, but when i do fly back to the uk
[3:15:42.160 --> 3:15:46.480]  Under the law i'm going to have to quarantine under de facto house arrest
[3:15:46.480 --> 3:15:52.880]  For two weeks and you're not even allowed to leave your house to get shopping. You have to have somebody else bring you shopping
[3:15:52.880 --> 3:15:54.880]  You're not even allowed outside to exercise
[3:15:55.520 --> 3:15:57.520]  Now in the uk it was a little bit
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:00.720]  Benny hill a little bit rinky dink because when
[3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:03.920]  They started asking the government. How are you going to enforce this?
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:09.440]  I basically said oh, we're going to text message one in five people and ask them if they're quarantining
[3:16:09.760 --> 3:16:12.480]  And yeah, i'm sure everybody will comply with that
[3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:17.920]  But in australia and in new york, they're not messing around of course de blasio
[3:16:18.400 --> 3:16:24.320]  Announced last week that he would have covid checkpoints on major bridges major areas around the country
[3:16:25.040 --> 3:16:31.120]  Checking the papers of anyone who had traveled into new york because now if you travel into new york even from within the united states
[3:16:31.120 --> 3:16:36.880]  You have to quarantine you have to put yourself under house arrest for 14 days minimum
[3:16:36.880 --> 3:16:39.200]  And they're going to have checkpoints just like in melbourne
[3:16:39.200 --> 3:16:42.080]  Trying to catch anyone flouting that
[3:16:42.880 --> 3:16:44.880]  Absolutely incredible
[3:16:45.600 --> 3:16:52.240]  And if all this was necessary, then maybe you could understand it to a certain degree if coronavirus was this earth shattering pandemic
[3:16:53.040 --> 3:16:56.560]  Of course, we know from polls, which i talked about in my latest video
[3:16:57.360 --> 3:17:03.360]  Polls show that literally night americans think that nine percent of the american population has died from coronavirus
[3:17:04.080 --> 3:17:07.040]  They think 30 million americans have died from coronavirus
[3:17:07.040 --> 3:17:13.040]  They think 30 million americans in the united states have died from coronavirus when you look at women
[3:17:14.080 --> 3:17:18.160]  They think 10 percent have died so even more similar figure in the uk
[3:17:18.240 --> 3:17:25.440]  They think seven percent of the uk population, which is five million people have died from coronavirus. The actual number is around 50 000
[3:17:25.840 --> 3:17:32.400]  Constant drumbeat of media hysteria has greased the skids for the kind of checkpoint papers
[3:17:32.400 --> 3:17:38.880]  Please tyranny we're seeing in melbourne now or so in new york. We'll be back on the other side summit don't use no go
[3:17:39.040 --> 3:17:42.880]  Just a few months ago almost every storeable food manufacturer was sold out
[3:17:43.360 --> 3:17:46.880]  They were still taking people's orders and many of the companies have still not fulfilled them
[3:17:47.120 --> 3:17:49.120]  All the orders we got in have been fulfilled
[3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:53.040]  Our suppliers the best the highest quality the best containers to transport as well
[3:17:53.200 --> 3:17:58.080]  And they've got the food with four factories in stock take some two to four weeks to get it shipped out to you
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:18:03.840]  You need to order your storeable food now. The world is much more dire the economic system is collapsing
[3:18:03.840 --> 3:18:07.040]  The third world's already starving to death food prices are exploding here
[3:18:07.760 --> 3:18:11.680]  The farms and the production plants are shutting down because of the covid hoax
[3:18:11.840 --> 3:18:15.200]  You need to get your storeable food while you still can at m-full or store.com
[3:18:15.200 --> 3:18:17.600]  So 361 it also funds our operation
[3:18:17.760 --> 3:18:20.240]  But you need to get it whether three months six months a year

[3:19:35.660 --> 3:19:38.380]  Other systems just don't compare.
[3:19:39.620 --> 3:19:42.660]  America and the world should have never been closed.
[3:19:42.660 --> 3:19:47.180]  It was all based on WHO, Bill and Melinda Gates,
[3:19:47.180 --> 3:19:49.180]  Fauci NIH lives.
[3:19:49.180 --> 3:19:52.460]  But now here we are already into August
[3:19:52.460 --> 3:19:56.340]  and they're trying to keep our stores, our factories,
[3:19:56.340 --> 3:19:59.260]  our schools, our parks closed.
[3:19:59.260 --> 3:20:01.500]  It is outrageous.

[3:20:38.620 --> 3:20:44.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:57.620 --> 3:21:00.620]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters,
[3:21:00.620 --> 3:21:02.620]  it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:21:02.620 --> 3:21:05.620]  Now, you know for a fact what's coming next.
[3:21:05.620 --> 3:21:08.620]  It's not just going to be papers, please,
[3:21:08.620 --> 3:21:11.620]  for you to travel interstate, for you to travel.
[3:21:11.620 --> 3:21:12.620]  Job.
[3:21:12.620 --> 3:21:14.620]  It's going to be.
[3:21:14.620 --> 3:21:15.620]  Do you have the vaccine?
[3:21:15.620 --> 3:21:17.620]  Do you have the mark?
[3:21:17.620 --> 3:21:19.620]  If you don't, not just a ban on international travel,
[3:21:19.620 --> 3:21:21.620]  they're going to ban interstate travel.
[3:21:21.620 --> 3:21:23.620]  They're at least going to propose doing this.
[3:21:23.620 --> 3:21:26.620]  The people who don't take the vaccine.
[3:21:26.620 --> 3:21:28.620]  Of course, Vladimir Putin has come out today
[3:21:28.620 --> 3:21:30.620]  and said that, you know,
[3:21:30.620 --> 3:21:33.620]  Vladimir Putin has come out today and said that,
[3:21:33.620 --> 3:21:37.620]  Russia has a COVID-19 vaccine almost ready.
[3:21:37.620 --> 3:21:41.620]  They're talking about shipping out 500 million doses a year
[3:21:41.620 --> 3:21:43.620]  across the world.
[3:21:43.620 --> 3:21:47.620]  He says he's tested it or had it tested on his own daughter.
[3:21:47.620 --> 3:21:49.620]  Who, by the way, had an adverse reaction,
[3:21:49.620 --> 3:21:51.620]  but she was fine after that, apparently.
[3:21:51.620 --> 3:21:53.620]  People aren't too happy with that.
[3:21:53.620 --> 3:21:55.620]  Of course, the mainstream media, the political class,
[3:21:55.620 --> 3:21:57.620]  the vaunted health authorities,
[3:21:57.620 --> 3:22:02.620]  don't like any discussion of an actual cure for coronavirus.
[3:22:02.620 --> 3:22:04.620]  Whatever your take on the vaccine,
[3:22:04.620 --> 3:22:06.620]  I'm certainly not taking it.
[3:22:06.620 --> 3:22:08.620]  They're very unhappy with Russia for saying
[3:22:08.620 --> 3:22:11.620]  that they've got a coronavirus vaccine ready.
[3:22:11.620 --> 3:22:14.620]  And as far as what will happen to people who don't take it,
[3:22:14.620 --> 3:22:16.620]  we have this headline.
[3:22:16.620 --> 3:22:17.620]  Video.
[3:22:17.620 --> 3:22:19.620]  Doctor recommends children wear yellow badges
[3:22:19.620 --> 3:22:21.620]  if they haven't been vaccinated.
[3:22:21.620 --> 3:22:24.620]  Now, I don't know what kind of stunt he was trying to pull.
[3:22:24.620 --> 3:22:28.620]  We know the connotations of yellow badges.
[3:22:28.620 --> 3:22:32.620]  This was Doctor, I think it was Doctor Mark Siegel,
[3:22:32.620 --> 3:22:36.620]  who appeared on Tucker Carlson's show last night,
[3:22:36.620 --> 3:22:39.620]  suggested that children should wear yellow badges
[3:22:39.620 --> 3:22:41.620]  bearing the phrase, no hugs, please,
[3:22:41.620 --> 3:22:44.620]  if they have not received a COVID-19 vaccine.
[3:22:44.620 --> 3:22:47.620]  Now, that's interesting because, of course,
[3:22:47.620 --> 3:22:51.620]  we had mayors in Italy back in late February
[3:22:51.620 --> 3:22:54.620]  telling people in cities like Florence
[3:22:54.620 --> 3:22:56.620]  to literally go out in the streets
[3:22:56.620 --> 3:22:59.620]  and hug Chinese people to prove they weren't racist.
[3:22:59.620 --> 3:23:02.620]  Because, of course, this was back during the time
[3:23:02.620 --> 3:23:06.620]  when people like Nancy Pelosi, people like De Blasio,
[3:23:06.620 --> 3:23:08.620]  were saying, go out in the streets of New York,
[3:23:08.620 --> 3:23:10.620]  go out in the streets of San Francisco,
[3:23:10.620 --> 3:23:14.620]  and celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year
[3:23:14.620 --> 3:23:16.620]  by hugging Chinese people and mingling
[3:23:16.620 --> 3:23:18.620]  with thousands of them in the streets.
[3:23:18.620 --> 3:23:20.620]  They soon changed their tune, didn't they?
[3:23:20.620 --> 3:23:23.620]  Now, we've got a doctor going on Fox News
[3:23:23.620 --> 3:23:26.620]  talking about kids being plastered with yellow stars
[3:23:26.620 --> 3:23:28.620]  or yellow badges.
[3:23:28.620 --> 3:23:30.620]  Not much difference.
[3:23:30.620 --> 3:23:33.620]  If they don't take the coronavirus,
[3:23:33.620 --> 3:23:36.620]  and what is all this in aid of?
[3:23:36.620 --> 3:23:40.620]  It's an aid of a virus which, in the UK,
[3:23:40.620 --> 3:23:46.620]  killed less people than the 2017-2018 flu season.
[3:23:46.620 --> 3:23:48.620]  And then we look to Sweden.
[3:23:48.620 --> 3:23:50.620]  We've talked about it from the beginning.
[3:23:50.620 --> 3:23:54.620]  The one thing that Sweden got right in the past three decades
[3:23:54.620 --> 3:23:56.620]  was they did not lock down.
[3:23:56.620 --> 3:23:58.620]  They trusted their own population,
[3:23:58.620 --> 3:24:01.620]  unlike in Melbourne, where they're choke-holding
[3:24:01.620 --> 3:24:03.620]  their population to the floor.
[3:24:03.620 --> 3:24:06.620]  They trusted their own population to engage
[3:24:06.620 --> 3:24:09.620]  in these less severe social distancing measures.
[3:24:09.620 --> 3:24:12.620]  And look what happened. We were proven right once again.
[3:24:12.620 --> 3:24:15.620]  And by the way, I was wrong about this from the start.
[3:24:15.620 --> 3:24:18.620]  Because I saw the threat of coronavirus.
[3:24:18.620 --> 3:24:20.620]  I saw people like de Blasio,
[3:24:20.620 --> 3:24:22.620]  people like Nancy Pelosi downplaying it.
[3:24:22.620 --> 3:24:25.620]  But as soon as it became politically advantageous,
[3:24:25.620 --> 3:24:27.620]  of course, they completely exaggerated it,
[3:24:27.620 --> 3:24:30.620]  exploited it for political grits.
[3:24:30.620 --> 3:24:34.620]  We have this headline out of Summit.News in Sweden
[3:24:34.620 --> 3:24:36.620]  where there was no lockdown,
[3:24:36.620 --> 3:24:40.620]  COVID cases and deaths have slowed to a trickle.
[3:24:40.620 --> 3:24:44.620]  The death rate is lower than Spain, the UK, and Italy,
[3:24:44.620 --> 3:24:47.620]  and their economy is in far better shape.
[3:24:47.620 --> 3:24:50.620]  They haven't destroyed the future of their next generation.
[3:24:50.620 --> 3:24:53.620]  Confounding claims by many
[3:24:53.620 --> 3:24:56.620]  that its open society approach to coronavirus
[3:24:56.620 --> 3:24:58.620]  would spectacularly backfire,
[3:24:58.620 --> 3:25:01.620]  which of course all the wanted health experts said it would at the start.
[3:25:01.620 --> 3:25:05.620]  Sweden, which didn't enforce any mandatory lockdown order,
[3:25:05.620 --> 3:25:11.620]  has seen its coronavirus cases and deaths slow to a trickle.
[3:25:11.620 --> 3:25:13.620]  Back in March, when Sweden announced
[3:25:13.620 --> 3:25:16.620]  it would adopt a different approach than much of the rest of the world
[3:25:16.620 --> 3:25:18.620]  and aim for herd immunity,
[3:25:18.620 --> 3:25:21.620]  which of course was Boris Johnson's initial policy
[3:25:21.620 --> 3:25:25.620]  before he was stampeded and scare mongered into changing it
[3:25:25.620 --> 3:25:29.620]  to go for this global WHO lockdown policy.
[3:25:29.620 --> 3:25:33.620]  In Sweden, public health experts and media commentators
[3:25:33.620 --> 3:25:35.620]  were aghast at the decision,
[3:25:35.620 --> 3:25:38.620]  warning that the country's hospitals would be overwhelmed with COVID victims,
[3:25:38.620 --> 3:25:41.620]  summing up the attitude towards Sweden's approach.
[3:25:41.620 --> 3:25:44.620]  British journalist, Lisbeth Davidson,
[3:25:44.620 --> 3:25:47.620]  said it was, quote, like watching a horror movie.
[3:25:47.620 --> 3:25:49.620]  Fast forward five months,
[3:25:49.620 --> 3:25:53.620]  and the horror show predicted by many has completely failed to materialize.
[3:25:53.620 --> 3:25:56.620]  Again, this is the country that imposed no lockdown.
[3:25:56.620 --> 3:25:59.620]  They kept the schools open. They kept the restaurants open.
[3:25:59.620 --> 3:26:01.620]  They kept the businesses open.
[3:26:01.620 --> 3:26:04.620]  They did not mandate mask wearing and what happened.
[3:26:04.620 --> 3:26:08.620]  While fears of a second wave of coronavirus continue to plague other European countries,
[3:26:08.620 --> 3:26:12.620]  that completely locked down and enforced draconian face mask rules,
[3:26:12.620 --> 3:26:18.620]  Sweden has recorded barely a trickle of COVID cases and deaths so far in August.
[3:26:18.620 --> 3:26:21.620]  We have the numbers in this graph
[3:26:21.620 --> 3:26:27.620]  up on the screen from the article of course, Newsweek reported on this last week as well.
[3:26:27.620 --> 3:26:32.620]  In August, Sweden has registered just one death from the coronavirus.
[3:26:32.620 --> 3:26:34.620]  One death alone.
[3:26:34.620 --> 3:26:36.620]  The story is the same in hospitals.
[3:26:36.620 --> 3:26:39.620]  COVID-19 is hardly registering as a blip on the radar.
[3:26:39.620 --> 3:26:45.620]  Sweden has reported just four new COVID-19 patients in their ICUs in August.
[3:26:45.620 --> 3:26:47.620]  Because as I was talking about earlier in the show,
[3:26:47.620 --> 3:26:52.620]  New Zealand had four new cases and locked down massive areas of their country.
[3:26:52.620 --> 3:26:57.620]  The month of July saw only 52 COVID-19 patients in ICUs.
[3:26:57.620 --> 3:27:00.620]  It doesn't take a math whiz to come to the conclusion that the epidemic
[3:27:00.620 --> 3:27:03.620]  appears to have been wrapped up in Sweden for months.
[3:27:03.620 --> 3:27:07.620]  Again, because they've partly achieved herd immunity.
[3:27:07.620 --> 3:27:10.620]  Asserting that there is no evidence anywhere in the world
[3:27:10.620 --> 3:27:14.620]  that lockdowns or masks have stopped the spread of the virus.
[3:27:14.620 --> 3:27:18.620]  Again, those masks everyone's wearing don't stop 97% of particles.
[3:27:18.620 --> 3:27:21.620]  They're completely pointless.
[3:27:21.620 --> 3:27:24.620]  Shachtel notes how public health experts disregarding
[3:27:24.620 --> 3:27:27.620]  hundreds of years of proven science on herd immunity
[3:27:27.620 --> 3:27:34.620]  who are responsible for the economic catastrophe which the world will now suffer.
[3:27:34.620 --> 3:27:39.620]  100 million in extreme poverty as I'm going to get on to in the next article.
[3:27:39.620 --> 3:27:42.620]  But as Newsweek acknowledged last week,
[3:27:42.620 --> 3:27:45.620]  Sweden's COVID-19 death rate is lower than Spain, UK and Italy
[3:27:45.620 --> 3:27:48.620]  countries which all imposed lockdowns.
[3:27:48.620 --> 3:27:51.620]  In the case of Spain and Italy, draconian lockdowns.
[3:27:51.620 --> 3:27:54.620]  Then you compare the GDP falls.
[3:27:54.620 --> 3:27:59.620]  I think in the UK, we had a GDP drop of more than 20%
[3:27:59.620 --> 3:28:01.620]  similar case in other European countries.
[3:28:01.620 --> 3:28:07.620]  Sweden's GDP fall in the second quarter of 2020 is only 8.6%.
[3:28:07.620 --> 3:28:11.620]  Of course, they were somewhat impacted by the rest of the world
[3:28:11.620 --> 3:28:14.620]  locking down, but in comparison to other countries in the euro zone,
[3:28:14.620 --> 3:28:19.620]  they've escaped relatively injury-free in terms of ruining
[3:28:19.620 --> 3:28:23.620]  the economic prospects of their next generation.
[3:28:23.620 --> 3:28:27.620]  So Sweden didn't lock down and enforce any of this face-mass tyranny.
[3:28:27.620 --> 3:28:30.620]  They've come through the virus. There's no second wave.
[3:28:30.620 --> 3:28:32.620]  The hospitals are not overrun.
[3:28:32.620 --> 3:28:37.620]  They've had one coronavirus death this month.
[3:28:37.620 --> 3:28:41.620]  Absolutely incredible given that all the same health experts at the start
[3:28:41.620 --> 3:28:44.620]  of this pandemic, or a little way into it at least,
[3:28:44.620 --> 3:28:49.620]  were literally predicting death on a scale of hundreds of thousands
[3:28:49.620 --> 3:28:50.620]  of people in Sweden.
[3:28:50.620 --> 3:28:56.620]  They've had 5,000 total deaths and now they've basically got through the pandemic.
[3:28:56.620 --> 3:28:59.620]  Their economy survived. They have a trickle of cases.
[3:28:59.620 --> 3:29:06.620]  Meanwhile, global lockdown is set to plunge 100 million into extreme poverty.
[3:29:06.620 --> 3:29:12.620]  And of course, that's not even mentioning the 50,000 cancer deaths
[3:29:12.620 --> 3:29:14.620]  minimum in the United Kingdom.
[3:29:14.620 --> 3:29:20.620]  Bearing in mind, we've had around 50,000 corona deaths, 50,000 deaths
[3:29:20.620 --> 3:29:26.620]  of just cancer victims, that's excess cancer deaths because people didn't
[3:29:26.620 --> 3:29:30.620]  get the treatment they needed during that whole pandemic period
[3:29:30.620 --> 3:29:34.620]  over the past five months because they were either denied it because we said
[3:29:34.620 --> 3:29:38.620]  they told us the hospitals were overloaded while all the nurses were rehearsing
[3:29:38.620 --> 3:29:44.620]  to pick up dances for three months, or because they were afraid to go into
[3:29:44.620 --> 3:29:48.620]  the hospitals because of this hysteria from the media that has resulted,
[3:29:48.620 --> 3:29:54.620]  as I said before the break, in seven people in the UK believing 7% of the
[3:29:54.620 --> 3:29:56.620]  population is dead from coronavirus.
[3:29:56.620 --> 3:29:58.620]  That's 5 million people.
[3:29:58.620 --> 3:30:04.620]  It's actually been 50,000, 100 times less.
[3:30:04.620 --> 3:30:08.620]  Simply because of the hysteria put out by the media. In the United States,
[3:30:08.620 --> 3:30:13.620]  people believe coronavirus has killed 30 million people.
[3:30:13.620 --> 3:30:16.620]  It's killed what, at last count, 165,000?
[3:30:16.620 --> 3:30:18.620]  Is that terrible? Yes, it's bad.
[3:30:18.620 --> 3:30:23.620]  Would 85 to 90% of those people have died anyway because they were old and ill
[3:30:23.620 --> 3:30:25.620]  and infirm? Yes.
[3:30:25.620 --> 3:30:29.620]  The total number of deaths as a result of global poverty, people being denied
[3:30:29.620 --> 3:30:32.620]  treatment, people being afraid to get treatment, people not getting treated
[3:30:32.620 --> 3:30:38.620]  for TB will kill millions, millions more than coronavirus itself ever did.
[3:30:38.620 --> 3:30:40.620]  August 2020 is here.
[3:30:40.620 --> 3:30:43.620]  It's less than 90 days out from the historic election.
[3:30:43.620 --> 3:30:47.620]  The Chi Coms, the EU, Hollywood, the Democratic Party and the blue states
[3:30:47.620 --> 3:30:52.620]  and blue cities are all battling to keep America shut down and to destroy
[3:30:52.620 --> 3:30:56.620]  free speech as well to ensure their final takeover of the United States
[3:30:56.620 --> 3:30:59.620]  by removing President Donald John Trump.

[3:32:35.620 --> 3:32:39.620]  Thanks, dad, for all your support.

[3:32:44.620 --> 3:32:49.620]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[3:32:49.620 --> 3:32:53.620]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.

[3:33:18.620 --> 3:33:22.620]  The breeze in the ion cluster patented technology used in the system

[3:34:12.620 --> 3:34:14.620]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[3:34:14.620 --> 3:34:16.620]  Some like bodies better.
[3:34:16.620 --> 3:34:20.620]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[3:34:20.620 --> 3:34:21.620]  And they fund the Infowar.

[3:36:31.620 --> 3:36:34.620]  And it all goes to supporting this network.
[3:36:34.620 --> 3:36:43.620]  One of the lone voices standing out against this coronavirus hysteria, which I said before the break, according to many experts now.
[3:36:43.620 --> 3:36:47.620]  The hysteria will kill more people than the virus itself.
[3:36:47.620 --> 3:36:50.620]  It's already killing people who can't get hospital treatment.
[3:36:50.620 --> 3:36:54.620]  We now see the draconian lockdown in places like Melbourne, Australia.
[3:36:54.620 --> 3:36:57.620]  And you can bet when the vaccine comes along, it's only going to get worse.
[3:36:57.620 --> 3:37:05.620]  So please support us and get your own food insurance by getting the line of storeable food at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:37:05.620 --> 3:37:15.620]  Now, the Mr Bean star, the British comedian Rowan Atkinson has come out today and joined a growing backlash against the Scottish government's proposed hate crime bill.
[3:37:15.620 --> 3:37:25.620]  The main fear is it could limit freedom of expression. Of course, Scotland is one of the most draconian countries in the Western world when it comes to restricting freedom of speech.
[3:37:25.620 --> 3:37:37.620]  You said you saw what they did to Count Dankula, Marcus Meacham, with his quote, Nazi pug and how they tried to put him in prison for that for a joke.
[3:37:37.620 --> 3:37:47.620]  Well, now a comedy legend has joined more than 20 prominent cultural figures in signing a letter which calls on Hollywood ministers to make significant changes to the new legislation.
[3:37:47.620 --> 3:37:51.620]  So Rowan Atkinson is coming out in support of that because it could literally end comedy.
[3:37:51.620 --> 3:38:04.620]  And on that very subject, we now have this very insightful quote which was put out today, which I tweeted, called Comedians Against Comedy. Let's take a look.
[3:38:04.620 --> 3:38:08.620]  It's 2020. The time for laughter is over.
[3:38:08.620 --> 3:38:13.620]  See, a lot of people think that being a comedian is about getting laughs, writing jokes, or creating content.
[3:38:13.620 --> 3:38:21.620]  But being a real comedian is about preventing others from getting laughs, writing naughty lists, and having content removed from platforms of all kinds.
[3:38:21.620 --> 3:38:29.620]  We are comedians against comedy represent a growing number of comedians who strive to remove all comedy that isn't in direct alignment with Dove Soap's publicity team.
[3:38:29.620 --> 3:38:35.620]  Call us crazy, but we subscribe to the idea that being a comedian is about challenging the idea that comedians should be challenging ideas.
[3:38:35.620 --> 3:38:41.620]  It's about making a category of comedy that we deem unacceptable and then lumping all of our peers into that category.
[3:38:41.620 --> 3:38:46.620]  This is a window of acceptable thought. The comedy we allow takes place here.
[3:38:46.620 --> 3:38:49.620]  Real comedy is about supporting political agendas.
[3:38:49.620 --> 3:38:51.620]  Propaganda, if you will.
[3:38:51.620 --> 3:38:55.620]  I'm just writing a list of 20 fellow comedians I want to have excommunicated.
[3:38:55.620 --> 3:38:59.620]  Preventing comedy from happening is no laughing matter. That's why I study the greats.
[3:38:59.620 --> 3:39:04.620]  Carlin, Chappelle, Burrs, material for problematic topics I can cancel them for.
[3:39:04.620 --> 3:39:09.620]  Sometimes you just have to put pen to pad, writing angry letters to comedy clubs about which comedians shouldn't perform there.
[3:39:09.620 --> 3:39:17.620]  Stopping comedy has been a journey, you know. I started cancelling open my comics back in Buffalo, and now here I am cancelling comics in the New York City club scene.
[3:39:17.620 --> 3:39:19.620]  That's why he's one of the best cancillers in the business.
[3:39:19.620 --> 3:39:24.620]  You're being too kind. I'm just a hack club comic canceler. This guy cancels clean.
[3:39:24.620 --> 3:39:30.620]  Guilty. I do tend to cancel clean comics. There's nothing wrong with cancelling road comics. I just want to challenge myself.
[3:39:30.620 --> 3:39:33.620]  Soup Nazi. It's got to be something, right?
[3:39:33.620 --> 3:39:36.620]  I've done 37 late night specs and I have 1,500 Twitter followers.
[3:39:36.620 --> 3:39:39.620]  Lately we've taken a shining to crowd work canceling.
[3:39:39.620 --> 3:39:44.620]  Yeah, but we don't want to be seen just as crowd work cancelers. We still cancel comics with punchlines too.
[3:39:44.620 --> 3:39:49.620]  I think Chappelle might have said something problematic in his latest special. We call that a cancel callback.
[3:39:49.620 --> 3:39:51.620]  Today's the day the laughter died.
[3:39:51.620 --> 3:39:57.620]  Oh, I just booked another festival. And we encourage audience members to be part of the solution by watching comedy in bad faith.
[3:39:57.620 --> 3:40:00.620]  Arms crossed, angry, even if it's your day off.
[3:40:00.620 --> 3:40:02.620]  Laughter is the worst medicine.
[3:40:02.620 --> 3:40:05.620]  You know what's more cathartic than laughter? A venomous retweet.
[3:40:05.620 --> 3:40:08.620]  They want me to do 20 minutes? That's going to be a problem.
[3:40:08.620 --> 3:40:13.620]  Join us and a growing group of comedians who say no to laughter and no to comedy.
[3:40:13.620 --> 3:40:15.620]  Times up comedy.
[3:40:15.620 --> 3:40:16.620]  Times up comedy.
[3:40:16.620 --> 3:40:18.620]  North Korea does comedy right.
[3:40:18.620 --> 3:40:24.620]  Between me and you, he's a bit of a cancel thief. He just retweets my cancels.
[3:40:24.620 --> 3:40:35.620]  Now, of course, with the reemergence of Black Lives Matter, we have entire comedy shows being wiped from the face of history from these online on demand services.
[3:40:35.620 --> 3:40:41.620]  We've had that in the UK where they tried to do it to faulty towers. There was enough of a backlash for that to come back.
[3:40:41.620 --> 3:40:50.620]  But with Little Britain and other shows, they're being wiped from history altogether. Again, thanks to Black Lives Matter, the Marxist organization,
[3:40:50.620 --> 3:40:58.620]  literally founded by people who worship a cop killing domestic terrorist fugitive, who's on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list.
[3:40:58.620 --> 3:41:07.620]  And in fact, the salient upstanding member of the community that triggered the riots in Chicago a couple of nights ago.
[3:41:07.620 --> 3:41:10.620]  By the way, that story disappeared quickly, didn't it?
[3:41:10.620 --> 3:41:16.620]  You think of that story happening at any other time in recent American history before the last couple of years?
[3:41:16.620 --> 3:41:23.620]  Hundreds of people rioting and looting in Chicago. That would have been a top story for at least a week. It's already disappeared.
[3:41:23.620 --> 3:41:29.620]  Now we find out what prompted it. This is out of information liberation.
[3:41:29.620 --> 3:41:36.620]  Luttrell Allen, meet the 20 year old gangbanger who shoot out with police triggered mass looting in Chicago.
[3:41:36.620 --> 3:41:45.620]  This was the venerated upstanding member of the community that many people who would normally be sympathetic with BLM cited as the reason for why they were
[3:41:45.620 --> 3:41:49.620]  shoplifting luxury items from department stores in downtown Chicago.
[3:41:49.620 --> 3:41:56.620]  Well, it turns out the gangbanger who's a lead shootout with police in Englewood triggered mass looting in Chicago on Sunday night.
[3:41:56.620 --> 3:42:07.620]  He's been identified as 20 year old Luttrell Allen, who was charged on Monday for attempted murder of police. His rap sheet includes previous arrests for child endangerment, domestic battery and burglary,
[3:42:07.620 --> 3:42:10.620]  another upstanding member of the community.
[3:42:10.620 --> 3:42:15.620]  Here's a story which again, like the Chicago riots will disappear overnight, not even that.
[3:42:15.620 --> 3:42:20.620]  As far as I've seen, it's not even being reported on by the likes of CNN or MSNBC.
[3:42:20.620 --> 3:42:31.620]  I can't imagine if a white person walked up to a five year old black kid in his backyard and shot him in the head for the crime of riding his bike on his property.
[3:42:31.620 --> 3:42:35.620]  I mean, that would be George Floyd on steroids. That would be George Floyd times 100.
[3:42:35.620 --> 3:42:38.620]  It happened in North Carolina. It's barely a news story.
[3:42:38.620 --> 3:42:40.620]  National file reports.
[3:42:40.620 --> 3:42:45.620]  Black man executes white child in broad daylight in North Carolina neighborhood.
[3:42:45.620 --> 3:42:53.620]  A five year old boy was shot in the head and killed in broad daylight in the North Carolina neighborhood after it was alleged that he had ridden his bike into a neighbor's yard.
[3:42:53.620 --> 3:43:03.620]  Cannon Hinnon, five years old, was riding his bike with his sisters in a Wilson, North Carolina neighborhood on a summer's day outside his father's house when his young life was cut short.
[3:43:03.620 --> 3:43:15.620]  Joining his family members, he rode his bike onto the neighbor's property, prompting Darius Sessoms, another upstanding member of the community, 25 years old, to shoot him in the head at point blank range.
[3:43:15.620 --> 3:43:18.620]  His sisters, seven and eight, saw their brother get shot.
[3:43:18.620 --> 3:43:21.620]  Can you imagine the abject horror of this?
[3:43:21.620 --> 3:43:27.620]  On a Sunday afternoon, a five year old kid on his bike getting shot in the head.
[3:43:27.620 --> 3:43:33.620]  And can you imagine if the roles were reversed and what black lives matter would have to say about this?
[3:43:33.620 --> 3:43:37.620]  I mean, forget riots. They'd be outright civil war.
[3:43:37.620 --> 3:43:42.620]  There's on Sunday, August 9th, sweets all named Cannon Hinnon was taken from this world over a senseless act.
[3:43:42.620 --> 3:43:49.620]  One minute he's enjoying his life. The next it all ends because he rode his neighbor's yard.
[3:43:49.620 --> 3:43:52.620]  That's going to disappear very quickly, isn't it?
[3:43:52.620 --> 3:43:59.620]  Just like the woman on the bridge in Indianapolis, who was shot also in the head for saying white lives matter.
[3:43:59.620 --> 3:44:02.620]  Not even that, in fact, she said all lives matter.
[3:44:02.620 --> 3:44:09.620]  And for that crime, he was shot in the head again, barely made the news was disappeared from the news within two days.
[3:44:09.620 --> 3:44:13.620]  Meanwhile, Biden splashes mendacious Gallant gasoline on the riots.
[3:44:13.620 --> 3:44:19.620]  He tweeted it's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson, reigniting a movement.
[3:44:19.620 --> 3:44:23.620]  We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism reforming policing.
[3:44:23.620 --> 3:44:27.620]  Of course, Michael Brown never said hands up, don't shoot.
[3:44:27.620 --> 3:44:32.620]  The very foundation of the entire black lives matter movement was a lie.
[3:44:32.620 --> 3:44:35.620]  Michael Brown again was another career criminal.
[3:44:35.620 --> 3:44:39.620]  Michael Brown charged officer Darren Wilson and tried to grab his gun.
[3:44:39.620 --> 3:44:45.620]  That's why he was shot dead. Joe Biden, like a lot of things seems to have forgotten about that.
[3:44:45.620 --> 3:44:52.620]  Meanwhile, Seattle business owners who had their windows smashed by BLM say they still support BLM.
[3:44:52.620 --> 3:44:55.620]  They had their windows smashed over and over again.
[3:44:55.620 --> 3:45:05.620]  The business old owners told Como News they were fed up after eight premises were targeted by vandals during another round of violent unrest last night on Seattle's first hill.
[3:45:05.620 --> 3:45:14.620]  And the quotations giving given to the news outlets say they're you know, they're a little bit fed up with it, but black lives do matter.
[3:45:14.620 --> 3:45:16.620]  So that gives them the right to trash our properties.
[3:45:16.620 --> 3:45:22.620]  We now have 75 consecutive nights of rioting in Portland. Will it ever end?
[3:45:22.620 --> 3:45:47.620]  It's going to wrap it up war. I'm coming out next breaking news at summit dot news. Don't go away.
