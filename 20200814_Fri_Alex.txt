[00:00.000 --> 00:21.740]  If you watch this video, you're going to be impatient.
[00:21.740 --> 00:50.140]  Okay guys so as you can see no one in Austin gives a damn about this blockade so I want
[00:50.140 --> 00:54.940]  to point something out to you guys now Alex went viral on Twitter because he was at Barton
[00:54.940 --> 00:59.020]  Springs they wouldn't let him in apparently you now need a reservation but this is the
[00:59.020 --> 01:02.940]  free side of Barton Springs there's a pay side and a free side this is the free side
[01:02.940 --> 01:07.380]  it's just a part of nature just like Zilger Park it's a big-ass grass field where people
[01:07.380 --> 01:12.580]  can go and this is the free side of Barton and you have this this huge freaking thing
[01:12.580 --> 01:18.620]  here so I'm just gonna you know public service right now I'm sorry but someone's gotta do
[01:18.620 --> 01:32.700]  it oh look the lifeguards are coming hey guys so we're now in the free side of Barton
[01:32.700 --> 01:37.960]  and did you guys see how easy that was no face masks no fines no police officers no one
[01:37.960 --> 01:42.900]  stopping us from doing this why because this is nature and we in Austin the people who
[01:42.900 --> 01:48.600]  pay the taxpayers who pay for all these natural parks should be able to access them so here
[01:48.600 --> 01:53.260]  we are in Barton now and as you guys can see in front of me there's so many people in here
[01:53.260 --> 02:00.260]  why because nobody cares about these mandates anymore for COVID-19 everyone knows it's ridiculous
[02:00.260 --> 02:05.180]  there's no overrun hospitals here in Austin people are not dying in the streets and people
[02:05.180 --> 02:09.780]  should be able to go outside for their own personal health and experience nature you
[02:09.780 --> 02:17.180]  know guys I've been stuck inside of my apartment for the past three months because of me or
[02:17.180 --> 02:32.020]  others walk down orders and it's time to rage America oh America look at this dog free
[02:32.020 --> 02:38.820]  where's your mask sir where's your mask the dog rest him now close but we're already inside
[02:38.820 --> 02:54.020]  Mayor Adler to close we say the parks are open come on in guys the parks are only closed
[02:54.020 --> 03:00.020]  if you want them to be don't wear a face mask and go to your national parks nothing go in
[03:00.020 --> 03:21.460]  there guy well you don't need to be videoing me just saying you don't need to be videoing
[03:21.460 --> 03:43.740]  me yes ma'am I'm sorry enjoy your day go have fun in nature be healthy so guys you see why
[03:43.740 --> 03:47.940]  they just said that they did that because everyone else is doing it and I want us to
[03:47.940 --> 03:52.940]  take this exact same mentality when it comes to face if everyone stops wearing face masks
[03:52.940 --> 03:56.540]  everyone else is going to stop wearing face masks why because everyone has the sheep like
[03:56.540 --> 04:02.540]  mentality that they're going to follow with the mask doing the full report is at band
[04:02.540 --> 04:06.940]  dot video it needs to be shared my video getting the parks reopened they have reopened them
[04:06.940 --> 04:14.620]  after we went down there got 10 million views last time I checked or more hers is 10 times
[04:14.620 --> 04:19.100]  better she did a perfect job I got about a C- but I got an A for effort so that Hernandez
[04:19.100 --> 04:24.700]  knocked it out of the park a grand slam a Babe Ruth level event if this was baseball
[04:24.700 --> 04:29.460]  action seven opens Barton Springs the public this is a microcosm of victory every time
[04:29.460 --> 04:33.980]  we take action we have victory but we always sit on our hands well you know it's worse
[04:33.980 --> 04:39.140]  than that we sit on our thumbs and just let these criminals run rampant over us but Savannah
[04:39.140 --> 04:42.420]  I didn't tell her to do that I said she got on the report she tore down all the fences
[04:42.420 --> 04:46.420]  everybody was already pouring through so there you go and tear down the new world order tear
[04:46.420 --> 04:51.460]  down your robots and we'll tear the globalist political guts out of their slimy you know
[04:51.460 --> 05:04.820]  what's there with us incrementalism the inchworm effect successive approximation first they
[05:04.820 --> 05:09.740]  tell you only stay in your house for 15 days so the hospitals can stay empty that was all
[05:09.740 --> 05:15.140]  a fraud then wear a mask for a month here we are six months later then they start making
[05:15.140 --> 05:20.740]  people at colleges and at big corporations where wristbands showing that they've been
[05:20.740 --> 05:26.940]  quote contact traced and tested for COVID then comes the apps on your phones and the global
[05:26.940 --> 05:32.220]  social credit score now being rolled out by Virginia California and others it's not coming
[05:32.220 --> 05:37.020]  it's here and then the inoculations if you ever want to leave your house which amounts
[05:37.020 --> 05:42.980]  to force inoculations this is the medical tyranny takeover these are not classic vaccines
[05:42.980 --> 05:47.900]  that have their own problems these are DNA vaccines that change your DNA and are having
[05:47.900 --> 05:54.460]  massive serious side effects guaranteed this is about depopulation Bill Gates admits that
[05:54.460 --> 06:03.300]  this is an emergency resist or die the new world order is here right now there is no
[06:03.300 --> 06:20.300]  government official here but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people but
[06:20.300 --> 06:50.140]  I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people the press is not the enemy of
[06:50.140 --> 06:54.220]  the people maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks
[06:54.220 --> 07:00.660]  and fake news maybe we should go out all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant
[07:00.660 --> 07:15.460]  we're not the enemy of the people we're not the enemy of the people we're not the enemy
[07:15.460 --> 07:40.140]  of the people we're not the enemy of the people this is CNN
[07:40.140 --> 07:52.500]  he said that was basically based on the town he grew up in I guess in North Carolina lot
[07:52.500 --> 07:57.140]  more empathy a lot nicer people a lot more down to earth folks that knew how to skin
[07:57.140 --> 08:04.900]  a buck around a trot line America was by and large Mayberry RFB but we're not any more
[08:04.900 --> 08:13.580]  are we we're new world order cyberpunk nightmare dystopia and things are getting bad real fast
[08:13.580 --> 08:20.180]  because we took God out of our lives and we made ourselves God and so that means the
[08:20.180 --> 08:26.700]  very worst of us are now in charge who have no empathy no compassion and who actually
[08:26.700 --> 08:33.700]  enjoy hurting and destroying people and vandalizing civilization and giant hordes of dumb down
[08:33.700 --> 08:41.780]  satanist who don't even know their satanist screeching and squawking and demanding total
[08:41.780 --> 08:50.740]  power and total control you know the little boy that got killed because he was white and
[08:50.740 --> 08:56.740]  shot multiple times the back of the head leftist celebrated that on Twitter and they celebrated
[08:56.740 --> 09:03.020]  it as a racial attack because that's what the left has turned those quote minorities
[09:03.020 --> 09:08.660]  that are now the majority into in many cases is hateful venomous monsters but the little
[09:08.660 --> 09:15.700]  boy we're now hearing about because independent media reported on it back when it happened
[09:15.700 --> 09:22.900]  last weekend and finally seeing and others have been shamed but when you go to the reports
[09:22.900 --> 09:29.220]  you don't see a picture of the perpetrator because you cannot show a black person killing
[09:29.220 --> 09:34.140]  a white person and now the statistics the FBI does not release because it's the latest
[09:34.140 --> 09:38.660]  numbers were 12 to 1 black on white crime now do we then say black people are inherently
[09:38.660 --> 09:44.260]  bad evil and it's their fault no the media encourages this the media says it's a good
[09:44.260 --> 09:53.100]  thing black on white crime in the 40s was about even but see it's it's it's seen that
[09:53.100 --> 09:59.260]  well whites deserve to die because we're inherently bad there's a story up on info wars dot com
[09:59.260 --> 10:08.620]  kindergartners learn that not hating the cops and not watching the news is white supremacy
[10:08.620 --> 10:17.500]  white supremacy and of course our top nuclear scientists that build our bombs are sent by
[10:17.500 --> 10:23.300]  the federal government to three-day training seminars where they're taught whiteness is
[10:23.300 --> 10:31.700]  inherently evil now I want to say something that's really important here the the globalist
[10:31.700 --> 10:36.340]  are gaslighting everyone the globalist are saying two plus two equals a hundred they
[10:36.340 --> 10:42.220]  have an impossible job and if you go to the live news headline for today's show that's
[10:42.220 --> 10:48.220]  perfect for you to send out the friends family neighbors it says right there that the globalist
[10:48.220 --> 10:55.900]  and their world government plan will fail because they have an impossible job but that
[10:55.900 --> 11:00.100]  doesn't mean in the process of trying to set up this post human world that these crazies
[11:00.100 --> 11:05.900]  are building in their power grab that it won't destroy the planet perhaps in the process
[11:05.900 --> 11:13.900]  much watch must watch friday live austinites revolt against covid lockdown tear down barricades
[11:13.900 --> 11:17.940]  and the subhead line learn by the new world orders post human plan is doomed to fail tune
[11:17.940 --> 11:25.620]  into the number one information warfare transmission on earth and our weapon is the truth and consistency
[11:25.620 --> 11:33.980]  and steadfastness and determination total commitment but once you research this information
[11:33.980 --> 11:39.700]  and find out it's true well you'll be committed as well because it's the animating contest
[11:39.700 --> 11:46.860]  of overcoming tyranny that empowers you not the degrading contest of laying down on your
[11:46.860 --> 11:51.340]  belly like a snake and then groveling to the new world order and just hoping they eat you
[11:51.340 --> 11:59.060]  last we're not adapting to being slaves we are overcoming this great test and it's going
[11:59.060 --> 12:05.380]  to be great and most of us will probably end up dying early most of us are already soft
[12:05.380 --> 12:10.500]  killed walking dead it's going to get really bad and really obvious with the 6g the 7g
[12:10.500 --> 12:13.620]  you'll be bleeding out your nose or teeth falling out by the time you're 20 cancers
[12:13.620 --> 12:19.220]  all over your body bill gates dancing around on tv laughing at you as your ruler but everyone
[12:19.220 --> 12:28.620]  who's been in denial will be forced to admit the truth of the horror the horror so why
[12:28.620 --> 12:36.060]  did I start a little Mars attacks piece where CNN is the allegory of the eight the aliens
[12:36.060 --> 12:40.260]  invading and they're running around broadcasting don't run we are your friends and people stop
[12:40.260 --> 12:45.340]  and try to shake their hands and they shoot them with their ray guns and the aliens go
[12:45.340 --> 12:53.340]  because it's funny to the anti-human globalist to be doing all of this and and to have full
[12:53.340 --> 12:59.660]  page cover stories in the wall street journal and the new york times and in the houston
[12:59.660 --> 13:13.060]  chronicle and wired magazine saying we don't want humans to be on the earth we're a parasite
[13:13.060 --> 13:17.660]  and we can't wait till we set up world government and have the orderly phase out of humanity
[13:17.660 --> 13:24.020]  that's the official plan imagine if a religious group came to your door went oh here's our
[13:24.020 --> 13:28.060]  brochure we want to establish a world government with robots controlling people and then make
[13:28.060 --> 13:31.540]  the world so hellish that no one can even have children anymore and then force people
[13:31.540 --> 13:35.940]  to to give up their soul and be uploaded into a machine where they believe they'll be given
[13:35.940 --> 13:42.900]  eternal life you call the fbi after they left your house you give them some tea and cookies
[13:42.900 --> 13:47.940]  it's ahead there's a cult they're wanting to kill everybody oh but when it's bill gates
[13:47.940 --> 13:58.140]  doing it it's a good thing oh billy boy save us and so it's the same thing don't run we
[13:58.140 --> 14:03.060]  are your friends while they attack you oh i'm bill gates i believe there's too many people
[14:03.060 --> 14:08.140]  i want to have zero carbon output by humans and the ted talk group laughs because that
[14:08.140 --> 14:14.260]  means kill all the humans but it's all their little joke with algebra it's algebra high
[14:14.260 --> 14:18.420]  school algebra means kill all the humans and they all giggle and laugh because they know
[14:18.420 --> 14:23.860]  the public's gonna look at that and not know what that means it's funny to them but here's
[14:23.860 --> 14:29.020]  the thing it's just like the comic bill burr i played a clip of yesterday he's like laughing
[14:29.020 --> 14:32.980]  on yeah we need to kill 85 percent of the planet they're all a bunch of dumb scum and the and
[14:32.980 --> 14:38.980]  the people on the netflix show are clapping and guaranteed half their kids are gonna die
[14:38.980 --> 14:43.580]  cancer before they die guaranteed they're all gonna have neurological disorders but you
[14:43.580 --> 14:47.700]  know by the time they're 50 if they're 25 right now i mean they're all gonna have horribly
[14:47.700 --> 14:51.900]  painful deaths gonna be sucked right out of by this thing and it's gonna get worse and
[14:51.900 --> 14:56.580]  worse where it's not one out of ten kids with cancer it's one out of three i mean just murdering
[14:56.580 --> 15:05.780]  everyone just incrementally turning it up and they're all because their empathy has been
[15:05.780 --> 15:09.460]  taken out of them so we come back i'm gonna show you the the empathy black lives matter
[15:09.460 --> 15:13.660]  in antifa attacking an emergency children's hospital while little kids are inside trying
[15:13.660 --> 15:17.020]  to burn it down and i'm gonna show you black lives matter go to people's houses and saying
[15:17.020 --> 15:22.260]  give us your money your houses everything we're here we support crime they actually say we
[15:22.260 --> 15:28.580]  support crime and you go why would they say that because there's no bottom to it that's
[15:28.580 --> 15:34.260]  what the globalist have created zombie like monsters that literally believe they have
[15:34.260 --> 15:38.900]  the moral authority of the establishment to bring everything down of course they're not
[15:38.900 --> 15:43.100]  gonna get anything once everything's destroyed they're just being used to take down the pro
[15:43.100 --> 15:49.820]  human infrastructure but it doesn't make them any less dangerous because they're fluoridated
[15:49.820 --> 15:59.340]  zombies from birth they're right back stay with us attention attention attention do anyone
[15:59.340 --> 16:04.940]  that still wants to live in a free country the new world order chi com globalist syndicate
[16:04.940 --> 16:10.020]  is making its move to implode the dollar and thrust the united states into a civil war
[16:10.020 --> 16:14.780]  by contesting the election they are openly wargaming this at the highest levels of democratic
[16:14.780 --> 16:20.020]  party Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election
[16:20.020 --> 16:25.940]  trump is going they will hold a separate inauguration for biden and kamala harris and that anyone
[16:25.940 --> 16:30.460]  challenging that will be called a racist they will then trigger race riots and violence
[16:30.460 --> 16:36.500]  they've already beta tested around the country we are not living in normal times when these
[16:36.500 --> 16:40.580]  types of things happen in history people are usually caught flat footed because they can't
[16:40.580 --> 16:45.860]  believe that they're living in such a criminal era we are we are living in the period where
[16:45.860 --> 16:50.820]  this criminal globalist syndicate has been feeding on america is being exposed and removed
[16:50.820 --> 16:54.740]  now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country spread
[16:54.740 --> 17:01.140]  the word now paul reveres well we're six months into the cobit 19 lockdown and now democrat
[17:01.140 --> 17:04.420]  leaders are calling for people to be charged for the attempted murder if they don't wear
[17:04.420 --> 17:08.580]  the mask of the symbols of slavery and they've triggered their race riots around the country
[17:08.580 --> 17:14.020]  led by white angry liberal academics and others and now on top of the democrats are officially
[17:14.020 --> 17:18.500]  saying hey trump's going to try to steal the election and contest it but then their internal
[17:18.500 --> 17:23.180]  wargaming documents come out with john pades at the very top with kamala harris and of
[17:23.180 --> 17:27.580]  course joe biden and they're saying oh we think we're going to lose but we're going
[17:27.580 --> 17:32.060]  to have the democrat state secede claiming that joe biden has won the popular vote and
[17:32.060 --> 17:36.700]  we are then going to set up our own country and ask the military to remove trump this
[17:36.700 --> 17:40.500]  is officially in the new york times i don't just believe the new york times i've been
[17:40.500 --> 17:44.380]  telling you for over a year this is their plan from other statements they've made and
[17:44.380 --> 17:48.780]  then planet monthly the washington post the financial times of london the council and
[17:48.780 --> 17:52.860]  farm relations this is their plan we've got 80 days left to stop it what are you going
[17:52.860 --> 18:00.180]  to do i'm serious folks this is the time to save the country
[18:00.180 --> 18:29.180]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[18:29.180 --> 18:36.300]  canon hennett was brutally murdered last weekend because he was white five-year-old
[18:36.300 --> 18:44.980]  little boy and the media the enemy of the american people tried to hide it if a senseless
[18:44.980 --> 18:48.100]  white man had shot a little black boy in the back of the head i would cover it not say
[18:48.100 --> 18:53.100]  it's terrible but it would not be all white people's fault like what happened with george
[18:53.100 --> 19:03.180]  floyd and this is not all black people's fault
[19:03.180 --> 19:07.300]  i bet money you're gonna find out the individual that shot the kid was on xanax and alcohol
[19:07.300 --> 19:12.500]  or something because almost every time i see a super senseless thing like that where somebody
[19:12.500 --> 19:15.860]  kills their own kids or somebody else's kids they're on it because you drink and you take
[19:15.860 --> 19:22.580]  xanax or even methamphetamine it can put you into another world
[19:22.580 --> 19:28.700]  and imagine if a little black boy riding his bike in his front yard was senselessly murdered
[19:28.700 --> 19:35.180]  by a crazy white person and something like that's bound to happen sometime there's 330
[19:35.180 --> 19:39.420]  million people in this country the country would burn because the media would say go
[19:39.420 --> 19:46.180]  out and burn it and that's how we're primed ladies and gentlemen that when the police
[19:46.180 --> 19:52.100]  wrongfully shoot somebody which happens sometimes their people too floyd believe me they don't
[19:52.100 --> 19:57.060]  average want that to happen they get in big trouble
[19:57.060 --> 20:02.500]  you had five six years ago cops all over the u.s shot dead many of them black and semen
[20:02.500 --> 20:07.740]  would be like well people are mad so it's justified because they want to get it set where they
[20:07.740 --> 20:13.060]  can be revolutionary it's not going to empower black people to randomly shoot cops everybody
[20:13.060 --> 20:17.740]  knows that but the globalists want to break the country up so people keep saying oh they're
[20:17.740 --> 20:21.220]  going to lose with their civil war oh they're going to lose contestant election oh they're
[20:21.220 --> 20:28.300]  going to lose having the states to see it's meant to destroy the dollar and hillary came
[20:28.300 --> 20:33.460]  out and said trump is going to contest the election and she says if he tries to block
[20:33.460 --> 20:38.020]  mail-in ballots we got to remove it so see they're engaged in fraud if trump says no
[20:38.020 --> 20:48.180]  he's bad if trump wins they're not going to concede this is going to happen 80 days out
[20:48.180 --> 20:52.860]  and we're at war with communist china the globalist set china up we're at war with the globalist

[22:21.140 --> 22:26.100]  kill old people oh but he loves you here take this shot i mean none of it's even hidden
[22:26.100 --> 22:35.260]  anymore a eugenicist from a robber baron federal reserve eugenics family says he wants to get
[22:35.260 --> 22:39.260]  rid of you and your family but he's got a shot for you and then he's caught running the lab
[22:39.260 --> 22:46.540]  where it leaked out up with falchi in more than 11 operations creating chimera covid viruses
[22:46.540 --> 22:59.700]  i mean it's ridiculous let's play a few of these clips just just here clips in portland
[22:59.700 --> 23:05.380]  clips in seattle clips in chicago of them attacking children's hospitals with the children
[23:05.380 --> 23:09.940]  inside crying trying to burn them down i mean imagine being a zombie and you want to burn
[23:09.940 --> 23:18.980]  down a hospital i mean no one attacks hospitals but see no one goes and says we're going to
[23:18.980 --> 23:25.500]  burn your house down you don't know who said it you're up here to burn your house now it's
[23:25.500 --> 23:30.100]  giving your house you're like what's going on here because if you get around the left
[23:30.100 --> 23:37.660]  and what they've created people with no parents on drugs literally entitled to everything and
[23:37.660 --> 23:43.940]  the media is telling them that they're the good guys that's what our acquiescence our
[23:43.940 --> 23:48.860]  weakness has created this has created people that don't live on in the real world folks
[23:48.860 --> 24:16.700]  so go ahead and start playing the club sir it is you work for amazon don't you because
[24:16.700 --> 24:20.780]  the majority of people that live in this district now work for amazon because it's an easiest
[24:20.780 --> 24:26.140]  commute to downtown for well guess what the guy you work for is part of the problem too
[24:26.140 --> 24:34.060]  so let's not act like you just are oblivious because you know about it all along and you
[24:34.060 --> 24:38.540]  were okay with it but guess what we're not and we're bringing to your front door so
[24:38.540 --> 24:47.100]  what do you plan to do about buying the windows calling the cops and now we're turning the
[24:47.100 --> 24:49.980]  lights off because we called you a denser fire
[24:49.980 --> 25:08.940]  how do you plan so
[25:08.940 --> 25:16.540]  guys you know that you are living in historically black neighborhood right now do you know that
[25:16.540 --> 25:37.420]  people like you came in here and basically that's enough and he goes on to say give us
[25:37.420 --> 25:41.780]  the house so obviously folks don't know how this works if you own a house or you have
[25:41.780 --> 25:46.740]  a house and the value goes up you sell it and then you make more money and then they
[25:46.740 --> 25:50.900]  tear it down and build something bigger that you know I can highways come in and then you
[25:50.900 --> 25:55.620]  get bought out the idea that oh this used to be a black neighborhood and now there's
[25:55.620 --> 26:00.340]  people from all over that have moved in and so you need to give it to us randomly yelling
[26:00.340 --> 26:06.700]  at houses that's what the communists teach people and then of course we have this other
[26:06.700 --> 26:09.980]  news report I didn't have time to get to will play when we come back out of chicago where
[26:09.980 --> 26:17.540]  they attack the children's hospital and that's what the left created the left has created
[26:17.540 --> 26:22.420]  this in the universities and the systems this class envy this warfare this race war envy
[26:22.420 --> 26:30.260]  and then the left lives in on top of the people they've taught to hate themselves and who
[26:30.260 --> 26:36.220]  been disenfranchised by globalism and then trump comes in and tries to empower everybody
[26:36.220 --> 26:42.460]  and he's the bad guy because the left wants to keep those disenfranchised groups of people
[26:42.460 --> 26:48.180]  it's just beyond diabolical we can fight back your word of mouth is king king king
[26:48.180 --> 26:51.940]  it's really good news to coming up on the other side share those live links and tell
[26:51.940 --> 26:59.220]  folks about the local stations the social engineers bet on you not having a memory more
[26:59.220 --> 27:03.820]  than anything they also bet is they constantly talk about it in their own words that you
[27:03.820 --> 27:09.300]  will adapt to being a slave you will learn incrementally to submit so think about and
[27:09.300 --> 27:14.980]  remember the phases of the Fauci fraud remember that everything he said has been a premeditated
[27:14.980 --> 27:20.300]  lie they lied about where it came from they lied about person to person the UN covered
[27:20.300 --> 27:28.900]  it all up then exaggerated the death rate at 4% when it's actually 0.032 now and dropping
[27:28.900 --> 27:32.980]  then they set the test up to count almost all false positives they put the names of people
[27:32.980 --> 27:37.860]  that died of other diseases in the covid column they only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown
[27:37.860 --> 27:42.420]  now we're six months later now they say it's permanent you got to wear masks forever and
[27:42.420 --> 27:45.500]  forced inoculations are coming and they're going to track everywhere you go with what
[27:45.500 --> 27:49.220]  you do the global social credit score and the UN is the boss and anybody questioning
[27:49.220 --> 27:53.820]  it is censored off the internet loses their job that's called 21st century tyranny that's
[27:53.820 --> 28:05.780]  called world government takeover you hear that that's the March of the United Nations
[28:05.780 --> 28:11.260]  and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation coming with their battle plan psychological
[28:11.260 --> 28:17.620]  warfare operation with the forced inoculations and the permanent lockdown of civilization
[28:17.620 --> 28:22.620]  and society they're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu they're creating
[28:22.620 --> 28:26.840]  artificial phobias for normal death that takes place they're not even promising to have a
[28:26.840 --> 28:32.500]  cure to it all they're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary
[28:32.500 --> 28:40.340]  regime directed by the WHO with vaccines that actually change your DNA and make you owned
[28:40.340 --> 28:50.940]  by Microsoft it's a final frontier it's the year 2020 it's not coming it's here and submission
[28:50.940 --> 28:59.660]  is blood in the water when the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago they
[28:59.660 --> 29:05.180]  knew he had serious cognitive problems he has always been an empty suit that does what
[29:05.180 --> 29:10.820]  he's told by the globalist and their ally crime syndicates Kamala Harris is even worse
[29:10.820 --> 29:15.860]  than does whatever she's told she's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley the chai comms
[29:15.860 --> 29:22.860]  and others so she has been chosen because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes
[29:22.860 --> 29:29.260]  her will be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach ladies and gentlemen
[29:29.260 --> 29:35.020]  we must expose this monster for who she is we must expose the fact that she wanted minimum
[29:35.020 --> 29:41.220]  sentences for black people three times longer than white people that the woman is a monster
[29:41.220 --> 29:46.260]  Kamala Harris and will end up being our president if they're able to steal the election and
[29:46.260 --> 29:52.820]  she is a 110 percent new world order puppet now more than ever we must expose this monster
[29:52.820 --> 30:20.340]  we must expose the globalist you're listening to the alex jones show all right folks we
[30:20.340 --> 30:27.180]  are live broadcasting worldwide if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[30:27.180 --> 30:36.700]  live from the info wars comm studios it's alex jones okay so milley weaver and her husband
[30:36.700 --> 30:52.900]  gabin had been working with people affiliated with folks in the white house q you name it
[30:52.900 --> 30:58.860]  and they interviewed former military officers and other whistleblowers including nsa whistleblowers
[30:58.860 --> 31:08.740]  that are very well known individuals and they were making this independent film titled shadow
[31:08.740 --> 31:12.380]  gate and we'll pull the trailer up in a minute and play it for you I do this just happened
[31:12.380 --> 31:19.900]  during the short break they were scheduled to come on yesterday but milley said they
[31:19.900 --> 31:24.340]  were getting followed people were breaking on their phones stuff was getting taken off
[31:24.340 --> 31:34.820]  their computers well they just got swapped teams so the trailer is up on band on video
[31:34.820 --> 31:40.500]  and shadow gate is how brennan and clapper and hillary and obama are still in control
[31:40.500 --> 31:49.260]  of this giant network of cia nsa information warfare systems that they use in foreign wars
[31:49.260 --> 31:55.980]  and foreign countries to brainwash the public if you remember obama eight years ago the headline
[31:55.980 --> 32:01.100]  in washington post and other publications was obama legalizes using propaganda on americans
[32:01.100 --> 32:06.700]  and before obama left he signed several billion dollars into the countering misinformation
[32:06.700 --> 32:12.140]  and foreign disinformation act zero heads wrote about it we wrote about it and then
[32:12.140 --> 32:16.700]  they started saying I was a russian agent on the news and I mean you saw the rest of
[32:16.700 --> 32:22.500]  it was history so this is embedded group that tried to have the coup against trump that built
[32:22.500 --> 32:27.700]  back doors as the former technical head of nsa william benny exposed to the white house
[32:27.700 --> 32:32.460]  and to the head of the nsa who went and briefed trump once he was president elect that they
[32:32.460 --> 32:36.940]  have all these back doors to still basically be in the nsa well trumps taken the security
[32:36.940 --> 32:41.180]  clearances away from brennan and clapper and others so they can't legally do it but they're
[32:41.180 --> 32:51.460]  still doing it so millie and tory moran's who again has said she can't tell you where
[32:51.460 --> 32:56.420]  all this is where hillary's emails are where all this is or she'll get arrested well they're
[32:56.420 --> 33:00.380]  trying to arrest her right now so that's what I explained to listeners folks this isn't a
[33:00.380 --> 33:04.420]  game up here okay we're not up or telling you that we got this or we got that and we
[33:04.420 --> 33:10.620]  don't um I warned millie and her and her husband gabin who I like but they're they're contractors
[33:10.620 --> 33:15.180]  they do their own thing their own shows they contribute here I told them I said this is
[33:15.180 --> 33:20.260]  extremely dangerous and and I said I don't want to see any of these documents I already
[33:20.260 --> 33:25.580]  know all this it's already came out in the vault seven dumps and we already know from
[33:25.580 --> 33:36.540]  stoten and I'm not touching this stuff and I think they're heroes like juliena sands
[33:36.540 --> 33:48.620]  are like many others that have blown the whistle but trump needs to immediately um have the
[33:48.620 --> 33:51.820]  have the just department talk to millie weaver and the and these other folks because these
[33:51.820 --> 33:57.460]  are real people I mean they interviewed former high level nsa people and because of the way
[33:57.460 --> 34:01.980]  things are going I guess these folks told them some big secrets folks some big secrets
[34:01.980 --> 34:07.500]  and I'm like I was it arms linked on this because I know how dangerous it is I said millie
[34:07.500 --> 34:11.140]  I mean believe me they they got general flin son to come to our event DC and they had a
[34:11.140 --> 34:16.140]  bunch of defense intelligence people there I mean this is not this is a serious war inside
[34:16.140 --> 34:19.620]  the government and so they thought it's the right thing to do I think it's the right thing
[34:19.620 --> 34:27.660]  to do but it's extremely dangerous so this is how the media is controlled and the and
[34:27.660 --> 34:32.260]  the levers of control are still in the deep state's hands that's why I've gotten mad at
[34:32.260 --> 34:35.980]  Pompeo and said you need to get control of this or you're part of it and he's been getting
[34:35.980 --> 34:40.180]  control of it and he admits we're at war with China and I like Pompeo overall now I think
[34:40.180 --> 34:46.220]  he's been making the right moves they know a lot of stuff we don't know but millie weaver
[34:46.220 --> 34:51.500]  during her live stream just got slot teamed and it's sealed national security won't even
[34:51.500 --> 34:56.420]  say what we're going to get the folks that are at another location on they may get rated
[34:56.420 --> 35:05.100]  any minute and so let's go it okay so let's go ahead and play the clip we have of millie
[35:05.100 --> 35:08.260]  we believe because there's some cussing when the feds came in this just happened about
[35:08.260 --> 35:18.300]  30 minutes ago here it is break you're saying a grand jury and I didn't need for what we're
[35:18.300 --> 35:26.900]  going to have 221's out here we have room to transport one can you send us a car please
[35:26.900 --> 35:29.780]  I will give you all your paperwork when we get to the jail right now I need you to get
[35:29.780 --> 35:43.300]  some shoes okay we need to get over okay guys I don't know what's happening right now the
[35:43.300 --> 35:48.220]  police have just showed up in my house and they said that they're arresting me they said
[35:48.220 --> 35:52.460]  that a grand died jury and I didn't need for something I have no idea what this is the
[35:52.460 --> 35:58.900]  democrats folks this is crazy where's my shoe I have one shoe here I was told there was
[35:58.900 --> 36:01.540]  a SWAT team there they must have been outside at least they didn't do the no-knock warrant
[36:01.540 --> 36:09.260]  so we're good so why why wasn't I given anything in the mail like I have no idea what this
[36:09.260 --> 36:18.140]  is talking about so millie's just a journalist yeah millie just like the Pentagon I don't
[36:18.140 --> 36:22.620]  have anything on paper dangles bird she's not protecting me right now and I'm being
[36:22.620 --> 36:33.580]  the democrats no idea what this case burglary yeah for what they're not even saying they're
[36:33.580 --> 36:38.540]  saying we're being charged okay with no this is this from the grand jury or these grand
[36:38.540 --> 36:47.980]  jury are these green sheets are they great is this an indictment okay very good okay this
[36:47.980 --> 36:53.700]  is my son right now all right buddy let's go to the car I've been more than nice to
[36:53.700 --> 37:00.420]  the car I don't understand what's happening right now all right so they're they're saying
[37:00.420 --> 37:06.180]  they have stolen government documents and it's reportedly Hillary's emails all of it
[37:06.180 --> 37:12.500]  so nobody has the courage to put this stuff out and the just department's all scared of
[37:12.500 --> 37:16.500]  the other criminal side because the criminals will kill you and then they use normal feds
[37:16.500 --> 37:21.860]  and police to go out and do their dirty work and it's disgusting so I was told there was
[37:21.860 --> 37:24.660]  a SWAT team there as well but stuff is lost translation I'm glad it wasn't a no-knock
[37:24.660 --> 37:29.100]  warrant like with you and with Roger and 25 SWAT team people and helicopters and boats
[37:29.100 --> 37:34.580]  but but that's what's going on here we'll just call her we're not gonna get into her
[37:34.580 --> 37:39.220]  last name she's been on the show before Tori you were on the live stream your live streaming
[37:39.220 --> 37:43.860]  now and all this began to happen I know that you guys were finished the film now finally
[37:43.860 --> 37:51.980]  today I was told that is a shadow gate and obviously that's probably why this happened
[37:51.980 --> 37:56.580]  thanks for joining us I know this is a hectic situation tell us tell us why you think this
[37:56.580 --> 38:02.500]  is unfolding well you know what's interesting is is that we were having problems well from
[38:02.500 --> 38:07.540]  what I gather Millie was having problems parsing the video together and her internet connection
[38:07.540 --> 38:13.620]  was extremely slow and so it was very difficult for her to even put it together everything's
[38:13.620 --> 38:17.100]  under surveillance so so so you guys are about to release this what do you think is going
[38:17.100 --> 38:24.340]  on well you know they know that we don't have possession of Hillary's emails so this is
[38:24.340 --> 38:30.580]  just them trying to get information I mean burglary come on Alex what's why wouldn't
[38:30.580 --> 38:37.140]  Millie commit burglary this is insane this is a facade this is insane they just came
[38:37.140 --> 38:41.900]  to her house knocked what grand jury who brought that out to be clear you guys know where the
[38:41.900 --> 38:47.260]  emails are you're exposing the holes that Brennan and clapper left in there well yeah
[38:47.260 --> 38:53.820]  and how the the whole dossier is to cover up their real crimes the dossier was a two
[38:53.820 --> 38:59.140]  prong thing it was a weapon to use against Trump if she won so they can round up every
[38:59.140 --> 39:03.620]  single patriot and it was insurance to make sure if he did get elected that they would
[39:03.620 --> 39:08.860]  take him down and as an asset the dossier was completely fabricated to hide and you're
[39:08.860 --> 39:12.580]  a lady that's exposed the Kentucky election fraud major big national stories you've been
[39:12.580 --> 39:15.580]  on the inside you only want to say your last name at this point but you've been on before
[39:15.580 --> 39:19.140]  I know you are we're going to go to break continue with your stream and when we come
[39:19.140 --> 39:25.180]  back to talk about is the film I was told it was finally ready today is the film obviously
[39:25.180 --> 39:29.180]  this is about shadowgate what what are they so scared of in shadowgate well folks it's
[39:29.180 --> 39:35.580]  on record Obama and Brennan and clapper still run the propaganda engines inside the CIA
[39:35.580 --> 39:39.620]  and NSA that allow them to have control of the media that's how they put out the talking
[39:39.620 --> 39:46.020]  points and I've been begging Trump to shut this down and this film would expose it we'll
[39:46.020 --> 39:51.180]  be right back ladies and gentlemen with this insider Tori stay with us I'm Alex Jones want
[39:51.180 --> 40:00.020]  to tell people tune in right now how do you contest an election in the year 2020 well you
[40:00.020 --> 40:05.420]  trigger race riots and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're the speaker of
[40:05.420 --> 40:11.060]  the house that you are legitimately now the president that's what she said on CBS news

[41:46.660 --> 41:50.700]  to stock up but whatever you do keep spreading the word about info wars because you are the
[41:50.700 --> 41:56.900]  modern voice you are Paul Revere and I salute you and thank you the new world order is a
[41:56.900 --> 42:03.540]  planetary corporate plan for world government but world government is only the control
[42:03.540 --> 42:09.860]  grid now inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become
[42:09.860 --> 42:16.180]  gods and attain immortality but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[42:16.180 --> 42:22.140]  of all carbon based line forms that's why they say carbon is bad they are rewriting
[42:22.140 --> 42:28.220]  the entire genetic code of the planet they are playing God they believe they have been
[42:28.220 --> 42:34.340]  inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry
[42:34.340 --> 42:39.660]  out this transformation I know this sounds insane but if you read the writings of the
[42:39.660 --> 42:47.340]  globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have been given the information
[42:47.340 --> 42:53.700]  to say no to this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it this is the
[42:53.700 --> 43:00.060]  alien takeover of earth this is a maximum alert a maximum alert as of taking this alert
[43:00.060 --> 43:05.660]  you're 82 days out from the election as many of you know in the last year I pointed out
[43:05.660 --> 43:09.740]  statements out of the council on foreign relations and other globalist organs that they know
[43:09.740 --> 43:16.020]  Trump is going to win in a landslide so their strategy will be to contest the election if
[43:16.020 --> 43:20.900]  they fail to successfully steal it then they are openly now wargaming this is in the New
[43:20.900 --> 43:26.620]  York Times having democrat states and cities secede from the union just like they've ignored
[43:26.620 --> 43:31.100]  Trump's policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down that is nothing but
[43:31.100 --> 43:35.580]  a dress rehearsal they are saying they are going to have their own separate inauguration
[43:35.580 --> 43:42.340]  not in DC they said in another city Colossia said this when they crowned Biden and Kamala
[43:42.340 --> 43:49.260]  Harris ladies and gentlemen this is the organized civil war this is their public criminal plan
[43:49.260 --> 43:52.820]  we should be praying we should be spreading the word we should be demanding Trump won
[43:52.820 --> 44:16.340]  the office to expose this criminal activity you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:16.340 --> 44:21.700]  I come to you with very serious news Alex Jones here back live for a year Millie Weaver
[44:21.700 --> 44:28.760]  and her husband Gavin Wentz have been working on this shadow net story and a film shadow
[44:28.760 --> 44:34.020]  gate and shadow net is one of the tools you know about from Stone and others that operation
[44:34.020 --> 44:39.060]  mockingbird 2.0 where the CIA and the deep state the state department can program every
[44:39.060 --> 44:46.260]  major TV radio station newspaper I mean it's hiding in plain view and you can type in
[44:46.260 --> 44:51.780]  and pull up the old articles from four years ago Obama created ministry of truth countering
[44:51.780 --> 44:58.420]  foreign disinformation propaganda act 2017 we signed it in December of 2016 right before
[44:58.420 --> 45:02.100]  he left but it was funding for the next year a lot of that funding ran out about a year
[45:02.100 --> 45:07.500]  ago but they're still in control of so they can go in and type in whatever story they
[45:07.500 --> 45:13.660]  want that will be picked up by the editors who will then have their reporters rewrite
[45:13.660 --> 45:17.540]  under national security and not most reporters newspapers don't even know about this but
[45:17.540 --> 45:21.940]  you're a big newspaper let's say with 300 people working in it five of them are really
[45:21.940 --> 45:27.380]  working for the CIA okay and of course I've been approached by all that and even if you
[45:27.380 --> 45:31.900]  say no to it it's just like it just comes around you there's you know the more prominent
[45:31.900 --> 45:37.180]  you are there's factions and it's all cloak and dagger info wars is truly independent
[45:37.180 --> 45:41.020]  and it's never been part of any of this but it doesn't matter to certain point you know
[45:41.020 --> 45:46.860]  I get stuff from the most wild stuff you can imagine there's a real war in the government
[45:46.860 --> 45:53.340]  and it's coming to a head right now and they talked to major major whistleblowers and the
[45:53.340 --> 45:58.100]  film is going to come out today they wanted to get it out yesterday they were behind and
[45:58.100 --> 46:01.380]  I told them take their time you know because I thought you know they needed to vet it and
[46:01.380 --> 46:06.420]  everything and boom she just got arrested along with her husband at their house in Ohio
[46:06.420 --> 46:11.300]  so this is a big deal so Tori you've got the floor here for the next few segments I really
[46:11.300 --> 46:14.980]  appreciate you you were working some with them and co-hosting with her a lot you've
[46:14.980 --> 46:18.100]  been a guest many times where I even say your last name today people can figure out who
[46:18.100 --> 46:24.380]  you are but give us the gestalt the boil down of what's currently happening and how big
[46:24.380 --> 46:29.020]  this film is and them you know them you know them calling it theft well then Daniel Ellsberg
[46:29.020 --> 46:33.900]  didn't go to prison since when do whistleblowers and journalists that expose corruption and
[46:33.900 --> 46:39.060]  expose Obama still spying on Trump and and and Obama that's who really runs it still
[46:39.060 --> 46:43.860]  in control of these propaganda arms that should be dismantled much less not in a president
[46:43.860 --> 46:47.700]  out of powers control that's what all of this is about is the illegal spy on the American
[46:47.700 --> 46:53.900]  people and the monitoring us and brainwashing us so it's a multi-headed hydra here lay it
[46:53.900 --> 47:01.220]  out for us so when have you ever seen a grand jury come back with burglary let's be honest
[47:01.220 --> 47:10.700]  you know Millie very well what what kind of burglary warrants a grand jury well they're
[47:10.700 --> 47:16.580]  saying it's like it's like the saying that burglary with the plumbers and Nixon they're
[47:16.580 --> 47:22.380]  saying you they're saying she has stolen files well I don't know what they're saying they're
[47:22.380 --> 47:28.220]  not saying anything that's the problem and right now while I'm talking to you I'm trying
[47:28.220 --> 47:33.140]  to make sure that I can send someone there we need to send her an attorney we need to
[47:33.140 --> 47:38.700]  make sure she's covered they're coming in for more people now apparently to extend it
[47:38.700 --> 47:46.100]  so this is a problem but tell folks where she is specifically the town who picked and
[47:46.100 --> 47:49.820]  then let's talk about what's in the film that's got because obviously it has to do with the
[47:49.820 --> 47:57.060]  film to be released with with the whole shadowgate situation what what in the film because I know
[47:57.060 --> 48:02.060]  you guys interviewed you were involved in it some some big NSA whistleblowers well okay
[48:02.060 --> 48:07.100]  so this film pretty much lays it out and lets people see things for the way they are for
[48:07.100 --> 48:13.840]  how it actually is and what is really going on you know I think the the former contractor
[48:13.840 --> 48:20.540]  that actually created shadow net is in your is in your neighborhood I think he's there
[48:20.540 --> 48:26.500]  it's crazy oh my gosh I don't I'm I'm lost for words because there's nothing that they
[48:26.500 --> 48:31.980]  can explain this who is the US attorney that did this I want their name I want to see what
[48:31.980 --> 48:36.860]  they've been doing and who did this well under what pretends who put that in there under
[48:36.860 --> 48:43.620]  grand jury are we kidding who's the US attorney that's what we need to look at who this US
[48:43.620 --> 48:48.540]  attorney is who their name who did it because you know they're coming from illy because
[48:48.540 --> 48:54.820]  she's got the goods she broke it on the on the on the organized cities on what is it
[48:54.820 --> 49:00.220]  called I can't even find my words Alex I'm so flustered right now because it was unexpected
[49:00.220 --> 49:06.020]  and we knew that their internet connection was being throttled and it barely came through
[49:06.020 --> 49:14.740]  on my end using a drop link so the movie hasn't even been uploaded by Millie yet it's a good
[49:14.740 --> 49:19.660]  thing I seated it myself I mean I don't know what to say well I don't know what again they
[49:19.660 --> 49:24.820]  don't want this out they want to make her and others Julian Assange 2.0 you know the
[49:24.820 --> 49:30.340]  trailers been out for months you're covering something that's a known project you're just
[49:30.340 --> 49:35.100]  showing that Brennan and Clapper and Obama and Hillary are still in control of it you
[49:35.100 --> 49:40.780]  did you guys deserve medals here so I think they've really of course they can also try
[49:40.780 --> 49:43.260]  to set you guys up with something else there's no telling what they're gonna pull what do
[49:43.260 --> 49:47.460]  you think's gonna happen next well let me tell you something Alex with this system they
[49:47.460 --> 49:52.940]  manufacture evidence you know how Klein Smith pled guilty today right that's just the cherry
[49:52.940 --> 49:57.860]  on top they can retroactively manufacture things to just paint whatever picture they
[49:57.860 --> 50:03.060]  want of you that's how powerful they are it's not only that they guide what you can see
[50:03.060 --> 50:07.820]  what information you have access to but you know if I have access to it Alex I could change
[50:07.820 --> 50:11.780]  your record I can put some stuff in there from 10 years ago 20 years ago they already
[50:11.780 --> 50:17.900]  planted child porn right after they sued me they already planted child porn and then got
[50:17.900 --> 50:21.860]  it had it hidden and then said we sent them child porn I mean that's how heavy these people
[50:21.860 --> 50:27.580]  are yeah they'll plant anything just for their narrative but I'm shocked I am shocked they
[50:27.580 --> 50:32.340]  came after her when they knew she was releasing it today Alex they knew that she was uploading
[50:32.340 --> 50:39.100]  it Alex and they came today not yesterday today well I know that she was really flustered
[50:39.100 --> 50:43.300]  trying to get it out I told her relax about it and I asked her what was in it and basically
[50:43.300 --> 50:47.580]  she just basically said the same thing you laid out here I think they really miscalculated
[50:47.580 --> 50:51.180]  doing this but again the local grand jury doesn't know they're being told like you said by some
[50:51.180 --> 50:57.100]  assistant US attorney whatever made up crap that that they've been shoveled and that's
[50:57.100 --> 51:03.980]  a thing how do we see the facts how do they come in you know and listeners this and I
[51:03.980 --> 51:08.380]  see this stuff online oh Jones being dramatic let's take our grand jury's out on me I'm
[51:08.380 --> 51:13.100]  not gonna get into it but this is what's going on this is America okay we're in a civil war
[51:13.100 --> 51:18.820]  people they officially in the city council budget want to blow up the police station
[51:18.820 --> 51:23.580]  okay this is a communist takeover and people keep thinking oh we'll beat them oh there they're
[51:23.580 --> 51:28.500]  not that powerful BS folks because we lay down but you and Millie haven't laid down and so
[51:28.500 --> 51:33.540]  now I guess you expect them to try to come arrest you now yeah I would think they'd come
[51:33.540 --> 51:37.220]  for Berge first for me it's a little bit more difficult because they're they're kind of concerned
[51:37.220 --> 51:43.020]  of what insurance I might have so you know they they they'll come for anyone Alex they
[51:43.020 --> 51:48.500]  might come for you too do you have the link to it you know who knows who knows what they're
[51:48.500 --> 51:53.140]  gonna come for that's that's the way it is they can do whatever they want and this is
[51:53.140 --> 51:57.660]  on they need to know this is a Trump administration and stuff like this doesn't fly because this
[51:57.660 --> 52:01.660]  will listen I've talked to high-level Trump people and I try to explain to the president
[52:01.660 --> 52:05.940]  and he's like yes I know they've got people still inside I go no they've got backdoors
[52:05.940 --> 52:10.380]  talked to William Benny well he did then make Benny after asked him to and I'm not trying
[52:10.380 --> 52:14.020]  to brag here I'm just make these common sense connections the former technical head of the
[52:14.020 --> 52:19.700]  NSA and so Trump's tried to get here's the problem they built it as you know where it's
[52:19.700 --> 52:23.860]  always got holes you have to scrap the whole system even if they know there's holes they
[52:23.860 --> 52:28.860]  can't get rid of it so it's designed so all these bureaucrats what 800,000 of them that
[52:28.860 --> 52:33.900]  are out of office now can still go in can you imagine that they can go into your laptop
[52:33.900 --> 52:39.020]  they can turn on your iPhone they can watch you they can plant stuff it's unbelievable
[52:39.020 --> 52:42.980]  and then they got relationships with big tech to get into all your private stuff there and
[52:42.980 --> 52:47.060]  that's what you guys were exposing correct yes and you know people need to understand
[52:47.060 --> 52:51.100]  that people like Patrick Berge and myself aren't afforded whistleblower protections
[52:51.100 --> 52:55.780]  because we are contractors we're not afforded and I remember when I saw Patrick Berge file
[52:55.780 --> 53:00.620]  his complaint to the IG I was thinking oh poor guy he thinks he's protected they do that
[53:00.620 --> 53:05.340]  on purpose they do all their dirty work with contractors constantly again and again and
[53:05.340 --> 53:09.980]  by the way he was in town wanting to come here and get on the show yesterday and I just
[53:09.980 --> 53:14.380]  I was waiting for Millie you know to tell me to pull the trigger so a lot of crazy stuff
[53:14.380 --> 53:19.980]  going on wow so so do we know where she's being held I know the paperwork supposedly
[53:19.980 --> 53:23.980]  said nothing well right now I'm gonna take care of her children because I'm a mother
[53:23.980 --> 53:27.540]  too so I'm gonna take care of her children and then focus on getting her an attorney
[53:27.540 --> 53:32.940]  out there so that way that's taken care of I'm really I mean they're smart so they know
[53:32.940 --> 53:40.140]  not to talk so it's it's a pretty big deal and well you know I'll keep you informed I'll
[53:40.140 --> 53:44.060]  text you guys and tell you what's going on yeah this is a woman a mother a filmmaker
[53:44.060 --> 53:47.380]  with a good record everybody knows Millie weaver Millenia Millie she's been doing reports
[53:47.380 --> 53:52.340]  for us a contractor eight years and and and now they've been arrested in front of her
[53:52.340 --> 53:56.020]  children for trying to expose Brennan and Clapper and their criminal activity she's
[53:56.020 --> 54:01.300]  unbelievable it is and you know that's the thing when you give real news they don't
[54:01.300 --> 54:06.500]  want it all the mainstream media is corrupt they're funded by interest people like you
[54:06.500 --> 54:12.540]  and Millie myself all funded by the people not by any interests and they hate that because
[54:12.540 --> 54:16.540]  that's where the truth comes out and this is the problem she's not controlled by anyone
[54:16.540 --> 54:21.020]  except for her moral compass this is why they came after Roger Stone too because he's a good
[54:21.020 --> 54:26.660]  guy he follows a moral compass he's loyal good people are always attacked and you know this
[54:26.660 --> 54:31.940]  was very surprising to see very surprising to see you know if anything I would have assumed
[54:31.940 --> 54:36.580]  that they'd you know try to bash the door down on Brigid but the timing is just incredible
[54:36.580 --> 54:42.660]  Alex she was ceding the file they were ceding the file it's crazy absolutely stay there
[54:42.660 --> 54:48.980]  well they they waited till she did that to charge her Nancy Pelosi Eric Holder Joe Biden
[54:48.980 --> 54:54.020]  Hillary Clinton and the list goes on from there have all gone on national TV have all
[54:54.020 --> 54:58.260]  gone on the internet and have been in the pages of the New York Times that their war
[54:58.260 --> 55:03.460]  came in contesting the election when they lose they know there's a landslide if they're
[55:03.460 --> 55:09.380]  unable to steal it they're planning to contest it and have Democrat blue states secede and
[55:09.380 --> 55:14.340]  hold their own treasonous inauguration for Joe Biden and the other public Kamala Harris
[55:14.340 --> 55:19.900]  this has now been announced and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover to
[55:19.900 --> 55:25.380]  try to drive Trump from office the Democratic Party the chai comms the deep state are using
[55:25.380 --> 55:31.300]  black lives matter funded by Soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their attempts
[55:31.300 --> 55:37.020]  at creating artificial riots and martial law that you're racist when in truth an old Nazi
[55:37.020 --> 55:42.300]  collaborator George Soros created black lives matter along with Antifa America's fighting
[55:42.300 --> 55:51.260]  for its life but we will win you can really break civilizations down to two types predatory
[55:51.260 --> 55:57.540]  and non predatory or oppressive conquest based or Renaissance based and of course different
[55:57.540 --> 56:03.500]  types of civilizations and countries and political systems of history and the present are mixes
[56:03.500 --> 56:12.940]  of the two but with globalism it is a post human ideology so it's scientifically geared
[56:12.940 --> 56:19.220]  to be oppressive and the rationale is social Darwinism that the ruling class are elites
[56:19.220 --> 56:24.580]  and because they're in power they have a right to rule over you poison you dumb you down
[56:24.580 --> 56:29.980]  sterilize you and kill you so all the people wearing masks like outside at the park and
[56:29.980 --> 56:35.620]  stuff are living in a total hoax and think their act of submission is an act of working
[56:35.620 --> 56:40.460]  for the common good in a collective no it's a sign that you're a slave we'll take the
[56:40.460 --> 56:44.980]  force inoculations federal government Yale are studying the force inoculations right
[56:44.980 --> 57:06.260]  now you're listening to the Alex Jones show we are back we are talking to a lady who is
[57:06.260 --> 57:10.460]  really a whistleblower and been on the inside and been working with only we were on a lot
[57:10.460 --> 57:16.020]  of big election fraud stories you name it so Tori what else should people know about
[57:16.020 --> 57:21.420]  her getting arrested earlier today what they're saying is happening a grand jury writer she
[57:21.420 --> 57:26.740]  was uploading the film shadow gate and what can you tell us is in the film shadow gate
[57:26.740 --> 57:32.740]  because I've only seen the trailer I haven't seen it so there's a lot in there and I will
[57:32.740 --> 57:38.900]  send you the seed file if you like Alex I'll email it to you so you can download it it pretty
[57:38.900 --> 57:43.820]  much has public available information so she didn't use any information other than the
[57:43.820 --> 57:52.420]  words of the creator of shadow net and myself and using publicly sourced documents to demonstrate
[57:52.420 --> 57:58.340]  what is being said and how it's being done so that is what's there but it lays it out
[57:58.340 --> 58:06.300]  so easily that there is no shadow of doubt in anybody's mind that the Russia hoax was
[58:06.300 --> 58:12.700]  one of the biggest hoaxes ever and they keep hoaxing people from the right and the left
[58:12.700 --> 58:17.620]  the right and the left are being hoax constantly from both sides I mean they have to have you
[58:17.620 --> 58:21.460]  know their buffers they control every single narrative Alex either it's coming from the
[58:21.460 --> 58:28.020]  right the left they control everything there is not one thing they do not control not one
[58:28.020 --> 58:31.980]  so if you see people talking and they're saying great things that's because they were allowed
[58:31.980 --> 58:37.220]  to say great things if you see people saying bad things that's because they were told to
[58:37.220 --> 58:41.540]  for a 4am 3am whatever you want to call the job about a mainstream media there's lots
[58:41.540 --> 58:48.220]  of independent real media that's why they're so upset exactly and there are 4am 3am drops
[58:48.220 --> 58:53.620]  for both sides of the fence you know and I watch both of them too so they're that dumb
[58:53.620 --> 58:59.620]  and the thing is people have grown to trust some of this media that has you know risen
[58:59.620 --> 59:07.740]  up throughout all of this and they're nothing but another you know you know internet activity
[59:07.740 --> 59:13.020]  activity oh my gosh I'm so flustered we got taken care of our kids now I need to send
[59:13.020 --> 59:18.340]  her a lawyer this is ridiculous and I'm hoping that you'll have Patrick Berge on there and
[59:18.340 --> 59:25.740]  I can send you the whole video it's about an hour and 30 minutes it is the most incredible
[59:25.740 --> 59:29.860]  thing you'll see because then everything makes sense suddenly everything is going to make
[59:29.860 --> 59:34.940]  sense to you on how all these operations were carried out how they were able to get away
[59:34.940 --> 59:40.460]  with these things that's the thing because everybody's been duped and we let them we
[59:40.460 --> 59:47.660]  let them we elected them we we voluntarily gave them permission to be our news nobody
[59:47.660 --> 59:53.660]  did anything the interactive internet activities that you see are nothing their psyops on both
[59:53.660 --> 59:58.500]  sides of the fence they're hijacking everyone and people are going to start to see how this
[59:58.500 --> 1:00:02.940]  has happened and right now all this talk of Russia dossier makes me sick to my stomach
[1:00:02.940 --> 1:00:06.740]  because they all know that the Russia dossier was simply a cover up for the real crimes
[1:00:06.740 --> 1:00:12.180]  which was the over collection of the 702s remember Alex the judge the FISA judge assigned
[1:00:12.180 --> 1:00:17.660]  the Carter period warrant right three weeks before she signed it she was spanking them
[1:00:17.660 --> 1:00:25.820]  and John Carlin for over collection from the NSA right sure he was just covering her butt
[1:00:25.820 --> 1:00:30.020]  yeah but she she told them that they're not allowed to spy on them and then three weeks
[1:00:30.020 --> 1:00:33.500]  later signs of FISA warrant knowing that it was based on the stuff she told them they're
[1:00:33.500 --> 1:00:37.260]  not supposed to do I know and that's why they then use the inspector general of the courts
[1:00:37.260 --> 1:00:41.060]  to come out and say it was all illegal and it was William Vinnie called us and pointed
[1:00:41.060 --> 1:00:45.860]  out that that so-called debt Nunez memo that didn't come out for a year later was already
[1:00:45.860 --> 1:00:51.340]  out and it was actually the court saying that that's why oh Nunez says it's in the news today
[1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:57.300]  oh Obama knew they were spying on Trump he ordered it Brennan and Clapper have gone
[1:00:57.300 --> 1:01:04.740]  on TV and said that Alex I heard them I heard them I had access to Brennan's back end server
[1:01:04.740 --> 1:01:10.780]  for forever in a day I listened to every single conversation I listened to them plot the Ukraine
[1:01:10.780 --> 1:01:15.540]  at the Munich conference with Biden in 2019 I was listening no I know I know we've had
[1:01:15.540 --> 1:01:18.900]  John before I know you're for real so when we come back spill your guts that's what they
[1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:22.940]  don't want tell people what you heard Brennan do the White House is going to hear this and
[1:01:22.940 --> 1:01:27.100]  Trump needs to take control of this damn thing right now you want to win the election don't
[1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:33.100]  use it for propaganda shut it off shut it off shut it off shut it off the only way to stop
[1:01:33.100 --> 1:01:38.140]  it shut it off just got back doors all over it the only way you get rid of it is burning
[1:01:38.140 --> 1:01:42.620]  it down I don't mean that literally burn it down delete the program well they're right
[1:01:42.620 --> 1:01:57.100]  back in 60 seconds stay with us the United Nations and the National Institutes of Health
[1:01:57.100 --> 1:02:03.820]  with the CDC are publicly conducting a 4,000 person study spending tens of millions of
[1:02:03.820 --> 1:02:10.380]  dollars at Yale on 15 ways to brainwash the public into taking inoculations basically
[1:02:10.380 --> 1:02:15.180]  squeezing you and forcing you to take them through guilt through fines they're not being
[1:02:15.180 --> 1:02:21.220]  able to go into stores not be able to get on airplanes or have jobs this is forced inoculations
[1:02:21.220 --> 1:02:25.460]  it's public Gateway Punnett wrote about it last week David Knight wrote about it this
[1:02:25.460 --> 1:02:31.420]  week stories up on info wars.com so people say oh I'll just wear a mask it's never going
[1:02:31.420 --> 1:02:37.420]  to end that's just the sign of submission Fauci admits that next is the contact tracing
[1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:44.300]  of the apps on your phones and the inoculations that is a DNA vaccine that changes your DNA
[1:02:44.300 --> 1:02:50.340]  this isn't a science fiction movie it's happening right now compliance is death compliance is
[1:02:50.340 --> 1:03:16.660]  annihilation wake up wake up
[1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:45.740]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I want to roll that trailer here for the film shadowgate
[1:03:45.740 --> 1:03:54.540]  and shadowgate is the gate of all gates it's the gate of the private NSA corporations big
[1:03:54.540 --> 1:04:01.700]  tech with a seamless global AI grid spying on everyone but also manipulating everyone
[1:04:01.700 --> 1:04:07.300]  and deciding what information to promote and what information not to promote and I know
[1:04:07.300 --> 1:04:13.180]  who Tori is I know that she's exposed incredible election fraud and the 80 something thousand
[1:04:13.180 --> 1:04:18.460]  and they found even more in Kentucky of people that never lived in Kentucky or Republicans
[1:04:18.460 --> 1:04:23.180]  on the Democrat voting rolls and then they voted in their names she's a great lady done
[1:04:23.180 --> 1:04:28.140]  a great job and you know when I saw in the last few years to Millie Weaver and her husband
[1:04:28.140 --> 1:04:32.460]  were working with and some of the people I was like look you're you're in really deep
[1:04:32.460 --> 1:04:37.820]  in cloak and dagger stuff and I said I personally have decided not to be involved in this and
[1:04:37.820 --> 1:04:41.780]  to just analyze news and cover it and to not get around this because I mean it was you
[1:04:41.780 --> 1:04:46.620]  know I mean it was you know I mean we had an event in DC and it was crawling with the
[1:04:46.620 --> 1:04:51.780]  not the fake spies okay I mean those real green beret officers people all over the place
[1:04:51.780 --> 1:04:58.100]  it was ridiculous okay and all sorts of factions and the whole nine yards and I warned Millie
[1:04:58.100 --> 1:05:03.140]  and Millie's a hero and so is her husband but I said you guys are in over your head
[1:05:03.140 --> 1:05:09.380]  and I said you know your contractors you're doing your own deal but I just said you need
[1:05:09.380 --> 1:05:12.620]  to just give this to the White House and Millie's been to the White House and they gave them
[1:05:12.620 --> 1:05:16.580]  the stuff too and I'm not going to get into that in fact I'm not supposed to get into
[1:05:16.580 --> 1:05:22.940]  that all of that this country's fighting for its life it's all I can tell you and it's
[1:05:22.940 --> 1:05:26.100]  going to be people like Millie that saved the country and we're able to save it but
[1:05:26.100 --> 1:05:29.660]  I just look at the men of this country sitting there doing nothing I mean I talked to a lot
[1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:34.660]  of these guys I talked to guys like number three in Dinecore a few months ago he's like
[1:05:34.660 --> 1:05:37.660]  well I'm the man in the shadows and I got to be the gray man because you know the public's
[1:05:37.660 --> 1:05:40.420]  just too weak for this and I wish we could turn it around we probably can't and maybe
[1:05:40.420 --> 1:05:46.700]  he's right but with the men who've been in all this combat and all this stuff but they're
[1:05:46.700 --> 1:05:51.420]  morally scared and they go well I got a couple daughters in college they're not going to
[1:05:51.420 --> 1:05:58.660]  be any damn colleges this keeps going on I mean it gets to a point where you you don't
[1:05:58.660 --> 1:06:06.460]  do anything so long it all collapses worse than it would so we have one of the whistleblowers
[1:06:06.460 --> 1:06:15.540]  here Patrick Berge I knew Millie was saying get him on as a guest and then he's here in
[1:06:15.540 --> 1:06:22.700]  Austin so we're going to look at getting him in here I am not going to post a shadow
[1:06:22.700 --> 1:06:28.780]  gate without watching it it might be a crime in their perspectives to watch it but you
[1:06:28.780 --> 1:06:35.460]  see we're journalists so that's always been protected but now there's no respect for journalism
[1:06:35.460 --> 1:06:40.100]  censorship so cool so there you've got Julian Assange is you know been in solitary confinement
[1:06:40.100 --> 1:06:45.940]  for years and almost dead and I told Millie I said listen listen I already know all this
[1:06:45.940 --> 1:06:51.460]  stuff's real you need to be careful let's go back to Tori who's been right in the middle
[1:06:51.460 --> 1:06:56.180]  of this tell folks I mean they already know it's already in the film they're already watching
[1:06:56.180 --> 1:06:59.860]  you you've already talked about it on air before tell people what you did what you were
[1:06:59.860 --> 1:07:04.500]  doing how you were able with their own backdoors to listen to them and what they were up to
[1:07:04.500 --> 1:07:10.340]  well you know when when these private servers collecting everybody's information and compiling
[1:07:10.340 --> 1:07:16.900]  it which by the way everyone should be very alarmed because ancestry DNA was also purchased
[1:07:16.900 --> 1:07:24.260]  by the same company they're being housed over on German servers Luxembourg and Ukraine where
[1:07:24.260 --> 1:07:30.260]  they're compiling data and profiles on people to create two split personalities split person
[1:07:30.260 --> 1:07:35.300]  persona as I would say your AI persona and then your physical they control all the information
[1:07:35.300 --> 1:07:40.340]  about you from top to bottom from medical records to birth records to blood type to what you say
[1:07:40.340 --> 1:07:45.380]  online what you do online what you search everything now when this was created it was created as a
[1:07:45.380 --> 1:07:50.340]  weapon and I'm going to tell you what Alex this came from something that I that I had an idea
[1:07:50.340 --> 1:07:58.020]  about in the 90s under the Clinton administration where I wanted to put a worm on floppy drives
[1:07:58.020 --> 1:08:02.420]  right because I said that the problem that we have is that there's a lot of leaking
[1:08:02.420 --> 1:08:08.340]  from embassies so when they're copying files we need to be able to track what files they're doing
[1:08:08.340 --> 1:08:14.340]  and that's what gave birth to Stuxnet I created that I helped create that and that's what caused
[1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:20.020]  the whole meltdown years later with the Iranian nuclear plant I helped create that idea that was
[1:08:20.020 --> 1:08:26.580]  my idea to be able to remotely control through malware and this is we're talking like late 90s
[1:08:26.580 --> 1:08:32.660]  right and so they created an offshore company where they collect all the data from the NSA keep
[1:08:32.660 --> 1:08:38.100]  in mind housing it also in Ukraine and I'm telling you Hillary's emails they are in the Ukraine
[1:08:38.100 --> 1:08:43.540]  because I saw them there they're sitting on a database right now because that is where crowd
[1:08:43.540 --> 1:08:52.020]  strike did it the FBI hired crowd strike to get the images of both the RNC and the DNC server
[1:08:52.020 --> 1:08:59.140]  not to to do what to protect Hillary Clinton so they don't find any other information and they
[1:08:59.140 --> 1:09:05.060]  uploaded it they know everybody knows the president I'm sure I think he even said maybe the Ukraine
[1:09:05.060 --> 1:09:10.740]  has it because they do and this is all Brennan's work and for me I was one of the first people
[1:09:10.740 --> 1:09:15.940]  on that platform I still had a backdoor he collects information on everyone he collects
[1:09:15.940 --> 1:09:21.540]  information on every single person in the senate in congress reporters you want to hear how many
[1:09:21.540 --> 1:09:28.020]  reporters get leaks and from who I could tell you leaking linic is just the beginning all of them
[1:09:28.020 --> 1:09:33.300]  emails voicemails texts I've seen it all Alex there's nothing I haven't seen and I've been sitting
[1:09:33.300 --> 1:09:38.260]  there quietly and you know when I lost access to it after Millie Weaver dropped the report on
[1:09:38.260 --> 1:09:44.660]  global strategies group they eradicated their their database and then they revamped it because
[1:09:44.660 --> 1:09:49.780]  they still had that backdoor it's like an admin backdoor so whenever I wanted to I use my own
[1:09:49.780 --> 1:09:55.780]  username and password that I had legal access to it's not federal property it was private property
[1:09:55.780 --> 1:10:01.220]  I committed no crime by looking and all I would do is just listen and if I tell you what went on
[1:10:01.220 --> 1:10:06.900]  in the Munich conference in 2019 you know everybody's hair would fall out you'd be plucking your eyes
[1:10:06.900 --> 1:10:10.420]  out well here's the deal I think you should spill your guts because you're in danger until you do
[1:10:10.420 --> 1:10:15.060]  that I mean I I know you're a smart person but you either tell people everything you know or you
[1:10:15.060 --> 1:10:20.660]  never talk that's the way to be safe and I think you should tell people but let me guess they're
[1:10:20.660 --> 1:10:28.180]  talking about killing Trump they were actually discussing why Joe Biden had to be put up and
[1:10:28.180 --> 1:10:32.820]  how they were waiting for the elections in Ukraine and the thing is that Ukraine has the server
[1:10:32.820 --> 1:10:36.660]  that's why none of them are being knocked off and they're giving us low-hanging fruit like
[1:10:36.660 --> 1:10:41.380]  Kolominsky but you know they went to Kentucky and confiscated a building but they totally missed a
[1:10:41.380 --> 1:10:47.060]  spot with why won't Trump and why won't Trump and the Justice Department shut this down because
[1:10:47.060 --> 1:10:51.060]  they're not stupid they know all about it I've told Trump about it he knows about it why won't
[1:10:51.060 --> 1:10:56.180]  they shut down their enemies how do you how do you pull the floor out of a train with people in it
[1:10:56.180 --> 1:11:02.820]  Alex the train is still moving people it's so huge but then the deep state won't back down even though
[1:11:02.820 --> 1:11:08.260]  Trump's got him by the way votes well what we have to do is take out the bottom feeders and
[1:11:08.260 --> 1:11:13.220]  that's exactly what he's doing and people need to see it see if he comes in and starts taking
[1:11:13.220 --> 1:11:18.260]  everyone and arresting them suddenly he's a dictator they're gonna paint them as someone crazy
[1:11:18.260 --> 1:11:22.580]  and insane I got it that's why they keep saying that because they know the right move would be
[1:11:22.580 --> 1:11:26.420]  literally arrest a few thousand of these people but they'll call that a dictator well so what that's
[1:11:26.420 --> 1:11:31.940]  not a dictator they're the dictators that hijacked our damn country and I want to stop Alex you know
[1:11:31.940 --> 1:11:36.100]  that I know that your listeners know that my listeners know that but hey what about the rest
[1:11:36.100 --> 1:11:40.100]  of the world look at the global media they've got everyone in their pocket well they also know
[1:11:40.100 --> 1:11:44.420]  it's going to embarrass the entire intelligence networks good they've got too much power they're
[1:11:44.420 --> 1:11:49.940]  sold out to foreign powers they need to be cut back from size anything that big is going to be
[1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:56.020]  infiltrated and become corrupt my god that's 101 and it's like Steve Pacenek says it's time to to stop
[1:11:56.020 --> 1:12:00.740]  it because all they're all a bunch of nobodies that do nothing and so all they do is parlay their
[1:12:00.740 --> 1:12:05.540]  intelligence into corporations to screw people and it's destabilizing the planet it's not
[1:12:05.540 --> 1:12:11.700]  empowering people it's an absolute nightmare it is but they're in control they've been in control
[1:12:11.700 --> 1:12:17.780]  for decades how do you gut no no when you look at Brennan and how he see this with power trip
[1:12:17.780 --> 1:12:25.780]  he's a pathetic criminal Brennan he's stupid he's dumb as rocks too the only thing he has
[1:12:25.780 --> 1:12:31.780]  is an iron fist the way he goes he's connected well connected and if you think that this just
[1:12:31.780 --> 1:12:36.660]  stops the buck in the united states they serve other people that aren't in the united states
[1:12:36.660 --> 1:12:44.020]  oh i know that yeah they're in bed with the chinese the ccp not all of china but the ccp portion of
[1:12:44.020 --> 1:12:48.340]  it kind of trump of the military just need to take care of this right now this is ridiculous
[1:12:48.340 --> 1:12:51.220]  come let's do one more segment you're real sweet heart let's talk about milley weaver has been
[1:12:51.220 --> 1:12:56.260]  arrested stay with us attention attention attention do anyone that still wants to live
[1:12:56.260 --> 1:13:02.100]  in a free country the new world order chai kong globalist syndicate is making its move to implode
[1:13:02.100 --> 1:13:07.780]  the dollar and thrust the united states into a civil war by contesting the election they are
[1:13:07.780 --> 1:13:12.260]  openly working in this at the highest levels of democratic party nancy polosi and others have
[1:13:12.260 --> 1:13:18.180]  gone on television and said they will contest the election trump is going they will hold a separate
[1:13:18.180 --> 1:13:23.540]  inauguration for biden and kamala harris and that anyone challenging that will be called a racist
[1:13:23.540 --> 1:13:28.500]  they will then trigger race riots and violence they've already beta tested around the country
[1:13:29.140 --> 1:13:34.020]  we are not living in normal times when these type of things happen in history people are
[1:13:34.020 --> 1:13:38.580]  usually caught flat-footed because they can't believe that they're living in such a criminal
[1:13:38.580 --> 1:13:43.380]  era we are we are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate that's been
[1:13:43.380 --> 1:13:48.900]  feeding on america is being exposed and removed now is the time for all good men and women to come
[1:13:48.900 --> 1:13:54.100]  to their aid of the country spread the word now paul reveres well we're six months into the covet
[1:13:54.100 --> 1:13:59.220]  19 lockdown and now democrat leaders are calling for people to be charged for the tempted murder
[1:13:59.220 --> 1:14:03.780]  if they don't wear the mask of the symbols of slavery and they trigger their race riots around
[1:14:03.780 --> 1:14:09.300]  the country led by white angry liberal academics and others and now on top of the democrats are
[1:14:09.300 --> 1:14:14.180]  officially saying hey trump's gonna try to steal the election and contest it but then their internal
[1:14:14.180 --> 1:14:19.540]  war gaming documents come out with john tedes at the very top with kamala harris and of course
[1:14:19.540 --> 1:14:24.260]  joe biden and they're saying oh we think we're gonna lose but we're gonna have the democrat
[1:14:24.260 --> 1:14:29.620]  state secede claiming that joe biden's won the popular vote and we are then going to set up our
[1:14:29.620 --> 1:14:34.820]  own country and ask the military to remove trump this is officially in the new york times and i'll
[1:14:34.820 --> 1:14:38.900]  just believe the new york times i've been telling you for over a year this is their plan from other
[1:14:38.900 --> 1:14:43.780]  statements they've made and then blantic monthly the washington post the financial times of london
[1:14:43.780 --> 1:14:48.340]  the council and farm relations this is their plan we've got 80 days left to stop it what are you
[1:14:48.340 --> 1:14:56.740]  going to do i'm serious folks this is the time to save the country you're listening to the alex
[1:14:56.740 --> 1:15:12.660]  jones show
[1:15:15.140 --> 1:15:18.180]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host coming up next segment
[1:15:18.820 --> 1:15:23.860]  patrick murgee cyber security veteran former dod contractor who's one of the people interviewed
[1:15:23.860 --> 1:15:29.540]  in the film about what he saw with the shadow net program and how it's being used to plug in
[1:15:29.540 --> 1:15:34.820]  to the nsa of the cia and into your computers and propagandize you and control the media not
[1:15:34.820 --> 1:15:39.300]  just spy on you he's going to be in the studio he was also on the phone with millie weaver's
[1:15:39.300 --> 1:15:45.300]  husband who's uh you've got basically directing the film and uh he heard a lot of what went on
[1:15:45.300 --> 1:15:52.340]  with the feds there as well so this is brennan clapper being exposed obama being exposed beyond
[1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:55.940]  spying on the campaign or once trump was in office but how they're manipulating the media
[1:15:55.940 --> 1:15:59.780]  how they're doing all this illegal stuff and this is why no other media will cover this because
[1:15:59.780 --> 1:16:05.380]  they put you in jail they arrest you even though you deserve a public surprise uh so we'll have
[1:16:05.380 --> 1:16:12.100]  more on that as it unfolds uh torrey again major whistleblower uh in all of this other points you
[1:16:12.100 --> 1:16:18.820]  think that you should add for people well just so they understand the stuff that i have listened to
[1:16:18.820 --> 1:16:23.700]  you know where they were planning to figure out who they were going to nominate to be a whistleblower
[1:16:23.700 --> 1:16:28.820]  for this ukraine thing you know that it wasn't a whistleblower right it was clear wiretaps because
[1:16:28.820 --> 1:16:34.580]  we have uh the ig of the nsa is robert storch he's the one that's been in the ukraine he was
[1:16:34.580 --> 1:16:40.100]  offered a job in ukraine a month before he was confirmed okay this is the problem that we have
[1:16:40.100 --> 1:16:45.140]  if we have the ig of the nsa in bed with the ukrainians in bed with all of them let's just
[1:16:45.140 --> 1:16:49.540]  say they're the obama is still wiretapping the president they're listening to all of it and
[1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:53.780]  they're misrepresenting what's said and then they have someone who was around not in the room
[1:16:53.780 --> 1:16:58.260]  come say they heard it to cover up the fact they're spying on the president yeah they picked it out i
[1:16:58.260 --> 1:17:03.380]  listened to the whole conversation where ship was talking about it they were like i heard polosi say
[1:17:03.380 --> 1:17:07.940]  did we figure out who we're gonna put up as the whistleblower like i heard that it's not like
[1:17:07.940 --> 1:17:11.620]  make believe in millie actually reported it because i wrote an article about it saying the
[1:17:11.620 --> 1:17:17.220]  whistleblower is a wiretap there is no whistleblower they just picked some random dude that they knew
[1:17:17.220 --> 1:17:22.500]  they could place in certain places as the whistleblower was all fixed why is robert stork the
[1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:28.820]  ig of the nsa did you know alex that barack hussein obama during the transition period on the 30th
[1:17:28.820 --> 1:17:35.140]  of november nominated storch to be the ig of the nsa did you know that obama created that to be a
[1:17:35.140 --> 1:17:41.620]  presidentially appointed position just days after judge collier told them they're not allowed to over
[1:17:41.620 --> 1:17:47.300]  collect information on specific individuals they did all this that was a continuation of government
[1:17:47.300 --> 1:17:51.700]  and there's still a guy named nathan kroger working at the white house that was part of obama's
[1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:58.260]  transition team this is how they continue having an obama government underlying and undermining
[1:17:58.260 --> 1:18:02.580]  the president of the united states right and that's why this is the big enchilada because the obama
[1:18:02.580 --> 1:18:06.820]  government slash hillary is still in power and they've been holding on to get rid of trump to
[1:18:06.820 --> 1:18:13.060]  fully be back in power and that's why they want anybody exposing this to be arrested and it's
[1:18:13.060 --> 1:18:17.780]  just amazing if anybody doesn't know about this just type in obama set up his own ministry of
[1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:22.260]  truth before leaving office you'll get the zero edge articles the info wars articles about the
[1:18:22.260 --> 1:18:28.340]  countering foreign disinformation propaganda act that was just a law to then have it left in
[1:18:28.340 --> 1:18:34.980]  government to attack the american people by calling them russians and so that's how this wind up toy
[1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:40.260]  this automaton this robot attack just continues on but it's beyond that they've still got
[1:18:40.980 --> 1:18:46.900]  shadow net as this outside computer program with holes they left able to still communicate
[1:18:46.900 --> 1:18:51.700]  through this data collection system that's actually two-way is that the best way to describe it
[1:18:52.820 --> 1:18:58.180]  it is but when you have generals retired and still active you know leaking information when
[1:18:58.180 --> 1:19:02.980]  you have the ig of the state department talking to people at new york times and that's why i
[1:19:02.980 --> 1:19:07.140]  used to call him leaking linux you know twitter took down my twitter account because there was
[1:19:07.140 --> 1:19:11.700]  too much evidence for them there was no explanation they just took it down the minute i started
[1:19:11.700 --> 1:19:16.340]  posting evidence and this is the problem because it's all coming down now they're they've painted
[1:19:16.340 --> 1:19:21.060]  themselves in so many corners they ran out of corners and it's down now and they're going to see
[1:19:21.060 --> 1:19:25.620]  but president trump is coming down hard but for them to well i was about to say everything with
[1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:30.740]  them is hamfisted though obviously arresting milley will only make this bigger but they don't care
[1:19:30.740 --> 1:19:36.660]  it's it's they're just crazy they are they are they are and they will not ask you this i haven't
[1:19:36.660 --> 1:19:42.180]  watched the film and i haven't gotten the link yet so let me ask you is there classified information
[1:19:42.180 --> 1:19:46.900]  on this or why do you think that they arrested or i mean they wouldn't say i know you you guys
[1:19:47.460 --> 1:19:50.820]  have talked to the folks that were there there's like nothing on it just says says burglary which
[1:19:50.820 --> 1:19:55.220]  again they're gonna say like nixon breaking in with the plumbers to uh you know the the other
[1:19:55.220 --> 1:20:01.300]  candidate psychiatrist office i mean i mean i think that's where that's going there is no classified
[1:20:01.300 --> 1:20:06.900]  information on it none whatsoever and when i get off there with you i'm gonna shoot it up into the
[1:20:06.900 --> 1:20:11.220]  air so everybody can take it okay well where are people gonna find it where are they gonna find a
[1:20:11.220 --> 1:20:16.340]  shadow gate well i'm uploading it to to youtube i'm gonna put it on my twitch channel because
[1:20:16.340 --> 1:20:21.460]  you know that's owned by bezos and it has got different rules facebook d live everywhere i'm
[1:20:21.460 --> 1:20:26.340]  gonna have it everywhere i'm gonna stream it live when we get off um because people need to see it
[1:20:26.340 --> 1:20:29.940]  people need to understand and there is no classified information in there patrick will tell you that
[1:20:29.940 --> 1:20:36.180]  too everything is publicly sourced nothing was used that could even well i mean it's like when
[1:20:36.180 --> 1:20:41.060]  it's like when kwomo chris kwomo said we at cnn are allowed to read wiki leaks but if you read it
[1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:45.460]  you'll be arrested no it's it's open you're journalist you're allowed to look at stuff
[1:20:45.460 --> 1:20:49.220]  but but they're they probably arrested her and they're gonna do probably some others to make it
[1:20:49.220 --> 1:20:53.940]  look like it's illegal to have the information i mean i i think that's probably what's happening here
[1:20:54.980 --> 1:20:58.980]  it's okay they can say whatever they want the facts are the facts you know what they get a crooked
[1:20:58.980 --> 1:21:03.140]  judge that says whatever oh i'm just gonna throw you in jail because they think you did something
[1:21:03.140 --> 1:21:07.540]  even though i have no proof they can't do that what is it gonna you know the people won't stand for
[1:21:07.540 --> 1:21:11.860]  it and this is a trump administration they have to get absolutely you know we had dr nick megatosh

[1:25:58.260 --> 1:26:04.180]  been an empty suit that does what he's told by the globalist and their allied crime syndicates
[1:26:04.180 --> 1:26:09.540]  kamala harris is even worse than does whatever she's told she's bought and paid for by silicon
[1:26:09.540 --> 1:26:17.140]  valley the chai comms and others so she has been chosen because she's part african and now anyone

[1:27:30.500 --> 1:27:35.140]  about i've talked to william benning former head of technical at the nsa uh this is really serious
[1:27:35.140 --> 1:27:39.140]  and this is this is the shadow government and how they've got control and then i learned that
[1:27:39.140 --> 1:27:42.420]  mealy was talking to the white house she's been in the white house repeatedly trump in the white
[1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:47.860]  house really like her uh and again i can say oh info wars reporter arrested they do contracting
[1:27:47.860 --> 1:27:52.260]  for us i'm not distancing myself from them but they are independent media they've got their own
[1:27:52.260 --> 1:27:56.740]  stuff going on and so i just see what they produce and what they do and i sponsored them
[1:27:57.300 --> 1:28:01.780]  and support them but i mean i knew they were getting increasingly concerned and i knew that
[1:28:01.780 --> 1:28:05.540]  when they got general flin son to come to our event and the people they brought to that event
[1:28:05.540 --> 1:28:10.020]  were very serious people and i was like okay well they're like yeah there's a big war going on i already
[1:28:10.020 --> 1:28:15.220]  knew about it but um just a whole bunch of stuff inside the loop and i said but they were talking
[1:28:15.220 --> 1:28:19.700]  to both sides they were talking to brennan people that approached them and the other people the
[1:28:19.700 --> 1:28:24.820]  defense intelligence agency and i i advised them i said look i would not involve myself in that
[1:28:24.820 --> 1:28:29.860]  because it's so dirty and i said and you you're a mother and you're a father i i said i really
[1:28:29.860 --> 1:28:33.540]  we're gonna do it i said okay i respect that this is your mission you want to do it i'm not telling
[1:28:33.540 --> 1:28:39.060]  you to do it uh and and and now they've arrested her today the feds have for a burglary which you
[1:28:39.060 --> 1:28:44.660]  know uh you theft it doesn't say it's very secretive it's sealed it's obviously a national security

[1:29:24.340 --> 1:29:29.700]  psychological operations group had no idea that we were going to be taking their years worth of
[1:29:29.700 --> 1:29:35.140]  work that they paid us to do and we kept the intellectual property rights to it and uh
[1:29:36.500 --> 1:29:44.100]  remarketed it branded it commercially as a shadow it prized into your demographic your world so if i

[1:32:47.860 --> 1:32:54.100]  officers that um uh they were journalists and they were actually you know just getting they
[1:32:54.100 --> 1:32:59.700]  were working with the white house they were just getting ready to release a very damaging
[1:32:59.700 --> 1:33:06.340]  uh document and you know the officer's like oh i hope that's not true because i'm arresting yet
[1:33:06.340 --> 1:33:13.700]  you know so um he was actually nice and considerate of that but doing his job and uh but they said
[1:33:13.700 --> 1:33:23.540]  they only had a warrant for uh gabin and um they i could hear them talking up until they and then
[1:33:23.540 --> 1:33:28.500]  they loaded him into the car and he said hey could you take my phone out of my pocket they took the
[1:33:28.500 --> 1:33:33.140]  phone out of the pocket and they said is there anybody on here and i said yeah you know i was
[1:33:33.140 --> 1:33:39.540]  listening to it um uh and uh that was uh actually i saw them telling her getting the car too did
[1:33:39.540 --> 1:33:45.300]  they arrest her too that was after i got off the phone but apparently they got her too i don't know
[1:33:45.300 --> 1:33:49.380]  why they go oh we got another one here so they're like talking about it yeah that's okay but they
[1:33:49.380 --> 1:33:56.100]  only they said they only had a warrant for him uh and and uh they told her if you haven't seen
[1:33:56.100 --> 1:34:00.020]  this yet they told her put your shoes on you're going to the car yeah and they identified her as a
[1:34:00.020 --> 1:34:06.260]  she identified as a journalist uh uh so yeah uh that's exactly what happened
[1:34:08.500 --> 1:34:12.180]  explain to people because you're an expert on this without getting any secret stuff what's
[1:34:12.180 --> 1:34:20.420]  happening and why this is so dangerous to the deep state well um my story uh kind of apparently ties
[1:34:20.420 --> 1:34:28.900]  into tori's story i don't really i haven't even seen the video yet myself i came uh i met with uh
[1:34:28.900 --> 1:34:36.820]  millie and gavin at their place in in ohio back uh it's on fourth july weekend um i did a uh a
[1:34:36.820 --> 1:34:42.980]  interview with millie and they've just been working and researching verifying the stuff that i said
[1:34:42.980 --> 1:34:51.620]  everything that i told them is completely publicly available uh my work is a do d memorandum
[1:34:51.620 --> 1:34:56.580]  signed do d memorandum that's a letter of reference it says thank you for the great work you did on
[1:34:56.580 --> 1:35:05.700]  this classified ia program in iraq uh by the ia chief right i use it for my resume um it's just
[1:35:05.700 --> 1:35:14.580]  when i came back to the states in 2015 um after really seeing a lot of bad things happening
[1:35:15.540 --> 1:35:21.620]  i you know i filed an ig complaint and then the ig complaint got crushed and i was like what's
[1:35:21.620 --> 1:35:26.420]  going on so every person that i went to through the chain of command all the way through like to my
[1:35:26.420 --> 1:35:33.220]  congressman most people wouldn't even return my call and so i spent the last several years
[1:35:33.220 --> 1:35:44.660]  uh watching iia uh uh clearly what what were clearly in my opinion iia operations um scientific
[1:35:45.300 --> 1:35:52.260]  mind control propaganda mockingbird 2.0 against the people totally illegal well you know um we
[1:35:52.820 --> 1:35:58.340]  there are good things and bad things you could do with it a lot of it is completely legal iia as
[1:35:58.340 --> 1:36:04.980]  you can see in the policy guidelines for the do d which i post everywhere iia supports the pao
[1:36:04.980 --> 1:36:11.780]  now they can either do that overtly or covertly right so there are many there are numerous benefits
[1:36:11.780 --> 1:36:20.020]  that an overt iia program can help build behavioral and relationships uh yeah sure yeah brush your
[1:36:20.020 --> 1:36:24.500]  teeth don't burn your house down don't smoke crack exactly but instead it turns into america socks
[1:36:24.500 --> 1:36:29.380]  burn down the police station well you know if you can and this is what president trump's just
[1:36:29.380 --> 1:36:37.060]  looking at putting a billion dollars into it if you can predictively determine if someone's likely to
[1:36:37.060 --> 1:36:42.180]  let's say go shoot up a school using the same tool that's what william benney talks about is this
[1:36:42.180 --> 1:36:45.780]  can actually pinpoint and predict instead of surveilling everybody it picks up the telltale
[1:36:45.780 --> 1:36:48.820]  signs and then surveils them well let's get into all the different facets of when we come back
[1:36:48.820 --> 1:36:58.340]  how do you contest an election in the year 2020 well you trigger race riots and you tell the blue
[1:36:58.340 --> 1:37:02.980]  states and blue cities when you're the speaker of the house that you are legitimately now the president
[1:37:02.980 --> 1:37:07.780]  that's what she's been said on cbs news and that you're going to have those blue states
[1:37:07.780 --> 1:37:13.620]  succeed yes that's officially called a civil war ladies and gentlemen and the democrats are back
[1:37:13.620 --> 1:37:19.460]  by the eu hollywood the chikoms and the whole globalist system this is treason with a capital T
[1:37:19.460 --> 1:37:24.260]  and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards they won't even stand up against it and
[1:37:24.260 --> 1:37:28.900]  do anything even though our president has been exposing it but here's the bottom line you need
[1:37:28.900 --> 1:37:33.620]  storable food we've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now two to four week delivery
[1:37:33.620 --> 1:37:37.380]  with 80 days out from the election you need to get high quality storeable food right now

[1:37:45.380 --> 1:37:51.700]  ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com get prepared the social engineers bet on you not
[1:37:51.700 --> 1:37:56.980]  having a memory more than anything they also bet as they constantly talk about it in their own words
[1:37:56.980 --> 1:38:02.660]  that you will adapt to being a slave that you will learn incrementally to submit so think about
[1:38:02.660 --> 1:38:08.580]  and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud remember that everything he said has been a premeditated
[1:38:08.580 --> 1:38:14.420]  lie they lied about where it came from they lied about person to person the un covered it all up
[1:38:14.420 --> 1:38:22.660]  then exaggerated the death rate at four percent but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping then they
[1:38:22.660 --> 1:38:27.460]  set the test up to count almost all false positives they put the names of people that died of other
[1:38:27.460 --> 1:38:32.820]  diseases in the covet column they only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown now we're six months later
[1:38:32.820 --> 1:38:37.380]  now they say it's permanent you got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and
[1:38:37.380 --> 1:38:41.060]  they're going to track everywhere you go and what you do the global social credit score and the
[1:38:41.060 --> 1:38:45.940]  un is the boss anybody questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job that's called
[1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:58.100]  21st century tyranny that's called world government takeover you hear that that's the march of the
[1:38:58.100 --> 1:39:05.940]  united nations and the bill of millen the gates foundation coming with their battle plan psychological
[1:39:05.940 --> 1:39:12.420]  warfare operation with the forced inoculations and the permanent lockdown of civilization in
[1:39:12.420 --> 1:39:18.020]  society they're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu they're creating artificial
[1:39:18.020 --> 1:39:22.580]  phobias for normal death that takes place they're not even promising to have a cure to it all
[1:39:22.580 --> 1:39:28.260]  they're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed by the
[1:39:28.260 --> 1:39:37.140]  who with vaccines that actually change your dna and make you owned by microsoft it's a final
[1:39:37.140 --> 1:39:46.580]  frontier it's the year 2020 it's not coming it's here and submission is blood in the water
[1:39:49.780 --> 1:39:56.180]  this is a maximum alert a maximum alert as of taping this alert you're 82 days out from the
[1:39:56.180 --> 1:40:01.300]  election as many of you know in the last year i've pointed out statements out of the council on
[1:40:01.300 --> 1:40:06.660]  foreign relations and other globalist organs that they know trump is going to win in a landslide
[1:40:06.660 --> 1:40:13.220]  so their strategy will be to contest the election if they fail to successfully steal it then they
[1:40:13.220 --> 1:40:18.180]  are openly now wargaming this is in the new york times having democrat states and cities
[1:40:18.180 --> 1:40:23.460]  secede from the union just like they've ignored trumps policies and coronavirus and kept their
[1:40:23.460 --> 1:40:28.020]  areas locked down that is nothing but a dress rehearsal they are saying they're going to have
[1:40:28.020 --> 1:40:34.500]  their own separate inauguration not in dc they said in another city colosia said this when they
[1:40:34.500 --> 1:40:42.020]  crown biden and kamala harris ladies and gentlemen this is the organized civil war this is their
[1:40:42.020 --> 1:40:46.740]  public criminal plan we should be praying we should be spreading the word we should be demanding
[1:40:46.740 --> 1:40:56.100]  trouble in the office to expose this criminal activity you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:09.780 --> 1:41:12.580]  the answer to 1984
[1:41:12.580 --> 1:41:16.180]  war is 1776
[1:41:24.340 --> 1:41:29.300]  info wars has been banned arrested
[1:41:29.300 --> 1:41:40.500]  attacked and threatened because we are effective the great awakening is here
[1:41:40.500 --> 1:41:51.140]  go to band dot video download the videos and share support the information war at infowarstore.com
[1:41:51.140 --> 1:41:59.940]  and never give up the fight
[1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:07.940]  info wars dot com
[1:42:10.820 --> 1:42:15.940]  all right stuff's crazy patrick murray works in the department of defense in all these classified
[1:42:15.940 --> 1:42:22.180]  areas and i know that tori who's been working in the navy and then in clandestine areas after that
[1:42:22.180 --> 1:42:28.020]  was working as a consultant with millie we were her husband gabin wench and she's getting into
[1:42:28.020 --> 1:42:32.740]  worms on people's computers and spying on brennan that's why when i heard all this was going on i
[1:42:32.740 --> 1:42:37.620]  said is that the film well no not really i'm like man this is dangerous i was really warning millie
[1:42:37.620 --> 1:42:42.900]  to watch out when i was in dc and they had real cloak and dagger not fake wannabe spies around
[1:42:42.900 --> 1:42:46.420]  like the real deal and i was like you need to really be careful what you're involved in because
[1:42:46.420 --> 1:42:51.380]  i don't get involved in any of this i open source to all my research have guessed on and and that's
[1:42:51.380 --> 1:42:57.220]  that because they've tried to set us up a bunch and it's very dangerous and i and i and i mean
[1:42:57.220 --> 1:43:01.140]  we're gonna find out what's happened to millie we're gonna get our partner back on as soon as
[1:43:01.140 --> 1:43:09.220]  she knows more so much is unfolding but getting back to patrick murray so so so this is a big deal
[1:43:09.220 --> 1:43:14.180]  explain it in layman's terms and what you think president trump needs to do 80 days out from
[1:43:14.180 --> 1:43:18.900]  the election with this technology being used against loyal americans and people loyal to the
[1:43:18.900 --> 1:43:25.780]  republic and the government well every bit of evidence that i've discovered shows that the
[1:43:25.780 --> 1:43:31.060]  shadow net which that's not anything classified it was called that's what they named it and
[1:43:31.060 --> 1:43:36.420]  trademarked it when they took the do d weapon that we had developed for the four psychological
[1:43:36.420 --> 1:43:45.220]  operations group and made it commercially available back in 2009 as president obama is taking office
[1:43:45.860 --> 1:43:50.900]  so when i started reaching out to all these people i reached out to judge janine pierrow
[1:43:52.660 --> 1:43:59.060]  spoke to her on the phone obviously it was her and she responded back working on this now
[1:43:59.060 --> 1:44:06.340]  now uh i reached out to uh uh and that that's right after uh uh my congressman had sent a
[1:44:06.340 --> 1:44:13.700]  letter to a member signed sworn memorandum of record to devin newness's office saying that
[1:44:13.700 --> 1:44:20.900]  all the people that were tied to my work on the shadow net are behind are directly hands on
[1:44:20.900 --> 1:44:30.180]  involved in the fabricated russian dossier in the um uh and then they uh they they in cambridge
[1:44:30.180 --> 1:44:36.740]  analytical through wiki strat and side group um and then face so they kind of fence the shadow
[1:44:36.740 --> 1:44:43.060]  net info through those those groups and then and then compile the dossier it's a it's a subprime
[1:44:43.060 --> 1:44:48.980]  relationship right these come but like you were saying earlier we weren't there but they can also
[1:44:48.980 --> 1:44:54.420]  plant things or i guess parry was saying this they also use these these systems to to plant
[1:44:54.420 --> 1:45:00.500]  things on people as well but like we saw in the in the whole uh vault seven stuff iia interactive
[1:45:00.500 --> 1:45:06.180]  internet activities supports cno um computer network operations which is what that would
[1:45:06.180 --> 1:45:11.300]  fall under these are all this is all the military nomenclature uh for every so the bottom line is
[1:45:11.300 --> 1:45:15.300]  military technologies being used against the american people yes you saw it you've spoken out
[1:45:15.300 --> 1:45:20.660]  yes you tried to go to all the big fish which is smart they're credible first well say what you
[1:45:20.660 --> 1:45:24.900]  said during the break you're like yeah i didn't come to info wars first just call info wars what
[1:45:24.900 --> 1:45:28.660]  and explain it because it doesn't hurt my feelings explain why you wouldn't come here first
[1:45:29.220 --> 1:45:36.580]  the i mean the i'm the pioneer of iia basically social media fake news the last place that i'm
[1:45:36.580 --> 1:45:44.980]  gonna go is a uh organization called information warfare right so but then as i started reaching
[1:45:44.980 --> 1:45:52.020]  out to everybody that's like speaking bad and going against you uh for the most part is i'm
[1:45:52.020 --> 1:45:57.700]  reaching out to them i'm finding that as soon as they find out my story i never hear from them again
[1:45:57.700 --> 1:46:03.380]  sure but you get i've got the name info wars to expose it but like like we're calling it what
[1:46:03.380 --> 1:46:08.980]  we're fighting but then i had the problem that yeah okay i was working for general james jones
[1:46:08.980 --> 1:46:15.620]  jones our number one partner and this is 2008 2009 2010 our number one partner help we were
[1:46:15.620 --> 1:46:23.060]  mckayne's it security company and social media company during the 08 primary we were replaced
[1:46:23.060 --> 1:46:32.900]  in a sub prime shift with paul maniforte and roger stone right so your partner is someone who was
[1:46:32.900 --> 1:46:40.580]  was direct who who is close personal friends to my boss jim jones his dad general james jones
[1:46:41.140 --> 1:46:48.180]  and dynology the company i worked for when i'm helping them make these flyers didn't have any
[1:46:48.180 --> 1:46:54.500]  sales people and three but explain that to people because i know that general jones was involved
[1:46:54.500 --> 1:46:58.900]  consulting trump early on i know he has some you know involved with the stone goes around
[1:46:58.900 --> 1:47:02.660]  and works for all these groups but something something i mean spell it out what are you getting a
[1:47:02.660 --> 1:47:06.820]  380 because i can tell you nobody nobody's calling me up from the cia or general jones and
[1:47:06.820 --> 1:47:10.820]  never telling me what to do i mean i'm literally do whatever i want and that's not how it would work
[1:47:11.380 --> 1:47:18.500]  what we would do is we would use an organization like info wars using you as an asset whether you
[1:47:18.500 --> 1:47:26.180]  know about it or not is completely irrelevant if you have uh uh the the client the clients that you
[1:47:26.180 --> 1:47:33.860]  have your demographics fit a very uh you know a target rich environment for ia right so naturally
[1:47:33.860 --> 1:47:39.860]  and and just to prove no but understand the chicken or the egg i chose that name and to do that to
[1:47:39.860 --> 1:47:44.580]  engage that yes yes but look it's not if you're going square dancing you dress up a square dancing
[1:47:44.580 --> 1:47:48.740]  outfit i mean i mean if you want to play golf you get your golf clubs oh trust us i mean i went to
[1:47:48.740 --> 1:47:54.020]  the golf course trust me i'm trying to affect this with truth instead of sneaking around no no
[1:47:54.020 --> 1:47:58.260]  i've come to the conclusion that you're like ironically enough you're like the one person
[1:47:58.260 --> 1:48:03.300]  in media that i could trust that's why when she was arrested when gabin was arrested
[1:48:03.300 --> 1:48:08.660]  they didn't tell me to came to come here i came here on my own well that's the thing is i was like
[1:48:08.660 --> 1:48:12.020]  millie you said this would be done last week then it'd be wednesday thursday or actin on weird you
[1:48:12.020 --> 1:48:16.740]  never do this she's like oh they've got my phones they're following me and then you know uh you know
[1:48:16.740 --> 1:48:21.060]  he's in town patrick burgey and i'm like why don't he's a good guy i want to interview him but
[1:48:21.060 --> 1:48:25.220]  you got to set this up you got to send me clips i want to promote it and then she was like oh
[1:48:25.220 --> 1:48:28.980]  they're after me you got to call me this morning i was like working out i'm like oh millie's
[1:48:28.980 --> 1:48:33.380]  paranoid and then now this happens so now i'm kind of like okay i don't know what's going on right
[1:48:34.660 --> 1:48:40.740]  so that's where we're at i can't trust anybody in the media dan bonjino sarah carter sarah
[1:48:40.740 --> 1:48:45.060]  carter sent well there's no bonjino is scared they broke in his house he asked me not to tell
[1:48:45.060 --> 1:48:49.540]  people that but they did a bunch of stuff to him and he's just his wife can't handle well i mean
[1:48:49.540 --> 1:48:54.100]  look i have guests on people that said three years ago five g in a study causes people to have
[1:48:54.100 --> 1:48:58.340]  breathing problems and lowers oxygen it's a mainline study they called his wife and said we'll
[1:48:58.340 --> 1:49:02.180]  cut your head off we saw you in the front yard with your two kids and the dog five minutes ago
[1:49:02.180 --> 1:49:06.180]  we're gonna rape you to death the doctor won't come on now they threatened to murder his wife
[1:49:06.180 --> 1:49:10.740]  they were watching her so at a certain point you know bonjino okay tough guy he can't handle it
[1:49:11.540 --> 1:49:15.620]  so yeah he's not a bad guy you just you know his wife can't stand them breaking their house
[1:49:15.620 --> 1:49:20.100]  every way well you know uh that's they were doing right breaking his house all the time
[1:49:20.100 --> 1:49:25.140]  because they thought he was giving me info i got it from other secret service that hillary was in a
[1:49:25.140 --> 1:49:29.860]  black uh ambulance that was falling down all the time and it was millie almost caught her on
[1:49:29.860 --> 1:49:35.700]  tape in ohio then two weeks later in new york she fell down i don't know what his justification
[1:49:35.700 --> 1:49:40.100]  might be you're well i'm just saying i'm just saying to say oh bonjino did that be on i don't
[1:49:40.100 --> 1:49:45.620]  it's not because he's bad fox tells them the nra would tell them who they can have on it wasn't
[1:49:45.620 --> 1:49:49.700]  you understand all those guys are good people it wasn't about being i mean i mean take take take
[1:49:49.700 --> 1:49:55.780]  judge the politics he's totally blackmail it's not anything illegal he's doing but he's blackmail
[1:49:55.780 --> 1:50:00.500]  why do you think he's anti-trunk i'm not blackmailable because i don't do anything bad and i don't
[1:50:00.500 --> 1:50:05.140]  care whatever they make up anyways i don't want to get back into me i just think we're a prototype
[1:50:05.140 --> 1:50:11.220]  of how to defeat this yeah and it's a much bigger story than what i can explain here in a few minutes
[1:50:11.220 --> 1:50:17.460]  that's for sure right uh but um everything you got you got 30 more minutes so just yeah everything
[1:50:17.460 --> 1:50:21.700]  tell folks what's coming up the next 30 minutes what else you're gonna get off your chest so
[1:50:21.700 --> 1:50:30.500]  everything that brought me here today um is you know is pretty much in this video that she's putting
[1:50:30.500 --> 1:50:39.220]  out um and uh i didn't know where to go right because uh everybody that i thought i could trust
[1:50:40.100 --> 1:50:46.580]  turned out turned around and for whatever their reasons all right chose to just cover their own
[1:50:46.580 --> 1:50:52.660]  ass or whatever right i you can everybody keeps trying to keep their head down but a world of
[1:50:52.660 --> 1:50:58.820]  people with their head down are not even humans yeah yeah um i you know i enlisted in the army
[1:50:58.820 --> 1:51:03.060]  at 39 right i was the first 40 year old to complete basic training in the history of fort
[1:51:03.060 --> 1:51:08.820]  benning i am by all definitions a patriot right so did not let them make you do that
[1:51:09.460 --> 1:51:17.860]  largely yeah largely and uh you know so when i see when i come to people as someone who is a
[1:51:17.860 --> 1:51:24.260]  legitimate doji g filed complaint complaint filed whistleblower and they're in journalism
[1:51:24.260 --> 1:51:33.140]  and i see them doing things that are clearly um damaging to the freedom of press right their assets
[1:51:34.340 --> 1:51:37.300]  these people my job stay right there back into a minute
[1:51:39.380 --> 1:51:47.060]  Nancy Pelosi Eric Holder Joe Biden Hillary Clinton and the list goes on from there have all gone on
[1:51:47.060 --> 1:51:51.460]  national tv have all gone on the internet and have been in the pages of the new york times
[1:51:51.460 --> 1:51:56.980]  that they're wargaming contesting the election when they lose they know there's a landslide
[1:51:56.980 --> 1:52:02.260]  if they're unable to steal it they're planning to contest it and have democrat blue states
[1:52:02.260 --> 1:52:08.260]  secede and hold their own treasonous inauguration for joe bighton and the other public kamala harris
[1:52:08.260 --> 1:52:14.180]  this has now been announced and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover to try to
[1:52:14.180 --> 1:52:20.420]  drive trump from office the democratic party the chai cons the deep state are using black lives matter
[1:52:20.420 --> 1:52:26.580]  black matter funded by soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their attempts at creating
[1:52:26.580 --> 1:52:32.500]  artificial riots and martial law that you're racist when in truth an old nazi collaborator
[1:52:32.500 --> 1:52:37.780]  george soros created black lives matter along with antifa america's fighting for its life but we
[1:52:37.780 --> 1:52:46.980]  will win i'm cutting the sad on wednesday august 12 2025 this coming sunday this huge sale we've
[1:52:46.980 --> 1:52:53.060]  been running for last week we'll have to end the reopen america back to school special 50 percent
[1:52:53.060 --> 1:53:00.020]  off to 60 percent off all of our top bestsellers and double pay three at points i have to end this
[1:53:00.020 --> 1:53:05.060]  sale because selling out of bodies at 50 percent off living defense at the percent off as obi
[1:53:05.060 --> 1:53:09.700]  for the percent off turbo forcibly sent off by the mineral season percent off those are all
[1:53:09.700 --> 1:53:15.300]  very close to selling out a bunch of other bestsellers we still have but i will end this special
[1:53:15.300 --> 1:53:22.260]  on sunday we have a new great special coming up next week but it's not as extensive or expansive
[1:53:22.260 --> 1:53:27.380]  x2 the original will be back at stock it will be discounted but it's not available yet so this is
[1:53:27.380 --> 1:53:32.500]  a great sale it funds the operation they're great items in crazy times like this it's good to stock
[1:53:32.500 --> 1:53:36.820]  up but whatever you do keep spreading the word about info wars because you are the modern voice
[1:53:36.820 --> 1:53:38.820]  you are paul revere and i salute you and thank you
[1:53:38.820 --> 1:53:46.100]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:56.580 --> 1:54:00.660]  so we knew the film was coming out this week even in austin a few days patrick murray
[1:54:01.860 --> 1:54:08.180]  former cyber security veteran former dod contractor working on shadow net film is shadow gate
[1:54:08.180 --> 1:54:14.420]  millie weaver and her husband by the video last hour got arrested in ohio today grand jury for
[1:54:14.420 --> 1:54:19.940]  stealing documents i guess or something uh they wouldn't even tell me he said burglary uh and so
[1:54:19.940 --> 1:54:24.100]  that's now happened so i guess her paranoia has turned out to not be paranoia uh but legitimate
[1:54:24.100 --> 1:54:29.460]  concern and so patrick burgey this is a five-minute segment ten minutes segments coming up next but
[1:54:30.180 --> 1:54:33.540]  getting because you already covered a lot of incredible things the point is this is going on
[1:54:33.540 --> 1:54:40.980]  domestically what does president trump need to do um well uh president trump needs to i mean the
[1:54:40.980 --> 1:54:49.940]  whole world needs to in my opinion sort of take a take a mulligan and um acknowledge that all of
[1:54:49.940 --> 1:54:56.900]  this is happening and that we're just destroying our country we're destroying the integrity of
[1:54:56.900 --> 1:55:01.220]  the election process that's for sure which is the core of our democracy but i would argue
[1:55:01.220 --> 1:55:06.180]  and so do a lot of people that we're actually destroying humanity in the process and again
[1:55:06.180 --> 1:55:10.820]  explain in layman's terms what this system does how manipulates minds how it can how does it control
[1:55:10.820 --> 1:55:19.060]  media well you know uh uh the same thing we indicted the 13 russians for right fake personas
[1:55:19.060 --> 1:55:25.060]  one person could be five different people one person could be one analyst could be five or
[1:55:25.060 --> 1:55:31.540]  ten different personas soft puppets megaphones one person can be five to ten different fake
[1:55:31.540 --> 1:55:39.620]  personas in a social media uh chat room right and he can be arguing with himself sharing links
[1:55:40.260 --> 1:55:48.820]  between his multiple profiles which helps both increase the search engine optimization increases
[1:55:48.820 --> 1:55:56.100]  uh trending and um increases legitimacy so we're talking about election meddling type stuff well
[1:55:56.100 --> 1:56:01.220]  we're talking about anything it can amplify whatever you want it's artificial it's artificial
[1:56:01.220 --> 1:56:08.100]  right so they understand how people will reflexively behave when you put a certain stimulus or certain
[1:56:08.660 --> 1:56:14.580]  information right so if we understand how people are going to behave then we build enough we collect
[1:56:14.580 --> 1:56:23.860]  enough data on them and in like clear force which is a product of shadow net like built from its
[1:56:23.860 --> 1:56:30.420]  relational database core clearforce.com owned by general jones owned by general hayden and some
[1:56:30.420 --> 1:56:37.860]  of the top people with the biggest credit reporting agencies and such on clearforce.com right so that
[1:56:37.860 --> 1:56:44.100]  was built from the core that was built from taxpayer funded dod weapon which is used to determine
[1:56:44.100 --> 1:56:51.140]  whether or not you lose a job that you currently have or get a job you're applying to now how does
[1:56:51.140 --> 1:56:56.740]  it do that it says right on their website it builds predictive behavioral models that determine
[1:56:56.740 --> 1:57:02.900]  whether or not you're predictively likely to steal or leak it's a minority report but instead of the
[1:57:02.900 --> 1:57:09.700]  precogs you've got jones and hayden back there programming algorithms so what if they decide to
[1:57:09.700 --> 1:57:15.780]  you know say anybody who listens to alex jones we don't want working at our company or anybody who
[1:57:15.780 --> 1:57:20.740]  voted for barack obama we don't want because it's not about politics it's an incredibly dangerous
[1:57:20.740 --> 1:57:26.980]  discriminatory system so we're worried about black versus white this is ai versus everybody oh it's far
[1:57:26.980 --> 1:57:34.180]  beyond just like fake personas on you know on on social media it's total information awareness
[1:57:34.180 --> 1:57:39.140]  total information control yeah and that you can see like right on their website they show that
[1:57:39.140 --> 1:57:47.380]  this company centric is invent in a uk financing firm invested billions of dollars into clear force
[1:57:47.380 --> 1:57:54.500]  and then the very next month you can see that this china owned firm invested a 15 billion dollars
[1:57:54.500 --> 1:58:03.220]  into centric is and then you can see that that same month general jones partnered with facebook
[1:58:03.220 --> 1:58:10.580]  through atlantic council as god is my witness alex to restore election integrity worldwide and
[1:58:10.580 --> 1:58:17.060]  i kind of think that people need to have a discussion about that because but nobody will
[1:58:17.060 --> 1:58:24.980]  listen nobody would hear me and millie and gavin did to their credit and i warned them i said
[1:58:24.980 --> 1:58:29.700]  you know this isn't going to be good there's a reason that someone as big as you know built
[1:58:29.700 --> 1:58:37.380]  wise is as bunjino was afraid of these well that's right and also again trump wants to get rid of this
[1:58:37.380 --> 1:58:41.380]  but it's so obsessed with both parties are so heavily invested involved that's why it doesn't
[1:58:41.380 --> 1:58:45.540]  stop yeah we'll be right back and again like you said it's wedded to communist china it's gotta be
[1:58:45.540 --> 1:58:54.580]  shut down the new world order is a planetary corporate plan for world government but world
[1:58:54.580 --> 1:59:01.540]  government is only the control grid now intermembers of the cult are told that they are going to
[1:59:01.540 --> 1:59:07.780]  transcend and become gods and attain immortality but the price for that is to carry out the orderly
[1:59:07.780 --> 1:59:14.900]  extermination of all carbon based line forms that's why they say carbon is bad they are rewriting
[1:59:14.900 --> 1:59:22.020]  the entire genetic code of the planet they are playing god they believe they have been inspired
[1:59:22.020 --> 1:59:28.100]  by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this
[1:59:28.100 --> 1:59:33.700]  transformation i know this sounds insane but if you read the writings of the globalist it's all
[1:59:33.700 --> 1:59:41.700]  on record you have been warned you have been given the information to say no to this plan
[1:59:41.700 --> 1:59:57.620]  this is the end of all life on earth as we know it this is the alien takeover of earth
[1:59:57.620 --> 2:00:09.780]  spend my days with a woman and kind smoke my stove and drink all my wine
[2:00:14.500 --> 2:00:19.860]  you made up my mind me can you start gonna kill here's what's happening with technology and
[2:00:19.860 --> 2:00:24.980]  information systems it's giving companies and governments edges over commerce free market
[2:00:24.980 --> 2:00:30.580]  and the people and they're able to deceptively not just spy on people but use that data to control
[2:00:30.580 --> 2:00:36.260]  the masses of people and it's being used to basically in the country and you were just saying
[2:00:36.260 --> 2:00:39.540]  trump doesn't understand this trump doesn't know this and i agree people that know him know
[2:00:40.180 --> 2:00:45.380]  that when it comes to technology he has good instincts he loves america he's an industrialist
[2:00:46.340 --> 2:00:50.340]  but they're running circles around him on this and that's why they disrespect him because he
[2:00:50.340 --> 2:00:55.700]  doesn't know how to get control of the national security apparatus why they got rid of humet
[2:00:55.700 --> 2:00:59.460]  was because they are fear humans being empowered and knowing how things work they want to make it
[2:00:59.460 --> 2:01:05.060]  all digital so that we can all be compartmentalized that's what this whole lockdown is is the post
[2:01:05.060 --> 2:01:12.100]  human rollout agreed so um we'll talk about trump what is i mean well what are his weak
[2:01:12.100 --> 2:01:19.940]  points how can well what should he do i i i honestly don't know you know i think we need to
[2:01:19.940 --> 2:01:26.820]  literally all like i said take a mulligan have like a salt level you know strategic arms limitation
[2:01:26.820 --> 2:01:34.420]  treaty on IIA because everybody you know the the democrats just focused on russia russia russia
[2:01:34.420 --> 2:01:39.540]  doing this that's their distraction from them with true weaponized but as someone who worked for
[2:01:39.540 --> 2:01:45.620]  three years in IIA with the department of defense i mean they're like the least that i worry about
[2:01:45.620 --> 2:01:50.260]  the i was about to say i mean the we're not defending the right but they're a red herring
[2:01:50.260 --> 2:01:55.540]  who's most powerful when it comes to this type of propaganda and cyber warfare um
[2:01:56.180 --> 2:02:05.940]  pro i would say probably general jones america domestically um israel extremely powerful right
[2:02:05.940 --> 2:02:12.740]  but also directly tied to uh uh also directly tied to general jones through wiki strat and joel
[2:02:12.740 --> 2:02:19.220]  uh zamel who i believe wiki strat is actually wiki leaks i believe psi group is actually
[2:02:19.220 --> 2:02:24.980]  psi i psi the name of our relational database that's actually how we do and why do they keep
[2:02:24.980 --> 2:02:29.620]  assange in jail when it didn't come from the russians it probably did come from general jones
[2:02:29.620 --> 2:02:34.900]  that's the word i was told back during the campaign and then they tried to blame roger and i i can
[2:02:34.900 --> 2:02:38.820]  tell you roger did not have these high level connections you think he couldn't even get the
[2:02:38.820 --> 2:02:43.700]  time of day from julina saunch but i but i'm general jones i know was involved at those levels from
[2:02:43.700 --> 2:02:50.580]  what i've seen so those questions that you answer ask are all questions that i've been trying to
[2:02:50.580 --> 2:02:55.300]  get remember trev's like i love wiki leaks release at all and then he leaves assange there i don't
[2:02:55.300 --> 2:03:00.420]  like that he did the right thing you know getting roger plenty why do you think he's not helped
[2:03:00.420 --> 2:03:06.020]  julina saunch uh i don't know these are all questions that i'm trying to get answers to
[2:03:06.020 --> 2:03:11.380]  because i know all the people that were involved with the shatter net are all directly involved
[2:03:11.380 --> 2:03:15.700]  in that uh general jones and michael hayden are on the board of directors of wiki strat wiki
[2:03:15.700 --> 2:03:22.100]  strat was directly connected uh is is owned by psych joel zemel side group wiki strat they were
[2:03:22.100 --> 2:03:29.940]  both tied to the cambridge analytica uh scandal where facebook again got fined a billion dollars
[2:03:29.940 --> 2:03:35.940]  and then turned around and partnered with the subcontractors to cambridge analytica to
[2:03:35.940 --> 2:03:43.300]  what restore election integrity worldwide right so these are questions people need to ask and get
[2:03:43.300 --> 2:03:51.060]  answers to because as far as i'm concerned um uh uh uh zuckerberg lied in front of congress
[2:03:51.060 --> 2:03:56.020]  and he needs to explain why well that's not your opinion all of them have lied in front of congress
[2:03:56.020 --> 2:04:02.100]  i mean google goes we don't track any user ever with a phone it's like saying and birds don't fly
[2:04:02.100 --> 2:04:07.700]  i mean it's like what i mean how do they get away with that congress knows all this what is it's
[2:04:08.580 --> 2:04:14.660]  again i try not to speculate outside of what i actually know but these are all the questions
[2:04:14.660 --> 2:04:21.060]  that have brought me here today and brought me to uh the other people that i've tried to get
[2:04:21.060 --> 2:04:28.500]  information and spoke to i just i had no idea that because i spent like about seven eight years
[2:04:28.500 --> 2:04:36.100]  overseas i had no idea when i came back to the states that these tools that we had pioneered
[2:04:36.100 --> 2:04:44.020]  to use against our ever series had just been it's just been commercially sold politically
[2:04:44.020 --> 2:04:48.980]  throughout our country on both side i had no idea the depth of what's going on real quick
[2:04:48.980 --> 2:04:56.340]  the vice president of jones group international jillian turner is of is a is a fox news host
[2:04:56.340 --> 2:05:01.940]  she was a fox news host while she was vice president of jones group international jones
[2:05:01.940 --> 2:05:06.820]  group international is owned by general jones they own jones group international owns the
[2:05:06.820 --> 2:05:15.060]  shadow net right and and she's a fox news host it's does she get pro does she profit from that
[2:05:15.620 --> 2:05:21.060]  i mean people need to understand that they have put assets i mean this is what i'm by the way
[2:05:21.060 --> 2:05:25.220]  i'm not defending general jones or any of these people what you're saying is on record but i don't
[2:05:25.220 --> 2:05:30.580]  want to get tunnel vision here you know google and facebook and twitter and all these other groups
[2:05:30.580 --> 2:05:34.340]  have their own similar systems and so they do partnerships is because they're all trying to
[2:05:34.340 --> 2:05:40.580]  get more data on the other one and that's why like china and huawei it's always scoop up more more
[2:05:40.580 --> 2:05:44.660]  so your perspective was from the military and general jones who are the other big players though
[2:05:46.420 --> 2:05:53.940]  well uh you can go back to google right we have a shadow net flyer right and which is a publicly
[2:05:53.940 --> 2:06:00.980]  disseminated shadow and google was set up by the pentagon google's google's uh irkut which was
[2:06:00.980 --> 2:06:08.180]  basically shut down because it had because in part by too many fake personas google's irkut is
[2:06:08.180 --> 2:06:14.020]  literally there's an active engagement as a screenshot on the shadow net flyer for google's
[2:06:14.020 --> 2:06:19.220]  irkut now i would like to know did google know that they were doing that and if they didn't know
[2:06:19.220 --> 2:06:23.540]  that they of course they knew but but but it's like facebook was the cia operation in the day
[2:06:23.540 --> 2:06:31.780]  when publicly shut it down and put it to facebook and that's in futile i that i can't say but i can
[2:06:31.780 --> 2:06:40.180]  say in 2018 facebook partnered with the owner of the shadow net to restore election integrity
[2:06:40.180 --> 2:06:48.180]  worldwide so yeah kind of fits doesn't it you know this is all publicly available well clearly
[2:06:48.180 --> 2:06:54.340]  90 plus percent of the media is against trump they're using this against trump they're using it
[2:06:54.340 --> 2:06:58.820]  however it benefits them but i mean the establishment the main attack is against trump
[2:06:59.860 --> 2:07:06.100]  sure sure if it benefits them to attack trump they will attack trump if it benefits them to
[2:07:06.100 --> 2:07:11.060]  use trump to hurt their enemies they will use trump to hurt their enemies it has nothing to
[2:07:11.060 --> 2:07:16.020]  solve very sociopathic it's nothing to do with politics it's all about power and profit people
[2:07:16.020 --> 2:07:22.100]  got to get the politics out of their mind with this once you can accept that it starts making sense
[2:07:22.660 --> 2:07:26.340]  well i'm going to try to find out what's going on millie weaver who got arrested along with her
[2:07:26.340 --> 2:07:31.780]  husband about three and a half hours ago and we've already played the video here she is a
[2:07:31.780 --> 2:07:37.380]  contractor with info or she does her own reports but we're a sponsor of hers and she does reports
[2:07:37.380 --> 2:07:41.540]  for us but she was making this film with some other whistleblowers and people and she's been
[2:07:41.540 --> 2:07:46.020]  arrested that should be big national news but of course it won't be because this is the new
[2:07:46.020 --> 2:07:49.780]  climate in our country literally barefoot with her children in her house this morning
[2:07:49.780 --> 2:07:53.940]  uh and this happened uh patrick burgey i really appreciate you spending time with us today

[2:08:24.340 --> 2:08:30.420]  the swamp dot com which i set up a long time ago but i was rating everything to uh freedom stream
[2:08:30.420 --> 2:08:34.100]  dot tv well you're doing a great job and we appreciate you coming in we need to get on the
[2:08:34.100 --> 2:08:38.340]  phone and maybe you can't figure out what's going on millie weaver and gabin winster husband thank
[2:08:38.340 --> 2:08:42.740]  you sir uh both hard work and folks who got involved with me really really had involved
[2:08:42.740 --> 2:08:47.220]  some serious stuff and i don't know what's going on yet but i know that they don't want this coming
[2:08:47.220 --> 2:08:50.820]  out i think they probably planted something on them or did something i think it's gonna come out
[2:08:50.820 --> 2:08:56.180]  only because it's the same oh they tried it with us a bunch and um again they were willing to do it
[2:08:56.180 --> 2:09:00.020]  so their winners or whatever happens to them they decided this is where they wanted to be yes sir
[2:09:00.020 --> 2:09:06.500]  and uh it's just a serious situation so listeners understand that and again come back on with us
[2:09:06.500 --> 2:09:12.100]  in the next few days uh as the stuff holds can i say one more thing for a long time i've been trying
[2:09:12.100 --> 2:09:18.260]  to get a classified briefing to where i could explain a lot more things than what i can explain
[2:09:18.260 --> 2:09:23.380]  to the president or somebody else to the president only the president because it's not going to do
[2:09:23.380 --> 2:09:26.900]  well listen i'm not bragging but we actually got him to talk to william benny that did happen
[2:09:27.460 --> 2:09:31.540]  and that did that did a lot of good but he kind of trumped me right on for this absolutely all
[2:09:31.540 --> 2:09:38.100]  right and it involves kashoggi so let's just say it's kind of it seems kind of significant doesn't
[2:09:38.100 --> 2:09:42.100]  it all right well i look forward to having you back on with us we'll be right back stay with us
[2:09:42.100 --> 2:09:49.220]  and then we've got in studio savannah hernandez attention attention attention attention to anyone
[2:09:49.220 --> 2:09:54.820]  that still wants to live in a free country the new world order chi-com globalist syndicate
[2:09:54.820 --> 2:09:59.940]  is making its move to implode the dollar and thrust the united states into a civil war
[2:09:59.940 --> 2:10:04.740]  by contesting the election they are openly wargaming this at the highest levels of democratic
[2:10:04.740 --> 2:10:09.940]  party nancy polosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election
[2:10:09.940 --> 2:10:15.940]  trump is going they will hold a separate inauguration for biden and kamala harris and that anyone
[2:10:15.940 --> 2:10:20.500]  challenging that will be called a racist they will then trigger race riots and violence they've
[2:10:20.500 --> 2:10:26.820]  already beta tested around the country we are not living in normal times when these types of things
[2:10:26.820 --> 2:10:31.140]  happen in history people are usually caught flat-footed because they can't believe that they're
[2:10:31.140 --> 2:10:37.300]  living in such a criminal era we are we are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate
[2:10:37.300 --> 2:10:42.500]  that's been feeding on america is being exposed and removed now is the time for all good men and
[2:10:42.500 --> 2:10:47.540]  women to come to their aid of the country spread the word now paul reveres well we're six months
[2:10:47.540 --> 2:10:52.660]  into the covet nineteen lockdown and now democrat leaders are calling for people to be charged for
[2:10:52.660 --> 2:10:57.140]  the attempted murder they don't wear the mask of the symbols of slavery and they've triggered their
[2:10:57.140 --> 2:11:02.820]  race riots around the country led by white angry liberal academics and others and now on top of
[2:11:02.820 --> 2:11:07.460]  the democrats are officially saying hey trump's gonna try to steal the election and contest it
[2:11:07.460 --> 2:11:12.500]  but then their internal wargaming documents come out with john pades at the very top with kamala
[2:11:12.500 --> 2:11:17.780]  harris and of course joe biden and they're saying oh we think we're gonna lose but we're gonna have
[2:11:17.780 --> 2:11:23.380]  the democrat state secede claiming that joe biden has won the popular vote and we are then going to
[2:11:23.380 --> 2:11:28.260]  set up our own country and ask the military to remove trump this is officially in the new york
[2:11:28.260 --> 2:11:32.100]  times and i'll just believe the new york times i've been telling you for over a year this is
[2:11:32.100 --> 2:11:36.740]  their plan from other statements they've made and then planet monthly the washington post the
[2:11:36.740 --> 2:11:41.380]  financial times of london and the council on farm relations this is their plan we've got 80 days
[2:11:41.380 --> 2:11:49.380]  left to stop it what are you gonna do i'm serious folks this is the time to save the country
[2:11:49.620 --> 2:11:53.380]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:03.940 --> 2:12:09.700]  every morning at the mine you could see him arrive he stood six foot six and waited 245 kind
[2:12:09.700 --> 2:12:15.620]  of broad at his shoulder and there at the hip and everybody knew you didn't give no lip to big john
[2:12:17.380 --> 2:12:26.740]  big john big john big john big bad john big bad john all right let's get right into the broadcast
[2:12:28.740 --> 2:12:33.540]  nobody seems to know i had all this big broadcast lined up for you all these guests
[2:12:34.180 --> 2:12:39.060]  all this good news and then millie weaver's calling me while i'm working out at like nine
[2:12:39.060 --> 2:12:44.500]  a.m. they're breaking into my phone i'm being followed all this stuff's going on and i'm just like
[2:12:47.940 --> 2:12:51.460]  she's like you know have the producer call me back get me on and i've got
[2:12:52.740 --> 2:12:57.460]  this guest in town patrick burgey and you and i'm like okay okay and then all of a sudden i'll
[2:12:57.460 --> 2:13:01.380]  walk in here about through the show they're like there's there's the video she's been arrested
[2:13:01.380 --> 2:13:09.620]  and they came to her house and it's just insane i know this the nsa the globalist hillary their
[2:13:09.620 --> 2:13:14.660]  computers all said she was going to win they lost and so they talk about the power of their
[2:13:14.660 --> 2:13:21.540]  psyops and the power of their propaganda that worked back when the public still believed their
[2:13:21.540 --> 2:13:25.140]  lies it doesn't work like it used to i mean there's a certain demographic of people
[2:13:26.260 --> 2:13:29.620]  black white old young that are dumb that'll believe anything and have no memory but
[2:13:29.620 --> 2:13:36.100]  but it's working less and less and so people close to it think it's this incredibly monolithic
[2:13:36.100 --> 2:13:41.060]  power let me tell you what trumps all that fancy propaganda and all the little flashing lights and
[2:13:41.060 --> 2:13:49.140]  all the little fake you know sock puppets and everything is the truth so they can shadow ban
[2:13:49.140 --> 2:13:53.380]  everybody and they can censor you all day but if you know the truth and you live your life right
[2:13:53.380 --> 2:14:01.140]  and you love god and you build a better society these new world order sociopaths can't win because
[2:14:01.140 --> 2:14:05.220]  all they look at is their own personal power their own personal gain and they lose their own power
[2:14:05.220 --> 2:14:13.940]  their own gain because they don't get everything's interconnected you know i went back during the
[2:14:13.940 --> 2:14:17.860]  break to get a cup of coffee and i was watching fox news just for a minute while i was getting
[2:14:17.860 --> 2:14:25.540]  coffee and it was well now with the worsening cases and we've got to have stimulus too and you know
[2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:32.340]  because the country is devastated by covid and the national death rate is now similar to texas
[2:14:33.220 --> 2:14:38.100]  saw the numbers a few days ago it's 0.0035
[2:14:38.100 --> 2:14:45.700]  i mean you got more people dying from
[2:14:48.180 --> 2:14:53.780]  drowning in their pools than this and it's all psyops and it's all lies
[2:14:55.460 --> 2:15:00.740]  and i sit there and i talk to rational smart people who want to elbow bump me when we talk
[2:15:00.740 --> 2:15:10.900]  and i go hey you know this is a lot less more powerful a lot less powerful than the flu they
[2:15:10.900 --> 2:15:15.620]  go well yeah but there's still something scary about the virus because every stroke and every
[2:15:15.620 --> 2:15:21.940]  weird cancer they go oh the person was positive for covid and they had this cancer or they had
[2:15:21.940 --> 2:15:28.020]  epilepsy and they already had epilepsy so i look at that there's like 10 different types of psyops
[2:15:28.020 --> 2:15:34.340]  they do every kid that dies they say had it later it's a bit it's not true every old person that
[2:15:34.340 --> 2:15:39.460]  dies they'll use some celebrity that they claim died of that but it's something else and and
[2:15:39.460 --> 2:15:46.420]  you just see or they go oh i saw it on new york times cnn last night without even looking top story
[2:15:47.860 --> 2:15:56.500]  pandemic in new york rivals the spanish flu rivals in the number of infected not in the dead
[2:15:56.500 --> 2:15:58.820]  spanish flu they think killed 50 million people
[2:16:02.660 --> 2:16:06.980]  what do they claim covid's killed worldwide not even a million people
[2:16:10.180 --> 2:16:15.620]  yeah there it is covid 19 death toll rivals fatality rate 1918 flu that's even more deceptive from
[2:16:15.620 --> 2:16:26.260]  seeing it that 160 000 rivals 50 million what put that back up because they had both out they're like
[2:16:26.260 --> 2:16:32.580]  cases rival and then they're also saying the death toll that is totally lie it's like saying
[2:16:33.860 --> 2:16:38.100]  oh you got 160 000 that rivals 50 million
[2:16:38.100 --> 2:16:48.580]  that's your sophisticated psiopinodontil what it is is people are domesticated and they're weak
[2:16:49.140 --> 2:16:54.260]  and they like getting into oh oh oh my god and then almost every death
[2:16:56.100 --> 2:17:03.540]  is somebody that died in a car wreck of cancer the flu drowning drug overdose
[2:17:03.540 --> 2:17:09.540]  and i sit there and read the obituaries and every time i hear like a seven-year-old died
[2:17:09.540 --> 2:17:13.780]  i go look and they didn't die of it well they got hit by a car but they had covid's that killed
[2:17:14.340 --> 2:17:18.180]  or they fell down in the shower hit their head but they and the people are like oh
[2:17:18.180 --> 2:17:25.540]  chicken wings from brazil test positive uh yeah and soda papayas and so do everything else because
[2:17:25.540 --> 2:17:34.660]  it's a fake test but it's just all a big exercise in hype and emptiness and hysteria because we
[2:17:34.660 --> 2:17:42.340]  don't have god anymore we don't have integrity we don't have empathy we don't have depth it's all
[2:17:42.340 --> 2:17:50.340]  just the laziest shallowest people that are just receiving info they don't have any depth they're
[2:17:50.340 --> 2:17:59.460]  just like minute to minute they just sex coffee oh uh go to sleep go see a movie uh pet my car
[2:17:59.460 --> 2:18:03.780]  and it's not that sex or a movie or a car is bad it's that it ain't god
[2:18:07.700 --> 2:18:12.740]  and you look at people they're so soulless now they're so empty many of them
[2:18:12.740 --> 2:18:21.620]  that you see somebody that's black white brown and they've got a soul and they're electric and
[2:18:21.620 --> 2:18:25.300]  they're there and they're seeing things and they get what you're saying and they're connected to you
[2:18:25.300 --> 2:18:30.980]  and that's how you want to be you don't want to be these lawyers and military people at the top
[2:18:30.980 --> 2:18:37.300]  and these mummies that go and interface with each other and show i'm soulless i'm like a robot and
[2:18:37.300 --> 2:18:42.020]  i'll fit in good with you because we'll screw everybody else so that we have bigger digits in
[2:18:42.020 --> 2:18:44.980]  our bank account and are more powerful than somebody else
[2:18:48.580 --> 2:18:54.100]  and then there's people that are awake but they're still afraid afraid of what they're
[2:18:54.100 --> 2:18:59.460]  going to lose afraid of what somebody's going to say and they're always looking for the establishment
[2:18:59.460 --> 2:19:06.660]  like oh if i could have fox news accept me or cnn oh if i could have the big channel if i could
[2:19:06.660 --> 2:19:12.660]  be interviewed by the big host i'd be credible that's discredited that's over that's gone that's
[2:19:12.660 --> 2:19:23.300]  collapsing so these are all soulless people ladies and gentlemen and you have the soul
[2:19:27.620 --> 2:19:31.940]  you got something deep inside that connects you to reality and so do i and that's what
[2:19:31.940 --> 2:19:37.460]  brings us together and so it is that connection it is that event of consciousness with god
[2:19:37.460 --> 2:19:44.260]  that makes everything else not matter because this planet is a test will we use knowledge
[2:19:44.260 --> 2:19:50.340]  to control and can dominate others or will we use knowledge to empower ourselves and will we
[2:19:50.340 --> 2:19:56.340]  empower others and will we teach people the tricks teach them how to fish don't feed them fish
[2:19:56.340 --> 2:20:04.100]  will we give up our power to gain power for all of us and then we even rise higher
[2:20:04.900 --> 2:20:11.060]  but there's a spirit that doesn't want to teach people how to be powerful because the people
[2:20:11.060 --> 2:20:20.100]  that lead that are not powerful they don't have the promethean fire they've seen the promethean fire
[2:20:20.660 --> 2:20:23.860]  and they want to describe it and they want to build something like it instead of
[2:20:23.860 --> 2:20:32.420]  catching a cell phone fire saying i am the promethean fire i am prometheus i am the fire
[2:20:33.780 --> 2:20:40.820]  of knowledge but you must turn loose like a surfer that's on the wave you're not controlling
[2:20:40.820 --> 2:20:47.220]  the wave you're riding the wave this is knowledge you can really break civilizations down to two
[2:20:47.220 --> 2:20:55.060]  types predatory and non predatory or oppressive conquest based or renaissance based and of
[2:20:55.060 --> 2:21:00.580]  course different types of civilizations and countries and political systems of history
[2:21:00.580 --> 2:21:08.180]  and at the present are mixes of the two but with globalism it is a post human ideology
[2:21:08.900 --> 2:21:16.180]  so it's scientifically geared to be oppressive and the rationale is social Darwinism that the
[2:21:16.180 --> 2:21:21.140]  ruling class are elites and because they're in power they have a right to rule over you
[2:21:21.140 --> 2:21:27.860]  poison you dumb you down sterilize you and kill you so all the people wearing masks like outside
[2:21:27.860 --> 2:21:33.460]  at the park and stuff are living in a total hoax and think their active submission is an
[2:21:33.460 --> 2:21:38.820]  active working for the common good in a collective no it's a sign that you're a slave who will take
[2:21:38.820 --> 2:21:43.700]  the force inoculations federal government and Yale are studying the force inoculations right now
[2:21:43.700 --> 2:21:50.420]  the united nations and the national institutes of health with the cdc are publicly conducting a
[2:21:50.420 --> 2:21:58.580]  4 000 person study spending tens of millions of dollars at Yale on 15 ways to brainwash the public
[2:21:58.580 --> 2:22:03.940]  into taking inoculations basically squeezing you and forcing you to take them through guilt
[2:22:03.940 --> 2:22:08.260]  through fines through not being able to go into stores not be able to get on airplanes or have
[2:22:08.260 --> 2:22:15.060]  jobs this is forced inoculations it's a public gateway pun it wrote about it last week David Knight
[2:22:15.060 --> 2:22:20.260]  wrote about it this week stories up on info wars dot com so people say oh i'll just wear a mask
[2:22:21.060 --> 2:22:27.380]  it's never gonna end that's just the sign of submission fouchy admits that next is the contact
[2:22:27.380 --> 2:22:33.460]  tracing of the apps on your phones and the inoculations that is a dna vaccine that changes
[2:22:33.460 --> 2:22:39.860]  your dna this isn't a science fiction movie it's happening right now compliance is death
[2:22:39.860 --> 2:22:47.380]  compliance is annihilation wake up wake up when the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden
[2:22:47.380 --> 2:22:53.380]  two years ago they knew he had serious cognitive problems he has always been an empty suit that
[2:22:53.380 --> 2:22:59.620]  does what he's told by the globalist and their allied crime syndicates Kamala Harris is even worse
[2:22:59.620 --> 2:23:05.620]  than does whatever she's told she's bought and paid for by silicon valley the chai comms and others
[2:23:05.620 --> 2:23:13.060]  so she has been chosen because she's part african and now anyone that criticizes her will be called
[2:23:13.060 --> 2:23:20.180]  a racist and evil and she is now above reproach ladies and gentlemen we must expose this monster
[2:23:20.180 --> 2:23:25.620]  for who she is we must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three
[2:23:25.620 --> 2:23:32.500]  times longer than white people that the woman is a monster kamala harris will end up being our
[2:23:32.500 --> 2:23:39.300]  president if they're able to steal the election and she is a 110 new world order puppet now more
[2:23:39.300 --> 2:23:48.340]  than ever we must expose this monster we must expose the globalist you're listening to the alex
[2:23:48.340 --> 2:23:59.380]  jones show
[2:24:09.380 --> 2:24:14.500]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m to 3 p.m we're here live i'm your host alex jones then the

[2:24:19.780 --> 2:24:25.620]  day but night there's a kick butt job 8 a.m to 11 a.m central okay i had a lot of positive news
[2:24:25.620 --> 2:24:31.780]  to cover and i've not plugged one time here on the full show that it noon tomorrow at the hill of life
[2:24:32.580 --> 2:24:38.580]  of the 360 in austin texas type in hill of life trail austin texas it's right off spanish trail or
[2:24:38.580 --> 2:24:46.820]  scottish trail and the addresses are on info wars dot com they had closed down more than 10 entrances
[2:24:46.820 --> 2:24:54.100]  to the 98 000 acre giant barton creek city park that the environmentalists stole from private
[2:24:54.100 --> 2:24:59.300]  landowners in 1992 and i always said they're gonna try and around and try to shut it down and build
[2:24:59.300 --> 2:25:03.540]  on it well kirk watson was married at the time they got a couple hundred thousand acres outside of
[2:25:03.540 --> 2:25:10.100]  town also on the same barton creek escarpment and they're now building on that and got rid of it so
[2:25:10.100 --> 2:25:14.260]  that's always been their plan so they stole it from the landowners a lot of times pennies on the
[2:25:14.260 --> 2:25:18.420]  dollar and now they're going to steal it from you and all the world from spain to australia you name
[2:25:18.420 --> 2:25:25.140]  it they're doing the same thing so the actual address is 17 10 camp craft road austin texas but
[2:25:25.140 --> 2:25:31.220]  it's uh comes right off 360 capital texas highway and scottish trail that comes right off 30 can't
[2:25:31.220 --> 2:25:36.260]  miss it you'll see all the cars parked you go up the hill and it's a quarter mile height down the
[2:25:36.260 --> 2:25:44.020]  hill towards the beautiful barton creek greenbelt and barton creek so i am sitting there sunday morning
[2:25:44.020 --> 2:25:48.740]  my wife gets back from hiking with her friend they were thrown out of the park by people saying they're
[2:25:48.740 --> 2:25:55.460]  green police and i go there and the police are already there they call six more police cars and
[2:25:56.020 --> 2:26:00.820]  they're telling people you can't come in it's full covet 19 you didn't sign up
[2:26:00.820 --> 2:26:04.660]  and give us your name and number and driver's license well that's totally illegal it's not an
[2:26:04.660 --> 2:26:08.580]  ordinance i've talked to the cops the cops go yeah there's not an ordinance this is illegal
[2:26:08.580 --> 2:26:13.860]  so they ordered them to stop it and now it stopped as of two days ago all over the city
[2:26:13.860 --> 2:26:19.060]  they're no longer blocking it but they put up fences they use the dumb lifeguards nothing
[2:26:19.060 --> 2:26:22.020]  is lifeguards but you know they're like 20 years old they don't know what they're doing they're ignorant
[2:26:22.020 --> 2:26:27.780]  to do this so i told savannah hernandez uh yesterday morning i said you want to go out and cover this
[2:26:27.780 --> 2:26:32.580]  and see what people think because it all starts at barton springs where the creek ends is another
[2:26:32.580 --> 2:26:38.740]  big spring that comes up out of the ground into the colorado river beautiful world class area
[2:26:38.740 --> 2:26:43.460]  so she goes down there it's all blocked and she spontaneously starts ripping things down
[2:26:44.340 --> 2:26:51.380]  the report is on info wars dot com but what's amazing is that since this went viral a few days
[2:26:51.380 --> 2:26:56.420]  ago there were 10 million views on twitter alone when i went and did it they made fun of us they
[2:26:56.420 --> 2:27:01.140]  attacked us but we've sent our people out everywhere they don't have the monitors there trying to keep
[2:27:01.140 --> 2:27:06.020]  people out of the biggest city park system in the country since van hernandez great job you did it
[2:27:07.060 --> 2:27:12.180]  happily in a fun way much more effective than me i salute you they won't be able to edit this down
[2:27:12.180 --> 2:27:16.420]  to make it look like you were attacking innocent people twitter edited you said i was just randomly
[2:27:16.420 --> 2:27:20.260]  yelling at people for no reason no they were there blocking people getting into the park
[2:27:20.260 --> 2:27:24.500]  criminally in my view yeah and you know elix this is something that they've been doing for the
[2:27:24.500 --> 2:27:29.060]  past couple of months actually barton springs is one of my favorite places to go to here in austin
[2:27:29.060 --> 2:27:32.740]  that's right they were just expanding it now citywide especially in the middle of the summer
[2:27:32.740 --> 2:27:38.580]  because again it gets to over 100 degrees here in texas it's very hot we have a lot of parks with
[2:27:38.580 --> 2:27:43.220]  you know entrances to the river and whatnot so people can go enjoy the outdoors especially amid
[2:27:43.220 --> 2:27:47.700]  a big pandemic where what where's better to be you know other than outside in the direct oh yeah
[2:27:47.700 --> 2:27:52.500]  the virus can't live it's good for vitamin d but the grinch that stole christmas the grinch that
[2:27:52.500 --> 2:27:57.780]  stole austin all the gavin knew some blocking the beaches this is criminal yeah elix and you know what
[2:27:57.780 --> 2:28:01.700]  that's why i finally got so tired of it too and i went there with the intention of just
[2:28:01.700 --> 2:28:05.540]  probably seeing some uh security guards there because i've gone there previously and they
[2:28:05.540 --> 2:28:10.100]  told me that they were gonna find me a thousand dollars if i went in there and that was probably
[2:28:10.100 --> 2:28:13.780]  one or two months ago i haven't been back since and you were like hey go see if there's people
[2:28:13.780 --> 2:28:18.340]  out front there wasn't but i started seeing people walk up to this fence and say oh well
[2:28:18.340 --> 2:28:23.220]  it's close i can't go in and i said uh yeah you can so i ripped it down because i'm so
[2:28:23.220 --> 2:28:28.180]  tired of people seeing this little orange netting and then thinking that they can't go into a public
[2:28:28.180 --> 2:28:32.980]  park into nature for their own health it's ridiculous and and you know that's the barrier
[2:28:32.980 --> 2:28:38.260]  it's an orange net and if you and they're telling you you're non-essential your scum again austin
[2:28:38.260 --> 2:28:41.700]  has the biggest park system in the country it's only thing that makes the town good because the
[2:28:41.700 --> 2:28:47.780]  leftist here have ruined it and to watch as soon as you turn the fences down they just pour in
[2:28:47.780 --> 2:28:52.420]  exactly and that's what people need is that push they just need one person to lead them
[2:28:52.420 --> 2:28:57.700]  and you know i always say apply the same exact mentality to face masks because if one person
[2:28:57.700 --> 2:29:02.340]  stops wearing a face mask i do this all the time in my local heb other people see you and they start
[2:29:02.340 --> 2:29:08.180]  taking off and now biden and kamala slave owner harris they are saying you will wear it and now
[2:29:08.180 --> 2:29:12.900]  democrats are making their employees in zoom meetings wear it talk about their houses their
[2:29:12.900 --> 2:29:17.620]  literal purchase and that's what i'm saying alex at this point this isn't about common sense and
[2:29:17.620 --> 2:29:23.620]  about science anymore we need to exercise common sense this is nature it's it's an open park well
[2:29:23.620 --> 2:29:28.500]  savannah you're the real wonder woman you're the real wonder woman i mean thank you alex just so
[2:29:28.500 --> 2:29:35.460]  sweet no i'm not i'm not sweet i literally got up early this morning saw this video and just you
[2:29:35.460 --> 2:29:40.660]  you took years off you added years to my life i mean this this is if everybody starts acting
[2:29:40.660 --> 2:29:46.980]  like this we're gonna win i mean i'm absolutely just you know great job thank you and of course
[2:29:47.620 --> 2:29:52.740]  harris and smith are the great job running camera he did and more importantly i just hope
[2:29:52.740 --> 2:29:57.940]  people watch this video and realize that hey i can still go into my public park hey i can go into my
[2:29:57.940 --> 2:30:02.900]  local grocery store without a face mask hey i can live my normal life you know we keep talking about
[2:30:02.900 --> 2:30:06.500]  this new normal and everyone keeps saying oh we're never gonna get back to normal yeah we're not
[2:30:06.500 --> 2:30:10.820]  gonna because bill gates says it never ends we're not gonna this is not meant to ever end unless the
[2:30:10.820 --> 2:30:15.620]  american people fight for their freedom and fight for their rights we're not gonna get but you're
[2:30:15.620 --> 2:30:20.020]  never gonna get back to normal unless you actually take action and again it's all based on lies
[2:30:20.580 --> 2:30:29.220]  nationwide in texas it's 0032 the nationwide it's 0035 and that's with fake numbers it's a hoax
[2:30:29.220 --> 2:30:36.260]  the flu's five times worse now this is total bs man but they focus in on each death or each person
[2:30:36.260 --> 2:30:42.180]  out of 330 million to create this perception exactly alex and people especially mere abler as well
[2:30:42.180 --> 2:30:46.900]  because i'm pretty sure our mass ordinance is supposed to be up on the 15th of this month which
[2:30:46.900 --> 2:30:51.700]  is i believe tomorrow he's gonna extend it he's gonna extend it and why he's already been focusing
[2:30:51.700 --> 2:30:56.820]  on the huge amounts of death here in austin texas our overrun hospitals show me where that is it's
[2:30:56.820 --> 2:31:00.820]  all lies show me where it is because there are not people dying in the streets there are no
[2:31:00.820 --> 2:31:05.140]  overrun hospitals even at the peak of this pandemic in new york we never run out of ventilators those
[2:31:05.140 --> 2:31:10.020]  extra hospitals that they spent millions of dollars to set up never got used they were empty
[2:31:10.020 --> 2:31:15.780]  and that's on wreck and we forget maybe ships never got used either look at this yell professor
[2:31:15.780 --> 2:31:20.580]  in fours dot com hydroxychloroquine haters spilling misleading toxic disinformation says that 100
[2:31:20.580 --> 2:31:27.860]  percent works oh but the un says and it just goes on and on and again biden and kamala seeing you
[2:31:27.860 --> 2:31:33.220]  look look at this covid 19 death toll rival fatality rate during 1918 flu it killed 50 million
[2:31:33.220 --> 2:31:38.900]  this hasn't killed a million worldwide that's a total lie one million doesn't rival 50 millions
[2:31:38.900 --> 2:31:44.100]  of anna exactly people keep trying to make these comparisons and it's all about fear obviously we're
[2:31:44.100 --> 2:31:48.980]  in an election year and they're using this to control people and to embarrass trump in america
[2:31:48.980 --> 2:31:56.180]  look at this exactly france placed on uk travel quarantine list of coronavirus rises again
[2:31:56.180 --> 2:32:00.580]  everyone's placing each other on this divergence signal instead of just saying it's a giant hoax
[2:32:00.580 --> 2:32:06.820]  look at this peak idiocy wisconsin government agency mandates face masks use for virtual
[2:32:06.820 --> 2:32:14.020]  zoom meetings again you're private with a zoom meeting hey you're you're alone in your house
[2:32:14.020 --> 2:32:22.180]  put your damn mask it's a cult man it's a cult god almighty spanna and that's why i want people
[2:32:22.180 --> 2:32:27.380]  to wake up alex because people have so willingly put on this face mask they don't even question
[2:32:27.380 --> 2:32:31.860]  authority anymore they don't question anything they're willingly bowing down to this so when
[2:32:31.860 --> 2:32:36.020]  the vaccine rolls through they're willingly going to take that when they're told that they have to
[2:32:36.020 --> 2:32:40.260]  vote via mail-in ballot they're going to do that sitting down as well so that's all they admit
[2:32:40.260 --> 2:32:44.340]  that's the plan they're not going to fight for their rights and that's what this whole thing has
[2:32:44.340 --> 2:32:50.340]  been it's been a huge example of how many americans are submissive and they're not willing to fight for
[2:32:50.340 --> 2:32:58.420]  their freedoms at all and it's very sad to see so it puts the mask on its skin or to get phase one
[2:32:58.420 --> 2:33:04.340]  again i said alex and yeah that's the thing everyone's acting like there are people lying in
[2:33:04.340 --> 2:33:10.420]  the streets dying and riding oh they love it i'm a hero you're not a hero that's again none of it's
[2:33:10.420 --> 2:33:14.900]  happening so go to your nature park go out and live your normal life you can do that today but you

[2:36:52.340 --> 2:36:56.980]  year i've pointed out statements out of the council on foreign relations and other globalist
[2:36:56.980 --> 2:37:03.140]  organs that they know trump is going to win in a landslide so their strategy will be to contest
[2:37:03.140 --> 2:37:09.060]  the election if they fail to successfully steal it then they are openly now wargaming this is in
[2:37:09.060 --> 2:37:14.660]  the new york times having democrat states and cities secede from the union just like they've
[2:37:14.660 --> 2:37:19.940]  ignored trump's policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down that is nothing but a
[2:37:19.940 --> 2:37:24.820]  dress rehearsal they are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration not in dc
[2:37:24.820 --> 2:37:32.020]  they said in another city colosia said this when they crown biden and kamala harris ladies and
[2:37:32.020 --> 2:37:38.660]  gentlemen this is the organized civil war this is their public criminal plan we should be praying
[2:37:38.660 --> 2:37:42.580]  we should be spreading the word we should be demanding trouble in the offense to expose this
[2:37:42.580 --> 2:37:50.100]  criminal activity you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:38:12.580 --> 2:38:22.580]  that
[2:38:22.580 --> 2:38:29.140]  we are back live so that her nanda has knocked out of the park you know i uh was a big fat
[2:38:29.140 --> 2:38:34.580]  ugly sweaty mess when my wife was told she couldn't be at the giant green belt with her friend
[2:38:34.580 --> 2:38:39.700]  sunday so i stomped over there called a camera guy went over there and the media edited it to
[2:38:39.700 --> 2:38:44.820]  say that i just randomly attacked innocent teenagers no they're like hey what are you doing you got it
[2:38:44.820 --> 2:38:51.940]  you got it then like f you just a bunch of surly punks man contact tracing us and say and i watched
[2:38:51.940 --> 2:38:57.780]  them telling families oh you can't go in sorry it's full and i'm okay that's wrong they start
[2:38:57.780 --> 2:39:03.540]  flipping me off the media is like poor innocent children alex jones came and was mean to them
[2:39:03.540 --> 2:39:08.580]  i was surprised they didn't say jones put up a tv screen showed child porn or he sacrificed a baby
[2:39:08.580 --> 2:39:13.940]  then i say the cops they're illegally blocking this it's not a city ordinance they go you're
[2:39:13.940 --> 2:39:18.660]  right the cops say get out of there to the lifeguards make them stop blocking the entrance
[2:39:18.660 --> 2:39:24.900]  to the to the whole canyon area how does the media turn that into a defeat for us it's a huge
[2:39:24.900 --> 2:39:30.740]  victory they just say jones shut up and attack high schoolers but it doesn't matter because
[2:39:30.740 --> 2:39:35.860]  the people know the truth and suddenly we've sent our crew out they don't have the people
[2:39:35.860 --> 2:39:40.820]  blocking the entrances now and folks reportedly are tearing them down everywhere savannah did it
[2:39:40.820 --> 2:39:46.500]  instinctively yesterday so here is her powerful report that i'm begging you it's only got like

[2:40:54.180 --> 2:40:58.580]  alex met viral on twitter because he was at barton springs they wouldn't let him in apparently
[2:40:58.580 --> 2:41:03.300]  you now need a reservation but this is the free side of barton springs there's a pay side and a
[2:41:03.300 --> 2:41:08.340]  free side this is the free side it's just a part of nature just like zilger park it's a big ass
[2:41:08.340 --> 2:41:14.100]  grass field where people can go and this is the free side of barton and you have this this huge

[2:41:44.980 --> 2:41:50.740]  who pay the taxpayers who pay for all of these natural parks should be able to access them so here
[2:41:50.740 --> 2:41:55.860]  we are in barton now and as you guys can see in front of me there's so many people in here why
[2:41:55.860 --> 2:42:02.580]  because nobody cares about these mandates anymore for covid 19 everyone knows it's ridiculous there's
[2:42:02.580 --> 2:42:08.020]  no overrun hospitals here in austin people are not dying in the streets and people should be able
[2:42:08.020 --> 2:42:16.820]  to go outside for their own personal health and experience nature you know guys i've been stuck
[2:42:16.820 --> 2:42:22.340]  inside of my apartment for the past three months because of mere afters full walk down orders and

[2:43:43.220 --> 2:43:47.460]  be healthy everything is a post human future post we must stop and why they did that because
[2:43:47.460 --> 2:43:53.220]  everyone else is doing it and i want us to take this exact same mentality when it comes to face
[2:43:53.220 --> 2:43:57.620]  if everyone stops wearing face masks everyone else is going to stop wearing face mask why because
[2:43:57.620 --> 2:44:02.740]  everyone has the sheep-like mentality that they're going to follow what the masses are doing be be
[2:44:02.740 --> 2:44:05.780]  that domino be the first one that falls because look what happens
[2:44:10.500 --> 2:44:16.500]  glad to see you guys in nature no one gives a damn about these coronavirus orders anymore
[2:44:16.500 --> 2:44:21.860]  let's be honest okay guys so we ripped down a little entrance here in the fence and since then
[2:44:21.860 --> 2:44:25.700]  about 20 people have come through i've kind of been sitting down and asking them like hey why are
[2:44:25.700 --> 2:44:30.500]  you coming in into the park like obviously i opened the fence for them and they're just like uh because
[2:44:30.500 --> 2:44:35.460]  everyone else is doing it but as you guys can see here a lot of people know that in terms of the
[2:44:35.460 --> 2:44:40.020]  healthy precautions of going out in the sun versus staying indoors for the next three months
[2:44:40.020 --> 2:44:43.780]  coming outside a lot better these are the small revolutions we need to be leading in america
[2:44:43.780 --> 2:44:49.940]  they seem small but they have a big impact and look guys we listen to rules i'm all about law and
[2:44:49.940 --> 2:44:56.980]  order but in terms of our government shutting down a nature trail that's ridiculous come on guys
[2:44:56.980 --> 2:45:02.100]  let's use common sense here and i've said this three times already and other small monologues
[2:45:02.100 --> 2:45:06.820]  they've had throughout the day but 100 degree weather middle of texas direct sunlight how is
[2:45:06.820 --> 2:45:11.220]  the virus going to survive in that someone explain it show me the science remember the country that
[2:45:11.220 --> 2:45:21.700]  you live in us i want people to understand something when the government says no we say yes we the
[2:45:21.700 --> 2:45:28.100]  american people go into nature and we live our normal lives math free all right guys we've done
[2:45:28.100 --> 2:45:33.860]  our civil service for today and uh come to barn springs because it's open and i was going to think
[2:45:33.860 --> 2:45:44.260]  about heaven all right that's the latest at action seven news and resistance to tyrants is obedience
[2:45:44.260 --> 2:45:50.660]  to god this is all a unmandated system and if we grovel they'll push it all the way like they did
[2:45:50.660 --> 2:45:56.500]  in australia we're wearing a mask they're beating up and choking women walking their dog this is a
[2:45:56.500 --> 2:46:02.660]  power grab folks this is a police state the average cop is against it the police state is the edict
[2:46:02.660 --> 2:46:07.220]  from the bureaucrats savannah i completely agree alex and that's why we need to stand up against
[2:46:07.220 --> 2:46:11.140]  this because like you just said you know if you give them an inch they're going to take a mile we've
[2:46:11.140 --> 2:46:15.220]  already seen this in other countries and we've already seen this in other parts of america like
[2:46:15.220 --> 2:46:19.620]  california we've already seen this with the fact that it was 15 days to slow the spread and we're
[2:46:19.620 --> 2:46:25.380]  still in this six months later and everybody needs to join us just type in the hill of life

[2:47:06.660 --> 2:47:12.660]  of a mile we'll get the bottom and then um hiking up's a little bit of a stress so if you're not
[2:47:12.660 --> 2:47:17.220]  into that don't do it but i i chose this place because this is where they tried to block me it's
[2:47:17.220 --> 2:47:21.940]  where the chain reaction happened but savannah it's good news as of yesterday and today they've
[2:47:21.940 --> 2:47:25.940]  pulled all these little punks off these entrances because there's no law they're just doing it
[2:47:25.940 --> 2:47:30.260]  exactly alex and again we just people need that leader they needed you to go out there and show
[2:47:30.260 --> 2:47:34.020]  that they needed you to go out there and say that hey this is an um savannah you did a way better
[2:47:34.020 --> 2:47:40.420]  job than me i hit like a single and i got the first base you like it a grand slam i'm just glad
[2:47:40.420 --> 2:47:44.180]  that we're all out here we're doing it we're bringing light bringing light to this situation and
[2:47:44.180 --> 2:47:47.540]  we're showing people that hey you know it stand up for yourself stand up for your right to go out
[2:47:47.540 --> 2:47:52.420]  in nature because this is unconstitutional and the fact that we all think that it's against the law
[2:47:52.420 --> 2:47:57.060]  to go walk a nature trail is ridiculous yeah you're waking up in a cult and now the democrats
[2:47:57.060 --> 2:48:02.260]  are officially saying wear mask in your house at all times the un's gonna take your kids and
[2:48:02.900 --> 2:48:07.140]  when you're on video you've got to wear it you may infect someone with a microphone
[2:48:07.140 --> 2:48:11.700]  that's a cult folks they're just seeing if you'll drink the orange kool-aid with a cyanide in it
[2:48:11.700 --> 2:48:15.140]  i hope that everyone listening to us right now at their homes is wearing a face mask so they
[2:48:15.140 --> 2:48:20.100]  don't get infected with our covid ballots imagine if i came on air instead when you watch the show
[2:48:20.100 --> 2:48:24.900]  you must wear a mask you're like this guy's a cult leader i mean i deserve i mean come on people
[2:48:24.900 --> 2:48:30.820]  savannah hernandez all right we got a special guest coming up straight ahead stay with us wow i'm
[2:48:32.820 --> 2:48:40.420]  Nancy Pelosi Eric Holder joe biden hillary clinton and the list goes on from there have all gone
[2:48:40.420 --> 2:48:45.060]  on national tv have all gone on the internet and have been in the pages of the new york times
[2:48:45.060 --> 2:48:50.500]  that their war came in contesting the election when they lose they know there's a landslide
[2:48:50.500 --> 2:48:56.420]  that they're unable to steal it they're planning to contest it and have democrat blue states
[2:48:56.420 --> 2:49:02.420]  secede and hold their own treasonous inauguration for joe biden and the other public kamala harris
[2:49:02.420 --> 2:49:08.180]  this has now been announced and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover to try
[2:49:08.180 --> 2:49:13.860]  to drive trump from office the democratic party the chai comms the deep state are using black
[2:49:13.860 --> 2:49:20.180]  black matter funded by soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their attempts at creating
[2:49:20.180 --> 2:49:26.100]  artificial riots and martial law that you're a racist when in truth an old nazi collaborator
[2:49:26.100 --> 2:49:31.620]  george soros created black black matter along with antifa america's fighting for its life but we will
[2:49:31.620 --> 2:49:38.980]  win the social engineers bet on you not having a memory more than anything and they also bet
[2:49:38.980 --> 2:49:43.380]  is they constantly talk about it in their own words that you will adapt to being a slave that
[2:49:43.380 --> 2:49:49.940]  you will learn incrementally to submit so think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud
[2:49:49.940 --> 2:49:55.060]  remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie they lied about where it came
[2:49:55.060 --> 2:50:00.100]  from they lied about person to person the un covered it all up then exaggerated the death rate
[2:50:00.100 --> 2:50:07.220]  at four percent when it's actually zero point zero three two now and dropping then they set the
[2:50:07.220 --> 2:50:12.260]  test up to count almost all false positives they put the names of people that died of other diseases
[2:50:12.260 --> 2:50:17.060]  in the covet column they only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown now we're six months later
[2:50:17.060 --> 2:50:21.620]  now they say it's permanent you got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and
[2:50:21.620 --> 2:50:25.700]  they're going to track everywhere you go and what you do the global social credit score and the un is
[2:50:25.700 --> 2:50:30.580]  the boss anybody questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job that's called 24
[2:50:30.580 --> 2:50:43.620]  century tyranny that's called world government takeover you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:43.620 --> 2:50:49.380]  three months ago refused fascism called on fellow anarchists impersonating protesters to meet outside
[2:50:49.380 --> 2:50:55.700]  of washington dc's lafayette park they were outraged that president trump would show defiance
[2:50:55.700 --> 2:51:01.380]  against the siege of the white house at the end of may that resulted in more than 60 us secret
[2:51:01.380 --> 2:51:07.700]  service uniform division officers and the torching of the historic st john's episcopal church refuse
[2:51:07.700 --> 2:51:13.460]  fascism had come to celebrate that they have gradually become an agitating tentacle of the
[2:51:13.460 --> 2:51:19.940]  democratic party think about what it's gonna cost to conduct occupy type protests all across the
[2:51:19.940 --> 2:51:25.620]  country and especially in washington dc and let the people who are anguishing right now
[2:51:25.620 --> 2:51:32.820]  about a trump hence administration let all those who are seething with anger and rage who are
[2:51:32.820 --> 2:51:38.340]  starting to organize and think about life under a fascist regime know that they are not alone and
[2:51:38.340 --> 2:51:44.180]  that there actually is a plan and a way to stop this regardless of the fact that they were in
[2:51:44.180 --> 2:51:49.140]  part formed by the revolutionary communist party and let me say one thing to the white people in
[2:51:49.140 --> 2:51:54.900]  the audience now you know bobby has been saying for a long time we will not fight racism with racism
[2:51:54.900 --> 2:51:59.060]  we refuse to stoop to the level of a racist to hate somebody because the color of his skin
[2:51:59.060 --> 2:52:03.380]  well that's fine that's a cop out and if you act like that the black pantheon party will hate you
[2:52:03.380 --> 2:52:07.940]  not because you're white but because you ain't taking care of business to organize other people
[2:52:07.940 --> 2:52:11.940]  teach them the needs to support the black liberation movement led by the black pantheon party
[2:52:11.940 --> 2:52:18.740]  as a strong fearless voice against american imperialism in the studio we have some good
[2:52:18.740 --> 2:52:27.620]  americans carl dicks co-initiator of refuse fascism representative of the revolutionary
[2:52:27.620 --> 2:52:34.020]  communist party how are you sir i'm doing good because when i heard black voices for trump
[2:52:35.780 --> 2:52:41.780]  reminded me of something this is like having jews for adolf hitler back in nazi german
[2:52:41.780 --> 2:52:47.860]  damn and we have known since 2017 that they are indirectly funded by the alliance for global
[2:52:47.860 --> 2:52:54.180]  justice which is listed as an organizer and fiscal sponsor for refuse fascism which is in
[2:52:54.180 --> 2:52:59.860]  turn funded by george soros through the tides foundation as the daily caller reported the
[2:52:59.860 --> 2:53:05.780]  benefactors of the alliance for global justice and refuse fascism are listed online according to
[2:53:05.780 --> 2:53:12.580]  its most recent 990 tax form alliance for global justice received 2.2 million dollars in funding
[2:53:12.580 --> 2:53:18.900]  for the fiscal year ending in march 2016 one of the group's biggest donors is the tides foundation
[2:53:18.900 --> 2:53:23.940]  a nonprofit funded by billionaire progressive philanthropist george soros tides gave the
[2:53:23.940 --> 2:53:29.700]  alliance for global justice 50 000 dollars refuse fascism will be spearheading the left
[2:53:29.700 --> 2:53:34.900]  self-described siege of the white house on september 5th with a nationwide protest claiming
[2:53:34.900 --> 2:53:40.580]  just as the german people could not have stopped their genocidal fascist program without driving
[2:53:40.580 --> 2:53:48.820]  out hitler and the nazi regime we must act with all our resolve to drive this regime a 21st century
[2:53:48.820 --> 2:53:55.220]  fascist regime led by a demented bully with his finger on the nuclear trigger out of power
[2:53:55.220 --> 2:54:00.740]  trump and pence are operating out of hitler's playbook only they have nuclear weapons following
[2:54:00.740 --> 2:54:06.900]  refuse fascism's initial pressure on pennsylvania avenue in the beginning of september will be the
[2:54:06.900 --> 2:54:13.780]  proposed september 17th 50 day occupation of the white house coordinated by ad busters the same
[2:54:13.780 --> 2:54:19.380]  people that organized occupy wall street nine years ago at the time of occupy wall street ad
[2:54:19.380 --> 2:54:26.420]  busters co-founder 78-year-old callie lassens said george soros's ideas are quite good many of them
[2:54:26.420 --> 2:54:32.020]  i wish he would give ad busters some money we sorely need it he said he's never given us a penny
[2:54:32.020 --> 2:54:38.900]  but according to discover the networks dot org between 2001 and 2011 ad busters media foundation
[2:54:38.900 --> 2:54:47.700]  received 309 773 from the tides foundation let us once again summon the sweet revolutionary
[2:54:47.700 --> 2:54:53.300]  non-violence that was our calling card in zakati park in the current atmosphere of violent
[2:54:53.300 --> 2:55:00.340]  destruction where homicide rates are skyrocketing does anybody really think that is a possibility
[2:55:00.340 --> 2:55:06.980]  while the facade of protest cover for a growing wave of organized crime as even far left failure
[2:55:06.980 --> 2:55:12.260]  chicago mayor lori lightfoot just infinitely pointed out telling time magazine when people
[2:55:12.260 --> 2:55:17.060]  showed up on michigan avenue in the downtown area with u-haul trucks and cargo vans and
[2:55:17.060 --> 2:55:21.780]  sophisticated equipment used to cut metal and the methods that were used and how quickly

[2:55:47.140 --> 2:55:53.780]  you hear that that's the march of the united nations and the bill of malinda gage foundation
[2:55:53.780 --> 2:56:00.660]  coming with their battle plan psychological warfare operation with the forced inoculations

[2:56:12.420 --> 2:56:18.020]  not even promising to have a cure to it all they're just inflicting new phobias on everyone

[2:58:20.420 --> 2:58:27.860]  covid but the hand-fisted totalitarian response to covid is literally murdering the state of hawaii
[2:58:27.860 --> 2:58:31.780]  hawaii will be the great victim in the united states of the shutdown well so it's a power grab so
[2:58:31.780 --> 2:58:34.660]  so well talk about your move you got the floor what do you want to talk about it's not gonna ask
[2:58:34.660 --> 2:58:38.820]  you a thousand questions but i mean what how is it so bad you left your beloved state well i left
[2:58:38.820 --> 2:58:43.540]  for two reasons first of all i can't do my job i leave hawaii twice a month to go to the mainland
[2:58:43.540 --> 2:58:48.260]  to work i wanted to raise my children in hawaii hillary clinton said it takes the village tree as
[2:58:48.260 --> 2:58:53.860]  a child and we laughed at her but in fact your village raises your child and i wanted uh my
[2:58:53.860 --> 2:58:58.740]  children to be raised by the community of hawaii it's it's rev live well yeah when hillary she
[2:58:58.740 --> 2:59:03.380]  means the state she means the state that we mean obviously the people do raise yeah you don't raise
[2:59:03.380 --> 2:59:09.540]  your children alone yeah hillary meant the state but i wanted that village the village that raised
[2:59:09.540 --> 2:59:14.420]  me i've been there for 31 years it's where i formed my values my oldest children were had their
[2:59:14.420 --> 2:59:20.340]  values formed we lived in LA for a while we went back and the idea of leaving was it was an impossible
[2:59:20.340 --> 2:59:25.300]  thought that i would ever leave and um but i couldn't do my job you leave hawaii now you're
[2:59:25.300 --> 2:59:30.100]  quarantined for 14 days every time you come back the governor said if you're from a resident you
[2:59:30.100 --> 2:59:35.860]  shouldn't leave who is the governor of hawaii to tell me i shouldn't leave uh my work is on the mainland
[2:59:35.860 --> 2:59:40.900]  i have to go i have to leave but so i thought there's gonna come a time where i can't come back
[2:59:40.900 --> 2:59:46.260]  no man is an island and when they make it a real island then you've got to leave it uh no cases in
[2:59:48.420 --> 2:59:51.860]  some of the islands and the pacific as well but they still lock those down this is a giant
[2:59:51.860 --> 2:59:57.700]  power grab we have no covid deaths we have covid related deaths less than 30 i think it is and um
[2:59:57.700 --> 3:00:03.060]  so less than 30 deaths and you're just into freedom 600 people have died from the flu
[3:00:03.060 --> 3:00:07.460]  in the same period of time in the state of hawaii they're saying that the hospitals thanks to you
[3:00:07.460 --> 3:00:12.260]  alex my little facebook video then you had me on we launched the film your hospital movement
[3:00:12.260 --> 3:00:16.260]  which broke the narrative that our hospitals are being overrun that did happen that don't give us
[3:00:16.260 --> 3:00:20.740]  the credit you know it was already viral the time he came on but yeah you doing that trigger reaction
[3:00:20.740 --> 3:00:24.500]  others it's it's been huge so it's all about the power of the people yeah well that's that your
[3:00:24.500 --> 3:00:28.900]  audience you and you don't have only admirers a lot of this audience are admirers but a lot of them
[3:00:28.900 --> 3:00:33.780]  are inspired and that's what everyone listening and watching needs to do you need to be inspired to
[3:00:33.780 --> 3:00:39.380]  act because they're an audience of activists but but getting back to that i mean i mean
[3:00:39.380 --> 3:00:43.700]  you expose that these are empty fake testing facilities and now it's proven so based on a
[3:00:43.700 --> 3:00:47.140]  whole lie it just keeps rolling though and yeah now they brought the lie back they brought the
[3:00:47.140 --> 3:00:51.380]  lie back again in hawaii that our hospitals are being overrun i just talked to a friend of mine
[3:00:51.380 --> 3:00:55.700]  that worked in e r and said we just told we were going to be furloughed so they just extended the
[3:00:55.700 --> 3:01:01.780]  lockdown the day i closed on my house the day i closed on my house they announced that they
[3:01:01.780 --> 3:01:07.940]  were extending the lockdown until at least september 5th we have over 30 unemployment
[3:01:08.740 --> 3:01:12.660]  we have in kawaii the island of kawaii in one week as many suicides as we had
[3:01:13.620 --> 3:01:18.580]  in the previous year on the island of kawaii we have we had a child as young as eight that
[3:01:18.580 --> 3:01:22.660]  i know of personally that died and my family and friends in my community i know of three
[3:01:23.220 --> 3:01:29.060]  young people who overdosed on opioids this is all it's a scourge in the third world's dying
[3:01:29.060 --> 3:01:33.780]  by the hundreds of thousands right now starvation this is an evil plan obviously the politicians
[3:01:33.780 --> 3:01:38.100]  are dumb but why are they following this evil directive well and that's another thing you
[3:01:38.100 --> 3:01:43.620]  broke that first talking about the coming hunger the famine now that it's happening the mainstream
[3:01:43.620 --> 3:01:49.380]  media doesn't even feel like it's front page news it's going to be on page b17 that we have 10
[3:01:49.380 --> 3:01:55.700]  thousand children a month in sub-saharan africa not waking up because they died in their sleep of
[3:01:55.700 --> 3:02:03.460]  starvation and we talked about this on your show in early march now it's happening and the mainstream
[3:02:03.460 --> 3:02:08.820]  media still is burying the story and i hope the left that lockstep don't cover this enjoy yourself
[3:02:08.820 --> 3:02:12.260]  you're really evil because they this is all a plan they know what they're doing it because it's
[3:02:12.260 --> 3:02:18.020]  not any popular yeah people needed google food insecurity now there's food insecurity in missouri
[3:02:18.020 --> 3:02:24.900]  and massachusetts in hawaii we have lines seven miles long people in their cars lining up waiting
[3:02:24.900 --> 3:02:29.300]  for food they're now having an article right here government is caught all over the country
[3:02:29.300 --> 3:02:34.980]  stockpiling food for a collapse well it's not covid causing the collapse it's the hysteria
[3:02:34.980 --> 3:02:42.020]  causing it they call it code they say covid's causing starvation covid you know the chinese the
[3:02:42.020 --> 3:02:46.980]  greatest famine in modern history it was man off man modern famines have been man made
[3:02:46.980 --> 3:02:52.820]  in china the great famine the communist party kept farmers off their farms 60 million chinese people
[3:02:52.820 --> 3:02:57.540]  starved to death in the great famine it wasn't until the farmers began to bribe the government
[3:02:57.540 --> 3:03:02.420]  officials to let them back on their farms that that famine was broke um they did a great leap
[3:03:02.420 --> 3:03:06.740]  forward cultural revolution and killed tens of millions of people and now we have that right we
[3:03:06.740 --> 3:03:10.980]  have a cultural revolution we're doxing and destroying people and just like the cultural
[3:03:10.980 --> 3:03:16.260]  revolution they pull people on stage the whole village would gather around and berate them insult
[3:03:16.260 --> 3:03:22.100]  them now it's happening on social media now we have farmers driven off their farms people they're
[3:03:22.100 --> 3:03:26.420]  shaming this is here's the thing people think minute to minute we have no attention span
[3:03:26.420 --> 3:03:30.740]  this is the takedown global depression and by the time the public figures it out with food lines
[3:03:30.740 --> 3:03:35.540]  five miles long and Dallas it's going to be hell on earth and they think we won't know to blame those
[3:03:35.540 --> 3:03:42.420]  that did the covid hoax but they will be blamed yeah well i think most revolutions fail and uh
[3:03:42.420 --> 3:03:46.900]  they they need to fail no i agree because you're right this is a globalist revolution against
[3:03:46.900 --> 3:03:51.220]  freedom yeah and and i agree with you but they need to pay bill gates and others are behind this
[3:03:51.220 --> 3:03:55.380]  they need to pay for what they've done no i'm with you there there needs if we start saying
[3:03:56.420 --> 3:04:01.700]  make the people that cause the global famine pay the ho the covid hoax pay they might back off but
[3:04:01.700 --> 3:04:06.340]  we don't have much time no and that's what i really want to document i want to document the the the
[3:04:07.380 --> 3:04:13.380]  consequences of the shutdown around the world you know i i emailed your producer last night

[3:06:22.580 --> 3:06:26.900]  grandparents our grandparents did not have this kind of evidence of the nazi holocaust until
[3:06:26.900 --> 3:06:33.380]  after the war was over after the holocaust was over the kind of evidence we have now is unbelievable
[3:06:33.380 --> 3:06:39.220]  in the media it's worse you know if the new york times does cover it but they bury it who sits
[3:06:39.220 --> 3:06:44.260]  there in an editorial meeting and says attention attention attention to anyone that still wants
[3:06:44.260 --> 3:06:50.340]  to live in a free country the new world order chi com globalist syndicate is making its move to
[3:06:50.340 --> 3:06:56.020]  implode the dollar and thrust the united states into a civil war by contesting the election
[3:06:56.020 --> 3:06:59.780]  they are openly working in this at the highest levels of democratic party
[3:06:59.780 --> 3:07:04.260]  nancy polosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election
[3:07:04.260 --> 3:07:10.340]  trump is going they will hold a separate inauguration for biden and kamala harris and that anyone
[3:07:10.340 --> 3:07:14.900]  challenging that will be called a racist they will then trigger race riots and violence they've
[3:07:14.900 --> 3:07:20.980]  already beta tested around the country we are not living in normal times when these types of
[3:07:20.980 --> 3:07:25.300]  things happen in history people are usually caught flat-footed because they can't believe
[3:07:25.300 --> 3:07:30.660]  that they're living in such a criminal era we are we are living in the period where this criminal
[3:07:30.660 --> 3:07:35.940]  globalist syndicate has been feeding on america is being exposed and removed now is the time for
[3:07:35.940 --> 3:07:41.060]  all good men and women to come to their aid of the country spread the word now paul reveres well
[3:07:41.060 --> 3:07:46.500]  we're six months into the covet nineteen lockdown and now democrat leaders are calling for people
[3:07:46.500 --> 3:07:50.660]  to be charged for the attempted murder if they don't wear the mask of the symbols of slavery
[3:07:50.660 --> 3:07:55.860]  and they've triggered their race riots around the country led by white angry liberal academics and
[3:07:55.860 --> 3:08:00.500]  others and now on top of the democrats are officially saying hey trump's gonna try to steal
[3:08:00.500 --> 3:08:04.500]  the election and contest it but then their internal war gaming documents come out
[3:08:04.500 --> 3:08:09.700]  with john pades at the very top with kamala harris and of course joe biden and they're saying
[3:08:09.700 --> 3:08:14.580]  oh we think we're gonna lose but we're gonna have the democrat state secede claiming that joe
[3:08:14.580 --> 3:08:19.860]  biden's won the popular vote and we are then going to set up our own country and ask the military
[3:08:19.860 --> 3:08:24.580]  to remove trump this is officially in the new york times i don't just believe the new york times
[3:08:24.580 --> 3:08:28.500]  i've been telling you for over a year this is their plan from other statements they've made
[3:08:28.500 --> 3:08:33.300]  in the Atlantic monthly the washington post the financial times of london the council and farm
[3:08:33.300 --> 3:08:38.260]  relations this is their plan we've got 80 days left to stop it what are you gonna do i'm serious
[3:08:38.260 --> 3:08:54.180]  folks this is the time to save the country you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:54.180 --> 3:09:10.420]  you're listening to an infowars dot com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[3:09:10.420 --> 3:09:17.060]  you are the resistance all right filmmaker jason jones the great guys here brothers he has escaped
[3:09:17.060 --> 3:09:27.060]  the island fortress of hawaii and he is here with us in austin texas he's moved to new bronfills
[3:09:27.060 --> 3:09:30.980]  just south of here beautiful area if i was gonna leave austin i'd go there actually secretly bought
[3:09:30.980 --> 3:09:35.700]  a little farm actually right by new bronfills just east of there and that's just not a secret anymore
[3:09:35.700 --> 3:09:41.140]  but uh so a lot of folks from hawaii are fleeing there yeah we have friends actually that have
[3:09:41.140 --> 3:09:45.620]  been there for a while and more they're planning on coming in fact one of my good friends from
[3:09:45.620 --> 3:09:50.180]  chicago is thinking of coming a buddy of mine who's a big stuntman stunt coordinator in hollywood
[3:09:50.180 --> 3:09:54.820]  is now looking at new bronfills uh joe rogan is uh i'm going to say worry he's moving but it is
[3:09:54.820 --> 3:09:59.380]  central texas the big the big secret you know they're saying is it dallas is it austin is it
[3:09:59.380 --> 3:10:02.740]  houston let's just say it's deep in the heart of texas why do you think you know a lot of
[3:10:02.740 --> 3:10:08.580]  folks in california why why is everybody fleeing here you think well freedom i can tell you i do
[3:10:08.580 --> 3:10:12.820]  not realize how oppressive the lockdown was in hawaii because you kind of do get used to things
[3:10:12.820 --> 3:10:17.620]  human beings can become used to anything and so even though we were resisting all the the mask
[3:10:17.620 --> 3:10:25.540]  orders and the social distancing and and the lockdowns when we got here it was just kind of it
[3:10:25.540 --> 3:10:29.780]  feels like what it used to be like except people have masks especially the closer you get this
[3:10:29.780 --> 3:10:34.100]  to austin i notice people are wearing masks oh they do it as a symbol of their other subservience
[3:10:34.100 --> 3:10:38.660]  yeah yeah and that's the thing these blue states what won't they do in hawaii you can surf and you
[3:10:38.660 --> 3:10:43.220]  can fish and the reason why they said you can do those things that's so generous of them is they
[3:10:43.220 --> 3:10:47.460]  know that that would be a line that they cannot cross it's a cultural thing it's a couple people
[3:10:47.460 --> 3:10:52.580]  are going to do that so what they will do is they will stop you from doing anything that they think
[3:10:52.580 --> 3:10:57.780]  that you will go along it's all that's key it's all a test because i just went out and protested
[3:10:57.780 --> 3:11:02.820]  them walking all the giant parks down here and they stopped at the next day i mean just a little
[3:11:02.820 --> 3:11:07.540]  bit of resistance they were just waiting to see what we do they can't believe we bow down like this
[3:11:07.540 --> 3:11:10.900]  well when i was arrested that you're going to find this interesting when i was arrested and made
[3:11:10.900 --> 3:11:17.300]  the front page of the uh honolou star advertiser there was handcuff they never even filed charges
[3:11:17.300 --> 3:11:22.100]  against me i received letters from the mayor the governor the attorney general uh effectively
[3:11:22.100 --> 3:11:27.700]  apologizing and i received my money back for my bail i assumed that the other folks that were
[3:11:27.700 --> 3:11:33.220]  arrested along with me that included a samoan chief a woman running for office i thought they
[3:11:33.220 --> 3:11:37.700]  would i thought that they didn't file charges against any of us i i found out just now because
[3:11:37.700 --> 3:11:41.380]  i called my lawyer just to get a follow just to let him know it's gonna be on the air if he any
[3:11:41.380 --> 3:11:46.260]  updates he thought there were still charges filed against me because all of his other clients
[3:11:46.820 --> 3:11:51.780]  they actually filed the charges they never even filed my charges because you had a voice they were
[3:11:51.780 --> 3:11:57.060]  afraid but they targeted those they thought didn't they're bullies god almighty they're bullies can
[3:11:57.060 --> 3:12:02.900]  you believe that so i'm shocked to find out that a woman who was was running for elected office
[3:12:02.900 --> 3:12:07.940]  a samoan chief who had to beg to be arrested by the way when he saw me getting arrested
[3:12:08.900 --> 3:12:12.820]  he was like please arrest me arrest me too i'm doing exactly what he's doing the police did not
[3:12:12.820 --> 3:12:16.180]  want to arrest him because it didn't fit the narrative because they were trying to create
[3:12:16.180 --> 3:12:23.780]  racial division so they arrested the samoan chief but without the cameras around and uh but but i guess
[3:12:23.780 --> 3:12:30.260]  they want to prove a point they did those charges were filed against unbelievable so it's all i mean
[3:12:30.260 --> 3:12:34.580]  austria they are choking women that come out with mask on you can't even leave your house
[3:12:34.580 --> 3:12:40.020]  six weeks can't leave house i mean this is cult level control and nothing against australians
[3:12:40.020 --> 3:12:44.660]  they're great people but they've never ended being a prison colony they're a prison colony
[3:12:44.660 --> 3:12:50.180]  so it's just right back to martial law yeah no it is shocking and you know in my book the
[3:12:50.180 --> 3:12:54.580]  race to save our century i talked about the five principles that we can use to break the back of
[3:12:54.580 --> 3:12:59.540]  tyranny to me one of the most important one is subsidiarity which is keep power local think
[3:12:59.540 --> 3:13:05.220]  local act local exactly you want local power you've been talking about the prison planet
[3:13:05.220 --> 3:13:11.060]  forever sounds crazy do we not live in a prison planet now you literally the rockerfeller foundation
[3:13:11.060 --> 3:13:18.340]  calls it a planetary prison that are out here the report well right now people are under house
[3:13:18.340 --> 3:13:25.380]  arrest in every corner of the country in hawaii you know when i was uh that's the rockerfeller
[3:13:25.380 --> 3:13:29.780]  report they call it a planetary prison no wait here's is this where you got the ten years ago
[3:13:29.780 --> 3:13:34.100]  you know i keep going i'm interrupting so no but i mean they say they're doing this it's like it's
[3:13:34.100 --> 3:13:39.940]  not even debatable no when i when i went to get tested in early march for covid when i was with
[3:13:39.940 --> 3:13:46.180]  somebody who was tested positive and they refused to test me there was an elderly woman who was sick
[3:13:46.820 --> 3:13:50.580]  they refused to test her and they just said go home and quarantine yourself for 14 days don't
[3:13:50.580 --> 3:13:55.540]  leave the house that's their answer and we now know they just false positive everybody yeah yeah
[3:13:55.540 --> 3:14:00.340]  people who went in line signed up to get tested that didn't get tested are getting in the mail
[3:14:00.340 --> 3:14:05.060]  that you're positive and they and they never even were tested so what is the it's the breaking of
[3:14:05.060 --> 3:14:09.060]  the social contract the corporations and other people have just decided to be criminals it's
[3:14:09.060 --> 3:14:14.260]  just evil i mean what do you do when they're just evil running rampant yeah i think that most of
[3:14:14.260 --> 3:14:21.140]  them are just afraid they have no trust in their own mind and you you know you talk about it's people
[3:14:21.140 --> 3:14:24.660]  from the left and the right that are resisting well that's it people are just turning their will
[3:14:24.660 --> 3:14:29.380]  over sorry go ahead well there's people that are resisting are across the ideological spectrum
[3:14:29.380 --> 3:14:33.700]  there's just certain people that are think for themselves they might be bernie bros they might
[3:14:33.700 --> 3:14:38.740]  be libertarians they might be maga people but there's a certain i call them the beautiful people
[3:14:38.740 --> 3:14:43.380]  who think for themselves who don't like seeing other people oppressed that don't side with the bully
[3:14:43.380 --> 3:14:48.020]  then there are the other there's another type of person who they're always going to side with the
[3:14:48.020 --> 3:14:52.660]  bully they're always going to side with the the group that they think is it's like women's that
[3:14:52.660 --> 3:14:57.460]  want the bad boy that beats them up i'm putting women down but there's that certain certain demographic
[3:14:57.460 --> 3:15:02.020]  i think they're just afraid they want to be eaten last by the crocodile so they're going to stand
[3:15:02.020 --> 3:15:06.580]  next to the crocodile and hope that they don't get eaten um where i think what we should do is
[3:15:06.580 --> 3:15:09.700]  always stand when i think it's just kind of cool the crocodile comes over to you and you've been a
[3:15:09.700 --> 3:15:16.420]  big rock and kill it hit into the head well you know the reason why i did that protest in early
[3:15:16.420 --> 3:15:21.300]  march against the lockdown was because my fear of famine in the world and i knew that if we didn't
[3:15:21.300 --> 3:15:27.300]  break this lockdown uh narrative if we didn't break this global lockdown we would see children
[3:15:27.300 --> 3:15:32.020]  starving from bangladesh to and now it's happening and now it's happening and it's happening because
[3:15:32.020 --> 3:15:37.380]  we're virtue signaling with their masks it's happening because uh we feel like we're good
[3:15:37.380 --> 3:15:42.180]  and we're noble people because we social distance no we need to be on our farms do you know what was
[3:15:42.180 --> 3:15:47.780]  really shocking to me is if we don't produce they die that's right indeed which group of business
[3:15:47.780 --> 3:15:53.380]  owners was most stigmatized for trying to stay open food processing plant they were the remember
[3:15:53.380 --> 3:15:58.820]  it was the news was like oh we gotta test them oh somebody was pa oh it's bad oh the chicken wings
[3:15:58.820 --> 3:16:05.380]  have it oh oh the food's bad don't make and they finally discovered that we exploit migrant labor
[3:16:05.380 --> 3:16:10.580]  in these camps like i one of my biggest reasons for border security is because of my concerns for
[3:16:10.580 --> 3:16:14.340]  vulnerable migrants that we you know they want to open border to exploit them they want open
[3:16:14.340 --> 3:16:19.700]  borders so we have an underground economy with millions and millions of people that we can exploit
[3:16:19.700 --> 3:16:24.580]  so it was when the the food processing plants are staying open the media for the first time ever
[3:16:24.580 --> 3:16:31.060]  discovered that we have a system of exploitation of vulnerable migrant workers which we know this
[3:16:31.060 --> 3:16:35.060]  and that's what we need to secure the border have e-verify so that everyone working in this
[3:16:35.060 --> 3:16:40.340]  country has the same architecture of legal protection as the next person um the democrats
[3:16:40.340 --> 3:16:44.740]  admit they want that underground slave economy they need it don't they because you can't have
[3:16:44.740 --> 3:16:49.620]  this you can't have a culture of an economy of granting favors to people to vote for you
[3:16:50.260 --> 3:16:55.140]  if you don't if they have autonomy yeah you need them as a slave yeah and you need and you need
[3:16:55.140 --> 3:16:58.900]  the economy needs to rest on people that are underneath that architecture of protection
[3:16:58.900 --> 3:17:04.660]  and that's why the border security of this forest border is so important to them you know
[3:17:04.660 --> 3:17:09.620]  biden they need biden needs to win it all falls down uh because this this is our launderer the
[3:17:09.620 --> 3:17:15.140]  drug money they're launderer the sex uh captives it's they're they're using it for the slave labor
[3:17:15.140 --> 3:17:19.700]  the sweatshops the the picking the fruit everything yeah no if biden wins this is the best news for
[3:17:19.700 --> 3:17:25.060]  the coyotes because the coyotes will be back in business they'll stay in business yeah we
[3:17:25.060 --> 3:17:30.820]  need to secure the border jason jones stay there you're on fire we'll talk about it all coming up
[3:17:30.820 --> 3:17:36.900]  and then the war room straight ahead with elin shroyer info wars dot com tomorrow's news today

[3:18:30.900 --> 3:18:35.460]  good to stock up but whatever you do keep spreading the word about info wars making you are the modern
[3:18:35.460 --> 3:18:41.140]  voice you are paul revere and i salute you and thank you the new world order is a planetary
[3:18:41.140 --> 3:18:49.220]  corporate plan for world government but world government is only the control grid now inner
[3:18:49.220 --> 3:18:55.380]  members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality
[3:18:55.380 --> 3:19:01.860]  but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms
[3:19:02.420 --> 3:19:08.420]  that's why they say carbon is bad they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet
[3:19:08.420 --> 3:19:14.660]  they are playing god they believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities
[3:19:14.660 --> 3:19:20.980]  that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation i know this sounds
[3:19:20.980 --> 3:19:28.820]  insane but if you read the writings of the globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have
[3:19:28.820 --> 3:19:35.940]  been given the information to say no to this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it
[3:19:35.940 --> 3:19:42.420]  this is the alien takeover of earth when the corrupt establishment began pushing joe biden
[3:19:42.420 --> 3:19:48.340]  two years ago they knew he had serious cognitive problems he has always been an empty suit that
[3:19:48.340 --> 3:19:54.260]  does what he's told by the globalist and their allied crime syndicates kamala harris is even
[3:19:54.260 --> 3:19:59.860]  worse than does whatever she's told she's bought and paid for by silicon valley the chai comms and
[3:19:59.860 --> 3:20:07.540]  others so she has been chosen because she's part african and now anyone that criticizes her will
[3:20:07.540 --> 3:20:14.420]  be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach ladies and gentlemen we must expose this
[3:20:14.420 --> 3:20:20.340]  monster for who she is we must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people
[3:20:20.340 --> 3:20:26.900]  three times longer than white people and that the woman is a monster kamala harris will end up
[3:20:26.900 --> 3:20:33.860]  being our president if they're able to steal the election and she is a 110 new world order puppet
[3:20:33.860 --> 3:20:37.940]  now more than ever we must expose this monster we must expose the globalist
[3:20:42.180 --> 3:20:55.940]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:55.940 --> 3:21:04.580]  crashing through the lies and disinformation we now take you live to the central texas
[3:21:04.580 --> 3:21:12.740]  command center and the heart of the resistance it's alex jones so my job is a lot easier now
[3:21:13.940 --> 3:21:18.900]  world government state knows microchipping force inoculations is out in the open
[3:21:19.620 --> 3:21:24.980]  and our job's a lot easier i went down last sunday and protested them set up checkpoints in front of
[3:21:24.980 --> 3:21:32.820]  the 98 000 square 98 000 acre park and the media took out a context attacked me but they pulled
[3:21:33.460 --> 3:21:37.780]  the people off those and the folks are now in the park which is not about alex jones is some great
[3:21:37.780 --> 3:21:43.060]  hero it just took like blowing on the house like the wolf says the whole thing goes down because
[3:21:43.060 --> 3:21:48.100]  it's built out of straw we have to go out we have to stop wearing the mask we have to start
[3:21:48.100 --> 3:21:53.540]  exposing the hoax and speaking out and not complying that's how it falls our acquiescence
[3:21:53.540 --> 3:21:59.860]  only begs for more control so filmmaker who's here with us with the website thegreatcampaign.org
[3:21:59.860 --> 3:22:04.580]  is jason jones jason jones this period in history you're a christian i'm a christian
[3:22:06.580 --> 3:22:10.980]  everybody i know that's not even been religious or christian or spiritual is now getting it's
[3:22:10.980 --> 3:22:15.380]  good versus evil what's happening right now you know we've seen this we saw it in in france
[3:22:16.180 --> 3:22:22.740]  and the in the late 18th century we saw it in in in russia and in 1917 we saw it in the fall of
[3:22:22.740 --> 3:22:28.340]  the weimer republic and i see this as a global french revolution or a global bolshevik revolution
[3:22:28.340 --> 3:22:32.900]  the global collapse preach brother tell them what's happening global collapse of the weimer republic
[3:22:32.900 --> 3:22:37.140]  you know conservative i'm a conservative but what is what are we trying to conserve the real
[3:22:37.140 --> 3:22:42.980]  word what we're trying to conserve is liberalism liberalism traditionally understood in the english
[3:22:42.980 --> 3:22:48.900]  speaking world is freedom of speech the right to private property religious pluralism in society
[3:22:48.900 --> 3:22:53.780]  right to mobility yeah the right to mobility the second the right to defend yourself this goes back
[3:22:53.780 --> 3:22:59.060]  to the glorious revolution 1688 1689 the english bill of rights that's where the founding fathers
[3:22:59.060 --> 3:23:03.780]  appealed to is something that was ancient and historic going back even further to the magnacarta
[3:23:03.780 --> 3:23:10.740]  magnacarta so what we have in the english speaking world is the new normal the rest of the world is
[3:23:10.740 --> 3:23:14.820]  the normal the normal is you don't have the right to say what you never leave the village
[3:23:14.820 --> 3:23:19.540]  you're born in unless you join the communist party yeah now we you know you can't leave your house so
[3:23:19.540 --> 3:23:25.300]  this is not it can feel like it's unprecedented and is unprecedented in the global scale but we're
[3:23:25.300 --> 3:23:29.620]  losing the fact that we were the new normal as you're saying we're losing our specialness right
[3:23:29.620 --> 3:23:36.100]  now yeah we need to preserve our republic because the fate of the world depends upon it and the
[3:23:36.100 --> 3:23:42.180]  folks that are suffering most from this it's not us it's the children in sub-saharan africa who are
[3:23:42.180 --> 3:23:47.300]  now starving to death it's the children bangladesh who are not who are now starving to death it's
[3:23:47.300 --> 3:23:53.700]  the children in yemen and so when you'd say hey i'm not i'm going to work i'm not wearing that mask
[3:23:53.700 --> 3:23:57.940]  i'm going to the park you're saving probably 10 kids and we're not just saying that yeah when we
[3:23:57.940 --> 3:24:03.060]  collapse they die that's right so if everyone listening to this said i'm not going to i'm going
[3:24:03.060 --> 3:24:09.540]  to so you know i'm going to resist we would be free tomorrow if everyone listening to this
[3:24:09.540 --> 3:24:15.060]  said i will not comply well why do you think it was so easy that i just went down and protested
[3:24:15.060 --> 3:24:19.540]  because it was illegal they had college kids down there blocking people to this giant park it was
[3:24:19.540 --> 3:24:24.180]  all illegal the cops said it's illegal stop it it all ended and then they made fun of me national
[3:24:24.180 --> 3:24:28.900]  news but it had instant effect right and here's what people need to know that the thousand year
[3:24:28.900 --> 3:24:37.540]  rike lasted 13 years right so you may suffer for 10 years 11 years 12 years but but history
[3:24:37.540 --> 3:24:41.700]  will judge us so these delusional tyrannies fall very quick yeah these delusional tyrannies fall
[3:24:41.700 --> 3:24:47.780]  very quick and so we should we should have no fear to stand with the truth stand with the vulnerable
[3:24:47.780 --> 3:24:53.220]  stand for freedom and when you went to that park i watched that video that was their worst nightmare
[3:24:53.220 --> 3:24:58.900]  seeing you come by when i was arrested you know the police were not happy with me and i overreacted
[3:24:58.900 --> 3:25:03.060]  i was angry with adrenaline kicks yeah the adrenaline kicks in but they're saying you can't
[3:25:03.060 --> 3:25:07.620]  be outside i mean that's three weeks later yet again you do a military operation on my wife
[3:25:07.620 --> 3:25:12.900]  and my children and my friends three weeks later the police they were in line where they were told
[3:25:12.900 --> 3:25:18.100]  to be in the sheriffs one by one they came up to me at the event thanked me for being there and said
[3:25:18.100 --> 3:25:25.300]  keep it up and so what happens is um the people that you challenge it in cause of debate and then
[3:25:25.300 --> 3:25:29.940]  what happens is the police officers google you then they google what's going on and they google food
[3:25:29.940 --> 3:25:34.100]  in security and they see oh my gosh people are starving around the world they said it on alex
[3:25:34.100 --> 3:25:38.660]  jones in early march and we thought they were crazy what is a lockdown and they don't want to be a
[3:25:38.660 --> 3:25:42.500]  party to that evil they don't most people are beautiful and good and kind and the reason why
[3:25:42.500 --> 3:25:47.300]  people wear masks is why i wear this this is a scapular it's a catholic's thing it's a sign of
[3:25:47.300 --> 3:25:52.020]  piety it's a sign of belonging to a community most people they wear those masks is almost a
[3:25:52.020 --> 3:25:55.620]  religious symbol saying i care about you and i want to be a good member of the community
[3:25:55.620 --> 3:26:02.020]  but the truth is they're using the social contract against us it's not a real social contract
[3:26:02.020 --> 3:26:05.540]  exactly they think they're being a hero they're not they're buying into a lie that's their trick
[3:26:05.540 --> 3:26:11.460]  how do you defeat that you know i think we have to be courageous and patient and prayerful and
[3:26:12.260 --> 3:26:17.060]  we know more and more people are beginning to understand when i left hawai and then the next
[3:26:17.060 --> 3:26:20.900]  day it was in the news that they the governor lieutenant governor leaked that they were going
[3:26:20.900 --> 3:26:27.620]  to extend the shutdown till september or longer all of a sudden my emails my twitter my my phone
[3:26:27.620 --> 3:26:31.700]  began to blow up from people who were angry at me initially when they saw me on the front page of
[3:26:31.700 --> 3:26:38.660]  the paper thought i was a troublemaker uh self aggrandizing they said how did you know how did
[3:26:38.660 --> 3:26:42.580]  you know it was going to lead to this you're so right i feel so well the unit said that it never
[3:26:42.580 --> 3:26:47.540]  ends they've said that lockdown will never end never shake hands again never founcy said always
[3:26:47.540 --> 3:26:53.460]  wear a mask no like you imagine it's just like you like snap your fingers you're inside the new world
[3:26:53.460 --> 3:26:58.580]  order yeah it's now people are like wow how did you know and in case you knew well you know i wrote
[3:26:58.580 --> 3:27:02.740]  a book called the race to save our century where i studied the genocides democides and total wars
[3:27:02.740 --> 3:27:08.580]  of the 20th century and i wrote that book started writing in the late 90s because i read the book
[3:27:08.580 --> 3:27:12.740]  death by government by rumble which i know you're very familiar with and i said how do i order my life
[3:27:12.740 --> 3:27:17.620]  so that my posterity doesn't have to deal with genocides doesn't have to deal with democides
[3:27:17.620 --> 3:27:22.500]  because the number one cause of death is government government yeah the famine the famines of the 20th
[3:27:22.500 --> 3:27:27.780]  century were all caused by governments the famine in ethiopia was the marxist government burning
[3:27:27.780 --> 3:27:33.700]  surplus is a bourgeois capitalism the famines in china were caused by the marxists driving people
[3:27:33.700 --> 3:27:38.980]  off of their farms and the children who are dying today in sub-saharan africa are dying because of
[3:27:38.980 --> 3:27:46.180]  government actually not even like hard government but by these illegal orders by the shaming of the
[3:27:46.180 --> 3:27:51.540]  media by social media forbidding and the average liberal goes okay there's too many africans they
[3:27:51.540 --> 3:27:56.020]  love black people but now are you gonna stand by while that kid dies at 3 a.m begging for mommy
[3:27:56.020 --> 3:28:01.060]  with their guts rotting out starving to death no they wouldn't do it they just go it's like bill
[3:28:01.060 --> 3:28:04.980]  berth at comedians like we got to get rid of 85 percent of people everybody's laughing the damn
[3:28:04.980 --> 3:28:09.540]  audience is going to be killed don't you people get it no in africa i've flown over africa
[3:28:09.540 --> 3:28:14.660]  you look out the green though there's nobody down there you fly across north america you
[3:28:14.660 --> 3:28:19.060]  look out the window there's nobody down there you see a lot of farms right we're one big farm
[3:28:19.060 --> 3:28:24.020]  but uh we like to live around each other so yes you go we congregate we love it you know we get
[3:28:24.020 --> 3:28:27.700]  in one spot and when we go oh there's so many of us yeah it's because we all got together we love
[3:28:27.700 --> 3:28:32.980]  each other you know what i learned from kovat this kovat shutdown i love crowds i love festival i
[3:28:32.980 --> 3:28:38.580]  do too yeah relax and it's all like yeah i love it's like dancing it's psychic you get connected
[3:28:38.580 --> 3:28:46.260]  yes we love people i love crowds you go to africa and it is poor really because i think they don't
[3:28:46.260 --> 3:28:50.980]  have enough population we've destroyed their population with these population control plans
[3:28:50.980 --> 3:28:54.660]  from mary stopes to the global ban on db well that's what they actually the globalists said that
[3:28:54.660 --> 3:28:59.300]  that's why they destabilize certain areas yeah yeah so you have the global ban on dbt the government
[3:28:59.300 --> 3:29:06.020]  policy kills half a billion people you have famine caused by government policy they say yeah they needed
[3:29:06.020 --> 3:29:11.220]  that heat to make them energize their industry that's what happens they needed that to go to that level
[3:29:11.220 --> 3:29:17.220]  they're always sabotage yeah it's heartbreaking you know if you google food insecurity every single
[3:29:17.220 --> 3:29:23.700]  story will say kovat is leading to famine kovat is leading oh the hysteria of kovat led to it yeah
[3:29:23.700 --> 3:29:27.380]  anyone with common sense is what does kovat have to do with famine it has to do with the government
[3:29:27.380 --> 3:29:34.100]  policies that were put in place because you lock down african export food or flowers or
[3:29:34.100 --> 3:29:37.300]  metals or whatever and they're and they lay everybody off everybody goes home and starves
[3:29:37.300 --> 3:29:40.820]  you know because in africa they just go home everybody gets in the hut and the kids swivel
[3:29:40.820 --> 3:29:44.580]  up and mama and daddy dies and they bury them i mean that's what they do folks they just go home
[3:29:44.580 --> 3:29:51.620]  and die folks google it you'll see pictures of children they don't wake up because of malnutrition
[3:29:51.620 --> 3:29:55.540]  starving explain that because they always say oh they didn't starve to death they died of malnutrition
[3:29:55.540 --> 3:29:59.940]  it's the same thing and they just kill these people and the left thinks it's so cute i want to
[3:29:59.940 --> 3:30:04.180]  strangle them yeah every life matters the only lives that seem to matter are the ones in media
[3:30:04.180 --> 3:30:10.100]  that tells the matter let me tell you it doesn't matter it's jeff bezos and zuckerberg and all
[3:30:10.100 --> 3:30:14.660]  these people worth trillions of damn dollars who tell us that we're racist and bad when they're the
[3:30:14.660 --> 3:30:22.020]  ones that want to murder poor people everywhere and i tell zuckerberg and bezos and all of these
[3:30:22.020 --> 3:30:29.140]  deaths of these children i don't care what color they are it's on you and god sees you god sees you
[3:30:29.140 --> 3:30:36.740]  tim cook god sees you sundar pachai god sees you and so you keep pretending you're god because god's
[3:30:36.740 --> 3:30:44.900]  gonna get you how do you contest an election in the year 2020 well you trigger race riots
[3:30:45.540 --> 3:30:49.620]  and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're the speaker of the house
[3:30:49.620 --> 3:30:55.300]  that you are legitimately now the president that's what she's been said on cbs news and that you're
[3:30:55.300 --> 3:31:01.380]  going to have those blue states succeed yes that's officially called a civil war ladies and gentlemen
[3:31:01.380 --> 3:31:05.860]  and the democrats are backed by the e you hollywood the chai cons and the whole globalist system
[3:31:05.860 --> 3:31:11.780]  this is treason with a capital t and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards they won't
[3:31:11.780 --> 3:31:15.940]  even stand up against it and do anything even though our president has been exposing it
[3:31:15.940 --> 3:31:20.340]  but here's the bottom line you need storeable food we've got the best quality ready to ship to
[3:31:20.340 --> 3:31:24.420]  you right now two to four week delivery with 80 days out from the election you need to get high
[3:31:24.420 --> 3:31:28.820]  quality storeable food right now in case they are able to pull this off we're gonna have a great
[3:31:28.820 --> 3:31:32.820]  depression war on the streets it'll make a road warrior look like a cake walk get your high quality
[3:31:32.820 --> 3:31:39.300]  storeable foods now and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com get prepared you can really
[3:31:39.300 --> 3:31:47.620]  break civilizations down to two types predatory and non predatory or oppressive conquest based
[3:31:47.620 --> 3:31:53.460]  or renaissance based and of course different types of civilizations and countries and political
[3:31:53.460 --> 3:32:01.460]  systems of history and at the present are mixes of the two but with globalism it is a post human
[3:32:01.460 --> 3:32:09.940]  ideology so it's scientifically geared to be oppressive and the rationale is social Darwinism
[3:32:09.940 --> 3:32:15.300]  that the ruling class are elites and because they're in power they have a right to rule over you
[3:32:15.300 --> 3:32:22.020]  poison you dumb you down sterilize you and kill you so all the people wearing masks like outside
[3:32:22.020 --> 3:32:27.620]  at the park and stuff are living in a total hoax and think their active submission is an
[3:32:27.620 --> 3:32:32.580]  act of working for the common good in a collective no it's a sign that you're a slave
[3:32:32.580 --> 3:32:37.460]  we'll take the force inoculations federal government Yale are studying the force inoculations
[3:32:37.460 --> 3:32:44.980]  right now the united nations and the national institutes of health with the cdc are publicly
[3:32:44.980 --> 3:32:52.420]  conducting a four thousand person study spending tens of millions of dollars at Yale on 15 ways to
[3:32:52.420 --> 3:32:57.540]  brainwash the public into taking inoculations basically squeezing you and forcing you to
[3:32:57.540 --> 3:33:02.420]  take them through guilt through fines through not being able to go into stores not being able
[3:33:02.420 --> 3:33:08.660]  to get on airplanes or have jobs this is forced inoculations it's public gateway pun it wrote
[3:33:08.660 --> 3:33:14.260]  about it last week david knight wrote about it this week stories up on info wars dot com so people
[3:33:14.260 --> 3:33:21.380]  say oh i'll just wear a mask it's never gonna end that's just the sign of submission fouchy admits
[3:33:21.380 --> 3:33:26.980]  that next is the contact tracing of the apps on your phones and the inoculations that is a
[3:33:26.980 --> 3:33:33.620]  dna vaccine that changes your dna this isn't a science fiction movie it's happening right now
[3:33:33.620 --> 3:33:41.780]  compliance is death compliance is annihilation wake up wake up this is a maximum alert a maximum
[3:33:41.780 --> 3:33:47.780]  alert as of taking this alert you're 82 days out from the election as many of you know in the last
[3:33:47.780 --> 3:33:52.420]  year i've pointed out statements out of the council on foreign relations and other globalist
[3:33:52.420 --> 3:33:58.580]  organs that they know trump is going to win in a landslide so their strategy will be to contest
[3:33:58.580 --> 3:34:04.500]  the election if they fail to successfully steal it then they are openly now war gaining this is
[3:34:04.500 --> 3:34:10.100]  in the new york times having democrat states and cities secede from the union just like they've
[3:34:10.100 --> 3:34:15.380]  ignored trump's policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down that is nothing but a
[3:34:15.380 --> 3:34:20.340]  dress rehearsal they are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration not in dc
[3:34:20.340 --> 3:34:27.460]  they said in another city colosia said this when they crown bighton and kamala harris ladies and
[3:34:27.460 --> 3:34:34.020]  gentlemen this is the organized civil war this is their public criminal plan we should be praying
[3:34:34.020 --> 3:34:38.020]  we should be spreading the word we should be demanding trouble in the office to expose this
[3:34:38.020 --> 3:34:53.940]  criminal activity you're listening to the alex jones show

[3:35:39.540 --> 3:35:44.100]  all the entrances as of today and yesterday have nobody they're blocking them so we were going to
[3:35:44.100 --> 3:35:48.020]  march through and see if they'd arrest us they're not going to do it we're going to be there tomorrow
[3:35:48.020 --> 3:35:52.660]  regardless with our american flags which are very triggering to god because because it seems like
[3:35:52.660 --> 3:35:58.500]  it's no big deal no telling the truth in a world of deception is a revolutionary act to paraphrase
[3:35:58.500 --> 3:36:04.980]  towards our will so all of this is fundamental claiming the land claiming the menu like god and
[3:36:04.980 --> 3:36:13.860]  genesis gave us mr. jones yeah it's important and for us it's the park but the park is an example
[3:36:13.860 --> 3:36:18.740]  you you did that yesterday i got a ton of media but that loosens their grip and it's important
[3:36:18.740 --> 3:36:24.500]  that we loosen this grip because it's 10 10 million views just on twitter it's amazing i was looking at
[3:36:24.500 --> 3:36:29.380]  how many views you get i since i've been doing your show it's a bit scary to me because everywhere i go
[3:36:30.020 --> 3:36:34.180]  people are like looking at me and then are you i saw you on alex jones well it's the listeners
[3:36:34.180 --> 3:36:37.780]  they're doing it's not us but i mean yeah that's what i'm saying they're loosening the grip and
[3:36:37.780 --> 3:36:40.980]  why it's important to me i run a human rights organization that stands with the most vulnerable
[3:36:40.980 --> 3:36:47.460]  people in the world and they're the ones that are suffering most but now in massachusetts there's
[3:36:47.460 --> 3:36:51.380]  thousands of children in food insecurity in missouri oh people are starving to death now in
[3:36:51.380 --> 3:36:55.620]  security because you never hear they started it folks they get a cold and die and they call it
[3:36:55.620 --> 3:37:01.060]  covid when you don't get nutrients you die you die explain how the kids die in their sleep
[3:37:01.060 --> 3:37:05.860]  which is god being merciful i've seen the videos of africans and others the babies are begging
[3:37:05.860 --> 3:37:10.260]  little three-year-olds food mommy for they don't have food for them and they go okay mommy and they
[3:37:10.260 --> 3:37:14.820]  go to sleep in the morning they're dead and the mother's got to take their dead kid the mother's
[3:37:14.820 --> 3:37:19.140]  all shriveled she's dying but she's an adult she's strong and her kids dead because she couldn't
[3:37:19.140 --> 3:37:24.580]  take care of them you know it's um it's hard jim gaffigan does a skit where he says i haven't been
[3:37:24.580 --> 3:37:31.060]  hungry in 20 years and it's true most of us as americans have no idea of what it's like to even
[3:37:31.060 --> 3:37:36.580]  feel hunger pains and hunger pains isn't being hungry i was my mother had me as a teenager when
[3:37:36.580 --> 3:37:40.980]  she was a teenager there were maybe a day or two where there wasn't food in the refrigerator that's
[3:37:40.980 --> 3:37:47.460]  not a hunger i remember being a 17 year old infantryman and the cobra gold in thailand with
[3:37:47.460 --> 3:37:52.980]  my m-16 machine gun in the mountains and that's when the first time i saw a child suffering from
[3:37:52.980 --> 3:37:57.380]  hunger and i remember at that moment i thought that's really when i knew what i wanted to do with
[3:37:57.380 --> 3:38:01.700]  my life i said i described the child what was it like seeing that i don't even talk about it it was
[3:38:01.700 --> 3:38:06.340]  the father was holding him and that i asked my interpreter what was wrong with the boy he said
[3:38:06.340 --> 3:38:11.220]  he thought he was dying of malaria but imagine the son didn't look much shorter than the father so he
[3:38:11.220 --> 3:38:17.380]  was probably a young teenager and the father was leading up against a fence and at first i was looking
[3:38:17.380 --> 3:38:22.260]  at the fence because it reminded me of an old cowboy movie and there was a there was this this cow that
[3:38:22.260 --> 3:38:26.820]  looked like the cow cow was starving to death and so i was just daydreaming and marching along
[3:38:26.820 --> 3:38:32.260]  then i saw this man holding his son and the boy looked like he was i knew that the boy was dying
[3:38:32.820 --> 3:38:37.300]  and i asked the interpreter what was wrong and he said he probably has malaria but it was that
[3:38:37.300 --> 3:38:42.980]  moment as a young 17 year old infantryman that i said i want to live the right how privileged am i i
[3:38:42.980 --> 3:38:48.500]  was a teen parent born to a teen parent i was a high school dropout but it was that moment i knew
[3:38:48.500 --> 3:38:53.300]  that as an american i i didn't know what the word potable meant until i was in in thailand as a young
[3:38:53.300 --> 3:38:59.060]  infantryman it said water's old because water's water can't you drink all water no having water
[3:38:59.060 --> 3:39:05.860]  you can drink is a privilege not being hungry is a privilege not having a toothache half of your life
[3:39:05.860 --> 3:39:10.660]  and the globalists tell us we're getting rid of infrastructure because the third world wants what
[3:39:10.660 --> 3:39:16.420]  we've got we could give it to them but we have to lose it now to quote make them equal no they're
[3:39:16.420 --> 3:39:22.020]  destroying their future and get rid of ours that's the lie of the left the environmentalist is
[3:39:22.020 --> 3:39:26.340]  we don't give them medical care we don't give them potable water we don't get and they're like oh
[3:39:26.340 --> 3:39:32.020]  that's liberal no you're exterminating them yeah they say that oh i get attacked i endorsed
[3:39:32.020 --> 3:39:37.060]  president trump this week i get attacked by these catholic social justice warriors look what about human
[3:39:37.060 --> 3:39:43.300]  rights do i see anyone on the left talking about the Uighur do i see anyone on the left you back to
[3:39:43.300 --> 3:39:47.780]  Uighur you got cut off earlier so you try that you do this big interview with the president in
[3:39:47.780 --> 3:39:52.900]  abstention and and it's blocked when there are three million people in actual death camps i mean
[3:39:52.900 --> 3:39:58.420]  it's like they call it a conspiracy theory they say it is a conspiracy theory that there are three
[3:39:58.420 --> 3:40:04.340]  million Uighur in concentration camps it is a fact it is an absolute fact we actually have
[3:40:04.340 --> 3:40:09.780]  drone evidence our own state department loading on the transfer orders we harvested so talk about
[3:40:09.780 --> 3:40:13.300]  the interview where do people find this interview well it's the jason jones show if you go to the
[3:40:13.300 --> 3:40:19.060]  jason jones show wherever you watch your podcast i'd ask that you share it and share it on facebook
[3:40:20.420 --> 3:40:24.420]  you know that's what happens when they try to stop us the ball actually bounces if they would
[3:40:24.420 --> 3:40:30.020]  have just given me a covid test when i walked to that doctor's office the the drive-thru clinic
[3:40:30.020 --> 3:40:35.620]  in early uh march there would have never been a film your hospital movement but the Uighur if you
[3:40:35.620 --> 3:40:41.140]  think my patron saint his name is st max and ling colby he died in a starvation bunker in auschwitz
[3:40:41.140 --> 3:40:49.300]  in 1941 today on august 14th 1941 he went to auschwitz volunteered to go in a starvation bunker so
[3:40:49.300 --> 3:40:53.460]  that somebody with a family didn't have to go because of the rule of ten and we all think we
[3:40:53.460 --> 3:40:59.380]  would be somebody like that well i would not trade places with a Uighur man in a concentration camp
[3:40:59.380 --> 3:41:05.780]  i'm not that heroic but what i can do is i can speak up i can write my elected officials um
[3:41:05.780 --> 3:41:10.180]  there was a protest in front of the white house today asking the white house to move on companies
[3:41:10.180 --> 3:41:17.140]  like nike and adidas oh my god they're so sick with cavernic saying america sucks and and creating

[3:42:34.260 --> 3:42:38.980]  concern for the vulnerable for wealth or power or prestige when you stand in real solidarity
[3:42:38.980 --> 3:42:43.620]  with the vulnerable the police raid you uh in the middle of the night when you stand in solidarity
[3:42:43.620 --> 3:42:48.020]  look at this it's really unbelievable when you really stand in solidarity with people who are
[3:42:48.020 --> 3:42:52.900]  vulnerable no one's going to give you an award no one's going to give you a parade because no one
[3:42:52.900 --> 3:42:58.980]  cares um and that's and that's what we're seeing with the Uyghur and they are truly the most
[3:42:58.980 --> 3:43:03.700]  vulnerable people in the world it was the Yazidi we have the nuba and Sudan there are lots of
[3:43:03.700 --> 3:43:09.540]  vulnerable communities um but but they've got land and china wants it and they're not aggressive
[3:43:09.540 --> 3:43:15.140]  Muslims you're right and they're being murdered and enslaved and then tim cook literally gets his
[3:43:15.140 --> 3:43:20.020]  components made by him and then struts around saying how americans are bad it's disgusting
[3:43:20.660 --> 3:43:25.140]  yeah it's disgusting and that's where we have to learn how to live small all of us we all want
[3:43:25.140 --> 3:43:30.420]  the biggest tv we treat the most sophisticated electronics i do is almost disposable i drop my
[3:43:30.420 --> 3:43:34.900]  iphone i'll get a new iphone no i agree we need to take our money and energy and put it into warfare
[3:43:34.900 --> 3:43:41.380]  against the enemy we should take everything live small not to be small to take everything we produce
[3:43:41.380 --> 3:43:46.660]  and throw it at them yeah we live we live small so we can live large we live small so we can be free
[3:43:46.660 --> 3:43:53.860]  we live small so that we're not tied to this exploitation when i buy Nike shoes i am tied
[3:43:53.860 --> 3:43:57.620]  to this exploitation we now my daughter bought a pair and i wasn't mad at my oldest daughter and i

[3:44:37.140 --> 3:44:40.740]  that we now know comes from the camps that they take from the Uyghur women oh yeah
[3:44:40.740 --> 3:44:46.500]  women they forcibly sterilize their heads or marry off to Han Chinese and the advantage
[3:44:46.500 --> 3:44:51.300]  that the neoliberals have is that what they're doing and what china has is what they're doing is
[3:44:51.300 --> 3:44:55.860]  so disgusting no one can believe no one can believe no one can believe that they're buying
