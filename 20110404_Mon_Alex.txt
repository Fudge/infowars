[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:28.160]  Texas Alex Jones strap yourselves in it is April 4th 2011 on this Monday
[00:28.160 --> 00:34.360]  edition over Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura and of course the man behind the
[00:34.360 --> 00:41.320]  hit TV show conspiracy theory on true TV kicked off his latest publicity tour
[00:41.320 --> 00:46.800]  promoting an amazing new book that we by the way are now shipping out 63 documents
[00:46.800 --> 00:51.880]  the government doesn't want you to read available at info wars.com he's gonna be
[00:51.880 --> 00:57.520]  joining us from New York today he was on good morning America and said that he
[00:57.520 --> 01:03.160]  would like to be Ron Paul's running mate that he would run with Ron Paul in the
[01:03.160 --> 01:08.240]  2012 election I talked in a little bit privately about this months ago before he
[01:08.240 --> 01:11.880]  went down to Mexico but I didn't know if he was serious or not and we'll find out
[01:11.880 --> 01:16.640]  today if he really is when former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura joins
[01:16.640 --> 01:24.920]  us here on the live broadcast in the meantime obviously there is an insane
[01:24.920 --> 01:32.120]  amount of important news to cover chief among it the open calls restrict the
[01:32.120 --> 01:40.080]  First Amendment by US senator Lindsey Graham and others after the Florida
[01:40.080 --> 01:45.360]  pastor torched the Quran after putting it on trial now he says he's gonna put
[01:45.360 --> 01:51.760]  Muhammad on trial and there have been at least 24 deaths in Afghanistan due to
[01:51.760 --> 01:56.520]  rioting that's going on and the system is pushing to restrict the First
[01:56.520 --> 02:00.600]  Amendment openly I was listening to local talk radio last night even called
[02:00.600 --> 02:03.920]  into the Kenny Romair show because about 20% or so I listened for an hour
[02:03.920 --> 02:09.040]  roughly 20% of the callers he was taking call after call were for restricting the
[02:09.040 --> 02:14.640]  First Amendment or we're saying that we don't have a right to burn a Quran a
[02:14.640 --> 02:19.960]  Bible the American flag you name it now whereas all of that is obviously
[02:19.960 --> 02:24.400]  disrespectful and distasteful and dangerous it's still the First Amendment
[02:24.400 --> 02:28.040]  that's what it's all about live in a free society some would be breaking this
[02:28.040 --> 02:32.320]  down but also the way the media the left and controlled right both of the
[02:32.320 --> 02:36.680]  control left and right are more and more pushing kind of the European model of
[02:36.680 --> 02:40.400]  well you can have free speech as long as it doesn't incite somebody but if you
[02:40.400 --> 02:43.960]  say something that could upset somebody we're gonna go ahead and find you or
[02:43.960 --> 02:48.520]  clap you and irons we've seen similar things out of cast Sunstein the White
[02:48.520 --> 02:55.600]  House regulations are so I want to look at these attempts to mainline the idea
[02:55.600 --> 02:59.920]  of restricting free speech and the controlled right wing loves to say
[02:59.920 --> 03:04.320]  well if it hurts our war effort ban it well in America we're the individual
[03:04.320 --> 03:10.320]  sovereigns we have our First Amendment dealing with Congress shall make no law
[03:10.320 --> 03:13.920]  restricting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[03:13.920 --> 03:18.040]  thereof in fact guys we grab me a pocket Constitution I'm gonna go over some of
[03:18.040 --> 03:21.960]  the Bill of Rights today when we come back from break or freedom of the press
[03:21.960 --> 03:25.880]  or the people's right to peaceably assemble for a or petition their
[03:25.880 --> 03:30.760]  government for redress of grievances I mean all of this is in the First
[03:30.760 --> 03:35.320]  Amendment and is enshrined and protected and we're gonna be going over that and
[03:35.320 --> 03:39.840]  this report by Kurt Nemo that's very important up at info wars com Lindsey
[03:39.840 --> 03:45.000]  Graham advocates killing the First Amendment other bizarre news golf spill
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.400]  company hands out safety bonuses to the people that ran the rig that obviously
[03:52.400 --> 03:57.080]  dumped hundreds and hundreds of millions of gallons of barrels of crude oil
[03:57.080 --> 04:02.640]  into the Gulf of Mexico that then went into the Atlantic Ocean and of course
[04:02.640 --> 04:10.320]  the Caribbean Sea also gold rises near 1,000 435 as dollar retreats oil climbs
[04:10.320 --> 04:16.520]  we're gonna get into Yemen our gallon little ally machine-gunning large crowds
[04:16.520 --> 04:21.920]  of demonstrators and actually heard Fox News on XM driving in this morning
[04:21.920 --> 04:27.160]  praising it and saying well they've got to do this because if they don't Al Qaeda
[04:27.160 --> 04:31.280]  will take over but then meanwhile the West is backing Al Qaeda and the attempted
[04:31.280 --> 04:39.920]  Alster of Libyan strong man and dictator Muammar Gaddafi there in North Africa so
[04:39.920 --> 04:43.360]  that's coming up Obama announces his reelection bid as the Wall Street money
[04:43.360 --> 04:50.920]  pours in we're also going to get into France invading the Ivory Coast and

[04:54.680 --> 04:59.640]  they're the good guys so that's okay just like dropping DU on Libby is good a

[08:32.720 --> 08:37.640]  governor Jesse Ventura has kicked off the promotion tour for his new bombshell
[08:37.640 --> 08:42.480]  book 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read he'll be joining us
[08:42.480 --> 08:49.080]  today from New York in the second hour we certainly look forward to that he went
[08:49.080 --> 08:54.200]  on good morning America today and told them that he would certainly consider
[08:54.200 --> 09:00.160]  running on the ticket with Ron Paul for president in the 2012 election that's
[09:00.160 --> 09:04.560]  going to be kicking off very soon in fact Obama has already kicked it off with
[09:04.560 --> 09:10.080]  a video announcement on his private Barack Obama website that he will be
[09:10.080 --> 09:15.880]  seeking reelection obviously and is starting a campaign fundraising tour as
[09:15.880 --> 09:20.160]  the globalist and George Soros types prepare to fill his coffers his initial
[09:20.160 --> 09:24.800]  campaign goal is to raise one billion dollars so he can continue to be the
[09:24.800 --> 09:30.000]  puppet in chief but governor Jesse Ventura scheduled to be joining us today
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.360]  obviously I'm going to get into the Koran burning situation and the ongoing
[09:35.360 --> 09:39.960]  attack on free speech in this country we're going to get into what's happening
[09:39.960 --> 09:43.240]  with the economy gold rising to one thousand four and thirty five dollars as
[09:43.240 --> 09:48.720]  the dollar falls and oil climbs we're going to get into the mass murder going
[09:48.720 --> 09:53.320]  on by the Yemeni's government backed by the West and Fox News this morning I
[09:53.320 --> 09:58.080]  was listening to him on XM praising you know saying he's got to do this he's
[09:58.080 --> 10:03.240]  got to mow people down because al Qaeda will take over the country if he doesn't
[10:03.240 --> 10:09.880]  meanwhile real al Qaeda is being used as they were used in Serbia as they were
[10:09.880 --> 10:13.040]  used against the Russians as they've been used against America to take our
[10:13.040 --> 10:17.960]  liberties they are being used against Muammar Gaddafi in North Africa also the
[10:17.960 --> 10:22.760]  French are increasing their invasion force of the Ivory Coast backing the
[10:22.760 --> 10:27.280]  admitted rebels who reportedly have killed at least a thousand innocent
[10:27.280 --> 10:30.440]  men women and children machine gunning them and hacking them up with machetes
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.960]  just over the weekend and the headlines are the French are landing to stop the
[10:34.960 --> 10:40.320]  slaughter by backing the rebels that are doing it so you got to love that has
[10:40.320 --> 10:43.720]  nothing to do with humanitarian operations remember the 800,000
[10:43.720 --> 10:48.760]  conservatively killed in 1994 first we heard that the UN stood down in Rwanda
[10:48.760 --> 10:54.160]  then we learn they rounded up the minority group whose land they wanted the
[10:54.160 --> 10:59.320]  Tootsies and allowed the other group to come in in fact I had the printout on
[10:59.320 --> 11:03.960]  that my stack yesterday we guys repull my fact sheet on Rwanda so when I get
[11:03.960 --> 11:07.000]  into that I've got the facts in front of me I want to make sure of that
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.800]  historically thank you so much obviously we're going to be getting in to an
[11:12.800 --> 11:22.960]  amazing video clip from former high-level CI analyst Michael Showyer who was on
[11:22.960 --> 11:26.840]  CNN and basically went further than I've ever seen him and telling the truth
[11:26.840 --> 11:33.440]  about how this is all a staged event in Libya and basically backing Al Qaeda and
[11:33.440 --> 11:38.320]  that CNN was just carrying the water for those individuals that story by the
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.200]  American dream and the accompanying video is up on info wars.com and prison
[11:42.200 --> 11:48.080]  ponda.com under the headline former CIA officer blows the lid off Libya fraud
[11:48.080 --> 11:54.960]  live on CNN but before I go any further I want to pull out my trusty
[11:54.960 --> 12:04.920]  citizen rulebook and I want to go to the Bill of Rights and when you read the
[12:04.920 --> 12:10.200]  Bill of Rights on page 49 in this version of the citizen rulebook that I
[12:10.200 --> 12:18.720]  have here in my hand it begins with the preamble the conventions of the number
[12:18.720 --> 12:22.680]  of the states having at the time of their adopting the Constitution express a
[12:22.680 --> 12:27.400]  desire in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers the
[12:27.400 --> 12:31.480]  further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added restrictive on
[12:31.480 --> 12:36.120]  government and as extending to the ground of public confidence in the
[12:36.120 --> 12:42.280]  government will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution article
[12:42.280 --> 12:46.560]  one Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
[12:46.560 --> 12:51.360]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof that means government has no jurisdiction
[12:51.360 --> 12:57.880]  over religious activities cannot tax it cannot regulate it cannot abridge it
[12:57.880 --> 13:03.200]  cannot control it now you know about 501c3 in the last 60 years roughly since
[13:03.200 --> 13:08.440]  the late 1940s and you know that they trick churches into signing on as
[13:08.440 --> 13:13.360]  charities and waiving their rights by tricking them into a government created
[13:13.360 --> 13:18.680]  charitable trust and then they tell the churches you can't talk about politics
[13:18.680 --> 13:23.760]  you can't speak out for drug legalization or drug criminalization or
[13:23.760 --> 13:29.160]  abortion or you can't speak out against political candidates totally kept
[13:29.160 --> 13:39.600]  enslaved monitored vassals of the federal government completely illegal we
[13:39.600 --> 13:42.760]  just read the Bill of Rights and the federal government is waging war on
[13:42.760 --> 13:45.880]  every one of them systematically but going back to the First Amendment
[13:45.880 --> 13:49.800]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment religion or prohibiting
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.280]  the free exercise thereof that means you can have any religion you want as long
[13:53.280 --> 13:57.240]  as you don't break criminal laws or abridging let me continue the First
[13:57.240 --> 14:02.040]  Amendment freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people to
[14:02.040 --> 14:05.840]  peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.160]  but you try to protest even with a permit in DC you get arrested half the
[14:10.160 --> 14:14.560]  time without one you're going to jail one man 20 people a thousand they come
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.280]  after you there's open calls by Republicans and Democrats and the
[14:19.280 --> 14:24.200]  White House regulations are cast Sunstein to decide what you can say and
[14:24.200 --> 14:29.200]  can't say you can't deny man made global warming they want you arrested we've
[14:29.200 --> 14:35.320]  got senator Jay Rockefeller senator Lindsey Graham we've got senator
[14:35.320 --> 14:41.000]  Lieberman all constantly like barking dogs that won't shut up every time
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.760]  there's some type of crisis they seize on it and say it's the First Amendment
[14:45.760 --> 14:50.240]  it's the internet it's freedom of speech now if you look at what Europe does and
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.200]  obviously I'm about to get into the Korean burning situation Europe first
[14:54.200 --> 15:00.040]  came out and said after World War two okay Germany and other countries now
[15:00.040 --> 15:05.560]  enshrined under EU law or 25 member nations first you can't be a white
[15:05.560 --> 15:10.440]  supremacist then you can't criticize immigrants then you can't criticize the
[15:10.440 --> 15:16.320]  EU you can't say mean things about a politician because even if they're true
[15:16.320 --> 15:22.280]  that's not a defense because it might incite someone to do something violent
[15:22.280 --> 15:28.040]  so if I read the London Telegraph or the London Observer or Bloomberg who are
[15:28.040 --> 15:34.680]  again reporting on the 376 billion it's it's now up from 360 plus billion
[15:34.680 --> 15:40.920]  dollars that Wacovia and Wells Fargo and Wacovia the subgroup of Wells Fargo
[15:40.920 --> 15:44.520]  pled guilty but was not criminally charged and paid a hundred and something
[15:44.520 --> 15:51.360]  million dollar fine a tiny tiny fraction of the 376 billion dollars that they
[15:51.360 --> 15:55.800]  laundered including paying for the aircraft leasing them running them the
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.480]  entire operation they make hundreds of billions and they pay a hundred million
[15:59.480 --> 16:03.800]  dollar fine it's a hundred million and change it was a hundred one million I
[16:03.800 --> 16:07.080]  read that article here on air the latest from the London Guardian when a caller
[16:07.080 --> 16:10.120]  called in and pointed it out because this was back in the news last year but
[16:10.120 --> 16:16.520]  now it's back in the news if I come out and say that Wacovia was caught dealing
[16:16.520 --> 16:24.080]  drugs and somebody who's angry who say daughter died of a of a cocaine overdose
[16:24.080 --> 16:28.520]  and they helped launder the money consciously and then that mother goes
[16:28.520 --> 16:33.520]  and gets angry at them and does something that's her issue and that's their
[16:33.520 --> 16:39.320]  issue for invoking her passion I shouldn't be censured with a denotus like
[16:39.320 --> 16:42.080]  they have in England where the government can just quietly block media
[16:42.080 --> 16:45.480]  from reporting whatever they want because I reported something that made
[16:45.480 --> 16:50.880]  people angry I mean it's like Nixon when they discovered he'd been lying and
[16:50.880 --> 16:56.000]  breaking into things and blackmailing people would would Woodward and Bernstein
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.680]  get in trouble for exposing something that caused massive protest some of them
[17:00.680 --> 17:06.360]  that turned violent no it's Richard Nixon that got caught engaging in the crimes
[17:06.360 --> 17:12.520]  that quite frankly are tamed compared to modern times that elicited that not the
[17:12.520 --> 17:18.480]  people reporting on it now number one the federal government can make no laws
[17:18.480 --> 17:22.440]  dealing with religion or they can't tax it they can't regulate it they can't
[17:22.440 --> 17:26.840]  tell you what you can and can't do period that's why the Hopi Indians federal
[17:26.840 --> 17:30.360]  courts have found are allowed to take peyote because for thousands of years
[17:30.360 --> 17:35.000]  that's been part of their religion it's very expansive because it is the First
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.120]  Amendment that is the press the right to protest the right to petition and the
[17:40.120 --> 17:45.800]  right of religion period they have no jurisdiction these are laws the big
[17:45.800 --> 17:52.240]  mega laws the big King Daddy laws with statutory penalties against any Fed or
[17:52.240 --> 17:58.640]  any state agent for that matter that tries to violate them now more and more
[17:58.640 --> 18:04.320]  we see pushes from the controlled left and controlled right of how great it
[18:04.320 --> 18:09.160]  would be to restrict free speech the left says that if it hurts equality or
[18:09.160 --> 18:15.720]  that if it causes division or makes people upset or makes people sad that
[18:15.720 --> 18:20.400]  you don't have a right of course really if something isn't true libel slander
[18:20.400 --> 18:24.320]  defamation then it's a civil matter and you can be brought to justice there is
[18:24.320 --> 18:28.920]  that check and balance there and the old days he said something wasn't true
[18:28.920 --> 18:33.480]  dueling was legal with swords and firearms and somebody knock on your door
[18:33.480 --> 18:38.960]  and say come outside get your second to make sure the rules are followed the
[18:38.960 --> 18:44.080]  local referee and we're gonna meet you on the field or you apologize and admit
[18:44.080 --> 18:52.920]  you're a dirty lion stinking coward but again I digress with history here the
[18:52.920 --> 18:56.800]  media is promoting this pastor who's done this and I don't agree with what he's
[18:56.800 --> 19:01.800]  done but I agree with his right to do it as a pretext to then begin to set the
[19:01.800 --> 19:06.240]  precedence and open the debate to restrict free speech here in America and
[19:06.240 --> 19:10.880]  if they can say that he can't burn a Korean next it will be like it is in
[19:10.880 --> 19:14.760]  Canada that people are barred from traveling to Canada or they're arrested
[19:14.760 --> 19:19.840]  if they criticize Muslims Jews Christians but it's selectively enforced
[19:19.840 --> 19:25.800]  mainly only if you criticize Muslims or Jewish groups Christianity it's always
[19:25.800 --> 19:31.760]  great if the Canadian Arts Department wants to fund feces on Mary on an
[19:31.760 --> 19:37.440]  image of Mary or in here in the US the feds want to finance the crucifix and
[19:37.440 --> 19:43.080]  urine it's great it's wonderful it's taken care of because again Christianity
[19:43.080 --> 19:45.800]  is what's under attack by the globalist because it's the dominant system here
[19:45.800 --> 19:48.880]  Islam's under attack the Middle East because it's the dominant system there
[19:48.880 --> 19:52.840]  I'm gonna break all this down we come back and play the shocking clip of Lindsey
[19:52.840 --> 19:56.520]  Graham saying let's get that First Amendment let's shut it down he wants to

[22:15.720 --> 22:20.720]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling them

[22:29.560 --> 22:33.080]  the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar will soon

[23:39.680 --> 23:42.960]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to
[23:42.960 --> 23:45.880]  the liberties of the people than a standing army hi Ted Anderson I'm

[24:23.880 --> 24:28.280]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom
[24:28.280 --> 24:32.120]  of speech or the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and
[24:32.120 --> 24:38.520]  to petition the government for redress of grievance listening to CNN Fox on XM at
[24:38.520 --> 24:42.880]  home and in the car listening to local talk radio on 590 a.m. listening to other
[24:42.880 --> 24:48.280]  national radio in the last few days since the Quran burning kicked off the
[24:48.280 --> 24:54.440]  video they shot weeks ago and just released Friday and the subsequent riots
[24:54.440 --> 24:58.240]  in Afghanistan and protests and other parts of the world and the 24 deaths
[24:58.240 --> 25:03.440]  that have been confirmed in Afghanistan listening to these talk show hosts a lot
[25:03.440 --> 25:06.760]  of them come out and say should we restrict speech should we go ahead and
[25:06.760 --> 25:11.080]  arrest this guy and about 20% of the callers on the shows I've heard and some
[25:11.080 --> 25:14.760]  of the hosts are openly saying yeah they think so because it hurts the war
[25:14.760 --> 25:19.240]  effort and general Petraeus said so well how about general Petraeus stick to
[25:19.240 --> 25:22.960]  being a military commander how about he stays out of our political activities
[25:22.960 --> 25:26.240]  here in the US and our first amendment that he's sworn to protect and defend
[25:26.240 --> 25:29.560]  against all enemies foreign and domestic I guess that makes himself a
[25:29.560 --> 25:33.480]  domestic enemy because when you're an enemy of the first amendment you're an
[25:33.480 --> 25:38.640]  enemy of it all okay we run this country we elect the representatives we decide
[25:38.640 --> 25:42.160]  what our political views are if we don't like a war and it hurts the war
[25:42.160 --> 25:46.600]  effort then we shouldn't be having that war it's part of a public discourse if
[25:46.600 --> 25:52.080]  people want to burn Karan's that's their right to do it I think it's stupid but
[25:52.080 --> 25:57.640]  you know what it's it's speech that's unpopular it's speech that is evocative
[25:57.640 --> 26:02.960]  that's protected not just saying oh it's a pretty day it's a pretty spring day
[26:02.960 --> 26:08.880]  with blue sky and and birds tweeting well nobody cares about that speech nobody
[26:08.880 --> 26:13.840]  gets upset about that or man that was a good hamburger nobody cares about that
[26:13.840 --> 26:17.880]  speech or oh I sure enjoyed it working out at the gym today I had a good
[26:17.880 --> 26:23.800]  workout nobody cares about oh hey do you see the NCAA scores no it's there to
[26:23.800 --> 26:28.200]  protect your speech and if Christians want to say Muslims are bad that's
[26:28.200 --> 26:31.560]  their right and if Muslims want to say Christians are bad or Jews are bad or
[26:31.560 --> 26:35.120]  Jews want to say Muslims are bad that's their right or if atheists want to say
[26:35.120 --> 26:40.080]  Christians and Muslims are idiots or if cartoonists want to draw cartoons make
[26:40.080 --> 26:46.040]  it fun of the Prophet Muhammad that's their right that's their right to do
[26:46.040 --> 26:50.360]  that that's why America is free now we're becoming less and less free but
[26:50.360 --> 26:55.280]  it's so naked and out in the open have Lindsey Graham and a bunch of others
[26:55.280 --> 27:00.560]  saying they want to move with legislation to restrict the first
[27:00.560 --> 27:05.880]  amendment in America on anything that could quote hurt a war effort or upset
[27:05.880 --> 27:09.800]  somebody anything that could be provocative why aren't we talking about
[27:09.800 --> 27:18.880]  the people that have killed 24 policemen reportedly in Afghanistan have killed
[27:18.880 --> 27:26.600]  NATO troops they've beheaded multiple UN workers they go out and kill people
[27:26.600 --> 27:30.560]  that had nothing to do with this Quran burning they are the ones with the
[27:30.560 --> 27:34.320]  problems they are they'll listen they're suppressed in Afghanistan they don't
[27:34.320 --> 27:38.040]  have any real liberties but governments in the Middle East and Central Asia will
[27:38.040 --> 27:42.360]  allow people to blow up and vent their anger towards Western governments even
[27:42.360 --> 27:45.640]  though many of those governments are puppets that allow that venting because
[27:45.640 --> 27:50.120]  it's politically popular because under Sharia law it's a big no-no to
[27:50.120 --> 27:55.960]  burn a Quran well we're not under Sharia law we're not under Vatican law we're not
[27:55.960 --> 27:59.480]  under that sure 500 years ago if you burned a Bible the Vatican would burn you
[27:59.480 --> 28:05.400]  at the stake we're not under that we're under the first amendment George Washington
[28:05.400 --> 28:11.440]  Thomas Jefferson and that's whose side I'm on I believe my ideas are historical
[28:11.440 --> 28:16.360]  are accurate are cutting-edge are direct and I know my ideas in a level
[28:16.360 --> 28:21.640]  playing field are going to win so you can say your idiotic things as long as
[28:21.640 --> 28:25.080]  you don't try to come to my house to take me to jail because you want my
[28:25.080 --> 28:30.000]  property or you want my land or you want my children or you want to stomp on my
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.760]  free speech you can have your free speech but the minute you touch me the
[28:34.760 --> 28:38.240]  minute you lay your hands on me the first amendment the Declaration of
[28:38.240 --> 28:44.880]  Independence says I can unleash absolute firepower on you you understand that now
[28:44.880 --> 28:48.560]  let's go it we're gonna go to break come back with a Lindsey Graham clip but in
[28:48.560 --> 28:55.760]  the long segment coming up but this is incredible and they really are pushing
[28:55.760 --> 28:59.760]  this here's Curt Nemo's excellent article at info wars.com Lindsey Graham
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.080]  advocates killing First Amendment in response to idiotic and pointless
[29:04.080 --> 29:08.280]  burning of the Koran by Florida pastor and the deadly riots that fall in
[29:08.280 --> 29:11.800]  Afghanistan Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as proposed limiting the
[29:11.800 --> 29:16.880]  First Amendment he told CBS's Bob Schaffer Sunday I wish we could find a
[29:16.880 --> 29:20.360]  way to hold people accountable free speech is a great idea but we're in a
[29:20.360 --> 29:25.160]  war oh it's a great idea but he went on to say that he is preparing to try to get
[29:25.160 --> 29:30.240]  legislation passed to do this and he also promoted FDRs executive order 8985
[29:30.240 --> 29:35.800]  that established the office of censorship so they're promoting that the
[29:35.800 --> 29:40.640]  order gave a legion of bureaucrats absolute discretion over the existence
[29:40.640 --> 29:43.360]  of the First Amendment the free speech of all Americans and you couldn't
[29:43.360 --> 29:46.920]  criticize war profiteering or planes that fell out of the sky because they
[29:46.920 --> 29:52.240]  were shoddily made you had to love the corruption we're on the march the
[29:52.240 --> 30:01.360]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with

[30:22.240 --> 30:26.240]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[30:26.240 --> 30:30.360]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[30:30.360 --> 30:34.320]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[30:34.320 --> 30:38.480]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[30:38.480 --> 30:42.280]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar

[33:39.880 --> 33:44.480]  openly saying well that Lindsey Graham does have a point and General Petraeus
[33:44.480 --> 33:49.320]  we might have to restrict free speech if it hurts the war effort now remember

[34:11.320 --> 34:15.840]  got Fox News with Geraldo last year with the Marine Corps Colonel saying yeah we
[34:15.840 --> 34:20.400]  help grow the opium for the locals because if we don't Al Qaeda will make
[34:20.400 --> 34:25.760]  the money I mean they're publicly producing this stuff in front of
[34:25.760 --> 34:34.400]  everybody now that said if they're able to set the precedent to say that if it
[34:34.400 --> 34:38.200]  hurts a war effort and the government and the military decides if it does then
[34:38.200 --> 34:42.200]  we're living in an official dictatorship of a bunch of autocratic control
[34:42.200 --> 34:47.600]  freaks and they are quoting times in World War two where there were sensors
[34:47.600 --> 34:52.720]  dealing with military news what ships were being launched what time they were
[34:52.720 --> 34:58.480]  leaving which is unconstitutional in and of itself right there but now they're
[34:58.480 --> 35:06.880]  expanding that to say that if a misguided preacher burns something well
[35:06.880 --> 35:13.680]  then we've got to go ahead and go after them and if they can do that well then
[35:13.680 --> 35:17.520]  any political group out there can go out and protest or throw some mall off
[35:17.520 --> 35:20.560]  cocktails and then the government's gonna come in and say we've got to
[35:20.560 --> 35:24.160]  restrict that and that's what the EU does that's what Canada does the
[35:24.160 --> 35:28.200]  government decides if something's provocative they decide if something could
[35:28.200 --> 35:36.560]  incite someone and Europe has moved to censure newspapers that have had
[35:36.560 --> 35:40.680]  cartoons in the last few years of you know Muhammad with his with his turban
[35:40.680 --> 35:45.840]  as a bomb or things like that and whereas I'm not trying to stir up
[35:45.840 --> 35:49.240]  religious groups I'm not trying to create division and infighting and the
[35:49.240 --> 35:53.360]  globalists are actually hyping this up to create Balkanization in division and
[35:53.360 --> 35:58.760]  class of civilizations so they can stir the Muslims up to cause crises and
[35:58.760 --> 36:04.160]  so they can then restrict our free speech here at home but here is Lindsey
[36:04.160 --> 36:08.840]  Graham advocating killing First Amendment on face the nation yesterday will
[36:08.840 --> 36:12.320]  play part of it if you want to see the full clip it's in Kurt Nemo's article
[36:12.320 --> 36:16.040]  Lindsey Graham advocates killing First Amendment I'm gonna get to this
[36:16.040 --> 36:20.760]  Afghanistan thing general portray us today condemn the actions of this Florida
[36:20.760 --> 36:24.880]  preacher who burned the Quran you heard what senator weed said yeah is there
[36:24.880 --> 36:30.600]  anything that actually can be done along this line you know I wish we could
[36:30.600 --> 36:35.680]  find some way to hold people accountable free speech is a great idea but
[36:35.680 --> 36:39.000]  we're in a war during World War two you had limits on what you could say if it
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.480]  would inspire the enemy so burning a Quran is a terrible thing but it doesn't
[36:43.480 --> 36:47.120]  justify killing someone burning a Bible would be a terrible thing but it
[36:47.120 --> 36:51.640]  wouldn't justify a murder but having said that anytime we can push back here
[36:51.640 --> 36:55.600]  in America against actions like this that put our troops at risk we're to do
[36:55.600 --> 36:59.240]  it so I look forward to working with senator to carry and read and others to
[36:59.240 --> 37:03.440]  condemn this condemn violence all over the world based in the name of
[37:03.440 --> 37:07.200]  religion but general portray us understands better than anybody else in
[37:07.200 --> 37:11.760]  America what happens when something like this is done in our country and he was
[37:11.760 --> 37:15.480]  right to condemn it and I think Congress would be right to reinforce what
[37:15.480 --> 37:21.280]  general portray us said we saw the report from Liz Palmer okay or more all
[37:21.280 --> 37:26.480]  across and it goes on from there with more of similar statements so he says
[37:26.480 --> 37:31.720]  the First Amendment's a great idea well no it's a great law it's the law it's
[37:31.720 --> 37:35.960]  what America's founded on it's the First Amendment for a reason Lindsey who
[37:35.960 --> 37:40.760]  supports carbon taxes and the rest of it a sickening little globalist and he
[37:40.760 --> 37:45.640]  also brings up World War two and sensors and then went on to bring up
[37:45.640 --> 37:49.760]  executive orders to restrict it and there's other discussions about trying
[37:49.760 --> 37:55.640]  to introduce laws he says they should push back the out of control government
[37:55.640 --> 37:59.920]  the out of control Pentagon what happened six months ago when polls came out
[37:59.920 --> 38:04.840]  showing over 70% of the American people in Gallup did not want us to be in
[38:04.840 --> 38:08.960]  Afghanistan anymore and what did the Secretary of Defense Gates say he said
[38:08.960 --> 38:13.200]  I don't care what you think I don't care what the American people want I thought
[38:13.200 --> 38:17.920]  we run the government it wasn't a declared war it's unconstitutional
[38:17.920 --> 38:24.840]  we're there almost 10 years later it's a joke and they lie to us as a matter of
[38:24.840 --> 38:29.480]  course turns out they admit special forces from the US and Britain were in
[38:29.480 --> 38:35.240]  the east of the North African country of Libya before all this started that it is
[38:35.240 --> 38:39.120]  Al Qaeda is the core of the group being funded and armed by the West they've
[38:39.120 --> 38:44.760]  taken over the oil port set up their own bank their own oil company and they're
[38:44.760 --> 38:48.400]  going to spread this contagion all over Africa as a pretext for the West to
[38:48.400 --> 38:54.760]  invade then France and other EU countries there on the west coast of
[38:54.760 --> 39:00.160]  Africa and the Ivory Coast with all the oil and gold and diamonds that are there
[39:00.160 --> 39:05.080]  claim that the incumbent lost the election when that's disputed then they
[39:05.080 --> 39:10.360]  finance the rebel leader who reportedly has people with machetes and guns
[39:10.360 --> 39:13.800]  hacking and killing people just a thousand this weekend men women and
[39:13.800 --> 39:17.920]  children and then you read the headlines more French troops landing an
[39:17.920 --> 39:22.920]  airport taking over getting behind the rebels to stop the massacres and then
[39:22.920 --> 39:26.880]  buried footnotes it's the rebels engaged in the massacres this is the new
[39:26.880 --> 39:31.480]  globalist model they finance rebels to start a war with the country the
[39:31.480 --> 39:42.640]  globalist one invade no fly zones bombing invasions but then meanwhile in
[39:42.640 --> 39:52.760]  Yemen the death toll rises as US said to press the leader to go and it goes on I
[39:52.760 --> 39:56.120]  was listening to Fox News this morning they admitted that the government this
[39:56.120 --> 40:04.200]  western back is machine gunning crowds in mass the death toll is unknown and I'm
[40:04.200 --> 40:07.560]  listening to Fox and and they've got a reporter from there saying well the
[40:07.560 --> 40:11.120]  government here is fighting al-Qaeda that's that's you know if they don't do
[40:11.120 --> 40:15.640]  this to these protesters with live ammunition that's what they call shooting
[40:15.640 --> 40:20.520]  people and killing them was if they don't stop using live ammunition you know
[40:20.520 --> 40:24.560]  if they do stop then al-Qaeda may take over in the power vacuum here and so
[40:24.560 --> 40:29.840]  you've got to understand they need to do this meanwhile al-Qaeda is in Libya
[40:29.840 --> 40:34.120]  running these operations western backed with that long history using al-Qaeda to
[40:34.120 --> 40:38.360]  hit the Russians hit the Serbs hit others they're now calling them Mujahideen
[40:38.360 --> 40:45.480]  again and telling us that we're doing it because Qaddafi fought back against the
[40:45.480 --> 40:51.640]  rebels so a very dangerous global system and I even have a clip off Fox News I
[40:51.640 --> 40:57.160]  meant to play yesterday where the host admitted on that show that this is part
[40:57.160 --> 41:00.880]  of forming global government and setting the precedent for a UN NATO back
[41:00.880 --> 41:05.920]  groups to invade whoever they want whenever they want so should a foreign
[41:05.920 --> 41:11.040]  government invade the United States under UN orders at Kent State whenever the
[41:11.040 --> 41:18.280]  military National Guard shot some people should we invade Yemen should the
[41:18.280 --> 41:22.980]  globalists use our power and our military we've paid for to do that I mean
[41:22.980 --> 41:27.320]  what happens when the Pakistanis on a routine basis shoot crowds of protesters
[41:27.320 --> 41:32.720]  do you hear talk of invading Pakistan
[41:33.800 --> 41:39.480]  why aren't they calling the people chopping the heads off UN forces shooting
[41:39.480 --> 41:43.440]  NATO forces in Afghanistan why aren't they calling them freedom fighters I
[41:43.440 --> 41:46.680]  don't think they're freedom fighters when they're killing and chopping people's
[41:46.680 --> 41:51.400]  heads off but if a group rebels and tries to overthrow an unpopular government
[41:51.400 --> 41:54.960]  and it's admitted cars I stole the election and it is a dictatorship in
[41:54.960 --> 41:59.080]  Afghanistan then if you're gonna invade Libya over this which they're now
[41:59.080 --> 42:01.800]  admitting well we're gonna have a ground force but it's gonna be to back up the
[42:01.800 --> 42:06.080]  rebels for humanitarian support it and the bombs dropping that's not a war
[42:06.080 --> 42:11.640]  either just like Limbaugh last week he said well look at this Rolling Stone
[42:11.640 --> 42:17.520]  article we've got the troops accidentally killing innocent people no
[42:17.520 --> 42:20.360]  they they knew they were killing people that weren't armed and he says well
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.000]  that's that's because our government's inept our military's inept then because
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.240]  used to we killed people on purpose civilians no we didn't do that until
[42:28.240 --> 42:36.000]  World War two okay and if Limbaugh wants to go along with that line that attacking
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.040]  civilians is good well then if he believes 9-11 wasn't an inside job if he
[42:40.040 --> 42:44.520]  believes 9-11 was an outside job then he has to say that Al Qaeda legitimately
[42:44.520 --> 42:49.960]  attacks civilian targets on 9-11 I don't agree with that but but see they
[42:49.960 --> 42:55.800]  expect us to not have common sense and logic and to I mean we have a public
[42:55.800 --> 43:02.120]  mind at least a portion of the population that's very duplicitous that's
[43:02.120 --> 43:09.280]  extremely duplicitous in their worldview common sense more and more has
[43:09.280 --> 43:16.360]  been extricated completely out of the window now I have another video clip
[43:16.360 --> 43:20.600]  we're gonna play here in just a moment and again if you want to watch this
[43:20.600 --> 43:29.360]  video it's up on info wars.com former CA officer blows lid off Libya fraud live
[43:29.360 --> 43:38.440]  on CNN and of course he's former top analyst Michael Scheuer and this
[43:38.440 --> 43:41.360]  article from the American Dream reports every once in a while establishment
[43:41.360 --> 43:45.800]  control the media cracks for a moment in an effort to achieve higher ratings
[43:45.800 --> 43:49.120]  mainstream news programs will invite guests on that promise to be interesting
[43:49.120 --> 43:54.480]  now it starts slow in the six-minute clip but it gets hardcore at the end when
[43:54.480 --> 43:58.000]  he basically just says this is nothing but a propaganda channel and he begins
[43:58.000 --> 44:03.840]  to admit that basically this is Al Qaeda being backed in North Africa by the
[44:03.840 --> 44:08.160]  West and he agrees with Ron Paul's analysis of the situation he was the
[44:08.160 --> 44:15.680]  CIA's top bin Laden expert here's that clip former CIA officer now help for
[44:15.680 --> 44:20.280]  Libyan rebels from the CIA if President Obama reportedly signing off on this
[44:20.280 --> 44:25.440]  sources say CIA operatives are on the ground in Libya and in contact with the
[44:25.440 --> 44:29.080]  opposition and joining us to talk more about the CIA's possible role in Libya
[44:29.080 --> 44:32.960]  from Washington former CIA counterterrorist Michael Scheuer Michael
[44:32.960 --> 44:35.800]  thanks for being with us this morning you're welcome so there are reports out
[44:35.800 --> 44:40.880]  again at the CIA is on the ground in Libya contacting and vetting the rebels
[44:40.880 --> 44:46.600]  is this they were there from the start I don't think there's any other possible
[44:46.600 --> 44:52.080]  reason for it and and the president clearly has sent the agency in to find
[44:52.080 --> 44:57.720]  out who he is supporting and to see what kind of material human material we
[44:57.720 --> 45:02.120]  would have to work with if we decided to if the president decided to arm and
[45:02.120 --> 45:05.160]  train these people over the longer term yeah and you're concerned about this
[45:05.160 --> 45:08.560]  prospect you think it could become another Taliban situation for the US what
[45:08.560 --> 45:13.600]  in your mind is the worst case scenario here well Libya has been very strong in
[45:13.600 --> 45:18.040]  sending young men or having its young men go overseas to fight in Islamic
[45:18.040 --> 45:23.500]  insurgencies in the Balkans in Chechnya Afghanistan especially Iraq when the
[45:23.500 --> 45:27.840]  height of the fighting was there those that don't get killed of course go home
[45:27.840 --> 45:32.440]  and I think the core of the resistance whatever little military activity
[45:32.440 --> 45:37.120]  military ability they have is probably made up by people we elsewhere we would
[45:37.120 --> 45:42.080]  call Mujahideen and so it's it's a dicey proposition to be getting involved
[45:42.080 --> 45:46.960]  with this I'm not sure that the opposition if it takes power is going to
[45:46.960 --> 45:50.680]  be much better than was Gaddafi but that's why you need to have the CIA I
[45:50.680 --> 45:55.280]  presume in their vetting as we said who who are these people who are the
[45:55.280 --> 45:58.840]  elements that are funding them or supporting them who are the the
[45:58.840 --> 46:02.680]  politically the most the most palatable with the least palatable among them the
[46:02.680 --> 46:06.720]  White House saying that no decision has been made I have a question for you as
[46:06.720 --> 46:11.920]  a CIA veteran I guess I mean the fact that we even know about this is that
[46:11.920 --> 46:16.040]  is that unusual I mean should we just assume that the CIA and the sort of a
[46:16.040 --> 46:20.320]  situation would of course be in there on the ground well you have to assume
[46:20.320 --> 46:23.280]  that the president wants the best information that he can get and if he
[46:23.280 --> 46:27.200]  wants to have that information he has to have somebody on the ground and so
[46:27.200 --> 46:31.760]  yes I think you assume wherever there's trouble you'll find the agency the
[46:31.760 --> 46:35.920]  other point I would make here is that vetting the people who are in the
[46:35.920 --> 46:40.240]  opposition of course is only you're only able to do that to the extent that
[46:40.240 --> 46:44.440]  they're willing to talk to you I think the agency will find a lot of people
[46:44.440 --> 46:50.520]  who are pro-democracy and and westernized happy to talk to them the the more
[46:50.520 --> 46:54.280]  Islamic-oriented people aren't going to talk to them because that would bring
[46:54.280 --> 46:59.160]  into question our air support for them so this is a this is a mission that's
[46:59.160 --> 47:04.360]  a very difficult one and the chances of success are really probably not better
[47:04.360 --> 47:09.200]  than 50-50 what's the alternative if we don't arm the rebels and they're clearly
[47:09.200 --> 47:14.680]  outmanned and outgunned by Qaddafi's forces what's the better solution here
[47:14.680 --> 47:19.120]  the better solution was as mr. Paul said never go at all this was none of our
[47:19.120 --> 47:23.480]  business but I think what we're seeing is the string is playing out we threatened
[47:23.480 --> 47:27.800]  Qaddafi and that didn't work there's an arms embargo in an economic embargo that
[47:27.800 --> 47:32.880]  didn't work there was a UN resolution and that didn't work aerial bombing has
[47:32.880 --> 47:37.520]  continued and has impact but it hasn't defeated them now we're at the stage
[47:37.520 --> 47:42.920]  where we're going to try to apparently try to train and arm the resistance that
[47:42.920 --> 47:48.040]  takes a long time I don't know if we have that time against Qaddafi what what
[47:48.040 --> 47:52.520]  we're seeing is the president being put it putting himself into a corner where
[47:52.520 --> 47:57.240]  his only option is ground troops but that's something that is not sir this
[47:57.240 --> 47:59.920]  that's something that no one says that they want to do they're already there I
[47:59.920 --> 48:02.960]  mean they simply don't want to do that they want well they don't well the the
[48:02.960 --> 48:07.000]  choice may come down to admitting that it was a mistake in being defeated in the
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.760]  sense that Qaddafi survives or putting ground troops in nations are a lot like
[48:11.760 --> 48:17.000]  people they don't like making this admitting to mistakes and maybe they
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.840]  don't want to put them in but when it comes down to looking defeat in the
[48:19.840 --> 48:23.520]  face I wonder you know you let CCA's unit the tract of some have been logged
[48:23.520 --> 48:30.000]  in 1996 to 1999 and you believe that much like that situation America's
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.160]  involvement in Libya could prove to be a recruiting tool for extremists why oh
[48:34.160 --> 48:39.080]  it's absolutely a recruiting tool it's it's the American led west attacking a
[48:39.080 --> 48:42.480]  Muslim country that has a very careful to say it's not the American led west
[48:42.480 --> 48:47.520]  that NATO is now fully taken over the operations power was used in the
[48:47.520 --> 48:51.600]  beginning but that this is a coalition that includes Arab states that may fool
[48:51.600 --> 48:55.840]  some Americans it's not going to fool the people who sympathize with bin Laden
[48:55.840 --> 49:00.880]  and other Islamists this is really a US led operation and you talk about the
[49:00.880 --> 49:04.120]  Arab states that are involved the Arab states are tyrannies that are hated
[49:04.120 --> 49:08.640]  by their own people this is a this is a piece of theater set up by Mrs. Clinton
[49:08.640 --> 49:12.680]  and Mrs. Mr. McCain and that the bipartisan group that loves to intervene
[49:12.680 --> 49:18.880]  abroad in the Muslim world this is Americans killing Muslims again and it
[49:18.880 --> 49:22.240]  looks like it's for oil I just want to ask are you trying to have it both ways
[49:22.240 --> 49:24.560]  and saying that okay these are tyrannies that hate their own people well
[49:24.560 --> 49:27.800]  that's why we're helping because in Libya it was the people that wanted
[49:27.800 --> 49:32.720]  Gaddafi out that they were tired of it so weren't we then supporting Islamic
[49:32.720 --> 49:35.640]  democracy I guess you could see in these countries where they're tired of
[49:35.640 --> 49:40.240]  totalitarian rule if we were supporting Islamic democracy that would be one thing
[49:40.240 --> 49:43.680]  but if you listen to Mrs. Clinton and especially the red rather crazed Ms.
[49:43.680 --> 49:48.200]  Rice at the UN this is all about democracy in a world where democracy is
[49:48.200 --> 49:52.040]  not going to take hold I think it's very clear Michael Scheuer that you are no
[49:52.040 --> 49:56.520]  fan of this policy and this administration I think calling Ambassador
[49:56.520 --> 50:01.960]  Rice crazed is is certainly a significant charge I don't know I've
[50:01.960 --> 50:04.800]  just listened to her you know that's only my impression and I have to say
[50:04.800 --> 50:09.240]  this is not a democratic problem this is a Republican problem too both parties
[50:09.240 --> 50:13.760]  love to intervene in other people's business where there are no US interests
[50:13.760 --> 50:17.840]  at stake and where we spend enormous amounts of money at a time when we're
[50:17.840 --> 50:21.880]  nearly bankrupt that doesn't seem to me to be a wise practice of American
[50:21.880 --> 50:25.800]  statesmanship that's a whole other story that we to call the United States
[50:25.800 --> 50:28.600]  bankrupt the United States is running humongous deficits yes but the economy
[50:28.600 --> 50:33.160]  and this mission in Libya are two separate issues they're not separate
[50:33.160 --> 50:36.120]  issues ma'am you're just carrying the water for mr. Obama I'm certainly not
[50:36.120 --> 50:39.840]  carrying anyone's water and that and I will assure you that Michael Scheuer

[51:14.000 --> 51:18.280]  of Americans becoming homeless all caused by the devalued US dollar while

[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.000]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.920]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.920]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:23.480]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.480]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:31.280]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.960]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.280]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:06.760]  recently that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:11.280]  Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:14.680]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:18.360]  getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun

[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.240]  new book that just officially came out today is already making its way to the
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.240]  top of Amazon and the top of the New York Times best-seller list you want to

[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:09.240]  and I've loved all these books and I've read them all from Don't Start the
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:14.080]  Revolution without me you know to his latest book but I got to tell you this
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.880]  book is his most powerful and it's a coffee table page turner it's something
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.720]  to give somebody because it's all 63 documents that are public that are
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.280]  declassified that are admitted but a lot of them nobody knows about it's got the
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.800]  big ones like Northwood's and paperclip but it's got the others at the bottom of
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.800]  the hour we're gonna walk through some of what Jesse thinks are the top ten or
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:39.480]  so in the book available at infowars.com or the website we ain't got
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.640]  time to bleed.com and he's here for just a week doing a limited tour and then

[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.400]  president what's his view on his suit against the TSA and mounting resistance
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:55.960]  to it we've got a host of things his is TV show coming back I've got the inside
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.200]  scoop here but he'll give it to you live on air for everybody out there but
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.400]  before we go there governor again just want to welcome you to the airwaves and
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.920]  glad you're back in the U.S. well it's great to be back if only temporarily and
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:11.000]  you know but I need to get back to Mexico quick because I'm losing my
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.880]  son camp now I want to just run through a grab bag of laundry list of things
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.360]  we're gonna the really big issues you were telling me during the break you
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.160]  didn't know about Libya for a week you didn't know about the earthquake for a
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.160]  week tell us what it's like down in Mexico and then your view on Libya your
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:54.280]  view on the earthquake and the ongoing radioactive fallout
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:59.760]  every year because of how to reinvigorate you as you'll see I'm reinvigorated
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.120]  right now and when I permanently come back to the U.S. and may I'll be ready to
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.480]  roll even more but I'm getting old now so I gotta take those breaks and grab on
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.560]  the ladder occasionally and enjoy the ocean and everything like it down there
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:17.500]  and I really in fact I'll tell you this Alex my wife and I were considering
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:22.400]  applying for Mexican citizenship really yeah no and that doesn't mean I'm
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:36.200]  giving up my U.S. citizenship you can have dual citizenship well it's
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.240]  obviously a beautiful country I've been all over it but it is in many cases a
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.000]  failed state I've read the area you're in is a lot safer than other areas but
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:58.760]  are you ever concerned about the country completely collapsing into bedlam oh see
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:07.920]  the governor of the bar how are you serious I think they love you down
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:25.400]  there well expanding on that you've been outspoken about this and all the
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:29.600]  experts that look at a degree if they decriminalize drugs the destabilization
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.800]  of Mexico would end overnight but they don't want to decriminalize them because
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:40.560]  it just came out in Bloomberg 376 billion in drug money laundered by Wacovia and
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:52.040]  Wells Fargo really no you know when we went into you know when the Taliban went
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:57.640]  into Afghanistan they said poppy growers and the drug lords over there and you
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.960]  know that money gets channeled right to laundered right to the international
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:07.200]  banks and maybe that played a major role in the you know the bank downturn in the
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.840]  bailout that we have to do here in the United States because they weren't
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.000]  getting their illegal drug money and of course now that the U.S. is back in there
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  and our allies seem to be the drug dealers of Afghanistan I guess the poppy
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.520]  business is up and running good again and the banks are getting silent again
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:28.200]  and your book does get into some of that as well the 63 documents the
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.760]  government doesn't want you to read looking at the Libya situation it turns
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:38.200]  out that al-Qaeda according to even the Washington Post is the core of the
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.520]  rebels now being armed by the West just like they armed them against the Serbs
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.760]  just like the West armed them against the Russians
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:14:01.320]  absolutely governor what's your view
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.680]  well it's like 1984 one day we're at war with them the next day we aren't but
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.120]  yeah we're fighting him in Afghanistan Pakistan Iraq and the rebel leader even
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:16.280]  admits that he sent al-Qaeda to Iraq to quote kill U.S. soldiers that was the
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:19.880]  headline last week but now he's our gallant little ally what do you think's
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:43.480]  happening in Libya maybe the trillions in oil
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:15:04.680]  the
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:12.680]  It hurts me and tames me to say that, being a United States veteran, that it seems that
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.680]  our military doesn't really work for us.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.680]  They work for whatever the corporations want them to do.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.680]  Well, that's four years now.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.680]  And on the Ivory Coast, the rebels admittedly have killed a thousand innocent people, so
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:31.180]  the French have now invaded on the West Coast of Africa to back up the rebels overthrowing
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.180]  the government.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:36.180]  What looks like the start of an invasion of the African continent to me?
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:41.680]  I don't know, you know, they're obviously, you know, they know things that they're certainly
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:46.680]  not letting us know, and I suppose we'll have to go on another document search to try to
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.680]  figure out what exactly they are doing.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:52.680]  You know what I found unbelievable doing this book, Alex?
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:58.180]  Do you know how many documents the United States government last year classified top
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.180]  secret?
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:02.180]  I know it's got to be in the hundreds of thousands.
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:04.180]  Try 16 million.
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:05.180]  Whoa.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:10.180]  I mean, that's got to be every document the government puts out.
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:15.180]  16 million documents were classified top secret.
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:20.180]  Well, you notice that Obama promised to have the most transparent government ever, and
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:25.180]  now he's had more secret meetings at the Winehouse, classified more stuff than even Bush.
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:29.180]  I'll tell you what else he's doing that is actually worse than Bush, too.
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:33.180]  He's being harsher on whistleblowers than Bush is.
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:39.180]  Eric Holder is way more harsh on whistleblowers than even the Bush administration was.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.180]  And they're continuing the torture, the secret arrest.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:44.180]  He just reauthorized the Patriot Act.
[01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.180]  That is unbelievable.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.180]  I mean, we cover that in the intro of my book.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:56.180]  This thing violates our Constitution in half a dozen places, and yet, why does our country
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:58.180]  in a reserved Supreme Court here?
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:04.180]  You know, our country was set up before father, so that a president and a congress cannot
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:10.180]  simply pass a law and have it succeed the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.180]  You've got to go through hoops.
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:17.180]  You've got to change the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, and that itself requires
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:20.180]  ratification by torture to the states.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:22.180]  None of this is being done.
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:27.180]  They're violating our Constitution so bad they ought to go to jail.
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.180]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:34.180]  In fact, we saw Obama not even consult Congress three weeks ago when they got the United Nations
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:38.180]  Resolution for the bombardment, the so-called no-fly zone.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:42.180]  And we know U.S. and British special forces have been in there the whole time since when
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:47.180]  does the president not even consult Congress before at least Bush would get some type of
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:49.180]  authorization of force?
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:53.180]  Well, you know, but even that, they do after the fact.
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:59.180]  You know, they passed that law way back in the 70s, and they're violating the hell out of it.
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:04.180]  I'll tell you what, Alex, when I'm in Mexico, I don't even call us the United States of
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.180]  America anymore.
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.180]  Do you know what I refer to as?
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.180]  The faster states of America.
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:12.180]  Everybody in this country thinks we're going to socialists.
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.180]  No, we're not.
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:19.180]  We're fascist because the basic definition of fascism is when corporations and organized
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:22.180]  religion team up to control the government.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:27.180]  Well, you're absolutely on target there, and I've noticed how they're making it all about
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:30.180]  cutting unions and cutting spending, which is great.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:34.180]  But all the economists I've interviewed have pointed out the 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives,
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:39.180]  if we don't say no to Wall Street's trillions of debt they've created that they've gotten
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:45.180]  government to sign on to and bail out, then there's no way we could cut everything and
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:49.180]  it wouldn't even pay for a fraction of the debt that we've been signed on to.
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:55.180]  Well, I get a laugh out of it that you've got all these Republican new governors out there
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:19:00.180]  that are literally destroying the unions, the public unions and all that stuff, and laying
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:04.180]  the financial blame on the family.
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:08.180]  What, because some union asked for a dollar and an hour?
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:14.180]  Give me a break, and yet nobody on Wall Street has gone to prison over this mess, and yet
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:19.180]  they're going to now hit the blame and try to make the public believe it's unions that
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.180]  are at first.
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:25.180]  Exactly, and we've got a leg chopped off and the media is focusing in on a hangnail.
[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.180]  Exactly.
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:31.180]  That's a good way to put it, they're focusing in on a hangnail, and we've got a leg chopped
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:33.180]  off, a good way to say it.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:37.180]  Well, you're absolutely right, Governor, that this is a bait and switch.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:42.180]  I'm not even saying that these unions, some of them aren't, you know, a little bit entitled.
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:47.180]  Well, of course, you've got to understand, unions can get overbearing too, but I'll tell
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:51.180]  you what, if you want to destroy the middle class, destroy the unions.
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:55.180]  And they've done that, and the middle class is falling apart, and now the unions are
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:59.180]  basically just Democratic Party attack dogs to collect dues for them.
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:04.180]  Exactly, and they're not even honest, because I can give you a complete example on that,
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:10.180]  and when I ran for governor of Minnesota, May shunked my lieutenant governor and I with
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:15.180]  the only two vested union members in the race, and we didn't get one union endorsement.
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:17.180]  Yeah, the unions...
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.180]  Right, right, right, right to the Democrats.
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:23.180]  The unions were taken over from within a long time ago.
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.180]  President Turra, let's get into...
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:30.180]  Let me up, not the union itself, just the union leadership.
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:35.180]  Because I went to one union meeting with the rank and file, so that I was there to
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:40.180]  endorse me, and yet their leadership threw that out, and the endorsement went to skip
[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:43.180]  Humphrey.
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:48.180]  So they've taken over the full spectrum of the Republicans and Democrats and all these
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:52.180]  major institutions that were set up to serve the people in our interest.
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.180]  Now we've got special interest.
[01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:58.180]  Let's talk about your Good Morning America interview where you kicked off your tour this morning.
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:01.180]  The headline is Vice President Ventura.
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.180]  Clarify your position.
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:05.180]  I know Ron Paul's going to see this or hear this later.
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:09.180]  Many other congressmen are actually tuning in right now because they've told me they
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.180]  listened at lunch at the Capitol.
[01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:16.180]  Tell your message to Ron Paul dealing with the fact that you're willing to run as his
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:17.180]  Vice President.
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:22.180]  One minute now, I never said that, I never said who would be President or Vice President.
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:25.180]  Ron and I may have to flip the coin.
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:28.180]  I just said I would run with them.
[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:31.180]  But no, I'm just having fun with you, Alex.
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:32.180]  No.
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:37.180]  In fact, this book, 63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to See, if you look at it,
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:40.180]  I dedicated the book to Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:46.180]  And I did that because he was the only Congressman we have that had the courage to go out on
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:51.180]  the floor of the Congress and support WikiLeaks.
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:55.180]  Like Ron Paul said, he said nobody's died from WikiLeaks.
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:22:01.180]  How many people have died from the trumped-up intelligence and the lying that got us into
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:02.180]  the Iraq War?
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:05.180]  And then he said something even more profound.
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.180]  And that was this.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:13.180]  He talked about in a free country like ours, when the trust equals treason, we're in big
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.180]  trouble.
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.180]  And that's what in essence they're saying.
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.180]  If you tell the truth, you're guilty of treason.
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:26.180]  And I'll tell you, if that's been prevailing sat in this nation today, we are hurting.
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:32.180]  And so, no, I just said that if Ron Paul equipped the Republican Party, because I will not run
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:36.180]  as a Democrat or Republican, I want nothing to do with these parties.
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:39.180]  They are the problem, they are not the solution.
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:44.180]  They are the ones that have been in control of this country, like Ralph Nader calls us
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.180]  the two-party dictatorship.
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:49.180]  They are the ones that have us in this mess.
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:52.180]  They are the ones that have caused all the debt problems.
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:56.180]  Everything serves to the Democrats and the Republicans.
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.180]  And it's time to throw them out.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:03.180]  The people of this country can do a major thing, and it's so easy.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:08.180]  It's as clear as the nose on your face that most people can't see at the old crochet.
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.180]  You can't see the forest or the trees.
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:16.180]  The next election, vote for any Republicans or Democrats.
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:25.180]  That would be the greatest thing that could happen in this country is to break down and destroy these two political parties that we have.
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:34.180]  Now, I stated that if Ron Paul would equip the Republican Party, and if he asked me, I would give serious consideration for running with him.
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:36.180]  Now, will he equip the Republicans?
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:41.180]  I have no idea, but that's what it would take, because I will not run as a Republican.
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:43.180]  I will not run as a Democrat.
[01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:47.180]  I want nothing to do with these two parties.
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:54.180]  Governor Jesse Ventura, of course, host of the hit investigative show, Conspiracy Theory.
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:58.180]  Ron Paul's view, and I've talked about this on air and off air privately with him.
[01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:03.180]  He's obviously a libertarian, ran as a libertarian in the late 80s, only got a fraction of the vote.
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:16.180]  His view is, use the Republican Party apparatus, the fundraising engine, the fact that they're already in all 50 states, that they have the boots on the ground, that he thinks the best chance to win is through that system.
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:18.180]  He certainly doesn't like the two parties.
[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:20.180]  He decries the two parties.
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:24.180]  But Alex, he won't get the Republican nomination.
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.180]  He has to understand that.
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:31.180]  The Republicans are not going to put Ron Paul up as the presidential nominee.
[01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:40.180]  I think you're right at a certain point, because even Ronald Reagan was too conservative in 1980, and it was on record that they ordered him.
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:42.180]  They said, we don't care if you've won.
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:51.180]  We're not going to nominate you, even though you've been winning in these states, unless you put George Herbert Walker Bush, Mr. CIA in there, who really became the shadow president.
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:25:02.180]  Exactly, and that's my point, you know, all due respect to Ron Paul, but I don't believe the Republicans would, no matter how many of these he wins, he's too much of a rogue.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:09.180]  He is not brought and sold by the multinational corporations, plus the biggest thing of all.
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:13.180]  He calls for an audit to the Federal Reserve.
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:21.180]  Do you think the Republican or Democratic parties are going to stand for a candidate that demands an audit of the Federal Reserve?
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:24.180]  Well, not in the past, but he did get it passed in the House.
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:26.180]  They use a procedural to block it in the Senate.
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:31.180]  His son, Rand, who we've interviewed many times, has now been traveling to Iowa in places.
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:33.180]  Looks like he may be getting ready for a run.
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:35.180]  But here's the headline.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:45.180]  Paul Bid wouldn't get snubbed this time. That's out of a big syndicated column in papers all over the country, also in the register.
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:48.180]  We've got a lot of reports here.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:52.180]  Obama has now announced, obviously, that he's going to be running again.
[01:25:52.180 --> 01:26:04.180]  Speaking of Obama, I mean, isn't this somebody who should be impeached for reauthorizing the Patriot Act, expanding the wars, breaking all of his promises?
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:15.180]  I mean, so many Democrats who are still supporting him in the Democratic Party, they ought to apologize now, because if they criticize Bush, who needed to be criticized, now they're discredited.
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:22.180]  Well, I agree with you, but the point is, if you're going to impeach Obama, you should have impeached Bush and Cheney.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:23.180]  Yes.
[01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:36.180]  You know, absolutely, because they're the ones that set the tables around this stuff. They destroyed the economy, they put us in both the wars, they originated the Patriot Act, which is so outrageous.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:48.180]  I cover that in my book, how many places it totally violates our bill of rights, you know, and so, you know, to me, it's a case of, they won't impeach anybody, are you kidding me?
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:53.180]  If they didn't impeach Bush and Cheney, they're certainly not going to impeach Obama.
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:57.180]  But you would support impeachment hearings in the House?
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:01.180]  Not really, because who do you get then? You get Biden.
[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:02.180]  Oh, he's really bad, yeah.
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:08.180]  You know, I mean, come on, you know, you could hurt yourself by doing that.
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:10.180]  Well, you still got to bring him to justice.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:21.180]  He lets him impeach these guys by voting them out of office next election, both Democrats and Republicans. That's the way to impeach them, don't vote for them.
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:37.180]  Governor, looking now at the TSA situation, I have the report here, ABC News, Feds want Ventura suit against TSA thrown out, but they've got a problem, at least nine states passing laws and preparing to pass laws saying it's illegal that a peace officer
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:42.180]  can't stick their hand down your pants. How can some minimum wage goon do it?
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:51.180]  Break down your view on the building resistance to the TSA, and I just want to thank you as well for putting yourself out on the field yet again with this lawsuit.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:57.180]  Well, you know, that's what I'm doing. I want a ruling from a federal judge. They want it thrown out.
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:28:12.180]  Well, that's fine in them. That's what they have the right to do. But if the judge throws it out, that will be a clear sign to early American people that the Constitution and Bill's rights are meaningless now.
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:30.180]  Because of the fact, Alex, I don't want to sound, I don't know what to say, but this suit only involves me. It is not a class action suit or anything of the sort, because the Bill's rights are rights for each one of us as individuals.
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:47.180]  And what my suit is, in essence, is I'm suing them on Fourth Amendment, which is reasonable search and seizure. I'm stating that it is not reasonable to believe that Governor Jesse Ventura, a former governor, a former mayor, a six-year Navy veteran,
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:29:03.180]  honorably discharged, and I've been flying for 40 years that I pose any type of threat. I'm not asking for money or any such damages, or I'm asking them to do this. Stop. Stop searching me.
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:21.180]  Because in my case, we have seen it. Alex, we were in the airport together in Atlanta. I have metal in my body. So when I go through the metal detector, I could go through it naked and it's going to go rough, which then subjects me to the sexual groping or the X-ray machine.
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:38.180]  Well, this summer I'm doing my TV show. I'm traveling, flying four, three, four times a week. They cannot tell me that they have definitive proof that going into that X-ray machine four times a week for six months would not have negative effects.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:50.180]  Governor, stay there. We got to go to break. Let's come back and finish up with that, with the TSA. Then get into the book and a lot more, infowars.com, folks. We're interviewing former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura. We'll talk about the TV show as well.
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:30:00.180]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:32.180]  He's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM. Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:43.180]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:31:00.180]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica. The number three.com. Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica3.com.

[01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:08.180]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:13.180]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:19.180]  I've turned a nervous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:24.180]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:34.180]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:41.180]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:48.180]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:59.180]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:26.180]  63 documents the government doesn't want you to read. We're going to segue into the book, which, again, I'm not just typing this.
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:33.180]  This is the book to give somebody to wake them up, because it's 63 documents, and it's like eating popcorn.
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:39.180]  You want to go to the next one, the next one, the next one, and you just learn more and more, and there's the 100% proof.
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:49.180]  This is not speculation. The book is available at infowars.com. Just count it out of the gates or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:53.180]  You can also get Mark Dice's new book, Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True, with it.
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:34:00.180]  When you get the two books together, you can get one of my films free, whichever film you choose, at infowars.com.
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:15.180]  Now, getting into the TSA, think about it, folks. Now they're announcing from Tennessee to New York, National Guard, TSA, Viper teams, federal marshals, bus stations, highways, train stations, sticking their hands down pants there.
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:22.180]  That's all over the news. 9,000 locations, Mall of America, Walmarts, putting in big telescreens, and we've now got footage.
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:27.180]  We've now shot footage of these going in saying, watch your neighbors. Don't trust people.
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:36.180]  That's directly out of 1984. When I watched the mid-80s film that's written by Stephen King that's so powerful, The Running Man, with Jesse Ventura and Schwarzenegger.
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:46.180]  When they're creeping around in the city, Schwarzenegger is trying to hide out from Ventura. You see big billboards saying, hey, kids, October is bonus recruitment month.
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:56.180]  Report a family member and get a double bonus. This is directly out of 1984, and now they've set the precedent to stick their hands down your pants.
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:35:04.180]  They've done it to Ron Paul. They say that he's been groped. They've grabbed his genitals. We've had guests on where they go in the pants, and they admit this.
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:15.180]  And I've had district attorneys, the one from San Francisco on, saying he's got officers in there. If he sees them doing it, he's going to prosecute them because a cop can't pull you over and stick their hands down your pants unless it's an emergency.
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:27.180]  So, Governor, I want to finish up with your lawsuit, but then I want to ask you, what do you think of the expansion to TSA on the streets where you pull up to a checkpoint and they want to now drive you under radiation machines?
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:35.180]  And they admit that they haven't calibrated the machines, and it's many times more radiation than they'd first said. Governor, breaking down your lawsuit.
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:47.180]  Well, again, Alex, the other thing that's interesting about my last suit, and again, it's only for me, you know, and I'm stating that it is. I pose no threat, and therefore they're violating my fourth amendment.
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:36:00.180]  But here's what's interesting. Certain members of our elected people, and I'm not talking the president here because he's got his own plane, but certain members of our elected, they don't have to submit to this.
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:16.180]  The Speaker of the House does not have to submit to what you and I have to. Now, I challenge, and I don't know for sure, maybe you can help me, but I know Nancy Pelosi never served in the military, and I don't think Boehner did either, did he?
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:36.180]  No.
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:52.180]  Well, Governor, you're absolutely right. But more than just the fact that Pelosi and Obama, they're now a computer. Absolutely, Boehner and as many as 15 members of the House and Senate are now exempt.
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:37:07.180]  They've been videotaped just being waved around security. Here's my question. Is this not bonafide two-tier class system where they are exempt from their own bureaucracy that they're foisting on us, Governor?
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:26.180]  Absolutely. You want to hear another good one, Alex? Initially, I was going to sue under the Federal Disabilities Act, right? Because because of the metal in my body, I'm disabled. And that says to accommodate my disability, well, what's happening is they're exploiting my disability.
[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:40.180]  They get this, get this. One week later, my attorney calls me back and says, we can't sue under the American Disabilities Act. And I said, why not? He goes, it doesn't apply to the federal government.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:38:07.180]  Unbelievable.
[01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:20.180]  Here's an example of that. Obama has now handed out thousands of waivers to McDonald's and their hundreds of thousands of employees alone. But to thousands of companies that are campaign donors, they get a waiver and don't have to buy health insurance.
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:36.180]  But your hamburger place or your restaurant next door, you've got to buy the insurance. That's a true form of economic discrimination here where the imperial federal government hands out favors to those that basically bribe them.
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:48.180]  No, it's horrible. It's horrible, Alex. And like I said, I would love to get on TV with John Boehner and ask him point blank, how are you more patriotic than me?
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:39:03.180]  Well, and let me let this, when I won mayor, Alex, and when I won governor, you've had a call with the title Honorable. Well, an honorable person should not have to be searched today.
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:19.180]  Well, as American citizens under the Fourth Amendment, we all are honorable and innocent until proven guilty. But but but now 99% of us are guilty until proven innocent. But if you're a big shot currently in government, you're then exempt.
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:21.180]  I mean, that's classical tyranny.
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:36.180]  Yeah. And the thing that why most people are perturbed over this naturally is because, you know, like in the old days for me, I could pass through the metal detector by simply taking all the metal out of my pockets and putting on the thing and you're on your way.
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:47.180]  But in the case of anyone that's had prosthesis surgery like I have, and you have metal in your body, you're now discriminated against because you have to go get surgery so you could survive.
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:40:03.180]  Well, what about the guy with the urine bag that they pulled off his body, his his his his medical prosthesis, what about I've seen it, I would imagine you fly out, you've seen it where old ladies that can't walk are made to get up out of their wheelchairs.
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:05.180]  Yeah, I mean, it's absurd.
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:13.180]  It's utterly and you know, it's interesting, Alex, what if they caught someone that would be headlines.
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:18.180]  Well, you know, they got the underwear bomber the US government ordered him to be allowed on the plane.
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:40.180]  Yeah, exactly. And who's they caught? Nobody. Nobody. I mean, do they really think the terrorists are going to attack us in the identical same way? I mean, when I was in SEAL team, we were trained never to do anything white. You know, when you go in one way, you come out another way if you can, like in the daytime.
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:54.180]  If you run ops at night, you always test fire your weapons every day. That way you're not setting any pattern. If you only test fire your weapons on the day you're going out on an op, well, that becomes easy to predict when.
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:41:07.180]  So you test fire your weapons every day. That way you don't set patterns. And do they really believe the terrorists are so stupid they try the same thing again? If indeed the terrorists actually did it?
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:20.180]  Well, Governor, does this not set the precedent, though, that they can put federal forces on highways, at bus terminals, at train stations, at airports, under this omnipresent threat?
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:32.180]  And then we learn that Amaral Alaki, Fox News headline in October, the number two in Al Qaeda, meeting secretly at the Pentagon while he is on the wanted list. Did you see that report?
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:34.180]  No, I did not. Not at all.
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:48.180]  If guys put that Amaral Alaki dying secretly at the Pentagon report up and that got leaked and they confirmed it was real, I mean, Governor, you've talked about 9-11, the explosives clearly in the towers, all the evidence of that.
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:52.180]  I mean, more and more 9-11 is the pretext of destroy our liberties.
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:42:07.180]  Well, it's interesting now we can segue to the book a little here, Alex. We print the NIST report on Building 7. Will they admit it? They admit Building 7 was demoed. Do you know how they admit it?
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:27.180]  They said that it went in the total free file for this many seconds, well, but it had to be demoed because otherwise they're defying Nootar's law of gravity physics. The only way a building like that can go in the total free file, which says in the NIST report, is perhaps is to have our resistance removed.
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:32.180]  And the only way you can remove the resistance is for demolition.
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:43.180]  Well, you're absolutely right. And for eight years they tried to say that there was no free fall until the videos forced them to prove the fact that it did fall.
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:43:00.180]  They could prove it. They could put it on the stop latch. The building fell as fast as I would jump out of an airplane in free fall. And the stop latch will tell you that because you can calculate it simply by, you know, the amount of seconds that the building fell and how many feet it fell.
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:02.180]  It's just simple mathematics.
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:23.180]  And we did the timing for eight plus years and they said we were conspiracy theorists, but later when they were confronted with it, they had to admit, yes, it fell at free fall and every demolition expert out there, including yourself in the underwater demolition team will tell you that you would have a asymmetrical collapse if it was caused by fire.
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:26.180]  And that itself had never happened until 9-11.
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:46.180]  Exactly. So, you know, here's the government's documents admitting the building, in my opinion, was demoed. And then, of course, we also, we go into 9-11, I deferred an entire chapter, of course, we go into the, which is something I'm sure you're well aware of, the Pentagon standout order.
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:44:08.180]  I want to talk about that in a moment. Let me just read some of the 63 documents that are in this book and that are broken down. I mean, you talk about a well written book. I mean, this thing 100% proves just how criminal the shadowy organizations that Fletcher Proudy wrote about and just how out of control and hubris filled they are.
[01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:28.180]  You have our scandalous post-war history, that's 11 of the documents, government military and corporate secrets, that's another 15 documents or so, shady White House, another 10 documents, you've got part 4, 9-11, a think tank anticipation of 9-11, FBI knowledge of terrorist training at flight schools,
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:45.180]  fraud and determined to strike in U.S., Bush told, lied about it, the Pentagon standout order, the Free Fall Building 7, evidence for insider stock trading, the FBI's briefing on trading and the 9-11 commission, then you go into the war on terror and another 13 documents there and then an epilogue.
[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:58.180]  I mean, Jesse, I've never, and I'm not just saying this because I didn't say this about your other books and they were excellent, I've never seen a book this jam-packed, busting at the seams, one of these points discredits the shadow government COG system.
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:14.180]  You've got 63 of them and the way you put them together, everybody has got to get this book and give it to doubting Thomas' that they know. I mean, Jesse, you have engaged in a quantum leap with this book. I mean, I don't think anybody's ever put something together like this.
[01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:27.180]  Well, you know, I'm very proud of it. You know, Dick Russell and I worked extremely hard and really Dick deserves the great credit on the research because, Alex, I don't have the patience, you know me. I'm not going to sit down at the patience to research others.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:43.180]  So, my partner Dick Russell, that's why we're a great team. Dick is phenomenal at doing this research. He finds the documents that he presents them to me and of course I get shocked when I read the documents and then of course the book is me commenting and writing about the documents.
[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:54.180]  But as I said, every document is reprinted in this book so the reader doesn't have to take my opinion or the reader can actually read the documents themselves.
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:46:17.180]  This should be required reading in every high school, every university, every police chief, anyone who's ever been in denial. The way it's so well written, the way it's so well blurbed and factoided on each piece. Starting at page 38, you've got Operation Northwoods or actually document 38 and then you turn the page.
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:42.180]  That's the US government plan to stage 9-11 style attacks. Then, once you've read that document, you get to something that we first found and dug out in 2004 and put in my film, Marshall Law, you have the stand down order to Cheney given over to Rumsfeld to change NORAD's preparation to shoot down Aaron Aircraft.
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:47.180]  You were trying to get to that, Governor, break it down.
[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:41.180]  And Cheney was hiding out of the bunker and lied and said he got there 45 minutes later than he had.
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:56.180]  But Norman Panetta, the head of transportation, confirmed in five separate interviews and before Congress that Cheney was lying about being in there and saying the order still stood to basically not shoot down Flight 77 coming into the Pentagon.
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:22.180]  And here is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff order for the stand down from June 1 issued under the Vice President's orders through Rumsfeld and then right after 9-11, they rescinded their previous order and went back to the old shoot down directive where the generals didn't have to get authorization before they shot down on Aaron Aircraft and they were begging that day, let us shoot them down, but they wouldn't give them the order.
[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:35.180]  What can you say? It just clears the nose on your face and like I said, if there's less to doubt, read it yourself. You can read the orders yourself and you'll see what happened.
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:46.180]  The other thing that really, the document that really bothered me too, Alex, is the first one. The CIA's secret assassination manual.
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:56.180]  Now, assassination is just a nice word for first degree murder because it's preplanned and it's generally politically inclined.
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:49:11.180]  Now, how can our government have a manual, a printed manual on how to commit first degree murder when as far as I know, murder is illegal in every country in the world and yet we have a manual.
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:24.180]  And wait till you read this thing, all your viewers out there, if they read it. I mean, it tells, you know, what type of person they'll recruit to do the murders, what his mindset should be, what are the problems you have?
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:33.180]  You should laugh at it. Like they say throwing people out of buildings or high places is excellent because there's so much possible denial.
[01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:46.180]  Now, look, I tend to think I know it all, but the older I get, I know how much I don't know. Reading your book, we got it three weeks ago but couldn't start shipping it until this week, I couldn't put it down.
[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:54.180]  I ended up staying up till about three in the morning, started at about nine at night, wasn't done until three in the morning reading the whole book and there were a lot of documents that I'd never seen.
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:50:10.180]  I went and looked them up on the National Archives and there they were declassified. This is a literal rosetta stone to understand the criminal pathology of this Anglo-American secret team rogue network group that Fletcher Proudy wrote about.
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:23.180]  And talking to you four or five months ago, the last time you were on, Governor, you talked about Proudy and his view into the world and I see a lot of Proudy's understanding overall, almost like his spirit is hanging over this book.
[01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:36.180]  Well, I hope so because to me, Fletcher Proudy, Colonel Proudy was a great American. He served his country honorably and he saw what things were wrong and he wasn't afraid to come out and write about them.
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:47.180]  Even though his one book, The Secret Team, back in 72, when he first initially printed that one, it was censored. Every time they do a printing, the U.S. government would buy up every copy.
[01:50:47.180 --> 01:51:00.180]  63 documents in full with all of the supporting documentation. Very well written. 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read at infowars.com. Get it. Get it out to everybody. Unlock minds.

[01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:09.180]  Dr. David Berry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound money. It's certainly worth reading.

[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:46.180]  Some of the other things are about that. They're not just economic, they're philosophical, there's psychology involved in this book, there's philosophy involved in this book.

[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:17.180]  You know, I'd forgotten to bring up how is he doing his book tour if he won't fly on commercial planes, and the governor said, hey, final segment, you got to have me tell folks about this.
[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:27.180]  He's a man of his word. How is he going to do the TV show this season? So let me segue with that. How are you getting around the country if you're not flying and going through the Gestapo blockade?
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:30.180]  And is the TV show coming back for another hit season?
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:45.180]  Well, first of all, I'm getting around the country because I inform my publishers, of course, of the last suit they're well aware of it. So I cannot get on a commercial airliner because if I get on a commercial airliner, it'll pretty much null and void my last suit.
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:55:03.180]  So I cannot fly, so I am actually flying in a private jet because if you're flying a private jet, you know, out of the rich people, they don't have to be subjected to any of the normal stuff at the airport. In a private jet, you go through nothing whatsoever to check you.
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:14.180]  Well, it's like Rosa Parks. She said, I'm not sitting at the back of the bus. You're saying you're not going to stick your hands in my pants or grab my, you know, my Johnson. I mean, that makes perfect sense.
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:17.180]  This is bigger than Rosa Parks having to sit at the back of the bus.
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:40.180]  Well, I don't know, but I'm not going to stand for it. You know, Alex, for those out there, and I know there are probably not many of you listeners, but many people attack me over this book, like insinuating I'm somehow a traitor, you know, for exposing government documents. I had a few of these radio guys subtly accuse me of that.
[01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:51.180]  Let me read a quote from Patrick Henry, and we all know Patrick Henry's most famous quote was, give me liberty or give me death. But here's another quote from Patrick Henry, so I'm in good company.
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:56:04.180]  Patrick Henry quote, the liberties of the people never were, nor ever will be secure when the transactions of the rulers may be concealed from them.
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:13.180]  And your book exposes that and is a major torpedo at that line. In closing here, though, just to be sure, because you were telling me privately, it's probably coming back.
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:35.180]  When will we know if the third season's back?
[01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:49.180]  And I know, having worked in Hollywood, you never believe anything's going to happen until it actually does. Everything is looking positive for a third season, but you never know until they officially pick it up.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:57:00.180]  Well, I hope they do, because I'd love the original work you're doing and consulting and also getting to hang out with you. You're such a great patriot, Jesse Ventura always wonderful having you on. Last question, we only got a minute and a half left.
[01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:05.180]  By the way, Alex, I haven't chewed on no cigars since I got a little wet damn box you bought me.
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:12.180]  Well, you did it first by buying me those cigars. Those are some good ones, though. You recommended those. That's not my favorite cigar.
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:17.180]  Oh, it is. It's the Aston cabinet VSG. It's the best cigar on the planet.
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:25.180]  All right. All right. In the minute and a half, we got left. Are you, would you consider running as a third party person with somebody like Ralph Nader or someone else you admire?
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:37.180]  I don't know. Right now, Ron Perr is the best I know, because Ron Perr has the knowledge. Ron Perr thinks a great deal like me, and Ron Perr lets face it, he has the popularity.
[01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:47.180]  You know, if Ron and I are to run together, you've got to have two people that have great, great popularity, and I think we could make a dynamic duo.
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:55.180]  Well, you're absolutely right. That is a match made in victory. What about Donald Trump? He looks like he's going to run. He's got a lot of money.
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:58:02.180]  Yeah, big deal. Donald Trump ain't going to run. I know Donald. Donald rattled his sword 10-12 years ago about running.
[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:17.180]  Donald is a glutton for publicity, and there's nothing wrong with that, but he rattles his sword around all the time that he's going to run. I will be astounded if Donald Trump literally runs. I think your rattle his sword around.
[01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:23.180]  He'll get a ton of publicity, gets to go on all the TV shows and stuff, but I think when Perr comes to he'll run.
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:28.180]  You won't do it. Governor, so you're saying to Ron Paul, you're waiting. You're waiting to get that phone call.
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:32.180]  I just thought I'd give it great consideration.
[01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:38.180]  All right, Governor Ventura, we look forward to talking to you again in May or June. God bless you, and be safe on your turn.

[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:19.180]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:26.180]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:39.180]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:53.180]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:53.180 --> 02:00:00.180]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:13.180]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:31.180]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:39.180]  Okay, in this third hour on the heels of Governor Jesse Ben Turab.
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:44.180]  A lot of breaking news and information about what's going on in his world and his view on things.
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:50.180]  Now that he's left us, I want to open the phones up for the entire next hour.
[02:00:50.180 --> 02:01:02.180]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:11.180]  That said, I was not hyping the fact. You've heard me say his other books are excellent and got a lot of good information.
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:20.180]  But this new book, 63 Documents, the government doesn't want you to read, is particularly powerful and is perfect to wake people up.
[02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:27.180]  It is a page-turner and we are in an information war. You not only support Governor Ben Turab when you purchase it from us,
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:36.180]  you also support our operation, but that's the win-win. The real big win in those two wins is you get further informed and increase your knowledge
[02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:41.180]  and then you can give the book to friends and family.
[02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:47.180]  And I also just want to add that we helped him with the printing cost. We paid to have it printed for Mark Dice.
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:50.180]  He's put out a whole bunch of books, but he's always done print on demand.
[02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:59.180]  And we've tried to help Mark actually do this full time, so I paid to print. 10,000 of Big Brother, the Orwellian Nightmare, come true.
[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:07.180]  And it's, I believe, the best of his four books. Of course, the author of The Resistance Manifesto, and you can get the Orwellian Nightmare come true
[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:17.180]  with Jesse Ventura's book, both of them discounted, and then get a free DVD, Obama Deception, Endgame, Fall the Republic, Invisible Empire.
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:23.180]  You can get it free with these two books when you get the two books, so quite a discount.
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:30.180]  And that also puts fuel in our information warfare coffers to continue the fight against the globalists.
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:38.180]  But I want to hear from you about the fact that they're now dumping this radiation-filled water at 100,000 times safe levels directly in the Pacific.
[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:44.180]  They are saying this could go on for several months before they even figure out how to fix it.
[02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:55.180]  More radiation is drifting over at 181 times safe levels of radioactive iodine, 131, according to universities and state governments that have been doing the testing
[02:02:55.180 --> 02:03:02.180]  at a state slash university facility in Berkeley. Other state facilities are picking up similar readings.
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:08.180]  That's a big deal that it's a footnote the New York Times, and they're not even telling people don't drink milk on the West Coast.
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:16.180]  I know my wife noticed that the brand of organic milk we usually get is from California, and I said, why not pay 30 cents more and get the Texas brand?
[02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:23.180]  And it was actually her idea. I said, that's a good idea. And then I had some of it, and I'm like, this tastes a lot better than this other California brand.
[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:33.180]  I'm sorry, it just does. We got to go to Whole Foods to get it, but the point is, is that I'm not going, I mean, there's no doubt, there's no doubt that many of the cows
[02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:45.180]  are bio accumulating radioactive isotopes, and it's coming out in the milk. That was reported last Wednesday by the San Francisco Chronicle, the Oregonian, you name it, in case you just tuned in.
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:59.180]  There's no debating that. I want to get your views on that as well. Your views on Senator Lindsey Graham, the carbon taxing globalist rhino piece of garbage saying we need to look at restricting free speech in America
[02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:13.180]  because of the Karan burning. I think it's a stupid thing to do. It certainly stirs people up, but you know what? The First Amendment, you got to protect dumb people, and they're right as well as other people, because one person who's dumb is a genius to somebody else,
[02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:25.180]  and free speech is free speech, and we're just more real estate if we don't have that. The globalists are abridging every major section of the First Ten Amendments. We've got to restore the Republic, and that means restoring the Declaration of Independence
[02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:43.180]  Constitution Bill of Rights. I want to get your take on all this. 1-800-259-9231-800259-9231. That was a newsmaking interview with Governor Jesse Ventura. I'm going to make sure it gets posted in its entirety
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:56.180]  at PrismPlanet.tv and then at the Alex Jones channel on YouTube, but you can see it first at PrismPlanet.tv and see it in higher quality and support what we're doing and plus all the films and more at PrismPlanet.tv.

[02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:33.180]  We'll be right back with your phone calls and a ton of news.
[02:05:56.180 --> 02:06:10.180]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:16.180]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[02:06:16.180 --> 02:06:28.180]  The gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their long expected journey to the moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.

[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:44.180]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship. Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.

[02:08:14.180 --> 02:08:34.180]  We're now eight minutes into hour number three. I want to open the phones up. Obviously, the teleprompter reading Puppet, Barack H. Obama, real name Barry Siterro from Indonesia has announced he's going to run again.
[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:52.180]  The coffers of the foreign bankers will fill him with the billion dollars he needs. We've got Lindsey Graham, the U.S. Senator, openly calling for restrictions on the First Amendment because of the Karan burning, saying it hurts our military operations.
[02:08:52.180 --> 02:09:04.180]  Well, then I remember when the first Gulf War started, a neocon talk show hosting arrest protesters, they're hurting the war effort. I mean, these people really don't want freedom in this country. We're the country. We decide.
[02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:18.180]  These wars aren't declared. They're illegal. Al-Qaeda is a globalist banker creation. Our military is used to empower the world government, and our name is destroyed in the process, and our treasure is used up, and we lose our young men and women.
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:30.180]  I'm sick of all this fake, warmongering, moralizing about how they're doing this to Qaddafi because he might have hurt some protesters while their allies in Yemen are mowing people down in Fox News is defending it.
[02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:43.180]  It's absolutely incredible. They are reporting 181 times safe levels of radioactive iodine showing up at the University of Berkeley where they tested the tap water through a state-funded facility.
[02:09:43.180 --> 02:10:02.180]  Similar numbers are coming out in other states on the West Coast. Gold rises to near $1,435 as dollar retreats. Oil climbs. Fed seeks $7 million in privately made Liberty dollars. The feds are now trying to seize Liberty dollars, which are just anybody can go print up their own silver or gold coins.
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:14.180]  There's thousands of different commemorative coin companies, and in the ruling they warn here that this sets the precedent to ban barter or private currency, something cities and others have had.
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:25.180]  And when you go and cash in money at Chuck E. Cheese's to get the little card or whatever, or Dave and Buster's to put $20 in tokens on it, that's a form of alternate money.
[02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:34.180]  I mean, it's just insane. This company been around for 15 years. I've got some Liberty dollars. That's some silver ones that go back to the mid 90s.
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:42.180]  Now they sell for hundreds of dollars for a, you know, one ounce coin because nobody can get them. And they're trying to put them in prison.
[02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:47.180]  So I'm going to be breaking that down as well. Another example of just extreme hubris.
[02:10:47.180 --> 02:10:57.180]  Golf spill company hands out safety bonuses. Company whose rig caused biggest oil spill in U.S. history, rewards executives for best year and safety performance last year when this happened.
[02:10:57.180 --> 02:11:05.180]  Can't make up that hubris. We're also going to be getting into some other important news dealing with the economy.
[02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:10.180]  But right now let's go to your phone calls. David in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:12.180]  Hey, Alex.
[02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:14.180]  Hey, buddy. Yeah, sure am. Right here.
[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:17.180]  All right. Yeah, I was, I was just calling them.
[02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:25.180]  Wanted to tell you, I went to the Bohemian Grove about, I guess it was a few years before you did.
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:29.180]  They, they have weddings there. Have you heard of that?
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:38.180]  When it's not shut down in the month of July, some of the private groups are allowed to have weddings there, I believe with members.
[02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:44.180]  Yeah, yeah. And that's exactly what it was. It was a family member of mine.
[02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:53.180]  And we went in and when you get there, like you said, they loaded us up on those big army trucks and took us to the main point.
[02:11:53.180 --> 02:12:06.180]  And from there, you know, we went to, it's pretty much the main building met like where the bar is and they have a big redwood tree that comes in the middle of the bar out the roof.
[02:12:06.180 --> 02:12:13.180]  And then they took us on a tour of the place and showed us where the atom bomb was supposedly, you know, designed.
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:16.180]  Yeah, that's up on the hilltop, the Chalet building.
[02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:21.180]  Yeah, yeah. And then when, on your episode with that decoded.
[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:22.180]  Yes.
[02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:29.180]  When you guys went, went down that river, they actually took us to a guard shack up there that overlooked the whole Russian river.
[02:12:29.180 --> 02:12:31.180]  Yeah, it's right above the little bridge.
[02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:42.180]  Yep. So yeah, we actually went there and saw deer swimming through there. So I don't know if they saw you guys coming or how long, how long were you in there before they ran you out?
[02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:50.180]  Well, I didn't really go in. The crew went in and then ran from the guards and got arrested. I just followed them up to the water line.
[02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:57.180]  And by then, basically, they got, they got grabbed and I, I didn't, I got out of there.
[02:12:57.180 --> 02:13:02.180]  Yeah. And I didn't know, I knew it was exclusive and ex-presidents, everything else.
[02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:05.180]  I didn't have a clue what it is that I know today.
[02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:11.180]  Well, it's not just ex-presidents. It's current presidents have been known to go there.
[02:13:11.180 --> 02:13:16.180]  Going back to William Howard Taft, right around 1900 or 1901.
[02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:20.180]  But did you see Molek, the big stone idol?
[02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:25.180]  Didn't. No, I missed that. That would have been great. That was the one thing.
[02:13:25.180 --> 02:13:28.180]  They didn't show you that, David. Well, I appreciate your call. Interesting story, man.
[02:13:28.180 --> 02:13:32.180]  Let's talk to Tim in Michigan. Tim, you're on the air.
[02:13:32.180 --> 02:13:34.180]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[02:13:34.180 --> 02:13:36.180]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:13:36.180 --> 02:13:44.180]  Hey, Alex. First off, I just wanted to ask you about this play on words.
[02:13:44.180 --> 02:13:48.180]  You know, we're in four, typically in four wars right now.
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:56.180]  And my first question to you is, how many wars or countries do we have to invade before it's considered a world war?
[02:13:56.180 --> 02:14:09.180]  And second, my observation of Mr. Faker's birth certificate, Obama, all I've heard from him is speech after speech,
[02:14:09.180 --> 02:14:15.180]  lip service after lip service. And I don't know any other president combined.
[02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:23.180]  In fact, from what I hear, has spent more money as a single president than any other president combined together.
[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:28.180]  Yeah, he has. And then that's because he's a puppet and the bankers are finally bleeding us completely out.
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:32.180]  But going back to your first question, what was your first question?
[02:14:32.180 --> 02:14:37.180]  Well, yes, you used a certain term and it was kind of weird.
[02:14:37.180 --> 02:14:44.180]  I never heard it before. You were calling these, well, they called it a police action in Vietnam.
[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:46.180]  But now they're calling it some other kind of military.
[02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:49.180]  They're calling it a kinetic action. They're saying it's not a war.
[02:14:49.180 --> 02:14:52.180]  It's kinetic when we drop bombs and send in special forces.
[02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:55.180]  Those are not ground forces. They're just on the ground.
[02:14:55.180 --> 02:15:00.180]  And I appreciate your call. It's an excellent point, Tim.
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:08.180]  Going back and expanding on this, this isn't really so much the start of World War III.
[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:15.180]  A lot of people at the CIA called the Cold War World War III. This isn't really the start of World War IV, though it could lead to that.
[02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:24.180]  What it is is a NATO globalist Anglo-American establishment invasion of third world countries that they wanted to overthrow.
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:36.180]  So it's a neo-colonial, imperial, multi-pronged invasion with a new system they're using where they openly finance rebels to overthrow governments.
[02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:41.180]  And when the rebels succeed, they come in and take over behind them.
[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:46.180]  Or if they don't succeed, they give them air power and weapons and ground advisors.
[02:15:46.180 --> 02:15:53.180]  And so it's really not new in history, but it's new in the last few decades, and then they call it humanitarian.
[02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:58.180]  Then when there are other dictators or murdering their public, they call it loving and good and fighting al-Qaeda.
[02:15:58.180 --> 02:16:03.180]  But then when they're fighting Muammar, Qadhafi, and Libya, they say al-Qaeda is good.
[02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:07.180]  But then when they're fighting al-Qaeda, another country, al-Qaeda is bad.
[02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:15.180]  And it's just basically the globalists are a private corporate crime network who manipulate major governments, who fund terrorist groups,
[02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:19.180]  to then attack countries so they can take our liberties here domestically.
[02:16:19.180 --> 02:16:24.180]  I mean, it's a one-size-fits-all system that they use.
[02:16:24.180 --> 02:16:31.180]  But bumping into the borders of Russia, China, and others, as is now happening in Central Asia,
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:42.180]  the 888 situation in 2008 with the NATO-backed attack on the Russian-controlled enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[02:16:42.180 --> 02:16:47.180]  The Russians just rolled new, mobile nuke platforms in, and their chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff came out and said,
[02:16:47.180 --> 02:16:49.180]  we're preparing to use nuclear weapons on you.
[02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:55.180]  Pull back as NATO forces landed to back up the humanitarian force, and the globalists blinked and backed off.
[02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:59.180]  The Russians rolled in nukes and said, we're preparing to fire nuclear weapons.
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:05.180]  They had their chairman go on television and say, this is an act of aggression, and we're preparing for nuclear warfare.
[02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:07.180]  We're going to start with tactical weapons.
[02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:11.180]  And if you respond to those, we're going to launch ICBMs, basically.
[02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:15.180]  And Dick Cheney, who started it later, it came out, was the one that ran it.
[02:17:15.180 --> 02:17:23.180]  He said, whoa, they had NATO, they had Israelis, they had U.S. forces advising the puppet minion in Georgia.
[02:17:23.180 --> 02:17:25.180]  And again, I'm not saying the Russians are good either.
[02:17:25.180 --> 02:17:30.180]  The point is, the globalists are just out of their minds trying to start World War III.
[02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:36.180]  And that all went on the day the Olympics started at 888, while Putin was meeting with Bush.
[02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:38.180]  They got the word that this had started.
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:40.180]  So very, very bizarre.
[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:42.180]  Let's talk to Francis in Texas.
[02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:44.180]  Francis, you're on the air.
[02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:46.180]  Hi, Alex.
[02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:56.180]  So first of all, I just want to say that with regards to the comment of Senator Lindsey Graham of amending the First Amendment,
[02:17:56.180 --> 02:18:04.180]  I say that the American people should realize that once this fellow and anyone who supports him does this,
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:09.180]  and we agree to it, then that's the end of our bill of rights.
[02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:20.180]  And I agree that we have been lied to for a very long time about the wars, the illegal wars that's happening now in Libya,
[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:30.180]  the war in Afghanistan, why in the world should a country like us who declares us to be patriotic
[02:18:30.180 --> 02:18:39.180]  and who campaigned for freedom and liberty and justice, be involved in wars that were not supposed to be in,
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:45.180]  the life that the current president says that he's going to pull out troops and bring them home.
[02:18:45.180 --> 02:18:53.180]  I feel that the young men and women that's fighting, thinking that they're fighting for the truth and justice and equality,
[02:18:53.180 --> 02:19:01.180]  they're not there to fight those kind of objectives, but they were there as a pawn in bringing so much pain and misery
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:05.180]  not only to their family, but to our country.
[02:19:05.180 --> 02:19:15.180]  So I just hope that something would be done about this, and I hope that you and all of you who profess the truth
[02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:19.180]  be protected and be blessed by God.
[02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:21.180]  Well, thank you. I appreciate the call, Francis.
[02:19:21.180 --> 02:19:29.180]  Look, if they're able to set the precedent saying that this is inciting and not making about the people burning and chopping heads off
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:36.180]  and shooting people in Afghanistan, but making about this pastor burning the Koran after he put it on trial,
[02:19:36.180 --> 02:19:40.180]  now he's going to put Mohammed on trial and burn an effigy.
[02:19:40.180 --> 02:19:48.180]  And these Muslim countries, most of them don't have any liberties, but they're governmental back off if they go wild over religion.
[02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:56.180]  This is what the globalists want. It turned out CIA back groups published those images of Mohammed with a bomb on his head.
[02:19:56.180 --> 02:20:01.180]  That was done to get the Muslims riled up because they want to have a war with them.
[02:20:01.180 --> 02:20:05.180]  Are you still a traditional smoker?
[02:20:05.180 --> 02:20:10.180]  Now experience a new lifestyle and try vaping with e-cigarettes by LeSig.

[02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:05.180]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[02:21:05.180 --> 02:21:13.180]  The U.S. government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:22.180]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S. bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the U.S. antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators,
[02:21:22.180 --> 02:21:29.180]  the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S. Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S. Treasuries.
[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:34.180]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S. dollar will soon become worthless
[02:21:34.180 --> 02:21:38.180]  and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:47.180]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[02:21:47.180 --> 02:21:59.180]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at www.inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:22.180]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:22:22.180 --> 02:22:29.180]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[02:22:29.180 --> 02:22:37.180]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:22:37.180 --> 02:22:47.180]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:56.180]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:22:56.180 --> 02:22:59.180]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:22:59.180 --> 02:23:10.180]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification. You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[02:23:10.180 --> 02:23:16.180]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals and drugs? It is glutathione.
[02:23:16.180 --> 02:23:24.180]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body. It stops free radicals, keeps sales young and reduces inflammation.
[02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:30.180]  One World Way protein powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[02:23:30.180 --> 02:23:37.180]  One World Way is more effective than any other way protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:44.180]  All other, quote, cold processed way protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[02:23:44.180 --> 02:23:58.180]  One World Way comes in three delicious flavors. Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:19.180]  Okay, we're continuing with your phone calls.
[02:24:19.180 --> 02:24:28.180]  Coming up, I have a trailer for a new video game. I've literally seen 10, 15, I don't know, I haven't counted them up.
[02:24:28.180 --> 02:24:41.180]  Video game trailers the last few years pushing the idea of UN invasions of America, world government, tyranny, poisoning the drinking water, eugenics.
[02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:55.180]  You can look at this two ways. Are the video game producers fans of this show? Yes, a lot of them aren't of contacted me and there's little blurbs and nods to this show in many video games that we've listed before.
[02:24:55.180 --> 02:25:03.180]  Or you can look at it that some of these big companies are basically trying to acclimate people. That's coming up for a little bit in the next segment along with some news.
[02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:07.180]  But right now, let's go to Tony in Oklahoma. Tony, thanks for holding.
[02:25:07.180 --> 02:25:16.180]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you having on your show. First, I'd like to say thank you so much for the quality of the guests that you bring on your show.
[02:25:16.180 --> 02:25:29.180]  Just the depth of the conversation that you've got that you bring is great. You listen to other shows or television shows and it's just fast, fast, boom, boom, boom, talking head.
[02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:39.180]  And the conservative shows just freak out over Muslims and how scary they are and how dangerous they are and give up all your rights for hour after hour. It just gets old.
[02:25:39.180 --> 02:25:44.180]  And then, meanwhile, the Muslim extremists work for the globalists on record.
[02:25:44.180 --> 02:26:03.180]  Exactly. Well, thank you for having Mr. Ventura on. That was an incredible hour. I enjoyed that so much. One of the reasons I called was I wanted to see what your take was on a lot of the companies and corporations that are working overseas and support roles for the military
[02:26:03.180 --> 02:26:14.180]  and like Afghanistan and Iraq and what your take on all of that was. I'm probably heading that way in about a month myself. I kept the position where the company is.
[02:26:14.180 --> 02:26:28.180]  Yeah, that's about the only boom economy is the contractors. Well, you got Dinecore, Halliburton, XZ. You've got countless groups out there with no bid contracts who are making a killing off of all of these operations.
[02:26:28.180 --> 02:26:42.180]  What's your view of it? Well, you know, my view is I've got a family to feed and my company took a major hit last year. I just took them, I just tanked. I got hit by a lot of contractors that slow paid me and I've got...
[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:50.180]  Well, that's what a managed economy does. The only money for scholarships is police state stuff. The only money for government contracts is the empire.
[02:26:50.180 --> 02:27:03.180]  They basically, if you're not an Obama supporter, you don't get the waiver on your insurance for your employees. That's what an organized command and control economy is about. That's what fascism is about. Go ahead.
[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:12.180]  Yeah, you're exactly right about that. And it's put me in a position where I've got to do what I've got to do. And unfortunately, you know, it takes me away from my family for an extended period of time.
[02:27:12.180 --> 02:27:22.180]  One of the other questions that I had for you was some background information on HARP. Where would I look for that on the Internet?
[02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:31.180]  Well, we interviewed the director of HARP a few years ago and we re-aired that and reposted it on infowars.com. Just search Alex Jones interviews director of HARP.
[02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:42.180]  We've got Dr. Nick Begich's book and his video available at infowars.com that break all of that down. Really, just type HARP infowars.com.
[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:49.180]  I mean, you'll get reliable reports and information, not conspiracy theories about what these types of technologies do.
[02:27:49.180 --> 02:28:02.180]  But now there's mainstream news articles admitting that Arab countries, China, the Russians, they use similar HARP arrays and admit it's for weather modification.
[02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:06.180]  So a lot of that's now public.
[02:28:06.180 --> 02:28:12.180]  Well, I'm a new listener and I've never heard anything about that before and I was just like, wow, this is very interesting. So I wanted to do some research on that.
[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:25.180]  And then one comment I'd like to make. I thank you for letting me stay on. I wonder if there's not so many people. I've been talking about things you shared for 20 years and people look at me like I'm a nut job and I'm like, well, you know, whatever.
[02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:36.180]  But anyway, do you think so many people in America today are just so deeply invested in the system that they're afraid of the truth? They don't even want to know the truth?
[02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:48.180]  Well, yeah, that's part of it. But it's also that the truth is so scary that they want to rationalize to themselves and tell themselves it isn't true because then they might have to get up and do something.
[02:28:48.180 --> 02:29:02.180]  They see themselves as reactive spectators, not as leaders, not as people that have power. People feel isolated. All they do is watch TV, don't even hang out with their neighbors.
[02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:11.180]  And so people are so isolated and the global social engineers know that everything's compartmentalized and that people have a limited wide spectrum understanding.
[02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:20.180]  So they play on that and that's how they're able to feed people more and more lies and disinformation. But a separation is happening.
[02:29:20.180 --> 02:29:29.180]  One large group of people is growing and becoming more informed, but others that want to believe the lie, they're getting deeper into the lie and believing more and more of it.
[02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:39.180]  They don't count. In the Revolutionary War, it was 5% that started it and won it. And we're in an Info War. We got way more than 5%, brother.
[02:29:39.180 --> 02:29:49.180]  So spectators really don't count. They've already taken themselves out of the game. What matters is that you're out there spreading the word, getting involved, and the system can't stop that.
[02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:59.180]  Yeah, no army can stop an idea whose times come.
[02:30:19.180 --> 02:30:47.180]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond Gusset Jeans. Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:47.180 --> 02:31:00.180]  Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset Comfort with Kevlar Protection so you can ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond Gusset Jeans got it. Others don't.
[02:31:18.180 --> 02:31:29.180]  Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:36.180]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:31:36.180 --> 02:31:46.180]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:33:11.180 --> 02:33:18.180]  No leaves of ground, and the sky is grey.
[02:33:18.180 --> 02:33:26.180]  I've been laughing for a while, on a winter's day, on a winter's day.
[02:33:26.180 --> 02:33:35.180]  I'd be safe through the wild, I'd be safe at home, if I was in LA, if I was in LA.
[02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:51.180]  Okay, I want to get into the economy and what's happened with the Liberty Dollar. Fed seeks 7 million and privately made Liberty Dollars here in a moment.
[02:33:51.180 --> 02:34:03.180]  But first I wanted to get into some predictive programming, where in video games, movies, much evidently financed by the federal government, and think tanks to put out certain messages.
[02:34:03.180 --> 02:34:12.180]  Like you watch dramas. I might watch dramas twice a year, and almost every episode is the person that's against abortions wants to murder people.
[02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:16.180]  Or the homeschoolers are trying to nerve gas the neighborhood.
[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:22.180]  Then they have federal drills all over the country where they come into unannounced elementary schools and scream,
[02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:34.180]  we're going to kill you, we're anti-open border people, we're pro-life, we're anti-groups that don't like the Second Amendment.
[02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:41.180]  This is all part of a demonization campaign where these groups really aren't committing any of these crimes or doing any of these things,
[02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:45.180]  and the globalists are using it to traumatize children in these drills.
[02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:50.180]  But then the only thing that backs it up in reality is the unreality of television.
[02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:57.180]  And a great example of this is almost all the cop shows are based in Chicago or New York.
[02:34:57.180 --> 02:35:01.180]  And they're dramas, and they catch a guy with a gun in his house, he goes to jail.
[02:35:01.180 --> 02:35:04.180]  They catch a guy with a shotgun in his car, he goes to jail.
[02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:12.180]  Not illegal in most states, it's only actually a few cities where it's totally illegal, but they don't care.
[02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:21.180]  And then people that weren't raised in the Second Amendment who don't know their rights, they then think when they're at your house and they see a gun case locked with firearms in it,
[02:35:21.180 --> 02:35:23.180]  they begin hyperventilating.
[02:35:23.180 --> 02:35:30.180]  I mean, I put my gun cases and things, you know, now in the closet locked up because repair people and others see it and they begin hyperventilating
[02:35:30.180 --> 02:35:36.180]  and they want to call the police and in one case, you know, they tried to, I've talked about that hundreds of times.
[02:35:36.180 --> 02:35:44.180]  This is mind control. I got my guns, they're legal, and some domesticated, cowardly, servile person.
[02:35:44.180 --> 02:35:50.180]  Most of the time I see it in the news, it's realtors. They come in your house, they see guns, they call the police.
[02:35:50.180 --> 02:35:53.180]  Reloading equipment, it's over, you're going to jail.
[02:35:53.180 --> 02:35:58.180]  And the SWAT team goes ahead and hits you and hits you hard. They know it's legal, they don't care.
[02:35:58.180 --> 02:36:08.180]  I see those reports all the time. It's almost always an old man in his garage who's tinkering cleaning guns and neighbors walk by and call the police and the cops take them to jail.
[02:36:08.180 --> 02:36:15.180]  I've seen this countless times and say, well, he did have nine firearms and 2,000 rounds of ammo. We believe this is an arsenal.
[02:36:15.180 --> 02:36:24.180]  Then you look up the state law, whether it's California where I've seen it or Massachusetts and there's no law against having the nine firearms or the ammo,
[02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:27.180]  but they still go to jail.
[02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:33.180]  Remember the woman in New York got pulled over with a shotgun in her trunk and it was legal but they went ahead and took her to jail?
[02:36:33.180 --> 02:36:40.180]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I have seen my listeners go to jail and it's in the newspaper.
[02:36:40.180 --> 02:36:47.180]  Kelly Rushing, this has got to be seven, eight years ago, and I read the Kentucky Lion County newspaper, showed it to you here on air.
[02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:53.180]  He calls me. I'd heard the caller before. He was handing out hundreds of my videos at that time VHS.
[02:36:53.180 --> 02:37:01.180]  And on one VHS, you'd had a Ron Paul Neocon speech for an hour and then it had road to tearing in slow play.
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:06.180]  And he was giving it out around town, family very well known, middle-class guy, business owner.
[02:37:06.180 --> 02:37:12.180]  Because when I first heard the story, I made phone calls to the town. I didn't believe it. I was naive seven, eight years ago.
[02:37:12.180 --> 02:37:23.180]  And I looked in the phone book, called other rushings and talked to his brother, talked to others, called the church. They knew who he was.
[02:37:23.180 --> 02:37:32.180]  Then I was sent the newspaper article and it said he's facing trial this week for threats against police for the video.
[02:37:32.180 --> 02:37:37.180]  And they came and arrested him and said that's an anti-law enforcement video.
[02:37:37.180 --> 02:37:43.180]  All it shows was military admitting their training to take our guns and Ron Paul getting a speech in the House of Representatives.
[02:37:43.180 --> 02:37:50.180]  And the state police came and arrested him and they took it to trial and told the jury, put him in jail for three years per count.
[02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:56.180]  For the Ron Paul video, he was charged and for my video. Both were seen as illegal.
[02:37:56.180 --> 02:38:03.180]  And I called the judge up at home and I said, are you really doing this? You're really having a trial for a video.
[02:38:03.180 --> 02:38:08.180]  And he said, yes, but I'm not going to talk about the case with you. I couldn't believe that then. Then I saw other cases.
[02:38:08.180 --> 02:38:15.180]  So in America, they will arrest you for your legal firearms. They will arrest you for not vaccinating your children, even though it's not the law.
[02:38:15.180 --> 02:38:22.180]  You see it all the time in the news. They will arrest you for things that are legal and lawful because they love it.
[02:38:22.180 --> 02:38:30.180]  The government is scum criminal run. Now you want to ship hundreds of billions of narcotics in and have Wells Fargo, Wacovia caught with it.
[02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:35.180]  You don't get in trouble. Bloomberg, London Telegraph. Was it back in the news yesterday?
[02:38:35.180 --> 02:38:42.180]  You want to be Dincor Halliburton caught running giant child kidnapping rings all over the world, congressional hearings.
[02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:48.180]  Nobody gets in trouble. You want to put sodium fluoride in the water causing massive cancer increases knowingly.
[02:38:48.180 --> 02:38:57.180]  You don't get in trouble. You're the UN caught adding sterilants to vaccines worldwide on record. You don't get in trouble.
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:39:05.180]  But you spank your kid in the backyard when they try to climb the fence or whatever and it didn't even illegal.
[02:39:05.180 --> 02:39:11.180]  Your neighbor calls you're going to lose your kids if they have their way. You clean your gun in the garage with it open.
[02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:15.180]  Those yuppies are going to see you go to jail. They're going to feel good when you're in the back of that squad car.
[02:39:15.180 --> 02:39:21.180]  And the government so loves tattletailing that they will try to still put you in jail even if it's not illegal.
[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:31.180]  This is what America's become. Alright, now I've segwayed and digressed off into other areas. I want to go to Rob Allen, Sean Gater, Scott and others.
[02:39:31.180 --> 02:39:36.180]  But let's go ahead and play this new video game trailer and I just see these all the time.
[02:39:36.180 --> 02:39:42.180]  For America 2049 has kicked off a viral marketing campaign to promote what appears to be upcoming video game.
[02:39:42.180 --> 02:39:50.180]  The story sounds and surrounds in America in 2049 ruled by a tyrannical group known as the Council of American Heritage
[02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:54.180]  and fighting the freedom group called the terrorist organization.
[02:39:54.180 --> 02:39:59.180]  You won't have to wait to 2049 for this to happen. Try 2020 if we don't slow things down or even faster.
[02:39:59.180 --> 02:40:04.180]  They're openly everywhere trying to push restrictions on free speech. Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:11.180]  They told me that I belong to anybody who wants me from now on.
[02:40:11.180 --> 02:40:17.180]  I wanted the chance to be free, to reclaim my heritage.
[02:40:17.180 --> 02:40:23.180]  It's around here. They don't allow any mix in other races like they do in looser parts of the country.
[02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:29.180]  A secure government facility has been attacked. Sources tell us that at least five inmates have been freed.
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:35.180]  Preliminary reports allege that the attackers are affiliated with Divided We Fall, the terrorist group.
[02:40:35.180 --> 02:40:43.180]  Agent, it's so nice to see you again. You'll become great friends and eyes will be watching you and judging.
[02:40:43.180 --> 02:40:51.180]  If we find him, we can take out DWF from the top. It's of vital importance. Don't let us down again, Agent.
[02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:59.180]  You guys like us took an oath to protect this country against all enemies of foreign and domestic.
[02:40:59.180 --> 02:41:05.180]  That oath didn't die with our army.
[02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:11.180]  Okay, so there you have it. This is supposedly some right-wing governments taking over in the future.
[02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:18.180]  Now, here is another video game ad that's been out for a couple years.
[02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:27.180]  Shattered Union. And notice the United Nations basically invades to save America, and they're one of the factions.
[02:41:27.180 --> 02:41:33.180]  But the evil Texans, they're one of the big enemies here. Here it is. Shattered Union.
[02:41:33.180 --> 02:41:45.180]  Following a disputed election and a tie vote, the U.S. Congress installs the most unpopular president in U.S. history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th president of the United States.
[02:41:45.180 --> 02:41:55.180]  Shortly after the election, increased unrest, rioting, and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism.
[02:41:55.180 --> 02:42:03.180]  In response, the president invokes the Homeland Security Act and declares martial law on the West Coast and other areas of the country.
[02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:12.180]  Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling sidesteps the electoral process, disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states.
[02:42:12.180 --> 02:42:21.180]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office.
[02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:33.180]  During the 57th Inauguration Day ceremonies, Washington D.C. is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon, killing David Adams and most of the U.S. Congress.
[02:42:33.180 --> 02:42:40.180]  The destruction of Washington D.C. effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation into chaos.
[02:42:40.180 --> 02:42:49.180]  In an emergency vote, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in the greater D.C. area to secure international interests.
[02:42:49.180 --> 02:42:58.180]  With separatist sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the Union.
[02:42:58.180 --> 02:43:07.180]  Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring states with them and forming the Republic of Texas.
[02:43:07.180 --> 02:43:15.180]  Now, the once United States of America lie in ruin.
[02:43:15.180 --> 02:43:24.180]  A time for words has passed and a Second American Civil War now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land.
[02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:35.180]  Okay. Now, going back here, you notice the United Nations invades countries all over the world and always engages in massacres.
[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:47.180]  And you notice that deals have been signed under the Security and Prosperity Partnership, North American Union Security Parameter, to quote, use foreign troops in North America to put down civil insurrection.
[02:43:47.180 --> 02:43:56.180]  That's now Ottawa Citizen Associated Press. They signed the deal almost nine years ago, but they've made it public now this year.
[02:43:56.180 --> 02:44:06.180]  We even have a few mainstream news articles reporting on it from 2002 that are in my film Road to Tyranny, 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny.
[02:44:06.180 --> 02:44:17.180]  So basically the public is being acclimated to accept foreign troops here inside of the United States during civil insurrection.
[02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:26.180]  An NLE09 run by FEMA had that in their battle plan as well. So everybody's just being conditioned to accept this and I tell you now it's in the cards.
[02:44:26.180 --> 02:44:38.180]  And you see the precedent set of UN forces and NATO forces bombing and going into countries when their rebels are overthrowing the government, going on in the Ivory Coast right now, going on in Libya.
[02:44:38.180 --> 02:44:53.180]  And what's happening now in the Ivory Coast really signifies this is what we broke down a month ago, what other experts broke down. It appears to be an Afrikan system run out of the Pentagon with NATO as its front.
[02:44:53.180 --> 02:45:02.180]  All right, continuing with the news here, gold rises near $1,435 as dollar retreats oil climbs.
[02:45:02.180 --> 02:45:09.180]  In fact, guys, will you get me the latest on gold prices? Let me just pull up Kitko if you want. I'm going to get the latest on gold and silver prices. Thank you.
[02:45:09.180 --> 02:45:23.180]  Gold rose back to above 1,431 ounce today as oil prices climbed and the dollar eased and traders anticipated a rate hike from the European Central Bank that may lead to further weakness in the U.S. currency.
[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:32.180]  And of course, they're not going to follow suit. They said until the end of the year with rate hikes. And so that will further weaken the dollar.
[02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:48.180]  Spot gold was around 1,434 an ounce against 1,027 in late on Friday. And as of this morning, silver was up yet again as well.
[02:45:48.180 --> 02:46:01.180]  So the issue here is every time that gold goes up and silver goes up, the system comes in and tries to push it back down.
[02:46:01.180 --> 02:46:07.180]  But if you look at the one year graph, the five year graph, the 10 year or the 11 year graph, both gold and silver going up.
[02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:15.180]  But whenever it dips down before it goes back up, they always hype that it's been completely discredited and destroyed.
[02:46:15.180 --> 02:46:22.180]  And so yuppies and people run around saying, see, it's a bad investment. And it's like a beach ball. They push it under and it pops back up.
[02:46:22.180 --> 02:46:28.180]  But more news on inflation increasing the head of Walmart obviously last week saying we're facing serious inflation.
[02:46:28.180 --> 02:46:38.180]  But the White House is still running around saying that their monetization of trillions of debt is not causing a problem, even though historically and monetarily we know what this is going to do.
[02:46:38.180 --> 02:46:46.180]  Continuing along the monetary policy line to say that there's been a thousand companies as conservative. I haven't counted it up.
[02:46:46.180 --> 02:46:53.180]  But there are thousands of known companies that have come and gone that issue gold and silver coins, commemorative coins.
[02:46:53.180 --> 02:47:02.180]  I could go start a company, you could start a company and stamp out coins as commemorative and put them out.
[02:47:02.180 --> 02:47:12.180]  Now, going back more than 15 years ago, the Liberty Dollar came out with the guy that had run the famous Hawaiian private mint that put out commemorative coins.
[02:47:12.180 --> 02:47:26.180]  Remember seeing when I was a kid, the ads on TV for his outfit? Well, he decided to put out an alternative currency, which any city, county, individual, you can have a business and say, you know, we use this currency here, cash in, cash to get it.
[02:47:26.180 --> 02:47:38.180]  A lot of places do. Like I said, when you go to a Dave and Buster's or some type of place where you eat dinner and play video games and things, you can take your money, give them cash or credit card and they put it on the Dave and Buster's card.
[02:47:38.180 --> 02:47:44.180]  And then that has the money on it. And what the feds are saying here is that's illegal.
[02:47:44.180 --> 02:47:52.180]  And you got Montana, you got South Carolina moving to pass legislation to issue their own state gold and silver currency.
[02:47:52.180 --> 02:47:57.180]  And in our country's history, many states have had their own currencies. In fact, we had a lot of competing currencies until 1913.
[02:47:57.180 --> 02:48:06.180]  You still had the overall Lincoln Greenback from the Civil War, but there were still state currencies and state banks and everything else.
[02:48:06.180 --> 02:48:16.180]  So they're really worried about this as they devalue the dollar that people are going to go for stable alternatives that are set in gold and silver in ounces or in fractions of ounces.
[02:48:16.180 --> 02:48:23.180]  Federal prosecutors on Monday tried to take a hoard of silver, Liberty dollars worth about $7 million.
[02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:28.180]  Now, they also had paper that people could put on deposit at Liberty dollar.
[02:48:28.180 --> 02:48:33.180]  When the feds first rated them, they had enough silver and more for all the paper they'd also issued.
[02:48:33.180 --> 02:48:37.180]  They thought they'd get them there, but the feds convict people over 96% of the time.
[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:40.180]  They don't like to be wrong, so they just make stuff up as they go along.
[02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:46.180]  They don't like taking you to jail for legal guns or for legal AR-15.
[02:48:46.180 --> 02:48:55.180]  Federal prosecutors on Monday tried to take a hoard of silver, Liberty dollars worth $7 million that authorities say was invented by an Indiana man to compete with U.S. currency.
[02:48:55.180 --> 02:48:59.180]  He invented silver and gold coins.
[02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:09.180]  Bernard von Nothas, 67, we need to get him on, was convicted last month in federal court in Statesville on conspiracy and counterfeiting charges for making and selling the currency,
[02:49:09.180 --> 02:49:15.180]  which he promoted as inflation-proof competition for the U.S. dollar.
[02:49:15.180 --> 02:49:32.180]  Well, that's what we promote to buy gold and silver, whether it be Australian or whether it be British or Canadian or U.S. government, buffaloes or eagles or South African Krugerans or Swiss, Franks or British sovereigns.
[02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:40.180]  Because, I mean, you know, 10 years ago, you buy it at $260 an ounce, and now it's $1,430 something.
[02:49:40.180 --> 02:49:42.180]  That's about the inflation line.
[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:46.180]  That's why you get this commodity that's been used for 6,000 years.
[02:49:46.180 --> 02:49:48.180]  It's not rocket science.
[02:49:48.180 --> 02:49:56.180]  And so, oh, he promoted it as inflation-proof. See, they sell this like it's dirty, like these people don't give their kids vaccines.
[02:49:56.180 --> 02:49:58.180]  These people, the organic food.
[02:49:58.180 --> 02:50:02.180]  Many vegetarian families or organic families have their kids taken.
[02:50:02.180 --> 02:50:03.180]  A lot.
[02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:20.180]  The prosecutor successfully painted a viscer from the nut house in a false light, and now the U.S. attorney responsible for the prosecution is painting the case in a false light, saying that it establishes that private voluntary barter currency is illegal, his lawyer wrote.
[02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:31.180]  The trial was scheduled to resume Monday in Statesville. The case involves more than five tons of Liberty dollars, and precious metals seized from a warehouse was on a vault, which the government wants to take by forfeiture.
[02:50:31.180 --> 02:50:33.180]  They want to steal it.
[02:50:33.180 --> 02:50:41.180]  Kind of like when the government caught $376 billion in laundered money and the big banks owning the planes and everything.
[02:50:41.180 --> 02:50:45.180]  They just said, just give us $100 million. We just want some of the little piece.
[02:50:45.180 --> 02:50:49.180]  Hey, we understand. We ship it in with you. It's competition.
[02:50:49.180 --> 02:50:51.180]  So there you go.
[02:50:51.180 --> 02:51:20.180]  Legal aliens can run wild, drunk, drive to where they want, corrupt government, harm banks can steal trillions, but you don't issue your own silver and gold points. How dare you?
[02:51:21.180 --> 02:51:29.180]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S. economy and inflation.

[02:51:39.180 --> 02:51:46.180]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.

[02:54:28.180 --> 02:54:56.180]  I had to bring Ted Anderson up. I just called him during the break because Ted is still, as of this morning, he said,
[02:54:56.180 --> 02:55:11.180]  I'm about to go up $31 for three silver dollars. Three silver dollars at $38 apiece. Do the math. How much is three silver dollars right now in the regular market, Ted?
[02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:26.180]  Well, the regular silver dollars are over $40 apiece. So if you're picking up three of your videos and three of the silver dollars and we're delivering them for $110, I mean, it is so far beyond being a no brainer, Alex.
[02:55:26.180 --> 02:55:34.180]  I mean, again, like you and I discussed last time, I have to raise my prices because I'm selling these things for less than what I pay for them now by a great margin.
[02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:42.180]  Yeah, three of those coins is $120 if you're lucky. But you're talking about how much for the three coins, Ted?
[02:55:42.180 --> 02:55:49.180]  Well, it's $110 delivered. $5 goes for the postage and there's some value there, about $15 at least.
[02:55:49.180 --> 02:55:58.180]  But then on top of it, fall the Republic Obama deception in in-game, a $60 value. So we're talking about a $70 plus discount.
[02:55:58.180 --> 02:56:06.180]  It's a smoking deal on silver alone at $31 an ounce with it over $38 right now. Do the math. And I would say that your purchase supports the broadcast.
[02:56:06.180 --> 02:56:15.180]  Quite frankly, it doesn't. Ted does these loss leaders. I love to be able to offer things to our listeners. How long, Ted, can you hold it at the $31 apiece?
[02:56:15.180 --> 02:56:26.180]  You know, Alex, I'm going to hold this till tonight. I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow because gold, I'm sorry, silver is at $38.63 at market peak today, and I'm expecting it to go even further.
[02:56:26.180 --> 02:56:33.180]  When I have silver spots sitting at $39 an ounce, I'm not going to be able to sell silver dollars at this price. It's just impossible.
[02:56:33.180 --> 02:56:40.180]  Yeah, the point is, you're not like other brokers that get the orders and then try to buy it. You have it in your vault there in town at the bank.
[02:56:40.180 --> 02:56:46.180]  You take it and then ship it out to people. You've got it right now. You've also got limited silver and other gold coins.
[02:56:46.180 --> 02:56:54.180]  But they've got to say it's the radio special to have that long list of super discounts. What are some of the other specials? Briefly, you've got Ted Anderson.
[02:56:54.180 --> 02:57:04.180]  Well, I mean, right now the Walking Liberty Half right now is at $1808. Those are over $20 now regularly. The Lakota Nation Coins at $44.65, that's gone up too.
[02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:12.180]  British Sovereigns right now at $390. Those are higher. Franks right now at $311. And we've got a range of things.
[02:57:12.180 --> 02:57:19.180]  Hey, how about this? The creature from Jekyll Island Book delivered right now for $31 and get one silver dollar in it.
[02:57:19.180 --> 02:57:27.180]  It's just there's such an array of things that I have that are so far below. Let's explain how much for the book of the silver dollar?
[02:57:27.180 --> 02:57:39.180]  $31 still because the books normally 20, the coins about $40, $31 for a $40 coin and $20 book. That's $31 for something that should be above $60.
[02:57:39.180 --> 02:57:47.180]  Doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that's half price. Ted is crazy. There's no doubt about it. Crazy for Liberty and a very competitive individual.
[02:57:47.180 --> 02:57:54.180]  It ends tonight at these prices. It'll go up a little, but still be a great deal. Tell them Alex Jones, since you though, it'll be the higher price, which is still a great deal.
[02:57:54.180 --> 02:58:11.180]  $80686, 2237, $80686, 2237, silver and gold right now exploding because of dollar devaluation as they now talk about QE3 and further global devaluation.
[02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:19.180]  $80686, 2237. Again, they tell them it's the radio Alex Jones special to get a whole list of things that are discounted, right Ted?
[02:58:19.180 --> 02:58:20.180]  Yep, that's right.
[02:58:20.180 --> 02:58:27.180]  And chief among it, three silver dollars, three of my films for what? You said 110?
[02:58:27.180 --> 02:58:28.180]  110 delivered.
[02:58:28.180 --> 02:58:36.180]  So that's the shipping on top of it for free. Do the math. Again, can you find something better? I dare you.
[02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:42.180]  $80686, 2237. The Jesse Ventura interview coming up in retransmission and full wars.com. Great job, Greg.
[02:58:42.180 --> 02:58:52.180]  Jesse Ventura coming up. Incredible interview. See you back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Love you all. We're going to beat the globalists together. The truth's unstoppable.
[02:58:52.180 --> 02:59:00.180]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:59:00.180 --> 02:59:05.180]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:59:05.180 --> 02:59:11.180]  We've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:11.180 --> 02:59:16.180]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:59:16.180 --> 02:59:26.180]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:59:26.180 --> 02:59:32.180]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:59:32.180 --> 02:59:39.180]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
