[01:15.560 --> 01:20.520]  ago they knew it was unconstitutional so they didn't want to have a public
[01:20.520 --> 01:25.680]  debate about it well now that's been forced and they have voted in the House

[08:28.720 --> 08:37.120]  edition the 25th day of july 2013 I already had Eric man cal Muller who's
[08:37.120 --> 08:42.280]  got a hit I mean it's got like four or five million viewers per premiere on
[08:42.280 --> 08:50.800]  history channel with his show that is extremely popular god guns and
[08:50.800 --> 08:56.920]  automobiles we're gonna have him popping in at the bottom of the hour to talk
[08:56.920 --> 09:02.520]  about how media matters and other White House run groups tried to not let that
[09:02.520 --> 09:07.480]  show go on the air because the word god in the name and then yesterday the
[09:07.480 --> 09:13.360]  Toronto Health Department came out and said ABC news please don't in fact guys
[09:13.360 --> 09:16.160]  we reprinted the article I know it came out yesterday afternoon I don't have it
[09:16.160 --> 09:22.760]  here in the stack thank you the Toronto Health Department came out and said the
[09:22.760 --> 09:27.280]  the Canadian health authorities came out and asked ABC to reconsider Jenny
[09:27.280 --> 09:31.840]  McCarthy and said that she will cause undue deaths by her vaccine
[09:31.840 --> 09:38.560]  misinformation of course they gave no proof of that but they just demonized
[09:38.560 --> 09:41.760]  her you've got other big pharma groups here in the United States trying to keep
[09:41.760 --> 09:44.320]  her off the air even though she's not gonna be talking about stuff like that
[09:44.320 --> 09:49.400]  on air obviously her son was damaged she went and investigated it there's a
[09:49.400 --> 09:53.520]  massive evidence linking vaccines to autism autoimmune diseases you name it
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.160]  it's a cocktail of other contributing factors as well dangerous pesticides GMO
[09:58.160 --> 10:04.600]  it's Legion what's going on and they put out hoaxes trying to discredit people
[10:04.600 --> 10:09.360]  like Dr. Wakefield saying he hoaxed he sued the doctor it's moving forward in
[10:09.360 --> 10:13.820]  court he sued the so-called journalists that put it out and it's come out in
[10:13.820 --> 10:17.160]  court now that there was a previous British study that got no attention that
[10:17.160 --> 10:22.800]  showed his very findings they found the antibodies in the intestines of children
[10:22.800 --> 10:29.400]  for the measles with autism Japan has said you can't have Gardasil anymore a
[10:29.400 --> 10:40.200]  month ago you've got all of this going on you've got examples in India they
[10:40.200 --> 10:43.640]  banned a couple years ago the Gardasil shot they said okay we'll take the
[10:43.640 --> 10:47.560]  obvious money okay we'll say girls should take this oh my goodness it's
[10:47.560 --> 10:50.760]  killing a bunch of people it's making people of autoimmune disorders it's
[10:50.760 --> 10:54.080]  making people get lupus it's making people have blood come out of every
[10:54.080 --> 10:58.800]  pore in their body we've seen all the cheerleaders on the news who died with
[10:58.800 --> 11:03.320]  their mothers talking about it I mean just type in Gardasil deaths they had a
[11:03.320 --> 11:07.200]  bunch of deaths during the trials and then Rick Perry came out and lied and
[11:07.200 --> 11:13.960]  said that it was the law you've got to take the shot in Texas like he was
[11:13.960 --> 11:18.680]  emperor king of earth and people went out by the hundreds of thousands and
[11:18.680 --> 11:24.720]  gave their girls shots and then a bunch of them died a bunch of them got
[11:24.720 --> 11:28.800]  paralyzed a bunch of them had health problems and so the story here is what
[11:28.800 --> 11:33.760]  is a foreign government as I forgot to get a water I need one real bad thanks
[11:33.760 --> 11:39.520]  my throat is dry for some reason thank you just make it run me a water in so I
[11:39.520 --> 11:44.920]  have a coughing attack on air it's so obvious what's going on here and it's
[11:44.920 --> 11:49.680]  just a gang of government bullies and others and media bullies trying to
[11:49.680 --> 11:58.480]  persecute as heretics and and blacklist in a type of Soviet corporatist
[11:58.480 --> 12:06.920]  authoritarian intimidation anybody that speaks out about anything outside of the
[12:06.920 --> 12:15.960]  establishment norm and the establishment norm itself is just wall-to-wall
[12:15.960 --> 12:24.280]  anti sovereignty anti family anti private property anti medical liberty
[12:24.280 --> 12:30.600]  anti privacy I mean just pure authoritarianism thank you called
[12:30.600 --> 12:36.240]  liberalism and you've got established when authoritarianism from the right
[12:36.240 --> 12:40.000]  wing as well because the same special interest will will buy off any group or
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.720]  politician they can and then have them try to package it for conservatives
[12:43.720 --> 12:48.640]  package it for liberals pat package it for libertarians that co-opt movements
[12:48.640 --> 12:51.920]  I mean you know how this works if you can control the government if you've got a
[12:51.920 --> 12:54.880]  big government you can control the market you can control the corporate
[12:54.880 --> 12:58.720]  welfare you can control the the implementation of regulations you this
[12:58.720 --> 13:02.840]  is the real discrimination in our world and they want us so obsessed on race
[13:02.840 --> 13:08.120]  and religion and sex and all this other diversions as political footballs while
[13:08.120 --> 13:13.400]  they steal the whole world again I monitor MSNBC in the coffee room CNN
[13:13.400 --> 13:17.320]  Fox we have different areas of the office just televisions on monitoring it
[13:17.320 --> 13:23.400]  c-span another office we flip through the channels I monitor it on XM and and
[13:23.400 --> 13:29.160]  all they do is one message branding branding branding any type of owning
[13:29.160 --> 13:37.840]  guns property family is racist anybody that that wants to have any free market
[13:37.840 --> 13:43.600]  is is evil and backwards and and and hates everyone branding branding
[13:43.600 --> 13:48.640]  go after the Tea Party go after real grassroots libertarians that by the way
[13:48.640 --> 13:54.440]  are getting major seats in the house and that's what Joe Biden's freaking about
[13:54.440 --> 13:58.680]  freaking out about me talks to millionaire donors and and the audio
[13:58.680 --> 14:02.000]  gets leaked a few months ago that's what Obama talks about to big donors and
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.840]  that's what Carl Rove talks about the Republican leadership because they're
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.280]  all part of the same establishment and if they can't suppress the Rand Paul
[14:10.280 --> 14:17.520]  Ted Cruz libertarian type they're gonna lose and so every time I walk by MSNBC
[14:17.520 --> 14:22.440]  I mean every time this just happened 20 minutes ago right before the show started
[14:22.440 --> 14:26.200]  I was hearing well it's just the racist Ted Cruz and you know they hate
[14:26.200 --> 14:32.240]  Hispanics and they're very racist and and and the racist Rand Paul and the with
[14:32.240 --> 14:37.200]  with with no proof no nothing and and for someone who's informed you watch it
[14:37.200 --> 14:42.000]  you go this is cartoonish but for people that are just purely politically
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.280]  correct they go well I better not be pro-gun that's racist I better not be
[14:47.280 --> 14:52.400]  pro-sovereignty that's racist I better be for the expansion of NAFTA and GATT
[14:52.400 --> 14:58.160]  and all these other trade deals into Asia the Caribbean Europe thousands of
[14:58.160 --> 15:02.800]  thousands of pages long sometimes tens of thousands I saw some number that they
[15:02.800 --> 15:07.000]  were the new trade agreements fifty something thousand pages long it's just
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.760]  every special interest writing in what they want and and sometimes they get a
[15:11.760 --> 15:16.720]  whole area of law written for ten thousand I was reading where lobbyists
[15:16.720 --> 15:20.800]  come in and we'll give a hundred thousand in one day to a candidate and
[15:20.800 --> 15:23.960]  it's like ten thousand here ten thousand there and they're getting billions
[15:23.960 --> 15:30.720]  sometimes for ten thousand dollar donation you can give a hundred thousand
[15:30.720 --> 15:34.960]  dollars and meet with the president privately for 15 minutes and if they
[15:34.960 --> 15:40.840]  can do it then he tells his aid okay get that done and they do it oh you I mean
[15:40.840 --> 15:45.520]  you gave the president you know with your dealership group in Indiana Minnesota
[15:45.520 --> 15:48.560]  and a couple of states up there remember this came out in the news oh you gave
[15:48.560 --> 15:53.080]  two million dollars to Democrats oh you want the dealerships taken from other
[15:53.080 --> 15:56.160]  people and given to you that they have contractually well the government runs
[15:56.160 --> 16:00.240]  it now we'll just take a hundred plus dealerships worth millions of peace and
[16:00.240 --> 16:04.680]  give it to you because you gave a couple of mill I mean folks this is just pure
[16:04.680 --> 16:11.480]  gangsterism these people are pure gangsters and they're making their move
[16:11.480 --> 16:17.880]  the damn broke on the Democratic watch okay you know folks I say vote
[16:17.880 --> 16:21.120]  constitutionalist just so happens you get more Republicans attempt to be
[16:21.120 --> 16:24.680]  constitutionalist unless some get co-opted the Republican leadership is
[16:24.680 --> 16:29.200]  pure new world order eugenics evil in this country since the days of the
[16:29.200 --> 16:34.640]  Rockefeller Republicans in the 70s there's no doubt that they're bad news
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.800]  but there is a real rebellion within the Republicans by the libertarians that
[16:39.800 --> 16:47.600]  has a shot a shot a good shot 50-50 I'd say and you got to get behind
[16:47.600 --> 16:52.360]  libertarian constitutional Republicans and some of them will end up betraying
[16:52.360 --> 16:58.120]  us but you know you know John McCain's the enemy John McCain is now out in the
[16:58.120 --> 17:02.360]  news saying there's no doubt the concealed carry is being used it's racist
[17:02.360 --> 17:10.360]  and it we need to have a federal law restricting concealed carry see there
[17:10.360 --> 17:14.200]  they go folks they do not want you armed they want you to live like folks in
[17:14.200 --> 17:20.080]  Chicago New York or DC disarmed because they're mafia folks they are mafia I
[17:20.080 --> 17:30.160]  have been in meetings over the years by circumstance or by dumb luck with high
[17:30.160 --> 17:35.080]  level Hollywood people high-level corporate people and all they do is sit
[17:35.080 --> 17:41.160]  around talking about killing people and ruining their competition and chomping
[17:41.160 --> 17:46.160]  on cigars and slapping you know supermodels in the hind ends and get me a
[17:46.160 --> 17:50.240]  drink I mean folks that's who runs this country the senators and people are

[18:15.360 --> 18:20.360]  waivers from Obamacare in direct competition with their competition

[24:09.360 --> 24:14.320]  political bent is on a planetary scale matter where you are in the world you
[24:14.320 --> 24:18.840]  would want to support a mother who has an autistic child's right to investigate
[24:18.840 --> 24:23.760]  vaccines as one of the main causal effects when so many parents thousands
[24:23.760 --> 24:28.560]  on record I've talked to hundreds myself go in the third round of shots at 18
[24:28.560 --> 24:33.200]  months take the shots the kid has a convulsion never talks again and then
[24:33.200 --> 24:38.160]  they have an autoimmune response blood on the brain and the inserts say it can
[24:38.160 --> 24:42.600]  do that to you and then there's all these countless studies and they go all
[24:42.600 --> 24:46.840]  kook say mercury hurts your brain kook say fluoride hurts your brain you're
[24:46.840 --> 24:51.120]  like well I have a I have a Harvard study right here saying it causes massive
[24:51.120 --> 24:59.400]  IQ reduction and they go well sure you do dummy look he can talk he's a smart this
[24:59.400 --> 25:02.760]  is the type of arrogance that we're talking about and I'm gonna play a
[25:02.760 --> 25:06.600]  clip of this coming up with man cow where they're on Fox singing and you name it
[25:06.600 --> 25:12.360]  saying she had need a show she shouldn't be on the air bipartisan hordes of
[25:12.360 --> 25:18.480]  people whose shows are probably a third or more financed by big pharma ads where
[25:18.480 --> 25:22.360]  they say having to urinate too much will take this drug and it lists like 30
[25:22.360 --> 25:28.400]  seconds of may kill you brain damage liver failure death make you commit
[25:28.400 --> 25:32.880]  suicide every time I watch TV it's like half the drug ads are like it may make
[25:32.880 --> 25:36.960]  you commit suicide or cause mass murder blood clots death psychopathic
[25:36.960 --> 25:41.600]  activities and it's like but the person's smiling and they're always smiling
[25:41.600 --> 25:45.000]  the woman's kind of umbrella where it's going may cause you to commit suicide
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.080]  she's like walking out the front doors of a building smiling I saw that on TV
[25:49.080 --> 25:52.440]  this weekend I forget what you had it was you've all seen it like may cause
[25:52.440 --> 25:55.880]  heart attack may cause autoimmune disease may cause liver failure may cause
[25:55.880 --> 26:00.400]  suicidal thoughts or suicidal actions and like the person's walking waving but
[26:00.400 --> 26:05.960]  first they're sad oh the wonderful drug will help you be all be all happy and
[26:05.960 --> 26:10.520]  then it goes but it may kill you I mean the inserts say this on the vaccines it's
[26:10.520 --> 26:16.840]  yeah but then it's like this crazy Jenny McCarthy she says it made you know
[26:16.840 --> 26:20.200]  have caused her son to be autistic has happened after he got his second round
[26:20.200 --> 26:25.120]  of shots she's not she's dangerous don't give her a show this is the reason I
[26:25.120 --> 26:31.120]  haven't taken a show on Discovery Channel History Channel A&E court TV then
[26:31.120 --> 26:35.120]  it became true TV I mean I'll be on people's shows occasionally with today's
[26:35.120 --> 26:39.560]  work but you know man cow over and over again I said hey come tell me part of
[26:39.560 --> 26:45.160]  this you know this TV show I'm developing and I told him no no no I could
[26:45.160 --> 26:49.000]  probably be on the Discovery Channel show with him right now because man cow is
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.040]  a great guy's gay he's had a lot of different hit TV shows and I just don't
[26:53.040 --> 26:58.040]  mess with it because if I'm in the show and sign a contract I've got to then
[26:58.040 --> 27:03.880]  let them do whatever they want with the reality TV show and I almost wish I
[27:03.880 --> 27:10.440]  would have been involved in in God guns and automobiles because it's it's
[27:10.440 --> 27:15.240]  turned out to be a pretty good show mildly libertarian mildly pro family
[27:15.240 --> 27:23.160]  mildly pro strong male figure mildly and the White House run media matters once
[27:23.160 --> 27:26.880]  it shut down I mean that's a big deal folks that the Canadian government says
[27:26.880 --> 27:32.600]  don't give Jenny McCarthy a show oh get man cow show off the media matters in
[27:32.600 --> 27:37.960]  MSNBC tell congressman don't go on Alex Jones a show we're gonna dictate to you
[27:37.960 --> 27:42.760]  drudgereport.com you don't link to him it's all about how they're the bosses
[27:42.760 --> 27:47.280]  when they have tiny audiences but it still works when they bully Fox News
[27:47.280 --> 27:52.040]  about Napolitano coming on Napolitano was told well media matters doesn't like
[27:52.040 --> 27:55.560]  you doing this and the White House is putting pressure on us so you can't go
[27:55.560 --> 27:59.960]  on his show or any other libertarian shows and there I've said it two years
[27:59.960 --> 28:03.760]  ago I was told that you notice he hasn't been on because of media matters
[28:03.760 --> 28:07.120]  they and you're like well how does media matters do that because the Justice
[28:07.120 --> 28:11.040]  Department will go arrest Rupert Murdoch and I was told that by Fox
[28:11.040 --> 28:17.200]  executives okay Fox executives repeatedly tried to get me up there for
[28:17.200 --> 28:21.880]  their Fox syndication development and I said no they said we'll just do just do
[28:21.880 --> 28:26.200]  satellite feeds for us with with focus groups and they said oh my god this show
[28:26.200 --> 28:31.360]  will be a hit we want this show Fox News I said okay just go ahead and pass it up
[28:31.360 --> 28:34.960]  and see if it gets authorized and of course it got killed and that's why
[28:34.960 --> 28:41.360]  they had articles in New York magazine going Alex Jones wants to be on Fox but
[28:41.360 --> 28:45.800]  he'll never be and I was a Fox executive saying that because they knew full
[28:45.800 --> 28:53.080]  well Fox came and begged me probably seven eight times to do shows pilot shows
[28:53.080 --> 28:57.520]  and I said no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[28:57.520 --> 29:01.640]  because I'm not stupid it's gonna get killed higher up I met with executives
[29:01.640 --> 29:07.160]  ten years ago and said gun shows will be top rated if you do it court TV true TV
[29:07.160 --> 29:12.560]  A&E I don't fly out to LA now and they go first class will fly out for this
[29:12.560 --> 29:16.240]  meeting with the president of this network or the vice president of that
[29:16.240 --> 29:20.640]  network or the head of programming and I go look you're just gonna pick my brain
[29:20.640 --> 29:25.720]  for more shows and even if the show gets picked up it's gonna get killed so no
[29:25.720 --> 29:30.000]  I mean I had development from Discovery Channel calling me two days ago I
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.400]  haven't even called him back and I'm not bragging here it's because I know they
[29:34.400 --> 29:39.480]  won't let me get on air or they'll twist it and so they want Jenny McCarthy off
[29:39.480 --> 29:43.600]  they want man cow off they wanted to show the Bible off these are a bunch of
[29:43.600 --> 29:48.360]  gatekeeping authoritarian gangster scumbags well guess what I got my own

[35:15.760 --> 35:19.840]  that was one of the late the latest ones they had another one demonizing the
[35:19.840 --> 35:22.840]  fact that he appears on this show and he's an acolyte and you're trying to
[35:22.840 --> 35:26.520]  drive a wedge it's what they do that's the authoritarian left deal is they
[35:26.520 --> 35:31.200]  tell you who you can have on air they tell you that if you don't support
[35:31.200 --> 35:37.640]  turning your guns in you are a a racist and again media matters has almost so
[35:37.640 --> 35:42.120]  visitors but they are the direct talking points for MSNBC on record and
[35:42.120 --> 35:45.800]  they're run by the former White House transition chief and about what 15 other
[35:45.800 --> 35:48.720]  White House people that and they have weekly meetings with the White House
[35:48.720 --> 35:53.560]  this is their their go-between they use the IRS to shut down tea party to shut
[35:53.560 --> 35:58.280]  down pro-life to shut down businesses they don't like NSA spying on the press
[35:58.280 --> 36:03.640]  these are flaming authoritarian scumbags and what came out three years
[36:03.640 --> 36:07.360]  ago in political they said we will even get hired at companies and we will
[36:07.360 --> 36:11.560]  infiltrate them and bring them down so we have to run background checks on
[36:11.560 --> 36:14.800]  people to make sure they don't even work with these I mean and I think we may have
[36:14.800 --> 36:18.280]  been hit by some before we're dealing with that right now I mean ladies and
[36:18.280 --> 36:22.800]  gentlemen that this is an intelligence operation we're facing and they want to
[36:22.800 --> 36:25.720]  bring drudge down and they want to bring anybody who isn't a complete
[36:25.720 --> 36:30.640]  communist basically or isn't a corporate fascist that supports only the
[36:30.640 --> 36:35.680]  insiders like Google and Apple and Al Gore on the board and the Foxcom death
[36:35.680 --> 36:38.760]  nets and all the rest of it if you're not part of their monopoly and their
[36:38.760 --> 36:45.760]  crew you ain't part of the club okay and so now they are really going after his
[36:45.760 --> 36:49.760]  show just like they try to shut down the Bible but see something's happening in
[36:49.760 --> 36:55.200]  Hollywood and TV the ratings are only for pro-gun pro-god Liberty stuff so to
[36:55.200 --> 36:57.840]  get in a half million views you get four million views ten million views
[36:57.840 --> 37:02.160]  14 million views and so the show has been picked up for a second season it's
[37:02.160 --> 37:05.880]  already exploding and just congratulations to mankind because I know he's
[37:05.880 --> 37:09.280]  been in a lot of TV shows and development he's offered me to be part of that I've
[37:09.280 --> 37:14.120]  been too busy but I just it's so good to see him going upstream and just a tire
[37:14.120 --> 37:17.800]  one of my favorite talk shows love being on with him incredible with he can
[37:17.800 --> 37:21.320]  crystallize things that takes me an hour to say in 30 seconds not kissing your
[37:21.320 --> 37:24.480]  butt man Cal you're a good first-rate guy and we're you know good buddies with
[37:24.480 --> 37:27.200]  Billy Corrigan we like to hang out you're just an awesome I want to do that
[37:27.200 --> 37:31.440]  that thing where we do the you know trip to the Kentucky Derby in a in a old
[37:31.440 --> 37:36.960]  Cadillac with Billy Corrigan and bring a film crew but minus the masculine with
[37:36.960 --> 37:41.760]  our own Gonzo journalism down and out in Vegas there but so much is going on
[37:41.760 --> 37:45.360]  they're not just going after you they're going after me Jenny McCarthy what is
[37:45.360 --> 37:49.880]  happening here and does it make you get angry to have these authoritarian black
[37:49.880 --> 37:53.560]  listing people that make McCarthy look like an angel I'm gonna tell you a
[37:53.560 --> 37:57.360]  story that I've never told anyone and you're not gonna believe where I'm
[37:57.360 --> 38:03.400]  going with this I was sitting with actor William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy
[38:03.400 --> 38:08.240]  Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock this is Alex you won't believe this story they are
[38:08.240 --> 38:15.080]  fighting over Leonard Nimoy double dipping in the avocado in the guacamole
[38:15.080 --> 38:19.920]  this is a Chattner's house outside of Studio City and we're watching the
[38:19.920 --> 38:23.120]  Super Bowl as we do every year at Chattner's house and they're fighting
[38:23.120 --> 38:27.840]  over Mr. Spock double dipping I just thought wait wait wait oh hey what just
[38:27.840 --> 38:32.000]  happened something happened on the Super Bowl we didn't know what
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.000]  Janet Jackson's top had been pulled off nobody saw that this party Ben Stiller
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.960]  was there and and Greg Avigan DJ in the bear and Adam West TV's Batman anyway
[38:40.960 --> 38:45.840]  we didn't really pay much attention to it when I came into work the next day the
[38:45.840 --> 38:52.560]  government was against me and Adam Corolla and towered Stern and opiate
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.560]  Anthony and any other show your show any other show that had an attempt you know
[38:58.560 --> 39:03.360]  fairly educated audience left or right that moved voters the government went
[39:03.360 --> 39:06.960]  after us now not the urban shows because they they weren't worried about those
[39:06.960 --> 39:10.920]  shows they're not moving people to vote they're not there they're not work they
[39:10.920 --> 39:14.800]  weren't worried about a stage stuff like that on purpose to then go after
[39:14.800 --> 39:19.440]  libertarian speech so so it just it was bizarre to me that because Janet Jackson's
[39:19.440 --> 39:23.880]  top got ripped off so I contacted Sterns because this is what I'm gonna tell you
[39:23.880 --> 39:28.120]  that nobody's ever heard I contacted Corolla's representative and and opiate
[39:28.120 --> 39:31.520]  Anthony's representative and I remember them being on the phone and others and I
[39:31.520 --> 39:35.800]  said guys we've got a fright we've got a fight for free speech we've got to all
[39:35.800 --> 39:38.880]  get together this is bigger than my show and I'm willing to fall on the sword
[39:38.880 --> 39:43.320]  this is bigger than all of our shows why are we being attacked we need to fight
[39:43.320 --> 39:47.560]  for free speech right now and
[39:49.560 --> 39:54.440]  opiate Anthony said something that was just they asked me about the size of my
[39:54.440 --> 39:59.040]  manhood or something and they everybody giggled on the phone and I went oh dear
[39:59.040 --> 40:02.640]  God these morons they don't realize what's coming for them and of course
[40:02.640 --> 40:06.600]  they've been they've been pushed off the satellite they've been marginalized and
[40:06.600 --> 40:12.160]  you know big corporations have picked up all of these shows as you know you see
[40:12.160 --> 40:15.880]  in our business for nothing and it's politically motivated imagine Rush
[40:15.880 --> 40:21.560]  Limbaugh the biggest talk show host on the planet ever now controlled by people
[40:21.560 --> 40:25.800]  that actually hate him Kennedy controlled by people that absolutely are
[40:25.800 --> 40:30.320]  on a mission to destroy these shows imagine working and now you're getting
[40:30.320 --> 40:33.520]  into inside baseball and this is what I've been told by top executives across
[40:33.520 --> 40:37.760]  the board there is a move to gut talk radio by design right now oh no that's
[40:37.760 --> 40:42.640]  actually look it's it's it's Alex let me tell you something it's over it's not
[40:42.640 --> 40:47.520]  it's already over and I mean you know you and I keep fighting it we keep but
[40:47.520 --> 40:53.600]  look it's it Alec Baldwin yelling out homophobic remarks Ray Gong Chong
[40:53.600 --> 40:57.320]  calling Oprah the n-word this is fine because they're on the left oh no he's
[40:57.320 --> 41:01.720]  allowed to say go to somebody's house and kill their children that is a call to
[41:01.720 --> 41:05.520]  murderous action and if he says that about my family I'm coming after you
[41:05.520 --> 41:10.840]  Baldwin yeah yesterday the government took a vote and they decided it was okay
[41:10.840 --> 41:15.360]  for the government to listen in on all of our phone calls oh yeah and and someone
[41:15.360 --> 41:19.080]  were someone today said to me well man how did that happen I said when I was a
[41:19.080 --> 41:24.000]  child I went backstage and I saw Hulk Hogan and the iron sheet hanging out
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.000]  and it blew my mind the republic is the democrats and I've hung out with all of
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.440]  them presidents and and all these politicians and they do the fake fight
[41:32.440 --> 41:36.120]  on TV you really do get into all the A-list parties man cow so you get to see
[41:36.120 --> 41:40.200]  it all I'm trying to tell you is well do you think the government's gonna vote to
[41:40.200 --> 41:45.520]  curtail their own behavior of course not it's a pageant it's fake and people
[41:45.520 --> 41:50.800]  need to get out of this matrix and realize that you know oh they voted oh
[41:50.800 --> 41:54.240]  and they're oh yeah and you trust Obama to you know end bush and all of the
[41:54.240 --> 42:02.200]  rest to to to police themselves well that's a great lie and I'm just I'm
[42:02.200 --> 42:06.160]  done with it so so look we have this little show it had the word guns in it
[42:06.160 --> 42:12.080]  it had the word guts in it it had automobiles in it and you know God and
[42:12.080 --> 42:18.160]  guns and guts and automobiles and and so everybody went out the CNBCs the MSNBCs
[42:18.160 --> 42:24.960]  the ABCCBS NBCs name them the BS's the government propaganda machines well this
[42:24.960 --> 42:30.520]  show is promoting it's gonna shove God down your throat it's gonna be about
[42:30.520 --> 42:35.640]  guns it's gonna be about big cars when the environment is being destroyed
[42:35.640 --> 42:41.080]  everything the show isn't about but it didn't matter lie after lie after lie
[42:41.080 --> 42:45.600]  and guess what the ratings have been stellar and America's responded to it
[42:45.600 --> 42:50.560]  like you justifiably said like the Bible they wanted that show look I was in in
[42:50.560 --> 42:54.120]  Hollywood after it and everybody's walking around going well why did people
[42:54.120 --> 42:59.520]  watch that what man cow what I mean they were baffled by it the fact is these
[42:59.520 --> 43:03.160]  you know these stories are the human stories these are our stories they
[43:03.160 --> 43:07.360]  resonate with us the story of Noah and Moses and and these guys don't get it
[43:07.360 --> 43:11.520]  they'd rather give us another you know Superman retread with with you know 30
[43:11.520 --> 43:17.920]  minutes of CGI these are incredible stories and look my family praise
[43:17.920 --> 43:25.560]  together family to praise together last you become you become undefeatable when
[43:25.560 --> 43:30.040]  you put on the armor we believe that we should protect our family with a gun if
[43:30.040 --> 43:36.080]  necessary we believe in big old American cars and American trucks and I gotta
[43:36.080 --> 43:41.480]  tell you we're a little bit racist we believe in black cattle and and I'll
[43:41.480 --> 43:46.200]  tell you we also we shouldn't pick a color we believe in green tractors and
[43:46.200 --> 43:51.080]  this is very offensive to some people we don't believe in buying our tractors
[43:51.080 --> 43:56.240]  from China so anyway it's just it's it look I just I want to tell people new
[43:56.240 --> 44:01.040]  levels new devils and if nobody is upset of you well then you're not making a
[44:01.040 --> 44:05.440]  difference in the world if nobody cares about you or your opinion that's because
[44:05.440 --> 44:09.440]  you're safe you're going along you're marching off the cliff with the rest of
[44:09.440 --> 44:13.880]  the lemmings so they really got mad they really got mad because the ad for the
[44:13.880 --> 44:17.400]  show shows you and your brother putting on wedding rings and loving your wives
[44:17.400 --> 44:21.480]  that's that's I mean you're supposed to be running around cheating on them you
[44:21.480 --> 44:26.400]  know having some baby mamas you know smoking look look looking dope Kanye
[44:26.400 --> 44:31.280]  West and Kim Kardashian I mean you know he just beat up somebody and they said
[44:31.280 --> 44:35.680]  it was a jet lag he was tired imagine if you beat up somebody Alex imagine if you
[44:35.680 --> 44:38.800]  beat up one of these pedophiles or creeps at the airport one of these TSA
[44:38.800 --> 44:44.280]  tugs you know you you talk about how these guys are all getting cancer well
[44:44.280 --> 44:47.480]  you know what they should be in jail they've all violated the fourth amendment
[44:47.480 --> 44:51.480]  but but anyway you kid you know if you forget you have the story of today they
[44:51.480 --> 45:00.640]  just spent $767,000 on gold toilet these people are rewarded and of course if
[45:00.640 --> 45:04.880]  you're if you're out there saying car taxes are too high businesses are being
[45:04.880 --> 45:10.720]  hurt our economy is being destroyed by design you're racist well no you what
[45:10.720 --> 45:14.080]  happens is then you know you get the IRS on you I've been audited year after
[45:14.080 --> 45:18.680]  year illegally and it's now all on record that they're persecuting is I
[45:18.680 --> 45:22.840]  want to play a short clip about Jenny McCarthy I mean there's no doubt on so
[45:22.840 --> 45:26.400]  many studies the inserts of the vaccines said they can kill you or cause an
[45:26.400 --> 45:30.920]  autoimmune disease but then they go oh this crazy woman thinks vaccines should
[45:30.920 --> 45:35.560]  be looked into and now they want her kicked off the view it just even if you
[45:35.560 --> 45:40.320]  don't agree with that everyone should go my god this is authoritarianism what
[45:40.320 --> 45:44.600]  the left said about McCarthy they've gone light years past that telling pro
[45:44.600 --> 45:48.400]  live groups what they can pray let's go to this clip and get mancals take on it
[45:48.400 --> 45:52.120]  if you're a media consumer or media analyst like yourself controversial
[45:52.120 --> 45:56.040]  figures nothing do I mean we know that what but there's something different
[45:56.040 --> 46:00.240]  about Jenny McCarthy that's come up in the last 48 hours that really has
[46:00.240 --> 46:04.520]  received a lot of attention oh why are people so concerned about this move
[46:04.520 --> 46:08.960]  well Jenny McCarthy is funny she's a former playboy playmate of the year but
[46:08.960 --> 46:12.640]  she's been getting pummeled in the media Jenna because she is a leading crusader
[46:12.640 --> 46:17.600]  for this utterly discredited theory that childhood vaccinations cause autism now
[46:17.600 --> 46:22.120]  I'm sure she is sincere in that she has a son who developed autism but medical
[46:22.120 --> 46:26.800]  study after medical study why this is junk science a recent one of nearly a
[46:26.800 --> 46:30.040]  thousand children in the Journal of Pediatrics a lot of moms watch the view
[46:30.040 --> 46:34.440]  I don't know whether she'll be talking about it on the air but it does have an
[46:34.440 --> 46:37.960]  effect the the these are just enough about that they go on to say she should
[46:37.960 --> 46:41.480]  basically shouldn't have the show and now the Canadian government says she
[46:41.480 --> 46:46.760]  shouldn't have a show by the way mancal I mean there are studies everywhere that
[46:46.760 --> 46:50.440]  vaccines are causing autoimmune problems and doing all sorts of stuff we've gone
[46:50.440 --> 46:55.320]  from one in 25,000 with autism to one in 50 something it's an epidemic but what
[46:55.320 --> 46:59.640]  about this idea because in her own private life she's made statements about
[46:59.640 --> 47:04.680]  vaccines being dangerous that she can't have a show this is this is wild Alex
[47:04.680 --> 47:10.640]  Alex I'm gonna take a left turn on you okay yes and you talk about how you
[47:10.640 --> 47:14.040]  want free speech can I have free speech yes you're not gonna like what I'm
[47:14.040 --> 47:21.400]  gonna say the fact is folks I know the truth about Alex Jones and that is that
[47:21.400 --> 47:26.560]  he's a softy and a lot of what you hear on the show is bluster kicking around
[47:26.560 --> 47:29.880]  town kicking around Austin Texas with him was one of the great joys of my life
[47:29.880 --> 47:35.800]  he is a poop in a good way you would want him at your party he's not a very
[47:35.800 --> 47:42.080]  serious guy he's a very fun guy and around his children he's silly he acts
[47:42.080 --> 47:47.080]  like he's about five years old as I do with my kids and I want to tell you and
[47:47.080 --> 47:54.440]  it's gonna be hard for me to fight back the emotion because of my blessings and
[47:54.440 --> 47:59.200]  and the role that I've had and the ability to facilitate so much
[47:59.200 --> 48:02.840]  communication what am I even talking about let me let me let me get to it
[48:02.840 --> 48:08.000]  I've come out of my studio and seen people with 13 year old girls and baby
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.400]  strollers 15 year old kids on gurneys and they said man Cal I had a healthy
[48:14.400 --> 48:21.000]  beautiful child they got the vaccine and their eyes rolled back in their head
[48:21.000 --> 48:29.760]  and they've never talked to sense their faces went blank and that was it are
[48:29.760 --> 48:33.800]  all these people lying Alex they're trying to get the truth out look and the
[48:33.800 --> 48:38.200]  fact is I don't know the science and I tend to think of Jenny McCarthy as a you
[48:38.200 --> 48:42.920]  know a playmate that was very annoying when she dated Jim Carrey she's been in
[48:42.920 --> 48:46.960]  my studio she's you know she's a bubble head but I think her stance against the
[48:46.960 --> 48:50.720]  pharmaceutical companies is very brave we used to get one shot at a time now
[48:50.720 --> 48:55.840]  they bundled them and I think for some young bodies some young systems immune
[48:55.840 --> 49:00.200]  systems and again I don't know this I don't know my uncle almost died from a
[49:00.200 --> 49:03.560]  tetanus shot the doctors admitted it was the tetanus shot he swole up for two
[49:03.560 --> 49:07.880]  weeks almost died it's just too much for you know 20 shots at once in a single
[49:07.880 --> 49:12.240]  dose and I just think it's too much for some of these young you know it's
[49:12.240 --> 49:18.240]  systems Japan just banned the Gardasil shot man Cal yeah yeah you know and and
[49:18.240 --> 49:23.960]  look look who is who's crazy now Elizabeth Hasselbeck is crazy Jenny
[49:23.960 --> 49:28.360]  McCarthy who questions all of these drugs we're putting into I don't know I
[49:28.360 --> 49:34.160]  this is some kind of bizarro or Wellie in world we're living in well they
[49:34.160 --> 49:36.840]  mentioned the journal of pediatrics the journal of pediatrics funded by the
[49:36.840 --> 49:40.640]  government came out and said mercury is good for children's brains we have a
[49:40.640 --> 49:46.840]  clip we're gonna queue it up play it after the break but I mean man Cal how
[49:46.840 --> 49:52.160]  crazy has all this gotten it Alex yeah Alex if you if you if you if you took
[49:52.160 --> 49:54.600]  your I mean I'm just I want to relate this back to you I've seen you with
[49:54.600 --> 49:57.560]  your children if you took your kid to the doctor the kid got a shot and it
[49:57.560 --> 50:00.800]  never spoke again wouldn't you be smart enough to go there's a connection and

[50:08.600 --> 50:13.320]  it can do it on the insert that's that's what's so crazy is that they admit

[54:26.080 --> 54:29.880]  channel very wholesome but also funny man his brother could be like a we in

[54:36.000 --> 54:39.800]  sounds just like his little brother Eric Mankow Muller who's with us you know I
[54:39.800 --> 54:43.520]  don't want to just say on air the journal of pediatrics says that Mercury's
[54:43.520 --> 54:46.680]  good for your child's brain of course they've got over a thousand mainline
[54:46.680 --> 54:49.160]  studies you can look up I say a thousand it's more like ten thousand
[54:49.160 --> 54:52.240]  Mercury's one of the most studied things out there you can just type in
[54:52.240 --> 54:58.000]  electro microscope and and you could see what Mercury does compared to all
[54:58.000 --> 55:03.280]  their heavy metals it causes electro convulsive explosions in the electro
[55:03.280 --> 55:06.960]  chemical brain cells it's the most destructive metal in the brain you can
[55:06.960 --> 55:12.040]  find all the different university you know microscope footage of that and we've
[55:12.040 --> 55:15.960]  done this before but here is KI that this aired nationwide because they have
[55:15.960 --> 55:19.880]  news packages that air locally this was a national only written piece but this
[55:19.880 --> 55:23.560]  aired in Austin and they say this still I think the Harvard says right here
[55:23.560 --> 55:28.280]  Mercury is good for your child's brain let's go ahead and go to that clip
[55:28.280 --> 55:33.040]  mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new
[55:33.040 --> 55:36.920]  studies in the journal pediatrics there have been widespread concerns that
[55:36.920 --> 55:40.520]  mercury based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological
[55:40.520 --> 55:44.600]  development of children these new studies suggest that the offices that the
[55:44.600 --> 55:48.400]  preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental
[55:48.400 --> 55:52.800]  performance by the way boys IQ's you can pull this up Harvard study by the way
[55:52.800 --> 55:58.400]  over 20 point reduction girls about 17 and this is going on it's a fact they're
[55:58.400 --> 56:02.960]  killing us and next they're going to say cyanide is good for your child and if
[56:02.960 --> 56:07.800]  Jenny McCarthy doesn't agree she should be fired from the view man cow
[56:07.800 --> 56:17.160]  it's bizarre world isn't it what do you think about it literally I used to go on
[56:17.160 --> 56:20.520]  your show 10 12 years ago and you even thought I was a good but you you're more
[56:20.520 --> 56:23.680]  conspiracy you know the most people I mean come on man cow it's all come true
[56:23.680 --> 56:31.200]  so far wait a minute let me let me say something okay I I want to tell you
[56:31.200 --> 56:36.000]  there's a I had a moment where I opened up my window I was on the 35th floor on
[56:36.000 --> 56:45.200]  Whacker Street in Chicago and open up my window and there was a helicopter on
[56:45.200 --> 56:49.560]  silent mode looking at me unmarked and I got on and talked about it and I was
[56:49.560 --> 56:54.160]  insane I absolutely thought it happened and every ball he's insane and now of
[56:54.160 --> 56:57.680]  course we take it for granted you came on my show and talked about drones on
[56:57.680 --> 57:04.920]  American soil and I thought you were crazy and you told me other things that
[57:04.920 --> 57:09.920]  NSA chemicals in the water now it's all mainstream last excuse me two nights ago
[57:09.920 --> 57:12.880]  they did the military exercises again where they did the crackdown of the city
[57:12.880 --> 57:16.480]  Chicago where I'm at why is the military practicing attacking American
[57:16.480 --> 57:21.440]  cities because they know that the economy is teetering on the brink I love
[57:21.440 --> 57:25.720]  CBS last night they can't figure out why nobody's buying into this this economy
[57:25.720 --> 57:29.480]  being fantastic because it's not all you have to do is drive down the street see
[57:29.480 --> 57:33.400]  another store front board it up every day you see another one all you have to do
[57:33.400 --> 57:37.520]  is talk to anyone you know about how how the economy is affecting their family
[57:37.520 --> 57:40.960]  all you have to do is talk to any business owner about what Obamacare is
[57:40.960 --> 57:44.320]  going to do the communist health care then you question well why would John
[57:44.320 --> 57:48.880]  Roberts and others turn their back on their foundation why would a Supreme
[57:48.880 --> 57:53.240]  Court justice that go against everything he stands for for communist
[57:53.240 --> 57:57.360]  health care it's clearly illegal clearly unconstitutional and then this guy
[57:57.360 --> 58:02.720]  sitting over in Russia who got a book deal yesterday Snowden the leaker you
[58:02.720 --> 58:07.400]  know tells us oh they listen almost Supreme Court conversations so I
[58:07.400 --> 58:11.160]  believe that these guys are being blackmailed and controlled by our government
[58:11.160 --> 58:15.080]  I want to tell you I want to tell you about you know this special class the
[58:15.080 --> 58:19.120]  government and judges that nobody can say anything to there was a preacher here

[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:45.840]  phone calls now you were telling a story about a preacher in Chicago he
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.320]  basically said look if he's in court he said if the judge doesn't judge me then
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:53.760]  God will judge her God judges all of us and of course that's a threat and they
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.920]  want to put the pastor in jail this is what's happened in Canada where they
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.200]  make Christian preachers everything that a Christian says his hate speech oh
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.840]  yeah I saw that yeah yeah yeah in fact I want to put him in jail for saying fine
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:11.200]  God will gentle they hate that yeah and then quickly the number two book in
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.000]  America is called zealot written and everybody's interviewed this writer who
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.120]  is a an Islamo fascist anti-Christian Muslim nobody mentions that in their
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.080]  interviews and people are reading this book thinking that Christianity was made
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:29.560]  up and he's basically using the line that a lot of Islamo fascists use two
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.360]  other quick things Alex two other quick things yes we want to talk about here
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.800]  we go 93-year-old woman raped and beaten almost to death by an illegal
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.520]  I thought it was only scientists and then the next person was going to cure
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:45.080]  cancer it was coming here illegally what about all these great people that are
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:49.000]  breaking into our country we keep hearing about one other thing I was in
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  Kansas City filming the TV show for the History Channel and I've been all over
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.920]  America I was in New York when the riots were supposed to break out I I I think
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:02.360]  it's really a great time right now in America we talked about the negatives
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:06.320]  let me say something great Al Sharpton my friend he's a friend of mine we don't
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.000]  agree on anything politically but Jesse Jackson and others have tried to stir
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.920]  up the race hate that's how they make their money if we talked on your show
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.520]  today you think it's backfiring brother I want to tell you I think you and I
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:23.080]  talked about this I think it's I think it's wonderful that African Americans
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.640]  have woken up and so you know what we're not buying into it we're not going to
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:31.160]  burn our neighborhoods we've done that it's stupid not a single white person
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:35.480]  thinks Zimmerman is is white
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:41.840]  Trayvon's record is that he had burglary tools in his in his locker and stole a
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.800]  night and the suppressed photos on his phone was a gun and loot reportedly the
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.240]  guy look the guy was violent this rap music is violent this is what the
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.160]  culture is producing anyway look you the kid was probably doing ropitas and
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.880]  watermelon soda and skittles it's a hot drug here now in Chicago I mean look at
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.640]  the gangster photos he was putting out sport in the full grill and the gangster
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.720]  you know flavor flay look look I've interviewed some of the jurors and let
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.800]  me tell you what I've come to believe Alex and I want to share this quickly
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:12.200]  with your audience Zimmerman would have gotten two or three years he probably
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.120]  should have spent a year to in jail sorry I know that offends some people a kid
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.200]  was killed I wish Trayvon had not been killed but the judge was so repulsive and
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.000]  I believe so pressured by Obama to put Zimmerman in jail for 25 years that when
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.840]  the jury said you know what if we give it over to this judge he's gonna put him
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.600]  away for 25 years she's gonna put Zimmerman away forever and we can't do
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.040]  that had this judge been reasonable and not so obviously by that's what Jimmy
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.440]  Carter said yeah they overcharged him they overcharged him wasn't that judge
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.920]  just a giant pile of Bravo Sierra what's that that judge look like a giant
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.040]  steaming pile of Bravo Sierra you look like something to Java would poop out
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:59.920]  it's exactly that's good I'm gonna steal that job a poop so all right well
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.460]  brother listen I appreciate your your props on the show and you're a tough
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:07.800]  critic so I appreciate it and it look it's it is about family and I think you
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.720]  know crazy people in Austin just like in Chicago we believe in family exactly
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.320]  listen you've offered me in these TV pitches to be part of it I'm always just
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.960]  too busy and I don't believe they're gonna give me a show I've been offered a
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.920]  bunch of others in the contracts but it's too controlling but I love appearing
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.320]  in shows what happened with Jesse he didn't want to do it anymore and they
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.960]  offered me that show basically in other shows and they're all good guys but that
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.080]  you don't control it so so that's basically why I didn't do it you know
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.680]  how much work it is I'm gonna how you do a daily radio show and do these shows
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.360]  it's it's it's tough well my brother film seven days a week I film three days a

[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:21.240]  decades and the police have been told to lie and say that there is no quota
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:27.480]  system folks the DWI police in Austin make over $100,000 a year while the
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:33.600]  other cops make 40,000 50,000 and that's why they pull you over been drinking

[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:44.520]  big cash machine nothing to do with your safety texting while driving is five
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.640]  times more dangerous you don't need drunk driving laws if someone's

[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.600]  dashcam video are they testified to that then you've been drinking probable

[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:45.520]  home to sprawling planes Auburn University and a troubling police force
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.960]  after the arrival of the new police chief the department entered an era of
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:53.360]  ticket quotas and worse yeah you know why I like the Travis County Sheriff's
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.000]  Department from what I've seen in it they don't have a quota I mean you got a

[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:11.320]  cash machine and now these state police aren't like they used to be I mean they
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.440]  pull you over there they're there and they'll even know who I am but I've
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:18.080]  learned they do this to everybody they're not singling me out and you do

[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.040]  New World Order and let me explain something to the police no amount of
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.880]  tickets are going to keep the cities and counties and states going they're run
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.400]  by city managers almost every case I've had city managers a major cities on to
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.120]  admit this 75% of the money or more goes into offshore banks it's called the
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.800]  comprehensive annual financial report the budget is less than a third of the
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.600]  real money everything's about the budget they never tell you about the other set
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.000]  of books it's sleight of hands the money's all gone folks it's all
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.520]  actuaried look up that term don't know what it is to bankrupt us we will all go
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:22.120]  the way of Detroit if they have their way I don't know how else to explain it
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:30.280]  to you except for lower Manhattan Austin Texas San Francisco Whitefish you
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:36.520]  know Montana and a few other places elite listed agenda 21 technocratic
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:41.160]  command zones you're like that sounds like Hunger Games yeah that's science
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.640]  fiction product placement propaganda placement they call it behavior
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:50.160]  placement years after I coined the term propaganda placement the feds call it
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:55.240]  behavior placement that's basically what they'd like to build that's the
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:59.600]  plutocratic New World Order Club of Rome vision the technocrat vision is even
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:04.040]  worse just get rid of everybody the minute China has robots in for everything
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.840]  they hit the virus button okay just it's released
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.340]  they're not building a technocratic system though to to to just have
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:20.120]  dominance they're doing it to replace humans then they're gonna turn the
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.960]  robots off and folks this is not my opinion I I just cannot warn you
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.880]  strongly enough you better go read what all the top futurist and globalist from
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:32.880]  raker as well to build joy right down the line you better find out that what
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.840]  they're saying is actual policy it isn't some pipe dream and the technocrats
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.560]  have now merged with the plutocrats and they have merged the program into a
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:48.320]  neo feudalistic surf system not to create a plutocratic endless surf system a
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:53.080]  Hunger Games scenario to bring in the robots to implode the economies to get
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:58.080]  full control over humans and an artificial scarcity system see the robots
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.960]  and automation mean we according to all the physicists and researchers and
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:05.160]  academics that I've interviewed and I and I agree with their analysis it's
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.880]  accurate we should be working two days a week coming up with ideas to empower
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:19.120]  humanity having giant corporate and and and public buy-in kind of massive scale
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.520]  crowdsourcing programs there should be a global crowdsourcing program for
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:29.080]  space stations there should be a global crowdsourcing program for moon bases
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.800]  there should be a global and they've all discussed this they could do this you'd
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:37.640]  work two days a week we'd be wearing frickin aluminum outfits with jet packs
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.320]  folks I'm telling you and that's already what the globalist have okay
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:49.400]  they're just not giving you that we're 2013 baby we're in the future makes me
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:55.600]  so upset instead the public wants their culture of bling I don't care if you're
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.760]  a gangster type or one of these yuppies with their bling you know that's the
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.200]  perfect $50,000 bike I'm talking about bicycle in the outfit in the country
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.440]  club and you're part of the elite you're not part of anything you're not part of
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.760]  the elite you're an elite thinker for humanity nobody's elite joining the
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:17.400]  dark side lying to yourself thinking you're part of a winning operation this
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:22.440]  is the most selfish disgusting new world order situation I've ever seen see one
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.360]  article just makes me go crazy because that's how I think I know the cops are
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:33.040]  told that oh if you don't write tickets we're gonna go bankrupt oh you know
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:37.640]  there's a shortfall they're like all right I don't go out and you know
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:43.400]  cops don't go after bad guys anymore folks just too much of the bad guy
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.960]  operations are run by higher level government groups being funded by
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:52.080]  corporations to turn to blind eye that's on record and that's why Chicago crime
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:56.800]  bosses in New York crime bosses and all these guys hate the fact the citizens
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.760]  who've got guns because how are they ever gonna fully take over implode
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.800]  things and socially engineer us if we've got guns how are they gonna have
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:10.160]  race wars and collapsing societies when all of the evil blue states and all of
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.320]  the evil red states and being sarcastic have to be played off against each other
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:20.280]  when it won't work if everybody's armed the gangsters won our guns 800 25
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:26.480]  99231 and if you don't write tickets you get written up and then removed off
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:31.480]  the force and now if you don't go and help the CPS take kids you get thrown
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:37.040]  off the force and now if you on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.640]  on and on and on and on and on and on and you get told go out and violate
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.880]  people's rights you know we're doing it for their own good blah blah blah but
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:52.360]  you know that wealthy areas they pull over a black guy driving a hundred
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:56.240]  thousand dollar Mercedes in a suit the cops aren't gonna violate his rights
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.360]  they pull over a hundred you know a thousand dollar Mercedes with a white
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.440]  guy wearing a Normani suit they're not gonna violate his rights statistically
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.040]  because they know this guy's got lawyers this guy knows what he's doing of
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.800]  course they're gonna violate poor blacks rights and poor whites rights in

[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:33.440]  days ago admitted we're turning into a total police state and that militarized
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:37.640]  police wage war against an enemy which makes us the enemy well yeah no they

[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:47.480]  documents and get them out to people I talk to people all the time I mean people

[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:12.440]  them get very far or have any power but they can live another one is the Catholic
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:17.000]  catechism I would like your comments on that what it has to say because I see a
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.520]  lot of freedom a lot of humanity there and I'm not giving up never fall taxes

[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.160]  rid of checks and balances rule of law you become an immoral people the very
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.920]  worst will take over because they want to exercise mass death they want burning

[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:19.520]  I mean you see attacks on all basic Christian religion because it talks
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:24.760]  about family and not having abortion and because God is above the state and the
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:28.400]  state wants to be God so it wants to get rid of its competition whether you
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:32.000]  believe in God or not the atheists are like we don't have God given rights the
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.040]  state gives us our rights so the state can take it away even if you're an
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:39.920]  atheist you should say I believe I don't you know get my rights from the state I
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.960]  have an individual right well they go well you're just an animal actually you
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:46.080]  don't have free will so let us decide what you're gonna do cuz you know free
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:48.800]  will doesn't matter we just want to make the decisions you don't need to make
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.520]  decisions you can't make decisions but we're gonna make them for you it's all
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:59.560]  mind games good to hear from you JB in Hawaii you're on the air go ahead hey
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:04.200]  good morning Alex I'm calling about something interesting with the NSA
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.080]  Google connection there that you've been documenting for years so I had signed up
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:13.920]  for the Google voice which they as you know give free phone call through
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:20.400]  integrated in their Gmail service and for the longest time I would get voicemail
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:24.720]  you know an email sent to my account saying you've got a voicemail from a
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:30.200]  random number that you don't know and the voicemail might be one minute it might
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:37.440]  be 15 minutes of people going about their daily business and you're being
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:44.160]  recorded and transmitted by their cell phone and then it's getting sent to me
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:48.920]  for no reason so first I called say did you call this number no what are you
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:54.240]  talking about I've got I just pulled them up here on my account for you know
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:58.760]  going back two years dozens of these yeah let me explain what's going on when
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:04.560]  you build backdoors into the dishwashers the computers the smartphones all of it
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:11.520]  it it puts added cost on everybody and then it causes a lot of compatibility
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:16.680]  problems because everything is really built to spy and control you and then
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:20.880]  it allows other third-party groups to break in and use the data then the
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.880]  government uses as an excuse to get more power and then they're using face
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.040]  scanning technology to tell of your wealthy or not to then charge you extra
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:33.840]  or to tell what you'll buy even if it costs too much if you're poor that's
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:36.520]  what the customer loyalty cards have always been about is to track your
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:41.320]  behavior so they can rip you off I mean it's all just a giant gaming system
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:45.480]  people say well why should I be private you know I have nothing to hide well then
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:48.400]  why don't you leave your house open at night because there's bad people out
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:53.600]  there well it's the same thing they they they are using all this to have an
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:58.440]  advantage economically to dominate and control you and to figure out how to
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.000]  game you the smart meters 20 years ago when they were coming out with them said
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.280]  we're going to control what's in your house we're going to charge you at big
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:09.200]  times and we're going to use this to increase prices and they're now doing it
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:15.360]  and so we're just saying oh we trust you because it's bad to not trust people
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.840]  you don't know see you're supposed to trust people you don't know trust the
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:23.960]  government that's virtue but don't trust your family all the sitcoms all the
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:28.640]  dramas fight with your family fight with your husband fight with your wife
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:34.480]  trust the government it's the opposite of how things should work and so yeah I
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:37.400]  mean you get calls on your cell phone where people are breathing you get other
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:42.960]  people's voicemails because it's all run through these big hubs now and a lot of
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:49.000]  the compatibility problems it just it just compounds technological problems
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:56.600]  that everything is having snooping hubs put in front of it see yes I just wanted
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:00.160]  to put that out there you know that or is it them you know right in our face
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:04.520]  with it if I could just one thing I wanted to say I agree with you that
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.840]  resistance is victory and gotta resist them every time you can I always opt
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:13.400]  out I always make a point to tell them you guys put the underpants bomber on
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:19.560]  the plane they admit it I pull up the the documentation I've got you know I've
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:24.400]  been there where the TSA come around and then I have to say you know they have
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:28.920]  you that give you the pat down and then I'm forced to stand there right at the
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:33.800]  line and record you know the rest of the time there no that's what they're
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:37.760]  teaching you that you're a suspect when of course the people running the
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:41.880]  country stage the terror so they can get trillions and no bid contracts and
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:46.600]  take over society and spy on everyone and get away with bloody murder and
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.560]  invade whatever countries they want of course they did it of course they
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:54.320]  finance terrorist I appreciate your call then they say oh you're saying there's no
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:58.080]  terrorist no there's real Muslim extremists the point is the globalist
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:03.080]  funds them publicly do I get apologized to when all that gets admitted no I'm
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:10.360]  that much worse oh I'm so horrible look people have a decision to make we're
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:14.000]  gonna lose everything because we're letting corruption grow or we can wake
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.120]  up that admit we're in trouble and try to turn the tide but if the general
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:23.640]  public not our listeners but new listeners people that are in denial last

[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:51.000]  me that I have gone kind of crazy though I mean the stuff I talk about is real
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:57.640]  and true but yeah it's gotten to me it's gotten to me too to just watch most

[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:11.600]  first-time caller I really appreciate it just a few things I'd like to make a
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:16.680]  comment and then ask you a question after this I'd like to do more mainstream TV
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:21.120]  and you know I think that really help out you know to get get the word out there
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:24.720]  I know I learned about you on History Channel and you did that show at Brad
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:28.600]  Meltzer stuff I think that would just be huge to really open and things up and
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:33.000]  getting people to know things here's the deal if I do a Brad Metzger thing it's
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.080]  two days you know go to Bohemian Grove again or I do that show on Masons it's
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:42.720]  one day or I mean I've been on a bunch of shows they offered me a travel channel
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:46.360]  show and I said I couldn't do it even though that was only a few weeks to shoot
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:51.200]  the season just because I've got to do the show all this is to keep this
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:57.040]  running I mean you understand you can only serve so much I can't do it all it
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:00.080]  it's kind of like I can't have two families you know I've got to like
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:05.520]  focus on what I'm doing yes sir I would take whatever opportunity you could
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:08.920]  possibly in the future I just think that that's huge you know toward getting the
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:13.720]  word out there and then also I'd like to let people know that that cannabis truly
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:19.240]  does cure cancer and if they go on YouTube to run from the cure with Rick
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:23.320]  Simpson they can learn about hemp oil and how it truly does cure cancer we
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:26.240]  need to really well there's a lot of people that say they have cures to
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:32.080]  things there are major studies showing hemp oil has amazing effects on on on
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:37.400]  not getting cancer as quickly and it and can help mitigate it but I think saying
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:44.280]  things your cures you are listening to GCN and I don't want people to end up
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:47.400]  getting cancer think something's gonna cure and I blame me you know I mean

[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:11.240]  nothing to do about it because there's no Democratic Party really to speak of in

[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:19.640]  quick you're the one who woke me up so much so that I went ahead on the fourth
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:24.120]  July open my own website and that's where my problem started I start now
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:29.040]  feeling and experiencing in a small amount of what you much majorly
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:34.400]  experienced I've had the cops coming to my door I've had them take pictures of
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:38.640]  my trash can't what's inside like trash but the biggest slap in the face was
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:44.520]  when I had to go through DC recently I can't carry my gun anymore legally in
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:50.720]  DC because I'm now no longer cop there I pull up to a intersection stopped at
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:56.200]  the light then I was recognized by someone on the side of the street as a
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:01.600]  cop his friend started running over the car I went through the red light got
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:06.360]  picked her through or got caught on camera doing it and after an appeal
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:10.960]  process of trying to you know explain why I went through it like everything the
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:16.480]  DMV has decided that doesn't matter if I'm trying to save my own life I still
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:20.520]  went through the light and I have to pay them $150 right now what happens they
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:24.920]  really target former military and police as they admit any purge does that
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:30.920]  Hitler Stalin Mao they all do that and you know I would sue them over get in
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:34.840]  your trash I would go follow them around because you see it's actually when
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:39.600]  you're small at first is when they try to scare you off so you don't grow into
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:44.120]  but you fit a profile of a leader and so that's why they do that and the
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:51.160]  answer is intensify what you do 10 times and you know just basically see with

[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:48.240]  Norm Stamper is known for his roles as the Chief of Police the Department
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:54.800]  responsible for Seattle's response to the protests at WTO Congress 99 and of
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:58.240]  course he's also written the best-selling book breaking a rank that I've
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:01.640]  read great reviews effect I meant to get him on years ago but was unable to so
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:06.480]  I'm glad he's here with us he's a top cops expose the dark side of American
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:11.280]  policing and has starred in the marijuana documentary the Union the business
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:17.800]  behind getting high cops say legalized drugs dot com and my whole issue is lots
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:22.680]  of areas of Europe have decriminalized and crime rates of some areas 50% but
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:28.960]  they drop everywhere you takes the money out of it and he joins us now to talk
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:34.560]  about that but I got to tell you before we go there just looking at the whole
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:39.520]  landscape of policing I know you've spoken out since you resigned and you know
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:42.520]  I appreciate that fact I've agreed with a lot of what I've seen you say on the
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:46.120]  news sir did you see the Wall Street Journal two days ago the rise of the
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:51.080]  warrior cop it's time to reconsider the militarization of American policing I
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:56.320]  mean military kills people and breaks things and occupies and more and more
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:00.480]  if I go to the kite festival they have the National Guard out with police
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:05.080]  searching everyone when if I was a bomber I just bomb the checkpoint I
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:09.960]  mean it's it does nothing but I guess set the precedent that we're all
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:14.400]  prisoners and defense contractors are selling you know two million dollar
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:18.560]  robots to every city and we've got surveillance drones and blimps I mean
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:23.600]  this is like something out of a Kurt Vonnegut novel so chief it's a good to
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:29.040]  have you on with us via video Skype well I tell you I mean you heard me kind of
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:43.800]  throw all that out there what do you think about what's going on yeah we've
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:47.640]  got a Skype problem with the police chief we've had a Skype problem with
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:51.280]  the last few guests and we're gonna get him connected be a phone line right now
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:56.600]  but we've got a routing issue with our system and we've established that now
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:02.760]  that that's going on so we are going to connect with him via telephone and do
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:07.080]  that or he'll be the last Skype guess we ever have again with this new
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:10.560]  precedent-setting system we have the reason I'm a little frustrated on air is
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:15.320]  I know it's our system it does that with every guest now and we just was
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:19.920]  waiting for that to prove I was right to happen on air with a giant galactic
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:24.480]  sized train wreck let's go directly to telephone guys this is gonna now be the
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:27.840]  thing of trying to get it to work and then we won't have the police chief on
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:33.800]  but another day we will have him on let's go to Ryan in Michigan Ryan you're
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:38.840]  on the air thank you for holding today to be on the broadcast with us Ryan no
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:43.700]  problem sir um I just want to warn everybody out there about that
[02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:51.840]  Gardasil vaccine I had got it before I went to college and then once I got to
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:57.440]  college I started getting real sick a lot like probably two or three times a
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:03.800]  month just like stomach bugs and everything then I find out I have a
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:11.120]  cardiomyopathy and and now it's gonna be it's it's just crazy so I'm in the
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:17.840]  process of seeing doctors and right now so I just wanted to warn everybody out
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:22.800]  there about that you know just don't put things in your body that you don't
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:29.240]  know what it is or what the hell they put in there so it's caused me a lot of
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:37.520]  heartache a lot of money a lot of time so yeah they they they come out with
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:41.840]  guilt they say turn your guns in or you cause Sandy Hook they come out they say
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:45.200]  support government-run health care you're a racist and people go okay I
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:48.680]  support it and and they've come out in the last two years and said men need to
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:53.240]  take this you're the one you're giving women this virus and then the vaccine
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:56.840]  says it doesn't even protect you from the virus on the insert and it killed
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:03.320]  people in the trial and it's it's been it's been banned all over the world and
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:09.480]  but it's still here because we believe I mean why does you get the Gardasil shot
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:16.520]  because the doctor told me that it would protect me against STDs and I never
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:22.080]  got all three of the shots I only got two of them and then I left for college
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:28.840]  so and then like when my mom works for GE capital you know my brother was a
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:34.160]  veteran I'm a typical American middle-class you know yeah well you need
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:38.880]  to sue Gardasil thousands of others are and I mean they knew full well what
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:40.800]  they were doing they knew they couldn't put her on the market because all the
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:44.720]  deaths they just have the government mandated and it's just terrible God
[02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:47.520]  bless you sir and I'm sorry to sorry to hear that happen to you please warn
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:51.840]  everybody you can't wow okay I really wanted him on for a long time as you
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:57.000]  know so much about what's going on and he is the best-selling author of breaking
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:01.480]  rank a top cops expose of the dark side of American policing and he was the
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:05.040]  police chief during the WTO conference and all of that that happened he's with
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:09.640]  cops say legalizeddrugs.com and also normal and again a norm
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:13.280]  stamper chief good to have you on with us what do you think of the way police
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:18.360]  exchanged overall in this country I'm troubled by it deeply troubled by it as
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:23.120]  a matter of fact I think in the wake of 9-11 and also because of the the impetus
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:28.400]  or the thrust of the drug war we have police officers becoming less and less
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:34.600]  attuned to their own neighborhoods and communities and quite frankly I think
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:39.680]  what we've seen is vastly increased militarization of American police forces
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:44.720]  which puts civil liberties at risk which puts community health and safety at
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:52.360]  risk as well is there any way to reverse this it seems like even establishment
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:55.200]  folks are starting to get concerned or will we just be like a third-world
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:58.760]  country now you know I hope there's a way to reverse that I believe I always
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:04.720]  believe that there's a way to reverse it this is a function I think of the people
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:08.960]  deciding what kind of policing they want because that's pretty much the kind of
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:14.040]  policing they're going to get and I and I really do believe that that with the
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:20.520]  aftermath of 9-11 the Department of Defense Homeland Security DEA throwing
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:26.360]  money and equipment at local law enforcement we find even tiny rural
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:34.280]  police departments with large SWAT contingencies and and our contingents I
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:38.880]  should say and and we're finding no reluctance on the part of Homeland
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:47.160]  Security to provide military-grade equipment to the finance department an
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:52.560]  AP reporter called me a couple weeks ago one of my reactions to a couple of
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:58.640]  examples one in Georgia the other in Texas and one was a three-person police
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:02.960]  department the other was a one-person police department meaning that one
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:08.880]  person was supposed to be caught the detective in the police chief and in
[02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:14.000]  the former case four million dollars in recent years granted to that Georgia
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.720]  department three million to the tiny Texas department there's something wrong
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:26.120]  with that picture well there certainly is I want to get into the whole situation
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:30.400]  with with decriminalization and why you support that chief sure but but first
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:36.000]  off obviously I've got to bring this up what happened at the WTO was that taken
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  away from you by the Delta Force and obviously there were provocateurs in the
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.120]  crowd a lot of police complained that they weren't allowed to go after them
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:46.360]  some of them got housed at that building after but then the peaceful
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:50.760]  protesters got attacked what happened there what was what was going on now in
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:55.080]  hindsight with that sir well along in the short of it is that we thought we were
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:17:00.400]  prepared and we weren't we thought we were ready we thought we were smarter
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:07.280]  than the anarchists and turns out at least terms of the tactics employed we
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:14.280]  simply were not up to it it's a small city comparatively speaking about 530,000
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:20.040]  at that time with a small police force in a small state a small county for that
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:26.480]  matter and the mayor disagreed with me but I don't think that that conference
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:30.600]  the World Trade Organization should have been held in Seattle at all but that's
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:36.600]  another issue that's a much larger political issue but I will tell you
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:43.000]  that looking back on it I made the biggest mistake of my career during that
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:49.520]  week and it now constitutes my legacy in the minds of many people we were
[02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:55.680]  accused on day one of underreacting on day two of overreacting and I think that
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:18:05.600]  that the point is that if you've got a very small police force you've got to
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:11.760]  make sure that these kinds of events anything that's got world international
[02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:18.920]  trade finance monetary in its title should be held in much larger areas with
[02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:23.160]  much larger police forces sure sure let me tell you a brief story and then I
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:26.440]  could play a clip and then move on to why you're really here today my reporter
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:30.680]  Rob do want a lawsuit I'm not gonna we can't get into details about it with
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:36.120]  Pittsburgh he wasn't part of the protest I sent a three-man team he's on a hill
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:39.960]  the conference is over there's college kids out of the park the police come
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:45.160]  multi-jurisdictions all over the country attack everybody under command of the
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:52.040]  security of the WTO or the G20 in that case they were running it he's up on a
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:55.440]  hill with mainstream media filming it they come they check mainstream media
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:19:00.080]  they go you're free to go they arrest him and then brutalize him and don't even
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:06.000]  care it's on tape and then he wins a lawsuit what type of where does that come
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:10.960]  from where they we have video of girls on bikes at the university not even part
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:15.840]  of anything being hit and knocked off their bike and then the cop hits her in
[02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:20.960]  the head assault with a deadly weapon for no reason what is going on when we
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:27.200]  see these images of what's happening to the culture I think I think what's
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:32.880]  happening is that the police and becoming increasingly militarized over the
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:41.320]  years have seen the people as their enemy have in fact in the name of public
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:46.440]  safety violated the civil liberties and constitutional rights of their fellow
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:51.000]  Americans in short they have abused the people they've been hired to protect and
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:55.880]  serve this is certainly not all cops it's not all police departments at all
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:20:03.480]  times but it's been a very disturbing trend and it needs to get reversed I want
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:07.360]  to play you a clip from Seattle and then get your final points on that and then
[02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:10.600]  shift gears in the drug war which obviously this all in my view the
[02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:13.880]  militarization began with we'll see if you agree with that in a moment but here
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:20.080]  is a clip from my film police state to the takeover from Seattle just to
[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:35.560]  remind people of what happened here it is not only could you not say what's on
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:42.760]  your mind you couldn't wear it let's not get into big scuffle over this man
[02:20:42.760 --> 02:21:04.840]  had an anti-wto sticker on his backpack he came to his body and I asked if I
[02:21:04.840 --> 02:21:08.640]  could go through he said I couldn't if I had a button and I wasn't going through
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:14.040]  the line and then he ripped it off my jacket now if I say I'm protesting WTO
[02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:18.640]  I can't go in if my t-shirt said I supported the WTO but I go in that's
[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:24.600]  not a protest there's no protest so hence no protest backpacks and bags were also
[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:40.320]  searched for banners or gas masks but you don't know what thoughts are in my
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:56.280]  head right okay I'm just telling you that is clearly uncomfortable for those
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:22:00.640]  who want to get through to protest and those who block their way we're trying
[02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:04.320]  to do is keep protesters out and the business people and citizens go in okay
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:09.840]  city leaders believe the free speech of yesterday came at too high a cost that's
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:15.080]  why at least for today the first amendment ended and now with Facebook
[02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:19.200]  they can look and see oh you believe this or that you can't go into the city
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:24.640]  center or all this giant area it's thought crime that's where this is all
[02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:29.080]  going norm I want to ask you was that the federal people that told you to do
[02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:35.280]  that and and what was your liaison in with Delta Force the answer to your
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:42.800]  question Alex is no the city of Seattle was responsible for this we had spent
[02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:48.680]  11 months in planning and preparation we of course had liaison with the Secret
[02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:55.440]  Service because Clinton was coming to town to address the WTO as was the
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:23:00.480]  Madeleine Albright Secretary of State and the and the country's chief trade
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:07.760]  negotiator and and so we we had a lot of federal dignitaries coming to town but
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:15.680]  I will tell you that this was was a city and state operation and and it was not
[02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:20.800]  our finest hour to say the least we only bring it up because what we see there
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:25.280]  now is the norm all over the place and I just read and I talked to some police
[02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:31.400]  officers off record they said Delta Force was basically in charge I mean were
[02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:36.560]  you told not to talk about Delta Force absolutely not I you know I can I can
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:41.280]  appreciate people speculating about what went wrong how it went wrong who was
[02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:46.160]  responsible for it but you are talking to the guy who is responsible for it
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:51.080]  sure but I mean so what was Delta Force doing and I and I have not until this
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:58.200]  moment heard about Delta Force in conjunction with the WTO you that means
[02:23:58.200 --> 02:24:02.080]  you can either paint me as naive or as somebody who's giving you honest answers
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:06.480]  to who was responsible for what went on that week sure sure I understand but the
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:08.760]  feds will tell you what they wanted and then you would try to work with them
[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:14.320]  well the feds basically said we want to make sure that from the moment wheels
[02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:20.520]  are down at SeaTac the president is safe and so we obviously did everything in
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:25.480]  our power to make sure that we didn't have any kind of compromise that the
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:29.320]  pressure sure sure well listen I really got shot about the drug
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:32.560]  decriminalization I just had to ask those questions we really appreciate you
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:37.640]  sir good question excellent questions and it's very painful to listen to what
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:41.760]  you just played for me it just it brings it all back I'm sorry to do that I
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:45.960]  just want something it's good it's good that you do it's good that you did it
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:51.040]  it's good that we all really talk about what's happening in this country and it
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:55.360]  is to me very disturbing so if you had it all over to do again you you don't
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:25:01.360]  think we should ban people for having buttons inside their bags you know that's
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:07.160]  about as unamerican as anything I can imagine we created and what the
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:13.320]  protesters and everyone else under the sun called a no protest zone we just
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:18.800]  called it a curfew area and you know it's a it is shades of Kurt Vonnegut
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:26.000]  it is the shades of George Orwell I mean the language that we were using we
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:33.880]  embraced we thought well we need a curfew we need a zone in which because
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:38.520]  of the violence that had erupted principally the the result of the
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:43.840]  anarchist but also some of our own action we needed to do this and on
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:48.360]  recollection we did not need to do it and sure you know I'll live with that
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:55.160]  mistake for the rest of my life well wow we really appreciate your work for
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:59.480]  trying to keep this a free country and especially hearing it from your well
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:02.880]  experienced educated perspective again we have the former police chief of
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:08.080]  Seattle joining us right now we're also gonna talk some about his book Norm
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:14.280]  let's get into though the drug war I mean more drugs than ever more police
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:17.920]  state than ever what do we do about the drug war well we end it we end it
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:24.800]  yesterday we never should have started it it was destined to fail and it has in
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:29.680]  fact over the past 40 years been a colossal failure it has been an
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:35.800]  obscenely expensive war 1.3 trillion dollars spent since Richard Nixon
[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:41.360]  famously declared drugs public enemy number one and declared all out war on
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:47.120]  them what do we have to show for it well in addition to this literally tens of
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:51.360]  millions of Americans who have been incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:57.320]  over the last 40 years drugs are more readily available today at lower prices
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:04.000]  and higher levels of potency than when Nixon declared this war every president
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:10.280]  since him has signed on to the war every one of them has you know statements of
[02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:14.800]  the present administration not withstanding every one of them has just
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:21.200]  as vigorously as the previous president prosecuted this war and it has
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:28.440]  been terribly damaged damaging to the entire country to our economy the
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:36.520]  quality of life to neighborhood safety it has fomented unprecedented levels of
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:41.960]  violence in Mexico and throughout the world and we're the force our general
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:48.960]  alec in this this war on drugs it is time for us to acknowledge the huge mistake
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:54.160]  we made and in that replaced prohibition which is a corrupt and bankrupt
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:59.240]  model can never work never has never will replace that prohibition with a
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:06.400]  regulatory model you know a wide variety of ways to approach regulation but
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:11.040]  something akin to what we did with alcohol seems to me to make the most
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:15.520]  sense absolutely I mean alcohol kills far more people than even the scourge of
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:22.280]  drug abuse and these people really are victims that have a disease why are we
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:27.520]  throwing them in jail or just casual users of marijuana Obama promised he was
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:30.640]  gonna you know leave everybody alone from when I've read he's done triple the
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:35.720]  rage on the dispensaries that Bush did but I guess he has left cover I think
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:41.680]  it's disgusting I think it's disgusting too you probably aware that my
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:46.840]  successor in Seattle was Gil Kerlikowski who is now the Obama
[02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:52.920]  administration drugs are and then that's two ex chiefs out of Seattle who
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:57.520]  could not be further apart on their views about the drug war you know it's
[02:28:57.520 --> 02:29:00.160]  funny I read about how they keep nonviolent people longer than violent
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:04.960]  I guess nonviolent do make good prisoners the private prisons make money I see
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:07.600]  where these private prisons they're getting laws passed to guarantee
[02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:11.360]  occupancy this is a really dangerous scenario I think it's
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:16.560]  unconscionable I think it's immoral and and arguably unconstitutional in the
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:21.440]  legal if you think about it every time a private corporation bells the prison
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:25.640]  bells the cell they need to tell that cell you know Norm I know you only had

[02:33:11.960 --> 02:33:27.080]  from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones the drug war has
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:32.560]  been a great success for the defense contractors it's been a great success of
[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:37.280]  the federal government expanding its power it's been a great success for
[02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:41.600]  bureaucracy but it has been an absolute nightmare for this country we consume
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:46.640]  more drugs than any other nation on earth you look at the statistics it is
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:51.200]  just dumbfounding and if you look at free market it's because we have drugs
[02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:56.720]  illegal I'm gonna go back to the former police chief of Seattle norm stamper but
[02:33:56.720 --> 02:33:59.680]  if you study I'm gonna get his take on this and finish his points he was trying
[02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:03.560]  to get to about the prisons if you look at how the British took over and then
[02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:09.680]  colonized China took on about a hundred years but China made opium illegal and
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:14.720]  so then that created a huge black market and the British first few decades took
[02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:17.760]  over the port towns bought off the police because there's incredible money
[02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:21.360]  bought off the local tabulars within less than a hundred years they had the
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:26.040]  whole country broke it in ten and then 12 parts and the different Western
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:32.040]  powers ran China for hundreds of years and ran it into the ground and it's
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:35.760]  in the end is the big reason it's the mess it is today in many respects I've
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:43.440]  studied the history fascinating history and Nixon and the rest of the black ops
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:47.240]  commanders who full well with the drug war was gonna do that's my piece in the
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:50.680]  seven eight minutes we've got left with norm stamper norm you've got the floor
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:55.440]  I'm gonna try to shut up here and let you get into why you as a former police
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:59.800]  chief that has witnessed this and the statistics the numbers the prisons
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:03.560]  what's really behind this drug war what do we do about it finish your point about
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:08.960]  the presence well yeah you know in a word fear is behind the drug war and I
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:14.240]  speak specifically of the fear of elected officials of our politicians to
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:19.920]  really confront this issue the way it deserves to be confronted the politicians
[02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:23.400]  don't want to be seen as weak on crime they don't want to be seen with as weak
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:28.280]  on drugs they certainly don't want to be seen as condoning drug use none of us
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:33.520]  in law enforcement against prohibition I want to get that plug in it is
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:37.840]  of the opinion that anyone should be taking any particular kind of drugs
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:43.880]  including alcohol and tobacco and the like but we all know that people are in
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:49.920]  fact going to use drugs of a wide variety of form so the question that we
[02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:54.600]  faced I think as a society is do we want these private prisons for example just
[02:35:54.600 --> 02:36:01.720]  to cite one segment of the population invested in continuing the drug war to
[02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:08.280]  build these prisons to fill these cells and to in the process make enormous
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:15.240]  profits housing nonviolent offenders who are far better off treated in those
[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:18.840]  cases in those instances where they've got an addiction problem for that
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:22.640]  addiction and allowed to stay in their homes and their neighborhoods in their
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:27.680]  communities now we talk about the breakup of the nuclear family we've done
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:32.720]  this for decades in the African-American community well for God's sakes it's a
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:37.840]  drug war that has produced the lion's share of that particular problem so we
[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:42.200]  have a public policy that doesn't work and we have people who have a
[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:47.720]  responsibility for dealing with that who are just altogether too timid to do the
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:53.800]  right thing getting back to Obama's role I mean he didn't keep any of his
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:58.240]  promises but that was one thing five six years ago I thought well at least
[02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:03.080]  there's no way he's gonna lie about decriminalizing marijuana he must be
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:07.800]  telling the truth that's a good thing and he's been as the New York Times
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:13.720]  reported triple the drug raids in the 15 states that have decriminalized and
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:17.520]  more raids I mean here's articles right here DEA rates multiple marijuana
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:20.960]  dispensaries in Washington state where you're from where you were police chief
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:29.600]  I mean is there any end of this and how does Obama get away with this well I you
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:38.400]  know I I come back to this notion that politicians can tie themselves up and
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:45.000]  not can become paralyzed by unfounded fears their constituents are way out
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:50.880]  ahead of them the polling shows that the vast majority of the American people
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:56.240]  can have concluded that the drug war has been a failure the majority of the
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:01.240]  American people believe that marijuana should be legalized today two states
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:08.280]  Washington and Colorado have in fact legalized adult use of small quantities
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:13.280]  of marijuana so here come the fish to a kid you can't drive under its influence
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:17.160]  can't rob a bank and try to excuse yourself because you're under its
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:21.960]  influence you still got to behave responsibly but making a choice about
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:28.320]  what you elect to put into your own body that harms no one else really should
[02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:33.760]  be reserved for the individual and not the government what about the states
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:37.360]  rights issue with Washington and Colorado being raided by the feds on a
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:41.880]  weekly basis when the states have decriminalized the marijuana you know
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:47.120]  we've gone beyond decriminalization we have legalized Colorado Washington
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:52.440]  that's right yeah we have legalized but the federal government trumps state law
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:39:00.000]  on marijuana years ago Congress classified it as a schedule one drug
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.520]  which is an absurdity but in so doing they basically gave the federal
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:11.160]  government jurisdiction over marijuana enforcement now so far we have not seen
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:16.800]  the federal government move into either of these states to you know to do what
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:21.880]  they theoretically legally could do and that is upend our laws all together I
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:27.000]  think if they did that they'd be making a huge political and strategic mistake
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:33.480]  but in the end I think we need to send a message to Congress that marijuana it
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:40.000]  needs to be rescheduled and the states at proposal of your comments the states
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  need to be given the freedom to make their own laws along these lines sure
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.920]  why do we even have states if they can't do things like decriminalize or
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:52.400]  legalize marijuana and I understand they call it legalization but there's still
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:57.280]  regulations there's still laws there's taxes there's control I just call that
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:40:01.440]  decriminalization you can call it legalization but well and in fact Alex
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:06.200]  I did this the distinction is important because you see if you don't legalize it
[02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:11.440]  if you merely decriminalize it it makes it an infraction you're not going to go
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:16.200]  to jail behind a marijuana charge a simple possession charge but you are
[02:40:16.200 --> 02:40:23.240]  still considered a violin so the product itself continues to be illicit and as
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:27.880]  long as it's illicit obscene profits will be made as a result of that
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:32.880]  classification exactly I mean look at what the drug wars done to Mexico it's a
[02:40:32.880 --> 02:40:36.840]  completely failed state can you give us your expert opinion on that I certainly
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:42.880]  can I grew up in San Diego a border town I spent a lot of my earlier years in
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:48.240]  Mexico and it's just heartbreaking what has happened in that country the levels
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:56.800]  of violence upwards of 70,000 homicides since 2006 wow all attributable to US
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:04.520]  demand a big portion of that of those deaths and of the profits of the cartels
[02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:09.160]  is traceable to marijuana trafficking yeah when I was a child we went to
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:13.200]  Mexico like three times a year and just a jewel and we'd go into the mountains
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:19.000]  in the north we'd go down to Chichinita in the south Yucatan all over we didn't
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.400]  go to Mexico City it was bad then but now I've been you can't go anywhere in
[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:27.640]  Mexico now even the controlled areas where it hasn't collapsed to a certain
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:35.640]  extent very sad it's it's it's it's tragic and we are the proximate cause I
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:38.280]  want to get a little bit into your book and any other points you think are
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:40.400]  important to make and I hope we can have you back again because I think this is
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:43.680]  just an amazing interview I hope that everybody will get involved and go to
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:48.680]  cops say legalizedrugs.com but I wanted to raise this point to you I'm seeing
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:53.800]  the sanity movement really gain ground with libertarians conservatives you
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:58.760]  know of course liberals but really grow where even 10 years ago most of police I
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:03.000]  talked to in Texas were like you can't legalize that now all the cops I talked
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:08.800]  to know that this is a total failure know it's destroying the society know
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:14.120]  it's been an excuse to militarize police and I mean I know very few pull a
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:17.840]  police that aren't corrupt and aren't making money off of it and who aren't
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:22.480]  part of the narcotics teams who who aren't for decriminalization or
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:26.960]  legalization and as you said the polls show that so here's my question what's
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:31.080]  gonna happen if they keep fighting this for another decade where every cop on
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:35.360]  the force at one time or another has smoked marijuana or everybody knows
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:39.360]  it's nothing compared to alcohol and I'm not a pot guy I mean I like alcohol more
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:44.000]  I think it's actually pretty destructive I mean what's gonna happen in this in
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:48.360]  this hypocrisy where we all know that it's just a way to have the government
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:52.240]  run our lives and for corrupt drug dealers to make money I mean how long
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:58.360]  can this fraud go on police chief well you know we could I guess getting into
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:03.840]  another vice we could take bets on how long it's gonna go on yeah my theory is
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:10.520]  hypocrisy crashes of its own weight eventually the way to speed up that
[02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:17.120]  eventuality is for people to become organized mobilized agitated educated
[02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:23.440]  and to make their views known one of the most encouraging trends that I'm maybe
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:28.440]  I'm it's wishful thinking but I am detecting is liberals conservatives
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:36.640]  libertarians coming together to appreciate that there is nothing socially
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:42.560]  worthy of a continuation of our drug war that it's done all together too much
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:48.600]  damage and it's time for us to unite to end that war absolutely have you had to
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:54.000]  take bets on it I think it's gonna be I think in the next five to seven years I
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:58.400]  think it'll totally collapse but then what are the big banks going to do that
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:02.720]  are busy laundering the proceeds across the board well you've got you've got
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:06.920]  money laundering you've got the private prisons you've got the drug enforcement
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:12.560]  industry these are all influences and forces in our society and the structure
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:17.640]  of our economy who are tied to these profits they're gonna have to use their
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:24.360]  imagination we're gonna have to buck up and recognize the the value that will
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:29.280]  come from from ending the drug war and I personally believe that is gonna
[02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:36.880]  happen whether they're forced to come to that conclusion or they simply muster
[02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:40.800]  the spine and the honesty to say I've known for a long time that this is
[02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:44.920]  foolish absolutely a few minutes them I'll let you go as I'm your busy man
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:48.720]  former Seattle police chief Norm Stamper one of the most famous police
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:52.040]  chief really in America you can't really know the names of any others we you
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:57.160]  know Daryl Gates you know Norm Stamper you don't know really many others and we
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:02.400]  have the awesome police chief on routinely Artie Savetta but expanding on
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:07.160]  this norm your book I was mailed two or three four years ago whenever it came
[02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:10.720]  out I was mailed a magazine that had an excerpt of it and thought wow and read
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:13.920]  part of it on air I meant to get the book and read I don't normally put
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:17.720]  plugs out for books I haven't read but it seems like had a lot of really good
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:21.920]  knowledge I know it sent shockwaves through law enforcement and a lot of
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:27.560]  police chiefs responded for or con but breaking rank a top cops expose the
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:32.000]  dark side of American policing spend a few minutes plug in your book and
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:39.520]  crystallizing crystallizing what the dark side is well the dark side for me is
[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:44.680]  all those isms that we hear about that can be reduced to do arrogance or to
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:51.080]  bigotry and the tendency to continue doing things that we know are failed
[02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:58.640]  policies and that that runs a pretty good gamut our approach for example to
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:03.120]  domestic violence I personally believe that violence in the home is a precursor
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:08.560]  to pretty much all other forms of violence the drug war I've mentioned
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:14.760]  we've talked about it some link I think we also need to take a look at the
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:21.480]  increased militarization irrespective of the drug war that finds its way into the
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:25.080]  policies and the procedures and the practices the police response for example
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:32.000]  to the Occupy movement produced a number of very disturbing images and I'm
[02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:38.280]  thinking you have to police these events you certainly have to ensure for the
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:45.120]  public safety of everyone but when we when we overreact to these situations we
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:51.400]  essentially render ourselves I think un-American I also believe very strongly
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:59.840]  that we we need to look at other so-called victimless crimes at consensual
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:10.840]  behavior between adults that harms no one and and that winds up being subject
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:17.960]  to American criminal justice laws and and the criminal justice system so it's
[02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:22.080]  it's it's a it's a book with 30 different chapters and 30 different
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:26.280]  topics each each one at least marginally different from the previous
[02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:29.760]  time the following well I want to read it and of course you have your own site
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:35.360]  you haven't plugged it's norm stamper calm I do I do all right well we really
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:39.920]  appreciate your time today and and I totally agree with you on the whole drug
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:43.440]  war I mean it's not even agreeing it's just a mid-minute fact even the Mexican
[02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:45.960]  government saying they're gonna have to decriminalize even though they love
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:48.680]  laundering the money they love being paid off they're not gonna have a
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:52.880]  civilization if they don't stop this and I really see us going the direction of
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:56.160]  Mexico we don't turn it around any and I appreciate your courage to say that
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:47:59.960]  the Seattle thing was wrong and in hindsight you don't hear that from a
[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:04.000]  lot of folks but that's that's the mark of a real real humanitarian any other
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.680]  tidbits of police chief you'd like to form a police chief of the Seattle you'd
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:14.280]  like to add for folks yeah community policing I think it there was a chance
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:18.880]  back in the 90s that we would actually see some small number of police
[02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:23.440]  departments embrace what I consider to be authentic community policing and that
[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:28.640]  is the community policing itself with help a lot of help from the police
[02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:36.680]  naturally but other organizations as well we used to say popularly you the
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:41.040]  community you need to be our eyes and ears well I think it's time for us to
[02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:47.560]  turn that on its head and say with one voice there is as many voices as we can
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:54.000]  pull together to our local law enforcement you are our eyes and ears
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:59.560]  it was was on another program yesterday with a woman who had a man who was
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:04.000]  stalking her and perhaps even some of her neighbors she went around to every
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:07.560]  single one of the neighbors and with a photograph of this guy said you know him
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:12.760]  does he cause you discomfort so on and so forth and they did talk to their
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:17.320]  police their local police this happened to be an LA and they got advice they got
[02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:21.800]  counsel from the police about what to do and what not to do you know ways to
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:28.760]  avoid a George Zimmer Zimmerman Trayvon Martin incident by by the by the
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:33.640]  community becoming organized and mobilized and making decisions about
[02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:37.840]  how they want to achieve public safety in their own neighborhoods well exactly
[02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:41.600]  because we have the police militarized it turns it in occupying army they then
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:45.280]  have an attitude that they don't like you you don't like them that creates the
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:49.640]  division the authoritarian forces want in this country and then I see fake
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:54.840]  community policing that just becomes secret police stuff versus police really
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:58.600]  assigned to an area where there's humanity and you know them and so
[02:49:58.600 --> 02:50:02.840]  everybody treats each other like humans that's exactly it that's that's my
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:06.560]  dream for policing well that that sounds like almost like the old-fashioned
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:10.880]  thing I mean yeah it's you know sometimes I myself included we get
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:16.120]  romantic about the old B cop days but there was so much to recommend it you
[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:22.240]  knew the B cop the B cop knew you would know if there was anything suspicious in
[02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:27.080]  the neighborhood you know I think the community needs to take a much more
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:33.240]  active role in its own health and safety and well-being wow but the police are a
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:37.800]  part of that partnership and it means you know an authentic partnership is 50
[02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:42.840]  right absolutely Norm Stamper senior partner it's the community Norm

[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:28.440]  creates this big excuse to get in our lives and the government and criminal
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:32.080]  interests bring the drugs in I mean that's on record too I mean it's just all

[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:36.600]  sir go ahead also I hope you get on the JRE soon I also want to know do you think
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:40.480]  Joe Rogan is not letting everyone know that he knows more than he knows because
[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:43.920]  I think he holds back I think he he knows a lot more and he's just playing it
[02:56:43.920 --> 02:56:47.240]  right so he can get on TV and get paid well are you talking about the Joe Rogan
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:53.640]  podcast yeah Joe has like given up cuz every time I'm in LA I'm there for like
[02:56:53.640 --> 02:56:56.600]  a day and a half and I've got something else I've got to do and his podcast is
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:57:00.200]  huge and he kind of gets irritated when I ask him to come on and he goes why
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:04.120]  much been on my podcast and he's been I go why don't you do Skype I think he's
[02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:08.280]  starting to do that but I want to go out and see Joe I I mean I want to go out
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:14.160]  and be on the show and I don't think Joe is holding back on anything Joe used to
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:17.920]  be a lot more high strung he's a lot more laid back now and he tries to see
[02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:25.800]  all sides of things he's more like a Zen master now I'm known as like 1998 and
[02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:32.200]  I mean he does know a lot he's the guy's super smart obviously and I don't
[02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:39.880]  know what else he can say about him he's a good friend of mine what can I say do
[02:57:39.880 --> 02:57:43.640]  you have any comments on that I mean I don't think Joe's I don't think Joe's
[02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:48.400]  holding back I don't think he would be I don't think he would be penalized I
[02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:54.160]  mean Dana White let's him say and do whatever he wants I don't know I just I
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:59.240]  just think Joe's laid back he's you know he takes that view that what's gonna
[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:03.480]  happen to humanity is going to happen what else can I say what do you have to
[02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:08.000]  say to that well he also has a new show coming on called Joe Rogan questions
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:11.480]  everything I think it's on a sci-fi network he just went through the that big
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:16.720]  conference with Ray Kurzweil he likes Ray Kurzweil well yeah he's into life
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:21.720]  extension to the technology and and all that stuff and I mean if Ray Kurzweil
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:24.600]  invites me to something I'll go to it and I'll tell him I disagree with him but
[02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:28.840]  yeah no I know I was offered a show on sci-fi network or they wanted to look at
[02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:32.120]  doing it here every day all this stuff I said time to mess with it so I'm glad
[02:58:32.120 --> 02:58:36.360]  Joe's doing that as well Joe's a very talented funny guy but a little bit

[03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:27.960]  quick I just wanted to you know well I know you hate to hear it but thank you
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:32.120]  for what you do first off and second off you know I just want to get the word
[03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:36.600]  out you know I'm a first-time caller I've listened to you about three years
[03:01:36.600 --> 03:01:40.880]  everybody that's listening right now can make a difference I mean you got to take
[03:01:40.880 --> 03:01:45.720]  advantage of what's out there step up and do it you know small groups can make
[03:01:45.720 --> 03:01:48.880]  a difference you can you know it's like the old
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:54.360]  environmentalists used to say you know the think globally act locally and that
[03:01:54.360 --> 03:02:01.640]  applies and I'll ask that's right exactly resist globally and resist locally
[03:02:01.640 --> 03:02:06.960]  because resisting locally is defeating the globalist globally and we've done a
[03:02:06.960 --> 03:02:10.240]  good job of it now obama you may have heard that you know we've strengthened
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:15.840]  gun laws that's right expanded gun laws when you pass laws against carbon taxes
[03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:20.200]  you've passed laws against agenda 21 and it's absolutely freaking the
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:24.200]  kleptocrats out and you got to take advantage of it now we you know you can
[03:02:24.200 --> 03:02:27.360]  start it I've started a Facebook book on the page I know I said it was Second
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:31.120]  Amendment I don't care to plug it because I'm doing fine but my message is
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:36.640]  everybody can do it it takes there's power in numbers and that that's the
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:43.600]  key of what I wanted to say today you know that's pretty much pretty much it
[03:02:43.600 --> 03:02:49.880]  for me God bless you sir keep it up yeah the Hollywood in imprints this image
[03:02:49.880 --> 03:02:54.840]  from birth that one strong man defeats the entire enemy there's targets of
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:59.480]  opportunity to wake people up everywhere defeating the globalists isn't just
[03:02:59.480 --> 03:03:03.320]  about fighting them it's about empowering good people and most people
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:08.040]  that are fighting for the new world order don't even know it let's go ahead
[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:12.840]  and talk to Corey and mass thanks for holding you're on the air how you doing
[03:03:12.840 --> 03:03:18.160]  Alex good brother thanks for holding hey well I'm a local truck driver based
[03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:21.560]  out of Pennsylvania I'm actually up here in Massachusetts today but the reason I
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:26.760]  call up is I have a local customer that I delivered to in Long Island outside of
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:33.040]  the US National Cemetery on the northwest side of the cemetery there are
[03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:37.680]  a bunch of those plastic coffins you did a story about a couple years ago you
[03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:42.440]  familiar with what I'm talking about yes they had caught my attention I've
[03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:47.760]  never seen them in person and I use I would be what you used to or what you
[03:03:47.760 --> 03:03:51.640]  would consider a skeptic of things which is good by nature we want to
[03:03:51.640 --> 03:03:56.000]  investigate things and believe things with our own eyes well after I saw that I
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:00.280]  put two and two together and now I'm starting to really see the big picture
[03:04:00.280 --> 03:04:05.680]  what is the name of the cemetery we'll go to Google Earth it's Long Island
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:14.080]  National Cemetery it is off Pine Lawn Road in Long Island there good landmark
[03:04:14.080 --> 03:04:19.280]  to use is the 495 the Long Island some of those are real coffin liners they
[03:04:19.280 --> 03:04:24.640]  admit they can also be used during emergencies but there are real mass
[03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:29.840]  casualty plans with the different state cemetery boards all over the country for
[03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:34.520]  millions of dead we've confirmed that with the documents and and and those
[03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:39.280]  those coffins are part of that but they're also dual use for just regular
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:45.000]  burial liners so then they can straw man and say we're making it up but did you
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:50.840]  get any did you get any photos of that yeah actually I did take a picture can
[03:04:50.840 --> 03:04:55.840]  you send it to show tips at info wars.com show tips at info wars.com yeah
[03:04:55.840 --> 03:05:01.640]  do that right now anything else sir that was it
