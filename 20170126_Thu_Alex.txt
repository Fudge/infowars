[00:00.000 --> 00:29.920]  From the InfoWars.com News Center, D.P.
[00:29.920 --> 00:34.920]  Behind Enemy Lines in Occupied Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide.
[00:34.920 --> 00:42.920]  You're listening to the voice of human resistance against the Technotronic Technocracy Cancoper.
[00:42.920 --> 00:45.920]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:45.920 --> 01:02.920]  You want it baby, you're about to get it.
[01:02.920 --> 01:20.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is January 26, 2017.
[01:20.920 --> 01:21.920]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:21.920 --> 01:23.920]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[01:23.920 --> 01:27.920]  We have another incredibly important transmission lined up.
[01:27.920 --> 01:38.920]  Trump is now synonymous with telling the truth, keeping his promises, and delivering in Blitzkrieg fashion a lightning war against the tyrants.
[01:38.920 --> 01:44.920]  But that's about the only, I guess, German or Nazi connotation you could make that would have any reality based in it.
[01:44.920 --> 01:51.920]  But MSM is saying the stock market, I've been using a number from about a week ago.
[01:51.920 --> 01:56.920]  Excuse me, I have to correct myself because that number is about a week old.
[01:56.920 --> 02:02.920]  Bloomberg is reporting that the stock market has gained $2 trillion.
[02:02.920 --> 02:06.920]  I've been saying $1 trillion, $1.2, $1.3.
[02:06.920 --> 02:08.920]  It hadn't looked the numbers up in a week.
[02:08.920 --> 02:10.920]  It was like $1.7 last week.
[02:10.920 --> 02:15.920]  It's $2 trillion.
[02:15.920 --> 02:22.920]  And MSM, you name it, are running around saying this is like Hitler.
[02:22.920 --> 02:35.920]  Meanwhile, the Mexican president is saying that he may not come next week to a visit with President Trump now because he said in Spanish, we're going to play it in a moment, we do not have walls in Mexico.
[02:35.920 --> 02:38.920]  Well, believe me, you deserve to have one with Guatemala.
[02:38.920 --> 02:41.920]  Guatemala basically is what Mexico has become.
[02:41.920 --> 02:44.920]  It collapsed third world country.
[02:44.920 --> 02:49.920]  And it's a good thing you have a wall down there or it would be total bedlam.
[02:49.920 --> 02:52.920]  But now he says he won't attend.
[02:52.920 --> 02:54.920]  Oh, so it was a rumor this morning.
[02:54.920 --> 03:05.920]  Now it's official just came out that he will not attend now because Trump would dare build a wall even though all these other countries have walls breaking the wall.
[03:05.920 --> 03:08.920]  Mexico pulls out of the Trump meet.
[03:08.920 --> 03:10.920]  So that's breaking right now on Drudge.
[03:10.920 --> 03:13.920]  Let's go ahead and play the president though, saying that there are no walls.
[03:13.920 --> 03:14.920]  Here it is.
[03:14.920 --> 03:18.920]  That is where we should be.
[03:18.920 --> 03:31.920]  I regret and disapprove of the decision by the United States to continue with the construction of the wall, which has for years far from uniting us divided us.
[03:31.920 --> 03:35.920]  Mexico does not believe in walls.
[03:35.920 --> 03:37.920]  I've said time and time again.
[03:37.920 --> 03:40.920]  Well, not pay for a wall.
[03:40.920 --> 03:51.920]  All it means is pennies, charged for people, wiring money would pay for it, pennies.
[03:51.920 --> 04:03.920]  Eight to fourteen billion dollars is nothing but a drop in the bucket when you talk about money transfers to Mexico and back and forth.
[04:03.920 --> 04:05.920]  Okay, that's good.
[04:05.920 --> 04:10.920]  So he goes on to say, you know, a negotiation is good for us to have, but now he's pulled out of the negotiation.
[04:10.920 --> 04:14.920]  So now Trump is going to run over Mexico.
[04:14.920 --> 04:15.920]  We deserve to have a wall.
[04:15.920 --> 04:22.920]  Mexico has collapsed into tyranny under previous globalist policies and we can have a wall.
[04:22.920 --> 04:34.920]  Quite frankly, it's not going to completely stop anybody, but it's an act of sovereignty and will slow down just complete criminal lawlessness where the Mexican drug trucks just drive right over and right back over the border.
[04:34.920 --> 04:45.920]  And large parts of Arizona are basically off limits unless you're a drug cartel and you've got the coyotes in there murdering and killing the people coming across the border.
[04:45.920 --> 04:47.920]  Oh, it's the coyotes doing the murdering.
[04:47.920 --> 04:52.920]  Not a bunch of guys, you know, white guys and cowboy hats like Robert Rodriguez would have you believe.
[04:52.920 --> 04:53.920]  Stay with us, folks.
[04:53.920 --> 04:59.920]  I'm going to launch into MSM pushing big time openly for the murder of President Trump.
[04:59.920 --> 05:04.920]  Sanctuary cities across the nation are pushing back against President Trump's immigration policies.
[05:04.920 --> 05:06.920]  They're vowing to take it all the way to the courts.
[05:06.920 --> 05:17.920]  Bill de Blasio of New York is promising immediate action against Sanctuary City's order as President Trump's executive order is said to block federal funding to Sanctuary City's just like New York.
[05:17.920 --> 05:27.920]  De Blasio is saying that it's very susceptible to legal challenge and he's promising to take it to the court immediately for an injunction to stop the order if an attempt to pull funds from the city is made.
[05:27.920 --> 05:33.920]  He goes on to say, if they make an attempt to pull that money, it would be from the NYPD, from security funding to fighting terrorism.
[05:33.920 --> 05:35.920]  Of course, we know that simply isn't true.
[05:35.920 --> 05:43.920]  The president is trying to enforce the law of the land and say that these rogue cities have no right to give benefits to people that are here illegally.
[05:43.920 --> 05:53.920]  On Wednesday, Trump signed an order to stop federal funds from going to these cities from New York to San Francisco that have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agencies.
[05:53.920 --> 05:58.920]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for infowars.com.
[06:23.920 --> 06:30.920]  You should have when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing for years, people that currently are testing for us, they didn't just say outstanding, what they really say about them.
[06:30.920 --> 06:37.920]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it. A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[06:37.920 --> 06:41.920]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[06:41.920 --> 06:46.920]  I mean, it's unbelievable. It's a quarter inch thick. It's got a 20 year warranty, it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable.
[06:46.920 --> 06:48.920]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it.
[06:48.920 --> 06:54.920]  Again, fund the info war, get the game changing, nanotech tubes, it's a win-win, $200.
[06:54.920 --> 07:19.920]  Go check out all their different products at infowars.com. It's amazing.

[07:39.920 --> 07:48.920]  That key area is taken care of, it's insurance you can eat. You are getting an amazing deal on it and you are funding the very tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[07:48.920 --> 07:56.920]  Bottom line, it's time to get prepared. So for a limited time, 40 to 30% off all the info wars selects storeable food at infowarsstore.com.
[07:56.920 --> 08:19.920]  Go check out all their different products at infowarsstore.com.
[08:19.920 --> 08:43.920]  The globalist only fired once. They may have wounded.
[08:43.920 --> 09:07.920]  I'm going to love the high woman.
[09:07.920 --> 09:17.920]  Wow. Trump is delivering on so much of what he claimed he was going to do that it's dizzying right now.
[09:17.920 --> 09:40.920]  And his approval rating even in the skewed Gallup poll which they admit mainly targets the elderly and mainline TV watchers which skews heavily towards the Democrats shows he's already at 59% up from 57 last Friday up from 49 just a month ago.
[09:40.920 --> 09:53.920]  So you look at how they're skewing. He's been as low as 41%. You look at how they're skewing it. This means his approval ratings more like 70%. Amazing.
[09:53.920 --> 10:14.920]  Most of the quote minorities I speak to, whether they be upper class, working class, poor, go, no, I really like Trump. I think it's all lies that they said about him. But man, you know, I've got friends and family get mad at me about saying anything.
[10:14.920 --> 10:28.920]  But I'm going to tell you something folks. Ron Paul talked about it yesterday and he's been dead on. The IMF, the World Bank, all of them are cutting stimulus next month. They're ending the QE globally.
[10:28.920 --> 10:40.920]  Now remember that was only done for them. Trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions of liquid liquidity with 0% interest was given to them. Sometimes pure bailouts just pure cash.
[10:40.920 --> 10:49.920]  But it's the same thing when you're a big mega bank and you give yourself and your subsidiaries backed up by taxpayers 0% money.
[10:49.920 --> 11:05.920]  Then they go out and loan us to the public for five, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 points. Some of these rates are loan sharking. They take 0% interest and go out and give you payday loans at 25%. This is madness.
[11:05.920 --> 11:16.920]  25% a month in some cases. I mean, they've changed laws all over the country and all over Europe to allow loan sharking, ladies and gentlemen, feeding on poor people.
[11:16.920 --> 11:29.920]  Trump is moving to announce initiatives to try to stop that. Trump is ending incentives and bailouts for the real estate market.
[11:29.920 --> 11:39.920]  And the Von Mies Institute is really praising him. Ron Paul praised him yesterday and said, no, he's doing just the right thing for the economy. Just the right thing.
[11:39.920 --> 11:44.920]  And Paul's eyes lit up like I've never seen him light up before.
[11:44.920 --> 11:54.920]  Except the time Sasha Cohen, Baron, whatever his name is, tried to have sex with him in a hotel room. He said, I'm going to beat the hell out of you. Get the hell out of my way.
[11:54.920 --> 12:03.920]  He lit up then, boy, I got ready to kick some butt. But they started talking about Trump really doing just the right thing to try to supercharge the economy and save it.
[12:03.920 --> 12:16.920]  Paul's eyes lit up because he realizes what a desperate situation this is. You see, the globalists gave themselves all the money for now, what, nine years at 0% interest.
[12:16.920 --> 12:26.920]  Now, they are cutting it because they don't want the public to actually get any of it because Trump is normally not for 0% interest rates.
[12:26.920 --> 12:38.920]  But he wants to keep them like that or close that for a while to actually get the money out of the public and have the big banks basically under order, loaned to the people to try to jumpstart things before we go over the edge of a cliff.
[12:38.920 --> 12:51.920]  The problem is he doesn't control the IMF particularly. And they are cutting their forecast. They are trying to dial things back. They're trying to do everything they can to put breaks on this economy.
[12:51.920 --> 13:07.920]  And coming up today, let me see what time he's coming on, Harry Dent's on the third hour. We're going to see if he thinks the Trump effect can pull us out of this global spiral that the globalists have had scheduled for a long time for this year.
[13:07.920 --> 13:16.920]  So we're far from out of the woods right now. And as Ron Paul said, if the economy goes down, it is not Trump's fault. Obviously, he just got in.
[13:16.920 --> 13:28.920]  He's doing everything he can like an airplane pilot where the pilot has a heart attack and there's no co-pilot and the stewardess comes back and says, can someone fly the plane?
[13:28.920 --> 13:35.920]  And Trump gets up and says, yes, I can fly the plane. The question is by then, it's nose diving. Can he pull it up?
[13:35.920 --> 13:47.920]  Well, Soros, who has been publicly betting against the United States for decades and who has been naked shorting stock market, has everything he's got bet on this.
[13:47.920 --> 13:58.920]  And guess what? It got magically leaked out of the Dutch regulators' computer system. Dutch regulator, this is Bloomberg, accidentally posts Soros' short positions.
[13:58.920 --> 14:06.920]  Yeah, no, the major patriot intelligence agencies are moving against Soros and there's marches against him happening all over the world.
[14:06.920 --> 14:13.920]  Millions have been marching in different Eastern European countries against what they call the Soros Evil.
[14:13.920 --> 14:25.920]  And now his positions have been released and it turns out he was betting against America, betting against the West, and it's been blowing up in his ugly, evil face.
[14:25.920 --> 14:33.920]  It's been blowing up in this goblin's face and it's beautiful. That's all coming up.
[14:33.920 --> 14:50.920]  Now, I want to praise Trump because I know he's for real and I know that he's been an incredible straight shooter and it's very refreshing to see a statesman instead of a politician, someone who does what they say they'll do.
[14:50.920 --> 15:00.920]  Trump has kept his promise on everything he said he would do so far and is trying to launch this agenda immediately and has added two trillion dollars now.
[15:00.920 --> 15:13.920]  Oh, it's up to two trillion according to Bloomberg. Since he was president-elect, now he's been president for less than six days and it's dizzying.
[15:13.920 --> 15:23.920]  They've got CNN and all the rest of Washington Post coming out saying, oh, it's Hitler. Any stock market surge is Hitler. Everything's Hitler.
[15:23.920 --> 15:34.920]  But they're a global authoritarian program. But there's one thing Trump has not kept his promise on and I say that tentatively because we're going to see.
[15:34.920 --> 15:47.920]  But so far, he has reversed himself at least verbally when it comes for calls for Hillary to be locked up or the fact that Hillary should be in jail.
[15:47.920 --> 15:54.920]  Now, bottom line, I believe Trump is going to do the right thing and not try to block sessions or others doing their job.
[15:54.920 --> 16:10.920]  But here's the big news. Clearly, if it looks like candidate Trump was calling for her to be locked up, which is a common sense prima facie fact on his face, then they'll use that to say, oh, he's just doing this to be political.
[16:10.920 --> 16:18.920]  That's why he needs to say now, hey, we need to try to mend fences, come together and move forward.
[16:18.920 --> 16:26.920]  Is because yes, justice must be done. I believe he won't stand the way of justice, but he needs to recuse himself publicly from the process.
[16:26.920 --> 16:31.920]  But if he doesn't, then he would have broken a major promise.
[16:31.920 --> 16:39.920]  And plus he shouldn't be involved blocking justice. We need to see her foundation, her cronies and Hillary investigated and clearly prosecuted.
[16:39.920 --> 16:51.920]  And coming up, we have Senator Sessions and his confirmation hearings saying when she is basically prosecuted, I will recuse myself. He didn't say if she is. That's a big tell right there.
[16:51.920 --> 16:59.920]  But the crimes are so ultra massive, they thought that they could just commit them.
[16:59.920 --> 17:08.920]  And that because they were so big, they'd be too big to prosecute, like too big to fail. Like they said, if you're going to steal, steal big.
[17:08.920 --> 17:20.920]  But I'll say this, this is a reversal and this is Trump on the surface breaking a promise because he said you ought to be in jail. I'll call for a prosecutor.
[17:20.920 --> 17:30.920]  Let's go ahead and play this compilation of him back during the debates with the mic drop moments of saying, yeah, you bet I shouldn't be in office because if I am in office, you'll be in jail. Here it is.
[17:30.920 --> 17:40.920]  You know, it is. It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country because you'd be in jail.
[17:40.920 --> 17:44.920]  Secretary Clinton.
[17:44.920 --> 18:03.920]  When you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 emails that you deleted and that you acid washed and then the two boxes of emails and other things last week that were taken from an
[18:03.920 --> 18:21.920]  office and are now missing. And I'll tell you what, I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation
[18:21.920 --> 18:35.920]  because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it. And we're going to have a special prosecutor. When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.
[18:35.920 --> 18:45.920]  In my opinion, the people that have been long term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this where emails and you get a subpoena.
[18:45.920 --> 18:56.920]  You get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails and then you acid wash or bleach them, as you would say, a very expensive process.
[18:56.920 --> 19:06.920]  So we're going to get a special prosecutor and we're going to look into it because you know what, people have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.
[19:06.920 --> 19:07.920]  That's right.
[19:07.920 --> 19:10.920]  It's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[19:10.920 --> 19:16.920]  The president, you bring up Hillary Clinton, you had her stand up at Tatuary Hall and said some very kind things about her.
[19:16.920 --> 19:18.920]  She fought hard. She fought hard.
[19:18.920 --> 19:19.920]  This is the last night.
[19:19.920 --> 19:20.920]  I think it's done.
[19:20.920 --> 19:22.920]  Any investigations into Hillary Clinton?
[19:22.920 --> 19:29.920]  I just don't know. I mean, I hope so. And from my standpoint, we want to move on to the future. So I hope so.
[19:29.920 --> 19:35.920]  I don't know what the status of that is. I know it's a lot of very serious stuff, but I certainly hope so.
[19:35.920 --> 19:43.920]  So he doesn't completely break with his promise. He says, oh, yes, he fought hard. I sure hope so. I don't know the status of those things.
[19:43.920 --> 19:49.920]  I'm not involved in those things. I think he's going to deliver on this as well. It's the nature of Trump.
[19:49.920 --> 20:02.920]  He's also somebody that if you attack him, lie about him and come after his family, like the press, she still commands and Soros still commands and attack his wife and attack his son and others.
[20:02.920 --> 20:04.920]  He's coming after you.
[20:04.920 --> 20:13.920]  And by he's coming after you, he's recused himself and Sessions says he's going to recuse himself as well when there is a prosecution.
[20:13.920 --> 20:22.920]  Because Hillary has been caught in lies to Congress, massive fraud, the stand down in Benghazi, the list goes on and on, getting money from Assadi Arabians.
[20:22.920 --> 20:32.920]  And I want to see it brought out. I want to see them broken because they're not stopping and they've created a giant army of mentally ill cultists
[20:32.920 --> 20:46.920]  who want race war in this country. They're a bunch of mentally ill, twisted, near do well white people trying to bully and whip mainly black folks and Hispanics into hating white people.
[20:46.920 --> 20:55.920]  I mean, everyone up their campaign to be DNC chair are making the most racist statements about how we don't need white people at the top of the Democratic Party.
[20:55.920 --> 21:03.920]  Or, well, I'm white elect me because I'll keep the whites in line and make sure they don't get privilege. I'll shut them up and make sure you get privilege.
[21:03.920 --> 21:12.920]  That is the quote. That is the definition of racketeering. DNC chair candidate bash white people and racially charged forum.
[21:12.920 --> 21:21.920]  My job is to shut other white people down and she goes on to make sure you get the privilege. That is the essence of racketeering.
[21:21.920 --> 21:29.920]  That that's what it is. I want to set up a group and organization and make sure white people don't get anything, but you get everything.
[21:29.920 --> 21:34.920]  What on earth are you talking about?
[21:34.920 --> 21:39.920]  Now, people say, oh, that is a racketeering when Trump says he's going to try to focus jobs into minority areas.
[21:39.920 --> 21:44.920]  No, those are depressed areas. Give people a right to work and be honorable and raise their kids.
[21:44.920 --> 21:51.920]  That's how you show somebody how to fish. You don't go give them fish. This is total domestication.
[21:51.920 --> 21:57.920]  We should put factories and jobs in all the poorest areas, like the Appalachians for poor white people.
[21:57.920 --> 22:05.920]  Plus, it's a low cost of living. You can put factories there, pay them a low wage that's kingly for that area,
[22:05.920 --> 22:08.920]  and they can live better there on that low wage than they could in New York City.
[22:08.920 --> 22:18.920]  There's a plan. This is what you're supposed to do. You rise up your poor areas by giving them a culture of honor and success.
[22:18.920 --> 22:26.920]  And bringing back agriculture, and we're doing it. We're doing it. Russia's bringing back organic agriculture and micro farms.
[22:26.920 --> 22:32.920]  It flips a switch in humans to do it. We're meant to do it. When we're not farming, we're killing.
[22:32.920 --> 22:38.920]  People sitting around in cities without jobs, their brain flips and says, something's wrong. I got to go out and get violent.
[22:38.920 --> 22:45.920]  You need to be either in the dirt with your wife, your husband, having kids, you know, building farms and growing crops,
[22:45.920 --> 22:53.920]  or you go to war. It's what humans do. And we are farmers, all of us, so we need to get back to it.
[22:53.920 --> 22:58.920]  And Thomas Jefferson said that, and he was absolutely on target. He said, if a nation isn't based on farmers,
[22:58.920 --> 23:06.920]  it wasn't just because they were growing things. It was the culture. It was the ingenuity and the hard workingness
[23:06.920 --> 23:13.920]  and the common sense intelligence and the toughness of farmers that he grew up around and watched compared to what he saw in the cities.
[23:13.920 --> 23:18.920]  I'm not running down city folks. I'm just telling you that this is why we've lost our soul.
[23:18.920 --> 23:24.920]  We look at Mexicans coming in here and go, well, they've got their problems in Mexico, but they're hard working and can do anything,
[23:24.920 --> 23:33.920]  or got their families and they look excited and they're doing things. Yeah, because they're farmers, folks.
[23:33.920 --> 23:41.920]  Let me stop right there, though. Let's get to the sessions clip because I mentioned it. Here he is, very ominous for old Hillary.
[23:41.920 --> 23:47.920]  And no justice is going to be done. And, you know, there were some people arguing to Trump back off.
[23:47.920 --> 23:52.920]  They're going to leave you alone and let us fix the country. And Trump knows they're not doing that now.
[23:52.920 --> 24:01.920]  Trump knows. And so Trump's not going to stand in the way and break the law and stop the ongoing criminal investigations of Hillary.
[24:01.920 --> 24:08.920]  Now, people ask members of Congress why they were seated at the inauguration shaking their hand. It's because she's dangerous.
[24:08.920 --> 24:14.920]  And when you're about to destroy somebody who's very dangerous and the head of a major mafia, you want to go over.
[24:14.920 --> 24:17.920]  It's an art of war and make them think that you're not their enemy.
[24:17.920 --> 24:24.920]  Well, I don't engage in art of war. I engage in the straight attack, which historically trumps everything.
[24:24.920 --> 24:29.920]  You've got moral power behind you. I'm coming after all these people.
[24:29.920 --> 24:35.920]  They're not going to stop Madonna saying blow up the White House and then saying F the Secret Service, you know, F Trump.
[24:35.920 --> 24:42.920]  I'm not ashamed. And then every day I see two or three articles where people are in major newspapers and major publishing houses
[24:42.920 --> 24:48.920]  and on TV saying kill Donald Trump, kill Donald Trump, blow him up, murder him.
[24:48.920 --> 24:54.920]  This is total insurrection against the restoration of our Republic. ABC airs promo.
[24:54.920 --> 24:59.920]  I'm going to play this in a moment for a show about president being shot during Trump interview.
[24:59.920 --> 25:06.920]  Teacher post video shouting, shooting Trump in the classroom with a squirt gun yelling die.
[25:06.920 --> 25:12.920]  Chinese propaganda. New Hollywood movie depicts Trump like president killing U.S.
[25:12.920 --> 25:15.920]  All bright. I'm ready to register and convert to Islam.
[25:15.920 --> 25:17.920]  See, I'm telling the left is merging with them.
[25:17.920 --> 25:24.920]  Washington Post columnist compares Trump stock market bump to Nazi Germany.
[25:24.920 --> 25:32.920]  What blows me away is just how many collaborators there are that the entire MSM pretty much the whole complex
[25:32.920 --> 25:41.920]  is literally anti-America and has a vicious hatred of this country, even though they live here and their whole future is based on how well we do.
[25:41.920 --> 25:49.920]  They're delusional because they imagine they're with the power structure and they believe because they're in these little hives of traders that they're invincible.
[25:49.920 --> 25:56.920]  It's like a bunch of criminals getting together and convincing themselves they can rob Fort Knox. You're not going to get away with it.
[25:56.920 --> 26:02.920]  And we watched you build in this thing. We just given your rope, given your rope, warn everybody, get ready.
[26:02.920 --> 26:06.920]  Now wait, when they start coming, the public that hadn't been listening is going to listen. Watch this.
[26:06.920 --> 26:13.920]  Okay, they're coming. Boom, activation. We have been in a stand up attack position for 50 years waiting for you.
[26:13.920 --> 26:16.920]  And now we just metrically went five levels bigger.
[26:16.920 --> 26:23.920]  Now you want to fight? You attack us, we get even bigger. Boom. It's called the American plan, dumbasses.
[26:23.920 --> 26:27.920]  We only let you build our strength ready to crush you in the end.
[26:27.920 --> 26:32.920]  You're going to suck up and roll up the whole global system. Watch this. Get ready to fail.
[26:32.920 --> 26:36.920]  Because I've decided you probably need to know how you're going to be destroyed.
[26:36.920 --> 26:46.920]  A lot of your top people already know this, but I think the minions and people need to know that you're going to be used as examples of what scum and traders are for decades and decades and generations to come.
[26:46.920 --> 26:51.920]  You're all going to be held up as the standard of filth.
[26:51.920 --> 26:59.920]  Your defeat will be the birth of the new millennium, as Trump said, empowering humanity.
[26:59.920 --> 27:06.920]  Your strength is our weakness. Look at Trump supporters versus your minions.
[27:06.920 --> 27:12.920]  You truly have created twisted, fallen, scared, frightened, confused mental patients.
[27:12.920 --> 27:20.920]  But you're not going to get the rest of us and somehow we're going to try to resuscitate the zombie horde, but a lot of them are too far gone.
[27:20.920 --> 27:23.920]  I've seen them. They're gone.
[27:23.920 --> 27:35.920]  We have a full right to defend ourselves from the witches like Hillary and that other harpy Madonna, who are the opposite of the beautiful spirit of womanhood.
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.920]  You are monsters. And it's why you're obsessed with claiming you dominate and run women.
[27:40.920 --> 27:43.920]  You are what you claim men are trying to do.
[27:43.920 --> 27:51.920]  You're there to dominate the spirit of women and suck off of it and bathe in its essence, its blood, and to infuse yourselves.
[27:51.920 --> 27:56.920]  The metaphysical version of who was that famous royal that would kill babies and bathe in their blood.
[27:56.920 --> 28:04.920]  I mean, you people are sick. You apply cosmetics of dead Chinese babies and take collagen injections if they're melted down fat.
[28:04.920 --> 28:08.920]  So you're already there. Let's go out to break.
[28:08.920 --> 28:13.920]  Let's go out to break with Senator Sessions about to be the Attorney General.
[28:13.920 --> 28:22.920]  Some have expressed concern about whether you can approach the Clinton matter impartially in both fact and appearance.
[28:22.920 --> 28:25.920]  How do you plan to address those concerns?
[28:25.920 --> 28:30.920]  Mr. Chairman, it was a highly contentious campaign.
[28:30.920 --> 28:41.920]  I, like a lot of people, made comments about the issues in that campaign with regard to Secretary Clinton and some of the comments I made.
[28:41.920 --> 28:46.920]  I do believe that that could place my objectivity in question.
[28:46.920 --> 28:48.920]  I've given that thought.
[28:48.920 --> 28:59.920]  I believe the proper thing for me to do would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton
[28:59.920 --> 29:02.920]  and that were raised during the campaign.
[29:02.920 --> 29:08.920]  So let me go over this note for you here. Matt made a good point in my notes here.
[29:08.920 --> 29:14.920]  Sessions A.G. confirmation hearing the notion of the legitimacy of prosecuting Clinton was assumed rather than challenged.
[29:14.920 --> 29:22.920]  And notice how Sessions never qualifies the recusal with a condition if then statement, i.e. if she's prosecuted, then I will recuse myself.
[29:22.920 --> 29:25.920]  Great point, Matt, for finding that and pointing that out.
[29:25.920 --> 29:31.920]  Okay, let me get into their hype, kill the president, blow it up, murder his supporters, because they're probably not going to get to Trump.
[29:31.920 --> 29:35.920]  Hope they don't. But they can get to us, can't they?
[29:35.920 --> 29:44.920]  And they're running around with a Jezebel spirit, infusing them by their high priestesses like Hillary and other seahags like Madonna.
[29:44.920 --> 29:56.920]  But the seahags will be defeated. Stay with us.
[30:14.920 --> 30:26.920]  This is an article that's up on our website that aggregated from Breitbart News and it talks about how this administration is going to publish a list of crimes committed by illegals in sanctuary cities weekly according to an executive order release.
[30:26.920 --> 30:33.920]  Now, this order says, quote, to better inform the public regarding public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions.
[30:33.920 --> 30:49.920]  The secretary shall utilize the declined detainer outcome report or its equivalent and on a weekly basis make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignores or otherwise fail to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.
[30:49.920 --> 30:59.920]  It looks like this administration is saying to these sanctuary cities, you deport or we're going to publish what's actually going on. I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.

[32:16.920 --> 32:32.920]  This is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium. It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more and it supports him and it supports info wars and our whole operation.
[32:32.920 --> 32:47.920]  It's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area if not to the very top of the charts. Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing. They're in full crisis mode. Nationals movements are exploding. Everybody needs to go pre-order. So you get it first at infowarsteam.com.
[32:47.920 --> 33:02.920]  The Making of a President by Roger Stone. I'm Alex Jones. I'm going on airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump. Pray for us and please continue to support the operation and get his book. Now sir, the first to have a trip to you.
[33:18.920 --> 33:29.920]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:29.920 --> 33:57.920]  We are back live. Very honored to be here with you on this historic Thursday, January 26, 2017. This is an answer, a prayer of what's happening.
[33:57.920 --> 34:12.920]  I mean, Trump is not perfect, but he really believes he's doing the right thing. He is committed and I know they're going to prosecute Hillary Clinton. They're going to go after the crime syndicate. The crime syndicate knows that. That's why they're so vicious. That's why they're so desperate.
[34:12.920 --> 34:28.920]  Trump is first going to deliver on as much of the plan as he can so that people see that it's real prosperity and that they can actually run their own lives. And then they are going to set the dogs loose as soon as the people are in place. Sessions and others are not in place yet.
[34:28.920 --> 34:47.920]  And the enemy may try to still set off a nuke, bomb, kill Trump. They're openly calling for it, trying to sell the idea that it's a great thing. We were told by insiders months ago, Paul Watson was that the new homeland series was coming out and that terrorists listened to me on the radio and that they then go out and carry out terror attacks.
[34:47.920 --> 34:58.920]  I didn't see it last night because I can't keep track of all this, but I got some phone calls and said it was clearly that. And of course they admit that the new ex-files has a character based on me who's actually a good guy.
[34:58.920 --> 35:09.920]  Because Chris Carter has said he thinks I'm a good guy and shows Chris Carter as a patriot. I've been told that for a long time, but that's because he has a lot of power obviously to put out his own productions. That's pretty rare.
[35:09.920 --> 35:19.920]  I haven't seen this homeland episode yet, but maybe later people can call in, but ABC airs promo for a show about president being shot during Trump interview.
[35:19.920 --> 35:31.920]  So this is what they're pushing on every front, ladies and gentlemen. And again, they've got all sorts of straw men out there that look and sound like me saying things that I haven't actually said.
[35:31.920 --> 35:46.920]  And just putting out stories that I've been arrested. They've been like, I don't know, more than 10 stories since Cleveland showing the state police and Cleveland police escort me out of a square where communists wouldn't let me engage in free speech and attack me.
[35:46.920 --> 35:56.920]  And the same thing happened when I tried to get in the entrance to the inaugural, the communists came and attacked us and the police drug me out again and said, no, we're going to close the entrance. You're not allowed to now.
[35:56.920 --> 36:07.920]  And then that turns into I've been arrested. So this is how they deceive you. And again, it isn't about me. It's about understanding folks that these are a pack of criminal liars.
[36:07.920 --> 36:16.920]  But it's worse than that. I've really thought about this. The crew concurs. And I'm sure of it. I've looked at it from every angle.
[36:16.920 --> 36:27.920]  They are putting out blatantly false info to then have us debate them for weeks while they're busy trying to kill the movement worldwide to bring down the new world order.
[36:27.920 --> 36:44.920]  And while other countries have self-awareness and realize the scam, and they really don't want you to realize that Trump is delivering on every front because he's gone up from 41 points and is low to 59 now in just a few months.
[36:44.920 --> 36:54.920]  And that's a skewed poll. Their methodology admittedly adds 10, 15, 20 percent, depending on how they do it to us. We're talking as high as 70 percent of privilege rating despite all of this.
[36:54.920 --> 37:10.920]  So this is a big, big deal. A huge deal. And Rasmussen and other polls show similar trends. So a very, very exciting time to be alive, but they're going to strike back.
[37:10.920 --> 37:17.920]  And listen, if the globalists were really going to back off, Trump would let them scurry away. They're not going to. So let me just give everybody the big announcement.
[37:17.920 --> 37:24.920]  We're already basically in a soft civil war in this country, and the globalists are really looking at going into high gear.
[37:24.920 --> 37:41.920]  That's why Soros and the entire Fortune 100 basically all gave, the lowest was $2 million the week after the inauguration or the week after the election went in November.
[37:41.920 --> 37:54.920]  Some companies gave 10 million, 20 million, 5 million, 3 million, 2 million. Kellogg's gave 2 million and then 3 million. They gave hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars for what you're now seeing, these marches and the violence and all the rest of it.
[37:54.920 --> 38:03.920]  They're not just doing that for no reason. They're planning something big. So keep your eyes open, your ears up, and your heads down.
[38:03.920 --> 38:13.920]  Because when I say head down, I mean, when they're shooting at you politically, we need to be popping up, taking them out politically, exposing what trash they are.
[38:13.920 --> 38:22.920]  So I think it's good that Trump and Drudge and all of us expose their lies, but I think we should just expose their lies and say, oh, look, more fraud from them.
[38:22.920 --> 38:40.920]  We know they're going to, once we catch CNN and ABC News and NBC News and the BBC and everybody putting out fake inauguration photos from right when the gates opened and doing time lapses where they cut the middle showing people emptying out in the evening using every deception they've got on Earth.
[38:40.920 --> 38:45.920]  Once you see that happening, just point out it's a fraud and move on.
[38:45.920 --> 38:56.920]  Because they're distracting. We know their liars. We know their scum and they are losing. The American people are seeing through it and that's why they are panicking so hard.
[38:56.920 --> 39:01.920]  Now, before I go any further, I've got a lot of clips I want to play here.
[39:01.920 --> 39:06.920]  We are selling out of a lot of our best selling products and it could be months until more comes in.
[39:06.920 --> 39:16.920]  We've got a small shipment because it's hard to procure all of the different super high quality organic ingredients like the BioPQQ and the CoQ10, all the other things that are in DNA force.
[39:16.920 --> 39:32.920]  Our flagship product that has nerve regrowth factor in 100 and 70 plus clinical studies show that it actually cleans out the cells and has the equivalent of, let's say, vitamin C is a howitzer shell.
[39:32.920 --> 39:37.920]  This is a hydrogen bomb on things. I mean, this is amazing.
[39:37.920 --> 39:52.920]  So go research DNA force for yourself and why it's the ultimate antioxidant formula and why it is medical grade but at a very, very inexpensive price compared to leading competitors that sell similar formulas for $200, $300, $400, $500.
[39:52.920 --> 40:03.920]  Discount is $121 right now. Sounds like a lot but folks out there on the big supplement sites hail it as one of the lowest costs out there that is medical grade.
[40:03.920 --> 40:18.920]  I mean, it is simply amazing. DNA force is back and the profit we make also funds this operation but I mean this stuff has got, depending on which batch it is, $40 to $50 in each bottle just of the BioPQQ and the other ingredients.
[40:18.920 --> 40:30.920]  I mean, it is mind blowing how expensive the true BioPQQ is. I mean, crappy synthetic BioPQQ at half strength is like $40, $50 for a little bottle at Whole Foods.
[40:30.920 --> 40:37.920]  That's why this has 175 clinical studies and nerve growth factor energizes and more 10% off.
[40:37.920 --> 40:48.920]  So go to Whole Foods.com or call toll free 888-253-3139. Infowarslife.com takes you right to the supplement section.
[40:48.920 --> 40:57.920]  Also, we have a super male vitality shortage because again we have to get stuff that's California standard and we have to prepare it as cold press and all the rest of it.
[40:57.920 --> 41:02.920]  We've got plenty of super female vitality that's a similar formula and I tell you it works even better on women as my experience.
[41:02.920 --> 41:09.920]  For example, the Lama, the libido, the energy, when I haven't had any of the super male around the house and forgot I just have super females, pretty much the same thing.
[41:09.920 --> 41:19.920]  Different dosages, different tweaks. To sign up for auto ship, get an additional 10% off on any of the products at InfowarsStore.com.
[41:19.920 --> 41:27.920]  Super male vitality is about to be sold out. So again, it might be a month or more until that comes in.

[42:16.920 --> 42:36.920]  789-277-888-7892-777. Okay, let me dive right back into the news here. Earlier, I played a clip of the Mexican president saying that he will not come up and speak to Trump.
[42:36.920 --> 42:46.920]  And that's because Trump said no need to come if you're not going to, quote, pay for the wall. And he's given Mexico several choices on how to do that.
[42:46.920 --> 42:59.920]  And again, Mexico gets hundreds of billions of dollars a year of money sent back down to it. And an eight to 14 million dollar wall is something that Mexico really should chip in on.
[42:59.920 --> 43:10.920]  It would show a sign of solidarity. And it would also show that Trump delivers on everything he says. But frankly, it was a boast of the campaign and Trump is now following through on it.
[43:10.920 --> 43:21.920]  But the issue is, is that Trump will get the money one way or another. And so if the Mexican president wants to have a confrontation with Trump, then that's basically what is about to happen.
[43:21.920 --> 43:30.920]  Trump was very gracious when he was down in Mexico and he would have been gracious if the president came up here and negotiated maybe Mexico pays for a third of it or something.
[43:30.920 --> 43:39.920]  But Mexico didn't do that. So now you're going to pay for all of it one way or another. And Trump knows America feels demoralized.
[43:39.920 --> 43:52.920]  And America has been put in this brainwashed position of feeling like we're dirty for saying you have to have an ID to vote or we can have a fence or a wall.
[43:52.920 --> 43:57.920]  When Mexico, I'm going to go back and play the president's clip. Then I'm going to get back into the death threats against Trump.
[43:57.920 --> 44:12.920]  When Mexico knows full well that they shake up a soda can, and that's what's in the reports, and spray basically hot pepper sauce up your nose, which is a smart way to torture somebody.
[44:12.920 --> 44:19.920]  I'm not saying it's good, but it doesn't really hurt you, but you think you're dying. It's way worse than waterboarding. It goes into your lungs, everything.
[44:19.920 --> 44:22.920]  I mean, it doesn't hurt you if you don't have a heart attack.
[44:22.920 --> 44:28.920]  Mexico is famous for massive, massive torture that has become totally institutionalized.
[44:28.920 --> 44:35.920]  Mexico, if students even mildly protest, hundreds of them get killed a year. I mean, 2030 at a time just disappear off the streets.
[44:35.920 --> 44:41.920]  Mexico does some horrible stuff. I'm not here bashing Mexico. I want Mexico to rehabilitate itself.
[44:41.920 --> 44:47.920]  I don't like the fact that Trump says that, well, if you're ISIS, we'll torture you. I mean, I get it's ISIS, but, you know, you turn into this once you do this.
[44:47.920 --> 44:52.920]  I mean, it seems, well, you're a bad guy, so I can torture you. Well, that's how they started in Mexico. See?
[44:52.920 --> 44:57.920]  So I'm criticizing both Trump and Mexico at the same time, because I told you, I mean, we're just going to tell it like it is with Trump.
[44:57.920 --> 45:01.920]  He turned out better than I thought, but still, there's some things that are wrong here.
[45:01.920 --> 45:09.920]  Now, expanding on this, one in Guardian, Mexico tortures migrants and citizens in effort to slow Central American surge.
[45:09.920 --> 45:18.920]  The globalists have put financial systems in all over the world to collapse the first world, the old world, the third world to consolidate control.
[45:18.920 --> 45:31.920]  Not my opinion, in fact. So when they say, oh, Latin Americans are coming here because of America, you mean because of globalist policies using American muscle to enforce it.
[45:31.920 --> 45:41.920]  Trump has real policies that will actually empower Mexico because by driving wages up here, it will force people to compete and drive up wages there as well.
[45:41.920 --> 45:57.920]  That's what the studies show. As you cut the wages, they actually, as you cut the wages in different areas of the world, it ends up basically creating what Ross Pro talked about, a giant sucking sound.
[45:57.920 --> 46:10.920]  You can't cut wages in one country and then not in another and then not have all the jobs go there. What you have to do is have wages that are rising, but that are put into areas that were already depressed to raise them up.
[46:10.920 --> 46:18.920]  But I'm not going to do an economics lesson. It gets pretty complex, but people get where I'm going historically, that general wealth, rising tide raises all ships.
[46:18.920 --> 46:24.920]  Henry Ford did some weird stuff, but he was right about paying his employees enough to buy the car.
[46:24.920 --> 46:34.920]  But see, that's a growth market. That's a renaissance market versus a clowered and piven agenda 21 global collapse paradigm.
[46:34.920 --> 46:45.920]  But I'm going off the rails here and other subjects. Mexico tortures migrants and citizens in effort to slow Central American surge, London Guardian, there's hundreds of these stories.
[46:45.920 --> 46:56.920]  Financial Times. Mexico builds its own wall against migrants. Pressure builds for measure to stem flow of refugees from the South heading to the United States. It's that bad.
[46:56.920 --> 47:04.920]  And I don't blame you people wanting to come up here, but it's only going to collapse us as well, folks. I mean, it's becoming joke level.
[47:04.920 --> 47:12.920]  Trump administration to publish weekly crimes committed by illegal aliens. Absolutely. There's been a major cover up of that here and in Europe, and that's coming to an end.
[47:12.920 --> 47:22.920]  So when the president of Mexico says, and I'm going to play the first part of the clip because we played it all earlier, says, you know, Mexico doesn't believe in walls, Mexico doesn't build walls.
[47:22.920 --> 47:30.920]  On what planet are you living? I mean, do you think we're stupid?
[47:30.920 --> 47:37.920]  Mexico has a continued wall, a 100% wall on its southern border with Guatemala.
[47:37.920 --> 47:46.920]  Well, they had a fence. Now they're building a wall, a wall in some areas of fence and others. Now they're going to finish it up as a big, strong wall because Latin America is collapsing.
[47:46.920 --> 47:53.920]  What if a plague breaks out in Latin America, south of the border in Central America? What if a plague breaks out? What if a war breaks out?
[47:53.920 --> 48:01.920]  Everybody continues to pour over. You don't have a sovereign country if you don't have a controlled border.
[48:01.920 --> 48:18.920]  And I cannot believe that I have to sit here and explain this to liberal listeners who think it's evil and bad when we have a wall, but if the Vatican has one, or if China has one, or if Mexico has one, or if Obama has one, or if Mark Zuckerberg wants one,
[48:18.920 --> 48:31.920]  Zuckerberg has like 700 acres, but there's other little pieces of property that are within his acreage and on the side of it, and he doesn't want to have any neighbors, so he's trying to force them to sell.
[48:31.920 --> 48:42.920]  And that'd be fine under English common law if he wasn't a hypocrite lecturing everybody else saying we don't have property rights. The guy is a total fraud who thinks we're dumb efforts.
[48:42.920 --> 48:49.920]  Again, let's go back to the Mexican president.
[48:49.920 --> 49:06.920]  So he says they regret the continued construction of a wall, which is for years far from the United States divided us.
[49:06.920 --> 49:14.920]  Mexico does not believe in walls. I've said this time and time again. Mexico will not pay for a wall. Okay, let's stop right there.
[49:14.920 --> 49:24.920]  Mr. President, you didn't read the art of the deal. If you'd have just shown up, been nice to Trump, you could have gotten out probably paying for 30% of it, but you're going to pay for some of it.
[49:24.920 --> 49:37.920]  NATO is going to pay. Japan is going to pay. South Korea is going to pay. The big globalist system saps America to build this whole world defense grid, and then we go bankrupt and fall into the ground.
[49:37.920 --> 49:43.920]  That's all you had to do was go up there and Trump would have been eating out of your hand, but Trump cannot abide.
[49:43.920 --> 49:55.920]  He's basically OCD in a good way, about one-sided deals, one-way streets, crew jobs. So now Mexico, you're going to pay for 100% for being pigheaded, so get ready.
[49:55.920 --> 50:07.920]  You're going to pay for 100%. Because Trump believes in fairness, he wants Mexico to attack with a bunch of anti-American garbage to rekindle our nationalism.
[50:07.920 --> 50:15.920]  He's basically going to use Mexico and all this anti-American hate to only make his agenda more popular. But first, he gave you a chance.
[50:15.920 --> 50:24.920]  He went down and was super gracious, super nice, said, let's negotiate this, let's talk about it, come up, but if you're not going to agree to work with us on this, that means pay for some of it.
[50:24.920 --> 50:30.920]  If you don't know how this works, then you're going to pay for all of it.
[50:30.920 --> 50:39.920]  It's just unbelievable that people don't understand how Trump works. It's all right there. He's so easy to predict. They claim he's unpredictable. No, he's very easy to predict.
[50:39.920 --> 50:45.920]  You're going to negotiate, you're going to do a deal that's good for everybody, or you're going to be run over. It's that simple.
[50:45.920 --> 50:51.920]  And he's got control of the biggest, most powerful country there is to do it, and it's about to relaunch the Republic.
[50:51.920 --> 50:58.920]  So let me just warn everybody, including the globalists, get out of the way. We'll be back with the calls to kill Trump. Stay with me.

[53:57.920 --> 53:59.920]  Let's go.
[53:59.920 --> 54:01.920]  Let's go.
[54:29.920 --> 54:52.920]  My dad's grandmother lived to be 103. My dad's so funny. He was telling me how they got sent out of North Texas to Florida how his grandmother's mother did, because they were Indians, and then how they'd come back to Texas.
[54:52.920 --> 55:04.920]  Then I went and looked it up and I said, Dad, do you know what Native Americans those are? It was just really funny. You just can't make this stuff up. You can't make this stuff up.
[55:04.920 --> 55:12.920]  But she was still there at about 100. She wasn't there at about 103. But it's funny. What was her nickname? Ma Jones.
[55:12.920 --> 55:23.920]  All right, let's go ahead and her real name was Moon Jones. Interesting stuff. A lot of history gone.
[55:23.920 --> 55:34.920]  History, though, is now happening right before us, isn't it? And it's hard to believe that we're about to end the first month of 2017 before we have a twinkle in our eye.
[55:34.920 --> 56:00.920]  It'll be 2018 and then on and on and on, having an L. It goes on and on, doesn't it? Well, during the ABC interview with the 45th president of the United States, the snarky, sniveling reporter snaking around, in between that, we were all treated to an ad where the president is assassinated,
[56:00.920 --> 56:26.920]  promoting a show designated survivor. Here it is.
[56:26.920 --> 56:38.920]  And again, it's not a very good visual for folks that are on the radio, but Kiefer Sutherland's in it, and the president gets killed so he has to take over. This is what they're running.
[56:38.920 --> 56:50.920]  You're like, oh, that's just that one thing. No ABCs talked about it. He should be killed. The New York Times has a Washington Post. I mean, you've seen everywhere, the LA Times, Newsweek, Time Magazine have called for riots and burning cities.
[56:50.920 --> 56:58.920]  When it's time to riot, it's incredible. And then when they riot and attack you, they just say you did something wrong.
[56:58.920 --> 57:15.920]  Meanwhile, a teacher post video, shooting Trump with squirt gun, that's up on infowars.com, screaming die in front of the class. That was high school teacher post video, shooting Trump with squirt gun in classroom, screaming die.
[57:15.920 --> 57:28.920]  Can we get the audio of this? Go ahead and fade it up if you can. Let's play this again.
[57:28.920 --> 57:42.920]  I mean, this is what you have. You have this elementary school students sitting there while they're crazy whacked out witch teacher screams and yells while they're projecting Trump during the inauguration being inaugurated.
[57:42.920 --> 57:51.920]  I mean, when we were kids, they'd show the inauguration or the space shuttle or whatever. The teacher kept their mouth shut. Now it's a harpy, a mental patient screaming die, die, die.
[57:51.920 --> 58:00.920]  And you hear the little kids in the background going, oh, what? Imagine how whacked out they are. The child abuse of this insanity.
[58:00.920 --> 58:08.920]  If Hillary would have been elected, and I saw a conservative teacher squirt gunning saying die, die in front of kids, I'd say fire that person.
[58:08.920 --> 58:15.920]  What a lunatic. What a group of crazy people. And then they white people just walk up a Starbucks or screaming at some black lady.
[58:15.920 --> 58:23.920]  Trump won. I deserve all this stuff. You're attacking me. Just crazy. Crazy white people running around calling black people racist as Trump won.
[58:23.920 --> 58:30.920]  I mean, just whacked out loons. And it gets worse. China officially taken over Hollywood. They've got movies coming out.
[58:30.920 --> 58:40.920]  I'm going to cover this when we come back, you know, where Trump is basically a dictator and at the end of the world and they're all calling him Hitler. I mean, this is a group of lunatics, but not the people controlling them.
[58:40.920 --> 59:01.920]  They know what they're doing.
[59:10.920 --> 59:25.920]  Absolutely needs in the history of him for life. We've brought out a lot of amazing products like survival shield X to super male vitality and so many others with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[59:25.920 --> 59:38.920]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products. And this part is most important. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[59:38.920 --> 59:51.920]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure and rest secured. You're finding the tip of the spear in the info war. That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[59:51.920 --> 1:00:10.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:25.920]  The difference to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:45.920]  All right, and I've got to correct myself. It was another one where they're screaming and yelling at Trump in front of the elementary school that I saw. This is another one where it's in a high school. You can hear the students in the background going what is the woman screams die, die, die and is sitting there spraying the projection of Trump's inauguration.
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:01:11.920]  But it's the same shrieking, freaking out craziness that is just bizarre. Here, let's roll it again with sound if we can.
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:24.920]  This is who you don't need having a gun. I love how when she does the gun, she like does it like that. Like that's what makes the bullets come out. You want to hold it very still and just pull the tray back.
[1:01:24.920 --> 1:01:31.920]  By the way, I don't want to show off my marksmanship, but I hadn't been shooting a lot in years and I've been out shooting some more these days.
[1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:43.920]  I think we're going to do some live Facebook mentions with some thousand yard shooting for folks and we're going to bring some military guys out and see how they shoot with me. We're going to find out, but that's a whole different deal from actual combat shooting.
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:50.920]  Like climbing over stuff and running and doing all our swimming in a lake and then getting out and shooting. That's a whole different deal, but we're going to we're going to have a shooting contest.
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:02:01.920]  I'm going to bring some special ops guys out with me and we're going to we're going to see you can shoot better than a thousand yards. Obviously show off to everyone. I'll really make the left get pissed.
[1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:13.920]  I'll probably get beat. We'll see what happens. But do it for charity. I tried to get the Travis County SWAT team wants to have a competition with me because they kept coming over there and trying to keep me from giving speeches in front of the county commensures like 20 years ago.
[1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:23.920]  And finally, we became friends and they were about to have a shooting contest with me and then the then the sheriff who's a hard hard Hillary type person wouldn't let him have it.
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:29.920]  You know, I'm really digressing right now. I apologize. Just watching that woman shoot like that was pretty ridiculous.
[1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:35.920]  So continuing here, I'm going to get to more of this coming up in the next segment because this is just too important to cover in the last minute here.
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:45.920]  But Chinese propaganda. New Hollywood movie depicts Trump like president killing the United States. That's right. So he's Hitler. He's killing the U.S.
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:53.920]  Whereas in reality, the stock market is now up $2 trillion. His approval rating is soaring towards 60 points at 59 from 41 in Gallup brass music.
[1:02:53.920 --> 1:03:02.920]  You name it show similar numbers and the elite are in panic mode as he fulfills every promise he would, except for one that I'm sure they told him, Mr. President.
[1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:11.920]  It's not your prerogative to be in the judicial or in the prosecutorial range. You're the executive. So you can't say I'm going to lock you up, sir.
[1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:18.920]  We just have to have the prosecutors do their job. He's like, oh, well, yes. Oh, I like her. Yeah, let's move on a little bit.
[1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:25.920]  Oh, she tries to destroy him still. No, she knows what's coming. But but but verbally he's kind of starting to break that promise a little bit.
[1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:32.920]  He's he's you know, let's say on degrees one to 10 totally never blocking a prosecution, which would be illegal.
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:40.920]  If he did that would be a 10 and totally, you know, pushing for it to be prosecuted would be a 10 as well as you're not supposed to do that.
[1:03:40.920 --> 1:03:47.920]  But just sitting back and letting the job be done and not getting involved. That's what he needs to do. That's a that's a that's a zero.
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:57.920]  That's what he's supposed to do. But I think right now he's on a two or three. He just he just shouldn't call me. She's saying I'm going to let the law be followed and have the investigators go into it.
[1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:07.920]  I don't want to influence things saying I hope she doesn't get prosecuted. I hope this is all over. I think that's where I have an issue with the president because he would do it just right.
[1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:17.920]  If he just said I'm going to let the people whose job that is under the Constitution discharge their duty as they swore in their oath of office just as I've done.
[1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:30.920]  But I have to tell you that the whole world knows about what happened with Hillary and so I'm going to I'm going to recuse myself just like Senator Sessions is saying he's going to do if confirmed.
[1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:40.920]  That's where I stand on that. That's about the best balanced angle you're going to get on that. But coming back Chinese propaganda new Hollywood movie depicts Trump like president killing the U.S.
[1:04:40.920 --> 1:04:52.920]  Albright's ready to convert to Islam. Washington Post again falls him Hitler. And so guess what more Islamists have been caught raping women and it keeps turning out the media tries to suppress it.
[1:04:52.920 --> 1:04:59.920]  But it's called the rape games. You've heard of the Hunger Games. This is more like the rape games will be right back. Stay with us.
[1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:07.920]  Sanctuary cities across the nation are pushing back against President Trump's immigration policies. They're vowing to take it all the way to the courts.
[1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:18.920]  Bill de Blasio of New York is promising immediate action against Sanctuary City's order as President Trump's executive order is said to block federal funding to sanctuary cities just like New York.
[1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:28.920]  De Blasio is saying that it's very susceptible to legal challenge and he's promising to take it to the court immediately for an injunction to stop the order if an attempt to pull funds from the city is made.
[1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:36.920]  He says if they make an attempt to pull that money it would be from the NYPD from security funding to fighting terrorism. Of course we know that simply isn't true.
[1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:44.920]  The president is trying to enforce the law of the land and say that these rogue cities have no right to get benefits to people that are here illegally.
[1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:54.920]  On Wednesday Trump signed an order to stop federal funds from going to these cities from New York to San Francisco that have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agencies.
[1:05:54.920 --> 1:05:59.920]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for InvaWars.com.

[1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:29.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:48.920]  John Rappaport is coming up in the fourth hour of nomorefakenews.com. He coined that term 15 years ago that the mainstream media is the fake news. So we need to put out an article explaining, we should do this, man who coined the term fake news and copyrighted it. I know he's got a copyright.
[1:08:48.920 --> 1:09:15.920]  It's just so crazy that he had the proper name for them 15 years ago when he started his website. So Rappaport is coming up on the transmission today and we will also, of course, be taking your phone calls in this hour.
[1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:39.920]  If you just joined me you heard the different reports where they've got everybody from the Washington Post to you name it saying that Trump is Hitler and calling for riots and calling for him to die for the White House to be blown up like Madonna is saying and ABC is airing pieces during the interview with Trump showing the president being murdered
[1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:51.920]  as they prepare the public's mind for all of their different plans. They are not giving up. They are moving into high gear.
[1:09:51.920 --> 1:10:09.920]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-931-800-259-9231 and longtime callers, first-time callers, if you agree, disagree, you're welcome to call in on any subject you wish but I am going to try to actually go to your calls and move from them quickly.
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:18.920]  Do you think that Trump is delivering on his promises? Do you think that Trump is reneging on any promises?
[1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:28.920]  What do you think of the first six days of the Trump presidency? 800-259-9231. But quick questions or quick comments because I want to move to the next person.
[1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:38.920]  Let's hit a few of these stories. Chinese propaganda, this is up on DrudgeReport.com on the right-hand side. New Hollywood movie depicts Trump-like president killing the U.S.
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:50.920]  It's an info war story by Jamie White. And I keep pointing out that so many of the movies I go to see have pro-communist Chinese propaganda in them.
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:11:07.920]  It's getting more and more obvious. Anti-Trump chai comms buying up Hollywood. Hollywood has set to begin work on Little America, a dystopian adventure movie set in the future where a Trump-like U.S. president has bankrupted America and China has called in its debts.
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:16.920]  The film set to be produced by explosion obsessed director Michael Bay describes a future where the president has destroyed American economy.
[1:11:16.920 --> 1:11:19.920]  Again, that's what the globalists are doing. You cannot make this up.
[1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:28.920]  Promoting China and prompting China to call in its debts, making it the de facto owner of the country while many Americans immigrate to China for work.
[1:11:28.920 --> 1:11:36.920]  Oh, because China is so wonderful where they have mobile execution vans. I'm going to cut a dystopian trailer for this movie going in the future.
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:46.920]  Americans leave the hell of their republic and all of their freedom to go to China where there's mobile execution vans and where peaceful Buddhists are kept in cages for their organs to be harvested.
[1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:53.920]  And Americans dream of visiting the Wonderland where the rivers are so toxic they catch on fire.
[1:11:53.920 --> 1:12:01.920]  But see, China needs propaganda. They're not good at it. So they're buying Hollywood to produce films that are for both markets.
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:08.920]  Both leftist propaganda to demoralize us and propaganda in China to make them feel good.
[1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:15.920]  I mean, whether you go see The Martian or whether you go see The Arrival or any of these movies, it's always America needs help.
[1:12:15.920 --> 1:12:23.920]  And then the Chinese president is a good guy and saves us and they're the ones that crack all the codes and they're the ones that give us the boosters to get to Mars.
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:30.920]  And they're the ones that teach us how to potty when we're one year old and they're the ones that, you know, bounce us on their knee and just they're so good.
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:41.920]  They're so loving. And the globalists openly say we're looking to China to bully America into submitting to the New World Order with straight faces on TV and in major newspapers.
[1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:50.920]  China sure is right about censoring the web. Boy, after Trump got elected, they've been vindicated for the great work they do knocking out fake news.
[1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:54.920]  Computer world. New York Times had those exact quotes.
[1:12:54.920 --> 1:13:03.920]  I tell you, China's really vindicated right now. I know they sell baby parts. They boil it down and sell it for women to eat in pills and inject.
[1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:12.920]  God, they got the moral high ground. Yeah, you heard that Mexican president. We don't believe in walls. How dare you, America, as they build a huge one.
[1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:23.920]  Already have a fence. I mean, it's just, it's just, it's just too much to handle. But again, they're targeting the dumbest people they can show with a straight face.
[1:13:23.920 --> 1:13:25.920]  Let me just read this to you.
[1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:35.920]  Hollywood is set to begin work on little America to make you feel small. And when the Chinese watch it, even though they're slaves, they'll just go, oh, America little.
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:38.920]  I mean, the propaganda couldn't get any more dumbed down.
[1:13:38.920 --> 1:13:51.920]  Autobots prepare to serve the Communist Chinese to defeat America. In fact, imagine I am Optimus Prime. They're evil Americans. I must take out Trump. Bumblebee.
[1:13:51.920 --> 1:14:06.920]  Megatron is actually disguised as Trump. Take him out. Don't let him cut the taxes and make America great again. And yes, we must get the other Autobots to rally against the other Decepticon Putin.
[1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:12.920]  Yeah, there is 15 Hollywood movies that were saved by China at the box office.
[1:14:12.920 --> 1:14:27.920]  And now they're set to just take it over. I mean, the worst the movie is, they're just unwatchable, but it's all red flags and the Chinese president saving everyone who could make up the trashiness of Hollywood.
[1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:34.920]  Transformers the age of extinction, pro-China propaganda. Yeah, even mainstream media just admits this, but they hide it in plain view.
[1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:43.920]  Okay, China's taking over everything. Okay, the Chinese president, they're in, they're in Switzerland at the Davos meeting, says he'll take over, don't worry.
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:51.920]  He'll stop Trump. He got like his hands on his hips like, what have I caught you doing in the cookie jar? How dare you not let us have one-sided deals?
[1:14:51.920 --> 1:15:05.920]  In fact, maybe they can have one where the Chinese dictator is actually like Optimus Prime and then Trump's head is on Megatron. And he's like, prepare to die, Megatron.
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:13.920]  And it's the Chinese president. And then Trump's like, no, you will never defeat me. I'm evil.
[1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:28.920]  Or put Hitler's head on Megatron. I mean, the propaganda is so unwatchable, but you go in and full grown American men should go get them. Yeah, get them.
[1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:33.920]  Oh yeah, get them. They have the NFL coming out against the Second Amendment.
[1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:47.920]  Now, good old boys are like, I like the NFL. It's time to turn the guns in. I believe in Obama now. I hate, I hate John Wayne.
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:16:01.920]  That's it. The Chinese president's head can be on Optimus Prime and they can resurrect John Wayne and put his head on Megatron and have, and have the Chinese president cut the head off John Wayne.
[1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:12.920]  I'm John Wayne. I'm evil. And then he comes back as Megatron. No, no, he comes back as Optimus Prime. I can't believe this anymore.
[1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:19.920]  But this is how dumbed down their constituents are. Let me stop right there.
[1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:25.920]  Now, listen to this with a straight face. Hollywood is set to begin work on Little America.
[1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:33.920]  How about they put out a movie like Americans have small penises? That'd be even better. Or Americans are all stupid.
[1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:46.920]  I mean, this is just to demoralize us. Hollywood is a complete, sworn enemy of this country in their own crazy bubbles, so desperate to destroy us that they have now gone even more over the top than they thought they could.
[1:16:46.920 --> 1:17:00.920]  What a joke. So workless, so bankrupt, so over, so despised, so bypassed that they're in a love fest with a collapsing communist dictatorship that has a fake stock market and is already collapsing.
[1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:15.920]  China is descending into hell. Let me continue. Hollywood, I guess Chai-Com would, or Trader would, is set to begin work on Little America.
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:22.920]  Talk about the most brazen propaganda. I'm sorry, I can't read this with a straight face.
[1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:28.920]  Hollywood is set to begin work on Little Pee-Pee. I'm sorry. Hollywood is set to begin work on Little Ding-Dong.
[1:17:28.920 --> 1:17:39.920]  I apologize, folks. Hollywood is set to begin work on Little America, a dystopian adventure movie set in the future where a Trump-like U.S. president has bankrupted America.
[1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:46.920]  It was the globalist said that. And China has called in its debts. Good. You'll totally collapse.
[1:17:46.920 --> 1:18:03.920]  The film, set to be produced by explosion-obsessed director Michael Bay, who does the Transformers, describes a future where the president has destroyed the American economy, prompting China to call in its debts, making it the de facto owner of the country while many Americans immigrate to China for work.
[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:10.920]  China has actually produced TV ads years ago saying just this. I mean, this is complete 100% communist dictatorship.
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:22.920]  I got a new idea. How about Kim Jong-un? He likes Hollywood. How about he underwrites with maybe some of the slave minds they've got, some of that money, and it can be officially underwritten by starving North Koreans?
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:33.920]  This is the same thing. China does stuff just as worse or probably even worse than this. How about that? How about that's a great idea. How about North Korea start underwriting movies?
[1:18:33.920 --> 1:18:44.920]  And in it, Kim Jong-un can star. Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un is Optimus Prime. Kim Jong-un, I am here as Optimus Prime to defeat you, Trump.
[1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:52.920]  And then he literally just rips the arms off. Take this, Trump. Take that, Megatron Trump. See, it's perfect.
[1:18:52.920 --> 1:19:00.920]  Just have some laser beams and shuba-blaboo for whatever his name is, running around ducking and battling the evil Americans.
[1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:07.920]  Man, this shows you how close the country was to being completely gone. They were going ahead with the Chinese takeover of our media and our culture.
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:22.920]  Not parachutes coming down like Red Dawn, but cultural. Universal Pictures recently picked up the rights to the movie after a heated bidding war with several producers reports the Hollywood reporter.
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:30.920]  The plot of the movie follows a former American force recon member whose house see our special forces join with the Chinese.
[1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:37.920]  Oh, you can't take this up. The plot of the movie. The plot. Skip the break. I have to do this. This is too funny.
[1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:42.920]  I'm going to get serious right now. I'm going to go to your calls. I'm going to do. I'm actually going to read this in the voice of Optimus Prime.
[1:19:42.920 --> 1:19:54.920]  The plot of the movie follows a former American force recon Marine who was hired by the Chinese billionaire to infiltrate an American ghetto and rescue his daughter.
[1:19:54.920 --> 1:20:01.920]  See, it's okay that he works with the Chinese because he's rescuing his daughter. See, in creating a race war.
[1:20:01.920 --> 1:20:10.920]  I can't believe this is even allowed to go on. This is foreign outside propaganda. I know the Russians aren't.
[1:20:10.920 --> 1:20:18.920]  The tone of the movie is said to be similar to the 1981 John Carpenter film escaped from New York, starring Kurt Russell.
[1:20:18.920 --> 1:20:28.920]  We got to come back into the next break with that music. These efforts to portray Trump as a weak leader responsible for America's downfall is no coincidence.
[1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:43.920]  Neither is the portrayal of China as the real controller of America. Just a few months ago, China bought all six Hollywood studios and unprecedented buy up a movie meant to repurpose Hollywood films to serve China's agenda.
[1:20:43.920 --> 1:20:49.920]  It's hard to stay anonymous prime, including influence public perception with state sponsored propaganda.
[1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:56.920]  Is this lost to anybody? We're told the Russians are the reason that Trump was elected when they basically had no involvement.
[1:20:56.920 --> 1:21:02.920]  But Communist China is openly buying up the six big Hollywood studios. They've already begun.
[1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:09.920]  They're involved saying we can't have Trump. So is the Pope. So is the EU. One fifth of Hillary's money came from the Saudi Arabians.
[1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:16.920]  And Trump needs to come out against this right now. In fact, I'm shooting a special message to Trump today.
[1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:23.920]  They're going to have to pull the Star Destroyer out of the asteroid field so I can send a clear signal, but I'm going to send a transmission.
[1:21:23.920 --> 1:21:34.920]  And seriously, folks, you send a transmission that China thinks were so broke back and so pathetic that they're openly buying up all the studios telling people what movies can come out.
[1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:39.920]  They blocked Red Dawn two from coming out, made them re-edit it to take China out and are now totally taking over.
[1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:46.920]  Remember about six years ago when you were laughing at me saying China was taking over and they had all the white supremacists going, oh, shut up, Jones.
[1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:54.920]  Quit covering up for the Jews and all the rest of it. I was in Hollywood. I was in the meetings. It was happening.
[1:21:54.920 --> 1:22:00.920]  I was hearing, oh, that can't come out. You can't criticize China. Whatever you do, just don't put China in it.
[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:04.920]  And it wasn't just because they wouldn't allow the film to be in China. It's because they're buying everything up.
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:14.920]  This is globalism, them ganging up militarily, corporately, culturally, and taking over the United States with corporate colonization and anchor babies.
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:20.920]  And I love Chinese people when they're American. They're hardworking, Americana, great, beautiful, wonderful people.
[1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:27.920]  But the people they're sending over now with the anchor babies to get a U.S. citizen kid are admittedly part of a larger takeover plan.
[1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:33.920]  And our government has greased the skids for it. And we've got a major Chinese invasion on our hands.
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:40.920]  And that isn't rhetorical. It's textbook, mega massive, 21st century, full spectrum dominance warfare.
[1:22:40.920 --> 1:22:47.920]  So of course they're telling us it's the Russians who are under the same attack trying to stabilize. Russia and the United States are under globalist attack.
[1:22:47.920 --> 1:22:53.920]  The globalists had control of the U.S. But they were about to fully chop the country's head off and put the chai comms basically in charge.
[1:22:53.920 --> 1:23:02.920]  Look at Davos two weeks ago. People aren't laughing now. They openly said, we will teach America. We will bring in world government. We will defeat Trump.
[1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:11.920]  You know what? Trump, there's been some talk about Trump blocking these mergers because it is a trust, a propaganda trust.
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:19.920]  I'm not even sure that's needed. We need to boycott Hollywood now. We need to pick at these films, just like we did Machete that was funded by the White House to create racial division.
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:29.920]  And we need to point out the communist Chinese are funding anti-American films openly funding it and openly showing sedition in America and trying to make our country fall.
[1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:37.920]  This is enemy propaganda. They won't even let films into China that are even pro free market or even talk about God.
[1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:43.920]  So they allow total censorship of their country. And now they're here trying to influence our election and involved.
[1:23:43.920 --> 1:23:49.920]  And Trump needs an investigation of the Chinese communist and the Saudi Arabians and others in our election.
[1:23:49.920 --> 1:23:57.920]  And we can send the people involved with the DNC to prison and say, see, it wasn't the Russians. This is the normal course.
[1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:06.920]  Some MSM dinosaur or trader media will say, the sky is green when it's blue. Alex, no, you can't do that. You're not allowed to do that.
[1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:15.920]  This isn't going to happen. There's no such thing. You're trying to be fascist. No, I'm calling for law to be enforced.
[1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:25.920]  We have the communist Chinese that the globalists have sold our jobs out to and try to position us to be their minions, stealing all our technology, openly trying to lecture us right now.
[1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:31.920]  That they own us and control us. It's sickening. And I've told you for years, who have they linked up with?
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:43.920]  The global central banks, the EU, the communist Chinese and the Muslims led by Saudi Arabia and their dominant form of Wahhabist cult garbage.
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:49.920]  And they've all linked up against what's left of Europe, what's left of the UK, what's left of the US and Australia.
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:55.920]  And for them, the globalists aren't making it race-based because that's always a good operating system for tribalism.
[1:24:55.920 --> 1:25:01.920]  With China, it's race-based. With Latin America, they're trying to make it race-based, though most Latin Americans are rejecting it.
[1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:05.920]  With Africa, they're making it race-based, though most Africans are rejecting it. They are.
[1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:13.920]  But still, we have got a big battle. We ought to be thanking God for Trump and the fact that he sees this and understands this attack profile.
[1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:22.920]  And you ought to be getting this live transmission link and this archive when it comes out later today about the communist Chinese plan to take over America with the Democrats to everyone you know.
[1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:28.920]  Remember Bill Ayers, back in the 70s, wanted to have Chinese come in and help run the death camps for Americans that came out in court?
[1:25:28.920 --> 1:25:34.920]  They were just thinking old-fashioned with physical Chinese. First, the propaganda rolls out.
[1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:41.920]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls to Zach and Cindy and James and Kevin and Blake and others.
[1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:47.920]  Let's go to Blake. He says he disagrees from Texas. You're on the air, Blake. Welcome.
[1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:54.920]  Thanks for taking my call. I disagree not about the communist Chinese or Hollywood.
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:26:04.920]  I disagree with something you said yesterday, was that you didn't want a presence in the White House press room.
[1:26:04.920 --> 1:26:18.920]  I mean, it's your operation and I think you feel like you can be more of an impact on the outside.
[1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:27.920]  I think it's just such a tremendous opportunity to be able to ask the president any kind of question, to be able to control the news cycle.
[1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:29.920]  I think it's a great opportunity.
[1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:34.920]  Well, I think you're taking out of context what I said, okay? A, we have to have the money.
[1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:37.920]  I got people running around here saying send me to Washington. Send me to Washington.
[1:26:37.920 --> 1:26:43.920]  We'll do it on your own money. Go. Go now. I mean, I just have to run an operation. I have to have real money.
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:49.920]  I have to actually then plan things out. I have to make sure who I send doesn't just, you know, screw off all day.
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:55.920]  I can't get basic operations I want to launch from older plans done, so I have to finish those.
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:27:00.920]  Full ideas, not a lot of action. So I do agree we need to be there and ask real questions and it's important.
[1:27:00.920 --> 1:27:04.920]  And I did criticize the fact that they're going to ABC and they're going to CNN first.
[1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:10.920]  Well, where's Breitbart? You know, Breitbart's important. So Bannon is in the White House. Who cares?
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:15.920]  There were tons of people from the media inside the Clinton and Obama White Houses and back and forth.
[1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:24.920]  So yes, I'm going to get around to, you know, try to figure out who we want to try to send up there to do that and to be in those press conferences.
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:28.920]  I told Paul Watson, I think he's the best choice and that's who was recommended.
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:35.920]  You know, I was like, hey, we like Paul Watson and just, you know, and so I got to go through that process of doing that and of getting into those events.
[1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:39.920]  I just don't want to make it all about chasing the tail like old fashioned media.
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:46.920]  We can sit there and talk about the issues in live time. We can tweet Trump and Facebook Trump and have him respond days later.
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:53.920]  They're listening. They're watching. I'm not going to get into any details, but the president routinely listens to the show.
[1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:59.920]  OK, so you want to talk to Trump? You want to ask him a question? Go ahead and do it right now. Go ahead.
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:11.920]  Well, I mean, I think I think a great, you know, a great, I mean, you know, asking him about, for instance, the Communist Chinese, you know, doing this, asking him.
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:16.920]  Absolutely. Absolutely. That way we can inject it totally. Yeah, the Communist Chinese admit they're taking over a media.
[1:28:16.920 --> 1:28:20.920]  They have major movies coming out where China takes over America.
[1:28:20.920 --> 1:28:28.920]  Is this something that is a national security issue? Because no other country on earth would put up with something like this being done inside their nation.
[1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:35.920]  Our media being taken over by China is the real fake news issue. And they're calling for censoring independent media in this country, sir.
[1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:40.920]  They're calling for shutting down our free press. They're making a move on America's First Amendment.
[1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:44.920]  Mr. President, what are you going to do about it?
[1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:54.920]  Yeah, I think it's I think it's great. You know, another something I thought about was was that, again, ABC News, NBC News will not ask the president.
[1:28:54.920 --> 1:29:00.920]  But, you know, he was he was talking about investigating a lot of the voter fraud.
[1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:11.920]  Well, what has been made public at least, at least what Sean Spicer had indicated was that they were going to be looking at illegal immigrant voting and, you know, people being bussed in things like that.
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:18.920]  But are they also going to be looking at the rigged machines? Are they also would they consider consulting Bev Harris?
[1:29:18.920 --> 1:29:24.920]  People like that. Absolutely. I've already sent a report to Trump on all this and we have public reports.
[1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:31.920]  It's the public reports that are the best because we can then lay it all out and we can break it all down here and then show it to everybody.
[1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:41.920]  And then we the people that Trump's listening to get the intel to him. The president spends hours every day going over stacks of independent American media.
[1:29:41.920 --> 1:30:02.920]  God bless you. Great point, Blake. I don't think we disagree. We'll be back.
[1:30:12.920 --> 1:30:26.920]  We have an article that's up on our website that aggregated from Breitbart News and it talks about how this administration is going to publish a list of crimes committed by illegals in sanctuary cities weekly according to an executive order release.
[1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:42.920]  Now, this order says, quote, to better inform the public regarding public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions, the secretary shall utilize the declined detainer outcome report or its equivalent and on a weekly basis make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions
[1:30:42.920 --> 1:30:56.920]  committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignores or otherwise fail to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens. It looks like this administration is saying to these sanctuary cities, you deport or we're going to publish what's actually going on.
[1:30:56.920 --> 1:31:24.920]  This is Margaret Hale reporting for info wars dot com.

[1:32:57.920 --> 1:33:07.920]  The real red dawn is here.
[1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:21.920]  It's 1159 at Radio Free America. This is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn. Right now I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone. The chair is against the wall. The chair is against the wall.
[1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:39.920]  John has a long mustache. John has a long mustache. It's 12 o'clock Americans, another day closer to victory. And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:46.920]  But they took a lot of people away. People that they thought were going to make trouble for them. People that had guns and things they wanted. They just took them away.
[1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:47.920]  Where?
[1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:58.920]  Re-education camps. That's what they call it. So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:09.920]  I have decided we really need camps for adults. And we need the type of camps that you all run. I mean really.
[1:34:09.920 --> 1:34:18.920]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register. Now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:22.920]  I'm a sorry citizen. I refuse to recognize you guys.
[1:34:22.920 --> 1:34:25.920]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:29.920]  I mean we've got a lot of competition with a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:39.920]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:56.920]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States. It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:03.920]  This is what we're doing here and let's not kid about it. We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:05.920]  Put your gun down really?
[1:35:05.920 --> 1:35:14.920]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:17.920]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:27.920]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not. They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:37.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:46.920]  There's a war on for your mind. It's happening now but in the 1980s film Red Dawn, it was the Russians with the Latin American back group which was a plan that they were trying to devise.
[1:35:46.920 --> 1:35:54.920]  I don't know what happened because the Second Amendment, as Admiral Yamamoto said, if you invade the mainland U.S. you'd be a rival behind every blade of grass.
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:36:12.920]  So instead the globalists, the same megabanks that actually overthrew Russia and overthrew China and actually put Mao Zedong in have now shipped our jobs there economically and are now having China take over the media and teach us in the last few months how to shut down fake news,
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:30.920]  which is anybody that reports that Hollywood's been taken over by the Communist Chinese who are now producing films, major blockbuster level films with the maker of transformers to show Trump being basically overthrown by the Communist Chinese.
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:34.920]  That's linked on drudgerport.com. It's a Jamie White article from infowars.com.
[1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:43.920]  And what I can't believe is this isn't in more of the news. This is big. It's like, oh yeah, the Chinese just bought up controlling interest in the major six Hollywood production houses.
[1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:57.920]  Whoa. You know Hollywood because I've been critical of this. We can't get anybody connected to Hollywood and any of the unions to fix light bulbs, to do these studios, any of it.
[1:36:57.920 --> 1:37:05.920]  And they tell us no, we'll never work again if we work with infowars. We've been told don't work with you by Robert Rodriguez, other people like that.
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:17.920]  And that's how their mindset works. They're going to bring in the Chinese Communist with the hundreds of billions of dollars with the muscle all of it and just take over the entertainment media and flood everything with anti-American crap,
[1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:19.920]  total division crap.
[1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:28.920]  The Communist Chinese fund, you know, somebody to come quote, save his family and I guess start a race war in America. Who would put up with this crap from Hollywood?
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:37.920]  Hollywood is so traitorous, so evil, so bad, so turned over to their hatred of this country. I mean, you see them. They want to blow the White House up.
[1:37:37.920 --> 1:37:48.920]  They're totally disconnected. They sit here in this country with all this freedom and beg for Communist China to take us down at Davos in the last two weeks.
[1:37:48.920 --> 1:38:04.920]  The peso is tumbling after Mexico's president says he won't meet with Trump. The peso is tumbling today after Mexico's president announced he had canceled a meeting scheduled for next week with President Trump.
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:14.920]  The peso was down 1.2% per dollar. The currency been up as much as 0.8 per dollar when it began to fall.
[1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:25.920]  Drain the swamp. Trump triggers mass resignations at State Department. Former Clinton insiders leave the State Department. Get Daniels up on infowars.com.
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:31.920]  Absolutely delivering on every single front.
[1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:36.920]  Amazing. Now I want to go back to your phone calls and I've got more clips I want to get to.
[1:38:36.920 --> 1:38:52.920]  The caller earlier again made a good point. It'd be great to have real media in the press conferences asking real questions instead of ABC News and CBS News saying you didn't even get elected, Mr. President.
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:39:08.920]  But that's for Trump to understand. MSN, that's totally discredited, is never going to stop lying and attacking the president until it's been pointed out that foreign multinational countries working with the Communist Chinese have bought up and have controlling shares in those companies
[1:39:08.920 --> 1:39:26.920]  and that we're looking at actual globalist operatives who have it out for this country like enemy soldiers. It's so much worse than I can even describe. It's so unbelievable that we have sunk to this point and only at the very end when they were going to shut infowars
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:39.920]  and the rest of free press down this year, did the American people finally wake up enough to get a president in despite the fact that that walking corpse, and I don't say that like I'm going to hurt her. I'm saying she looks like a dead person.
[1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:51.920]  Hillary, they were so dumb they thought they could force feed her down our throats. That's coming up. Then I'm going to get to Albright ready to join Islam in the fight against America.
[1:39:51.920 --> 1:40:02.920]  You cannot make this stuff up. Old women don't look ugly to me if they're nice people, but Hillary and Albright don't look like humans.
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:13.920]  We show TV viewers a shot of this. She says that she's going to convert to Islam. What does she convert to looking like a monster out of some type of movie?
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:25.920]  And then her dad was a Nazi collaborator who helped round people up and she's got stolen Jewish art at her house. There's been 60 minutes pieces and then she bombed the Serbs that saved her when she was a kid and turned the country over to the Muslims.
[1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:31.920]  One third of it. I mean, she's just a horrible witch like demon.
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:43.920]  I was raised Catholic, became Episcopalian, and found out later my family was Jewish. Oh, I bet you found out later. That's how you worked with the Nazis. You were just like Soros. I stand ready to register as a Muslim in solidarity.
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:51.920]  I've been out there with the women's marches, folks. It's run by the Muslims. It's worse than I ever thought. It is a giant, horrible, evil covert plan.
[1:40:51.920 --> 1:41:05.920]  And I cannot believe that we're crazy enough to let it get to this point. The Muslims linked up with the Communist Chinese, linked up with the megabanks, linked up with Hollywood trying to bring us down and trying to destroy our good president,
[1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:16.920]  simply trying to empower us and get jobs and cut taxes who doesn't want war with Russia that's done nothing to us. It's so clear.
[1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:26.920]  Japan knows they're linked up with the U.S., Russia, and the U.S. right now, and the U.K. is trying to get off of the globalists. That's all we got. It's a new 21st century war, folks.
[1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:32.920]  Everybody's deciding which side they're on. Four years ago, they had a vote in Britain not to join the bombing with Obama.
[1:41:32.920 --> 1:41:40.920]  First time, England had said, no, it's World War I to fight with the U.S. or vice versa. This is before World War I.
[1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:51.920]  They said, no, we're not part of this, and now you see the Brexit, because globalism was all a huge trap to turn us over to hardcore authoritarianism run by the Communist Chinese.
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:59.920]  No, sir. No, no, no. It's not going to happen. And Ron Paul was on yesterday, and he's like, you know, we need to not have a war with China.
[1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:20.920]  I agree. But China is infiltrating us and buying up Hollywood and is out to destroy us as they've done their own people, and I'm not going to stand for it. It's outrageous to have those blood-drinking, bloodthirsty, murderous Communist Chinese Central Committee Politburo dirtbags meet with that vampire Zuckerberg last year 14 times on how to quote,
[1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:30.920]  censor American news. It's the Communist Chinese dug up the term fake news when they banned free speech in their own country.
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:39.920]  You want to know, they're the real inventors, not John Rappaport, who's coming up the next hour. They say, I need to plug. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:45.920]  This is just so surreal. It gives me a headache sometimes.
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:56.920]  Now, there's the headline. They just Google whatever I say. I didn't even see that article. The New York Times Facebook said to create censorship tool to get back into China. How sweet.
[1:42:56.920 --> 1:43:04.920]  And then, of course, use the tool against us as well this year, which they're now doing. Oh, how nice, Zuckerberg.
[1:43:04.920 --> 1:43:16.920]  And all these leftist trendies think it's cool. They're like, well, China's reasonable. It's no big deal. I mean, look at me and Spalding. We're just regular pals.
[1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:25.920]  But see, we put up with anything, so now we're under it. I'm going to go to Zach and Kevin and Daniel and James and Dave and Cindy and folks here in just a minute.
[1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:37.920]  And briefly, our amazing nerve regrowth factor over the top, total antioxidant, DNA force, just life changing product is 10% off.
[1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:44.920]  We had a small resupply back in, could be months until we get more, but it is 10% off right now. I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:48.920]  We really should try it. SupermobileVitality is also about to sell out.
[1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:57.920]  SupermobileVitality.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139. Also, SupermobileVitality is about to sell out as well.
[1:43:57.920 --> 1:44:06.920]  It could be weeks or maybe months until it comes back in because it's cold-pressed. It's really hard to get all of the organic things that go into it and then compound it.
[1:44:06.920 --> 1:44:12.920]  It has a 4.5 star rating by third party, major sites, 2,000 plus reviews.
[1:44:12.920 --> 1:44:19.920]  I had people stop me on the street and go, man, you're not kidding about Supermail. Yeah, no, libido, energy stamina, you name it. It is amazing.
[1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:23.920]  And some people forget to take it. You really should take it. It's changed my life.
[1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:27.920]  I've forgotten to take it for a few months and gain back some weight when working out is hard.
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:33.920]  And then during the month of December, when I normally gain weight, I took it religiously every day and lost, what was it, 12, 13 pounds.
[1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:40.920]  Now, I went on vacation for two weeks and gained about 10 pounds of it back, but that's just how it is when you're 43 and have a high stress life.
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:46.920]  The point is I work out less and in better shape than I was 10 years ago and Supermail and X2 are the reason.
[1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:52.920]  And so thank you so much, God, for putting us in touch with the scientists and others to develop the very best products out there.
[1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:56.920]  When we go to top developers, we say, what is your dream product?
[1:44:56.920 --> 1:45:03.920]  They say this would be it because other folks out there, most of them will sell you something for 50 bucks. It's got $3 a product in it.
[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:10.920]  We'll say something for 50 bucks has got $25 a product in it or $18 a product. We still have to advertise and pay for everything.
[1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:14.920]  And by the time we do it, we make like 10 bucks, you know, on a bottle or whatever to fund the operation.
[1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:18.920]  But the point is these are really high quality things.
[1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:23.920]  I mean, like our biome defense probiotics are the very best out there.
[1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:25.920]  Just check it all out for yourself.
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:29.920]  Biotrystallinium is back in knockouts back in to check it all out for yourself.
[1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:37.920]  Brain force, oxy powder and a liver shield, living defense, parasite cleanse, infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:49.920]  But who could make up a science fiction plot where the communist Chinese own the U.S. debt,
[1:45:49.920 --> 1:45:56.920]  have bought up almost all of Hollywood and are openly telling us what movies should come out and openly censoring Michael Savage's book coming out.
[1:45:56.920 --> 1:45:59.920]  And Michael Savage is banned from flying to England. That was crazy.
[1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:04.920]  And I'm just talking about him. He's a case point of persecution.
[1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:10.920]  And then they're going to come in and censor us even more and are openly at Davos saying we'll prop up world government.
[1:46:10.920 --> 1:46:14.920]  We'll teach America to get in line and Americans don't get more mad.
[1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:16.920]  And they call Trump radical.
[1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:19.920]  He should be telling China watch their fat mouths.
[1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:22.920]  He should be saying you're a bunch of mass murders or your own people.
[1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:26.920]  You're ashamed and your people ought to remove you from power.
[1:46:26.920 --> 1:46:28.920]  You're a sick joke.
[1:46:28.920 --> 1:46:30.920]  How dare you be involved with Hollywood?
[1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:35.920]  And what is Hollywood doing taking hundreds of millions of dollars per film to put out trash?
[1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:42.920]  What is the Transformers director putting a movie out where I'm a dictator and you overthrow the country?
[1:46:42.920 --> 1:46:47.920]  Just repudiate them and those studios will go bankrupt overnight.
[1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:52.920]  Good. Go ahead and buy all the studios up. We're going to bankrupt all of them dirt bags.
[1:46:52.920 --> 1:46:55.920]  You and all the old demon hunchbacks that run Hollywood.
[1:46:55.920 --> 1:46:57.920]  You're a bunch of satanic filth.
[1:46:57.920 --> 1:47:00.920]  A bunch of pedophiles. Go to hell.
[1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:03.920]  Rod in hell, filth. I see you.
[1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:05.920]  Excuse me.
[1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:09.920]  I mean, this is just outrageous. This is outrageous.
[1:47:09.920 --> 1:47:11.920]  I can't even believe it.
[1:47:11.920 --> 1:47:15.920]  We have a great writer that points this out, but it should be even more hardcore.
[1:47:15.920 --> 1:47:20.920]  I mean, this is just incredible. The Communist Chinese, we need to add in all these articles.
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:24.920]  And the writer does it, but we should just add some links where they're involved cheerleading,
[1:47:24.920 --> 1:47:30.920]  and quarterbacking, and haunchelling, and directing, and coaching, and captaining, and generaling,
[1:47:30.920 --> 1:47:35.920]  and deploying the whole drumbeat to shut down free speech in America.
[1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:40.920]  I mean, and you say the Russians are involved in America?
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:43.920]  I kind of wish they were.
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:49.920]  I mean, we're completely ganged up on here. This is insane.
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:52.920]  I didn't know we had a caller in Chile. I apologize.
[1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:55.920]  Next time somebody's calling from South America, let me know as they go to the headline.
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:47:58.920]  Then I'm going to go to Zach and others. I'm going to go quick now. I apologize.
[1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:02.920]  Dave and Chile, you're on the air.
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:03.920]  Hello there.
[1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:05.920]  Welcome. Go ahead.
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:13.920]  And I'm really, really happy that Mr. Trump is the president of the United States of America.
[1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:18.920]  I also want to say this. You know, we have Chile and TV down here, of course.
[1:48:18.920 --> 1:48:26.920]  The television station, Chile Vision, what was like, Chile Vision, is actually owned by TNT.
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:36.920]  And the kind of crap that comes out over the airwaves is incredible what they say about...
[1:48:36.920 --> 1:48:43.920]  No, that's right. It's the brainwashing, globalist, Hollywood, mainstream media combine worldwide is feeding everyone crap.
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:48.920]  They fall, their whole world government is over.
[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:58.920]  And it's not just that. I watch Cuban television a lot because it comes in free on the satellite for me.
[1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:07.920]  And I watch the Voice of America Jose Martí channel and they're even more rabid.
[1:49:07.920 --> 1:49:20.920]  It's like this government channel, a U.S. government channel sending television into Cuba is so anti-Trump. It's disgusting.
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:29.920]  Let's be clear. Let's be clear. U.S. captured U.S. globalist propaganda out of the U.S. is worse than the Cuban propaganda is what you're saying.
[1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:31.920]  Exactly. I mean, you know...
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:33.920]  I mean, folks, folks, folks, it's never been done.
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:40.920]  The communist, Chinese, biggest mass murders in the world have bought up Hollywood and are deploying every major movie running down America and freedom.
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:44.920]  I mean, this, and it's not for the foreign market. It's for America.
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:51.920]  It is the most outrageous horse manure the planet has ever seen. Anything else, Dave?
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:59.920]  Nothing else. You're a vanguard. You're the best.
[1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:05.920]  Oh, no, you're the vanguard. You're the vanguard. I love you. I appreciate your call. Your phone's breaking up. Your skype's breaking up or whatever it is, however you call in.
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:14.920]  Listen, you're the vanguard listeners. I can't get out of my car in a parking lot now and walk in the grocery store without getting stopped 10 times going in yesterday.
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:24.920]  I got stopped like 20 times inside. I got stopped. I mean, I think I'm going to start just showing people on the live feed.
[1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:31.920]  Almost like I was at the Trump inauguration. Everybody saw that every two feet. Every other person, even as a Chicago Tribune admitted, was a listener.
[1:50:31.920 --> 1:50:38.920]  It's like that all over the place now. But like every third or fourth person, I mean, I've got to wear a hat now and glasses if I'm going to hurry.
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:43.920]  Some will be rude and blow people off. I have to wear disguises now, okay? And I'm just one guy in this fight.
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:52.920]  So listen, if all of you just tell five people a day about the show, we'll triple the size and game over. We're so close to game over.
[1:50:52.920 --> 1:50:59.920]  And when you do arrest a bunch of people at that point, give them jury trials, but then put them in prison for treason and working with Communist China in sedition.
[1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:09.920]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food. Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good for 25 years, survival food on hand in case of an emergency.
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:18.920]  Well, right now, in what is truly an unprecedented move, 72-hour survival food kits are being given away to listeners while supplies last.
[1:51:18.920 --> 1:51:23.920]  Survival food is more important today than ever before, explains Frank Bates, a spokesman for the company.
[1:51:23.920 --> 1:51:29.920]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other threats can make obtaining sufficient food impossible in an emergency.
[1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:36.920]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food rated for 25 years of storage.
[1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:44.920]  It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping, and it's been rated four and a half out of five stars by customers who paid full price.
[1:51:44.920 --> 1:51:49.920]  But listeners who act quickly can get it free, just cover $9.95 shipping.
[1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:54.920]  Go to FreeFood2.com right now. Supplies are limited and the program may end at any time.
[1:51:54.920 --> 1:52:16.920]  Go to FreeFood2.com now. That's FreeFood2.com.

[1:54:16.920 --> 1:54:24.920]  I just cannot believe how surreal it is. The Communist Chinese who have mobile execution vans in every city,
[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:31.920]  who have total enslavement of their people, who are ruled by a bunch of corrupt evil generals.
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:37.920]  It's like a giant North Korea and they allow a few economic zones for wealthy Chinese to live decent lives,
[1:54:37.920 --> 1:54:42.920]  but the rest of the people over a billion live in absolute slavery.
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:51.920]  And if they catch you practicing Buddhism privately or even exercise like yoga, you are taken.
[1:54:51.920 --> 1:55:01.920]  Blood type kept in a prison and then your organs are sold to the highest bidder and the evil just goes on and on.
[1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:09.920]  And they're openly buying up Hollywood and they're openly going to put out anti-American films in America.
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:16.920]  I just, I almost just want to say to all the evil people that want to serve this, go ahead and destroy everything then.
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:20.920]  But you know what, there are a lot of good people in this country, a lot of children that don't deserve this.
[1:55:20.920 --> 1:55:24.920]  But man, crazy people screaming kill Trump in front of their students.
[1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:31.920]  As you hear the students freaking out in the background and Madonna and everybody and all these major newspapers saying somebody needs to kill Trump.
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:38.920]  I'm here to tell you people something. You're rubbing your mouths and you're going to get hurt. You understand?
[1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:43.920]  And you know what? I'm not running my mouth, okay?
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:51.920]  Look what we've done in 21 years to you in the information war.
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:56:03.920]  But I got to tell you, everybody has really gotten a normalcy bias, a learned helplessness where we just accept being crapped all over.
[1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:14.920]  And I'm sorry. Trump's great. He's strong. He's bringing back optimism. The approval rating is surging. It's wonderful.
[1:56:14.920 --> 1:56:19.920]  But he needs to come out against Communist China now.
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:28.920]  And I'm directing the crew. I rarely direct them. I'm directing the crew to focus on this and to take the lead that this writer has done.
[1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:35.920]  And I'm going to ask Watson and his brother and all the rest of our crew focus on Communist China because it really hit me today.
[1:56:35.920 --> 1:56:43.920]  This is an electronic cultural red dawn by the Communist Chinese who are at Davos admitting they're going to keep us in line.
[1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:47.920]  No, you're not. You are outrageous.
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:54.920]  Trump is absolutely right to be sending aircraft carriers. We need weapons systems on them and we need to kick them out of here.
[1:56:54.920 --> 1:56:59.920]  And no more Chinese anchor babies. I'm sick of it. I can't go to China and have a baby for free.
[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:04.920]  If I practice yoga at a park, they kill me.
[1:57:04.920 --> 1:57:13.920]  That's it. I almost smashed this microphone just to make my point. It's not normal to just Christ went in with the money changers and overturned the tables.
[1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:24.920]  I think I'm going to buy some brand new super awesome car and take a sledgehammer to it to sacrifice like $100,000 in front of everybody because all these people don't care about money.
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:30.920]  They'll go, oh, don't do it. I'm going to have a clock winding down to the death of the car.
[1:57:30.920 --> 1:57:37.920]  As your freedom dies, as everything else dies, as your whole culture dies, people only care about some stupid car.
[1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:43.920]  But of course, for $100,000, I'll get $10 million in publicity and actually warn people and save people.
[1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:48.920]  See, that's just a form of advertising because they're taking a wrecking ball to this country and have been doing it.
[1:57:48.920 --> 1:57:54.920]  And to you, you should take it personal. Everyone's been trained to be so self-centered and I'm going to Zach's call.
[1:57:54.920 --> 1:57:58.920]  They say, again, I don't care if they shut down coal power plants. I don't have any coal stock.
[1:57:58.920 --> 1:58:03.920]  That's the whole price of energy going up moron or I don't care if the stock market goes down.
[1:58:03.920 --> 1:58:07.920]  It's not the stock market. Almost every company that you depend on or your business works with is.
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:10.920]  So if it goes down, we're going to be in a frickin' depression.
[1:58:10.920 --> 1:58:15.920]  With half the public not working and brainwashed, everything's going to burn down.
[1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:17.920]  How does that sound to you?
[1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:22.920]  It's ridiculous.
[1:58:22.920 --> 1:58:26.920]  I'm ready to go to war with whoever wants to go to war right now.
[1:58:26.920 --> 1:58:29.920]  The Islamists, the chai comes.
[1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:32.920]  I pray to God you be brought love.
[1:58:32.920 --> 1:58:38.920]  I beg Christ and the Father that you murdering scum be destroyed.
[1:58:38.920 --> 1:58:40.920]  Hold me right back with your phone calls.
[1:58:40.920 --> 1:58:43.920]  You maggot murderers will get you no matter what.
[1:58:43.920 --> 1:59:03.920]  You murderers! You scumbag vampires! I see you!
[1:59:14.920 --> 1:59:17.920]  You say when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing for years,
[1:59:17.920 --> 1:59:20.920]  people that currently are testing for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:21.920]  What do they really say about them?
[1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:24.920]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[1:59:24.920 --> 1:59:27.920]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[1:59:27.920 --> 1:59:31.920]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[1:59:31.920 --> 1:59:33.920]  I mean, it's unbelievable. It's a quarter inch thick.
[1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:36.920]  It's got a 20 year warranty. It's waterproof. You can wear it. It's comfortable.
[1:59:36.920 --> 1:59:38.920]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it.
[1:59:38.920 --> 1:59:43.920]  Again, fund the info or get the game changing in nanotech tubes.
[1:59:43.920 --> 1:59:47.920]  It's a win-win. $200. Go check out all their different products.
[1:59:47.920 --> 1:59:49.920]  At InfoRestore.com, it's amazing.
[1:59:51.920 --> 1:59:55.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:55.920 --> 2:00:00.920]  I can feel the spirit rising.
[2:00:00.920 --> 2:00:05.920]  Waging War on Corruption.
[2:00:05.920 --> 2:00:30.920]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:38.920]  I've got to settle down a little bit.
[2:00:38.920 --> 2:00:41.920]  The Communist Chinese openly lecturing that there are bosses
[2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:48.920]  and openly buying up the globalist brainwashing system is just too much.
[2:00:48.920 --> 2:00:51.920]  I mean, this is incredible because I can tell you,
[2:00:51.920 --> 2:00:53.920]  most of Hollywood doesn't like what the globalists are doing
[2:00:53.920 --> 2:00:57.920]  when it's a major rebellion. Just talk to Chris Carter.
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:01:01.920]  And so they're bringing in the Chai Kong money to try to keep control.
[2:01:01.920 --> 2:01:03.920]  See, this is a desperation move,
[2:01:03.920 --> 2:01:05.920]  but it's going to blow up on their face big time.
[2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:09.920]  Because we're not going to just sit here idly by and watch the Communist Chinese take over.
[2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:11.920]  Let's go to Zach in Kentucky.
[2:01:11.920 --> 2:01:14.920]  Then we're going to go to Cindy and Kevin and James and John.
[2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:16.920]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:21.920]  Alex, Alex, I just want to thank you so much, obviously, for what you do.
[2:01:21.920 --> 2:01:23.920]  You talk about the Chinese here.
[2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:26.920]  Yeah, they're going to hold no dominion over us.
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:31.920]  I can say that for at least me and my brothers here in Louisville, Kentucky.
[2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:36.920]  Even my lady, my girlfriend, I just want to say Amber, I'm so lucky to have her.
[2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:38.920]  She's a truser.
[2:01:38.920 --> 2:01:41.920]  We wouldn't be the same people without you, man.
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:48.920]  Anyway, past all that, Trump, you've got the Chinese shaking in their boots, obviously.
[2:01:48.920 --> 2:01:50.920]  We see it through movies, through Hollywood.
[2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:52.920]  They try to control Hollywood now.
[2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:56.920]  I mean, look, it's illegal to have state-sponsored media and funding
[2:01:56.920 --> 2:01:59.920]  because everything in China is state-controlled taking over our media.
[2:01:59.920 --> 2:02:04.920]  It's a huge national security issue one trillion times bigger than what the Russians supposedly did.
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:09.920]  The Russians were laughing that they were claiming they were influencing our election.
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:11.920]  They're fighting the same people.
[2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:13.920]  It has nothing to do with Russia.
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:17.920]  I mean, again, they say that Russia told Trump to say crooked Hillary.
[2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:21.920]  This would be funny if it wasn't so dangerous.
[2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:28.920]  It is dangerous, you know, and, you know, Marines, we laugh in the face of danger a lot.
[2:02:28.920 --> 2:02:31.920]  But, you know, we take this very seriously.
[2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:32.920]  This is our freedom.
[2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:35.920]  Obviously, you take it seriously.
[2:02:35.920 --> 2:02:38.920]  You are the commandant of truth, in my opinion.
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:43.920]  You know, if we, the listeners of the vanguard, you are the commandant.
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:44.920]  You're the general.
[2:02:44.920 --> 2:02:48.920]  Well, let me tell you, the Marines and former Marines are the shock troops,
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:53.920]  the bravest, the guys they send in to death, doorstep, and through and beyond.
[2:02:53.920 --> 2:02:59.920]  And I admire the Army and all the special operations and the Navy's skills and incredibly dangerous stuff they do that takes unbelievable courage.
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:03.920]  But the Marines, I've noticed out there, out of any group, if you're a smaller group,
[2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:05.920]  are the most awake to the New World Order.
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:09.920]  The Army has more awake people, on average, because they've got more people.
[2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:12.920]  But the Marines really are being faithful to this country.
[2:03:12.920 --> 2:03:15.920]  I mean, I'm not just yelling and screaming as some act here.
[2:03:15.920 --> 2:03:20.920]  I'm literally reading these articles where the Communist Chinese brag they're taking us over.
[2:03:20.920 --> 2:03:22.920]  And it's just outrageous.
[2:03:22.920 --> 2:03:25.920]  I mean, it makes me mad that my fellow countrymen have sold out to this,
[2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:28.920]  and that, quite frankly, Trump's not doing enough.
[2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:32.920]  I understand he's got to get in, get in place first, but, and he's doing it.
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:33.920]  He's doing an incredible job.
[2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:39.920]  I just want to see him dropkick the Communist Chinese, who have been openly involved in the election,
[2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:42.920]  and just destroy this lie that Russia was involved.
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:46.920]  Not to defend that old story that was proving a fraud, P.P. Gate and all the rest of it,
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:48.920]  but because it's a clear and present danger.
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:51.920]  Trump must address the chai comms.
[2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:53.920]  Is there a bigger threat than the Muslims?
[2:03:53.920 --> 2:03:55.920]  Go ahead.
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:01.920]  The public just now, you know, do a total 180 from, you know, the early 2000s,
[2:04:01.920 --> 2:04:05.920]  let's say 90s, you know, we're so against sweatshops.
[2:04:05.920 --> 2:04:06.920]  We're so against slave labor.
[2:04:06.920 --> 2:04:09.920]  You get those, you know, Foxcom factories.
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:12.920]  Hopefully, you know, what is Foxcom's going to move back,
[2:04:12.920 --> 2:04:14.920]  but they've got the suicide net.
[2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:15.920]  That's just...
[2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:17.920]  Well, I mean, they'd be forced under Trump's regulations.
[2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:18.920]  It'll be like heaven.
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:19.920]  He'll cut him by 75%.
[2:04:19.920 --> 2:04:20.920]  It'll still be like heaven to them.
[2:04:20.920 --> 2:04:21.920]  You mean, we get lunch breaks?
[2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:22.920]  We only work eight hours?
[2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:24.920]  We can work overtime if we want and get double?
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:30.920]  Oh, we're going to get $20 an hour instead of 18 hours a day for like $2 a day?
[2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:31.920]  It's something else, Alex.
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:32.920]  You know what?
[2:04:32.920 --> 2:04:33.920]  You guys do such a great job.
[2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:35.920]  I don't want to take any more of your time.
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:36.920]  Just continue on with that.
[2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:40.920]  And, you know, I just want to give a shout out to anybody here in the Louisville, Kentucky area.
[2:04:40.920 --> 2:04:41.920]  Anything goes down.
[2:04:41.920 --> 2:04:42.920]  I got your six, okay?
[2:04:42.920 --> 2:04:43.920]  All right.
[2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:44.920]  God bless you, brother.
[2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:45.920]  We're going to come back.
[2:04:45.920 --> 2:04:46.920]  You can do a few more calls.
[2:04:46.920 --> 2:04:47.920]  I've got a guest come on about the economy.
[2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:53.920]  We've got some new clips of Don Lemon, an endless source of BS and lies and distortion and arrogance
[2:04:53.920 --> 2:04:57.920]  and almost no viewers, but still we have to expose these enemies.
[2:04:57.920 --> 2:04:59.920]  They are enemies, folks.
[2:04:59.920 --> 2:05:04.920]  Sanctuary cities across the nation are pushing back against President Trump's immigration policies.
[2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:07.920]  They're vowing to take it all the way to the courts.
[2:05:07.920 --> 2:05:11.920]  Bill de Blasio of New York is promising immediate action against Sanctuary City's order.
[2:05:11.920 --> 2:05:17.920]  As President Trump's executive order is said to block federal funding to sanctuary cities just like New York.
[2:05:17.920 --> 2:05:20.920]  De Blasio is saying that it's very susceptible to legal challenge
[2:05:20.920 --> 2:05:24.920]  and he's promising to take it to the court immediately for an injunction to stop the order
[2:05:24.920 --> 2:05:27.920]  if an attempt to pull funds from the city is made.
[2:05:27.920 --> 2:05:30.920]  He goes on to say, if they make an attempt to pull that money,
[2:05:30.920 --> 2:05:33.920]  it would be from the NYPD, from security funding to fighting terrorism.
[2:05:33.920 --> 2:05:35.920]  Of course, we know that simply isn't true.
[2:05:35.920 --> 2:05:38.920]  The president is trying to enforce the law of the land
[2:05:38.920 --> 2:05:43.920]  and say that these rogue cities have no right to get benefits to people that are here illegally.
[2:05:43.920 --> 2:05:47.920]  On Wednesday, Trump signed an order to stop federal funds from going to these cities
[2:05:47.920 --> 2:05:53.920]  from New York to San Francisco that have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agencies.
[2:05:53.920 --> 2:06:19.920]  I'm Margaret Howell reporting for InvilleWars.com.
[2:06:24.920 --> 2:06:28.920]  Poisoned with polonium, it breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more
[2:06:28.920 --> 2:06:31.920]  and it supports him and it supports InvilleWars our whole operation.
[2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:36.920]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not to the very top of the charts.
[2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:39.920]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing.
[2:06:39.920 --> 2:06:41.920]  They're in full crisis mode.
[2:06:41.920 --> 2:06:42.920]  National's movements are exploding.
[2:06:42.920 --> 2:06:44.920]  Everybody needs to go pre-order.
[2:06:44.920 --> 2:06:46.920]  So you get it first at InvilleWars.com.
[2:06:46.920 --> 2:06:49.920]  The making of a president by Roger Stone.
[2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:50.920]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:06:50.920 --> 2:06:53.920]  We're on our plane to go to the inaugural event with Trump.
[2:06:53.920 --> 2:06:56.920]  Pray for us and please continue to support the operation and get his book now.
[2:06:56.920 --> 2:06:58.920]  So you're the first to have a trip to you.
[2:06:58.920 --> 2:07:00.920]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:02.920]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[2:07:02.920 --> 2:07:05.920]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:11.920]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:17.920]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[2:07:17.920 --> 2:07:20.920]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[2:07:20.920 --> 2:07:25.920]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.
[2:07:25.920 --> 2:07:28.920]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[2:07:28.920 --> 2:07:33.920]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:36.920]  or avoid most toxic effects to themselves.
[2:07:36.920 --> 2:07:38.920]  The general public doesn't.
[2:07:38.920 --> 2:07:42.920]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:46.920]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[2:07:46.920 --> 2:07:53.920]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:07:53.920 --> 2:08:17.920]  That's why this system is so revolutionary today.
[2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:24.920]  Thanks, Jones.
[2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:53.920]  I'm trying to jumpstart the economy like cutting regulations, but he thinks it's a day late to dollar short,
[2:08:53.920 --> 2:08:55.920]  and this will be very hard to stop these trends.
[2:08:55.920 --> 2:08:57.920]  He tends to agree with Dent.
[2:08:57.920 --> 2:08:59.920]  That's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[2:08:59.920 --> 2:09:07.920]  That said, though, could major new technological developments that we know a lot of which have been suppressed
[2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:14.920]  as what they call disruptive technologies be rolled out quicker, things approve faster, drugs, you name it.
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:19.920]  Could that cause a new boom that we weren't expecting like so many other innovations have done?
[2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:24.920]  I'm an eternal optimist, but of course I've been being negative under Obama.
[2:09:24.920 --> 2:09:29.920]  All the socialism and big government saying things are negative, but I want to be an optimist.
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:32.920]  I want to be a cheerleader, and I think things are very positive.
[2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:34.920]  $2 trillion out of the stock market.
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:37.920]  So is that going to put a wrinkle in Mr. Dent's predictions?
[2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:41.920]  We're talking to him here in just a few minutes, but first off, before I hit a few of these calls very fast,
[2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:47.920]  Don Lemon on CNN is running around with The New York Times saying that there's no illegals voting.
[2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:49.920]  There's no dead people voting.
[2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:53.920]  Well, they've got Pew Research showing tens of millions, not three to five million like Trump says.
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:55.920]  So as usual, it's worse than Trump's saying.
[2:09:55.920 --> 2:09:57.920]  And let's put Bloomberg on screen.
[2:09:57.920 --> 2:10:04.920]  Also have Politico from last year saying illegal aliens are Hillary's secret weapon voting.
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:06.920]  Let's put that on screen.
[2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:09.920]  We just had it pulled up during the break because it's so important.
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:15.920]  Nico found it, guys, because there's all these articles where they say illegals are the secret weapon.
[2:10:15.920 --> 2:10:18.920]  You don't have to print them for me. Just punch them up.
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:19.920]  So yeah, there it is.
[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:23.920]  Illegal immigrants could elect Hillary Clinton, Politico.
[2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:27.920]  How noncitizens decrease Republican chances of winning the White House next year.
[2:10:27.920 --> 2:10:31.920]  So that's October 3rd.
[2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:32.920]  Okay, so that's what they do.
[2:10:32.920 --> 2:10:34.920]  That's what they admit.
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:36.920]  All of this is going on.
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:39.920]  Democrats are trying to pass laws so illegals can vote.
[2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:40.920]  They catch them.
[2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:41.920]  They catch them.
[2:10:41.920 --> 2:10:52.920]  But two to one, they catch just Democrats that are citizens with a list the Democrats give them of people that are dead but are on the voting rolls and then they go vote.
[2:10:52.920 --> 2:10:55.920]  I mean, the Mexican government said go vote in America.
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:10:57.920]  Everybody admits it's going on.
[2:10:57.920 --> 2:11:00.920]  But oh, Don Lemon and another arrogant New York Times guy.
[2:11:00.920 --> 2:11:02.920]  Oh, tell us about WMD's in Iraq.
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:04.920]  Tell us about Yellow Cake.
[2:11:04.920 --> 2:11:08.920]  Tell us about how Trump was never against the war when we've got six clips of him against the war.
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:12.920]  You're a pack of liars owned by a Mexican kingpin New York Times.
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:14.920]  Seeing in, you're about to be sold off.
[2:11:14.920 --> 2:11:16.920]  You have a couple hundred thousand viewers an hour.
[2:11:16.920 --> 2:11:19.920]  We have hundreds of thousands of viewers every 15 minutes.
[2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:22.920]  You know what the show has every 15 minutes now just on pressure radio?
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:24.920]  Half a million.
[2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:25.920]  Half a million.
[2:11:25.920 --> 2:11:26.920]  That's on rated stations.
[2:11:26.920 --> 2:11:28.920]  Not all our stations even subscribe to it.
[2:11:28.920 --> 2:11:32.920]  We have half a million every 15 minutes.
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:35.920]  The average bedtime is 23 minutes.
[2:11:35.920 --> 2:11:36.920]  You add it all up together.
[2:11:36.920 --> 2:11:39.920]  We have like four million listeners a day on terrestrial radio.
[2:11:39.920 --> 2:11:41.920]  You're a joke.
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:42.920]  You're a fraud.
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:43.920]  You're a scam.
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:44.920]  You're fake.
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:46.920]  Don't call us fake.
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:50.920]  You hope the communist Chinese bail out Hollywood in the MSM.
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:57.920]  And then they're so arrogant the Chinese order it to be the Chinese save America from Trump with Michael Bay directing it.
[2:11:57.920 --> 2:11:58.920]  Is that a joke?
[2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:00.920]  Please go ahead and put that in theaters.
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:03.920]  You're a laughing stock.
[2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:05.920]  I appreciate that holding.
[2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:06.920]  I got behind here.
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:07.920]  He's just gotten on the line.
[2:12:07.920 --> 2:12:11.920]  I'm going to hurry these calls because you've been holding for over an hour and then we're going to go to our guests.
[2:12:11.920 --> 2:12:15.920]  But here's the clip of Don Lemon that I just mentioned who thinks you're the biggest idiot in the galaxy.
[2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:17.920]  No, there's no illegals voting.
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:18.920]  Oh, no.
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:20.920]  Hillary didn't steal five states according to top experts.
[2:12:20.920 --> 2:12:23.920]  They didn't break into six states computers and get caught.
[2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:24.920]  You got caught.
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:26.920]  You got caught.
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:29.920]  There's a global realignment against world government.
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:32.920]  Nationalism is exploding something that predicted years ago.
[2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:33.920]  Here it is.
[2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:38.920]  I mean, I got, I think that in journalism, our role is not to be stenographers.
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:40.920]  Our role is to be watchdogs.
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:43.920]  And we have to provide that kind of accountability.
[2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:49.920]  And I think when a president or anybody else says something that is verifiably empirically false,
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:51.920]  then one has to call him out on it.
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:53.920]  Yeah.
[2:12:53.920 --> 2:12:54.920]  Here's another clip.
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:55.920]  Here's another clip.
[2:12:55.920 --> 2:13:00.920]  It's tough to call the president of the United States a liar because you want to respect the office.
[2:13:00.920 --> 2:13:08.920]  But I think it does a disservice to the American people and even to the president and even to, you know, journalists.
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:09.920]  Not to call.
[2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:10.920]  Call it what it is.
[2:13:10.920 --> 2:13:12.920]  And it is a lie.
[2:13:12.920 --> 2:13:20.920]  No, CNN and MSNBC and PBS and BBC showing the crowd gates being open,
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:26.920]  showing them pool for five minutes, then cutting when they left and saying that it never filled up when we have megapixels.
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:31.920]  So good or gigapixels, whatever those are called, that you can catch me in the crowd.
[2:13:31.920 --> 2:13:33.920]  People found that and everybody else.
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:35.920]  It was the biggest crowd ever.
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:38.920]  But no, he also threw Martin Luther King's bust out the window.
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:40.920]  You're the liar, Don Lemon.
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:43.920]  You're the fraud, bro.
[2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:45.920]  You're the fraud.
[2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:48.920]  Yeah, let's back it up and let's go back over a mile.
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:52.920]  And again, they had to fence it off because people were trying to get in and attack people.
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:54.920]  It goes on for miles and miles.
[2:13:54.920 --> 2:13:58.920]  And then we have photos behind the monument of the huge mass of crowds.
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:13:59.920]  What should I show you again?
[2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:04.920]  CNN, BBC showing it with no one there.
[2:14:04.920 --> 2:14:06.920]  Showing it at 822.
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:07.920]  I keep saying 830.
[2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:09.920]  822 in the morning, they opened the gates at 820.
[2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:11.920]  Two minutes in, people pour in.
[2:14:11.920 --> 2:14:13.920]  They go, oh, that's how it ended.
[2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:15.920]  That was the crowd for Trump.
[2:14:15.920 --> 2:14:18.920]  Good Lord.
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:20.920]  That's taken from the Washington Monument.
[2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:23.920]  We have the photos of it back to the monument and passed it.
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:24.920]  But still, they went on air.
[2:14:24.920 --> 2:14:28.920]  I saw CNN Tuesday night and said Trump was caught in another lie
[2:14:28.920 --> 2:14:31.920]  and that there was not a crowd and he should quit bitching.
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:34.920]  I'm going to ask Mr. Dent what he thinks is going on here
[2:14:34.920 --> 2:14:36.920]  because this is insane.
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:40.920]  It's almost like there's a plan of self-immolation from these people.
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:42.920]  Okay, let's go to these calls and I go to my guest.
[2:14:42.920 --> 2:14:47.920]  Let's talk to somebody hung up at the top in there for an hour.
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:50.920]  Let's see who's up next here.
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:53.920]  Let's talk to Cindy in Pennsylvania on the air.
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:55.920]  Go ahead.
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:14:57.920]  Hi, Alex.
[2:14:57.920 --> 2:15:00.920]  I want to thank you for encouraging us to get out there
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:03.920]  each and every one of us and do our own thing
[2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:06.920]  to fight this war against Ingsock.
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:11.920]  I write now on a site called allpoetry.com
[2:15:11.920 --> 2:15:14.920]  under the pen name Casparitis.
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:15.920]  Doing very well.
[2:15:15.920 --> 2:15:20.920]  I'm a patriotic poet and a lot of it comes from your shows.
[2:15:20.920 --> 2:15:22.920]  I've written about Trump, Hillary,
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:25.920]  and the hardest one I'm having trouble writing about is you.
[2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:27.920]  You're very hard to write about.
[2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:31.920]  But I'd like you to check that out at allpoetry.com.
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:32.920]  Beautiful. Everybody.
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:34.920]  The way to count them is put out art, put out love,
[2:15:34.920 --> 2:15:36.920]  put out true renaissance.
[2:15:36.920 --> 2:15:38.920]  That will defeat these people.
[2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:42.920]  And I would love to see President Trump
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:46.920]  get these Islamberg training camps out of here.
[2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:48.920]  Oh, yeah, they allow Muslim training camps.
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:49.920]  I've been to them.
[2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:50.920]  Our reporters have been to them.
[2:15:50.920 --> 2:15:51.920]  It's incredible. God bless you, ma'am.
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:52.920]  I appreciate your call.
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:53.920]  I got to move quick.
[2:15:53.920 --> 2:15:54.920]  Get to our guests in just a few minutes.
[2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:56.920]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Florida.
[2:15:56.920 --> 2:15:57.920]  You're on the air.
[2:15:57.920 --> 2:15:59.920]  Go ahead.
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:00.920]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:16:00.920 --> 2:16:01.920]  Just a quick point.
[2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:03.920]  Number one, I loved your transformers voice.
[2:16:03.920 --> 2:16:05.920]  It was amazing earlier.
[2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:09.920]  But I do think, unfortunately,
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:13.920]  there's going to be some sort of civil unrest
[2:16:13.920 --> 2:16:15.920]  because of what's going on.
[2:16:15.920 --> 2:16:18.920]  There's too many idiot, brainwashed,
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:21.920]  mental patient liberals out there.
[2:16:21.920 --> 2:16:23.920]  Openly calling for the death of Trump.
[2:16:23.920 --> 2:16:25.920]  They'll hit you and spit on you and say,
[2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:26.920]  love Trump's hate.
[2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:31.920]  I'm like, hey, you just slapped me in the face.
[2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:33.920]  It's not about peace anymore.
[2:16:33.920 --> 2:16:35.920]  They're taking the marching orders
[2:16:35.920 --> 2:16:38.920]  from their hypocritical Hollywood heroes
[2:16:38.920 --> 2:16:41.920]  like Madonna and Ashley Judd
[2:16:41.920 --> 2:16:44.920]  and Mr. Climate Control
[2:16:44.920 --> 2:16:46.920]  and global warming hypocritically
[2:16:46.920 --> 2:16:47.920]  in order to caprio.
[2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:50.920]  And you got Matt Damon talking about
[2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:51.920]  people shouldn't have guns,
[2:16:51.920 --> 2:16:53.920]  but his house is a fortress
[2:16:53.920 --> 2:16:54.920]  with armed security guards.
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:16:56.920]  They're total elitists.
[2:16:56.920 --> 2:16:58.920]  Let me tell you something.
[2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:00.920]  With Clooney, with him,
[2:17:00.920 --> 2:17:01.920]  it's all a big joke,
[2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:02.920]  except Sean Penn really believes it.
[2:17:02.920 --> 2:17:04.920]  With them, I know this for a fact.
[2:17:04.920 --> 2:17:06.920]  Behind the scenes, Brad Pitt,
[2:17:06.920 --> 2:17:07.920]  who isn't as bad as Brad Pitt,
[2:17:07.920 --> 2:17:10.920]  has actually told some truthful stuff.
[2:17:10.920 --> 2:17:12.920]  They all know it's a total fraud.
[2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:14.920]  They all listen to the show.
[2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:15.920]  I've met most of them
[2:17:15.920 --> 2:17:16.920]  and I mean like an exclusive party
[2:17:16.920 --> 2:17:17.920]  with like 20 people.
[2:17:17.920 --> 2:17:19.920]  And they are all scared to death
[2:17:19.920 --> 2:17:20.920]  of the big producers.
[2:17:20.920 --> 2:17:22.920]  They have secret meetings about the New World Order
[2:17:22.920 --> 2:17:23.920]  and a lot of them just say, screw it,
[2:17:23.920 --> 2:17:24.920]  I'm going with it.
[2:17:24.920 --> 2:17:26.920]  And they get hundreds of millions of dollars
[2:17:26.920 --> 2:17:28.920]  a year for doing it and it's disgusting.
[2:17:28.920 --> 2:17:31.920]  But Matt Damon, Affleck especially,
[2:17:31.920 --> 2:17:33.920]  they all know it's a complete joke.
[2:17:33.920 --> 2:17:35.920]  I mean, they all know it's a complete joke.
[2:17:38.920 --> 2:17:39.920]  I couldn't agree more.
[2:17:39.920 --> 2:17:42.920]  I actually have a cousin who's on the board
[2:17:42.920 --> 2:17:44.920]  of the Strain Actors Guild
[2:17:44.920 --> 2:17:46.920]  and you would have thought the world ended
[2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:49.920]  when Obama left office
[2:17:49.920 --> 2:17:51.920]  and that's just a type of mentally ill people
[2:17:51.920 --> 2:17:52.920]  that were killed.
[2:17:52.920 --> 2:17:53.920]  Well, there's a lot of folks like Chris Carter
[2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:54.920]  who's openly said he's a listener
[2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:55.920]  and thinks what I do is good,
[2:17:55.920 --> 2:17:57.920]  who says he does get pressured, you know,
[2:17:57.920 --> 2:17:59.920]  to say positive things about the libertarian movement
[2:17:59.920 --> 2:18:01.920]  and not cast as his racist.
[2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:02.920]  You know, he said that to Danny Farron
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:03.920]  and a bunch of other publications.
[2:18:03.920 --> 2:18:05.920]  So there's a major fight.
[2:18:05.920 --> 2:18:06.920]  I mean, it's come out.
[2:18:06.920 --> 2:18:09.920]  There are secret societies in LA of people,
[2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:10.920]  but they had to disband them.
[2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:13.920]  I've had top TV directors and HBO.
[2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:16.920]  I mean, I mean, guys that have made billions, okay?
[2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:18.920]  I mean, top guys.
[2:18:18.920 --> 2:18:19.920]  I'm talking about like six or seven
[2:18:19.920 --> 2:18:21.920]  of the top HBO shows ever.
[2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:24.920]  Major movies come here to this office repeatedly.
[2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:26.920]  I'm up bragging.
[2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:28.920]  I've had them, you name it and they go, no.
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:29.920]  Okay.
[2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:30.920]  Is this all off record?
[2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:31.920]  Let me tell you what's going on.
[2:18:31.920 --> 2:18:32.920]  And it's, I already know to the point,
[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:33.920]  there's no point.
[2:18:33.920 --> 2:18:34.920]  I've been to LA in years.
[2:18:34.920 --> 2:18:37.920]  I'm going next week to be on Joe Rogan's podcast
[2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:39.920]  because it reaches 20 million people a week.
[2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:41.920]  He's an old friend, but I mean, it's just a joke.
[2:18:41.920 --> 2:18:42.920]  But God bless you.
[2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:43.920]  I appreciate your call, Kevin.
[2:18:43.920 --> 2:18:44.920]  All right.
[2:18:44.920 --> 2:18:45.920]  To give our guests more time
[2:18:45.920 --> 2:18:46.920]  and to take calls later in the hour,
[2:18:46.920 --> 2:18:47.920]  I'm going to skip this break,
[2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:50.920]  but there is a total collapse of confidence in the system.
[2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:52.920]  There are a bunch of big corporations
[2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:55.920]  that want monopolies hoping that weaponized MSM
[2:18:55.920 --> 2:18:57.920]  and Hollywood garbage can suppress the public.
[2:18:57.920 --> 2:19:00.920]  The communist Chinese are openly at Devo saying,
[2:19:00.920 --> 2:19:02.920]  we'll keep Trump and America in line.
[2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:06.920]  Hollywood movies are now coming out where Trump is a terrorist
[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:08.920]  funded by the communist Chinese.
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:10.920]  That's on drudgereport.com today.
[2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:12.920]  This is so crazy.
[2:19:12.920 --> 2:19:14.920]  And they are completely freaking out.
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:18.920]  Now I know that Mr. Dent, Harry Dent of HarryDent.com,
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:20.920]  again, is a really smart fellow.
[2:19:20.920 --> 2:19:22.920]  I'm going to get into his whole background,
[2:19:22.920 --> 2:19:24.920]  his degrees and his best-selling books
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:26.920]  and all the work he's done at Bank capital and you name it.
[2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:28.920]  And his best-selling demographic, Cliff,
[2:19:28.920 --> 2:19:30.920]  which is accurately predicted, you know,
[2:19:30.920 --> 2:19:31.920]  that we have these downturns.
[2:19:31.920 --> 2:19:34.920]  My question to him is, can we turn this around?
[2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:37.920]  What does he make of what Trump's doing?
[2:19:37.920 --> 2:19:39.920]  What does he make of the moves he's making?
[2:19:39.920 --> 2:19:42.920]  But first off, since you've been holding for five minutes,
[2:19:42.920 --> 2:19:43.920]  listen to me rant, sir.
[2:19:43.920 --> 2:19:45.920]  You know, Happy New Year hadn't had you on
[2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:48.920]  since the year changed over.
[2:19:48.920 --> 2:19:49.920]  You've been hearing me rant.
[2:19:49.920 --> 2:19:51.920]  I mean, the Chinese are openly saying,
[2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:52.920]  they're going to come into America.
[2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:54.920]  They're going to teach us how to censor the press.
[2:19:54.920 --> 2:19:56.920]  That's in the Wall Street Journal.
[2:19:56.920 --> 2:19:58.920]  They report this with a straight face, like, oh, thank you,
[2:19:58.920 --> 2:20:00.920]  Chinese Communist murderers.
[2:20:00.920 --> 2:20:02.920]  It's like a Twilight Zone episode.
[2:20:02.920 --> 2:20:05.920]  As you've reported, we're in much better stead than they are.
[2:20:05.920 --> 2:20:07.920]  The world's acting like they're the leader.
[2:20:07.920 --> 2:20:09.920]  So, so now that Trump's president,
[2:20:09.920 --> 2:20:11.920]  just a cornucopia of ideas,
[2:20:11.920 --> 2:20:13.920]  what is your global approximation
[2:20:13.920 --> 2:20:15.920]  of the state of the planet right now?
[2:20:15.920 --> 2:20:17.920]  Well, well, number one,
[2:20:17.920 --> 2:20:19.920]  this is what it looked like back in the late 80s.
[2:20:19.920 --> 2:20:20.920]  Japan was the up-and-comer.
[2:20:20.920 --> 2:20:22.920]  Everybody thought they were going to surpass
[2:20:22.920 --> 2:20:24.920]  the United States and take over the world.
[2:20:24.920 --> 2:20:26.920]  And we said, no, Japan's going to have the greatest
[2:20:26.920 --> 2:20:28.920]  crash in history for the next decade.
[2:20:28.920 --> 2:20:30.920]  In the U.S. and Europe, we're going to do better
[2:20:30.920 --> 2:20:32.920]  than ever in the 1990s.
[2:20:32.920 --> 2:20:34.920]  So we're looking at demographics.
[2:20:34.920 --> 2:20:37.920]  We're looking at something that columns don't understand.
[2:20:37.920 --> 2:20:39.920]  And we have the same thing with China today.
[2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:43.920]  China workforce is the only emerging country in the world
[2:20:43.920 --> 2:20:46.920]  that already has a declining workforce.
[2:20:46.920 --> 2:20:49.920]  And it declines even faster, about eight years from now.
[2:20:49.920 --> 2:20:51.920]  And they end up looking more like Japan.
[2:20:51.920 --> 2:20:53.920]  So China's near the top of its game.
[2:20:53.920 --> 2:20:56.920]  China's also over-invested,
[2:20:56.920 --> 2:21:00.920]  over-expanded more than any country in history by a mile.
[2:21:00.920 --> 2:21:04.920]  They've got so many empty condos and houses
[2:21:04.920 --> 2:21:08.920]  and office buildings and malls and railways and everything.
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:13.920]  China has an most extreme debt rise in the last decade.
[2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:15.920]  China is getting ready to blow.
[2:21:15.920 --> 2:21:18.920]  China's not going to be telling anybody what to do.
[2:21:18.920 --> 2:21:20.920]  They're going to be cleaning up their mess
[2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:21.920]  in the next decade.
[2:21:21.920 --> 2:21:23.920]  And by the time they do,
[2:21:23.920 --> 2:21:26.920]  their demographics are going to be failing even faster.
[2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:27.920]  In fact, there's the headline,
[2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:29.920]  the world's most populous country, China is turning gray.
[2:21:29.920 --> 2:21:30.920]  Yeah.
[2:21:30.920 --> 2:21:33.920]  I mean, this was the case for Japan back then.
[2:21:33.920 --> 2:21:35.920]  And they're having a brain drain too, aren't they?
[2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:36.920]  Yeah. What's that?
[2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:37.920]  A brain drain.
[2:21:37.920 --> 2:21:38.920]  Yeah.
[2:21:38.920 --> 2:21:41.920]  I mean, well, people are the most affluent,
[2:21:41.920 --> 2:21:43.920]  richest people are leaving the country
[2:21:43.920 --> 2:21:46.920]  and are getting their cash out as fast as possible.
[2:21:46.920 --> 2:21:49.920]  They don't trust their top-down government.
[2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:51.920]  They don't trust this bubble.
[2:21:51.920 --> 2:21:55.920]  They've got the most expensive real estate in the world by far.
[2:21:55.920 --> 2:21:57.920]  Hong Kong makes Sydney, Australia,
[2:21:57.920 --> 2:22:00.920]  and London and San Francisco look cheap.
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:03.920]  So they've got a giant big, bad,
[2:22:03.920 --> 2:22:05.920]  bad ugly bubble, as Trump says.
[2:22:05.920 --> 2:22:08.920]  And it's the biggest bubble I've seen in history.
[2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:10.920]  This book, The Sale of a Lifetime,
[2:22:10.920 --> 2:22:12.920]  my new book that looks at every bubble in history,
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:14.920]  looks at all the bubbles around the world.
[2:22:14.920 --> 2:22:16.920]  They all look alike.
[2:22:16.920 --> 2:22:18.920]  They all grow exponentially.
[2:22:18.920 --> 2:22:20.920]  They all have a kind of an orgasmic final.
[2:22:20.920 --> 2:22:22.920]  And by the way, Trump agrees with you on real estate.
[2:22:22.920 --> 2:22:23.920]  He says it's overvalued.
[2:22:23.920 --> 2:22:25.920]  And he's saying, you know, no more subsidies.
[2:22:25.920 --> 2:22:27.920]  They're saying that's horrible.
[2:22:27.920 --> 2:22:29.920]  Isn't this what we need?
[2:22:29.920 --> 2:22:32.920]  The last thing we need, all of this quantitative easing
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:36.920]  and all these subsidies and tax-favored things like real estate,
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:38.920]  all they've done is create a bigger bubble
[2:22:38.920 --> 2:22:40.920]  that wouldn't have occurred anyway
[2:22:40.920 --> 2:22:43.920]  in what I call this fall bubble boom season
[2:22:43.920 --> 2:22:46.920]  on our 80-year long-term model for the economy.
[2:22:46.920 --> 2:22:48.920]  So what do you make of $2 trillion out of the stock market?
[2:22:48.920 --> 2:22:50.920]  What do you make of that?
[2:22:50.920 --> 2:22:52.920]  $2 trillion out of the stock market.
[2:22:52.920 --> 2:22:56.920]  I was thinking it was going to peak late last year
[2:22:56.920 --> 2:22:58.920]  until Trump came along.
[2:22:58.920 --> 2:23:00.920]  He beat the polls in one,
[2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:02.920]  and then he beat the markets who said
[2:23:02.920 --> 2:23:04.920]  he would be bad for the markets.
[2:23:04.920 --> 2:23:07.920]  It's either good, the market's gone straight up ever since.
[2:23:07.920 --> 2:23:10.920]  This to me is that final orgasmic rally.
[2:23:10.920 --> 2:23:12.920]  And in the third stock bubble,
[2:23:12.920 --> 2:23:14.920]  now we've had three stock bubbles in a row.
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:16.920]  What happened in history?
[2:23:16.920 --> 2:23:18.920]  Because it's so much stimulus from the government.
[2:23:18.920 --> 2:23:20.920]  Every time a bubble burst,
[2:23:20.920 --> 2:23:22.920]  instead of restructuring the debt and getting real
[2:23:22.920 --> 2:23:24.920]  and cutting costs and doing the type of things
[2:23:24.920 --> 2:23:26.920]  normal businesses and even governments in the past do,
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:28.920]  they just throw money in the economy
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:30.920]  and create more bubbles.
[2:23:30.920 --> 2:23:32.920]  A bunch of money comes from the economy.
[2:23:32.920 --> 2:23:34.920]  It's going to go chase real estate and stocks again.
[2:23:34.920 --> 2:23:36.920]  And now we have a bigger stock bubble by far than ever.
[2:23:36.920 --> 2:23:38.920]  Larger real estate bubbles in many cities
[2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:40.920]  and extreme around the world,
[2:23:40.920 --> 2:23:42.920]  especially in places like China,
[2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:44.920]  London, and Australia.
[2:23:44.920 --> 2:23:46.920]  And these bubbles are going to burst.
[2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:48.920]  That's all bubbles do.
[2:23:48.920 --> 2:23:50.920]  And they burst twice as fast as they build.
[2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:52.920]  That's one of the principles in this book.
[2:23:52.920 --> 2:23:54.920]  The second thing is, when they crash,
[2:23:54.920 --> 2:23:56.920]  half the crash will come
[2:23:56.920 --> 2:23:58.920]  in the first three months.
[2:23:58.920 --> 2:24:00.920]  When the smart money finally realizes this bubble's over,
[2:24:00.920 --> 2:24:02.920]  because they're playing it with leverage,
[2:24:02.920 --> 2:24:04.920]  they get out really quick.
[2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:06.920]  And we saw this in China last year.
[2:24:06.920 --> 2:24:08.920]  Their second stock bubble
[2:24:08.920 --> 2:24:10.920]  peaked and went down
[2:24:10.920 --> 2:24:12.920]  25% in three months.
[2:24:12.920 --> 2:24:14.920]  The 1929 bubble did that.
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:16.920]  And by the way, to your credit,
[2:24:16.920 --> 2:24:18.920]  you did predict a lot on the show
[2:24:18.920 --> 2:24:20.920]  six months a year out.
[2:24:20.920 --> 2:24:22.920]  China's the one to watch.
[2:24:22.920 --> 2:24:24.920]  They're the big bubble.
[2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:26.920]  And then some people were even saying,
[2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:28.920]  oh, I did somehow cause this.
[2:24:28.920 --> 2:24:30.920]  No, they wouldn't let stocks fall.
[2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:32.920]  Exactly.
[2:24:32.920 --> 2:24:34.920]  Well, the Chinese government's been buying
[2:24:34.920 --> 2:24:36.920]  their own stock market ever since.
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:38.920]  They will execute you in China
[2:24:38.920 --> 2:24:40.920]  and you're in trouble.
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:42.920]  So they're doing everything to prevent it,
[2:24:42.920 --> 2:24:44.920]  yet their market's going sideways
[2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:46.920]  now for almost a year.
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:48.920]  That's called a dead cat bounce,
[2:24:48.920 --> 2:24:50.920]  which means you've got another bubble burst
[2:24:50.920 --> 2:24:52.920]  coming in China.
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:54.920]  So sometime this year,
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:24:56.920]  a couple of things are going to happen.
[2:24:56.920 --> 2:24:58.920]  One is, first, more likely,
[2:24:58.920 --> 2:25:00.920]  or sooner, Italy has a huge debt crisis.
[2:25:00.920 --> 2:25:02.920]  It's close to default.
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:04.920]  Deutsche Bank is flaming out,
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:06.920]  as well as other Italian banks.
[2:25:06.920 --> 2:25:08.920]  It's going to be in the 1990s ahead of time.
[2:25:08.920 --> 2:25:10.920]  So we're going to have a blow-up
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:12.920]  in Germany and southern Europe.
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:14.920]  Second thing, at some point,
[2:25:14.920 --> 2:25:16.920]  and it may take longer because the Chinese
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:18.920]  do have so much power of their economy,
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:20.920]  the China bubble's going to blow.
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:22.920]  And that's going to be the death now.
[2:25:22.920 --> 2:25:24.920]  But I tell you something between now and then,
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:26.920]  Trump's got a big problem that he doesn't see.
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:28.920]  He says he's going to grow the economy
[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:30.920]  4% by cutting taxes and regulations.
[2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:32.920]  He doesn't understand a couple things.
[2:25:32.920 --> 2:25:34.920]  Demographics are terrible.
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:36.920]  The workforce is going to be
[2:25:36.920 --> 2:25:38.920]  negative growth, slightly negative growth,
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:40.920]  for decades to come,
[2:25:40.920 --> 2:25:42.920]  and more so in the next several years.
[2:25:42.920 --> 2:25:44.920]  And the only reason jobs have been growing
[2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:46.920]  is we've been hiring back
[2:25:46.920 --> 2:25:48.920]  the people we laid off in
[2:25:48.920 --> 2:25:50.920]  2008 and 2009 in the Great Recession.
[2:25:50.920 --> 2:25:52.920]  We haven't been growing the workforce.
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:54.920]  Businesses haven't been investing
[2:25:54.920 --> 2:25:56.920]  in new capacity.
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:25:58.920]  Baby boomers have been retiring.
[2:25:58.920 --> 2:26:00.920]  That makes less and less labor force participation.
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:02.920]  So a lot of these people that left,
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:04.920]  coming back in fact,
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:06.920]  we've gone from 67%
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:08.920]  when the baby boomers started to retire
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:10.920]  in this black line you can see.
[2:26:10.920 --> 2:26:12.920]  We're at 62.5 now.
[2:26:12.920 --> 2:26:14.920]  This says by 2024,
[2:26:14.920 --> 2:26:16.920]  we're going to go to 58%.
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:18.920]  We're going to lose another 4.5% of our workforce.
[2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:20.920]  How do you create growth
[2:26:20.920 --> 2:26:22.920]  in a shrinking workforce?
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:24.920]  Number two, another chart I have
[2:26:24.920 --> 2:26:26.920]  shows productivity.
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:28.920]  That's the only other way to grow.
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:30.920]  Let me stop you, Mr. Dent.
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:32.920]  We can find your best selling books there.
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:34.920]  We'll talk about those too.
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:36.920]  We'll come back for a break and take some calls
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:38.920]  that cover the waterfront.
[2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:40.920]  Look,
[2:26:40.920 --> 2:26:42.920]  you didn't believe or some people didn't believe
[2:26:42.920 --> 2:26:44.920]  Trump could win.
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:46.920]  He's beat a lot of odds. Innovation,
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:48.920]  as I said earlier, could change the paradigm.
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:50.920]  We're in a very advanced civilization now.
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:52.920]  I agree with you historically on the trends.
[2:26:52.920 --> 2:26:54.920]  You've been proven right. I hope you're wrong about this.
[2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:56.920]  All I'm saying is
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:26:58.920]  if we have super innovation,
[2:26:58.920 --> 2:27:00.920]  a lot of technology is released,
[2:27:00.920 --> 2:27:02.920]  a lot of construction is being done
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:04.920]  on highways and roads,
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:06.920]  if he can hustle a lot of factories to be built
[2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:08.920]  and jobs be created,
[2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:10.920]  there's a major hustle factor in humans.
[2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:12.920]  Even if the demographics aren't good,
[2:27:12.920 --> 2:27:14.920]  if you get those that are working,
[2:27:14.920 --> 2:27:16.920]  working even harder and producing more,
[2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:18.920]  couldn't that have an escape velocity
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:20.920]  out of this trend?
[2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:22.920]  We're already back at full employment,
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:24.920]  which means we've hired back
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:26.920]  all those people that wanted jobs.
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:28.920]  A lot of people left and won't come back.
[2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:30.920]  Why? Because a lot of two-earning couples
[2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:32.920]  when their kids get out of college,
[2:27:32.920 --> 2:27:34.920]  they say the wife stops working
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:36.920]  or works part-time.
[2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:38.920]  The baby boomers deserve to take it easy.
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:40.920]  The problem is if they do, we're going to implode.
[2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:42.920]  We're going to implode.
[2:27:42.920 --> 2:27:44.920]  So with zero productivity,
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:46.920]  old people don't get more productive.
[2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:48.920]  They get less productive.
[2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:50.920]  We're going to see productivity.
[2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:52.920]  It's now near zero.
[2:27:52.920 --> 2:27:54.920]  It's going to go even lower into 2024
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:27:56.920]  and so if we got workforce
[2:27:56.920 --> 2:27:58.920]  shrinking in the next several years
[2:27:58.920 --> 2:28:00.920]  and productivity going from near zero
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:02.920]  the lowest since the early 80s
[2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:04.920]  when the Bob Hope generation was retiring rapidly,
[2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:06.920]  how are you going to create 4% growth
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:08.920]  and companies aren't going to invest
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:10.920]  in new capacity because there is no demand?
[2:28:10.920 --> 2:28:12.920]  Sure. So the Republicans
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:14.920]  green-lighted bringing in immigrants who we need.
[2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:16.920]  The Democrats only want to bring people
[2:28:16.920 --> 2:28:18.920]  who want to be on welfare the worst type.
[2:28:18.920 --> 2:28:20.920]  So now we have an even bigger disaster.
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:22.920]  How do we get immigrants that we need?
[2:28:22.920 --> 2:28:24.920]  Well, that's what Australian Canada
[2:28:24.920 --> 2:28:26.920]  do. We should be studying them.
[2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:28.920]  They identify the skills they need.
[2:28:28.920 --> 2:28:30.920]  They make you meet requirements.
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:32.920]  And then we brain drain everybody.
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:34.920]  I don't care what color you are
[2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:36.920]  as long as you want to work hard.
[2:28:36.920 --> 2:28:38.920]  We let the lowest quality immigrants
[2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:40.920]  just come over the border.
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:42.920]  So we have the worst immigration policy
[2:28:42.920 --> 2:28:44.920]  even though we attract more than most countries
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:46.920]  and that's good for demographics
[2:28:46.920 --> 2:28:48.920]  but it's not as good as attracting
[2:28:48.920 --> 2:28:50.920]  when I speak in Australia
[2:28:50.920 --> 2:28:52.920]  where a third of the people there
[2:28:52.920 --> 2:28:54.920]  are Asian and those immigrants
[2:28:54.920 --> 2:28:56.920]  have higher than average
[2:28:56.920 --> 2:28:58.920]  educations and incomes, not lower.
[2:28:58.920 --> 2:29:00.920]  So they really
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:02.920]  are a plus for the country.
[2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:04.920]  They're getting the brain drain of the best.
[2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:06.920]  Yes, and again, here we attract
[2:29:06.920 --> 2:29:08.920]  people to our universities more than any country
[2:29:08.920 --> 2:29:10.920]  around the world and then we have quotas
[2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:12.920]  and push most of them back to the countries.
[2:29:12.920 --> 2:29:14.920]  I read an article where
[2:29:14.920 --> 2:29:16.920]  a guy was kicked out of Microsoft
[2:29:16.920 --> 2:29:18.920]  sent back to China and within two years
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:20.920]  he started a hundred million
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:22.920]  dollar business. No, exactly.
[2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:24.920]  Because it's an admitted globalist plan
[2:29:24.920 --> 2:29:26.920]  to not let America be dominant.
[2:29:26.920 --> 2:29:28.920]  We only take on people that basically
[2:29:28.920 --> 2:29:30.920]  are low skilled because it's all about
[2:29:30.920 --> 2:29:32.920]  a control system. It's incredible.
[2:29:32.920 --> 2:29:34.920]  Harry Dent is hard to disagree with.
[2:29:34.920 --> 2:29:36.920]  I'm going to come back and play with Ron Paul yesterday
[2:29:36.920 --> 2:29:38.920]  basically agreeing with him and see
[2:29:38.920 --> 2:29:40.920]  where he goes from there and then also take your phone calls
[2:29:40.920 --> 2:29:42.920]  from around the world. So Mike,
[2:29:42.920 --> 2:29:44.920]  Kirk, James,
[2:29:44.920 --> 2:29:46.920]  Josie and John and others
[2:29:46.920 --> 2:29:48.920]  stay with us. We'll be back.
[2:29:48.920 --> 2:29:50.920]  We're on the march.
[2:29:50.920 --> 2:29:52.920]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:52.920 --> 2:29:54.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN
[2:29:54.920 --> 2:29:56.920]  Radio Network.
[2:29:58.920 --> 2:30:00.920]  Well, this administration
[2:30:00.920 --> 2:30:02.920]  thinks that the American public has a right to know
[2:30:02.920 --> 2:30:04.920]  what's happening in cities across the country
[2:30:04.920 --> 2:30:06.920]  and it looks like the Trump administration
[2:30:06.920 --> 2:30:08.920]  is going to publish weekly crimes
[2:30:08.920 --> 2:30:10.920]  committed by illegal aliens,
[2:30:10.920 --> 2:30:12.920]  sidestepping the mainstream media's coverage
[2:30:12.920 --> 2:30:14.920]  of the immigration crime way. We have an article
[2:30:14.920 --> 2:30:16.920]  that's up on our website that aggregated
[2:30:16.920 --> 2:30:18.920]  from Breitbart News and it talks about how
[2:30:18.920 --> 2:30:20.920]  this administration is going to publish
[2:30:20.920 --> 2:30:22.920]  a list of crimes committed by illegals
[2:30:22.920 --> 2:30:24.920]  in sanctuary cities weekly
[2:30:24.920 --> 2:30:26.920]  according to an executive order release.
[2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:28.920]  Now, this order says, quote,
[2:30:28.920 --> 2:30:30.920]  to better inform the public regarding public
[2:30:30.920 --> 2:30:32.920]  safety threats associated with sanctuary
[2:30:32.920 --> 2:30:34.920]  jurisdictions, the secretary shall
[2:30:34.920 --> 2:30:36.920]  utilize the declined attainer
[2:30:36.920 --> 2:30:38.920]  outcome report or its equivalent
[2:30:38.920 --> 2:30:40.920]  and on a weekly basis make public a
[2:30:40.920 --> 2:30:42.920]  comprehensive list of criminal actions
[2:30:42.920 --> 2:30:44.920]  committed by aliens and any jurisdiction
[2:30:44.920 --> 2:30:46.920]  that ignores or otherwise
[2:30:46.920 --> 2:30:48.920]  fail to honor any detainers
[2:30:48.920 --> 2:30:50.920]  with respect to such aliens.
[2:30:50.920 --> 2:30:52.920]  It looks like this administration is saying
[2:30:52.920 --> 2:30:54.920]  to these sanctuary cities, you deport
[2:30:54.920 --> 2:30:56.920]  or we're going to publish what's actually going on.
[2:30:56.920 --> 2:31:24.920]  For more information on Breitbart News,
[2:31:24.920 --> 2:31:26.920]  be sure to check out Breitbart News.
[2:31:54.920 --> 2:31:58.920]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:31:58.920 --> 2:32:00.920]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money
[2:32:00.920 --> 2:32:02.920]  on one of the best new off the grid products
[2:32:02.920 --> 2:32:04.920]  of 2017 and seriously,
[2:32:04.920 --> 2:32:06.920]  I really think everyone should have one of these.
[2:32:06.920 --> 2:32:08.920]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system
[2:32:08.920 --> 2:32:10.920]  from our friends at Solutions from Science,
[2:32:10.920 --> 2:32:12.920]  one of our oldest sponsors.
[2:32:12.920 --> 2:32:14.920]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket
[2:32:14.920 --> 2:32:16.920]  but so powerful you can run some
[2:32:16.920 --> 2:32:18.920]  110 appliances at your house
[2:32:18.920 --> 2:32:20.920]  like a small refrigerator so you can
[2:32:20.920 --> 2:32:22.920]  keep food from spoiling.
[2:32:22.920 --> 2:32:24.920]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars,
[2:32:24.920 --> 2:32:26.920]  trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment,
[2:32:26.920 --> 2:32:28.920]  even airplanes.
[2:32:28.920 --> 2:32:30.920]  The system provides an endless supply
[2:32:30.920 --> 2:32:32.920]  of off the grid electricity,
[2:32:32.920 --> 2:32:34.920]  allowing you to create your own private power grid
[2:32:34.920 --> 2:32:36.920]  literally anywhere in the world.
[2:32:36.920 --> 2:32:38.920]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations,
[2:32:38.920 --> 2:32:40.920]  any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[2:32:40.920 --> 2:32:42.920]  Go to privatepowergrid.com
[2:32:42.920 --> 2:32:44.920]  to watch this thing in action.
[2:32:44.920 --> 2:32:46.920]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[2:32:46.920 --> 2:32:48.920]  Even better, use coupon code

[2:32:50.920 --> 2:32:52.920]  PPX energy unit for free.

[3:24:08.920 --> 3:24:12.920]  John Rappaport back here in the fourth hour, Infowars.
[3:24:12.920 --> 3:24:26.920]  Before I get into RFK Junior here, I just want to let all of you know an emergency shipment of DNA force is back at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:24:26.920 --> 3:24:42.920]  It is now back, but limited quantities, so get over there to InfowarsLife.com because it could be months before a larger shipment of DNA force arrives.
[3:24:42.920 --> 3:24:56.920]  Patented ingredients, BiOPQQ, systemic enzymes, 175 clinical studies on BiOPQQ. That's what's backing this up.
[3:24:56.920 --> 3:25:12.920]  It's very expensive to produce. An emergency shipment has arrived of DNA force at InfowarsLife.com. Go there, make your body great again, and support Infowars.
[3:25:12.920 --> 3:25:36.920]  OK, RFK Junior, Robert F. Kennedy Junior, he is purported, let's see the green light here from President Trump, to be the guy who is going to investigate on behalf of the federal government executive branch vaccine safety.
[3:25:36.920 --> 3:25:51.920]  Now, I never thought in my lifetime that I would ever say those words, and if you've been paying attention, neither should you, because this is unprecedented.
[3:25:51.920 --> 3:26:07.920]  The president of the United States meets with Robert F. Kennedy Junior at Trump Tower. Kennedy comes out and says, OK, I'm going to do an investigation on behalf of the administration into vaccine safety.
[3:26:07.920 --> 3:26:26.920]  I'm going to take on the CDC because I know all about the CDC, and RFK does know, Junior, does know everything he needs to know right now, right now.
[3:26:26.920 --> 3:26:45.920]  You can imagine what he might uncover with subpoena power, perhaps. He knows right now that there is an incredible conflict of interest at the CDC that is structural, that has existed forever, and it boils down to this.
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:27:10.920]  The CDC is a profit-making company. They buy and sell gigantic amounts of vaccines. 50% of the vaccines in America for children come from the CDC, but at the same time, they are the agency required to do so-called scientific studies assessing the safety and efficacy of vaccines.
[3:27:10.920 --> 3:27:32.920]  That's called a conflict of interest, my friends, and RFK Junior can document the men and women who sit on those committees, sit on those committees at the CDC, and make assessments about what vaccines your children must have, what new vaccines are coming on to the market.
[3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:44.920]  The safety of these vaccines, while they take money, significant money from pharmaceutical companies, and this has never been challenged at the CDC.
[3:27:44.920 --> 3:28:01.920]  The CDC is a rogue federal agency and a profit-making company at the same time, and they deserve to be completely plowed under legally after an investigation and completely reformulated from the ground up.
[3:28:01.920 --> 3:28:25.920]  RFK Junior can do that if he is given the leeway. He knows enough right now. He knows enough right now. This would be staggering, and I speak to somebody that's been working as a reporter for 34 years now and has been investigating vaccines for the last 28, 30 years.
[3:28:25.920 --> 3:28:49.920]  To have this happen would be staggering on many fronts, not only medical. It would alert the public yet again on a higher level that they have been bamboozled and committed crimes against them by institutions of government for a long, long, long time.
[3:28:49.920 --> 3:29:07.920]  And that major media science is fake science right down to the ground. That's what this investigation would do. So in any way that we can support this happening under the executive branch and Trump's guidance with RFK Junior in the lead,
[3:29:07.920 --> 3:29:25.920]  it's absolutely necessary that we strike back with the truth at major media who are already gathering their forces to declaim this as some horrible thing that's going to kill all of our children and all of the fake news and horrific lies they tell.
[3:29:25.920 --> 3:29:48.920]  We'll be back after the break here on Infowars.
[3:29:56.920 --> 3:30:09.920]  Well, this administration thinks that the American public has a right to know what's happening in cities across the country, and it looks like the Trump administration is going to publish weekly crimes committed by illegal aliens,
[3:30:09.920 --> 3:30:26.920]  sidestepping the mainstream media's coverage of the immigration crime wave. We have an article that's up on our website that aggregated from Breitbart News, and it talks about how this administration is going to publish a list of crimes committed by illegals in sanctuary cities weekly according to an executive order release.
[3:30:26.920 --> 3:30:42.920]  Now, this order says, quote, to better inform the public regarding public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions. The secretary shall utilize the declined detainer outcome report or its equivalent and on a weekly basis make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions
[3:30:42.920 --> 3:30:56.920]  committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignores or otherwise fail to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens. It looks like this administration is saying to these sanctuary cities, you deport or we're going to publish what's actually going on.
[3:30:56.920 --> 3:31:20.920]  I'm Howard Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[3:31:26.920 --> 3:31:49.920]  I'm Howard Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[3:31:49.920 --> 3:31:58.920]  So many people calling to my radio show and tell me how young Jebedee and the products at InfowarsTeam.com have changed their lives. Check it out for yourself today.
[3:32:20.920 --> 3:32:31.920]  This is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium. It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more and it supports him and it supports Infowars our whole operation.
[3:32:31.920 --> 3:32:49.920]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area if not to the very top of the charts. Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing. They're in full crisis mode. National movements are exploding. Everybody needs to go pre-order so you get it first.
[3:32:49.920 --> 3:33:13.920]  Alex Jones have gone on their plane to go to the inaugural event with Trump. Pray for us and please continue to support the operation and get his bookmaster the first to have it shipped to you.
[3:33:13.920 --> 3:33:24.920]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:24.920 --> 3:33:40.920]  John Rappaport here in the fourth hour sitting in for Alex at Infowars. We're talking about developments, developments. I was talking about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and an investigation of vaccines.
[3:33:40.920 --> 3:33:55.920]  If this moves forward, this will revolutionize the country. I guarantee it. If it moves forward without hindrance, vaccine safety as a myth will be exposed completely.
[3:33:55.920 --> 3:34:13.920]  Guarantee it. This will happen. People will understand how they have been lied to, criminally lied to by the CDC and other public health agencies, how these vaccines get onto the market, the toxic ingredients that they contain.
[3:34:13.920 --> 3:34:28.920]  Talking about not just mercury either. The profit making venture at the CDC that operates both as a corporation and as a public health agency in the executive branch of the federal government.
[3:34:28.920 --> 3:34:50.920]  All of this will come out and the major media will go completely insane. Completely insane. Guaranteed. So we hope that this is in the cards and that it's going to happen.
[3:34:50.920 --> 3:35:16.920]  Now, why are the major media going so crazy right now? I mean, we had the business of ABC airing a promo about a fiction series, a show where a president was shot during a break in the Trump interview.
[3:35:16.920 --> 3:35:30.920]  Wow. We've had reporters sitting around, major reporters sitting around joking about assassinating Trump, shooting Trump, murdering Trump.
[3:35:30.920 --> 3:35:46.920]  Just imagine. Well, can you even imagine if Hillary Clinton had won and the shoe was on the other foot? Reporters on television, mainstream reporters sitting around joking about killing Hillary.
[3:35:46.920 --> 3:36:02.920]  How do you think this would have flown? But not a problem here. Do you see the New York Times, the Washington Post, any of the major networks anywhere in the world taking these stories?
[3:36:02.920 --> 3:36:20.920]  And there are several, handful at least, where you've got mainstream reporters joking about murdering Trump and making that into a page one story and pounding on it day after day.
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:34.920]  As an example of how far the left has gone and is willing to go in their efforts to, you can't even call it delegitimized because they're talking about assassination.
[3:36:34.920 --> 3:36:48.920]  That's what they are talking about in, you know, frivolous terms. And, you know, just, and by frivolous, I mean casual, like, yeah, what would happen if, you know, somebody just shot the president?
[3:36:48.920 --> 3:37:11.920]  There is. This is how far major media are going. Because not only is their own survival at stake and they know they're losing to independent media, losing by miles now to independent media, but the entire globalist agenda is cracking and falling apart.
[3:37:11.920 --> 3:37:27.920]  And what is that agenda? What are we talking about? We are talking about the replacement of sovereign nations with a new economic and political order that is international, a global management system for the entire planet.
[3:37:27.920 --> 3:37:44.920]  That agenda is being exposed over and over again, as it has been for some time, tremendously accelerated by Trump. And here it is. This must not happen, but it is happening.
[3:37:44.920 --> 3:38:02.920]  The entire mandate of major media was to keep this under wraps and never expose it, never let it see the light of day that this takeover, in this case of America and other countries, has been proceeding apace for a very long time.
[3:38:02.920 --> 3:38:16.920]  You can go back as far as you want to go in our history, you can go back to 1913, you can go back to 1945, these are key years, but it's been kept a secret and now the secret is blown completely.
[3:38:16.920 --> 3:38:29.920]  The covert op is blown, and major media are going insane because it's their mandate to cover this up. That's what's happening.
[3:38:29.920 --> 3:38:46.920]  And when people go insane, there is no predicting what they will do or say, they will say anything to try to escape from what they consider to be living death for themselves, for themselves. That's what will happen.
[3:38:46.920 --> 3:39:05.920]  Let me just remind you about the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative. It isn't only making America great again, it's the people, the individuals, the health. This is what's happening at Infowars.
[3:39:05.920 --> 3:39:13.920]  And it all goes along with what I've been talking about, about the takedown of globalism and the reassertion of the individual again.
[3:39:13.920 --> 3:39:22.920]  So there are many products that are involved here in this initiative at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:39:22.920 --> 3:39:45.920]  Brain force, 30% off, super male vitality, 30 off, secret 12, 20% off, liver shield, 20% off, survival shield X2, 30% off, knockout, 20% off, prostagard, 20% off. All of these products and many others at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:39:45.920 --> 3:40:10.920]  Taking back your health, making your body great, again the 2017 Infowars initiative and helping Infowars to continue its work in this winning a battle that we are in against globalism and for freedom.
[3:40:10.920 --> 3:40:21.920]  Another reason that the major media have gone so crazy is because they cannot permit a discussion of what it means to be talking about America.
[3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:42.920]  America as a nation, not as an independent to take so village cheese glob collectivist world, which has been the incessant rattle of the media in one way or another in politicians for as long back as we can remember.
[3:40:42.920 --> 3:41:00.920]  No, not that. Just talking about America as a distinct independent existing nation with a history with a tradition that goes back to the formation of a republic, what that means, what the documents mean and so forth.
[3:41:00.920 --> 3:41:14.920]  That discussion must never take place as far as major media are concerned and people must never again become aware that America is its own nation.
[3:41:14.920 --> 3:41:33.920]  They hoped that day was long past. It would never return. But guess what? It's back. It's back again. It's happening. It's coming to the fore. This is a shock to the system. I mean an incredible shock to the system.
[3:41:33.920 --> 3:41:57.920]  Look how far ABC again has gone. This is the footage pronouncement from the Pope of news, I guess you could say, the papacy of news saying that the Trump interview that took place just took place first major media sit down with, you know, a network.
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:42:14.920]  Suddenly, ABC owns all of this and has placed restrictions on how you can show little clips and so forth. But the big restriction is after February 1st, it's gone forever. Nobody else can air it.
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:36.920]  Why? The president of the United States makes statements, policy statements, and this is all going to disappear down the rat hole of ABC on February 1st. Are they serious about this? Do they really think this is going to happen?
[3:42:36.920 --> 3:42:48.920]  Do they really think they can control this? And as Alex has said, why do they want to control it? Because they don't want other people being able to go back and say, look at what he said back here.
[3:42:48.920 --> 3:42:57.920]  Look at what Trump said and look at what he did. Gee, he said this and he did it. He said that and he did it. He said this and he did it.
[3:42:57.920 --> 3:43:19.920]  They want to be able to, it's 1984. It was here and then it wasn't here. That's what media in 1984 or Wells' Novel is all about. The media says this and then it's gone. The media says that, it's gone.
[3:43:19.920 --> 3:43:28.920]  Today, the media say this and it's gone. So they want to just completely destroy all that footage. We own it, they say.
[3:43:28.920 --> 3:43:40.920]  Now, if Trump had known that, I think the chances are about 90% against that he would have ever been interviewed by ABC. So now they've exposed themselves in a completely absurd way.
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:51.920]  It's like watching people, oh, you know, you've seen people that have gone nuts.
[3:43:51.920 --> 3:44:03.920]  Well, that's what we're watching here with major media. That's what we're seeing. That's why 15 years ago, I started the website under the name No More Fake News.
[3:44:03.920 --> 3:44:11.920]  Because it had already occurred to me in more than one way that major media were completely fake.
[3:44:11.920 --> 3:44:25.920]  Three areas, I would say, turned the tide for me before I started the website. The Oklahoma City bombing, 1995. The truth that emerged about that.
[3:44:25.920 --> 3:44:37.920]  The book I wrote about it and the terrific researcher, Patrick Briley, that I worked with as a source for a long time during the writing of the book.
[3:44:37.920 --> 3:44:44.920]  Vaccine research, that was part of my first book, AIDS Inc. 1988.
[3:44:44.920 --> 3:44:48.920]  Immune system destruction through vaccines.
[3:44:48.920 --> 3:44:58.920]  And the third thing, without going into a long song and dance, was U.S. government mind control experiments on children.
[3:44:58.920 --> 3:45:12.920]  And the testimony of Valerie Wolf, a psychologist, before a federal commission in 1995 on radiation experiments in which she and two of her patients said yes, or two of the patients said yes.
[3:45:12.920 --> 3:45:25.920]  As children, we received radiation doses, but this was part of a much wider-ranging mind control program that we were enlisted in as children.
[3:45:25.920 --> 3:45:32.920]  The feds never expected that to come out in live testimony, but it did.
[3:45:32.920 --> 3:45:48.920]  So those are just three of the areas that convinced me by the time that I started my website in 2001 that no more fake news was a good name, because the major media, of course, weren't covering any of these areas that I just mentioned.
[3:45:48.920 --> 3:45:53.920]  Not only weren't they covering them, they were obviously censoring them.
[3:45:53.920 --> 3:46:02.920]  If major media omit a story and they don't cover it, this is not an accident.
[3:46:02.920 --> 3:46:08.920]  They decide this is not good. We don't want this.
[3:46:08.920 --> 3:46:16.920]  And from many of my conversations off the record with reporters over the years, this is what they've told me.
[3:46:16.920 --> 3:46:19.920]  We know, they say, what the boundaries are.
[3:46:19.920 --> 3:46:22.920]  We understand what we can do and what we can't do.
[3:46:22.920 --> 3:46:27.920]  There is no discussion about this except in extreme rare cases.
[3:46:27.920 --> 3:46:32.920]  Otherwise, it's business as usual. It's a machine.
[3:46:32.920 --> 3:46:48.920]  For example, vaccine articles in which there is some criticism implied of the safety of vaccines or the criticism of the CDC or a pharmaceutical company, that'll get you fired if blacklisted.
[3:46:48.920 --> 3:46:52.920]  No question about it. But everybody knows that.
[3:46:52.920 --> 3:47:00.920]  So the editor doesn't have to say anything. The publisher doesn't have to say anything. The reporters don't say anything.
[3:47:00.920 --> 3:47:07.920]  It's all now understood. This is the game. Do you want to play?
[3:47:07.920 --> 3:47:18.920]  You've spent your career climbing over other people, trying to make a living, trying to make a name for yourself, maybe getting a little plastic surgery along the way, whatever it takes.
[3:47:18.920 --> 3:47:21.920]  You're a hustler. We know that.
[3:47:21.920 --> 3:47:30.920]  Now, you're going to destroy all that by crossing one of these lines and deciding that you want to take a chance.
[3:47:30.920 --> 3:47:43.920]  You want to be honorable. You want to expose the truth to the American people as you thought you wanted to do when you were 16 and you decided you wanted to be a reporter.
[3:47:43.920 --> 3:47:48.920]  Of course not. We understand that. That's not going to happen.
[3:47:48.920 --> 3:47:52.920]  This is the game, folks. This is the way it works.
[3:47:52.920 --> 3:48:01.920]  On the ground, every day, in the television networks, in the print media, this is the way it happens.
[3:48:01.920 --> 3:48:10.920]  And so some of these people brainwash themselves into believing all the lies that they promulgate to the public.
[3:48:10.920 --> 3:48:21.920]  And some of the others know they're lying, but for the sake of their careers and selling their souls and so forth, they just do it anyway.
[3:48:21.920 --> 3:48:25.920]  That's the way the game works. That's the way it operates.
[3:48:25.920 --> 3:48:39.920]  That's what we are destroying, day by day, broadcast by broadcast, article by article, independent news and media.
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:42.920]  So we've just flashed a piece up here from my blog.
[3:48:42.920 --> 3:48:48.920]  Reporters tell me the truth off the record, the fake news business. You should read it because these comments are incredible.
[3:48:48.920 --> 3:48:59.920]  What some of these guys have told me off the record over the years, like most people in the major media news business are CIA assets.
[3:48:59.920 --> 3:49:09.920]  Many of them don't know it. Some of them do. It's simple, you see.
[3:49:09.920 --> 3:49:14.920]  Here's a quote from myself that I'm now reading off the screen. I'm glad they put it up there.
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:21.920]  One night I had a little heart to heart with my editor. I told him it would be a lot easier if I just had a desk at the CIA and Langley.
[3:49:21.920 --> 3:49:27.920]  He agreed. He said we could move the whole paper there, but then the Spooks would realize they didn't need us at all.
[3:49:27.920 --> 3:49:33.920]  They could put out the paper themselves. That's right. They could put out the paper themselves.
[3:49:33.920 --> 3:49:39.920]  They could very well do that without having to have, you know, a building in New York.
[3:49:39.920 --> 3:49:47.920]  They could just do it all at Langley. Absolutely. It's that controlled.
[3:49:47.920 --> 3:49:55.920]  But the people inside it don't need to be controlled anymore.
[3:49:55.920 --> 3:50:02.920]  They're playing along. And their job is to convince the public that they're not playing along.
[3:50:02.920 --> 3:50:12.920]  That they're determined and idealistic and, in some cases, absolutely revolted at what's happening and they have to expose it in all of this.
[3:50:12.920 --> 3:50:20.920]  This is their act to be able to put on that act and convince the American people of it.
[3:50:20.920 --> 3:50:26.920]  But frankly, between you and me, and if you haven't noticed it by now, you need to go back and look at some mainstream news.
[3:50:26.920 --> 3:50:36.920]  The act is so shoddy, so bad, so preposterous, because they've now got, you know, on a team, the second stringers, the bench.
[3:50:36.920 --> 3:50:59.920]  That's what's in there. Not the first players. We'll be back after the break.
[3:50:59.920 --> 3:51:05.920]  Don't become dependent on the medical system. Get and stay healthy naturally with Extendivite.
[3:51:05.920 --> 3:51:09.920]  Metals in the liver cause peroxides to get dumped into the bloodstream.
[3:51:09.920 --> 3:51:20.920]  Peroxides do more damage than free radicals to the arteries and the LDL has no protection from peroxides, causing the LDL to get stuck in the arteries, creating a potential blockage.
[3:51:20.920 --> 3:51:29.920]  Extendivite slowly chelates the metals away from the liver so it can dispose of what was meant to be a harmless process, peroxide.
[3:51:29.920 --> 3:51:35.920]  Extendivite's seven herbs has a job to strengthen the organs and circulatory highway. Can you afford a heart attack?
[3:51:35.920 --> 3:51:58.920]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a two-month supply. To get started, call 1-877-928-8822. That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit partdrop.com.
[3:51:58.920 --> 3:52:09.920]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food. Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good-for-25-years survival food on hand in case of an emergency.
[3:52:09.920 --> 3:52:17.920]  Well, right now, in what is truly an unprecedented move, 72-hour survival food kits are being given away to listeners while supplies last.
[3:52:17.920 --> 3:52:29.920]  Survival food is more important today than ever before, explains Frank Pates, a spokesman for the company. Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other threats can make obtaining sufficient food impossible in an emergency.
[3:52:29.920 --> 3:52:43.920]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food rated for 25 years of storage. It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping and has been rated four and a half out of five stars by customers who paid full price.
[3:52:43.920 --> 3:52:58.920]  But listeners who act quickly can get it free, just cover $9.95 shipping. Go to freefood2.com right now. Supplies are limited and the program may end at any time. Go to freefood2.com now. That's freefood2.com.
[3:53:13.920 --> 3:53:39.920]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie. Then beef was for supper.
[3:53:39.920 --> 3:53:50.920]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available, starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, special ops general Jerry Boykin.
[3:53:50.920 --> 3:53:59.920]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white, and blue? RevelationTheMovie.info. Let's fix it.
[3:53:59.920 --> 3:54:09.920]  Well, you were sleeping. They came and took it all away.
[3:54:09.920 --> 3:54:16.920]  John Rathport back in our last segment here in the fourth hour for Alex on Infowars.
[3:54:16.920 --> 3:54:30.920]  Just want to say a couple more things about what Trump is doing here. State Department, mass resignations, and cutting funding to the UN. Baby, the United Nations.
[3:54:30.920 --> 3:54:56.920]  Now, I can remember going back, let's say 1964, somewhere in there, anybody who suggested that cutting funding to the UN or withdrawing from the UN, there's also a little bit of talk about that now, would be considered a complete paranoid wacko.
[3:54:56.920 --> 3:55:11.920]  Okay, that was out to destroy mankind and mankind's only hope for survival, the UN. Now, it's happening, cutting funding to the UN.
[3:55:11.920 --> 3:55:32.920]  Because, of course, the government of the United States is the main financial backer of the UN and is sitting there on territory in New York City that was donated by Rockefeller, arch-globalist family, and that was the purpose from the beginning.
[3:55:32.920 --> 3:55:44.920]  And all of a sudden, it's happening. The media doesn't want to talk about it. The media would like to forget that this is even on the table, much less actually happening. But it is happening.
[3:55:44.920 --> 3:56:11.920]  Unprecedented. Unprecedented. I mean, your adrenaline should flow when you hear this. Why? Because the UN, under all of this weighty rhetoric about the Earth Charter and one human family and all of the kinds of, you know, Hillary Clinton borrows from their speeches and they borrow from hers.
[3:56:11.920 --> 3:56:30.920]  It's all the same jive rhetoric. The cheese glob collective, as I like to call it, all will be wonderful. And what we mean by wonderful is the UN will promote the globalist management system of the world and eventually will eliminate sovereign nations.
[3:56:30.920 --> 3:56:47.920]  And there will only be regions and the regions will be collected under this one blanket of sustainable future, which means all in poverty. But it will be wonderful. Don't worry about it. Just keep your eyes straight ahead and keep moving.
[3:56:47.920 --> 3:57:08.920]  Another cesspool, I mean, endless cesspool, the UN, to go along with the endless cesspool at the State Department as if international negotiations, which seem to be, you know, the substance of what the State Department and the UN do.
[3:57:08.920 --> 3:57:18.920]  This can only be carried out in extraordinarily complex ways by people who take decades and years to hammer out these agreements and so on and so forth.
[3:57:18.920 --> 3:57:28.920]  Oh, way beyond the power of any of us to understand what's actually happening. Oh, forget it. Turns out this is just more jive.
[3:57:28.920 --> 3:57:43.920]  Just as you and I could sit down and hammer out some sort of a business agreement in an hour or two, nations can talk to each other and hammer out agreements without needing the State Department or the UN or anything.
[3:57:43.920 --> 3:57:57.920]  It's completely bogus. It always was bogus. It was never about peace in our time. It had nothing to do with that. And the power players knew it.
[3:57:57.920 --> 3:58:07.920]  Big things are happening, folks. Thanks for being here. See you in a couple of weeks. John Rappaport on Infowars. Stay good.
[3:58:27.920 --> 3:58:37.920]  Thank you.
