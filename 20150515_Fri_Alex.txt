[00:00.000 --> 00:08.340]  On May 7th, the lawsuit ACLU vs. James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, was
[00:08.340 --> 00:09.340]  decided.
[00:09.340 --> 00:13.020]  A three-judge panel for the Second Circuit held that the telephone metadata program
[00:13.020 --> 00:18.660]  exceeds the scope of what Congress has authorized and therefore violates Section 215 of the
[00:18.660 --> 00:19.660]  Patriot Act.
[00:19.660 --> 00:26.900]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of
[00:26.900 --> 00:27.900]  Americans?
[00:27.900 --> 00:30.820]  No, sir.
[00:30.820 --> 00:33.420]  It does not.
[00:33.420 --> 00:35.540]  Not wittingly.
[00:35.540 --> 00:42.340]  There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.
[00:42.340 --> 00:46.820]  James Clapper's attorney, Robert Litt, claimed that he wasn't lying when he wrongly told
[00:46.820 --> 00:51.460]  Congress in 2013 that the government does not wittingly collect information about millions
[00:51.460 --> 00:52.460]  of Americans.
[00:52.460 --> 00:53.460]  He just forgot.
[00:53.460 --> 00:54.460]  Pinocchio.
[00:54.460 --> 00:56.820]  This was an untruth or a falsehood.
[00:56.820 --> 01:00.340]  This was just a mistake on his part, Robert Litt said.
[01:00.340 --> 01:01.820]  We all make mistakes.
[01:01.820 --> 01:02.820]  Pinocchio.
[01:02.820 --> 01:06.700]  The ruling sends the case back to the district court for further proceedings.
[01:06.700 --> 01:07.700]  Pinocchio.
[01:07.700 --> 01:08.980]  The last practice is any lesson.
[01:08.980 --> 01:14.420]  Congress will wait until the spying program is about to expire and then in a panic, the
[01:14.420 --> 01:18.420]  frightening American people into accepting more intrusions on their privacy.
[01:18.420 --> 01:23.500]  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already put forth a new bill as a stopgap
[01:23.500 --> 01:27.180]  measure to allow time for a forward debate on the issue.
[01:27.180 --> 01:34.340]  His stopgap, a five-year reauthorization with no changes to the current program.
[01:34.340 --> 01:38.780]  Section 215 of the Conspicuously Subversive Patriot Act, commonly referred to as the
[01:38.780 --> 01:44.540]  Library Records Provision, 215 allows the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as
[01:44.540 --> 01:50.720]  applied by the director of the FBI or an official, designated by the director Access to Tangible
[01:50.720 --> 01:53.700]  Things, deemed under investigation.
[01:53.700 --> 01:58.220]  This investigation must be conducted in accordance under the guidelines laid out in executive
[01:58.220 --> 02:04.580]  order 1-2-3-3-3 and must not be carried out on citizens whose activities are protected
[02:04.580 --> 02:06.020]  by the First Amendment.
[02:06.020 --> 02:09.140]  All orders must be granted by a FISA court judge.
[02:09.140 --> 02:14.260]  This breach of trust by the federal government was exposed by whistleblowers and undermined
[02:14.260 --> 02:16.860]  by the intelligence community on a massive scale.
[02:16.860 --> 02:22.820]  I made the statement about that the greatest threat to our constitutional form of government
[02:22.820 --> 02:27.140]  since the Civil War is what's happening now in terms of spying in the United States.
[02:27.140 --> 02:30.780]  And that's the domestic spying program, Stellar Wind, that they started in secret and have
[02:30.780 --> 02:32.860]  been running in secret.
[02:32.860 --> 02:36.180]  So they're violating the constitutional rights of everyone.
[02:36.180 --> 02:40.580]  First Amendment rights are violated because you have the right under the First Amendment
[02:40.580 --> 02:43.620]  to have a free association.
[02:43.620 --> 02:46.940]  It doesn't say you have to write the free association as long as the government knows
[02:46.940 --> 02:47.940]  about it.
[02:47.940 --> 02:49.460]  That's the direct violation of that one.
[02:49.460 --> 02:54.940]  Meanwhile, the mouthpieces of the American counter-terror movement project the SIOP needed
[02:54.940 --> 02:58.020]  for the unconstitutional legislation.
[02:58.020 --> 03:02.020]  Expect to see more blatant extortion thrown at the feet of the American people.
[03:02.020 --> 03:07.060]  Threats like these will increase as the scrutiny of unconstitutional surveillance grows.
[03:07.060 --> 03:10.220]  Is the U.S. the new front line in the fight against ISIS?
[03:10.220 --> 03:14.500]  Well, we're certainly vulnerable, and this is all part of ISIS's strategy of conveying
[03:14.500 --> 03:15.980]  a winner's message.
[03:15.980 --> 03:20.500]  The motive is let them attack, have the mainstream media never point out that our own government
[03:20.500 --> 03:24.700]  funded them, created them, protected them, and allowed them to attack, and then, bet
[03:24.700 --> 03:29.980]  your bottom dollar, we're going to be attacked when more attacks happen, Paul, for pointing
[03:29.980 --> 03:32.300]  out that our government allowed it to happen bare minimum.
[03:32.300 --> 03:33.300]  Here's a tweet.
[03:33.300 --> 03:34.940]  Americans take pride in carrying handguns.
[03:34.940 --> 03:40.140]  What's your little gun going to do when an IED explodes spraying shrapnel faster than
[03:40.140 --> 03:41.140]  sound?
[03:41.140 --> 03:45.660]  So, they're now dehumanizing the Second Amendment, but that's the only thing that's thought
[03:45.660 --> 03:46.660]  to be done.
[03:46.660 --> 03:47.660]  Exactly.
[03:47.660 --> 03:49.660]  Our government's going to say, roll over, give your rights up when we get attacked.
[03:49.660 --> 03:54.060]  When we get attacked by their ISIS slobs, we're going to hold our traitorous government
[03:54.060 --> 03:55.060]  accountable.
[03:55.060 --> 03:57.860]  We're putting the narrative out now, and we've been doing it for four years.
[03:57.860 --> 04:02.500]  So, when your Jihad force globalists hits America and the Europe, you're going to get
[04:02.500 --> 04:03.500]  the blame.
[04:03.500 --> 04:04.500]  You hear that, Obama?
[04:04.500 --> 04:06.300]  You hear that, Henry Kissinger?
[04:06.300 --> 04:07.940]  You hear that, all of you?
[04:07.940 --> 04:08.940]  Northcom, Southcom?
[04:08.940 --> 04:11.140]  You're going to get the blame.
[04:11.140 --> 04:15.900]  Intelligence community, please explain how a subway restaurant worker has their Twitter
[04:15.900 --> 04:20.660]  and Facebook accounts immediately shut down after supporting the heinous murder of two
[04:20.660 --> 04:26.580]  police officers in Mississippi, but ISIS member accounts are allowed to stay online
[04:26.580 --> 04:32.660]  to threaten the global populace at will, John Bowne, Infowars.com.
[04:32.660 --> 04:35.540]  Very powerful report by John Bowne.
[04:35.540 --> 04:41.940]  If somebody was recording at about 8.45 central this morning on Fox, we need you to put it
[04:41.940 --> 04:42.940]  on YouTube.
[04:42.940 --> 04:50.300]  I was on an elliptical watching Fox News at the gym, and it showed ISIS forces rolling
[04:50.300 --> 04:57.460]  around Syria and Iraq in MRAP U.S. armored vehicles.
[04:57.460 --> 05:02.220]  Regardless of what you think about the Jade Helm operation coming up this summer, the
[05:02.220 --> 05:05.940]  main thing to always remember as an American is to question your government.
[05:05.940 --> 05:08.940]  That is something that you have a right to do.
[05:08.940 --> 05:13.020]  Americans have pretty much lost all faith in government at this point in time.
[05:13.020 --> 05:16.260]  The mainstream media is not doing their job whatsoever.
[05:16.260 --> 05:21.460]  They simply sit at their desk, read their teleprompters, and just spew out whatever words the government
[05:21.460 --> 05:23.540]  or Pentagon has told them to say.
[05:23.540 --> 05:27.980]  The fact that Lieutenant Colonel Mark Lestori and Thomas Meade said that the government
[05:27.980 --> 05:34.020]  sat back while these private landowners were approaching them, asking them to use our land
[05:34.020 --> 05:38.500]  to please come out here to ploy your troops and not take any money whatsoever.
[05:38.500 --> 05:43.420]  And now we know, as of yesterday, the mayor of Big City in Texas says that they will be
[05:43.420 --> 05:44.780]  getting compensation.
[05:44.780 --> 05:48.580]  They will be receiving money, and in fact, the government came to them.
[05:48.580 --> 05:53.100]  So if you'd like to see more about this, go watch a video called Caught in a Lie.
[05:53.100 --> 06:19.100]  It will be up at infowars.com.
[06:19.100 --> 06:27.180]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[06:27.180 --> 06:28.180]  Alex Jones here.
[06:28.180 --> 06:32.460]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist, and chemist
[06:32.460 --> 06:38.020]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[06:38.020 --> 06:42.940]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend, experience the benefits of
[06:42.940 --> 06:49.220]  combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical
[06:49.220 --> 06:50.220]  science.
[06:50.220 --> 06:54.860]  Visit infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[06:54.860 --> 06:55.860]  That's infowarslife.com.
[06:55.860 --> 06:56.860]  I am Mark Lestori.
[06:56.860 --> 06:58.020]  I will overview this line, line, line.
[06:58.020 --> 07:05.900]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[07:05.900 --> 07:10.140]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[07:10.140 --> 07:12.820]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[07:12.820 --> 07:18.260]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[07:18.260 --> 07:22.780]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[07:22.780 --> 07:27.180]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[07:27.180 --> 07:28.180]  drugs.
[07:28.180 --> 07:32.260]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[07:32.260 --> 07:34.260]  that children would actually like and take.
[07:34.260 --> 07:37.820]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for
[07:37.820 --> 07:42.420]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[07:42.420 --> 07:47.860]  Using child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential
[07:47.860 --> 07:49.940]  nutrients that taste great.
[07:49.940 --> 07:53.220]  Obtain your child ease today at infowarslife.com.
[07:53.220 --> 07:56.500]  That's child ease exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[07:56.500 --> 08:10.340]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[08:10.340 --> 08:15.220]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commentaries.
[08:15.220 --> 08:20.140]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[08:20.140 --> 08:21.140]  Dallas.
[08:21.140 --> 08:27.140]  The first report to say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[08:27.140 --> 08:32.140]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[08:32.140 --> 08:40.940]  It was almost as if it were a planned impulse to get Judge Pankin.
[08:40.940 --> 08:52.940]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[08:52.940 --> 09:10.380]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands
[09:10.380 --> 09:11.380]  of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[09:11.380 --> 09:12.380]  The guns will be taken, no one will be able to be off.
[09:12.380 --> 09:13.380]  We can take all of them.
[09:13.380 --> 09:16.380]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American
[09:16.380 --> 09:17.380]  city.
[09:17.380 --> 09:24.380]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[09:24.380 --> 09:52.380]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[09:52.380 --> 10:18.380]  We're
[10:18.380 --> 10:43.820]  in
[10:43.820 --> 10:54.540]  The UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, just reelected, came out and said, it's not enough
[10:54.540 --> 11:00.260]  to follow the law, you must love Big Brother, that's the headline.
[11:00.260 --> 11:04.540]  That's what Glenn Greenwald, investigative journalist, basically described his statement
[11:04.540 --> 11:13.140]  as, but here's the actual statement put out by the Prime Minister officially.
[11:13.140 --> 11:19.940]  For too long, we have been a passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens, as long as
[11:19.940 --> 11:23.900]  you obey the law, we will leave you alone.
[11:23.900 --> 11:26.700]  And then he goes on to say no longer.
[11:26.700 --> 11:33.700]  They are now trying to put in regulations, not even laws, where they will arrest you
[11:33.700 --> 11:36.580]  if you criticize anything that's politically correct.
[11:36.580 --> 11:45.660]  This is from the conservative Tory.
[11:45.660 --> 11:48.620]  And you notice in Europe, they already have this in some of the countries where they say,
[11:48.620 --> 11:53.540]  if you hurt someone's feelings, you can be arrested.
[11:53.540 --> 11:57.860]  That's why you can't criticize ISIS, because that hurts their feelings.
[11:57.860 --> 12:02.420]  In fact, Paul Watson had a special report yesterday, I want to play coming up, it's
[12:02.420 --> 12:10.780]  on Prison Planet Live and on InfoWars.com, where he breaks down Sweden and other countries
[12:10.780 --> 12:15.660]  are going to have taxpayer funded programs to bring the hundreds of thousands of ISIS
[12:15.660 --> 12:22.300]  fighters back, I guess tens of thousands for Sweden, to then put them through political
[12:22.300 --> 12:27.180]  correctness training after their trauma.
[12:27.180 --> 12:34.260]  But if you criticize them, you will be arrested.
[12:34.260 --> 12:40.660]  There's a great political cartoon on InfoWars.com about two-thirds of the way down on the right
[12:40.660 --> 12:48.340]  hand side that shows a big pink Trojan horse coming into the castle that says America.
[12:48.340 --> 12:55.180]  And the pink Trojan horse, my little pony Unicorn, I guess, says political correctness
[12:55.180 --> 13:01.220]  on the side, and Obama's opening the gate smiling up at it, but out of a hole in the
[13:01.220 --> 13:09.740]  back under the tail, there's an ISIS fighter with an ISIS flag and he's saying, well, no,
[13:09.740 --> 13:14.780]  actually, if it was an accurate rendition, it would be Obama and NATO and the globalist
[13:14.780 --> 13:20.180]  loading the Trojan horse full of weapons and ISIS, and then they'd be ordering the
[13:20.180 --> 13:28.780]  men at the gate to open the gate and then they'd be pushing it in because ISIS is al-Qaeda
[13:28.780 --> 13:38.300]  and is the fighting force being used by Saudi Arabia to destabilize the entire planet.
[13:38.300 --> 13:43.140]  And then the West is financing it so they can clamp down and take liberties on the other
[13:43.140 --> 13:47.300]  end of it and spend trillions fighting the supposed ISIS threat, which they don't really
[13:47.300 --> 13:53.300]  fight. And I said a year ago when they re-branded the name ISIS, Islamic State out of al-Qaeda,
[13:53.300 --> 13:57.940]  it's al-Qaeda flags, al-Qaeda operatives, and that's all come out in the news in their
[13:57.940 --> 14:02.540]  five-year war against Syria, that they would let them be resupplied in Iraq, give them
[14:02.540 --> 14:08.700]  big weapons caches, and then send them back in. And they indeed did do that. And then
[14:08.700 --> 14:14.100]  I was watching Fox at 8.45, roughly this morning, almost fell off the elliptical trying to pull
[14:14.100 --> 14:18.100]  my phone out of my pocket. I was listening to music on because I had closed captions
[14:18.100 --> 14:24.460]  on trying to get photos of it. And it was at the gym, so I couldn't EVO it. Somebody
[14:24.460 --> 14:27.580]  needs to go back and find this and play it. But they didn't show it once they came back
[14:27.580 --> 14:38.180]  from break on the outro to come back and talk about ISIS. They showed MRAPs rolling down
[14:38.180 --> 14:47.060]  the road with ISIS flags. And I didn't know that we'd given them the big MRAPs that the
[14:47.060 --> 14:50.420]  local police are getting. I mean, this is just crazy. And of course, the Iraqi government
[14:50.420 --> 14:54.380]  and the president has shared in his release video that our government is still arming
[14:54.380 --> 15:01.780]  al-Qaeda slash ISIS. But they know our military woke up to this, as we talked about at Nausium.
[15:01.780 --> 15:10.100]  General Shaper's been on to document it and back us up on this. We know that they've simply
[15:10.100 --> 15:18.700]  just rebranded it as ISIS to confuse the public so the public doesn't understand that it's
[15:18.700 --> 15:24.540]  all being financed by the West and that it's all basically staged war. Syria's back in
[15:24.540 --> 15:33.020]  trouble. Syria had fought back and pushed back ISIS. But $6 billion of U.S., French
[15:33.020 --> 15:40.700]  and other taxpayer money wasn't enough to bring down Assad back by the Russians. And
[15:40.700 --> 15:47.540]  so they've resupplied ISIS in Iraq and now they've invaded again into Syria and they're
[15:47.540 --> 15:51.780]  taking major cities right now and they're putting to the sword every Christian they
[15:51.780 --> 15:58.940]  get their hands on. Of course, Jews could live in peace there as well. They're being
[15:58.940 --> 16:05.020]  put to the sword. Those they can find, though they were smart enough to flee. The Christians
[16:05.020 --> 16:15.180]  don't have anywhere they can flee. Israel will allow Jews to flee there. Headline, barbarians
[16:15.180 --> 16:31.860]  at the gate. Syria says ISIS approaching ancient city of Palmyra. Fox News. It's such a crime.
[16:31.860 --> 16:42.060]  And I had Al Jazeera here interviewing me last night with their American reporter. This
[16:42.060 --> 16:46.820]  guy had the perfect elite New York accent. You know the one they use in Ferris Bueller.
[16:46.820 --> 16:50.580]  It's a day off. I happened to see some of that the other day. It was on cable. Great
[16:50.580 --> 16:54.260]  movie. And when he's got his buddy calling the school to get his girlfriend, he's going,
[16:54.260 --> 16:59.100]  I'm going to tell you something, Buster. You better have something right now or you're
[16:59.100 --> 17:05.580]  in major trouble. It's not understood. And I'm sitting there with this guy from Al Jazeera
[17:05.580 --> 17:08.300]  and I was so tired of like seven at night being interviewed. I was interviewed by a
[17:08.300 --> 17:11.980]  bunch of other radio and stuff yesterday because I'm so afraid to do interviews according
[17:11.980 --> 17:21.900]  to Stephanopoulos on this week. Boy, didn't he get some instant karma? And not instant
[17:21.900 --> 17:25.780]  karma for lying about us, but just instant karma. I came in and everybody's like, instant
[17:25.780 --> 17:30.740]  karma, instant karma. Like a happy trip of meerkats. What a great crew we have here in
[17:30.740 --> 17:40.020]  the meerkat nest. But that's kind of what the M4 is operations like. And he just kept
[17:40.020 --> 17:47.380]  going in the dangerous sitting the invasions imminent of Texas. And he had his producer
[17:47.380 --> 17:51.180]  super good looking woman with him who was smiling at me all fake the whole time and
[17:51.180 --> 17:55.420]  telling me how sexy my voice was. I was just like, Oh my God, this is going to be the ultimate
[17:55.420 --> 18:01.460]  headpiece. But I sat down and I'm sitting there and he's like, well, how are you going
[18:01.460 --> 18:08.540]  to feel something goes wrong after you stirred all this up, buddy? And I was just like, is
[18:08.540 --> 18:15.420]  that a real accent? He had the perfect pinstripe suit. He looked like a six foot four, uh, Ben
[18:15.420 --> 18:21.980]  athlete. And I was like, I started talking back to him. I was like, how much money are
[18:21.980 --> 18:27.300]  the Saudis paying you through your operation and British intelligence to do this piece?
[18:27.300 --> 18:34.700]  So it should be a really interesting interview of actually air any of it. Uh, but, uh, it
[18:34.700 --> 18:43.300]  was just crazy. And I'm here to tell everybody CBS NBC ABC. This week was Stephanopoulos.
[18:43.300 --> 18:50.700]  I want on your show, dirt bag. I'm sick of you people lying and saying, I didn't show
[18:50.700 --> 18:54.660]  up at the interview when you said, no, we're not doing it live. We said, okay, we're not
[18:54.660 --> 18:58.740]  doing it then. And then you show up a day and a half later to pick me up to the live
[18:58.740 --> 19:04.660]  show 12 minutes before Alan Cums was marveling about this yesterday. How's it a big name?
[19:04.660 --> 19:09.820]  National news story and hundreds of newspapers. And on, they were asking me from Al Jazeera.
[19:09.820 --> 19:17.820]  So why didn't you show up for the interview, but you're showing up with us? Let's go out
[19:17.820 --> 19:23.260]  to break with Stephanopoulos apologizing for lying. Here it is. Now I want to address some
[19:23.260 --> 19:27.460]  news you may have seen about me over the last several years. I've made substantial donations
[19:27.460 --> 19:31.940]  to dozens of charities, including the Clinton Global Foundation. Those donations were a
[19:31.940 --> 19:35.820]  matter of public record, but I should have made additional disclosures on air when we
[19:35.820 --> 19:40.300]  covered the foundation. And I now believe that directing personal donations, that foundation
[19:40.300 --> 19:45.060]  was a mistake. Even though I made them strictly support work done to stop the spread of AIDS,
[19:45.060 --> 19:48.940]  help children and protect the environment in poor countries, I should have gone the
[19:48.940 --> 19:53.860]  extra mile to avoid even the appearance of a conflict. I apologize to all of you for
[19:53.860 --> 20:00.860]  failing to do that. We'll be back.

[24:04.860 --> 24:23.380]  Mr. Jones, thank you for sitting down to speak with Al Jazeera. You're pretty bizarre, aren't
[24:23.380 --> 24:25.180]  you? You claim America is turning into a police state. You claim the military is going to
[24:25.180 --> 24:29.300]  be taken over. No, I don't claim it. It's happened. I mean,
[24:29.300 --> 24:36.220]  look at this quote by the Prime Minister of England. For too long, we have been a passively
[24:36.220 --> 24:41.140]  tolerant society, saying to our citizens, as long as you obey the law, we will leave
[24:41.140 --> 24:45.820]  you alone. So that's what this whole police state's about. The government's getting ready
[24:45.820 --> 24:53.900]  to politically eat our wealth, and they want to get us bullied into line right now. David
[24:53.900 --> 24:58.660]  Cameron's recent language, the London Guardian reports, the measures would give the police
[24:58.660 --> 25:05.260]  powers to apply to high court for an order to limit the harmful activities of an extremist
[25:05.260 --> 25:10.620]  individual. The definition of harmful is to include a risk of public disorder, a risk
[25:10.620 --> 25:16.180]  of harassment, a risk of harassment, alarm or distress, or creating a threat to the functioning
[25:16.180 --> 25:23.540]  of democracy. And what are they saying on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, this week against yours
[25:23.540 --> 25:31.580]  truly? He's got a right to free speech, but not to yell fire in a theater. And Alex Jones
[25:31.580 --> 25:36.820]  is yelling fire in a theater. In fact, yesterday with the Al Jazeera reporter, that's how he
[25:36.820 --> 25:42.220]  was talking to me. Or what if things get out of hand? What responsibility do you have for
[25:42.220 --> 25:49.940]  violence? The government is gearing up for a total takeover. We don't know if it's this
[25:49.940 --> 25:55.500]  summer or a year from now or when it's incrementally already happening. And they just keep making
[25:55.500 --> 26:00.060]  jokes about it. Well, the economy's going into free fall. We have a stack of articles
[26:00.060 --> 26:04.500]  on that front. This is a short segment. When we start the next segment, we were able, I
[26:04.500 --> 26:10.300]  guess they went back on our TVO doesn't records all the time now. So even a TVO, I just call
[26:10.300 --> 26:20.500]  any DVR a Timo. Come on, in Texas, everybody calls any soft drink a Coke. Just this is
[26:20.500 --> 26:26.500]  how we do it. We got I guess you call any truck a Ford. I don't know. I guess that's
[26:26.500 --> 26:32.900]  why they call any good looking woman in Australia Sheila. Huh? It's a good name. Let's go out
[26:32.900 --> 26:39.980]  and find us some Sheila's. But we're going to break all of this down coming up in the
[26:39.980 --> 26:44.500]  next segment that Buckley ran back and found it. And I'd forgotten the really bad part
[26:44.500 --> 26:47.860]  about it. And I was, I thought this one, I saw it and was reading the closed caption
[26:47.860 --> 26:54.300]  this morning because I was on the elliptical at the gym. They're like, Obama once is telling
[26:54.300 --> 26:59.980]  the media to stop showing video of ISIS and Syrian Iraq in convoys because they've already
[26:59.980 --> 27:06.420]  been disrupted and they're not in convoys anymore. Don't show the convoys. Well, I can
[27:06.420 --> 27:13.460]  watch foreign footage. There's new convoys. And you know why? Because it's Toyota trucks.
[27:13.460 --> 27:19.300]  It's M wraps and it's armored Humvees that they didn't accidentally get it basis. I predicted
[27:19.300 --> 27:22.820]  when their whole invasion began that they would accidentally get everything from the
[27:22.820 --> 27:28.780]  basis. You don't think of the basis. If they can't keep them or give them the Iraqi army,
[27:28.780 --> 27:37.220]  they fly in special forces in a matter of hours to blow them up in place. That's standard
[27:37.220 --> 27:42.660]  procedure. This was just a, just like Benghazi Benghazi wasn't an accident. That's come out.
[27:42.660 --> 27:49.900]  It was arming the al Qaeda rebels to have plausible denobility. Now we're told brace for ISIS
[27:49.900 --> 27:55.860]  to attack brace for Stinger missiles to shoot down airlines. Just like we said to coming
[27:55.860 --> 28:02.300]  up in the next segment. We have all of this footage and we have Paul Watson's article
[28:02.300 --> 28:08.740]  about the college student confronting Jeff Bush about quote his brother creating al Qaeda.
[28:08.740 --> 28:17.380]  You know, it's a little bit beyond that. And I'm not even saying Bush did it all. Let's
[28:17.380 --> 28:23.620]  be honest. Jimmy Carter was a bigger presence. He created what is al Qaeda today. Reagan
[28:23.620 --> 28:29.500]  believing he was fighting the Russians by the early eighties began ramping it up. And
[28:29.500 --> 28:33.980]  it just continued through George Herbert Walker, through Clinton. Remember when he was protecting
[28:33.980 --> 28:38.380]  middle on one of what wouldn't let him get killed. 96 97 that came out the niche. FBI
[28:38.380 --> 28:44.940]  just talked about it. And then under George W. There was actually a quasi war on them,
[28:44.940 --> 28:49.220]  but their leadership was all basically Western intelligence. And now they're just retiring
[28:49.220 --> 28:52.780]  all the old fake heads of al Qaeda. It was never really an operational force. It was
[28:52.780 --> 28:58.140]  a cut out. And they've shifted to this real jihad army with real jihadis. That's why I'm
[28:58.140 --> 29:03.620]  saying the terror threats real, it's still synthetic. It's still got built and wound
[29:03.620 --> 29:13.020]  up by the globalist. Speaking of that, there's just so many angles of this, we're going to
[29:13.020 --> 29:20.660]  come back and break it all down here. But it's just like the West helped fund Hitler,
[29:20.660 --> 29:27.900]  built him up. That's on record, the congressional hearings on an Anthony Sutton, Tony Sutton
[29:27.900 --> 29:34.020]  to help expose it as a congressional researcher. But it doesn't mean that Hitler was run by
[29:34.020 --> 29:42.980]  the West. He was wound up. He was wound up. They're called windup toys. Trojan zombie
[29:42.980 --> 29:51.980]  dictators. We'll be back. We're on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the
[29:51.980 --> 30:01.860]  GCN radio network. Today's hot stories at info wars.com on May 15, 2015 article up by
[30:01.860 --> 30:06.940]  Steve Watson, school order student to remove offensive US flag from truck. A school in
[30:06.940 --> 30:12.140]  York, South Carolina has come under fire for ordering a student to remove a US flag from
[30:12.140 --> 30:17.420]  his truck because it could possibly be offensive to some people. Well, that's the exact town
[30:17.420 --> 30:21.700]  where my mother lives and the way these people reacted is exactly what I would expect from
[30:21.700 --> 30:26.140]  the citizens of York, South Carolina way to stand up. Article by Kit Daniels National

[33:33.860 --> 33:38.140]  and transferred over so I'm gonna at the bottom of the next hour do a whole presentation
[33:38.140 --> 33:43.500]  on the world waking up the fact that Western governments are giving weapons and armaments
[33:43.500 --> 33:49.060]  to Al Qaeda now known as ISIS and it ties into Jeb Bush being confronted on it. It ties
[33:49.060 --> 33:53.660]  into a whole host of issues that is coming up at the bottom of the next hour because
[33:53.660 --> 33:58.820]  I do want to start going to your phone calls. There is just stacks of over the top important
[33:58.820 --> 34:04.580]  news US Gulf States agreed to counter Iran's destabilizing activities that ties into the
[34:04.580 --> 34:10.900]  ISIS situation. 40 volcanoes are erupting right now and 34 of them are along the ring
[34:10.900 --> 34:17.380]  of fire. Oh yeah, the ring of fire is the most active since volcanologists and seismologists
[34:17.380 --> 34:24.620]  have been really studying things over the 200 years. I mean it is definitely definitely
[34:24.620 --> 34:31.420]  getting hot and so is the super volcano at Yellowstone. We're gonna get to China's secret
[34:31.420 --> 34:37.980]  space weapons targeting US soon every satellite will be at risk. We're gonna break that down.
[34:37.980 --> 34:46.860]  Video school order students to remove offensive US flag from truck. We're gonna get to that
[34:46.860 --> 34:54.220]  and this is in South Carolina. This isn't like it's in San Francisco. People say well
[34:54.220 --> 34:59.540]  that's just crazy. It makes no sense. No, it's totally dominating and training you that
[34:59.540 --> 35:04.780]  you have no free speech but then every other socialist or radical group does. These are
[35:04.780 --> 35:10.700]  totalitarians people. Oh so they're dumb. Why don't they want freedom? They're not dumb.
[35:10.700 --> 35:16.860]  They're conquering us. General Electric's not dumb when it finances Obama to get into
[35:16.860 --> 35:24.060]  office and they shut down a thousand plus power plants not owned by GE and then GE coal
[35:24.060 --> 35:30.660]  power plant profits more than double because they're given a waiver. McDonald's isn't
[35:30.660 --> 35:36.020]  dumb when it pays Obama to give them a waiver for Obamacare on their thousands of stores
[35:36.020 --> 35:42.580]  but their competitors don't get a waiver so their food costs more. It's how you create
[35:42.580 --> 35:52.220]  monopolies. Look at this headline. Pro abortion group labels 20 week babies not killing them
[35:52.220 --> 36:01.660]  inhumane. That's their words. See it's about inverting reality with these people. Southern
[36:01.660 --> 36:06.620]  Christian leadership conference calls for amnesty for rioters, looters, and Baltimore. Can't
[36:06.620 --> 36:12.620]  make that up. Including folks that beat white people's heads in and put them in commas because
[36:12.620 --> 36:18.460]  racially attacking whites is okay. They deserve it. Just like Jihadis are freedom fighters
[36:18.460 --> 36:24.260]  and for some reason are allied with socialist and collectivist and progressives and if you're
[36:24.260 --> 36:32.820]  against radical stone age, dark age cults, I mean I don't care if it's some weird Christian
[36:32.820 --> 36:36.900]  cult that wants to dominate and control women or if it's some Islamic cult, I mean just
[36:36.900 --> 36:43.020]  stay away cults because I'm a classical liberal. See I'm into real freedom and being tolerant
[36:43.020 --> 36:48.300]  but that means you're going to be tolerant of me. Do you understand my private property?
[36:48.300 --> 36:55.300]  My guns, my views, my religion. It doesn't mean I accept what you want. Doesn't mean
[36:55.300 --> 37:01.540]  I turn my five year olds over so you can teach them how to give oral sex. Doesn't mean I
[37:01.540 --> 37:06.180]  got to shoot all your vaccines up. You want to shoot your kids up and have them have convulsions
[37:06.180 --> 37:10.820]  and take care of them and have 30 year olds in diapers? Knock yourselves out. I'm not
[37:10.820 --> 37:15.660]  paying for it through socialist healthcare. Oh but you already got me. I'm into collectivism
[37:15.660 --> 37:26.100]  now I see. See I mean I just, there's like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 stacks. I
[37:26.100 --> 37:29.180]  just got through a third of one. I'm going to stop right there before I get too angry
[37:29.180 --> 37:37.500]  and I want to go to your calls. Bottom of the next hour I will get to all of these tie-ins
[37:37.500 --> 37:45.940]  and the fact that they, Obama isn't asking the news media to stop showing footage of
[37:45.940 --> 37:52.260]  the fact that ISIS has armored vehicles because it makes them look like they're tough and
[37:52.260 --> 37:59.780]  scary. They want to train the media to not cover military operations when they say so
[37:59.780 --> 38:05.860]  and they don't like the fact that there's giant convoys of armored MRAPs that they didn't
[38:05.860 --> 38:15.260]  just accidentally get. Next we're going to hear ISIS accidentally
[38:15.260 --> 38:22.860]  got nuclear weapons from you know the nuclear laboratories in the U.S. I mean this is ridiculous.
[38:22.860 --> 38:30.940]  I'm going to play Paul Watson's report, total proof that political correctness is a mental
[38:30.940 --> 38:39.460]  illness. That of course coined by Savage 20 years ago, I don't know, 15, 16 years ago
[38:39.460 --> 38:48.140]  to be technical. And yes the followers are mentally ill, but the technocrats are not
[38:48.140 --> 38:53.820]  mentally ill. The George Stephanophilus are part of a mafia and they get up and they go
[38:53.820 --> 39:03.420]  I'm sorry I didn't disclose I gave $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation when I've been
[39:03.420 --> 39:07.820]  reporting on them and saying they're not corrupt as if it's a conflict of interest.
[39:07.820 --> 39:11.900]  It's a conflict of interest that you were Bill Clinton's chief of staff when all the
[39:11.900 --> 39:19.180]  murders and corruption and missile secrets to China and Panama Canal handovers and every
[39:19.180 --> 39:24.060]  other corruption you could imagine. I mean you turn on CNN, ABC, any of it, it's just
[39:24.060 --> 39:31.940]  filled with Democratic party operatives like Paul Bogala and Wolf Blitzer. I mean it's
[39:31.940 --> 39:40.220]  all a conflict of interest. You're all a bunch of Brian Williams pig droppings in my view.
[39:40.220 --> 39:47.900]  George pig dropping Stephanophilus is now apologizing. Again talk about instant karma.
[39:47.900 --> 39:52.180]  These are a pack of liars folks. They said we're going to have you on live, we promise.
[39:52.180 --> 39:55.580]  I told Niko, watch they're going to cancel that on Friday and say it's taped. Friday
[39:55.580 --> 40:02.940]  they go it's taped now. We go oh let us guess win 6am, three hours before airtime. No we're
[40:02.940 --> 40:13.940]  not doing it. Okay how about 8am? Okay we'll talk about it with you. Next 12 minutes before
[40:13.940 --> 40:19.740]  airtime. Oh we're here to pick you up. As I'm unshaven with my hair sticking up, drinking
[40:19.740 --> 40:27.500]  coffee and about to cook my children breakfast. I mean I was getting cartons of eggs out as
[40:27.500 --> 40:34.900]  they came out with their hair sticking up and I just didn't even answer the phone and
[40:34.900 --> 40:38.540]  they get to turn that into afraid to go on your show because I would jump through all
[40:38.540 --> 40:42.220]  these hoops and oh yes let me just wait by the phone till you maybe call us back after
[40:42.220 --> 40:45.660]  a day and a half not talking to us so I can come on your stupid show because I want to
[40:45.660 --> 40:49.260]  be on George 7 Oveless. I can care less about being on your show. I can't stand being around
[40:49.260 --> 40:55.100]  you people but I love running you over and disrespecting you clown. But let's go to this
[40:55.100 --> 41:01.220]  little mafia don. Another dropping like Rammanual. The guy that says they're going to put you
[41:01.220 --> 41:07.420]  on no fly list if you're a gun owner outside of law so you can't fly. A guy that says once
[41:07.420 --> 41:11.820]  we have national ID cards they'll just turn conservatives ID cards off. You know if they're
[41:11.820 --> 41:16.300]  harassing every conservative libertarian and Christian group with the IRS and arresting
[41:16.300 --> 41:24.300]  people for no reason and persecuting everyone and even going after FBI you know agent foundations
[41:24.300 --> 41:30.460]  that are for libertarianism. What do you think they'll do once they've got everything digital
[41:30.460 --> 41:37.020]  controlled. I mean these people are totalitarian monsters. Let's go ahead and go to Stephan
[41:37.020 --> 41:41.900]  Oveless one more time apologizing. Now I want to address some news you may have seen about
[41:41.900 --> 41:46.300]  me. Over the last several years I've made substantial donations to dozens of charities
[41:46.300 --> 41:50.620]  including the Clinton Global Foundation. Those donations were a matter of public record but
[41:50.620 --> 41:54.860]  I should have made additional disclosures on air when we covered the foundation. And I
[41:54.860 --> 41:59.260]  now believe that directing personal donations that foundation was a mistake. Even though
[41:59.260 --> 42:03.620]  I made them strictly support work done to stop the spread of AIDS help children and protect
[42:03.620 --> 42:07.620]  the environment in poor countries I should have gone the extra mile to avoid even the
[42:07.620 --> 42:13.580]  appearance of a conflict. I apologize to all of you for failing to do that. By the way what
[42:13.580 --> 42:20.700]  you get in that foundation is their fleet of jet aircraft to fly you to luxury destinations
[42:20.700 --> 42:28.220]  tax free exempt and then to stay in hotels. Over half the money goes for the travel the
[42:28.220 --> 42:35.620]  houses the hotels the jets. Then a large portion of the other 45% goes to other infrastructure
[42:35.620 --> 42:48.140]  and a very small percent goes to quote Africans or others. So this is what they do and it's
[42:48.140 --> 42:55.380]  a mafia foundation period and he's part of the mob. And so he thinks you'll get away
[42:55.380 --> 42:59.420]  with it but he's nothing but another Brian Williams liar. Hey Stephanophilus why don't
[42:59.420 --> 43:03.500]  you like your boss Hillary tell us you were in combat or a helicopter got shot down or
[43:03.500 --> 43:08.860]  you got shot at in Serbia. I mean you're a joke you're a nobody your ratings are down
[43:08.860 --> 43:16.860]  because people don't want to watch weak little mealymouth political hack operatives. But you're
[43:16.860 --> 43:20.260]  a political class that's taken over so you can't help yourselves you've all got to give
[43:20.260 --> 43:24.780]  yourself TV shows that no one will come watch no matter how many billions of dollars you've
[43:24.780 --> 43:32.700]  got behind you. We can sit here in a studio and a system that costs one-thirtieth of
[43:32.700 --> 43:39.420]  what your your operation does I've looked it up and crush you. You think Tartanophilus
[43:39.420 --> 43:47.300]  likes the fact that we have 20 million listeners and viewers a week and they know that. Al Jazeera
[43:47.300 --> 43:50.660]  was like yes we've looked at your numbers and you do have around 20 million people that
[43:50.660 --> 43:54.420]  watch or listen every week you know don't you think that's dangerous. You know what
[43:54.420 --> 43:58.820]  I think it is dangerous to people like you because here's the deal you're a bunch of knuckle
[43:58.820 --> 44:02.700]  dragon gangsters you'd love to just come after me but you don't want to make me a martyr
[44:02.700 --> 44:08.100]  and you've surveilled me and have my M.O. and you know I'm going all the way so you don't
[44:08.100 --> 44:13.300]  know what to do. Let me explain something scum. None of us are backing down or shutting
[44:13.300 --> 44:23.100]  up. We're going to go to Bill Jordan Donald Chris Chris and others here in a moment. Briefly
[44:23.100 --> 44:27.100]  I just want to let you know that we appreciate listeners supporting the transmission and
[44:27.100 --> 44:31.740]  helping us fund our operation. We're not funded at the barrel of a gun like the IRS funds
[44:31.740 --> 44:36.220]  this criminal government this illegitimate occupied government that also gives stimulus
[44:36.220 --> 44:43.780]  money to MSNBC. We have the summer sale it's your last chance super male vitality super

[46:28.260 --> 46:35.820]  infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 this is a great report by Watson but he says the total
[46:35.820 --> 46:42.320]  mental illness of liberals I guess they are mentally ill that they're tyrannical gibbering
[46:42.320 --> 46:46.740]  control freaks who in Canadian studies are six times more likely to steal or to not give
[46:46.740 --> 46:52.060]  to charity because they're not real liberals and I just don't think they're liberals I
[46:52.060 --> 46:58.620]  think they are gangs of insecure babies that guilt good people into serving them as minions
[46:58.620 --> 47:03.340]  let's go ahead and go to Paul Watson's report if you want a glimpse of what happens to countries
[47:03.340 --> 47:09.540]  when they embrace the mental disorder of extreme liberalism look no further than Sweden and
[47:09.540 --> 47:15.260]  no this is not a hoax it's not satire it's not out of the onion this is a real story
[47:15.260 --> 47:22.660]  socialists in Sweden want to tax the population to pay for returning ISIS terrorists to get
[47:22.660 --> 47:29.620]  jobs and reintegrate into society that's because they're a shadow army this is all funded
[47:29.620 --> 47:35.900]  by the west a raro municipality councillor rasmus person wants to offer psychological
[47:35.900 --> 47:41.340]  help to enable jihadist militants overcome traumatic experiences they may have suffered
[47:41.340 --> 47:45.780]  while fighting in iraq Syria but we don't have a visual coordinator against violent
[47:45.780 --> 47:53.180]  extremism mona saline wants to take the idea nationwide and impose a tax aid for immigrants
[47:53.180 --> 47:59.660]  who fought with ISIS taxing citizens to pay for the reintegration of violent actually
[47:59.660 --> 48:07.980]  people they're going to raise off buildings and stone women to death it's liberal and
[48:07.980 --> 48:14.660]  remember this is a country whose taxpayer funded expert on Islamophobia went on to
[48:14.660 --> 48:22.460]  join ISIS Swedish soldier Frederick Brandberg fired
[48:22.460 --> 48:27.560]  back at this insane proposal by pointing out that the country's combat veterans some of
[48:27.560 --> 48:34.540]  whom are currently fighting against ISIS militants in iraq don't even get offered jobs when they
[48:34.540 --> 48:40.420]  return home swedish armed forces responded by saying that was quote no longer our business
[48:40.420 --> 48:46.060]  Marie Hoff was completely ridiculed for days on end when she made her infamous jobs for
[48:46.060 --> 48:53.380]  ISIS argument but there's no ridicule in Sweden this is being treated as a legitimate debate
[48:53.380 --> 48:58.060]  now there's also a big debate at the moment in Britain about how to prevent ISIS wannabes
[48:58.060 --> 49:02.740]  from leaving the country to go and fight in Syria God knows why I mean just go and let
[49:02.740 --> 49:06.820]  them blow themselves up for all I care but at least the hundreds of jihadists who are
[49:06.820 --> 49:13.540]  now returning to Britain are actually being arrested in Sweden they're about to be given
[49:13.540 --> 49:20.340]  counseling and employment all at taxpayer expense but to be fair Sweden is the shining
[49:20.340 --> 49:25.500]  light in terms of cohesive and beneficial Muslim immigration into the country right
[49:25.500 --> 49:29.620]  well no actually the rape capital of Europe and avant-garde Muslim ghettos where police
[49:29.620 --> 49:35.020]  firefighters and ambulance workers are attacked on a regular basis but hey pandering to violent
[49:35.020 --> 49:40.580]  rapist criminals just isn't progressive enough let's roll out the red carpet for terrorists
[49:40.580 --> 49:47.820]  who kidnap women and force them to undergo surgery after every act of rape to restore
[49:47.820 --> 49:54.820]  their virginity that's compassionate liberalism stick a fork in Sweden because it's done
[49:54.820 --> 50:01.340]  and this once proud nation can now only serve as a warning to others about what happens
[50:01.340 --> 50:09.140]  when governments become afflicted with the mental disorder of extreme liberalism that's
[50:09.140 --> 50:15.060]  right the other video subscribe to the channel I'm paul joseph Watson for info wars dot com

[50:23.060 --> 50:29.260]  families prepare their daughters for the third world populations who don't even have a culture
[50:29.260 --> 50:34.020]  anymore they adopt kind of US gangster rap and then both their Eastern European thugs
[50:34.020 --> 50:38.700]  or Muslim radical thugs whatever the families then deliver their daughters when they're
[50:38.700 --> 50:44.580]  about 15 to date them and then to be handed over to prostitution basically and have cigarettes

[55:18.500 --> 55:24.540]  John Wayne, alright let's go to your phone calls and then I'm gonna get into all this
[55:24.540 --> 55:28.380]  other news throughout the day and a bunch of breakdowns, special reports it's gonna
[55:28.380 --> 55:33.940]  be jam packed but they have to teach you to be mentally ill to accept anything so that
[55:33.940 --> 55:38.820]  you have no morals so you can be dominated and controlled and that's why political correctness
[55:38.820 --> 55:43.900]  sounds so crazy that you can't have an American flag on your shirt or on your truck at a public
[55:43.900 --> 55:47.860]  school in South Carolina where you can't play with a Nerf gun in your backyard, the
[55:47.860 --> 55:53.620]  school says they have no jurisdiction, they do it to train you that they can take you
[55:53.620 --> 56:06.420]  a million miles, you're being hit by psych warfare, alright let's go to Bill in California
[56:06.420 --> 56:09.140]  thanks for holding, thanks for calling in, go ahead.
[56:09.140 --> 56:16.260]  Yeah good morning, let's do some good news today and that's the Texas State Guard which
[56:16.260 --> 56:24.540]  is not the National Guard, they are purely a state organization, the Governor, Craig
[56:24.540 --> 56:31.860]  Abbott, Commander in Chief, Major General John F. Nichols is adjutant, they are composed
[56:31.860 --> 56:37.860]  of true patriots who are volunteering their time, oh by the way I mean I've seen these
[56:37.860 --> 56:43.700]  jokes in the media going our army can destroy the Texas Guard, the Texas Guard is one of
[56:43.700 --> 56:49.380]  the few states that has this, it's a great organization, I know a lot of these people
[56:49.380 --> 56:54.180]  and a lot of them are the very best of the best that do this to volunteer to help the
[56:54.180 --> 56:59.060]  state of Texas and this country and so you're absolutely right, they are great people and
[56:59.060 --> 57:03.540]  folks that make fun of them like they're ROTC or something have no idea what they're talking
[57:03.540 --> 57:04.540]  about.
[57:04.540 --> 57:11.940]  Not at all, these are seasoned veterans usually and they are the cream of the cream, they're
[57:11.940 --> 57:21.660]  well educated, very experienced and true patriots and I would suggest that you get Joe Biggs
[57:21.660 --> 57:31.700]  out there to set up a little special on them and who they are, what they do and the courage
[57:31.700 --> 57:39.020]  that the Governor has shown in putting them against the Jade Helm.
[57:39.020 --> 57:42.020]  By the way almost all states have a state guard.
[57:42.020 --> 57:46.580]  No I know but ours is more robust and Texas is truly independent, I know most states have
[57:46.580 --> 57:50.940]  a state guard of folks that come out and help with traffic control and things like that
[57:50.940 --> 57:54.900]  but the state guard here particularly from what I've read is different than other states,
[57:54.900 --> 57:56.900]  isn't that correct?
[57:56.900 --> 58:03.980]  Not much, no, it dates all the way back to 1823, they were chartered by the Emperor of
[58:03.980 --> 58:12.540]  Mexico and of course moved over to the Republic when it was formed so they are the oldest
[58:12.540 --> 58:16.460]  of the military forces in Texas.
[58:16.460 --> 58:22.380]  I knew that and I know they're charters different because the Texas is the lone start state,
[58:22.380 --> 58:26.700]  the only state to enter by treaty but thank you so much, great call bell, thanks for holding,
[58:26.700 --> 58:32.180]  we're going to be back in 70 seconds with Chris, Jordan, Donald and others.
[58:32.180 --> 58:47.980]  Okay with us, I'm Alex Jones, this is the InfoWars.
[58:47.980 --> 58:55.180]  In the near future, when you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball, security,
[58:55.180 --> 59:01.180]  alert, this is Homeland Security, analysis, InfoWars building independent media operations.
[59:01.180 --> 59:06.180]  Let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[59:06.180 --> 59:08.980]  Prime Directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[59:08.980 --> 59:13.940]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory, a popular conspiracy theory talk show called
[59:13.940 --> 59:14.940]  InfoWars.
[59:14.940 --> 59:20.100]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail, these people are assaulting us, targeting of patriots
[59:20.100 --> 59:25.580]  engaged, they are never going to stop, they're never going to deviate from their program
[59:25.580 --> 59:27.420]  until we stop them.
[59:27.420 --> 59:42.380]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out,
[59:42.380 --> 01:00:08.380]  it's for God you can fail it.
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:09.380]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.380]  Well so does he.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:21.380]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:36.220]  Well the USDA has published a healthy food photo to combat the hashtag thanks Michelle
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:40.900]  Obama meme, Southern Christian Leadership Conference calls for amnesty for rioters,
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:49.940]  looters and Baltimore, videos, school children ordered to remove offensive US flag, pro-abortion
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:55.620]  group labels 20 week ban inhuman, it's inhuman to not want to kill babies, up is down, down
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:02.340]  is up, caught in the lie, Jade Helm 15, excellent report with Joe Biggs, Seymour Hirsch, slams
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:07.100]  establishment media says, I'm not backing off anything I said, China's secret space
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:13.220]  weapon targeting US soon every satellite will be at risk, corporate gods order Obama to
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:17.540]  ram through the TPP, that's just some of what's coming up today.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:23.100]  We're taking your phone calls right now, let's go to Chris in Chicago, you're on the
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:48.100]  air, welcome.
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:02:07.980]  I know that there's no limit to the depths of the privity of some of our leaders and
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:13.220]  I'm just thinking myself, it just crosses my mind all the time that our government might
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:19.980]  be supplying guns, why wouldn't they be supplying guns to the gangs in Chicago to help get rid
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:25.460]  of, you're in my gun rights and I just wanted to get your thoughts on, you know, it's amazing
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:29.940]  you bring that up, we've caught them engaging in fast and furious and other gun running
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:35.060]  operations in the stabilized Mexico, Southwest, track the guns by the Second Amendment, CBS
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:39.460]  News got those documents, the reporter released them, she ended up losing her job over that,
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:44.100]  remember the time going, how is CBS doing this, well, they had a real reporter.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:48.820]  When Al Jazeera was interviewing me yesterday, they said, okay, the interview's over, they
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:53.820]  went, wait, wait, wait, and the producer, this woman, she goes, wait a minute, I've
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:58.980]  got questions about guns, and so he starts asking the gun questions, he goes, you claim
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.940]  there's a move to ban guns, but everyone knows it's not true, and I went, they've banned
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.500]  guns in Chicago, New York, DC, even though the Supreme Court's rule, they've got to
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:11.060]  reverse it, they haven't, they've made it incredibly hard, almost impossible, they
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:14.860]  go, no, they haven't, you can own guns anywhere, no one wants your guns, it's like Bloomberg
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:21.100]  writes articles going, I'm the most pro-second-minute person anywhere, I believe in it, it's like
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:26.700]  don't run, we are your friends from Mars attacks, this is what they do, and so according
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:32.980]  to Al Jazeera, there is no move to get your guns, sir, you can go buy guns anywhere in
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:38.300]  Chicago, of course that's not true, and these gun groups admit in their internal documents
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:42.900]  that gun bans what they want, but there is no Jade Helm, there is no NSA Spying, there
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:49.260]  is no open borders, there is no funding ISIS, there is no, but that's a great point, we
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:55.300]  know that corrupt police departments use the guns that they confiscate from gun dealers
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:00.260]  and people they raid that don't have their documentation, and have been caught selling
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:05.260]  them out the back door to criminals, that's come out in the news so many times, it makes
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:09.420]  my head spin, now I don't think there were caught them where it's been directed by the
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:13.580]  police chief, I'm sure that might have been happening, it's usually rogue groups doing
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:21.180]  it because I'm not for corruption in police, but I do get not wanting to destroy valuable
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:26.140]  firearms and want to sell them, and most of the time they end up selling them to gun dealers
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:30.020]  or legitimate people out the back door, and then give them the money to fraternal groups
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:35.220]  or whatever, and that is criminal and shouldn't happen, I get it though, not the letter of
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.900]  the law, spirit of the law, but no, departments have been caught selling them to gangs, that's
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:44.540]  because a lot of times gangs are the puppet henchmen, like at motorcycle gangs will have
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:49.900]  puppets, like Hell's Angels has puppet groups, front groups, for the police departments themselves,
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:53.580]  so it's an excellent question Chris, God bless you, appreciate your call, we'll be back with
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.300]  more calls in three minutes, stay with us.
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:03.120]  Today's Hot Stories at infowars.com on May 15, 2015, article up by Steve Watson, school

[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:12.920]  has come under fire for ordering a student to remove a US flag from his truck because
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:18.580]  it could possibly be offensive to some people, article by Kit Daniels, National Guard, police
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:24.100]  gearing up for potential Cleveland riots, article by Curt Nemo, Southern Christian Leadership

[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:35.580]  Conference, the Baltimore People's Power Assembly and the Be More United Coalition are calling
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:40.460]  for people arrested during violent protests in Baltimore to be released, according to
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:45.060]  the Reverend Courtly C.D. Witherspoon of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:49.820]  the protesters will march from McLean Square through the Inner Harbor, demanding amnesty
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:53.420]  for those arrested during the Freddie Gray protests.

[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:11.780]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:16.940]  Infowars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:22.180]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:27.140]  ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:32.020]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:36.780]  Oxy powder does not require time off work, and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:43.140]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.

[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:15.220]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowars Life line because they are
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:20.220]  not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:26.580]  don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at infowarslife.com.
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:32.260]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female

[01:07:53.220 --> 01:08:00.300]  edge, hardcore products.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:06.860]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:10.300]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:16.740]  All right, we're going to cut this segment short because I understand we have an urgent
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:20.900]  phone call right now from Admiral Ackbar of the Rebel Alliance.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.580]  Admiral, thanks for joining us.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:27.180]  You know, we were just talking about the internet kill switch and Barack Obama, you know, he
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:32.580]  just said that he thinks we should hand power of the internet over to the federal government.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:37.900]  Like that sounds like a scary thought and Obama says it will be used fairly and distributed
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:38.900]  equally.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:39.900]  What do you say to that?
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:43.300]  It's a trap.
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.300]  What happened?
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:50.780]  Do we just, do we lose them?
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:54.540]  But of course, ladies and gentlemen, in the real world, the takeover of free speech of
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:58.180]  the internet won't be done overnight in just a few seconds.
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:03.060]  Like that satirical piece that Darren McBrain produced for the nightly news last night.
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:06.620]  It'll be done incrementally.
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:12.700]  But even in an incremental push, you finally get to a point where you're cooked.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.180]  You put the frog in the pot.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:18.780]  At first it's cold, then it's warm, then it's hot, then it's boiling, but by then the frogs
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.980]  passed out.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:24.580]  We are getting to the frog passing out point, but now the frogs start to try to climb out
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.580]  a little bit.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:29.820]  Texas and other states are going, why are you saying you want to take on veterans and
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:34.140]  gun owners and you're listing the status hostile and you've got these drills where you say
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:38.580]  you're going to be simulating illegal activities and the army goes, we're not simulating any
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:40.700]  illegal activities.
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.220]  That document's probably not real.
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.460]  Alex Jones makes stuff up.
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:48.580]  Okay, the document's real, but we're not going to be paying anybody off or doing anything
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:51.700]  illegal or in plain clothes.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:55.900]  Really, here's your manual and here's your spokesman a month ago saying it.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:56.900]  Never mind that.
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.900]  Why do you hate the military?
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:00.900]  Well, we don't hate the military.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:04.740]  That's why it's mainly veterans that are upset and current active duty.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:08.340]  And there's been three different C-SPAN shows that we've heard about and then gone to the
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.820]  archives and watched.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:13.180]  Rob do had a piece on it with Leon McAvoy a few nights ago on the nightly news where
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:18.620]  they'll take an hour with a Pentagon guest on any subject.
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:26.740]  And let's not exaggerate, eight out of 10 calls are on Jade Helm and saying, I'm a veteran
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:27.740]  and I see through this.
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.500]  I just got out five years ago and we would be brought to giant training centers no matter
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:32.940]  what the terrain was.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:37.020]  This is for domestic acclimation of the public because they understand there's a state's
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:42.500]  rights movement and Obama's been shutting off our infrastructure and doing things unilaterally.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.260]  Thank you for the call from Colorado.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:47.220]  Now let's go to the independent line.
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:51.220]  Well, I've just got to tell you, there'll be a woman on there that, you know, my husband's
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.100]  active duty right now and he's concerned.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:11:00.180]  And next caller, this is so healthy that people see through what's happening.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:03.420]  The problem is that I'm going to your calls.
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:08.860]  The problem is, I've tried to figure out why they're hyping this so much, why they're
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:11.980]  making such a big deal about it, why they're misrepresenting everything we've said so
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:13.820]  much.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:20.900]  This is, conservatively, ten times.
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:21.900]  I thought about this a lot.
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:26.860]  It's about ten times any previous attack we've been under.
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:33.460]  Hundreds of newspapers a day, TV shows every day, national news, lying about infowars.com
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:37.180]  and yours truly.
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:40.940]  I don't want to speculate, but I think they may be getting ready to attack military personnel
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:45.380]  during Jade Helm and I've said coming up, they'll have false flags where they have patriots
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.820]  target military personnel.
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:55.820]  Personnel get targeted, then they say it's all your fault, Alex Jones, that this group
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:57.980]  of militia attacked the military.
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:04.900]  And of course, it'll be contractors, probably foreign that do it.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:10.780]  They will grab one mentally ill Patsy, who's being watched in a militia group led by Feds.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:22.100]  There's a low IQ, they'll be drugged up, never again seen like McVeigh or Zarnev brother.
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:25.060]  Even if they plead not guilty and say they were set up, they'll never see the lie today,
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:28.500]  they'll be put in a super max prison.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:33.420]  And if you look at who's in the super max prison, I was doing some studies on the big
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:34.420]  one in Colorado.
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:39.820]  I spent like four or five hours this weekend looking at it and I noticed it was all political
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:45.140]  people like Theodore Kaczynski and Terry Nichols and others who basically said they
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:49.220]  were set up later and that was part of a larger operation.
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:55.660]  And they admit the Justice Department then runs what they eat, who they can talk to and
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:59.660]  that they're never allowed basically to ever talk to the media or anybody.
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:08.380]  So it's just where they send you when you're the new boogeyman, new cut out.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:16.180]  Because I mean, you notice that Terry Nichols never attacked anyone since he was arrested.
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:19.660]  And Terry Nichols came out and affidavits from the time from lawsuits.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:23.860]  I've interviewed people that were in jail with him as well, I've interviewed the lawyers
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:29.460]  of FBI agents on air, the FBI agents credit two of them, I remember in the LA Times with
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:34.020]  public about five years after Oklahoma City and said, no, we saw the footage, McVeigh was
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:39.180]  with a bunch of other men and there was a cover up.
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:44.820]  They seized all the surveillance cameras from surrounding businesses in the YMCA and they
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.940]  just stick him in that supermax.
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:54.620]  He gets out a couple hours a week to stand in a tiny courtyard where he can see the sky.
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:14:01.900]  He talks to no one else, jail guards slide the food under and every time he gets to talk
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:07.180]  to somebody he goes, McVeigh was black ops special forces there to set up militia groups.
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:10.900]  He didn't want to go out with the bombing and he came to the house and told me that's
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:12.380]  why I'm here.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:19.020]  And then we have all the documents where he was high level infiltrator, you know, highly
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:25.220]  decorated in the in work for Swartz cough, all the rest of it put into an intelligence
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.940]  infiltration operation.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:32.460]  We know the name of the German National Intelligence Officer, the FBI agents, the ATF officers
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:39.500]  in a team, we have the whole thing from every angle, we know exactly what happened.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:43.940]  And you notice he's in a supermax all because McVeigh basically ran to his house and told
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:47.260]  him and cashed some stuff there and said, if anything happens to me, this is what's
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.940]  going on.
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:49.940]  I'm being shut up.
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:54.700]  I'm going to try to stop the bombing and they might not have even burned McVeigh.
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:58.820]  They were probably just going to blame the white supremacist Elohim City, but McVeigh's
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:04.140]  like Tony Montana in the end of Scarface where he goes, you think I'm a worm like you?
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:05.940]  You think I'm going to kill kids?
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:08.100]  I told you, no women, no kids.
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.980]  And that's what happened to Tim McVeigh.
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:12.460]  All right, let's go to Chris in Texas.
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:13.460]  Thanks for holding.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:17.180]  And then we'll go to Donald, Jonathan, Captain America and others.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.780]  Go ahead, Chris, you're on the air.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.780]  Hi, Alex.
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:23.420]  It's a pleasure to speak with you.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:29.940]  You know, just, I believe, just as a basic point, our veterans deserve more than memorials.
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:33.580]  I think they deserve the truth.
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:41.540]  And basically when it comes to patriotism, patriotism isn't just an allegiance to say
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:45.620]  the American people, if you're American, it's an allegiance.
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:49.580]  It's also an allegiance to the principles that the country was built on.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:57.700]  So just some basic political theory, our founders devised a arrangement of governmental checks
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:03.500]  and balances all served to restrain each other's power.
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:10.500]  Washington described government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force like fire.
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:15.980]  Well, sure, they also described it like an arch where you have the opposing forces together
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.780]  that bring stability.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.420]  That's why everything is broken into threes.
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:22.140]  Everything has checks and balances on the other.
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:28.100]  Because if you get rid of checks and balances, it's game over, you're enslaved.
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:35.100]  That's why, because of our checks and balances, and the authors, well, the authors of the
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:39.020]  Constitution understood that phenomenon and they understood political power being the
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.980]  greatest power on earth.
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:46.180]  So they also understood that it's extremely dangerous unless it's confined.
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:50.580]  And they had a dream of being able to compete in an open market because the real reason
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:57.820]  George Washington went to war, he wrote about this, was because he couldn't ever run his
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:04.740]  own business, he had to go do all the work and then have a lord over him that was able
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:07.740]  to get all the contracts and everything.
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:12.900]  You couldn't manufacture firearms, you couldn't manufacture furniture, you couldn't manufacture
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:18.100]  anything that was a finished good, you couldn't get clothing, you couldn't make carriages,
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:25.180]  you had to buy everything from England and then buy it through the aristocracy that was
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:31.020]  in the colonies and they were, everybody was so sick of monopolies.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.060]  And that was the real reason that this happened.
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:39.820]  I mean, much greater men like Benjamin Franklin, who invented over a thousand things.
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:44.740]  I mean, Benjamin Franklin probably had like a 200 IQ and he was a womanizer in the whole
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:48.140]  nine yards and probably part of the Illuminati as well.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:54.820]  But the point is that they did not like royalty, they did not like people being given things,
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:57.140]  they were amazing.
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:58.380]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:59.380]  Absolutely.
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:02.820]  And I believe that's why the globalist plan must be stopped.
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:07.980]  If all power is vested in a single international authority, what force except God himself
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:11.900]  could save us from the abuse is certain to follow.
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:16.940]  You know, that's why our country has never really experienced the genocide or police
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:19.700]  state terror like other parts of the world.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:24.220]  Can you imagine foreigners would come here before the war and after and they'd say being
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:28.220]  in the presence of like George Washington and people was like they could hardly stand
[01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:30.100]  being in the room whether it was so strong.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:36.580]  The king of England, when George Washington refused to be king, said George Washington
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:40.940]  is the greatest man in the world.
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:42.740]  That's who founded this country.
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:46.260]  That's why there's not movies about him, nobody knows about him, he's just some old
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:50.700]  guy on a picture on the wall because there's power in that.
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:51.700]  In honor.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:58.260]  I mean, our founders were so honorable even in their day they were admired worldwide.
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:01.620]  And that's why they're so demonized because they were so special.
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:03.420]  They understood world history.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:09.260]  Well, they'd also they'd also all also they'd been in three wars in the last 20 years.
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:12.700]  So they were intellectuals, they were smart, they were inventors.
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:16.380]  The rock stars then were how many languages can you speak?
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.340]  What can you invent?
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:23.060]  And if somebody smarts off to you, will you go out in the road with a sword and hack each
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:24.740]  other to death?
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.420]  I mean, I mean, they were just super badass.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:31.660]  I mean, we think of somebody like John Wayne, an actor is really manly and he was a cool
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:36.740]  guy, but he was nothing compared to the founding fathers, you know, and that's the whole issue
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:41.300]  here is that we need to discover true honor again.
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:45.900]  And then we'll understand death before dishonor, death before we'll be slaves, then we won't
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:50.020]  be afraid anymore, then we'll have the strength that takes and the leadership it takes to
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.620]  turn the tide against evil.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:57.580]  I bless you, Chris, Jordan, Donald, Captain America, Chris and others stay with us.
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:02.420]  So Mark and I are out at the range shooting our AR-15 rifles built from AR-15 kits from
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:03.920]  Guns80.com.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:07.340]  When Dave walks up and he says, Hey, did you guys hear about Jade Helm?
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:10.780]  You know, the government doesn't care about the Posse Comitatus Act and Jade Helm, the
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:13.420]  troops are going to come and they may come after us and blah, blah, blah.
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:18.180]  And I'm thinking, Oh my God, dude, look, I take a 30 shot magazine, I put it in my AR-15
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:21.260]  built from a kit from Guns80.com, I unload it on the target.
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:27.620]  Jade Helm, I mean, really Guns80.com, Guns80.com, Guns80.com, go now.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.020]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:32.700]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:33.700]  IRAs?
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:37.700]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.300]  of gold for your retirement.
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:42.740]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:47.660]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:53.460]  Look at left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:57.140]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:00.500]  I love our city, I want all of you here flying, flying, flying.
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:05.860]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:10.020]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:12.780]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:18.100]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:22.620]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:26.940]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:27.940]  drugs.
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:31.980]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:34.020]  that children would actually like and take.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:38.140]  We worked with the lean manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:41.740]  bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:46.980]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:49.500]  essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:59.700]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:01.220]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:03.380]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?

[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.580]  Come and take it.
[01:22:56.580 --> 01:23:00.980]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:04.660]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:05.660]  in a toxic colon.
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:09.860]  The toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease and
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:13.340]  a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:16.020]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:19.940]  I've taken whey protein products for years and I've never noticed results I have with
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:20.940]  your product.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:23.860]  I've suffered with thoughts, constipation most of my life.
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:27.540]  Within a few days of taking one world away, I noticed a dramatic change.
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:31.900]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:35.620]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:39.060]  But I've noticed in the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore and the foot pain
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:40.060]  is gone.
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:43.540]  I'm just finishing up the five pound top I ordered and just got off the phone ordering
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.540]  more.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:45.540]  I love your product.
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:46.540]  Thank you.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:47.540]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:52.780]  That's 888-988-3325 or visit 1worldway.com.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.780]  That's 1world.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:24:07.460]  That's 1-888-325-325.
[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:08.460]  All right, here's what's going on.
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:14.800]  I haven't seen a brother who art thou since it came out.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:15.800]  That's a good movie.
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:21.580]  I need to watch that again.
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:30.580]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:38.180]  Central Standard Time.
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:42.740]  And then, of course, we will return this Sunday, Lord willing, with nothing for granted, 4
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:43.740]  to 6 p.m.
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:44.740]  Central.
[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:51.060]  I do want to remind the listeners that we have the establishment breathing down our
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:52.220]  necks like never before.
[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.220]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:54.220]  I asked for it.
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:57.420]  I've told everybody on air that I'm committed.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:00.540]  I've told everybody on air that we're going to go with the enemy's juggler.
[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:03.460]  I've told everybody that we're going to try to really pull out all the stops and really
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:06.380]  expose what they're doing.
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:10.040]  And I've told the listeners and everybody else that we are preparing very soon to launch
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:15.260]  on satellites and to go on different cable and TV systems.
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:20.340]  And I expect the globalists to even come after us worse.
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:27.380]  But in that conflict, in that struggle, in that animating contest, in my heart, I trust
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:32.660]  in God's providence that we will come through the fire and be stronger on the other side.
[01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:38.780]  Even if I'm not there after that contest.
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:43.060]  Everything we've done, everything I've talked about, everything we've laid out is a compendium
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:49.220]  of work, a testament that will stand against the enemy for all time.
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:54.100]  And as things get more serious and hardcore, you're going to notice that this show, quote,
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.020]  gets more credible.
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.540]  We're beyond evergreen, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:03.700]  That's a term in books, in literature, in film, in art.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:08.340]  Is it evergreen?
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:12.500]  And true art is struggle to produce art that is evergreen, that touches the human spirit
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.500]  forever.
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.420]  We know the enemy's battle plan.
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:17.260]  We understand what they're doing.
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:21.460]  We know how to beat them.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:27.500]  It's educate the public on how horrible this plan is and get them to admit it's real.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:32.620]  And tyranny will vanish like phantoms at dawn, to quote Thomas Jefferson.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.620]  What did Jefferson say?
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:36.700]  Educate and enlighten the public on the principles of liberty.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:43.820]  And tyranny will, and tyrants will vanish like phantoms at dawn, I believe, is the paraphrase
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:44.820]  quote.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:48.260]  Jefferson's quote on phantoms at dawn.
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:51.420]  Let's go to another call here, Jordan in Michigan, then Donald.
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:52.420]  Go ahead.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.420]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:57.900]  I've been listening to you for about two years now.
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:01.260]  I felt compelled to call in for the first time today.
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:08.900]  And just congratulate all the employees, because I believe that our calls to Fox News had something
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:13.220]  to do for sure with you getting on Alan Combs.
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:18.100]  And I just, that's the power that we have when we join together like that.
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:19.100]  Sure.
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.900]  I mean, Alan Combs is on over 100 radio stations.
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:23.940]  It's a moderately syndicated show.
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:28.980]  And he ridicules me a lot, but I was happy to go on there because it's live.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:32.220]  But I still haven't been invited on the five and other people that want to sit there and
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:33.220]  trash me.
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:35.180]  Why don't any of these shows want to invite me on?
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:36.820]  Because they're scared.
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:43.180]  And again, ABC wanted to play games and wanted to act like they were going to have me on
[01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:45.900]  the show, but then mess it all up so they could have their cake and eat it too.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:50.540]  I mean, it just sounds like something that comes out of the squirrely brain of Stephanopoulos,
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:51.540]  doesn't it?
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:55.980]  Well, I have to agree with you and it's hilarious that he made those claims about you.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:59.660]  And now he's in hot water himself just days afterwards.
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:04.500]  But I thought you had a great interview with Combs and to his credit, he gave you a chance
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:05.500]  to speak.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.380]  I think it was nothing like Pierce Morgan interview.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:09.820]  You were cool and calm.
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:14.860]  And I think you woke some people up and I'd like to greet everybody who's tuned in today
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:21.900]  from having listened to that interview and just encourage them to see the world in a
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:24.900]  different way because things are crazy out there.
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:25.900]  Absolutely.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:26.900]  God bless you sir.
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:27.900]  Anything else?
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:28.900]  Nope.
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:29.900]  That's it.
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:30.900]  Thank you.
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:31.900]  Thank you.
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:32.900]  I want to go to Donald, but I don't want to cut him short.
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.380]  I'm going to come back to Donald and Captain America, Chris and Bubbles, and then I'm going
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:39.060]  to shut down calls for a while and we'll still have folks on hold.
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:44.140]  I'm going to get to this Al Qaeda situation, this ISIS situation being run by the West
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.140]  and more.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:48.340]  I'm not going to talk about it now.
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:55.260]  But I had a very exciting discussion with Michael Savage last night and I had some other
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:58.900]  very exciting discussions yesterday evening as well with some other people.
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:07.060]  There is a lot of really neat stuff going on right now.
[01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:14.180]  People really understand the big picture and America is really starting to get just how
[01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:16.620]  serious the situation is.
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:23.060]  That's all I can tell you.
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:32.660]  I can also assure you that we've hit the zeitgeist and I don't say that with any pleasure.
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:39.380]  I do say it with pride of the effectiveness of what we've done in God's providence, but
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:42.900]  I'm ready to take my elixir and go to the next level, but just to understand if anything
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:45.300]  happens to me or this operation, I knew it was coming.
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:46.860]  The enemy didn't win.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.140]  We're on the march.
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.540]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:57.580]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:02.180]  You've probably seen plenty of pundits and late night talk show hosts make fun of parents
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:04.260]  who are skeptical of vaccines.
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:08.820]  And even though it takes a room full of writers to produce one grade school level joke that
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:13.220]  couldn't get an audience to laugh without an LED panel directing them to do so, they
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:18.300]  don't seem too keen on exploring the why some parents are concerned, such as vaccines
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:23.940]  maiming around 30 children in Mexico, two of whom died and zero of the funny guys want
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:24.940]  to talk about.
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:30.140]  Or how about the kids in Syria dead from vaccines courtesy of the World Health Organization?
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:34.180]  What you may be thinking, well, you never hear about that kind of stuff here in America.
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:39.020]  Well, that's because Reagan passed a law stating that you can't sue the vaccine makers.
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:43.700]  So to all the guys who can't tell a joke without reading it off a teleprompter or having your
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:48.260]  producer whisper in your ear, stick to making your designer suits look bad and leave people's
[01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:50.340]  children the hell alone.
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:57.540]  And while you're at it, check out the reports on infowars.com.

[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:39.780]  We're all riders on the storm, riders on the storm, into this house we're born, into
[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:51.540]  this world we're thrown, like a dog without a bone, an actor out alone, riders on the
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:34:07.140]  storm, there's a killer on the road, his brain is squirming like a toad, take a long holiday,
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:17.340]  let your children play, let your children play, if you give this man a ride, sweet memory
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:24.500]  will die, the system doesn't want us to have discernment, they call it discrimination,
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:29.980]  they like going to a restaurant and the food's bad and they say it's racist, or it's hateful
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:35.860]  if you don't keep eating there and you're like, the hamburger patty was frozen in the
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:42.260]  middle, or there was a roach in my soup, shut up, no there was a conspiracy theorist, here
[01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:48.500]  it is, that's all this is, they want you to be trained to be bullied to submit to whatever
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:54.420]  new bull the system brings up, we're going to go to Donald and a few other callers here
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:59.300]  and then get into this breakdown on Al Qaeda, now the public's starting to wake up the fact
[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:10.180]  the west is funding it, but this morning I had come into town to work out with my personal
[01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:15.420]  trainer and I'd gotten on the elliptical and then I was lifting weights and then I was
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:24.340]  leaving and I just saw this guy walking with kind of a prison yard, just bizarre insane
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:35.380]  looking swagger and I went in a shop and grabbed something and came out and there were all
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:41.700]  these cops and then I ended up separately getting a call from one of my friends who
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:47.700]  had seen what had happened, it just so happened, and that he had assaulted some woman, I remember
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:53.620]  when I saw that guy minutes before I thought that guy is up to no good, but see I should
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:36:00.100]  have just gone no, it was a white guy, but he was acting all thuggish, white, black, whatever,
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:08.340]  it's thug culture, and if I was walking down the street with my children and a guy like
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:15.260]  that started walking up towards me, I'm not embarrassed to act like I'm concerned and
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:19.140]  start getting ready into a fighting stance when that person comes by me and I'm going
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:24.660]  to walk out of their way, but I'm not going to act scared while I do it, I'm going to
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:31.540]  sit there and walk on to that person and get ready, and then see I'm the guy who gets left
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:36.020]  alone by the thugs, I've sat there and seen it when a family acts a little scared or something
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:40.660]  then the thugs come over and say hey can I have $50, because they're not mugging you,
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:45.900]  they're like I really need it, and I've had white guys and I've had black guys do that
[01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:53.820]  to me, I really want that money, well I'm a big black guy a few months ago and I was
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:57.860]  just like dude you're really joking around, you kept yelling at me, bearing his teeth
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:03.340]  and I went, I just started to step back, just got ready, and the guy got mad and ran off,
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:07.860]  but I mean I just got ready, got the fighting stance, I sat there while I was doing it,
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:12.220]  kept doing it and I just went alright, I'm in a fighting stance right now, the politically
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:16.180]  correct people would never do that, guy did that to Joe Beggs a few weeks ago, he beat
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:26.780]  the living deluxe out of him downtown, this is what it is to be slaves, and that same
[01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:31.060]  thuggery you see from somebody on the street is what the government's doing to us now,
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:36.260]  and it's illegitimate, and I am in a fighting stance with this government, not because I'm
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:42.940]  looking for a fight, but I'm not gonna roll over in the ditch, I'm gonna fight this corrupt
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:47.620]  system and everything I got, and the people have power, if you realize the power you've
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:53.500]  got we can turn back the tide very quickly, and I'm telling you something about the fighting
[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:58.540]  spirit, the enemy miscalculates because they're cowards, they think that if they destroy
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:03.220]  some of the patriots, or if we lose some of the first battles, if this gets physical
[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:11.900]  that they're winning, they're losing, that's why they're gonna stage terror attacks because
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:17.980]  some of their operatives know they need to act like we started it first, but this is
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:23.900]  not 1995 where you're gonna do this and nobody's gonna basically blow the whistle, of course
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:30.700]  I say that, General Parton was there within two days of them blowing up Oklahoma City,
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:41.300]  Star General, former head of Air Force Weapons Development, three PhDs in engineering, developed
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:49.420]  most of the weapons you see today, continuous rod warheads, you name it, they did press
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:55.100]  conferences showing the blast points, and where the bomb was, and all of it, can you
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:59.380]  imagine when the globalists pull something next time, you think an internet kill switch
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:06.020]  is gonna protect you, you're done, you're done, you have the motive, you have the history,
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:14.820]  you have the means, and we're telling everybody how you operate, so go ahead and try something,
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:19.160]  you think you're gonna pull some martial law scenario and whack out some patriots and
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:24.780]  scare everybody, no you're just gonna take the handcuffs off and the restraint's gonna
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:28.900]  be over, and if you think the patriots are dumb enough to go out and just have a war
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:35.100]  with the police, you're gonna send the police on missions that starts that war, but that'll
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:44.060]  just be getting over an obstacle to the target.
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:50.980]  Go ahead bankers, go ahead New World Order people, you better hide in Switzerland and
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:58.860]  Luxembourg and Monte Carlo and in Grand Cayman and in the Cook Islands and in your airstrips
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:03.780]  in New Zealand where you're already running to, because let me tell you, you are never
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:09.740]  going to get away with what you've done, we're calling you all out right now ahead of time,
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:16.220]  so just understand, you are lit up, you got light on you, everybody knows who you are,
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:24.900]  and you go ahead and play your hand, you go ahead and try it, I mean really, I'm just
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:31.820]  a citizen cop here, with a bullhorn telling the criminals what the hostage is inside,
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:37.020]  you're never getting out of here, you're never getting away with it, yeah you're gonna be
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:40.740]  going to prison but it's a lot better than what you're gonna get if you hurt those hostages,
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:49.820]  now you just think that through, and that's all I'm doing right here, I'm just bullhorn
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:55.340]  right at you going, we see you, we know who you are, we know your tricks, we know everything
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:41:03.500]  about you, we've been watching you for a long time, and all I am is just one little
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:10.140]  place where this liberty movement emerges above the waves, under the waves, wolf packs
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:28.860]  of patriots, loaded for info war, and for everything else, ready, let's go to Captain
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:33.860]  America, no, Donald's first, Donald Minnesota, thanks for holding, you're a trooper, go ahead,
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:39.660]  Alex I pray for you every single day, especially to the Holy Spirit, thank you, I need it,
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:47.580]  oh boy so we all need it, are you aware that when the border was finalized between Mexico
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:56.900]  and America that Mexico offered to cede the mouth of the Colorado and that finger of territory
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:42:03.700]  called Bahia of California, are you aware of that, I did know that there was some negotiations
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:11.700]  for that area, yes, yes, well you see, if you look at the map, and you understand that
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:22.060]  the rear end is a very poor border, and if we wanted to, we could easily annex that territory
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:29.740]  that today would be worth billions, the mouth of the Colorado would be worth billions, and
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:38.740]  we allowed them to have that to ensure that they would, I'm sure would secure the borders
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:47.620]  for us on their side, maybe you could look up the entire treaty, now before I go, did
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:55.620]  you hear about the big operation at the Mayo Clinic today, no I didn't what happened, doctors
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:43:04.340]  cut off a man's left side, he's all right now, thank you for my call Alex, I didn't
[01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:09.340]  even get that joke at first, thank you for the call, let's talk to Captain America,
[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:17.660]  go ahead you're on the air, welcome, yes Alex, glad to talk to you, it's been a while, I
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:24.100]  have a couple things I want to talk about today, and one thing is my friend Adam Kochash
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:32.020]  is going to be at Brave New Books tonight to talk about his thing, and I got a hold
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:39.140]  of Joe Biggs and let him know, and I was hoping he could come down and interview Mr. Kochash
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:46.100]  about maybe J. Allen, his thoughts on it, and so on, and also I wanted to ask you if
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:53.220]  you have read the book, the Red Amendment, have you heard about it and the Texas National
[01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:54.220]  Movement?
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:44:00.860]  I'm aware of the Texas National Movement, I know that Texas could secede but that would
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:09.100]  need to be done on the legislature or by a referendum of the state, not by people meeting
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:16.900]  in East Texas or South Texas or wherever, and announcing that they've elected themselves
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:22.060]  the presidents or whatever, and you know because the guy's got a bass boat, he's an admiral,
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:27.540]  because the guy's got a tractor, he's an army commander, that was done pretty much by the
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:38.460]  establishment giving them attention in the 90s and lately to discredit the real secession
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:42.700]  movement, and I don't particularly want a secession movement, I'd like to have my republic
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:49.940]  back, but if the republic is captured the entire country, then Texas could pull out
[01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:55.700]  to reform the United States with hopes to work with other states to reconstitute the
[01:44:55.700 --> 01:45:02.500]  republic, and so I am for emergency secession, but only because the United States no longer
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:06.940]  exist, we're under a new corporate body, the North American Union, part of the trilateral
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:12.460]  world government program.
[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:21.860]  What this book, I've been reading it and what this book is about is mostly exposing the
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:27.820]  myth about the amendment, especially the 14th amendment, how it has stripped us of our right,
[01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:34.100]  because we have the Bill of Rights, and then after the Civil War they wanted to do what
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:38.860]  they called Reconstruction, but what it was was an invasion of troops to take over the
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:44.220]  south, and then the 14th amendment actually stripped the rights of all Americans, black,
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:50.340]  white, whatever, so that we are now servants and slaves of the United States government.
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:55.180]  Yes, and that's why they killed Lincoln, because Lincoln wasn't going to go along with that,
[01:45:55.180 --> 01:46:01.700]  he wasn't going to go along with Reconstruction being violent, and so they executed him and
[01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:08.340]  then engaged in a decade long looting operation of the south, and that's absolutely true.
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:16.060]  It's similar to what happened to Germany during the whole Versailles Treaty, it's similar
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:21.540]  to what the west did to China, where they controlled it for a long period of time over
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:27.740]  a century ago, so good to hear from you, Captain America, appreciate that call.
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:32.300]  I want to go to Chris and Bubbles and Dave and Steve and many others that are holding,
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:41.460]  but first let me get to that report I was talking about earlier.
[01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:50.980]  Now, everybody knows, I mean it's even on mainstream news, even Senator Cruz talked
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:55.420]  about it, even Rand Paul talked about it, that we shouldn't aid al-Qaeda in Syria, that
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:47:01.300]  most of the rebel fighters are al-Qaeda, that we shouldn't be their air force, everybody
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:04.780]  pretty much remembers that from two years ago.
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:10.100]  So the Council on Foreign Relations and others were very upset and said, we've got a problem,
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:13.540]  the fact that we're working with Saudi Arabia and NATO to take over the Middle East using
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:21.380]  these jihadis, it's coming out, the military's very upset, because after all this is al-Qaeda,
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:26.180]  so they changed name to ISIS last year and a half and had them resupply by invading Iraq
[01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:30.460]  and now they're back in Syria taking the country over again.
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:34.380]  Now that Russia's busy fighting in Ukraine instead of backing up Syria, it's a proxy
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:38.260]  war against Russia, that's part of it.
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:46.660]  But I was watching at about 8.45 this morning Fox News as I said and they had a report about
[01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:52.300]  Obama is telling us and the media not to show ISIS vehicles, armored vehicles and stuff
[01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:57.260]  because now they don't have those, they've been greatly defeated and they don't go around
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:48:02.140]  in convoys anymore, which by the way isn't true, but you don't have the President telling
[01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:06.580]  media what to show, just like you don't have the President's wife telling school kids
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:08.140]  what to eat with their lunches.
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:13.140]  But then I was sitting there watching and I went, that's not what this is, they don't
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:19.260]  like the fact that it was Toyota trucks from the US that were US special forces, it's the
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:28.940]  exact trucks, the way they're designed and augmented in the US, it's MRAP armored vehicles
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:34.220]  and it is armored Humvees, the types that got sent in later when folks complained about
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:37.020]  them not having enough armor.
[01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:43.420]  And then here's this headline military.com from last year Pentagon to send 250 MRAPs
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:48.260]  back to Iraq to fight ISIS, but the Iraqi government has come out including the President
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:51.140]  last month and said no, they're delivering these to ISIS.
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:55.700]  I was watching at the start of the news piece when they said we're going to come back actually
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:49:00.180]  before the news piece and it showed the MRAPs and stuff.
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:05.740]  I mean that's how dumb they think we are, is that they're showing us all this in our
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:06.740]  face.
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:09.060]  Let's go ahead and go to part of that Fox News piece.
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:12.820]  So meanwhile as ISIS gains new ground, we're talking about the pressing that they're doing
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:19.780]  on Ramadi right now, the Obama administration is pressing a point of its own about optics.
[01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:25.260]  It is reportedly asking television networks to stop airing this video that you see, that
[01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:27.780]  you've seen quite a bit, admittedly.
[01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:34.820]  They say this is the old picture of the way that ISIS was moving in convoys in broad daylight.
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:37.100]  They say these pictures are misleading.
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:43.660]  Instead they want us to air pictures of U.S. trainers, of Iraqi soldiers, and also what
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:50.660]  they say is closer to the way that ISIS now travels, quote, one Toyota speeding down the
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:53.820]  road by itself at night with the headlights off.
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.820]  Okay, let's just stop for a minute.
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:56.820]  There's two narratives here.
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:59.220]  I didn't go review that beforehand, so it's my fault.
[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:03.380]  I'm going to tell the crew something about the DVR back there.
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:05.180]  That's not the clip.
[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:08.500]  The clip is before they go to break.
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:14.180]  To come back with the piece you just talked about, they show the big MRAPs, 10 seconds
[01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:15.180]  long.
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:20.620]  Now, that did show the Armored Humvee and some of that stuff, but we'll get that clip and
[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:26.420]  I'm going to play it coming up.
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:34.900]  Now before I go any further on this, now we're being told we're going to be attacked here
[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:41.900]  domestically by these groups, when again they're the very groups empowered by the West and
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:49.180]  who the West, from the U.S. to Germany, from England to Canada, allowed them to recruit
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:56.860]  inside the West to do this, so the word needs to be gotten out on this.
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:51:02.260]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S. politicians
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:05.020]  argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.

[01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:01.620]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:06.340]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:08.820]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:12.220]  We're going to go to Chris and others here in a moment.
[01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:15.700]  I have not even begun to get into large portions of the news.
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:20.060]  I'm going to do that for a while when we start the next hour.
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:22.980]  And then back to phone calls.
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:28.100]  Just briefly, we are funded by the high quality products mainly that we sell, that in PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:32.980]  memberships and some of our online sponsors.
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:38.380]  We really do have groundbreaking, powerful, nutraceuticals from high quality colloidal
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:43.740]  silver to super male and super female vitality to prostaguard what we believe is the strongest

[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:04.980]  heard the rape reviews, try them out for yourself and know you're also supporting the very tip
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:08.860]  of the spear in the fight for freedom.
[01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:11.140]  It's war bonds, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:13.860]  And also you hear a lot of talk about water filters out there.
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:19.100]  We carry, according to the different mainline labs that have tested it, the very best water
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:24.940]  filtration gravity fed systems out there, Pro 1, G2 systems, clearly filtered and others
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:28.300]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:33.900]  And they're less than the major competitors that aren't as good or I would carry the other
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:34.900]  brands, folks.
[01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:36.980]  I mean, it's like the seed center.
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:41.140]  We've got eight different high quality non-GMO heirloom companies that are competitively
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:42.140]  priced.

[01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:47.460]  what we're into.
[01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:50.060]  It's real simple.
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:53.460]  And we've got eight different brands there because they're all great.
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:56:04.420]  Well, not so with the water filters, InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139, see the side-by-side comparisons
[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:11.700]  of the filters we sell versus other leading brands at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:15.380]  Coming up, I'm going to play the video, school orders student to remove offensive U.S. flag
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:16.380]  from truck.
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:21.260]  And when I first started reporting on this about a decade ago, people thought I was lying.
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:25.060]  And I'd be reading NBC News out of San Francisco and they'd go, that's not true, Alex, you've
[01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:26.700]  gone too far.
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:31.500]  Kids are allowed to have American flags on their shirts.
[01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:32.660]  No they're not.
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:37.780]  Federal judge just ruled a month ago, no, that's evil because they're getting rid of
[01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:41.100]  free speech selectively.
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:44.900]  Now the schools have got free speech to teach your six-year-old how to do stuff I can't
[01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:47.940]  mention on the radio.
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:51.180]  And you've got the free speech to sit down and shut up and worship world government.
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:52.380]  The truth is it's all a bluff.
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:54.020]  We do still have free speech.
[01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:57.580]  There is no law to take vaccines and if they pass one, I'm not following it.
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:56:59.060]  The line in the sand is being approached.
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:00.900]  Oh, that's just what your line in the sand is.
[01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:03.820]  In fact, the next round of callers, what is your line in the sand?
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:04.820]  What is your line in the sand?
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:05.820]  800-259-9231.
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:11.420]  You've got a minute and 40 seconds, Christian, South Carolina, where they're banning American
[01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:13.260]  flags on kids' trucks.
[01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:14.260]  Go ahead.
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.260]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:22.420]  I was calling about, for some reason they're bringing in Syrian, they say they're refugees.
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:28.780]  On the thing it says, 50% of them would be considered our Christian brothers and sisters
[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:31.420]  and I think it's a bullcrap number.
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:32.660]  Yeah, I mean you've got to love it.
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:37.060]  Our government, I saw this in the news, finances the destruction of Syria and then brings in
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:41.100]  a bunch of jihadis, some of them are Christians and says, oh, we've got to protect them.
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:42.100]  Yeah.
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:43.100]  Go ahead.
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:47.940]  And then at the same time, in the same county that you were talking about with this flag,
[01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:52.860]  they have this place called Islam Bill and only Islam can live there.
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:53.860]  Yep.
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:59.780]  All over the country, there are Muslim-only communities but you don't see any lawsuits
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:01.780]  though or any groups going after them.
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:05.380]  But if a Christian community tries to form or you say, I'm only going to sell my house
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:09.660]  to a Christian or this church only hires Christians and you don't want to hire a church
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:16.860]  Satan person, I'm not kidding, then you are sued because Christians don't have any rights.
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:17.860]  We are scum.
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:18.860]  You didn't know that?
[01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:19.860]  I knew that.
[01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:22.140]  I knew that all the way.
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:27.940]  But I just, I feel it's really crazy because George Soros is funding it.
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:28.940]  You know, I did see that.
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:33.060]  George Soros is a very, stay there, I want you to finish up any other points you got
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:38.140]  and then we're going to go to Bubbles and others, stay with us, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:47.460]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.

[02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:03.500]  We're now on to hour number three.
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:04.500]  Big Brother.
[02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:05.500]  Mainstream Media.
[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:06.500]  Mainstream Media.
[02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:08.300]  Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:09.900]  You want answers?
[02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:11.500]  Well so does he.
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:19.300]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:31.580]  All right, we're continuing with your phone calls.
[02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:32.580]  I never got to it.
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:37.780]  I want to hear that clip where the student confronts Jeff Bush.
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:47.500]  So abortion group labels not killing 20-week-old babies as inhumane and that's a close quote.
[02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:53.140]  Not putting children in guest chambers is evil too, I guess, according to these people.
[02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:58.300]  But right now, finishing up with Chris, Chris, I knew that the U.S. government was bringing
[02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:04.260]  in a bunch of Syrians and the word was they were using the claim that they were refugees
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:10.940]  from a Syrian conflict that our government helped fund to bring in people to be trained
[02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:16.820]  here but now we see that George Soros pledged $1 million to support robust global response
[02:01:16.820 --> 02:01:23.500]  to ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria of the $3.8 million to bring these people in.
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:26.700]  So that is simply incredible, isn't it?
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:32.300]  And again, I'm not against bringing real refugees in but do you think our government
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:35.460]  is financing the takedown of Syria?
[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:38.900]  Would then actually want to help the Christians, they're slaughtering.
[02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:40.380]  What do you make of that, Chris?
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:43.140]  I honestly say it's bill per question.
[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:52.580]  Hey, Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee, anybody, anybody, honestly, would go look at, I'd say a 10.
[02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:56.140]  God talks about it being there on me, his arm.
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:57.140]  Hello?
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:58.140]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:01:59.140]  I'm listening to you.
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:00.140]  Okay.
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:02.500]  I'm sorry, I just got quiet, I'm apologize.
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:05.300]  Well, yeah, it'll be quiet if I'm not talking over you.
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:06.300]  Yeah, okay.
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:08.900]  Yeah, I'll talk over you, does that make it better?
[02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:10.500]  I'll just talk to you and you talk.
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:12.580]  No, I'm joking, go ahead.
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:17.860]  No, it just really wowed me about the whole thing.
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:19.860]  It's biblical.
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:29.340]  And then you sit back and you think, then now Fort Bragg is working with Columbia, Richland
[02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:33.620]  County, which is only, like I want to say, a county away from York County?
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:38.020]  Yes, for those that don't know, they were doing gun confiscation drills basically a
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:39.020]  few days ago.
[02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:40.020]  We covered that.
[02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:41.340]  Thank you for the call.
[02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:45.380]  The people running things are bold enough to try to get the military prepared for a
[02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:46.540]  takeover.
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:50.660]  We don't know, Jade Helm is that takeover.
[02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:52.860]  Certainly now that everybody's watching it and looking at it, I don't think it's going
[02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:57.740]  to be the case, but if I was thinking like the globalist, who I know have been preparing
[02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:02.100]  the public that the patriots are going to attack the military, you would then take this
[02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:08.660]  story, hype it up, pretend that I'm calling for violence, have violence, which is either
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:13.500]  stirred up or manufactured, and then use that to demonize anybody that's against a military
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:16.340]  rollout on the streets of America.
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:23.340]  We also have the military doing wellness checks door to door that are really knock and talk.
[02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:27.700]  And I mentioned knock and talk last week and I saw a bunch of emails saying, Alex, there's
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:32.100]  no such thing as that and police aren't coming to people's doors asking about what guns they
[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:33.100]  own.
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:39.100]  Strangely enough, I haven't seen any news about knock and talk in about a year, but
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:43.420]  I know it's still going on in all 50 states federally funded and they'll give police departments
[02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:48.860]  sometimes millions of dollars for cameras or uniforms or cars or whatever the case is,
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:55.060]  but written into the stipulation of the contract is you will do X number of knock and talks
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:59.420]  with X number of officers and boy in Dallas, it didn't fly.
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:04.220]  They went into the rich areas, knocked on thousands of doors over and over again during
[02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:09.740]  the day asking rich housewives to come in and inspect their husband's guns.
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:18.180]  And so now that we mentioned that, will you guys search engine on YouTube?
[02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:23.180]  Police do knock and talk for firearms and then do it on Google too and find me some
[02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:27.620]  articles because I understand why new listeners tune in and think that's made up.
[02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:28.620]  That's crazy.
[02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:33.180]  There's no way because I mean, that's tyranny, isn't it?
[02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:34.180]  We've got footage.
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:35.180]  I know I've seen it.
[02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:39.700]  Years ago, we aired it in Boston where they don't take no for answer.
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:44.660]  They forced their way in at the knock and talks and of course you saw what happened after
[02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:46.060]  the Boston bombing.
[02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:47.060]  They did it to everybody.
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:49.380]  So it's just all about getting rid of the fourth amendment.
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:52.420]  So we'll, we'll find some knock and talk to, we're going to take more calls, stay with
[02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:53.420]  us.

[02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:25.220]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, Jacarie Jackson has got breaking news on the war against
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:27.220]  ammunition.
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:30.540]  Second amendment news coming up, I'm going to go to your phone calls, I'm going to get
[02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:34.900]  to the attack on the first amendment, Si Hur says he's not backing off anything he said
[02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:38.820]  about the bin Laden raid not being as they said it was, actually he is.
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:45.940]  She came out two years ago and said it was basically all false, 100% false and then he
[02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:53.340]  started backing off that, but the whole thing's fake, it was a body double being held there
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:56.460]  at the facility next door to the military base, the whole thing was totally staged.
[02:08:56.460 --> 02:09:01.660]  We've had the Navy Seal families on who had their children killed or sons killed and we
[02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:03.540]  know how the whole thing went down.
[02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:09.340]  Oh and I told you how it all went down within three months of it happening because they
[02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:13.940]  blew up the helicopter to get rid of the witnesses and then we got all the intel.
[02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:16.740]  No and look it all came out, see they're not invincible.
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:21.980]  I want to go to Bubbles and Dave and Steve and Wild and Corey and then that'll be it
[02:09:21.980 --> 02:09:26.980]  for calls for the day, but cutting to Jacarie Jackson real quick, Jacarie you've got a special
[02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:30.740]  report you're filing that we're going to premiere here at the bottom of the hour, they'll give
[02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:36.660]  us more analysis, but tell us what this pertains to with the second amendment.
[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:41.700]  Yes we have an article on the site, I believe Adon put it out, House Bill seeks to eliminate
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:46.700]  online ammo sales and this is a New Jersey representative, Ms. Coleman.
[02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:54.620]  She has HR22A3 which is basically the Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2015 and what
[02:09:54.620 --> 02:10:00.380]  this will do Alex is require face to face purchases of ammunition.
[02:10:00.380 --> 02:10:05.340]  So they can register the fact that you own ammo like Wal-Mart and others have been trying
[02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:10.420]  to get people's names and info and the reason this is important is this legislation is getting
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:15.380]  introduced all over the country, just like the forced inoculation started three months
[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:22.300]  ago in California as legislation is now in more than 40 state legislatures moving its
[02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:27.580]  way through, the fight is on, it's getting voted down in some states being passed in
[02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:32.980]  others, so thank you so much Jacarie, we'll get details on that coming up at the bottom
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:35.100]  of the hour with you in studio.
[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:36.100]  Thank you.
[02:10:36.100 --> 02:10:37.100]  Thank you.
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:45.580]  I'm going to go back to your calls but I never got to this last hour when I was getting
[02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:52.300]  into the fact that Al Qaeda has MRAPs that they supposedly got from the Iraqi military
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:58.500]  and we played a part of that newscast but we don't yet have the part that I wanted but
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:03.740]  as soon as we do get that, I'm reminding folks we're going to do that, kind of direct stuff
[02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:09.460]  just from here on the air, I'm going to integrate it in with this clip of Jeb Bush being confronted
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:15.980]  about his brother being involved helping basically expand Al Qaeda, so that is going to be coming
[02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:21.900]  up as well but right now let's go ahead and go to Bubbles in Utah, Bubbles, you're on
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:24.540]  the air, welcome.
[02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:27.980]  You know, be nice or I confiscate it, hello?
[02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:32.060]  Yeah, I'm having some audio problems Bubbles, were you talking to me just now?
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:34.420]  Yeah, I may bet, I'm going to be bet, okay, hello?
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:38.460]  I'm going to have to let you go, I'm going to have to let you go, your phone's got a
[02:11:38.460 --> 02:11:39.460]  problem.
[02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:42.220]  Dave in Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:48.620]  This here's Alex Jones, Ma got some snake oil for sale.
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:52.780]  That's what I thought, these are prank callers sometimes, we don't get prank callers very
[02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:59.900]  often but then they only come through in groups and that's what's starting to go on here because
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:03.820]  that's all the establishment does is they make fun of people in the west or the south
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:07.060]  and I guess because they're from the east they think they're smarter than everybody,
[02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:11.340]  I like folks from the east that are regular people, I don't like folks that put on the
[02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:20.820]  fake Atlantic action or the fake country club accents of how dare you not want to turn
[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:25.940]  your guns in, I'm going to have bodyguards but you're not going to have any guns.
[02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:32.820]  I'll tell you what, would you rather I speak in a slimy London accent for you, well that's
[02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:38.300]  make it sound like I was more intelligent, let's do that for a moment, Steve in Texas,
[02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:43.420]  I bet because you live in Texas you don't even have floors, you live on dirt floors
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:49.380]  and I would imagine that you sign your name as an ex, you leave your mark, you're part
[02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:58.820]  of those hillbillies for stewing themselves with spittoons and I would imagine that you're
[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:03.620]  a bitter clinger, what do you have to say today Steve about the backwardness of your
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:04.620]  state?
[02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:10.460]  Hey Alex I've been listening to you for about 15 years and I may sound like a hillbilly
[02:13:10.460 --> 02:13:14.620]  but my family's been in Texas since 1843 and I live in Bastrop County.
[02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:17.420]  Well what's wrong with having a Texas accent?
[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:23.260]  I get crap for it for years, the whole time I was in the military they called me Tex and
[02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:24.260]  everything else.
[02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:29.700]  What I called about it was not to take up too much of your time, I want to say today
[02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:36.980]  Fox's released some video footage of what's going on in the battle for Ramadi and those
[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:42.620]  guys are in black uniforms with patches on it, the uniforms are well taken care of, they
[02:13:42.620 --> 02:13:48.100]  wear a Kevlar helmet and they get a helmet cams on and they're using U.S. state weapons.
[02:13:48.100 --> 02:13:54.460]  I know and I mean I saw it this morning on Fox, if we don't have it today we'll have
[02:13:54.460 --> 02:14:00.940]  it on Sunday and I saw them on Fox and they got a different clip than what I wanted and
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:06.420]  that's my fault because I wasn't in there to tell them which clip but it's people in
[02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:13.500]  black uniforms with U.S. equipment and U.S. training with the whole Special Forces get
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:18.660]  up and they've got Special Forces Toyotas that were fitted for Special Forces, they got Special
[02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:24.820]  Forces equipment, they've got regular Army M-Raps, they've got everything and I'm going
[02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:30.140]  to get Joe Biggs to do a whole report on this tonight but absolutely here in fact I'm told
[02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:33.620]  now we do have the clip of the M-Rap, here it is.
[02:14:33.620 --> 02:14:37.460]  Alright, breaking his silence, ISIS releasing an audio tape, said to be from their leader
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:40.460]  who has not been seen from in months.
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:44.460]  Why this has American security analysts worried, that's going to be part of the hour, see that?
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:48.100]  So meanwhile as ISIS gains new ground, we're talking about the pressure that we're doing
[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:54.060]  on Ramadi right now, Special Forces Toyotas is pressing a point and news articles have
[02:14:54.060 --> 02:14:58.180]  been written by this by the Iraqi government where it shows the trucks that are armored
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:15:04.180]  the Toyotas and then it shows them being made in the U.S. a few years ago, I mean through
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:10.500]  Saudi Arabia, through Qatar, through Turkey, taxpayers are paying for ISIS, do you understand
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:17.380]  the guys with black flags are trained by the U.S. and trained by NATO and there is the
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:29.660]  M-Rap, a giant full-size armored truck flying two al-Qaeda flags and then I'm glad you mentioned
[02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:33.060]  this because I'm doing my elliptical this morning for just 30 minutes and I just kept
[02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:38.420]  and then it showed them in and I'm no soldier but I study this, it looked like U.S. Special
[02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:41.180]  Forces equipment but the uniforms were black.
[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:42.180]  Go ahead Steve.
[02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:48.540]  Oh yeah, now I was in the military, I was a hospital corpsman and I was with the Marine
[02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:52.700]  recon unit and also spent a little bit of time around the Navy SEAL so I know how these
[02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:59.180]  guys operate and they're tagging each other on the back, moving in those type of, so they
[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:03.700]  had American training but some of them aren't American people because they're not holding
[02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:08.100]  their rifles in the right position so some of them and they're all clean-shaven, they
[02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:13.500]  don't have fear and stuff like that but there's a guy in web here, he's got green web here
[02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:19.900]  over his black uniform and he's got a Kevlar helmet on, that guy's a team leader and he's
[02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:27.580]  U.S. trained, I can tell you right now, he's a Westerner.
[02:16:27.580 --> 02:16:34.820]  Well that's the word is they've got traitorous Special Forces retirees that are contractors
[02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:39.540]  that are leading these teams and they admit they've been in there leading the Free Syrian
[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:45.620]  Army against the Russians and so I did see that and again imagine my poor crew, they're
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:49.020]  trying to go through a whole hour of Fox from 8 o'clock this morning to try to find what
[02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:56.060]  I want but I did see that and I thought man that looks like Western trained people and
[02:16:56.060 --> 02:17:03.140]  I thought wow ISIS is in some sharp uniforms now but what do you make of Obama coming out
[02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:09.340]  and ordering the media to not show this footage but they're claiming because it makes them
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:17.300]  look too strong, no because it shows just like in Ukraine when they come up to the soldiers
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:21.340]  and they're Americans, they don't want that scene, go ahead.
[02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:26.380]  Well it fits his narrative but also in one of those scenes there's a guy running and
[02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:31.460]  he's got a booby cover on and he's clean-shaven, he looks like he shaved at 7 o'clock this
[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:35.660]  morning just like any other military person would like they're supposed to, the only time
[02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:42.020]  they wear beards is when they're told to and I don't know if these guys are Syrian Special
[02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:48.260]  Forces or Israeli Special Forces that are embedded with some U.S. Special Forces.
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:54.340]  Well it is true that Israel, incredibly shamefully, and this is not an anti-Israel statement, it's
[02:17:54.340 --> 02:18:01.060]  a fact, Israel has been through Lebanon and Golan openly aiding the Free Syrian Army
[02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:06.060]  and because they've got the Arab spies that are trained and they are a big part of this
[02:18:06.060 --> 02:18:07.860]  as well, you're absolutely right.
[02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:14.220]  The build of these guys just from watching different military groups is mixed, I mean
[02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:22.020]  I can't tell but it doesn't look like the usual western recruited, snot-nosed, usually rich
[02:18:22.020 --> 02:18:28.060]  kid, Muslim who wants to make a name for themselves who goes and joins all this, it doesn't look
[02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:33.500]  like the ragtag people we saw the West funding the last few years, it looks like probably
[02:18:33.500 --> 02:18:38.300]  different Arab Special Forces mixed in with Westerners, what do you say?
[02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:43.980]  I totally agree with you and just so I can give some validity to who I am, I live here
[02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:48.620]  locally, I live over a backdrop, I won't give my address but I really don't care because
[02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:51.820]  I've been in this fight for a long time and you asked what it would take for somebody
[02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:56.180]  to have the line drawn in the sand, there's so many parts of the United States that we've
[02:18:56.180 --> 02:18:59.860]  already lost and I have flagpoles in front of my house, I'm about to be put the flag
[02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:07.660]  upside down, the only thing I have left is Texas' byline in the sand.
[02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:13.120]  Well the country's just completely gone and you're right and they're just going to keep
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:17.300]  raising property taxes until they come after us, they're creating paramilitary teams in
[02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:21.300]  every city to attack us and in their briefing rooms all they do is talk about the Patriots
[02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:26.500]  and how horrible we are because they're coming after us and I, can you imagine how silly
[02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:30.260]  it is when the police and military try to march against the Patriots, what's going to
[02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:31.260]  happen?
[02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:39.260]  It's just going to be horrible Alec, I throw my own boots and I'm totally going to sustain
[02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:44.700]  myself but I can't sustain myself against the cover helicopters.
[02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:48.500]  Well you know those cover helicopters land but I don't think any of that's going to get
[02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:50.940]  to that point hopefully.
[02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:55.940]  The people that fly them, they go to restaurants, they live places, they you know, what matters
[02:19:55.940 --> 02:19:57.500]  is the people given the orders.
[02:19:57.500 --> 02:20:01.700]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:05.900]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[02:20:05.900 --> 02:20:06.900]  to serve us debt.
[02:20:06.900 --> 02:20:10.420]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[02:20:10.420 --> 02:20:13.700]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:17.380]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system,

[02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:05.620]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:22:05.620 --> 02:22:08.100]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:26.860]  I don't really follow pop news, but I am a BB King fan.
[02:24:26.860 --> 02:24:30.820]  I've actually seen BB King a couple of times when I was a kid when he'd come to Dallas,
[02:24:30.820 --> 02:24:33.860]  but I was a big fan.
[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:38.320]  Listen to that voice and I've seen Fats Domino.
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:44.340]  I know Jimmy Vaughn, my good friend.
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:48.280]  He's really good friends with BB King.
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:54.220]  That is a bummer.
[02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:59.220]  Claptom.
[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:05.940]  Rolling video there in the background of your radio listener.
[02:25:05.940 --> 02:25:10.940]  The thrill is gone.
[02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:15.060]  And now Lucille, his guitar is a widow.
[02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:19.220]  When Willie Nelson dies, Trigger will be a widow.
[02:25:19.220 --> 02:25:23.220]  People always ask who don't know about Willie Nelson.
[02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:26.260]  They go, why has he got that old guitar with big holes in it?
[02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:29.060]  It's from his hand hitting it for 50 years.
[02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:30.060]  That's why.
[02:25:30.060 --> 02:25:34.420]  I tell you, Willie's a piece of work.
[02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:38.340]  I've sat there and played chess with him in his bedroom where he likes to play out with
[02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:43.220]  his big porch and right there, Trigger.
[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:45.900]  And then when he goes to another room, Trigger goes with him.
[02:25:45.900 --> 02:25:49.220]  When you're on his bus, Trigger's sitting right there next to him.
[02:25:49.220 --> 02:25:54.220]  I think they ought to bury that guitar with him.
[02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:55.220]  I got a Willie story.
[02:25:55.220 --> 02:25:58.620]  Willie actually went to a burning house to save that guitar.
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:25:59.620]  I've heard about that.
[02:25:59.620 --> 02:26:01.260]  Tell us the Willie story.
[02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:02.260]  It's that.
[02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:03.260]  His house was on fire.
[02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:09.420]  Everything else burned, but I think he got some heat damage from grabbing Trigger.
[02:26:09.420 --> 02:26:10.420]  That's right.
[02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:11.420]  He told me about it.
[02:26:11.420 --> 02:26:13.860]  I remember him telling me about that effect.
[02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:17.420]  I think the guitar even was partly burned.
[02:26:17.420 --> 02:26:18.420]  It's hilarious.
[02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:22.220]  I tell you, that guitar is going to be worth a lot of money when he makes the jump into
[02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:25.540]  hyperspace.
[02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:29.460]  Blues legend BB King dies at age 89.
[02:26:29.460 --> 02:26:36.740]  Blues legend BB King who took his music from rural juke joints to the mainstream and inspired
[02:26:36.740 --> 02:26:40.300]  a generation of guitarists from where it clapped into Stevie Ray Vaughan has died in
[02:26:40.300 --> 02:26:41.300]  Las Vegas.
[02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:46.660]  He was 89 King induction of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 86 had said in May he was
[02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:54.380]  in hospice care at a summer being hospitalized in April with dehydration related to diabetes.
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:59.460]  The blues has lost its King and America has lost a legend.
[02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:03.980]  President Barack Obama always praying on every event said in a statement recalling how he
[02:27:03.980 --> 02:27:10.340]  sang sweet home Chicago with King at a White House blues concert three years ago.
[02:27:10.340 --> 02:27:14.780]  BB may be gone, but the thrill will be with us forever.
[02:27:14.780 --> 02:27:18.220]  And there's going to be one killer blues session in heaven tonight.
[02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:23.860]  Yeah, like you believe in heaven, Obama, give me a sick joke break.
[02:27:23.860 --> 02:27:27.060]  By the way, they found a bunch of videos on knock and talk where the police come to your
[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:33.740]  house and we want to talk about your firearms finally come in and the reason I raised that
[02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:37.180]  point was is the military is now doing that.
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:40.100]  But everything's okay.
[02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:42.540]  We'd like to just take a look at your firearms.
[02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:43.860]  We're from the US Army.
[02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:47.900]  You can trust us.
[02:27:47.900 --> 02:27:54.900]  How are all these traders going to feel at CNN and MSNBC and Fox News and this week as
[02:27:54.900 --> 02:27:58.820]  all this stuff unfolds in the years to come and you're sitting around telling everybody
[02:27:58.820 --> 02:28:00.180]  it ain't going to happen.
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:03.780]  You know, most of the public doesn't believe you, doesn't buy what you say anymore.
[02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:07.420]  We got Jakari Jackson coming in with break and second amendment news in a moment, but
[02:28:07.420 --> 02:28:10.060]  first, wild in Wisconsin.
[02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:11.060]  You're on the air.
[02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:12.060]  Thanks for holding.
[02:28:12.060 --> 02:28:14.260]  What's up, doc?
[02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:22.260]  I had a original kind of a statement about how millennials are also a target along with
[02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:26.220]  veterans just because they outnumber baby boomers now, but I think everybody knows that.
[02:28:26.220 --> 02:28:32.380]  I wanted to ask you a question which I haven't heard asked before, what does Alex Jones dream
[02:28:32.380 --> 02:28:33.380]  about at night?
[02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:36.500]  You know, those like really strong vivid dreams.
[02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:43.260]  Well, I have a lot of nightmares and I've had so many nightmares since I've been involved
[02:28:43.260 --> 02:28:46.940]  in all this that they're actually entertaining now.
[02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:48.660]  So it's really sick.
[02:28:48.660 --> 02:28:51.900]  When I was a kid, I'd have nightmares every once in a while and I hated them.
[02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:57.420]  Now they're quite enjoyable because it's my subconscious brain working through fear
[02:28:57.420 --> 02:28:59.460]  it already has.
[02:28:59.460 --> 02:29:04.940]  And so going through all the things I go through in these dreams, I mean, you name it.
[02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:07.220]  And when I have nightmares, maybe it's like once a week.
[02:29:07.220 --> 02:29:14.060]  It's like all night long in sessions as I'll wake up after one and move on to the next.
[02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:18.300]  I just see it as my brain wargaming, getting me ready for stuff to come down the road.
[02:29:18.300 --> 02:29:24.660]  Well, that's a great question kind of dreams don't have just the most wild, fantastical
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:30.460]  stuff right down to dreams where I'm editing video or dreams where I can't get anybody
[02:29:30.460 --> 02:29:35.380]  to take the garbage out at work or dreams where I keep spilling coffee on the carpet.
[02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:40.540]  You know, just the stupidest frustration dreams, dreams where my kids won't do what
[02:29:40.540 --> 02:29:41.540]  I tell them.
[02:29:41.540 --> 02:29:42.540]  That's a nightmare.
[02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:44.740]  I'm gonna I'll come back and finish up with that.
[02:29:44.740 --> 02:29:45.740]  That's a good question.
[02:29:45.740 --> 02:29:46.740]  Wild.
[02:29:46.740 --> 02:29:57.620]  Where on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:57.620 --> 02:30:03.220]  Today's hot story to info wars.com on May 15, 2015 article up by Steve Watson, school
[02:30:03.220 --> 02:30:06.380]  order student to remove offensive US flag from truck.
[02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:10.980]  A school in York, South Carolina has come under fire for ordering a student to remove
[02:30:10.980 --> 02:30:16.180]  a US flag from his truck because it could possibly be offensive to some people.
[02:30:16.180 --> 02:30:21.660]  Article by Kit Daniels, National Guard police gearing up for potential Cleveland riots.
[02:30:21.660 --> 02:30:26.180]  Article by Curt Nemo, Southern Christian Leadership Conference calls for amnesty of
[02:30:26.180 --> 02:30:28.620]  rioters, looters in Baltimore.
[02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:32.980]  The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Baltimore People's Power Assembly and
[02:30:32.980 --> 02:30:38.300]  the Be More United Coalition are calling for people arrested during violent protests in
[02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:40.380]  Baltimore to be released.
[02:30:40.380 --> 02:30:45.140]  According to the Reverend courtly CD witherspoon of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
[02:30:45.140 --> 02:30:49.900]  the protesters will march from McLean Square through the Inner Harbor, demanding amnesty
[02:30:49.900 --> 02:30:53.500]  for those arrested during the Freddie Gray protests.
[02:30:53.500 --> 02:31:02.780]  For more reports like this, go to info wars.com and it's that type of behavior that spurred
[02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:08.740]  me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and
[02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:10.260]  help children focus.
[02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:12.980]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:31:12.980 --> 02:31:18.340]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:22.860]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:27.260]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[02:31:27.260 --> 02:31:28.260]  drugs.
[02:31:28.260 --> 02:31:32.340]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:34.340]  that children would actually like and take.
[02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:37.940]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[02:31:37.940 --> 02:31:42.500]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:47.980]  Bring child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential
[02:31:47.980 --> 02:31:50.060]  nutrients that taste great.

[02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:06.140]  what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:32:06.140 --> 02:32:10.180]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:14.540]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[02:32:14.540 --> 02:32:19.860]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:32:33.460 --> 02:32:37.700]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:40.380]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:20.420]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.420 --> 02:33:30.580]  You know, sharing your dreams is a very personal thing but my whole life is about sharing my
[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:31.580]  dreams with people.
[02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:37.820]  I'll tell you one of my most recurring dreams.
[02:33:37.820 --> 02:33:48.140]  It's basically different variants, it's not really a dream, it's a nightmare of the 1982
[02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:59.700]  or whatever it was, remake of the thing put out by John Carpenter but it's not set in
[02:33:59.700 --> 02:34:00.700]  Antarctica.
[02:34:00.700 --> 02:34:09.620]  It's just set like in neighborhoods and then I've got my family and people look like they're
[02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:16.180]  normal but they're not and the entire biosphere, the entire genetic code, the planet, the trees,
[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:24.380]  the grass, everything has been overtaken and then my children get overtaken and absorbed
[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:29.380]  right in front of me and it's just intense grief and pain watching my family killed in
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:30.380]  front of me.
[02:34:30.380 --> 02:34:35.140]  I have that dream, different variants, all night long about once a week and what it is
[02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:42.500]  is my brain getting me ready to just deal with losing everything so that I don't fear
[02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:50.580]  when I'm conscious and awake but when I sleep, I do.
[02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:53.140]  That's the kind of stuff I dream about.
[02:34:53.140 --> 02:34:56.900]  Then I have political dreams where I'm just like at work reading news articles and having
[02:34:56.900 --> 02:34:59.820]  political understandings and it's like I'm working while I'm asleep, I have those type
[02:34:59.820 --> 02:35:03.140]  of dreams, I have dreams where I'm video editing, I have dreams where I'm tearing the trash
[02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:10.540]  out, I have dreams where I'm fishing, I have dreams where I'm back with one of my grandfathers,
[02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:16.340]  all camping, I basically have a wide spectrum of dreams.
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:21.380]  I have dreams sometimes where I'm like it's in all this vivid color and it's like you're
[02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:25.580]  on a space station but it's nothing like you've ever seen or imagined.
[02:35:25.580 --> 02:35:31.540]  There's just all these beings of light and like space bridges and interdimensional gates
[02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:36.740]  and of course you can say it's human imagination, whatever, it's fantastical.
[02:35:36.740 --> 02:35:39.140]  Those are the type of dreams I have.
[02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:43.220]  But really in dreams we know, and you can read about this from Carl Jung, it's pretty
[02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:48.940]  accurate from my experiences, that it's archetypes and that it's a subconscious mind learning
[02:35:48.940 --> 02:35:57.580]  to deal with things and the GMO, the culture, even if you want to take care of your kids,
[02:35:57.580 --> 02:36:01.580]  you're almost betting when you have them on the future and putting them into a dangerous
[02:36:01.580 --> 02:36:02.580]  world.
[02:36:02.580 --> 02:36:10.060]  So I have intense guilt at a binary base code level that I have three children that
[02:36:10.060 --> 02:36:13.500]  I put into this world knowing everything I know.
[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:20.180]  But I intend to have more children if I can because I've got to go through the fear and
[02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:24.980]  I've got to bet them and myself and everything on freedom and that we're going to make it
[02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:27.100]  out of this even if we individually don't.
[02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:31.300]  I'm not going to just give up and say it's all over, it's not going to happen.
[02:36:31.300 --> 02:36:36.360]  It'll make the spiritual decision to go to that next level.
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:39.260]  But we do see our children taken away from us.
[02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:43.640]  But in life, it's generally your children taken away from you by their husband or their
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:48.740]  wife and the other family and then you still love them, but there is a little bit of frustration
[02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:52.020]  that they're not with you anymore, that they've got their own life, but then you see them
[02:36:52.020 --> 02:36:55.100]  have their own kids and then it's a wonderful thing.
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:57.260]  That's to really love your kids.
[02:36:57.260 --> 02:37:02.940]  So many mothers end up disliking their son's wife.
[02:37:02.940 --> 02:37:07.660]  That's one of the most well-known things because they see their son being taken away by that
[02:37:07.660 --> 02:37:10.140]  woman at a very primitive level.
[02:37:10.140 --> 02:37:13.140]  That's not all women to do that, but that's the most common type of thing.
[02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:19.140]  But this isn't some of their family taking away your child.
[02:37:19.140 --> 02:37:24.340]  This is your child having their mind taken, their soul taken, their health taken, their
[02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:33.100]  genetics destroyed, and so to have a child today, you are entering them into the singularity,
[02:37:33.100 --> 02:37:38.500]  the technotronic war, the AI war, all the craziness that we're already in that's just
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:40.500]  going to get more wild and more insane.
[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:51.180]  So you can say it is an act of evil to have children, but I really don't think it is because
[02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:57.060]  we have to do that so we do everything we can to change what's happening in the future.
[02:37:57.060 --> 02:37:59.420]  I didn't really think all that out, but that's what comes from my heart.
[02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:06.140]  Now shifting gears when we're going to go to Jakari Jackson, BB King died today at 89.
[02:38:06.140 --> 02:38:14.740]  We just played one of his best-known songs earlier, and Jimmy Vaughn, who I know was
[02:38:14.740 --> 02:38:21.460]  really good friends with him, is here popping in on short notice, we appreciate him to give
[02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:26.220]  us his take on the passing of BB King, who I know influenced his brother Stevie Ray Vaughn
[02:38:26.220 --> 02:38:31.220]  and of course, Jimmy Vaughn, who got his brother's first guitar and got him into it.
[02:38:31.220 --> 02:38:36.100]  So Jimmy Vaughn joins us, Jimmy, I don't even know where you're at, are you in Austin right
[02:38:36.100 --> 02:38:37.100]  now or are you on the road?
[02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:38.100]  Yeah, I'm at home.
[02:38:38.100 --> 02:38:39.100]  I'm in Austin.
[02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:43.380]  Well, I didn't know BB died until I was looking here in the stack, everybody else knew.
[02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:46.940]  And then I said, well, I'm going to call Jimmy, so thanks for coming on, on short notice.
[02:38:46.940 --> 02:38:50.580]  Yeah, my pleasure, yeah.
[02:38:50.580 --> 02:38:57.740]  We heard that he passed away last night, and of course, everybody announced it this morning.
[02:38:57.740 --> 02:39:05.220]  So he had been sick and we noticed last week, they were saying that he was under hospice
[02:39:05.220 --> 02:39:16.940]  care and things like that, so, but it's a truly incredible BB, you know, was probably,
[02:39:16.940 --> 02:39:23.740]  I guess BB is the greatest blues guitar player that, you know, ever lived, and you know,
[02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:31.180]  all the guitar players that you think of as blues guys from the 50s, I think they would
[02:39:31.180 --> 02:39:42.860]  agree with me, Buddy Guy and Otis Rush and Lil' Milton, and we could go on and on and
[02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:43.860]  on.
[02:39:43.860 --> 02:39:52.660]  Most all of them, including myself and Stevie and many others, Mike Bloomfield, and we could
[02:39:52.660 --> 02:40:01.260]  have a list for, you know, 100, 100 names, pretty much basically learned how to play
[02:40:01.260 --> 02:40:03.140]  out BB King records.
[02:40:03.140 --> 02:40:12.900]  And of course, his big influence was, according to him, was T-Bone Walker and Django Reinhardt
[02:40:12.900 --> 02:40:19.340]  during his time, but he took it to a whole new level and he was a completely original
[02:40:19.340 --> 02:40:25.500]  guy, so I'm trying to say, and he was a fabulous thing or two, and he made, I mean, he's made
[02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:28.500]  over 100 albums.
[02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:32.820]  Took as you say as the real granddaddy of blues versus the granddaddy of rock and roll.
[02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:35.140]  The granddaddy of rock and roll would be Chuck Berry, right?
[02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:41.140]  Yeah, yeah, I would say so, and Lil' Richard and, but I mean, all the rock and roll guys
[02:40:41.140 --> 02:40:43.820]  listened to BB King too, so.
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:46.060]  Now, you were really good friends of them.
[02:40:46.060 --> 02:40:50.420]  I don't know if I can tell you these personal stories, but I mean, you told me about BB
[02:40:50.420 --> 02:40:51.420]  King.
[02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:52.420]  I mean, you've told me quite a few interesting stories.
[02:40:52.420 --> 02:40:53.420]  I know you're, well.
[02:40:53.420 --> 02:41:03.020]  Well, you know, BB was just a really sweet guy and a loving guy, and one time I was,
[02:41:03.020 --> 02:41:11.580]  I got to play on the crossroads in Chicago and I got to go on with BB.
[02:41:11.580 --> 02:41:18.340]  I was on Willie's bus with BB and they were talking about Nightlife, which is a song that
[02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:27.340]  Willie wrote that BB made popular in the, in the 60s, in the mid 60s, I guess.
[02:41:27.340 --> 02:41:34.540]  A lot of people recorded that song, but also did BB King and, you know, the blues and a
[02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:38.460]  lot of that country music is, was really the same thing.
[02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:44.820]  As far as I was concerned, and it crossed over on both sides, you know, and it'd be
[02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:51.140]  tough to say enough about BB King, you know, he was influenced everybody around the world
[02:41:51.140 --> 02:41:56.540]  on the guitar, even if you don't play the blues, you know, you had to be influenced
[02:41:56.540 --> 02:41:57.540]  by BB King.
[02:41:57.540 --> 02:41:58.540]  I mean.
[02:41:58.540 --> 02:42:04.180]  And, and, and I mean, didn't your daughters call him, call him Uncle BB?
[02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:05.180]  Yeah.
[02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:06.180]  Yeah.
[02:42:06.180 --> 02:42:15.380]  And actually, my wife, that's how we met was, I met my wife.
[02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:21.180]  We went on tour with BB King, my band, BB King would have like a traveling blues festival
[02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:22.620]  every year.
[02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:30.140]  And I went and did that tour a couple of times, but then one year I filled in for the Neville
[02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:37.380]  Brothers for three or four shows, and that's where I met my wife, Robin, and she knew BB
[02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:41.100]  from, from working on the tour.
[02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:44.620]  And she used to run the House of Blues, too.
[02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:47.740]  Well, she used to work, I worked there for that.
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:48.740]  Yeah.
[02:42:48.740 --> 02:42:49.740]  Organization.
[02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:50.740]  Yeah.
[02:42:50.740 --> 02:42:55.420]  And she worked at Gibson and everything, but and BB played Gibson's and, you know, it
[02:42:55.420 --> 02:42:57.380]  goes on and on and on.
[02:42:57.380 --> 02:43:05.660]  And I mean, I, I learned how to play guitar from, I got in a band when I was about 15
[02:43:05.660 --> 02:43:11.100]  and started making pretty good money for a 15 year old and I went down and bought every
[02:43:11.100 --> 02:43:13.420]  BB King album that I could get.
[02:43:13.420 --> 02:43:18.900]  I mean, I had like 20 of them and brought them home and, and would put the record on
[02:43:18.900 --> 02:43:25.380]  and, you know, learn the intro and the solo and the, and the ending of, of just let the
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:27.340]  LP play and just play along with it.
[02:43:27.340 --> 02:43:28.940]  So is he your biggest influencer?
[02:43:28.940 --> 02:43:29.940]  Is it Chuck Berry?
[02:43:29.940 --> 02:43:35.020]  Well, all of them, all of them are, you know, I'm influenced by all of them.
[02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:37.940]  I may have listened to all their stuff, you know, and still do.
[02:43:37.940 --> 02:43:48.180]  But I mean, BB was, you know, BB was the, was the greatest and sort of the, the grandfather
[02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:51.020]  of the whole thing as far as bending the strings.
[02:43:51.020 --> 02:43:56.140]  They call it like singing string because it's kind of like a woman saying it sometimes,
[02:43:56.140 --> 02:43:57.140]  you know.
[02:43:57.140 --> 02:44:03.220]  And that's where all the, you know, the Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck, all the English guys,
[02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:10.820]  Jimi Hendrix, all these people, you know, learned really from, from Buddy Guy, all
[02:44:10.820 --> 02:44:13.620]  I'm learned from BB King records really.
[02:44:13.620 --> 02:44:15.740]  You know, I gotta get you on some times.
[02:44:15.740 --> 02:44:18.260]  You've got the, you've got the Robert Plant stories.
[02:44:18.260 --> 02:44:20.260]  You've got the Jimi Hendrix stories.
[02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:23.180]  You got everything, Jimmy, but you, you've got to write a book someday.
[02:44:23.180 --> 02:44:26.020]  I tell you, you have seen everything, my friend.
[02:44:26.020 --> 02:44:27.540]  Well, well, thank you.
[02:44:27.540 --> 02:44:34.940]  I was, I was real honored and it was my pleasure to see BB so many times and, you know, he
[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:39.900]  would always come through town and, and we would try to go see him or we'd see him somewhere.
[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:47.540]  And he, he would always be real sweet to my kids and he was just a great guy all the way
[02:44:47.540 --> 02:44:53.580]  around besides being a fabulous musician and such an innovator, you know.
[02:44:53.580 --> 02:44:57.500]  Well, I knew, I mean, growing up, that's what my dad listened to, you know, when my mom
[02:44:57.500 --> 02:45:01.180]  was putting the records on, it would be like, you know, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, the Rolling
[02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:02.180]  Stones.
[02:45:02.180 --> 02:45:03.180]  But my dad was playing stuff.
[02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:07.300]  It'd be, you know, Fats Domino and BB King and he, he took me to see both of them.
[02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:12.740]  I've seen BB King twice in Fats Domino once and just amazing that these guys, some of
[02:45:12.740 --> 02:45:13.740]  them are still alive.
[02:45:13.740 --> 02:45:17.820]  It's like, you hear BB King still alive and you go, gosh, that guy, it's like the grand
[02:45:17.820 --> 02:45:18.820]  daddy of it all.
[02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:19.820]  And then they're finally gone.
[02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:21.340]  It just shows you they are human.
[02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:24.140]  Yeah, well, it doesn't seem real.
[02:45:24.140 --> 02:45:26.380]  It's one of those things where it just doesn't seem real.
[02:45:26.380 --> 02:45:29.740]  You know, it's true, but it doesn't seem real, you know.
[02:45:29.740 --> 02:45:37.340]  The last time we saw him was at Crossroads and I guess here in Austin at the, you know,
[02:45:37.340 --> 02:45:41.580]  downtown at the theater, the Paramount.
[02:45:41.580 --> 02:45:46.700]  And we got to go down there and see him and, oh, he was just fabulous.
[02:45:46.700 --> 02:45:47.700]  Did you cry?
[02:45:47.700 --> 02:45:49.700]  When did you hear he died and did you cry, Jimmy?
[02:45:49.700 --> 02:45:51.940]  Oh, last night, yes, yes, I did.
[02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:52.940]  Yes, I did.
[02:45:52.940 --> 02:46:00.420]  And, uh, and, uh, you know, we, we, we, you know, he was, uh, very, uh, fatherly to my
[02:46:00.420 --> 02:46:04.780]  family and we would always go see him and he would always, you know, talk to the kids
[02:46:04.780 --> 02:46:10.980]  and bounce him on his knees and all that stuff, you know, just like a relative would, you
[02:46:10.980 --> 02:46:13.180]  know, he was the greatest.
[02:46:13.180 --> 02:46:18.700]  Well, a big, big bummer, Jimmy, but, you know, he's got incredible accomplishments
[02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:23.900]  behind him and, uh, he's given Bert so much great art, uh, in this culture.
[02:46:23.900 --> 02:46:25.100]  It's really amazing.
[02:46:25.100 --> 02:46:28.580]  I wonder what your brother, uh, you know, thinks about all this.
[02:46:28.580 --> 02:46:33.540]  Well, I was wondering if maybe, you know, uh, they're there together now.
[02:46:33.540 --> 02:46:36.660]  So what I think, I don't think there's any doubt about it.
[02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:41.460]  If there is a heaven and we know there is there, they're there together and, uh, I don't
[02:46:41.460 --> 02:46:43.980]  know, they're playing harps up there, probably playing guitars.
[02:46:43.980 --> 02:46:46.020]  I think they're playing guitars.
[02:46:46.020 --> 02:46:51.420]  All right, Jimmy Vaughn, uh, Jimmy, tell us about what's coming, you always got tours
[02:46:51.420 --> 02:46:53.500]  going, you've always got stuff happening.
[02:46:53.500 --> 02:46:57.020]  What's the best place for folks to find out everything, uh, Jimmy Vaughn and company?
[02:46:57.020 --> 02:47:02.340]  Well, they can go on my Facebook or they can go on Jimmy Vaughn.com and see where I'm
[02:47:02.340 --> 02:47:03.340]  going to be.
[02:47:03.340 --> 02:47:04.340]  It's all posted.
[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:09.180]  Well, Jimmy, tell Robin and the girls I said hi and, uh, I'm sure we'll see it.
[02:47:09.180 --> 02:47:11.580]  My daughter's birthday party of your in town coming up.
[02:47:11.580 --> 02:47:12.580]  Thank you so much, Jimmy.
[02:47:12.580 --> 02:47:13.580]  All right.
[02:47:13.580 --> 02:47:14.580]  You do the same.
[02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:15.580]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:47:15.580 --> 02:47:16.580]  We'll be right off here on the show.
[02:47:16.580 --> 02:47:17.580]  All right.
[02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:18.580]  Bye-bye.
[02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:19.580]  That is a gentleman right there.
[02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:23.660]  Jimmy Vaughn is, I've known him like 15 years now, super classy.
[02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:26.620]  And I met him the same way I met, uh, Willie Nelson.
[02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:30.700]  He came to the showing of road to tyranny, 2002.
[02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:34.300]  And there he was, his girlfriend, Robin Vaughn, and we hung out and talked a little bit and
[02:47:34.300 --> 02:47:35.660]  I got to do them real good after that.
[02:47:35.660 --> 02:47:36.660]  But, uh, it was weird.
[02:47:36.660 --> 02:47:38.180]  I see more of these movie showings.
[02:47:38.180 --> 02:47:41.700]  That's how folks come out and see me and like, Hey, it's Willie Nelson.
[02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:44.660]  He's here to see the movie and, uh, pretty, it's great.
[02:47:44.660 --> 02:47:46.620]  How many of these guys are patriots though, Jacari?
[02:47:46.620 --> 02:47:47.620]  It's exciting.
[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:48.620]  Yeah.
[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:50.220]  We had a chance to see, uh, Reverend Horton heat.
[02:47:50.220 --> 02:47:54.460]  We went out a couple of weeks ago, a lot of us in the crew, and he's a real big fan.
[02:47:54.460 --> 02:47:56.140]  Joe was telling me that.
[02:47:56.140 --> 02:47:57.140]  Yeah.
[02:47:57.140 --> 02:47:58.140]  Who isn't a fan of the show?
[02:47:58.140 --> 02:48:01.860]  I better behave myself on all these viewers and listeners.
[02:48:01.860 --> 02:48:03.860]  Hey, he said he's down to come on.
[02:48:03.860 --> 02:48:07.140]  So I don't know, uh, let's get him on what his tour schedule is, but next time he's coming
[02:48:07.140 --> 02:48:10.260]  through, we can go and interview him on the scene or something.
[02:48:10.260 --> 02:48:13.700]  I tell you, Jacari, and we're not bragging about the show being big.
[02:48:13.700 --> 02:48:15.060]  It's actually scary.
[02:48:15.060 --> 02:48:17.980]  It's just that freedom is popular, Jacari.
[02:48:17.980 --> 02:48:18.980]  It is.
[02:48:18.980 --> 02:48:19.980]  We're going to skip this network break.
[02:48:19.980 --> 02:48:22.300]  So I have time to go to overdrive and take calls.
[02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:27.340]  I got Jacari in here, but right during the last break at 33 after I went Buckley, here's
[02:48:27.340 --> 02:48:31.140]  my cell phone, call Jimmy Vaughn, he's not on tour, he'll probably answer.
[02:48:31.140 --> 02:48:32.140]  Get him on.
[02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:33.140]  And he came on to this.
[02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:34.140]  So that happened.
[02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:35.660]  I mean, you know, BB King is a big cultural icon.
[02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:36.660]  So I think it's important.
[02:48:36.660 --> 02:48:39.420]  We spend some time on that because we spend so much time on negative crap.
[02:48:39.420 --> 02:48:41.580]  Why not celebrate the cool people?
[02:48:41.580 --> 02:48:42.580]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:48:42.580 --> 02:48:43.580]  Yeah.
[02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:47.340]  We can have somebody on like Jimmy Vaughn to liken it to, you know, bring it full circle.
[02:48:47.340 --> 02:48:51.620]  Let people know that people in the entertainment industry, they are awakened, aware of things
[02:48:51.620 --> 02:48:52.620]  that are going on.
[02:48:52.620 --> 02:48:53.620]  Yeah.
[02:48:53.620 --> 02:48:55.700]  I know my dad's going to be bummed out.
[02:48:55.700 --> 02:48:57.860]  I think BB King is probably his favorite person.
[02:48:57.860 --> 02:48:58.860]  Really?
[02:48:58.860 --> 02:48:59.860]  I mean, I mean, music wise.
[02:48:59.860 --> 02:49:00.860]  Yeah.
[02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:01.860]  My dad was a real big Hendricks fan.
[02:49:01.860 --> 02:49:02.860]  Oh, yeah.
[02:49:02.860 --> 02:49:03.860]  Timmy Hendricks amazing.
[02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:05.580]  But see, that all came out of BB King.
[02:49:05.580 --> 02:49:07.380]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:09.620]  See, think how this show is influencing people.
[02:49:09.620 --> 02:49:10.780]  I'm not going to bring myself to BB King.
[02:49:10.780 --> 02:49:14.340]  I mean, the bad stuff I'm doing is influencing people.
[02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:16.260]  It's crazy to have that much influence.
[02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:19.460]  Jakari, this is just the newest attack on guns.
[02:49:19.460 --> 02:49:20.540]  It's not just New Jersey.
[02:49:20.540 --> 02:49:21.780]  Other states are doing similar stuff.
[02:49:21.780 --> 02:49:24.020]  So check your state, folks, but tell us about this.
[02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:25.420]  We're going to air this special report.
[02:49:25.420 --> 02:49:26.420]  Yeah.
[02:49:26.420 --> 02:49:30.060]  Because Alex, we started out the year talking about the Green Tip ammunition, the ATF coming
[02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:31.060]  after that.
[02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:35.260]  And before that, we were talking about the sanctions on the AR-15s, the AR-15 ammo.
[02:49:35.260 --> 02:49:40.900]  And of course, we also see these proponents, these anti-gun politicians coming after your
[02:49:40.900 --> 02:49:42.620]  guns while committing gun crimes themselves.
[02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:47.540]  We saw Senator Yee last year in California running guns.
[02:49:47.540 --> 02:49:53.140]  And also earlier this month, we saw the representative in Michigan shooting his wife's car with
[02:49:53.140 --> 02:49:54.140]  a shotgun.
[02:49:54.140 --> 02:49:55.540]  Just all these wild things going on.
[02:49:55.540 --> 02:49:56.540]  Yeah.
[02:49:56.540 --> 02:49:57.540]  What is it about these anti-gunners?
[02:49:57.540 --> 02:49:59.380]  They're the ones missed by having with guns.
[02:49:59.380 --> 02:50:03.300]  Well, I think it's to the point where they think everybody's like them and they know
[02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:04.300]  how they are.
[02:50:04.300 --> 02:50:05.300]  They've been.
[02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:06.300]  Everybody's going.
[02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:07.300]  That's actually who's the guy that threatened to shoot me?
[02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:08.300]  Buzz.
[02:50:08.300 --> 02:50:09.300]  What's that guy's name on Peerth Morgan?
[02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:10.300]  I'm not sure.
[02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:11.300]  Oh, Buzz.
[02:50:11.300 --> 02:50:12.300]  Bissinger.
[02:50:12.300 --> 02:50:13.300]  Buzz Bissinger.
[02:50:13.300 --> 02:50:16.500]  He said later in the article he wrote in another interview, he goes, look, I'm crazy.
[02:50:16.500 --> 02:50:17.660]  I'm mentally ill.
[02:50:17.660 --> 02:50:18.820]  I'm on medications.
[02:50:18.820 --> 02:50:21.020]  I spend millions of dollars on women's clothing.
[02:50:21.020 --> 02:50:22.020]  I'm not the one making this up.
[02:50:22.020 --> 02:50:23.020]  Yeah.
[02:50:23.020 --> 02:50:24.020]  I saw the picture of the guy.
[02:50:24.020 --> 02:50:25.020]  He said, I'm crazy.
[02:50:25.020 --> 02:50:26.620]  Don't let me have a gun.
[02:50:26.620 --> 02:50:27.620]  Yeah.
[02:50:27.620 --> 02:50:28.620]  And so that's what they say.
[02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:29.620]  Don't let him have one.
[02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:30.620]  He's crazy, too.
[02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:31.620]  Yeah.
[02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:32.620]  So he thinks I'm nuts like him.
[02:50:32.620 --> 02:50:33.620]  Yeah.
[02:50:33.620 --> 02:50:36.740]  They don't understand their own fallacies and like, well, they can't be any better than
[02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:37.740]  me.
[02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:38.860]  So we had to take away all the guns.
[02:50:38.860 --> 02:50:41.260]  So but now we have this, this latest attack.
[02:50:41.260 --> 02:50:45.460]  This is from a New Jersey representative, Miss Bonnie Watson Coleman.
[02:50:45.460 --> 02:50:52.100]  And this is HR 2283, known as the Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2015.
[02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:57.500]  And basically it will require a face-to-face interaction to purchase ammunition.
[02:50:57.500 --> 02:51:03.060]  It already has 30 co-sponsors, House Democrats, and it would also require federal government
[02:51:03.060 --> 02:51:05.420]  to issue a license to ammunition dealers.
[02:51:05.420 --> 02:51:07.460]  So it'll be on the FFL.
[02:51:07.460 --> 02:51:12.100]  Now if you want to go down to Cargo Shop or whatever, he has to have a license to sell
[02:51:12.100 --> 02:51:14.660]  you a box of 223 ammunition.
[02:51:14.660 --> 02:51:15.660]  And that's the move.
[02:51:15.660 --> 02:51:19.220]  And we've always known they wanted to do that and restrict the lead.
[02:51:19.220 --> 02:51:22.980]  And then meanwhile, I had Al Jazeera interview with me last night and this guy was American.
[02:51:22.980 --> 02:51:24.940]  He kept saying, no one wants your guns.
[02:51:24.940 --> 02:51:25.940]  No one's taking guns.
[02:51:25.940 --> 02:51:29.460]  They always, and I went, here's the, and he goes, no, they're not for like 10 minutes.
[02:51:29.460 --> 02:51:30.940]  I just said, dude, I'm done.
[02:51:30.940 --> 02:51:31.940]  Yeah.
[02:51:31.940 --> 02:51:34.980]  I was thinking it's just like when you guys, we all went out to the Alamo, but you guys
[02:51:34.980 --> 02:51:37.940]  had a chance to talk to the anti-gun group out there.
[02:51:37.940 --> 02:51:43.140]  Nobody's trying to take your guns while they hand you a flyer saying ban all fully automatic
[02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:44.140]  rifles.
[02:51:44.140 --> 02:51:45.140]  Or semi-auto.
[02:51:45.140 --> 02:51:46.140]  Yeah, semi-auto.
[02:51:46.140 --> 02:51:48.540]  I mean, it's, it's this mental illness that they're saying nobody's trying to take your
[02:51:48.540 --> 02:51:49.540]  guns.
[02:51:49.540 --> 02:51:50.540]  You got Feinstein.
[02:51:50.540 --> 02:51:51.540]  You got Bloomberg.
[02:51:51.540 --> 02:51:52.540]  You got Bach.
[02:51:52.540 --> 02:51:53.540]  Panama.
[02:51:53.540 --> 02:51:54.540]  Yeah.
[02:51:54.540 --> 02:51:55.540]  Yeah.
[02:51:55.540 --> 02:51:56.540]  If I could, if I had the votes in the Senate, I would have picked up every single one of
[02:51:56.540 --> 02:51:57.540]  them.
[02:51:57.540 --> 02:52:00.500]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, but nobody wants your guns.
[02:52:00.500 --> 02:52:02.780]  And they, and they take these, what is these games they play?
[02:52:02.780 --> 02:52:03.780]  Yeah.
[02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:07.380]  And they take people failing at their attempt to take away guns as nobody's trying.
[02:52:07.380 --> 02:52:09.300]  Just like I talked to that guy, was it South by Southwest?
[02:52:09.300 --> 02:52:10.900]  He's like, nobody's trying to take your guns.
[02:52:10.900 --> 02:52:12.420]  Like, yeah, they are trying to take your guns.
[02:52:12.420 --> 02:52:16.260]  They keep trying and failing, but that's not for lack of trying.
[02:52:16.260 --> 02:52:19.420]  These people want to take away your firearms because they understand their own family.
[02:52:19.420 --> 02:52:24.180]  And now they're saying nobody wants a secret treaty because TPP got voted down for now.
[02:52:24.180 --> 02:52:28.740]  So we keep barely having victories because of their tactic of denying it's happening.
[02:52:28.740 --> 02:52:32.300]  I mean, it doesn't work on us Chikari, but remember the general public's not paying attention.
[02:52:32.300 --> 02:52:33.300]  Yeah.
[02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:34.300]  So they actually hear this.
[02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:35.300]  Oh, there's no problem.
[02:52:35.300 --> 02:52:36.300]  Yeah.
[02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:37.300]  Go back to watching SportsCenter.
[02:52:37.300 --> 02:52:38.300]  Let's play this breakdown.
[02:52:38.300 --> 02:52:40.500]  This wasn't going to be on the nightly news.
[02:52:40.500 --> 02:52:44.260]  It still will be, but we're going to premiere in here on the radio right now.
[02:52:44.260 --> 02:52:49.460]  Here's another way they're coming after the second amendment with Jacarie Jackson and
[02:52:49.460 --> 02:52:55.460]  the info.
[02:52:55.460 --> 02:52:58.700]  Chikari Jackson here infowars.com.
[02:52:58.700 --> 02:53:00.620]  We have a new article on the site.
[02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:04.100]  House bill seeks to eliminate online ammo sales.
[02:53:04.100 --> 02:53:10.780]  And this is a New Jersey representative Bonnie Watson Coleman and HR 2283 known as the Stop
[02:53:10.780 --> 02:53:14.100]  Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2015.
[02:53:14.100 --> 02:53:18.940]  And it would require face to face purchases of ammunition.
[02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:22.340]  And with our second amendment in the United States of America, I don't have any issue
[02:53:22.340 --> 02:53:27.780]  with you buying your ammunition over the internet, and I don't think that personal sales of firearms
[02:53:27.780 --> 02:53:29.900]  or ammunition require background checks.
[02:53:29.900 --> 02:53:35.860]  I know a lot of people want to have those, uh, run ammunition sales as well.
[02:53:35.860 --> 02:53:41.380]  I don't agree with this because you could just as easily walk into Bass Pro Shop Cabela's
[02:53:41.380 --> 02:53:45.980]  Academy or wherever, put down, you know, $1,000 by $1,000 worth of ammunition.
[02:53:45.980 --> 02:53:51.340]  Yeah, that's, you know, catches people's attention, but it is very much legal in the
[02:53:51.340 --> 02:53:55.100]  United States of America and to anybody would say, well, you know, they're stocking up all
[02:53:55.100 --> 02:53:56.100]  this ammunition.
[02:53:56.100 --> 02:53:59.980]  They can go out there and shoot somebody or look what just happened in Garland, Texas.
[02:53:59.980 --> 02:54:06.100]  And I definitely hope that Ms. Representative Coleman here takes a look at the Department
[02:54:06.100 --> 02:54:12.100]  of Homeland Security because I'm going to bring up a throwback article back in 2013.
[02:54:12.100 --> 02:54:16.220]  And the reason I'm bringing up this old article, they have many more rounds of ammunition now,
[02:54:16.220 --> 02:54:18.740]  but I like the point that Watson makes in this.
[02:54:18.740 --> 02:54:24.300]  They had purchased enough ammunition to fight the war in Iraq for another 30 years.
[02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:25.940]  And this is the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:54:25.940 --> 02:54:29.540]  This isn't the military, you know, somebody, you know, they got to be worried about some
[02:54:29.540 --> 02:54:30.780]  Red Dawn situation.
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:35.860]  This is the Department of Homeland Security has this massive amount of ammunition.
[02:54:35.860 --> 02:54:38.740]  I definitely hope somebody will take a look into that.
[02:54:38.740 --> 02:54:43.060]  Also DHS purchasing paper targets of pregnant women and little children.
[02:54:43.060 --> 02:54:46.860]  And when I say children, I'm not talking about some 17 year old in a trench coat.
[02:54:46.860 --> 02:54:51.180]  I'm talking about a little 10 year old boy is holding his gun like this and smiling and
[02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:52.180]  grinning.
[02:54:52.180 --> 02:54:55.500]  And then we wonder why we have shootings like what happened to Tamir Rice when you're
[02:54:55.500 --> 02:54:59.420]  teaching these guys that, you know, some child could easily be your enemy is out to kill
[02:54:59.420 --> 02:55:00.980]  you.
[02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:03.300]  So that's what's going on on that front.
[02:55:03.300 --> 02:55:08.260]  Also they're trying to ban body armor and states like California, which I'm also against
[02:55:08.260 --> 02:55:13.300]  because, you know, just me doing the job that I do myself, Joe Biggs and some of the other
[02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:17.620]  crew members, we go out to very dangerous situations and sometimes we take body armor
[02:55:17.620 --> 02:55:18.620]  with us.
[02:55:18.620 --> 02:55:20.620]  And it's not everybody's like, well, you got to worry about the crowd.
[02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:24.140]  When I was down in Ferguson, I had little to no issue with crowd like, yeah, there's
[02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:28.820]  some guy who wanted to argue me about how cool it was to burn down buildings and stuff.
[02:55:28.820 --> 02:55:33.220]  But by and large, I was more concerned about my safety from what the police were doing.
[02:55:33.220 --> 02:55:37.700]  The police were shooting rubber bullets, at least when we got, we were there back in August
[02:55:37.700 --> 02:55:38.700]  in November.
[02:55:38.700 --> 02:55:42.100]  They were much better behaved, but when we were out there in August, they're shooting
[02:55:42.100 --> 02:55:47.940]  rubber bullets indiscriminately into a blinding cloud of tear gas, you know, and Joe Biggs
[02:55:47.940 --> 02:55:52.780]  of course got shot with a rubber bullet, had a nice big bruise to show for his efforts.
[02:55:52.780 --> 02:55:53.780]  So we have body armor.
[02:55:53.780 --> 02:55:54.780]  We have soft body armor.
[02:55:54.780 --> 02:55:59.820]  We have a hard plated body armor, which is like basically strapping a skillet to yourself
[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:03.940]  and running around, but we have it just to deal with these type of situations, gas mask
[02:56:03.940 --> 02:56:04.940]  as well.
[02:56:04.940 --> 02:56:10.620]  And, you know, other people, they may have them for other things if you just want a bullet
[02:56:10.620 --> 02:56:12.460]  proof vest for home defense.
[02:56:12.460 --> 02:56:13.460]  That's your business.
[02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:16.940]  I don't think the government should be able to tell you not to do that.
[02:56:16.940 --> 02:56:21.500]  And while we're talking about the DHS arming up with so many rounds of ammunition about
[02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:25.860]  people using these things for self-defense, let's also talk about the other things that
[02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:27.620]  are going on in our government.
[02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:32.380]  Let's start with running guns into Mexico with Operation Fast and Furious.
[02:56:32.380 --> 02:56:37.620]  New documents obtained by CBS News show Attorney General Eric Holder was sent briefings on
[02:56:37.620 --> 02:56:43.060]  the controversial Fast and Furious operation as far back as July 2010.
[02:56:43.060 --> 02:56:46.900]  That directly contradicts his statement to Congress.
[02:56:46.900 --> 02:56:50.340]  And for you guys who don't know about this, no, I'm not talking about Vin Diesel and all
[02:56:50.340 --> 02:56:54.540]  those guys, Operation Fast and Furious, which happened under the Justice Department, was
[02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:59.260]  a plan to give, or not just a plan, something that was actually implemented and done.
[02:56:59.260 --> 02:57:05.860]  They handed over functioning weapons to Mexican drug cartels to track the weapons.
[02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:10.900]  So I guess their logic was like, yeah, we'll let these guys take these guns, functioning
[02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:15.740]  guns, not malfunctioned or, you know, not deformed or any way.
[02:57:15.740 --> 02:57:18.220]  We'll give these guys the guns to go out there and commit crimes.
[02:57:18.220 --> 02:57:23.860]  And then when we catch these guns at the crime scenes, we'll know these guys were handlers
[02:57:23.860 --> 02:57:24.860]  of the guns.
[02:57:24.860 --> 02:57:28.380]  We'll be able to trace the guns back, which makes no sense because how many innocent people
[02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:32.660]  are going to die in this plan before it comes to fruition.
[02:57:32.660 --> 02:57:35.780]  And also, beyond that, you want to talk about arming the people.
[02:57:35.780 --> 02:57:37.900]  Let's talk about arming ISIS rebels.
[02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:42.780]  The article came out last year, air dropping grenades into the hands of ISIS.
[02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:44.900]  And people will say, this is not a big deal.
[02:57:44.900 --> 02:57:48.460]  A pallet of grenades is not going to take down the U.S. military.
[02:57:48.460 --> 02:57:49.460]  I do agree.
[02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:53.180]  But what about all the innocent civilians who are unarmed in those regions?
[02:57:53.180 --> 02:57:55.100]  They have to conflict with this now.
[02:57:55.100 --> 02:57:56.620]  Disarming people isn't the way to go.
[02:57:56.620 --> 02:58:00.700]  And we saw this recently with the representative in Michigan, you know, shooting his shotgun
[02:58:00.700 --> 02:58:02.180]  at his ex-wife's car.
[02:58:02.180 --> 02:58:03.500]  Jakari Jackson signing off.
[02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:07.020]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[02:58:07.020 --> 02:58:09.660]  All right, that's a good report Jakari put out.
[02:58:09.660 --> 02:58:12.860]  But what Jakari is really doing, I asked somebody in the office to step up and do this a few
[02:58:12.860 --> 02:58:13.860]  weeks ago.
[02:58:13.860 --> 02:58:15.980]  Jakari's volunteered.
[02:58:15.980 --> 02:58:19.940]  Next Thursday, he'll be on the show this Sunday, at least calling in our studio to announce
[02:58:19.940 --> 02:58:23.060]  a very important demonstration, a pro-life demonstration.
[02:58:23.060 --> 02:58:27.540]  We're going to have next Thursday, during the show, we'll announce this Sunday or Monday.
[02:58:27.540 --> 02:58:29.500]  We haven't picked the Planned Parenthood place yet.
[02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:33.700]  We're going to be outside of it, not on their property, holding up signs that say black lives
[02:58:33.700 --> 02:58:36.900]  matter because 50-plus percent of black people are aborted.
[02:58:36.900 --> 02:58:38.140]  We're going to do that.
[02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:39.940]  It could become national news.
[02:58:39.940 --> 02:58:45.020]  We need to get all the pro-life people out there to be at this event next Thursday.
[02:58:45.020 --> 02:58:47.020]  And we'll announce that this Sunday.
[02:58:47.020 --> 02:58:48.020]  I will mark any.
[02:58:48.020 --> 02:58:50.620]  I will reveal this line, line, line.
[02:58:50.620 --> 02:58:56.060]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[02:58:56.060 --> 02:59:00.300]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:59:00.300 --> 02:59:03.020]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:59:03.020 --> 02:59:08.420]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[02:59:08.420 --> 02:59:12.940]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:59:12.940 --> 02:59:17.460]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[02:59:17.460 --> 02:59:18.460]  drugs.
[02:59:18.460 --> 02:59:22.380]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[02:59:22.380 --> 02:59:24.420]  that children would actually like and take.
[02:59:24.420 --> 02:59:27.980]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[02:59:27.980 --> 02:59:32.580]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing
[02:59:32.580 --> 02:59:38.060]  child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential
[02:59:38.060 --> 02:59:40.140]  nutrients that taste great.
[02:59:40.140 --> 02:59:43.380]  Obtain your child ease today at infowarslife.com.
[02:59:43.380 --> 02:59:49.460]  That's child ease exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[02:59:49.460 --> 03:00:00.180]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:00.180 --> 03:00:06.740]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:06.740 --> 03:00:12.660]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:00:12.660 --> 03:00:18.300]  Grout blamed on irreversible climate change ends after rainfall, USDA publishes healthy
[03:00:18.300 --> 03:00:20.940]  food photo to combat.
[03:00:20.940 --> 03:00:22.580]  Thanks Michelle Obama meme.
[03:00:22.580 --> 03:00:26.780]  Oh, I've seen these school lunches myself from local parents.
[03:00:26.780 --> 03:00:27.780]  I know.
[03:00:27.780 --> 03:00:31.820]  I mean, it's worse than prison food if it's following the Michelle Obama program.
[03:00:31.820 --> 03:00:37.380]  I went to public school and quite frankly, those lunches were tasty.
[03:00:37.380 --> 03:00:42.340]  They might have bet a little too much core intake, but good salads, good hamburgers and
[03:00:42.340 --> 03:00:51.060]  gelatoes, soups, but not now you look at the food now, man, it is, it is super max prison
[03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:53.620]  food beyond Corey in Minnesota.
[03:00:53.620 --> 03:00:54.620]  You're on the air.
[03:00:54.620 --> 03:00:55.620]  Go ahead.
[03:00:55.620 --> 03:00:56.620]  All right.
[03:00:56.620 --> 03:00:57.620]  Hey, Alex.
[03:00:57.620 --> 03:00:58.620]  How's it going?
[03:00:58.620 --> 03:00:59.620]  Good brother.
[03:00:59.620 --> 03:01:00.620]  Go ahead.
[03:01:00.620 --> 03:01:01.620]  Oh, I apologize.
[03:01:01.620 --> 03:01:04.780]  I didn't see that you said you were active duty.
[03:01:04.780 --> 03:01:06.980]  They got to make me look at what's written under this.
[03:01:06.980 --> 03:01:09.020]  I shouldn't have made you hold for 45 minutes.
[03:01:09.020 --> 03:01:11.220]  What's your take on Jade Helm?
[03:01:11.220 --> 03:01:16.100]  Oh, Jade Helm, it's just another step in the process, but good.
[03:01:16.100 --> 03:01:20.380]  I'm not, not necessarily too worried about it.
[03:01:20.380 --> 03:01:26.860]  Just simply for the fact that there's so many people, ordinary people calling, you know,
[03:01:26.860 --> 03:01:29.900]  everywhere at news stations and newspapers everywhere.
[03:01:29.900 --> 03:01:33.300]  There's so many people that are, that are so worried about it, that never worry about
[03:01:33.300 --> 03:01:34.300]  anything.
[03:01:34.300 --> 03:01:36.380]  It is the people that drink the fluoride and they're worried about it.
[03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:39.860]  So in all honesty, that's actually one thing I'm not that worried about.
[03:01:39.860 --> 03:01:41.340]  I agree.
[03:01:41.340 --> 03:01:48.660]  Why are they freaking out over something when we've covered stuff way more hardcore?
[03:01:48.660 --> 03:01:53.980]  Because when you tell the truth so much, eventually the truth starts getting out.
[03:01:53.980 --> 03:01:59.820]  And when the truth gets out, there's, there's kind of, there's a shift in news that the
[03:01:59.820 --> 03:02:01.380]  media can only do one of two things.
[03:02:01.380 --> 03:02:04.300]  They can either cover it up or they can report on it.
[03:02:04.300 --> 03:02:07.860]  And if they report on it, then it makes everybody freak out.
[03:02:07.860 --> 03:02:12.100]  But if they cover it up and it comes to find out this is legitimate, it makes it look like
[03:02:12.100 --> 03:02:14.700]  liars more, that much more.
[03:02:14.700 --> 03:02:16.780]  Well, exactly.
[03:02:16.780 --> 03:02:20.980]  And the fact that they're misrepresenting and saying that I said it's an imminent takeover.
[03:02:20.980 --> 03:02:23.740]  I said day one, it's conditioning.
[03:02:23.740 --> 03:02:27.260]  The public's gone with the fact it's a takeover because of the map.
[03:02:27.260 --> 03:02:30.340]  But that's not going to work when nothing happens this summer.
[03:02:30.340 --> 03:02:32.100]  And I'm hoping nothing happens.
[03:02:32.100 --> 03:02:39.500]  I really pray that, that, that some globalist operation doesn't attack a helicopter or something
[03:02:39.500 --> 03:02:40.700]  and say Patriots did it.
[03:02:40.700 --> 03:02:41.700]  What do you think?
[03:02:41.700 --> 03:02:42.700]  Yeah.
[03:02:42.700 --> 03:02:48.540]  Um, the, the Patriots in all honesty, that's, that's actually what I'm worried about the
[03:02:48.540 --> 03:02:49.540]  most.
[03:02:49.540 --> 03:02:52.860]  And as a matter of fact, I'd like to give you kind of a, a gist on something real quick
[03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:53.860]  and I'd like your take.
[03:02:53.860 --> 03:02:54.860]  If that's okay.
[03:02:54.860 --> 03:02:55.860]  Sure.
[03:02:55.860 --> 03:02:56.860]  Go ahead.
[03:02:56.860 --> 03:02:57.860]  Okay.
[03:02:57.860 --> 03:02:58.860]  I'm a Patriot.
[03:02:58.860 --> 03:03:02.820]  Um, I've had four tours to Afghanistan.
[03:03:02.820 --> 03:03:07.460]  Um, I was growing up from a kid, always been told, you know, you serve your, you do your
[03:03:07.460 --> 03:03:08.460]  time.
[03:03:08.460 --> 03:03:11.820]  Well, that being said, I have pride in my country.
[03:03:11.820 --> 03:03:15.380]  You know, I take pride in that flag that they so step on recently.
[03:03:15.380 --> 03:03:22.980]  Now, I noticed that there's not so much as a, yes, I do see that we are divided, but there's
[03:03:22.980 --> 03:03:27.900]  got to be that great division point come at some point in time where the left is against
[03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:33.460]  the right, you know, three man for himself kind of thing, but I'm not seeing that.
[03:03:33.460 --> 03:03:38.300]  All I can see is this, this left is so extreme and everybody just thinks that they're so
[03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:39.300]  ignorant.
[03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:45.460]  Well, I can tell you one thing, me being active duty, I see it every single day.
[03:03:45.460 --> 03:03:48.620]  Absolute disgust, absolute disgust.
[03:03:48.620 --> 03:03:52.580]  People are so angry with what these people are doing stomping on these flags.
[03:03:52.580 --> 03:03:57.380]  I mean, they're talking every single day about, we got to do something about this.
[03:03:57.380 --> 03:04:02.300]  We got to do something about this and, and, and you know, I'm one of them.
[03:04:02.300 --> 03:04:08.620]  When I see someone stomp on my flag that every man before me has absolutely laid his life
[03:04:08.620 --> 03:04:09.620]  down.
[03:04:09.620 --> 03:04:10.620]  Sure.
[03:04:10.620 --> 03:04:11.620]  The flag is a symbol of the republic.
[03:04:11.620 --> 03:04:16.100]  So, so we respect it, but, but, but it, it is like a capturing of the flag.
[03:04:16.100 --> 03:04:22.020]  It is a desecration so that we'll accept more and more in the future, but the flag symbolizes
[03:04:22.020 --> 03:04:23.020]  the first amendment.
[03:04:23.020 --> 03:04:29.060]  You know, idiots have a right, the larger issue is what the flag symbolizes is being
[03:04:29.060 --> 03:04:30.060]  desecrated.
[03:04:30.060 --> 03:04:33.140]  I'm going to do some more overdrive, Corey, I'm going to come back, but you finish your
[03:04:33.140 --> 03:04:36.180]  point and go to Nelson, Aaron, Clarence and Rebecca, and that'll be it.
[03:04:36.180 --> 03:04:45.140]  I'm just going to 20 after, but we will discuss this more, don't, don't hang up, Corey.
[03:04:45.140 --> 03:04:49.860]  The globalists want to use the military to take the country over, but they want to destroy
[03:04:49.860 --> 03:04:53.580]  the military in that process and take out both their enemies.
[03:04:53.580 --> 03:04:58.380]  That's why we have to stop them starting a civil war.
[03:04:58.380 --> 03:05:02.380]  You pick up the receiver with your heart racing and sweat dripping from your forehead.
[03:05:02.380 --> 03:05:05.980]  You finally muster the courage to dial the number to call into your favorite talk radio
[03:05:05.980 --> 03:05:06.980]  show.
[03:05:06.980 --> 03:05:07.980]  It rings once, twice, and then.
[03:05:07.980 --> 03:05:08.980]  Hello, it's GCN.

[03:05:13.820 --> 03:05:14.820]  Jason from Minnesota.
[03:05:14.820 --> 03:05:15.820]  Please hold.
[03:05:15.820 --> 03:05:19.580]  As you patiently wait for your turn, you begin to date with me about being a famous talk
[03:05:19.580 --> 03:05:22.580]  radio host, and what it would be like to have your own show.
[03:05:22.580 --> 03:05:24.820]  Jason from Minnesota, you're up.
[03:05:24.820 --> 03:05:28.420]  Millions of loyal listeners worldwide waiting to call and talk to you.
[03:05:28.420 --> 03:05:29.780]  What color are you there?

[03:05:35.340 --> 03:05:36.340]  Going once, twice.
[03:05:36.340 --> 03:05:38.820]  Okay, we've got to move on to the next caller.
[03:05:38.820 --> 03:05:39.820]  You blew it.
[03:05:39.820 --> 03:05:40.820]  Huh?

[03:06:01.020 --> 03:06:06.740]  I'll also enjoy what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:06:06.740 --> 03:06:10.780]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[03:06:10.780 --> 03:06:15.140]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:06:15.140 --> 03:06:20.460]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[03:06:31.900 --> 03:06:33.860]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:06:33.860 --> 03:06:38.300]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[03:06:38.300 --> 03:06:40.860]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[03:07:58.820 --> 03:08:04.740]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[03:08:04.740 --> 03:08:07.740]  a war on for your mind.
[03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:17.900]  Cory is active duty and he was saying that he's sick of seeing the American flag being
[03:08:17.900 --> 03:08:18.900]  banned.
[03:08:18.900 --> 03:08:33.460]  If it was a Nazi flag, I'd be upset or a New Black Panther flag or a La Raza flag, a Mecha
[03:08:33.460 --> 03:08:39.220]  flag, whatever, an extremist flag, a lot of people don't like the American flag because
[03:08:39.220 --> 03:08:43.580]  it symbolizes all these wars and stuff, but you've got to compare our country to other
[03:08:43.580 --> 03:08:51.620]  countries as well throughout history and the ideals that that flag originally stood for.
[03:08:51.620 --> 03:08:56.540]  But you have to also look at the perspective of the people that do want to pull down the
[03:08:56.540 --> 03:08:59.700]  American flag and urinate on it and burn it.
[03:08:59.700 --> 03:09:06.980]  They are saying we've conquered you, we've dominated you and your First Amendment.
[03:09:06.980 --> 03:09:07.980]  That's why I hate ISIS.
[03:09:07.980 --> 03:09:11.780]  I mean, they don't just brutalize innocent people and all the rest of it.
[03:09:11.780 --> 03:09:21.940]  They are here to destroy free speech and our renaissance system, our classically liberal
[03:09:21.940 --> 03:09:23.500]  system.
[03:09:23.500 --> 03:09:29.660]  That means you have real diversity, not you adopt what the outside minority coming in
[03:09:29.660 --> 03:09:35.500]  says to prove you're not racist.
[03:09:35.500 --> 03:09:40.000]  Basically political correctness is about giving up your own culture, giving up your survival
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:47.100]  instinct and being a slave and living in a guilt-ridden mind control system.
[03:09:47.100 --> 03:09:55.260]  But since Corey mentioned it, and we've got Nelson and others, here is a clip dealing
[03:09:55.260 --> 03:10:00.500]  with what happened in South Carolina at the school where they said you can't have a flag
[03:10:00.500 --> 03:10:07.300]  on your truck because it's offensive to some and then it expands from there.
[03:10:07.300 --> 03:10:10.700]  People began to protest and everybody basically came back with flags and they had to back
[03:10:10.700 --> 03:10:11.700]  off.
[03:10:11.700 --> 03:10:12.700]  Here it is.
[03:10:12.700 --> 03:10:16.820]  Outside your comprehensive high school, there's no shortage of flags.
[03:10:16.820 --> 03:10:20.940]  When I hear that you can't fly the flag, it makes my blood run red and my blood is red.
[03:10:20.940 --> 03:10:23.340]  Or support for patriotism.
[03:10:23.340 --> 03:10:25.900]  We fought for it, I fought for it.
[03:10:25.900 --> 03:10:30.060]  Lines of people are here because senior Peyton Robinson was told he couldn't fly any flag
[03:10:30.060 --> 03:10:32.340]  from his truck Wednesday, including old glory.
[03:10:32.340 --> 03:10:38.540]  I've had family in the military who served, it's not just that, but every American has
[03:10:38.540 --> 03:10:42.140]  the right to fly the American flag if they want.
[03:10:42.140 --> 03:10:44.020]  School leaders called it a safety concern.
[03:10:44.020 --> 03:10:49.380]  Anytime you get a flag of any kind flying, it creates a visual distraction.
[03:10:49.380 --> 03:11:10.060]  If you read what really happened, they said they couldn't have the flag because it was
[03:11:10.060 --> 03:11:14.380]  offensive to some, then they spun it to do that, just like in all the other cases saying
[03:11:14.380 --> 03:11:18.140]  it's just not, here's the deal.
[03:11:18.140 --> 03:11:22.260]  On one end, people that just freak out about the flag all day, it's annoying because they
[03:11:22.260 --> 03:11:26.500]  don't care about any of the basic liberties it symbolizes, they won't defend those.
[03:11:26.500 --> 03:11:30.300]  But a lot of folks that do like the flag, do do that.
[03:11:30.300 --> 03:11:35.900]  I like old glory, but what I really like is the First Amendment and the Second Amendment
[03:11:35.900 --> 03:11:42.420]  and the Tenth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment, and that's been destroyed to a great extent.
[03:11:42.420 --> 03:11:46.260]  And now they're coming in for the remnants of what's left because they know that out
[03:11:46.260 --> 03:11:51.060]  of that, out of those ashes, freedom could rise again.
[03:11:51.060 --> 03:11:58.900]  But yes, in a country where kids were chanting at a, last year at a San Antonio basketball
[03:11:58.900 --> 03:12:06.260]  game that I went and looked at the schools, demographics, both schools are about 60% Hispanic
[03:12:06.260 --> 03:12:08.780]  and San Antonio is very military.
[03:12:08.780 --> 03:12:15.060]  They were chanting USA, USA when they were winning and someone on the other team said
[03:12:15.060 --> 03:12:17.340]  they thought that was racist.
[03:12:17.340 --> 03:12:21.020]  That's like saying brown bags are racist, no.
[03:12:21.020 --> 03:12:26.740]  It's almost an idiotic thing people do, I mean sometimes it makes sense, like if somebody
[03:12:26.740 --> 03:12:30.060]  defends the First Amendment, then you chant USA, USA.
[03:12:30.060 --> 03:12:38.100]  I've been at an event being arrested for demonstrating and people were chanting USA, USA, well it's
[03:12:38.100 --> 03:12:40.820]  being detained, they let me out of the police car actually.
[03:12:40.820 --> 03:12:47.540]  It was down at the contested election between Al Gore and George Bush, there were Democrats
[03:12:47.540 --> 03:12:51.980]  and Republicans hitting each other and fighting and everything else and some ABC News guy
[03:12:51.980 --> 03:12:56.980]  charged me and pushed me in the throat, so I yelled back at him, the cops come over,
[03:12:56.980 --> 03:13:00.420]  and then there were some Republicans thought that I must be with the Democrats.
[03:13:00.420 --> 03:13:03.960]  So as I was being, I guess I was technically arrested but wasn't taken to jail, they were
[03:13:03.960 --> 03:13:09.780]  chanting USA, boy that's, yeah, yeah, somebody's going to jail for their free speech, USA,
[03:13:09.780 --> 03:13:18.740]  but I just love how the school spun it because it was first in the newspaper that no indeed
[03:13:18.740 --> 03:13:23.020]  the American flag can be seen as offensive and other schools are putting in similar policies
[03:13:23.020 --> 03:13:24.540]  across the country.
[03:13:24.540 --> 03:13:27.900]  Corey in Minnesota, any closing comments on that?
[03:13:27.900 --> 03:13:38.500]  Yeah, I just, you know, everybody's so sick of it, it's so ridiculous that the people
[03:13:38.500 --> 03:13:42.900]  that are out there that are just so clinging to their game boys and whatnot, they just
[03:13:42.900 --> 03:13:43.900]  won't wake up.
[03:13:43.900 --> 03:13:51.940]  Well, what type of country is creating a climate where the politically correct thing, you can't
[03:13:51.940 --> 03:13:56.100]  have brown paper bags or American flag because something might be offensive, I appreciate
[03:13:56.100 --> 03:13:58.220]  your call.
[03:13:58.220 --> 03:14:04.140]  I mean, it really is crazy town that they came out and said, don't use the word bossy
[03:14:04.140 --> 03:14:10.660]  because it could pertain to women, well, that was bossy.
[03:14:10.660 --> 03:14:17.700]  I mean, it's just, or MSNBC with promos going, your kids don't belong to you.
[03:14:17.700 --> 03:14:22.660]  It's all just part of them dominating, Nelson in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:14:22.660 --> 03:14:25.140]  Hey, can you hear me, Alex?
[03:14:25.140 --> 03:14:26.140]  Yes, sir, I can go ahead.
[03:14:26.140 --> 03:14:30.460]  All right, so I want to talk about waiting people up first, what's you before about
[03:14:30.460 --> 03:14:38.500]  trying to have these concert events in towns and promoting the Constitution and celebrating
[03:14:38.500 --> 03:14:44.660]  and remembering while we have it and call it, we the people constitutional freedom tour.
[03:14:44.660 --> 03:14:49.900]  And I think this is a great way to create info warriors in each town.
[03:14:49.900 --> 03:14:53.460]  That's a problem that people don't have the proper information.
[03:14:53.460 --> 03:14:54.460]  And I think we should hear you.
[03:14:54.460 --> 03:14:55.460]  No, I hear you.
[03:14:55.460 --> 03:14:56.660]  I just can't even organize anything else.
[03:14:56.660 --> 03:14:57.660]  I'm maxed out.
[03:14:57.660 --> 03:14:59.300]  So people need to do that.
[03:14:59.300 --> 03:15:03.180]  You also wanted to talk about other ways to wake people up.
[03:15:03.180 --> 03:15:09.060]  Well, that's, that's the way I've been trying to, you know, I'm a musician here in South
[03:15:09.060 --> 03:15:14.620]  Florida and I put it on all my material, you know, you know, form citizen for info wars
[03:15:14.620 --> 03:15:17.660]  dot com, the future of America depends on it.
[03:15:17.660 --> 03:15:21.300]  And people come up to me all the time, like the gentleman before me just spoke how people
[03:15:21.300 --> 03:15:22.300]  are fed up.
[03:15:22.300 --> 03:15:23.820]  Well, that's what I'm learning into too.
[03:15:23.820 --> 03:15:27.860]  And I protest on the side of the roads with my signs and say, I want to impeach Obama
[03:15:27.860 --> 03:15:29.740]  and everybody haunts.
[03:15:29.740 --> 03:15:30.740]  That's wonderful.
[03:15:30.740 --> 03:15:35.420]  You know, I'm trying to create, you know, events where, you know, it's all about celebrating
[03:15:35.420 --> 03:15:40.460]  a family and, you know, Mayberry and what America used to be.
[03:15:40.460 --> 03:15:43.660]  And you know, my name is Nelson Williams and I want to, you know, be on tour.
[03:15:43.660 --> 03:15:46.220]  I've been had a way on a cash, you know, that's what I do.
[03:15:46.220 --> 03:15:49.060]  And that's America's music and people love that.
[03:15:49.060 --> 03:15:51.140]  And they love my message when I'm out singing.
[03:15:51.140 --> 03:15:52.140]  And I think.
[03:15:52.140 --> 03:15:53.140]  No, no, I hear you.
[03:15:53.140 --> 03:15:54.140]  It's incredibly positive.
[03:15:54.140 --> 03:15:58.620]  Now, you get to everybody knows them, but thank you for what you're doing.
[03:15:58.620 --> 03:16:02.300]  That's why they want to get a civil war going because we're winning.
[03:16:02.300 --> 03:16:04.340]  People are fed up across the board.
[03:16:04.340 --> 03:16:05.900]  It's only mainstream media.
[03:16:05.900 --> 03:16:11.380]  And if some of their idiot followers, a minority of people, mainly a bunch of white trendies
[03:16:11.380 --> 03:16:15.940]  who are trying to stir all this up because they know they're not in control just because
[03:16:15.940 --> 03:16:21.860]  in every sitcom and every movie, they lace their messages, people are sick of it.
[03:16:21.860 --> 03:16:27.420]  And once the public knows they're being force fed, no amount of it is going to work.
[03:16:27.420 --> 03:16:32.020]  In fact, you can get a major backlash.
[03:16:32.020 --> 03:16:34.300]  And that's happened.
[03:16:34.300 --> 03:16:38.580]  And when there's a backlash against them, they will blow stuff up to blame it on us.
[03:16:38.580 --> 03:16:42.860]  They will shoot stuff up to blame it on us and you better believe they're getting ready
[03:16:42.860 --> 03:16:43.860]  for that.
[03:16:43.860 --> 03:16:49.420]  Just like I told you, get ready for ISIS to start shooting up public places and it started
[03:16:49.420 --> 03:16:52.220]  all over the world.
[03:16:52.220 --> 03:16:53.620]  I mean, I've studied these people.
[03:16:53.620 --> 03:16:56.580]  I know how they operate.
[03:16:56.580 --> 03:16:57.580]  I'm not bragging.
[03:16:57.580 --> 03:17:00.380]  I'm just saying we know what we're talking about, Rebecca in Washington, you're on the
[03:17:00.380 --> 03:17:01.380]  air.
[03:17:01.380 --> 03:17:02.380]  Thanks for holding.
[03:17:02.380 --> 03:17:03.380]  Yeah.
[03:17:03.380 --> 03:17:04.380]  Hi, Alex.
[03:17:04.380 --> 03:17:05.380]  Can you hear me?
[03:17:05.380 --> 03:17:06.380]  I sure can.
[03:17:06.380 --> 03:17:07.380]  Thank you.
[03:17:07.380 --> 03:17:14.420]  Hey, I just wanted to talk to you regarding the GMO foods that they're feeding our population
[03:17:14.420 --> 03:17:18.140]  and making us all sick so we can't fight back.
[03:17:18.140 --> 03:17:22.260]  You know, a sick population can't fight if they're sick.
[03:17:22.260 --> 03:17:27.780]  And now they've put it in the alfalfa grasses that's contaminating all the organic alfalfa
[03:17:27.780 --> 03:17:30.180]  that feeds our animals.
[03:17:30.180 --> 03:17:44.380]  And I am just, I am so upset and cannot believe that the USDA would allow them to, that Monsanto
[03:17:44.380 --> 03:17:52.460]  have the farmers feed their alfalfa with this GMO foods.
[03:17:52.460 --> 03:17:58.500]  Well, when we know what they're doing to us, yes, it is crazy.
[03:17:58.500 --> 03:18:01.300]  Again, it's all over the top, Rebecca.
[03:18:01.300 --> 03:18:08.780]  Well, how do you, it's even causing division in families because, you know, they're so
[03:18:08.780 --> 03:18:14.100]  uneducated and you try to talk to them about it and they don't want to hear it.
[03:18:14.100 --> 03:18:15.500]  They want to be lazy.
[03:18:15.500 --> 03:18:20.060]  Listen, I know people that are in the liberty movement and they'll offer me a piece of gum
[03:18:20.060 --> 03:18:21.340]  and I'll say, can I see that package?
[03:18:21.340 --> 03:18:23.420]  And I'll go, it's got aspartame in it.
[03:18:23.420 --> 03:18:24.420]  They go, oh, big deal.
[03:18:24.420 --> 03:18:25.420]  Everything's bad for you.
[03:18:25.420 --> 03:18:29.100]  And I go, no, no, no, this is really bad for you.
[03:18:29.100 --> 03:18:30.100]  This is wood alcohol.
[03:18:30.100 --> 03:18:35.220]  They go, well, all I know is, is that regular gum, sugar gum, doesn't taste good in a minute
[03:18:35.220 --> 03:18:36.220]  or two.
[03:18:36.220 --> 03:18:37.220]  This tastes good for 20 minutes.
[03:18:37.220 --> 03:18:42.540]  And I said, yeah, because it's, I said, Annie freeze for cats, you know, tastes good too,
[03:18:42.540 --> 03:18:44.340]  it kills them.
[03:18:44.340 --> 03:18:50.020]  So it's just crazy because people get in an environment, they get comfortable and they
[03:18:50.020 --> 03:18:51.020]  think it's okay.
[03:18:51.020 --> 03:18:52.020]  I'm out of time.
[03:18:52.020 --> 03:18:53.020]  I tried to rush.
[03:18:53.020 --> 03:18:55.060]  We don't have time to go to Clarence, Aaron and Dawn.
[03:18:55.060 --> 03:18:56.060]  I apologize.
[03:18:56.060 --> 03:18:57.060]  I'll be back.
[03:18:57.060 --> 03:19:01.460]  Lord willing, this Sunday retransmission is about to start in T minus 60 seconds.
[03:19:01.460 --> 03:19:08.100]  I'll be back Sunday, four to six PM central with a lot of breaking news and can tell.
[03:19:08.100 --> 03:19:13.580]  Please continue to spread the word about info wars.com about prison planet.com.
[03:19:13.580 --> 03:19:17.380]  We're not perfect here, but we're trying our best and we're having a big effect.
[03:19:17.380 --> 03:19:18.900]  Thanks to you.
[03:19:18.900 --> 03:19:20.380]  You are the power of the info wars.

[03:19:29.860 --> 03:19:31.620]  with the info wars.
[03:19:31.620 --> 03:19:35.980]  That's why we're growing so fast and why the system's so scared.
[03:19:35.980 --> 03:19:41.300]  If I don't get, it was, you know, the fellow that exposed JFK Jim Garrison said the only
[03:19:41.300 --> 03:19:44.820]  way he stood the state alive was to get bigger and stay on the spotlight.
[03:19:44.820 --> 03:19:45.820]  That's when I'm safe.
[03:19:45.820 --> 03:19:49.820]  So I've either got to get bigger or totally quit or they're going to destroy me.
[03:19:49.820 --> 03:19:52.660]  So we made the decision to go all out against the globalist.
[03:19:52.660 --> 03:19:53.660]  Please pray for us.
[03:19:53.660 --> 03:19:54.660]  Please spread the word.
[03:19:54.660 --> 03:20:09.660]  We're going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
