[00:00.000 --> 00:15.840]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones
[00:30.160 --> 00:35.040]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome to another original live global transmission
[00:35.040 --> 00:42.000]  we'll be here for the next two hours it is Sunday the 27th day of September 2015
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.680]  I am your host Alex Jones David Knight and Jakari Jackson are both in Philadelphia
[00:48.640 --> 00:55.680]  where a foreign leader of state a religious leader is calling for open borders and engage in
[00:55.680 --> 01:00.320]  domestic political operations inside the United States we're told we have separation church
[01:00.320 --> 01:06.160]  and state in this country that's been twisted to where the government controls and issues licenses
[01:06.160 --> 01:12.720]  to religion to churches and turns them into charitable organizations and then tells them
[01:12.720 --> 01:18.400]  that they can't have any views whether it's abortion open borders gun control you name it
[01:18.400 --> 01:25.600]  if those ideas are conservative or libertarian but if you are the Marxist Pope Francis and a foreign
[01:25.600 --> 01:33.920]  head of state you can come here as a sovereign and pontificate endlessly to the public manipulating
[01:33.920 --> 01:40.720]  our internal politics and universally from Fox News to CNN we're told there can be no criticism of
[01:40.720 --> 01:46.080]  Francis and that he's not being political that's the talking point he's not being political he's
[01:46.080 --> 01:49.920]  not being politically he just wants carbon taxes and world government and open borders
[01:50.560 --> 01:54.880]  and higher taxes in the middle class he's not being political he's not being political did we
[01:54.880 --> 02:01.840]  tell you he's not being political let's say one more time he's not being political so day
[02:01.840 --> 02:06.960]  to night and jacari Jackson with their final report from the road covering the pope and his
[02:06.960 --> 02:16.640]  entire us whirlwind tour of the east coast of dc new york and now pennsylvania we're gonna be
[02:16.640 --> 02:22.400]  breaking that down and then to really look at political persecution in this country i was thinking
[02:22.400 --> 02:26.880]  about it the last few days and i think i'm going to make a mini documentary on the subject and
[02:26.880 --> 02:30.640]  then investigate some of the people in these different federal agencies and really burrow
[02:30.640 --> 02:34.960]  into their activities and call for congressional investigations of them like we've done lowest
[02:34.960 --> 02:40.160]  learner and others like we called for the downing of a bainer spearheaded that operation we're very
[02:40.160 --> 02:45.840]  proud of it with congressman jones and others you see how that went i thought that we should look
[02:45.840 --> 02:51.040]  at some of the political persecution with joe banister former treasury agent who went public
[02:51.040 --> 02:58.480]  exposing of the irs as a fraud they indicted him repeatedly uh for his free speech and speaking
[02:58.480 --> 03:04.880]  of free speech the un released his plan to push for worldwide internet censorship they plan to have
[03:04.880 --> 03:10.720]  the sec and ftc here in america in free speech we'll be breaking that report down this is from
[03:10.720 --> 03:16.320]  right bark the un wants to censor the entire internet to save feminist feelings and actually
[03:16.320 --> 03:24.160]  say in congressional and un committee hearings that cyber violence is translated towards women
[03:24.160 --> 03:30.640]  being criticized in any way on the internet and this is the new cultural Marxism going on at
[03:30.640 --> 03:37.280]  university i was talking to a liberal that i've known since college who was going back to college
[03:37.280 --> 03:44.080]  he's a hollywood film editor but he got tired of that and so he he wants to get a as a doctorate
[03:44.080 --> 03:52.400]  and then a phd in psychology and was telling me about ut and just how he's like no no liberalism
[03:52.400 --> 03:57.680]  as we hear all points of view and they're like no we bring down the patriarchy and white males
[03:57.680 --> 04:02.720]  they are evil you are a white male you are inherently evil well no that's that sounds like
[04:02.720 --> 04:10.000]  racism to me oh really we'll just have the dean put you on academic suspension academic um academic
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.320]  probation this is what america is totalitarianism wrapped in political correct there's nothing
[04:16.320 --> 04:24.400]  politically correct or liberal about it it is classical tyrannical mafia takeover and speaking
[04:24.400 --> 04:30.560]  of censorship in england if you try to do a radio show tv show or blog criticizing radical
[04:30.560 --> 04:37.600]  islam you get arrested same thing in germany anti isis artwork banned from free speech event

[06:14.800 --> 06:18.000]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for joining us
[06:18.000 --> 06:28.480]  on this 27th day of september 2015 i'm your host alex jones david night jacari jackson
[06:28.480 --> 06:32.880]  will be joining us at the bottom of the hour as they cover pope francis's historic political
[06:33.920 --> 06:38.560]  operation here in america to open the borders and bring in global government and sell a carbon
[06:38.560 --> 06:44.640]  tax and more he's also anti-gun even though he's protected by men with guns that is coming up and
[06:44.640 --> 06:49.280]  then of course we are going to have former treasury agent the blue the whistle on the
[06:49.280 --> 06:54.320]  fact that the federal reserve is a private run-for-profit organization and the treasury
[06:54.320 --> 06:59.520]  department's fully aware of that he's going to be joining us to talk about political persecution
[06:59.520 --> 07:06.560]  in this country which has admittedly reached all-time highs with lowest learner in the irs and
[07:06.560 --> 07:11.040]  the internal memos coming out that they were told to target more than 10 000 conservative
[07:11.040 --> 07:17.760]  christian libertarian veteran and gun grips and they haven't gotten in trouble for the incredible
[07:17.760 --> 07:24.400]  criminal activities that dwarf thousands of times what richard nixon did richard had 120
[07:24.400 --> 07:32.080]  something names nixon did that he didn't even act on in a safe with their irs records and that was
[07:32.080 --> 07:38.000]  criminal he should have stepped down for it they openly engage in mass criminal operations
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.760]  they give out tens of thousands of tax exemptions to liberal socialist and communist groups and in
[07:43.760 --> 07:50.080]  the last five years have given out one tax exemption to a conservative group that's the way
[07:50.080 --> 07:56.800]  to shut down political speech then you have pope frances come in endorse obama call for open borders
[07:56.800 --> 08:02.720]  call for carbon taxes call for global government call for everything else you can imagine completely
[08:02.720 --> 08:10.400]  political where's the irs being sacked on the catholic church for that activity but again
[08:10.400 --> 08:15.200]  that's a fraud and then a fraud because congress shall make no law respecting an establishment
[08:15.200 --> 08:20.000]  of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or the press or the people's right to
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.560]  peacefully assemble for redress grievances that's the first amendment congress has no jurisdiction
[08:24.560 --> 08:31.760]  it's just come in and taken over the churches and bullied them if they are not socialist if
[08:31.760 --> 08:36.080]  they're not communist but if they are then reverend rye can get up their tax exempt and
[08:36.080 --> 08:44.240]  say gd america gd the police gd free market g you know down with america oh oh that's yeah
[08:44.240 --> 08:51.120]  oh yeah well here's how it works i've got my free speech if i was a church and rights got his free
[08:51.120 --> 08:58.320]  speech that's how that works see because congress has no jurisdiction but instead they just continued
[08:58.320 --> 09:04.720]  their jurisdiction they just expanded it to engage in this giant power grip and we have huge
[09:04.720 --> 09:10.160]  attacks on free speech that are simply incredible on the internet you name it being announced
[09:10.160 --> 09:18.480]  but first i want to get to hillary clinton she spent years blocking the release of her servers
[09:18.480 --> 09:22.800]  then she said they all got erased just like lowest learners said it turned out of course they'd
[09:22.800 --> 09:29.680]  ordered them a race but there were backups up in the cloud and so now they found huge caches of
[09:29.680 --> 09:39.200]  other emails where she's talking to patrice about classified things and patrice over some files at
[09:39.200 --> 09:46.320]  his home office had to step down and had to basically plead guilty to felonies but then time
[09:46.320 --> 09:52.720]  but then time served and i'm not defending patrice but compared to hillary it's like having
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.720]  a crooked toenail and then hillary is barbecuing children and then she doesn't get in trouble i mean
[09:58.720 --> 10:07.200]  it is totally two different worlds and now she just can't explain why she has these other emails
[10:07.200 --> 10:13.440]  that she says she didn't have and then she shoots her mouth off and says it's a conspiracy theory
[10:13.440 --> 10:19.600]  i'm convinced that if robbers were walking out of your house with your jewels your computers
[10:20.640 --> 10:25.200]  your artwork whatever and if they just said the average trendy you said hey quit robbing my house
[10:25.200 --> 10:29.200]  oh your conspiracy terrace well wait you've got a television set in your hands a computer in your
[10:29.200 --> 10:36.560]  hands you're putting them in a van you've got mask on it's 2 a.m they just go conspiracy theory
[10:36.560 --> 10:42.640]  you go whoa you're right it's all yours absolutely correct i mean that's the game they play but it
[10:42.640 --> 10:49.200]  was the clintons we learned from their clinton library lawsuits with uh joseph farrah and world
[10:49.200 --> 10:54.640]  end daily there they were in 93 when they first get in going we've got to shut down the new growing
[10:54.640 --> 10:58.560]  press the internet's going to allow a new independent press before drudge even existed
[10:58.560 --> 11:02.160]  we've got to shut down things like the western journalism center and joseph farrah and we've
[11:02.160 --> 11:06.640]  got to instruct all our operatives in the media when anyone challenges anything we say called
[11:06.640 --> 11:10.800]  a conspiracy theory hey everybody else wasn't making money in cattle futures you invested
[11:10.800 --> 11:14.800]  a thousand and got hundreds of thousands hey all the people that work for you are getting killed
[11:14.800 --> 11:19.680]  hey there's all these shut up conspiracy theorist hey you gave missile secrets to communist china
[11:19.680 --> 11:26.560]  it's all admitted conspiracy theory conspiracy theory conspiracy theory so this is what they
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.480]  engage in you've got hillary taking hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign governmental
[11:32.480 --> 11:36.960]  leaders totally illegal to her foundation while she's the head of the state department and then
[11:36.960 --> 11:44.240]  she removes the import export ban on us weapons to those countries i mean open and shut giant
[11:44.240 --> 11:53.920]  mega massive felonies in front of everyone and nothing's being done no instead they have
[11:55.040 --> 11:58.720]  the fbi and others investigating every tea party group every conservative group every
[11:58.720 --> 12:04.240]  libertarian group putting anesthesia in prison going after thousands of christian groups it is
[12:04.240 --> 12:12.880]  a reign of hitlerian terror but the democratic party in this country gets off on the criminal
[12:12.880 --> 12:17.520]  behavior they they're thugs now they're a organized crime syndicate the average minion
[12:17.520 --> 12:24.080]  likes it even as the unemployment goes up even as they lose their jobs even as they're sold out
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.280]  doubling black unemployment love it because they feel like they're part of the winning team
[12:29.280 --> 12:37.120]  clinton can't explain discrepancy from newly discovered email exchange with patrice this is
[12:37.120 --> 12:42.480]  meet the press here talking to one of her own former operatives it's interviewing her and she
[12:42.480 --> 12:47.600]  tells him it's a conspiracy theory here's the first clip you had said in a written statement
[12:47.600 --> 12:52.400]  under oath that you had turned over everything that you believed you had for the federal records
[12:52.400 --> 12:57.920]  with with those 55 000 emails but we've now discovered an email chain between then general
[12:57.920 --> 13:03.920]  patrice and yourself that took place a couple of months before these records started can you
[13:03.920 --> 13:09.120]  explain the discrepancy there because it was the same email address that you used while at state
[13:09.120 --> 13:13.280]  that you were using with general patrice just two months before you had said everything was out
[13:13.280 --> 13:18.240]  there well everything that we had access to was certainly out there and the reason we know about
[13:19.040 --> 13:24.320]  email chain with general patrice is because it was on a government server and so from my perspective
[13:24.320 --> 13:31.680]  we have a very thorough review process that we conducted and my attorneys supervised it
[13:31.680 --> 13:37.760]  they went through everything and what we had available at the time was turned over but i guess
[13:37.760 --> 13:43.040]  what i'm trying to figure out is if you'd said in march that uh that the email system began in
[13:43.040 --> 13:47.840]  march of 09 and yet we have the same email address popping up in january what what explain that
[13:47.840 --> 13:52.320]  discrepancy there was a transition period you know i wasn't that focused on my email account
[13:52.320 --> 13:58.960]  to be clear there yeah that's enough focused on it right her body language is just total
[13:58.960 --> 14:06.400]  thug mafia scum lisa jackson at the epa had another secret email and pen names as well known
[14:06.400 --> 14:12.400]  to plumes and she had to step down because it's criminal okay i want criminal charges against
[14:12.400 --> 14:17.440]  these people it's so obvious now let's go ahead and go to the next clip where she calls the conspiracy
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.720]  theory uh that she ever did anything wrong here it is hundred because they were clearly personal
[14:22.720 --> 14:28.080]  and not work related can you respond to an alternative explanation that has uh sort of another
[14:28.080 --> 14:33.200]  conspiracy theory let me let me question an online perhaps the reason you wanted to have a private
[14:33.200 --> 14:36.560]  server and not a government server is that republics have been coming after you for years
[14:37.600 --> 14:42.640]  you might have may have been running for president in the future and you wanted to make it a little
[14:42.640 --> 14:47.360]  more difficult for congressional investigators to subpoena your government emails and a little more
[14:47.360 --> 14:52.400]  difficult for freedom of information request is that is that fair theory or not it's totally
[14:53.280 --> 14:58.960]  ridiculous oh that never crossed my mind and in fact since more than 90 percent of my work
[14:58.960 --> 15:06.720]  related emails were on the system um they are subject to for any other request that's how the
[15:06.720 --> 15:11.680]  so she didn't have a private email with secret stuff on it to hide it from anybody of course
[15:11.680 --> 15:20.720]  not oh no never didn't have a second set of books ha she just sits there and shakes her head this is
[15:20.720 --> 15:25.520]  the person that ran Benghazi this is the person involved in fast and furious directing so much
[15:25.520 --> 15:32.000]  of it this is the person uh involved in so many criminal activities and she just sits there because
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  she's a woman and is wearing a pink dress she's allowed to commit crimes just like obama is part
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.880]  black so supposedly everyone must bow down and let him arrest members of the press persecute
[15:42.880 --> 15:48.720]  whistleblowers at a level never before seen and engage in all sorts of insider trading and crimes
[15:48.720 --> 15:54.880]  it's all okay because they're the good politically correct people and the republicans are blackmailed
[15:54.880 --> 16:01.680]  so they just lay down to it all introducing secret 12 the new info wars life vitamin b12

[20:55.600 --> 21:00.320]  every month that's people that see our material see our links it doesn't mean

[21:03.760 --> 21:10.080]  read it look at it see it and we're able to take stories that sound completely outlandish
[21:10.080 --> 21:18.400]  that have no believability take the evidence hammer it and get serious people to investigate it
[21:18.400 --> 21:23.040]  and look at it and five years four and a half years after we exposed the plan to destabilize
[21:23.040 --> 21:28.160]  libya to put al-qaeda in charge three years after we exposed the fact that they wanted
[21:28.160 --> 21:32.720]  to bring down a side to put in a Saudi arabian caliphate that's now mainstream news
[21:32.720 --> 21:39.360]  over and over again you can directly trace back where a story is forced out
[21:39.920 --> 21:47.040]  and breaks through to info wars dot com i'm not bragging i'm stating why we're in danger
[21:47.040 --> 21:51.520]  why we're being demonized why we're being attacked why we need your prayers and supports
[21:51.520 --> 21:58.320]  we are the tip of the spear drudge report is able to take stories even more often than we are
[21:58.320 --> 22:05.280]  are many times more often that are even mainstream alternative foreign or
[22:05.840 --> 22:13.040]  evidentiary smoking gun type legal documents and post them or link to them and then force
[22:13.040 --> 22:17.920]  a debate as well and that's what the mainstream media the dinosaur media the prostitute media
[22:17.920 --> 22:23.360]  the collaborator media the globalist media the trader media the trash media the decepticon media
[22:23.360 --> 22:30.640]  that's what they hate is they want to set the agenda on katelyn Jenner and on dr dray
[22:30.640 --> 22:36.400]  they want to set the agenda on nfl football they want to be able to set the agenda on how
[22:36.400 --> 22:40.960]  beautiful michelle obama's dress is and how gracious she is and how she hung the moon
[22:42.720 --> 22:48.080]  but more and more not just drudge not just info wars not just world that daily
[22:48.080 --> 22:56.800]  not just places even like breitbart or glenbeck even though i disagree with some of the things
[22:56.800 --> 23:02.240]  those folks do overall the globalists hate them they don't have it out for america they want to
[23:02.240 --> 23:06.400]  support the republic they want free market they they want a free country they're they're good guys
[23:07.360 --> 23:13.360]  there's some social corporate business rivalries at least on their side not with drudge or world
[23:13.360 --> 23:18.320]  not daily but with back and others but i don't care because i'm up against pure tyranny i know
[23:18.320 --> 23:22.560]  what the stakes are so i'm going to promote anybody that's standing up for freedom because
[23:22.560 --> 23:26.960]  let me tell you it's good to have other people out putting this info out because if they can
[23:26.960 --> 23:31.600]  shut down rush limbaugh if they can shut down matt drudge if they can shut down info wars if
[23:31.600 --> 23:36.720]  they can shut down glenbeck and believe me they've had dirty tricks against him if they can do that
[23:36.720 --> 23:44.960]  they can shut anybody down and and a new age of incredible censorship is now here
[23:46.480 --> 23:52.000]  and that's why in the face of it we're accelerating what we're doing and doubling down telling the
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.560]  truth because the time is short the reason they're moving ahead with bold censorship and dirty tricks
[23:58.560 --> 24:05.520]  and harassment is because people are listening people are waking up it's because we're effective
[24:05.520 --> 24:14.000]  we're popular we're a threat we're empowering people and the system doesn't like that at all

[35:09.920 --> 35:16.880]  conservative churches that criticize obama have the irs go after them why your church can't criticize

[35:40.160 --> 35:45.600]  oh the catholic church and the bishops can call for open borders and the pope i've got his quotes here
[35:47.280 --> 35:54.400]  can chastise donald trump in america for not taking enough people and not paying enough money
[35:54.400 --> 36:01.440]  when the catholic church won't pay for one anchor baby and they got 177 million acres worldwide
[36:01.440 --> 36:07.600]  upwards of 200 trillion dollars in assets and the first or second largest landowners in the world

[37:47.120 --> 37:51.520]  because we have a world meeting of families and earlier in the day the pope went to a prison
[37:52.240 --> 37:57.680]  those two might be connected if there was any justice he would be visiting some of his priests
[37:57.680 --> 38:02.720]  in prison but he didn't actually there are some high-ranking officials here in philadelphia
[38:02.720 --> 38:09.440]  we have the the most high-ranking church official ever to go to prison he went to prison alex for
[38:09.440 --> 38:14.560]  conspiracy conspiracy to cover up what these priests underneath them were doing they've had a
[38:14.560 --> 38:19.840]  long history of moving priests around who were known they were that caught them abusing children
[38:19.840 --> 38:24.400]  instead of reporting them to the authorities or even kicking them out of the church they would
[38:24.400 --> 38:30.960]  move them to another location now he said today earlier that god weeps about the sexual abuse
[38:30.960 --> 38:35.520]  of children yeah god weeps for him covering it up yes he said we're going to do something
[38:35.520 --> 38:41.360]  well he hasn't done anything about it for two and a half years as pope nothing at all about it
[38:41.360 --> 38:45.600]  for two and a half years let me tell you it was here in philadelphia just four years ago
[38:45.600 --> 38:52.080]  arch bishop regali retired went to tennessee because the entire arch diocese had been indicted
[38:52.080 --> 39:00.400]  for cover-ups now that same bishop joined this pope not once but twice on this trip as a vip
[39:00.400 --> 39:05.280]  that's how contrite how torn up this pope is about this scandal they have been covering this up
[39:05.280 --> 39:10.160]  there are thousands of cases of abuse in this particular case or over three dozen priests
[39:10.160 --> 39:14.800]  that were involved in this now prior to this the prior arch bishop here in philadelphia
[39:15.520 --> 39:21.440]  was uh who's now deceased in that particular case they had some secret archives that's what
[39:21.440 --> 39:29.200]  they call secret archives had a list of over 36 priests that were known pedophiles and they had
[39:29.200 --> 39:33.360]  next to their names the dates of which they had committed the crimes so they would know when the
[39:33.360 --> 39:39.440]  statute of limitations was out that's how cold and calculated they are with this alex and and it
[39:39.440 --> 39:45.120]  undermines i think we need to understand this because he comes here to put a moral authority
[39:45.120 --> 39:50.480]  on on all the things that you do when he's really the king of the pedophiles and they used the
[39:50.480 --> 39:55.840]  pedophilia takeover for the marxist infiltration of the church to now overthrow it so now they're
[39:55.840 --> 39:59.680]  not blackmailing the media is not bringing up pedophilia anymore because the catholic church is
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.960]  now anti-family pro-abortion world government pushing they can now back off you can see the
[40:04.960 --> 40:10.800]  takeover absolutely and and alex you have to understand too the same trick that we see the
[40:10.800 --> 40:15.760]  politicians use all the time if you're going to create a an act of tyranny if you're going to legalize
[40:15.760 --> 40:21.120]  martial law you call it the patriot act if you're going to hide the fact that uh of what they're
[40:21.120 --> 40:26.800]  putting into your food you call it the safe and accurate labeling act okay they always do exactly
[40:26.800 --> 40:34.240]  the opposite so this master politician this pope comes to the very city where they've had the greatest
[40:34.240 --> 40:42.240]  reported incidences of child abuse by the clergy he comes to here and he holds a world meeting of
[40:42.240 --> 40:49.440]  families right on this site i mean how much colder more hypocritical can you be the i just know all
[40:49.440 --> 40:55.040]  these immigrants better wash bringing their kids around these folks yeah yeah yeah absolutely there
[40:55.040 --> 40:58.960]  there's you know if he's going to do something he needs to if he's going to talk about morality
[40:58.960 --> 41:04.160]  he needs to clean up his own house first it is absolutely amazing he needs to get the beam out
[41:04.160 --> 41:08.480]  of his eye before we get the speck out of ours yes yes we're going to try to meet with uh some
[41:08.480 --> 41:16.320]  spokesperson who had been uh there's a uh survivors of of abuse by uh uh priest it's a
[41:16.320 --> 41:22.720]  survivors network snap we're going to try to meet with some of them uh this evening to try to get
[41:22.720 --> 41:26.640]  information about them because this is very deep there's a lot of detail involved but i have to
[41:26.640 --> 41:31.280]  say there are literally thousands of cases of child abuse sure well this is a formula in the
[41:31.280 --> 41:36.160]  last hundred years they the globalist put the pedophile networks they do this every institution
[41:36.160 --> 41:41.040]  in they slowly took over i'm not defending the previous church because it's a fact and now the
[41:41.040 --> 41:46.720]  marxist globalist cabal has taken it over and now drop the whole thing because it's mission complete
[41:46.720 --> 41:51.120]  they took over with the corruption of the church they're now in charge and they've got their jesuit
[41:51.120 --> 41:55.920]  pope in there uh preaching the opposite of pope john paul the second i mean it is i mean i couldn't
[41:55.920 --> 42:00.160]  criticize pope john paul the second because he was anti-communist pro-family i'm certain i'm not
[42:00.160 --> 42:06.160]  saying he was perfect but now you see this new pope i mean either the old popes are bad and this
[42:06.160 --> 42:12.320]  guy's good or he's bad and they were good because there's such a separation yeah they're polar opposites
[42:12.320 --> 42:17.920]  now he's made a couple of statements they're very vague they're very general uh and just you know in
[42:17.920 --> 42:22.640]  terms of talking about the abuse as i mentioned you know god weeps and and this is a horrific thing
[42:22.640 --> 42:28.480]  but nothing specific he's taken no action and as i reported before the prior prior today the only
[42:28.480 --> 42:33.120]  time he had talked about this was to uh tell the clergy that he was sorry that they had the
[42:33.120 --> 42:37.360]  reputations sully well they should be sorry stay there day but night i want to come back and have
[42:37.360 --> 42:42.640]  you recap the last five six days you've covered with jacari overall how successful you think this

[46:57.120 --> 47:13.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:13.040 --> 47:28.960]  you want answers
[47:30.960 --> 47:32.000]  god weeps
[47:36.960 --> 47:42.880]  for the sexual abuse of children these cannot be
[47:42.880 --> 47:56.960]  maintained in secret. And I commit to a careful oversight to ensure that youth are protected
[47:56.960 --> 48:05.880]  and that all responsible will be held accountable.
[48:05.880 --> 48:09.560]  That's quite a claim when all they've been doing, and since he got in a few years ago
[48:09.560 --> 48:14.880]  is continuing to cover up, where are the prosecutions, where are the indictments, where are the
[48:14.880 --> 48:20.600]  people being defrocked, it's not happening. And this is how the Catholic Church got turned
[48:20.600 --> 48:25.240]  into what it is today. Just like Congress is full of pedophile rings, just like Penn
[48:25.240 --> 48:31.400]  State's a giant pedophile ring, just like continually we see this, the Texas Youth
[48:31.400 --> 48:34.720]  Commission had turned out was run by a bunch of pedophiles. I mean, they can take over
[48:34.720 --> 48:40.600]  any institution. It's very, very dangerous. I'm not singling out Catholics here, but
[48:40.600 --> 48:46.040]  now the Catholic Church is an open weapon against free market. The carbon taxes the
[48:46.040 --> 48:50.560]  Pope have pushed for, Lord Moncton broke the numbers down many years ago, would kill about
[48:50.560 --> 48:56.800]  a billion people in the third world in a decade, who are right at this subsistence level. We
[48:56.800 --> 49:01.840]  already have 40 million people a year starved to death. This is deindustrialization, this
[49:01.840 --> 49:06.280]  is neo-futilism. David Knight recapping the last five, six days of your coverage, then
[49:06.280 --> 49:10.640]  we're going to get a breakdown report from Jakari Jackson on the security theater.
[49:10.640 --> 49:17.800]  Yeah, Alex, it's been amazing. And I got to say, very, very disappointing to see the masses
[49:17.800 --> 49:24.960]  of crowds, to see the mainstream media reporting on this today. Earlier, they interviewed a
[49:24.960 --> 49:29.600]  police officer on the road. It's just National Guard and armies strung out all along the
[49:29.600 --> 49:34.280]  road. It's just amazing. And at the end of the interview, they said, thank you so much
[49:34.280 --> 49:39.720]  for your service. They're not serving us. They're not serving us. They are setting up
[49:39.720 --> 49:44.760]  a police state each time there's an event, whether it's a Super Bowl, the Pope coming
[49:44.760 --> 49:49.800]  every time. It gets bigger, it gets more out of control. It's the suspension of our rights,
[49:49.800 --> 49:55.920]  just easing us in to the tyranny. And nowhere has it been worse, Alex, than here in Philadelphia.
[49:55.920 --> 50:00.160]  My wife sent me articles earlier in the week. She said, oh, you better be careful when you
[50:00.160 --> 50:03.400]  get to Philadelphia. It's going to be incredibly crazy. I said, yeah, tell me about it. We're
[50:03.400 --> 50:07.320]  here in Washington. We're here in New York. I said, everybody likes to brag now about
[50:07.320 --> 50:13.680]  how wonderful and over the top their security is. Well, Philadelphia wins the prize. It was
[50:13.680 --> 50:19.240]  absolutely insane. They've locked down the entire city. The entire city has blockades
[50:19.240 --> 50:24.520]  and you can't get a taxi cab. We got here at 10 o'clock at night. They had shut down
[50:24.520 --> 50:29.040]  all taxi service. We were greeted by the military telling us that we would have to walk and
[50:29.040 --> 50:32.240]  hopefully they hadn't shut down the bridges yet. Well, they had shut down the bridges.
[50:32.240 --> 50:36.720]  So what would have been a nine minute ride turned into a 40 minute walk and then it turned
[50:36.720 --> 50:42.120]  into a two hour and 15 minute walk zigzagging all over the place. Good Lord. Not able to
[50:42.120 --> 50:47.880]  get through the TSA. There's remnants of TSA now. So that's total martial law when this
[50:47.880 --> 50:52.360]  guy comes. Absolutely. Absolutely. All of this. It's fair to say, they don't even do
[50:52.360 --> 50:56.920]  this for Obama. It's fair to say the Catholic Church run by the Marxist is now the king
[50:56.920 --> 51:03.360]  of America. This was him squatting on America and showing him he rules us. No, Alex, he's
[51:03.360 --> 51:08.920]  a humble man. You have to understand this is a guy who who rides a fiat after he flies
[51:08.920 --> 51:14.640]  in his private jumbo jet. And that's precisely the hypocrisy that we see with this talk about
[51:14.640 --> 51:21.120]  God weeping about pedophiles when he's been a Pope for two and a half years and the Archdiocese,
[51:21.120 --> 51:26.200]  the Archbishop here, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia had to leave town, had to retire and go to
[51:26.200 --> 51:31.680]  Tennessee because the Archdiocese itself had been indicted. He jumped out of town, but
[51:31.680 --> 51:36.960]  this guy brings him back and honors him as a VIP on multiple occasions on this trip.
[51:36.960 --> 51:41.200]  That's the hypocrisy. Talking about how transparent they're going to be. Transparent just like
[51:41.200 --> 51:46.280]  Obama, transparently criminal is what it is. It's absolutely amazing to see the hypocrisy.
[51:46.280 --> 51:50.600]  But the thing that concerns me the most, Alex, even more so than the security is the people's
[51:50.600 --> 51:57.160]  reaction to the security, the people's reaction to the Pope. The fact that, as Orwell said,
[51:57.160 --> 52:03.240]  the future was going to be a boot stomping in your face forever. The problem I see now
[52:03.240 --> 52:07.800]  is that the people who are having the boot stomped in their face want to lick it, want
[52:07.800 --> 52:13.280]  to praise it, want to honor it, thank it for kicking them in the face. It is disgusting.
[52:13.280 --> 52:18.160]  It's absolutely disgusting to see these people acting like slaves, the mentality of these
[52:18.160 --> 52:22.920]  people who cannot say, this is enough. This is crazy. This is too much. You don't need
[52:22.920 --> 52:27.200]  to do this. No, they can't get enough of it. And I see it from the media. I see it from
[52:27.200 --> 52:28.200]  the people on the streets.
[52:28.200 --> 52:32.440]  This is a seduction of America. David, once you get back, we'll get you in studio. You're
[52:32.440 --> 52:36.760]  taking a few days off. They're deserved. Thank you so much. We're going to pause for a moment
[52:36.760 --> 52:40.840]  and then go to Jacarie Jackson here in just a moment. David Knight reporting from Philadelphia,

[54:52.240 --> 54:57.440]  could find, the purest iodine that we know exists out there from deep earth sources.
[54:57.440 --> 55:03.280]  And it's been such a game changer for me personally. My energy, my stamina, my skin,
[55:03.280 --> 55:11.160]  everything. My God, I wish I'd have gotten on high quality iodine earlier. infowarslife.com.
[55:11.160 --> 55:15.760]  And we also, it ends on October 1st, the lowest price ever on high quality, storeable foods

[55:25.680 --> 55:26.680]  food today.
[55:26.680 --> 55:30.800]  We're going to hold Jakari into the next segment. And then we're going to get Joe Bannister
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.880]  on with us. But Jakari, great job with your reports. We've got about two minutes to break,
[55:35.880 --> 55:40.880]  but recap for us what you've witnessed and what your big takeaway is from Pope Francis
[55:40.880 --> 55:44.280]  conquering, Pope Francis doing America.
[55:44.280 --> 55:49.800]  Jakari Jackson, reporter from Philadelphia City Hall, stationed behind me, Alex. Now,
[55:49.800 --> 55:56.080]  when we first got in to Philadelphia, as David said, we had to walk two hours to our hotel,
[55:56.080 --> 56:02.120]  multiple checkpoints, TSA checking people's bags, every alphabet agency, local cops, everybody
[56:02.120 --> 56:06.920]  was out here on display, National Guard is still posted at many places around the city.
[56:06.920 --> 56:12.000]  And this is a perfect example of getting people to love their servitude for those quotes
[56:12.000 --> 56:17.240]  before. And with all the presence I just mentioned, they also had the volunteers. So people could
[56:17.240 --> 56:21.120]  get in on the action. So they didn't feel so oppressed because little Susie who worked
[56:21.120 --> 56:25.080]  down at the bakery was checking their tickets. And I want to tell you how much of a security
[56:25.080 --> 56:29.720]  fear this is, Alex, because of all the troops, all the guardsmen, all the alphabet agencies
[56:29.720 --> 56:33.840]  and the volunteers, I was able to get into Independence Hall yesterday, Independence Mall
[56:33.840 --> 56:38.680]  yesterday without a ticket. I didn't jump any fences. I didn't lie to anybody. I walked
[56:38.680 --> 56:43.000]  straight into that venue without a ticket, even though this is supposed to be the most
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.920]  secure place I've ever seen. Like David said, this guy has more security here in Philadelphia
[56:47.920 --> 56:49.560]  than Obama has in Washington.
[56:49.560 --> 56:53.040]  It's like Emperor Palpatine came to town. And of course you shot footage of you going
[56:53.040 --> 56:57.600]  into Independence Hall that footage is on info wars.com. Yeah, no ticket. I walked straight
[56:57.600 --> 57:03.240]  in there. And that's the complete theater of this whole event. You know, plenty, plenty
[57:03.240 --> 57:07.800]  of people just think, Oh, I'm gonna be safe. It makes me feel better. I know it's ridiculous.
[57:07.800 --> 57:12.360]  You have cement barriers. You have the bike racks in the street, hurting people like cattle
[57:12.360 --> 57:16.280]  to come out here to see this event. Amazing. Jakar, we're going to break in a moment. What
[57:16.280 --> 57:19.600]  else are you going to break down when we come back? I'm breaking down all. I'll tell
[57:19.600 --> 57:24.400]  about watching DC Times Square is easier to move around in Times Square than it was to
[57:24.400 --> 57:26.880]  move around here in Philadelphia. It's completely ridiculous.
[57:26.880 --> 57:31.800]  Land of the free home of the brave. Jakari Jackson reporting from Philadelphia, the second
[57:31.800 --> 57:37.160]  hour. Joe Bannister on the incredible political persecution going on in America and how we

[58:51.480 --> 58:56.920]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[58:56.920 --> 59:02.160]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus. All of our children are
[59:02.160 --> 59:07.560]  hit with modern mind control. Television music, fast food, GMOs, sugars you name it. Young
[59:07.560 --> 59:12.680]  humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist
[59:12.680 --> 59:17.600]  concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[59:17.600 --> 59:21.880]  psychotropic drugs. Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the
[59:21.880 --> 59:25.840]  highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take. We worked with
[59:25.840 --> 59:29.920]  the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the
[59:29.920 --> 59:35.120]  most affordable and powerful calming formula out there. Introducing child ease with herbs

[59:48.320 --> 01:00:04.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. From his central Texas command center deep behind
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:11.320]  enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:19.320]  Here we are in occupied North America, coming from FEMA region 6. What FEMA region is Philadelphia?
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:25.160]  FEMA region 2, I think. Jakari Jackson joins us. It sounds like a third world country or
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:31.080]  East Germany can't even get a cab at the airport at 10 o'clock at night after a walk
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:38.880]  miles through the cold rain to get to their hotel and just checkpoints everywhere, TSA
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.880]  everywhere, just all the ridiculous power grabs. Jakari Jackson, report on what happened.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.480]  Yes, you may have noticed this red band that I have on my wrist. This was our express pass
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:54.120]  just to access our hotel. After we got to the hotel after our two hour walk, we were going
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.080]  out to get a bite to eat. They said, hey, wait, you need to get your band. It was like,
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.400]  what do we need this band for? To get back in the hotel because they wouldn't let us
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.320]  walk down the street unless we had a band even though we paid to get to the hotel. And every
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.760]  time we came in and out, where's your band? Where's your band? We paid to come into this
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.040]  hotel. Why are you guys harassing us like this? They would call one of the ladies a
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:15.240]  junior Nazi. She didn't like that too much. But that's pretty much what it is. So they
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.240]  get people in on the action. So you don't just have to watch people be harassed. You
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.560]  can get in on the act and do it yourself. So these are the things that we've had to
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.680]  endure. And going back over the past few days, you guys may have noticed some of these barricades.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:30.960]  Maybe we can show them these bicycle racks right here, David. Now imagine they've cleared
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.400]  it up a little bit because they know it's the last day. But imagine these racks clear
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.280]  across the street, also concrete barriers, which are a little bit further down the street.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.200]  And we saw a very amusing scene when you get the captain on camera, but there is a golf
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.840]  car in a full of cops. They're trying to drive down the street and they're like, oh,
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.800]  crap, we can't drive down the street because there's a bunch of barricades on it. And then
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.960]  we just stood there and watched them when David was like, I wonder if they could figure
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.840]  this out. It's like watching a kid put together a puzzle. So they were sitting there and they're
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.800]  like, oh, we can drive on the sidewalk. So they hop on the sidewalk and drive down the
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.560]  sidewalk. And David made the excellent point that if a golf car can drive down the sidewalk,
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.760]  can a car do the exact same thing? Sure, it's all total theater, the conditions. It's
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.760]  all theater. It's complete security theater. And as we were talking about earlier, how
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.960]  the Pope has more security here in Philadelphia than Obama has in Washington, DC, you go up
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.080]  to Washington, DC, you can get as close to the to the White House as the front gate.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.640]  That's not the issue. You know, of course, they have Secret Service and all that stuff,
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.720]  but you can walk up there to get anywhere around here. You have to go through multiple checkpoints.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.960]  You have to have a ticket unless you're a car jackson. When such case, you just walk
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.440]  right into the thing. Well, they don't even have this much security for G 20. It's like
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.960]  the Pope is the king of earth. Pretty much that's how people are reacting to him. You
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.280]  know, and everybody says just like David pointed out, he's such a humble guy stepping
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:50.280]  off his private jet. How are you doing, young fella? Hey, yes. So yeah, these are things
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.560]  that we've gone through and all what I was talking about earlier, Alex, when we went
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.700]  to Times Square, anybody who's been to Times Square knows it's a nightmare to navigate
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:01.360]  whether you're on foot or whether you're in a taxi cab. It was easier to get around
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.960]  Times Square, where the Pope was actually speaking at Madison Square Garden than it
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.680]  has been to get around in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He's the only person here. There's no UN
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.000]  here. There's no Obama here, but they shut down the city more for one man than they did
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.480]  for Obama or for the UN up in New York. It's been completely ridiculous. Well, you got
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.720]  Philadelphia, you got Penn State nearby. I mean, this is the pedophile command base.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:32.640]  So I know how to keep the King PDP safe. Yes, I'd really like for them to actually prosecute
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:36.040]  some of these guys. I was reading some of the quotes from the Pope. He said something like
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.120]  we're going to observe the situation or something along those lines like, no, how about we're
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:44.480]  going to prosecute these guys who have done these crimes, put people into these prisons
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:48.760]  because they don't need to be in these dioceses doing these harm, doing such harm to children.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.080]  Of course, it's not all people, but the people they know who are guilty, why aren't these
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:56.880]  people in these prisons, Alex? Well, it's a large contingent. I mean, they took over.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:00.160]  A lot of other institutions have been taken over by these people. It's just crazy. Well,
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.880]  Jacari, you've been on the road six days. Great job. You're looking forward to getting
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:07.920]  back to Austin. Yeah, I'm very much looking forward to sleeping in my own bed. It's going
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.120]  to be a welcome change of pace. Well, I know David's going to take off a week and you're
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.480]  welcome to take off as well. We're kind of a skeleton crew. We'll miss you, Jacari.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.960]  But how much time you plan to take off, Jacari? Oh, one or two days. I'll be back. It's awesome
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.400]  to have you around. I'm glad you're addicted to fighting tyranny. Great job. 30 seconds
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:30.840]  left. Anything else? Yes, I would like to just end with this note. As far as all the
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.880]  things that have happened while the Pope has been visiting here, the thing about me the
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.200]  most is when he said Christ failed on the cross and I did a report early in the day.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.720]  People can go look at why I referenced certain scriptures, but Christ didn't fail on the
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.160]  cross. He knew he was going to die on the cross and he said, I'm giving myself willingly.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.760]  So I was very disturbed to hear something like that. He said that. I didn't know that.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.840]  That was Christ's ultimate triumph. Yeah. And he said he failed on the cross as a ABC
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.760]  News. I'm sure it's a multiple. It sounds like some devil will say, Jacari. Thank you.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:05.920]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now. And if you're wondering
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:11.560]  how on earth we ever got in this situation, well, I'll tell you how when the Democrats
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:17.040]  showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans. And then when the
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:22.400]  Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats. And when
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:28.120]  anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:34.200]  out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy. But the real definition of
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:41.280]  crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. That's
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:49.120]  why it is vitally important that you wake up America and break the matrix info wars.com
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:06:11.200]  prisonplanet.tv and the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind. You are listening
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:27.840]  to an info wars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones. There is a rain of terror, not
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:34.920]  just here in the United States, but across the world against free speech. I remember
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:44.040]  growing up watching the news reading the newspaper 35 years ago, 20 years ago. I remember first
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:51.240]  being on air 20 years ago and seeing mainstream media criticize communist China for restricting
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:56.960]  free speech for arresting political dissidents for setting up political dissidents for doing
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:04.680]  white glove inspections of the businesses of free market pro America political dissidents.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:09.320]  And our government and our media would rightfully criticize China harvesting political dissidents
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:17.120]  organs, Chinese spies in our government, things like that. Not just one example. But in the
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:24.000]  past 15 years or so, our media has stopped criticizing political persecution around the
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:31.160]  world, unless it's in Russia. And there's some of that going on in Russia. And we criticize
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:39.240]  it here as well. But if you look at Lois Lerner auditing harassing tens of thousands of different
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:44.800]  Christian conservative libertarian veteran pro gun groups, you name it, anything right
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:50.480]  of Mao Zedong. If you look at the different Republican governors that have been indicted
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.520]  in the Texas Attorney General indicted and Dinesh D'Souza, the filmmaker for getting
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.640]  five of his friends to donate to a political campaign, he didn't fault the right paperwork
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:12.000]  indicted nine months in prison. Huge fines. And you look at no tax exemption. Authorizations
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.560]  issued in the last five years to conservative groups, only one and over again, 12,000 total
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:24.640]  issued to Democrats and liberals and socialists. They're using regulations. They're using the
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:32.920]  power of the state to shut down all political speech that doesn't agree with them. And the
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.080]  Republicans are intimidated. They're blackmailed. They're bullied into it. The great news this
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:43.840]  week is that we saw John Boehner step down. A Tea Party rebellion in the house, a vacate
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.800]  the chair vote that we helped push on Twitter and Facebook with Congressman Walter Jones
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.960]  who spearheaded it. He joined us Friday. You, the listeners of the show, help put the heat
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:09:00.000]  on Boehner to make him resign on Friday. Boehner who promoted Obamacare, gun control,
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.360]  open borders to protected Obama on fast and furious and so many other crimes in Benghazi.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.040]  He's gone. There's now a leadership fight and no one from his leadership group, not
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:16.280]  McCarthy, not any of them should be in there. And we'll be promoting the next few weeks
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:22.440]  who Congressman Jones and others believe will be the best for leadership. Ted Cruz also
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:26.320]  in the Senate supported the move along with Rand Paul to get rid of Boehner. So we've
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:30.440]  got good people who don't want to destroy this country, who are in Congress and who
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:37.200]  are leading and having an effect. Obama is incredibly unpopular. The Democrats are incredibly
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:44.640]  unpopular. The Rhinos, Republican name only are very unpopular. But what we're seeing
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:53.960]  here is a massive criminal pushback against those of us that are calling to non-arm Syrian
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:59.880]  rebels like Al Qaeda and ISIS. You're seeing a massive pushback in Europe against mainline
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.720]  Germans that don't want open borders or to pay for all these illegal immigrants. You're
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:14.080]  seeing them get 120 days in jail, no judge, no jury, 5,000 euro fines. We've got an article
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:21.400]  up on infowars.com. Anti-ISIS artwork banned from free speech event after outcry from one
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:27.480]  in police. We'll show TV viewers the artwork. It's those little foxes and bunny rabbits
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:33.280]  you buy at Michaels or other art supply stores dressed up having a picnic happy. And here
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:40.240]  comes ISIS over the hill with their machine guns and their Al Qaeda flag. And the police
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:47.640]  quote banned the event or said you've got to pay 36,000 pounds or $55,000 for us to protect
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:54.240]  you if you have this event. That's how they end free speech. And now the UN has come out
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:00.160]  and said ban any speech criticizing feminism in any way that's Breitbart. The UN wants
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:05.200]  to censor the entire internet to quote save feminist feelings. And on major universities
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:10.400]  they're telling people any criticism of cultural Marxism, you will be kicked off, you will
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.520]  be given academic suspension or probation. And I even know people this is happening
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:28.040]  to in Austin, Texas. I mean, they're moving with totalitarianism right now. And now we
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:36.040]  are seeing the Federal Trade Commission and the SEC are in the news this week announcing
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:42.360]  they have jurisdiction over the internet, not just the FCC that just declared it this
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:52.360]  year and that they're going to censor anybody they feel like. So it's on. And I wanted to
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:12:01.360]  bring you Joe Bannister who medium media bypass first interviewing. And then I went and interviewed
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.760]  him in California while I was covering Operation Urban Warrior, a big martial law drill in
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:11.840]  99. And he had just resigned from the Treasury Department, an armed agent of the IRS who
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:17.280]  did raids on people, a lot of more bad criminals. But the point is, he had a great career as
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:23.280]  whole families based in law enforcement. He hears a radio show just recapping, claiming
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:27.600]  that the IRS is a fraud and that the Federal Reserve's private, he doesn't believe it,
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.360]  spends two years investigating it, finds out it's true, goes to the superiors, they say
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:38.280]  just resign. Then they indicted him and took him to trial multiple times for his free speech.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:43.120]  It was in the San Francisco Chronicle with a straight face. The former Treasury agent
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:48.560]  faces years in jail for telling people that the Federal Reserve's private, this is what
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:58.240]  they do. But the jury saw him, heard him, and the system was defeated. Now info wars
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.000]  I've learned from two different FBI sources and another source has an entire white collar
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.880]  task force under Obama's orders for two years, digging into us, looking for anything they
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:17.840]  can get. That didn't work so now they've gone to the Federal Trade Commission and are trying
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:23.320]  to find something to come after us. And the thing is, if the feds come after you, they'll
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.520]  go ahead and just make stuff up. Thank God, juries and people now know that the government's
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:33.200]  so criminal, you can't, I mean, I had a high level Texas judge because I went and googled
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.280]  his name after he stopped me on the street, go, you know, Alex, I used to think you were
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:42.200]  a cook, but we saw it all come out with lowest learner. They really are targeting conservatives,
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:47.040]  libertarians and Christians. They really are setting them up. They really are doing this.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:53.440]  Have you been assaulted? Have you been attacked? And I was like, yeah, I've had EEOC made up
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:59.120]  stuff. I've had IRS stuff. I've had state stuff. And man, these people just show up shaking
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.400]  with hate, but they can't believe they're even here. And I'm just, I just go, well,
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.400]  we're here to persecute us. Go ahead. Your karma must be really good and they can't ever
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.600]  find anything. And I haven't made a big deal about it on air because, you know, they want
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.960]  to intimidate everybody. That's what they're trying to do. But we got the fox, the wolf
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:19.400]  circling the camp here. I mean, of course, I expect this. They think it scares me or
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:23.720]  intimidates me. I suddenly went from being exhausted when I learned about this this week
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:30.120]  from a third source, basically, to just, just, just incredible energy. I'm so blessed to
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.800]  be in this position to be able to stand up against these evil people, to be able to reach
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:41.120]  tens of millions of people a day now, that it's just a blessing from God. But I immediately
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:47.240]  thought about Joe Bannister, who was successful, doing great, a family man, children going
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:52.480]  up to the ranks of CPA and then having to lose his job for his conscience. And then they
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.600]  came after him even more, but then he went through the fire. He went through the fiery
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:01.160]  furnace. He went through the lion's den. And, and I was just thinking, I can't feel sorry
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:06.760]  for myself. I want to fight tyranny. We are fighting tyranny. Those little babies can't
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:10.600]  fight those scalpels. You've seen the baby alive. They pull out of the womb to harvest.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.880]  It's fighting the scalpel with his whole hand. We're standing up for those children, folks.
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.960]  What do we expect from these killers? I'm a grown man who's smart and has energy and
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:24.680]  has friends and has capital. And I went and investigated the FTC heads. I already knew
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.120]  what I'd see before I did it. All Democrats appointed by Obama, one of his former Biden
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:34.920]  chief advisor, Obama advisor. I mean, this is who I've, this is, this is an honor. Biden's
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:39.400]  got his other son over there running the takeover of the gas pipelines and making billions
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.840]  in, in, in Ukraine. And this is just a bunch of seedy people. So they want to go up against
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.320]  me. Good. You got the full faith and credit of the rotten, evil federal government behind
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:54.600]  you. I got the full faith and credit of God behind me who empowered George Washington 1776.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.600]  I love it. We'll be back with Joe Bannister.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:28.200]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves. What do you have

[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:39.640]  We've got Joe Bannister with us on the line. We're going to go to this American hero here
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:44.920]  in a moment. As they said, just recant. Say that the IRS is good, that the Federal Reserve
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.480]  is good and we'll leave you alone. He said, no, I'm not going to. Well, we're going to
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:52.320]  put you in prison. This is how evil the people are that work in this government. But others
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.200]  are just cowards. They just are scared. They want their paycheck. They'll do anything for
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:02.240]  it. We interviewed a lot of firefighters, including senior ones who saw the bombs going
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:07.760]  off, heard the countdown to blow up World Trade Center 7 on 9-11. And they'll say, I
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.640]  waited till I retired so they wouldn't take my pension. And I appreciate their courage.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:15.880]  They've got more courage than most. But they'll say almost all the firefighters know it was
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:22.360]  bombs, but they're scared to say it. It's like I had a Hollywood guy on. I was criticizing
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.960]  George Soros for being a Nazi collaborator and the Hollywood person, I'm not going to
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:31.800]  say his name to put him down. He said, but Alex, the Nazis would have killed him. Well,
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:36.760]  I mean, you can put a gun to my head and say, go round up women and children for us. We're
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:43.200]  going to kill you. Pull the damn trigger then. I mean, I just don't get this go along with
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.400]  evil because everybody's so scared. I was thinking about everybody persecuted by this
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:52.400]  alien force that's taken over the federal government. This isn't the Vatican doing all
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:57.640]  this. This isn't Catholics. It's been taken over. That's even in mainstream news is blackmailed.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:04.560]  This isn't the federal government. It's globalist. It's a corporate takeover. Internet Prodigy
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:09.400]  activist Aaron Swartz was mad that a major university had 50-year-old stuff on it. They
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:14.240]  had to release the public. So he grabbed it off their server and put it out to the public.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:18.320]  And so they were going to put him in prison for life. And then he, quote, committed suicide.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.840]  Folks, they killed him better than a hammer. He had just gotten, was getting married. He
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.280]  said he was going to beat the indictment. He was going to be a cause celeb. He was going
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.980]  to fight it. He got super lawyers and the feds knew they couldn't beat him. So they
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:34.080]  took him and they hung him by the neck until dead. That's what they do.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:40.080]  Well, here's the deal. I have transcended you. I'm not afraid. Whatever happens, if
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:45.120]  I'm destroyed, I win. If I defeat the globalist, I win. I will not stand here as the innocent
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:50.360]  or persecuted and attacked anymore. For the balance of the hour, he joins us. Joe Bannister,
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:54.800]  Freedom Above Fortune is the name of his website. And he's, of course, written books on the
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:23:00.640]  subject of what he faced. Most of our listeners know who he is, but he is a true person who
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:05.840]  faced major political repercussions and fought through it. Many of the IRS treasury agents
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.800]  and agents that spoke out and signed letters in USA Today with full page ads were promptly
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:17.400]  indicted and are in federal prison right now. So this is the reign of evil in the so-called
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.840]  free country we live in. And they think you're cowards. They think we're doing their job
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:25.240]  here covering all this. You'll just crawl under a rock because you're scared. You should
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:30.880]  be scared of not standing up, not standing up, got us here. America was special because
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:35.040]  we did stand up. We weren't perfect, but we were one of the freest countries in history
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:40.560]  because we did stand up. Acting like jellyfish brings the criminals. Criminals don't hit
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:44.960]  hard targets. They hit soft targets. Joe Bannister, thank you for joining us. I want to get your
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:51.280]  take just on general persecution, the IRS scandal, all of them getting away with it,
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.400]  just the incredible crimes and where you see this nation going. Hi, Alex. Well, hey, thanks
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:05.320]  for having me. Always enjoyed coming on the show. Well, the cesspool there in the government
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.080]  is deep, isn't it? I mean, the tentacles of the federal government reaching out to state
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:17.360]  governments and local governments through grants and all kinds of strings. And you know,
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:22.440]  when you want to find out how free you are, just exercise a little bit of your freedom.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:27.640]  Well said. Where should we start recapping what happened to you or just the huge modern
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:32.680]  open persecution? I mean, they admit Obama has prosecuted more journalists, more whistleblowers
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:38.040]  and all presidents combined. I mean, it is a reign of terror on the press. Well, I think
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.560]  you make a, we make a lot of good points, Alex, but one of the ones you make is that,
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:47.120]  you know, it's not a good idea to be a jellyfish to, as you said, when you first found out
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:51.760]  about this extra scrutiny that you might be facing. You do go through a little period
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:57.040]  of, you know, OO is me. Maybe that's kind of natural because I've gone through that
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.200]  too. But it doesn't take long, especially if you're a praying man or woman, to just
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:08.840]  ask God for strength and boom, there it is. And then you're ready for battle again. So,
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.720]  you know, I would encourage you as somebody who's been through this and could go through
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:20.720]  it again. You know, you're in good shape. You've got, you know, 10, it's been 10 years.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:27.840]  It was 10 years in June that I was prosecuted, as you mentioned, for three, well, four felonies,
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.040]  one of which was conspiracy to defraud the United States of America. And, you know,
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:37.880]  and you also mentioned the jury, you know, I still keep in touch with one of the jurors.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:43.440]  And you know, the stuff he puts in his emails to me about there was no evidence. This is
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:48.600]  crazy that they put you through this. They put your family through this. And, you know,
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:51.960]  so that that's happening to you too. I mean, this doesn't just happen to you. It happens
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:58.880]  to your family. But again, the thing that's been that served me the best is his prayer
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:04.560]  and recognizing that God knows what's going on. He knows that there's evil in the world.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:11.720]  And he expects us good people to speak up in defense of others and in defense of good,
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:20.440]  to be good examples. So the I'm always astounded at how deep the corruption is, you know, in
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.880]  the government. And there's people that say, well, then we just need to do away with government
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.320]  completely. I've never bought into that. We need to do away with the people that are
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:34.440]  corrupting our government. And I do believe that the system that was set in place by the
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:41.960]  Constitution, you know, is flawed as many any manmade system can be flawed. But it's
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:45.440]  really taken a tailspin, especially over the last 50 years.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:50.000]  Well, we can't fix the corruption. No new system is going to work either. And this has
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.960]  been a takeover. Absolutely right. When I said going to break, hey, you know, God's
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.240]  more powerful than these people. My statement was not arrogant. Hey, God's on my side.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:03.320]  My statement was these people think they're God. They're not. And and tyrants are never
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:07.640]  invincible. And look how unpopular the federal government is. Look how the truth's coming
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.480]  out about it. Look how Boehner had to step down. These people need to stop being so
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:16.840]  cocky and look at how reprobate and evil this system has become.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:22.400]  Right. And as you often refer to yourself, I think quite correctly, being the tip of
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:27.000]  the spear, you know, when you're the tip of the spear, you know, you tend to you're
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.080]  going to meet somebody else's shield or another spear pointed at you. And so you just have
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:37.960]  to be prepared as I know you are. But as I say, it was it's been 10 years that was in
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:44.640]  10 years in June that I was prosecuted and acquitted, rightfully so. But even then, you
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:53.520]  know, my defense effort at that time in dollars 10 years ago was about 220, 250 thousand dollars.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:59.160]  And it was through the donations of, you know, thousands of Americans, some giving five bucks,
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:05.760]  some giving 500 bucks. And I basically had to give up seven months of my time preparing
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:09.960]  for trial, because, you know, you don't want to overprepare or you rather overprepare for
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:17.080]  a test than underprepare. But, you know, with yourself and the following that you have good
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:21.520]  people out there, you can see how much support you get when you're not getting attacked,
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.920]  at least not publicly. But if they come after you, Alex, you know, we're all going to be
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.960]  ready right behind that. Well, God bless you. I appreciate it, brother. That's why they
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.440]  do come after us. It's going to be really cooked up. I've been told because they're
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:39.200]  not going to want to miss, but it just shows how the government before wouldn't publicly
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.840]  arm Al Qaeda and ISIS in the Middle East. They're just doing it. They just they wouldn't
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:49.720]  be publicly persecuting people with the IRS. I mean, MSNBC says it's good to do that. They
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:54.960]  just are so delusional. They think they can they're like Hitler invading the Soviet Union.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:57.760]  They're just crazy. Stay there, Joe.

[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:08.240]  spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:13.440]  to smooth out and help children focus. All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:18.880]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:24.160]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:28.720]  they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:32.960]  with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:37.160]  children would actually like and take. We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:41.000]  supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:46.160]  calming formula out there. Introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like

[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:17.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Danger zone, baby. Don't want to be anywhere else.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:25.120]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:33.600]  I was looking at some of the headlines on InfoWars.com. They're just so crazy. But the
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:38.880]  good news is it's just, it's not me saying our government's funding Al Qaeda. Now it's
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:45.400]  top generals. It's not InfoWars saying fluoride causes brain cancer and bone cancer. It's
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:52.600]  Harvard. It's just all coming out. It's amazing. I was looking at Drugs Report after I looked
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:59.920]  at InfoWars. DrugsReport.com feds developed an app to predict psychological status of
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:06.840]  Americans. Look at that. And then they put in the data to claim, you know, your mentally
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:11.760]  ill or anti-government. How government is trying to control what you think? The Washington
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.880]  Post. See, they've gone from denying it to, oh, the CIA is involved domestically, involved
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:22.160]  in propaganda to control you and your family. Oh, migrant mayhem. Germany is in a state
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:32.320]  of siege. Gangs of men roaming the streets, raping women. And if you criticize it, you're
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:39.760]  arrested. I mean, it's just leftist insanity. Video shows vicious attack on 83-year-old
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:47.360]  men in parking lot. I mean, it just goes on and on. And then we've got the super blood
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:52.720]  moon tonight. I guess the fifth or sixth record amount of the solar eclipses. I don't get
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:58.400]  into all that, but I am going to go to a friend's place and barbecue tonight. And I'm going
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:04.000]  to do a Facebook mentions, probably 30-minute program. Once the blood moon gets kicking,
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.440]  like 8.15 to 9.45, it goes full blood moon and 9.45. Everybody thinks it's the end of
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.440]  the world and all this stuff. I don't think that, but there are a lot of real global crises
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:17.400]  going on right now. And the elite do believe in this kind of stuff. So who knows what
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:21.600]  they'll pull. We're going to be covering that tonight at the Alexander Emmerich Jones Facebook.
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:26.040]  Okay, Joe Bannister, I didn't talk to you before you came on the show. I know you've
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:31.280]  got Freedom Above Fortune, the book. I want to talk about one of your newer websites.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:40.160]  It's really excellent. We'll put it on screen. That's Agent for Truth. Again, Agent for
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:47.720]  Truth, and you can give us the full URL of folks want to visit that. But Joe, I could
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:54.040]  sit here and ask the questions. But when people go to agentfortruth.com, they can see all
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:58.440]  the research, all the backup data about the Federal Reserve, about the IRS. Instead of
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:02.400]  me asking the questions, what do you want to impart to viewers and listeners right now
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.720]  about the state of the world as we try to focus in on this incredible persecution? I
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:12.640]  see the persecution intensifying because the system knows it's discredited. It has low
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:17.360]  approval ratings. It's in trouble. There are good people throughout government and corporations
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:22.400]  and private life who are telling the truth. They've got to be really scared right now.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:30.200]  They are, Alex. As unpleasant as being attacked is, and as unpleasant as the period when you're
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:38.720]  defending yourself is, it definitely provides you an opportunity to shed the light, to show
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:46.280]  the light on the corruption and what's really going on. Getting through the persecution
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:52.920]  and seeing the other side, it helps them to look back and think, wow, if they hadn't attacked
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:57.840]  me in that way or that way, we wouldn't have been able to put out this piece of information
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:04.880]  or that piece of information. They have to come out of the shadows in order to come after
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:11.320]  us for different people. It really is important for every single listener out there that you
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:17.200]  can make a big difference just by spreading the word to others, just by being an informed
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:22.980]  person as informed as possible. Of course, being a good example because the more even
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:28.760]  keeled that you are, the more calm that you are, the more believable you are and that
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:35.840]  people will at least check out what you have to say rather than just dismissing outright.
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:40.520]  In your gut, where do you see the balance of evil versus good right now? What's your gut
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:42.760]  tell you is coming in the future?
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:53.680]  Well, of course, being a Catholic, I don't know if you're probably aware of that. I share
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:59.320]  a lot of your concerns about what we see leadership, whether it be in the church or at the UN or
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:05.320]  in our own government. In fact, some of my relatives would always say, why do you bother?
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:10.080]  There's so much evil out there, you're never going to prune it back enough. Of course,
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:16.840]  it falls on deaf ears for people like you and me, I'm sure. But I am really concerned
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:25.520]  and I just think all we can do is expose what's going on for everyone to take a look. Obviously,
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:30.200]  evil and corrupt people like to operate in the shadows, so the more light that you can
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:37.680]  shine on what's going on. As far as the income tax issue itself, there are so many avenues
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:45.480]  with which the government is cheating us and depriving us of our rights. I feel bad about
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:52.480]  trying to just hone in on the income tax because everything is interrelated. But I would encourage
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:58.760]  people if you go to agentfortruth.com, there's a section called Learn More and I try to lay
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:06.320]  out a way that people can educate themselves for free just to get an idea of what's going
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.840]  on. And then also how the income tax does intertwine with the monetary system and the
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:17.080]  other corruption. And as you pointed out with Lois Lerner and all of these congressional
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:18.080]  hearings.
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:23.280]  If you could come out, I mean just to throw this in, that they admit they targeted libertarians
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:28.320]  and conservatives and Christians, they admit they don't issue 501c3s and conservatives.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:32.720]  It's total discrimination, it's total evil. And then MSNBC, I don't know if you've seen
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:36.480]  these clips, we've played them, gets up and goes, yeah, you're evil, you're the Tea Party,
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:42.480]  of course we're gonna arrest you. It's just weird to see all these weak little socialist
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:48.040]  cheerleading like it's fun to arrest everybody they don't agree with, they're just such creeps.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:53.880]  Well, that's one of the sad aspects of an income tax, right? Whoever's in the, whatever
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:59.560]  administration is in power, you can go after your enemies and it works either way, right?
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:06.400]  Like in Richard Nixon or Democrat Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, that system is just waiting
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:13.160]  for them to take the reins of power and then throttle their enemies. And notice, maybe
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:20.320]  I missed it, Alex, but it has a single head rolled in the IRS. And I mean, when the lawmakers
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:27.700]  and the bureaucrats see that even this level of despicable conduct doesn't merit losing
[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:32.920]  your retirement or losing your job, all they do is reshuffle the deck and promote people
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:41.400]  and bribe them with more money, a better position and no heads roll. So the next cadre of evil
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:47.680]  and corrupt bureaucrats and officials are gonna take an even greater step. And that's
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:54.280]  why we, the people need to get out and take an even greater step of exposing them and
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:59.520]  waiting at more Americans to do something. AgentForTruth.com, Joe Bannister, a true
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.560]  American hero is our guest. Joe, we're gonna go to break here in a moment. I'll come back
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.920]  and give you the floor to talk about solutions, what you'd replace the income tax with, where
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:13.600]  you see all this going, other things people can do. I know a lot of the feds used to work
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:18.280]  with in Bolivia 15 years ago. Now they call you up and apologize. You can probably, you
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.000]  know, recap some of that. It's important for folks to know and everybody in the government
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.200]  is bad. They're just compartmentalized. But before we go to break the next minute and
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:34.720]  a half, I just wonder if people realize that America isn't just an island in the world,
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.320]  that there's all sorts of other problems around the planet and that this is all part of a
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:44.720]  larger global degeneration that I see happening.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:48.640]  I couldn't agree more. And of course, looking at other countries and other areas of the
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:55.200]  world, we can see our future, right? Because there's other countries and other places where
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:03.040]  the evil and corrupt officials can implement their evil deeds quicker and more rapidly
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:10.120]  because the people may be more prone to giving in, you know, that kind of thing. Americans
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:15.400]  are generally, you know, they're gonna go down fighting. And so we're gonna, we'll probably
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:20.760]  be the last to where they really throttle us. So take a look around, everybody, look
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:25.960]  around at what's happening in these other countries with these migrant invasions and
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:30.400]  the way that the government's even more corrupt. They outlaw simply defending yourself in your
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:36.400]  own home as they do in Europe. Look at what's gonna be coming here very soon to a neighborhood
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:37.400]  near you.
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:41.400]  Well said. We'll talk about solutions with Joe Bannister straight ahead, agentsfortruth.com.
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:47.040]  I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com. The globalists don't want prosperity. They want control.
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:51.000]  They want to run the whole show. They crave it. And we've just got to stand up against
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.760]  them and they will fall. Look, Vayner just had to resign. Hillary's in deep trouble. They're
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.520]  not invincible, folks.

[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.720]  Many of the products at infowarslife.com are true game changers. They are compounds that
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:07.400]  in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription. But when we look at a product
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:12.120]  like Survival Shield Nacin iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:17.800]  view for over 100 years. The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:22.600]  accrued form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:26.760]  deficiency in iodine was causing. I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:30.720]  X2 for yourselves. What do you have to lose? You are the tip of the spear in the fight
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:35.000]  for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.280]  my life and many other people's lives that I know. And the final reason to try X2 is
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:43.520]  that it's so hard to keep in stock. We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:48.040]  that is about to sell out. It may be a month or two until more comes in. I want to challenge
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:53.600]  all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at infowarslife.com

[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:25.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:33.360]  You know, I look at headlines out of London Telegraph. We wrote a story about it at infowars.com
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.040]  where they had a free speech event because Brits are worried UK citizens are worried
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:42.680]  about losing free speech, where they dressed up little dolls as ISIS fighters and just showed
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:48.800]  them coming over a green grass hill to other little bunny rabbits having a tea party, having
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:56.600]  a picnic. And there's no violence, but that's banned by the police. No free speech. You cannot
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:04.840]  make this up. And in Germany, if you criticize any of it, you're arrested. The left is making
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:10.080]  its move. It's not the left, folks. They have just tailored it and packaged it as the left.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.480]  And the Republicans have gone along with it. The other parties have gone along with it
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:18.960]  in Europe. The good news is McConnell's gone. Excuse me, Freudian slip. Boehner's gone.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:27.520]  And now it has begun. Top RNC official calls for a move to remove Mitch McConnell from the
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:32.920]  Senate leadership position. We'll be covering this more on the weekday show, 11 a.m. to
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:39.440]  2 p.m. tomorrow. Going back to Joe Bannister. Joe, the establishment, as you know, likes
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:43.800]  to act like it's invincible. Well, this one is completely illegitimate. America is in
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:50.160]  its death rows right now with open borders. You mentioned the giant migrant invasions,
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:55.400]  the Democratic Party, the Pope. Everybody telling us we've got to pay for this or we're
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:01.680]  bad. Just, just, just bizarre behavior when Saudi Arabia hasn't taken, quote, one migrant,
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:07.000]  but then Europe's supposed to. I think, again, this shows their desperate move for Cloward
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.120]  and Piven, but finally comment on that because you mentioned it before the break. And then
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:15.640]  talk about solutions. What do you think? You're a really smart guy. What should we replace
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:19.800]  the IRS with? Because we didn't have it, as you know, until 1913. The average American
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:24.960]  wasn't taxed by it till the 50s. I mean, how do we get our prosperity back? What are solutions
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:28.360]  from the mind of Joe Bannister at agentfortruth.com?
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:36.920]  Thanks, Alex. Well, you know, as far as the immigration issue or the Pope and what we're
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:42.400]  being told, one thing that, that I, that gripes me is that the countries that say, if we're
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:48.880]  talking about US and the Mexican and South American and Central American migrants that
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:57.080]  come up this way, we get berated for not just laying out the red carpet, but I don't hear
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:02.640]  even internationally, how much beration berating is going on for the countries that they come
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:09.880]  from? Because what kind of cesspool, you know, how bad, how stinky must the cesspool be to
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:17.640]  cause any person, any human being to, to uproot, leave everything, take a dangerous, you know,
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:23.360]  route on trains and with coyotes and, you know, the humankind, so-called humans, the
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:29.600]  dangers that they encounter to come here, what kind of ugly, stinking cesspool are they
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:36.200]  coming from and where is the clamor for a cleanup, you know, of those cesspools rather
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:44.000]  than, than just berating us for, you know, not welcoming these new neighbors? Why make
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.440]  the poor people go through that in the first place? How about cleaning up where they live
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:54.800]  now? You know, I have, I have through in-laws and other family, they've immigrated from
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:51:02.320]  Europe, from Italy. It's a tough thing and I'm, they're glad they came, but why put
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:05.480]  people through that? Maybe they don't want to be put through that. Maybe they'd actually
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:10.960]  like to, you know, be helped to clean up their own country so that they can remain speaking
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:15.480]  their language and, and living their culture out rather than going through the dangers
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:20.840]  of coming here. And, you know, the cool thing about being Catholic is that you, things like
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:25.760]  immigration or the death penalty or, you know, there's certain things that are non-negotiable.
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:32.880]  You can't be a Catholic and be for abortion, you know, but you can be a Catholic and be,
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:37.800]  make prudential judgments about something like immigration or climate change. You can
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:43.840]  disagree with the Pope or your, your bishop about, that you think climate change is, is
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:50.720]  a bunch of bunk or that immigration, there's a lot of dangerous people that come with the,
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:56.080]  the migrants and that that can present a danger to the people, you know, living where, where
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:00.000]  does these migrants want to come to? Sure. I can't go to Mexico and have my babies for
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:08.520]  free. Exactly. So, you know, I think that, I mean, as far as the, the, it's not like,
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:12.000]  oh, I'm a Catholic, so I can't speak up about these things. You really have quite a bit
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.600]  of freedom to speak up and, and, and let, let,
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:20.200]  Well, since you mentioned that, I mean, because I, the last Pope, some people like, say, Pope,
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:24.160]  you know, John Paul II was anti-communist, free market, anti-abortion. I just, that's
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:27.160]  why I was never, you know, these people that loved to bash Catholics. I never joined that.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:30.880]  I saw the media always attacking Catholics. What does it say when the whole leftist media
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:35.120]  suddenly loves this Pope? I mean, it's, it's pretty wild.
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:41.280]  Yeah. And it gives me great concern because yeah, if you're loved by the world, you got,
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:45.240]  you got a water or somebody that you, you know, that's, that's running your, your church
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:49.440]  is loved by the world. You have to, you have to watch out. Now, I think that there's certain
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:54.840]  messages that Pope Francis puts out there, talking about the Beatitudes and all kinds
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:53:00.680]  of things, defending the unborn, you know, that I happen to agree with. But again, it's
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:05.640]  not like Catholics have to be lockstep about these other matters. They call them prudential
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:11.800]  matters. You use prudence, prudential judgment to determine, well, what is really the safest
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:19.440]  and the most just way to deal with these issues? So anyway, that's why that's a key point.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:24.360]  Maybe the media is taking statements he makes and only taking those out of context to misrepresent
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:28.680]  overall was being said because I can get really nasty and I want to be fair about it. So I'll
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:32.760]  have to investigate that shifting gears. What would you do about the IRS? What's a better
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:38.600]  system in, I mean, a sales tax? I'd be for it if they actually got rid of the income
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:41.280]  tax, but I don't want to have a new one and then keep both.
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:46.360]  Right. And I, I'm, I'm afraid of that too. What, you know, how many times have they done
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:53.720]  a bait and switch on us, you know, if only once, you know, so I would be very concerned
[01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:57.760]  that something like a national sales tax would be the bait and switch would be, oh, we're
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:02.360]  going to get rid of that income tax right after we implement the national sales tax.
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:06.000]  And then we have both because they're not going to get rid of, you know, the income tax,
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.400]  which is great way to control and intimidate people.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:15.160]  The other thing that concerns me about the national sales tax as it's been formulated
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:24.120]  in AB 25 or not AB, but, you know, the bill 25, I believe, where it's actually been articulated
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:29.320]  and put into a bill. The thing that concerns me, if you look and see the, the bureaucracy
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:34.600]  that's involved there with the national sales tax, they claim that, oh, the IRS will go
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:39.600]  away and the rank and file American doesn't even have to worry about forms anymore. That's
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:46.200]  not what the bill says. The bill actually puts the onus. If you buy a good and you don't
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:51.680]  pay a tax on it, you're required to file a return yourself to report it.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:57.960]  So a whole new tax police running around going out for swap meets exactly. So I'd read the
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:02.800]  fine print. I mean, I'm all for simplifying the tax system and certainly, you know, getting
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:07.320]  rid of the IRS quote unquote. But the thing I'm concerned with is, you know, Americans
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:11.720]  don't read the fine print and we, yeah, let's not replace it with something even worse.
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:17.680]  Right. I mean, look how the income tax turned out. It started out with a 1% tax rate. Of
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:22.920]  course, the truth, the truth be known. They had to backtrack after the Supreme court case,
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:27.720]  the Prusaper case. And that's what this whole rub is about the income tax. There are tax
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:33.120]  laws that reach out and touch an American that might go work abroad or a non resident
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:37.640]  alien who comes here to work, that kind of thing. But the average American living here
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:43.720]  and working here is not embraced by the federal tax laws as they're written. And that's just
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:44.720]  a fact.
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:48.880]  They can only ride it back to a jurisdiction for somebody via kind of like a tariff, right?
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:49.880]  They're offshore.
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:54.120]  Exactly. Exactly. And that's why I encourage people to read more about it because, you
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:59.000]  know, this isn't a sales pitch to take on the IRS one-on-one, but the fact is it's
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.240]  a deep and stinking fraud. And I think you ought to know about it.
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:07.480]  Well, I mean, it's in the communist manifesto. You know, they put that in there 20 years
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:11.800]  before and then we suddenly make it law here. This is not a good idea. You know, I call
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:16.840]  you a hero, but you turned it on a great job. You were rising through the ranks. You told
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:22.520]  the truth. You had them come after you twice and died to you. You defeated it with a jury
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:26.600]  in a world of cowards because folks talk big till the hammer comes down. I got to tell
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:33.000]  you, Joe, I met you 17 years ago and I'm proud to know you. Any time you come through
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.200]  awesome, we'd love to have you in studio, you and your family, great troopers, you know,
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:41.920]  your sons and everybody fighting tyranny. We're really proud of your work and it's people
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:46.360]  like you that have made this country great. And I think out of all this tyranny, we're
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:50.000]  going to end up even being greater in the end coming through this. So I want to salute
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.280]  you and thank you. 30 second final comment. Oh, God bless you, Alex and everybody there.
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:00.080]  I love coming there in person and saying hi to everybody. You know, I would say, like,
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:04.360]  let's take, let's, let's honor one of Pope Francis's requests. He asked people to pray
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:10.640]  for him. So let's all pray for him and pray for each other that we can discern corruption
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:17.960]  when it's, you know, skulking around and that we have the courage to expose it and that
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:23.160]  if enough of us do that and pray for each other for strength, we can actually do away
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:26.680]  with this. But we have to remember that, you know, God knows what's going on. Jesus knows
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:32.960]  what's going on in the world and in his church. And we need to keep that dialogue going with
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:39.560]  God and establish or reestablish or strengthen the relationship with God and pray for one
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:43.760]  another. And I think that amazing things can happen. Great points. God bless you. We'll
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:49.960]  talk to you again soon. Great job crew. When cells become toxic, they die early and aging
