[00:00.000 --> 00:10.940]  Yippee-aye, yippee-aye-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!
[00:10.940 --> 00:21.600]  Those riders in the sky,
[00:21.600 --> 00:25.960]  And old Calpo quit riding out one dark and windy day,
[00:25.960 --> 00:37.400]  A born rich he rested as he went along his way When all it once a mighty bunch of red-eyed
[00:37.400 --> 00:48.840]  cows he saw, plowing through the ragged skies And up a cloudy draw
[00:48.840 --> 00:56.600]  Welcome, it is Mark's 30th, 2020 on this Monday edition. I am your host, Alex Jones. We're
[00:56.600 --> 01:01.480]  going to be here the next four hours live. And then the war room's coming up with our destroyer.
[01:02.600 --> 01:10.440]  We have Mike Adams next hour. We have John Mark in the third hour. Robert Barnes in studio.
[01:10.440 --> 01:13.640]  I'll be coasting with him in the fourth hour. We're going to make a big announcement
[01:13.640 --> 01:20.520]  during the fourth hour here today about a new show we're going to have live that'll be
[01:20.520 --> 01:24.760]  network commercial free. We're not going to have any of our ads. We'll have ads at the start and
[01:24.760 --> 01:30.600]  middle of the hour for TV and radio stations, their ads, about seven minutes or so. And we're
[01:30.600 --> 01:37.080]  launching that tonight live, teleprompter free, talking point free with Robert Barnes, who's
[01:37.080 --> 01:42.440]  going to be here for the next month hosting that show. I'll get into more of that coming up in
[01:42.440 --> 01:45.880]  the fourth hour when he's here with us. We're going to have a lot of other guests on the show
[01:45.880 --> 01:54.040]  and we're going to take a lot of calls on the show because you will have an hour and 45 minutes of
[01:54.040 --> 02:00.760]  air time in the two hours every night so that everybody gets a chance to call in. We could
[02:00.760 --> 02:05.960]  have a lot of guests play a lot of clips and get Barnes is really interesting taken perspective
[02:05.960 --> 02:10.440]  on all of that. But we're going to have other perspectives like Mike Adams. And I have to
[02:10.440 --> 02:16.360]  tell you looking at the numbers we have, if you have to go with those, Mike Adams has been dead
[02:16.360 --> 02:21.800]  on. And so some people have said that there's a rift there and there's not. We don't get talking
[02:21.800 --> 02:29.080]  points like CNN or Fox News or MSNBC and then kind of go with the party line. Fox has less
[02:29.080 --> 02:34.120]  talking points than say CNN or MSNBC. We really are trying to figure out what's going on here.
[02:34.120 --> 02:38.920]  And that's why we've been breaking most of the big news. That's why we've been weeks or months
[02:38.920 --> 02:44.200]  ahead of everybody else is because we're looking at every angle. We're actually calling the shots
[02:44.200 --> 02:49.640]  here. Myself, the other hosts, the researchers, the producers, the callers, the guests. We're not
[02:49.640 --> 02:53.800]  pre-screening people and saying what's your view? We want guests on that push of you that it's the
[02:53.800 --> 03:00.200]  end of the world or push of you that it's a total hoax. No, we're having a college debate here.
[03:00.200 --> 03:05.480]  That's really where the term college comes from is a large debate of the scholars and the experts
[03:05.480 --> 03:11.960]  and then others would come and hear what the philosophers and the scientists and the researchers
[03:11.960 --> 03:18.120]  and the architects and the occultists, we go back to ancient Greece or ancient Egypt,
[03:18.120 --> 03:25.080]  we're talking about in the town square. And so this is the town square. We talk about science
[03:25.080 --> 03:31.160]  and mathematics and farming and defense and nationalism and globalism and Satanism and
[03:31.160 --> 03:39.720]  Christianity and Islam. We just have a giant open debate here. Now, I have come to an understanding
[03:39.720 --> 03:45.880]  of exactly what's going on with the coronavirus. I know what's happening. I had a huge brainstorm
[03:45.880 --> 03:51.160]  Saturday and Sunday with thousands of data points coming together. And then I tried to
[03:52.360 --> 03:57.880]  condense it live on air as a gestalt instead of taking a year to write a book about it.
[03:57.880 --> 04:07.000]  And yesterday, I just couldn't do it. I'll be honest with you because there's so many subtleties,
[04:07.000 --> 04:13.560]  so many angles, so many points. I tried this morning. I got up at 4 a.m. I spent two hours
[04:13.560 --> 04:17.960]  trying to write notes to get through all the angles. And as soon as I went through one angle,
[04:17.960 --> 04:24.760]  there'd be other angles backing up what I know, the knowledge well. So I can go through each point
[04:24.760 --> 04:32.760]  and prove it. But then that would take 20 hours. So when we come back, I'm going to do my best to
[04:32.760 --> 04:44.040]  just cover the big breaking news. And then at the bottom of the hour, I will give you my absolute
[04:44.040 --> 04:48.600]  best breakdown of what is behind this, what's currently happening and what's coming. You do
[04:48.600 --> 04:55.160]  not want to miss this Monday, original live uncensored, unfiltered People's Prohuman Transmission.
[04:55.160 --> 05:05.880]  I'm Alex Jones. Every week, every day, every hour, every minute, every second right now is critical.
[05:05.880 --> 05:10.280]  History is happening right in front of us. And we can't be spectators. We've got to be men and
[05:10.280 --> 05:15.320]  women in the arena, regardless of race, color, creed, age, sexual privacy, it doesn't matter.
[05:15.320 --> 05:19.960]  The globalist with the chai comms and others are openly trying to plunge our economy and start a
[05:19.960 --> 05:25.000]  new depression. China, who hyped up this virus is now back to work and ramping up their economy,
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.960]  while ours is going into a freefall spiral. And Trump's desperately trying to restart it
[05:29.960 --> 05:34.360]  and create confidence. And the globalist corporate media that was worshiping China
[05:34.360 --> 05:40.120]  just a month or so ago, and their response is saying Trump is terrible because they want America to
[05:40.120 --> 05:45.560]  fail. They want you to fail, but you can expose them. You can speak out. You can share the articles
[05:45.560 --> 05:51.800]  and videos and reports at info wars and band.video that expose them and the globalist will go down.
[05:51.800 --> 06:10.600]  It's already blowing up in their face right now. So press the attack on the info war and defeat the N.W.O.
[06:22.680 --> 06:36.440]  We are my friends on an island in space.
[06:39.960 --> 06:44.440]  On the island without pain. On the island without name.
[06:44.440 --> 06:53.240]  Many miles away from home. You don't think we really originated on this planet, do you?
[06:56.280 --> 07:01.480]  You have all the memories. The establishment doesn't want you to access those memories,
[07:01.480 --> 07:09.080]  those race memories, those human race memories. Because when you remember who you are and how
[07:09.080 --> 07:17.720]  great you are, their attempts to enslave you will end like vapor and phantoms at dawn.
[07:26.680 --> 07:36.200]  Two words. I've solved the coronavirus mystery and it's just as we first thought in the beginning
[07:36.200 --> 07:41.640]  when we were openly speculating. It is a horrible virus.
[07:44.280 --> 07:45.240]  It is manmade.
[07:48.360 --> 08:00.760]  It is a soft kill weapon. Two words. Soft kill. Silent weapons for quiet wars.
[08:00.760 --> 08:06.520]  And I will break it down at the bottom of the hour, exactly what we're facing. I have spent
[08:07.160 --> 08:11.400]  hundreds of hours reading the studies, the literature, looking at the mutations,
[08:12.040 --> 08:18.760]  looking at what the scientists are saying, and they are in a consensus unequivocal that it's
[08:18.760 --> 08:26.280]  manmade and that it reinfects and it attacks one particular tissue more than the lungs.
[08:26.280 --> 08:35.480]  The testicles. Of course it does. We even have the Rockefeller
[08:35.480 --> 08:44.360]  light papers about bringing in a worldwide police state and a lockstep authoritarian clampdown.
[08:44.360 --> 08:51.400]  Those are words they use. Getting the world in lockstep, you know, like Nazi soldiers doing their
[08:51.400 --> 09:04.920]  war, high-legged march, like robots and the horses all, like robots. The tanks all in
[09:04.920 --> 09:12.280]  geometric patterns, like robots. Hitler loved it. Stalin loved it. Mao loved it. Kim Jong-il
[09:12.280 --> 09:17.480]  and his son Kim Jong-un loved it. Watching you behave like androids.
[09:17.480 --> 09:34.600]  Lockstep. You don't think this thing just came out of nowhere. No, the prescripting,
[09:34.600 --> 09:42.440]  the choreography, the pre-programming, it is absolutely the big globalist world government play.
[09:42.440 --> 09:52.120]  And the virus targets the old, who are no longer useful to the globalist, that Bill Gates openly
[09:52.120 --> 09:58.920]  said we need to target. I can play the videos we have. Everybody's seen them. And it targets men's
[09:58.920 --> 10:11.000]  testicles. Just like the HPV shot targets women's ovaries and boys and men's testicles. You can
[10:11.000 --> 10:19.240]  pull the studies up, type in Gardasil infertility. Gardasil ovaries. Gardasil testicles. And that
[10:19.240 --> 10:23.800]  too was an experimental vaccine. They couldn't get approved. Merck couldn't get approved for a decade
[10:23.800 --> 10:27.320]  because it killed so many people and caused autoimmune diseases.
[10:31.720 --> 10:35.720]  And now it's all over the news. When you read the actual study by major hospitals,
[10:35.720 --> 10:43.320]  universities in China, the testicles are bloody, lacerated pulp. It says the majority of men that
[10:43.320 --> 10:53.640]  contract it are sterilized. That's a little key piece of intel. We knew eight weeks ago
[10:54.840 --> 11:01.160]  that it reinfected. That was in the Taiwanese and Hong Kong newspapers.
[11:01.160 --> 11:07.400]  And Mike Adams did a great job translating those into English at naturalnews.com that we
[11:07.400 --> 11:16.920]  reposted at newswars.com. And it says the majority of men are made infertile to the point of
[11:16.920 --> 11:26.840]  sterility. Now already the average Western man has a 90% to 97% sperm reduction
[11:26.840 --> 11:37.240]  by age 20 than what they did in the 1950. And if you're a radio listener, we're a
[11:37.240 --> 11:42.120]  simulcasting television at infowars.com forward slash show and band on video.
[11:44.040 --> 11:49.400]  We're putting up articles. They don't even get me before the show. I just start mentioning
[11:49.400 --> 11:54.200]  things. They type it in and show it up. They pull up mainstream news about Gardasil sterilizing you
[11:54.200 --> 12:06.680]  about COVID-19. Basically eating your testicles and eating the ducts through which the sperm and
[12:06.680 --> 12:17.080]  semen go so that it can't even operate. The headlines though, I tell you to walk the plank
[12:17.080 --> 12:19.960]  in the middle of the North Atlantic. Oh, you might freeze the death. No, you're going to freeze the
[12:19.960 --> 12:25.560]  death. We fall into that water in about 60 seconds. It's below zero. Idiots will go,
[12:26.280 --> 12:32.760]  frozen saltwater doesn't freeze at that time. Excuse me. Point is, is that oh, it may cause
[12:32.760 --> 12:41.800]  infertility. You read the studies, bloody pulps. It's a virus made to eat your testicles.
[12:43.560 --> 12:47.640]  So people will say, well, Jones, you first said it was manmade and showed the studies
[12:47.640 --> 12:53.240]  and you said it looked like it was really bad. And then you said, whoa, don't panic. Well, yeah,
[12:53.240 --> 12:58.760]  panicking and acting like this will make us lose all of our liberties and freedoms.
[12:59.400 --> 13:03.800]  And this virus, they say, can be here forever. It's never going away. It's going to be seasonal,
[13:04.600 --> 13:07.960]  like the flu, except it eats your testicles.
[13:10.760 --> 13:15.720]  Now you know why Bill Gates is hopping around smiling so much. He says, we need to get rid
[13:15.720 --> 13:20.040]  of the old people and save money. Everybody claps. So we need to reduce the human population down to
[13:20.040 --> 13:23.960]  zero at the TED talk. Everybody claps. The man is a psychotic.
[13:28.040 --> 13:33.880]  And I'm so over the target on his ass. He has produced at least five TV shows and movies I know
[13:33.880 --> 13:46.920]  of that he pays for where I'm attacked by name. Others, like the good doctor on ABC,
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.120]  it's Alex Jones character. They admit it's an Alex Jones character. And I went, that's Bill Gates.
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.440]  I went to search the director and the producer works for Bill Gates and Bill Gates funded it.
[13:56.440 --> 14:03.960]  It took me two minutes to find that. I said that again, Bill Gates pays for ABC drama hospital
[14:03.960 --> 14:10.040]  shows where I'm an insane liar and that no vaccine's ever hurt anyone and everything's fine,
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.840]  even though the head scientist at the UN on December 2nd at the
[14:17.880 --> 14:25.320]  WHO headquarters in the Swiss Alps said, and we played the video here, got no coverage
[14:25.320 --> 14:35.000]  other than a couple of million views on Bandai video, thank God, that vaccines are tested and
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.520]  they are killing and hurting people and that their own doctors know it and there's a total
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.000]  rebellion and that the front line is wobbly and the cover up can't continue and that they're scared
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.840]  for their own families and that they would not give people vaccines with adjuvants.
[14:49.800 --> 14:54.120]  Seven different scientists we played clips of here. That was just like 15 minutes of video.
[14:54.120 --> 15:02.440]  There's two days of it. 19 hours of it. Rob do set up here for two days and watched all of it.
[15:04.680 --> 15:11.640]  On the weekend while his children were at home because he understands they have to have somebody
[15:11.640 --> 15:20.600]  that does the research. So this is a big plan about the world in the future and in the future
[15:20.600 --> 15:26.440]  you and your family aren't in it. So remember in a couple years when they go, oh my gosh,
[15:26.440 --> 15:36.600]  COVID-19 literally sterilized most men on earth, just remember. It's man-made on record and Obama
[15:36.600 --> 15:43.240]  sold them the precursor Chimera virus in 2015. It's in science and all the other big publications.
[15:43.240 --> 15:52.040]  We are under soft kill bio weapon attack but I'll explain soft kill later. It reinfects,
[15:52.040 --> 16:13.480]  reinfects, reinfects, reinfects to sap the money and bankrupt the country then you die.

[17:58.680 --> 18:05.800]  There is a paradox. Yes, this virus is deadly and does kill people. And so do many other
[18:05.800 --> 18:13.160]  countless viruses that have already existed, that do exist and will exist. But when Trump says the
[18:13.160 --> 18:20.280]  cure is worse than disease, he's talking about the media hype creating hysteria and trying to
[18:20.280 --> 18:29.000]  create uncertainty. And it is that that I oppose. It is not the American way to cower and live in
[18:29.000 --> 18:37.640]  fear and to follow the edicts and precedents set by communist China and hyper-authoritarian Singapore,
[18:37.640 --> 18:43.640]  where you're now being given six months in jail if you don't stand at least six feet away from
[18:43.640 --> 18:50.440]  someone. This is being used by social engineers and they admit that they are trying to transform our
[18:50.440 --> 18:57.560]  world forever into something unrecognizable from what it's been. We are not slaves and we must not
[18:57.560 --> 19:02.920]  act like it. One of our best-selling products is living defense and it's been sold out for over
[19:02.920 --> 19:06.840]  four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic. We've got a limited
[19:06.840 --> 19:10.920]  supply right now but it's selling out fast and I want those of you that haven't experienced living
[19:10.920 --> 19:16.120]  defense to get it for yourself. Here's just part of one testimonial. I looked in January 2016 I went
[19:16.120 --> 19:20.760]  in a hospital. I went to VA hospital out here in Boystein. I was in there until June and one of the
[19:20.760 --> 19:26.120]  only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and I
[19:26.120 --> 19:30.200]  kept hearing doctor group and all you guys talking about living defense. Let me tell you something,
[19:30.200 --> 19:35.560]  man. I had an internal digestive problem and I stumbled with it for about five or six years and
[19:35.560 --> 19:39.880]  the doctors they tried every time. Nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when I
[19:39.880 --> 19:43.400]  kept hearing you and doctor group and those commercials I said you know what I'm gonna get
[19:43.400 --> 19:47.000]  me some of that freaking living defense. Now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.160]  they don't want you to have a stuff but I ordered it had it shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from
[19:51.160 --> 19:56.600]  the nurses. I started taking it man. That stuff changed my life. It saved my life. Alex Jones
[19:56.600 --> 20:08.440]  and info wars saved my life. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:08.440 --> 20:27.560]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[20:38.440 --> 20:45.560]  They just give me.
[20:48.440 --> 20:56.360]  To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body. Got a long line of heartache.
[20:56.360 --> 21:10.280]  I carry it well. The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell.
[21:10.280 --> 21:14.280]  Bad luck when been blowing at my back.
[21:17.880 --> 21:22.040]  I pray you don't look at me. I pray I don't look back.
[21:22.040 --> 21:31.320]  Info wars is the definition of Americana and is the definition of outlaw radio and television.
[21:32.360 --> 21:37.400]  And it's because we just tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may. We don't
[21:37.400 --> 21:41.880]  follow the globalist disinformation and talking points. Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[21:42.440 --> 21:45.160]  Now next segment I'm going to get into the big picture the soft kill.
[21:45.160 --> 21:53.560]  How this empowers every facet of the globalist agenda. And then I'll cover the latest breaking
[21:53.560 --> 21:59.960]  news information. But first I want to talk about hope. The globalist want to kill hope.
[22:01.240 --> 22:06.760]  And you've seen Nancy Pelosi come out and say every death is Trump's fault because he's fiddling
[22:06.760 --> 22:11.960]  around. Played that clip yesterday. Well now they've dug up the clips of her in late February.
[22:11.960 --> 22:21.480]  A month ago saying do not social distance go out in public congregate in San Francisco.
[22:22.360 --> 22:27.880]  Again this is insane. They're the ones that said don't block flights from China.
[22:28.840 --> 22:32.360]  For two weeks a federal judge even tried to block Trump a Democrat.
[22:34.360 --> 22:38.120]  Well what happened last week. I got banned off of the Google app.
[22:38.120 --> 22:45.560]  That was very popular but around three years for the show. And why did they do that.
[22:46.920 --> 22:57.320]  They said Jones in a video talked about promising treatments. Hydroxychloroquine zinc and ZPAC.
[22:57.320 --> 23:04.200]  I was quoting the president. I was quoting doctors on Fox News. Democrat governors responded
[23:04.200 --> 23:14.600]  in 20 states. Now Michigan California New York ordering doctors to not prescribe it.
[23:15.320 --> 23:20.520]  Even though Fauci's on record saying he would prescribe it to someone diagnosed with COVID-19.
[23:22.200 --> 23:29.960]  And think about the magnitude of this. The president of Brazil.
[23:29.960 --> 23:41.080]  The Donald Trump of South America came out and said zinc ZPACs hydroxychloroquine
[23:41.640 --> 23:48.040]  don't be in fear. He said we don't close automobile plants because tens of thousands
[23:48.040 --> 23:53.240]  of people die a month in automobile accidents in Brazil. We take precautions but we don't
[23:53.240 --> 24:03.000]  run in panic and fear. Twitter banned those tweets. So a president can't say hydroxychloroquine
[24:03.000 --> 24:09.960]  because it's 97 98% effective in those they catch early. In the EU studies. I mean Trump was just
[24:09.960 --> 24:14.760]  covering that. Trump even in press conferences says well we're doing tests now. Hopefully it'll
[24:14.760 --> 24:24.360]  work well. The FDA back down folks. The Democrats back down. Here it is. ABC News. Coronavirus.
[24:24.360 --> 24:30.360]  Live updates. FDA gives anti malaria drugs emergency approval to treat COVID-19 because
[24:30.360 --> 24:38.600]  the doctors rebelled so hard. The bureaucrats and Democrat governors literally just banned
[24:38.600 --> 24:49.240]  Balasaro for saying what Trump and doctors say. They banned me. The video they linked to
[24:49.880 --> 24:55.000]  in the articles on banned on video. And it's where I'm bitching about Democrat governors. It was 10
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.320]  governors at that time last Tuesday. Took them a few days to get me banned. And I was saying help
[24:59.320 --> 25:03.880]  dare them. And I was showing you studies and medical reports that it's 90 plus percent effective.
[25:03.880 --> 25:14.680]  And that the FDA was blocking it. What the hell. Because they want total panic because they're
[25:14.680 --> 25:18.840]  behind it. They're with the globalists are with the chai comms. It's a real virus. But it's an
[25:18.840 --> 25:29.480]  attack on our economy. Unbelievable. So ABC News and Google says oh you can appeal us banning
[25:29.480 --> 25:33.000]  your app. I talked to the developer that did it three years ago. There's no way to appeal it. We
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.600]  don't even know how. There's not even a system. So I have lawyers write a letter to Google but
[25:36.600 --> 25:39.560]  you they're not going to bring it back. They're going to bring back the tweets of the president
[25:39.560 --> 25:45.080]  of Brazil because the left loves to censor everything. And now it's going to be Trump.
[25:45.080 --> 25:50.520]  They're already disappearing Trump's tweets and they're not responding. Coronavirus live
[25:50.520 --> 25:54.440]  updates. FDA gives anti malaria drugs emergency approval to treat COVID-19.
[25:57.720 --> 26:01.800]  And it goes on to say that they already have clinical trials in Europe and other areas. So
[26:01.800 --> 26:11.160]  no need for here. Now let's move on. Michigan Democrat governor threatens license of doctors
[26:11.160 --> 26:16.040]  that promises to prescribe hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus. Then because it has hydroxy
[26:16.040 --> 26:26.040]  thousands of things have a name hydroxy. Some dude drank fishbowl cleaner that says hydroxy.
[26:26.040 --> 26:34.200]  Nothing to do with hydroxychloroquine. And so that's why they say banning these people are
[26:34.200 --> 26:40.680]  incredible. Unreported Fauci would prescribe chloroquine to coronavirus patients World Tribune.
[26:40.680 --> 26:48.600]  That was March 25th. The day I covered it last week. The day I got banned for. How dare I tell
[26:48.600 --> 26:54.040]  you what the head NIH scientist says. I should shut my dirty mouth. And here's what the medical
[26:54.040 --> 26:58.120]  doctors said in New York treated 350 patients really restored three to four hours zero deaths
[26:58.120 --> 27:05.080]  zero hospitalizations zero innovations with 200 milligrams of hydroxy chloroquine twice a day
[27:05.080 --> 27:12.760]  500 milligrams of Z pack 220 milligrams of zinc sulfate daily. Oh that's close to a toxic level
[27:12.760 --> 27:16.040]  according to what I read but it's not good for your kidneys long term. I'll say that
[27:17.240 --> 27:20.040]  you look that up yourself but it's still yeah it'll knock it out boy.
[27:20.040 --> 27:27.480]  Almost every case so they don't want you knowing all this and how outrageous is that.
[27:29.160 --> 27:36.200]  How outrageous is that. That she says every death Pelosi says every death is Trump's fault
[27:36.200 --> 27:39.160]  when they're the ones that left the borders open they're the ones that said stay out in public.
[27:40.040 --> 27:45.240]  Whether you agree with the social distancing or not you can't say we're against it four weeks ago
[27:45.240 --> 27:50.760]  and then now say it's all Trump's fault. Here's a clip of Pelosi encouraging large
[27:50.760 --> 27:57.240]  groups to congregate in Chinatown on what was this February 27th here it is.
[27:58.360 --> 28:06.120]  Prevay here. It's exciting to be here especially at this time to be able to be unified with our
[28:06.120 --> 28:13.560]  community. We want to be vigilant about what that might be on what is out there in other places.
[28:13.560 --> 28:19.880]  We want to be careful that how we deal with it but we do want to say to people come to Chinatown
[28:19.880 --> 28:29.640]  here we are. We're again careful safe and come join us. That woman is completely insane but her
[28:29.640 --> 28:36.120]  constituents are even dumber. Wow should I even play the clip when we come back where she says
[28:36.120 --> 28:41.160]  every death is Trump's fault. No you've already seen it you watched the show yesterday it's on
[28:41.160 --> 28:44.520]  them fours. When we come back I'm going to tell you what soft kill is you ready for this.
[28:45.320 --> 28:50.360]  Yeah see we're going to make sure the folks behind this pay for it. The globalists aren't
[28:50.360 --> 28:55.240]  going to get away with this with a little chai come drag it you understand we'll be right back.

[33:42.840 --> 33:49.240]  foot view of what we know is going on who is behind it what the agenda is and what's going
[33:49.240 --> 33:55.320]  to unfold in the future in the next few months the next year the next few years and you will
[33:55.320 --> 34:05.240]  be able in a few years to tune in to this archive of this live broadcast on march 30th 2020 and you
[34:05.240 --> 34:13.480]  will see that much of what we break down comes true you people engage and expose what the global
[34:13.480 --> 34:18.840]  throughout too we may be able to stop it and alter the future which we've already done together
[34:18.840 --> 34:24.680]  but people have to decide to not be spectators and to be men and women in the arena and to
[34:24.680 --> 34:31.160]  physically speak out to be civilly disobedient and to say no and to vote with your dollars and
[34:31.160 --> 34:36.680]  with your actions and with your word of mouth that is paramount but first let me say this
[34:39.160 --> 34:47.480]  I don't lay all this out to scare you I lay all this out so you can be prepared and the truth is
[34:47.480 --> 34:55.400]  big pharma in the last 120 years funded by the Rockefellers on record took over western medicine
[34:57.640 --> 35:02.280]  and made it more of a predatory eugenics based system it still has a lot of good people involved
[35:02.280 --> 35:09.000]  in it and it cut out all of the other things that were known about eastern medicine about nutrition
[35:09.000 --> 35:15.880]  and everything else and it's in competition with a healthy natural lifestyle you will die without
[35:15.880 --> 35:22.360]  vitamin c you will die without water you will die without food you will die without zinc you will die
[35:23.320 --> 35:32.840]  without selenium you will die without vitamin b12 you will die you will get sick and you will die
[35:32.840 --> 35:40.040]  you will get cancer those are the ways you get malnourished and a normal cold bug or a normal
[35:40.040 --> 35:47.160]  flu virus will kill you a normal bacterial infection will kill you that's fact water water
[35:47.160 --> 35:52.120]  everywhere not a drop to drink all this food all these nutrients and americans have never been
[35:52.120 --> 35:59.320]  more malnourished oh they're overweight they're obese with raw calories but not the trace elements
[35:59.320 --> 36:04.920]  not the minerals not the vitamins not the cofactors and that's a fact and americans are the most
[36:04.920 --> 36:12.760]  unhealthy people in the world because of the medical system and what the globalists have
[36:12.760 --> 36:17.160]  carried out fluoride in the water to give you cancer to lower your fertility to dumb you down
[36:17.160 --> 36:23.240]  all the other toxic chemicals they had with it that's on record this is an agenda the tainted
[36:23.240 --> 36:29.960]  vaccines the secret experimentation to ski it goes on and on we've had many nuclear reactors
[36:29.960 --> 36:37.080]  explode as big as turnable one out in los angeles in the 50s was classified until the 80s as big as
[36:37.080 --> 36:46.680]  turnable so all of this craziness has been going on and the system doesn't want you to know that
[36:46.680 --> 36:53.320]  they don't want you to understand that the drugs and things they come out with like hydroxychloroquine
[36:53.320 --> 37:02.200]  is just a drug version souped up of quinine that's why they called it tonic because it was
[37:02.200 --> 37:08.120]  a tonic means a drink to make you better i'm not advertising that as a cure or treatment i'm saying
[37:08.120 --> 37:14.280]  the history of this you can read scientific american articles about tonic and where it came
[37:14.280 --> 37:20.200]  from and now it's hydroxychloroquine is the drug version i don't sell tonic that's one reason they
[37:20.200 --> 37:25.800]  banned me on google app was i covered that last week said isn't that interesting history now the FDA
[37:25.800 --> 37:31.240]  has approved today hydroxychloroquine everybody else already had it works great they didn't
[37:31.240 --> 37:37.400]  want you to have hope but trump and you and i forced it so they don't want you to know about
[37:37.400 --> 37:42.680]  zinc and that the doctors are saying take 200 milligrams of it a day they don't want you to know
[37:42.680 --> 37:48.440]  about z-pack that the bacteria are carrying the virus into the lungs and into the testicles
[37:48.440 --> 37:54.920]  they want you desperate eating white bread drinking mountain dew and having your teeth fall out
[37:54.920 --> 37:59.880]  because we have scurvy they don't diagnose people with scurvy but you see young people now with their
[37:59.880 --> 38:05.560]  teeth falling out and open sores on their arms because they all they eat is crap you're strong to

[41:43.320 --> 41:49.480]  with a spirulina algae out of the ocean and plankton and stuff that is incredible i mean
[41:49.480 --> 41:55.480]  again infowarstore.com but wherever you get your vitamins your minerals make sure they're from
[41:55.480 --> 42:01.080]  organic natural sources aren't synthetic and make sure you take them and again i did research
[42:01.080 --> 42:05.160]  from my own family about zinc and the incredible things it does and it's not good for your kidneys
[42:05.160 --> 42:11.160]  up at 250 milligrams a day long term look at yourself talk to your physician the doctors
[42:11.160 --> 42:15.960]  though are saying 250 milligrams i'm not saying that that's on fox news that's in the new york
[42:15.960 --> 42:20.440]  newspapers and they're the same ones saying hydroxychloroquine and z-pac in european studies
[42:20.440 --> 42:24.840]  are incredible well now the fd had to back down and just said you can prescribe it doctors can
[42:24.840 --> 42:28.680]  because doctors are like what everybody's always been given this off label for other viruses it
[42:28.680 --> 42:34.680]  works great what the hell are you doing but the democrats are such devilish villains they tried
[42:34.680 --> 42:41.240]  this and i got banned for trying to create hope here because there is hope i'm not going to take
[42:41.240 --> 42:47.400]  that much zinc but i am taking as an adult 100 milligrams a day now i'm taking 100 milligrams
[42:47.400 --> 42:52.280]  because i want to explain something if you beat this virus you're fine but if you don't it becomes
[42:52.280 --> 42:57.320]  part of your body keeps coming back if you don't have the basic building blocks you will succumb

[48:04.520 --> 48:11.720]  we're seeing a drop in confirmed cases and we're seeing a drop in recovered because there's less

[48:20.040 --> 48:25.160]  that linked up on info wars.com stock market down jones industrial average is up 500 points
[48:26.120 --> 48:31.480]  right now and my point three four weeks ago when the panic was setting in the stock market was
[48:31.480 --> 48:35.160]  dropping thousands of points the day was the democrats were celebrating it they were saying
[48:35.160 --> 48:43.960]  it's all over they had done internal put options scandalously connected to george soros on the
[48:43.960 --> 48:48.920]  market and it turns out it's now all the news that the very guy ackman and others i brought up
[48:48.920 --> 48:56.280]  up should get in a lot of trouble he says it's asinine that he went on tv and said everything's
[48:56.280 --> 49:02.840]  going to plunge it's going to zero it's all over total depression millions dead i'm so scared
[49:03.960 --> 49:09.400]  but didn't tell you he was shorting those very stocks he made two plus billion off of
[49:11.720 --> 49:16.520]  who'd you hear about bill ackman first from that he was in saturday trading me
[49:16.520 --> 49:22.440]  he by the way everybody else is scared of him he's a gangster he's part of the harvard mafia
[49:22.440 --> 49:31.000]  he's a crook he's crap they call him an activist investor he he he wants to stop the evil racist
[49:31.000 --> 49:40.440]  america he's another george soros turd he made 2.6 billion by betting against markets
[49:40.440 --> 49:46.760]  after fear mongering the quote hell is coming and the whole media pushed that because that's what
[49:46.760 --> 49:53.000]  they want they don't want you to know about zinc they don't want you know about z-pack they don't
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.040]  want you know about hydroxychloroquine well guess what stick it up your globalist you know what
[49:58.040 --> 50:04.200]  because now it's all over the news and now they're having to approve all of it because the think i
[50:04.200 --> 50:08.600]  just get up here on air it was in major studies and all over the european news that if they caught
[50:08.600 --> 50:13.160]  somebody who was infected early with that regimen and they had new york doctors did it and helped
[50:13.160 --> 50:16.920]  everybody and their doctors they're allowed to say what happened with their damn patients
[50:18.360 --> 50:23.880]  and they banned me off of google it's not about me it's about they didn't want you to know
[50:28.440 --> 50:34.360]  and all those governors those villains threatening to arrest doctors if they prescribed zinc or
[50:34.360 --> 50:40.680]  hydroxychloroquine or z-pack oh you can't give somebody z-pack that's it's not approved for
[50:40.680 --> 50:45.560]  this it's a new virus even though they know bacteria carry the damn viruses and in general
[50:45.560 --> 50:52.120]  you give an antibiotic to stop a viral infection that's like saying milk comes out of cows udders
[50:52.120 --> 50:58.200]  you're like you're not allowed to say that jones did it again he was up there you know giving
[50:58.200 --> 51:05.960]  people the false hope we don't allow the the the tweets of the brazilian leader have been banned
[51:07.320 --> 51:13.960]  that was the headline because he was saying hope hydroxychloroquine that's in the news today
[51:14.680 --> 51:20.040]  do you think balasaro will have his tweets put back up no even though the fda
[51:20.040 --> 51:34.600]  approved covid 19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine with almost no side effects it's got some sometimes
[51:34.600 --> 51:41.160]  anything does i mean doctors are saying don't take Advil on it can i say doctors say don't take Advil
[51:41.160 --> 51:45.400]  on it can i tell people what the doctor said no the left is so out of control and so cultic
[51:45.400 --> 51:50.520]  they say the president two weeks ago shouldn't say hydroxychloroquine remember that he's not a
[51:50.520 --> 51:54.600]  doctor shut up he's just saying and then thought she goes well i would prescribe it well you're a
[51:54.600 --> 52:07.640]  doctor and head up the NIH but you shut your dirty mouth too these people are unbelievable and the
[52:07.640 --> 52:13.720]  nancy polosi says has a federal judge blocked trump but trump overwrote it blocking chinese flying
[52:13.720 --> 52:17.960]  in during the outbreak and then she turns around and says it's all his fault when she said go out
[52:17.960 --> 52:23.320]  in public and and and don't don't listen to trump and then and then a month later she's saying it's
[52:23.320 --> 52:30.120]  all trumps fault this is so insulting but that's their constituents because they don't have memories
[52:33.480 --> 52:40.600]  the balasio said go on with your lives go see movies go to spew now he says trump
[52:40.600 --> 52:46.840]  didn't respond right these people are sick and evil all right read called in yesterday to the
[52:46.840 --> 52:51.000]  sunday show and i was at the end of the broadcast can only give him like a minute and a half he goes
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.640]  about hollywoods is handled he was calling in for maryland where he's a truck driver and he was saying
[52:55.640 --> 52:59.560]  hey i have a plea to the president if you want to talk about bailing somebody out it's the truck
[52:59.560 --> 53:04.280]  drivers that keep this country moving even more than the railroad and they do it at a subsistence
[53:04.280 --> 53:09.080]  level but they're great folks and they're exposing themselves out there just like the police and fire
[53:09.080 --> 53:13.480]  department medical workers are and he was talking about the type of aid that you need right now and
[53:13.480 --> 53:18.760]  the bailout you need uh read and how you're sitting there at the dock extra hours trying to get
[53:18.760 --> 53:22.360]  stuff and things are breaking down they're shutting down so you've got five minutes right now to
[53:22.360 --> 53:31.160]  address the president with truck drivers emergency plea to president trump how's it going alex good
[53:31.160 --> 53:35.720]  sir go ahead with your emergency plea to the president good chance he'll hear it all right sir
[53:35.720 --> 53:44.920]  mr president donald j trump they call me hollywood 6.2 trillion and as always they left out the
[53:44.920 --> 53:53.720]  truckers and you should know better we don't need a pad on the back at least not yet what we need
[53:53.720 --> 54:01.320]  is a way for commercial drivers to renew their state driver's licenses the d at load board is
[54:01.320 --> 54:07.160]  reporting a 20 shortfall in drivers in the past few weeks and we need more help out here
[54:08.200 --> 54:15.240]  if this trend continues we're all in trouble that can only be accomplished if more drivers can
[54:15.240 --> 54:21.640]  be tested and allowed to join the ranks you know how important this is we are the backbone of this
[54:21.640 --> 54:29.240]  nation nothing moves without us if this critical infrastructure fails we're all dipped no matter
[54:29.240 --> 54:39.400]  how much money you throw at it open the dmvs allow road testing for new drivers who are in
[54:39.400 --> 54:45.240]  driving school or the rest of us are done within a couple of weeks the hours of service suspension
[54:45.240 --> 54:52.200]  has some of us work in 90 hours per week and we just can't keep doing this it's not humanly possible
[54:52.200 --> 54:59.000]  the commercial drivers also need access to some of this money to add new equipment to our fleets
[54:59.720 --> 55:05.080]  not the big carriers mind you they have access to lines of credit through the banks but the small
[55:05.080 --> 55:12.200]  mom and pop operations who run one or two trucks and have their own motor carrier authority these
[55:12.200 --> 55:16.920]  are the people you want to support because they are most likely those who operate small farms and
[55:16.920 --> 55:22.920]  ranches and make up the majority of this infrastructure all we need is small startup
[55:22.920 --> 55:29.000]  loans and lines of credit through the sba just enough to make down payments on new equipment
[55:29.000 --> 55:38.600]  would do it but as it is now we don't qualify for sba assistance because we don't meet minimum
[55:38.600 --> 55:47.800]  requirements of one million in annual receipts for 250 employees and we would be buying american
[55:47.800 --> 55:59.960]  made equipment for sure sir you can contact the sba and have them do this immediately if someone
[55:59.960 --> 56:08.920]  who applies for assistance with a motor carrier authority they should be able to get it and
[56:08.920 --> 56:15.640]  please sir the price of diesel is way too high can you please get it down for pete's sake it costs
[56:15.640 --> 56:22.360]  less to make than gasoline yet costs 50 more at the pump it's nothing but a bush obama air
[56:22.360 --> 56:27.640]  attacks on the truckers that was meant to hurt our bottom line and we can't keep getting screwed
[56:27.640 --> 56:35.160]  from both directions like this we're barely making a living out here as it is we don't need a hand out
[56:35.160 --> 56:42.120]  but a hand up would be appreciated at this point you spoke about a level playing field
[56:42.120 --> 56:50.200]  for american industry well we need that too and we need that right now more than ever don't let us
[56:50.200 --> 56:56.680]  down mr president we won't let the nation down i promise you that let us step up to meet this challenge
[56:57.560 --> 57:02.280]  we love our country more than anyone out there and we prove it every day
[57:04.360 --> 57:10.920]  if we can't run due to exhaustion or we end up walking out due to horrid conditions this nation
[57:10.920 --> 57:17.160]  is screwed uh hold on right there we're gonna come back to five more minutes with you my friend
[57:17.160 --> 57:23.240]  and for those that don't know i studied it at the time what was it like 12 years ago 10 years ago
[57:23.240 --> 57:27.800]  obama with soros funding with some of the corrupt railroads the railroad workers are great but the
[57:27.800 --> 57:33.800]  railroads have always been corrupt as we know they set up a big monopoly to try to cut truckers out
[57:33.800 --> 57:39.160]  and make diesel costs more even though it's way cheaper to make and with gas prices dropping diesel
[57:39.160 --> 57:43.960]  should be dropped as a strategic issue in the economy this is a critical infrastructure and
[57:43.960 --> 57:51.480]  you're damn right we'll be right back with a second hour there is a paradox yes this virus is
[57:51.480 --> 57:58.120]  deadly and does kill people and so do many other countless viruses that have already existed that
[57:58.120 --> 58:05.720]  do exist and will exist but when trump says the cure is worse than disease he's talking about the
[58:05.720 --> 58:15.000]  media hype creating hysteria and trying to create uncertainty and it is that that i oppose it is not
[58:15.000 --> 58:23.160]  the american way to cower and live in fear and to follow the edicts of precedents set by communist
[58:23.160 --> 58:30.040]  china and hyper authoritarian singapore where you're now being given six months in jail if you don't
[58:30.040 --> 58:37.560]  stand at least six feet away from someone this is being used by social engineers and they admit
[58:37.560 --> 58:43.480]  that they are trying to transform our world forever into something unrecognizable from what

[1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:35.320]  all right the essential infrastructure the truck drivers are out there all over the country
[1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:40.280]  you heard them they pay way more for their fuel that's a lot cheaper to produce the hell you can
[1:00:40.280 --> 1:00:46.040]  make it out of coal even and they're being gouged all obama era because that's a big independent
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:50.680]  thing in america that the big cartels don't control wanting to push business to the railroad
[1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:55.320]  that's why they wanted to kill all those big pipelines out of canada not just the keystone
[1:00:55.320 --> 1:01:03.400]  is because wait for it warren buffet and the same old suspect george soros literally made a deal
[1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:11.240]  with canada to trans ship it west to the far east and offloaded to china look that up so that's
[1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:16.120]  how you make your billions is you cut out your competition you can't have that pipeline we're
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:21.240]  going to ship that oil out of canada to the chinese so america couldn't get it refined it down in
[1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:26.600]  houston that's strategic warfare trumps brushing all that aside they're so pissed all right you got

[1:01:54.680 --> 1:02:01.320]  taught okay don't uh don't hammer people too hard all right because uh because that we're
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:05.560]  going to come out of this now i need to say something to all my brothers and sisters behind
[1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:14.760]  the wheel if you can hear my voice go to hashtag they call me hollywood and read what i just said
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:20.280]  that's where it's at it's at hashtag they call me hollywood and read what i just said and if you
[1:02:20.280 --> 1:02:28.040]  agree with everything there i want y'all to do one thing every single day at exactly noon
[1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:35.640]  until president trump hears this every day at exactly noon y'all set your watches i know you
[1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:40.200]  all punctual i don't care where you are you're peeing your lines or you're going down the highway
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:47.400]  don't matter i want you to reach up there to the top dead center of your cab i want you to
[1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:52.040]  grab a great big handful of that chain and i want you to let the big dogs do the talking
[1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:58.120]  that would become a big national story but also email the white house do it now the president
[1:02:58.120 --> 1:03:04.040]  yep that's do it now boys come on can i get an amen do it right now if y'all can hear me just
[1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:08.680]  bring up a grow well there grab absolutely if i got a horn here i'd blow it so there we go
[1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:14.440]  that's a good idea and it's an example to everybody to speak out and take action that's
[1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:17.480]  what we need to do and it's a great idea because i've studied what you're talking about with the
[1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:22.760]  infrastructure and trucking and how they're really trying to squeeze you guys out yeah there's something
[1:03:22.760 --> 1:03:28.680]  there for steve pechenick my kid brother listens to you he got me uh listening and uh and paying
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:35.320]  attention to you about 10 15 years ago and uh he wrote a he wrote a paper when he was in college
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:43.560]  and uh it has to do with uh ptsd uh and and i think he's i think he's on to something here
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:48.920]  and alex if you could read it and maybe share it with dr steve pechenick uh maybe y'all could
[1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:53.720]  that could be a topic for y'all to discuss it's very important that sir send it in send it to
[1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:58.280]  show tips at info wars dot com or you can get the producers harry's got it harry's got it and she
[1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:03.400]  can give it right over to you and and you can uh you can talk about that at another time but i
[1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:08.680]  think that's important and it would explain why people are just kind of losing it all right the
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:14.040]  the they're acting funny you know what i'm saying well what's happening is the world is being put
[1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:20.840]  into an artificial unhealthy state by design that's what globalism is and it's a post human system
[1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:25.880]  god bless you i appreciate your call read okay so that's a good message and and we're live right now
[1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:30.840]  we'll take that we'll post it at bandot video and it'll be in the alex jones section it'll be
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:38.520]  truckers emergency message to president trump to save the u.s economy or something like
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:42.040]  that and then everybody can the truckers just all share that put on your facebook and twitter
[1:04:42.680 --> 1:04:48.120]  and if you just get that out the trump acts on things like these and it's definitely something
[1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:51.320]  needs to be done it's critical one of the most critical things out there all right i'm gonna
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:55.400]  break down the big picture and we're back in 60 seconds then my god is just coming up
[1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:07.080]  listen there's a show from pbs called it's okay to be smart so everyone who's been smart and has
[1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:14.440]  been put down for it and persecuted it's okay to finally be smart that's right there's not two
[1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:19.720]  sexes and and families are bad and the right thing to do is to sterilize your son so he knows we
[1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:23.640]  got an evil warm hunger i mean a lot of feminists are saying we should have the government pass laws
[1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:28.840]  that mail embryos that count but what's better and more reformed and more humanitarian is just to
[1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:33.800]  convince them when they're five years old to have their testicles chopped off and again global warming
[1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:38.120]  is real we got to pay lord ross out all of our money and the pandemics all really got to be locked
[1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:43.240]  up in our houses we've got to use the language the universities say we're not a culture anything
[1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:49.240]  oh no no we're not we're good people we're good people that went to these corporate systems that
[1:05:49.240 --> 1:06:05.160]  they didn't brainwash us no no they enlightened us how to censor and how to rule without a control
[1:06:05.160 --> 1:06:23.960]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we're now into our number two on your host Alex Jones
[1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:33.000]  the dreaded censored lot about attacked websites or info wars calm and news wars calm big tech
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:37.960]  things that controls the entire world but not yet the power of the people spreading the word
[1:06:37.960 --> 1:06:49.240]  can override them can trump them now let's go ahead and get into the big issue here
[1:06:51.320 --> 1:06:57.720]  for nine weeks we've been covering in depth this entire situation what was happening in
[1:06:57.720 --> 1:07:05.560]  Wuhan and the nightmare zombie apocalypse images that we saw coming out of it then major
[1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:11.720]  institutions in europe and in india came out we've covered all this at nauseam scanned the virus and
[1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:18.600]  said it was clearly man-made ridiculously such at least four different viruses all grafted together
[1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:24.920]  even with the slice points where they had assembled them together including the hiv
[1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:34.920]  the delivery system not hiv the viral RNA but the delivery system into the protein receptor sites
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:45.160]  and now that they have major chinese universities and hospitals coming out and reporting on the
[1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:52.040]  fact that it doesn't just hit the lungs and the heart it's hitting the testicles
[1:07:52.040 --> 1:07:57.560]  and that the majority of men that end up
[1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:02.760]  getting looked at by doctors who are sick enough to be in the hospital
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:08.760]  will end up being infertile or sterile and that's in the reports i've read last night on air on the
[1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:15.400]  sunday show and that's in news week that's in the times of london i mean that's that's in the news
[1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:20.680]  and the headlines are may cause sterility and you read the actual reports that's really bad
[1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:26.840]  bloody lesions throughout the structure of the testicles that creates the sperm
[1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:31.560]  and then through the ducts that deliver the sperm it's it's it's bad
[1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:40.200]  now early on scientists said it's reinfecting and it's mutating and there's all these different
[1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:46.600]  strains well what type of virus reinfects well something that's four different viruses sandwiched
[1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:52.920]  together so yes most people just get a bad cold from it and and and and then some get like pneumonia
[1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:58.680]  then some die but then it comes back and people have heart attacks and fall over dead and i'm
[1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:04.600]  like man that does sound like something out of a science fiction movie and then that's starting
[1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:12.040]  to happen so it looks like it's way lower death rate than the un and the china who were lockstep
[1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:17.640]  at first said they wanted to cover it up there at first then export it so that we weren't scared
[1:09:17.640 --> 1:09:21.480]  get it over here and use it as a weapon against our free society having the globalist deep state
[1:09:21.480 --> 1:09:25.640]  media then gang up on trump and bring down our economy that was the play we called it eight weeks
[1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:32.520]  ago nine weeks ago dead on you all heard it the articles videos they're all there so so we now have
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:38.040]  the globalist operate the precursor virus it was a chimera as well didn't have the h heavy
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:47.000]  delivery system welded on to it it was delivered in 2015 by a level four bioweapons lab in north
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:53.720]  carolina and it was a big national scandal to the chikops and i said i believe it was done on
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:10:00.040]  purpose to shut down the taiwan protest to give jiji ping a way to reset and clamp down and then
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:04.280]  they can use it for a global surveillance system they can use it to restrict cash they can use it
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:10.360]  for the whole force inoculation agenda it fits into their whole agenda and it turns out there's
[1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:18.200]  a Rockefeller foundation report called lockstep from 10 years ago 2010 saying we'll use it for
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:24.200]  authoritarianism we'll use it for a worldwide takeover we'll use drones to surveil people and
[1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:31.080]  notice it's the same from california to new york to london england to wuhan china to
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:38.120]  it's drones it's drones shouting orders it's a global standardized corporate system to condition
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:46.200]  you to accept the takeover so here's the badness the virus is man-made i mean they had major
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:54.200]  testing firms in italy in germany in the united states in india come out and say the same thing
[1:10:54.200 --> 1:11:00.440]  it's got the p shuttle gene it's got the protein slices it's got the incisions folks it's got
[1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:07.960]  where they jammed it in there because when they put that RNA in there it leaves a trace and i use
[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:12.680]  the analogy of you that open heart surgery you see the big the stitches you look at frankenstein how
[1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:16.840]  do you know he's got different people's arms and legs and you know because it's the stitches folks
[1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:22.920]  i mean it's ridiculous how obvious it is 100 and that's why you see the panicking by governments
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:30.760]  and that's why when the chai comms came out and on their official national tv at least 20 times i've
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:36.120]  seen and in their papers and said the u.s army was in wuhan they released it it's all their fault
[1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:41.960]  that's because they know they released it with deep state globalists they're working with that
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:47.320]  helps set up china remember china didn't run in this it's the corrupt evil human testing ground
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:53.800]  three million people in slave camps they're muslims alone it's the hellhole human animal cloning 30
[1:11:53.800 --> 1:12:02.120]  years ago 20 years ago cows that produced human milk sold on store shelves uh spiders that are
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:09.080]  park goat the great body armor i mean it's just it's it's hell on earth it's all publicly going on
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:14.920]  human organ harvesting you name it the globalists set it up 90 plus percent of didn't have running
[1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:20.600]  water most chinese were living on you know out out in the farmers like we were the globalist
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:25.800]  took it over the communist ordered them all into collectivizing set up mass brainwashing
[1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:32.280]  forced sterilization 50 million girls killed 400 million girls aborted i mean they're evil
[1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:38.200]  now it mainly hits men we learned in the chinese population over here it's the old it's mutated
[1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:42.440]  strangely because with a bio weapon you've already tested it in rats and other things you
[1:12:42.440 --> 1:12:47.240]  know how it's going to mutate or you can release other versions now they're saying there's hundreds
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:51.800]  of versions there was 40 versions two weeks ago then 100 now there's hundreds of versions
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:56.920]  that's not normal there's things don't only mutate like that but see it's four viruses
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:03.880]  it's engineered it's basically nano tech they always argue that viruses really aren't alive
[1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:10.200]  because they reproduce but that's it they're like digital information versus rna it's biological
[1:13:10.200 --> 1:13:17.880]  viruses are robots and so nano tech is just a bunch of viruses you've engineered
[1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:22.680]  together do what you want and that's what it is it's a soft kill weapon
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:32.040]  so the virus is real but the hype to scare you and the clamp down is to take your freedoms into
[1:13:32.040 --> 1:13:38.360]  the future so they can lock you down in the future and you behave yourself when they release
[1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:43.400]  plagues that are even worse as i predicted in in-game blueprint for global enslavement because
[1:13:43.400 --> 1:13:48.520]  that's how they'll do it they'll release viruses that are somewhat deadly spread fast that reinfect
[1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:53.000]  the way down society then they'll herd you into compact smart bubbles that big tech advertises
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:58.920]  their city hubs that are safe that have all the surveillance and then everybody else dies that
[1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:04.600]  isn't inside the bubble city and that's what the globalists have said they said we're going away
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:09.400]  from nation states not to a big loving world government but nation states will be gotten rid
[1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:15.560]  of to city states that are private and corporate owned that have the weapons the surveillance
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:21.080]  the medicine everything but you'll be fried with 5g and surveilled you will opt into the prison
[1:14:21.080 --> 1:14:26.440]  because outside the prison drones by night will deliver the bio weapon and you will have
[1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:31.960]  the intelligentsia herded into the real kill grid well everybody else hides in the countryside
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:36.760]  and that's the master plan and that's what they're doing that's what's going to unfold
[1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:40.840]  we can change it we can say no we can stop it you understand people here are going there's a
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:45.080]  Rockefeller reports how they'll use this for world government and people go look it up and
[1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:49.720]  they go oh my god they go here's all these reports and here's them calling for world government wow
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:14:58.840]  wow how'd you know this are you it's not just in that it's in club of realm documents 1968
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:06.040]  it's all in in game in game in game in game blueprint for global enslavement
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.680]  and what's the marvel movie in games about global extermination killing everybody
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:19.560]  and they complained the makers of that complained and said jones's in game is
[1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:23.880]  going to the top of amazon again and was getting watched by tens of thousands a day
[1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:28.280]  they said it's confusing it with our in game delete it even though i talked to one of the
[1:15:28.280 --> 1:15:35.080]  writers who reached out to me and they said that i inspired in game so i inspire their marvel movie
[1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:38.920]  and then i get censored because i inspired it by the way you think i'm joking that's that's not a
[1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:42.360]  joke my bragging it's just how much influence we have thanks to all these friends the word
[1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:46.840]  and chris carter said i influence all new x-files so they're all obsessed with the show because they
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:50.920]  know it's the truth they don't have the power to be truthful themselves they're all just selling
[1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:54.520]  out getting money and then building armored fortresses hoping they don't don't get killed by

[1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:11.800]  seeing that happen right now the globalists are openly trying to hype up the coronavirus trying
[1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:16.760]  to kill our economy and trying to have martial law shut down around the country and trying to
[1:18:16.760 --> 1:18:22.440]  stampede trump into implementing it so they can blame the imploding economy on him but trump has
[1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:27.320]  seen through it and so he's let them implement the draconian controls and is saying do you really
[1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:32.360]  want a depression for something that's killed far less than the flu ladies and gentlemen now is the

[1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:24.520]  i came here looking for something i couldn't find anywhere else
[1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:33.720]  but i don't want to be nobody just want a chance to be myself
[1:20:35.800 --> 1:20:43.320]  i've done a thousand miles of thumbing yes i've worn blisters on my heels
[1:20:45.640 --> 1:20:48.200]  trying to find me something better
[1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:55.880]  do on the streets of bakers field we are back live i'm your host alex jones and mike adams
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:21:02.200]  is here with us the next 45 minutes natural news dot com he has been dead on about it being manmade
[1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:08.920]  dead on about it mutating and reinfecting and now it's confirmed that it's attacking men's testicles
[1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:14.840]  so i know you have that whole depopulation aspect to it is the media hyping it to drive down the
[1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:20.360]  economy and take our liberties absolutely that's the larger globalist goal but it doesn't mean
[1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:27.560]  that the threat of the virus isn't real i simply said look out for your liberties uh and you know i
[1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:32.840]  hope the death rate goes down as we learn more people get tested and they're saying america
[1:21:32.840 --> 1:21:38.440]  leads it well yeah we've done more tests than anybody else but speaking of vindication they banned
[1:21:38.440 --> 1:21:45.080]  our app last week saying i was putting out disinformation the video that they referenced i
[1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:50.920]  was talking about all these governors banning doctors prescribing hydroxychloroquine that
[1:21:50.920 --> 1:21:58.520]  just pushes zinc into the cells has been described for 70 plus years and it and itself is just based
[1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:02.280]  on something the british army used to give their troops to stop malaria i was just covering that
[1:22:02.280 --> 1:22:10.440]  trump was right well now the fda today said okay we approve it europe's been using it great yes we
[1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:15.720]  approve it so here's the headlines fda approves emergency coronavirus treatment 30 million
[1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:20.840]  doses of animal area drugs or vitus they're all making it fda approves emergency use of malaria
[1:22:20.840 --> 1:22:25.080]  pills cover 19 treatment so they were going to do these trials but now they're just saying okay
[1:22:26.120 --> 1:22:31.000]  joining us to cover the waterfront is mike adams we've got the pentagon orders essential staff
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:37.480]  deep underground mountain bunker as pandemic prep escalates big worries of civil unrest popping up
[1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:42.440]  in europe and other areas they're now confirming what we told you a month ago the food is breaking
[1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:47.000]  down at the farmer levels there will be some food shortages there's much food as we waste maybe that
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:51.480]  will teach us to waste food we'll see what happens mike there's so many questions i've got if we
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:57.080]  haven't talked to you in almost a week so much is happening what is the latest mike adams well
[1:22:57.080 --> 1:23:01.240]  i've got some good news for you this is perhaps the first good news i've had for your audience
[1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:06.520]  in in quite some time uh it looks like in my estimation the evidence is now very clear that
[1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:13.400]  we could end all the lockdowns worldwide simply by mass producing zinc distributing zinc to all
[1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:18.680]  the people of the world for free in other words use the defense production act in america to
[1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:23.480]  distribute zinc supplements to people with good guidance about the proper doses so people don't
[1:23:23.480 --> 1:23:29.480]  overdose plus having people wear masks as they return to work and doing testing of asymptomatic
[1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:36.360]  patients so if you can crank up the testing the masks and the zinc i believe you can end this
[1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:43.160]  in the month of april i'm not even kidding i i think we could end this worldwide because zinc is now
[1:23:43.160 --> 1:23:50.040]  emerging as the single most important element to blocking the replication of the virus inside
[1:23:50.040 --> 1:23:55.560]  the body so you see there are two ways to block the virus you can use it you can use social isolation
[1:23:55.560 --> 1:24:01.480]  or lockdowns which of course destroy the economy so that's not good but you can also block the virus
[1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:08.440]  inside human cells and you do that with zinc and in severe cases chloroquine drives zinc into
[1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:12.600]  the cells as you just mentioned you're absolutely right there are all kinds of studies on that i
[1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:16.520]  just published an article a few minutes ago before i came on that that links to some of those
[1:24:16.520 --> 1:24:23.400]  studies by the way that a chloroquine is what's called a a what is it a zinc ion of four which
[1:24:23.400 --> 1:24:31.240]  means it enhances the chemistry of zinc to push it into your cells and their zinc kills cancer
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:37.160]  cells that's in some of the studies as well as blocks the replication of the corona virus class
[1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:42.760]  of viruses so i believe that right now we have solutions but because big pharma has a strangle
[1:24:42.760 --> 1:24:50.600]  hold on congress on the media even on the president we know why we know why the the leader of brazil
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:57.080]  said europe gave them hydroxychloroquine 95 97 percent rate if you get it early zinc's great
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:01.880]  they banned him blocked him on twitter they blocked me they they're desperate they don't
[1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:05.960]  want people to know about nutrition well this is this is the key and this is exactly why you were
[1:25:05.960 --> 1:25:11.320]  banned because you you were talking about a generic low-cost drug hydroxychloroquine can't
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:15.480]  make billions for big pharma because it's off patent it's been off patent for many many years
[1:25:15.480 --> 1:25:19.640]  and it's not a vaccine it's not a vaccine and it's not a vaccine right so you now have the
[1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:26.360]  suppression of lifesaving knowledge of cures actual cures between chloroquine and and zinc
[1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:31.400]  these are actual cures i believe that can stop this pandemic in its tracks i think we now have
[1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:36.200]  enough information to be able to say that and what should be happening right now alex is that
[1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:41.720]  there should be blood tests of all the patients who have this to check their zinc levels because i
[1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:47.640]  think we would see a very strong pattern of zinc deficiency and this is why some younger people
[1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:52.280]  are dying like like triathletes are dying from this why they're young they're healthy they have no
[1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:57.960]  underlying health conditions well guess what when you exercise a lot you sweat out zinc and other
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:01.880]  trace minerals and if you're not replenishing those minerals you can be zinc deficient you can die
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:07.000]  from this i think zinc really could be the silver bullet for this you know not to mention silver
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:12.360]  itself which has a topic why are they so well i mean the democrats are so evil like you said
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:16.440]  eight weeks ago they were saying keep things open don't block the chinese i agree totally
[1:26:16.440 --> 1:26:20.280]  blocked the flights even if there's any chance it's super bad and obviously is a really bad virus
[1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:25.560]  but like you kept saying if you have proper nutrition the studies are by prestigious
[1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:32.920]  vanderbilt uh harvard john hopkins say that it's like 98 99 percent that if you've got a bunch of
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:37.320]  zinc in you it's incredible let me ask you this so be sure the health ranger these medical doctors
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:43.240]  are saying take 250 milligrams a day the normal thing i guess is like 10 milligrams rda most of
[1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:48.200]  things are you know the 30 milligrams uh but i read some places that could be bad for the kidneys
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:53.080]  long term but i guess it's a trade-off what are you recommending people take zinc wise well
[1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:57.480]  well what those doctors are doing is trying to get deficient people up to a normal level so they
[1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:02.280]  would typically recommend only 250 milligrams that's a front load that's a front load exactly
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:06.920]  exactly but once you reach a blood level that is sufficient you obviously want to back off
[1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:11.240]  of that to about one tenth of that or even 25 milligrams per day but check with your own doctor
[1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:15.560]  your own naturopath you know each person's situation so i'm right 25 milligrams 30 is what
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:19.960]  i came up with just researching yeah that's that's really about in the right range and right now i'm
[1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:25.240]  taking about 50 milligrams a day in the form of zinc gluconate just because i i hadn't been taking
[1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:30.040]  enough zinc myself so i'm taking more i'll back off of that probably in another week or so the
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:35.800]  thing that's interesting about zinc is when you have too much when you you can taste zinc in water
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:39.160]  if you have too much zinc in your blood it will alter your taste and you'll be able to taste it
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:43.480]  it'll taste like a heavy metal that's really yucky that's when you know you have too much that's one
[1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:48.280]  way to know it and i was reading also make your hair fall out because it boosts testosterone well
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:53.560]  i i yeah probably so i don't know what all the side effects of excess a zinc intake are but it
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:27:59.480]  has a very wide range of efficacy and it can be very safely and very affordably made and the
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:04.360]  thing is zinc is i think the third most common element in the earth's crust so there's no shortage
[1:28:04.360 --> 1:28:08.680]  of zinc we're living on zinc well stay right there but isn't it good news that that the
[1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:12.840]  FDA has been forced to just say okay doctors you can give this to people i mean the idea that they
[1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:19.560]  block doctors off label doctors have always done this stuff well when i saw the democrat governors
[1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:23.160]  of states i think michigan was one of them and i'm not sure what others when i saw them
[1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:29.720]  outlawing or banning doctors from proscribe new york california it's 20 of them then i knew it i knew
[1:28:29.720 --> 1:28:34.200]  they want this to kill more americans they want this to be as bad as possible and and that has
[1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:39.160]  got to be stopped that is insane they are they are truly villains i know you've got huge numbers on
[1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:43.960]  projections is fouchy right 200 000 dead by the way people driven a wedge here saying me and might
[1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:48.680]  disagree with each other no we don't i've been trying i don't know what's going on okay i just
[1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:52.920]  know they don't want you to have drugs and zinc and things that you absolutely need that's all i know
[1:28:52.920 --> 1:29:00.440]  we'll be right back fellow patriots my name is todd savage founder of black rifle real estate dot

[1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:33.320]  as things break because so much is happening with 217 days out from the election now
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:39.800]  i began and i'll cover this in the fourth hour getting inundated with footage of empty hospitals
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:44.920]  all over europe and all over the united states and people it's good they're out researching it's
[1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:50.600]  good they're out doing things they go to hospitals that they've known in cadet kid in new york in
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:58.840]  texas in california in london uh in berlin germany and they go it's empty and all there are all
[1:34:58.840 --> 1:35:03.720]  these beds and they'll talk to the cops the cops go yeah usually a month ago this hospital is full
[1:35:03.720 --> 1:35:11.800]  of people nobody's here now everyone is thinking that that means it's all a hoax no folks when
[1:35:11.800 --> 1:35:16.600]  they think there's going to be a major pandemic they designate certain hospitals as quarantine
[1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:20.360]  centers and they're not going to have regular patients there they're cleaning them out and
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:29.240]  getting them ready for emergency triage facilities so that's where people go off half-cocked that's
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:33.960]  what it appears to me in the last few days having these videos come in and i didn't air them yet
[1:35:33.960 --> 1:35:37.720]  because i couldn't figure out what was going on then i made some phone calls i looked and found
[1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:41.720]  the few places i were able to call that they are indeed if you can get a doctor or a nurse on the
[1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:46.360]  phone yeah no we're cleared out um you know just to handle coronavirus now the thing is they're
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:51.400]  not overwhelmed yet because it hasn't peaked and there is a lot of media hype going on and there
[1:35:51.400 --> 1:35:55.720]  is footage out of england where they're going around saying a guy died in the building who didn't
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:35:59.560]  and they're all in hazmat suits so there is some leftist fear mongering going on
[1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:05.640]  but then we got this footage that's up on info wars dot com that we'll cover next hour
[1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:11.960]  irresponsible cbs slammed for using coronavirus footage from italian hospital to
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:17.480]  portray new york city saying it was new york saying it was overwhelmed showing people in
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:22.840]  the hallways that's like abc showing the knob creek machine gun shootout and saying that trump
[1:36:22.840 --> 1:36:30.760]  allowed the turks to blow up a Kurdish city it was 10 foot tall gasoline plumes mushroom clouds
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:36.920]  from gas tanks getting blown up by machine guns it wasn't 5 000 foot mushroom clouds like they said
[1:36:36.920 --> 1:36:41.640]  so that video is up on news wars dot com info wars dot com we'll cover next hour going back to mike
[1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:47.160]  adams mike there are a lot of people that are either in one camp or the other as you know it's
[1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:52.680]  a total hoax no one's died it's all made up a giant power grab or it's the end of the world no
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:57.320]  it's more sophisticated than that yes they're using it for a power grab yes there's a rock
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:37:00.920]  a feller foundation report to bring in world government with this yes they're admitting
[1:37:00.920 --> 1:37:08.120]  absolutely drones control we hate that but looking at this coronavirus and it's man made it really
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:13.480]  is bad and now it is reinfecting and now we know it's part of people's testicles so the best you
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:20.520]  can tell what is the providence what is the gene pool what is the pedigree what is the genealogy
[1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:24.840]  of this and and now that we're getting a clear picture where is it going well it's clearly an
[1:37:24.840 --> 1:37:30.040]  engineered biological weapon as you and i reported now almost a couple of months ago
[1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:35.800]  it was clearly man made it and you described it well it's it's kind of a nanotechnology this was
[1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:42.120]  created to be a not really an organism but a mechanism to cause mass death but the thing is
[1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:48.360]  what's happening with the media lies and what's happening with the the the attempt to silence
[1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:54.280]  information about chloroquine or zinc or other immune boosting substances is that
[1:37:55.720 --> 1:37:59.560]  really the virus isn't killing enough people from the point of view of the globalist they
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:04.040]  want the virus to kill more people so they have to silence anybody who talks about how to beat
[1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:08.760]  the virus because we can beat this virus we can beat this we can get our economy back on track
[1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:14.520]  that's my message for today alex is that we can end the lockdowns we can end the lockdowns but it
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:20.520]  requires silencing big pharma for a minute and saying shut up about your vaccines and drugs for a
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:25.080]  moment so that we can focus on zinc which is available right now and hydroxychloroquine which
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:30.840]  is a an off-label you know very affordable low-cost drug that can help in in severe cases
[1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:36.840]  we can solve this we can beat this we don't have to wait 18 months for a vaccine but the media is
[1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:41.800]  silencing all of us who have this message of hope for humanity because they want it to be bad so
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:47.400]  yes it is a biological weapon alex but it's not the weapon that they really want it doesn't have
[1:38:47.400 --> 1:38:53.800]  the death rate they wanted which was maybe you know 500% worse than what it is right now it's
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:57.720]  not quite there from the point of view of the globalists and they know that we can beat this if
[1:38:57.720 --> 1:39:02.040]  the knowledge gets out and so that's why they're shutting you off with the google app and that's
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:06.360]  why the tech giants are part of this look the tech giants have engaged in censorship just like
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:10.840]  china did because they want this to be bad they want america's economy to collapse they want
[1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:15.880]  trump to be defeated over this issue the way to protect trump and this has been my motivation from
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:21.480]  the start the way to protect trump initially was to do the lockdowns until we found a solution
[1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:26.920]  now we have a solution let's use the solution which is zinc and chloroquine and masks and let's end
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:31.000]  the lockdowns as soon as he has to do the lockdowns because they were prepositioning it to blame every
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:36.120]  death on him and even when he did that they still tried to blame it and as you said cdc brought it
[1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:41.480]  in their globalist uh they they put the people out on purpose the democrats tried to tell trump
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:46.360]  don't block any flights don't do any lockdowns hoping it would get really bad and now they've
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:50.600]  had all the governors that are democrats try to block things they know are wonderful treatments
[1:39:50.600 --> 1:39:56.600]  they are true villains who are they taking orders from well the communists the communists in fact
[1:39:56.600 --> 1:40:01.640]  china has been sending testing kits you've seen these stories to european nations and states in
[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:06.680]  the u.s. testing kits that don't work and twitter and twitter purpose exactly and twitter has been
[1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:11.720]  letting them put out all the propaganda they want saying the u.s. army released it because jack dorsi
[1:40:11.720 --> 1:40:17.080]  is a communist he is with the communist chinese and the chinese are trying to sow total chaos
[1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:21.560]  across the u.s. healthcare industry with false positives and false negatives so that we can't
[1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:27.800]  identify the people who really have it and and we fail to identify uh asymptomatic carriers who are
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:35.080]  the ones who are spreading it so look communism is the enemy of humanity communism with this virus
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:39.880]  is what's killing people and killing economies and the way to beat the communist is to have
[1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:47.080]  us made testing kits that work us made masks that work and us manufactured zinc supplements
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:52.440]  and hydroxychloroquine it's really that simple alex we we've now narrowed this down to about
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:57.400]  four things that can solve this we can get america back to work we can have elections on time
[1:40:57.400 --> 1:41:01.640]  we can stop the cycle of replication of this virus we know the solutions now
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:06.200]  that's what we need to be doing and we know they're playing blame trump for it uh have mail
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:11.080]  in ballots they can steal the election and then let the chai comms literally have our own media
[1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:16.120]  run chai com propaganda against our own country i mean this country is an award literally i mean
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:21.240]  when you're saying this i'm hyperventilating because it's so epic it's so real and you were
[1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:26.760]  panicked so was i because it was man-made the media was praising zeezy ping then attacking trump
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:30.840]  i mean you can see the setup but i don't think it's gone the way they wanted so now let's ask the
[1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:35.000]  question how do you see this playing out and here's the problem what do they pull next because they
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:41.400]  haven't given up they only escalate well my current numbers are lower than dr fauci's numbers i'm
[1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:46.680]  currently projecting between 45 000 and 90 000 fatalities in the united states through the
[1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:54.040]  end of the month of july that number might get a lot lower depending on what we do from here
[1:41:54.040 --> 1:42:00.520]  forward if more people become aware of zinc if more doctors are allowed to prescribe a hydroxy
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:05.640]  chloroquine if if people wear more masks then those numbers could get significantly lower we
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:09.640]  might end up with only tens of thousands of deaths which would be an amazing victory since
[1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:14.040]  we were looking at two million if we did nothing but fortunately when we won't see two million
[1:42:14.040 --> 1:42:18.280]  anymore we've got this much more under control and we can we can do better yet
[1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:24.280]  mike you've got a lot up at naturalnews.com we repost a lot of it i'm appreciate you let us do
[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:29.320]  that to m4s.com and newswords.com tell me some of the other big stories you've got well i'm i'm
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:33.800]  very concerned that trump knows that there there might be more things coming beyond this virus
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:38.040]  uh you've got the pentagon ordering high-level officials into underground bunkers in colorado
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:43.720]  and trump calling up one million medical reservists to join uh in in you know treating treating
[1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:49.160]  injuries and perhaps combat injuries if we get invaded or something that's right america absolutely
[1:42:49.160 --> 1:42:52.360]  the globalists you just said they're gonna launch more stuff they didn't just send the troops into
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:58.440]  norad for no reason we're now heading up to the death cons we'll be right back allergies dander
[1:42:58.440 --> 1:43:04.840]  asthma germs toxins there are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air

[1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:12.360]  we know by the scripting and the choreography and the fact that the virus has been scanned
[1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:17.400]  that it's man-made and attack on our economy the globalist media is firmly behind this
[1:45:17.400 --> 1:45:23.720]  devastating the united states and driving from from power but now we know from scores of studies
[1:45:23.720 --> 1:45:31.880]  from china the uk the united states europe brazil japan that the virus reinfects and attacks
[1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:36.600]  different parts of the body that ladies and gentlemen is an engineered bio weapon just as
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:42.680]  the indian scientist eight weeks ago conclusively proved their major university they have a name

[1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:09.000]  i've got
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:21.800]  to try to find a way to see i won't be much when you get through with me he never gives up he's alex
[1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:31.720]  jones broadcasting from deep in the heart of texas worldwide well i thought the day i met you
[1:47:31.720 --> 1:47:39.160]  you were me i had to tell you our guests our callers our crew this is the most important broadcast
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:46.760]  out there now the pace world and this country's been so vulcanized that a large swath of the public
[1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:51.080]  even those that are somewhat away have to be in two camps either it's the end of the world
[1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:58.920]  or it's a hoax uh no i've i've looked into these toronto viruses uh they're the real deal china is
[1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:05.720]  a stinking pig pen with all this industrial stuff right next to shanty towns the people are run down
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:15.400]  in horrible toxic ways it's a petri dish like a dirty daycare for germs and the timing and the
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:20.680]  release and the choreography and the bill gates behavior and the vaccine pushing and the drones
[1:48:20.680 --> 1:48:27.720]  and the lockdown yes the lockdown of it's really a bad virus can slow it the point is to me that
[1:48:27.720 --> 1:48:34.360]  does you matter it's the kill the economy response is the main target and then comes the police state
[1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:39.400]  and then comes the soft kill and the reinfection of the testicles but thank god there's hope if
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:45.160]  you're a diver the answer when you're 100 feet down is having an extra tank so you don't drown
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:52.680]  and asphyxiate and get back to the surface well you wonder why cancer is exploding you wonder
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:58.200]  why all this is going on if you don't have the right vitamins and minerals that are essential
[1:48:59.720 --> 1:49:02.840]  you don't die in four minutes without vitamin c you die in six months
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:12.680]  you don't die without water in a few minutes you die in four or five days well you die without
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:17.160]  zinc in five six months it depends but i mean you get degenerate you get sick you get a cold you're
[1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:24.200]  dead why they're essential and to watch the media in unison censor the president of brazil
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:33.480]  saying oh in america and europe they're using z pack and hydroxy chloroquine and zinc and they
[1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:39.560]  banned his videos he's out giving speeches this is so criminal mike and i'm glad you keep going
[1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:44.920]  back to that because for me for everybody this is the final straw that breaks the camel's back
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:49.960]  Pelosi saying you don't block flights at xenophobic biden saying that no go out go out in late
[1:49:49.960 --> 1:49:55.160]  february and now saying every death is trump's fault what in the world is going on here mike
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:50:00.440]  adams well i i believe that when when this is all said and done we need to have mass investigations
[1:50:00.440 --> 1:50:06.520]  and mass arrests of people who are communist chinese puppets in the united states and that
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:11.320]  includes certain left-wing senators it includes certain members of the so-called press who call
[1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:16.200]  themselves journalists but but are just puppets for communist china we need to completely remove all
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:21.800]  all trade extricate ourselves from trade with china over the next four years so that we don't
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:26.680]  depend on china for anything starting with the medicine right starting with medicine absolutely
[1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:33.160]  but also rare earth minerals electronics many other things we need to just basically blockade china
[1:50:33.160 --> 1:50:37.400]  because it's a communist regime that lied to the world that allowed this to be released and then
[1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:42.520]  covered it up making it far worse china refused to share data that would have saved lives all over
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:47.880]  the world and then china has been telling the media what to report about this while sending us
[1:50:47.880 --> 1:50:52.680]  faulty test kits on incredible they tell the un publicly this is not debated folks in case you
[1:50:52.680 --> 1:50:58.040]  didn't know they tell the e u and the un what to say and then they tell our media they're the boss
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:03.000]  they're the they're the boss and the w h o is nothing but a bunch of communist chinese puppets
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:08.760]  who won't even mention the nation of taiwan which is a standalone independent nation that deserves
[1:51:08.760 --> 1:51:14.840]  to have a seat at the table when talking about this by the way look china is the enemy of humanity
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:19.640]  under communism not the chinese people who want to be free but the chinese communist regime it's
[1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:25.320]  the enemy of humanity and probably a third of the members of our congress are chinese puppets
[1:51:25.320 --> 1:51:30.520]  and they need to be in my opinion investigated prosecuted you know arrested and prosecuted
[1:51:30.520 --> 1:51:35.080]  and held to account for what they have done i totally agree and now there's a mass awakening
[1:51:35.080 --> 1:51:41.400]  by members of the u.s intelligence committee uh cotton holly uh british intelligence has come out
[1:51:41.400 --> 1:51:46.360]  and said look we think the chai comms launched it and the fact that they're blaming the u.s army
[1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:50.600]  when china covered all this up they said morris johnson said there's gonna be a reckoning the
[1:51:50.600 --> 1:51:55.240]  british don't usually talk like that unless they mean it so people are really pissed well they
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:52:00.120]  they should be because all of this was preventable all of it i mean we didn't have to undergo
[1:52:00.120 --> 1:52:05.080]  this pandemic we didn't have to suffer these these economic shutdowns and all this chaos that's
[1:52:05.080 --> 1:52:10.680]  happening this was all preventable china caused all of this communism caused all of this and
[1:52:10.680 --> 1:52:16.520]  communism is still silencing voices like yours and mine who are trying to offer solutions to humanity
[1:52:16.520 --> 1:52:22.520]  americans should be so mad that that now they're restricting you everywhere they're blocking us
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:28.680]  everywhere and all we're doing is showing mainline studies about zinc and and z pack and all of it
[1:52:28.680 --> 1:52:34.760]  and the and the chloroquine i cannot believe that it's that evil congress must act against big tech
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:40.360]  they're now censoring the president of brazil no think about this the the media has been more
[1:52:40.360 --> 1:52:46.120]  critical of you than they have been critical about the communist chinese regime that harvests
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:52.360]  organs from political prisoners for their black market organ trade i mean think about this why
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:57.240]  is china able to have its propaganda channels on twitter but i'm not allowed to be on twitter
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:03.240]  when i'm trying to help america save american lives get us back on our feet restore our economy
[1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:07.640]  even protect our liberties during this as much as eight weeks ago take zinc i mean that's just
[1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:13.480]  that's just it's it's the met why is it the mega antiviral you just type in zinc antiviral there's
[1:53:13.480 --> 1:53:19.080]  thousands of procedures studies they're like it's a miracle 100 percent 97 percent stoppage rate but
[1:53:19.080 --> 1:53:23.320]  you've got to have already in your body you can't what i was reading is once you're already sick it's
[1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:28.360]  you got a problem well there's something i i'm about to do an article on this there are three
[1:53:28.360 --> 1:53:35.400]  elements that can save humanity it's zinc silver and gold because zinc can stop the replication
[1:53:35.400 --> 1:53:42.280]  of many viruses and stop the pandemic silver is both a monetary base and and also a metal that
[1:53:42.280 --> 1:53:46.600]  can be made into colloidal silver for topical treatments or sanitizing surfaces it's very
[1:53:46.600 --> 1:53:51.640]  effective for that and gold can be should be our our money standard where we wouldn't have these
[1:53:51.640 --> 1:53:55.320]  trillions of dollars of helicopter money that's ultimately going to destroy the value of the
[1:53:55.320 --> 1:54:02.760]  dollar so zinc silver and gold can save humanity and yet what is all the suppression about out
[1:54:02.760 --> 1:54:06.920]  there it's about suppressing the truth about a gold standard or suppressing the truth about
[1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:12.680]  colloidal silver or silver rounds as money or suppressing the truth about zinc that can save
[1:54:12.680 --> 1:54:16.840]  lives so think about this the answers are so simple alex they're on the table of elements
[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:22.040]  by the way that's that that acidic jewish doctor in new york is now treated and cured
[1:54:22.040 --> 1:54:27.880]  600 plus people it was 340 last week forcing the fda to go ahead and authorize this imagine
[1:54:27.880 --> 1:54:32.920]  qualmo threatened to arrest him just a week ago and he's a well-known respected doctor and all
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:37.880]  he's doing is following the european union regimen that works and that's just like common is china
[1:54:37.880 --> 1:54:42.920]  arresting that whistleblower doctor whom they later had to apologize about because he became a folk
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:47.880]  hero in china you know qualmo's acting just like the common is trying to suppress what's working
[1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:53.880]  for people trying to suppress the truth why is the last one a sabotage society well well for all
[1:54:53.880 --> 1:54:58.280]  the reasons we've mentioned from months that they're a culture of death they want to murder babies
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:03.160]  they want to murder adults the pandemic is doing the job that democrats have have worshiped and
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:07.480]  celebrated forever which is just killing people and making people bleed the death and bleed and now
[1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:11.480]  they're going to destroy your testicles and your lungs and your your nervous system because this
[1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:16.680]  also attacks the nerves it's exactly and again we're not saying this to scare you we're saying

[2:00:13.480 --> 2:00:20.920]  till i became a wanted man hunting never even owned a gun but now they hunt me like a mountain
[2:00:20.920 --> 2:00:31.800]  hat and i'm always always always always on the run and always carrying a gun
[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:41.560]  i killed poor jett brine in a you know folks killed him with my bare hands for the girl i
[2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:45.960]  loved that night i asked for all this but i appreciate you guys keeping us in the fight
[2:00:45.960 --> 2:00:52.600]  because i am a wanted man and you know a man by his enemies but i'm not worried about what they do
[2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:55.400]  to me but i want to stay in the fight so thank you for spreading the word about the broadcast
[2:00:55.400 --> 2:00:59.880]  and by the products because you you really pissed them off and imagine the world without info wars
[2:00:59.880 --> 2:01:03.560]  and without people like mike adams so mike in the short time we have i really appreciate you
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:07.240]  hope you'll host more of the shows with us too to really get into the in-depth things that are
[2:01:07.240 --> 2:01:11.720]  happening you're absolutely right to get folks attention this is a big one a big task anyway
[2:01:11.720 --> 2:01:17.080]  you slice it what do you expect for them to do to trump next because obviously we haven't defeated
[2:01:17.080 --> 2:01:21.640]  this thing yet but i think we're starting to turn as we're making the fda talk about zinc talk about
[2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:26.040]  other things but what are they going to do next like i was asking eight nine weeks ago what's
[2:01:26.040 --> 2:01:32.120]  next when the impeachment fails well now we know what's next after this or biological weapons will
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:37.480]  be released against the united states weapons that are slightly different enough different that
[2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:42.920]  even those who are already immune to covid-19 coronavirus won't be immune to the new strain
[2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:48.520]  and any vaccine that might come around next year sometime will be worthless against the
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:52.600]  new strain so alex i believe they're going to release a new biological weapon every year
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:57.400]  year after year until they get the collapse in the depopulation they want period that's what
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:01.080]  they're going to do because it's been more effective than anything else they've ever tried
[2:02:01.080 --> 2:02:06.840]  now sure they could launch an emp weapon or a military attack or some other attack because of
[2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:12.440]  the softening up effect of destroying our whole you know economy and and overrunning our hospitals
[2:02:12.440 --> 2:02:17.400]  and so on but i think from the globalist point of view new strains of new biological weapons are
[2:02:17.400 --> 2:02:22.760]  the most effective they just proved it this this was just the first release of many and we know
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:26.440]  that media and the deep state with the scripting are going to exacerbate it as badly as possible
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:31.320]  the answer is for me move out in the country get really healthy and boost my immune system that's
[2:02:31.320 --> 2:02:36.120]  really the main defense absolutely we can survive this i think we already know how and we covered
[2:02:36.120 --> 2:02:42.040]  that in previous segments here we can survive this but if as long as big pharma has a stranglehold
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:47.640]  on information across society including the tech giants no one will ever be allowed to say take
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:54.120]  zinc or or you know hydroxychloroquine can be useful in many cases or boost your immune function so
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:59.720]  this is actually a big pharma mass death campaign as much as it is coronavirus and i believe most
[2:02:59.720 --> 2:03:04.440]  of the people who are dying are people who are on high blood pressure drugs by the way that has
[2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:08.840]  been strongly associated with the deaths so far so the the drugs are killing people it's it's a
[2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:14.760]  binary weapon system first they get you on big pharma then they release the virus that specifically
[2:03:14.760 --> 2:03:19.800]  targets those who are deficient in nutrition and are taking prescription medications that's
[2:03:19.800 --> 2:03:24.440]  who's dying right now so if you out there listening if you're overall healthy you're not on big
[2:03:24.440 --> 2:03:29.720]  pharma's drugs and you have good nutrition your chances of dying from this are almost zero almost
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:37.880]  zero not quite but very close well mic i tell you it's just a crazy time to be alive and to be
[2:03:37.880 --> 2:03:43.160]  watching all of this unfold and the villainy of the democratic party in the media but when you
[2:03:43.160 --> 2:03:47.720]  realize they're literally owned by the chai comms and the globalists and they're just following
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:52.440]  orders it won't matter if it destroys polosia or destroys brian williams or destroys hillary
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:57.880]  they're just following their operation they're just carrying it out like human wave attacks when
[2:03:57.880 --> 2:04:03.240]  the chinese attack is in korea they're just zombies well humanity is the enemy of the globalists
[2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:08.840]  and especially of the communists and so this this is what the war looks like this is the info war
[2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:13.640]  and it's the bio war we're living it now you're seeing it it has come to your door if you're in
[2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:18.440]  new york city you know where they're lifting bodies with forklifts on pallets in the in the
[2:04:18.440 --> 2:04:22.600]  you know reefer trucks to to transport all the bodies out of there this is what a total global
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:27.800]  communist war against humanity looks like folks this is it and and we we we better get smart and
[2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:33.000]  survive this and i think we know how now and we watch the media and the cdc help incubate it
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:38.200]  we watched them all try to leave the borders open uh trumps gotta run ads of polosi saying we need
[2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:42.280]  to go out we need to go to china town in late february we need to let the flights from china
[2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:47.880]  in and then cut to her saying every death is trumps fault that woman is literally rotten to the core
[2:04:47.880 --> 2:04:52.680]  physically rotting in front of us natural news dot com great job mike thank you so much thank you
[2:04:54.360 --> 2:05:02.200]  every week every day every hour every minute every second right now is critical history is
[2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:06.280]  happening right in front of us and we can't be spectators we've got to be men and women
[2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:11.720]  in the arena regardless of race color creed age sexual privacy it doesn't matter the globalists
[2:05:11.720 --> 2:05:16.440]  with the chai comms and others are openly trying to plunge our economy and start a new depression
[2:05:16.440 --> 2:05:21.720]  china who hyped up this virus is now back to work and ramping up their economy while ours is
[2:05:21.720 --> 2:05:27.240]  going into a freefall spiral and trumps desperately trying to restart it and create confidence and
[2:05:27.240 --> 2:05:32.360]  the globalist corporate media that was worshiping china just a month or so ago and their response
[2:05:32.360 --> 2:05:37.960]  is saying trump is terrible because they want america to fail they want you to fail but you
[2:05:37.960 --> 2:05:42.840]  can expose them you can speak out you can share the articles and videos and reports at info wars
[2:05:42.840 --> 2:05:48.600]  and bandot video that expose them and the globalist will go down it's already blowing up in their
[2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:52.680]  face right now so press the attack on the info war and defeat the nwo
[2:05:52.680 --> 2:06:10.440]  they want to hurt us
[2:06:10.440 --> 2:06:22.200]  you want to control us
[2:06:22.200 --> 2:06:31.800]  by my side hit them up
[2:06:44.600 --> 2:06:46.280]  yeah the globalists are trying to
[2:06:46.280 --> 2:06:53.240]  hurt us into their cashless society into their drone surveillance into their forced
[2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:59.320]  inoculations and desperately trying to hide the fact that high doses of zinc before you get the virus
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:07.160]  are almost impregnable in the studies it's like an abram's tank and you're shooting at it with a
[2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:16.520]  357 magnum it shoots for a car door and kill you or at least hurt you but you shoot an abram's tank
[2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:21.320]  whether it doesn't even put a dent in it because it's made out of depleted uranium
[2:07:23.480 --> 2:07:27.880]  and armored steel and if you've got zinc in your cells and around your cells
[2:07:29.800 --> 2:07:36.440]  at high levels you don't die in almost every case and that pisses the globalist off and
[2:07:36.440 --> 2:07:40.200]  then if you have hydroxychloroquine that drives it the cells and now they took me off google
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:46.360]  app last week banned it saying i said that that hydroxychloroquine was a promising treatment
[2:07:46.360 --> 2:07:51.160]  because fauci said it on wednesday that he would prescribe it well they ordered the fda
[2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:56.040]  to legalize it today for all doctors to use it already really was there were prohibitions by
[2:07:56.040 --> 2:08:04.680]  governors just just so massive that they tried to hide that and that twitter banned the brazilian
[2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:10.360]  president's tweets talking about it and zinc they can't stop you though for now they probably
[2:08:10.360 --> 2:08:16.600]  will block it soon just type in zinc antiviral zinc antiviral corona virus and you'll get studies
[2:08:16.600 --> 2:08:22.520]  from five years ago a year ago from prestigious universities and hospitals with the corona virus
[2:08:22.520 --> 2:08:31.480]  family being knocked out by zinc amazing they've got university studies where they put breathing
[2:08:31.480 --> 2:08:35.880]  masks on people and aerosolize it in go to a doctor talk to them about it i'm not a doctor
[2:08:35.880 --> 2:08:43.320]  i'm telling you the promising news but they want you scared they want to sell deadly vaccines to
[2:08:43.320 --> 2:08:48.760]  you and let me tell you how else they want you scared remember abc news got caught showing footage
[2:08:48.760 --> 2:08:53.960]  of knob creek machine gun shootout the minute i saw it it was knob creek every year for decades they go
[2:08:55.320 --> 2:09:00.280]  a couple hundred people line up with full auto machine guns with tracer rounds and then they
[2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:07.640]  start shooting tannerite and gasoline cans and again they blow up in big five ten foot tall
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:14.520]  mushroom clouds abc cropped it turned down the light levels and said kurnish city being vaporized
[2:09:15.480 --> 2:09:26.680]  by the evil turks under trump's command it was all a lie but we're not supposed to question them
[2:09:26.680 --> 2:09:32.040]  no no no not supposed to question small order question any mass shooting just don't question it
[2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:38.440]  but the democrats will sue you well it's an info wars dot com article by don salazar
[2:09:39.800 --> 2:09:47.160]  needs to go viral cbs slam for using corona virus footage from italian hospital to portray new
[2:09:47.800 --> 2:09:52.680]  your city so they show you a bunch of old people and others an overcrowded hospital
[2:09:53.240 --> 2:09:56.280]  and they don't show you that the other hospitals aren't actually crowded in new york
[2:09:56.280 --> 2:10:01.560]  we have that footage for you next hour that will roll some of that b-roll in a moment after we play
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:11.880]  this but uh here is the video from sky news cbs also ran this here is the patients are literally
[2:10:11.880 --> 2:10:22.280]  gasping for air the plastic bubbles the staff struggle to communicate through attempt to equalize
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:33.160]  the air pressure in the lungs nobody expected this nobody thought they'd be treating so many so quickly
[2:10:33.960 --> 2:10:41.320]  and it's not like flu it is chronic pneumonia and it is killing hundreds each day there are now
[2:10:41.320 --> 2:10:46.360]  15 patients the doctors say they've seen nothing like it before and are warning other countries
[2:10:46.360 --> 2:10:51.880]  especially the united kingdom that they will see it as well people have keep describing this as like
[2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:59.560]  flu it's worse than that no it's it's it's totally another thing i think it must and it goes on from
[2:10:59.560 --> 2:11:04.520]  there and then towards the end we have the sandwich video of cbs news running it but not
[2:11:04.520 --> 2:11:11.080]  showing you their italians and saying it was new york cbs news is being called out for airing
[2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:16.520]  footage from an italian hospital during a report on new york hospitals being overwhelmed cbs morning
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:21.080]  news ran the report in question was uploaded to youtube march 25th and covers the new york
[2:11:21.080 --> 2:11:26.280]  governor andrew qualmo talking the trump administration to task for not providing more ventilators
[2:11:27.080 --> 2:11:30.120]  so you see that piece of black propaganda is what it's called
[2:11:31.160 --> 2:11:34.440]  saying there's no ventilators we actually got a giant stockpile of them he had to admit
[2:11:34.440 --> 2:11:40.840]  read the transcript cbs reporter new york's governor says fema gave the state 400 ventilators
[2:11:41.800 --> 2:11:47.400]  to that he said this and he goes on to say trump won't give ventilators and they go look our people
[2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:55.400]  are dying total lie all fake giant hoax knock-a-cam shot please so again you can see right here the
[2:11:55.400 --> 2:12:01.640]  sky news about italy they run the same footage cover it all up and say that it is new york
[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:06.920]  city now let's go ahead and run some of the cbs morning report here go ahead and back that up and
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:13.800]  here it is thousand icu beds i would be lying if i didn't say there's an incredible amount of stress
[2:12:13.800 --> 2:12:19.000]  across the river from new york at holy name medical center in new jersey the chief infectious
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:26.200]  disease specialist says his hospital has just 10 ventilators barely enough for now but if the worst
[2:12:26.200 --> 2:12:32.440]  is yet to come as we're expecting then it won't be the mayor of los angeles says new york could be
[2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:38.680]  a preview of what's to come we are anywhere from about six to 12 days behind what we are seeing
[2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:45.400]  in new york city and now to louisiana cases are growing faster they're gonna touch the quamo
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:48.360]  bitching and lying and later he had to admit that he's got a giant stockpile of thousands
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:52.600]  and empty hospitals just waiting and ready in fact while i talk about this for the next few
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:12:57.400]  minutes roll some of the compilation footage for tv viewers we're gonna air the audio of this in the
[2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:03.320]  four tower of robert barnes of the empty hospitals all over new york all over cadeticate all over
[2:13:03.320 --> 2:13:07.720]  texas all over california we even have seen reporters go out and ask the police to go yeah
[2:13:07.720 --> 2:13:13.160]  this place was full two weeks ago now no one's here it's all empty but they tell you
[2:13:13.160 --> 2:13:19.320]  that they're all full ladies and gentlemen we have hours of this there are hundreds of clips
[2:13:20.040 --> 2:13:29.080]  all over twitter of empty parking lots empty everywhere and and and the people show the
[2:13:29.080 --> 2:13:35.720]  local news showing it full they go there and it's empty you just saw bombshell footage
[2:13:35.720 --> 2:13:40.840]  or you heard it if you're a radio listener of them saying that a crowded hospital in italy
[2:13:40.840 --> 2:13:48.920]  with people on ventilators and respirators like garth vader is america on cbs news this is the
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:54.760]  deception that we've got to just put together like a little three-minute concise report after
[2:13:54.760 --> 2:13:59.160]  the show on this and get it to go out because this is just unbelievable
[2:13:59.160 --> 2:14:06.120]  so they're definitely fear mongering at a new level or we have a special guest joining us
[2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:10.840]  to talk about how the globalists want to cause a civil war and civil unrest with this and how
[2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:14.440]  if trump doesn't get his way to open the country back up in the next few weeks and we don't use
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:21.160]  the antivirals like zinc and selenium is also excellent at vitamin d the vitamin bottom d3
[2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:27.000]  if we don't do that and if the google and facebook and twitter are able to block this
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:32.360]  then we will have the hospitals overwhelmed as this is a serious virus but if you are loaded
[2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:37.960]  up on d3 and you're loaded up on zinc it doesn't mean you're bulletproof but it's like wearing
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:44.840]  level three body armor it's go look at the studies yourself they are so pissed at me
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:49.640]  but it's a fact and they're pissed at the the president they're pissed at the president of
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:53.880]  brazil and trump even last night his press conference was like well we're doing the studies
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:57.720]  now i'd heard it was very promising in europe but we'll see i have a feeling it's gonna come out
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:15:04.040]  be really good because he knows the studies it's in the high 90s and that's when you're already sick
[2:15:06.600 --> 2:15:11.960]  i'ma say it again if you don't have enough zinc in your body and you take the hydroxychloroquine
[2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:16.760]  from what i've read it does weird things your tissues because it just forces zinc into the cells
[2:15:16.760 --> 2:15:21.720]  but what if there's not already enough zinc there it does some weird things you need the zinc before
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:26.600]  you need the zinc before and by the way a month ago zinc was sold out everywhere you can't find it
[2:15:26.600 --> 2:15:33.960]  hardly anywhere because people are smart and they do their own damn research others in one big study
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:39.880]  affects the zinc solves some mystery uh virus replication that's in children i remember correctly
[2:15:39.880 --> 2:15:46.840]  i can't read for that far away but uh yeah there it is get pediatric patients and you read it over
[2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:52.360]  a 90 success rate in people that were going to be terminal but google doesn't want you to know that
[2:15:53.320 --> 2:15:58.280]  attention all radio listeners who still need food supplies if you've thought about the implication
[2:15:58.280 --> 2:16:03.160]  of food related supply chain disruptions and are concerned about the coming quarantines
[2:16:03.160 --> 2:16:08.600]  this will be the most important message you will ever hear here's why in the next few days all
[2:16:08.600 --> 2:16:14.200]  americans will face extremely hard choices if we've learned anything from china and italy
[2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:19.800]  it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns are just a few days away here in the u.s listen
[2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:25.240]  while dehydrated food is becoming scarce you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom seeds

[2:19:08.680 --> 2:19:14.760]  research looking at different tv archives and i couldn't find hardly anything except a couple
[2:19:14.760 --> 2:19:22.680]  local news stories with medical doctors on there talking about zinc zinc zinc the element on the
[2:19:22.680 --> 2:19:31.400]  periodic table that is essential to life and that is the most antiviral natural compound out there
[2:19:31.400 --> 2:19:37.960]  in thousands and thousands of studies by the most prestigious universities including big studies
[2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:47.720]  on the coronavirus family so do yourself a favor search engine zinc and antiviral three words zinc
[2:19:47.720 --> 2:19:52.920]  antiviral zinc antiviral do yourself a favor zinc antiviral

[2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:41.400]  life grew and the blood gave life to the branches of the tree and the blood was the price that set
[2:20:41.400 --> 2:20:50.920]  the captives free and the numbers that came through the fire and the flood clung to the tree and
[2:20:50.920 --> 2:20:58.200]  were redeemed by the blood we are back live broadcasting world live i'm your host alex jones

[2:21:36.840 --> 2:21:39.640]  stations are actually asking saying yeah we want to pick it up they're gonna want to five days a
[2:21:39.640 --> 2:21:45.240]  week so we'll work on that so that's coming up john mark was a youtuber political analyst
[2:21:45.240 --> 2:21:50.760]  dedicated helping american patriots make the mistakes of the 20th century and implement strategies
[2:21:50.760 --> 2:21:55.480]  that will save our civilization obstruction to hands of parasitic elites and leftists he predicts
[2:21:55.480 --> 2:21:59.560]  an america current political crisis will likely end in some combination of civil war separation
[2:21:59.560 --> 2:22:04.360]  or secession movements he used already breaking up he is a strong opponent of the solutions provided
[2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:13.080]  by what is that proper terrianism to bring us out of the crisis provide a secure and prosperous
[2:22:13.080 --> 2:22:18.040]  future for america and ensure our descendants don't have to go through this conflict again
[2:22:18.040 --> 2:22:23.880]  john mark says dot com and et john mark says on twitter and you've got a lot to cover today
[2:22:23.880 --> 2:22:28.120]  want to go over with you the likelihood of civil war coming to america root causes the conflict
[2:22:28.120 --> 2:22:33.880]  what could trigger it to go hot and what it could happen if it did coronavirus developments
[2:22:33.880 --> 2:22:39.800]  separations of session talk why the left never learns and proper terrianism so thanks for joining
[2:22:39.800 --> 2:22:45.240]  us what do you want to tackle first john well i think it'd be good and first of all thanks very
[2:22:45.240 --> 2:22:49.240]  much for having me alex i appreciate it and i think it would be a good place to pick off
[2:22:49.800 --> 2:22:54.280]  to pick up with all of you've been talking about with the coronavirus just start out talking about
[2:22:54.280 --> 2:22:59.560]  one of the main things i talk about on my youtube channel which is uh i think it's deterministic
[2:22:59.560 --> 2:23:06.600]  that some sort of civil war in some way shape or form will come to america um whether that's
[2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:12.360]  fourth generation warfare secession separation movements uh i've been saying for a while and
[2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:16.600]  others that i'm involved with have been saying as well that it's pretty much deterministic and so
[2:23:16.600 --> 2:23:22.680]  we could see some unrest from this coronavirus crisis situation depending on how successful
[2:23:22.680 --> 2:23:26.920]  our enemies are at tamping down on some of the common sense solutions you were talking about
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:32.440]  earlier with mike adams um and then there's also a longer term trend that is basically what's
[2:23:32.440 --> 2:23:37.880]  making it deterministic that america is not going to survive in its current form and that long
[2:23:37.880 --> 2:23:43.960]  term trend is what deterministic means for some people sure deterministic means uh you know it's
[2:23:43.960 --> 2:23:48.440]  about as certain as far as i can tell as the sun rising in the east in the morning there's there's
[2:23:48.440 --> 2:23:54.920]  no way to avoid it because the powers that be are not stopping the trend that is causing this to come
[2:23:54.920 --> 2:23:58.440]  to a head that's right that's why they're so confident even though they're losing now they
[2:23:58.440 --> 2:24:03.240]  believe the people are so weak and getting dumber and dumber because of the decadence uh because
[2:24:03.240 --> 2:24:08.200]  of the freedom that that it'll fall in the end absolutely they try to dump people down they
[2:24:08.200 --> 2:24:15.240]  don't want people to be informed and uh you know aside from even the core coronavirus aspect there's
[2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:20.920]  been a long-term trend since the 1965 immigration act where the immigrants that are coming in since
[2:24:20.920 --> 2:24:25.480]  then are voting more than two to one left-wing democrat and so they turn to california from
[2:24:25.480 --> 2:24:30.520]  red to deep deep blue now texas is turning purple more and more purple with every election
[2:24:31.160 --> 2:24:36.760]  and uh you know trump is probably going to win in 2020 because joe biden has dementia but uh after
[2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:42.200]  that it's going to be very hard for the republicans to win any elections just because of uh the way
[2:24:42.200 --> 2:24:46.360]  that the demographics vote we're not talking about every individual here we're talking about majority
[2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:52.040]  voting patterns that have a huge effect on how the elections go and so uh and this is something
[2:24:52.040 --> 2:24:56.920]  everybody in the political class knows uh you know all the politicians all the advisors all the
[2:24:56.920 --> 2:25:02.040]  campaign advisors they all know about this demographic voting patterns and and how they vote
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:06.520]  and it hasn't really changed in decades and it's just going to be coming to a head very soon so
[2:25:06.520 --> 2:25:11.640]  at the latest to take the guns and and make all our little boys have meetings and decide whether
[2:25:11.640 --> 2:25:14.760]  they want their genitals cut off i mean it's going to cause a civil war because they're not
[2:25:14.760 --> 2:25:19.720]  going to stop fourths inoculations 80 tax rates yeah they're they're coming they're not going to
[2:25:19.720 --> 2:25:25.240]  stop you sound exactly like me and my youtube channel alex where i say listen once the once
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:28.920]  these people get power where they are winning all the elections what do you think they're going to
[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:32.920]  do they're going to do exactly what they did in virginia which is go after the guns a number one
[2:25:33.560 --> 2:25:38.360]  and then we're going to i mean virginia is kind of like a microcosm of what we're going to see
[2:25:38.360 --> 2:25:42.440]  all across the nation as this starts happening more and more where we almost have de facto
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:48.680]  separation within the state of virginia between the big blue cities and the uh you know the rest
[2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:54.040]  of the state that you know has some kind of common sense in their heads well you're right i mean it
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:25:59.400]  it is a microcosm of all the sudden they wake up the democrats are going to ban all semi-autos
[2:25:59.400 --> 2:26:06.520]  ban gun shops and ban um shooting ranges ban 10 round magazines and up and all the sudden 50
[2:26:06.520 --> 2:26:10.680]  thousand people show up on the streets and then the left doesn't know what to do but it shows
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:18.120]  the immovable force runs into the unstoppable you know uh object here and it's it's it's just crazy
[2:26:19.160 --> 2:26:23.160]  absolutely and you bring up a good point which is uh one of the things i talk about on my channel is
[2:26:23.160 --> 2:26:29.720]  we now understand scientifically why the right wing cannot persuade the left wing for many decades
[2:26:29.720 --> 2:26:34.360]  we've thought in america as grassroots right wingers if we can just talk to the left enough if we
[2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:39.400]  can just explain it you know what i mean but they don't listen most of them obviously don't listen
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:46.120]  explain the science of that it's a real mental illness yes and in in these you know the leftist
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:50.280]  as you were talking about earlier with with uh mike i think you asked the question how why are
[2:26:50.280 --> 2:26:56.040]  they like this and so we understand scientifically why that why that is and so basically it comes down
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:27:02.920]  to um if you look at big five personality research um and uh that's kind of the most scientific way
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:07.960]  of analyzing people's personalities big five scientific research and then uh research on
[2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:13.000]  moral instincts the differences in moral instincts between leftists and right wingers left wingers
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:17.960]  have a very narrow range of moral instincts it's basically just harm and care it's almost like
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:22.520]  a mother the way a mother looks at an infant and they they're almost they don't think three
[2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:27.000]  dimensionally and they get manipulated very correct absolutely and that's why they're very
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:32.440]  easy to manipulate and uh so that's it's basically comes down to biology i mean there's three if you
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:37.160]  look at the data there's three personality clusters that the population basically divides into
[2:27:37.160 --> 2:27:41.080]  which is the left or we might call it the female instinct even though there's obviously
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:46.600]  men in that group as well uh the left like the consumption instinct we just we want to consume
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:50.680]  there are people that are needing now we need to give them what they need right now and then the
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:55.960]  libertarian which is like leave me alone to produce and then the what we call the mature male or
[2:27:55.960 --> 2:28:00.760]  conservative which is we're going to conserve and and defend and protect and advance all
[2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:05.880]  civilizational assets we're not going to allow it to be destroyed and that's kind of people like us
[2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:11.960]  because the left literally would say like a goat will pull up grass out of the dirt and eat the
[2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:17.080]  roots cows don't do that so we put goats on land like they did in texas it creates rocky
[2:28:17.080 --> 2:28:21.320]  scrub rush within a generation or so uh and and and so you can see like conservatives are more
[2:28:21.320 --> 2:28:27.320]  like cows they they leave the roots to grow back left this will will say cut down an apple orchard
[2:28:27.320 --> 2:28:32.200]  they'll pull the apples off as an as an allegory eat the apples and say and we want firewood this
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:37.320]  winter let's chop down the apple trees for firewood you go no no go on down the road and get those oak
[2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:43.240]  trees okay because they don't produce any fruit we will need these apples next next next year and
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:48.680]  they go no no we need firewood now it's quicker it's right here we're cutting the apple trees down
[2:28:48.680 --> 2:28:54.760]  in the backyard you're like but you'll get apples for 20 years don't do that attention gcn

[2:31:15.720 --> 2:31:19.720]  is to sterilize your son so he knows we've got an evil warm hunger i mean a lot of feminists are
[2:31:19.720 --> 2:31:24.040]  saying we should have the government passed laws that mail embryos account but what's better and more
[2:31:24.040 --> 2:31:29.320]  reformed and more humanitarian is to convince them when they're five years old and their testicles
[2:31:29.320 --> 2:31:33.880]  chopped off and again global warming is real we got to pay lord Rothschild all of our money and
[2:31:33.880 --> 2:31:37.960]  the pandemic's all real we've got to be locked up in our houses we've got to use the language
[2:31:37.960 --> 2:31:44.760]  the universities say we're not a culture anything oh no no we're not we're good people we're good
[2:31:44.760 --> 2:31:50.600]  people that went to these corporate systems that didn't brainwash us no no they enlightened us how
[2:31:50.600 --> 2:31:58.520]  to censor and how to rule and out of control there is a paradox yes this virus is deadly
[2:31:58.520 --> 2:32:05.720]  and does kill people and so do many other countless viruses that have already existed that do exist
[2:32:05.720 --> 2:32:13.160]  and will exist but when trump says the cure is worse than disease he's talking about the media
[2:32:13.160 --> 2:32:21.400]  hype creating hysteria and trying to create uncertainty and it is that that i oppose it is
[2:32:21.400 --> 2:32:29.240]  not the american way to cower and live in fear and to follow the edicts and precedents set by
[2:32:29.240 --> 2:32:36.120]  communist china and hyper authoritarian singapore where you're now being given six months in jail
[2:32:36.120 --> 2:32:43.000]  if you don't stand at least six feet away from someone this is being used by social engineers
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:49.720]  and they admit that they are trying to transform our world forever into something unrecognizable
[2:32:49.720 --> 2:32:53.800]  from what it's been we are not slaves and we must not act like it
[2:32:53.800 --> 2:33:00.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:06.520 --> 2:33:17.080]  i got off the riverboat new orleans in the spring of 82 i walked into a gambling house
[2:33:17.080 --> 2:33:27.880]  as gamblers often do i had myself a drink and i joined in a polka game the dealer was a woman
[2:33:28.920 --> 2:33:37.320]  so i asked her for her name she smiled at me so pretty but a hush fell over the place as a big
[2:33:37.320 --> 2:33:49.480]  man crossed the table stood up and slapped my face oh a knife oh a knife a long bladder and
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:58.840]  steel i have my gun don't take your evil life you can bet my bowie knife will we are back live
[2:33:58.840 --> 2:34:02.280]  broadcasting world wide i'm your host alex jones i think it was a good analogy i came up with
[2:34:02.280 --> 2:34:08.280]  in my life i chose imagined fruit trees they could produce 20 years 50 years there was some
[2:34:08.280 --> 2:34:13.400]  old apple trees that my dad said were old when he was a kid that were still producing
[2:34:13.400 --> 2:34:19.080]  apples 10 15 years ago in our ranch since then they've all finally died little shriveled apples but
[2:34:19.880 --> 2:34:25.240]  they were probably 70 year old apple trees but usually 20 years you know good apples out of an
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:31.480]  apple tree communists are the types that would chop down apple trees for firewood even though there's
[2:34:31.480 --> 2:34:39.720]  trees 100 yards further that's a communist type thing to do that's what they do in venezuela
[2:34:39.720 --> 2:34:46.520]  stuff just like that see conserving actually means having more it's holding seed back to
[2:34:46.520 --> 2:34:50.200]  replant it so farming is the best example to use of that but a communist would say
[2:34:51.640 --> 2:34:57.640]  no it's mean to make us go down the street a mile and cut oak trees we have apple trees
[2:34:57.640 --> 2:35:03.640]  in our backyard we have pear trees and we're going to cut those down for firewood but you're
[2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:09.480]  like but you'll get apples and pears for another decade or 20 years 30 years off these shut up
[2:35:09.480 --> 2:35:15.000]  racist we need fire now we need to be warm now i think that's a good allegory going back to john
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  mark uh successful and smart uh analyst he's got a great youtube and twitter channel for now um
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:27.240]  um i think that's a good parable what are some real world uh examples of that for people
[2:35:28.760 --> 2:35:33.240]  of the divide between left and right you're talking about well yeah how the left
[2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:37.400]  i mean obviously the controllers over the left are psychotic eugenicists and from the research
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:43.320]  but the average leftist thinks very one-dimensional like take all the rich people's money well if you
[2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:47.400]  took all the rich people's money it wouldn't even fund things for six months plus they've all written
[2:35:47.400 --> 2:35:51.560]  the law with their tax exemptment offshore and most the really rich people actually push taxes on
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:56.760]  middle class because they don't want competition the left doesn't get how it really works exactly
[2:35:56.760 --> 2:36:01.080]  right their brains are and this is why we beat our heads against the wall trying to talk to them
[2:36:01.080 --> 2:36:05.560]  it's so frustrating to talk to them because they just ignore all these points like the one you just
[2:36:05.560 --> 2:36:10.120]  made you know aoc ocasio-cortez goes out and says you know let's just take the money from the
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:14.120]  billionaires well that's not going to last very long and all it's going to do is flow right back
[2:36:14.120 --> 2:36:19.800]  up to more billionaires again so they they're just incapable of thinking in this long-term manner
[2:36:19.800 --> 2:36:24.760]  and i think your analogies are great there so to me what it brings up is okay what do we do
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:31.080]  about this then because we all sense the crisis escalating here in america obviously and then
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:35.720]  if the republican party very soon can't win any more elections due to immigration what is the
[2:36:35.720 --> 2:36:41.640]  solution to this thing and so that's why i talk about okay what could a civil war actually look
[2:36:41.640 --> 2:36:45.960]  like what what are some of the big factors to consider how could this possibly come about
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:52.120]  what would it look like and i always try to make three main points about that one is that
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:56.280]  the grassroots right wing is the largest army in the world and i don't think that needs much
[2:36:56.280 --> 2:37:03.160]  explanation but it's you know we're the largest heavily armed army in the world and then second
[2:37:03.160 --> 2:37:07.960]  our enemies you were talking about the immovable force meeting the immovable object our enemies
[2:37:07.960 --> 2:37:13.960]  don't really have much of an enforcement arm that they can rely on all they have is is the paramilitary
[2:37:13.960 --> 2:37:19.720]  that comes from our ranks already correct and even our military votes two thirds voted two
[2:37:19.720 --> 2:37:24.280]  thirds for trump so if they're gonna send our military to try to fight against trump supporters
[2:37:24.280 --> 2:37:27.880]  who are trying to defend the second amendment or whatever sure but what i'm saying is we need
[2:37:27.880 --> 2:37:32.360]  decisive victory against the left now or they're gonna keep rotting society destroying it they are
[2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:37.560]  any globalist outlaw group wanting to overthrow the republic itself so that's not their free speech
[2:37:37.560 --> 2:37:43.160]  they are literally an armed psychological warfare camp absolutely but when it comes i mean you've
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:47.320]  heard the phrase and i'm sure your audience knows the phrase all power at the end of the day flows
[2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:54.360]  out of the end of uh malsay tom barrel of a gun exactly so they don't actually have when if it
[2:37:54.360 --> 2:37:58.920]  comes to a fight like that they don't actually have much because they're the follower idiots they
[2:37:58.920 --> 2:38:04.360]  don't even know their mucks being controlled by a psychotic establishment and they think it's a
[2:38:04.360 --> 2:38:09.480]  virtue to not have a gun as if they don't even trust themselves correct and now it's kind of funny
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:13.080]  to see all of a sudden many of them are like oh i need a gun because there could be riots and
[2:38:13.080 --> 2:38:16.520]  somebody might try to take my food and we're all sitting here like yeah we've been telling you that
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:21.640]  for a long time so does this virus help the nationalist patriot conservative christian movement
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:26.120]  or does it hurt it does it repudiate globalism does it teach people to be self-sufficient does it
[2:38:26.120 --> 2:38:31.640]  trigger a giant prepping movement i think it does but will it be enough that's exactly the question
[2:38:31.640 --> 2:38:36.680]  and you hit the nail on the head every actor in this you know that wants their pound of flesh
[2:38:36.680 --> 2:38:41.160]  from this crisis and wants to advance their cause through this crisis we need to do the same thing
[2:38:41.160 --> 2:38:45.480]  we need to be pounding home the message that mike adams was saying earlier which is you know what
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:50.360]  wheat grassroots right-wingers have been right about everything all along if we would have had
[2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:54.200]  strong borders if we would have been but look at us i mean i'm not bragging none of us are but
[2:38:54.200 --> 2:38:58.600]  i mean studies show conservatives they can be black white Hispanic better looking more successful
[2:38:58.600 --> 2:39:03.960]  uh absolutely it's true we're just regular humans i know how to skin a buck run a trot line beat
[2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:10.200]  somebody's ass change oil clean the house do the roof you know change diapers run businesses
[2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:15.480]  run psych operations against the clock but that's just a normal conservative man men 50 60 hundred
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:20.120]  years ago we're almost all like us if you didn't act like this people didn't respect you if you
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:27.080]  didn't know how to get stuff done you weren't a man absolutely and so there are very fundamental
[2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:31.080]  even biological differences between right-wingers and left-wingers you pointed out one of them even
[2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:35.640]  you know the chest size of the average leftist man versus versus the average right-wing man
[2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:41.000]  you know the right-wingers have bigger chests on average so there are big differences here and
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:44.920]  then the other thing that's a big difference that could come into play in a conflict scenario is
[2:39:44.920 --> 2:39:49.480]  that most leftists if you if you just google let's just say they're cowardly chicken-neck
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:57.160]  idiot schmucks being manipulated by criminal con men yes and you know the leftist leaders the men
[2:39:57.160 --> 2:40:04.520]  are all big giant six seven psychos and you're ruling over all their little slaves it's what they
[2:40:04.520 --> 2:40:11.080]  have the left has evil alphas running them yes and we and we have on the right wing tend to be more
[2:40:11.080 --> 2:40:16.600]  like more of us are natural alphas and uh have more testosterone more common sense etc but the
[2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:20.680]  other thing is the leftists are all crammed into a few big cities alex they're all if you look at
[2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:27.960]  a 3d map of the 2 6 2016 election results um you can tell that the great majority of leftists live
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:33.560]  in a few big cities and we're seeing the disadvantages of that now with the coronavirus thing for one
[2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:38.760]  but also the world's leading fourth generation warfare expert uh said recently the same thing
[2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:43.080]  i said in one of my videos which is that they're very susceptible susceptible to fourth generation
[2:40:43.080 --> 2:40:48.040]  warfare it's a big disadvantage in any kind of act now explain that to them explain that because
[2:40:48.040 --> 2:40:53.800]  i don't want to be mean to to chicken-neck leftist okay they are schmucks they are being led around
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:40:59.240]  by their nose and again not not the front people like Pelosi and you know all then they're just
[2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:04.200]  puppets but the real globalists running it are all super psycho alpha males so i want to explain
[2:41:04.200 --> 2:41:08.600]  to the left they want to get rid of alpha males they see that as the as the problem in the world
[2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:13.560]  what what they don't get is there is psychotic alpha males controlling them yes absolutely
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:17.160]  they're never going to get rid of alpha males that's just a false promise that they think they can
[2:41:17.160 --> 2:41:21.240]  do it's never going to happen yeah this super psychotic alpha males want to get rid of the
[2:41:21.240 --> 2:41:26.040]  other alpha males that are sheep dogs the wolves want to get rid of the sheep dogs that is the
[2:41:26.040 --> 2:41:30.360]  battle it is us the alpha males on the grassroots right wing versus the alpha males that are
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:34.680]  manipulating the left now it's also interesting we're seeing even on the left like the bernie
[2:41:34.680 --> 2:41:39.080]  sanders movement it's not a very intelligent movement but it is a resistance against the
[2:41:39.080 --> 2:41:43.560]  elite they themselves don't like the elite very much either and so we've got a ground
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:48.760]  well totally walking into their trap of collectivization exactly right exactly right so my
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:54.600]  simple look at a damn map you the globalists are going to move offshore if they took the
[2:41:54.600 --> 2:42:01.000]  united states absolutely and uh you know so the main point i'm trying to make in my videos and
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:06.440]  and on this subject is the grassroots right wing is actually in a good position as this crisis
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:11.320]  breaches more and more of a head because we have a lot of these advantages we've been talking about
[2:42:13.160 --> 2:42:17.000]  well i need to get you back i've seen your videos you're a really smart guy and you do lay out the
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:21.640]  science and again i want to explain the leftist to tune in they're all about fake victories and
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:26.040]  all their weird stuff they do they're like larkers it's all fantasy land what they do
[2:42:26.040 --> 2:42:30.280]  and they're fed fantasy land stuff i don't like seeing them because i know a lot of guys
[2:42:30.280 --> 2:42:33.640]  that aren't you know big physically they're still alpha males they care they're loving
[2:42:33.640 --> 2:42:37.080]  people they're strong i don't put people that are little down but it is true statistically that
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:40.760]  people that are more successful aggressive everything are conservative because they believe
[2:42:40.760 --> 2:42:46.280]  in themselves they believe in humanity the globalists are by design making people domesticated
[2:42:46.280 --> 2:42:51.080]  little serfs that are dependent on them it's called slavery and i don't like slavery
[2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:56.440]  we'll be right back stay with us one of our best-selling products is living defense and it's
[2:42:56.440 --> 2:43:01.000]  been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic

[2:47:09.240 --> 2:47:22.120]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:47:23.960 --> 2:47:27.560]  by the way i haven't seen it yet but people are calling about it and some of the crews
[2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:31.880]  seen it it's reportedly pretty pretty horrible and a lot of this info of course without seeing
[2:47:31.880 --> 2:47:37.400]  it straight mark that's what they're known for but brian looks like a child molester stelter
[2:47:37.400 --> 2:47:41.560]  i'm saying the child molester i'm just saying he looks like what i'd put in the movie as a child
[2:47:41.560 --> 2:47:45.880]  molester that's not the really scary one i mean he looks creepy there too but put the really
[2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:50.120]  well they're all creepy all the photos are absolutely horrific there's one where he really
[2:47:50.120 --> 2:47:55.560]  turns on the goblin demon there it is that's your babysitter right there folks let's let
[2:47:55.560 --> 2:48:02.040]  him be a kindergarten teacher no i don't think so yeah no ick the clown war paint needed uh he's
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:07.880]  got an hb o documentary out attacking me the king of fake news that thought that abinani was
[2:48:07.880 --> 2:48:12.440]  going to be president he predicted that and the guy that says ratings don't matter and all his other
[2:48:12.440 --> 2:48:19.000]  bs they got a support censorship uh he uh reportedly docks is where our offices are
[2:48:20.920 --> 2:48:24.520]  but you know you you'd think they'd want to actually figure out where our offices are before
[2:48:24.520 --> 2:48:32.440]  they docks the wrong building and the wrong place where we did have our warehouse for many years
[2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:37.400]  and it's now moved another part of the city so the poor warehouse people will have people like
[2:48:37.400 --> 2:48:44.120]  grab the door and try to run into the warehouse and the the offices aren't there our broadcast
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:51.160]  transmission facilities are not at the warehouse they're miles away from the warehouse and so the
[2:48:51.160 --> 2:48:58.440]  idiots at cnn docks the old warehouse site the warehouse has been moved for three years
[2:49:00.520 --> 2:49:07.320]  good job ryan you did it again you just everything's deception just like look at this
[2:49:09.080 --> 2:49:17.960]  irresponsible cbs slammed for using coronavirus footage from italian hospital to portray new york
[2:49:17.960 --> 2:49:24.120]  city so and all these people in respirators say there's a lot of respirators and then it wasn't
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:32.120]  even true and they knew it was a lie that's up on info wars dot com unbelievable unbelievable
[2:49:33.400 --> 2:49:35.960]  that that's the type of stuff that goes on in this country
[2:49:39.720 --> 2:49:42.680]  i tell you there's 14 alex jones is in austin texas too
[2:49:42.680 --> 2:49:50.440]  and a bunch of the moron sluths online put some poor dude in north austin's house
[2:49:52.600 --> 2:49:58.120]  and then that alex jones moved out was alex e jones i'm alex e jones as well but there's
[2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:02.360]  two alex e jones as the poor guy he was in new york he'd call he got my number and obviously
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:07.240]  please tell them stop coming tell them it's not me then a state rep bought his house
[2:50:07.240 --> 2:50:13.800]  who's a republican and his office called and said can you get him to stop coming here that's not
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:20.120]  where i live in north austin i don't live in north austin but where i do live i got a gator out of
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:25.160]  my house and i got a dog and i got gugs and if you come on my property and you're a threat
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:33.800]  you're gonna be going home to see jesus but cnn has tried to quote dox info wars and they couldn't
[2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:42.200]  even get that right but i mean when you look like this creature you can't tell the truth
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:46.600]  meet your new babysitter
[2:50:49.480 --> 2:50:55.720]  this unaware demon doesn't even know what he looks like that's why they call him psychotics
[2:50:55.720 --> 2:51:05.160]  all right let's go ahead and uh go back to our guest here john mark really appreciate the point
[2:51:05.160 --> 2:51:11.880]  you're making let's uh why the left never learns and let's talk about propertarianism
[2:51:13.960 --> 2:51:18.680]  absolutely propertarianism is a solution to the problem that you mentioned earlier alex
[2:51:18.680 --> 2:51:24.280]  which is we have to defeat these people we cannot let these people do what they are trying to do
[2:51:24.280 --> 2:51:30.840]  and largely successfully doing to our civilization and this is a problem that all great civilizations
[2:51:30.840 --> 2:51:36.600]  in history have faced you look at rome for example which is you have a great civilization that
[2:51:36.600 --> 2:51:41.880]  arises it's prosperous it's it's successful and then what happens is they collapse under the weight
[2:51:41.880 --> 2:51:46.440]  of parasites because all the parasites at the elite level as you know and on the grassroots
[2:51:46.440 --> 2:51:50.600]  left level what we would call it in modern times they come along and they think oh this is a nice
[2:51:50.600 --> 2:51:56.120]  juicy you know civilization to munch on and to be a parasite on and the civilization collapses
[2:51:56.120 --> 2:52:00.760]  under the weight of the parasitism and so what none of these civilizations have had including
[2:52:00.760 --> 2:52:04.280]  america i mean because we're watching this happen right before our very eyes in america
[2:52:05.080 --> 2:52:11.000]  in real time what these civilizations haven't had is a system that is robust enough to allow
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:17.640]  the people like us to stop and not just stop but to crush the parasites so that they can't operate
[2:52:17.640 --> 2:52:21.960]  and so that's what proper terrain is and brings to the table and it's a relatively new school of
[2:52:21.960 --> 2:52:25.160]  thought which is why you hadn't heard of it and didn't know how to pronounce it but it's something
[2:52:25.160 --> 2:52:30.520]  i talk about a lot of my channel started by a tech entrepreneur named kurt do a little and really
[2:52:30.520 --> 2:52:35.320]  what it does is it basically takes the best practices of western civilization it writes them
[2:52:35.320 --> 2:52:42.600]  down very specifically thoroughly scientifically and then creates a system whereby it almost
[2:52:42.600 --> 2:52:46.680]  gets goosebumps every time i say this and there's a lot to it so i don't expect everybody to just
[2:52:46.680 --> 2:52:51.240]  buy it well just to be clear there's a lot i don't know i had read about it once or twice
[2:52:51.240 --> 2:52:55.240]  i was just reading and but yeah i wasn't familiarized with it enough to then know how to pronounce it
[2:52:55.240 --> 2:52:58.680]  when i saw it again sure sure absolutely a lot of people are learning about it right now and
[2:52:58.680 --> 2:53:03.160]  that's completely fine no problem at all but what it does is it makes it exactly it's exciting so
[2:53:03.160 --> 2:53:07.240]  tell us about it yeah a lot of people are get really excited about it people like us grassroots
[2:53:07.240 --> 2:53:12.120]  right wingers because it basically takes our instinct and it helps us to know how to enforce it
[2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:16.280]  and so it takes the best practices western civilization and it creates a system to where
[2:53:16.280 --> 2:53:22.200]  it's actually illegal to violate the best practices of western civilization and it gives the people
[2:53:22.200 --> 2:53:27.240]  the power to defend the best practices of western civilization in a way that we don't have in our
[2:53:27.240 --> 2:53:31.960]  current system that's right we don't start celebrating it we're gonna lose it it's under attack
[2:53:31.960 --> 2:53:38.600]  don't just defend it celebrate it exercise it and and and how do we defend it absolutely well
[2:53:39.560 --> 2:53:44.200]  you can't really get into too much detail in a format like this but uh there's a lot i'll just
[2:53:44.200 --> 2:53:49.320]  say it in in this manner we have what we call sometimes we call it the properitarian constitution
[2:53:49.320 --> 2:53:53.720]  or the strengthened american constitution is really just a set of amendments to the original
[2:53:53.720 --> 2:53:58.680]  american constitution that does two things number one it returns a lot of things to the way the
[2:53:58.680 --> 2:54:03.240]  original constitution had it because as you know a lot of this has been perverted for example the
[2:54:03.240 --> 2:54:09.480]  federal reserve needs to go away etc and then number two it adds several more layers of defense
[2:54:09.480 --> 2:54:15.400]  to make it so that it it's very very hard for parasites to operate and in our current system
[2:54:15.400 --> 2:54:19.640]  we're now to the point alex where even in america i mean there's a lot of good aspects we don't want
[2:54:19.640 --> 2:54:23.480]  to throw out the baby with the bathwater you know we're a first world country we've got a lot of
[2:54:23.480 --> 2:54:27.080]  good things but it's to the point now where the parasites actually have the upper hand and it's
[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:31.320]  easier for them to do what they want to do if you tolerate parasites they always organize and
[2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:36.360]  then put an authoritarianism in absolutely they i mean we've seen the pattern over and over again
[2:54:36.360 --> 2:54:40.520]  we've seen this movie before haven't we alex and so we cannot allow it to happen and what
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:44.680]  properitarianism does obviously this is not something that is going to be voted in by congress
[2:54:44.680 --> 2:54:49.080]  right because if they did they would have to stop being corrupt so this is something that would have
[2:54:49.080 --> 2:54:53.720]  to be implemented out of a crisis like this but for me it's very helpful to have something
[2:54:53.720 --> 2:54:58.120]  that i can look at and say you know what now i know what to do now we know what we need a
[2:54:58.120 --> 2:55:03.560]  countervailing system that restates why we've been so great and then and then and then puts
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:08.360]  a defense out for it and enforces it absolutely right and it's very hard for us to enforce it
[2:55:08.360 --> 2:55:12.520]  right now because of weaknesses in our system and i'm sure even your audience could come up with
[2:55:12.520 --> 2:55:16.920]  weaknesses in our system well look at trump i mean everybody's so domesticated now we'll have a
[2:55:16.920 --> 2:55:20.680]  depression right now they'll run him out of office if he didn't do this giant bailout and course
[2:55:20.680 --> 2:55:25.240]  it's got big problems i'm not even defending it but i understand the wheelhouse trump is now in
[2:55:26.440 --> 2:55:30.920]  absolutely yeah and even if you elect a guy like trump trump that's not totally owned by big
[2:55:30.920 --> 2:55:36.360]  globalist corporations it's hard for him to get anything done because the system is so it has
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:41.240]  so many holes in it that the parasites are driving driving through like a mac truck and so
[2:55:41.240 --> 2:55:46.920]  authoritarianism has basically a big it ends up being a big list of changes that would make it so
[2:55:46.920 --> 2:55:52.040]  the system is now tilted in our favor to make it much easier for the people who want to stop
[2:55:52.040 --> 2:55:56.840]  parasitism and have the the right-wing instinct like we were talking about earlier to preserve
[2:55:56.840 --> 2:56:02.040]  and advance civilization it tilts the playing field in our favor instead of the other way around so
[2:56:02.040 --> 2:56:06.040]  that's going to mark stay there do five more minutes with us and then i've got a very powerful
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:10.280]  special report we're going to premiere that greg reese did on did trump just nationalized the
[2:56:10.280 --> 2:56:15.400]  fellow reserve yes he did there's more than one way to skin the cat it's still very dangerous
[2:56:15.400 --> 2:56:19.000]  we'll talk about that at six after the robert barnes is in i don't want to finish up with our
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:23.400]  guests on the other side we'll be right back with john mark first off though before we end this hour

[2:59:04.200 --> 2:59:12.440]  four years ago then billionaire businessman donald trump pledged himself to info wars in our audience
[2:59:12.440 --> 2:59:18.120]  that he would not let us down that he would take the globalist on and that we would be very pleased
[2:59:18.120 --> 2:59:24.520]  with what he did we are pleased with president trump he has proven that he's the real deal and
[2:59:24.520 --> 2:59:30.120]  has taken the globalist on the level that before seen but now they're striking back at president
[2:59:30.120 --> 2:59:35.960]  trump and the people using the invisible weapon of fear the corona virus yes we should meet the
[2:59:35.960 --> 2:59:41.560]  virus head on yes we should save as many people as possible but not at the expense of our hard
[2:59:41.560 --> 3:00:00.360]  fought liberties and freedoms you're listening to the alex jones show back about 18 and 25 i left
[3:00:00.360 --> 3:00:08.280]  tennessee very much alive i never would have made it through the arkansas mud if i hadn't been
[3:00:08.280 --> 3:00:18.760]  riding on the tennessee stuff had some trouble with my sweethearts paw one of her brothers was
[3:00:18.760 --> 3:00:28.600]  a bad outlaw i wrote a letter to my uncle foot and i rode away on the tennessee stuff we are back
[3:00:28.600 --> 3:00:36.040]  live the tennessee stuff very special report the color of the sun and his eyes at the start of the
[3:00:36.040 --> 3:00:42.120]  next segment will also have barns with us as well with this report on the private run for profit
[3:00:42.120 --> 3:00:46.600]  federal reserve and what trump just did is beyond critical so look for that the start of the next
[3:00:46.600 --> 3:00:52.920]  segment with greg rees finishing up john mark and what you're talking about with proper terrianism
[3:00:54.200 --> 3:01:01.400]  give us some more facets of that absolutely uh i'll just give you a couple examples of the fixes
[3:01:01.400 --> 3:01:05.000]  that it puts in because a lot of times what people are curious about is you know they understand
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:08.840]  going back to the original constitution and undoing some of the mistakes that have been made
[3:01:08.840 --> 3:01:12.760]  since then and then they say okay what are these extra layers of protection that you're putting
[3:01:12.760 --> 3:01:17.640]  in so i'll just give a couple of you know one or two examples one is we know we have a big problem
[3:01:17.640 --> 3:01:22.920]  for example with leftist activist judges they think they can interpret the constitution however
[3:01:22.920 --> 3:01:28.120]  they want um and the reason we have that problem or the core reason we have that problem is because
[3:01:28.120 --> 3:01:32.840]  the original founding fathers did not put an extremely clear ultra clear jurisprudence in
[3:01:32.840 --> 3:01:38.440]  the constitution to say this is how you must interpret it and so now we actually have four
[3:01:38.440 --> 3:01:42.520]  schools of thought and a big debate about how do you interpret the constitution and of course you
[3:01:42.520 --> 3:01:45.800]  and i are sitting here thinking just like the founding fathers probably did why would you
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:50.440]  interpret any other way than strictly so this is something where you know the founding fathers
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:56.520]  just didn't really foresee it they did a great job so how do we fix you mean literal yeah literally
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:02:02.040]  yes and so what proper terrianism does is it it makes it very clear it just has another amendment
[3:02:02.040 --> 3:02:08.920]  to add in that says okay listen if you're a judge uh you must follow this particular juris jurisprudence
[3:02:08.920 --> 3:02:13.480]  these particular rules about how jefferson said they had to and not twisted into whatever bizarre
[3:02:13.480 --> 3:02:17.720]  meaning they wanted correct and so a lot of this is enforcement too i mean we need to enforce these
[3:02:17.720 --> 3:02:21.880]  things it's not just writing down let me tell you something uh the experience i've had with
[3:02:21.880 --> 3:02:29.640]  these federal judges so far is though the federal law saying you can't sue somebody uh if and state
[3:02:29.640 --> 3:02:33.880]  law if you haven't said their name and they've had the local circuit court say we don't care
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:39.080]  law suit goes forward even people sue me let me say their name they sue me don't even show their
[3:02:39.080 --> 3:02:45.080]  picture they sue me yes and so we have a big problem with this as you know and this is a
[3:02:45.080 --> 3:02:48.440]  sometimes when people get into proper terrianism start learning about it they realize this is a
[3:02:48.440 --> 3:02:53.240]  very rule of law based solution because if we don't have our rule of law right and if we don't have
[3:02:53.240 --> 3:02:57.640]  very strict rules around these things and enforce it i mean that's the very basis of civilization
[3:02:57.640 --> 3:03:02.200]  if we can't even rely on our rule of law to be fair and just and interpret things correctly
[3:03:02.200 --> 3:03:06.200]  we don't even have civilization alec well that's right not in germany's enforcement arm was a
[3:03:06.200 --> 3:03:12.120]  bunch of puppet judges so judicial tyranny is always a real threat exactly and we have to have
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:16.920]  rules and this is a very key feature of proper terrianism i'll just close with close with this
[3:03:16.920 --> 3:03:21.160]  which is that all of this is based on empirical observation none of this is arbitrary that we
[3:03:21.160 --> 3:03:26.120]  have in proper terrianism it's all based on scientific observation of how humans operate and
[3:03:26.120 --> 3:03:31.720]  cooperate and why they fight and all of this and so it's the ultimate system to remove arbitrary
[3:03:31.720 --> 3:03:36.120]  decision making and of course it requires enforcement but it's very helpful to have these
[3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:41.000]  things written down and rules that are very very clear and taking it to the next level
[3:03:41.480 --> 3:03:46.440]  in that regard well i want to invite you back sometime maybe do a special report you know an
[3:03:46.440 --> 3:03:50.920]  hour report or something for us will air here you put on your youtube course where you lay it out
[3:03:50.920 --> 3:03:54.520]  out i know you lay a lot of it out on your channel that's very very exciting and i should look more
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:58.120]  into that i've seen that term i've read about it i've seen people talking about it i kind of
[3:03:58.120 --> 3:04:02.120]  see the definition of it but this is the most i've delved into it it just seems like another
[3:04:02.120 --> 3:04:06.920]  school of thought for common sense scientific approach to liberty and defend their own scientific
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:12.120]  formulas that produce the best in most stable societies absolutely right would love to come
[3:04:12.120 --> 3:04:16.520]  back alex thanks so much for having me all right the best places for people to find you john mark

[3:04:37.640 --> 3:04:42.280]  dangerous and now they're banning presidents of major countries like brazil for saying hydroxy
[3:04:42.280 --> 3:04:47.000]  quark when it is great in trials which is admitted now the FDA just approved it so egg on their face
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:53.160]  thank you john mark key report on the federal reserve did trump just nationalize it and i'm

[3:06:15.640 --> 3:06:23.080]  nation's money and i care not who makes the laws in a recent bloomberg article the feds cure
[3:06:23.080 --> 3:06:28.760]  risks being worse than the disease jim bianco explains what is now happening with the federal
[3:06:28.760 --> 3:06:35.400]  reserve bank in their response to the corona virus he writes this scheme essentially merges the fed
[3:06:35.400 --> 3:06:43.240]  and treasury into one organization so meet your new fed chairman donald j trump did president trump
[3:06:43.240 --> 3:06:51.240]  just nationalize the federal reserve bank on june 4th 1963 president john f kennedy
[3:06:51.240 --> 3:06:58.200]  issued executive order 1111 zero which many believed was an effort to transfer power from
[3:06:58.200 --> 3:07:03.720]  the federal reserve bank to the united states department of the treasury by replacing federal
[3:07:03.720 --> 3:07:09.480]  reserve notes with silver certificates thereby taking the power away from the international
[3:07:09.480 --> 3:07:16.840]  banking cartels less than six months later president kennedy was assassinated and his move
[3:07:16.840 --> 3:07:23.720]  against the fed was reversed during the civil war president abraham lincoln printed four hundred
[3:07:23.720 --> 3:07:30.520]  million dollars worth of greenbacks a debt free interest free money independent of international
[3:07:30.520 --> 3:07:38.440]  bank control in response the london times wrote that if that mischievous financial policy which
[3:07:38.440 --> 3:07:45.000]  had its origin in the north american republic should become indurated down to a fixture then
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:51.880]  that government will furnish its own money without cost it will pay off debts and be without debt
[3:07:51.880 --> 3:07:57.560]  it will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce it will become prosperous beyond
[3:07:57.560 --> 3:08:02.920]  precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world the brains and the wealth of all
[3:08:02.920 --> 3:08:10.680]  countries will go to north america that government must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy
[3:08:10.680 --> 3:08:17.560]  on the globe the bankers were not willing to lose power and the bank of england went on to fund
[3:08:17.560 --> 3:08:26.120]  the confederacy weeks prior to lincoln's assassination assassin john wilkes booth spent time in montreal
[3:08:26.120 --> 3:08:33.640]  hall known as the confederate capital of canada and was found after the assassination with a bank
[3:08:33.640 --> 3:08:43.080]  note from ontario bank booth's personal manager was banker joseph seamans after lincoln was killed
[3:08:43.080 --> 3:08:51.400]  power was restored to the international banking cartel the national economic security and recovery
[3:08:51.400 --> 3:09:00.280]  act known as nasara was a set proposed economic reforms suggested during the 1990s by harvey
[3:09:00.280 --> 3:09:08.120]  francis bernard bernard created the nasara proposal during the late 1980s he sent copies to members
[3:09:08.120 --> 3:09:16.120]  of congress but was ignored in 2001 he established the nasara institute and published the second
[3:09:16.120 --> 3:09:24.440]  edition of his book in 2005 retitling it draining the swamp the nasara story monetary and fiscal
[3:09:24.440 --> 3:09:31.960]  policy reform the policies included replacing the income tax with a national sales tax abolishing
[3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:39.320]  compound interest on secured loans and returning to a bi-metallic currency which he claimed would
[3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:46.200]  result in zero percent inflation and a more stable economy there is a big buzz on the internet
[3:09:46.200 --> 3:09:53.000]  that president trump is implementing this plan there is also speculation that this is part of
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:10:00.360]  a huge global economic reset guess sara to be decided at the international world court of the
[3:10:00.360 --> 3:10:07.320]  haig if this is true certainly this decision has been decided years ago and we are just now
[3:10:07.320 --> 3:10:13.800]  feeling the effects the coronavirus scare is beginning to look like a false alarm but the
[3:10:13.800 --> 3:10:20.520]  reaction is looking just like a false flag and it seems that when we come out the other end of this
[3:10:20.520 --> 3:10:42.360]  the world will be different for info wars calm this is greg rees info tomorrow's news today well
[3:10:42.360 --> 3:10:48.360]  robert barnes famous constitutional lawyer is here with us in studio and i was looking at all
[3:10:48.360 --> 3:10:53.240]  his great tweets and his comments and already wanted him to do a segment on my show so i said to
[3:10:53.240 --> 3:10:58.760]  him this last week i said why don't you just come here you're not scared of the coronavirus and do
[3:10:58.760 --> 3:11:03.080]  maybe a show for a month two months however long we came up with a name for it we could kind of
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:07.080]  clicked so we'll tell you about that at the bottom of the hour it starts the night seven o'clock
[3:11:07.080 --> 3:11:13.560]  central eight o'clock eastern that's uh five o'clock pacific six o'clock mountain and it'll
[3:11:13.560 --> 3:11:16.920]  be on the radio satellites the tv satellites for any stations that want to pick it up out there
[3:11:16.920 --> 3:11:22.040]  it's just a free to air any stations just pick it up and and and we don't have any network ads
[3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:26.360]  and we've got all our ads out you get a couple minutes at the start and about four minutes
[3:11:26.360 --> 3:11:31.960]  at the bottom of the hour for your local stations you can feel free to override any of it anytime
[3:11:31.960 --> 3:11:35.560]  you wish as well it's totally free to air so if you want to take one segment of it every night
[3:11:36.120 --> 3:11:40.920]  you know and put ads other places or just cut overs i don't care what you do it's free to air
[3:11:40.920 --> 3:11:45.960]  so is my broadcast okay but i wanted to hit this with you because you're quite the student of history
[3:11:45.960 --> 3:11:49.400]  constitution even more so than lawyer because i've done quite a bit of research and you know
[3:11:49.400 --> 3:11:55.320]  what you're talking about you're not a bs or um last week he didn't get hardly any attention
[3:11:56.200 --> 3:12:01.800]  trump came in and he said okay four trillion dollars in stimulus two trillion from the treasury
[3:12:01.800 --> 3:12:07.080]  two trillion from uh the private run for private federal reserve but then when i zoomed in more on
[3:12:07.080 --> 3:12:11.480]  it and looked at the actual statement it's the treasury directing so it's always been the private
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:17.240]  federal reserve for 107 years since 1913 that took control of the power of the purse from the
[3:12:17.240 --> 3:12:21.560]  constitution so we always thought of abolishing the federal reserve as the way to get rid of it
[3:12:21.560 --> 3:12:26.040]  it goes back under treasury and that is the congress that's supposed to do that the president
[3:12:26.040 --> 3:12:30.840]  can sign or veto those bills so a lot of folks are saying oh trump has the federal reserve
[3:12:32.200 --> 3:12:38.120]  taking over uh no he actually did take it over under the treasury the problem is
[3:12:38.120 --> 3:12:43.480]  is that the president has the power over the federal reserve in the federal reserve act the
[3:12:43.480 --> 3:12:48.840]  only part of the the country that does which is really a user patient of the power of the purse
[3:12:48.840 --> 3:12:52.680]  of congress so by the president taking control of the federal reserve he's taking control of the
[3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:56.840]  power of the purse we can play clips of ellen greenspan saying the only role of the federal
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:13:00.760]  reserve is that the government has the federal reserve is nothing we're our own branch of
[3:13:00.760 --> 3:13:04.680]  government well that's a dictatorship of the federal reserve so i like it under the president
[3:13:04.680 --> 3:13:09.560]  but that's not in the constitution it says all bills of raising revenues shall originate in the
[3:13:09.560 --> 3:13:15.800]  house representatives but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as the bills u.s constitution
[3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:19.480]  article one section seven clause one there's another part of constitution article one section
[3:13:19.480 --> 3:13:25.640]  nine clause seven no money shall be drawn from the treasury but by the consequences of appropriations
[3:13:25.640 --> 3:13:31.800]  made by law and a regular statement of account of the receipts of expenditures of all public money
[3:13:31.800 --> 3:13:37.000]  shall be published from time to time well the federal reserve never even been audited as we know
[3:13:37.800 --> 3:13:43.240]  so this is big this is not the federal reserve taking over and even bloomberg's pissed and the
[3:13:43.240 --> 3:13:51.720]  left's pissed meet the new boss the fed president trump the fed's cure risk worse than the disease
[3:13:51.720 --> 3:13:57.640]  bloomberg they hate it they say he now has federalized the federal reserve federal reserve
[3:13:57.640 --> 3:14:01.800]  chairman donald trump potas could save america that's a killing it bringing four wars dot com article
[3:14:02.440 --> 3:14:08.360]  bob what do you make of this so it's only as to those funds so the essentially that part of the
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:14.680]  stimulus package or a relief package the that part that part those funds the president has
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:20.360]  some control over because he wanted to what and congress did pass it yes exactly the bigger issue
[3:14:20.360 --> 3:14:26.120]  is this is probably the first step towards mmt so it's modern monetary theory and the idea basically
[3:14:26.120 --> 3:14:31.240]  is you can print your way out of any problem that if the state controls its own currency it can
[3:14:31.240 --> 3:14:36.680]  effectively control the economy just by printing and that's what lincoln thought and there's
[3:14:36.680 --> 3:14:41.400]  different people who brought it up and it originated within its most recent incarnation as a more
[3:14:41.400 --> 3:14:46.920]  left-leaning doctrine the criticism of it was always why won't inflation result from that
[3:14:46.920 --> 3:14:51.400]  and the premise was that it will create enough economic activity to match the amount of money
[3:14:51.400 --> 3:14:55.880]  printed the problems that's not what's happening now there's no there's a supply side shock to the
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:15:01.640]  system but trump has often been a fan of the idea of mmt because of the power that it provides
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:06.680]  and that's why he incorporated a smaller portion of it what people don't know is
[3:15:06.680 --> 3:15:12.360]  that while this is happening on the fiscal side the fed has committed to printing as much as 12
[3:15:12.360 --> 3:15:18.280]  trillion dollars over the next month separately and on top of this and do they get interest on
[3:15:18.280 --> 3:15:21.560]  that because trump's saying a lot of it will be interest free all of it will be interest free so
[3:15:21.560 --> 3:15:25.080]  well what the fed is going to be doing is they're going to be bailing out selective industries
[3:15:25.080 --> 3:15:29.320]  bailing out the corporate bond market which relates to the pension fund crisis that's going to
[3:15:29.320 --> 3:15:35.640]  could collapse overnight if if certain if certain confidence but as you see he knows a lot so when
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:41.000]  we come back we're going to look at what's really going on not behind with robert barnes who is really
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:45.400]  up on all of this well as did trump have to do this because we're under chi-com battle attack
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:49.160]  people say oh this is not physically conservative well if you want a great depression folks then
[3:15:49.160 --> 3:15:53.560]  don't do this i get that it's over the slippery slope hi i'm dan pillow i started fighting the

[3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:26.600]  we are back live constitutional lawyer and historian robert barnes is here with us
[3:20:27.480 --> 3:20:31.720]  lay out the power of the purse because i was doing the different arguments did he nationalize the
[3:20:31.720 --> 3:20:36.840]  fed the overstep congress power of the purse no they passed this and then the president is then
[3:20:36.840 --> 3:20:41.400]  able to execute it because he does have power over the fellow reserve congress passed that law
[3:20:42.200 --> 3:20:48.840]  december 23rd 1913 so this is actually all being done by the letter of the law but is it the spirit
[3:20:48.840 --> 3:20:54.600]  of the law and as you said what will be the inflationary results from this or is the stalling
[3:20:54.600 --> 3:21:01.320]  of the economy and the and the lowering of fuel prices gas prices is that enough to offset the
[3:21:01.320 --> 3:21:06.920]  inflationary spiral of as you said 1415 trillion dollars in the aggregate i mean really it was
[3:21:06.920 --> 3:21:11.640]  sort of a means shifting issue in other words what they did is rather than go from rather than
[3:21:11.640 --> 3:21:16.520]  issue debt to fund the deficit they're basically allowing the fed to print cash that's put under
[3:21:16.520 --> 3:21:21.720]  trump's control so part of the fed has been effectively nationalized but only that part
[3:21:21.720 --> 3:21:25.560]  that governs that amount of money they did it correctly from a constitutional perspective in
[3:21:25.560 --> 3:21:29.800]  the sense that congress passed the authorization for him to do so that he could appropriate certain
[3:21:29.800 --> 3:21:33.320]  money from the fed under the guidance and governance of the president i gotta say i don't
[3:21:33.320 --> 3:21:37.160]  like the giant amounts of money i get it i mean we were in a different situation with a defibrillator
[3:21:37.880 --> 3:21:42.680]  but i like the president taking over the fed i mean i like the beginning of that the the question
[3:21:42.680 --> 3:21:50.040]  is where that ends up so i mean the the risk factor is that if this embraces mmt modern monetary
[3:21:50.040 --> 3:21:56.920]  theory completely the left wants to use that to spend wild amounts of money on a wild number of
[3:21:56.920 --> 3:22:03.800]  policies and the big historical question with mmt has always been why won't we have a major inflation
[3:22:03.800 --> 3:22:08.680]  problem so if you go back and look other governments have tried variations of this by mark germany in
[3:22:08.680 --> 3:22:14.360]  the 1920s to get out of their problems tried to inflate their currency hungry in 1946 again
[3:22:14.360 --> 3:22:22.040]  later argentina in the 1990s and then of course zimbabwe in the 2006 2008 time period and in the
[3:22:22.040 --> 3:22:27.160]  zimbabwe example and of course venezuela within the last two years well if you look at the zimbabwe
[3:22:27.160 --> 3:22:32.360]  example i mean they ended up printing one trillion dollar bills because of how bad the inflation
[3:22:32.360 --> 3:22:37.160]  became so the question has always been can you just print money to solve a problem as a friend of
[3:22:37.160 --> 3:22:42.520]  mine pointed out if printing money could solve problems the soviet union would still exist
[3:22:42.520 --> 3:22:49.320]  writing checks by itself without corresponding economic activity has never worked so the i
[3:22:49.320 --> 3:22:55.560]  understand the president wanting to explore mmt and because of its ability to remediate the severe
[3:22:55.560 --> 3:23:01.400]  economic impacts of a shutdown the question is what is its long-term consequences once we start
[3:23:01.400 --> 3:23:07.320]  employing it for him does the next president say i want some mmt and i want eight trillion
[3:23:07.320 --> 3:23:12.600]  dollars or i want 12 trillion dollars or i want 14 trillion dollars so i think that's the that's
[3:23:12.600 --> 3:23:17.960]  the risk factor and it's a huge gamble how mmt works if it backfires it can collapse an economy
[3:23:17.960 --> 3:23:23.720]  overnight just as venezuela today venezuelan problem isn't really socialism so much its
[3:23:23.720 --> 3:23:27.800]  problem is its currency management in light of the way they were running and that was a policy
[3:23:27.800 --> 3:23:34.120]  and that was an incredibly successful economy and an incredibly rich nation for folks that don't
[3:23:34.120 --> 3:23:39.080]  know is richer than the us at one time run down the rat hole by socialists in just a few decades
[3:23:39.080 --> 3:23:45.720]  let's talk about history um they tried to kill jackson he tried to have the us bank and and
[3:23:45.720 --> 3:23:53.880]  use the mmt in a older fashion and then they tried to kill him at least four times by providence he
[3:23:53.880 --> 3:23:58.200]  lived uh there was another president they shot and killed over it and then of course we then see
[3:23:59.080 --> 3:24:03.960]  lincoln got shot in the back of the head for doing and he issued uh 40 something million was going
[3:24:03.960 --> 3:24:10.440]  to issue 400 million then jfk was able to reissue the same original currency that never been withdrawn
[3:24:11.240 --> 3:24:15.560]  in the link and five dollar bills and a nod to him and that of course was executive order
[3:24:15.560 --> 3:24:23.320]  one one one one zero and let's show folks for tv viewers the five dollar bill to type in a jfk five
[3:24:23.320 --> 3:24:29.560]  dollar bill and if you notice it doesn't say fellow reserve note it says us treasury note
[3:24:29.560 --> 3:24:34.280]  ladies and gentlemen so that's an example of what we're talking about both men were executed by
[3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:39.320]  being shot in the head will trump follow the same path well i think the certain aspects are
[3:24:39.320 --> 3:24:44.200]  right now for the most part trump is while he's asserted control over this portion of the fed
[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:48.440]  really was just a way of giving him money without going through the us debt markets
[3:24:48.440 --> 3:24:53.400]  because the rest of the fed is still unchecked so the fed for example what people don't know this
[3:24:53.400 --> 3:24:57.880]  that in the overnight repo markets which is where you have a lot of debt exchanged which help fund
[3:24:57.880 --> 3:25:02.280]  corporate debt which they need cash every day basically or they run out of business to avoid
[3:25:02.280 --> 3:25:08.120]  the credit crunch that happened in 2008 that sunk the economy for half a decade the they are pouring
[3:25:08.120 --> 3:25:13.160]  in cash so this is like a heroin habit it only gets bigger no doubt about i mean to give you an idea
[3:25:13.160 --> 3:25:19.000]  they spent they spent over one trillion dollars in the last week and a half it took them all of 2008
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:24.520]  and 2009 to spend four trillion the fed they they are anticipating they've committed to adding
[3:25:24.520 --> 3:25:28.280]  currently their balance sheet has been stayed around four trillion it's already now up to five
[3:25:28.280 --> 3:25:32.600]  and a half trillion highest it's ever been and they're and they said they've committed to adding
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:38.760]  eleven trillion more over the next month and a half let me ask you what what what what could
[3:25:38.760 --> 3:25:43.640]  have trump done other than this with the media trying to plunge the market with them blaming him uh
[3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:47.160]  i mean i don't like where this is going but i also wouldn't want a total depression we'd already
[3:25:47.160 --> 3:25:53.160]  been one i think in my view was that his original instinct his initial instinct which was to reopen
[3:25:53.160 --> 3:25:58.760]  the economy as quickly as possible and mitigate the necessity of these extreme means and uh these
[3:25:58.760 --> 3:26:03.720]  extreme experiments with finances was the right one but the problem is the put he has everyone
[3:26:03.720 --> 3:26:07.880]  around him opposes him i mean does anyone doubt that even the health officials that i think otherwise
[3:26:07.880 --> 3:26:13.240]  mean well vote israeli clinton in 2016 admit they did exactly did exactly so the problem is he has
[3:26:13.240 --> 3:26:18.440]  no allies around him and there's got a bunch of dc followers that most of them aren't even evil as
[3:26:18.440 --> 3:26:22.520]  you know right at the top they're just a bunch of jellyfish exactly there are people that do not have
[3:26:22.520 --> 3:26:27.400]  any sort of backbone any sort of core independence we've had a culture of complicity of that has
[3:26:27.400 --> 3:26:31.560]  been corrupted within the academia and the intellectual complying with the most corrupt
[3:26:31.560 --> 3:26:35.400]  exactly with world because they come after you people go man alex they're coming after you
[3:26:35.400 --> 3:26:40.840]  well listen somebody had to do it and literally it comes down to that why'd you do it somebody had
[3:26:40.840 --> 3:26:45.720]  to i mean seriously you can't just not stand up to this is a recipe for disaster well i mean to
[3:26:45.720 --> 3:26:50.200]  give people a context we have never experienced in our entire country's history what's happening
[3:26:50.200 --> 3:26:54.920]  right now we've never had whole cities put under house arrest for months on end that's never happened
[3:26:54.920 --> 3:26:59.800]  that that is happening now 70 percent of americans today live under house arrest under terms that are
[3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:04.680]  harsher than most criminals experience under house and notice the rockefeller foundation
[3:27:04.680 --> 3:27:11.400]  10 years ago in a document called lockstep said this is the way to go but it's amazing what terrorism
[3:27:11.400 --> 3:27:17.160]  couldn't produce if fear for an enemies couldn't produce fear of communism couldn't produce it turns
[3:27:17.160 --> 3:27:23.400]  out the word virus can produce a completely docile compliant and now we're going to see more
[3:27:24.120 --> 3:27:29.640]  a novel virus has come along why not god knows who anybody can cook these up and then the whole
[3:27:29.640 --> 3:27:33.880]  world comes to its knees well look at this here they've been able to whether they did deliberately
[3:27:33.880 --> 3:27:38.440]  or not the lesson that they've learned from this is that here they've had a virus that hasn't even
[3:27:38.440 --> 3:27:42.840]  killed many people in the united states at this stage has not caused the hospitalization crisis
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:48.760]  to date that was predicted or forecast and yet they've got this massive public docile compliance
[3:27:48.760 --> 3:27:54.120]  with extreme with violating every constitutional liberty that exists to where you need papers
[3:27:54.120 --> 3:27:58.520]  to go outside of your home you need papers to go through the airport and don't worry they have
[3:27:58.520 --> 3:28:02.600]  all this work from home stuff that just rolled out a few months ago and they've got all these

[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:11.160]  and oh but it's for the greater good so if it saves one life we've got to do it and ultimately it's
[3:28:11.160 --> 3:28:15.400]  going to result in something like a vaccine chip that's going to be the new excuse for the chip i mean
[3:28:15.400 --> 3:28:19.800]  before it was track your kids you don't want your kid to get lost i'll put a little chip in them now

[3:33:22.040 --> 3:33:25.800]  so you heard Barnes Robert Barnes a well-known very intelligent
[3:33:25.800 --> 3:33:31.320]  lawyer and a lot of work for us you heard him lay out beautifully what's going on the monetary system
[3:33:31.320 --> 3:33:38.360]  just from a very pragmatic historical perspective
[3:33:39.240 --> 3:33:43.320]  and that's why i'm like this guy needs a show so he's gonna do it for a month maybe longer
[3:33:44.920 --> 3:33:47.720]  and he's here in austin and we're gonna call it

[3:33:58.200 --> 3:34:03.880]  his ideas america fights back and he's gonna have legal segments everything and then if he likes it

[3:34:08.520 --> 3:34:12.600]  those other ones are pretty damn boring and we got the stations ready to pick it up and again
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:16.680]  it's going to be his own show it'll be produced out of here but it's it's a it's his own program

[3:34:35.560 --> 3:34:39.240]  video for now we're gonna be going to build it up after that uh no videos there yet but this
[3:34:39.240 --> 3:34:42.920]  interview will be the first one posted the show tonight will be a live feed there and then pieces
[3:34:42.920 --> 3:34:48.840]  have it posted there and then for you to share out it'll be titled american countdown dot news
[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:53.800]  so barnes tell me about your ideas for the show well the idea is that this pandemic panic has
[3:34:53.800 --> 3:35:00.440]  created substantial unprecedented constitutional issues unprecedented economic risks unprecedented
[3:35:00.440 --> 3:35:05.960]  risks to the entire idea of america as a civil society as a constitutional republic as a as a
[3:35:05.960 --> 3:35:11.160]  free enterprise system all of these are under attack in ways they have never been in america's
[3:35:11.160 --> 3:35:17.000]  history the today in america about 70 of the country now lives under house arrest under
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:22.440]  terms that are harsher and meaner than they would be for most criminals and while people are being
[3:35:22.440 --> 3:35:27.080]  threatened with jail and prison because they're holding church services or because they want to
[3:35:27.080 --> 3:35:31.560]  do a political rally or because they want to be able to purchase a gun for their own defense
[3:35:31.560 --> 3:35:35.480]  or because they don't want to have their privacy invaded or because they simply want to practice
[3:35:35.480 --> 3:35:40.920]  their profession or occupation of their choice meanwhile people that are actual criminals
[3:35:40.920 --> 3:35:46.680]  including sex offenders are being systematically released from jails in prisons while police
[3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:52.200]  are issuing stand-down orders that they're publicizing to the world for almost all kinds of
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:58.200]  crimes this is a dystopian country that not even escaped to from new york or escaped from la or
[3:35:58.200 --> 3:36:03.880]  some of the most uh uh sort of apocalyptic films could have foreshadowed and by the way is that
[3:36:03.880 --> 3:36:08.920]  rodney howard brown our good friend that got arrested in tampa it appears so
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:15.560]  wow you get that i want to play that newscast a minute guys wow it's getting crazy i mean they
[3:36:15.560 --> 3:36:20.440]  they were actually threatening with going into his church service and arresting him and maybe
[3:36:20.440 --> 3:36:25.080]  everybody in hey in new york they're saying to synagogues and churches you'll never open again
[3:36:25.080 --> 3:36:29.480]  do you have to say it may be permanent this is the soviet union i i have a client in another
[3:36:29.480 --> 3:36:33.160]  place who wants to stay anonymous for the time being but just because they held a church service
[3:36:33.160 --> 3:36:38.440]  which the police recognized was legal because the the constitution required it the local community
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:43.240]  is trying to dox every member of them the local community is threatening to burn down their houses
[3:36:43.240 --> 3:36:47.560]  burn down their churches commit arson against them commit violence against them threatening to
[3:36:47.560 --> 3:36:54.200]  make this is the malice style revolution packaged by china launched against us the media helping it
[3:36:54.200 --> 3:36:57.640]  uh you know that's the whole malice system is to get grassroots hysteria going absolutely
[3:36:57.640 --> 3:37:01.720]  gut level i mean they admit the things manufactured major universities what do you think's really
[3:37:01.720 --> 3:37:07.160]  behind this i i think all the evidence shows by design it's uh the only argument against that
[3:37:07.160 --> 3:37:11.960]  the argument for the design part would be the consequences on the west not necessarily the
[3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:15.640]  the argument against design would be what happened within china the china would never
[3:37:15.640 --> 3:37:21.240]  quarantine their own population and they wouldn't risk the economic impact that would have deliberately
[3:37:21.240 --> 3:37:25.800]  or intentionally now of course there's always possibilities that there's always been carelessness
[3:37:25.800 --> 3:37:30.280]  with the way they have handled certain bio research in the past keeping the things that
[3:37:30.280 --> 3:37:35.400]  in and so regardless of the whole bio weapons bio research bio defense complex that keeps
[3:37:35.400 --> 3:37:40.520]  creating this and sharing it and the elephant in the room is that top universities from india to
[3:37:40.520 --> 3:37:44.280]  germany do you name it looked at it said it's man made the yeah there are people who believe it's
[3:37:44.280 --> 3:37:49.480]  man made there are people who believe uh it was released from a bio agency there's people who believe
[3:37:49.480 --> 3:37:54.680]  it's entirely biologically created whatever the circumstances were absolutely created the the
[3:37:54.680 --> 3:38:01.240]  way the state has reacted across the west is the real threat that once the politicians started
[3:38:01.240 --> 3:38:07.000]  using this pandemic as a pretext to steal constitutional liberties from people in a way
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:12.040]  that has never happened in the history of our republic and to restructure the economy with
[3:38:12.040 --> 3:38:18.920]  wall street bailouts in ways that were supposed to stop after 2009 while at the same time the data
[3:38:18.920 --> 3:38:24.680]  underneath the virus shows it to be more panic than plague uh when the in terms of what's happened
[3:38:24.680 --> 3:38:28.760]  and what that's why you have cbs doing fake news stories and pretending that italian news
[3:38:28.760 --> 3:38:34.280]  coverage is actually new york news coverage to create as much fear as possible and the pastor
[3:38:34.280 --> 3:38:38.360]  rodney howard brown a great patriot in front of the show he points out that everything else can
[3:38:38.360 --> 3:38:43.160]  stay open wallmark can stay open target still better put a church of god can't and by the way
[3:38:43.160 --> 3:38:48.680]  i want to point this out we did a big article four days ago dhs gun shops manufacturers essential
[3:38:48.680 --> 3:38:54.440]  under new guidelines we reported four days ago covet alert feds abolish second amendment by proxy
[3:38:54.440 --> 3:39:00.920]  in 2007 now it's in action well dhs responded to that and said no gun shops manufacturers are
[3:39:00.920 --> 3:39:06.040]  essential under new guidelines and many judges have said in other areas churches and other places
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:13.640]  are essential this is bs and again i was banned on google app for saying hydroxy chloroquine has
[3:39:13.640 --> 3:39:18.600]  been great in studies in europe i was quoting trump and fauci but even if i was wrong i'd like to say
[3:39:18.600 --> 3:39:24.760]  that they said that i was also banned uh because i was saying that this is authoritarian and they're
[3:39:24.760 --> 3:39:29.160]  using it to take control of the wall street journal had a headline uh coronavirus and
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:34.840]  autocrats never let pandemic go to waste i mean i said just mainline true stuff and i'm banned for
[3:39:34.840 --> 3:39:39.880]  that because it's so true and now the FDA said to come out and say okay everybody can use it
[3:39:39.880 --> 3:39:46.440]  it is a good treatment egg on their face will my site be restored will they give us back the app
[3:39:46.440 --> 3:39:50.760]  we paid for and they accepted that had five stars well look at what's happening in europe if you look
[3:39:50.760 --> 3:39:56.040]  at what's happening in parts of europe they are making quote-unquote misinformation a crime now
[3:39:56.040 --> 3:40:00.760]  particularly if it concerns the who defines that exactly that's going to be politicians deciding
[3:40:00.760 --> 3:40:04.440]  that just like they're the one this is the end of the first amendment that we let this stand absolutely
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:08.840]  what should have been in the essential category is any constitutionally protected activity period
[3:40:08.840 --> 3:40:12.520]  that if you're doing first amendment activity that's essential if you're doing second amendment
[3:40:12.520 --> 3:40:16.440]  activity that's essential i mean if people want to congregate for i mean this is the time to be able
[3:40:16.440 --> 3:40:21.080]  to congregate absolutely since when is the first amendment ever been neutralized in 250 years never
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:26.200]  till now well i'm getting all kinds of emails and calls about people who can't circulate petitions to
[3:40:26.200 --> 3:40:29.960]  get on the ballot can't circulate petitions for recall like they want to do of the governor of
[3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:35.800]  nevada for his order it's a political lockdown absolutely it's a complete right out exactly
[3:40:35.800 --> 3:40:40.040]  we have never had this degree of suspension of civil constitutional liberties in the history
[3:40:40.040 --> 3:40:45.000]  of the country and it's not like our founders were unfamiliar with the idea of plague or viruses
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:48.760]  they were much more intimate my god they had stuff back did them kill 10 percent of the population
[3:40:48.760 --> 3:40:53.400]  exactly and yet you read the constitution there's nothing in there that says you can suspend this
[3:40:53.400 --> 3:40:58.360]  in case of a virus you can suspend this in case of a public health crisis the pox exactly none of
[3:40:58.360 --> 3:41:04.520]  that why because that was never that was never going to be a justification or an excuse for this
[3:41:04.520 --> 3:41:10.760]  kind of violation listen exactly it's the nanny state 15 years ago 20 years ago now they banned
[3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:14.680]  dodgeball and a few left hysteria now it's banned everywhere then they banned volleyball then they
[3:41:14.680 --> 3:41:21.240]  started banning running at break time you might get hurt this is getting rid of diving boards
[3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:25.240]  getting rid of pools that are deep because somebody might get down the bottom you don't see him i mean
[3:41:25.240 --> 3:41:29.400]  now they're trying to ban people in california hiking as you might get hurt i mean literally
[3:41:29.400 --> 3:41:33.800]  this is a total takeover of civilization and no doubt i mean people are scared to leave their own
[3:41:33.800 --> 3:41:37.960]  home and if they do leave their own home their own neighbors are going to wrap them out i told
[3:41:37.960 --> 3:41:43.160]  people that it's very much like a cuban society cuban and cuban does a great job of life expectancy
[3:41:43.160 --> 3:41:51.000]  it's just 78 years of misery so the i think most americans would rather have 77 great years than 78
[3:41:51.000 --> 3:41:56.120]  miserable exactly and again eisenhower said i can give you total security i'll lock your ass in

[3:45:55.400 --> 3:46:01.000]  virus is deadly and does kill people and so do many other countless viruses that have already
[3:46:01.000 --> 3:46:09.400]  existed that do exist and will exist but when trump says the cure is worse than disease he's
[3:46:09.400 --> 3:46:17.000]  talking about the media hype creating hysteria and trying to create uncertainty and it is that
[3:46:17.560 --> 3:46:25.720]  that I oppose it is not the american way to cower and live in fear and to follow the edicts and
[3:46:25.720 --> 3:46:32.040]  precedents set by communist china and hyper authoritarian singapore where you're now being
[3:46:32.040 --> 3:46:39.320]  given six months in jail if you don't stand at least six feet away from someone this is being
[3:46:39.320 --> 3:46:45.800]  used by social engineers and they admit that they are trying to transform our world forever into
[3:46:45.800 --> 3:46:56.360]  something unrecognizable from what it's been we are not slaves and we must not act like it you're
[3:46:56.360 --> 3:47:14.840]  listening to the alex jones show it's the final segment of the alex jones show the dreaded

[3:47:37.480 --> 3:47:43.160]  seconds of our ads but they're not our ads that's the local ads we don't have any ads it's commercial

[3:47:47.880 --> 3:47:52.120]  dot video page in the future it'll be a big site i'm very very excited this is a seasonal show during
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:55.640]  the election it'll probably turn into something else after that but you can see the live feed right
[3:47:55.640 --> 3:48:01.160]  now at the american countdown dot news please help everybody spread that we're fighting hard
[3:48:01.160 --> 3:48:06.040]  and our power is you taking action we are doing this you are the info war and i salute you all
[3:48:06.040 --> 3:48:09.480]  let's hit two big things the time we have left i could start at the show with this but i got to
[3:48:09.480 --> 3:48:15.880]  get to it now barnes polosi and all the democrats i'm not going to play even half the clips there's
[3:48:15.880 --> 3:48:23.000]  hundreds of them came out in the late february and said go out go to china town go out congregate
[3:48:23.000 --> 3:48:28.520]  trump's wrong trump shouldn't block flights from china and then now they turn around and say trump
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:35.720]  is to blame so here's polosi encouraging large crowds in san francisco and china town on february
[3:48:35.720 --> 3:48:43.560]  27th a month and a couple days ago purvey here it's exciting to be here especially at this time
[3:48:43.560 --> 3:48:51.080]  uh to be able to be unified with our community uh we want to be vigilant about what that might be
[3:48:51.080 --> 3:48:56.760]  on the uh what is out there in other places we want to be careful about how we deal with it
[3:48:56.760 --> 3:49:04.680]  but we do want to say to people come to china town here we are we're again careful safe and
[3:49:05.960 --> 3:49:10.520]  come join us and then she supported a federal court that was trying to block trump blocking
[3:49:10.520 --> 3:49:16.200]  chinese flights they backed off and i'm not going to get into biden saying it's xenophobic to
[3:49:16.200 --> 3:49:20.600]  block the flights or control the border now fast forward a month later because exactly a
[3:49:20.600 --> 3:49:28.040]  month later last friday she comes on the news and says this she says trump's killing these people
[3:49:28.040 --> 3:49:33.800]  fiddling here it is for joining us i hope you are well and safe i know your home district
[3:49:33.800 --> 3:49:38.600]  of san francisco has been particularly hard hit president trump is considering relaxing
[3:49:38.600 --> 3:49:43.320]  federal guidelines for coronavirus for some of the less affected parts of the country do you
[3:49:43.320 --> 3:49:48.600]  think he should well first of all let me just say how sad it is that even since the president's
[3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:55.960]  signing of the bill the number of deaths reported has doubled from 1000 to 2000 in our country this
[3:49:55.960 --> 3:50:03.000]  is such a very very sad time for us so we should be taking every precaution of what the president
[3:50:03.000 --> 3:50:11.960]  is uh denial at the beginning uh was deadly his delaying of getting uh equipment to where
[3:50:11.960 --> 3:50:17.400]  this it continues is delaying getting the words needed the host looks i mean that is a con man
[3:50:17.400 --> 3:50:22.600]  now i think the best thing is your very cell safe danger will robinson he really needed to be in
[3:50:22.600 --> 3:50:27.640]  the studio it's fascinating how some of these guys get here she goes absolutely no we have to have
[3:50:27.640 --> 3:50:34.120]  testing testing testing that's what we said from the start before we can evaluate uh what the the
[3:50:34.840 --> 3:50:40.200]  nature of it is in some of these other regions as well i don't know what the purpose of that
[3:50:40.200 --> 3:50:46.120]  is i don't know what the scientists are saying to him i don't know what the scientists said to him
[3:50:46.120 --> 3:50:52.600]  when did this president know about this and what did he know what did he know and when did he know
[3:50:52.600 --> 3:51:00.200]  it that's for an after action review but as the president fiddles people are dying and we have to
[3:51:00.200 --> 3:51:05.480]  we just have to take every precaution man she's neurologically going downhill she sounds like
[3:51:05.480 --> 3:51:10.920]  she has marbles in her mouth like joe biden so so what are they doing here well this was this was
[3:51:10.920 --> 3:51:15.640]  the genius of the pandemic panic in its media hysteria they built up a plot like that you could
[3:51:15.640 --> 3:51:19.880]  take a disease like the flu and say what if i told you there's this disease that 30 million
[3:51:19.880 --> 3:51:26.600]  americans are going to get that that 30 000 americans are 50 or 60 or even 100 000 may die of
[3:51:26.600 --> 3:51:31.400]  that at least over hospitalization in some cities across the country uh pretty much every year
[3:51:31.400 --> 3:51:34.680]  but if the because people are familiar with the flu they couldn't get away with it with the flu so
[3:51:34.680 --> 3:51:39.240]  they took the flu recipe and knew that hey if we make it look like the mortality rate is really
[3:51:39.240 --> 3:51:44.600]  high and we make testing a big deal we 97 percent of the people who get from the flu never test
[3:51:44.600 --> 3:51:50.120]  for it so they knew that they would jack up the rate of responses and it would trigger terror
[3:51:50.120 --> 3:51:54.280]  in the countryside because it's already been here for six months and only that they knew that the
[3:51:54.280 --> 3:51:57.960]  most of people they would be testing were not people who are going to be severely ill or have
[3:51:57.960 --> 3:52:01.720]  any problems from it in other words the people that were so severely ill were going to the hospital
[3:52:01.720 --> 3:52:05.800]  getting treatment the people that are mostly getting tested right now are either asymptomatic
[3:52:05.800 --> 3:52:10.200]  or have very mild illnesses and so they knew just scare people to see those huge numbers
[3:52:10.200 --> 3:52:14.840]  absolutely that's why they built that testing mantra i am concerned because it comes back it is
[3:52:14.840 --> 3:52:18.120]  engineered from that research we've done and it does attack the test that's why people need to be
[3:52:18.120 --> 3:52:22.840]  supplemented they need to be ready to be prepared but the hype is the weapon against the economy
[3:52:22.840 --> 3:52:27.880]  now let's shift gears away from that travesty of her thinking we're all idiots don't have memories
[3:52:27.880 --> 3:52:33.960]  to this cbs news has been running this on a whole bunch of newscast okay qualmo's been running it's
[3:52:33.960 --> 3:52:39.080]  saying no respirators we as a giant stockpile of thousands it turns out lying about it uh they show
[3:52:39.080 --> 3:52:44.600]  a hospital in the worst-hit city in italy they show people and say this is new york right now
[3:52:44.600 --> 3:52:49.160]  and they're in an emergency to scare you but it wasn't new york it was italy the reports on
[3:52:49.160 --> 3:52:57.400]  info wars dot com here is what cbs showed new york's governor says fema gave the state 400
[3:52:57.400 --> 3:53:04.280]  ventilators to that he said this what am i going to do with 400 ventilators when i need 30 000
[3:53:04.280 --> 3:53:11.560]  you pick the 26 000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators
[3:53:11.560 --> 3:53:19.480]  the governor now projects that the state will need up to 140 000 beds with an additional 40 000 icu
[3:53:19.480 --> 3:53:24.360]  beds i would be lying if i didn't say there's an incredible amount of stress across the river
[3:53:24.360 --> 3:53:30.200]  from new york at holy name medical center in new jersey the chief infectious disease specialist
[3:53:30.200 --> 3:53:37.160]  says his hospital has just 10 ventilators barely enough for now but if the worst is yet to come
[3:53:37.160 --> 3:53:43.000]  as we're expecting then it won't be the mayor of los angeles says new york could be a preview of
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:49.800]  what's to come we are anywhere from about six to 12 days behind what we are seeing in new york city
[3:53:50.760 --> 3:53:55.320]  i want the hundred and thirty thousand ventilators pull them out of my way over what they need they
[3:53:55.320 --> 3:54:00.120]  turn out they've got thousands he's lying in a stockpile and there's one problem that wasn't new york
[3:54:00.120 --> 3:54:05.320]  that was idly just like they did with the fake footage on abc news of the curds supposedly
[3:54:05.320 --> 3:54:10.600]  getting blown up here is the actual real video from sky news that they grabbed and then edited
[3:54:10.600 --> 3:54:17.800]  to deceive you saying it was new york here it is and it is virtually out of control
[3:54:17.800 --> 3:54:22.600]  the patients are literally gasping for air
[3:54:25.560 --> 3:54:27.960]  the good news is the public doesn't leave anything out and checks at all
[3:54:28.520 --> 3:54:33.400]  the bubbles the staff struggle to communicate they've never covered a disease in this man
[3:54:33.400 --> 3:54:38.520]  all meant to this that's always going on yeah absolutely there's whole carry units of this
[3:54:38.520 --> 3:54:43.560]  for the flu and everything else right they go and they show you now to scare you what's interesting
[3:54:43.560 --> 3:54:47.400]  is according to italian data a large number of people that are dying up there actually are
[3:54:47.400 --> 3:54:52.600]  not residents in the area yeah completely surprising there are now 15 patients the doctors
[3:54:52.600 --> 3:54:57.720]  say they've seen nothing like it before in a warning other countries especially the united kingdom
[3:54:57.720 --> 3:55:02.840]  that they will see it as well people have keep describing this as like flu it's worse than that
[3:55:02.840 --> 3:55:08.280]  no all right let's stop right there so you just saw that footage on cbs saying it's new york
[3:55:08.280 --> 3:55:12.360]  but notice they weren't interviewing the doctors because they were italian they said this is footage
[3:55:12.360 --> 3:55:18.600]  from this new york hospital they don't have enough ventilators lying to you on purpose but
[3:55:18.600 --> 3:55:23.640]  nbc's got on top of brian williams tell even bigger lies exactly i mean it's been a systematic
[3:55:23.640 --> 3:55:28.760]  effort to emphasize everything that's going to be hype and trigger hysteria and trigger panic
[3:55:28.760 --> 3:55:33.880]  and trigger fear that's why you've had nurses committing suicide and fear of this rather than
[3:55:33.880 --> 3:55:37.720]  actually dying from the disease itself where like if they would have gone up there and told
[3:55:37.720 --> 3:55:42.280]  everybody by the way in new york city how many people have died in new york city who did not
[3:55:42.280 --> 3:55:49.480]  have a pre-existing deathly disease 14 people that's a very different number 98% of the people who
[3:55:49.480 --> 3:55:53.320]  have died i mean if you've had heart disease and liver failure you're 80 years old you better stay
[3:55:53.320 --> 3:55:57.160]  at home well and only that it's often these are people who are coming in who are dying of other
[3:55:57.160 --> 3:56:01.080]  things they did a study of it that's right and just because they they test positive they're
[3:56:01.080 --> 3:56:05.240]  saying they died of the virus if folks if you want to get the other side of this tune in tonight
