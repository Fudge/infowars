[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:40.460]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.460 --> 00:46.700]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday 25th day
[00:46.700 --> 00:55.260]  of June 2013 I am your host Alex Jones and I told you this a long time ago
[00:55.260 --> 01:00.400]  because it's the facts Congress insisted they be kept in the dark on NSA
[01:00.400 --> 01:06.860]  spying that's now what the lawmakers have come out and are saying to the press
[01:06.860 --> 01:13.620]  they passed the echelon legislation in the 80s and they passed the Telecommunications
[01:13.620 --> 01:19.460]  Act of 96 and the subsequent acts that all stated
[01:20.900 --> 01:26.340]  five billion dollars nine billion dollars 18 billion dollars 50 plus
[01:26.340 --> 01:31.220]  billion dollars hundred plus billion dollars that's how it's building up to
[01:31.220 --> 01:36.420]  build giant spy grids everywhere and hire hundreds of thousands of analysts
[01:36.420 --> 01:42.540]  per region to listen to your phones to track everything you're doing in
[01:42.540 --> 01:47.840]  live time and they're not looking for terrorists folks okay they've given them
[01:47.840 --> 01:53.620]  heat-seeking missiles in Syria they are controlling the economy and spying on
[01:53.620 --> 01:58.380]  good government people this has come out from whistleblowers they're spying on
[01:58.380 --> 02:04.020]  the light side of government because there's a legitimate side of government
[02:04.020 --> 02:08.300]  that does legitimate actions and legitimate quote services the problem is
[02:08.300 --> 02:13.780]  is that it's shrinking down to nothing and it's come out that they use it to
[02:13.780 --> 02:22.020]  spy I mean what did NSA insider Wayne Madsen tell you on this show 15 years
[02:22.020 --> 02:28.140]  ago 10 years ago five years ago a year ago six months ago over and over again
[02:28.140 --> 02:33.940]  the NSA is there to spy on Congress to spy on other governments to spy on
[02:33.940 --> 02:41.660]  corporations and to spy on the American people and to spy on FBI CIA NSA that's
[02:41.660 --> 02:45.420]  their main I mean their main focus the most important thing the apple of their
[02:45.420 --> 02:53.620]  eye the plum is their own people because the government is engaged in
[02:53.620 --> 02:58.300]  criminality and they're all acting like this isn't going on it's like general
[02:58.300 --> 03:04.460]  Alexander the head of the NSA the head of the cyber command looking at the deputy
[03:04.460 --> 03:10.420]  director of the FBI and saying tell your boss I'm gonna buy another beer because
[03:10.420 --> 03:16.180]  it's all a big joke ladies and gentlemen they're all committing crimes and so of
[03:16.180 --> 03:22.380]  course Congress is I know nothing I know I've seen nothing I hear nothing
[03:22.380 --> 03:31.100]  nothing and what do they do in their testimony all of them justice department
[03:31.100 --> 03:38.540]  heads all of them I know nothing on Benghazi I know nothing on IRS gate I
[03:38.540 --> 03:47.180]  know nothing on fast and furious they actually know everything if someone in
[03:47.180 --> 03:51.780]  the Justice Department or someone in the NSA that's even mid-level wants to go
[03:51.780 --> 03:56.540]  into my entire surfing history they can do it right now and they can also go
[03:56.540 --> 04:01.780]  in there and place false things that's even under law under a subsection of the
[04:01.780 --> 04:06.660]  Patriot Act on sneak and peek and then when you find out about it if you catch
[04:06.660 --> 04:10.980]  them in your house or catch them on your computer remotely it's a felony if you
[04:10.980 --> 04:16.300]  tell anyone they were doing it well I mean what they have laws next that they
[04:16.300 --> 04:22.580]  can put children in soup bowls you know it's the law or make black people slaves
[04:22.580 --> 04:28.500]  again it's the law I mean well I say your law is a fraud some constitutional
[04:28.500 --> 04:37.220]  it's it's a infamnia so that's just one of the articles up on info wars.com of
[04:37.220 --> 04:41.780]  no exaggeration there's probably 200 articles here Richard Clark says

[08:08.980 --> 08:20.300]  GCN radio network
[08:20.300 --> 08:25.100]  welcome ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this Tuesday 25th day
[08:25.100 --> 08:31.980]  of June 2013 worldwide transmission we're going to be here for the next three
[08:31.980 --> 08:36.820]  hours congressman isa has issued Benghazi subpoenas to the State Department
[08:36.820 --> 08:41.300]  and more and more news is coming out on that front it was in Reuters a few days
[08:41.300 --> 08:45.060]  ago but it's gotten really no attention that thousands of US troops have been
[08:45.060 --> 08:53.060]  deployed to an area in Israel by Gaza in case of some type of collapse in Egypt
[08:53.060 --> 08:58.900]  and millions of people trying to influx into Israel that is unprecedented and
[08:58.900 --> 09:04.180]  then it's just back of the newspaper we've got Putin confirming that Edward
[09:04.180 --> 09:11.260]  Snowden never entered Russia and is in the customs area in the no-mans land and
[09:11.260 --> 09:18.340]  he's told Snowden to leave and on top of that the media is running around again
[09:18.340 --> 09:24.220]  trying to frame this as if Putin or the communist Chinese are involved and I'm
[09:24.220 --> 09:28.260]  not in you know in some love affair with those guys it's just that they're not the
[09:28.260 --> 09:31.460]  globalists that run my country and that are running into the ground we've not
[09:31.460 --> 09:34.740]  been conquered by Russians or Chinese communists we've been conquered by
[09:34.740 --> 09:40.180]  megabanks that will work with anybody to consolidate power in America and
[09:40.180 --> 09:45.100]  deindustrialize us that's part of their score to settle with this republic you
[09:45.100 --> 09:48.340]  can say the globalist or allied with some of the communist Chinese leadership
[09:48.340 --> 09:52.500]  to get cheap slave goods to leverage out markets but that's as far as it goes so
[09:52.500 --> 09:56.660]  the attempt to brand Snowden is some foreign spy and we're seeing more and
[09:56.660 --> 10:01.900]  more of that it just doesn't fly and then they can put out the idea that any
[10:01.900 --> 10:08.220]  whistleblowers are basically involved in espionage and that's why Hong Kong was
[10:08.220 --> 10:12.500]  smart to say you need to leave that's basically what happened and now Russia is
[10:12.500 --> 10:17.660]  smart saying you stay in the customs area we're not letting you in Russia and
[10:17.660 --> 10:25.300]  we need to say you need to go you need to go and now they've got Kerry and
[10:25.300 --> 10:29.940]  people backtracking the Secretary of State going okay Russia Russia isn't
[10:29.940 --> 10:34.140]  involved in this but when you see meet the press saying arrest members of the
[10:34.140 --> 10:39.620]  press that Snowden talked to that is about rolling out a war openly on the
[10:39.620 --> 10:45.060]  press and and arresting people that expose government corruption this is
[10:45.060 --> 10:52.300]  this is Soviet Union Maoist China Fidel Castro's Cuba this is beyond stuff that
[10:52.300 --> 10:58.100]  Hugo Chavez would do and this is starting to border on Hitlerian this is
[10:58.100 --> 11:02.740]  how it started in 1935 36 it took Hitler a couple years to start going after the
[11:02.740 --> 11:10.940]  press first he went after army personnel and his own Nazis in the SA who
[11:10.940 --> 11:14.740]  weren't you know going along with the full program and after he consolidated
[11:14.740 --> 11:17.860]  power in the government which they're trying to do with the NSA now and over
[11:17.860 --> 11:22.900]  the media then they go after everybody else and again you've committed no
[11:22.900 --> 11:27.940]  crime you pay outrageous taxes you bow to the government you don't care about
[11:27.940 --> 11:33.340]  freedom you think you're safe it's the opposite you are a lunch to these people
[11:33.340 --> 11:39.540]  you are a lunchable you are low-hanging fruit those of us that fight the system
[11:39.540 --> 11:44.140]  those of us that are aggressive those of us that are highly visible historically
[11:44.140 --> 11:49.780]  and currently I can tell you are among the most safe of people the only folks
[11:49.780 --> 11:54.700]  they kill in my research are people that have a smoking gun and who have
[11:54.700 --> 12:07.420]  extreme credibility and Michael Hastings associate editor of Rolling Stone said
[12:07.420 --> 12:15.580]  I've got bombshell info on the CIA the NSA spy scandal and on women and sex with
[12:15.580 --> 12:20.420]  Petraeus and what was behind that well it was clearly sex operations it's
[12:20.420 --> 12:24.100]  clearly sent into compromising so it's an internal fight between the army and the
[12:24.100 --> 12:28.900]  CIA we've confirmed that across the board from a raft of insiders from Steve
[12:28.900 --> 12:34.620]  Pachennick to you name it a lot of them off record I'm not going to say some of
[12:34.620 --> 12:37.620]  them or guess you hear on air but some of some of them are off record but Wayne
[12:37.620 --> 12:43.660]  Madsen's on record many others and that's when you get killed is when you've
[12:43.660 --> 12:48.580]  got something oh my gosh he's very credible people believe him he's got the
[12:48.580 --> 12:52.540]  ear of the progressive but also the conservative press and the liberal press
[12:52.540 --> 12:59.660]  killing and I said on Sunday well I said last week as well that I don't believe
[12:59.660 --> 13:07.700]  that Michael Hastings was killed in a remote control accident even though
[13:07.700 --> 13:12.060]  DARPA is on record saying all the new cars can be remote controlled instantly
[13:12.060 --> 13:17.540]  by the government they have the code key backdoor passwords hardwired into
[13:17.540 --> 13:22.140]  everything wirelessly all these cars are now wireless on record especially this
[13:22.140 --> 13:27.900]  Mercedes and they can take control of it and drive it better than a race car
[13:27.900 --> 13:32.660]  driver can the in fact you can program the computer to take someone on a route
[13:32.660 --> 13:37.460]  and drive at speeds that the computer can drive it but that humans wouldn't be
[13:37.460 --> 13:42.620]  able to control the vehicle I mean five states already have Google cars driving
[13:42.620 --> 13:47.220]  on the road by next year it'll be 20 plus they estimate within five years to
[13:47.220 --> 13:52.340]  ten years every state in the US will have robot cars and then they're going
[13:52.340 --> 13:55.660]  to replace humans because the insurance is going to be jacked up and I told you
[13:55.660 --> 14:00.020]  this a decade ago because I know how they work now they've announced it we're
[14:00.020 --> 14:03.060]  going to charge you a lot more insurance if you're a human driver you're supposed
[14:03.060 --> 14:07.140]  to get in your cars and have them drive it for you and that's what this new
[14:07.140 --> 14:11.020]  Mercedes did and the new Lexus and a bunch of others do soon you'll be able
[14:11.020 --> 14:15.340]  to get low-cost cars that don't have this where it drives oh you were going
[14:15.340 --> 14:20.140]  over in a lane I'm taking over you're going too fast I'm going to break this
[14:20.140 --> 14:25.060]  is horrible but again they always sell tyranny implantable microchips face
[14:25.060 --> 14:29.620]  scanning smart homes that spy on you and control everything you do and title
[14:29.620 --> 14:37.620]  tail on you all of this is always sold as a status issue I'll never forget in
[14:37.620 --> 14:43.060]  wash tech back when the Washington Post in about 98 to 2002 was putting out a
[14:43.060 --> 14:49.180]  digital but also monthly hard copy magazine called wash tech they had their
[14:49.180 --> 14:53.100]  head technology writer brag that he'd been in with DARPA you can look this up
[14:53.100 --> 14:57.940]  and that they were going to promote a movement of body modification and
[14:57.940 --> 15:01.220]  tattooing and I'm not saying that's bad if you do that my point is they were
[15:01.220 --> 15:06.900]  going to promote it in the movies and TV to prepare this is DARPA talking to you
[15:06.900 --> 15:11.380]  like you're an idiot telling you the secret to prepare you to accept
[15:11.380 --> 15:15.260]  implantable chips and that there would be pills you swallowed that reported to
[15:15.260 --> 15:18.940]  your doctor what you were taking through your wireless internet part of all
[15:18.940 --> 15:23.080]  prescriptions I told you this two years ago wrote articles about it we had the
[15:23.080 --> 15:28.020]  companies putting it out threatened to sue us if we didn't make modifications to
[15:28.020 --> 15:32.780]  our articles it was in the Wall Street Journal the Daily Mail the Associated
[15:32.780 --> 15:38.860]  Press Reuters and a bunch of other publications the last two days that
[15:38.860 --> 15:43.380]  indeed that's the plan you won't get a prescription unless it's got RFID in it
[15:43.380 --> 15:48.140]  forget to take medicine these pills will tell your doctor Wall Street Journal
[15:48.140 --> 15:52.940]  see people keep saying man this guy sounds crazy all this stuff I'm telling
[15:52.940 --> 15:57.540]  you what they said they're going to do I want to explain something to you they
[15:57.540 --> 16:02.660]  say they put cancer viruses in your vaccines they say they put hydrofluorosalic
[16:02.660 --> 16:06.460]  acid in your water to give you cancer and dumb you down and sterilize you they
[16:06.460 --> 16:11.420]  say they're spraying aluminum dioxide barium salts and also some radioactive
[16:11.420 --> 16:16.540]  isotopes to weather modify worldwide it's public it's called geoengineering but
[16:16.540 --> 16:19.940]  the public goes I heard I heard won't even look it up won't even watch the
[16:19.940 --> 16:25.740]  films online for free to break it down I mean we're in Buck Rogersville we're
[16:25.740 --> 16:31.300]  having our entire society radically re-engineered into an artificial habitat
[16:31.300 --> 16:36.580]  in their words to where we will artificially adapt to that and then be
[16:36.580 --> 16:42.620]  unable to live outside of it we're having nano tech engineered viruses that's
[16:42.620 --> 16:46.740]  what they are artificially engineered viruses all the viruses is a replicating
[16:46.740 --> 16:53.860]  data RNA packet that programs DNA so they've created on record this is stuff
[16:53.860 --> 16:59.460]  that's declassified thousands of viruses that will reprogram the brain do
[16:59.460 --> 17:03.420]  you understand the end of free will they call it an anti-stress vaccine is how
[17:03.420 --> 17:07.700]  they're rolling it out see they call it connect the newest cute cutest video game
[17:07.700 --> 17:11.380]  oh that by the way uses wireless to scan through all your walls and listen to
[17:11.380 --> 17:16.540]  your voice three walls over and it can give a color image of your naked body
[17:16.540 --> 17:24.940]  standing in a shower through multiple brick walls and all the new computers
[17:24.940 --> 17:28.140]  and everything are listening and watching you and suddenly it's all over
[17:28.140 --> 17:32.020]  wired magazine it's all over the news and they're going what's wrong with that
[17:32.020 --> 17:38.700]  it's totally cool but simultaneously I'm insane and I'm bad because I'm telling
[17:38.700 --> 17:42.660]  you it went on before they made the announcement and I'm still insane and
[17:42.660 --> 17:47.380]  bad even after the announcements made you understand that's how the programming
[17:47.380 --> 17:52.580]  works because you're scared of that you should be concerned but you don't feel

[24:11.180 --> 24:15.380]  IRS gate on just the state of the world always good to get my friend George
[24:15.380 --> 24:18.900]  Norrie of Coast to Coast AM on Sheriff Richard Mack is here in Austin to be
[24:18.900 --> 24:22.500]  interviewed for Obama Deception 2 and while he's at it we're gonna have him in
[24:22.500 --> 24:27.260]  studio in the third hour today and that should be quite informative talking
[24:27.260 --> 24:30.020]  about solutions and how to take the states back we're gonna get into the
[24:30.020 --> 24:34.860]  Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act the reason the Voting Rights
[24:34.860 --> 24:40.060]  Act doesn't even matter is because of electronic voting fraud that's the real
[24:40.060 --> 24:43.620]  fraud that's going on so I'll give you my take on that a little bit later but to
[24:43.620 --> 24:48.100]  understand what's happening is in 1913 private offshore banks were able to get
[24:48.100 --> 24:52.220]  a beachhead and take control of our money supply and then they bankrupted the
[24:52.220 --> 24:55.980]  country artificially put us into emergency receivership with the
[24:55.980 --> 25:02.020]  emergency acts they put in in 1933 the War Powers Act that Roosevelt put into
[25:02.020 --> 25:06.740]  place and then in 1947 the National Security Act that whole shadow banking
[25:06.740 --> 25:11.300]  system was able to be given total government power and immunity above the
[25:11.300 --> 25:17.100]  law basically diplomatic immunity and secrecy so that really marks a major
[25:17.100 --> 25:23.060]  milestone in our road to tyranny and then from there it just gets worse and
[25:23.060 --> 25:27.300]  worse and now our military's under NATO command and Congress has told that and
[25:27.300 --> 25:30.500]  Congress does nothing and plays like they're stupid because they've been
[25:30.500 --> 25:34.220]  paid off just like Congress comes out and says we don't want to go to briefings
[25:34.220 --> 25:39.420]  we don't want to know about the NSA because the predecessors voted this
[25:39.420 --> 25:45.580]  reason into place and most of them are blackmailed most of the Republicans and
[25:45.580 --> 25:49.180]  Democrats on record and that's why it's always coming out the scams they're
[25:49.180 --> 25:53.980]  involved in the fraud the weird sexual stuff they are identified by the power
[25:53.980 --> 25:59.340]  structure is being corrupt and they are immediately promoted to the top and any
[25:59.340 --> 26:04.380]  FBI agent any CIA person will tell you that when they start going on field
[26:04.380 --> 26:09.580]  operations first it'll be here's some high class you know high dollar hookers
[26:09.580 --> 26:15.100]  have sex with them and if you don't have sex with them you're never moved past
[26:15.100 --> 26:21.100]  the desk job or you never you move past basically low-level duties and then if
[26:21.100 --> 26:28.100]  you have sex with the hookers then it moves up to take some stolen goods just
[26:28.100 --> 26:33.860]  like they tried to corrupt Serpico in the New York detective's office and I've
[26:33.860 --> 26:38.140]  had Serpico on we've said you know how many other police were corrupt and he
[26:38.140 --> 26:42.580]  goes in the detective narcotics units all of them and then they shot him in the
[26:42.580 --> 26:48.980]  face over it and only our naive atta allows this to continue only only
[26:48.980 --> 26:53.300]  letting drugs be illegal they've had northern European countries legalized
[26:53.300 --> 27:00.420]  drugs in most cases drug use goes down by over half always over a third they put
[27:00.420 --> 27:05.500]  up billboards showing how pathetic drug addicts are but see the globalists have
[27:05.500 --> 27:08.860]  already taken over there so why should they even bring in drugs and sell them
[27:08.860 --> 27:13.140]  they've already got full control and you know 75 80% tax rates in places like
[27:13.140 --> 27:18.820]  Denmark so why should they even let people ship drugs in and then have it
[27:18.820 --> 27:23.020]  illegal so I guess that's one good thing once we're fully captured by the
[27:23.020 --> 27:26.340]  globalist they'll they'll legalize the drugs and we can stop all this
[27:26.340 --> 27:31.180]  craziness but I'd rather stop it now how many drug dealers are on record going
[27:31.180 --> 27:36.260]  public I in my film Kevin boost American drug war film I you know he
[27:36.260 --> 27:41.460]  interviews drug dealers who say no we don't want drugs decriminalized and then
[27:41.460 --> 27:46.180]  they get Christian conservatives to say they should be illegal so the government
[27:46.180 --> 27:49.700]  can ship them in for big banks that get the money and get the laundering this
[27:49.700 --> 27:54.100]  these are the points I'm getting at here and then they've got people driving
[27:54.100 --> 27:57.740]  around Austin Texas with bumper stickers saying I pay carbon credits to this
[27:57.740 --> 28:01.900]  group and I go look up the group and it's either Al Gore's group or the Roth
[28:01.900 --> 28:06.860]  child group or the Clinton Obama group there's only five different major carbon
[28:06.860 --> 28:12.740]  exchanges and then you find out that all these corrupt globalist authoritarian
[28:12.740 --> 28:19.420]  mobsters are being paid money and on coal on oil on plastic but then people
[28:19.420 --> 28:25.460]  volunteer to have special credit cards that they swipe that send money like an
[28:25.460 --> 28:28.580]  indulgence like you know when the Pope said get your family out of hell or out
[28:28.580 --> 28:32.420]  of purgatory you know send me you know send me money it's kind of like that in
[28:32.420 --> 28:37.140]  the old days and you go pay Al Gore or the Roth childs of the Rockefellers
[28:37.140 --> 28:45.300]  money so you feel good about using your car it's just crazy loving to be suckers
[28:45.300 --> 28:49.620]  nothing to do with the environment I mean here's one in the weekly standard
[28:49.620 --> 28:54.500]  White House climate advisor a war on coal is exactly what's needed we can chew
[28:54.500 --> 28:58.580]  up the clip of Obama saying we will bankrupt coal you can build a coal
[28:58.580 --> 29:03.460]  plant we will bankrupt you and they're doing that to shut down our industry
[29:03.460 --> 29:07.300]  they're not calling for China to stop building three of my week as they shut
[29:07.300 --> 29:10.540]  down more than three of my week here and as your power prices go up I mean I
[29:10.540 --> 29:15.860]  know I harp on this it's just they are gutting America right now because they
[29:15.860 --> 29:20.060]  are an enemy globalist group that hates the fact that we still have guns and
[29:20.060 --> 29:25.580]  still have a memory of freedom they want to extinguish that forever just like
[29:25.580 --> 29:29.260]  Stalin would collectivize all the farms in Ukraine to break everybody over a

[33:56.140 --> 34:00.660]  the whole new world order and look at how many of them are going to jail look
[34:00.660 --> 34:04.980]  at how many of them are getting indicted because their crimes are so public and so

[34:37.940 --> 34:43.780]  civil rights I'm here in your country pay for everything I mean the country is
[34:43.780 --> 34:47.540]  going bankrupt and these big banks want that folks they want to destroy our
[34:47.540 --> 34:52.220]  wages and they sell it in the media via the Ford Foundation for more than 60
[34:52.220 --> 34:56.260]  years on record that's who funds this Ford Foundation has more than 50
[34:56.260 --> 35:01.460]  billion in their war chest paying for textbooks in Mexico mainly saying you
[35:01.460 --> 35:06.740]  know El Norte belongs to Mexico the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo this is the
[35:06.740 --> 35:11.060]  globalist that run our government to create this division so that it's seen
[35:11.060 --> 35:16.140]  as your anti-Hispanic even if you're Hispanic if you don't want to be under
[35:16.140 --> 35:20.540]  the government of Mexico a failed state because the globalist want to collapse
[35:20.540 --> 35:26.580]  Mexico into the US and collapse the US that's their goal in a receivership
[35:26.580 --> 35:31.340]  takeover Chucky Schumer who wants your guns and who says the family is a bad
[35:31.340 --> 35:36.060]  thing and it is a horrible monster he's saying he wants to bring in a bunch of
[35:36.060 --> 35:39.980]  foreigners who could probably be brought in and turned into Liberty lovers a lot
[35:39.980 --> 35:46.460]  of Marr instead they're turned into anti-American socialist anti-gun people
[35:46.460 --> 35:50.780]  and then Americans are told well you better go along with this you're racist
[35:50.780 --> 35:54.980]  when ladies and gentlemen have you seen the demographics in this country if
[35:54.980 --> 36:02.020]  they've branded this as as as a Hispanic victory racially notice it's all
[36:02.020 --> 36:07.260]  racial politics the government and media is selling turn on MSNBC it's like the
[36:07.260 --> 36:13.340]  the the the Ku Klux Klan channel but for whites that hate whites and other
[36:13.340 --> 36:16.940]  people that hate white people and they're pushing it pushing it pushing it
[36:16.940 --> 36:22.580]  actually to make sure whites then go into their own little bubble as well in a
[36:22.580 --> 36:26.460]  Balkanized system and that's what Brzezinski talks about that's what the
[36:26.460 --> 36:31.220]  UN and Club of Rome talk about that's what Henry Kissinger is in the news
[36:31.220 --> 36:35.820]  today saying what we hope for is a Balkanized divided Syria that's what
[36:35.820 --> 36:39.620]  they want is a global corporate government with all the old countries
[36:39.620 --> 36:44.220]  broken up along religious and sectarian lines this is the Roman model the
[36:44.220 --> 36:51.820]  British Empire model of divide and conquer and imagine how they've branded
[36:51.820 --> 37:00.300]  it if you see the demographics you've got Hispanics in the southwest and Texas
[37:00.300 --> 37:06.420]  and Florida where under the age of 10 and this is this number is a few years
[37:06.420 --> 37:13.700]  old you've got 60 to 70% of the children are Hispanic okay and then you've got
[37:13.700 --> 37:17.780]  all the rest of the country I mean if this was a racial thing then the
[37:17.780 --> 37:23.660]  Hispanics have won America is yours so are you now going to say let's bring in
[37:23.660 --> 37:29.060]  everybody for the globalist to then vote to be anti-gun because it's seen as the
[37:29.060 --> 37:35.260]  victory against America is to bring in socialism and to get the guns and to do
[37:35.260 --> 37:42.740]  all this when offshore banks are doing it to destroy the United States I mean
[37:42.740 --> 37:46.380]  let's say you're a Hispanic truck driver because we've had these rallies
[37:46.380 --> 37:51.900]  before when you'll have thousands of people out waving Mexican flags saying
[37:51.900 --> 37:56.820]  la reconquista la infosora all this stuff you know with the invasion the
[37:56.820 --> 38:01.900]  reconquering people wearing shirts funded by the Ford Foundation that say
[38:01.900 --> 38:06.060]  plan of San Diego must be implemented now which means kill all whites above the
[38:06.060 --> 38:11.580]  age of 16 I mean this is like just beyond the white supremacist if they
[38:11.580 --> 38:15.020]  said that they'd be arrested we have video and photos of this I've covered it
[38:15.020 --> 38:19.660]  it's on our site just type in plan of San Diego you'll find it and you've got
[38:19.660 --> 38:24.460]  all of this unfolding with the government and big banks funding it to
[38:24.460 --> 38:31.460]  create Balkanization and then you've got Mexico a completely failed state you've
[38:31.460 --> 38:37.020]  got all these other Latin American countries collapsing and I go to these
[38:37.020 --> 38:40.940]  events and guess who would be at these demonstrations these counter demonstrations
[38:40.940 --> 38:45.020]  I did years ago we ought to dig that video up and re-air it because it's
[38:45.020 --> 38:49.380]  pretty riveting I probably did like ten of these counter demonstrations and I
[38:49.380 --> 38:53.180]  would find that politically correct white people were pretty much all scared
[38:53.180 --> 38:57.220]  to come out there guess who would actually join me to protest the illegal
[38:57.220 --> 39:01.460]  aliens was mainly a Mexican Americans that just wanted to be called Americans
[39:01.460 --> 39:05.500]  because they understood it's like I'm a truck driver I was getting $30 an hour
[39:05.500 --> 39:10.460]  roughly five years ago this is like a decade ago and now I'm getting $15 $16
[39:10.460 --> 39:14.460]  an hour if I'm lucky and they say soon with the Mexican trucks coming in
[39:14.460 --> 39:21.820]  driving on the way is I'll get nothing oh you you you got it see just like Ross
[39:21.820 --> 39:25.900]  Perot was called a racist or had nothing to do with that when he said listen
[39:25.900 --> 39:30.820]  Canadians are getting $35 an hour on average we're getting about 24 $25 an
[39:30.820 --> 39:35.020]  hour we have clips of this actually in fall the Republic I went back you can
[39:35.020 --> 39:39.780]  go online on YouTube and find the Larry King Al Gore Ross Perot debates there's
[39:39.780 --> 39:44.100]  two of them they're online they're like 40 minutes long you know with the ads
[39:44.100 --> 39:47.020]  cut out with Larry King and he goes listen
[39:47.020 --> 39:52.900]  Mexico's got you know a dollar an hour no infrastructure you just put the
[39:52.900 --> 39:58.260]  factories in no workers top no insurance no civilization because the corrupt
[39:58.260 --> 40:02.020]  regimes down there don't want their people to be upwardly mobile so he got
[40:02.020 --> 40:05.540]  it you got to pay people a livable wage like Henry Ford did so they can buy the
[40:05.540 --> 40:10.220]  cars you're making this is how you build a culture this is how you build a
[40:10.220 --> 40:15.060]  society and he said long term it'll all move to China after the giant sucking
[40:15.060 --> 40:19.740]  sound those from Canada to the US explained we got all the Canadian jobs
[40:19.740 --> 40:25.420]  because we were paid seven eight nine ten dollars more an hour that is the
[40:25.420 --> 40:29.620]  Canadians were so because Americans were paid less we got those jobs and then
[40:29.620 --> 40:33.740]  Mexico is paid way less so they got those jobs and then China's pay weighed
[40:33.740 --> 40:37.820]  less so then they get those jobs to where Mexico's losing most its jobs now to
[40:37.820 --> 40:44.420]  China and India and it is the race to the bottom and I'm desperately here trying
[40:44.420 --> 40:52.940]  to explain this to people I mean look I'm smart I know what I'm doing my family
[40:52.940 --> 40:56.540]  is smart they're professionals they know what they're doing I'll tell you my
[40:56.540 --> 41:01.020]  family's gonna be okay regardless of what's done to America overall I know
[41:01.020 --> 41:05.300]  how to adapt overcome you name it and a lot of us do but the problem is the
[41:05.300 --> 41:10.420]  globalist are just gonna tax us to where we can't compete either by design but
[41:10.420 --> 41:13.500]  let me tell you the general public just wants to go out and work a decent job
[41:13.500 --> 41:18.620]  you're done you're going to live in a 200 square foot apartment inside
[41:18.620 --> 41:23.740]  basically a prison cell this is smart growth on record LA New York San
[41:23.740 --> 41:29.620]  Francisco is already doing it and you're going to be a prisoner and this is all
[41:29.620 --> 41:32.740]  been planned out where they're gonna raise the taxes the bureaucracy and
[41:32.740 --> 41:37.020]  shut down the jobs to where you're totally under government control you're
[41:37.020 --> 41:41.260]  gonna go work 12 hours a day maybe 18 hours a day like in China you you're
[41:41.260 --> 41:47.380]  gonna live in a high-rise building that is a jail cell this is the dystopic
[41:47.380 --> 41:51.260]  model and the elite are gonna live out in the countryside and helicopter into
[41:51.260 --> 41:57.220]  town that is the whole plan in the 60s by Club of Rome they're implementing it
[41:57.220 --> 42:03.260]  and they are going to use the population of Latin America that doubles
[42:03.260 --> 42:12.020]  roughly every 20 years to absolutely overrun this country and they're gonna
[42:12.020 --> 42:17.300]  take the guns the general public is going to vote along with the electronic
[42:17.300 --> 42:24.580]  voting machines to do anything the giant unwashed poor poisoned masses of poor
[42:24.580 --> 42:29.620]  people across the board black white Hispanic Asian you name it are going
[42:29.620 --> 42:33.100]  to do whatever the government says in this new economy to make sure they get
[42:33.100 --> 42:37.300]  their food ration digits put on their card that's why the globalists want the
[42:37.300 --> 42:41.700]  end of wealth the end of prosperity for the general public to make you totally
[42:41.700 --> 42:46.220]  controllable you're not gonna have power but a few hours a day government
[42:46.220 --> 42:49.220]  districts are gonna have power all the time that's already been officially set
[42:49.220 --> 42:55.060]  up nationwide don't believe me look up Austin Texas the government and central
[42:55.060 --> 42:58.380]  area of the city has agreements to never have their power turned off in
[42:58.380 --> 43:04.020]  blackouts and to never have their power rates raised they are the ruling class
[43:04.020 --> 43:09.220]  you are going to pay and pay you're gonna pay more for two hours of it of
[43:09.220 --> 43:13.500]  electricity a day than you used to pay for a week of electricity when they're
[43:13.500 --> 43:18.780]  done with you you understand that I hope you understand that and they said
[43:18.780 --> 43:21.980]  they're gonna start having more and more blackouts on purpose just to train you
[43:21.980 --> 43:25.420]  not have power and you notice those have all been happening this is the new
[43:25.420 --> 43:32.140]  America do you understand that in a decade Chalcescu went from all of
[43:32.140 --> 43:36.140]  Romania having electricity to no one having electricity but government
[43:36.140 --> 43:42.300]  buildings army barracks and government districts of cities in Romanian they
[43:42.300 --> 43:48.180]  will do that here every major city of Romania had electricity most of small
[43:48.180 --> 43:53.740]  towns added they just got rid of it this is a total austerity dark age plan for
[43:53.740 --> 43:58.780]  you and your family and you're gonna compete with four million prison
[43:58.780 --> 44:02.660]  laborers in America working for 25 cents an hour you're gonna compete with 100
[44:02.660 --> 44:07.420]  million Mexicans in Mexico 30 million here who are then given government
[44:07.420 --> 44:12.180]  welfare as a corporate supplement to make sure they can work for an
[44:12.180 --> 44:16.980]  unlivable wage and take your job this is the breaking of America I'm gonna go to
[44:16.980 --> 44:20.180]  your phone calls and shut up I haven't even gotten it all the news and this
[44:20.180 --> 44:27.100]  isn't bad news knowing about this gives us a chance to turn this around but they
[44:27.100 --> 44:34.220]  are now saying Congressman Ryan says an even more likely now bill will pass the
[44:34.220 --> 44:39.660]  House Oval Office Powell Obama Boehner Pelosi McConnell and read all trying to
[44:39.660 --> 44:46.420]  ram it through Mexican theme park offers fake border crossing attraction it's
[44:46.420 --> 44:50.820]  the patriotic duty to go to El Norte and bring it down and then the
[44:50.820 --> 44:54.340]  government saying that's right come on in here's all your free stuff Americans
[44:54.340 --> 44:57.980]  don't get it Americans don't get in state tuition Americans don't get free
[44:57.980 --> 45:07.260]  tuition Americans are the chumps the marks we pay for our own destruction all
[45:07.260 --> 45:13.300]  planned out with total precision the total destruction of this country and I
[45:13.300 --> 45:16.980]  just want everybody to remember if they succeed in all this remember are you
[45:16.980 --> 45:20.220]  gonna be better off in 10 years than you were today are you better off now than
[45:20.220 --> 45:25.780]  you were 10 years ago and you ain't seen nothing yet 76% of Americans are
[45:25.780 --> 45:29.860]  living paycheck to paycheck just a decade ago it was less than 50% living
[45:29.860 --> 45:35.180]  paycheck to paycheck and before that we were the greatest saving nation in the
[45:35.180 --> 45:39.740]  world now we're the greatest debtor nation because it's all done by design on
[45:39.740 --> 45:46.500]  record we have a criminal government Rick in Utah you're on the air you want
[45:46.500 --> 45:52.820]  to talk about the giant NSA data center there in your state go ahead I just wanted
[45:52.820 --> 45:57.260]  to say that our data center will be up and operational at the end of August and
[45:57.260 --> 46:03.700]  they said that that our congressman didn't know anything about this NSA
[46:03.700 --> 46:10.220]  deep searching of millions of people actually called orange hatches office they
[46:10.220 --> 46:15.660]  said that they voted on it in 2005 and that orange hatch voted for it so in fact
[46:15.660 --> 46:19.500]  they actually did know about exactly what was happening no no sir of course
[46:19.500 --> 46:24.860]  they know about the biggest spy compound in world history you know dozens of
[46:24.860 --> 46:29.500]  giant buildings the size of football fields just much bigger than football
[46:29.500 --> 46:35.420]  fields huge buildings we show the NSA data center and when American slaves from
[46:35.420 --> 46:41.700]  the newspaper try to go take photos of it in the middle of the town that they
[46:41.700 --> 46:45.900]  come and arrest them like it's illegal to take photos of a giant complex I mean
[46:45.900 --> 46:49.780]  only in America and of course orange hatch says he doesn't know it exists just
[46:49.780 --> 46:54.180]  like they say there's no FEMA camps even though it's all on record this is how
[46:54.180 --> 46:58.020]  they keep people in the dark I mean we're talking about a complex that's the
[46:58.020 --> 47:02.420]  equivalent of more than 10 major shopping malls basically is how I would
[47:02.420 --> 47:06.980]  describe it it just ultra massive and that's nothing that's just a central
[47:06.980 --> 47:11.420]  center they have bigger centers at Microsoft and Google and Apple and
[47:11.420 --> 47:16.980]  Amazon that are NSA I mean that's the only thing we're building is NSA because
[47:16.980 --> 47:23.060]  it's not just NSA sir guess guess what this really is I'm sure you listen to
[47:23.060 --> 47:29.340]  the show do you know what this really is what is it it is the new internet with
[47:29.340 --> 47:34.460]  fiber optics 100 times faster than the current fiber optic that have already
[47:34.460 --> 47:37.500]  been laid nationwide into the universities and corporate governments
[47:37.500 --> 47:42.260]  this is the kill system bigger than the Manhattan project to destroy the old
[47:42.260 --> 47:46.580]  internet and take over the new internet that is a spy grid into all the video
[47:46.580 --> 47:52.380]  games all the appliances wrist watches clock radios everything now being built
[47:52.380 --> 47:59.340]  and rolled out is an AI spy grid actually that's absolutely correct they
[47:59.340 --> 48:02.780]  they said one of the reasons why that they brought it to Utah is because of
[48:02.780 --> 48:08.940]  the BYU University that they have some of the best people there that understand
[48:08.940 --> 48:14.540]  the algorithms and that's who that they want to employ I also wanted to say
[48:14.540 --> 48:20.980]  about the HR 645 about the FEMA camp they said that that bill actually was
[48:20.980 --> 48:27.420]  never passed but right now in subcommittee is HR 390 which is actually
[48:27.420 --> 48:32.740]  the old HR 645 to set up a FEMA camp sir have you read that bill the
[48:32.740 --> 48:39.060]  emergency centers establishment act you know but I'm telling listeners it's
[48:39.060 --> 48:42.660]  everything they've already built it just officially establishes it and
[48:42.660 --> 48:50.020]  increases funding right that's absolutely right that's another that's another
[48:50.020 --> 48:54.380]  thing that I asked Orrin Hatcher's office about and magically they knew nothing
[48:54.380 --> 49:01.500]  about that well listen five years ago cyber command stood up that is it turned
[49:01.500 --> 49:04.700]  on even though it wasn't originally funded yet it's already in place they
[49:04.700 --> 49:08.420]  said they're going to shut down the alternative press they said they're
[49:08.420 --> 49:12.700]  going to spy on journalists they said in these Pentagon briefings that were even
[49:12.700 --> 49:18.580]  on C-span that they're taking over they've had Pentagon briefings on C-span
[49:18.580 --> 49:23.740]  where Thomas Barnett and others admit we work for foreign banks we work for
[49:23.740 --> 49:27.940]  Wall Street this is a corporate global government this is all out in the open
[49:27.940 --> 49:35.100]  that's what's so frustrating my brother is that is that they're building in
[49:35.100 --> 49:40.540]  San Antonio in Dallas in Austin giant Department of Defense and other private
[49:40.540 --> 49:44.340]  corporate spy buildings they're building substations to spy on each
[49:44.340 --> 49:47.900]  neighborhood they're putting secret police units in everywhere they're
[49:47.900 --> 49:52.860]  planning a full-on war with everybody all their training manuals say it is an
[49:52.860 --> 49:57.580]  open foreign military buildup with collaborators everywhere lining up
[49:57.580 --> 50:02.020]  against us and all the public manuals are taking our guns breaking up our
[50:02.020 --> 50:06.140]  families putting conservatives in reeducation camps I mean that's just
[50:06.140 --> 50:12.140]  it's so hellish folks and how evil and how openly despicable and wrong this is
[50:12.140 --> 50:18.340]  and we can't even get the adult public poison from fluoride to even understand
[50:18.340 --> 50:24.380]  the NSA is spying on them I don't know how that we can convince our senators
[50:24.380 --> 50:28.460]  and representatives to do anything about it I I literally call my
[50:28.460 --> 50:33.100]  representatives two three times a week I mean they know me by name and yet they
[50:33.100 --> 50:37.700]  do nothing about it or they play just absolute stupid on things that I know
[50:37.700 --> 50:42.780]  that that are running through what that's what they do they always deny
[50:42.780 --> 50:48.220]  everything exists so in real debate can ever form that that's a military tactic
[50:48.220 --> 50:51.900]  just say that we're not assaulting there's nothing happening tasers aren't
[50:51.900 --> 50:58.340]  killing anybody GMOs good for you fluorides good for you

[55:33.260 --> 55:35.980]  I just want to say this briefly.
[55:35.980 --> 55:39.780]  I'm up here saying all this, and it sounds wild, and I go to break, and I go, no, that's
[55:39.780 --> 55:43.700]  all true, and I said, look at how they let the troops use DU, knowing it's a death sentence,
[55:43.700 --> 55:46.820]  look at how they give them deadly vaccines, look at how they let them get nerve gas, and
[55:46.820 --> 55:48.980]  don't give them treatment, look at all the secret testing.
[55:48.980 --> 55:52.620]  The globalist hate us, folks, you've got to understand that.
[55:52.620 --> 55:54.180]  And they want to mop up America.
[55:54.180 --> 55:58.860]  They want to use our energy to build their world government and then get rid of us.
[55:58.860 --> 56:02.620]  And they are targeting everybody.
[56:02.620 --> 56:04.260]  And it's all done compartmentalized.
[56:04.260 --> 56:08.500]  The people carrying all this out, most of them, don't even know what they're doing.
[56:08.500 --> 56:12.540]  The water treatment facilities, they go, oh, look, the fluoride came in from China, or
[56:12.540 --> 56:16.660]  came in from Florida, or came in from Wyoming, you know, from the uranium mines in those
[56:16.660 --> 56:23.620]  countries, or in those states, and we just put it in the water, and all it says is sodium
[56:23.620 --> 56:29.260]  fluoride, hydrofluorosalic acid, and other byproducts, and then labs do tests on it.
[56:29.260 --> 56:33.820]  Some of the stuff, it even says what's in it, mercury, lead, arsenic, you know, radioactive
[56:33.820 --> 56:37.340]  isotopes, and they put it in the water, and then you go to your city council and they
[56:37.340 --> 56:39.540]  laugh at you.
[56:39.540 --> 56:46.180]  See, I mean, what, we're living in a twilight zone episode.
[56:46.180 --> 56:51.460]  And I told the story of being up in Hot Springs, Arkansas for a week on a slash vacation broadcast,
[56:51.460 --> 56:55.660]  you know, I did the broadcast there, but spent most of the day with my children, a working
[56:55.660 --> 56:58.860]  vacation as they call it.
[56:58.860 --> 57:05.780]  And I was there, and they had a water convention for the state of Arkansas, where the state
[57:05.780 --> 57:09.140]  had passed a law saying you've got a fluoride, because all these towns were pulling it out,
[57:09.140 --> 57:15.620]  and I had so many guys shake my hand and say, we're not putting it in, buddy.
[57:15.620 --> 57:21.740]  You see, the word's out, ladies and gentlemen, the word is out.
[57:21.740 --> 57:25.620]  Let's go to Brad in Indiana, Brad got about a minute and a half, welcome, sir.
[57:25.620 --> 57:29.740]  Hey, Alex, first I'm calling a long time listener, I'm a huge fan.
[57:29.740 --> 57:30.740]  God bless you.
[57:30.740 --> 57:34.540]  Well, first of all, I wanted to say, I love the music you play, you know, when you come
[57:34.540 --> 57:39.060]  back from break, I would for sure love to hear some rage against the machine, but I
[57:39.060 --> 57:44.260]  wanted to get to my point here, my dad, he's a retired state trooper, he's been retired
[57:44.260 --> 57:53.380]  for about 15 years, he joined the force back in 1977, he's been a detective, he was told
[57:53.380 --> 57:57.940]  by his superiors to investigate suspected terrorists.
[57:57.940 --> 58:03.140]  The list he was given, normal people, he would go to their houses, they were all libertarians,
[58:03.140 --> 58:09.380]  they were all churchgoers, you know, all, you know, right wingers, army veterans, they
[58:09.380 --> 58:14.380]  had been targeting right wingers for the past few days.
[58:14.380 --> 58:15.980]  Well, no, I mean, I got outlawed in the 70s in Texas, because it was already illegal,
[58:15.980 --> 58:20.460]  they had the state police spying on, if you aren't a communist, they spy on you.
[58:20.460 --> 58:24.900]  And what's crazy is most of the troopers aren't bad people, and they're like, I mean, breaking
[58:24.900 --> 58:28.060]  into houses, you name it, I mean, I don't know about the state you're in, you're in
[58:28.060 --> 58:31.660]  Indiana, but they've always, say what, I want to come back to you, Brad, I want to hear
[58:31.660 --> 58:37.100]  more about this than Sean, Paul, Joseph and others, and we've got George Norrie coming

[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:44.660]  We're going to cover the waterfront of all the big breaking news from the open borders
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:50.180]  promotion to 80% of pre-packaged food in America, our band in other countries to show you how
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.340]  toxic our food is.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:56.100]  We're going to get into California, about to pass a law that you got to get registered
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:01.580]  in background checks to buy AMOM, but Brad in Indiana was bringing up something I'm
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.580]  already aware of.
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:07.620]  We've gotten the state police training manuals for really three decades that I've seen it,
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:12.900]  but now it's just started to go public, he was saying his dad's a retired state trooper,
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:18.260]  that they were told to go investigate libertarians, veterans, right-wingers, and I would just
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:21.740]  love the state police to come knock on my door, act like I've done something wrong.
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:22.740]  That's what they already do.
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:26.020]  They've pulled me over and asked, you know, what I'm doing, what I'm planning, where I'm
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.020]  going.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.660]  I'm just like, come on, I don't bring in drugs like the government, you know, I'm not doing
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.660]  all this stuff.
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:36.860]  We have a criminal government that is trying to train police, just enroll playing.
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:42.140]  Look at all these school drills they've had where it's a militia attacks the school, or
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:48.380]  where a militia is going to bomb the Boston Marathon in a drill and then, oh, somebody
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.660]  else does it.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.500]  You know, that came out in the Boston Globe.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.900]  I told you folks, I told you they were planning to blame it on us.
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:02.300]  Every TV show, every movie, the guy that wants liberty and freedom and due process is a terrorist.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.900]  I mean, come on, how obvious is this?
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.980]  You know, what else did your dad tell you about this, Brad?
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:11.980]  Well, basically he was told by higher mortars to go investigate these people.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:17.260]  Well, he figured out that criminals were actually running the state police, which in his opinion
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.700]  they were, you know, they were huge liberals.
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:24.100]  You know, might have the great guy, you know, he's conservative, he raised me to be conservative.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:28.660]  I mean, he actually retired pretty early, but, you know, he was told to investigate
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:29.660]  these libertarians.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.020]  And I was like, you know, these people are not a threat at all.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.740]  You know, they don't pose a threat to the people.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:38.540]  Well, when the globalists try to arrest everybody and put us in FEMA camps, they know we'll
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:39.940]  be forced to fight back.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.940]  That's why we are the threat.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:44.420]  We're the threat to this foreign takeover.
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:48.100]  And my dad's kind of worried right now, you know, he's starting to kind of wake up a little
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:52.420]  bit and I tell him about your show every single day, I tell him to tune in, you know, I give
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:56.620]  him all his articles to look at, and he's kind of becoming aware that, hey, we're being
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:59.740]  taken over here and our country's ran by communists.
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:00.740]  Exactly.
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.300]  He's starting to become more aware.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:05.020]  I mean, listen, here's the deal.
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.020]  Here's the deal.
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:10.860]  This is so over the top that they might win just because it's so unbelievable.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:12.140]  That's how tyranny always works.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:18.060]  But if we learn from history now and really face how bad this is, a bunch of anti-human
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:23.900]  authoritarians using communism and socialism grassroots, they're really a eugenics group
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.780]  are in control of what are we going to do about it?
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:29.540]  I mean, because it's only going to get worse.
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.900]  What else is your dad saying?
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.060]  He's really starting to wake up.
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.060]  He's really starting to wake up.
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:38.060]  You know, I keep telling him to listen to you, but he just won't.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:42.980]  But something else I also wanted to touch on, I'm an appliance repair technician.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:49.540]  So I work on a lot of brand new washers, dryers, these things are programmed to access your
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:50.540]  home's Wi-Fi.
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:55.740]  They're programmed to access your cell phone, so you can do like a quick diagnosis.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:01.940]  You know, what you said before about appliances, you know, being able to access your cell phones
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:03.440]  from a guy is absolutely true.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.340]  But it's all on record.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:10.620]  The smart meter and the connect and all of them are designed for the NSA to go in and
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:14.380]  take control and watch you and listen to you and track you.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:18.980]  I mean, the cable boxes, all of it for over 15 years, have been watching and listening
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.100]  to everybody.
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.420]  This is all now being announced.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:23.540]  They're saying, should it be doing that?
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:28.700]  See, see, do I get a Pulitzer Prize for exposing this in 97, 98?
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.700]  No.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.700]  Now it's just like big deal.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.700]  You're being watched.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.700]  Absolutely.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:37.180]  Well, you ought to do a YouTube video about being an appliance repair person and what
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.180]  it's like.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:43.180]  And again, that's a secret tax to the corporations that have gotten embedded with the globalist.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:48.100]  A lot of times actually funded the globalist or the globalist is that you pay in the cost
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.300]  of these products.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:55.180]  Some estimates are half your cell phone bill or a half the cost of a cell phone is all
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:05:01.180]  the tech built into it and the spying charges.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:05.900]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:10.020]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:14.580]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:16.100]  Check out Simply Safe.

[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:04.820]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:05.820]  tyranny is here.
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:09.980]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:12.420]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:16.980]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.220]  on earth.
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:23.020]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.860]  expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:29.100]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.940]  powerful shadow state.
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:34.980]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:39.420]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:44.500]  Police cameras, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.500]  corner.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.740]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:50.780]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:51.780]  It's here.

[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:04.780]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:10.780]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms, 24 hours before a storm strikes people panic.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:14.180]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:19.380]  The food price stormed from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.780]  by the end of the summer.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.580]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?

[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.420]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.620]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:17.780]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:24.780]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:45.500]  Well, he's won multiple awards for news reporting for television, Emmys, and of course was a
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:50.700]  long-time talk show host, a top-rated talk show host there in Missouri.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:55.980]  And now, for the last 11 years or so, he has been the main weeknight host of Coast to Coast
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.980]  to Am, one of the highest-rated radio broadcasts in the world.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:05.020]  And he's a good friend of mine, and he's had a lot of courage to take that show 11 years
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.020]  ago.
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:08.460]  There was not a lot of this information out there in the media.
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:13.340]  I'd say Art Bell covered it maybe, you know, kind of New World Order constitutional libertarian
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:16.660]  issues 10% of the time, which I was very thankful for and was a riveting host.
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.140]  George Norrie, I'd say, does it about half the time.
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:22.060]  And then he gets into the other, you know, fun topics and things that give people thinking
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.300]  as well.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:27.380]  And that's why whenever I can catch it, I certainly like to tune in to George Norrie,
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:33.420]  but also all the other great hosts there with Coast to Coast AM.com, like John B. Wells
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:36.820]  and so many others, Coast to Coast AM.com.
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:39.420]  And he's on with us for the rest of the hour here today.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:44.060]  I wanted to get George on to get his take on the NSA spying, the IRS persecution of
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:50.780]  pro-lifers, libertarians, conservatives, the Snowden situation, the mysterious explosion
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.300]  death last Tuesday.
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:58.340]  Now we could go to day with Michael Hastings, one of the editors at Rolling Stone.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:05.100]  Now Richard Clark says Hastings accident consistent with a car cyber attack.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.540]  He said intelligence agencies know how to remotely seize control of a car.
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.540]  Yeah.
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:13.700]  That particular Mercedes, the computer takes over when it says you're not driving good.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.940]  They're going to make us have robot driven cars, folks.
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:16.940]  That's the plan.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:21.740]  Just like I told you 10 years ago, they'll make you take pills that report back wirelessly
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.060]  that you're taking them properly.
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.580]  That's Wall Street Journal.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:25.580]  Forget to take your meds.
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:27.540]  These pills will tell your doctor.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:32.380]  And if you're overtaking them, it'll tell your doctor.
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:36.860]  Everything I've talked about, everything George has talked about for, I don't know, 16, 17
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.740]  years on radio, 11 years on coast to coast to AM.
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:40.740]  It's now out in the open.
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:46.460]  So the question is, we've reached that critical crossroads where it's all coming out now that,
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:50.620]  okay, hydrofluorosalic acid, major Harvard studies does lower IQ, 20 points on average,
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:52.740]  does sevenfold increase in bone cancer.
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.780]  Why are they adding more of it than ever?
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:55.780]  Okay.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.980]  They are putting cancer viruses and vaccines.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:58.980]  Why?
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:10:59.980]  Okay.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:01.980]  The polio vaccine is sterilizing people in mass.
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:02.980]  Why?
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:03.980]  Okay.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.100]  Bill Gates says he wants to reduce world population.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:10.660]  Why is he pushing to make us eat GMO in studies that reduces fertility?
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:14.900]  I mean, it's just all coming out, everything.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:18.100]  And I don't mind becoming passé, but I'm not becoming passé.
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:22.940]  Instead, I am having, and George, I know, has been criticized as well, but ManCal has
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:23.940]  been criticized.
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.660]  He covers some of these issues, and he's now got a big history channel show coming out.
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.220]  George has got a big popular TV show.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:32.500]  Now it's like, they're bad because they don't like the NSA spying on them.
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.260]  And they're bad because they don't like FEMA camps being built.
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:40.380]  And they're bad because they don't want to fund al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria.
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:44.660]  So it's either, do we reverse the pendulum from tyranny back to liberty?
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.700]  Or is it like what happened in so many other countries?
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:52.260]  We go into the dark night, the dark winter of just, okay, we are now under a tyranny.
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:56.220]  Now they arrest journalists that talk to whistleblowers because folks, George has talked to a lot of
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.220]  whistleblowers.
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:00.500]  I've talked to a lot of whistleblowers.
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:04.980]  I mean, now I sit here and go, wow, I really talked to an NSA person.
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:11.100]  The other day, in my office, who I've, you know, worked for the Air Force Intelligence
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:13.780]  and the NSA.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.900]  And he said, I was told, it's Raymond Teague, is it coming next week?
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.220]  I was told, I'll be killed.
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:23.060]  This is in front of three of my reporters, if I ever talk about this.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:28.020]  Raymond Teague folks was on the Apollo mission on the front line as one of the main ground
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.460]  commanders of it.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.300]  He got a presidential freedom award.
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.500]  Was it from Ronald Reagan?
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.380]  I mean, you could see him on any show about Apollo.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:40.860]  You see Raymond Teague there, he was one of the main guys and mission control.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:44.420]  Before that, he worked for Air Force Intelligence and then after that, he worked for government
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:45.860]  agencies and classified stuff.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:49.380]  And he wouldn't tell me anything really classified, but he was shaking when he said this.
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:53.140]  He said, I was told at each graduation that I'd be killed.
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:56.340]  All of us were told, you will be killed if you talk about this.
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:13:03.660]  I mean, and they've now got Meet the Press saying arrest Greenwald of the Guardian and
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:06.380]  American because he talked to Edward Stoden.
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:08.260]  This is the chilling effect.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:10.980]  No one ever got arrested for reporting criminal spying.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:13.980]  It's illegal what goes on.
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:20.340]  And Raymond also told us, I'm going to go to George Norrie, Raymond also told us that,
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:25.660]  oh yeah, they saw the intelligence, the spying going on and then, yeah, of course the government
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.780]  was bringing in the narcotics.
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.020]  That's now public knowledge.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.620]  So George, you get where I'm going with this.
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:35.140]  What I want to ask you is, do you agree with me or what's your take on it?
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:39.500]  Have we reached the crossroads, the jump point, the event horizon here, I think really in
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:44.340]  just the next few years, the quickening where it's all out in the open and humanity has
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.740]  that choice.
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:50.180]  And we either wake up to how much trouble we're in and have courage to push the envelope
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:54.900]  and talk about this as you did, really is a trailblazer and I'm not kissing your hind
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:55.900]  in.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:56.900]  It's true.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:01.740]  We need other people to stand up like you did, George, and lead the way or I think we're
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:02.740]  doomed.
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:03.740]  George Norrie.
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:04.740]  Well, Alex, there's no question.
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:08.580]  You know, what you've been doing, what we've been doing on coast to coast, we've been
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:17.380]  trailblazers trying to wake up the American people that what's happening is just not right.
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:19.300]  It's just not normal.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:24.500]  And so other people, insiders like the Edward Snowden's and the Michael Hastings, these are
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:31.540]  people who said, you know what, we think enough is enough too and so they, working within
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:37.260]  that arena, decided to take matters in their own hands to do what they do.
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:38.860]  I don't know what's happening, Alex.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:46.820]  I don't know why this seems to be moving along so quickly, but ever since 9-11, it has just
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:53.780]  been roaring like a train out of control and we can see it in everything that's happening
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:54.780]  today.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:59.860]  Whether it's we want to control your guns, we want to know what you're doing on the internet,
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.420]  we want to know who you're sending text messages to.
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:08.540]  It's just totally out of control and I mean, they're even putting in little trips and pills
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:13.460]  so the good doctor can decide if you're taking your medication.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:16.180]  What business is it, you know, for him?
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:18.900]  That wirelessly transmits like you're a prisoner.
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:23.500]  Well, they use pharmacia to get us addicted and then they use that to now make us wireless
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:29.180]  prisoners with microchips in our intestines reporting back through the wireless internet.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:32.500]  I mean, this is, this is the technocratic takeover, George.
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:37.460]  Oh yeah, there's no doubt about it and it just, as I said, is just rolling along at
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:40.260]  a pace that is totally uncontrollable.
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:46.220]  I think something else is going on here, Alex, and that they feel is if they're out of time,
[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:48.140]  they've got to do this quickly.
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:50.420]  They've been doing this the last couple of years.
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:55.420]  You and I have felt them speed this up ever since that day where Zygman-Uberzinski was
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:03.940]  talking to CF Consulate for Relations people saying they're aware, meaning us people, we're
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:08.700]  aware of what they plan to do and we need to speed things up.
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:14.660]  Wow, that's chilling because then he wrote a book that came out last year and said, actually
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:18.540]  went and bought the book, he said, it's cheaper now to kill a million people than to just
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:20.380]  convince them with propaganda.
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:22.540]  The establishment, I agree with you, is panicking.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.540]  So what do we do, George?
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:27.820]  Well, we keep doing what we're doing because you can see what's happening worldwide.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:31.420]  Look at the uprising in Brazil.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.700]  Look at what's happening in Turkey.
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.380]  Look what's happened in the Middle East.
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:39.300]  People are beginning to say, enough is enough.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:45.660]  This isn't just the haves and the have nots, this is people, people who are just fed up
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:48.740]  with being controlled and they're fighting back.
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:54.260]  Now, through this entire thing, I find it so ironic where Edward Snowden, who I don't
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:58.700]  believe is a traitor, but I do believe that he is a hero for letting us know what was
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:06.660]  going on, it's bizarre that a communist nation like Russia would hide him and hold him.
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:10.140]  And that, to me, is the most baffling of this entire thing.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:16.660]  I mean, here we have a guy who releases information on the NSA to protect Americans, to protect
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:18.500]  our rights and our freedom.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:24.820]  And he's being protected by a country that oppresses freedom worse than anybody.
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:26.820]  It's bizarre.
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:35.140]  Man, George, I know you've got children and I believe even some grandchildren, don't you?
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:37.780]  Yes, I have six grandchildren.
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:41.420]  For people that haven't had children yet, I don't think they understand what clicks
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:46.460]  in your brain chemically, where you really start caring about the future and obviously
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:49.820]  your children and grandchildren a hundred times more than you care about yourself.
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:55.340]  I just can't get how the elite, with their kids, don't want a better world because there's
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:58.940]  no way they're going to get away with all this and not have blowback, George.
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.500]  No, there's no way they're going to get away with it.
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.180]  I mean, they just can't.
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:10.700]  I think one of the reasons, Alex, that they're speeding things up in every direction is that
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:17.220]  they know we've had enough and, you know, everything that they had planned is falling
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:24.580]  apart and I think that bothers them too, you know, the plans for the FEMA camps, the control.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:25.900]  I mean, it's been whittled away.
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:29.660]  I mean, look at that crazy rule about taking knives on planes.
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:35.980]  I was not in favor of that, come on, but the American public got so outraged about it,
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:41.540]  the flight attendants got so outraged about it, even some of the TSA people got outraged
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:46.020]  about it, they dropped it and I think that's what's starting to happen now.
[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:50.140]  People are starting to voice themselves saying, this is ludicrous, this is crazy.
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:54.420]  That's right, there's seven and a half billion of us and if we all start just doing little
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:19:00.060]  things, it'll move mountains, if we stop complying and start having our voice heard and start
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:06.420]  talking to the enforcers and saying, is this really the world you want?
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:15.700]  It is something that we will see by prediction in the next five years, such a dramatic change
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:18.700]  where we will be the winners.
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.100]  You won't believe it.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:28.380]  George Norris, our guest and I hope that he's right, I know this, we're going to govern
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.380]  what happens in the future.
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:36.460]  George, I've got a bunch of questions for you on the economy, on the IRS intimidation,
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:38.660]  new breaking Benghazi news.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:41.860]  I want to ask you about that, but we're about to go to break.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.900]  We're going to finally come back to what you want to talk about, I always love the wild
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:49.860]  card of what's front and center on George Norris' radar, so we'll speak to him and also
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:55.380]  he's coming to Canada this weekend to speak and he's going to have a surprise guest.
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:20:01.860]  So we'll tell you about that coming up as well, stay with us.
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:05.500]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.180]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:11.220]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.660]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:19.860]  The food price stormed from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:21.380]  by the end of the summer.
[01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:23.100]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?

[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:39.340]  to serve as debt.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:42.820]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:46.100]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:08.140]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:22.500]  a war on for your mind.
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:26.260]  I want to play a clip for George Norrie, Hustak Hustak Hustanian that's joining us as a guest
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:29.460]  right now and then get his take on it.
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:35.500]  This is David Gregory on Meet the Press to Glenn Greenwald who's a hero reporter in the
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:39.980]  past he would just be doing his job but now it's heroic when you've had so many reporters
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:45.620]  charged and arrested now along with whistleblowers for exposing corruption.
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:50.140]  If you expose the government murder now and whistleblow you go to jail and there's a huge
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:51.660]  chilling effect going on.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:58.180]  So Snowden exposes illegal spying, it's already known it's going on, he just points out what
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:02.260]  everybody already knows, you have the CIA director last year bragging about how your
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:08.100]  dishwashers watching you but he blows the whistle from the inside so they want to throw
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:12.380]  him in jail and they of course have indicted him and are following him around and here
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:17.940]  was Gregory, I remember the press, not even really remember the press, like a wolf saying
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:23.820]  you ought to be arrested for a reporter now talking to the whistleblower, unbelievable.
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:27.300]  This has never before happened in modern American history, here it is, I want George to take
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:28.700]  on it.
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:34.220]  To the extent that you have aided and abetted Snowden even in his current movements, why
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:42.180]  shouldn't you Mr. Greenwald be charged with a crime?
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:46.260]  I think it's pretty extraordinary that anybody who would call themselves a journalist would
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:51.380]  publicly muse about whether or not other journalists should be charged with felonies.
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:55.620]  The assumption in your question David is completely without evidence, the idea that I've aided
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:26:00.500]  and abetted him in any way, the scandal that arose in Washington before our stories began
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:05.140]  was about the fact that the Obama administration is trying to criminalize investigative journalism
[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:10.460]  by going through the emails and phone records of AP reporters accusing a Fox News journalist.
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:16.100]  George, you have interviewed countless whistleblowers, like you broke E. Howard Hunt's son who as a
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:21.220]  journalist brought forward the tapes and everything of his father admitting that he'd been involved
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:26.260]  in killing Kennedy in Dallas 50 years ago, that violates so-called national security.
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:28.340]  I mean, I guess should you be arrested?
[01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:31.740]  I interviewed him, should I be arrested?
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:37.980]  I was one of the last reporters to talk to Jimmy Hoffa, Alex back in 1975.
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:43.380]  I got him on one of my TV shows in Detroit and I was walking him to his car and he was
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:48.060]  telling me that he had planned to get back into the union, he wanted his presidency back.
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:54.180]  Even though the agreement with Nixon was that he wouldn't run for office anymore for his
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:55.180]  parole.
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:27:00.220]  I kind of looked at him and I'm saying to myself, this is a guy who was involved with
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:06.380]  the mob who financed through the Teamsters Union Pension Fund Vegas and now he wants
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:07.380]  to go straight.
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:14.380]  They're going to get this guy and sure enough a month or two later he was gone.
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:21.940]  The bottom line is that we as reporters have got to become sank or sank from anything else.
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:28.740]  I mean, we're not breaking laws when we're investigating, talking, and getting information.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:34.940]  We used to have a privilege a long time ago where the law enforcement came to us and said,
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:37.060]  who's the source of your story?
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:39.060]  We didn't have to tell them that.
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:44.220]  Now it's almost as if you must tell us who your sources are or you're going to jail,
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:49.540]  but it doesn't matter because we've been listening in on your phone calls and your emails anyway.
[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:52.620]  So we've got that information.
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:58.460]  It's appalling and I think what happened on Meet the Press was just as ridiculous.
[01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:05.780]  David Gregory trying to pretend that he's Mr. Holier than now, attacking another journalist
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:11.340]  who was merely the conduit for the story, he didn't do it, he didn't release the documents,
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:16.060]  he reported on it for the American people and for the world.
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:21.140]  And to accuse him of the aiding and abetting is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.140]  That's right.
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:26.020]  You've won three Emmys for news reporting.
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:33.540]  So you have been the consummate TV investigative journalist on record and so here you are as
[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:34.540]  a journalist.
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:38.340]  Did you ever think you'd see America get to the point where there's an open war on the
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:44.740]  press, on the Tea Party, on libertarian groups, on pro-lifers, where the IRS is telling Christians
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:45.740]  they can't pray?
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:47.980]  I mean, that's in the news.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.380]  This is authoritarianism.
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:53.620]  We woke up, it's here, and are we going to lay down to it is the question.
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:55.540]  I agree with Hastings.
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:59.700]  It's time for the press to line up and go against this corrupt system.
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:00.700]  Absolutely.
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:04.140]  But then what happens, look, we don't know what happened to Michael Hastings.
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:07.740]  Was he speeding along, did he get into an accident?
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:13.340]  Maybe, but it sure is coincidental, and I don't believe in coincidences, that here's
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:18.700]  a guy who was telling his friends, you know, you may be contacted by the FBI, who felt
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:24.260]  that he was being investigated by the FBI, who said, I've got a major story.
[01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:26.780]  Some people think it had to do with drones and surveillance.
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:28.900]  And all of a sudden, the guy died.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:30.540]  I mean, come on.
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:33.180]  Two hours after he says, I'm going off the radar.
[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:34.180]  Absolutely.
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:36.260]  He went off the radar, didn't he?
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:40.980]  Yeah, he sure, his engine went off the radar too, 60 yards down the street.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:46.660]  George Norris, our guest, long segment coming up, we'll get into all of the key news and
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:48.140]  Hastings straight ahead.
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.220]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:53.980]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:30:00.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:04.660]  Are we choosing our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:08.820]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:10.540]  of information.
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:17.220]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:18.220]  psyche.
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:23.700]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:27.300]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:32.020]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.860]  it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:37.460]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:42.380]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:44.380]  but demand a war.
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:47.220]  Oh, there's another one, another plane just passed.
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:49.820]  State of mind, because there's a war on.
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:50.820]  Or your mind.

[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:35.660]  leave the silver at the surface.
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:40.740]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:46.420]  of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:48.300]  effectively.

[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:46.780]  We're finishing up the new studio.
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:49.660]  We're getting our reporters in place and up to speed.
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:54.660]  The crew, I'm preparing to put the show out on cable systems and satellite.
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:58.500]  All of this is because of your subscribing to PrismPlanet.tv.
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.740]  If you haven't subscribed, it is $5.95 a month.
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:08.500]  One membership can be logged on to simultaneously by 11 people, you and 10 other people.
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.740]  So create a username and passcode, it takes about a minute.
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:17.180]  That is unique to PrismPlanet.tv or infowarsnews.com, it will take you there as well.
[01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:21.660]  And then share it with, I think you can do it with 20 or 30 friends and family because
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:26.460]  most of them won't tune in every night when the show comes on at 7 or go to the archive
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:27.460]  simultaneously.
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:31.940]  And if you try to log in and you can't, that means 11 people actually used it, thank God.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.940]  Go buy another membership for yourself.
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:38.340]  I mean, you don't just buy a gift membership and then one person can use it.
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:44.700]  You get a PrismPlanet.tv membership and 11 people can simultaneously use it and see the
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:48.460]  nightly news, the archives of all the shows in high death.
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:53.100]  All of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, so many films that we've made, films we've
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:58.460]  been authorized to post, we're going to premiere state of mind that I'm in that explodes the
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:04.820]  mind control agenda and I don't just mean MKUltra type stuff, but the ambient globalist
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:10.460]  programming, all of that, all of that is going to premiere.
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:15.660]  That film with the filmmakers who are going to be in town in a four-hour special transmission
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:20.260]  coming up Wednesday the 17th of July in just a few weeks.
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:26.140]  I mean, that's the type of stuff that goes on at PrismPlanet.tv and it's awesome because
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:31.540]  we've had 300 plus thousand people tune in to PrismPlanet.tv in one day and watch the
[01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:36.860]  show when it's election coverage or 100,000 tune in when it's Bilderberg coverage because
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:39.380]  people are sharing those pass codes.
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:41.900]  That's operation, waking the sleeping giant.
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:46.900]  So if you currently have a membership, share it and if you don't have a membership or were
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:50.340]  a member in the past, we've just upgraded it, made it better and better, please become
[01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:57.260]  a member and I want to thank all of the PrismPlanet.tv members for being part of PrismPlanet.tv
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:36:01.580]  because between that and InfoWarsHealth.com and the incredible products and the films,
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:07.540]  the t-shirts, the books, the advertising, that's how we have been able to build the largest
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:13.460]  multi-platform alternative media system in the world and shows like Coast to Coast with
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:17.300]  George Norrie have helped us, people like Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com have helped
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:18.300]  us.
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:19.300]  We've all got to hang together.
[01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:24.500]  That's why when they went after Rush Limbaugh last year and we're trying to get him kicked
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:28.220]  off the air going after his sponsors, twisting what he said and did.
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:30.700]  Even though I don't agree with everything Rush says, even though Rush has criticized
[01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:32.140]  me before, it didn't matter.
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:37.020]  If they can take him down, folks, they can take down talk radio because it's long form.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.020]  It's not talking points.
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:41.620]  Radio's not getting talking points, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:43.500]  It's really what people are into.
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.300]  It's what you call in with.
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.140]  The globalists can't control it.
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:50.620]  Look, top shows on TV have 3 million viewers.
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:52.540]  George Norrie has 16 million a week.
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:57.780]  We have all together one way or another 15 million people that tune in one way or another.
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:03.180]  On radio, it's about 6, 7 million a week on actual terrestrial radio, 15 million now,
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:04.340]  a week, one way or another.
[01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:06.260]  That's very conservative, by the way.
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:08.540]  YouTube, everything.
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:11.340]  That's what scares the system.
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:12.340]  Think about it.
[01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:13.340]  We are the biggest media.
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:18.300]  We're not all fancy pants and we don't have all the money of 500 million a year or something
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:20.660]  to run MSNBC.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:25.660]  We're running this whole operation on $7 million a year and the media is like, ooh, look at
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:26.820]  all the money Alex makes.
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:33.220]  I'm spending 100 plus percent right now to finish all this and try to launch.
[01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:35.420]  I'm spending our reserves right now.
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:40.060]  $7 million a year, folks, and I'm actually glad I'm spending all the money that's coming
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:41.060]  in.
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:42.060]  Okay?
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:46.260]  I mean, because I'm doing this with what you support us with, this is expensive.
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:49.540]  My bandwidth is now $650,000 a year.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:51.780]  We just checked the last 12 months' numbers.
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:53.900]  IT is on top of that.
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:56.180]  It is expensive to be doing this.
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:38:00.660]  It's expensive to have a free video feed for the daytime viewers at infowars.com forward
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:03.820]  slash show, but we've gotten sponsors to pay for most of it.
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:04.820]  So support our sponsors.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:08.660]  Now, I want to get into a bunch of issues and take calls all over the map with George
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:14.140]  Norrie, Paul, Joshua, Joseph, David, Karen, Paul's been holding the longest along with
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:15.140]  Joseph.
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.140]  We're going to get to you.
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:18.660]  George Norrie's our guest here, but George has expanded.
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:22.660]  He's doing a very popular TV show at GeorgeNorrieLive.com.
[01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:27.340]  He's doing speaking engagements all over the place, and it's important to support what
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:29.700]  George is doing as well.
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:37.460]  And I'm going to be on with him, and it's being sponsored by AM640 up in Canada, and
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:43.460]  I want George to tell everybody about this very exciting event that is close to selling
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:46.780]  out in this giant theater and the people that are going to be there.
[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:49.060]  You've got George and two other physical guests.
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:50.260]  They probably won't let me into Canada.
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:51.260]  They barely did last time.
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:54.860]  That's why I'm not going to be there, but I'll be there via Skype as well to kick it
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:55.860]  off.
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:39:01.660]  So, tell us about this historic event that's coming up in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:06.500]  It's going to be exciting, Alex, that this coming Saturday, I'll be in Toronto at the
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:12.500]  Queen Elizabeth Theater doing a major event with a little entertainment, which I'll explain
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:17.980]  in a second, but David Hatcher Childress will be with us talking about ancient mysteries,
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:23.780]  Richard Dolan talking about the UFO disclosure, and of course, you'll be joining us live as
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:29.100]  you just said via Skype on a huge screen before a packed house.
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:33.220]  They've still got some tickets available, and if anybody's interested in the greater
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:42.660]  Toronto, New York area, just go to GeorgeNoryLive.com and O-O-R-Y, GeorgeNoryLive.com, and come
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:48.100]  on by and see us, and my mother is coming up from Detroit, according to my sister.
[01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:53.740]  She's never seen me in a live event, and she's all excited, and part of the caveat
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:59.700]  is, I'm going to be singing some songs there, you know, part-time for fun, you know, we
[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:04.260]  all have our own little hobbies, and so I'm going to turn it into an entertainment venue
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:08.980]  as well, so it's about a three-hour event, and I'm really looking forward to it.
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:13.620]  Toronto's a great city, and I've got to tell you, Alex, our Canadian brothers and sisters
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:20.060]  just admire what we as Americans do, and you know, they're in the trenches with us.
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:24.020]  They were in World War II, and they still are now.
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:27.780]  Well I know your events are amazing, I've been to a few of them to overflow crowds here
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:30.940]  in Austin, and I want to thank you for inviting me up there, and thank you for letting me
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:34.860]  just be part of it via Skype, tell me about some of the other guests that are going to
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:35.860]  be there.
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:39.540]  Well, David Hatcher Childress, of course, the expert in ancient mysteries, so he's going
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:44.460]  to be on with me, just talking about some of the great mysteries and the bizarre things
[01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:46.940]  that have happened on this planet for years.
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:54.380]  Richard Dolan is an expert on government secrecy, and of course he specializes in the UFO search,
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:58.900]  and then we've got Alex Jones, who's going to talk with us about NSA and about world
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:02.660]  rule rights and everything else, and that's going to be fun.
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:08.500]  You're going to have an audience of maybe 900 to 1,000 people watching you on this
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:13.780]  big screen, and I'll be standing up next to it talking to you via Skype.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:17.220]  Absolutely, and I'm going to be there via Skype, next time you're on, George, I want
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:19.140]  you to get on Skype as well.
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:23.860]  And also, you may be on Coast to Coast tonight for a couple hours, the first couple hours,
[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:24.860]  right?
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:25.860]  Absolutely, you just invited me during the break.
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:27.860]  Yes, sir, I'd love to come on and talk about all these issues.
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:29.380]  Okay, we'll do that.
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:30.780]  Fantastic, no rest for the...
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:33.660]  I don't feel too wicked, though, it's no rest for liberty lovers.
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:34.660]  No rest at all.
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:35.660]  We don't stop.
[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:42.260]  You know, last Friday, right before Saturday, I had put in 20 straight days in a row in
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:43.260]  the work.
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:44.260]  And you know what?
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:45.260]  I'm not tired.
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:46.260]  I'm energetic.
[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:47.260]  I keep going.
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:53.100]  When it's all said and done, I would have put in 40 days out of 42.
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:55.300]  But you know, we have to do that now, Alex.
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:57.340]  We don't stop, do we?
[01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:01.820]  Well, I'm only exhausted when I'm not working, and I think my dad says, well, that's what
[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:03.940]  happens when you're burnout, son.
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:08.540]  You got to keep working because if you stop, I guess they almost call that post-traumatic
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:09.940]  where you've done...
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:10.940]  You work so hard.
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:15.500]  I know a lot of doctors have that, where then when they finally try to relax, it's like
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:16.500]  you're exhausted.
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:18.020]  I think that's what's going on, George.
[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:19.540]  Yeah, I think so, too.
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:21.540]  When you stop, that's when you pass out.
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:27.540]  So you got to just keep going like the ever-ready bunny, and the energizer, and just keep going.
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:30.420]  You know, there are so many stories.
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:34.940]  Promise me you'll come on in a month or so for an hour to talk about George Norrie, because
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:38.700]  you never really talk about yourself, and then you're like, oh yeah, I knew Jimmy Hoffa.
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:42.580]  You've got so many interesting stories I hear when you tell them occasionally, but not often
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:47.980]  enough about your decades as being a top TV investigative journalist.
[01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:49.420]  Just really interesting stuff.
[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:53.660]  What's the craziest thing that you ever saw or witnessed as a TV news journalist?
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:43:00.180]  Oh, I've done some things that I can't mention on the air, but there have been a lot of strange
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:02.220]  things that have happened over the years, Alex.
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:07.380]  I mean, whether there were calls in the coast to coast, I remember a lady who called me one
[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:09.940]  day and said, George, you're not going to believe this.
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:15.580]  My husband, who never comes home late, was abducted by aliens, and I said, oh my God,
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:16.580]  is he okay?
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:21.980]  She said, yeah, he came home nervous and sweaty and shaking, and I said, so he told you, you
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:22.980]  got abducted?
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:23.980]  And she said, yeah.
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:25.820]  And I said, well, what else happened?
[01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:28.260]  She said, these aliens, do you know what they did to him?
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:30.940]  And I'm going, oh my God, probes, what?
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:34.500]  And she said, they took his wedding ring off.
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:40.580]  So the poor guy spent the night out, right, probably playing around, forgot to put his
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:41.580]  ring on.
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:42.580]  Said aliens did it.
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:43.580]  And aliens did it.
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:44.580]  She fell for it.
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:51.180]  So, I mean, we get all kinds on coast to coast, and in my TV arena, you know, I was generally
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:52.780]  a pretty hard news guy.
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:58.460]  You know, I covered things, you know, six people murdered in Detroit, you know, I was
[01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:04.220]  there at the drug house while they were carting these people out, you know, I mentioned Jimmy
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.220]  Hoffa.
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:09.460]  So, you know, I interviewed George McGovern during the presidential race.
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:12.220]  I mean, I go way, way back.
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:14.020]  Absolutely, George.
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:16.300]  You have seen a lot.
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.460]  We're going to go to some phone calls here in a little while.
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:19.460]  They're all over the map.
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.220]  We have Karen, who says she's a retired NSA worker.
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:28.340]  Paul wants to talk about current events, chemicals and rivers in the environment, Joshua, Joseph
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:31.540]  wants to talk about government harassment, David wants to talk about Man of Steel movie.
[01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:33.820]  Hey, have you seen the Man of Steel movie, George?
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:35.140]  No, I have not.
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:36.140]  I have not.
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:40.460]  Normally what I do, Alex, is I wait until these things come out on the DVD, and then
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:42.980]  I watch them in the comforts of the house.
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:43.980]  I hear you.
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:49.540]  I'm not a big fan of the kind of comic book genre, but I thought it really had a wholesome
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:55.460]  anti-New World Order, anti-authoritarianism, anti-eugenics message, and I'm seeing more
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:58.020]  and more positive stuff out of Hollywood.
[01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:00.500]  People actually say, what are you getting paid to promote these movies?
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.500]  No.
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:05.460]  If you want something positive, I want to give it attention instead of just only covering
[01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:06.460]  the negative.
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:12.500]  The Supreme Court, I think, ruled right that companies can't patent your genes and then
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:15.220]  not let anybody else do research on it.
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:16.220]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:20.940]  I mean, some things the court does do some things that are right, and sometimes they
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:22.820]  do some things that aren't.
[01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:26.900]  I haven't had time to analyze the ruling yet, but what do you think of the Supreme Court
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:29.860]  striking down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act today?
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.860]  Well, that's an interesting situation.
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:38.300]  The Voting Rights Act, which was passed during the Civil Rights Era, tried to protect states
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:39.300]  and things like that.
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:45.500]  I have not jumped into it as well, so I can't say if it's a good or bad thing, but it's
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:52.220]  interesting that some 40 years later, they jump on board to change it.
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:53.660]  I wonder why.
[01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:55.660]  Plus, it's kind of schizophrenic.
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:46:00.700]  They said a week ago, oh, Arizona can't demand IDs to vote.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:05.820]  And then now they say that they're not going to have the feds harassing the states.
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:06.820]  It's just bizarre.
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:12.780]  I'd like to see the right to not have an electronic voting machine proven to be a fraud.
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:15.220]  I'd like to see a right to go back to paper ballots.
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.220]  Well, I would too.
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:22.500]  You know, Beth Harris, a black box voting, she has been a proponent, a staunch proponent
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:27.700]  against these electronic voting machines, and there's no question that the NSA has the
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:32.020]  ability to tap into everything we do electronically.
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:37.420]  Who's to say that they one day can't rig an election, and even though a lot of us suspect
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:42.180]  Hanky Panky has gone on, that they just simply change everything, you know?
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:44.980]  And everything's going through these various companies.
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:52.300]  I think there's a company in Spain that owns a pretty sizable electronic voting net company
[01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:53.300]  here in the United States.
[01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:56.020]  It was a Tampa based company that they bought.
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:57.020]  Oh, yeah.
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:47:02.180]  Back when Senator Hagel first got in, I didn't believe it when the news when it said that
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:06.780]  he owned 91% of the company that almost all votes were counted on.
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:08.580]  And then it was confirmed.
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:12.740]  And it's like, oh, what's wrong with having me owning the company you vote on that's designed
[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:14.540]  where people can go in and change the vote?
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:17.340]  I mean, it is just insane to see this going on.
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:20.740]  I want to bring up Hastings again and then go to these phone calls, George, and bring
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:23.500]  up any other important breaking news that you think is important.
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:26.380]  But I wanted to play the clip of him on the young Turks.
[01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:30.700]  I think it was Sink Erics, how you pronounce if he's been on this show, interesting guy.
[01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:33.660]  One of the better liberals out there in my view.
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:37.900]  A week before his car blows up or runs into a tree or whatever, and he says, I'm on the
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:38.900]  run there after me.
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:40.220]  I'm going to break the big story.
[01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:45.660]  And then boom, two hours later, this is what he said about the press lining up together
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:46.900]  for freedom in this country.
[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:47.900]  And I agree.
[01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:49.860]  And I haven't heard a lot of media talk like this.
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:52.900]  I've heard you talk like this, I've talked like this.
[01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:56.140]  That's why I really salute people that do have the courage to do this.
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:58.700]  And I think the press should investigate what happened to Hastings.
[01:47:58.700 --> 01:47:59.700]  Here's that clip.
[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:00.700]  We'll get George's take on it.
[01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:04.500]  The Obama administration has clearly declared war on the press.
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:08.020]  It's declared war on investigative journalists, our sources.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:12.660]  I think the only recourse to this kind of behavior by the government is to say back
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:15.580]  to the government, we declare war on you.
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:19.900]  And from this point forward, we should no longer, as a media as a whole, cooperate in
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:25.180]  any manner with the government in terms of when we're doing national security stories.
[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:29.060]  We should withdraw all our cooperation, and we should publish everything we know, because
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:30.060]  it's a free press.
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:33.100]  It's not a free except for when the government tells me to do it for us.
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:36.020]  And it will be way too easy going with these guys.
[01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:37.780]  We've let them get away with this for years.
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:39.880]  We've let them tell us what to print, what not to print.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:43.480]  And I say be done with it, and everybody should just get together and fire back, because
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:45.820]  no one else is going to defend the press.
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:46.820]  That's right.
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:48.700]  No one else is going to defend the press.
[01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:50.260]  And that's what America is based on.
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:54.820]  We always group about Russia and China and Mexico persecuting the press like this.
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:58.900]  I mean, this should get, this should really wake everybody up and get the lapdog media
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:48:59.900]  to stop groveling.
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:03.620]  Instead, I've been seeing numbers that they're saying there's even more groveling by the
[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:04.620]  press.
[01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:06.820]  And David Gregory saying, arrest the press.
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:08.060]  That guy's not the press.
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:09.860]  He should be out of there right now.
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:10.860]  Yeah.
[01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:11.860]  Absolutely.
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:15.220]  And the journalist to say that is crazy.
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:20.180]  And you know, he should be relieved of his duties.
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:21.180]  He really should.
[01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:22.940]  Well, I mean, the press should drum him out.
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:26.820]  I mean, if he goes to the National Press Club, everybody should turn their back and not talk
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:27.820]  to him.
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:28.820]  I mean, really, until he apologizes.
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:29.820]  Oh, even an apology is stupid.
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:34.820]  I mean, here's one thing about an apology, Alex.
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:39.420]  You know, somebody does something stupid or horrendous, and then they come out and say,
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:40.420]  well, I apologize.
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:43.940]  They're only apologizing because the heat's on them.
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:46.740]  Whatever they did, it's still in their system.
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:50.660]  David Gregory is not going to stop feeling the way he feels.
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:51.660]  Yeah.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.660]  I mean, who is he?
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:54.180]  A stooge for the government?
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:55.180]  I mean, unbelievable.
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:50:03.180]  I mean, as a journalist, to attack another journalist for investigative reporting and
[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:09.660]  for releasing a story that affects so many people worldwide and then chastising the guy
[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:11.820]  is abominable.
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:16.900]  I'm glad you see it that way, because that's exactly how I see it as a media person.
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:17.900]  Where's a small journalist at?
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:21.500]  You were a big journalist at in your earlier incarnations, but more of an analyst now,
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:22.500]  I would say.
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:27.580]  I mean, all of us are analysts, and it's just outrageous that we've seen bipartisan members
[01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:30.380]  of Congress talk like this.
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:33.620]  These guys are out of control, and the press needs to understand something.
[01:50:33.620 --> 01:50:36.940]  If we all start standing up, they can't stop us all.
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:41.020]  But if we let them pick us all off one-to-one, our children have no future.
[01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:43.500]  George Norris, our guest, they will sell out.
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:46.420]  The tickets, I'm told, are very close to selling out.
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:52.700]  You can go to the website that will give you after the break and get tickets to his big
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:51:01.700]  Toronto event, georgeNorrisLive.com, georgeNorrisLive.com, 4PM box office opens, 5PM doors open.

[01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:04.580]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:05.580]  Box.
[01:52:05.580 --> 01:52:08.540]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:13.340]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:17.660]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:23.220]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:28.300]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:33.420]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:34.420]  normal cell.
[01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:38.260]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:42.340]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:50.260]  Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:57.660]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUS-FLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[01:52:57.660 --> 01:53:00.300]  Protect your immune system, it's the only one you've got.
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:04.380]  When you need it the most, will your generator power equipment or vehicle be ready?
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:08.980]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored, and more than half of generator failures during
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:11.860]  disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:15.820]  PRI fuel stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:20.820]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and Ships at Sea rely on PRI fuel
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:22.980]  stabilizers and you can too.
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:29.860]  Call 888-776-9373 or visit PRIproducts.com to find the dealer nearest you.
[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:34.020]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:38.220]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:39.220]  to service debt.
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:43.180]  Capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency
[01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:45.980]  is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:50.300]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book, explains our monetary system.
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:53.500]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237.
[01:53:53.500 --> 01:54:19.980]  It's time to understand the system, call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:28.940]  I tell you, it's awesome having George Norrie on with us.
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:34.020]  I just, I gotta say it, I admire people that have courage and the direction that George
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:37.820]  Norrie took coast to coast to AM has just been phenomenal.
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:41.740]  We take for granted 11 years later that so much of this stuff's out in the open.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:46.420]  He is a trailblazer, coasttocoastam.com and some people can say, oh, they get into some
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:47.420]  wild stuff.
[01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:48.420]  I don't want it.
[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:52.180]  I don't want people thinking, and that's a healthy thing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:56.580]  And George, you know, has people like me on there to unvarnish to say whatever I want,
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:00.660]  breaking it down because George knows I'll have facts and documents behind what I'm saying.
[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:04.860]  So very, very important, be sure and go to his event, georgenorrielive.com in Toronto
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:09.620]  this Saturday, 6 p.m. event begins and runs past 9.
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:11.340]  I want to go right to phone calls.
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:16.980]  Karen in Arizona says she spoke with a retired NSA worker, to be clear.
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:20.260]  And Karen, what does this NSA worker tell you you're on the air with George Norrie?
[01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:25.980]  Well, I mentioned to him, and thank you for allowing me to talk to you and George.
[01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:26.980]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:32.780]  As a town hall meeting before it started, I was talking to this gentleman, and I said,
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:39.460]  I'm glad Snowden came out and admitted that NSA was spying on American people.
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:46.220]  And this guy says, he says, I worked for NSA for 30 years and I retired from the NSA.
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:49.180]  He never spied, did the mess, spying.
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:54.980]  And I said, well, according to Russell Tice, I said he would, I said, you know, Russell
[01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:55.980]  Tice, he said yes.
[01:55:55.980 --> 01:56:00.180]  I said, he did terrestrial and he said, yes, they did.
[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:04.980]  Well, ma'am, ma'am, listen, I'm going to get George's take on this, but it's on record.
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:06.820]  Everything goes through the NSA.
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:07.820]  It's on record.
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:11.140]  He may have been compartmentalized where they were doing foreign intelligence because large
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:15.140]  portions of it are that because it's all very compartmentalized.
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:19.060]  They don't know what's going on next door to them, or it may not have been an NSA person
[01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:20.060]  either.
[01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:24.780]  For someone to say now, we never spied domestically, it's like saying the sun didn't come up this
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:25.780]  morning.
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:26.780]  George Norring.
[01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:30.300]  Well, probably during his zero or two as well, Alex, they probably didn't have the technical
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:36.020]  capability to spy on all of us like they do now, so he might have been right telling
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:40.980]  her, hey, we didn't do that because they didn't have the ability to do it.
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:44.620]  Now they do, and they're using it like crazy.
[01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:45.820]  Absolutely.
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:46.820]  Thank you for the call, ma'am.
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:50.500]  I mean, just look, just because somebody says they're with the CIA or the NSA does not mean
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:51.500]  they are.
[01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:54.620]  Okay, most people that actually have been in it are not going to tell you.
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:58.140]  Let's go to a call from Joshua.
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:56:59.820]  Joshua, you're on the air with George Norring.
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:00.820]  Go ahead.
[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:01.820]  Hello, Alex.
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:02.820]  Hey, buddy.
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:03.820]  Hello, George Norring.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:04.820]  Hey, Josh.
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:08.100]  It was great to be on the air with you guys.
[01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:10.540]  Yeah, I love both your shows.
[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:11.540]  Thank you.
[01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:14.860]  Thank you both for waking me up.
[01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:18.780]  And what I was going to talk about was I've seen on the InfoWars nightly news about Fort
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:25.820]  McClellan and Monsanto, which I live very close to here, and the DU there that was used
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:31.460]  on Fort McClellan and people not knowing about it, Monsanto is really just right down
[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:32.460]  the road from it.
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:36.420]  Oh, yeah, the dioxin, the dioxin, they were involved in that.
[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:39.340]  They incinerated a lot of chemical weapons there, too.
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:42.060]  One mile from the incinerator.
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:43.060]  Yeah.
[01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:44.060]  One mile.
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:45.060]  But, yeah, the...
[01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:48.060]  Do you have a question for George, brother?
[01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:50.060]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:55.540]  George, what do you think about all these rivers and streams and everything being poisoned
[01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:57.300]  and they can't, they're nothing about it.
[01:57:57.300 --> 01:58:00.580]  They didn't even find out about it until about the early 90s.
[01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:02.940]  People knew they were doing it, but it wasn't covered by the pressure.
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:03.940]  Good question, George.
[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:04.940]  Take us out to break.
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:06.260]  You're doing five more minutes graciously.
[01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:09.380]  What's your take on the fact that they go after environmental stuff that isn't bad,
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:10.700]  but then ignore all the real stuff?
[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:14.860]  I know, and they should be looking at the real stuff, the hard dumping by corporations
[01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:16.860]  and all this other junk.
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:22.500]  You know, look, don't get me started on fluoride either, because you talk about poison in the
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:26.340]  water system, that's it.
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:27.580]  And we've got to get it out of our water.
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:30.260]  I mean, all these Harvard studies, you name it, and it's still in there.
[01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:33.700]  Five more minutes with George Norring, and then we're going to have in studio Sheriff
[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:37.580]  Richard Mack on solutions and a ton of news, and your phone calls as well.
[01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:41.540]  Stay with us back in 60 seconds.

[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:47.540]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:50.980]  This is something I taped once a month for shows, Alex.
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:53.020]  I'd love to get you up there as a guest.
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:55.020]  We taped in Denver.
[02:00:55.020 --> 02:00:56.020]  And they air it.
[02:00:56.020 --> 02:00:57.740]  It's an internet-based show.
[02:00:57.740 --> 02:01:04.020]  The company is called GuyMTV, and they just wanted to get into television in a big way,
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:05.460]  and it's like Netflix.
[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:11.660]  They charge a nominal monthly fee, but they also have access to thousands of self-help
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:12.660]  videos.
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:19.660]  They bought by Vendee from Universal, and they provide all that for a little fee every
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:20.660]  month.
[02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:26.140]  Hey, you tell me when, and I'll set it up with Tom, the great producer of that show,
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:31.100]  and Coast, of course, along with Lisa Lyon, and I would love to come anytime you'd like.
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:32.100]  I love Denver.
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:37.900]  If anybody wants info on the TV show, just go to our website, coast-to-coast-am.com.
[02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:43.300]  You click Host at the top, and then it just opens up the TV icon is there.
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:45.380]  We've got it on screen for viewers as well.
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:46.380]  Let's real quick.
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:47.380]  Paul in Florida.
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:48.880]  Then we'll go to Joseph.
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:49.880]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:50.880]  Quick question for George.
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:51.880]  Yeah.
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:52.880]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:53.880]  First time caller.
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:56.380]  I just wanted to thank you, sir, for waking me up.
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:58.340]  I know you don't like to hear it.
[02:01:58.340 --> 02:02:02.500]  And as far as George, I'd like to articulate on the first part of the segment when you
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:09.100]  talked about how the New World Order has kind of rushed things and put everything, the whole
[02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:14.100]  plan into perspective, and kind of rushing it in now, because it's almost like they are
[02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:15.460]  sort of bleeding out.
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:22.340]  The more we wake up, the more people we wake up, it seems like they are rushing things
[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:23.340]  with AI.
[02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:27.620]  I'm trying to figure out, because I have kids and so forth, it's like I'm trying to figure
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:32.620]  out how fast it's going to be before they implement the AI robotics, you know, Google's
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:34.060]  coming out with its own glasses.
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:36.900]  They're trying to get this takeover in as fast as they can.
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:37.900]  And it's so criminal.
[02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:43.300]  I mean, now it's in the news, like, is it good that you're smart TVs watching you?
[02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:49.260]  Not, oh my God, it's 1984, it's like, oh, all the crazies were right.
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:52.420]  But again, I guess we end the interview, George, as we started it.
[02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:53.420]  This is crazy.
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:54.420]  We're at the crossroads.
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:58.980]  They are panicking, Alex, and part of the problem with this, when we talk about the
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:05.580]  New World Order, you were in the United Kingdom at the Bilderberg, just a few weeks ago.
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:09.580]  These are groups of people, and people say, who are these people?
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:11.140]  Well, it's obvious.
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:13.620]  They're people who have so much wealth.
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:19.060]  I mean, you know, just today they just revealed a report that 70% of the Americans are living
[02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:21.100]  paycheck to paycheck.
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:22.620]  These people never got paychecks.
[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:28.340]  This is family money handed down over the eons, and they've got so much wealth.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:30.060]  I'm talking billions of dollars.
[02:03:30.060 --> 02:03:31.060]  They're playing God.
[02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:32.060]  They're bored.
[02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:33.060]  They're bored.
[02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:38.180]  So what they do is they do the next thing, and, you know, believe me, if you watch Eyes
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:42.860]  Wide Shut, the Stanley Kubrick movie, you'll see some of the things that they do.
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:43.860]  That's what they really do.
[02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:44.860]  That's what they do.
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:45.860]  They're bored.
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:46.860]  Yeah.
[02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:47.860]  But this is a game for them.
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:52.340]  This is world domination, and they're having a great time doing it.
[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:57.580]  I'm sure they've got offices to go to, and they sit back, and they go, how can we scheme
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:03:58.580]  to do this?
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:03:59.580]  What's that?
[02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:03.100]  I mean, it came out of the Bill of Melinda Gates, met with all the world leaders secretly
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:07.940]  again in the U.S. two weeks before Bilderberg to reduce world population, and then he's
[02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:09.500]  the guy going, by the way, I have a shot for you.
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:11.900]  I want you to die, but I want to reduce population.
[02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:17.100]  I mean, it's so incredibly obvious, and we've just got to wake up to it, and that's happening.
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:20.300]  George, I will see you what in the first two hours of coast tonight?
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:23.220]  I'll see you at midnight central time tonight on Coast to Coast.

[02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:32.860]  and free humanity.

[02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:40.020]  I believe he's here.
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:41.020]  Yeah, there he is out there.

[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:47.740]  He's here right now, Sheriff Richard Mack, good friend of mine, always good to see him
[02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:52.780]  in person, like a Clark Kent type guy and he's here with us, he of course took it all
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:58.580]  the way to the Supreme Court, the Brady Bill being unconstitutional and beat it.
[02:08:58.580 --> 02:09:02.540]  One of the biggest Second Amendment victories we've ever had and he's in the NRA Hall of
[02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:06.860]  Fame, sheriffmack.com, he's the best-selling author, he's making a film right now.
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:11.460]  Right now about getting the sheriffs and local police to wake up and take our counties
[02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:15.460]  and cities back and that is the answer, we're going to get into all of that at the bottom
[02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:22.940]  of the hour and Paul in Florida and Joseph and David and empty Congress and Mike, we're
[02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:27.260]  going to get to all of your calls as well in any issue because he's also been a talk
[02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:28.620]  show host off and on his own right.
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:33.660]  He can speak to those issues but I want to cover the waterfront with Sheriff Richard
[02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:38.980]  Mack because he's gone to Arizona to work with the cold case posse, there's no doubt
[02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:43.380]  we don't know who Obama really is, there's no doubt those are fake bar certificates,
[02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:46.420]  we just don't know what exactly it means.
[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:50.580]  Very bizarre but he's been working on that, we're going to get his take on that but first
[02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:55.060]  off we've gone from being called kooks talking about NSA spying because it had come out before
[02:09:55.060 --> 02:09:59.740]  and kooks about the IRS harassing conservatives and libertarians to it all being admitted
[02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:04.220]  to, it now coming out that indeed they are building FEMA camps, they are training to
[02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:09.380]  confiscate guns, that they have Army manuals on quote reeducation centers using the Soviet
[02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:15.220]  term, I mean it even blows me away that they're really this evil and corrupt and trying to
[02:10:15.220 --> 02:10:20.980]  just hide it in plain view and get the police and military to go along with all the dramas,
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:25.580]  all the sitcoms, all the movies where the gun owners are the terrorists and the patriots
[02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:26.940]  are going to kill everybody.
[02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:30.980]  I think it's, I don't think, I know it's back lashing but I want to get your take just
[02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:36.020]  in general where you think the state of the country is right now and why the globalist,
[02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:39.440]  because we were talking about this last hour with George Norrie, everybody agrees they
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:44.460]  are accelerating the whole program and I think we're in a danger that if it all comes
[02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:49.660]  out in the open and then nobody gets in trouble it just sets the precedent and now we, okay
[02:10:49.660 --> 02:10:55.500]  we know we're slaves but we're slaves, instead of it boomeranging and kind of swinging the
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:59.620]  pendulum back and then I'm concerned if we start swinging the pendulum back they're going
[02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:00.620]  to false flag.
[02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:05.260]  So, Sheriff Mack here to film and do interviews for Obama Deception too, great to have you
[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:09.460]  here my friend, you heard that general breakdown I just laid out, what is your state of the
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:12.180]  union take on that for our viewers?
[02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:18.060]  Well, it's amazing that a lot of this got put off until after the re-election of Mr.
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:22.980]  Obama and you're right, we don't know who he is, we don't know where he's from, I'm
[02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:28.740]  not positive that he knows, sometimes when we get into that, there's so much going on
[02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:35.460]  and isn't it wonderful though to have the endorsement of the federal government that
[02:11:35.460 --> 02:11:39.100]  the things that you've been preaching and talking about for the last 10 to 15 years
[02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:43.900]  are now coming to fruition, you know they can't call you kook anymore because everything
[02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:49.940]  you've been saying, John Birch Society, everything they've laid out 30, 40 years ago is starting
[02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:56.860]  to fall apart in our own government and starting to happen, you know, it is absolutely astonishing
[02:11:56.860 --> 02:12:04.860]  Alex that we have so many conspiracies of coming to fruition and be improved, I mean
[02:12:04.860 --> 02:12:09.980]  especially the IRS, like that's a big surprise to anybody, I mean come on, in 1990-
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:11.860]  Haven't you been harassed by him?
[02:12:11.860 --> 02:12:13.420]  Never, my dad did.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:14.980]  That's right, I remember you telling that story, yeah.
[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:20.700]  My dad got it, but this was just two or three years after he left the FBI.
[02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:26.540]  And so what the IRS was doing, and in fact it was exposed in 1997 by Jennifer Long and
[02:12:26.540 --> 02:12:32.900]  a few other whistleblowers of the IRS, saying that IRS employees routinely fabricate evidence
[02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:36.380]  against citizens who they know cannot afford to defend themselves.
[02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:42.580]  My father fit into that and so they just go after people who are middle class, who they
[02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:46.700]  know can't defend themselves and so they thought my father would just pay the money.
[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:51.540]  My father cared too much about justice and truth to do that because he knew he was innocent
[02:12:51.540 --> 02:12:54.860]  and he didn't have the funds to defend himself.
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:13:00.260]  But he had a friend, a lawyer and a friend, a CPA that went to bat for him and after a
[02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:05.460]  year and a half of trying to destroy my father, my father proved that the IRS had lied.
[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:11.420]  Then Jennifer Long came along with other IRS agents and there were two agents who refused
[02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:15.980]  to testify unless they were done so anonymously.
[02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:19.900]  And so they were hidden behind a partition and their voices muffled and they were silhouetted
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:21.400]  behind a partition.
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:22.900]  Violates the Constitution.
[02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:27.620]  Sure, but the only other time that that's ever happened at Congress was when the Casa
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:31.600]  Nostra whistleblower testified about the mafia.
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:34.060]  So we have the mafia and the IRS.
[02:13:34.060 --> 02:13:35.820]  Kind of a parallel there, isn't there?
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:38.540]  Plus, our country was built without the IRS.
[02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:41.180]  It wasn't set up until 1913 for the Federal Reserve.
[02:13:41.180 --> 02:13:43.820]  It didn't become popularly in use until the 50s.
[02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:48.260]  It has hurt our country and they can abuse whoever they want and people will tell you,
[02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:52.220]  I'm not going to criticize the government, the IRS will come after me.
[02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:57.300]  I know so many journalists and people who've been told and they've even taped it where
[02:13:57.300 --> 02:14:02.180]  the IRS says, stop covering these stories, they tell churches, stop praying, they tell
[02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:06.540]  pro-life groups, go be pro-abortion and we'll stop an audit.
[02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:07.540]  That's in the news now.
[02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:09.980]  I mean, that's even worse than I thought it was.
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:12.740]  I mean, what a criminal organization.
[02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:17.500]  It is and so I keep, I'm writing right now, I'm in the middle of writing the sequel to
[02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:19.740]  the county sheriff, America's Last Hope.
[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:21.980]  As you said, it is the solution and it is.
[02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:27.780]  We can stop what's going on if we have sheriffs, local officials and now we're even getting
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:29.980]  chiefs of police.
[02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:34.740]  We have chiefs of police on our board of directors and we're getting peace officers and deputies.
[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:36.340]  We have deputies standing up.
[02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:41.940]  Now deputy Lenick, who you know, because you put him out there on Info Wars, the Stan
[02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:47.380]  Lenick from the Albany airport, when he refused to arrest the people handing out the flyers,
[02:14:47.380 --> 02:14:52.820]  well he was our deputy sheriff of the year and so we had deputy Lenick at our convention.
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:53.820]  These are the types of people.
[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:54.820]  Oh, so you got to know him.
[02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:57.300]  Oh yeah, he's a great guy, good man.
[02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:01.300]  Now, his wife just had a premature baby so he came in and left.
[02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:05.820]  He didn't stay for the whole thing but he had to get back to babysit and what a great
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:06.820]  guy.
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:07.820]  Will you give us his contact?
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:08.820]  We'd like to get him on.
[02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:09.820]  Absolutely.
[02:15:09.820 --> 02:15:16.060]  You're talking about one of the most exemplary deputies in American history here with his
[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:20.420]  deputy Stan Lenick and so who was our sheriff of the year?
[02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:28.100]  Ah, David A. Clark Jr. from Milwaukee and so who was calling us racists and everything
[02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:35.540]  and by even after we've named Sheriff Clark our sheriff of the year, our CSBOA sheriff
[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:39.460]  of the year, they tried to call, local newspaper, they tried to call us racists because they
[02:15:39.460 --> 02:15:43.820]  do that so that people will Google it and then see that and not be part of it because
[02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:44.820]  they're desperate.
[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:47.140]  It's like, oh, you don't want government run healthcare, you're a racist.
[02:15:47.140 --> 02:15:48.460]  You don't want world government, you're a racist.
[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:50.300]  Don't want to turn your guns in, you're a racist.
[02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:51.780]  They just use that on everything.
[02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:52.780]  Well, Sheriff Clark responded.
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:55.940]  He said, I'm the only black sheriff in Wisconsin.
[02:15:55.940 --> 02:16:00.100]  I'm the only one in Wisconsin in the entire country that was named sheriff of the year
[02:16:00.100 --> 02:16:01.100]  by the CSBOA.
[02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:05.220]  He says, it's a little bit ridiculous to go after them for being racists.
[02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:08.740]  You know, and I want to tell SPLC, and I've told them before, I've told Mark Poteauk,
[02:16:08.740 --> 02:16:13.140]  he and I've talked a lot and and did you see his quote about me?
[02:16:13.140 --> 02:16:14.140]  Not recently.
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:18.740]  He said, Alex Jones doesn't build bombs, he builds bombers in Bloomberg.
[02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:19.740]  Oh, wow.
[02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:20.740]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:21.740]  Wow.
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:25.340]  That's how are things going with you in the SPLC right now?
[02:16:25.340 --> 02:16:32.460]  Well, the lawsuit got thrown out and I guess, you know, it was a technicality and I didn't
[02:16:32.460 --> 02:16:33.460]  agree with it.
[02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:35.660]  And after they threw it out, I bagged it.
[02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:40.740]  So they still are going after me and they've lied about me a little bit, but not nearly
[02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:41.740]  as much as I did.
[02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:43.140]  Why did you originally sue them?
[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:47.540]  Because they had lied and put it out all over the country that I said, let's kill federal
[02:16:47.540 --> 02:16:48.780]  agents.
[02:16:48.780 --> 02:16:51.060]  And you know that my message has always been one of peace.
[02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:53.020]  Oh, mine is too.
[02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:59.100]  And they said that I influenced in Bloomberg with no evidence that I made the bombers do
[02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:00.100]  it basically.
[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:01.100]  Oh, brother.
[02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:05.900]  Yeah, with no proof and then they have the SPLC going, yeah, he builds bombers and there's
[02:17:05.900 --> 02:17:07.860]  no doubt I could beat them on that.
[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:11.980]  I mean, the ADL's lost lawsuits for stuff like that is I just don't have time to mess
[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:12.980]  with it.
[02:17:12.980 --> 02:17:14.460]  And I mean, you know, that was me too.
[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:17.540]  And it's almost a full-time job to sue somebody like that.
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:18.540]  It is.
[02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:19.540]  It's a full-time job.
[02:17:19.540 --> 02:17:22.740]  And when I did the Clinton administration, as you mentioned, you beat them.
[02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:27.900]  I beat their butts and all the way back to Washington, a miraculous case, just an absolute
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:28.900]  miraculous case.
[02:17:28.900 --> 02:17:32.260]  And that was a David and Goliath story, and I love being David.
[02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:36.900]  And we're still creating David's all across the country to stop all these horrible things.
[02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:37.900]  Exactly.
[02:17:37.900 --> 02:17:40.500]  I mean, those of us that are working full-time just to wake people up, folks, we need you
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:42.060]  to be the ones that sue them and stuff.
[02:17:42.060 --> 02:17:45.420]  I mean, we just had the lady in who started the lawsuit wanted at the Supreme Court over
[02:17:45.420 --> 02:17:49.460]  the gene patents, Austinite listener took her two years.
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:50.460]  She did it.
[02:17:50.460 --> 02:17:51.460]  Yeah.
[02:17:51.460 --> 02:17:53.900]  And so, folks, you need to, when you're in the right, go after these people.
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:57.260]  And again, but the SPLC, they discredit themselves.
[02:17:57.260 --> 02:18:02.100]  Everybody knows that I'm not influencing Muslim bombers, and that I'm the opposite of that.
[02:18:02.100 --> 02:18:03.660]  I mean, that is insane.
[02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:07.700]  Well, they are insane, and what's really insane is our own government.
[02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:14.540]  Now, why doesn't the SPLC come out and assail the IRS and assail the NSA and all these horrible
[02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:15.540]  other things?
[02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:17.060]  They call themselves a civil rights group.
[02:18:17.060 --> 02:18:18.060]  Yeah.
[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:19.940]  So why don't they go after the government?
[02:18:19.940 --> 02:18:24.100]  They never go after the government, and the reason is, is because that's where they get
[02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:25.580]  a lot of their funding.
[02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:29.700]  They teach all these classes and get a lot of funding from the federal government.
[02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:34.180]  So they're never going to go after them, and that discredits them on their own.
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:39.220]  They are their own discredit, and the Southern probably law center is a joke and probably
[02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:42.100]  not even worthy to be on your show, quite honestly.
[02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:46.300]  Well, they are becoming more and more of a joke, but they're also very serious players.
[02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:50.300]  You know, they ran with their top informants, ran the L.A.M.
[02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:56.100]  City compound that McVay was at, and then Hal tried to expose that the ATF informant
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:57.100]  and got shut down.
[02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:04.220]  Well, one of their informants came to the event in Valley Forge where we spoke about
[02:19:04.220 --> 02:19:09.540]  two years ago, and a lot of us were there, Larry Pratt and a lot of big speakers, and
[02:19:09.540 --> 02:19:12.380]  that's when they supposedly got me.
[02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:16.300]  And then they tried to call me a little bit after that and do an interview, and I said,
[02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:21.580]  you guys have been lying about me for 17 years, and now you try to call me and ask me for
[02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:22.580]  my comment.
[02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:24.420]  You've been lying about me for 17 years.
[02:19:24.420 --> 02:19:26.180]  Why would you come now and ask me for a comment?
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:27.740]  You've never asked me for a comment before.
[02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:29.620]  They said, where have we lied about you?
[02:19:29.620 --> 02:19:33.980]  And I said, well, since the beginning, since I first filed the lawsuit, but most recently,
[02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:38.660]  when you said we should kill IRS agents, they checked their own tape and said, no, we made
[02:19:38.660 --> 02:19:41.740]  a mistake, we'll have to do a retraction.
[02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:42.740]  So they did a retraction.
[02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:46.420]  Well, at least you did that, it's just unbelievable, that's not a mistake.
[02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:47.420]  No, of course not.
[02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:48.420]  It wasn't even close.
[02:19:48.420 --> 02:19:53.460]  I made the ADL change something one time that was just totally made up, and I had to have
[02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:55.780]  my lawyer get in touch with them and make them do it.
[02:19:55.780 --> 02:19:59.100]  I want to come back and get into Snowden, all of this, where you see things going, then
[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:00.820]  phone calls, Richard Macintosh, studio.

[02:21:57.300 --> 02:22:01.820]  Again, that's GetSimpliSafe.com Hi, my name is Stephen Hewer.
[02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:05.300]  As a Degree Nutritionist, my first priority is for you to get healthy.
[02:22:05.300 --> 02:22:09.140]  That won't happen if I make wrong recommendations or cause you to spend money on supplements
[02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:10.140]  you don't need.
[02:22:10.140 --> 02:22:14.300]  After 20 years working with thousands of products and thousands of people, I know for the most
[02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:16.540]  part what does and does not work.
[02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:21.660]  One World Way is the first and only unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows on
[02:22:21.660 --> 02:22:22.660]  the market.
[02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:26.020]  It retains substances that no other whey protein powder has.
[02:22:26.020 --> 02:22:29.340]  These nutritive compounds supply life-giving nutrition.
[02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:32.460]  Your body merely needs the right conditions to make great health happen.
[02:22:32.460 --> 02:22:37.180]  Due to low-quality foods, toxicity, and aging, having great health is more of an effort than
[02:22:37.180 --> 02:22:38.180]  ever.
[02:22:38.180 --> 02:22:42.780]  One World Way is the superfood of the century, and when added to your diet, it promotes energy,
[02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:47.500]  detoxification, muscle gains, fat loss, and overall radiant health.

[02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:07.660]  Because we only sell to people we can trust.
[02:23:07.660 --> 02:23:09.620]  We do not sell to government agencies.
[02:23:09.620 --> 02:23:13.300]  We manufacture our own bullets and load our own ammunition, so it's in stock and ready
[02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:14.300]  to ship.

[02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:30.740]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:34.100]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, and investment advisors won't talk about
[02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:35.100]  gold IRAs?
[02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:39.380]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:41.020]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:44.460]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[02:23:44.460 --> 02:23:49.340]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:55.140]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:55.140 --> 02:24:24.980]  Hear your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:24:25.140 --> 02:24:35.340]  Share of Richard Mack is our guest, his dad was in the FBI, he's now passed on to hopefully
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:40.540]  heaven, I'm sure, in the FBI, and the FBI in all these agencies have always been compartmentalized.
[02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:44.740]  You've got the light side, the dark side, in the past, talking to really top historians
[02:24:44.740 --> 02:24:48.900]  and researchers, maybe 10% of federal agencies were dark side.
[02:24:48.900 --> 02:24:55.100]  Joel Scalzen, I respect, estimates it's more like 50% now, is dark side.
[02:24:55.100 --> 02:24:57.620]  What did your dad say to you about that?
[02:24:57.620 --> 02:24:59.620]  Why would the IRS come after him when he retired?
[02:24:59.620 --> 02:25:04.780]  I know they harass people they think are actually good people.
[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:09.780]  What would your dad think today about what's happening with just all this open evil?
[02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:14.260]  Well my dad would be shocked with all of this, but he would also say, yeah, that's what
[02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:15.740]  they did to me.
[02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:20.620]  And my dad learned a lot about the subterfuge of government when they audited him.
[02:25:20.620 --> 02:25:24.780]  He thought that everything in government was pretty on the up and up.
[02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:29.340]  He served 30 years in the FBI, served another five years in the Army Air Corps during World
[02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:31.340]  War II.
[02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:32.500]  He believed in government.
[02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:34.220]  He believed in what they were doing.
[02:25:34.220 --> 02:25:38.740]  He even believed at one point until he and I had some extensive conversations in the
[02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:41.460]  Warren Commission report.
[02:25:41.460 --> 02:25:42.860]  Why did they go after your dad?
[02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:46.580]  But he made some enemies while he was in the bureau, and I guess that's why they went
[02:25:46.580 --> 02:25:48.860]  after him because this is very rare.
[02:25:48.860 --> 02:25:52.660]  Well we had the son of a state police officer who called in earlier and said he was told
[02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:56.580]  to go after conservatives, libertarians, and that's come out in Texas, they've been told,
[02:25:56.580 --> 02:26:00.660]  to act like we're doing something, and it's really because we're the good guys and the
[02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:02.660]  bad guys know it.
[02:26:02.660 --> 02:26:07.180]  Well my dad wasn't a real constitutionalist or anything like that.
[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:10.980]  He was a real solid, honest man.
[02:26:10.980 --> 02:26:14.820]  But I think also the other thing that might have been is they just started looking in
[02:26:14.820 --> 02:26:19.420]  the computer for people who fit the profile that the IRS wanted to go after, and they
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:23.740]  didn't see that he was a former FBI agent, and they just went after him because he...
[02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:24.900]  It's funny you say that.
[02:26:24.900 --> 02:26:31.060]  My dad has said, please don't talk about this, but I just don't care, I will talk about it.
[02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:34.020]  He fit the profile, and later he learned they went after middle class people that were known
[02:26:34.020 --> 02:26:36.380]  as being nice guys, they thought they could push around.
[02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:41.460]  And they told him in Dallas in the mid-80s, they said, we are criminals, Mr. Jones.
[02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:43.340]  They said, we are criminals.
[02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:46.380]  We will take everything you've got unless you pay us this.
[02:26:46.380 --> 02:26:49.620]  And he was like, they said, we are criminals.
[02:26:49.620 --> 02:26:54.140]  I mean imagine, and my dad was like, Mr. Mom and Apple Pie is like, you're criminals?
[02:26:54.140 --> 02:26:59.860]  I thought you worked for the federal government, I thought you were a service organization,
[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:00.860]  IRS, internal...
[02:27:00.860 --> 02:27:03.020]  But they said, we are criminals.
[02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:07.300]  He brought in his receipts and everything and the CPA stuff, and they said, hey pal,
[02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:08.300]  we're criminals.
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:10.100]  They were like, hey, you know.
[02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:14.020]  Well, they told my father almost the same thing, they didn't say criminal but they
[02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:16.900]  said, we will ruin you unless you pay.
[02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:17.900]  You know, it's just...
[02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:18.900]  No, they said that too.
[02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:20.220]  They said, we are criminals.
[02:27:20.220 --> 02:27:21.220]  You will lose.
[02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:22.220]  Yeah.
[02:27:22.220 --> 02:27:23.220]  Yeah, of course.
[02:27:23.220 --> 02:27:24.220]  And it's an extortion racket.
[02:27:24.220 --> 02:27:25.220]  And that's all this is.
[02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:31.140]  And those of us who still pay the extortion to stay out of prison, you know, we're the
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:32.140]  cowards.
[02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:33.140]  I admit.
[02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:34.140]  But even when you pay them, they come.
[02:27:34.140 --> 02:27:37.260]  That was that retroactive tax act in the 80s.
[02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:38.260]  And they came to him and said, pay.
[02:27:38.260 --> 02:27:40.500]  And he said, that's more money than I have if I sold my house.
[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:44.580]  We went from, we basically had to sell our cars, everything, and he even fought them
[02:27:44.580 --> 02:27:46.060]  for a couple of years, but it didn't matter.
[02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:49.620]  Then they just got interest and we basically took everything my dad had.
[02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:52.540]  Well, I mean, this country is pathetic.
[02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:57.820]  My dad pulled one other car card out or he probably would have ended up like your dad.
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:03.900]  And he had a congressman that he used to work in the FBI with, Eldon Rudd from Arizona.
[02:28:03.900 --> 02:28:10.360]  I think that the final straw to help my father was Eldon Rudd getting involved in it.
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:13.900]  And if he hadn't, I think my father would have ended up paying and we would have lost
[02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:17.140]  everything because my dad didn't have the money.
[02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:23.420]  My dad, to get more money in the FBI, you have to, you have to move.
[02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:25.380]  To get promoted, you have to move.
[02:28:25.380 --> 02:28:26.660]  My dad never wanted to move.
[02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:29.460]  He wanted us to be raised in Southern Arizona.
[02:28:29.460 --> 02:28:36.300]  And in the same community where he was the FBI for 25 years, I became the sheriff.
[02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:37.300]  And I'm really grateful.
[02:28:37.300 --> 02:28:38.300]  Did he live to see that?
[02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:39.300]  Yes.
[02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:40.300]  Oh, yes.
[02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:41.300]  He did.
[02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:42.780]  Was he proud of your Supreme Court when?
[02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:43.780]  He was.
[02:28:43.780 --> 02:28:46.820]  He was very amazed by it as well.
[02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:51.500]  He died six years ago, so he followed all of that very strictly.
[02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:57.140]  He didn't know or understand all of my motives behind it, but he knew and understood me.
[02:28:57.140 --> 02:28:59.740]  And he knew that what I was doing was the right thing.
[02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:05.460]  He didn't like Clinton, of course, anybody that was honest wouldn't, but it was just
[02:29:05.460 --> 02:29:06.460]  a miraculous time.
[02:29:06.460 --> 02:29:11.660]  My mother passed away just two years ago, and she was kind of pro-government, too.
[02:29:11.660 --> 02:29:15.980]  But every time I would talk to her about, okay, what are we really doing here?
[02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:17.580]  Why are we supporting government blindly?
[02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:19.980]  I said, do you remember what they did to my father?
[02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:21.420]  Remember what they did to dad?
[02:29:21.420 --> 02:29:22.780]  And she goes, oh, yeah.
[02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:23.780]  And I said, mom.
[02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:27.340]  But again, that shows how old-timers were so honest and so good.
[02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:28.340]  Exactly.
[02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:32.780]  That even though the government had wrongly come after you and tried to ruin your life,
[02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:35.980]  she would still, it's just unbelievable.
[02:29:35.980 --> 02:29:41.020]  And that's why they do the crimes they really are engaged in, the white slavery, the drug
[02:29:41.020 --> 02:29:42.020]  dealing.
[02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:46.820]  I mean, if the naive people who are well-meaning knew the truth, it's just, it's unbelievable.
[02:29:46.820 --> 02:29:50.580]  We'll be right back with Sheriff Mack.
[02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:54.260]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[02:29:54.260 --> 02:30:01.100]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:05.820]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:08.900]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:30:08.900 --> 02:30:14.460]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[02:30:14.460 --> 02:30:16.420]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:18.060]  We are what we eat.
[02:30:18.060 --> 02:30:22.700]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:26.940]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:30:26.940 --> 02:30:29.500]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:30:29.500 --> 02:30:34.380]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicists by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:35.740]  desperately needs.

[02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:10.220]  of information.
[02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:17.260]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your
[02:32:17.260 --> 02:32:18.260]  psyche.
[02:32:18.260 --> 02:32:23.700]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:27.300]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:31.500]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and
[02:32:31.500 --> 02:32:34.300]  verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:32:34.300 --> 02:32:37.460]  All of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:32:37.460 --> 02:32:42.420]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse
[02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:44.420]  but demand a war.
[02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:47.180]  All of another one, another plane just passed.
[02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:49.860]  State of mind because there's a war on.
[02:32:49.860 --> 02:32:56.100]  For your mind, get your copy of State of Mind the Movie at infowars.com and remember every
[02:32:56.100 --> 02:33:02.220]  order at infowarsstore.com receives a free citizen rulebook.
[02:33:02.220 --> 02:33:15.540]  You can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amuck.
[02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:20.220]  When you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.
[02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:25.940]  And if people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust Congress and don't
[02:33:25.940 --> 02:33:32.780]  trust federal judges to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution due process and
[02:33:32.780 --> 02:33:36.460]  rule of law, then we're going to have some problems.
[02:33:36.460 --> 02:33:46.460]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:46.460 --> 02:33:57.700]  All right, some of your phone calls on a host of issues are coming up.
[02:33:57.700 --> 02:33:59.940]  Sheriff Richard Mack is here in the studio with us.
[02:33:59.940 --> 02:34:04.620]  We carry both of his books, The Magic of Gun Control and the one on Constitutional Sheriffs
[02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:07.300]  at infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:07.300 --> 02:34:11.700]  Every sheriff in America needs to get these and they've been getting them.
[02:34:11.700 --> 02:34:16.780]  Because now you see sheriffs all over saying, why is the Forest Service armed here?
[02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:21.220]  And that's up on infowars.com today where sheriffs in Colorado are throwing them out
[02:34:21.220 --> 02:34:22.780]  of the towns.
[02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:27.260]  We've seen cases of where they're trying to persecute sheriffs and sheriff's deputies
[02:34:27.260 --> 02:34:34.980]  that don't arrest people who own guns and don't enforce unconstitutional laws on law
[02:34:34.980 --> 02:34:36.660]  abiding citizens.
[02:34:36.660 --> 02:34:40.820]  We see moves to have the Secret Service be able to come in and go after sheriffs they're
[02:34:40.820 --> 02:34:43.820]  trying to pass in Colorado in places.
[02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:48.060]  And all that does is wake up the sheriffs and the police and everybody else.
[02:34:48.060 --> 02:34:53.660]  We need to get back to that healthy jurisdictional boundary of the states.
[02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:57.660]  So we're going to talk about that with Sheriff Richard Mack here in just a moment.
[02:34:57.660 --> 02:35:01.780]  First off, this broadcast is listener supported and everything we offer are things that I
[02:35:01.780 --> 02:35:02.980]  use, I believe in.

[02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:26.820]  This is just amazing what's in the infowars seed center and infowarsstore.com, great to
[02:35:26.820 --> 02:35:29.860]  start a garden while you live in the country or the city.

[02:36:01.900 --> 02:36:03.740]  And now is the time.
[02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:05.980]  People are really ready to wake up right now.
[02:36:05.980 --> 02:36:07.980]  They just don't believe we can have any change.
[02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:09.100]  We can have change.
[02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:12.820]  We've had incredible victories all over the world for liberty, but the globalist and their
[02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:14.500]  media aren't going to tell you.
[02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:19.860]  We've seen record low approval ratings for Congress, 10% in Gallup.
[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:25.980]  We've seen record low readership and support and trust in major polls for mainstream media.
[02:36:25.980 --> 02:36:31.660]  We've seen record low support for Obama and all their globalism and their gun grabbing.
[02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:34.940]  That's why they put out fake polls saying Americans want to be spied on.
[02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:39.740]  Americans love Obama, but those are the public policy groups and globalist connected things.
[02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:42.460]  All the real polls show the opposite.
[02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:46.060]  And I know they're real because I'm all over the country and I'm out there and I see it.
[02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:48.660]  And I talk to the police and I talk to the military.
[02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:52.380]  Upwards of half the military I talk to, we're awake and listening to this show alone.
[02:36:52.380 --> 02:36:53.780]  Can you imagine?
[02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:56.340]  That must give fits to the new world order.
[02:36:56.340 --> 02:37:01.540]  So please support us infowarsstore.com or if you're out there listening on the radio,

[02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:12.900]  Mack.com.
[02:37:12.900 --> 02:37:19.580]  Let me add one other thing to your message just then.
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:23.220]  I don't want anybody to think that that book is just for sheriffs.
[02:37:23.220 --> 02:37:25.540]  Every American citizen should read that book.
[02:37:25.540 --> 02:37:26.540]  Absolutely.
[02:37:26.540 --> 02:37:27.540]  America's last hope.
[02:37:27.540 --> 02:37:29.100]  You need to know what he's supposed to know.
[02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:30.500]  He works for you.
[02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:33.340]  So everyone in America should get that book.
[02:37:33.340 --> 02:37:34.580]  Absolutely.
[02:37:34.580 --> 02:37:37.580]  And learn about common law bill of rights constitution.
[02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:39.900]  They're breaking the law when they do this.
[02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:41.540]  Snowden shouldn't go to jail.
[02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:45.140]  The people that ordered them to illegally spy should go to jail.
[02:37:45.140 --> 02:37:46.140]  Absolutely.
[02:37:46.140 --> 02:37:51.020]  In fact, all the whistleblowers, they usually just fire them or send them to jail and that's
[02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:55.500]  what they're trying to do to Snowden now worldwide, publicly.
[02:37:55.500 --> 02:38:01.740]  And so it's an amazing process, but I believe there's been too much light shed on what has
[02:38:01.740 --> 02:38:06.380]  happened that Snowden is being protected a little bit just because of all the light
[02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:09.100]  that's been shining on him.
[02:38:09.100 --> 02:38:14.380]  And so I think it's just an amazing process, again, of showing the corruption of Washington
[02:38:14.380 --> 02:38:15.380]  D.C.
[02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:18.460]  By the way, to correct something, I remember now when my dad said when he came home and
[02:38:18.460 --> 02:38:23.300]  I've heard the story 30 times after, the head IRS lady had a meeting with in Dallas.
[02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:26.460]  She looked at him and she said, we are white collar criminals.
[02:38:26.460 --> 02:38:27.660]  You will not beat us.
[02:38:27.660 --> 02:38:28.660]  Oh, yeah.
[02:38:28.660 --> 02:38:31.660]  I mean, that's like the mafia coming in your store going, we're the mafia.
[02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:33.540]  You will pay us and we'll burn this down.
[02:38:33.540 --> 02:38:34.540]  Correct.
[02:38:34.540 --> 02:38:35.540]  I mean, that's what they are.
[02:38:35.540 --> 02:38:41.260]  You know, that comparison's been actually taking place in a lot of mainstream books.
[02:38:41.260 --> 02:38:47.420]  There's a book called The Sovereign Individual written and actually printed, published by
[02:38:47.420 --> 02:38:51.580]  Simon and Schuster back about 12, 13 years ago.
[02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:57.580]  The sovereign individual talks about the Vince Foster murder being the most poorly
[02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:00.140]  disguised murder in American history.
[02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:05.620]  And these guys go right after and they compare the IRS to the mafia.
[02:39:05.620 --> 02:39:08.660]  They use the same tactics, they for the same results.
[02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:13.300]  And this is just a mainstream book talking about finances.
[02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:16.780]  And it was done by a couple of world renowned financiers.
[02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:23.220]  And it was not, it was not a book by Sheriff Mack or Alex Jones or any of these other radical
[02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:24.220]  extremists.
[02:39:24.220 --> 02:39:30.300]  It was done by two world renowned economists.
[02:39:30.300 --> 02:39:35.160]  And again, the sovereign individual, and I read it and I was amazed by what they exposed
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:38.180]  in there, especially about Hillary Clinton, who's, you know,
[02:39:38.180 --> 02:39:43.620]  But I remember my dad, you know, who was like mainline going around, giving anti-communist
[02:39:43.620 --> 02:39:48.460]  speeches in Texas and going on the Dallas radio when he was like 15 years old and in
[02:39:48.460 --> 02:39:49.460]  America.
[02:39:49.460 --> 02:39:50.460]  Your dad did that?
[02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:51.460]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39:51.460 --> 02:39:52.460]  Really?
[02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:53.460]  Yeah.
[02:39:53.460 --> 02:39:56.940]  And the point is, and then he stopped doing it once he went to college and got married
[02:39:56.940 --> 02:39:58.220]  and had me and stuff.
[02:39:58.220 --> 02:40:02.060]  And then my sister later, the point was, he got married, had kids and kind of moved on.
[02:40:02.060 --> 02:40:05.540]  But the point was, he bought into the whole thing that America is the good guys.
[02:40:05.540 --> 02:40:10.180]  And the point is, that was the perfect cover for criminals to come in and take over the
[02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:11.180]  government.
[02:40:11.180 --> 02:40:15.620]  Here's another person I want to interview, Mark Mazzetti, a Pulitzer Prize winner.
[02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:20.940]  The way of the knife, the CIA, a secret army and the war at the ends of the earth, admitting
[02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:25.180]  that they're just killing people all over the world with assassination teams illegally,
[02:40:25.180 --> 02:40:26.440]  including here in America.
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:30.780]  And then you have Michael Hastings saying, I've got big breaking news.
[02:40:30.780 --> 02:40:32.940]  I'm going off the radar into hiding.
[02:40:32.940 --> 02:40:34.500]  They're coming and visiting my family and friends.
[02:40:34.500 --> 02:40:37.420]  He said there are, and then the FBI lied and said, no, we're not.
[02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:41.540]  And then his car an hour and 45 minutes later blows up, witnesses said it was driving down
[02:40:41.540 --> 02:40:43.100]  the road and blew up.
[02:40:43.100 --> 02:40:44.100]  It's up against the tree.
[02:40:44.100 --> 02:40:45.100]  Didn't run into the tree and see it.
[02:40:45.100 --> 02:40:46.760]  It came to the rest against the tree.
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:52.980]  The engine's blown almost 60 yards down the road and they say day one, don't investigate.
[02:40:52.980 --> 02:40:54.680]  Alex Jones is a coke.
[02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:56.100]  It's natural causes.
[02:40:56.100 --> 02:41:03.460]  What do you make of things like that when Aaron Swartz is exposing the scams and the
[02:41:03.460 --> 02:41:07.500]  NSA and the spying and he's a leader and had a lot of money because he started Reddit.
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:10.980]  And then he says, I'm going to fight the FBI and the feds coming after me.
[02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:15.060]  I'm going to fight the justice department saying I've committed crimes, releasing info, and
[02:41:15.060 --> 02:41:18.740]  I'm getting married and then they come and he's hung and they immediately say we hung
[02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:19.740]  himself.
[02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:20.740]  Yeah.
[02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:21.900]  I mean, I think there's death squads.
[02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:26.660]  Another one of those accidental hangings, you know, but like the DC madam, I mean,
[02:41:26.660 --> 02:41:27.660]  what do you make of this?
[02:41:27.660 --> 02:41:29.220]  Because it's definitely, they're killing a lot of people.
[02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:31.660]  I mean, this is Gary Webb got shot twice in the head.
[02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:37.140]  Well, that's why I'd like, you know, the takes you back to the Vince Foster assassination.
[02:41:37.140 --> 02:41:42.220]  You know, I would really like you to have Mike Zulu on you haven't had him on, right?
[02:41:42.220 --> 02:41:43.900]  The detective cold case bossy detective.
[02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:45.260]  No, I want to get him on.
[02:41:45.260 --> 02:41:46.260]  Yeah.
[02:41:46.260 --> 02:41:47.260]  Let's ride all this down.
[02:41:47.260 --> 02:41:48.260]  Let's get.
[02:41:48.260 --> 02:41:49.260]  I can help you.
[02:41:49.260 --> 02:41:50.260]  I can help you line that up too.
[02:41:50.260 --> 02:41:52.580]  But he spoke at our CSP away convention.
[02:41:52.580 --> 02:41:56.260]  I want people to remember that CSP away.
[02:41:56.260 --> 02:41:57.260]  C is in Charlie.
[02:41:57.260 --> 02:41:58.260]  S is in Sam.
[02:41:58.260 --> 02:41:59.260]  P is in Paul.
[02:41:59.260 --> 02:42:00.260]  O is an Oscar.
[02:42:00.260 --> 02:42:01.260]  A is an Adam CSP away.
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:04.500]  This constitutional sheriff's peace officers association.
[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:05.500]  How evil.
[02:42:05.500 --> 02:42:06.980]  Oh, I know.
[02:42:06.980 --> 02:42:07.980]  You swear to it.
[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:08.980]  Now you're going to follow it.
[02:42:08.980 --> 02:42:09.980]  Oh my goodness.
[02:42:09.980 --> 02:42:10.980]  That's a dirty.
[02:42:10.980 --> 02:42:17.580]  Yeah, but Mike Zulu presented his evidence to us all there.
[02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:23.180]  And we just said, look, this is not a required seminar to attend his class.
[02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:25.060]  Just go and see if you don't want to go.
[02:42:25.060 --> 02:42:26.380]  If you're afraid of this, don't go.
[02:42:26.380 --> 02:42:28.980]  Well, it was the biggest attended class we had.
[02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:32.100]  And that was Saturday after the big day on Friday.
[02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:34.180]  So I am working on that.
[02:42:34.180 --> 02:42:38.580]  We're trying to get this exposed back before the investigation started.
[02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:45.580]  The truth is the same people who asked Sheriff Arpaio to investigate this came to me first.
[02:42:45.580 --> 02:42:48.500]  And I was living in Fredericksburg, as you'll recall at that time.
[02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:50.780]  And this is just a year and a half ago.
[02:42:50.780 --> 02:42:53.980]  And I told him I didn't have time to do it and I'd have to drop everything and I'd
[02:42:53.980 --> 02:42:54.980]  have to charge him.
[02:42:54.980 --> 02:42:56.660]  And they go, well, well, who would do this for free?
[02:42:56.660 --> 02:42:59.140]  And we're thinking about asking Arpaio and say, he won't do it.
[02:42:59.140 --> 02:43:00.420]  I said, he won't get involved in this.
[02:43:00.420 --> 02:43:02.540]  I've talked to him about this issue before.
[02:43:02.540 --> 02:43:04.420]  He thinks it's a bogus issue.
[02:43:04.420 --> 02:43:09.500]  But when he had 150, 200 people from the local Tea Party came and they showed him some evidence
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:12.500]  that they really distressed it about the...
[02:43:12.500 --> 02:43:14.500]  And then notice how Obama came after him.
[02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:15.500]  Oh, I know.
[02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:17.300]  Because that is a fake birth certificate.
[02:43:17.300 --> 02:43:18.300]  Oh, totally.
[02:43:18.300 --> 02:43:20.300]  First, they said they'd released it when they hadn't.
[02:43:20.300 --> 02:43:24.140]  They released a receipt of wine that you go and print out as a computer.
[02:43:24.140 --> 02:43:28.180]  Like, I've got to get them for my kids and you go and they print out a receipt.
[02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:30.740]  The Bureau of Statistics says, here's your receipt from the health department.
[02:43:30.740 --> 02:43:32.820]  Well, you've been working on it.
[02:43:32.820 --> 02:43:34.020]  Tell people what we know.
[02:43:34.020 --> 02:43:37.940]  Well, the thing of it is, the one really working it is Mike Zulu.
[02:43:37.940 --> 02:43:43.300]  And he's a former detective and he's working for free for Sheriff Arpaio on his cold case
[02:43:43.300 --> 02:43:44.380]  posse.
[02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:49.380]  And so Arpaio told his people and told me at the time, he said, look, these people asked
[02:43:49.380 --> 02:43:50.380]  me.
[02:43:50.380 --> 02:43:51.380]  I said, I know.
[02:43:51.380 --> 02:43:53.580]  I said, I'm surprised you took it because I told him you wouldn't.
[02:43:53.580 --> 02:43:57.620]  He says, well, he says, just to get them off my back, I told him I'd investigate it.
[02:43:57.620 --> 02:44:01.220]  But I'm sure I'm just going to clear the president and everything's going to be fine.
[02:44:01.220 --> 02:44:05.820]  Well, the investigator did a thorough investigation and it turned out to be just the opposite.
[02:44:05.820 --> 02:44:10.700]  That's when I bought onto it because I knew Arpaio was an honest man and that he would
[02:44:10.700 --> 02:44:13.780]  do this thoroughly and professionally.
[02:44:13.780 --> 02:44:17.180]  And Zulu has done a marvelous investigation.
[02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:19.780]  He's taken the birth certificate apart.
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:22.540]  Now he's why would they put out such a bad fake though?
[02:44:22.540 --> 02:44:28.740]  Well, you know, I think they used a computer specialist that is young, okay, and didn't
[02:44:28.740 --> 02:44:33.580]  know how type setting off because here's how I knew it was fake day one.
[02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:41.020]  They use the fake system that comes in the fonts in the right to typing font back in
[02:44:41.020 --> 02:44:42.020]  those.
[02:44:42.020 --> 02:44:43.020]  Yeah.
[02:44:43.020 --> 02:44:44.020]  Yeah.
[02:44:44.020 --> 02:44:45.020]  It's meant to look exactly.
[02:44:45.020 --> 02:44:48.380]  It's meant to look like typing, but it's the computer font because the letters are identical
[02:44:48.380 --> 02:44:52.260]  and the splats from a real typewriter are like snowflakes or fingerprints.
[02:44:52.260 --> 02:44:53.260]  Right.
[02:44:53.260 --> 02:44:54.340]  I mean, it's horribly fake.
[02:44:54.340 --> 02:44:57.780]  And Zulu takes he takes it nine layers.
[02:44:57.780 --> 02:45:02.220]  He takes the whole thing and it was layered nine times and he takes it and shows you the
[02:45:02.220 --> 02:45:04.860]  mistake of all nine layers.
[02:45:04.860 --> 02:45:07.420]  Now, but why did they do something so fake?
[02:45:07.420 --> 02:45:08.420]  We found it day one.
[02:45:08.420 --> 02:45:12.980]  Well, when, when you look at it at his face, if you just went in and showed it to Obama,
[02:45:12.980 --> 02:45:16.500]  he'll look at it and go, Oh my gosh, this is great.
[02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:17.700]  This looks good.
[02:45:17.700 --> 02:45:22.340]  You just have to start peeling off the layers and then you get an entire different view.
[02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:27.980]  So whoever it was, it was a young computer tech and they thought, you know, no one went
[02:45:27.980 --> 02:45:30.740]  back to it and did peeled off the layers.
[02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:32.140]  They said, Oh, that'll work.
[02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:35.860]  So they didn't do their homework and they just had to get something out and they would
[02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:37.740]  run and then even left it in layers.
[02:45:37.740 --> 02:45:38.740]  Yes.
[02:45:38.740 --> 02:45:39.740]  Yeah.
[02:45:39.740 --> 02:45:40.740]  This crazy.
[02:45:40.740 --> 02:45:42.460]  It was not a good job at all.
[02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:47.460]  So you have to kind of wonder who proofread that forum, but Obama needed to release something
[02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:50.460]  and he did and they just rushed it.
[02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:55.540]  And so what, what we don't say and what you need to remember on all of this investigation,
[02:45:55.540 --> 02:46:00.140]  all of your listeners need to remember this, we are not, and this investigation is not
[02:46:00.140 --> 02:46:03.700]  saying where Mr. Obama was born.
[02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:08.260]  We're saying that the birth certificate, the White House released is a fraud, a fake
[02:46:08.260 --> 02:46:09.260]  and a lie.
[02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:10.260]  Have you seen dreams of my real father?
[02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:11.260]  We sell it.
[02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:14.820]  Oh, I mean, that's, that's his mom and that's that house and that's the photos confirmed.
[02:46:14.820 --> 02:46:16.380]  I think that's what it is.
[02:46:16.380 --> 02:46:17.380]  Yeah.
[02:46:17.380 --> 02:46:20.780]  And no wonder the Kenya thing, that's why his wife said it in speeches and why it was
[02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:22.100]  in the Harvard deal.
[02:46:22.100 --> 02:46:23.100]  That was the diversion.
[02:46:23.100 --> 02:46:24.100]  Yeah.
[02:46:24.100 --> 02:46:28.020]  The truth was he had a different name, different dad, a famous communist.
[02:46:28.020 --> 02:46:32.460]  I mean, oh man, and you know Obama would spend the summers with him and he used a communist
[02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:33.460]  pornographer.
[02:46:33.460 --> 02:46:34.460]  Yeah.
[02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:37.500]  Now, you know, he used his dad's name Barry Sotero.
[02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:38.500]  Yeah.
[02:46:38.500 --> 02:46:41.420]  I mean, that's Obama's name that he used to go to college.
[02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:45.580]  And so it's amazing that, that still even the mainstream press, even people like Chris
[02:46:45.580 --> 02:46:52.500]  Matthews, who give this guy a free ride and yet we know he used an alias, the only president
[02:46:52.500 --> 02:46:54.020]  ever to use an AK.
[02:46:54.020 --> 02:46:55.820]  Well, we had at least two other ones.
[02:46:55.820 --> 02:46:56.820]  Yeah.
[02:46:56.820 --> 02:47:00.180]  I mean, I mean, this guy, who do you think he really is?
[02:47:00.180 --> 02:47:02.980]  Because I mean, this, this guy looks like a Manchurian candidate.
[02:47:02.980 --> 02:47:05.140]  I think he was raised up for this.
[02:47:05.140 --> 02:47:07.340]  You know, I think he was groomed by somebody.
[02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:11.900]  And you know, when you look at, well, no kidding, he was surrounded by top communists.
[02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:12.900]  Davis.
[02:47:12.900 --> 02:47:13.900]  Yeah.
[02:47:13.900 --> 02:47:14.900]  Wasn't it Davis?
[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:15.900]  Yeah.
[02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:20.300]  As soon as he gets to, I mean, it's just, I mean, if you look at the people he was around,
[02:47:20.300 --> 02:47:23.420]  then you have to know this was no accident.
[02:47:23.420 --> 02:47:24.820]  This was all planned.
[02:47:24.820 --> 02:47:27.140]  There's no coincidences in this government.
[02:47:27.140 --> 02:47:28.620]  There's no accidents.
[02:47:28.620 --> 02:47:32.380]  This was, this was all devised and planned.
[02:47:32.380 --> 02:47:37.580]  And here he is doing what he was told, doing what he was raised to do, destroy America.
[02:47:37.580 --> 02:47:42.100]  And boy, they are, I mean, this Obamacare written to rip everybody off and make everybody go
[02:47:42.100 --> 02:47:43.100]  to part time.
[02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:46.380]  They're meant to hammer the poor and then they say it's for the poor.
[02:47:46.380 --> 02:47:49.620]  And then, and this immigration thing, all this free stuff for unlimited millions for
[02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:50.620]  the poor.
[02:47:50.620 --> 02:47:51.620]  It's to make us all poor.
[02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:52.620]  Yeah.
[02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:54.540]  It's to, it's to increase the poor.
[02:47:54.540 --> 02:48:00.460]  And yeah, you know, right now we're having so much of this happen that so many sheriffs
[02:48:00.460 --> 02:48:03.900]  and local officials are waking up to the solution.
[02:48:03.900 --> 02:48:05.420]  And I am so proud.
[02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:06.980]  That's nullification.
[02:48:06.980 --> 02:48:11.060]  Sheriff nullification, state nullification, because they can't go after all the sheriffs.
[02:48:11.060 --> 02:48:15.140]  I mean, if they can have 800 plus cities that are sanctuary where the illegals are above
[02:48:15.140 --> 02:48:19.060]  the law, why couldn't we have 800 cities where we ignore unconstitutional federal stuff?
[02:48:19.060 --> 02:48:22.740]  I mean, they're ignoring the law with the illegals and breaking the law.
[02:48:22.740 --> 02:48:25.220]  How about we ignore unconstitutional stuff?
[02:48:25.220 --> 02:48:26.420]  Absolutely.
[02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:29.180]  It should be done that way.
[02:48:29.180 --> 02:48:34.540]  My lawsuit was an amazing miracle, but I do not recommend that sheriffs or local officials
[02:48:34.540 --> 02:48:35.980]  sue anymore.
[02:48:35.980 --> 02:48:38.540]  We tell them, no, we wreck the barriers.
[02:48:38.540 --> 02:48:42.940]  That's the name of our new DVD set from our convention, erecting the barriers.
[02:48:42.940 --> 02:48:45.920]  That actually is a warning that came to us from James Madison.
[02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:50.020]  We can safely rely on local officials to erect the barriers against the encroachments
[02:48:50.020 --> 02:48:51.460]  of the federal government.
[02:48:51.460 --> 02:48:55.260]  That's what he espoused, and that's what we espouse.
[02:48:55.260 --> 02:48:57.140]  That's why there's three branches federally.
[02:48:57.140 --> 02:49:00.260]  And then you've got multiple branches locally because you don't want ever one group.
[02:49:00.260 --> 02:49:03.140]  There was saying, get rid of gridlock, let the government do whatever it wants.
[02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:04.140]  That's called Napoleon.
[02:49:04.140 --> 02:49:05.140]  Right.
[02:49:05.140 --> 02:49:06.140]  That's called Hitler.
[02:49:06.140 --> 02:49:07.140]  You do not want that.
[02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:08.140]  I love gridlock.
[02:49:08.140 --> 02:49:09.460]  I said, I'll go home.
[02:49:09.460 --> 02:49:12.260]  The gridlock was so strong that they would just have to go home.
[02:49:12.260 --> 02:49:14.780]  We're a lot safer when Congress goes home.
[02:49:14.780 --> 02:49:16.940]  And I don't want to hear they're doing this to fight al-Qaeda.
[02:49:16.940 --> 02:49:20.780]  What do you make of the fact that now it's admitted the government runs the main al-Qaeda?
[02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:25.420]  Well, you know, I haven't seen the entire evidence on that.
[02:49:25.420 --> 02:49:26.420]  I haven't seen the...
[02:49:26.420 --> 02:49:28.700]  Well, it's on record that they're using al-Qaeda in Syria.
[02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:34.820]  Well, we do know that there's 35 terrorist al-Qaeda camps here in America, at least 35
[02:49:34.820 --> 02:49:36.420]  that the government has documented.
[02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:37.700]  So there's probably more.
[02:49:37.700 --> 02:49:38.700]  But they're there.
[02:49:38.700 --> 02:49:39.700]  And why doesn't...
[02:49:39.700 --> 02:49:42.220]  If the government's going after terrorists, then why don't they go after these al-Qaeda?
[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:43.220]  Well, it's the same thing in England.
[02:49:43.220 --> 02:49:46.260]  They have radical guys on TV saying, kill everybody, take over them, they leave them
[02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:47.260]  on TV.
[02:49:47.260 --> 02:49:48.260]  And it's the same thing here.
[02:49:48.260 --> 02:49:49.380]  They've got those guys over here.
[02:49:49.380 --> 02:49:54.900]  I'm telling you, it's on record that now it's come out that they're running these
[02:49:54.900 --> 02:49:55.900]  guys.
[02:49:55.900 --> 02:49:56.900]  35...
[02:49:56.900 --> 02:50:01.740]  Well, how could 35 terrorist camps exist in America if they're not approved?
[02:50:01.740 --> 02:50:03.780]  No, I've seen those on California.
[02:50:03.780 --> 02:50:07.820]  I've seen the California news shows the guys, jihadis, running with the machine guns and
[02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:11.220]  doing all the training and preaching, we're going to take over America.
[02:50:11.220 --> 02:50:12.220]  They're here.
[02:50:12.220 --> 02:50:13.220]  They're here.
[02:50:13.220 --> 02:50:15.220]  But then I have to lose my rights with the TSA.
[02:50:15.220 --> 02:50:17.500]  See, they're using it to take our rights.
[02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:21.980]  Well, right now, and I fly all the time, and this is something that I've just come up with,
[02:50:21.980 --> 02:50:26.580]  that it's easier for a terrorist to enter America, especially through our southern border,
[02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:29.660]  than it is for you and me to get on an airplane.
[02:50:29.660 --> 02:50:31.500]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:36.060]  Vincent is someone like me who's dedicated his life to law enforcement and keeping the
[02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:37.220]  peace.
[02:50:37.220 --> 02:50:41.140]  It's easier for a terrorist to get into America than it is for me to get on an airplane.
[02:50:41.140 --> 02:50:45.220]  Well, that's because they're using the terrorist threat, the synthetic threat, to take our
[02:50:45.220 --> 02:50:46.220]  rights.
[02:50:46.220 --> 02:50:49.060]  We're going to do two more segments to take your phone calls.
[02:50:49.060 --> 02:50:54.540]  Paul, Joseph, David, we're going to get to all of you straight ahead.
[02:50:54.540 --> 02:50:55.540]  Thank you for holding.

[02:51:34.940 --> 02:51:39.180]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[02:51:39.180 --> 02:51:40.180]  to serve as debt.
[02:51:40.180 --> 02:51:43.700]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[02:51:43.700 --> 02:51:47.020]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:47.020 --> 02:51:50.460]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary

[02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:19.820]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights

[02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:07.020]  The answer is renovation teas.
[02:53:07.020 --> 02:53:10.940]  Herbal remedies are much safer and much cheaper than prescription drugs.

[02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:18.580]  Renovation tea is especially unique, and here's why.
[02:53:18.580 --> 02:53:22.380]  We spent years researching herbs and their beneficial properties.

[02:54:04.060 --> 02:54:10.700]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:54:10.700 --> 02:54:18.500]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:18.500 --> 02:54:25.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're watching on TV, here is from the 1980s, a G.I. Joe Cobra
[02:54:25.060 --> 02:54:29.420]  Hiss armored vehicle, and if you notice, that's how the police dress now, it's like a Cobra
[02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:30.420]  Trooper.
[02:54:30.420 --> 02:54:35.140]  That's how terrorists dressed in the 80s, and this is how the armored vehicles that were
[02:54:35.140 --> 02:54:37.380]  in Boston that everybody saw.
[02:54:37.380 --> 02:54:42.100]  That's exactly how they look, so we'll roll some of that footage over that, and you see
[02:54:42.100 --> 02:54:46.620]  in all the movies, this image of martial law, Sheriff Nectar, really trying to pump us for
[02:54:46.620 --> 02:54:47.620]  that, aren't they?
[02:54:47.620 --> 02:54:52.860]  It's amazing how much is being exposed by Hollywood in the movies that they're putting
[02:54:52.860 --> 02:54:54.060]  out lately.
[02:54:54.060 --> 02:54:59.500]  It's really amazing stuff just like this, and enemy of the state, I mean that was done
[02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:04.700]  about 10 years ago, but a lot of exposure from Hollywood, which I don't understand.
[02:55:04.700 --> 02:55:10.180]  What did you make of the Boston bombing and then taking half the city and locking it down
[02:55:10.180 --> 02:55:15.020]  and aiming guns at people that didn't even meet the description, or Dorner, a black guy
[02:55:15.020 --> 02:55:18.740]  they're looking for and they shoot up white women and Hispanic women in cars that don't
[02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:19.740]  even match it.
[02:55:19.740 --> 02:55:21.260]  I mean what type of mentality is that?
[02:55:21.260 --> 02:55:25.180]  Well I think the whole thing is just that, the conditioning of our own psyche for the
[02:55:25.180 --> 02:55:29.540]  American citizen to be expecting more of that, to be ready for more of that.
[02:55:29.540 --> 02:55:34.940]  Going in people's homes, no knock, no warrants, no nothing, just going in, drying down on
[02:55:34.940 --> 02:55:38.380]  everybody, checking their homes without the owner's permission.
[02:55:38.380 --> 02:55:41.340]  And it's all about the officer's safety.
[02:55:41.340 --> 02:55:44.780]  The danger to the officers is going into a tyranny.
[02:55:44.780 --> 02:55:47.460]  They're not giving you all this unconstitutional power for no reason.
[02:55:47.460 --> 02:55:49.780]  They're going to gut the country.
[02:55:49.780 --> 02:55:52.900]  And the police academies teach that, I'm afraid.
[02:55:52.900 --> 02:55:54.180]  You go home at night.
[02:55:54.180 --> 02:55:56.420]  The most important thing is you go home at night.
[02:55:56.420 --> 02:55:59.840]  There's a lot more important things than you go home at night, and that is one, keeping
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:03.100]  your oath to protect and defend the God.
[02:56:03.100 --> 02:56:05.580]  Absolutely, because if you don't, you lose everything.
[02:56:05.580 --> 02:56:06.580]  Of course.
[02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:12.580]  And I heard you talking with George Inori earlier, and exactly what you said about that.
[02:56:12.580 --> 02:56:15.820]  These people need to understand, our families are at stake also.
[02:56:15.820 --> 02:56:19.740]  The law enforcement community, the sheriff's community, all of them need to understand,
[02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:20.940]  we have a stake in this.
[02:56:20.940 --> 02:56:22.860]  This was for our kids and our grandkids.
[02:56:22.860 --> 02:56:24.340]  Inori said he had five grandkids.
[02:56:24.340 --> 02:56:25.340]  I have 10.
[02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:26.660]  I have 10.
[02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:27.660]  And I can't believe it.
[02:56:27.660 --> 02:56:31.740]  You know, my pretty little blonde girl, wife's only 55, she's got 10 grandkids.
[02:56:31.740 --> 02:56:35.020]  You know, and that's why I'm here, Alex.
[02:56:35.020 --> 02:56:36.020]  That's why I'm here.
[02:56:36.020 --> 02:56:38.380]  I love my five children and my 10 grandkids.
[02:56:38.380 --> 02:56:39.380]  And I want them to have a few.
[02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:42.260]  Well, look at how they target police and military after they're out.
[02:56:42.260 --> 02:56:44.140]  They hate you because you're trained.
[02:56:44.140 --> 02:56:46.260]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:56:46.260 --> 02:56:48.820]  This is real authoritarianism happening in America.
[02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:50.660]  Look how they hate Joe Arpaio.
[02:56:50.660 --> 02:56:51.860]  I mean, they've been going on.
[02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:55.820]  They've been going after Joe Arpaio for four and a half years now, investigating him for
[02:56:55.820 --> 02:56:57.140]  one thing or another.
[02:56:57.140 --> 02:57:00.420]  Then they put on this sham called this recall against him.
[02:57:00.420 --> 02:57:01.620]  He beats him there.
[02:57:01.620 --> 02:57:02.620]  He always wins.
[02:57:02.620 --> 02:57:04.180]  He always lands on his feet.
[02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:06.860]  The guy just turned 81 years old and he's still going strong.
[02:57:06.860 --> 02:57:07.860]  I don't look like he's 80.
[02:57:07.860 --> 02:57:08.860]  No.
[02:57:08.860 --> 02:57:11.260]  A lot of people that know Joe and they say he's the real deal.
[02:57:11.260 --> 02:57:12.260]  He is.
[02:57:12.260 --> 02:57:13.260]  He is.
[02:57:13.260 --> 02:57:14.260]  I promise you.
[02:57:14.260 --> 02:57:22.140]  Unless he's totally blown me away with his superficial nature, I'll tell you what, he,
[02:57:22.140 --> 02:57:24.500]  I've never met a more genuine person.
[02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:26.740]  I'm just telling you that's who he is.
[02:57:26.740 --> 02:57:27.740]  Tell us about this t-shirt.
[02:57:27.740 --> 02:57:28.740]  We're going to go to break and take a few calls.
[02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:29.740]  I apologize.
[02:57:29.740 --> 02:57:31.740]  He didn't want to become a member of the CSPUA.
[02:57:31.740 --> 02:57:34.740]  That's a good looking shirt.
[02:57:34.740 --> 02:57:37.940]  Who's your graphics person?
[02:57:37.940 --> 02:57:41.260]  Only Sheriff Christopher, who we're helping out in Delaware, who we're trying to save
[02:57:41.260 --> 02:57:46.540]  his job and career and all that, who's been attacked by Beau Biden.
[02:57:46.540 --> 02:57:49.700]  We're helping him and his wife actually designed this for us.
[02:57:49.700 --> 02:57:56.660]  If anybody becomes a member, I love that shot, go to cspoa.org, become a member and you get
[02:57:56.660 --> 02:57:57.660]  the shirt free.
[02:57:57.660 --> 02:57:59.660]  We'll send it out to you.
[02:57:59.660 --> 02:58:00.660]  Awesome.
[02:58:00.660 --> 02:58:01.660]  That's mine.
[02:58:01.660 --> 02:58:02.660]  The only way around the house.
[02:58:02.660 --> 02:58:03.660]  Yeah.
[02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:04.660]  It's yours.
[02:58:04.660 --> 02:58:05.660]  Police will freak out.
[02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:06.660]  I'll walk around with a sheriff shirt.
[02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:09.020]  That's a good looking shirt.
[02:58:09.020 --> 02:58:12.020]  Rex told me you like to go fishing, so you got to wear that.
[02:58:12.020 --> 02:58:13.020]  Go fishing.
[02:58:13.020 --> 02:58:14.020]  Absolutely.
[02:58:14.020 --> 02:58:15.740]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:15.740 --> 02:58:16.740]  I guess it's time to do it anyways.
[02:58:16.740 --> 02:58:19.260]  That is my son's name, Rex Jones, folks.
[02:58:19.260 --> 02:58:20.260]  He's great, isn't he?
[02:58:20.260 --> 02:58:21.260]  Oh, love the kid.
[02:58:21.260 --> 02:58:22.260]  Yes.
[02:58:22.260 --> 02:58:23.260]  What a smart kid.
[02:58:23.260 --> 02:58:24.260]  Josh.
[02:58:24.260 --> 02:58:25.260]  He's a sweetheart.
[02:58:25.260 --> 02:58:28.820]  My book's dedicated to him, so his name's always been hiding in blame view.
[02:58:28.820 --> 02:58:30.340]  Somebody has taught that kid well.
[02:58:30.340 --> 02:58:32.540]  Oh, he's much better than I ever was.
[02:58:32.540 --> 02:58:33.540]  He's going to be amazing.
[02:58:33.540 --> 02:58:36.180]  I'm telling you, God has really given me the next generation.
[02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:37.180]  He wants to fight the new world order.
[02:58:37.180 --> 02:58:38.180]  I want to know what his IQ is.
[02:58:38.180 --> 02:58:39.180]  Well, they're right back.

[03:01:13.740 --> 03:01:16.940]  or be murdered by faith and politicians.
[03:01:16.940 --> 03:01:18.540]  Sir, we are with you.
[03:01:18.540 --> 03:01:23.180]  I think that most of America is awake, and if you could just give me one minute, Alex,
[03:01:23.180 --> 03:01:30.740]  so I can give you a good, just to kind of summarize it all, so that I look at it like
[03:01:30.740 --> 03:01:36.100]  it's almost, we are all pieces on a board, sort of a chessboard, and there's a reason
[03:01:36.100 --> 03:01:40.220]  why there's a dark, a black side and a light, which is the white side.
[03:01:40.220 --> 03:01:46.900]  And whether it's Snowden or Hastings or Aaron Schwartz, we've all got to play our part on
[03:01:46.900 --> 03:01:47.900]  this board.
[03:01:47.900 --> 03:01:53.980]  I believe that Sheriff Mack is like the tip of the spear on a local level, because if
[03:01:53.980 --> 03:02:00.380]  I can wake up my sheriff and have him on our community and just our...
[03:02:00.380 --> 03:02:01.380]  Exactly.
[03:02:01.380 --> 03:02:03.820]  Once people are totally awake, it's over.
[03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:08.580]  It doesn't matter how much propaganda, how much bull, you cannot occupy a group of people
[03:02:08.580 --> 03:02:10.060]  that know you're the enemy.
[03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:14.460]  And the globalist, Sheriff Richard Mack, isn't America really occupied by the globalist?
[03:02:14.460 --> 03:02:15.460]  Yeah, they are.
[03:02:15.460 --> 03:02:21.540]  And what the caller just said is what everybody listening to your program today needs to do.
[03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:29.380]  Get ahold of your sheriff, make sure you have a relationship with your sheriff, make sure
[03:02:29.380 --> 03:02:35.380]  he has my book, make sure he's read the book, and then you vet him and make sure he's on
[03:02:35.380 --> 03:02:37.460]  board to be a constitutional sheriff.
[03:02:37.460 --> 03:02:41.340]  If he will not defend you and your freedoms and your constitution, tell him you're going
[03:02:41.340 --> 03:02:43.140]  to work to get rid of him.
[03:02:43.140 --> 03:02:49.820]  But do all this tactfully, do it honestly, do it as a patriotic American, but make sure
[03:02:49.820 --> 03:02:54.900]  you have a relationship with him and volunteer to be on his posse.
[03:02:54.900 --> 03:02:55.900]  Absolutely.
[03:02:55.900 --> 03:02:56.900]  Anything else, caller?
[03:02:56.900 --> 03:02:57.900]  Yes.
[03:02:57.900 --> 03:03:01.660]  Do you remember something that you had said, Sheriff Mack, about you quoting Lincoln?
[03:03:01.660 --> 03:03:06.140]  America will not fall from the outside, but it will fall from domestic.
[03:03:06.140 --> 03:03:07.140]  Correctly.
[03:03:07.140 --> 03:03:08.140]  Yeah.
[03:03:08.140 --> 03:03:11.900]  He said that we will never be destroyed from the outside if we lose our freedoms.
[03:03:11.900 --> 03:03:14.060]  It will be because we destroyed ourselves.
[03:03:14.060 --> 03:03:17.020]  We are there right now, and we have got to come to the...
[03:03:17.020 --> 03:03:20.380]  Well, the globalists are doing everything they can to bankrupt everybody so they can
[03:03:20.380 --> 03:03:21.380]  take control.
[03:03:21.380 --> 03:03:22.380]  They're on record.
[03:03:22.380 --> 03:03:23.380]  Right.
[03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:25.260]  That's the cloud and pivot plan, which they admit they adopted.
[03:03:25.260 --> 03:03:26.460]  They are the enemy.
[03:03:26.460 --> 03:03:28.460]  Of course they say we're the enemy.
[03:03:28.460 --> 03:03:30.520]  And there is a solution.
[03:03:30.520 --> 03:03:35.060]  We take back America, sheriff by sheriff, county by county, state by state.
[03:03:35.060 --> 03:03:36.300]  All right, caller, thank you.
[03:03:36.300 --> 03:03:37.300]  Good to hear from you.
[03:03:37.300 --> 03:03:38.460]  Joseph, thanks for holding.
[03:03:38.460 --> 03:03:39.460]  You're on the air.
[03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:40.460]  California.
[03:03:40.460 --> 03:03:42.460]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:42.460 --> 03:03:47.020]  First-time caller, new listener to the show out here in Southern California from West
[03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:48.020]  Virginia.
[03:03:48.020 --> 03:03:51.620]  And by the way, back there, they're pumping so much of that poison in the water that it's
[03:03:51.620 --> 03:03:58.780]  spewing out the faucets and globs and chunks of it for weeks at a time, at least two weeks
[03:03:58.780 --> 03:03:59.940]  out of the year.
[03:03:59.940 --> 03:04:05.780]  Out here in Southern California, it's insane what's going on out here.
[03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:10.180]  Government's been controlling everyone's minds for who knows how long they're out here
[03:04:10.180 --> 03:04:17.620]  charging every man they can with domestic violence, charging them $400 to put in domestic
[03:04:17.620 --> 03:04:20.060]  violence fund, charging hundreds of dollars.
[03:04:20.060 --> 03:04:23.060]  Yeah, they want to get everybody into the criminal justice system.
[03:04:23.060 --> 03:04:27.020]  That's why if you drink one beer now, they'll take you to jail while the government ships
[03:04:27.020 --> 03:04:28.020]  in narcotics.
[03:04:28.020 --> 03:04:34.300]  They want to get everybody in the system with a record so that you have no rights.
[03:04:34.300 --> 03:04:35.300]  Anything else, Joseph?
[03:04:35.300 --> 03:04:36.300]  Yeah.
[03:04:36.300 --> 03:04:37.300]  Yeah, I got a lot more.
[03:04:37.300 --> 03:04:42.220]  Look, I'm going to come back here real quick to have your question for our guest here since
[03:04:42.220 --> 03:04:43.220]  you held a long time.
[03:04:43.220 --> 03:04:48.260]  And then we're going to go to David and then we're going to go to empty Congress and Mark
[03:04:48.260 --> 03:04:49.860]  and a few others.
[03:04:49.860 --> 03:04:52.260]  And we're going to continue here live on the other side.
[03:04:52.260 --> 03:04:57.420]  Some stations carry this fourth hour, but everybody can find us at infowars.com forward
[03:04:57.420 --> 03:05:11.060]  slash show all the free feeds there big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you
[03:05:11.060 --> 03:05:19.780]  want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[03:05:19.780 --> 03:05:32.660]  Austin, Texas, Alex Jones, all right, we're taking phone calls, you got cut off by the
[03:05:32.660 --> 03:05:33.660]  break.
[03:05:33.660 --> 03:05:37.540]  We were talking to Joseph in California and let's comment on what he just said, I'm going
[03:05:37.540 --> 03:05:38.540]  to go back to him.
[03:05:38.540 --> 03:05:42.860]  He was talking about how now I read about these cases all the time where if your neighbor
[03:05:42.860 --> 03:05:48.340]  hears yelling, the police come and somebody goes to jail and then they'll come in without
[03:05:48.340 --> 03:05:52.020]  warrants, they'll taser people, we've all seen the videos where there's not even domestic
[03:05:52.020 --> 03:05:56.860]  violence going on or you yell at your kid in a parking lot and CPS comes and takes them
[03:05:56.860 --> 03:05:57.860]  because there's no law.
[03:05:57.860 --> 03:05:59.620]  They just call it neglect.
[03:05:59.620 --> 03:06:03.420]  Now the New Jersey Supreme Court said CPS doesn't even need to collect.
[03:06:03.420 --> 03:06:05.140]  Take any children they want for any reason.
[03:06:05.140 --> 03:06:06.740]  They ruled that last week.
[03:06:06.740 --> 03:06:07.740]  So there's this system.
[03:06:07.740 --> 03:06:12.100]  We know tyrannies go after the general public and make them criminals and then real criminals
[03:06:12.100 --> 03:06:13.100]  are left alone.
[03:06:13.100 --> 03:06:17.180]  I mean, I want to be like an illegal alien where I don't have insurance and I'm left
[03:06:17.180 --> 03:06:18.180]  alone.
[03:06:18.180 --> 03:06:19.460]  And of course there's that phenomenon.
[03:06:19.460 --> 03:06:21.420]  So what do you say to that?
[03:06:21.420 --> 03:06:25.020]  What I say is that we have got to get the sheriffs to build these barriers against all
[03:06:25.020 --> 03:06:26.020]  of that.
[03:06:26.020 --> 03:06:31.820]  We have got to have sheriffs that don't allow the CPS to take children away for those ridiculous
[03:06:31.820 --> 03:06:33.320]  and frivolous reasons.
[03:06:33.320 --> 03:06:34.940]  It's been going on for decades.
[03:06:34.940 --> 03:06:36.940]  Over a million kids a year.
[03:06:36.940 --> 03:06:38.340]  And it's big money.
[03:06:38.340 --> 03:06:40.220]  It's big money and that's why they're doing it.
[03:06:40.220 --> 03:06:47.060]  CPS is a filter of big government money and so we have to have sheriffs that don't allow
[03:06:47.060 --> 03:06:48.060]  this.
[03:06:48.060 --> 03:06:51.740]  We have sheriffs that become the guard of the county, guard of the Constitution.
[03:06:51.740 --> 03:06:54.940]  That is exactly what we're doing at CSPOA.
[03:06:54.940 --> 03:06:58.280]  All of it was born out of the book, the County Sheriff of America's Last Hope.
[03:06:58.280 --> 03:07:02.540]  We now have this very strong organization, the CSPOA.
[03:07:02.540 --> 03:07:07.180]  I'll tell you what, every one of your listeners needs to get that video through your organization
[03:07:07.180 --> 03:07:08.180]  here.
[03:07:08.180 --> 03:07:10.300]  We'll have that ready in about 10 days.
[03:07:10.300 --> 03:07:11.300]  We already have-
[03:07:11.300 --> 03:07:12.300]  Sure.
[03:07:12.300 --> 03:07:13.300]  Talk to Weldon.
[03:07:13.300 --> 03:07:14.300]  We'll get it and carry it because I know these are important events you're putting
[03:07:14.300 --> 03:07:15.300]  on.
[03:07:15.300 --> 03:07:16.780]  This is not just education.
[03:07:16.780 --> 03:07:20.940]  This is living proof that what we're doing, that the solution is working.
[03:07:20.940 --> 03:07:23.180]  You're now reaching thousands of sheriffs.
[03:07:23.180 --> 03:07:24.180]  Thousands.
[03:07:24.180 --> 03:07:25.180]  Yes.
[03:07:25.180 --> 03:07:26.180]  This is unbelievable.
[03:07:26.180 --> 03:07:27.180]  And they're scared.
[03:07:27.180 --> 03:07:28.180]  They're mad at you.
[03:07:28.180 --> 03:07:29.180]  They're correct.
[03:07:29.180 --> 03:07:30.180]  Because it's supposed to just be the foreign groups like the ADL and Southern Barbie Law
[03:07:30.180 --> 03:07:35.140]  Center are supposed to just waddle in and say, George Washington's a pig and freedom
[03:07:35.140 --> 03:07:40.060]  is scum and communism's the way and your guns are evil and we're supposed to just fall
[03:07:40.060 --> 03:07:41.180]  down and do what they say.
[03:07:41.180 --> 03:07:49.020]  I mean that we have sheriffs now standing for the 2nd Amendment in New York and in Colorado
[03:07:49.020 --> 03:07:50.020]  and in Utah-
[03:07:50.020 --> 03:07:52.020]  What do you make of them going after that sheriff in Florida?
[03:07:52.020 --> 03:07:57.540]  Well, I've talked to sheriffs numerous times and it is exactly the pattern that happened
[03:07:57.540 --> 03:07:59.900]  to me when I went after Clinton on the Brady Bill.
[03:07:59.900 --> 03:08:03.820]  The exact same pattern, except they didn't arrest me.
[03:08:03.820 --> 03:08:09.500]  The governor in Arizona was on my side, which saved my butt.
[03:08:09.500 --> 03:08:11.060]  There's several things that saved my butt.
[03:08:11.060 --> 03:08:12.060]  One of them was the NRA.
[03:08:12.060 --> 03:08:13.060]  I want to get Finch on.
[03:08:13.060 --> 03:08:14.620]  We've been in contact with him.
[03:08:14.620 --> 03:08:19.540]  Finch needs to be on and we need to do some fundraising for that guy because he doesn't
[03:08:19.540 --> 03:08:20.540]  have a job.
[03:08:20.540 --> 03:08:21.540]  He's out of work.
[03:08:21.540 --> 03:08:22.540]  His family has no income.
[03:08:22.540 --> 03:08:25.740]  He's done financially in about six weeks.
[03:08:25.740 --> 03:08:26.740]  He's done.
[03:08:26.740 --> 03:08:31.180]  Now we're taking donations for him at CSPOA, but we need to do this big time.
[03:08:31.180 --> 03:08:32.180]  Yeah.
[03:08:32.180 --> 03:08:36.700]  Well, yeah, because he stands up for the 2nd Amendment and then now if we don't back him,
[03:08:36.700 --> 03:08:37.860]  it's a war, folks.
[03:08:37.860 --> 03:08:39.580]  This is time to take action here.
[03:08:39.580 --> 03:08:41.780]  Joseph, you had one other point real quick.
[03:08:41.780 --> 03:08:45.100]  Alex, after they got me in the system, they started harassing me.
[03:08:45.100 --> 03:08:48.380]  I've never talked about planes or taps on the phone ever before in my life.
[03:08:48.380 --> 03:08:49.380]  They tap my phone.
[03:08:49.380 --> 03:08:51.300]  They listen in my house.
[03:08:51.300 --> 03:08:55.300]  They listen in on my cell phone.
[03:08:55.300 --> 03:09:01.140]  They finally, they harass me beyond belief that whatever my question would be is who
[03:09:01.140 --> 03:09:02.140]  is doing this?
[03:09:02.140 --> 03:09:05.220]  It's probably the people who are contracted by the FBI or CIA.
[03:09:05.220 --> 03:09:10.460]  I'm the half Lebanese American, and then they finally made up lies about me and took my
[03:09:10.460 --> 03:09:11.460]  daughter away from me.
[03:09:11.460 --> 03:09:16.060]  And when the cops came here and took her, they slammed my head and messed up.
[03:09:16.060 --> 03:09:20.860]  Well, what they do is they beta test the police state on groups that are authorized and now
[03:09:20.860 --> 03:09:25.180]  they're moving from Muslims to conservatives, which will be really hilarious because conservatives
[03:09:25.180 --> 03:09:27.260]  supported a lot of this evil.
[03:09:27.260 --> 03:09:31.580]  And Hitler went after unpopular groups first, the gypsies, and then moved on.
[03:09:31.580 --> 03:09:32.900]  This is a standard thing.
[03:09:32.900 --> 03:09:34.460]  I would get out of California.
[03:09:34.460 --> 03:09:37.100]  I mean, or at least get up to the middle or northern area.
[03:09:37.100 --> 03:09:41.180]  You know, one of the worst ways they track you and put you on their list is with a concealed
[03:09:41.180 --> 03:09:43.540]  carry permit.
[03:09:43.540 --> 03:09:47.060]  And I tell you, there was one time I actually went to get a concealed carry permit after
[03:09:47.060 --> 03:09:50.620]  I left the sheriff's office and I told the guy, no, and he was a friend of mine teaching
[03:09:50.620 --> 03:09:51.620]  the cops.
[03:09:51.620 --> 03:09:52.820]  I said, there's no way I can do this.
[03:09:52.820 --> 03:09:55.220]  And there is no way that anybody should have those permits.
[03:09:55.220 --> 03:09:59.180]  I'm sorry, but it, Interpol, Interpol has those lists.
[03:09:59.180 --> 03:10:04.420]  The lists go directly to the NSA and you're being watched because they know they don't
[03:10:04.420 --> 03:10:05.740]  register your gun.
[03:10:05.740 --> 03:10:07.060]  They register you.
[03:10:07.060 --> 03:10:08.060]  Yeah.
[03:10:08.060 --> 03:10:11.780]  And so, yeah, very dangerous to get on any of those government lists.
[03:10:11.780 --> 03:10:13.820]  One of the worst ones is the concealed carry permit.
[03:10:13.820 --> 03:10:18.060]  You're on every list, every state, every police agency in the world.
[03:10:18.060 --> 03:10:19.060]  All right.
[03:10:19.060 --> 03:10:20.060]  Thank you for the call, Joseph.
[03:10:20.060 --> 03:10:21.060]  Let's go to David in California.
[03:10:21.060 --> 03:10:22.060]  You're on the air.
[03:10:22.060 --> 03:10:23.060]  Yeah.
[03:10:23.060 --> 03:10:24.060]  Yes, sir.
[03:10:24.060 --> 03:10:25.060]  Okay.
[03:10:25.060 --> 03:10:26.060]  Let's call it.
[03:10:26.060 --> 03:10:27.060]  I'm a little nervous.
[03:10:27.060 --> 03:10:32.060]  I'm being on the spotlight, but I got, um, uh, let's call it.
[03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:33.060]  Yeah.
[03:10:33.060 --> 03:10:35.060]  It's still bad.
[03:10:35.060 --> 03:10:37.060]  Just try to get a quick question out.
[03:10:37.060 --> 03:10:39.060]  I'm not, um, well, I have actually a lot to say.
[03:10:39.060 --> 03:10:40.060]  Can you hear me better now?
[03:10:40.060 --> 03:10:41.060]  Not really, but go ahead.
[03:10:41.060 --> 03:10:44.060]  Um, that there are, there are two fronts from the globalist agenda.
[03:10:44.060 --> 03:10:48.420]  There's a religious and a political front and the movies in Hollywood, um, and the music
[03:10:48.420 --> 03:10:49.420]  industry.
[03:10:49.420 --> 03:10:54.060]  Uh, they're basically outlets to preach and, uh, you know, condition the human, I mean,
[03:10:54.060 --> 03:10:58.060]  condition the population to, to go with the, what they want to go with, right?
[03:10:58.060 --> 03:10:59.060]  Um, yes.
[03:10:59.060 --> 03:11:04.060]  And so what they call it, we know that, uh, the globalist at the very top, they're a
[03:11:04.060 --> 03:11:08.060]  culture and, um, you ask yourself, Oh, I mean, what do these globalist think about their
[03:11:08.060 --> 03:11:09.060]  children and what can happen to them?
[03:11:09.060 --> 03:11:15.060]  Um, you got to understand that the, um, the religion, um, and to understand the rationale,
[03:11:15.060 --> 03:11:19.220]  if, uh, if you want deeper insight on what the religion is about and what they believe
[03:11:19.220 --> 03:11:24.700]  in, I suggest you, uh, Google search John Todd, he's an ex-aluminati, uh, who went, um,
[03:11:24.700 --> 03:11:28.340]  around Christian circles, exposing the globalist and, you know, I've heard some of his recordings
[03:11:28.340 --> 03:11:29.340]  very interesting.
[03:11:29.340 --> 03:11:30.340]  Yeah.
[03:11:30.340 --> 03:11:33.940]  I mean, he's talking about how in a set, uh, like, like one of the last things they're
[03:11:33.940 --> 03:11:37.860]  going to do is they're going to go after a gun and they're going to use a, uh, a fuel
[03:11:37.860 --> 03:11:43.580]  crisis, uh, to, um, cause World War three, um, you said that like, um, in the early 70s,
[03:11:43.580 --> 03:11:44.580]  okay.
[03:11:44.580 --> 03:11:45.580]  The 80s.
[03:11:45.580 --> 03:11:46.580]  Yeah.
[03:11:46.580 --> 03:11:48.580]  So specifically, well, you have a question or comment?
[03:11:48.580 --> 03:11:55.580]  Uh, well, my, my comment is that, um, like, that according to the, to the pod that the
[03:11:55.580 --> 03:12:00.060]  child belongs to the group, they don't belong to the, uh, I mean, and they're considered
[03:12:00.060 --> 03:12:01.580]  an adult at the age five.
[03:12:01.580 --> 03:12:07.260]  They're not considered, um, like property or, I mean, uh, under the care of the, of the
[03:12:07.260 --> 03:12:08.260]  parents.
[03:12:08.260 --> 03:12:13.980]  Um, and so they also believe that they're going to come back to life and, um, they're
[03:12:13.980 --> 03:12:14.980]  going to be reincarnated.
[03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:16.820]  That's why they pushed their agenda.
[03:12:16.820 --> 03:12:22.420]  Um, so adamantly because you can imagine reincarnated the Congress we have right now.
[03:12:22.420 --> 03:12:26.020]  I mean, reincarnated as a bunch of dog crap.
[03:12:26.020 --> 03:12:27.020]  Excuse me.
[03:12:27.020 --> 03:12:28.020]  God bless you, sir.
[03:12:28.020 --> 03:12:29.220]  I, I, I get your point.
[03:12:29.220 --> 03:12:32.580]  Uh, now, I mean, the globalists are into a bunch of weird stuff.
[03:12:32.580 --> 03:12:36.660]  Um, let's go to empty Congress, speaking of Congress, uh, go ahead.
[03:12:36.660 --> 03:12:39.020]  You're on the air, sir or ma'am or whoever you are.
[03:12:39.020 --> 03:12:42.420]  Hey guys, great to talk to both of you today.
[03:12:42.420 --> 03:12:44.500]  Beautiful day here in Tennessee.
[03:12:44.500 --> 03:12:45.500]  Thank you.
[03:12:45.500 --> 03:12:46.500]  What's on your mind?
[03:12:46.500 --> 03:12:47.660]  Well, uh, a couple of things.
[03:12:47.660 --> 03:12:49.260]  Uh, I used to be a plumber.
[03:12:49.260 --> 03:12:55.500]  That was my main profession when I first got out of high school, a farmer, a plumber,
[03:12:55.500 --> 03:12:56.500]  a plumber.
[03:12:56.500 --> 03:13:00.740]  And we were talking about the water quality and how they were accusing people of being
[03:13:00.740 --> 03:13:01.940]  terrorists here in Tennessee.
[03:13:01.940 --> 03:13:06.300]  If they questioned the water, yeah, no, the, uh, there's an article in fact here it is
[03:13:06.300 --> 03:13:09.380]  right here, bureaucrat, water complaints could be active terrorism.
[03:13:09.380 --> 03:13:13.100]  This is actually in the Tennessee and, and they said a complaining as an active terror
[03:13:13.100 --> 03:13:16.540]  will may arrest you if you don't like the fluoride in your water.
[03:13:16.540 --> 03:13:18.100]  I'm not joking.
[03:13:18.100 --> 03:13:20.260]  That worshiping government's now an active terrorism.
[03:13:20.260 --> 03:13:22.620]  So, so what's your point on that, sir?
[03:13:22.620 --> 03:13:26.780]  Well, uh, when I first started as a plumber, the water was crystal clear.
[03:13:26.780 --> 03:13:32.220]  Now this is, uh, 38 now, so that's been a few years back at this point, the water is
[03:13:32.220 --> 03:13:33.220]  milky white.
[03:13:33.220 --> 03:13:34.780]  It's as white as my wife's car.
[03:13:34.780 --> 03:13:35.780]  Oh yeah.
[03:13:35.780 --> 03:13:40.140]  No, they dump on record people, and I showed articles earlier when I said this, they dump
[03:13:40.140 --> 03:13:46.620]  radioactive isotopes, lead, mercury, the so-called fluoride stuff they call it is, is up to 350
[03:13:46.620 --> 03:13:47.620]  chemicals.
[03:13:47.620 --> 03:13:50.740]  I mean, it's only about a hundred and, and that's why everybody's dying.
[03:13:50.740 --> 03:13:53.220]  I mean, the government is murdering us.
[03:13:53.220 --> 03:13:55.300]  No wonder people can't get upset, Sheriff.
[03:13:55.300 --> 03:13:56.300]  They're just brain damaged.
[03:13:56.300 --> 03:13:57.300]  Yeah, they're dying.
[03:13:57.300 --> 03:13:58.300]  They can't complain.
[03:13:58.300 --> 03:13:59.300]  Yeah.
[03:13:59.300 --> 03:14:02.020]  Whatever you do, don't get a probe here at infowarstore.com.
[03:14:02.020 --> 03:14:06.340]  Just drink the water, take the aspartame, trust the government, take all the shots.
[03:14:06.340 --> 03:14:07.540]  Don't listen to me, folks.
[03:14:07.540 --> 03:14:12.260]  Well, we know, we know two poisons for sure that they tell us are putting in water, chlorine
[03:14:12.260 --> 03:14:13.260]  and fluoride.
[03:14:13.260 --> 03:14:14.260]  Those are poisons.
[03:14:14.260 --> 03:14:15.260]  That's right.
[03:14:15.260 --> 03:14:20.100]  And again, they even take aquifer water in Austin, they know it's crystal clear and good,
[03:14:20.100 --> 03:14:22.780]  and spike it with, with all this garbage.
[03:14:22.780 --> 03:14:27.180]  But again, I went to Hot Springs for a week and happened to be a big statewide water convention
[03:14:27.180 --> 03:14:28.180]  there.
[03:14:28.180 --> 03:14:29.180]  People can look that up.
[03:14:29.180 --> 03:14:30.180]  It was about two, two months ago.
[03:14:30.180 --> 03:14:31.180]  Right when Jim Tucker died when I was there.
[03:14:31.180 --> 03:14:35.620]  It was there, they were in the hotel, the Arlington Hotel at the convention center.
[03:14:35.620 --> 03:14:41.220]  And I probably had, I don't want to exaggerate, 50 of the guys who were the headwater guys
[03:14:41.220 --> 03:14:43.620]  come up and say, I'm a listener, believe me, we know it's poison.
[03:14:43.620 --> 03:14:46.980]  We still are forced to buy it under state law, but we did not put it in the water.
[03:14:46.980 --> 03:14:48.500]  So the good news is they know.
[03:14:48.500 --> 03:14:49.980]  Yeah, they know.
[03:14:49.980 --> 03:14:50.980]  Yeah.
[03:14:50.980 --> 03:14:52.260]  But I mean, it's incredible.
[03:14:52.260 --> 03:14:55.460]  So as a plumber, what do you think all that, all that is?
[03:14:55.460 --> 03:15:00.620]  Well, basically, I mean, once they put it in there, there's nothing you can do and filter
[03:15:00.620 --> 03:15:01.620]  it.
[03:15:01.620 --> 03:15:02.620]  And once you filter it, you're good.
[03:15:02.620 --> 03:15:06.580]  But I mean, you just have to make sure your filters are up to date and make sure that you
[03:15:06.580 --> 03:15:10.740]  bought plenty of backup filters in case, you know, the economy goes to crap and you can't
[03:15:10.740 --> 03:15:11.740]  get any more.
[03:15:11.740 --> 03:15:12.740]  Yeah, it isn't a joke.
[03:15:12.740 --> 03:15:14.340]  I mean, this is a chemical weapon attack.
[03:15:14.340 --> 03:15:15.340]  Yeah, it is.
[03:15:15.340 --> 03:15:17.340]  I mean, the government is chemical weaponing us.
[03:15:17.340 --> 03:15:20.100]  I mean, they're bad guys, folks.
[03:15:20.100 --> 03:15:21.100]  I appreciate your call.
[03:15:21.100 --> 03:15:23.460]  Let's jam in one more and I apologize to the others.
[03:15:23.460 --> 03:15:27.700]  Mark in California, 1340 AM listener, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:15:27.700 --> 03:15:28.700]  Yeah.
[03:15:28.700 --> 03:15:33.140]  Follow the shining example of this listener and go door to door as I have many times
[03:15:33.140 --> 03:15:40.180]  during his live broadcast on KOMI 1340 of those of you and just say, would you please
[03:15:40.180 --> 03:15:45.300]  tune your radio to KOMI 1340 or right now and call two people don't have time to talk
[03:15:45.300 --> 03:15:46.300]  more.
[03:15:46.300 --> 03:15:47.300]  It's a very important broadcast.
[03:15:47.300 --> 03:15:52.940]  Secondly, last Tuesday, I live here in San Jose, I ran for city council as the right
[03:15:52.940 --> 03:15:55.940]  end candidate and lost to Roka here in district nine.
[03:15:55.940 --> 03:16:00.500]  But I go every once in a while to the city council and last Tuesday, I got to talk to
[03:16:00.500 --> 03:16:06.660]  them about Melissa Melton's interview with Bill Gates and how he wouldn't respond to
[03:16:06.660 --> 03:16:13.900]  her statements about eugenics or the 48,000 Indians who are permanently paralyzed.
[03:16:13.900 --> 03:16:15.500]  And anyway, it does go on the net.
[03:16:15.500 --> 03:16:16.700]  So follow me on that.
[03:16:16.700 --> 03:16:23.420]  And also I have a question to Sheriff Mack in regards to this thing with Snowden, Nancy
[03:16:23.420 --> 03:16:29.300]  Pelosi showed up here in San Jose on Saturday and said that Snowden broke the law.
[03:16:29.300 --> 03:16:32.540]  Two times she said that and she got booed.
[03:16:32.540 --> 03:16:33.540]  She got booed.
[03:16:33.540 --> 03:16:34.540]  Yeah.
[03:16:34.540 --> 03:16:38.860]  And she sure did and she just repeated herself, but I mean, what law did the guy break?
[03:16:38.860 --> 03:16:44.700]  I mean, many of us already know that the TV and the computers can watch us and listen
[03:16:44.700 --> 03:16:47.500]  to us and judge Napolitano brought that up.
[03:16:47.500 --> 03:16:50.460]  They can just flick a switch whenever they think somebody's a terrorist.
[03:16:50.460 --> 03:16:52.660]  I mean, what law does Snowden break?
[03:16:52.660 --> 03:16:56.180]  In fact, guys, in fact, guys, cue that up to her getting booed whenever you're ready
[03:16:56.180 --> 03:16:57.900]  because I'm going to keep going so we can talk to them.
[03:16:57.900 --> 03:16:58.900]  I love watching that.
[03:16:58.900 --> 03:16:59.900]  Yeah, we're going to play.
[03:16:59.900 --> 03:17:00.900]  I meant to play that.
[03:17:00.900 --> 03:17:07.660]  He did not break a law, but he broke policy and he broke also the inner rule that you
[03:17:07.660 --> 03:17:11.780]  don't embarrass the NSA.
[03:17:11.780 --> 03:17:14.740]  That's their inner rule and the FBI has the same rule.
[03:17:14.740 --> 03:17:19.340]  You can do a lot of stuff, but don't embarrass the head people there.
[03:17:19.340 --> 03:17:21.180]  And so that's really what he broke.
[03:17:21.180 --> 03:17:24.380]  And now there's tripping over each other to try to get this guy.
[03:17:24.380 --> 03:17:25.980]  Actually, I hadn't got to this yet.
[03:17:25.980 --> 03:17:26.980]  Donald Trump.
[03:17:26.980 --> 03:17:27.980]  And I appreciate your call, sir.
[03:17:27.980 --> 03:17:28.980]  God bless you.
[03:17:28.980 --> 03:17:30.980]  You're welcome.
[03:17:30.980 --> 03:17:34.100]  Donald Trump says Snowden should be assassinated.
[03:17:34.100 --> 03:17:38.220]  Extradition process and justice system are too slow for would be presidential candidates.
[03:17:38.220 --> 03:17:39.620]  So he's calling for something.
[03:17:39.620 --> 03:17:40.620]  That's against the law.
[03:17:40.620 --> 03:17:41.620]  It's illegal.
[03:17:41.620 --> 03:17:42.620]  That's illegal.
[03:17:42.620 --> 03:17:43.620]  What he's doing right there.
[03:17:43.620 --> 03:17:44.620]  That is against the law.
[03:17:44.620 --> 03:17:45.620]  He should be investigated.
[03:17:45.620 --> 03:17:48.340]  Well, I mean, I mean, it's also under NDA.
[03:17:48.340 --> 03:17:50.740]  I don't care if they say they passed law to kill citizens.
[03:17:50.740 --> 03:17:57.900]  If the if the godlike, you know, president's Barry Cetero says so, this just shows how
[03:17:57.900 --> 03:17:59.500]  this is authoritarianism.
[03:17:59.500 --> 03:18:00.500]  It's illegal.
[03:18:00.500 --> 03:18:01.500]  They're spying on all of us.
[03:18:01.500 --> 03:18:02.500]  They've been caught.
[03:18:02.500 --> 03:18:03.500]  Right.
[03:18:03.500 --> 03:18:04.500]  The the CIA director brags.
[03:18:04.500 --> 03:18:08.380]  Yeah, your dishwashers watching you to wire magazine.
[03:18:08.380 --> 03:18:09.380]  That's okay.
[03:18:09.380 --> 03:18:10.380]  Snowden goes.
[03:18:10.380 --> 03:18:11.880]  Yeah, that's all true.
[03:18:11.880 --> 03:18:15.660]  And they're spying on the media, which should already come out and the media is like, kill
[03:18:15.660 --> 03:18:16.660]  him.
[03:18:16.660 --> 03:18:17.660]  Arrest us.
[03:18:17.660 --> 03:18:21.140]  I mean, just we want to have our rights taken now.
[03:18:21.140 --> 03:18:27.140]  Actually, Trump in making that comment has put himself under a probable investigation.
[03:18:27.140 --> 03:18:28.340]  Well, it won't happen.
[03:18:28.340 --> 03:18:29.340]  They'll love it.
[03:18:29.340 --> 03:18:30.860]  No, it's like Nazi Germany.
[03:18:30.860 --> 03:18:34.140]  People said arrest arrest all these people, round them up.
[03:18:34.140 --> 03:18:35.140]  They made him a brown shirt.
[03:18:35.140 --> 03:18:38.940]  I mean, I'm gonna tell you, Donald Trump is a mega piece of trash.
[03:18:38.940 --> 03:18:43.140]  And again, he only did the whole Kenya thing to get attention for himself and then kill
[03:18:43.140 --> 03:18:44.540]  the investigation.
[03:18:44.540 --> 03:18:48.740]  And that's what I've been told by Jerry Corsi and others.
[03:18:48.740 --> 03:18:52.500]  You just follow what happened and that's a natural conclusion.
[03:18:52.500 --> 03:18:55.700]  What course he said and notice he got his casinos right after that.
[03:18:55.700 --> 03:18:56.700]  Yeah.
[03:18:56.700 --> 03:18:57.700]  Yeah.
[03:18:57.700 --> 03:18:59.300]  He was broke.
[03:18:59.300 --> 03:19:01.980]  And then all of a sudden he's a multi-billionaire again.
[03:19:01.980 --> 03:19:02.980]  Yeah.
[03:19:02.980 --> 03:19:04.940]  Donald Trump, what a disgusting thug.
[03:19:04.940 --> 03:19:05.940]  Yeah.
[03:19:05.940 --> 03:19:09.900]  I mean, he's here saying kill an American citizen that exposes crime.
[03:19:09.900 --> 03:19:10.900]  I mean, aren't the Southern probably...
[03:19:10.900 --> 03:19:12.100]  Are we gonna stand up for him?
[03:19:12.100 --> 03:19:13.100]  Yeah.
[03:19:13.100 --> 03:19:14.100]  What are they gonna...
[03:19:14.100 --> 03:19:16.100]  Oh, Snowden's car is gonna blow up.
[03:19:16.100 --> 03:19:19.100]  What would the SPLC say if you and I said that?
[03:19:19.100 --> 03:19:20.620]  That we should kill somebody else?
[03:19:20.620 --> 03:19:21.620]  Come on.
[03:19:21.620 --> 03:19:22.620]  Watch out.
[03:19:22.620 --> 03:19:23.620]  They'll edit that.
[03:19:23.620 --> 03:19:24.620]  Yeah.
[03:19:24.620 --> 03:19:25.620]  So, did not say it.
[03:19:25.620 --> 03:19:26.620]  Yeah.
[03:19:26.620 --> 03:19:29.060]  A lady called in and said, could this be a weather weapon with this tornado?
[03:19:29.060 --> 03:19:32.380]  And I said, they have major weather modification, but it's mainly weather systems.
[03:19:32.380 --> 03:19:36.620]  I said, that's tornado alley, probably a real tornado.
[03:19:36.620 --> 03:19:40.060]  They just go on the news and say that I said Obama sent a tornado and keep reporting it
[03:19:40.060 --> 03:19:42.700]  every week, just lying to their audience.
[03:19:42.700 --> 03:19:43.700]  I mean...
[03:19:43.700 --> 03:19:47.660]  A tornado hit our convention Friday night and we were evacuated right when I was giving
[03:19:47.660 --> 03:19:49.540]  Sheriff Clark his plaque.
[03:19:49.540 --> 03:19:52.820]  We were evacuated and so we were in this little tight room.
[03:19:52.820 --> 03:19:56.940]  So I huddled everybody together, got up on a chair, and I continued the presentation.
[03:19:56.940 --> 03:19:57.940]  We have all that on tape.
[03:19:57.940 --> 03:19:58.940]  Where was that?
[03:19:58.940 --> 03:20:02.100]  At the St. Charles, Missouri at the Ameristar Hotel.
[03:20:02.100 --> 03:20:03.100]  Unbelievable.
[03:20:03.100 --> 03:20:04.100]  Yeah, it was amazing.
[03:20:04.100 --> 03:20:05.180]  We didn't let him get in our way.
[03:20:05.180 --> 03:20:06.180]  We just kept doing it.
[03:20:06.180 --> 03:20:10.660]  So, it was probably Big Sis dressed in a Hitler uniform, steering the...
[03:20:10.660 --> 03:20:11.660]  It's a joke.
[03:20:11.660 --> 03:20:12.660]  MSNBC.
[03:20:12.660 --> 03:20:13.660]  Go ahead.
[03:20:13.660 --> 03:20:14.660]  Go with it, you liars.
[03:20:14.660 --> 03:20:16.700]  And she's the space alien, too.
[03:20:16.700 --> 03:20:22.580]  She said, I believe giant wasps run the New World Water from underneath the building.
[03:20:22.580 --> 03:20:24.180]  I never even made that joke before.
[03:20:24.180 --> 03:20:29.460]  Actually, it's Easter Bunny's racial, Mr. Maddow, I mean, Janet Reno, whatever her name
[03:20:29.460 --> 03:20:30.460]  is.
[03:20:30.460 --> 03:20:32.460]  People ask me why I enjoy these shows so much.
[03:20:32.460 --> 03:20:33.460]  That's ridiculous.
[03:20:33.460 --> 03:20:36.020]  I mean, these people crave power.
[03:20:36.020 --> 03:20:37.020]  What is it about bad people?
[03:20:37.020 --> 03:20:39.980]  Before we take a few final calls, we got Pelosi clipping a minute.
[03:20:39.980 --> 03:20:45.660]  I found that bad degenerates and weirdos, they hate those of us that aren't like them.
[03:20:45.660 --> 03:20:47.220]  I mean, they hate good people.
[03:20:47.220 --> 03:20:53.060]  It's like a criminal instinct to get crazier and crazier till they get caught.
[03:20:53.060 --> 03:20:58.340]  Well, it almost seems like that, but if you look at what they've done going after the
[03:20:58.340 --> 03:21:02.420]  good people of this country, and I go back to Sheriff Arpaio, here's a guy just trying
[03:21:02.420 --> 03:21:03.420]  to do his job.
[03:21:03.420 --> 03:21:07.100]  He's the only sheriff in the country, basically the only sheriff in the country really doing
[03:21:07.100 --> 03:21:10.980]  something about illegal immigration, trying to protect his people.
[03:21:10.980 --> 03:21:11.980]  He's actually...
[03:21:11.980 --> 03:21:14.180]  The crime has gone down while he was doing that.
[03:21:14.180 --> 03:21:18.540]  Now they come out and say that he was racially profiling and they still keep going after
[03:21:18.540 --> 03:21:19.540]  him.
[03:21:19.540 --> 03:21:22.740]  If a million Americans showed up in a Mexican city, we'd all be arrested.
[03:21:22.740 --> 03:21:23.740]  Yeah.
[03:21:23.740 --> 03:21:26.020]  I mean, no other country lets you do this.
[03:21:26.020 --> 03:21:27.860]  Why are we...
[03:21:27.860 --> 03:21:31.140]  Why is America supposed to just be wide open?
[03:21:31.140 --> 03:21:32.140]  We're not.
[03:21:32.140 --> 03:21:36.340]  And the crazy thing of it is that's the only thing that the federal government is assigned
[03:21:36.340 --> 03:21:38.140]  to do is protect our borders.
[03:21:38.140 --> 03:21:40.380]  They have like four law enforcement assignments.
[03:21:40.380 --> 03:21:42.700]  And this new border bill gets rid of that.
[03:21:42.700 --> 03:21:43.700]  Yeah, it does.
[03:21:43.700 --> 03:21:47.060]  I mean, the gang of eight thing, really, they named them right.
[03:21:47.060 --> 03:21:48.060]  Gang of eight?
[03:21:48.060 --> 03:21:49.060]  Yeah.
[03:21:49.060 --> 03:21:51.420]  They are a gang of criminals.
[03:21:51.420 --> 03:21:58.300]  And that whole thing is absolutely something America will not survive if this passes through.
[03:21:58.300 --> 03:21:59.300]  This is something that's irreversible.
[03:21:59.300 --> 03:22:03.220]  Well, it's like Ron Paul said, if everybody wasn't going to get welfare and all this stuff,
[03:22:03.220 --> 03:22:06.380]  and if these political groups didn't see the government as their friend, they'll do whatever
[03:22:06.380 --> 03:22:09.780]  they say on average, I mean, it's over.
[03:22:09.780 --> 03:22:14.100]  And then it's like Pat Buchanan said, when they try to take the guns, it's going to be
[03:22:14.100 --> 03:22:17.900]  a civil war, which I guess the globalist won again.
[03:22:17.900 --> 03:22:20.260]  I don't know.
[03:22:20.260 --> 03:22:21.940]  It certainly seems to be heading that way.
[03:22:21.940 --> 03:22:26.100]  And what we are doing at CSB way is trying to head all of that off at the pass.
[03:22:26.100 --> 03:22:29.140]  What better thing could a sheriff do than to head that off at the pass?
[03:22:29.140 --> 03:22:32.340]  And I'll tell you, if enough sheriffs and enough counties and cities just start doing
[03:22:32.340 --> 03:22:34.420]  the right thing, the feds can't stop it.
[03:22:34.420 --> 03:22:35.420]  That's correct.
[03:22:35.420 --> 03:22:36.620]  And there's nothing they can do.
[03:22:36.620 --> 03:22:37.860]  There's nothing they can do.
[03:22:37.860 --> 03:22:42.140]  But we have to have a good size and amount doing it.
[03:22:42.140 --> 03:22:44.380]  And our goal is to get at least 1,000.
[03:22:44.380 --> 03:22:46.620]  There's 3,100 counties in the country.
[03:22:46.620 --> 03:22:47.620]  We need at least a third.
[03:22:47.620 --> 03:22:48.620]  Absolutely.
[03:22:48.620 --> 03:22:49.620]  We need to get you on Coast to Coast to A.M.
[03:22:49.620 --> 03:22:50.620]  Yeah, let's do it.
[03:22:50.620 --> 03:22:52.220]  Well, I'm not going to bug George.
[03:22:52.220 --> 03:22:54.220]  If listeners think that's a good thing, I think it is.
[03:22:54.220 --> 03:22:55.220]  Are you still listening?
[03:22:55.220 --> 03:22:56.220]  He probably is.
[03:22:56.220 --> 03:22:57.220]  He's a great guy.
[03:22:57.220 --> 03:22:58.220]  I'm on the show tonight.
[03:22:58.220 --> 03:22:59.220]  I'll talk about you tonight.
[03:22:59.220 --> 03:23:00.220]  I'll bring it up.
[03:23:00.220 --> 03:23:02.500]  Let's go to, let's play the Pelosi clip.
[03:23:02.500 --> 03:23:06.860]  Here she is saying that Snowden's a criminal when she's a big fat criminal.
[03:23:06.860 --> 03:23:07.860]  There it is.
[03:23:07.860 --> 03:23:08.860]  Answered.
[03:23:08.860 --> 03:23:13.540]  And as far as Snowden, he did, you know, it may be a disagreement with you.
[03:23:13.540 --> 03:23:20.100]  He did violate the law in terms of releasing those documents.
[03:23:20.100 --> 03:23:21.100]  We don't know.
[03:23:21.100 --> 03:23:22.100]  I understand.
[03:23:22.100 --> 03:23:23.100]  I understand.
[03:23:23.100 --> 03:23:24.100]  I understand I'm an arrogant piece of crap.
[03:23:24.100 --> 03:23:25.100]  But I did violate the law.
[03:23:25.100 --> 03:23:36.340]  And they, and the fact is, and the fact is that again, we have to have the balance between
[03:23:36.340 --> 03:23:37.340]  security.
[03:23:37.340 --> 03:23:43.300]  Before they weren't buying on us, now it's a balance to have giant command bases built
[03:23:43.300 --> 03:23:44.300]  everywhere.
[03:23:44.300 --> 03:23:46.340]  And they're going, we listen to everything you do.
[03:23:46.340 --> 03:23:47.340]  This guy goes, yes, they are.
[03:23:47.340 --> 03:23:48.340]  Arrest him.
[03:23:48.340 --> 03:23:49.340]  Yeah.
[03:23:49.340 --> 03:23:50.340]  The balance.
[03:23:50.340 --> 03:23:51.340]  The balance.
[03:23:51.340 --> 03:23:55.060]  And they say you get security by giving up your liberty when all you ever get is hell
[03:23:55.060 --> 03:23:56.060]  on earth.
[03:23:56.060 --> 03:23:57.060]  Right.
[03:23:57.060 --> 03:23:58.060]  Yeah.
[03:23:58.060 --> 03:23:59.060]  There's no balance.
[03:23:59.060 --> 03:24:00.060]  There never has been a balance.
[03:24:00.060 --> 03:24:02.020]  They expose that there's been all these crimes taking place.
[03:24:02.020 --> 03:24:04.220]  And now they're saying they're trying to balance it.
[03:24:04.220 --> 03:24:05.220]  Come on.
[03:24:05.220 --> 03:24:08.660]  Well, plus they've had all this NSA when 9-11 and all this happened.
[03:24:08.660 --> 03:24:12.940]  The only balance we want is the states taking back the balance of power they're supposed
[03:24:12.940 --> 03:24:13.940]  to have.
[03:24:13.940 --> 03:24:17.380]  Again, folks, the balance of power is the solution.
[03:24:17.380 --> 03:24:18.380]  And that is the county.
[03:24:18.380 --> 03:24:19.380]  Absolutely.
[03:24:19.380 --> 03:24:20.380]  Let's talk to Mr.
[03:24:20.380 --> 03:24:23.060]  Mr. C on the marathon bombing drills.
[03:24:23.060 --> 03:24:24.060]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:24:24.060 --> 03:24:25.060]  Yes.
[03:24:25.060 --> 03:24:31.460]  I just wanted to say what I was watching immediately after the Boston Marathon happened, the bombing
[03:24:31.460 --> 03:24:32.460]  happened.
[03:24:32.460 --> 03:24:39.460]  I was watching different channels, different TVs on some of the new stations.
[03:24:39.460 --> 03:24:41.020]  They were saying, oh, it was okay.
[03:24:41.020 --> 03:24:42.020]  It was just a drill.
[03:24:42.020 --> 03:24:44.300]  It was just a drill.
[03:24:44.300 --> 03:24:50.780]  Then one reporter came on and said, oh, we're so lucky today that they was having a drill
[03:24:50.780 --> 03:24:55.620]  that there's so many EMTs and ambulances around to help people back up by the bombing.
[03:24:55.620 --> 03:24:56.620]  We had those clips.
[03:24:56.620 --> 03:24:58.180]  We need to put those back together for people.
[03:24:58.180 --> 03:25:01.300]  And then it turned out they had a drill, which they lot about and they said, don't look
[03:25:01.300 --> 03:25:02.300]  at that.
[03:25:02.300 --> 03:25:06.940]  And then it turned out the brothers were on CIA payroll being sent overseas again.
[03:25:06.940 --> 03:25:07.940]  Did you know that, Sheriff Mack?
[03:25:07.940 --> 03:25:08.940]  I did not know that.
[03:25:08.940 --> 03:25:11.060]  Sounds like a familiar story, doesn't it?
[03:25:11.060 --> 03:25:12.460]  Doesn't surprise me.
[03:25:12.460 --> 03:25:13.460]  Not at all.
[03:25:13.460 --> 03:25:15.380]  You know, they were going to blame it on the Tea Party in the drill.
[03:25:15.380 --> 03:25:16.380]  Did you know that?
[03:25:16.380 --> 03:25:17.900]  The Tea Party was supposed to be the bombers.
[03:25:17.900 --> 03:25:18.900]  Yeah.
[03:25:18.900 --> 03:25:19.900]  Wow.
[03:25:19.900 --> 03:25:20.900]  What do you make of that?
[03:25:20.900 --> 03:25:22.380]  As soon as it happened, that's what I was afraid was going to happen.
[03:25:22.380 --> 03:25:24.380]  Oh, it's called Operation Urban Shield.
[03:25:24.380 --> 03:25:27.300]  They had drills before, during, or supposed to have them after.
[03:25:27.300 --> 03:25:31.060]  We're a group wearing Patriot outfits, blows up the event.
[03:25:31.060 --> 03:25:33.940]  They wanted to catch up with the IRS attacking Tea Party groups, huh?
[03:25:33.940 --> 03:25:36.500]  Well, yeah, you blow yourself up and blame on them, but that didn't work.
[03:25:36.500 --> 03:25:38.940]  So then they had their cutouts who they really had out there.
[03:25:38.940 --> 03:25:43.580]  I mean, they were, the older brother was definitely a CIA operative.
[03:25:43.580 --> 03:25:49.060]  He was sent under the Big New Brzezinski groups overseas to infiltrate al-Qaeda groups who
[03:25:49.060 --> 03:25:51.300]  they're using against Russia.
[03:25:51.300 --> 03:25:52.300]  He had fake names.
[03:25:52.300 --> 03:25:53.300]  It was like to go up.
[03:25:53.300 --> 03:25:56.580]  The Russians blew his cover a few years ago and said, well, who is this guy?
[03:25:56.580 --> 03:25:57.580]  Does he work for you?
[03:25:57.580 --> 03:25:59.180]  Why is he allowed to fly on fake names?
[03:25:59.180 --> 03:26:02.060]  What's that sound like to you?
[03:26:02.060 --> 03:26:05.340]  That sounds like an operation that's going awry.
[03:26:05.340 --> 03:26:07.380]  We had calls about that and saw some of that at the time.
[03:26:07.380 --> 03:26:09.300]  We should recolate those clips.
[03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:12.380]  Have you found those clips online again, because I was just reminded of that, that they were
[03:26:12.380 --> 03:26:14.260]  saying right away, it may be a drill.
[03:26:14.260 --> 03:26:17.580]  We think it's the drill they were having, and they're like, let's not talk about the
[03:26:17.580 --> 03:26:18.580]  drill.
[03:26:18.580 --> 03:26:19.660]  Mr. C, do you have those clips?
[03:26:19.660 --> 03:26:20.660]  I can't find them.
[03:26:20.660 --> 03:26:22.300]  I don't see them online anywhere.
[03:26:22.300 --> 03:26:26.500]  Yeah, I remember it happened and I've seen them once and we need to see, we don't even
[03:26:26.500 --> 03:26:27.580]  put on our best evidence.
[03:26:27.580 --> 03:26:28.900]  It's just overwhelming.
[03:26:28.900 --> 03:26:30.740]  Send them to showtipsandinfowars.com.
[03:26:30.740 --> 03:26:31.740]  That's it.
[03:26:31.740 --> 03:26:35.060]  I apologize to Frank and Carl and Carol, but I got the most of you.
[03:26:35.060 --> 03:26:40.300]  And I'm going to go interview this guy for Obama Deception 2, and then we'll be back
[03:26:40.300 --> 03:26:43.420]  tonight at 7 o'clock central with Infowars Nightly News.
[03:26:43.420 --> 03:26:47.900]  If you have a prison planet.tv membership and you haven't shared it, please share it
[03:26:47.900 --> 03:26:50.900]  today.
[03:26:50.900 --> 03:26:58.380]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
