[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:11.000 --> 00:19.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:19.760 --> 00:33.560]  well the ADL has outdone themselves welcome ladies and gentlemen this November 18
[00:33.560 --> 00:43.760]  Wednesday edition 2009 as we accelerate into the depths of fall nearing a
[00:43.760 --> 00:50.840]  winter and the end of this this calendar year we can certainly pat ourselves on
[00:50.840 --> 00:55.880]  the back that we are making major headway against the globalist they have
[00:55.880 --> 01:01.200]  a lot of the big headcards and they've got the organization and the funds but
[01:01.200 --> 01:07.680]  the establishment is really starting to panic and try to bully the American
[01:07.680 --> 01:13.480]  people into shutting their mouths they're trying to issue a chilling effect
[01:13.480 --> 01:18.960]  edict that anyone that reads the New York Times when ban Kai moon the
[01:18.960 --> 01:25.600]  secretary general of the UN calls for world government if you say there is a
[01:25.600 --> 01:28.720]  world government when you read it in hundreds of newspapers per day now
[01:28.720 --> 01:33.600]  literally every day hundreds per day go to Google type in world government new
[01:33.600 --> 01:40.880]  world order click Google news hundreds a day thousands a week 12,000 in one day
[01:40.880 --> 01:46.080]  back during the G20 12,000 articles calling for world government in the end
[01:46.080 --> 01:56.440]  of the dollar and carbon taxes and one child policies worldwide and if you come
[01:56.440 --> 02:02.080]  out and read out of the New York Times the ADL calls you an anti-Semite I mean
[02:02.080 --> 02:09.560]  this is insane but it's just like what Chris Matthews is doing and the other
[02:09.560 --> 02:17.200]  host on especially MSNBC but CNBC CNN Anderson Cooper does it if you say that
[02:17.200 --> 02:22.240]  Obama's policies are socialistic really they're a wealth transfer to the elite
[02:22.240 --> 02:26.360]  but on the surface it is socialistic Newsweek headline we're all socialists
[02:26.360 --> 02:31.600]  now remember that cover so they could admit it's socialist but then if you say
[02:31.600 --> 02:37.560]  hey I don't want to live under socialism it doesn't work too well
[02:37.560 --> 02:42.240]  Chris Matthews the ADL comes out and attacks you ladies and gentlemen the
[02:42.240 --> 02:49.960]  ADL is now attacking Lou Dobbs, Glenn Beck, Michelle Malkin, myself in the most
[02:49.960 --> 02:59.320]  savage attacks I have ever seen and CBS news coverage, Jerusalem Post coverage,
[02:59.320 --> 03:04.360]  scores of other newspapers are now running with it and here's what's really
[03:04.360 --> 03:06.920]  wild about it I'm gonna break it all down today and tell you about the guests
[03:06.920 --> 03:14.360]  that are coming up but this is big is that they have six new reports on the
[03:14.360 --> 03:25.360]  ADL website and I am listed in five of the reports as the arch enemy I am
[03:25.360 --> 03:31.200]  listed as powerful and incredibly popular and incredibly well I mean that's
[03:31.200 --> 03:35.520]  what the New Republic did they said I mesmerize people I mesmerize them you
[03:35.520 --> 03:38.600]  mean I go oh here's the New York Times saying world government we're gonna pay
[03:38.600 --> 03:44.600]  taxes to the UN oh I'm so mesmerizing I mean come on what's mesmerizing people
[03:44.600 --> 03:48.440]  is that the mainstream media demonized anybody that talked about this in the
[03:48.440 --> 03:53.640]  last 20 years and tried to attach anti-Semitism it's actually the government
[03:53.640 --> 03:58.480]  the ADL in the media that always jump into everything and and put it in
[03:58.480 --> 04:04.360]  people's minds that it's Jews and they know what they're doing so they can then
[04:04.360 --> 04:10.920]  demonize the movement against the globalist and keep mainline folks from
[04:10.920 --> 04:14.160]  joining it where you open the newspaper up and it says world government's
[04:14.160 --> 04:18.040]  being announced and it's good well wait Alex Jones has said this for years but
[04:18.040 --> 04:21.440]  I better not talk about it because I'll be called an anti-Semite what does it
[04:21.440 --> 04:25.120]  have to do with that they're making it about that and that's why the federal
[04:25.120 --> 04:29.360]  government's been caught over and over and over again Southern Prairie Law Center
[04:29.360 --> 04:34.040]  and others running the white supremacist groups not infiltrating them running them
[04:34.040 --> 04:38.360]  that's why they have these groups attacking who me who's the number one
[04:38.360 --> 04:42.200]  enemy of the Nazis they attack me more than they attack Benjamin yet in Yahoo
[04:42.200 --> 04:48.360]  we're gonna explain how this works today this this is the deep secrets of the

[09:31.240 --> 09:34.240]  excited to tell you that she's going to be on with us to cover what's happening
[09:34.240 --> 09:40.360]  with the economy the police state and so much more we have Catherine Austin
[09:40.360 --> 09:46.320]  Fitz and she was the president of Hamilton securities group investment
[09:46.320 --> 09:49.920]  bank at financial software developers assistant secretary of housing with the
[09:49.920 --> 09:54.640]  federal housing commissioner under Bush one managing director she was number two
[09:54.640 --> 09:58.280]  at HUD basically managing director and member of the board of Wall Street firm
[09:58.280 --> 10:03.360]  Dylan Reed and co that's super high-powered Catherine has designed
[10:03.360 --> 10:07.960]  and closed over 25 billion of transactions and investments to date and
[10:07.960 --> 10:12.360]  it's led portfolio strategy for 300 billion of financial asset liabilities

[10:24.720 --> 10:36.560]  Humphrey and Catherine Austin Fitz George Humphrey will be in studio my mind
[10:36.560 --> 10:47.720]  has been racing with all of the hypocrisy with all of the corruption and
[10:47.720 --> 10:53.440]  also with the exhilaration of the fact that we are certainly making headway
[10:53.440 --> 11:00.240]  against the New World Order the the humbling realization that this radio
[11:00.240 --> 11:06.360]  show and the films I make and the websites are now being recognized across
[11:06.360 --> 11:15.400]  the globe by mainstream media publications as the most substantial
[11:15.400 --> 11:24.080]  and virulent threat to their power structure. The ADL has mirrored what has
[11:24.080 --> 11:28.480]  been said in the New Republic and Salon and in George Soros publications but
[11:28.480 --> 11:34.360]  in a much more vicious format and they've declared me the conspiracy king
[11:34.360 --> 11:41.760]  incredibly powerful incredibly influential incredibly popular and I
[11:41.760 --> 11:47.480]  don't like that I'll be honest with you to have the eye of Soron staring
[11:47.480 --> 11:52.640]  directly at me when I'm trying to get the ring under the crack of doom it's a
[11:52.640 --> 12:00.280]  little Hollywood analogy for folks it's not fun and I've been making the point
[12:00.280 --> 12:04.360]  the last six months or so that not just indicators in the media and from
[12:04.360 --> 12:08.640]  government but also dirty tricks being played on us whisper campaigns
[12:08.640 --> 12:17.320]  disinformation campaigns from all sides all angles it's creepy and then it was
[12:17.320 --> 12:22.160]  reported and then Senator Lamar Alexander also spoke on the floor about
[12:22.160 --> 12:26.840]  this there is a White House enemies list I am in the top 25 names that's
[12:26.840 --> 12:31.400]  creepy I mean I never expected and I'm and I'm talking about this from my
[12:31.400 --> 12:34.760]  perspective because it's the best way for me to be able to relay it to you I
[12:34.760 --> 12:40.840]  never expected 14 years ago when I went down and started an access TV show in a
[12:40.840 --> 12:46.400]  broom closet I the size of a broom closet out of the control room I didn't
[12:46.400 --> 12:50.520]  have any crews that are the control room myself brought a camera in there I had
[12:50.520 --> 12:59.040]  no inkling no no delusions of grandeur nothing I couldn't watch myself on
[12:59.040 --> 13:09.280]  television I hated doing it hated it but I hated watching the Democrats go after
[13:09.280 --> 13:16.440]  my guns and I hated watching the city council steal old people's property with
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.280]  thousand dollar a day fines for three inch grass by the way there's a big
[13:21.280 --> 13:25.620]  headline today in the news in Florida thousand dollar a fines for three inch
[13:25.620 --> 13:31.480]  grass funny because that's the point you can go see access TV shows I did in
[13:31.480 --> 13:36.200]  96 when I would go out and interview the old people they were because they have
[13:36.200 --> 13:39.760]  databases they target old people when you go in the hospital and you've got
[13:39.760 --> 13:43.160]  cancer and they find out you live alone it gets filed with the health
[13:43.160 --> 13:47.360]  department that you're at risk and then that's given to special units in the
[13:47.360 --> 13:50.120]  city council and then they have special predatory units in the police
[13:50.120 --> 13:55.800]  department that help shake you down first code enforcement comes and the
[13:55.800 --> 13:59.720]  police come to your door ask if you have a problem and they beat you up they
[13:59.720 --> 14:05.600]  take you to jail that happened to roll in Ellingston I mean when I found out
[14:05.600 --> 14:12.560]  that they got that that the town where I live has predatory groups in the
[14:12.560 --> 14:21.560]  government that feed on weak people as a 21 22 year old I got mad and all my
[14:21.560 --> 14:28.200]  instincts for war all my instincts for resistance are there for a reason it's
[14:28.200 --> 14:32.960]  to defend women and children and old people but they misplace our manhood
[14:32.960 --> 14:38.120]  into strutting around with high-powered weapons and camouflage and going and
[14:38.120 --> 14:43.840]  basically oppressing third-world cavemen I'm not saying you're not tough I'm not
[14:43.840 --> 14:49.640]  saying you're not brave I'm telling you all those energies are being wasted more
[14:49.640 --> 14:59.080]  than wasted they're being abused and I'm I'm nothing special I'm just somebody
[14:59.080 --> 15:05.680]  that got angry I started studying I mean I was a mainline Republican slash Ron
[15:05.680 --> 15:10.960]  Paul libertarian when I first got started and then I learned more and more and
[15:10.960 --> 15:14.560]  more I mean I'd read books about the New World Order and I'd read none dare call
[15:14.560 --> 15:21.680]  conspiracy when I was in high school but it wasn't real I didn't disbelieve that
[15:21.680 --> 15:27.760]  it was just books I'd read I wasn't consciously acting on it I wasn't
[15:27.760 --> 15:31.880]  consciously looking through that lens but let me tell you something I found the
[15:31.880 --> 15:37.600]  New World Order right here in my town where I live I found police and
[15:37.600 --> 15:44.120]  government bureaucrats who mercilessly steal innocent people's children for no
[15:44.120 --> 15:48.440]  reason just to fill quotas and make money I watched them take ranchers and
[15:48.440 --> 15:52.920]  farmers property so that city council members could take control of it and
[15:52.920 --> 15:59.480]  make hundreds of millions of dollars selling it to build high-rise hotels and
[15:59.480 --> 16:06.720]  golf courses and subdivisions and I watch good police and bureaucrats and
[16:06.720 --> 16:11.560]  people right next to them with blinders on ignoring the evil that was happening
[16:11.560 --> 16:17.560]  right in front of their face through peer pressure so I want to say to the ADL
[16:17.560 --> 16:23.640]  before I start really breaking this down piece by piece and to the George Soros
[16:23.640 --> 16:27.760]  crowd and to the neocon crowd I mean they all attack me all the
[16:27.760 --> 16:37.600]  establishment attacks me the Nazis attack me the ADL it goes after me the
[16:37.600 --> 16:41.680]  just just every group I'm sure most of you out there have seen it there's a
[16:41.680 --> 16:46.160]  concerted campaign for years but it's intensifying and I knew it was going to
[16:46.160 --> 16:51.920]  have the opposite effect because I understand I think better than some of
[16:51.920 --> 16:55.200]  the old fossils that are still running the new order system how the internet
[16:55.200 --> 17:00.520]  really works and I have confidence in my message and so I know all these
[17:00.520 --> 17:05.840]  demonization campaigns actually helped me because people want to go check out
[17:05.840 --> 17:10.560]  this Alex Jones they want to find out what all the hubbub is about and then
[17:10.560 --> 17:15.120]  they find out the true message and intellectually and in their gut and in
[17:15.120 --> 17:20.080]  their spirit they know I'm bonafide and for real warts and all I'm not perfect
[17:20.080 --> 17:24.760]  but they know the real deal because you're the real deal out there and you're
[17:24.760 --> 17:33.440]  the real power of this radio show now a lot of the old globalists are dying off
[17:33.440 --> 17:38.880]  or retiring and handing it over to the next room who still are intelligent and
[17:38.880 --> 17:47.000]  sophisticated and have even smarter people under them who are young but a
[17:47.000 --> 17:51.120]  total evolution in media in culture and everything and then they've been
[17:51.120 --> 17:56.280]  advising them for years that I am extremely dangerous to them and that
[17:56.280 --> 17:59.560]  we and that we shouldn't just be ignored that we should be demonized and
[17:59.560 --> 18:08.840]  smashed but I've seen a change in the attacks not just the massive
[18:08.840 --> 18:21.080]  intensification but a major shift from just throwing a wall of noise and lies
[18:21.080 --> 18:26.800]  up they've now stopped that bombardment and are now shifting to a new bombardment
[18:26.800 --> 18:32.960]  saying this guy is dangerous and could cause a revolution he needs to be dealt
[18:32.960 --> 18:38.120]  with and just like in the final scene of the body snatchers from the 1970s
[18:38.120 --> 18:44.000]  where the lady walks up to a friend and says Bob Bob you know did they where's

[24:05.600 --> 24:10.520]  hi Alex this is Noah from Houston it seems to me that the NSA's one of the
[24:10.520 --> 24:15.960]  primary objectives is to secure the technological monopoly of the globalists
[24:15.960 --> 24:20.520]  by developing cutting-edge technology through DARPA and then when the time is
[24:20.520 --> 24:24.840]  right allowing that technology to be patented by one of their global
[24:24.840 --> 24:28.800]  corporations that is in the military industrial complex in which they own
[24:28.800 --> 24:36.320]  my question is a is this an accurate accurate assessment of the NSA b is one
[24:36.320 --> 24:41.920]  of their primary objectives to secure this technological monopoly by not
[24:41.920 --> 24:47.080]  allowing technologies to be developed within the private sector and see what
[24:47.080 --> 24:51.720]  can we do to combat this effectively because in my opinion that is as big as
[24:51.720 --> 24:56.480]  their financial monopoly and their media monopoly is their technological monopoly
[24:56.480 --> 25:05.960]  thank you I'm in favor of you Jennings you take a walk down a trip down to your
[25:05.960 --> 25:11.960]  local Walmart and look around and about 99 of the percent of the people are
[25:11.960 --> 25:16.840]  people that you do not want to be breathing and having babies thank you
[25:16.840 --> 25:31.000]  goodbye that's the new info wars radio comment line five one two six four six
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.840]  four four four four we're playing those each and every day Monday through Sunday
[25:36.840 --> 25:44.200]  we're on the radio six days a week I'm going to address CBS nightly news the
[25:44.200 --> 25:51.160]  Jerusalem Post the ADL that all tried to savage yours truly yesterday I want to
[25:51.160 --> 26:00.920]  break down the entire paradigm coming up in the next segment but commenting on
[26:00.920 --> 26:06.120]  those two calls here in my stack I have a mainstream news article stating that
[26:06.120 --> 26:14.360]  the national security agency is offering Microsoft a patch for windows and it's
[26:14.360 --> 26:17.760]  come out in federal court many times that back doors have been built in all
[26:17.760 --> 26:23.480]  the major software systems occasionally a new encryption comes out or a new form
[26:23.480 --> 26:31.960]  of communication comes out and the CIA the FBI Interpol in Europe go after the
[26:31.960 --> 26:36.920]  groups sometimes taking them over sometimes even killing the CEOs if they
[26:36.920 --> 26:44.600]  refused to hand it over and then issue a new version with a back door and remember
[26:44.600 --> 26:48.240]  I told you over a decade ago that on-star is used to dial in and listen to you in
[26:48.240 --> 26:52.280]  your car that's now mainstream news told you 96 that your cell phones are being
[26:52.280 --> 26:55.400]  used they dial in and listen even when they're off under federal law they're
[26:55.400 --> 26:58.960]  designed to do that under federal law actually international law but the feds
[26:58.960 --> 27:03.960]  have complied it's now mainstream news again all I'm doing is telling you
[27:03.960 --> 27:09.080]  what's in the documents so yes there are at least 30 years advanced in many forms
[27:09.080 --> 27:15.960]  of technology they roll them out through select corporations IBM is a government
[27:15.960 --> 27:21.140]  front that's come out in declassified reports they were afraid of the
[27:21.140 --> 27:26.640]  Sherman anti-trust laws in the 70s and early 80s so they set up Bill Gates
[27:26.640 --> 27:29.400]  whose father was the head of Planned Parenthood and have been an army
[27:29.400 --> 27:37.680]  intelligence to give Bill Gates his own duopoly or oligopoly it's a cartel and
[27:37.680 --> 27:45.400]  so yes the world has adopted their grid notice ICANN was private but DARPA gave
[27:45.400 --> 27:51.480]  them that the registration domain name system now that was given to the United
[27:51.480 --> 28:01.000]  Nations via ICANN a month ago so the US in 45 set up the UN and then they have
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.760]  the UN absorb the United States by US the powerful interest in the US the
[28:07.760 --> 28:12.120]  United States created the internet and then gave it to the world if you believe
[28:12.120 --> 28:17.720]  that and so just as they give the world the mass technologies that have their
[28:17.720 --> 28:22.720]  back doors they sell the public cell phones that you pay money for that
[28:22.720 --> 28:25.400]  then track and trace everything you do and control your life your little
[28:25.400 --> 28:30.920]  personal computer that you carry around with you that creates a psychological
[28:30.920 --> 28:39.360]  algorithm a psychological profile of your personality type this is the data
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.120]  management system and again I would tell people about this 10 12 years ago
[28:43.120 --> 28:49.800]  because I would read it in science publications in trade publications of
[28:49.800 --> 28:53.880]  high-tech Silicon Valley Pentagon announcements defense contractor
[28:53.880 --> 28:57.400]  announcements I mean Google announced five years ago they're using the audio
[28:57.400 --> 29:04.040]  mics and video cameras standard on all new computers now to watch you and
[29:04.040 --> 29:08.760]  listen to you but they said don't worry we're only using computers to do that
[29:08.760 --> 29:13.280]  and then we have ads pop up on the screen so it isn't just where you visit
[29:13.280 --> 29:17.800]  and you give no sure on sites and you know you can be on the New York Times and

[36:52.440 --> 36:59.120]  couple more in the last month seven different national intelligence reports
[36:59.120 --> 37:04.280]  given to all police departments in the country given to the Pentagon issued to
[37:04.280 --> 37:15.680]  the FBI should I go over these reports where they lie and say that I'm making
[37:15.680 --> 37:33.760]  it up that in Arcadia that in Arcadia in the Midwest that the Pentagon announced
[37:33.760 --> 37:37.040]  in the local paper they were going to do a gun confiscation drill I mean they had
[37:37.040 --> 37:41.200]  a sergeant in the paper saying we're going to do a drill where the gun shop
[37:41.200 --> 37:45.720]  dealer sold guns illegally and we're going to go door to door asking people
[37:45.720 --> 37:52.120]  to search their homes I'm not the one that wrote that then they go and imply
[37:52.120 --> 38:03.120]  that I'm going to cause a violent attack on police and military all I did was
[38:03.120 --> 38:12.920]  read the quotes out of the newspaper they're hoping you don't go read that
[38:12.920 --> 38:18.320]  newspaper and Paul Watson's got a general piece is gonna do other pieces that go
[38:18.320 --> 38:21.600]  through the distortions and disinformation they have a whole nother
[38:21.600 --> 38:29.120]  report actually two reports where they talk about how I'm running around telling
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.440]  everyone that a world government's forming and then a world government is
[38:33.440 --> 38:40.520]  going to come and get us and that it's run by big banks well there's a problem
[38:40.520 --> 38:46.480]  ADL there's a problem CBS news there's a problem Jerusalem post there's a
[38:46.480 --> 38:55.280]  problem salon there's a problem New Republic there's a problem White House
[38:55.280 --> 39:00.160]  we're in the top 25 of the White House enemies list that's been confirmed
[39:00.160 --> 39:06.520]  mainstream media reports we've covered here the problem is every day if you go
[39:06.520 --> 39:12.080]  to a major search engine and type in the term New World Order and or world
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.920]  government or global government or death of the dollar or carbon tax you will
[39:17.920 --> 39:23.360]  get hundreds and hundreds of new stories per day now here's a few famous
[39:23.360 --> 39:28.240]  ones where they're particularly honest one of them is written by Gideon
[39:28.240 --> 39:32.360]  Reitman one of the editors at the Financial Times of London I'm sorry ADL
[39:32.360 --> 39:39.600]  the Financial Times of London does exist the headline is and now for world
[39:39.600 --> 39:47.680]  government and he goes on to say yes we need an authoritarian world government
[39:47.680 --> 39:52.480]  and yes we kept it secret from you for your own good I mean go read the article
[39:52.480 --> 40:00.360]  so I'm bad and this arch devil I've got to basically wear a yellow star it's
[40:00.360 --> 40:03.760]  like I'm in Nazi Germany they're saying we've got to be tracked we've got to be
[40:03.760 --> 40:09.560]  traced we've got to be put on no fly list we've got to you know have these
[40:09.560 --> 40:14.080]  Homeland Security and Mayak reports that we broke here written by the Southern
[40:14.080 --> 40:17.000]  Parbury Law Center and ADL that it's all pulled word for word from their
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.640]  reports where Homeland Security admits internally their whole reason for
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.040]  existing is the American people gun owners libertarians veterans conservatives
[40:26.040 --> 40:29.080]  people that don't like the private Federal Reserve people don't want to cut
[40:29.080 --> 40:33.760]  their taxes we're allowed in America to have our political views that just so
[40:33.760 --> 40:36.920]  happened to line up with the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Declaration
[40:36.920 --> 40:42.720]  of Independence you're the bad guys and they have all these articles of flotella
[40:42.720 --> 40:47.680]  of them yesterday saying it's bad and it's evil to be angry it's bad and the
[40:47.680 --> 40:56.320]  Tea Parties are bad England Beck is bad and Michelle Malkin is bad and I mean
[40:56.320 --> 41:04.400]  just basically that that everybody everybody is bad who questions
[41:04.400 --> 41:12.080]  anything and that it's un-American that we be involved in communities and that
[41:12.080 --> 41:15.840]  we be marching and that and that the American people stand up and say we're
[41:15.840 --> 41:19.440]  not turning our guns in and a particularly upset about the three
[41:19.440 --> 41:23.360]  percenters as they call themselves a lot of the military wearing those patches
[41:23.360 --> 41:32.760]  now in country the Oathkeepers they are really concerned about the military and
[41:32.760 --> 41:37.680]  police rediscovering who they really are who they should be and the police are
[41:37.680 --> 41:41.640]  feeling good and the military are feeling good about themselves becoming
[41:41.640 --> 41:46.360]  true Americans again rediscovering who their ancestors are what their birth
[41:46.360 --> 41:52.880]  right is what their family name means people that have felt horrible for
[41:52.880 --> 41:56.960]  years because subconsciously they know they're part of a bad system even if
[41:56.960 --> 42:01.680]  they themselves do a lot of good they know the systems rotten and things are
[42:01.680 --> 42:11.960]  out of control and they're upset and they're upset that veterans are reaching
[42:11.960 --> 42:17.120]  out to active duty people and that we're waking them up and that it's
[42:17.120 --> 42:22.320]  spreading like wildfire and they admit it's happening the establishment
[42:22.320 --> 42:36.440]  admits that they're losing the fight against us the peaceful fight I mean
[42:36.440 --> 42:41.400]  this is two weeks ago we can do it New York Times
[42:41.400 --> 42:52.360]  mankind moon he exists he is the UN secretary general the UN exist go over
[42:52.360 --> 42:56.760]  there to the east side of Manhattan you could see it for yourself and he calls
[42:56.760 --> 43:01.000]  for global government in this article
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.680]  force from the last paragraph a deal must include an equitable global
[43:09.680 --> 43:14.960]  governance structure all countries must be involved in deciding how the
[43:14.960 --> 43:20.480]  resources deployed manage the UN will control it but they'll listen to you
[43:20.480 --> 43:26.880]  they promise and they discuss in this article written by the UN secretary general
[43:26.880 --> 43:34.600]  how the UN will tax and regulate every facet of your life now hundreds of
[43:34.600 --> 43:38.680]  these articles a day at the point where the establishment is announcing their
[43:38.680 --> 43:43.480]  global government takeover their carbon tax the IMF to be the private center of
[43:43.480 --> 43:47.400]  the new world government run by private entries will be paying your taxes to
[43:47.400 --> 43:52.800]  Al Gore they call that a conspiracy 33 years ago he now admits it you'll be
[43:52.800 --> 43:57.600]  buying carbon carbon credits for him the UN will decide who can sell carbon
[43:57.600 --> 44:00.760]  credits to give it to all their little insider buddies I mean this is a new
[44:00.760 --> 44:08.560]  form of royalty and you can't expect the American people to just sit here
[44:08.560 --> 44:20.040]  while you do this and do nothing you can't expect the people of the world to
[44:20.040 --> 44:28.400]  sit back while financial illegitimate criminal interest conquer us now why is
[44:28.400 --> 44:33.840]  the ADL and southern property law centers the favorite vehicles by the
[44:33.840 --> 44:38.160]  private corporate networks that control government the police the military to go
[44:38.160 --> 44:42.560]  between government the federal government international government state and
[44:42.560 --> 44:46.880]  local government why are they the favorite well because that's basically a
[44:46.880 --> 44:50.400]  foreign intelligence operation on record they've been caught breaking into
[44:50.400 --> 44:54.280]  police stations moles and police stations stealing police files to create
[44:54.280 --> 44:59.720]  private files on people it's a massage operation now why is the massage used for
[44:59.720 --> 45:05.120]  this well the British intelligence US intelligence and Israeli intelligence
[45:05.120 --> 45:10.520]  all work for each other with each other and they admit that they have US spies
[45:10.520 --> 45:16.240]  spy on the Brits for the Brits British spies spy on the US for the US it's
[45:16.240 --> 45:20.240]  admitted the NSA's main snooping arms are in England that's how they would get
[45:20.240 --> 45:25.400]  around the federal laws previously and vice versa with Israel that's how they
[45:25.400 --> 45:28.680]  have another layer of plausible deniability plus you don't end up
[45:28.680 --> 45:33.520]  having an agent spying on their own family or someone who they support or
[45:33.520 --> 45:42.520]  someone they know so you have a group that's been caught been arrested before
[45:42.520 --> 45:49.120]  infiltrating police departments well now they just publicly run them and anytime
[45:49.120 --> 45:54.480]  you say oh I don't want a socialist health care plan MSNBC singing in they
[45:54.480 --> 46:00.360]  all say oh racism you hate black people that's so black people and Hispanics
[46:00.360 --> 46:05.200]  think now if this is what they're trying to sell it hasn't worked it's
[46:05.200 --> 46:08.840]  multifaceted they're telling black people in Hispanics if you care about your
[46:08.840 --> 46:14.040]  race your group you've got to be for big government socialism you know free
[46:14.040 --> 46:20.560]  markets are a old white man thing you know let the bankers and slave you will
[46:20.560 --> 46:30.400]  take good care of you here on the reservation but it's also for guilty white
[46:30.400 --> 46:34.640]  people who believe me aren't racist most of them are just worshipful of anybody
[46:34.640 --> 46:37.960]  who isn't white they hate themselves they believe whites are scum and filth
[46:37.960 --> 46:44.560]  believe me I'm white I know that makes them go well I better not be against the
[46:44.560 --> 46:47.360]  health care plan I don't want to be called a Nazi because I'm against
[46:47.360 --> 46:55.080]  socialism what does calling someone a socialist when Newsweek had the cover
[46:55.080 --> 46:58.520]  story we're all socialists now see when they're saying socialism is good it's
[46:58.520 --> 47:02.000]  okay to say it you're not a racist but if you say it you go I don't want it oh
[47:02.000 --> 47:13.720]  you don't like black people it's in my film of all the republic clip after
[47:13.720 --> 47:22.360]  clip after clip of the news saying oh look at the Tea Parties they don't like
[47:22.360 --> 47:29.200]  Obama look at this woman she's a racist Chris Matthews that Carlos Watson guy
[47:29.200 --> 47:34.120]  black guy period you are a racist no sir you're worse than a racist mr. Watson
[47:34.120 --> 47:43.800]  you're worse than a racist mr. slime bowl Chris Matthews because you consciously
[47:43.800 --> 47:47.600]  are using divide and conquer you know you're manipulating people you're
[47:47.600 --> 47:51.040]  trying to get blacks and whites everybody else fighting with each other
[47:51.040 --> 47:57.240]  for your own political gain you're cold bloodedly hijacking this country and
[47:57.240 --> 48:00.560]  taking over every sector of the economy and right out the middle of nowhere when
[48:00.560 --> 48:06.160]  no one's even thinking or talking about race you come right in the middle of the
[48:06.160 --> 48:13.280]  situation and drop it in the middle of the party drop a stink bomb right in
[48:13.280 --> 48:16.480]  the middle of the party and say oh you don't like black people you don't like
[48:16.480 --> 48:20.320]  Hispanics to get everyone in each other's throats and that's what the ADL
[48:20.320 --> 48:25.280]  does I mean I don't like Michelle Malcolm she's a worshiper of torture and
[48:25.280 --> 48:29.960]  war and corruption and by the way of Israel not good enough she's against
[48:29.960 --> 48:36.320]  socialism and the elites want that so she's demonized right alongside me Lou
[48:36.320 --> 48:40.800]  Dobbs talks about the North American Union run out of his job he's demonized
[48:40.800 --> 48:47.160]  right next to me but they say I'm the chief enemy and why because I understand
[48:47.160 --> 48:50.360]  the game and I'm teaching people the game and showing them how these people
[48:50.360 --> 48:55.680]  are operating and so Hitler was certainly bad and did kill a lot of people
[48:55.680 --> 49:05.600]  and was a bad guy and so here I am the grandson of two men who were in World
[49:05.600 --> 49:11.520]  War two volunteered for their country and I get to be lumped in I'm now Hitler
[49:11.520 --> 49:17.120]  say they get to move that black spot in European history and over and put it on
[49:17.120 --> 49:21.120]  Alex Jones who has nothing to do with it and just say oh we're the ADL we fight
[49:21.120 --> 49:25.720]  Nazis look Alex Jones doesn't like socialism they say that in these
[49:25.720 --> 49:30.200]  articles they say that in CBS they say the Jerusalem post if you don't like
[49:30.200 --> 49:35.960]  big government you are a Nazi and you're dangerous and you want violence
[49:35.960 --> 49:40.440]  doesn't matter that nine times out of ten when a synagogue or a dormitory or an
[49:40.440 --> 49:45.680]  NAACP gets a swastika spray painted on it people the police end up locally because
[49:45.680 --> 49:50.960]  the police are getting wise shutting up hidden cameras and catching the local
[49:50.960 --> 49:56.600]  black or Jewish students out there doing it game over folks you understand it's
[49:56.600 --> 50:01.480]  now come out in the Miami papers it's now come out in the Boston Globe over and
[50:01.480 --> 50:06.680]  over again top Nazis Hal Turner top Nazi rallies in Florida everywhere they're
[50:06.680 --> 50:10.720]  always feds they're run by feds and those are the groups all attacking Alex
[50:10.720 --> 50:14.880]  Jones people aren't stupid they're gonna wait the Nazis all hate Alex Jones I mean
[50:14.880 --> 50:18.360]  they spend literally on the web I'm probably the number one person attacked
[50:18.360 --> 50:24.400]  by Nazis they're not really Nazis they're feds they sick the mindless idiot
[50:24.400 --> 50:30.560]  followers they're bigoted followers on us separately I have the ADL and Southern
[50:30.560 --> 50:38.640]  Poverty Law Center now saying I'm the number one threat you understand now
[50:38.640 --> 50:46.440]  and so by trying to say someone's an anti-Semite and they don't say that about
[50:46.440 --> 50:50.960]  me they just mix me in with them but by doing that they hope to demonize anyone
[50:50.960 --> 50:55.000]  being politically involved lest you be singled out by the ADL to attempt to
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.640]  chill your free speech and shut you up so you'll accept the bondage hello ad of

[54:10.360 --> 54:15.040]  surface to have Chris Matthews coming out and saying if you criticize Obama in
[54:15.040 --> 54:22.440]  any way you are a cross-burning clansman as bad as it is to have the ADL blowing
[54:22.440 --> 54:30.040]  the trumpet and saying Alex Jones is enemy number one as bad as that is it
[54:30.040 --> 54:33.720]  shows that the establishment is getting scared and they admit in these
[54:33.720 --> 54:37.240]  articles that we're reaching tens of millions of people that we are
[54:37.240 --> 54:45.080]  incredibly popular that's a quote and that we're growing see I can look at our

[54:53.800 --> 54:57.520]  any Main Street and cars start stopping and people getting out going Alex Jones
[54:57.520 --> 55:03.520]  Alex Jones I'm a listener I mean we are huge huge and it's been completely
[55:03.520 --> 55:08.800]  underground and they've tried to ignore us like Gandhi said first they ignore
[55:08.800 --> 55:14.120]  you then they attack you then you win they have been trying to ignore us
[55:14.120 --> 55:17.960]  hoping it would go away and now they're saying okay this guy's dangerous no I'm
[55:17.960 --> 55:22.320]  not dangerous I'm not the one putting poisons in the water supply Mainstream
[55:22.320 --> 55:26.600]  News admits okay it's admitted it's in there I'm not the one feeding people GMO
[55:26.600 --> 55:30.600]  food I'm not the one telling the public there's no mercury in the vaccines when
[55:30.600 --> 55:34.400]  you read the insert and it's in there I'm just pointing out all the lies the
[55:34.400 --> 55:40.120]  people have found out that the media and the government are a bunch of liars and
[55:40.120 --> 55:44.800]  so hey ADL great write more articles saying I'm making up that there's a
[55:44.800 --> 55:48.520]  world government and they try little tricks in there like Jones says a lot
[55:48.520 --> 55:52.040]  of different groups he doesn't know which one's running it one day it's the
[55:52.040 --> 55:55.880]  Bilderberg group next it's the trilateral Commission next it's the CFR
[55:55.880 --> 56:00.440]  next it's the fellow reserve who runs the Bilderberg group CFR trilateral
[56:00.440 --> 56:05.120]  Commission fellow reserve bank like six guys they're the heads of all those
[56:05.120 --> 56:08.400]  groups those are different management arms and a corporate structure they
[56:08.400 --> 56:11.720]  write textbooks the government does bragging about it so they're high-level
[56:11.720 --> 56:18.920]  government executives and technicians can understand what's going on I mean do
[56:18.920 --> 56:26.320]  you understand that you can't continue to just say none of this exist and they're
[56:26.320 --> 56:29.720]  not stupid they're trying to create a chilling effect saying it doesn't matter
[56:29.720 --> 56:35.800]  if it exists you only say it exists Jones if it's good you don't come out and
[56:35.800 --> 56:40.840]  say it's bad or we're gonna come after you do you understand you as an American
[56:40.840 --> 56:46.800]  citizen are not allowed to speak out against the Ken lay Bernard made-off
[56:46.800 --> 56:52.320]  types because that's when those guys are pulled from the highest ranks of the
[56:52.320 --> 56:56.200]  very same crew running things they're all a bunch of crooks Goldman Sachs all
[56:56.200 --> 56:58.840]  of it and the reason they're really scared of me is because I'm going after
[56:58.840 --> 57:01.920]  the fellow reserve and I'm pointing out bypass the Democrats bypass the
[57:01.920 --> 57:08.200]  Republicans this is the key we are bringing people unity we are telling
[57:08.200 --> 57:14.400]  you whether you're black white Hispanic old young the New World Order wants you
[57:14.400 --> 57:18.200]  to be disenfranchised and dependent on them and institutionalized and they
[57:18.200 --> 57:25.680]  want you to be totally controlled they we read the UN documents on air where
[57:25.680 --> 57:32.680]  they openly state they want to lower our standard of living to control us and so
[57:32.680 --> 57:37.040]  we're here pointing that out bringing people together under principles of
[57:37.040 --> 57:43.560]  liberty and freedom and true free market and the system doesn't want that and so
[57:43.560 --> 57:48.160]  their job is to make all political discourse about race and religion to get
[57:48.160 --> 57:52.840]  us all fighting with each other they are the prevails and just like Chris
[57:52.840 --> 57:57.520]  Matthews wants to keep black people as the property of the Democratic Party by
[57:57.520 --> 58:01.680]  invoking race and telling them races to everywhere that want to get them if you
[58:01.680 --> 58:07.120]  say the word socialism but that's code for wanting to burn or shoot or lynch
[58:07.120 --> 58:12.600]  black people the ADL wants to keep Jews on the reservation they want to keep
[58:12.600 --> 58:17.760]  Jews scared Jews thinking everyone's after them they want to make it where
[58:17.760 --> 58:23.000]  when Jews here on the radio New World Order oh that's code for me see they're
[58:23.000 --> 58:28.800]  always inserting the word you into these debates you know the word black into
[58:28.800 --> 58:34.260]  the debates this is race baiting this is religion baiting this is how the great
[58:34.260 --> 58:38.280]  game is played this is how we are controlled I'll finish up with this
[58:38.280 --> 58:43.080]  topic and then I'm going to go to Roberts America's number one stories for

[1:02:54.240 --> 1:03:00.120]  level I still I still take the high road and I think Jews are intelligent
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:06.360]  hard-working smart funny neat people the Jews I've known in my life people some
[1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:09.880]  of the people I work with like Rob Jacobson who's Jewish Rob always makes

[1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:34.440]  we don't just single Israel out as the only source of corruption on the planet
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:38.800]  no Iran's corrupt and Pakistan's corrupt and Japan's corrupt and Germany's
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:44.040]  corrupt and England's corrupt Mexico's corrupt what does history show you
[1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:47.120]  governments tend to get corrupt and once they get corrupt they get more and
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:53.800]  more corrupt they devolve they degenerate I want less corruption I want
[1:03:53.800 --> 1:04:00.240]  private property rights I want to live in freedom I'm sick of the ADL and Chris

[1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:31.200]  free market maybe but you can't have a social welfare trough and then bring in

[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:02.640]  just got in for two segments here today we're very honored to have him and I
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:07.560]  just wanted to get into the drumbeat getting much faster and much louder to
[1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:12.440]  abandon the dollar IMF head says global currency change needed presses to move to
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:18.720]  the yen the yawn as the world reserve currency we've that's out of Reuters we've
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:23.080]  got open announcements of this happening but Bernanke says he's not too worried
[1:10:23.080 --> 1:10:26.880]  about it what will it mean if they continue to devalue the dollar to the
[1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:32.720]  15 month low right now gold went up to $1,150 an ounce today in futures it's
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:36.960]  trading even higher with no end in sight and now the mainstream media admits
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:40.720]  gold is going up because the dollar is being devalued amongst other things so
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:45.280]  top economist and journalist dr. Paul Craig Roberts good to have you here okay
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:51.000]  Alex just be with you okay break it down for us what we're facing and you know
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:55.400]  talk to me like I'm a six-year-old seven-year-old break down I mean it's
[1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:59.600]  one thing to talk about this three four years ago with you coming now to see it
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:08.920]  actually unfolding it's amazing yes it is isn't it I think what made the whole
[1:11:08.920 --> 1:11:15.080]  world realize that the dollar was in death row is that both the budget
[1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:21.480]  deficit and the trade deficit are so large they cannot be closed by
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:29.480]  conventional means and since there's no possibility of closing the budget or
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:37.560]  trade deficit the rest of the world sees that to continue to rely on the dollar
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:46.840]  as reserve currency which means of course it has to be a store of value if
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:53.240]  it's not a store of value you don't want it in your country running a central bank
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:59.720]  you don't want your reserves of your nation stored in something that's not a
[1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:05.600]  store of value and since the dollar is losing value and since the rest of the
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:12.520]  world doesn't see any way to stop it from losing value because the trade
[1:12:12.520 --> 1:12:19.080]  deficit is now so wise the budget deficit is so wide they're all looking for an
[1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:25.880]  alternative before the collapse because otherwise all of the international
[1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:31.720]  payments mechanism would be at risk how would they settle their account to one
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:38.480]  another when the dollar goes belly up so everyone is talking about it they're
[1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:44.720]  trying to get the tension they're trying to figure out what to do and I don't know
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:53.200]  what the what the solution will be it may be that there won't be a reserve
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:58.640]  currency that countries with strong currencies will settle with each other
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:08.680]  in their own currency it may take some time for a new system to arrive John
[1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:17.400]  Maynard King at the end of the World War II he had a proposal which did not
[1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:25.760]  require a reserve currency if you ran a surplus you had to put it you had to take
[1:13:25.760 --> 1:13:32.360]  offsetting actions to get rid of it if you ran a deficit you had to take
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:37.000]  offsetting actions otherwise you was subject to fine I don't know whether
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:45.320]  they'll bring something like that into play or not but the dollar is certainly
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:53.760]  losing its value despite the fact that most other countries are intervening to
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:59.600]  support the dollar because they don't want their currency to rise so much the
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:05.080]  twist go in and and buy a dollar to Chinese buy a dollar to Japanese buy a
[1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:12.000]  dollar all of these countries are supporting the dollar by spending their
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:18.360]  own currencies to buy it and it's still falling so this tells you that it's a
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:27.040]  bad situation for the dollar now one other thing Alex here in the short run
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:33.040]  the dollar could go back up because the low interest rate in the United States
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:39.680]  means that the dollar is being used for the carry trade like the Japanese yen
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:46.960]  was the last few years you can borrow in the United States it's a low rate and
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:53.680]  then you take that money and you invested in a higher yielding foreign asset
[1:14:53.680 --> 1:15:00.000]  and so they're getting another bubble going on that bubble burst everybody
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:05.440]  has to unwind the carry trade which means they have to demand dollars to pay
[1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:13.800]  back the dollar loans so we could have a blip up in the dollar when the current
[1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:21.480]  stock market bubble burst and they have to unwind the carry trade but the
[1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:28.560]  downward trend is is in place and there's really nothing to reverse it you
[1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:35.400]  think about the deficit this year is four times larger than last year the
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:42.720]  deficit for fiscal year 2010 is also supposed to be four times larger than
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:52.880]  2008 these are massive sums that have to be financed and the budget deficit
[1:15:52.880 --> 1:15:59.480]  greatly exceeds the trade surplus of our so-called trading partner so even if they
[1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:06.080]  recycle all the dollars they earn from their trade purposes it still doesn't
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:13.200]  cover our budget deficit so the likelihood is that they'll have to print money or
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:19.720]  print more money which will tend to spend the dollar yet lower so there you
[1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:26.600]  have a very disturbing picture that doesn't seem to have any long-term
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:32.760]  solution and that's my next question again just in layman's terms there is a
[1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:36.400]  method to the madness I mean I know for you an economist who used to run the
[1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:40.160]  Treasury Department it's hard to reconcile people this destructive but
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:44.760]  it's even come out that Goldman Sachs was telling people by housing when they
[1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:48.080]  were actually secretly betting against it and that they were doing this to
[1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:52.400]  destroy their competition to make giant profits so for this inner group they're
[1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:56.880]  making record profits and consolidating the economy Main Street is dying real
[1:16:56.880 --> 1:17:02.740]  inflation is in check to some point I want to ask you how long that will
[1:17:02.740 --> 1:17:08.040]  last but real unemployment most the index of shows above 20 not 10 like
[1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:14.160]  they're saying and so how long can this delusional statement of jobless
[1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:20.800]  recovery continue as the real economy dies and as the bankers the inner group
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:29.680]  roll around in buckets of gold and palaces of wealth I mean it's
[1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:32.840]  since I mean they obviously know what they're doing because they're making all
[1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:36.720]  the big profits out of this and meanwhile I have stacks of mainstream news
[1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:41.160]  where suddenly mainline armies is being deployed in the streets of America
[1:17:41.160 --> 1:17:44.560]  that's coming up later I mean the picture I'm trying to paint here is what
[1:17:44.560 --> 1:17:50.560]  I see it's just it's so diabolical or are you just saying they're so greedy and
[1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:56.560]  corrupt they're just like pirates snatching goods out of the burning ship
[1:17:56.560 --> 1:18:01.880]  you know I'm not even sure they're smart enough to know it's burning you're
[1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:08.440]  certain I certainly agree with you that Goldman Sachs and the banks are putting
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:13.920]  their short-term profits above everything else and they're ruining their
[1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:21.280]  own future because you know what's the dollar is not the reserve currency of
[1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:26.440]  Wall Street investment bank doesn't have anything like the power influence that
[1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:34.920]  it that it has had so by focusing on their short-term profits and it is a
[1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:44.280]  form of plunder and looting because the profits are coming at the expense of
[1:18:44.280 --> 1:18:52.280]  other people it's not a win-win trading situation so the fact that there's
[1:18:52.280 --> 1:19:00.920]  those short-term in their outlook means they're contributing to the decline that
[1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:06.920]  we've been that we've been talking about and so they're going to end up going
[1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:17.120]  down to and and they're also losing their credibility and the trust of
[1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:24.360]  financial institutions and other countries which will make it harder and
[1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:32.600]  harder for them to function in this business so I don't know if they actually
[1:19:32.600 --> 1:19:41.480]  have a plot or a plan I think they're just grabbing and they've been doing this
[1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:52.840]  all right doctor stay there we're gonna come back and I've got a few other
[1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:57.760]  questions along this line because it's obviously so important and I'm gonna try

[1:22:03.520 --> 1:22:06.880]  with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:10.800]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks
[1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:14.120]  have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:18.000]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:21.480]  your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:25.120]  will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:28.800]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:32.720]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:36.520]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:40.160]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:44.360]  I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly
[1:22:44.360 --> 1:22:48.480]  repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been

[1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:11.840]  Dr. Roberts is gonna be with us till about 40 after so this segment part of the neck
[1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:17.640]  always informative to have him on Dr. Roberts I want to get back into the
[1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:21.720]  dollar and gold and where you see all this going as you said on the show three
[1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:27.280]  years ago that within you know five years of this continued we could lose
[1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:31.200]  the dollar and you said a year ago in two years it could happen so I want to
[1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:35.440]  get your revised breakdown on that and then how this could unravel what what
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:39.960]  this means the average person's saying well if the average Joe's go well how
[1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:43.960]  does that hurt me having a weak dollar but separately Obama you mean you were
[1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:48.720]  such a critic of Bush because of his just outrageous attacks on the Bill of
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:53.600]  Rights and Constitution and tripling size of government the rest of it that at
[1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:57.480]  first you thought well we've got to repudiate Bush by supporting Obama but
[1:24:57.480 --> 1:25:01.120]  then quickly you said my gosh this guy looks like he may be worse I don't want
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:04.640]  to put words in your mouth but I read your columns every week give us your
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:11.880]  take on Barack Obama and where this guy's going well you know Alex
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:21.840]  nothing has changed he hasn't repealed the police state measures he hasn't you
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:25.760]  know he's escalated the war in Afghanistan he started anew in the
[1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:33.720]  Pakistan the one good thing possibly is he's gonna put some of those Guantanamo
[1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:42.960]  prisons on trial in the United States and this gives a chance for the lawyers
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:48.840]  for those prisons to bring the real evidence out which which if they succeed
[1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:53.840]  and are permitted by the trial judges could greatly embarrass the United
[1:25:53.840 --> 1:26:01.200]  States so you could say that this is you could interpret it I don't know how to
[1:26:01.200 --> 1:26:10.200]  interpret it that Obama is trying to change things by putting public trial
[1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:19.200]  out and it may show that the Bush actions were really inexcusable and
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:24.600]  illegal so you could look at that in a positive way but I can't think of
[1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:30.320]  anything anything else about the administration that you could see in a
[1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:36.920]  positive way he he's certainly not ended wars so he seems to be dragging his
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:42.720]  feet about further escalation in Afghanistan now what everyone has to
[1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:48.920]  understand is the president really hasn't got much power anymore because the
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:56.160]  organized lobby are more powerful than the government the financial lobby
[1:26:56.160 --> 1:27:01.080]  Goldman Sachs I mean they are the Treasury the Federal Reserve in other
[1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:04.720]  words they are the government you see what I'm saying it's an independent
[1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:11.200]  private lobby that controlling the two of the most important part of the
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:15.880]  government the investment bankers control the Treasury and the Federal Reserve
[1:27:15.880 --> 1:27:21.920]  and then you have another very powerful lobby the military security lobby and
[1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:26.160]  they control Pentagon and the State Department and they won't war because
[1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:32.240]  it makes money for them the security aspects like all the police state
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:37.000]  measures because they get more power they're less accountable and then of
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:45.360]  course we have a pack everyone knows the strength of the American Israeli what
[1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:53.520]  they call it the American Israeli public affairs committee that that is another
[1:27:53.520 --> 1:28:02.360]  extremely powerful lobby and of course they want to keep the American troop in
[1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:12.000]  the Middle East beating down opposition to Israeli territorial expansion so if
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:16.680]  you look at those three lobby and you're a mere president what are you
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:23.120]  going to do you can't what can you do you're completely boxed in so unless
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:29.880]  you're extremely clever and can find some way to expose the exposing them
[1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:36.240]  without them knowing that's what you're doing I just don't think the president
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:42.560]  has any power well that's not going to happen because those three lobbies and
[1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:47.640]  several others the big lawyer lobby as well they put Obama in and so he's
[1:28:47.640 --> 1:28:52.560]  going to continue and expand the wars he's going to continue letting Goldman
[1:28:52.560 --> 1:28:58.400]  Sachs loot the nation they're in control of the system and he's one of their
[1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:02.520]  creatures and I agree he's a teleprompter reading frontman just like Bush he's
[1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:07.520]  just better at it and better looking than Bush my whole issue is they they bring
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:11.120]  him in they build him up to mythic proportions now they're tearing him
[1:29:11.120 --> 1:29:16.040]  down that way in three years to seven years when he's gone everybody blames
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:20.080]  it on Obama has had a blaming it on the real power structure that's why I think

[1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:20.640]  2533139 going back to dr. Paul Craig Roberts dot tell folks about your
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:25.920]  latest book you've got a new edition out on the tyranny of good intentions
[1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:31.360]  Yes, there's a new edition out, a new printing and there's another book coming out I think
[1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:39.720]  within a month. Oh great. How the economy was lost. Explained the whole loss of the
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:47.080]  American economy and a counter punch is sponsoring this and it'll be out I think
[1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:52.240]  within a month. I think it's already advertised on Amazon. Sir, how important
[1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:59.920]  is it that we bear testament bear witness to who's really done this because
[1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:04.720]  the establishment obviously controls the mainstream media owns it lock stock and
[1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:08.680]  barrel right house admits they're engaging in billions of dollars of fake
[1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:13.960]  news purchasing propaganda being implanted in in mainline TV fiction
[1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:19.480]  shows not just news how important is it that every American speak out it's very
[1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:24.000]  important because if enough people could catch on possibly something could be
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:31.280]  done but it's so hard to wake people up and they get so many conflicting
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:37.000]  explanations they have their own policies and prejudices and that's why it
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:43.120]  makes it easy for the bad guys to prevail so I think it's the sort of thing
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:52.960]  you try to do very important that people need to catch on time I mean it they
[1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:57.480]  may not be able to do anything now but if they don't know what's going on they
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:03.520]  certainly can't do anything so knowing what's happening it's all is the
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:10.280]  beginning you don't get that far then you don't have any chance at all I want
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:14.360]  to finish up with the economy and again where you see it going with the current
[1:36:14.360 --> 1:36:19.240]  management clearly not changing since Bush left the same same people under
[1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:24.720]  Clinton that got rid of the last eagle but but before we do that you talk to a
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:28.440]  lot of other economists and other authors and other researchers and a lot of
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:33.600]  other high-powered mainstream people are they horrified by the fact that things
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:37.960]  are only intensifying under Obama are they upset about the dollar sliding
[1:36:37.960 --> 1:36:43.680]  towards its death I mean when you talk to those of them are in denial they're
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:50.280]  in denial and they don't understand the situation look Alex for all of this
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:58.920]  fiscal year that's just ended the budget deficit was four times larger than 2008
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:03.880]  so that's a massive fiscal stimulus in terms of conventional economic policy
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:10.760]  in addition we've had incredibly low interest rates the Federal Reserve has
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:18.400]  created massive bank reserves and yet it's had no effect on lifting the economy
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:24.560]  not the unemployment rate rises and as you've already made the point it's
[1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:30.280]  measured if you measure the way it was measured when I was in the Treasury it's
[1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:37.880]  over 20% and so this massive conventional stimulus both on monetary
[1:37:37.880 --> 1:37:43.240]  policy and fiscal policy both of us the strongest problem we we've ever had in
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:47.560]  our history they've had no effect whatsoever in lifting the economy
[1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:53.080]  houses are still going into foreclosure people are defaulting the real estate
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:58.880]  the commercial real estate thing is beginning to hit the dollar keeps
[1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:04.160]  thinking against every current you know we even talked about this it thinks
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:11.600]  against the Brazilian currency against the Botswana currency wherever you look
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:19.120]  is this sign of decline policy that the conventional policy they use fiscal
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:25.280]  stimulus monetary expansion it has no effect and yet they're all in denial they
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:29.520]  all think oh well it'll all be different soon that they even say we have a
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:33.840]  recovery look in any recession you always have an
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:39.440]  up quarter because when the recession first hits everybody stopped producing
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:43.400]  because they don't know how bad it's going to be so inventory is get depleted so
[1:38:43.400 --> 1:38:48.080]  then you have to produce something for the inventory and you get an uplift and
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:52.800]  that's all we've had that there's going to be another leg down see that's when
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:58.960]  they'll get worried when when it when the double debt arrived then all the
[1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:04.920]  mainstream conventional people in the Nile will start wondering hey what's
[1:39:04.920 --> 1:39:11.520]  going on and and until that happens they they simply don't have a clue they
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:17.440]  Paul Krugman hasn't got a clue Bernanke hasn't got a clue they don't they just
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:23.360]  don't what's happening is so different from what they've experienced in the
[1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:28.600]  past and you called all of this years ago so and I understand you like to be
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:33.040]  you know precise about things but in your gut when I mean when you're sitting
[1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:38.080]  around having dinner with your wife or family and thinking about your own
[1:39:38.080 --> 1:39:42.280]  future thinking about your children and grandchildren's future what does dr. Paul
[1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:47.560]  Craig Roberts think that this country in this world is going to look like 12
[1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:57.000]  months from now I don't know whether it'll be 12 months of 24 or 30 but when
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:02.560]  the dollar goes we're not going to be able to pay for our imports if you can't
[1:40:02.560 --> 1:40:11.040]  pay for your import see we we are two thirds dependent on energy import so you
[1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:18.160]  have a lot of transportation disruption and disruptions of food delivery to
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:23.480]  grocery stores and and you don't know when there's any gasoline and when
[1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:29.920]  they're in and probably they'll have to kind of reserve the gasoline for the
[1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:36.640]  police forces so and when you go to Walmart all the so-called cheap goods
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:43.560]  will be very expensive so when it finally happens it's going to be very bad
[1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:50.400]  now it's entirely possible the rest of the world will prop this up longer they
[1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:56.120]  may say oh we can't let this happen the Americans have nuclear weapons they're
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:41:02.320]  unstable we've got to prop it up and so they may profit it may go on for five
[1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:08.400]  or six years but it's something that they can't prop up forever even foreign
[1:41:08.400 --> 1:41:13.600]  countries you know the Chinese may say let's keep buying their debt let's keep
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:23.280]  it going until we can figure out what to do so it could it could last even after
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:29.760]  it collapses just because the rest of the world is too uncertain about what
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:36.520]  happens well if we have to pay the consequences of our moronic policy well
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:40.280]  doctor you are the economist and again listen is one of the top economists in
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:45.400]  the world but just as a layman it looks to me on Main Street like to collapse
[1:41:45.400 --> 1:41:50.400]  really happened last year and they've just covered it up with the stimulus to a
[1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:55.040]  certain extent but with unemployment over 20% in the real indexes with every
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:59.960]  economist we have on I mean if this isn't the collapse I'm gonna hate to see
[1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:03.060]  this collapse you're saying could come in a year two years three years four
[1:42:03.060 --> 1:42:12.320]  years so you're talking about I mean you that sounds road warrior a shot you
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:18.640]  know food shortages water shortages a gas shortages fuel shortages and then
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:24.920]  that's my final point in question I drove to our east Texas family farm to
[1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:29.240]  do some deer hunting with my with my children this weekend and I literally
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:35.320]  no exaggeration driving two and a half three hours probably saw 45 police cars
[1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:41.640]  I would drive there 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago in college or
[1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:46.400]  high school I might have seen three I mean it was so many police cars pulling
[1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:51.760]  people over so much and half the billboards on the roads I drove on half of
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:55.960]  them were government tattle on your neighbor tattle for child abuse tattle
[1:42:55.960 --> 1:43:02.840]  for guns so the I mean I mean I mean I'm already living in a once free great
[1:43:02.840 --> 1:43:07.200]  nation the last vestiges are being removed and it's being replaced with
[1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:13.720]  science fiction tyranny that's right well Alex at my gun club when I go to the
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:19.920]  gun club the police are there in force every day they get to use it they've
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:30.840]  got automatic weapons it sounds like a war going on there'll be 25 35 40 police
[1:43:30.840 --> 1:43:37.360]  officers there steering out led faster it's unbelievable and I asked what are
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:41.480]  you doing you practicing for some kind of competition and they said no we're
[1:43:41.480 --> 1:43:47.160]  practicing we I want to be sure my guys can win the shootout and I said shootout
[1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:55.560]  well in this was a very rich county it's no crime nothing I said shootout with
[1:43:55.560 --> 1:44:02.520]  who and they just looked at yeah it's in the shootouts with you I think that I
[1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:06.880]  think that's what they're practicing for now I have the document sir as you know
[1:44:06.880 --> 1:44:10.560]  I mean they are gearing up for all out war and don't they know they're working
[1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:16.800]  for a bunch of Bernard Madoff's that that this doesn't have no they just they're
[1:44:16.800 --> 1:44:25.480]  getting unaccountable power and you know the the police have always had a large
[1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:32.280]  contingent of bullies and they're just getting unaccountable power and they're
[1:44:32.280 --> 1:44:37.520]  going to enjoy using it well that was my final question as it implodes as we go
[1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:41.280]  into this long dark night slow incremental depression and as you're
[1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:44.160]  saying the the establishment's on the same course so it's a foregone
[1:44:44.160 --> 1:44:49.580]  conclusion don't the police know that as they're CPSing everybody's kids and
[1:44:49.580 --> 1:44:53.400]  tasering and SWAT teaming and taxing and arresting people when they're not
[1:44:53.400 --> 1:44:56.580]  going to have insurance or even money you know to pay the tickets and the
[1:44:56.580 --> 1:45:00.560]  jails are full don't the cops know that desperate people do desperate things and
[1:45:00.560 --> 1:45:05.000]  that it's a it's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy they're going to get
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:10.520]  their war and it's not going to be three crackheads they're fighting they're
[1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:16.440]  going to have to learn that no I don't think they realize that I you know look
[1:45:16.440 --> 1:45:23.840]  you know what the future may look like is a high unemployment and high inflation
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:30.400]  so it would be very threatening to the general population they'd be out of
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:38.600]  jobs and the prices would be rising and this is a this is a situation that they
[1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:44.560]  can't survive in you know it's not like the depression but you out of work but
[1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:52.000]  prices falling is that called hyper stag inflation it means that hyper stag
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:59.280]  inflation it's hyper inflationary depression that's the real danger I'm
[1:45:59.280 --> 1:46:04.400]  not absolutely certain it'll happen but I'm certain that that is the real
[1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:09.320]  danger and you're not thinking about it and not saying how can we be sure that
[1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:14.800]  doesn't happen it's not even on the radar screen well the people I know in the
[1:46:14.800 --> 1:46:19.080]  country who have been lower middle class are now on the verge of all going
[1:46:19.080 --> 1:46:24.600]  bankrupt everybody I know in the country around Austin and East Texas and I'm in
[1:46:24.600 --> 1:46:29.480]  touch with a lot of you know rural people and they say yeah we go to small
[1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:33.040]  towns one mile over the speed limit they pull us over give us tickets want to
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:37.600]  search us I mean I mean I was out in the middle of nowhere our ranch is in the
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:42.920]  middle of nowhere and I saw police every time I drove to the store 18 miles away
[1:46:42.920 --> 1:46:48.120]  I mean it's just total infestation and I guess cancer doesn't know it's cancer
[1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:54.520]  does it doc I guess not Alex my god so how do you see it all ending just in
[1:46:54.520 --> 1:46:59.080]  complete civil war maybe just like Mexico a bunch of poor people under Jack
[1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:06.120]  boots I can't probably like Mexico but you know the Joker as we have all these
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:13.600]  nuclear weapons so we don't know whether the rest of the world will say hey let's
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:20.680]  keep them going until we can figure out what to do about them or get them under
[1:47:20.680 --> 1:47:27.640]  control or but Russia had nukes and then people let it in implode yeah because
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:38.040]  that was the way we were taking it over and of course could stop that but you
[1:47:38.040 --> 1:47:43.200]  know I think that we are far more dangerous than the Russians because they
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:47.440]  were they were imploding apart because they gave up their beliefs in
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:53.160]  communism and they they lost that kind of dangerous aggressive but of course we
[1:47:53.160 --> 1:48:01.680]  just play it every minute of every day so the world knows this is a psycho
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:06.440]  decadent mad dog killing machine right I think you I think that sums it up I
[1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:10.200]  think that's the way we're perceived and I think the message with 9-11 is the
[1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:14.280]  establishment knows that anybody with a brain can tell that's an inside job so
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:17.800]  it's a double edged for the general public it's used to scare them to go
[1:48:17.800 --> 1:48:21.440]  along with the police state but for the rest of the world it's like yeah yeah
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:25.000]  we'll we'll blow these buildings up to launch wars against you that's why Gary
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:29.240]  Hart wrote that letter to Ahmed energy and said look we stage terror attacks
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:33.440]  look at the Gulf of Tonkin look at the main you better sit down and shut up I
[1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:44.520]  mean yeah it's crazy it does make you laugh is it so nice well but you know I'm
[1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:48.600]  not laughing too under no no I understand I know I mean it's just laughing at the
[1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:53.880]  craziness mm-hmm and the real craziness is that you know there's so many
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:58.320]  Americans that think themselves it's all to the earth and good people and they
[1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:02.840]  hurt us right now they would really think we were completely insane and
[1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:09.320]  anti-american and we should be arrested and shot and I guess you hear from those
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:14.080]  people from time to time but they think themselves it's just really decent people
[1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:19.120]  and they're completely brainwashed they have no clue they have no idea what's
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:26.200]  happening amazing well doctor thank you for spending so much time with us and I

[1:49:56.120 --> 1:50:02.280]  mind-blowing to watch this happening to see the IMF to see the World Bank to see
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:07.760]  the Federal Reserve saying they want a weak dollar to know they're killing the
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:11.720]  dollar our own criminal government is killing our own dollar all we have left
[1:50:11.720 --> 1:50:15.360]  on the global of the UN states they wanted the industrializes they state
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:19.720]  they want to bankrupt us even Rush Limbaugh's telling the truth now and
[1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:22.240]  saying the government wants to bankrupt things to make us all dependent
[1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:28.640]  Roberts is just a good guy and he can't believe that that they're doing all this
[1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:33.200]  by design well look they're making money at record levels they're getting all
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:37.280]  this power they're militarizing the police they're putting troops on the
[1:50:37.280 --> 1:50:44.480]  streets by design and this is all by design but either way you slice it any
[1:50:44.480 --> 1:50:51.880]  way you cut it any way you look at it any angle this is Muigrande fan this is
[1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:58.240]  classical tyranny in a big big way stay with us we've got George Humphrey coming

[1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:15.560]  of the latest headlines he wants the economic news to be to be told or to
[1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:22.560]  get out there this is from Reuters just as gold hits record record on dollar
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:29.080]  talk of India buying next one here I'm looking at market watch it says gold
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:37.180]  hits high on India talk weaker dollar next one CNN money dump the dollar by

[1:55:54.600 --> 1:56:00.720]  gold hits record high it's a Google Google news I guess gold hits record high
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:06.920]  beyond 1180 dollars per ounce right now India is negotiating buying the rest of
[1:56:06.920 --> 1:56:11.800]  that gold that the IMF was considering selling remember it was 403 metric tons
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:16.520]  of gold that they wanted to sell into the marketplace India stepped up and bought
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:22.360]  200 of those metric tons here just a short time ago about three weeks ago well
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:26.000]  that leaves a little bit of that gold left now India is talking about buying up
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:30.080]  the rest of it this is just one nation on this world that's deciding to buy up
[1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:36.280]  the the the gold that the IMF has been selling and and the market just goes nuts
[1:56:36.280 --> 1:56:41.080]  I mean right now we're looking at gold up over 1180 dollars an ounce today
[1:56:41.080 --> 1:56:48.080]  already the high has been up as high as 1188 dollars I mean obviously we're
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:51.760]  looking at 1200 dollars an ounce gold I know the Aiden sisters were talking
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:58.040]  about that Bloomberg I mean you have a whole long line whole long line of of
[1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:02.680]  analysts people that are considered to be experts in the marketplace Bloomberg
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:09.160]  typically not a gold bug not a gold bug at all but they have been talking about
[1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:13.840]  gold going up for well obviously for the last couple of years and they've been
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:18.360]  right on target Bob Chapman international forecaster another very strong
[1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:23.120]  bullish recommendation for gold I received here today and I'm gonna have
[1:57:23.120 --> 1:57:25.880]  to go through it probably gonna have to let the break go and then finish it
[1:57:25.880 --> 1:57:31.560]  congress congressman Ron Paul's campaign for Liberty letter and there's a
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:35.960]  paragraph in there that I would like to read to you just real quick and please
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:40.440]  bear with me it just says the Federal Reserve has created our problem yet it
[1:57:40.440 --> 1:57:45.400]  manages gain even more power socialism of the entire financial system the whole
[1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:50.840]  bailout process this past couple of years has been characterized by no
[1:57:50.840 --> 1:57:59.120]  oversight no limits no concerns no understanding and worst of all no common
[1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:05.680]  sense I mean that just sums it up and I you know I always have to take my hat
[1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:09.360]  off to Ron Paul I mean you hear some of the other congressmen up there in
[1:58:09.360 --> 1:58:14.520]  Congress talking about the Fed and how it should have this transparency bill
[1:58:14.520 --> 1:58:19.360]  passed but nobody leads the fight like congressman Ron Paul does we're gonna
[1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:23.040]  touch a little bit more on the economic news on the other side of this break

[2:00:26.880 --> 2:00:31.480]  asked me to come up with some economic news you know give you the give you the
[2:00:31.480 --> 2:00:35.720]  information that's going on out there I mean there's just no relief usually on
[2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:39.080]  a Thanksgiving weekend you could count that count on the fact that the Marcus
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:43.200]  would calm down and you wouldn't see a whole lot of activity but of course
[2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:47.520]  Thanksgiving is only celebrated here in the United States and places like
[2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:50.560]  India and Asia and so on and so forth that have been driving the gold and
[2:00:50.560 --> 2:00:54.040]  silver market have been just driving gold up through the roof right now
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:01:00.920]  today gold is almost hit $1,190 an ounce we are only $12 away from seeing
[2:01:00.920 --> 2:01:06.200]  $1200 an ounce gold and obviously the markets are very hot Alex asked if I
[2:01:06.200 --> 2:01:12.960]  would offer a deal same deal that I did yesterday for the gold and silver for
[2:01:12.960 --> 2:01:18.480]  gold and silver at this moment I told him I would the prices that I've had that
[2:01:18.480 --> 2:01:23.000]  I haven't been held to about a week ago here now we do have the British Sovereign
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:28.560]  and it's currently at 325 we have Frank's at 263 we have walking Liberty
[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:33.720]  halves on my goodness there at 869 that price is so far under what I would
[2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:39.480]  normally sell something like that for $20 liberties almost $300 below what my
[2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:44.880]  normal price is $10 liberties right now at 818 50 they're over $1000 if you buy
[2:01:44.880 --> 2:01:48.960]  them just outright from us without mentioning the Alex Jones show and a
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:54.280]  brand new coin from the look from the Montana from the Montana people they
[2:01:54.280 --> 2:01:59.640]  came up with a coin called the Montana Silver Reserve coin and that is trading
[2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:04.400]  right now at $22 and 63 cents I just need to tell you that the market is
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:08.280]  moving it's getting away from you if you've been considering looking for gold
[2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:13.200]  and silver as a part of your investment strategy if you haven't been I don't know
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:17.240]  where you know you should be but if you if you have been and you're thinking
[2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:21.480]  about doing it now is a great time to do it because the prices are so well
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:26.000]  discounted at this point I'm nervous as a cat doing this just due to the fact that
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:30.320]  my guess is Friday is going to open up even higher still I'm gonna then I'll
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:34.680]  have to move my prices up I just want to have a choice but you can call us here

[2:08:29.880 --> 2:08:34.720]  informative and I said why not just come in for most of an hour next week and
[2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:39.560]  we're very honored to have him with us he is a degree economist very successful
[2:08:39.560 --> 2:08:45.360]  businessman former Austin City Councilman author filmmaker and he's been

[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:52.720]  what 18 years or so two years before I got on air 14 years ago I've met George
[2:08:52.720 --> 2:08:55.880]  at some functions and events when I was just trying to understand what was
[2:08:55.880 --> 2:08:59.760]  happening so he's been a certainly a mentor to me helping me along and we've
[2:08:59.760 --> 2:09:05.200]  all grown together George is great to have you here as always as I said last

[2:09:29.480 --> 2:09:33.000]  well George it's awesome having you here with us I want to cover a lot of
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:36.600]  subjects because you're knowledgeable in them all and of course you've been
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:39.680]  your own local TV show here as well and a lot of radio so you could speak on all
[2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:43.880]  these issues first off as an economist can you explain to people how fractional
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:47.720]  reserve banking works in a nutshell how more debt is created than physical
[2:09:47.720 --> 2:09:52.400]  assets how this financial engineered system is the key to the globalist
[2:09:52.400 --> 2:09:56.280]  power because they control the issuance of currency and credit well we'll boil it
[2:09:56.280 --> 2:10:03.440]  down to about one minute and what you need to remember is the initials OTA OTA
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:14.280]  out of thin air and back in 1776 Rothschild together with when he started
[2:10:14.280 --> 2:10:18.120]  the Illuminati helped start the Illuminati they realized that by
[2:10:18.120 --> 2:10:24.760]  creating fractional reserve banking is that they could convince the people of
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:30.840]  their of the nation to put in their gold and silver and assets and give them a
[2:10:30.840 --> 2:10:35.400]  script or a piece of paper that said that they had it and then they would
[2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:42.400]  make loans based upon this script now as time went on the reserves that were
[2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:51.400]  backing the deposits got smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller now our
[2:10:51.400 --> 2:10:56.040]  founding fathers were very very hip to this each and every one of our founding
[2:10:56.040 --> 2:10:59.880]  fathers that's why they put in article one section seven and article one
[2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:05.520]  section nine that our banking system had to have gold and silver as a backing it
[2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:11.520]  was to be controlled by the public and and that money was supposed to have real
[2:11:11.520 --> 2:11:17.960]  value and not just be a commodity and of course this has been the central fight
[2:11:17.960 --> 2:11:24.560]  within our nation from 1776 through today and Washington and Jefferson and
[2:11:24.560 --> 2:11:29.960]  Madison and Thomas Payne all talked about it and then John Quincy Adams talked
[2:11:29.960 --> 2:11:33.980]  about it Andrew Jackson talked about it and they tried to kill assassinated him
[2:11:33.980 --> 2:11:38.200]  five times Abraham Lincoln came in always been the main threat to our
[2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:43.480]  country number one threat because who ever follow the money when I first we
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:49.120]  got elected on the city council I think it was I forgot who it was but they came
[2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:54.520]  into my office he said always follow the money and this is in little bitty
[2:11:54.520 --> 2:12:00.400]  Austin politics and so when you want to find out what was going on and I woke I
[2:12:00.400 --> 2:12:05.080]  got very hip to that very quick always follow the money because that is the way
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:11.280]  the puppet masters control us through the money number one and so then through
[2:12:11.280 --> 2:12:18.320]  Abraham Lincoln and and McKinley and and Ford and and then up to John F
[2:12:18.320 --> 2:12:26.160]  Kennedy and now to Dr. Ron Paul we are all talking about the the the discrepancy
[2:12:26.160 --> 2:12:31.120]  between what the Constitution says and where we're supposed to have a currency
[2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:35.840]  a banking system that's controlled by the people backed by gold and silver a
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:41.880]  hard currency versus what we have which is the Federal Reserve Banking Act and
[2:12:41.880 --> 2:12:45.840]  of course as all of you know by now there is it's not federal there's no
[2:12:45.840 --> 2:12:51.120]  reserves and it's George that's a big deal ten years ago you couldn't say as
[2:12:51.120 --> 2:12:57.680]  you all know now in major polls 75 to 80% know it's private wanted abolished or
[2:12:57.680 --> 2:13:02.880]  audited I mean we've had a complete flip I mean what 10 15 years ago maybe 5% of
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:08.600]  people knew now I mean look we've had huge success thank God I am so glad you
[2:13:08.600 --> 2:13:13.920]  brought that up because 15 years ago when I talked about this I had to speak
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:19.480]  it with a very hush voice and show all the numbers and show everything and
[2:13:19.480 --> 2:13:24.080]  people's eyes would get real wide you're saying there's nothing behind our
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:30.120]  money system the Federal Reserve is not a government agency and now almost
[2:13:30.120 --> 2:13:35.920]  everybody knows it the people at Starbucks the people at Walmart people
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:42.000]  are hip to this and we have to thank you we have to thank Dr. Ron Paul and the
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:46.160]  hundreds of thousands of patriots all around this kind of power the real
[2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:52.360]  credit goes not just to the you know the the the leaders fighting this but the
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:56.200]  people that have been person to person with the books the films the events
[2:13:56.200 --> 2:14:01.000]  they have that it is the people exactly reason the establishment hasn't just
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:04.480]  killed us you they 20 30 years ago they would kill people absolutely talking
[2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:08.760]  about this they would kill what was the fellow's name the kind of yeah Larry
[2:14:08.760 --> 2:14:13.040]  McDonald he got whacked in 1981 congressmen and senators kids and kill
[2:14:13.040 --> 2:14:17.120]  them if they spoke out but the point is now now that the idea is out there and
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:22.000]  that ideas are bulletproof they're having a big problem early on they knew
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:25.280]  they could shut it down and they could just get the few people quiet right but
[2:14:25.280 --> 2:14:29.720]  now it's too late yeah the the cat out of the bag out of the bag yeah and so
[2:14:29.720 --> 2:14:36.320]  people are getting more aware and being aware that money is the way of control
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:40.640]  and that the Federal Reserve controlled by whatever you want to call these
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:44.360]  rascals whether you want to call them the cabal the plutocracy whether you
[2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:47.920]  want to call them the Illuminati the power elite these people are in
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:52.360]  separation consciousness they're in fear and they're manipulating and
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:55.880]  controlling they're the pirates and there's always been pirates and we got
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:15:00.480]  to get that through our heads the people who control our banking systems and
[2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:04.920]  control our government are one in the same and they are manipulating and
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:09.800]  milking this economy for everything that they can and they are creating and
[2:15:09.800 --> 2:15:13.560]  it's not money they're not creating don't use the word money they're creating
[2:15:13.560 --> 2:15:22.800]  debt based currencies debt obligations debt our currency is debt yes and and it
[2:15:22.800 --> 2:15:29.400]  is absolutely the biggest mathematical scam you can get and it's like a hockey
[2:15:29.400 --> 2:15:35.040]  stick if they charge two or three if the spread is two or three percent at first
[2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:40.120]  the difference between the loans and what it is owed is very small but
[2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:45.200]  incrementally and that's one thing that the Illuminati always does is that
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:50.600]  they've worked incrementally and that patiently as as time goes on that debt
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:55.840]  based upon other debt continues to go up and so now it's going up but like a
[2:15:55.840 --> 2:16:03.760]  hockey skit stick and the actual debt on the debt is getting as big as the
[2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:10.800]  equity itself and remember with fractional reserve banking this money
[2:16:10.800 --> 2:16:16.440]  can never be paid back let's say we cut back all government spending and all
[2:16:16.440 --> 2:16:24.480]  taxes went to paying off the debt it is still mathematically impossible to pay
[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:29.160]  off the debt and of course we're not going to to stop spending we're not
[2:16:29.160 --> 2:16:34.320]  going to stop creating debt as I heard Dr. Roberts just speak and he was an
[2:16:34.320 --> 2:16:38.880]  incredible guest and I really give you a lot of credit for having him on he was
[2:16:38.880 --> 2:16:44.680]  saying as we were talking about last week this year's federal budget's debt
[2:16:44.680 --> 2:16:55.360]  is 400% greater than the year before that is absolute incredible insanity you
[2:16:55.360 --> 2:17:00.960]  can't get out of debt by digging the hole deeper you can't do it and it's
[2:17:00.960 --> 2:17:06.120]  made up debt to the private banks of course it is and and and all this money
[2:17:06.120 --> 2:17:12.760]  and is going here's the question we're approaching an end game here what do you
[2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:15.880]  think the time frame you know a few months ago filming follow Republic at
[2:17:15.880 --> 2:17:20.840]  your house we were standing around the kitchen drinking tea talking about the
[2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:24.000]  you know time frames whether it's going to be inflation or whether it's going to
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:28.600]  be depression what's going to happen with the currency how do you see this
[2:17:28.600 --> 2:17:33.320]  unfolding okay first of all we have to learn from history and in 1989 a very
[2:17:33.320 --> 2:17:39.600]  similar situation hit Japan and they had financing vehicles that were very
[2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:45.880]  similar to our derivatives and and they crashed and yet the ruling class of
[2:17:45.880 --> 2:17:50.400]  Japan would not flush those out of the system because they were protecting the
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:56.840]  ruling class now Japan is the most productive nation per capita they have
[2:17:56.840 --> 2:18:01.560]  just glistening industry incredibly hard-working focused people so you give
[2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:06.080]  us the same recipe but with our big welfare state and laziness we're dead
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:13.600]  me yes and Japan in the period of time since 1989 their amount of monies that
[2:18:13.600 --> 2:18:18.080]  they have spent from their federal government trying to fix this situation
[2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:23.400]  has been approximately equal to what we're doing right now and Japan even
[2:18:23.400 --> 2:18:28.040]  though they're one of the world's leading exporters they're incredibly
[2:18:28.040 --> 2:18:33.760]  technologically advanced they have had 20 years of recession the Niki was at
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:39.520]  39,000 it's 9,000 right now the real estate boom has gone down and I go to
[2:18:39.520 --> 2:18:43.800]  Japan all the time I'm gonna be going there shortly and it's an amazing place
[2:18:43.800 --> 2:18:48.440]  these people work they're educated and they're focused on creating money and
[2:18:48.440 --> 2:18:53.920]  they've been going for 20 years and they're still in the hole because all
[2:18:53.920 --> 2:18:59.040]  the money that they're producing all their profits is going to pay the interest
[2:18:59.040 --> 2:19:04.560]  on their derivatives it's called the Japan syndrome and so we are in a very
[2:19:04.560 --> 2:19:11.600]  very similar situation but worse but worse but worse and what is even what I
[2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:18.600]  consider to be worse is the quality of the consciousness and the energy of the
[2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:25.520]  people in this country we used to be that most hard-working self-sufficient
[2:19:25.520 --> 2:19:30.640]  freedom-loving honest people in the whole country in the whole world we're
[2:19:30.640 --> 2:19:34.680]  making generalizations we're not saying everybody's bad it's just that you go
[2:19:34.680 --> 2:19:38.560]  out there we're a lot of demonic goblin people I mean they're not really evil
[2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:42.560]  people in in in I'm glad you said you know sometimes you know and in talking
[2:19:42.560 --> 2:19:47.000]  about this stuff you know there's there are so many good we've aborted 51
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:51.920]  million babies yeah CPS kidnaps a million kids a year if you take a look at

[2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:36.520]  people a chance 1-800-259-9231 George you were trying to make a point before we
[2:24:36.520 --> 2:24:40.120]  went to break but I wanted to make this point it's a double-edged sword not only
[2:24:40.120 --> 2:24:46.680]  for 15 years have I been speaking out or 14 years on air you 18 or more and many
[2:24:46.680 --> 2:24:52.520]  others for decades like Ron Paul 30 plus years it takes time to do this the
[2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:56.640]  globalist love to give us an instant gratification society where we expect
[2:24:56.640 --> 2:25:00.560]  everything instantly but they understand the power of taking their time so
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:04.120]  that's why we need to counter them with that knowing that we're not going to see
[2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:07.560]  instant results when we do something it takes time to go out and bounce around
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:13.520]  and grow it's like seeds it's like growing a crop right absolutely and the
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:18.320]  question is is that every one of us has a choice in front of us we all have a
[2:25:18.320 --> 2:25:25.000]  choice do we actually believe that freedom and sovereignty and the highest
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:30.040]  values of the Constitution are something that are positive for our nation
[2:25:30.040 --> 2:25:34.640]  for our community for our families and for ourselves and most people will go oh
[2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:40.160]  yeah yeah of course it is but do is this something that is really is freedom and
[2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:45.840]  sovereignty for ourselves and in the coming future important because you and
[2:25:45.840 --> 2:25:48.720]  Sharon well the head producer we're talking during the break he was saying
[2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:52.080]  all his friends know the wars are for money everybody knows the banks are
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:55.960]  right being us well we shouldn't just take this like a crack or being beaten
[2:25:55.960 --> 2:26:02.080]  exactly and this is part of the massive massive mind control and this is not just
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:06.880]  this is just not words is that the Illuminati or the power leader whatever
[2:26:06.880 --> 2:26:11.080]  you want to call these rascals have created the most amazing and the most
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:17.400]  subtle mind control at every different level physical emotional spiritual
[2:26:17.400 --> 2:26:23.880]  electronic at all different levels to interrupt our our chakra system to
[2:26:23.880 --> 2:26:28.520]  interrupt our endocrine system to interrupt the way that we as human
[2:26:28.520 --> 2:26:34.400]  beings are able to intellectually process information and that's what all the
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:39.120]  globalists that when we cover this in endgame they admit they're poisoning us
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:42.880]  they're poisoning our food and water to make us more easily controlled oh it's
[2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:52.240]  it's amazing I mean in 1942 through 1945 both Ada uncle Adolf Hitler and uncle
[2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:58.080]  Joseph Stalin were putting fluoride into their concentration camps because
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:02.480]  fluoride is a thyroid inhibitor and that's in a Pulitzer Prize winning book
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:05.920]  that's that came out in Nuremberg that is not a conspiracy of course of course
[2:27:05.920 --> 2:27:14.120]  this is fact and it's been fact for 50 and they do it here and the local media
[2:27:14.120 --> 2:27:16.640]  likes to laugh and feel like they're part of the establishment and even though
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:19.600]  we've got probably a hundred thousand Austinites awake and we're all over the
[2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:24.440]  country we can't get it out of our water yeah and so massive amounts of fluoride
[2:27:24.440 --> 2:27:28.720]  in Florida was they start putting in the water in the late 1880s because the
[2:27:28.720 --> 2:27:33.440]  aluminum industry had nowhere to put their toxic waste and they cooked up
[2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:39.880]  these false studies to show that would protect teeth which is absolute BS and
[2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:44.960]  every independent study has shown that fluoride does not protect teeth and
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:49.480]  what's really important of all the water that goes through the city water less
[2:27:49.480 --> 2:27:54.560]  than one half of 1% of the water that goes through the taps is actually taken
[2:27:54.560 --> 2:28:00.280]  in and used for drinking water and so this whole concept is absolutely sealed
[2:28:00.280 --> 2:28:04.320]  so let's say that fluoride really did help tooth decay which it does not
[2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:09.200]  there's better ways topical ways of using it gives you fluorosis it causes bone
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:12.680]  cancer it's let's just say it's good why don't they say to it topically no we're
[2:28:12.680 --> 2:28:15.920]  gonna put it in the water because now they're using it as a pesticide on
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:20.440]  crops and and for years it kills bugs but we're gonna drink it and for years and
[2:28:20.440 --> 2:28:25.640]  years back in the 30s 40s and 50s the number one ingredient the number one
[2:28:25.640 --> 2:28:30.520]  ingredient in rat poison was fluoride and so you could still buy it where it
[2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:36.240]  says fluoride in the back it's decon rat poison and so not only are we
[2:28:36.240 --> 2:28:40.680]  interrupting our thyroid because of the thought all all the endocrine system and
[2:28:40.680 --> 2:28:45.520]  if you look here are the concepts of chakras the way human beings connect
[2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:50.640]  within their own conscious development the electrical system in the body exactly
[2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:57.920]  exactly and not in our pituitary is being messed up with aspartame the chem
[2:28:57.920 --> 2:29:02.880]  trails are coming in and MSG MS mercury and that will be what about the
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:06.440]  media saying there's no mercury in the flu shot when it's on the insert it's
[2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:10.840]  what's to Marisol which is even more toxic than mercury is I mean you know
[2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:16.040]  they they change the name it's a hyper form of mercury it's a hyper form of
[2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:21.880]  mercury and the second most toxic element on the charts after you know
[2:29:21.880 --> 2:29:27.840]  plutonium and uranium is mercury and what mercury does is it inhibits the
[2:29:27.840 --> 2:29:34.000]  ability of the synapse to send messages and so when people start getting
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:38.040]  mercury in their system which almost every person does now at different
[2:29:38.040 --> 2:29:43.240]  degrees you start having larger percentage of ADD attention deficit
[2:29:43.240 --> 2:29:47.440]  disorder and obesity stay there we're coming back long second we're to cover

[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:29.200]  people's kids without due process the CPS the taxes the bureaucracy the state
[2:36:29.200 --> 2:36:33.600]  taxes the international taxes California and Oregon passing carbon taxes the
[2:36:33.600 --> 2:36:37.440]  carbon tax I have an article here from prisonplanet.com it has links to
[2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:41.760]  mainstream news the Washington Post US military employees counter insurgency
[2:36:41.760 --> 2:36:45.760]  strategy in California city former special forces colonel says violence
[2:36:45.760 --> 2:36:49.640]  hit town is a laboratory as Washington Post advocates nationwide
[2:36:49.640 --> 2:36:55.600]  implementation of troops on the streets in America this is really happening I
[2:36:55.600 --> 2:37:02.400]  mean this is real bona fide tyranny your take on that well as they say power
[2:37:02.400 --> 2:37:07.920]  tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely and this is just a
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:14.200]  fact of life and as the power elite those who are in separation consciousness
[2:37:14.200 --> 2:37:18.840]  those are in fear consciousness realize that the internet and the consciousness
[2:37:18.840 --> 2:37:22.960]  of the people is increasing more and more and the people like Alex Jones and
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:27.600]  myself and Paul Craig Roberts and the hundreds of thousands of other
[2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:32.120]  patriots around the country who are working for a better freer sovereign
[2:37:32.120 --> 2:37:36.120]  nation and world right now are getting the message out and getting the message
[2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:41.440]  out very effectively these people are freaking out and they the first thing
[2:37:41.440 --> 2:37:45.400]  that they think of is getting a bigger stick trying to knock us down trying to
[2:37:45.400 --> 2:37:51.520]  hit us trying to control us and of course the police departments are the
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:56.280]  main place now most the cops don't know what's going on now when I was a city
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:04.000]  council member we still had a peace officers we had peace officers and we
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:08.360]  had policemen that were there for the people of Austin and as a matter of fact
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:14.000]  it wasn't that long ago that police officers and peace officers wore blue
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:20.480]  and the sheriffs wore brown and now they're all in black I see that Maryland
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:24.600]  is just not Maryland but Massachusetts which is supposed to be the home of the
[2:38:24.600 --> 2:38:28.640]  most liberal people in the and the country now have got all their police
[2:38:28.640 --> 2:38:33.120]  officers and all black and they were in the news a police chief said this is to
[2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:37.520]  intimidate and it's like a praetorian guard and again history tends to repeat
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:42.280]  itself and just like the Caesar when it went from a republic to an empire they
[2:38:42.280 --> 2:38:45.640]  created the praetorian guard and the praetorian guard of course all wore all
[2:38:45.640 --> 2:38:52.160]  black and that is a psychological way to create fear and all of this is a
[2:38:52.160 --> 2:38:59.040]  choice between fear and love between separation and coming together and this
[2:38:59.040 --> 2:39:04.800]  you know as I've said thousands times this is bigger than just an economic or
[2:39:04.800 --> 2:39:09.720]  a political or a cultural war this is a time for each and every one of us to
[2:39:09.720 --> 2:39:14.660]  make a choice it's a time of spiritual choice whether we're gonna live in unity
[2:39:14.660 --> 2:39:20.120]  consciousness and cooperation and be sovereign and free and love our first
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:23.600]  of all love ourselves and our family and our world and the good things that
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:28.000]  that government can bring such as the Constitution or whether we're gonna
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:34.080]  close our eyes and we're going to listen to these rascals and all of their all
[2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:41.360]  of their lives and everything that they're saying to us ABC CBS NBC Time
[2:39:41.360 --> 2:39:48.640]  Newsweek you know every place it's all propaganda to create fear so that George
[2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:52.560]  there's no longer any doubt I mean every if there was a checklist of 30 things
[2:39:52.560 --> 2:39:56.680]  that are tyranny they've double-checked everything then it's now admitted and
[2:39:56.680 --> 2:40:00.360]  this started decades ago but that almost all TV is government paid for and
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:05.240]  they're writing the scripts with all these messages of tyranny it's including
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:11.920]  NPR and for all my good liberal friends I was the worst listen to NPR wake up
[2:40:11.920 --> 2:40:16.960]  it's the worst just because they say it with kind of a sweet
[2:40:16.960 --> 2:40:23.640]  song it's hypnotizing it makes me physically ill to listen to those
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:28.560]  hypocrites physically ill and I'll tell you what look at Obama expanding all
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:34.840]  the wars the the deceptive your first movie on this the Obama deception you
[2:40:34.840 --> 2:40:39.680]  gotta underword the word deception because this guy even though he's the
[2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:44.640]  most incredibly charismatic person who's been on the scene for the last 50
[2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:51.880]  years it's all about deception deception deception every single one of his
[2:40:51.880 --> 2:40:59.520]  promises as you have pointed out again and again and again he's gone 180 degrees
[2:40:59.520 --> 2:41:04.800]  apart and I still see my friends who are oh Obama Obama and so I say well do
[2:41:04.800 --> 2:41:10.440]  you support the war and they and they kind of shake a little bit and and most
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:13.920]  of them run off because they know that there's gonna be an intelligent
[2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:17.880]  discussion because they're cognitive dissidents and remember this term
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:21.880]  cognitive dissidents and it's something that we all have is that we invest or
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:27.880]  time energy or money in a concept is that when we find out that that concept
[2:41:27.880 --> 2:41:32.240]  is not right psychologically we create barriers and fight against that and
[2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:38.920]  that's what's called having an open mind in listening and every single point
[2:41:38.920 --> 2:41:45.360]  that Obama made on on the campaign trail as you have so eloquently pointed out
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:50.120]  and so factually pointed out he's gone a hundred and eighty percent against it
[2:41:50.120 --> 2:41:57.640]  he is so far more of what is classically called a fascist than even George Bush in
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:42:03.760]  in and people say well you're just a Republican in four years ago there's
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:07.040]  they were saying you're just a Democrat you know we're neither Democrat or
[2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:13.640]  Republican we are American citizens who believe in the Constitution this is not
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:18.280]  a question of right or wrong you know right or left it's a question of right
[2:42:18.280 --> 2:42:24.560]  or wrong do we want freedom do we want truth do we want a better America or are
[2:42:24.560 --> 2:42:28.400]  we going to be asleep well the American people have not been taught in the last
[2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:32.680]  30 40 years what tyranny is and so they're told here's freedom but it's
[2:42:32.680 --> 2:42:37.240]  really tyranny and then they tell the public that those of us that are for
[2:42:37.240 --> 2:42:42.080]  freedom that we're the bad ones I mean I've had salon and all six of George
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:46.960]  Soros's big publications and the New Republic and the ADL and CBS and the
[2:42:46.960 --> 2:42:52.200]  Jerusalem Post all in the last day come out and say no longer are they just
[2:42:52.200 --> 2:42:57.040]  ignoring me or making fun of me or just attacking me they're now saying we got to
[2:42:57.040 --> 2:43:00.200]  shut this guy up he's dangerous and the reason they're now saying this is
[2:43:00.200 --> 2:43:04.160]  they're watching our growth curve yeah and the thing but but it's going
[2:43:04.160 --> 2:43:09.560]  straight up and I say to them I am trying to be loving I I know they're
[2:43:09.560 --> 2:43:13.480]  wrong I know they're abusive I know they're hurting my country I know they're
[2:43:13.480 --> 2:43:17.720]  involved in evil and I'm telling them now I'm gonna look at them right now and
[2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:21.080]  tell them you're in the wrong you know you're bad you know you're lying you
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:24.840]  know you're using duplicity you know the New World Order is real I mean the ADL
[2:43:24.840 --> 2:43:29.920]  and CBS wrote articles saying I'm this big liar I say they're setting up a
[2:43:29.920 --> 2:43:34.280]  world government I mean it's all over the news earlier on the show I went over a
[2:43:34.280 --> 2:43:37.640]  bunch of mainstream I mean look at this Financial Times of London this is one of
[2:43:37.640 --> 2:43:41.520]  thousands in the last year yes and now for world government and this article
[2:43:41.520 --> 2:43:45.320]  says we've lied to you for your own good we're taking over it's authoritarian
[2:43:45.320 --> 2:43:49.520]  these are quotes here's another one in here I've got the New York Times
[2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:53.760]  Bankind Moon you coming out and it's calling for world government and world
[2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:59.320]  taxes have but this is what I'm saying George mm-hmm what is the ADL and CBS
[2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:03.680]  doing what what is salon doing when when when they come out and say it's a
[2:44:03.680 --> 2:44:07.520]  conspiracy theory there's no mercury in the shots when the insert says it what
[2:44:07.520 --> 2:44:10.160]  are they doing when they say there's no world government when it's
[2:44:10.160 --> 2:44:13.600]  simultaneously being announced by mainstream media is a good thing it's
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:17.880]  almost like they want to destroy themselves I mean do they understand or
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:21.520]  are they so arrogant and they think it's 20 years ago and people just bought
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:25.800]  whatever they said well it's at homily what they're trying to do is they're
[2:44:25.800 --> 2:44:32.000]  trying to go after you as a person and I've I know you and for people who
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:35.400]  listen to Alex for the first time and we've all gone through our Alex
[2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:41.400]  initiation after ransom raves and he shouts and he raises his voice and so
[2:44:41.400 --> 2:44:46.000]  many people say I can't stand he's just too intense and I just say listen to him
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:50.640]  for a week and kind of get what I want to talk about me but listen what I'm
[2:44:50.640 --> 2:44:56.080]  saying because this is important and Alex not only is about 98% of what he's
[2:44:56.080 --> 2:45:02.960]  saying if not a hundred percent right on accurate that you won't get on CBS or
[2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:08.640]  NBC or whatever which is information you need to know but he also has a heart of
[2:45:08.640 --> 2:45:15.560]  gold is as gruff in his grump busy son oh he's a great guy and what's more
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:20.480]  important is that for all the time I had my television show I would invite
[2:45:20.480 --> 2:45:26.720]  hundreds of city officials newscasters people to come in and not debate but just
[2:45:26.720 --> 2:45:30.520]  have a discussion about this and I know you've done the same thing and you would
[2:45:30.520 --> 2:45:37.240]  invite the top newscasters of CBS NBC of the ADL to come in here and just have a
[2:45:37.240 --> 2:45:42.440]  discussion and and share back and forth but they won't do it they won't come and
[2:45:42.440 --> 2:45:48.320]  have an honest they have to dehumanize you and and so instead of that as human
[2:45:48.320 --> 2:45:54.080]  beings talking about our point of view and they want to separate everybody of
[2:45:54.080 --> 2:45:58.560]  course and it's all about that's why Chris Matthews and the folks on CNN on
[2:45:58.560 --> 2:46:02.920]  Scottish MSNBC they have that talking point that if you say I don't want
[2:46:02.920 --> 2:46:06.760]  socialist health care they go why are you a racist yes obviously it's illogical
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:11.520]  it has nothing to do with that they are invoking racism they are the racist they
[2:46:11.520 --> 2:46:15.720]  are the people using it as a political weapon and and I'm sure that you would
[2:46:15.720 --> 2:46:21.360]  invite Chris or any of these we have we call it say just come on down look
[2:46:21.360 --> 2:46:25.640]  we're just gonna we don't even have to debate you can have your say I'll have
[2:46:25.640 --> 2:46:30.840]  my say no fighting back and forth and let the people decide but you know what
[2:46:30.840 --> 2:46:35.200]  you've been doing this for years and years and years and they won't do it
[2:46:35.200 --> 2:46:40.120]  and because they've got something to hide they've got something to hide and so
[2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:44.280]  folks who are listening the people who are listening to this message right now
[2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:49.840]  you are the power if each and every one of you today can go out and talk to one
[2:46:49.840 --> 2:46:53.920]  person about this and plant some seeds tell them about Gandhi because you know
[2:46:53.920 --> 2:46:57.320]  he has those quotes he went around for 20 years just teaching people they had
[2:46:57.320 --> 2:47:02.160]  power and then suddenly it all imploded yeah and and and I go to India almost
[2:47:02.160 --> 2:47:07.440]  every year and and and I study in India and Mahatma Gandhi is my I've been to his
[2:47:07.440 --> 2:47:12.240]  home I've read him for years and years and years and he was a very very bright
[2:47:12.240 --> 2:47:16.040]  man he went to Oxford he got his law degree he went down South Africa he was
[2:47:16.040 --> 2:47:21.960]  very wealthy down there but when he came back to India there's about 350 million
[2:47:21.960 --> 2:47:27.520]  people living in India in about 300,000 British and the British were in complete
[2:47:27.520 --> 2:47:32.960]  control of the Indian subcontinent which at that time also included the the
[2:47:32.960 --> 2:47:39.360]  nations of Pakistan cashmere and cashmere in the whole area and 300,000
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:45.760]  people were the Sahibs of the whole nation because they had convinced the
[2:47:45.760 --> 2:47:51.240]  intellect not the intellect but the minds of the Indian people that they were
[2:47:51.240 --> 2:47:56.760]  beneath them and that the English were more powerful and in and Gandhi came
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:48:03.360]  back and he realized that this was a fight for the minds in the hearts of the
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:09.480]  Indian people and so he showed through example through love through his
[2:48:09.480 --> 2:48:13.560]  dedication and he would go to village to village and the most important thing
[2:48:13.560 --> 2:48:21.040]  he said is that the seed of God is in the heart of every man woman and child and
[2:48:21.040 --> 2:48:26.640]  that he was there to show through example that we could nurture the seed and
[2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:32.040]  that we were divine sovereign beings whether we were white black Asian and
[2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:36.720]  when he got the Indian people to understand that they had value that
[2:48:36.720 --> 2:48:41.640]  they had intellect that they had rights and his main thing was to get the the
[2:48:41.640 --> 2:48:46.080]  British out still as friends he didn't see them as enemies he saw them as
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:50.840]  opponents about and he realized that they had wrong thinking and he did this
[2:48:50.840 --> 2:48:57.000]  through hard work and through peace and you know what folks we can't beat the
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:00.880]  Illuminati right now with guns we've got to do it with intellect they want to make
[2:49:00.880 --> 2:49:03.920]  it a physical fight yes now at the same time we should defend ourselves of
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:06.440]  course and what and what Gandhi had something to say about that and
[2:49:06.440 --> 2:49:11.400]  absolutely Gandhi Gandhi was no coward Gandhi was Gandhi was a man he let him
[2:49:11.400 --> 2:49:15.040]  beat him up all the time he was a man's man but he would say that it's better
[2:49:15.040 --> 2:49:21.600]  for a person to go to war and fight and die for their country than to then to be
[2:49:21.600 --> 2:49:28.320]  a coward and hide under the the banner of nonviolent civil disobedience well
[2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:30.640]  it's you got to know when to hold them know when to fold them know when to
[2:49:30.640 --> 2:49:33.920]  walk away know when to run you got to know when to play your cards I mean at
[2:49:33.920 --> 2:49:37.320]  points where there's police and they're just peacefully protesting let them beat
[2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:41.600]  them up in front of people because that then shows people but at the same time
[2:49:41.600 --> 2:49:44.720]  if they're rounding up people in villages taking them to FEMA camps you
[2:49:44.720 --> 2:49:48.840]  got to defend yourself absolutely and for example when what was going on in
[2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:52.680]  Russia was happening in the Ukraine when Stalin was going you know just
[2:49:52.680 --> 2:49:58.480]  decimating the Ukraine Gandhi was very clear that it was important for those
[2:49:58.480 --> 2:50:06.600]  people to stand up and fight he was no coward and and we encourage you not to
[2:50:06.600 --> 2:50:11.720]  be cowards to see this thing as clearly crystal clearly as possible these
[2:50:11.720 --> 2:50:17.840]  people care not one eye odor about your freedom or your life and so you need to
[2:50:17.840 --> 2:50:22.200]  protect yourself on all different fronts but but by don't be cowards get
[2:50:22.200 --> 2:50:25.880]  involved you're not going to be able to physically fight if you can't even talk
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:30.120]  to your neighbor about this exactly it's an increments it's in steps yes and it's
[2:50:30.120 --> 2:50:35.800]  the through the first awareness becoming aware of the mass of illusion the
[2:50:35.800 --> 2:50:39.280]  mass of illusion of yeah don't just believe everything we're saying just
[2:50:39.280 --> 2:50:43.480]  realize you're being conned there's more of the world yes and then as you become

[2:54:02.320 --> 2:54:16.160]  I want to go to calls but George we're making a really good point about how
[2:54:16.160 --> 2:54:20.800]  you read the New York Times and it's all this well woven together disinformation
[2:54:20.800 --> 2:54:26.680]  rationales and it's just a continual narrative of deception it's a matrix of
[2:54:26.680 --> 2:54:31.000]  fraud but when you know all the facts then it's completely clear but the average
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:35.080]  person it's all written like it's reasonable but it's a fantasy land it's
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:38.840]  like people with fantasy football I mean they they're acting like they're really
[2:54:38.840 --> 2:54:41.920]  running quarterbacks and on this little power trip it's the same thing they're
[2:54:41.920 --> 2:54:46.360]  all in this little box yeah it's just absolutely amazing because I have been
[2:54:46.360 --> 2:54:51.040]  studying this stuff for a long long time and the other day house reading the
[2:54:51.040 --> 2:54:56.120]  New York Times which is the number one publication and I start reading articles
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:55:01.040]  about cap and trade or the vaccines or whatever it was and I just let myself
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:07.640]  read it like without my my own point of view and I realized how incredibly
[2:55:07.640 --> 2:55:13.520]  seductive and believable their point is because they'll mix a little truth in and
[2:55:13.520 --> 2:55:20.280]  and have a smattering yeah and they do this so well and as you say this is the
[2:55:20.280 --> 2:55:26.280]  matrix and what we're facing is so similar to the movie the matrix the
[2:55:26.280 --> 2:55:33.080]  illusion out there is just deeper deeper deeper than almost any of us can
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:37.880]  understand and we have to understand that to get through this period of time
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:44.960]  and and and what the Mayan calendar calls 2012 or what the what the Rishi's
[2:55:44.960 --> 2:55:49.400]  Nindia call the changing from the Kali Yuga to the Dwarka Yuga this has all
[2:55:49.400 --> 2:55:52.600]  been prophesized for a little while the elite believe there's a big change but
[2:55:52.600 --> 2:55:55.040]  it's not gonna be into the world they believe they're bringing their system
[2:55:55.040 --> 2:55:58.280]  in and then they're actually trying to suppress people waking up because they
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:01.880]  know a big change is coming let's take some calls Matthew in Arizona you're on
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:06.080]  the air with George Humphrey go ahead hey hey Alex you guys are doing great
[2:56:06.080 --> 2:56:10.360]  today but I have some really important to bring up that I never really get you
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:16.000]  know I never really hear on your show and it's students at universities and how
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:21.320]  bad the liberal propaganda has been getting well we do talk about how they
[2:56:21.320 --> 2:56:24.280]  don't let people have free speech in a lot of universities they bully the
[2:56:24.280 --> 2:56:28.720]  students they call it liberal it's not it's it's it's it's really fascism and
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:34.480]  it's it's anti-family it's anti-male they want to destroy the existing order so
[2:56:34.480 --> 2:56:39.160]  that everybody is basically destitute institutionalized and have to lean on
[2:56:39.160 --> 2:56:44.640]  the state George well when I think of liberal I think of Thomas Jefferson I
[2:56:44.640 --> 2:56:50.280]  think of somebody with an open mind who is inquisitive who is there who wants to
[2:56:50.280 --> 2:56:54.800]  play by the rules who has an open heart to call these son of a guns liberal and
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:59.280]  and and and we all have these friends who are liberal Democrats see that's the
[2:56:59.280 --> 2:57:02.880]  matrix they think they're Thomas Jefferson the average liberal when
[2:57:02.880 --> 2:57:06.840]  really they're working for eugenics death cult and in in the amazing not the
[2:57:06.840 --> 2:57:13.000]  amazing in the reality is is that about 99% of the liberal Democrats in this
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:18.200]  country believe that they're doing the right thing they think they're doing
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:22.600]  the right thing they read the New York Times they watch CNN they they've
[2:57:22.600 --> 2:57:28.320]  swallowed this lie hook line and they know their liberal paradigm is it
[2:57:28.320 --> 2:57:31.160]  perfect but it's better than that Republican paradigm yeah which is only
[2:57:31.160 --> 2:57:34.920]  another wing on the same bird thank you Matthew Don and Toronto you're on the
[2:57:34.920 --> 2:57:42.120]  air go ahead Don yes hi Alex George I'm calling from Canada where the H1N1
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:47.280]  massive vaccine campaign is in full throttle right now and there have been
[2:57:47.280 --> 2:57:52.040]  reports of one person dying of complications apparently there's a bunch
[2:57:52.040 --> 2:57:56.760]  of reports of deaths all over the world China France England and they're really
[2:57:56.760 --> 2:58:02.760]  covering most of them up and I just wanted to ask George you know it is you
[2:58:02.760 --> 2:58:09.000]  seem you seem to see more police presence in in Mexico the the army is
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:14.400]  everywhere but due to the fight against the against the drug cart the fight
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:19.200]  against drug dealers in our hangers the George C increased militarization in
[2:58:19.200 --> 2:58:24.600]  North America there's no question about it's already happening yeah we were

[3:00:55.880 --> 3:00:59.240]  guarantee are getting in trouble for this doctors are all over the world saying
[3:00:59.240 --> 3:01:02.560]  don't take it and they still call us conspiracy theorists that isn't going to
[3:01:02.560 --> 3:01:07.040]  hold water you know and the amazing thing is if you look back at the quote
[3:01:07.040 --> 3:01:15.440]  swine flu it is not possible for an avian flu to coexist with the mammal
[3:01:15.440 --> 3:01:21.360]  flu and it just doesn't happen in nature and this is clearly a manmade
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:27.600]  genetically modified flu and now that they're finding strains the 1918 flu
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:32.120]  influenza that they went up a couple years ago they went up to Spitsburg
[3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:36.400]  which is some islands north of Iceland they're controlled by Norway where they
[3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:42.720]  bury these people and got strains of the flu from people who died up there and
[3:01:42.720 --> 3:01:45.600]  it suddenly and I remember eight years ago when they did that it was in the
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:48.880]  news that we said look out they're going to bring it back and then now this dead
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:53.040]  flu is resurrected you know and I think it's going to be really interesting I
[3:01:53.040 --> 3:01:56.560]  don't know what's happening in the Ukraine today but about five or six days
[3:01:56.560 --> 3:02:00.400]  ago they got a very virulent flu in the Ukraine well their government is even
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:04.720]  admitting that they believe that all the different flu vaccines have mutated to
[3:02:04.720 --> 3:02:09.400]  form this yeah and so we've got to keep our eye on it and but the most important
[3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:15.400]  thing is don't trust the vaccines they don't help they'll make you sick there's
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:18.960]  people here right here in Austin Texas they who've taken it and who have been
[3:02:18.960 --> 3:02:25.000]  become paralyzed I know a whole bunch of people yeah absolutely and so the best
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:32.080]  way to protect yourself is to be healthy to eat good clean organic raw food and
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:38.120]  a lot of sunshine a lot of sunshine get that vitamin D and eat good clean
[3:02:38.120 --> 3:02:43.120]  organic fruits in that let's take one more or two more calls Matt in the UK
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:48.160]  you're on the air go ahead hi Alex and hi George good afternoon and by the way
[3:02:48.160 --> 3:02:52.960]  Alex you are growing very rapidly in the UK by the way so we had a pie mate
[3:02:52.960 --> 3:02:57.000]  but see I mean I mean I mean here's the problem I have you make your point but
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:03:01.640]  on the whole ADL subject I want to get bigger to reach more people but I'm
[3:03:01.640 --> 3:03:05.120]  almost like steaming towards my destruction but I morally have to do it
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:09.960]  it's not like ooh I'm getting big I'm a celebrity now around the world you know
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:14.360]  I mean bigger and bigger media now when they talk about conspiracies just uses
[3:03:14.360 --> 3:03:18.960]  my name Alex Jones it's like a meme I want to be honest I don't like it but
[3:03:18.960 --> 3:03:24.160]  but thank you go ahead yeah thank you Alex yeah I have a banking question
[3:03:24.160 --> 3:03:27.800]  basically mentioned about the US banking system I'm gonna tell you about the UK
[3:03:27.800 --> 3:03:31.840]  bank system at the moment and there's millions and millions of people trying
[3:03:31.840 --> 3:03:36.360]  to get back their bank charges and based on the bank site even budging and shops
[3:03:36.360 --> 3:03:39.320]  are closing every day in the UK but the government keeps saying that growth is
[3:03:39.320 --> 3:03:42.960]  here what do you guys reckon to that one
[3:03:42.960 --> 3:03:49.680]  George what's your take on the the economy deteriorating people losing
[3:03:49.680 --> 3:03:53.520]  their jobs but the media is saying we've got a great economy well it is very
[3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:58.240]  clear is that in the last five years consumer spending has represented 67 to
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:04.400]  71% of the whole gross domestic national product now and that was when the
[3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:09.400]  unemployment rate was about four and a half percent and the economy was was
[3:04:09.400 --> 3:04:13.840]  basically humming along today the unemployment the official rates are
[3:04:13.840 --> 3:04:18.680]  10.25 percent unemployment the real number is somewhere between 14 and a
[3:04:18.680 --> 3:04:24.520]  half to 17 percent unemployment those are the real numbers and the people who
[3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:29.240]  are not fully employed the amount of debt is not getting better it's getting
[3:04:29.240 --> 3:04:35.800]  worse and worse and worse we have a huge number of commercial banking mortgage
[3:04:35.800 --> 3:04:41.480]  bundles that will be coming up the second round of residential bundles are
[3:04:41.480 --> 3:04:45.160]  coming up which is what set this thing off and the first George we're out of
[3:04:45.160 --> 3:04:48.400]  time we got Catherine Austin Fitz on the line coming up first time she's gonna
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:52.560]  be almost very excited about that and I'm sorry to Matt and others holding you
[3:04:52.560 --> 3:04:55.480]  only get about 30 seconds on air we just ran out of time but thank you so much
[3:04:55.480 --> 3:04:58.920]  Matt keep spreading the word God bless you just kind of freaking me out though
[3:04:58.920 --> 3:05:05.600]  to realize that hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[3:05:05.600 --> 3:05:10.360]  alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off
[3:05:10.360 --> 3:05:14.400]  this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[3:05:14.400 --> 3:05:19.560]  have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[3:05:19.560 --> 3:05:24.360]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[3:05:24.360 --> 3:05:28.720]  citizens to pay attention fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our
[3:05:28.720 --> 3:05:33.960]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[3:05:38.240 --> 3:05:41.760]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[3:05:41.760 --> 3:05:47.000]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[3:08:27.400 --> 3:08:32.880]  years ago or so she was on the show but for all intents and purposes it's not
[3:08:32.880 --> 3:08:38.680]  her first rodeo but this is a maiden voyage in the last eight years so it is
[3:08:38.680 --> 3:08:42.880]  good good to have her with us but I guess if your memories wiped you don't

[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:43.120]  the elites are doing her take on Obama and it's great to have Katherine Austin
[3:09:43.120 --> 3:09:47.280]  Fitz on with us today Katherine. Alex it's always a pleasure as you know I'm a
[3:09:47.280 --> 3:09:52.800]  huge fan of you and info wars. Well I guess I'd forgotten that fact but
[3:09:52.800 --> 3:09:56.000]  but it's I've been emailing you for a while but maybe emailing the wrong
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:10:00.440]  email trying to get you on and I was I was crestfallen but I'm a big fan of
[3:10:00.440 --> 3:10:04.120]  you you got the floor break down what you think is most important but first
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:07.880]  tell us about yourself. Well I came out of the Bush administration thinking oh my
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:12.160]  word the fascists are gonna kill us all we need to do something and I started an
[3:10:12.160 --> 3:10:17.680]  investment bank in Washington and our goal was to help communities finance
[3:10:17.680 --> 3:10:21.360]  with equity because rather than shipping all of our money to Wall Street and then
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:25.040]  hoping a little bit trickles back or shipping it all to Washington and
[3:10:25.040 --> 3:10:29.480]  hoping a little trickles back my theory was how bad if we you know if we
[3:10:29.480 --> 3:10:33.720]  financed our own businesses and did much more locally so I started an
[3:10:33.720 --> 3:10:37.720]  investment bank one of the things we did was we were hired on competitive bid
[3:10:37.720 --> 3:10:41.960]  to be financial advisor to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
[3:10:41.960 --> 3:10:48.680]  Development where I'd worked as an assistant secretary and and I we we did
[3:10:48.680 --> 3:10:52.560]  loan sales Alex and they were unbelievably successful during the
[3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:57.880]  Clinton administration and but the corruption got worse and worse now you
[3:10:57.880 --> 3:11:00.360]  know it was terrible in the Bush administration just kept getting worse
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:05.960]  in the Clinton administration and we were a decision was made I was part of a
[3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:11.280]  group of people who who were saying oh my goodness with GATT and NAFTA we're
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:15.600]  gonna we're gonna ship all the jobs abroad and we need to do something or
[3:11:15.600 --> 3:11:18.600]  else the American people are gonna be left high and dry we're gonna lose you
[3:11:18.600 --> 3:11:22.040]  know the middle class will be wiped out how are we gonna how are we gonna
[3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:26.920]  develop new skills how are we gonna help people create new jobs and support
[3:11:26.920 --> 3:11:30.560]  small business so we're part of a group that we're doing working on all of that
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:35.760]  and literally a decision was made rather than address the real problems and help
[3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:39.520]  the American people jump the curve on the situation that instead we would
[3:11:39.520 --> 3:11:43.880]  bubble the economy and pull massive amounts of capital and reinvest them
[3:11:43.880 --> 3:11:48.720]  abroad and so this was a conscious decision and you were there on the
[3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:53.080]  inside witnessing this and and I'll tell you the greatest one of the best
[3:11:53.080 --> 3:11:57.520]  videos I've ever seen you can get it up on my blog at salieri.com
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:04.000]  flash blog is Sir James Goldsmith did a speaking tour trying to stop the GATT
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:08.360]  from being passed in the World Trade Organization to be adopted and basically
[3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:12.160]  said this is the most frightening terrifying thing we're gonna have three
[3:12:12.160 --> 3:12:16.640]  billion people moved off the land we're you know massive unemployment worldwide
[3:12:16.640 --> 3:12:20.680]  we're gonna destroy we're gonna have massive structural unemployment in the
[3:12:20.680 --> 3:12:26.920]  United States he gave this interview it's up on YouTube to Charlie Rose in
[3:12:26.920 --> 3:12:32.520]  1995 and he predicts everything that's happening now now remember this man's a
[3:12:32.520 --> 3:12:36.920]  billionaire very successful businessman and basically said look this is the
[3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:41.000]  establishment against everybody else and he said this is going to be the most
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  devastating horrible thing that has ever happened to the world it's absolutely
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:50.240]  crazy and he lays it all out and and what you know and so I can say the same
[3:12:50.240 --> 3:12:55.400]  thing we were on the inside we're working with the administration and we
[3:12:55.400 --> 3:12:59.120]  knew that that we were going to create massive unemployment now here's the big
[3:12:59.120 --> 3:13:04.160]  secret of the work that I did when I was in Washington during the period we
[3:13:04.160 --> 3:13:08.280]  created something Alex called community wizard which was a software tool that
[3:13:08.280 --> 3:13:11.800]  would allow us to look at the sources and uses of government money by place
[3:13:11.800 --> 3:13:16.400]  because America is just 3100 counties and when you look at government
[3:13:16.400 --> 3:13:23.000]  investment by place what you discover is that that a great deal of money is
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:27.960]  being spent to centralize economic and political power and to basically
[3:13:27.960 --> 3:13:31.720]  subsidize large corporations and all sorts of unproductive behavior whether
[3:13:31.720 --> 3:13:37.560]  it's you know people on welfare all the way up to corporations on welfare but
[3:13:37.560 --> 3:13:42.640]  let me give you a couple examples we would regularly find places where where
[3:13:42.640 --> 3:13:46.200]  HUD was spending this is HUD the Department of Housing and Urban
[3:13:46.200 --> 3:13:52.680]  Development was spending $250,000 to construct or rehab an apartment building
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:13:59.040]  when $50,000 would buy and rehab of four closed single-family property so so we
[3:13:59.040 --> 3:14:04.800]  were spending four or five times what we needed to to get one and I went to the
[3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:09.120]  assistant to the person who ran that program in 1996 and said look you know
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:12.960]  we could get five homes for the price of one and they looked at me turned bright
[3:14:12.960 --> 3:14:21.200]  red and said but how would we generate fees for our friends now imagine if you
[3:14:21.200 --> 3:14:27.800]  will imagine how many how many more people would have homes today if we
[3:14:27.800 --> 3:14:31.840]  weren't doing things like that it was just a giant honeypot and the media loves
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:36.320]  to always blame poor people who were told oh it's the new America it's the way
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:43.480]  to build wealth build equity go out from the banks down to the assessors we you
[3:14:43.480 --> 3:14:47.200]  know we're all gonna basically cheat on the forms the media advertised it was
[3:14:47.200 --> 3:14:52.040]  okay to do and then the media now tries to blame the poor people they got set up
[3:14:52.040 --> 3:14:57.520]  and ripped off and given these arms and and and these balloon mortgages that's
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:02.920]  like my analogy Catherine Austin Fitz is like blaming a six-year-old that doesn't
[3:15:02.920 --> 3:15:07.160]  mind their parents gets out of the backyard goes in the front yard and a
[3:15:07.160 --> 3:15:12.040]  man has a puppy and candy in a in a in a van and they get in the car and get
[3:15:12.040 --> 3:15:16.320]  taken away and raped and killed you don't blame the five-year-old you blame the
[3:15:16.320 --> 3:15:20.600]  banks you blame the killer you blame the people that set this in motion well
[3:15:20.600 --> 3:15:24.800]  in fact it's called under the law it's called fraudulent inducement if I
[3:15:24.800 --> 3:15:31.760]  encourage you to to if I'm a lender and I encourage you to take on alone and I
[3:15:31.760 --> 3:15:36.640]  know something about your future financial condition that you don't then
[3:15:36.640 --> 3:15:41.080]  that is fraudulent inducement and you may not be obligated to pay me back for
[3:15:41.080 --> 3:15:47.720]  all or a portion so in fact what happened was if you look at the big you
[3:15:47.720 --> 3:15:50.880]  know the largest banks and largest people leading the mortgage business
[3:15:50.880 --> 3:15:56.520]  everything that I knew then they knew I mean this was all known in Washington
[3:15:56.520 --> 3:16:00.560]  that the jobs were going to go abroad and incomes were generally going to fall
[3:16:00.560 --> 3:16:04.880]  and so what they were doing was they were encouraging people to take out
[3:16:04.880 --> 3:16:09.400]  loans many of whom thought they could pay back and didn't know that their income
[3:16:09.400 --> 3:16:12.760]  was going to be falling let's jump forward then we'll go back but let's
[3:16:12.760 --> 3:16:17.160]  jump forward Greg Gordon's four-part series now in the clatchy newspapers he
[3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:20.640]  got the internal documents of what you've already publicly stated and others
[3:16:20.640 --> 3:16:25.840]  have stated right that the the the pilots that pilot the private fellow
[3:16:25.840 --> 3:16:31.800]  reserve and all the major regulatory positions Goldman Sachs were telling
[3:16:31.800 --> 3:16:38.440]  everybody to invest in housing selling these securities while at the same time
[3:16:38.440 --> 3:16:43.120]  betting against them to destroy their competitors and vertically integrate
[3:16:43.120 --> 3:16:47.680]  the market to them making everybody destitute or a lower standard of living
[3:16:47.680 --> 3:16:51.880]  that's great vertical integration that's like a mosquito jamming their
[3:16:51.880 --> 3:16:56.720]  proboscis into your arm pumping and enzymes to liquidate the cells so they
[3:16:56.720 --> 3:17:01.360]  can slurp them up I mean this is just a parasite remember these firms no longer
[3:17:01.360 --> 3:17:05.760]  see themselves as serving clients they see themselves as training for their own
[3:17:05.760 --> 3:17:09.960]  account and being part of syndicates which includes the US government which
[3:17:09.960 --> 3:17:15.040]  engage in economic warfare and and when they engage in economic warfare and when
[3:17:15.040 --> 3:17:18.720]  they trade for their own account they're using the federal credit to do it and
[3:17:18.720 --> 3:17:25.280]  and so you know if if they lose money we print paper and dig them out and and if
[3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:29.400]  they don't lose money they get to keep it it's sort of when you win and lose you
[3:17:29.400 --> 3:17:34.520]  win so what's the end game and I want to go back over the history of this and
[3:17:34.520 --> 3:17:37.800]  and more where we're going and I want you to lead the discussion throughout the
[3:17:37.800 --> 3:17:42.080]  rest of the hour Catherine Austin Feds but I mean specifically then you're
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:48.360]  agreeing that it's premeditated and predatory what's the end game well what
[3:17:48.360 --> 3:17:54.000]  we're watching and it started tonight the latest phase started in 1995 with the
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:57.480]  institution of the World Trade Organization what we're watching is a
[3:17:57.480 --> 3:18:02.320]  fundamental re-engineering of how resources and planet Earth are
[3:18:02.320 --> 3:18:09.560]  governed so we're moving from a model where places are governed by government
[3:18:09.560 --> 3:18:15.160]  by sovereign government to to a world where resources are managed by
[3:18:15.160 --> 3:18:20.520]  multinational corporations under the auspices of the world government that
[3:18:20.520 --> 3:18:25.200]  that is it you know operates very much through the financial system in the
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:29.960]  central banking system and if you look at the the economic model that is using
[3:18:29.960 --> 3:18:35.320]  it's not really a new model it's called central banking warfare so the central
[3:18:35.320 --> 3:18:40.360]  banks print money and the military makes sure that people take it what's
[3:18:40.360 --> 3:18:47.400]  important to understand now which is not common in in any analysis of the
[3:18:47.400 --> 3:18:53.080]  economy is that the United States and its allies have created a global taxation
[3:18:53.080 --> 3:18:59.240]  system and the way it works Alex is we print paper whether it's dollar bills
[3:18:59.240 --> 3:19:03.680]  or treasuries and then other governments around the world or central banks
[3:19:03.680 --> 3:19:08.160]  around the world by that paper and the paper goes down in value so it's a
[3:19:08.160 --> 3:19:12.920]  taxation system through the balance sheet no legislature you know every
[3:19:12.920 --> 3:19:15.400]  country in the world hasn't passed the law saying okay we're going to pay a
[3:19:15.400 --> 3:19:19.800]  5% tithe to the United States Empire every year but in fact that's what's
[3:19:19.800 --> 3:19:24.480]  happening through the currency system and now by the devaluation the tax is
[3:19:24.480 --> 3:19:29.200]  increasing right the tax is increasing and what we're watching just in the
[3:19:29.200 --> 3:19:33.560]  last two weeks with various people around the world squawking is they're
[3:19:33.560 --> 3:19:38.320]  squawking because the subsidy that needs to be extracted every year is greater
[3:19:38.320 --> 3:19:42.640]  and greater and the pain of the taxation as the economy slows down is greater
[3:19:42.640 --> 3:19:46.520]  and greater unbelievable continue breaking down this global government
[3:19:46.520 --> 3:19:50.080]  architecture when you were talking about this 10 years ago the media would
[3:19:50.080 --> 3:19:53.400]  still poo poo it now they're admitting world government is here but
[3:19:53.400 --> 3:19:57.000]  simultaneously if you then say oh I don't want to be part of it they say
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:20:01.760]  this person's insane it doesn't exist I want to get your take on that amazing
[3:20:01.760 --> 3:20:07.000]  Catherine this is big John Lipscomb world government and all its tyranny is

[3:24:46.440 --> 3:24:51.000]  now this is a short segment long segment coming up Catherine I'm gonna try to
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:54.440]  just sit back and let you roll now because I want to hear what you think's
[3:24:54.440 --> 3:24:57.080]  most important and where all this is going and how we protect ourselves but
[3:24:57.080 --> 3:25:00.800]  just to realize that open world governments being established a
[3:25:00.800 --> 3:25:05.040]  financial predatory dictatorship that wants us poor and easily controlled
[3:25:05.040 --> 3:25:11.080]  openly being stated a fake green tyranny all of this is being set up and
[3:25:11.080 --> 3:25:14.360]  we're not even having a national debate about it they're just announcing with
[3:25:14.360 --> 3:25:20.320]  one hand world government is here and it's good and and then with the other
[3:25:20.320 --> 3:25:23.960]  hand saying if you talk about it you're a dangerous cook it doesn't exist can you
[3:25:23.960 --> 3:25:29.960]  talk about that well I you know I don't I don't know anybody who says you're a
[3:25:29.960 --> 3:25:34.520]  cook if you talk about that I mean I I never get called a cook no no I know
[3:25:34.520 --> 3:25:38.440]  you don't get called a cook by the public because ban Kai moons in the New
[3:25:38.440 --> 3:25:41.840]  York Times calling for global governance but the only I mean well here's an
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:48.960]  example since you said it I had CBS News Jerusalem Post ADL Salon yesterday all
[3:25:48.960 --> 3:25:54.040]  attacked me and say I'm insane none of it exists well you know here planet
[3:25:54.040 --> 3:25:58.280]  earth divides up into what I call the procentralization team and and the
[3:25:58.280 --> 3:26:02.160]  pro decentralization team and if you look at how the money works Alex the
[3:26:02.160 --> 3:26:07.480]  economy has been steadily centralizing more and more money and so more and more
[3:26:07.480 --> 3:26:11.600]  people are on the dole they're on the payroll of the procentralization team
[3:26:11.600 --> 3:26:17.240]  so you know when somebody is making money on something attacks me for for you
[3:26:17.240 --> 3:26:21.560]  know in whatever way I mean in Washington we used to just call them the
[3:26:21.560 --> 3:26:27.080]  attack poodles so when the attack poodles you tell you you're crazy that's what
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:31.480]  they're paid to do you know it's a game it's not real so and they know they're
[3:26:31.480 --> 3:26:35.760]  lying yeah they know that what one of the things is so amazing to me as you see
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:39.840]  more and more of people just you know they can't keep a straight face even
[3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:42.600]  there when they're saying and I was watching the clip this morning of the
[3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:46.640]  attorney general announcing the financial fraud task force I mean talk about
[3:26:46.640 --> 3:26:54.240]  projection so so you know when he literally it looked to me like it couldn't
[3:26:54.240 --> 3:26:59.160]  keep a straight face so you know these guys know it but it you know it you know
[3:26:59.160 --> 3:27:03.480]  it's a game and the rest of us are on the pro decentralization team and part
[3:27:03.480 --> 3:27:08.000]  of the challenge is we do we have not yet created a vision of where the
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:12.240]  alternative is and let me let me talk about one of the places that were stuck
[3:27:12.240 --> 3:27:17.680]  because this is so so important have I ever you probably don't know my very
[3:27:17.680 --> 3:27:23.600]  famous red button story I was giving a speech to a group of people called
[3:27:23.600 --> 3:27:27.440]  spiritual frontiers Foundation International and they have a conference
[3:27:27.440 --> 3:27:31.200]  once a year Alex where they go and sit in the woods for a couple days and talk
[3:27:31.200 --> 3:27:35.200]  about how they can help our society of all spiritually so a friend of mine had
[3:27:35.200 --> 3:27:38.320]  asked me to give them a speech called how the money works an organized crime
[3:27:38.320 --> 3:27:42.640]  and it later became a very famous article called narco dollars for beginners
[3:27:42.640 --> 3:27:46.440]  and it's designed yes I've read it right it's designed to explain the
[3:27:46.440 --> 3:27:50.640]  intersection of narcotics trafficking organized crime and government and big
[3:27:50.640 --> 3:27:55.720]  corporations anyway so through wall street in Washington does drug money so
[3:27:55.720 --> 3:28:00.960]  so I'm in the middle of the speech and I'm explaining the fact we're talking
[3:28:00.960 --> 3:28:06.720]  about the the dark alliance allegations and the two hearings that Congress had
[3:28:06.720 --> 3:28:12.840]  on CIA drug dealing in South Central LA and I mentioned at the time a reporter
[3:28:12.840 --> 3:28:15.800]  that I was helping was told by the Department of Justice that the US
[3:28:15.800 --> 3:28:20.720]  economy wanders 500 billion to a trillion dollars a year of 500 billion to a
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:25.800]  train of all dirty money so that's narcotics trafficking you know illegal
[3:28:25.800 --> 3:28:32.520]  gambling tax evasion everything so so I said to this wonderful group of a hundred
[3:28:32.520 --> 3:28:38.400]  spiritually evolved committed people what would happen if we stop being the
[3:28:38.400 --> 3:28:41.760]  global leader in money laundering and they said well you know the money would
[3:28:41.760 --> 3:28:45.080]  go to other stock exchanges so the New York Stock Exchange would go down and
[3:28:45.080 --> 3:28:48.560]  our mutual funds that go down and we'd have trouble rolling over the government
[3:28:48.560 --> 3:28:52.680]  deficit so we'd have you know our our taxes might go up and our government
[3:28:52.680 --> 3:28:55.920]  checks might stop and I said okay let's pretend there's a big red button up here
[3:28:55.920 --> 3:29:00.920]  on the lectern and if you push that button you can stop all hard narcotics
[3:29:00.920 --> 3:29:06.560]  trafficking in your county your state your country tomorrow thus offending the
[3:29:06.560 --> 3:29:10.640]  people who control 500 billion to a train dollars a year who here will push
[3:29:10.640 --> 3:29:15.360]  the button and this was the summer 2000 out of a hundred people dedicated to
[3:29:15.360 --> 3:29:20.440]  evolving our society spiritually guess how many would push the button how many
[3:29:20.440 --> 3:29:25.480]  one one would push the button the other 99 would not I said why would you not
[3:29:25.480 --> 3:29:29.040]  push the button they said we don't want our government checks to stop and we
[3:29:29.040 --> 3:29:32.880]  don't want our mutual funds to go down and that's the trap that's how evil gets
[3:29:32.880 --> 3:29:37.280]  you dependent on them and the police all know the government brings in most the
[3:29:37.280 --> 3:29:42.200]  drugs but they just they have to keep buying the delusion of busting kids and
[3:29:42.200 --> 3:29:45.800]  putting them in prison if you decriminalize the drugs the money would

[3:33:53.800 --> 3:33:58.600]  far along is this new form of world government describe some of that world
[3:33:58.600 --> 3:34:01.040]  government to us and then get into whatever subjects you want to cover
[3:34:01.040 --> 3:34:04.720]  solutions how you think people can individually protect themselves
[3:34:04.720 --> 3:34:09.080]  strategies for states and counties okay well let me let me jump back for a
[3:34:09.080 --> 3:34:14.560]  second yeah the red one history of the what I call the black budget because
[3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:17.360]  you really need to understand the history of this people don't understand
[3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:23.200]  how could have gotten so bad and may not notice what happened Alex was in 1947
[3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:29.600]  in 1949 we passed the national security act in the CIA act and those two acts
[3:34:29.600 --> 3:34:34.040]  in combination allowed money to be clawed out of the federal government and
[3:34:34.040 --> 3:34:38.600]  federal budget and spent in non-transparent ways so we we created a
[3:34:38.600 --> 3:34:42.720]  secret way of funding very big projects through through the governmental
[3:34:42.720 --> 3:34:47.520]  mechanism now remember they can borrow as much money as they want and then
[3:34:47.520 --> 3:34:51.040]  something else happened because if you if you go back and you look at the history
[3:34:51.040 --> 3:34:54.520]  of financial fraud and the kind of corruption we're looking at and you
[3:34:54.520 --> 3:34:58.840]  you interview or you research and you read the people sort of dealing with it
[3:34:58.840 --> 3:35:03.120]  it all comes back to a point after World War two where literally the
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:08.160]  government lost control of the technology we had the most powerful
[3:35:08.160 --> 3:35:12.720]  secretive black technology in the world including some that we brought over from
[3:35:12.720 --> 3:35:17.080]  the Nazis and literally we've created this funding mechanism that paid
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:22.200]  corporations to control and manage technology and a lot of what we're
[3:35:22.200 --> 3:35:27.520]  dealing with goes back to the fact that we've had since then 50 to 60 years of
[3:35:27.520 --> 3:35:33.600]  incredible non-transparent governmental flows going into basically corporate
[3:35:33.600 --> 3:35:39.360]  controlled technology that many of us don't understand and and when you say
[3:35:39.360 --> 3:35:43.760]  well how can how can the military force countries all around the world to take
[3:35:43.760 --> 3:35:49.560]  paper that keeps going down in value it all comes back as you probably know to
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:53.840]  a lot of the invisible weaponry the satellite systems and all this
[3:35:53.840 --> 3:36:00.960]  incredible technology that we don't understand and know about I mean they
[3:36:00.960 --> 3:36:05.480]  bragged that they're really 30 years advanced and they've got satellites where
[3:36:05.480 --> 3:36:11.200]  they can radiate somebody from space I mean we have a highly advanced
[3:36:11.200 --> 3:36:15.680]  technocracy that has walled itself off in military reservations private
[3:36:15.680 --> 3:36:21.040]  corporate reservations as you know is heading up a big company that developed
[3:36:21.040 --> 3:36:25.480]  a lot of financial software systems and they've rolled out the internet systems
[3:36:25.480 --> 3:36:29.920]  the banking systems the cashless systems that have now just been adopted it's
[3:36:29.920 --> 3:36:34.800]  like poisoning the well poisoning the waterhole and the deer come to it and
[3:36:34.800 --> 3:36:38.160]  drink and then go off and die and don't even know what killed them right it's
[3:36:38.160 --> 3:36:42.080]  just like all the technology to track and control us is built into the iPhone
[3:36:42.080 --> 3:36:47.040]  of the cell phone we just accept it and we're now basically like savages in
[3:36:47.040 --> 3:36:51.600]  this 21st century Buck Rogers system not even knowing what we're part of in the
[3:36:51.600 --> 3:36:57.480]  elite as Bill Joy wrote in the April issue in 2000 in Wired magazine the
[3:36:57.480 --> 3:37:01.920]  elite don't need us anymore why the future doesn't need us well it's worth
[3:37:01.920 --> 3:37:06.440]  and then not only do they not need us but we've become very expensive I mean
[3:37:06.440 --> 3:37:11.000]  let's let's just look at the numbers in the United States the United States if
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:15.840]  you look at that at the national debt before the bank bailouts each American
[3:37:15.840 --> 3:37:19.960]  had about thirty eight thousand dollars of national debt if you count up the
[3:37:19.960 --> 3:37:25.920]  Social Security Medicare and Medicaid and other contingent liabilities and you
[3:37:25.920 --> 3:37:29.320]  say what's the present value of those contingent liabilities it's about a
[3:37:29.320 --> 3:37:33.480]  hundred and thirty eight thousand dollars so more than say four times the
[3:37:33.480 --> 3:37:38.560]  current national debt and so we've literally in in one sense the baby
[3:37:38.560 --> 3:37:43.920]  boomers have reached a point where we're worth more dead than alive just
[3:37:43.920 --> 3:37:49.200]  looking at the numbers so if they succeed with this technological
[3:37:49.200 --> 3:37:55.280]  extermination grid that the White House science art talks about if you if all
[3:37:55.280 --> 3:37:59.800]  the population manipulation reduction we've seen was just testing what is the
[3:37:59.800 --> 3:38:04.680]  end game I mean if they are able to carry this out how do you see it unfold
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:08.920]  I frankly I don't think they're gonna be able to carry it out I mean I'm not
[3:38:08.920 --> 3:38:15.120]  saying they're not gonna try but it's a it's a very big planet what all of us
[3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:21.520]  need to understand is in a world where let's just take as an assumption that we
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:27.840]  can be irradiated by a satellite by a visible weaponry from space how do you
[3:38:27.840 --> 3:38:34.200]  how do you push back against something that is that ubiquitous both in terms of
[3:38:34.200 --> 3:38:38.440]  ability to force ability to manipulate whether it's through the media your iPhone
[3:38:38.440 --> 3:38:44.400]  or whatever how do you do it and and if you look back through history what you
[3:38:44.400 --> 3:38:49.520]  will see is is where you know John Adams said the revolution was not the war the
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:53.840]  revolution was in the hearts and the minds of the people and and Alex we're
[3:38:53.840 --> 3:39:01.240]  talking about a point of view and a way of being which is unbelievably black and
[3:39:01.240 --> 3:39:06.200]  if there's one thing I know about people people are fundamentally healthy and
[3:39:06.200 --> 3:39:11.160]  people are fundamentally grounded and they they just do not go along with this
[3:39:11.160 --> 3:39:16.560]  kind of blackness now it can do incredible harm on the way but but you're
[3:39:16.560 --> 3:39:20.520]  talking about ultimately a government that doesn't have what I call them the
[3:39:20.520 --> 3:39:25.200]  Chinese call the mandate of heaven you know it it's something that's based on
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:34.520]  on a culture which is too perverted too unhealthy and too lacking in in in the
[3:39:34.520 --> 3:39:43.080]  kind of open transparency and you know it sits in its own bell jar so you're
[3:39:43.080 --> 3:39:46.200]  saying there's going to be a revolution even within the control system and the
[3:39:46.200 --> 3:39:51.000]  elite not having the stomach to carry all this out the problem is and in
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:54.760]  correct me if I'm wrong if that's not what you mean by that or this revolution
[3:39:54.760 --> 3:39:58.920]  in the mind and I agree with you that's happening as members of the mid-level
[3:39:58.920 --> 3:40:03.840]  establishment really figure out my god this really is a giant extermination
[3:40:03.840 --> 3:40:10.560]  system then we see them racing to go to full robotic aircraft full robotic
[3:40:10.560 --> 3:40:17.680]  tanks full remote control systems where you have robotic factories that
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:22.600]  manufacture and that engage in the upkeep of the systems and then it's all
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:27.200]  deployed basically a Terminator Skynet system is what they're building but it's
[3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:32.480]  controlled by humans right but you can't you cannot run a large operation or
[3:40:32.480 --> 3:40:38.160]  enterprise let alone a world government on force it has to have some kind of
[3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:43.800]  moral authority it has to have some kind of vision and values that inspire its
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:47.680]  members to be loyal force is not enough and so that's why they staged terror
[3:40:47.680 --> 3:40:55.640]  attacks in the elite play the part of the victim you know it depends on which
[3:40:55.640 --> 3:41:01.160]  one because remember that the elites are fighting what you've got is you've got a
[3:41:01.160 --> 3:41:05.640]  situation where we're because the elite is a pretty big group but many of these
[3:41:05.640 --> 3:41:09.920]  people are prisoners of the system in other words they're part of what I
[3:41:09.920 --> 3:41:14.360]  call the central banking warfare model and that model Alex the important thing
[3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:18.520]  to understand about that model is to date it's worked yeah I'll give you an
[3:41:18.520 --> 3:41:23.560]  example in the summer of 2000 that was a busy summer I was at a revival for
[3:41:23.560 --> 3:41:31.520]  Christian women in in Atlanta TDJ from Dallas your state had had rented the
[3:41:31.520 --> 3:41:35.440]  Georgia Dome and had women aren't loosed and I was sitting there with a hundred
[3:41:35.440 --> 3:41:40.200]  thousand African-American women and I was taking a spiritual warfare course with
[3:41:40.200 --> 3:41:45.800]  a pastor and I was there with the church and this particular pastor had worked at
[3:41:45.800 --> 3:41:54.680]  DEA and TDJs brought George W. Bush in by monitor and the whole crowd jumped up
[3:41:54.680 --> 3:42:00.360]  cheering for George W. Bush including this pastor when it was over now I what I
[3:42:00.360 --> 3:42:03.840]  hadn't explained earlier in my background was I ended up in a very
[3:42:03.840 --> 3:42:06.840]  serious litigation with the federal government that went on for years and
[3:42:06.840 --> 3:42:11.960]  years and years and you know I always say I played Will Smith if you've ever
[3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:15.120]  seen that you've seen the movie enemy this day right yes okay well I played
[3:42:15.120 --> 3:42:20.000]  Will Smith in real life it just took me a lot longer to find Gene Hackman anyway
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:24.760]  so so so this minister cheered cheered but I've been cheered and after with
[3:42:24.760 --> 3:42:30.200]  over I said you know Patricia I just owned I lost six million dollars and I
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:33.760]  almost lost my life trying to stop Clinton and Bush family narcotics
[3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:37.480]  trafficking and you just jumped up and cheered for this guy and she said well
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:40.280]  he's going to be the winner and I said so he's a winner and I'm a loser and she
[3:42:40.280 --> 3:42:45.320]  said yeah that's right that's it they feel like they're part of the power
[3:42:45.320 --> 3:42:49.080]  structure even though it's going to destroy them well but here's the thing
[3:42:49.080 --> 3:42:56.720]  we have 57% of households in America now headed for 67% are are dependent on
[3:42:56.720 --> 3:43:02.640]  government money in other words you know I call it the tape room economy it's
[3:43:02.640 --> 3:43:06.480]  like having a tape room the tape room injects into you a chemical that makes
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:10.160]  you you know do what's to eat what's good for the tape room and see the tape
[3:43:10.160 --> 3:43:14.120]  room grows stronger and you go weaker right now the majority of us are
[3:43:14.120 --> 3:43:18.200]  practicing a philosophy of follow the tape room all that needs to happen Alex
[3:43:18.200 --> 3:43:22.480]  if you could get a critical math say you know the hundred monkey syndrome if
[3:43:22.480 --> 3:43:26.040]  you could get six to ten percent of the people saying you know I just I'm not
[3:43:26.040 --> 3:43:29.480]  going to go along with it I'm going to withdraw because you don't have a fight
[3:43:29.480 --> 3:43:33.080]  with them you don't want to get in a fight with the satellites you just want
[3:43:33.080 --> 3:43:36.440]  to say you know something I'm pulling my money out of your game because your game
[3:43:36.440 --> 3:43:40.600]  is shrinking the problem with a centralization economically is it
[3:43:40.600 --> 3:43:44.560]  shrinking the wealth it's making a few people a little wealthier but it's
[3:43:44.560 --> 3:43:49.880]  literally like if our body was in trauma you know if you were I got hit by a car
[3:43:49.880 --> 3:43:53.320]  body was in trauma the body would preserve the blood for the heart the
[3:43:53.320 --> 3:43:59.960]  lungs and the brain what's happening now is the economic body is preserving the
[3:43:59.960 --> 3:44:04.360]  blood for the toes and the fingers and it's cutting off the blood from the
[3:44:04.360 --> 3:44:08.480]  heart and the brains and that's why we're literally contemplating you know is
[3:44:08.480 --> 3:44:13.160]  this depopulation because you're you're literally killing off the real economy
[3:44:13.160 --> 3:44:17.960]  so you can centralize it because when you flood a country with this much
[3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:21.360]  government money and government debt to keep things going that's what you're
[3:44:21.360 --> 3:44:25.880]  doing you're basically shrinking the pie of wealth in a way that centralizes
[3:44:25.880 --> 3:44:30.960]  but people are going along and the minute we decide you know something this
[3:44:30.960 --> 3:44:37.200]  is really unhealthy this can't go in any place that's good for us our children
[3:44:37.200 --> 3:44:42.840]  our grandchildren and we start to shift in very this does not have to be picking
[3:44:42.840 --> 3:44:48.680]  a fight it's just withdrawing so if we turn off our TVs so we withdraw our time
[3:44:48.680 --> 3:44:53.760]  if we if we withdraw our money from the big financial institutions in the big
[3:44:53.760 --> 3:45:00.120]  banks and start what I call demonetizing if you if you come into any
[3:45:00.120 --> 3:45:04.840]  county in America Alex you will find you know literally one person has got
[3:45:04.840 --> 3:45:10.720]  their savings and bank CDs that are in a large New York bank another one has
[3:45:10.720 --> 3:45:15.760]  their IRA and stock of that same large New York bank and their best friend is
[3:45:15.760 --> 3:45:20.240]  borrowing money from that New York bank on their credit card for 23% so the
[3:45:20.240 --> 3:45:26.440]  first two women are making three to four percent if they're lucky and and their
[3:45:26.440 --> 3:45:30.560]  friend is borrowing that money back for 23% well why do they need a big New
[3:45:30.560 --> 3:45:35.120]  York bank to be in the middle of them exactly they should be loaning to each
[3:45:35.120 --> 3:45:40.480]  other and keeping it all local right let me let me give you another example in
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:46.320]  Tennessee because there is so here's where the opportunity is when you start
[3:45:46.320 --> 3:45:50.320]  to dig in and you bring transparency to how the money works in a place and you
[3:45:50.320 --> 3:45:55.880]  say look let's withdraw from the tapeworm system in a way that makes us
[3:45:55.880 --> 3:46:00.640]  money because because the problem we have is our wealth is shrinking so we need
[3:46:00.640 --> 3:46:05.200]  to find a way to withdraw from the system that expands our wealth and and
[3:46:05.200 --> 3:46:10.080]  stops us from getting drained financially so for example I can't tell
[3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:14.920]  you how many communities and counties where you will find government
[3:46:14.920 --> 3:46:20.400]  contracts paying a corporation up to a hundred and a hundred fifty dollars an
[3:46:20.400 --> 3:46:24.720]  hour to do something that someone in that community would love to do for 25
[3:46:24.720 --> 3:46:28.400]  dollars an hour plus health care and they should go in and take control of
[3:46:28.400 --> 3:46:31.680]  their counties and make the county spend the money with the locals but they
[3:46:31.680 --> 3:46:36.680]  don't because one big fat cat wants to keep it all for themselves just at a
[3:46:36.680 --> 3:46:40.760]  primitive level they don't want anybody else in the little town getting uppity
[3:46:40.760 --> 3:46:46.520]  they have the same new the same neurosis that the elite has an instinctive need to
[3:46:46.520 --> 3:46:51.040]  keep people down around them but in the process they destroy they destroy their
[3:46:51.040 --> 3:46:56.040]  own future well but I think most people are scared it's complicated it's scared
[3:46:56.040 --> 3:46:59.320]  how do you organize to do something that's effective now let me give you an
[3:46:59.320 --> 3:47:06.320]  example in Florida and Tennessee the I'm sure it's more states to the food that we
[3:47:06.320 --> 3:47:12.080]  know I live in Tennessee 20% of our population is now in food stamps 20%
[3:47:12.080 --> 3:47:18.320]  Alex now there was a woman in Florida who who worked all her life and then
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:23.480]  lost her job when the economy went down she got food stamps she had problem with
[3:47:23.480 --> 3:47:27.720]  the food stamps called the food stamp hotline the customer service line to
[3:47:27.720 --> 3:47:31.820]  discover that the woman she was talking to who was helping you know doing
[3:47:31.820 --> 3:47:38.720]  customer service for her food stamps work for JP Morgan Chase in India okay so
[3:47:38.720 --> 3:47:42.960]  the government is paying her not to work at the same time the government is
[3:47:42.960 --> 3:47:47.360]  paying somebody in India to do a job she could do this doesn't make any sense
[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:51.840]  because the government is paying twice but it's a payoff the government's
[3:47:51.840 --> 3:47:57.520]  doing to India to go into the globalist model well here's the thing if you if
[3:47:57.520 --> 3:48:01.960]  I run a government contract through a stock that's trading it at 20 times
[3:48:01.960 --> 3:48:07.960]  earnings so so let's say my I my stock is trading at 20 times earnings I give a
[3:48:07.960 --> 3:48:12.400]  government contract for a hundred million dollars they make 10 million in
[3:48:12.400 --> 3:48:17.480]  profit on that government contract their stock goes up 200 million that gives them
[3:48:17.480 --> 3:48:22.600]  the capital gains they need to to donate to elections if you look at campaign
[3:48:22.600 --> 3:48:27.160]  donations the majority of that money comes from from capital gains on either
[3:48:27.160 --> 3:48:32.200]  real estate or stock and and the way you get a stock to go up is by giving it
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:35.440]  lots of government contracts or government purchases are changing the
[3:48:35.440 --> 3:48:39.240]  rules I have a great article I wrote Colt Dylan read in the aristocracy of
[3:48:39.240 --> 3:48:44.240]  stock profits and it was about how much money a stock of prisons private
[3:48:44.240 --> 3:48:49.000]  prison stock trades on how many beds it has so think of this as slavery at the
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:53.200]  at the time I wrote the article every additional bed you get cost your stock
[3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:59.520]  to go up $25,000 so the more if you can pass a law that says you know mandated
[3:48:59.520 --> 3:49:04.000]  sentences are longer the stocks will go up just on the passage of the law
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:09.560]  anticipating the average American doesn't know that big banks that own and
[3:49:09.560 --> 3:49:16.080]  control prison complexes openly come in and give money right to build more
[3:49:16.080 --> 3:49:19.840]  prisons and you know to lobby with your tax money to build the prison that they
[3:49:19.840 --> 3:49:23.920]  then make the profit off of and they lobby to pass more laws and it's the
[3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:27.560]  alcohol and cigarette lobbies that kill more than anybody who are the biggest
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:33.160]  lobbyists for the drug war well what's interesting is once what if we reached a
[3:49:33.160 --> 3:49:38.800]  point where where a significant and I mean the six to ten percent like the
[3:49:38.800 --> 3:49:43.280]  hundred monkey syndrome if we could get a critical mass of people to see how the
[3:49:43.280 --> 3:49:48.160]  game is played and how it works around the money that's when things start to
[3:49:48.160 --> 3:49:56.200]  change now you know in 1997 and let me let me tell you the story in 1997 remember
[3:49:56.200 --> 3:50:02.040]  I'm trying to persuade the pension funds to reinvest in America you know in a way
[3:50:02.040 --> 3:50:06.840]  that really could have made the pension funds tremendous amounts of money compared
[3:50:06.840 --> 3:50:11.880]  to the way they've lost money and all these frauds so 1997 I had a I had a
[3:50:11.880 --> 3:50:16.620]  wonderful board of pension fund leaders including the president of the Cal
[3:50:16.620 --> 3:50:21.800]  Purse which is the largest pension fund in the country and and I gave them my
[3:50:21.800 --> 3:50:26.520]  presentation of how we could reinvest in America in a way that would make a lot
[3:50:26.520 --> 3:50:30.560]  of money for the pension funds and the president of Cal Purse looked at me and
[3:50:30.560 --> 3:50:34.480]  said you don't understand it's too late they've given up on the country they're
[3:50:34.480 --> 3:50:41.160]  moving all the money out starting in the fall and that was 1997 and so the fall
[3:50:41.160 --> 3:50:46.920]  of 1997 was the beginning of federal fiscal 1998 and that's one four trillion
[3:50:46.920 --> 3:50:51.840]  four trillion dollars in 98 the next four years went missing from the federal
[3:50:51.840 --> 3:50:55.560]  government and and we made a decision to move all the money out of the country
[3:50:55.560 --> 3:51:00.160]  Alex and we covered it up by bubbling with the housing bubble and this huge

[3:52:16.360 --> 3:52:21.440]  I've turned in this influence on our president in Congress and they really
[3:52:21.440 --> 3:52:26.240]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[3:54:28.440 --> 3:54:33.000]  it said she'll come back on in two weeks and I'm really looking forward to that I
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:35.680]  was just flattered for her to tell me that she actually bought a copy of the
[3:54:35.680 --> 3:54:39.440]  Obama deception we're gonna mail her a copy of fall the Republic I don't have
[3:54:39.440 --> 3:54:44.120]  time to play it but we have the CNN clip now it'll be up on info wars.com and
[3:54:44.120 --> 3:54:49.200]  prism planet.com after the show CNN talking about fall the Republic and not
[3:54:49.200 --> 3:54:55.920]  in a nice way again CBS News Jerusalem Post a whole bunch of mainstream
[3:54:55.920 --> 3:55:03.400]  publications said that I'm incredibly influential dangerous charismatic what
[3:55:03.400 --> 3:55:08.480]  was one quote incredibly popular and believe me I don't like this is a
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:12.360]  power trip I know it's dangerous going up against these folks Catherine what
[3:55:12.360 --> 3:55:16.080]  does it mean though because on the street you were just saying during the
[3:55:16.080 --> 3:55:19.720]  break people are saying we're mainstream now I mean people are really
[3:55:19.720 --> 3:55:26.160]  listening to us we're going from being kind of cutting edge to being passed
[3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:32.560]  saying in a way but I mean does that creep you out to know that the system is
[3:55:32.560 --> 3:55:37.840]  going from being arrogant about us to now actually sitting up and going you
[3:55:37.840 --> 3:55:42.400]  know danger will Robinson I mean I see them putting out alarm flares remember
[3:55:42.400 --> 3:55:49.400]  it the corporate media will always shift to protect its channel so so what
[3:55:49.400 --> 3:55:55.000]  happens is you know you do something wonderful and it starts to draw a lot
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:56:00.160]  of interest and support and they will suddenly shift to try and and co-op that
[3:56:00.160 --> 3:56:05.360]  audience back in something that's you know like but not the same thing but
[3:56:05.360 --> 3:56:07.960]  don't they know that's not gonna work anymore because they've lost all
[3:56:07.960 --> 3:56:12.760]  credibility well that's that's why you know they keep getting closer and
[3:56:12.760 --> 3:56:15.240]  closer to what we're saying because they're trying to protect the channel
[3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:20.640]  is our audience grows what was Obama because we talked during a break what
[3:56:20.640 --> 3:56:25.480]  is Obama all about who is Obama well I think Obama was somebody who was
[3:56:25.480 --> 3:56:32.200]  profiled in other words you know a lot of smart money said look what we have
[3:56:32.200 --> 3:56:38.640]  engaged in massive financial fraud this thing is is a bubble and and essentially
[3:56:38.640 --> 3:56:44.520]  we're gonna pump and dump it but on the dump if if we don't do something we are
[3:56:44.520 --> 3:56:48.880]  really gonna have trouble maintaining control and so I think the question for
[3:56:48.880 --> 3:56:54.360]  them was who you know what kind of candidate and what kind of sort of new
[3:56:54.360 --> 3:57:01.200]  president could could maintain you know could maintain the control because
[3:57:01.200 --> 3:57:06.120]  remember what you always want to do is present people with a style choice that
[3:57:06.120 --> 3:57:10.480]  makes them feel good so you don't have to give them any money what what is
[3:57:10.480 --> 3:57:14.160]  happening is we're fundamentally renegotiating the relationship between
[3:57:14.160 --> 3:57:18.600]  labor and capital and they needed somebody who could consolidate their
[3:57:18.600 --> 3:57:23.320]  position and and what we've seen is from the time that Obama became the
[3:57:23.320 --> 3:57:29.880]  candidate he has used his political credibility to essentially make
[3:57:29.880 --> 3:57:35.360]  possible a 12 trillion dollar gift to the banking system and it's quite
[3:57:35.360 --> 3:57:41.080]  extraordinary Alex because 12 trillion dollars is the total amount of money that
[3:57:41.080 --> 3:57:44.840]  the United States government has borrowed since the Revolutionary War so
[3:57:44.840 --> 3:57:50.120]  that includes paying for World War two World War one Vietnam and that amount of
[3:57:50.120 --> 3:57:55.040]  money we've gifted to the banking system now that's an enormous that's
[3:57:55.040 --> 3:57:59.720]  probably the most impressive political feed in the in the history of the planet
[3:57:59.720 --> 3:58:03.920]  it's incredible and he did all this while saying he was balancing the budget
[3:58:03.920 --> 3:58:10.320]  and was going to cut things well what what's amazing is because there's so
[3:58:10.320 --> 3:58:17.720]  many people who I I see still supporting Obama because they can't fathom that
[3:58:17.720 --> 3:58:23.720]  that that the president is not is it is a fashion statement as opposed to a real
[3:58:23.720 --> 3:58:30.440]  manager of power salari.com a lot of great investment information there so
[3:58:30.440 --> 3:58:34.640]  much to offer salari.com Catherine Austin Finch I look forward to having you back
