[00:00.000 --> 00:24.680]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24.680 --> 00:30.720]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a
[00:30.720 --> 00:37.320]  new world order, a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the
[00:37.320 --> 00:39.040]  conduct of nations.
[00:39.040 --> 00:45.800]  Now we can see a new world coming into view, a world in which there is the very real prospect
[00:45.800 --> 00:49.960]  of a new world order, a new world order can emerge.
[00:49.960 --> 00:57.840]  They took the babies out of incubators, took the incubators and left the children to die
[00:57.840 --> 00:58.840]  on the cold floor.
[00:58.840 --> 01:04.320]  And they had kids in incubators and they were thrown out of the incubators so that Kuwait
[01:04.320 --> 01:07.560]  could be systematically dismantled.
[01:07.560 --> 01:13.120]  Just two hours ago, Allied Air Forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq and
[01:13.120 --> 01:14.120]  Kuwait.
[01:14.120 --> 01:19.440]  Kuwait, a member of the Arab League and a member of the United Nations, was crushed.
[01:19.440 --> 01:22.720]  It's people brutalized.
[01:22.720 --> 01:27.520]  Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait.
[01:27.520 --> 01:30.960]  Tonight, the battle has been joined.
[01:30.960 --> 01:47.240]  And that was twenty, eight years ago.
[01:47.240 --> 01:54.160]  And now George Herbert Walker Bush, his father was the head Nazi in the United States, almost
[01:54.160 --> 01:56.680]  brought down the country with Hitler.
[01:56.680 --> 02:03.760]  The man who helped give China one-sided trade deal that has deindustrialized this nation.
[02:03.760 --> 02:07.560]  The man who promoted the whole Rockefeller Carnegie Endowment Project for World Government
[02:07.560 --> 02:11.480]  and helped shut down the industry in this nation.
[02:11.480 --> 02:19.840]  The man who said the NRA should be shut down, the anti-gun Democrat, open borders Democrat
[02:19.840 --> 02:24.480]  masquerading as a conservative as a nationalist is dead.
[02:24.480 --> 02:32.400]  But that isn't stopping the corporate media from worshiping him in just a disgusting fashion
[02:32.400 --> 02:34.360]  like they did John McCain.
[02:34.360 --> 02:41.400]  Well, I am not going to sit here and lie about George H. W. Bush.
[02:41.400 --> 02:49.160]  He was not an American, he was a globalist, and he ordered U.S. and Russian munitions
[02:49.160 --> 02:54.720]  that had been sold to Saddam Hussein at more than a hundred sites like Kamasya to be detonated
[02:54.720 --> 03:01.080]  and destroyed in place, knowing that would rain down chemical weapons that would precipitate
[03:01.080 --> 03:06.840]  out in the brainstem and cause hundreds of thousands of the troops to die.
[03:06.840 --> 03:11.120]  The casualties of Gulf War I where they claimed only a few hundred people died on our side
[03:11.120 --> 03:12.840]  is a lie.
[03:12.840 --> 03:17.160]  Casualties are now estimated with top experts I've had like Dr. Doug Rocky from the Army
[03:17.160 --> 03:20.960]  and others at 300 plus thousand.
[03:20.960 --> 03:29.960]  And they would deny care to those soldiers, Marines, airmen, sailors because this man
[03:29.960 --> 03:32.720]  was a monster.
[03:32.720 --> 03:39.320]  An absolute America-hating monster with every fiber of his being, a globalist selling this
[03:39.320 --> 03:41.320]  country out.
[03:41.320 --> 03:47.880]  We're all supposed to forget about that and have him be rehabilitated now, have him be
[03:47.880 --> 03:49.520]  rehabilitated now.
[03:49.520 --> 03:56.520]  No, ladies and gentlemen, George Herbert Walker Bush presided over the attempt to wreck this
[03:56.520 --> 04:02.480]  country to run into the rocks and help parlay our power into the monster that we now face
[04:02.480 --> 04:03.480]  in communist China.
[04:03.480 --> 04:07.680]  He was a David Rockefeller protégé.
[04:07.680 --> 04:15.760]  He was a Rockefeller Republican, which means basically the Clintons.
[04:15.760 --> 04:17.440]  And he helped create the Clintons.
[04:17.440 --> 04:21.000]  That was all a ruse in 1992.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.320]  He worked for them, they for he, and later, of course I told you that twenty something
[04:25.320 --> 04:31.200]  years ago, they basically admitted it, that they were all family.
[04:31.200 --> 04:35.920]  You know, it's fitting that the Clintons can't even get a thousand people to come see them
[04:35.920 --> 04:39.360]  speak now all over the country on their tour.
[04:39.360 --> 04:42.680]  And there was the headline of the New York Times, it's curtains for the Clintons.
[04:42.680 --> 04:49.080]  So, these old rotting trees of globalism are all kind of blew over in the windstorm
[04:49.080 --> 04:50.080]  that's sweeping the world.
[04:50.080 --> 04:54.880]  Oh, and in Spain, right wing nationalists just run a big election.
[04:54.880 --> 05:00.280]  So the good news is, globalism is dead and it's just now figuring it out.
[05:00.280 --> 05:05.160]  In the last few months, in full wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[05:05.160 --> 05:06.720]  of many of our best selling items.
[05:06.720 --> 05:10.000]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.360]  store wide, fifty to seventy five percent off double patriot points, let's extend that
[05:14.360 --> 05:19.440]  sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[05:19.440 --> 05:23.520]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine four to five super blue, you'll
[05:23.520 --> 05:28.240]  get a free gift of a best selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[05:28.240 --> 05:31.520]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling
[05:31.520 --> 05:32.520]  out.
[05:32.520 --> 05:36.440]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it
[05:36.440 --> 05:37.440]  sells out.
[05:37.440 --> 05:39.760]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[05:39.760 --> 05:45.080]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[05:45.080 --> 05:46.600]  So this is a loss leader.
[05:46.600 --> 05:48.240]  We are losing money on this.
[05:48.240 --> 05:49.680]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.640]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything and don't fight the crowds in four store dot
[05:53.640 --> 05:58.040]  com, infowarslife.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[05:58.040 --> 06:03.280]  God bless you and thank you for your support.
[06:03.280 --> 06:05.960]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:05.960 --> 06:16.280]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:16.280 --> 06:28.160]  George Herbert Walker Bush's pedigree of globalism of the trilateral commission of the CFR working
[06:28.160 --> 06:34.040]  against this country is the most thoroughbred I've ever seen.
[06:34.040 --> 06:40.520]  He came very close to destroying this country and he still may be successful from the grave.
[06:40.520 --> 06:46.480]  But one thing, the New York Times and CNN got right, many others, Washington Post, they
[06:46.480 --> 06:53.400]  all had similar headlines, similar PR when George Herbert Walker Bush died Friday was
[06:53.400 --> 07:03.400]  that Donald J. Trump and George Herbert Walker Bush are totally different men, complete opposites.
[07:03.400 --> 07:04.400]  That's right.
[07:04.400 --> 07:07.320]  One is for world government, unelected, unaccountable.
[07:07.320 --> 07:12.840]  One helps sell us out to communist China.
[07:12.840 --> 07:17.080]  One is totally for this nation and in less than two years had the country almost turned
[07:17.080 --> 07:24.880]  around until the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on purpose to scuttle to wreck the recovery.
[07:24.880 --> 07:32.080]  You go over the anti gun open border promotion of George Walker Bush or his father being the
[07:32.080 --> 07:46.560]  top Nazi in the U.S. on record and it really is flabbergasting to think about how they
[07:46.560 --> 07:51.680]  set this country on course to be completely sold out and deindustrialized the chai comms.
[07:51.680 --> 07:54.680]  I mean, he was the U.S. ambassador that got the deal done.
[07:54.680 --> 07:57.320]  He was the head of the CIA that set it all up.
[07:57.320 --> 08:02.040]  He's the guy that shipped the narcotics into the country.
[08:02.040 --> 08:07.320]  If it's bad, if it's evil, it was George Herbert Walker Bush had his hands all over
[08:07.320 --> 08:08.320]  it.
[08:08.320 --> 08:09.320]  Ronald Reagan hated him.
[08:09.320 --> 08:11.600]  We could play the clips.
[08:11.600 --> 08:15.000]  We've played them before.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.640]  Ronald Reagan talks about how bad George Herbert Walker Bush is.
[08:17.640 --> 08:21.040]  Ronald Reagan talks about George Herbert Walker Bush and the trilateral commission and how
[08:21.040 --> 08:23.640]  he wants world government.
[08:23.640 --> 08:27.800]  That was on the campaign trail in 1979, 1980.
[08:27.800 --> 08:34.200]  They told Reagan at the convention, you're not going to get the nomination if you don't
[08:34.200 --> 08:36.400]  put George Herbert Walker Bush in.
[08:36.400 --> 08:46.080]  Then a good family friend, John Hinckley Jr., best friends with the family, CIA, goes and
[08:46.080 --> 08:54.200]  two nights after meeting with the Bushes, Denver Post reported, and shoots Ronald Reagan.
[08:54.200 --> 09:00.600]  Nancy Reagan would not even talk to the Bushes after that point.
[09:00.600 --> 09:06.400]  Would not even talk to them, and Reagan, except for photo ops, stopped having him even in
[09:06.400 --> 09:08.880]  the room with him.
[09:08.880 --> 09:12.600]  Oh, yeah.
[09:12.600 --> 09:17.320]  I know the folks that know the Reagan very closely, and I remember I was told this by
[09:17.320 --> 09:22.840]  some sources before it ever came out and the letters were released a few years ago of John
[09:22.840 --> 09:27.480]  F. Kennedy's wife saying that she knew LBJ had ordered her husband killed.
[09:27.480 --> 09:30.200]  Well, it's the same thing with Nancy.
[09:30.200 --> 09:33.280]  I know people that had conversations with him before she died.
[09:33.280 --> 09:38.000]  I'm not liberty to say their names, but you know, we get some big info here.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.320]  Like when Matt Drudge came and laid out the whole Internet censorship plan, Supreme Court
[09:41.320 --> 09:43.400]  Justice told him.
[09:43.400 --> 09:49.440]  We get some hardcore folks here on the air, and off the air, and Nancy Reagan, well, it's
[09:49.440 --> 09:55.080]  on record she hated the Bushes and wouldn't talk to them after Ronnie was shot.
[09:55.080 --> 09:58.400]  But I'm not going to sit here and celebrate these thugs.
[09:58.400 --> 10:01.240]  Everybody else is scared of them, and I'm not whistling past the graveyard.
[10:01.240 --> 10:04.480]  I'm not trying to stick my head in the lion's mouth for no reason.
[10:04.480 --> 10:06.160]  For my children and your children have a future.
[10:06.160 --> 10:11.120]  We've got to stop worshiping these globalists and letting the mainstream media put a cherry
[10:11.120 --> 10:16.120]  and some whipped cream and nuts on top of the big giant stinking pile of feces these
[10:16.120 --> 10:18.120]  people crapped on us.
[10:18.120 --> 10:25.760]  Knowing that a perfume dumped onto a latrine to an open sewer is going to fix it.
[10:25.760 --> 10:32.040]  Now, speaking of folks connected to the president, just come on later during the broadcast, our
[10:32.040 --> 10:37.480]  own Roger Stone, Trump tweeted this out today, I will never testify against Trump.
[10:37.480 --> 10:40.960]  This statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not
[10:40.960 --> 10:45.720]  be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about President
[10:45.720 --> 10:50.040]  Trump, nice to know that some people still have guts.
[10:50.040 --> 10:51.320]  Where is the crime?
[10:51.320 --> 10:52.920]  I engaged in politics.
[10:52.920 --> 10:59.760]  My purpose was to take a tip, which I thought to be solid, and then after that to follow
[10:59.760 --> 11:06.320]  the WikiLeaks Twitter feed and set a Google News alert for Julian Assange and use Twitter
[11:06.320 --> 11:12.680]  to hype as much voter and media attention to the disclosures when they came as politics.
[11:12.680 --> 11:14.120]  You were in this business once.
[11:14.120 --> 11:15.120]  That's called politics.
[11:15.120 --> 11:16.120]  You're proud?
[11:16.120 --> 11:20.280]  And Roger has said this here over and over again and in private to me.
[11:20.280 --> 11:26.440]  He can't say anything about the president because there's nothing.
[11:26.440 --> 11:27.560]  There's no Russia gate.
[11:27.560 --> 11:29.040]  There's no nothing.
[11:29.040 --> 11:34.640]  There's nothing but us trying to talk to Julian Assange.
[11:34.640 --> 11:38.880]  Believe me, I don't want to be in the middle of this, but we've confirmed from dozens
[11:38.880 --> 11:45.600]  of people, dozens that about a third of the questions are about yours truly.
[11:45.600 --> 11:49.720]  There's not even any reason to ask questions about me.
[11:49.720 --> 11:55.640]  I'm on record that Julian Assange would never give us the time of day, but would go on Fox,
[11:55.640 --> 12:03.360]  CNN, New York Times, BBC, constantly until I called him Hillary Clinton's corruption
[12:03.360 --> 12:04.360]  protector.
[12:04.360 --> 12:08.760]  I had a more disgusting name for it, but you've all heard the funny story about the big fat
[12:08.760 --> 12:12.720]  elephant in the cork in its rear end and the monkey that pulls it out.
[12:12.720 --> 12:16.680]  But Hillary Clinton's butt plug.
[12:16.680 --> 12:20.280]  And what I meant was, is let's get all the dirt on her out now.
[12:20.280 --> 12:21.280]  Let's go.
[12:21.280 --> 12:25.800]  He wanted to wait until October and maybe he was right.
[12:25.800 --> 12:27.760]  I was worried they were going to shut him down before then.
[12:27.760 --> 12:34.320]  And I think Julian Assange is a hero, but boy, we've been defending him saying he deserves
[12:34.320 --> 12:35.320]  a pardon.
[12:35.320 --> 12:41.960]  All those mainstream media people that he went and talked to and he leaked stuff to
[12:41.960 --> 12:44.200]  through his lawyers.
[12:44.200 --> 12:47.080]  Are any of them getting investigated for Russia stuff?
[12:47.080 --> 12:57.160]  No, it's those of us that were beating down his door and the door stayed shut and completely
[12:57.160 --> 13:01.520]  silent.
[13:01.520 --> 13:13.000]  But we were able, because we're not idiots, to go reverse engineer what would probably
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.240]  be in Hillary's foundation emails, because these were bigger than breadcrumbs.
[13:18.240 --> 13:20.080]  These were bread trucks.
[13:20.080 --> 13:26.360]  These were bakeries, each one, of all the Reuters, AP, New York Times, used to do some
[13:26.360 --> 13:31.800]  real reporting and they had her, Hillary's uranium one problem, Hillary's Russia problem,
[13:31.800 --> 13:38.200]  Hillary took 20 something million, gave him 25% of the uranium, Mueller was on the tarmac.
[13:38.200 --> 13:45.760]  This was all in the news years ago, before it became a campaign issue.
[13:45.760 --> 13:51.080]  And so yes, we are the ones that popularized all that.
[13:51.080 --> 13:56.040]  That's why we're really in trouble is because we stood up for America, we restored the Republic,
[13:56.040 --> 13:59.280]  the economy started to turn around, that would make us folk heroes.
[13:59.280 --> 14:04.720]  That would make America have a new culture and celebrate its rebirth of Americana.
[14:04.720 --> 14:12.280]  From the culture of death and hating ourselves back to the future, the Renaissance.
[14:12.280 --> 14:16.040]  But they can't have that, they have to demonize me, they have to demonize Trump, they have
[14:16.040 --> 14:19.960]  to demonize Roger Stone, they have to demonize Dr. Corsi, they have to demonize the independent
[14:19.960 --> 14:23.560]  press, they have to call us fake news and oh, we're the Russians, because they're the
[14:23.560 --> 14:27.280]  globalists that say America was never great, will never be that great.
[14:27.280 --> 14:31.080]  And there's all these new statements by Democrats, I can't even keep track of them.
[14:31.080 --> 14:36.680]  There's videos on InfoWars.com today, with all these Democrat Congress people and CNN
[14:36.680 --> 14:42.000]  hosts and saying America sucks and America's over and America's already peaked, that was
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.880]  Fareed Zarkaria today, that Bill Bilderberg globalist.
[14:46.880 --> 14:51.160]  Their culture is hating America.
[14:51.160 --> 14:55.720]  That's the globalist culture.
[14:55.720 --> 15:02.160]  And it makes me sick, it really does, that then they can turn around and point at us
[15:02.160 --> 15:07.680]  who are totally pro-America, pro-first amendment, pro-private property, pro-guide, pro-religious
[15:07.680 --> 15:17.240]  freedom, pro-sovereignty, pro-constitutional government, absolute flaming Americana believers.
[15:17.240 --> 15:23.200]  I mean, we are on fire, and then what do the outside globalists do?
[15:23.200 --> 15:27.360]  Out of one side of their mouth, they say they hate the country and then actively try to
[15:27.360 --> 15:29.760]  run it in the ground and bankrupt it and kill the recovery.
[15:29.760 --> 15:34.600]  Now the other side, they point at us and say we are the traitors.
[15:34.600 --> 15:39.680]  Man, if the public buys that, they're really stupid, but you see why they're doing it,
[15:39.680 --> 15:43.080]  because they're the outsiders, they're the traitors, they're the enemies.
[15:43.080 --> 15:47.920]  You've got a ton of news, France is on fire, Macron made a clear martial law, more national
[15:47.920 --> 15:51.200]  is getting elected everywhere, we're on the march, the empire is on the run.
[15:51.200 --> 15:56.560]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, tomorrow's news today.
[15:56.560 --> 15:59.600]  Stay with us and spread the word.
[15:59.600 --> 16:03.360]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[16:29.200 --> 16:33.040]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food
[16:33.040 --> 16:34.040]  and boil water.
[16:34.040 --> 16:38.640]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's
[16:38.640 --> 16:39.840]  a much better way.
[16:39.840 --> 16:44.680]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities
[16:44.680 --> 16:46.360]  of sticks and twigs for fuel.

[17:29.000 --> 17:34.400]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:34.400 --> 17:35.400]  the world.
[17:35.400 --> 17:38.400]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:38.400 --> 17:44.360]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:44.360 --> 17:48.160]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:48.160 --> 17:49.160]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:49.160 --> 17:50.680]  Who do we fight for?
[17:50.680 --> 17:57.280]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[17:57.280 --> 18:00.480]  at Amazon Books.
[18:00.480 --> 18:04.360]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[18:04.360 --> 18:10.120]  Using pollen block, we have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress
[18:10.120 --> 18:16.440]  symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory
[18:16.440 --> 18:17.440]  function.
[18:17.440 --> 18:23.600]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.600 --> 18:26.920]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.920 --> 18:31.600]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.600 --> 18:36.920]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.920 --> 18:38.420]  symptoms.
[18:38.420 --> 18:40.600]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:40.600 --> 18:41.600]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.600 --> 18:46.520]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.520 --> 18:52.320]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.320 --> 18:55.040]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.040 --> 19:20.640]  Check to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[19:20.640 --> 19:44.120]  Eat back the globalists and destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want
[19:44.120 --> 19:56.560]  to live.
[19:56.560 --> 20:03.560]  And with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[20:26.560 --> 20:30.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:39.560 --> 20:45.560]  They've got groups of individuals showing up to take photos and wave and cheer
[20:45.560 --> 20:52.560]  for the body of George H.W. Bush being flown to Lyon State in Washington, D.C.
[20:52.560 --> 20:57.560]  On Wednesday, they're supposed to shut the part of the government down.
[20:57.560 --> 21:00.560]  They're going to shut the stock market down in honor of this individual
[21:00.560 --> 21:06.560]  who tried to completely destroy the country's economy, signed it over to China,
[21:06.560 --> 21:11.560]  helped sell the nation out, tried to prop up the old Soviet Union,
[21:11.560 --> 21:14.560]  tried to keep oligarchs in charge over there.
[21:14.560 --> 21:16.560]  That's all been confirmed.
[21:16.560 --> 21:20.560]  He did everything he could to keep the New World Order going.
[21:20.560 --> 21:24.560]  And that's a New World Order where the United States did not have sovereignty.
[21:24.560 --> 21:29.560]  He signed on to the UNESCO Global Biological Diversity Treaty,
[21:29.560 --> 21:33.560]  the Carbon Tax treaties, all of it in 1992.
[21:33.560 --> 21:39.560]  Congress didn't ratify any of it, but it shows the damage this individual did.
[21:39.560 --> 21:47.560]  So they get these tight little throngs of bureaucrats and minions of the bushes out there
[21:47.560 --> 21:49.560]  to make it look like he's a rock star.
[21:49.560 --> 21:51.560]  Notice how close you're watching on TV.
[21:51.560 --> 21:55.560]  The camera shot is.
[21:55.560 --> 22:00.560]  That's because it's not a very big crowd of people.
[22:00.560 --> 22:03.560]  And there he goes, taking off out of Houston.
[22:03.560 --> 22:05.560]  We're going to play at the end of this segment.
[22:05.560 --> 22:11.560]  It's a short clip of him lying about babies and incubators that were never killed that didn't exist.
[22:11.560 --> 22:16.560]  That's confirmed. They admit the babies and incubators, 1990, never happened.
[22:16.560 --> 22:23.560]  He told Saddam Hussein through April, last week, U.S. Ambassador to go ahead and invade Calate.
[22:23.560 --> 22:27.560]  Saddam had taken the order, put him by the CIA in 79.
[22:27.560 --> 22:38.560]  He'd taken the order in 82 to start the Iraq-Iran war or the Iran-Iraq war that killed several million Iranians
[22:38.560 --> 22:46.560]  and 600,000 or so of memory-serves folks there on the Iraqi side.
[22:46.560 --> 22:52.560]  And then Saddam wanted his 30 billion in debt forgiven because he'd done it for the United States.
[22:52.560 --> 22:57.560]  And they said, no, because they were globalists and they set him up to then destabilize the region.
[22:57.560 --> 23:00.560]  And now it's far worse off today.
[23:00.560 --> 23:04.560]  And that's just some of the legacy of this guy.
[23:04.560 --> 23:14.560]  The New World Order coming into view where nation states are subservient to the United Nations, founders' dreams.
[23:14.560 --> 23:17.560]  And back then we'd point out, hey, the New World Order is bad. We don't want it.
[23:17.560 --> 23:20.560]  And they'd go, there's no New World Order. No one wants World Government.
[23:20.560 --> 23:25.560]  We're like, well, George Herbert Walker, Bush writes books about it.
[23:25.560 --> 23:27.560]  That's what's crazy about this.
[23:27.560 --> 23:30.560]  Now, I don't want to spend all day on Bush.
[23:30.560 --> 23:34.560]  I'm going to be done talking about him here in a few minutes and we have a bunch of guests coming up today.
[23:34.560 --> 23:36.560]  Obviously, there's so much to get to.
[23:36.560 --> 23:38.560]  Stuart Rhodes is going to be down on the border.
[23:38.560 --> 23:40.560]  He's the founder of Oath Keepers.
[23:40.560 --> 23:42.560]  He's got exclusive announcement for us.
[23:42.560 --> 23:44.560]  He'll be in studio tomorrow.
[23:44.560 --> 23:46.560]  Owen Benjamin, always doing a great job.
[23:46.560 --> 23:52.560]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour ahead of Owen Shroyer and Roger Stone with the War Room today.
[23:52.560 --> 23:58.560]  I want to get into the huge situation unfolding in France especially and why it's a bellwether
[23:58.560 --> 24:01.560]  that's going to happen around the rest of the world.
[24:01.560 --> 24:06.560]  We're also going to look at the attempts of the Federal Reserve to plunge our economy
[24:06.560 --> 24:08.560]  and how this is real treason.
[24:08.560 --> 24:16.560]  Also, the census confirms 63% of non-citizens on welfare, 4.6 million households.
[24:16.560 --> 24:18.560]  That's what's designed to do is bankrupt the nation.
[24:18.560 --> 24:21.560]  That is all coming up.
[24:21.560 --> 24:27.560]  But first, let me make this really big and exciting announcement.
[24:27.560 --> 24:32.560]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this limited-run shirt that the crew had the idea to do
[24:32.560 --> 24:38.560]  because there's a popular saying on the Internet where all Alex Jones don't censor me
[24:38.560 --> 24:44.560]  and it's got the Gadgetten coiled snake instead of don't tread on me or won't tread on me.
[24:44.560 --> 24:48.560]  It says we're all Alex Jones, don't censor me.
[24:48.560 --> 24:53.560]  It's a very soft, nice fabric, black-on-white t-shirt.
[24:53.560 --> 25:01.560]  It is absolutely free at m4warstore.com with any purchase.
[25:01.560 --> 25:08.560]  That means one tube of toothpaste, fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue,
[25:08.560 --> 25:12.560]  or a water filtration system where you buy another t-shirt, you get this one free
[25:12.560 --> 25:15.560]  and there's store-wide free shipping.
[25:15.560 --> 25:20.560]  And there's 50% to 75% off across the board on thousands of items.
[25:20.560 --> 25:24.560]  50% is the lowest special, 75% is the highest.
[25:24.560 --> 25:29.560]  We are selling all of our inventory out to go leaner and meaner into the new year
[25:29.560 --> 25:33.560]  because you've seen how Soros and the Globlos are trying to shut down m4wars,
[25:33.560 --> 25:36.560]  trying to take our payment processors, trying to shut us down.
[25:36.560 --> 25:40.560]  So this way you don't battle the crowds, you don't battle the traffic,
[25:40.560 --> 25:46.560]  you get hands down the best deals we've ever offered on best-selling items
[25:46.560 --> 25:51.560]  that would still probably sell out some of the stuff we've got by February or so.
[25:51.560 --> 25:57.560]  No, I'm selling the entire warehouse right here in Austin, Texas, out by the end of this year
[25:57.560 --> 26:00.560]  and we're on line to do it, so everything's for sale.
[26:00.560 --> 26:03.560]  Some things are about to sell out, some things have already sold out.
[26:03.560 --> 26:05.560]  We still have, I'd say, 90% of our different items,
[26:05.560 --> 26:09.560]  but in the next few days obviously those numbers are going to start going down,
[26:09.560 --> 26:15.560]  but right now it's all there, X3, X2, bodies, ultimate, turmeric formula.
[26:15.560 --> 26:19.560]  But let me say that again, you get store-wide free shipping, 50-75% off,
[26:19.560 --> 26:23.560]  double Patriot points on your next order, so instead of 5% on each dollar,
[26:23.560 --> 26:26.560]  you get 10 cents on every dollar.
[26:26.560 --> 26:28.560]  This is insane.
[26:28.560 --> 26:34.560]  And this free t-shirt, now, they printed 5,000 of these up,
[26:34.560 --> 26:38.560]  so that means by the end of this week, those Christmas sales are always heavy,
[26:38.560 --> 26:40.560]  these shirts will be sold out.
[26:40.560 --> 26:44.560]  This is a limited edition where all Alex Jones don't censor me
[26:44.560 --> 26:52.560]  and then it'll be a new shirt that will be the free gift that you get with it.
[26:52.560 --> 26:55.560]  It'll be another one of these great shirts we've got,
[26:55.560 --> 27:00.560]  but they're all there at infowarstore.com, so you cannot beat this deal.
[27:00.560 --> 27:04.560]  This is way above even the specials I've been running the last two months
[27:04.560 --> 27:07.560]  that have already been our biggest ever.
[27:07.560 --> 27:11.560]  So take advantage of it, help us fund ourselves into next year,
[27:11.560 --> 27:15.560]  try some of the great products you've never tried, try Alpha Power,
[27:15.560 --> 27:21.560]  try Brainforce, try X3, try Super Male and Super Female Vitality,
[27:21.560 --> 27:26.560]  which is incredibly high quality, cold-pressed herbs, 5-star ratings.
[27:26.560 --> 27:28.560]  We've had it out for four years.
[27:28.560 --> 27:32.560]  I'm discontinuing it because it's so expensive for us to make,
[27:32.560 --> 27:36.560]  it's so proprietary where we get it from Utah, one of the biggest firms out there,
[27:36.560 --> 27:40.560]  and I'm just done.
[27:40.560 --> 27:43.560]  So that's it for Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, it's amazing.
[27:43.560 --> 27:44.560]  If you want it, it's there.
[27:44.560 --> 27:48.560]  Alpha Power is organic, it's a similar formula, it's even stronger,
[27:48.560 --> 27:53.560]  but it's not cold-pressed, so some people like Super Male Super Male Vitality more.
[27:53.560 --> 28:00.560]  Alpha Power is amazing and it costs a fraction of what Super Male Super Male do,
[28:00.560 --> 28:09.560]  but right now they're 50% off and there's just a bunch of other specials at infowarstore.com.
[28:09.560 --> 28:13.560]  So I would just encourage you all to go to infowarstore.com.
[28:13.560 --> 28:17.560]  For the next 12 days, the unprecedented 12 days of Christmas sale launches today

[28:31.560 --> 28:32.560]  We'll be back.

[32:00.560 --> 32:04.560]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[32:04.560 --> 32:07.560]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[32:07.560 --> 32:10.560]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater,
[32:10.560 --> 32:13.560]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:13.560 --> 32:17.560]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[32:17.560 --> 32:21.560]  Acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[32:21.560 --> 32:27.560]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[32:27.560 --> 32:33.560]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[32:33.560 --> 32:37.560]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[32:37.560 --> 32:40.560]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[32:40.560 --> 32:44.560]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:44.560 --> 32:49.560]  It turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[32:49.560 --> 32:54.560]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[32:54.560 --> 33:17.560]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:24.560 --> 33:28.560]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[33:28.560 --> 33:48.560]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:48.560 --> 33:51.560]  This country is fighting for its life.
[33:51.560 --> 33:54.560]  It shows every other nation on this planet.
[33:54.560 --> 33:59.560]  Many nations are run by horrible communist dictatorships like Venezuela and North Korea and aren't worth fighting for.
[33:59.560 --> 34:02.560]  Because they're corrupt beyond imagination.
[34:02.560 --> 34:09.560]  But still, you want the people to be free and you hope that you get out from under the strangling weight of the evil.
[34:09.560 --> 34:13.560]  But you look at America and its history and all of our resources and our cultural ideals,
[34:13.560 --> 34:17.560]  and how it's under attack scientifically,
[34:17.560 --> 34:25.560]  it's worth fighting for and it should be easy to promote freedom and sovereignty and financial opportunity
[34:25.560 --> 34:29.560]  that this country affords like no other.
[34:29.560 --> 34:38.560]  But instead, there's been a clear brainwashing, especially in the schools and universities, primary and secondary learning,
[34:38.560 --> 34:47.560]  to absolutely hate this country and it's undeniable now and it's the main cultural ethos,
[34:47.560 --> 34:54.560]  it is the main driving hymnal, it is the textbook, it is the blueprint, it is the roadmap,
[34:54.560 --> 35:06.560]  it is the compendium of their spirit to hate this nation.
[35:06.560 --> 35:14.560]  And when you come to that realization, I grew up, and I've talked about this a lot, I'm going to get to France right now,
[35:14.560 --> 35:25.560]  I grew up getting so sick of hearing about how great Texas was and pulling up at family members' houses
[35:25.560 --> 35:32.560]  and Texas flags all over the place and everybody got their guns out shooting them and they're never going to get our guns.
[35:32.560 --> 35:39.560]  And I like shooting the guns, don't get me wrong, I just as a kid thought, come on, this is a form of arrogance,
[35:39.560 --> 35:46.560]  this is a form of elitism, and then later I learned it was not that at all.
[35:46.560 --> 35:51.560]  These people had all been in the military or they'd all worked overseas and they'd all been through the system
[35:51.560 --> 35:55.560]  and they all knew even then there were people in our government, in our media and in our universities
[35:55.560 --> 36:00.560]  that hated this country and they understood the danger and were always telling me about the danger
[36:00.560 --> 36:06.560]  and so as soon as I grew up and experienced it in high school and college, I knew they were right.
[36:06.560 --> 36:17.560]  And I was like, why weren't you more on my ass? Good God, this is horrible, this is out of control, this is dangerous.
[36:17.560 --> 36:21.560]  And now I care so much, it just tortures the hell out of me.
[36:21.560 --> 36:26.560]  And I look at these slobs that don't care and I just sometimes I envy them because they have no idea
[36:26.560 --> 36:31.560]  how much danger they and their families are in and how bad things have gotten.
[36:31.560 --> 36:34.560]  But things are good to people all over the world are waking up.
[36:34.560 --> 36:45.560]  I cannot overstate, you know, every election except ours three weeks ago, every election globally
[36:45.560 --> 36:48.560]  unless it's Venezuela or the US where there was total election fraud.
[36:48.560 --> 36:53.560]  And we know there was, we know that Trump won this referendum.
[36:53.560 --> 36:56.560]  People see right through it, all the internal polls show it.
[36:56.560 --> 37:02.560]  Trump's got double the polls Macron's got, but the press is praising Macron.
[37:02.560 --> 37:14.560]  And in Brazil and in Chile and in Greece and in Spain and in Catalonia and in Italy and in Germany
[37:14.560 --> 37:21.560]  and in England and in Scotland and in Ireland and UK wide everywhere.
[37:21.560 --> 37:26.560]  The socialists are now going, wait a minute, we're going to bring in tens of millions of people
[37:26.560 --> 37:31.560]  to be on welfare, to be a client group and you're going to take my pension fund
[37:31.560 --> 37:38.560]  and suddenly the socialists everywhere are joining the nationalist right wingers game over.
[37:38.560 --> 37:45.560]  Because they were really socialist and really believed in socialism.
[37:45.560 --> 37:52.560]  They weren't Germany haters, they weren't French haters, they weren't Brazil haters,
[37:52.560 --> 37:58.560]  they weren't Spain haters, they weren't Italy haters.
[37:58.560 --> 38:04.560]  They just bought into the whole thing of, you know, social net or whatever that's then been exploited.
[38:04.560 --> 38:16.560]  And so now coalition governments have formed, you know who's on the side in England is the lefties
[38:16.560 --> 38:19.560]  that want to not be bankrupted with the right wingers.
[38:19.560 --> 38:23.560]  Then there's the big establishment right and establishment left that are together.
[38:23.560 --> 38:28.560]  And you don't help the poorest parts of Africa bringing the worst in brainwashed by Islam.
[38:28.560 --> 38:33.560]  You don't help the worst parts of the Middle East bringing them in and then having them make you adopt their system.
[38:33.560 --> 38:34.560]  That happens.
[38:34.560 --> 38:37.560]  You know, just five years ago they would deny that there were no go zones.
[38:37.560 --> 38:39.560]  Hell, just three years ago.
[38:39.560 --> 38:46.560]  We would send reporters to Paris, we would send reporters to other areas of Europe
[38:46.560 --> 38:49.560]  and they would go into the no-go zones and show it.
[38:49.560 --> 38:51.560]  Now they don't even deny it.
[38:51.560 --> 38:57.560]  Thousands of no-go zones in France, thousands of no-go zones in Sweden.
[38:57.560 --> 39:03.560]  Whole areas of cities, large parts of cities where there's not even plumbers going into them.
[39:03.560 --> 39:05.560]  The fire departments won't go in.
[39:05.560 --> 39:07.560]  There's no mail delivery.
[39:07.560 --> 39:10.560]  That's all over the news now.
[39:10.560 --> 39:13.560]  Because Islamic gangs will kill you.
[39:13.560 --> 39:14.560]  They've got hand grenades.
[39:14.560 --> 39:16.560]  They've got AK-47s.
[39:16.560 --> 39:19.560]  Those are all illegal in Sweden.
[39:19.560 --> 39:23.560]  Those are all illegal in Germany.
[39:23.560 --> 39:30.560]  It's harder to get a gun in Germany than almost anywhere in the world.
[39:30.560 --> 39:35.560]  So when we come back, I'm going to play some of the Macron clips of him getting hit in the head with an egg
[39:35.560 --> 39:39.560]  and Paris burning for three days and the police joining with the demonstrators.
[39:39.560 --> 39:45.560]  Because these aren't your regular Islamic folks that never worked a day in their life wearing Puma jumpsuits
[39:45.560 --> 39:49.560]  running around, you know, raping women or whatever.
[39:49.560 --> 39:57.560]  This is the French people are done because he just raised their gasoline prices by the equivalent of 30%,
[39:57.560 --> 39:59.560]  or a dollar or so for us.
[39:59.560 --> 40:02.560]  It's already like five and a half, six dollars equivalent here.
[40:02.560 --> 40:04.560]  They're in euros and liters.
[40:04.560 --> 40:08.560]  So now it's over six dollars for carbon taxes to pay, guess who?
[40:08.560 --> 40:11.560]  The Rothschild Carbon Bank in London.
[40:11.560 --> 40:15.560]  And everybody knows he was a Rothschild sex toy at 13, literally.
[40:15.560 --> 40:17.560]  He was passed around as a sex toy.
[40:17.560 --> 40:20.560]  He comes from the main Rothschild bank from nowhere.
[40:20.560 --> 40:23.560]  I mean, he was like 15, you know.
[40:23.560 --> 40:31.560]  And so their sex toy is now going to take tens of billions of French dollars, euros, money,
[40:31.560 --> 40:33.560]  and give it to the Rothschilds.
[40:33.560 --> 40:35.560]  Al Gore is involved, all of it.
[40:35.560 --> 40:38.560]  And so the French are going crazy right now.
[40:38.560 --> 40:42.560]  And Macron has got a 20% approval rating, even in their fake polls,
[40:42.560 --> 40:44.560]  but he wears little designer outfits.
[40:44.560 --> 40:46.560]  He's a little boy toy.
[40:46.560 --> 40:48.560]  Imagine what the globalists think when they look at him,
[40:48.560 --> 40:51.560]  and like half the old men on the stage have had sex with him.
[40:51.560 --> 40:54.560]  I mean, and again, it's not the fact that he was, you know,
[40:54.560 --> 40:57.560]  he's an abused person, probably mind-controlled.
[40:57.560 --> 41:01.560]  But the issue is, is that, you know, this woman gets him at 13,
[41:01.560 --> 41:05.560]  gets him in high society by 14, high society, pedophile society.
[41:05.560 --> 41:07.560]  They admit this.
[41:07.560 --> 41:11.560]  And he wears these little designer suits and he walks up there,
[41:11.560 --> 41:14.560]  and this is some dude they bang the hell out of at Orgy's.
[41:14.560 --> 41:17.560]  I mean, this is their globalist joke.
[41:17.560 --> 41:19.560]  It's like Michael Obama.
[41:19.560 --> 41:21.560]  It's all a big joke in our face.
[41:21.560 --> 41:26.560]  And yes, I actually do believe what John Rivers said.
[41:26.560 --> 41:29.560]  I'm serious, folks. It's all about throwing it in our face.
[41:29.560 --> 41:31.560]  Let's talk about George Herbert Walker Bush, though,
[41:31.560 --> 41:34.560]  who lied to get us in the Iraq war and wanted a new world order.
[41:34.560 --> 41:37.560]  Let's talk about that monster.
[41:37.560 --> 41:41.560]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves
[41:41.560 --> 41:45.560]  and for future generations a new world order.
[41:45.560 --> 41:49.560]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle,
[41:49.560 --> 41:52.560]  governs the conduct of nations.
[41:52.560 --> 41:55.560]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[41:55.560 --> 42:00.560]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[42:00.560 --> 42:03.560]  A new world order can emerge.
[42:03.560 --> 42:08.560]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[42:08.560 --> 42:12.560]  They took the incubators and left the children to die.
[42:12.560 --> 42:16.560]  They had kids in incubators and they were thrown out of the incubators
[42:16.560 --> 42:20.560]  so that Kuwait could be systematically dismantled.
[42:20.560 --> 42:24.560]  Just two hours ago, Allied Air Forces began an attack
[42:24.560 --> 42:27.560]  on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait.
[42:27.560 --> 42:30.560]  Kuwait, a member of the Arab League
[42:30.560 --> 42:33.560]  and a member of the United Nations, was crushed.
[42:33.560 --> 42:35.560]  It's people brutalized.
[42:35.560 --> 42:39.560]  Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war in Kuwait.
[42:39.560 --> 42:41.560]  Because you told him to.
[42:41.560 --> 42:44.560]  Tonight, the battle has been joined.
[42:48.560 --> 42:52.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are under resistance.
[42:52.560 --> 42:55.560]  Tonight, W is in hell.
[42:58.560 --> 43:00.560]  In the last few months,
[43:00.560 --> 43:05.560]  the war has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[43:05.560 --> 43:07.560]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[43:07.560 --> 43:09.560]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide.
[43:09.560 --> 43:12.560]  Fifty to seventy-five percent off double-patriot points.
[43:12.560 --> 43:18.560]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[43:18.560 --> 43:22.560]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver iodine, four to five super blue,
[43:22.560 --> 43:27.560]  you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[43:27.560 --> 43:30.560]  Everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[43:30.560 --> 43:35.560]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[43:35.560 --> 43:38.560]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[43:38.560 --> 43:43.560]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[43:43.560 --> 43:45.560]  So this is a loss leader.
[43:45.560 --> 43:46.560]  We are losing money on this.
[43:46.560 --> 43:48.560]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[43:48.560 --> 43:50.560]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[43:50.560 --> 43:51.560]  And don't fight the crowds.

[46:44.560 --> 46:48.560]  our best seller BrainForce Plus now 55% off.
[46:48.560 --> 46:50.560]  2018 has been an incredible year.
[46:50.560 --> 46:55.560]  As we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again for making the entire Info War possible.
[46:55.560 --> 47:16.560]  Again, you are the Resistance.
[47:25.560 --> 47:38.560]  Everybody knows that for two years plus, I have not wanted to cover the Russiagate thing,
[47:38.560 --> 47:42.560]  even though I've been in the middle of it, because it's absolute total BS.
[47:42.560 --> 47:46.560]  It'd be like if I wanted to talk about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs for two years.
[47:46.560 --> 47:48.560]  I mean, we get really old really fast.
[47:48.560 --> 47:53.560]  People are asking like, you know, you're on the news all the time being implicated working for Russia.
[47:53.560 --> 47:58.560]  It'd be like if I was implicated working for the Chinese or something, or Martians.
[47:58.560 --> 48:00.560]  What it does is make me angry.
[48:00.560 --> 48:06.560]  Every time I see Robert Mueller, I mean, it just, it wouldn't be so bad if he was just corrupt
[48:06.560 --> 48:10.560]  trying to set me up because I'm a political winner because we beat their butt politically.
[48:10.560 --> 48:18.560]  If he wasn't the actual traitor of the Russians, that's what really gets in my,
[48:18.560 --> 48:24.560]  it's under my saddle, folks.
[48:24.560 --> 48:28.560]  Anyways, excuse me, I'm starting to think about how angry I get sometimes and it makes me get angry.
[48:28.560 --> 48:30.560]  It's not a good place to be.
[48:30.560 --> 48:34.560]  I get exhausted later and can't finish my work throughout the day.
[48:34.560 --> 48:38.560]  Anger is not our friend, at least not normally.
[48:38.560 --> 48:39.560]  Let me get focused again.
[48:39.560 --> 48:41.560]  Excuse me, I'm starting to get angry again.
[48:41.560 --> 48:45.560]  Because let me tell you, I try to destroy my life with this Russia crap behind the scenes.
[48:45.560 --> 48:50.560]  I have a perfect banking score and they've got this secret Homeland Security designation
[48:50.560 --> 48:55.560]  that is going to have to be removed once this whole fake investigation is over,
[48:55.560 --> 49:01.560]  or that's how they sort of taken our banks away and stuff as they put some inner pole crime watch thing on me.
[49:01.560 --> 49:06.560]  Our little friends in the deep state when they're, the criminals, just, oh,
[49:06.560 --> 49:08.560]  but hey, that's the global social score.
[49:08.560 --> 49:10.560]  It's coming for all of us, man.
[49:10.560 --> 49:12.560]  We've got to say no to this.
[49:12.560 --> 49:18.560]  People say, well, I'll just roll over to it and then they'll leave me alone.
[49:18.560 --> 49:21.560]  No, then they'll get you for sure.
[49:21.560 --> 49:27.560]  We've got to have the instinct to fight back against this crap, but I'm digressing.
[49:27.560 --> 49:28.560]  Please don't show me Brennan.
[49:28.560 --> 49:31.560]  He makes me even mad at the Mueller police.
[49:31.560 --> 49:34.560]  They're such deep state jerks, man.
[49:34.560 --> 49:40.560]  Brennan was in the Communist Party and voted for the Communist twice and says he's still a communist
[49:40.560 --> 49:43.560]  and then is a Wahhabist who joined Islam.
[49:43.560 --> 49:48.560]  I mean, you imagine the type of America hater you've got to be for Obama,
[49:48.560 --> 49:51.560]  for you to be Obama's favorite person.
[49:51.560 --> 49:54.560]  What type of shit cult are these people from?
[49:54.560 --> 49:57.560]  But again, they've all got inferiority complexes.
[49:57.560 --> 50:05.560]  Obama, Brennan, Mueller, if they can dominate America and crush it.
[50:05.560 --> 50:09.560]  It's like these guys that get trophy wives and then like treat them really bad and dominate them.
[50:09.560 --> 50:10.560]  And it's like a power trip.
[50:10.560 --> 50:12.560]  How they treat their wives like such crap.
[50:12.560 --> 50:13.560]  I see it all the time.
[50:13.560 --> 50:15.560]  And it's like, you want to slap them upside the head.
[50:15.560 --> 50:17.560]  It just gets so old, man.
[50:17.560 --> 50:18.560]  Well, here's the deal.
[50:18.560 --> 50:21.560]  I'm not your bitch.
[50:21.560 --> 50:22.560]  You traitor.
[50:22.560 --> 50:24.560]  It's garbage.
[50:24.560 --> 50:27.560]  A bunch of scums strutting around acting powerful all day.
[50:27.560 --> 50:28.560]  Sick of you.
[50:28.560 --> 50:33.560]  And America will get this disease out of our bloodstream one way or another.
[50:33.560 --> 50:34.560]  Sorry, I'm digressing.
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.560]  I meant to just say, I normally don't get into the Russian thing because it's a bunch of bull.
[50:38.560 --> 50:43.560]  But lately I have because it's all coming to a big disgusting head and Roger Stone will be joining us
[50:43.560 --> 50:48.560]  because there have been some very large developments that just look at the whole battle in the deep state itself,
[50:48.560 --> 50:52.560]  not just the fake Russia story, but all the fake spying, all the crimes they've committed.
[50:52.560 --> 50:53.560]  Trump taking the gloves off.
[50:53.560 --> 50:57.560]  There's been some huge developments on that front that we'll be looking at.
[50:57.560 --> 50:59.560]  I will never testify against Trump.
[50:59.560 --> 51:05.560]  This statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue
[51:05.560 --> 51:09.560]  and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about President Trump.
[51:09.560 --> 51:12.560]  Nice to know that some people still have guts.
[51:12.560 --> 51:15.560]  That's the president today.
[51:15.560 --> 51:24.560]  And we're going to tie that into Mueller withheld details that would exonerate the president of having Kremlin back channel.
[51:24.560 --> 51:29.560]  But it's normal for a candidate to have some type of back channel if they're the nominee.
[51:29.560 --> 51:31.560]  It's not illegal, but it doesn't matter.
[51:31.560 --> 51:37.560]  They just act like if Trump even ever shakes hands with Putin, now that he's president, he's, oh my God, you saw him.
[51:37.560 --> 51:38.560]  They shook hands.
[51:38.560 --> 51:40.560]  Good God, don't let him talk alone in the room.
[51:40.560 --> 51:41.560]  It's treason.
[51:41.560 --> 51:45.560]  Trump is his own branch of government.
[51:45.560 --> 51:47.560]  He can do whatever he wants.
[51:47.560 --> 51:52.560]  And if we think it's treasonous, then we've got to have an impeachment.
[51:52.560 --> 51:55.560]  And then think, is Trump actually working against the interests of the United States?
[51:55.560 --> 51:57.560]  No, he's not.
[51:57.560 --> 52:00.560]  So that's coming up.
[52:00.560 --> 52:03.560]  But there's a bigger issue I'm going to raise next hour.
[52:03.560 --> 52:07.560]  And that's, it's all confirmed now that the interest rate hikes.
[52:07.560 --> 52:15.560]  I actually think maybe a quarter percent, half percent might have been needed because things were starting to really grow fast.
[52:15.560 --> 52:20.560]  And they've been too low for a while, but they only did that to prop up for Obama and to give the big banks their own free money.
[52:20.560 --> 52:22.560]  That money wouldn't go into the general public.
[52:22.560 --> 52:25.560]  Well, now they've had seven races.
[52:25.560 --> 52:26.560]  They're talking about five more.
[52:26.560 --> 52:28.560]  That is hurting the economy.
[52:28.560 --> 52:32.560]  And then they're talking down the economy to purposely kill it to make Trump look bad.
[52:32.560 --> 52:34.560]  And that's called economic sabotage.
[52:34.560 --> 52:36.560]  It's called warfare.
[52:36.560 --> 52:51.560]  And that ties into Macron and all of this because the French was it seven, eight years ago, raised income tax on the middle class to 101 percent.
[52:51.560 --> 52:54.560]  And you say, wait a minute, how is it 101 percent?
[52:54.560 --> 52:58.560]  It actually clawed back old money that people saved.
[52:58.560 --> 53:04.560]  But then it turned out the EU heads and the French president at the time was paying no tax and was offshore.
[53:04.560 --> 53:05.560]  You know, that's so criminal.
[53:05.560 --> 53:13.560]  That's so brutal because everyone on the inside of the French globalist club does whatever they want.
[53:13.560 --> 53:16.560]  It's just anybody else that didn't part of the club, they come after you.
[53:16.560 --> 53:21.560]  What 101 percent tax means if you aren't in the club, you're not doing business in France.
[53:21.560 --> 53:23.560]  And that's what carbon taxes are.
[53:23.560 --> 53:27.560]  These big companies get to wave them or pay them to themselves or do offsets.
[53:27.560 --> 53:29.560]  It's all scams.
[53:29.560 --> 53:33.560]  There's only four big global carbon trading groups.
[53:33.560 --> 53:41.560]  There's some sub ones, but Chicago, New York, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo.
[53:41.560 --> 53:48.560]  And these companies owned by Al Gore and the Rothschilds and others are set to make trillions of dollars.
[53:48.560 --> 53:55.560]  They have invested hundreds of billions of taxpayer money to prop it up.
[53:55.560 --> 53:59.560]  Now, there it is, Al Gore's 15 trillion carbon tax.
[53:59.560 --> 54:03.560]  That's just his proposal to Congress.
[54:03.560 --> 54:07.560]  I remember saying they won a carbon tax 15 years ago, 20 years ago, they go,
[54:07.560 --> 54:19.560]  he's insane. He claims there's a plan for a world carbon tax in an EU army. He is dangerous and anti-Semitic.
[54:19.560 --> 54:24.560]  Now they're saying Benjamin Netanyahu's criticism of George Soros is anti-Semitic.
[54:24.560 --> 54:29.560]  No, I'm not getting. I actually saw that last week.
[54:29.560 --> 54:34.560]  The guy that's anti-Israel and anti-Semitic is that evil creature, George Soros.
[54:34.560 --> 54:40.560]  By the way, when you spend $33 billion in just a few years on propaganda, you can buy a lot of people.
[54:40.560 --> 54:46.560]  Guess who you can't buy? Me.
[54:46.560 --> 54:49.560]  And by the way, people like me built civilization.
[54:49.560 --> 54:54.560]  You know, used to folks, any good civilization had some good people in it.
[54:54.560 --> 54:56.560]  Who would stand for something, you know?
[54:56.560 --> 54:58.560]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[54:58.560 --> 55:04.560]  The fact that I'm not for sale and a few other people aren't for sale.
[55:04.560 --> 55:08.560]  Like people like Matt Drudge, Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu.
[55:08.560 --> 55:11.560]  It's such a religion to attack Benjamin Netanyahu.
[55:11.560 --> 55:14.560]  But Benjamin Netanyahu stands up for his country.
[55:14.560 --> 55:20.560]  And now he and his wife are being indicted, his wife's been indicted.
[55:20.560 --> 55:29.560]  For over years, something like $100,000 is what it comes out to having the government pay for state dinners at their house.
[55:29.560 --> 55:31.560]  They don't even have a white house.
[55:31.560 --> 55:34.560]  Israel is so frugal with their government.
[55:34.560 --> 55:38.560]  They're so underscored, which I think is classy.
[55:38.560 --> 55:40.560]  You know, the uniforms, all of it.
[55:40.560 --> 55:44.560]  The architecture is very understated.
[55:44.560 --> 55:51.560]  $100,000 over, was it four years of chefs and food to have world leaders visit at his house?
[55:51.560 --> 55:53.560]  That's where they eat.
[55:53.560 --> 55:56.560]  And that's the crime is food.
[55:56.560 --> 55:59.560]  And again, I'm proud to defend Netanyahu.
[55:59.560 --> 56:01.560]  He's got his own problems.
[56:01.560 --> 56:07.560]  He's done corrupt stuff, all sorts of things in wars and deals and even worked, you know, in the fight with Syria.
[56:07.560 --> 56:08.560]  And I thought that was wrong.
[56:08.560 --> 56:11.560]  But he's under attack by the globalists.
[56:11.560 --> 56:12.560]  He's under attack by Soros.
[56:12.560 --> 56:17.560]  That means the Rothschilds because they want Israel for their grand design and they want to break it up.
[56:17.560 --> 56:22.560]  Just like they want to break up America, just like they want to break up Spain, like they want to break up Japan.
[56:22.560 --> 56:25.560]  They want to break all our countries up to dominate us.
[56:25.560 --> 56:29.560]  And I'm sick of it.
[56:29.560 --> 56:36.560]  It's evil to all the crazy people that hate Jews and make it their religion to hate them on the left and right.
[56:36.560 --> 56:39.560]  Celebrating Netanyahu or Trump getting in trouble.
[56:39.560 --> 56:40.560]  You're idiots.
[56:40.560 --> 56:47.560]  The whole evil global media combine is trying to destroy any sovereign country.
[56:47.560 --> 56:48.560]  Does that mean Putin's perfect?
[56:48.560 --> 56:56.560]  No, but I admire him because he runs this country and stands up for his own people and is going against the grain and has the whole world coming after him.
[56:56.560 --> 57:06.560]  And that's the globalist big fear is that countries like the UK and the US and Israel and Russia and Japan and South Korea who want to have open free societies,
[57:06.560 --> 57:14.560]  who want to be free market, who want to live in peace, that we work together because we'll out-produce and out-develop all the rest of these countries combined.
[57:14.560 --> 57:17.560]  And that's why we're under attack.
[57:17.560 --> 57:19.560]  And that's why they're trying to put Netanyahu in jail.
[57:19.560 --> 57:21.560]  And it's why they're trying to put me in jail.
[57:21.560 --> 57:22.560]  So they're trying to put Trump in jail.
[57:22.560 --> 57:25.560]  We're the men in the arena.
[57:25.560 --> 57:29.560]  They tried to kill Nigel Farage seven times till he just said it.
[57:29.560 --> 57:39.560]  My wife, Doug, running me off the road, cutting my brake lines, loosing my will things, trying to poison me, crashing airplanes on my ass.
[57:39.560 --> 57:40.560]  I'm done.
[57:40.560 --> 57:42.560]  You understand, folks, this is a war.
[57:42.560 --> 57:44.560]  It's a war between nations and the globalist.
[57:44.560 --> 57:45.560]  Period.
[57:45.560 --> 58:10.560]  Choose which side you're on.

[1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:20.560]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:20.560 --> 1:00:26.560]  All right, Roger's Jones coming up with huge Russian news on so many fronts. And again, it's not just Russia, that's all BS.
[1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:33.560]  But the fake investigation, the attempt to overthrow the election, the deep state war, Trump getting ready to take the gloves off, that's all very, very real.
[1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:38.560]  So that's coming up exclusively next segment.
[1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:41.560]  Trump has tweeted, you know, thank God there's still men with guts out there.
[1:00:41.560 --> 1:00:48.560]  And I tell you, I'm going to stop right there.
[1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:53.560]  You can't make this stuff up. I wish I could tell you everything I know, but I can't.
[1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:56.560]  Let me get just a few of these clips I mentioned because I talked about them.
[1:00:56.560 --> 1:01:02.560]  We'll play some of these with audio, the original one that we've got a joke on with Trump throwing an opening pitch at a baseball game.
[1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:04.560]  It's Macron getting hit in the head with an egg.
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:11.560]  And Macron is the ultimate puppet, sexually abused as a child, brainwashed. This is all in record.
[1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:19.560]  And this little doll that they put in little outfits that his wife dresses up that rolls out and then sells the country out to carbon taxes.
[1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:30.560]  He has the definition of a globalist trader flooding their country with radical jihadis, stealing people's pension funds, raising giant carbon taxes to pay the Rothschilds and Al Gore.
[1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:34.560]  I mean, we're talking an absolute piece of garbage.
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:40.560]  And now they've had three days of huge riots and it's getting crazier and crazier.
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:42.560]  And he's just on the verge of total collapse.
[1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:46.560]  So he just got in a year and a half ago. He was supposed to be the God man.
[1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:50.560]  But now, oh, he put his head down like he put his head down to mommy's breast.
[1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:53.560]  He got so scared. So let's roll this again at full speed.
[1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:56.560]  Here it is for TV viewers.
[1:01:56.560 --> 1:01:58.560]  And then we've got some of the footage of the riots going on.
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:00.560]  We can roll some of that for folks.
[1:02:00.560 --> 1:02:04.560]  Let's go ahead and roll some of that.
[1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:06.560]  They're very busy trying to get all this off the walls.
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:13.560]  This is not Islamist burning random citizens cars or raping women or burning down citizens homes.
[1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:18.560]  They were burning down government buildings and posh elite globalist shops.
[1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:24.560]  And, you know, I'm not calling for violence, but if you're going to do stuff like that, that's what you really ought to do.
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:32.560]  You don't need to burn the police cars. You need to burn the globalist cars, the bankers' cars, the liberals' cars.
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:35.560]  Somebody got a veto sticker on their car. I would never do this.
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:37.560]  I'm not saying burn their car down.
[1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:42.560]  I'm saying it's the left and the idiots that run around indiscriminately hit women on the head with bike locks.
[1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:46.560]  They're going to riot. You might as well go around it.
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:48.560]  By the way, let's roll the footage for TV viewers.
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:50.560]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:57.560]  We have the police in at least two different cases caught on video taking their helmets off and joining the yellow vested demonstrators.
[1:02:57.560 --> 1:03:04.560]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, they're talking about calling the military out, but the military is even more pissed than the police.
[1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:19.560]  So they did, you know, some show here where the police fired a few tear gas rounds after they were threatened with arrest to try to clear the square.
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:29.560]  Again, the article is on infowars.com and newswars.com where they take their helmets off in solidarity with the actual French people.
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:39.560]  Not with the 5 million illegal aliens that have been brought in who 80 plus percent of the illegal aliens brought in the last decade are on welfare in Germany and France.
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:45.560]  It's 90 percent in Sweden. Here it's only 63 percent in a new poll.
[1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:58.560]  Census confirms U.S. Census 63 percent of non-citizens on welfare, 4.6 million households, an average household being six people.
[1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:10.560]  Isn't that just darling? See, when you got here, whether it was on the Mayflower or Ellis Island in the last 400 years, that no one was shoving a silver spit in your mouth at a bunch of welfare.
[1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:16.560]  In fact, you were dodging arrows most of the time. Then everybody lionizes the Native Americans.
[1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:22.560]  If you wouldn't fight the local Native American group with the group you were with, they would kill you.
[1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:30.560]  And of course, you know, anybody who's been out west and has ancestors in the west is related Native Americans, because a lot of times your wife died.
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:34.560]  There weren't any other women around and, you know, the Native women were pretty darn nice.
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:41.560]  My whole family tree on my daddy's side is all, you know, hopped up with the Native Americans. That's a good thing.
[1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:44.560]  But I don't stand where, like, some badge of honor. I'm proud of all of my genetic background.
[1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:53.560]  But I can tell you, someone who studied history and who has got some of the most vicious Native American bloodline there is, that they were not very nice people.
[1:04:53.560 --> 1:05:05.560]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:05:24.560 --> 1:05:33.560]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email.
[1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:39.560]  So there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:47.560]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:54.560]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[1:05:54.560 --> 1:06:18.560]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[1:06:24.560 --> 1:06:53.560]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[1:06:54.560 --> 1:07:19.560]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[1:07:19.560 --> 1:07:26.560]  Guys, I apologize. I've been sitting there for a couple minutes talking to Roger Stone during the break about huge behind the scenes inside baseball.
[1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:31.560]  And I looked up and went, wow, we're a minute into the show. I apologize. I was not disregarding you in an arrogant way.
[1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:37.560]  I was just being blown away by what Roger was telling me. There's a lot to cover here.
[1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:50.560]  Trump wants rat locked up a long time. And we're going to be getting to that story from Rogerport.com. Trump wants rat locked up for a long time. That's Michael Cohen.
[1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:59.560]  But for every rat, there is the anti-rat. And we have Trump's tweet here.
[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:17.560]  I will never testify against Trump, close quote. This statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about President Trump.
[1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:26.560]  Nice to know that some people still have guts. And let me just tell the establishment something.
[1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:39.560]  Trump already pays attention to what Roger says, but let's just say he's hyper focused now. This is going to be very useful to us because you see, we're not trying to dodge your fake prison.
[1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:48.560]  We're not trying to dodge your bullets or the cars you have to try to run us off the road or any of that. We're trying to defeat you.
[1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:59.560]  And while they're busy worried about their fake Russia thing to discredit the election of two years ago, we're going to be worried about other things that are going to devastate the deep state.
[1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:06.560]  So don't think with our phones tapped, you know what's going on because you don't. All you get is this info over the phones.
[1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:21.560]  And I'm sure you idiots have already figured that out. They're traitors. But if Mueller and Hillary thought they'd give uranium to Russia and Mueller delivery legal uranium on the tarmac in Russia directly to Putin, and that you'd get away with all your secret meetings with Putin, Hillary.
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:32.560]  And you thought you'd get away with the sellout of all that. You're not getting away with it. And word is there's going to be some breaking Russian news.
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:43.560]  That's right. Putin doesn't really want to implicate himself. But I mean, that's what governments do. They buy people off. They try to get uranium stockpiles. I don't blame Russia, you know, trying to get traitors to sell us out.
[1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:51.560]  I expect the U.S. to do that to Russia. That's what countries do if you're for your interest. But there's so many wheels in motion now.
[1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:59.560]  And Trump has announced he's going to go after them for treason charges. And so everyone should just be beside themselves right now with anticipation.
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:08.560]  But Roger Stone, we also have Mueller withheld details that would exonerate the president of having Kremlin back channel. We'll get to that next segment.
[1:10:08.560 --> 1:10:14.560]  But I know you were taking a well deserved nap because you have been doing hundreds of interviews the last four or five days.
[1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:23.560]  Just got back from New York and D.C. I've been calling you all morning about the president's tweet. I guess you just woke up right before you came on 10 minutes ago and learned of the president.
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:29.560]  That's pretty cool man talking to me. I mean, but all you said was there is no Russia. There is no back channel. There is no collusion.
[1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:40.560]  So I can't lie about the president because it doesn't exist. Unlike the rat Cohen who got busted money laundering 15 million Schmoles, which he pled guilty to.
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:43.560]  And so he's not very credible, is he, Roger?
[1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:57.560]  No, he really is. And Alex, I must say that I, it's kind of overwhelming. All I did on ABC yesterday with George Stephanopoulos was to say what I've said previously, I'll never roll on Donald Trump.
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:05.560]  And what I specifically said is I will not bear false witness against him, meaning you can threaten me, whatever.
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:12.560]  I'm not going to make up lies about Donald Trump to get myself off the hook, which is what clearly Michael Cohen has done.
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:20.560]  I don't need to get off the hook. I've done nothing wrong. Cohen has done some things wrong, and that's his problem, but it has nothing to do with the president.
[1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:34.560]  And no, I'm gratified now. I have, you know, I have text messages from a number of left-wing media outlets who want to know whether the president's tweet constitutes witness tampering.
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:42.560]  I'm not a witness. I've never been contacted by Mr. Mueller or any other investigative body, so...
[1:11:42.560 --> 1:11:50.560]  Sure, they're just trying to find somebody who they can do a dragnet and find dirt for other things, and then in exchange for lying about you, they get off.
[1:11:50.560 --> 1:11:57.560]  Exactly. But the idea that this is somehow meant to change my attitude, I think my attitude is pretty clear.
[1:11:57.560 --> 1:12:12.560]  So I'm honored and gratified by the president's tweet. I like being with a president who's created 4.2 million new jobs, who's revitalizing our economy, protecting our borders, and turning this nation away from globalism.
[1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:20.560]  I'm proud to be a friend of Donald Trump's for 40 years, and I'll be happy when this nonsense is over.
[1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:30.560]  But Alex, I've got to respectfully disagree with you on one thing. The Mueller effort is not about overturning the 2016 election. It's far bigger than that.
[1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:36.560]  It's about distracting from their own treason in uranium-1.
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:55.560]  I agree. And distracting from their efforts to, in an incredible abuse of power, to use the surveillance capability and authority of the state under Fischer to spy on Donald Trump and to infiltrate his campaign with FBI operatives.
[1:12:55.560 --> 1:13:03.560]  It is a crime bigger than one or two. It is a crime. Those two crimes involve everybody who is...
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:11.560]  No, I agree with you. It's about the deep state covering for the illegal spying they did desperately, and then coming up empty, they're totally desperate now.
[1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:23.560]  And the fact the Federal Reserve is private is trying to derail the economy on top of it, and Hollywood is celebrating the economy going down. The public that I know is getting really pissed, Roger.
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:33.560]  I think people are very angry, and let's remember it. The President has the authority to move ahead on those treason prostitutions.
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:41.560]  The real question, the one that bothers me more than anything, is FBI Director Christopher Wray. Does he work for Donald Trump or does he work for Robert Mueller?
[1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:54.560]  Because these raids on the whistleblower in Uranium 1, essentially Mueller trying to grab the evidence of his own criminality as quickly as he can, who ordered that?
[1:13:54.560 --> 1:14:01.560]  And the judge who ordered it should be sanctioned because she broke the law. He was a protected whistleblower.
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:07.560]  But I would say the FBI Director has some answering to do. Who does he work for? Mueller or the President?
[1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:15.560]  And let's pull back from this. We didn't just start saying this once you're under investigation. I'm under investigation. They're having congressional hearings.
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:24.560]  Armed Services Committee saying I'm a Russian agent with no proof. Gibbon, I mean, since when do you not? A, they don't show proof. B, I'm not there. I demand to be in front of these hearings. This is unbelievable.
[1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:35.560]  Now. This was used to take us off everything. And then expanding on that, you have them with Uranium 1, you have FBI agents saying we had total proof that they killed it.
[1:14:35.560 --> 1:14:45.560]  You have Robert Mueller killing it. And you have him on the tarmac. This is just ridiculous. It's like, it's so insane, Roger. It's unbelievable. We've got to keep hammering this.
[1:14:45.560 --> 1:14:58.560]  We've been saying this for three years. Since before we were being investigated, we're the ones exposing Russian collusion, which we're specifically then blamed for because we're the ones exposing it.
[1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:09.560]  Exactly right. I wrote a very long piece on Uranium 1, the largest treasonous crime, financial crime in American history. You can see it at the enforce.com site.
[1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:24.560]  Now, the prosecutor who actually covered up the fact that the Russian energy company was bribing people to get this deal done is Rod Rosenstein. It was a sign to him. He was a cover-up man.
[1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:39.560]  His chief assistant, Aaron Zelensky, is the man running the prostitution into Roger Stone. Zelensky also worked on the Uranium 1 case. You can see the stunning conflict of interest.
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:56.560]  Roger, we have to give it a new word, beyond bravada, hubris, beyond hutzpah. Is this like hutzpah to infinity? I'm going to ask Roger the name of this new thing. We're going to coin it word when we come back. What were the actual traders?
[1:15:56.560 --> 1:16:20.560]  We're going to coin it word when we come back.

[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:55.560]  You have literal, not Russian agents
[1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:57.560]  The Clintons, Robert Mueller, all of them
[1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:00.560]  Are specialists shilling out America
[1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:04.560]  In 1955 we had 50 plus percent of the world's wealth
[1:21:04.560 --> 1:21:06.560]  We were 4% of the world's population
[1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:10.560]  4% had more wealth than the other 96%
[1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:16.560]  We had a giant middle class bigger than all their middle classes on the planet combined
[1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:19.560]  And we were exporting it to the planet
[1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:25.560]  From the days of King George III in 1775
[1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:29.560]  They had full page articles in the major British paper saying
[1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:32.560]  We cannot allow the American system to flourish
[1:21:32.560 --> 1:21:35.560]  Because if they let the commoners have land
[1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:37.560]  And then they give everybody a license
[1:21:37.560 --> 1:21:39.560]  Or not to have a license to build things
[1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:40.560]  We'll be screwed
[1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:42.560]  We won't control the colonies anymore
[1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:44.560]  Because they'll be able to make whatever they want
[1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:47.560]  Back then they had laws for the Austrian-Hungarian
[1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:48.560]  For the Spanish Empire
[1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:50.560]  For the Dutch Empire
[1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:53.560]  For the Portuguese-Fading Empire
[1:21:55.560 --> 1:22:00.560]  That you had to do complex manufacturing in the homeland
[1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:03.560]  It was punishable by prison or death
[1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:06.560]  If you tried to build a carriage
[1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:08.560]  Or a firearm in the new world
[1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:11.560]  Now why do I introduce that as Roger Stone's here?
[1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:15.560]  Because Donald Trump understands globalism
[1:22:17.560 --> 1:22:19.560]  Is a corrupt form of mercantilism
[1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:21.560]  And that it's picking winners and losers
[1:22:21.560 --> 1:22:25.560]  And that we've been shut up for failure by design to geld us
[1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:28.560]  That's a fancy way of saying castration
[1:22:28.560 --> 1:22:31.560]  Which is a fancy way of saying chop your balls off
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:34.560]  You know, your testicles
[1:22:35.560 --> 1:22:37.560]  And if you read Cecil Rhodes' book
[1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:41.560]  On the plan for world government that was adopted by traders
[1:22:41.560 --> 1:22:43.560]  In the Blue Blood East Coast
[1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:46.560]  Every time I do that, like, Jones hates the East Coast
[1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:48.560]  No, I said the Blue Blood elites
[1:22:48.560 --> 1:22:51.560]  And the British Empire that linked up with the Nazis
[1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:52.560]  Who had the EU plan
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:22:54.560]  And they're all competing for who gets control of it
[1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:56.560]  But they're all building the world government
[1:22:56.560 --> 1:22:58.560]  Wanting to be in the catbird seat
[1:22:58.560 --> 1:23:00.560]  So Roger Stone joins us exclusively
[1:23:00.560 --> 1:23:02.560]  With Trump tweeting
[1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:04.560]  Roger Stone's here to respond
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:06.560]  And Trump praising him and talking about
[1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:08.560]  Thank God he's got guts
[1:23:08.560 --> 1:23:10.560]  Donald Trump, thank God Roger Stone's got guts
[1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:12.560]  But really, is it guts?
[1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:14.560]  He's been friends with Trump 44 years
[1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:16.560]  See, plus like Roger said on the show
[1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:18.560]  I love how he said, I'm loyal
[1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:19.560]  You know, I won't say anything
[1:23:19.560 --> 1:23:20.560]  No, he didn't say, he didn't hold it up
[1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:22.560]  Like I know something because he doesn't
[1:23:22.560 --> 1:23:25.560]  He said, there's nothing
[1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:27.560]  So why would I?
[1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:29.560]  It'd be one thing if there's something most bad
[1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:31.560]  But you stuck up for your friend or yourself
[1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:33.560]  But there's nothing, I know
[1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:34.560]  I've been there
[1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:36.560]  So all you, that's what's so powerful
[1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:37.560]  What you said, Roger, is you said
[1:23:37.560 --> 1:23:39.560]  There's nothing
[1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:41.560]  And again, they couldn't get you with
[1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:43.560]  $15 million in laundered
[1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:45.560]  Money like Michael Cohen
[1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:46.560]  And his taxi cab company
[1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:48.560]  Which he's pled guilty to
[1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:50.560]  What do you make of this?
[1:23:50.560 --> 1:23:52.560]  And Trump's saying he's taking the gloves off
[1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:54.560]  Knowing Donald Trump for so long
[1:23:54.560 --> 1:23:56.560]  He's a counterpuncher
[1:23:56.560 --> 1:23:58.560]  He wouldn't say he's coming after him if he wasn't
[1:23:58.560 --> 1:24:02.560]  What are we going to see as the wrath of 45?
[1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:05.560]  Well, I think he has the detonator in his hands
[1:24:05.560 --> 1:24:07.560]  I believe that he has the documents
[1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:10.560]  That can prove that not only was there
[1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:12.560]  A willful preconceived effort
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:15.560]  To use the surveillance capability
[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:18.560]  Of the state to spy on his presidential campaign
[1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:21.560]  To use the FBI to infiltrate his campaign
[1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:25.560]  But he can show exactly who was involved
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:28.560]  And I suspect that goes all the way to the top
[1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:31.560]  Meaning President Barack Obama
[1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:33.560]  The Clintons
[1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:35.560]  He also, I'm sure, now completely understands
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:36.560]  Well, let me stop you
[1:24:36.560 --> 1:24:38.560]  We know they gave the order
[1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:40.560]  And to cover their ass earlier
[1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:43.560]  They admitted it in late 2016, early 2017
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:45.560]  Then they realized how much they'd messed up
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:48.560]  And backpedaled and said they never said it
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:51.560]  Well, Peter Struck's text message
[1:24:51.560 --> 1:24:54.560]  The rogue FBI agent, I think, makes it clear
[1:24:54.560 --> 1:24:57.560]  No, I think he has them
[1:24:57.560 --> 1:24:59.560]  And now I think he understands the implications
[1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:01.560]  Of what we really want
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:03.560]  As I said, the largest treasonous financial crime
[1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:05.560]  In American history
[1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:08.560]  The crime that Mr. Mueller and his minion
[1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:11.560]  Aaron Zelinski are moving to cover up
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:15.560]  It was Mr. Rosenstein's former top deputy
[1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:18.560]  Who suggested to Jerry Corsi
[1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:21.560]  That he adopt two completely false narratives
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:23.560]  About me
[1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:26.560]  It was Mr. Zelinski who was the chief
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:29.560]  Assistant to the man who led the cover-up
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:32.560]  Of the bribery by the Russian energy company
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:34.560]  Which was never pursued
[1:25:34.560 --> 1:25:37.560]  And now that's why they seek to bust into
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:39.560]  This whistleblower's house
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:42.560]  To try to get the evidence of their wrongdoing
[1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:45.560]  But it's too late because it's already gone
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:47.560]  To the Inspector General
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:51.560]  It's already gone to the Congress
[1:25:51.560 --> 1:25:54.560]  Now, expanding on that
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:57.560]  Clearly, for those that understand business
[1:25:57.560 --> 1:26:00.560]  You hire a lawyer in the local city that's the top guy
[1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:02.560]  Trump owns hundreds of properties in the U.S.
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:04.560]  Thousands worldwide
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:06.560]  They've raided a lawyer in Chicago, other lawyers
[1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:08.560]  They go through and see if the lawyer's done something weird
[1:26:08.560 --> 1:26:10.560]  Then they raid their office and say
[1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:12.560]  If Trump did something bad, we'll let you off
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:14.560]  And I think if they get five or six lawyers together
[1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:16.560]  Shaying Trump's a bad guy
[1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:18.560]  That'll somehow look like Trump's done something wrong
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:20.560]  But there's a separation of powers
[1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:22.560]  They still can't have a real indictment that goes anywhere
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:24.560]  I don't see people buying this
[1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:27.560]  I mean, this is extremely transparent
[1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:29.560]  No, I think it's absolutely clear
[1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:31.560]  Here, of course, is the point
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:33.560]  The American people have figured out
[1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:36.560]  That two years and $30 million into this investigation
[1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:39.560]  Mr. Mueller has no evidence of Russian collusion
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:41.560]  With the Trump campaign
[1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:43.560]  He desperately needs headlights
[1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:45.560]  Therefore, indicting Michael Cohen
[1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:47.560]  On something pertaining to Russia
[1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:50.560]  With a broad but completely false implication
[1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:53.560]  That this has some impact or involvement of the president
[1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:55.560]  Is a PR stunt
[1:26:55.560 --> 1:26:58.560]  It's kind of like the indictment of 17 Russian intelligence agents
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:01.560]  That you know you will never bring to trial
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:03.560]  And therefore it's a PR document
[1:27:03.560 --> 1:27:05.560]  And then you have people like Chris Cuomo
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:06.560]  Stating it as a fact
[1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:09.560]  Well, the Russians trapped to the DNC
[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:10.560]  No, we don't know that
[1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:11.560]  No, that is unproven
[1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:13.560]  That's supposition
[1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:14.560]  That's an allegation
[1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:15.560]  That's a charge
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:17.560]  That's an accusation
[1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:19.560]  It's not a known fact
[1:27:19.560 --> 1:27:21.560]  That has been ruled on by a federal court
[1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:23.560]  Largely because it's not true
[1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:25.560]  And they could prove it if they needed to
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:27.560]  Because as you and I both know
[1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:29.560]  It most likely did not happen that way
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:31.560]  Well, they've got to be desperate now
[1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:33.560]  Because they've come up empty
[1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:35.560]  And they're trying to kill the economy
[1:27:35.560 --> 1:27:37.560]  But that's going to blow up in their face
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:39.560]  And Trump's not backing down
[1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:41.560]  And you've done nothing wrong
[1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:42.560]  I've done nothing wrong
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:45.560]  Corsi's now not rolling over
[1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:47.560]  And making stuff up
[1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:50.560]  And they have got to be really, really scared
[1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:52.560]  But let's not be too confident
[1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:54.560]  What are their aces in the hole?
[1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:56.560]  What should we be worried about here, Roger?
[1:27:56.560 --> 1:27:58.560]  Well, I mean, look
[1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:02.560]  Mr. Mueller still and his gunsles
[1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:05.560]  Still like to pretend like they are the government
[1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:09.560]  And that they are somehow supreme
[1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:12.560]  My lawyers are tracking the prosecutorial misconduct
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:16.560]  Of the people there, Genie Ray and Mr. Zelinski
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:19.560]  They'll be prepared to make the appropriate complaint
[1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:21.560]  To the appropriate time
[1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:23.560]  And these things would all be raised
[1:28:23.560 --> 1:28:25.560]  If we ever got to a trial
[1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:28.560]  In which they brought bogus charges against me
[1:28:28.560 --> 1:28:31.560]  In an attempt to frame me or railroad me
[1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:33.560]  Because I'm a supporter of the president
[1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:36.560]  In the meantime, Alex, I have to be honest with you
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:38.560]  This is destroying me financially
[1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:40.560]  I know the hit that info wars has taken
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:42.560]  Over the concerted campaign
[1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:43.560]  I'll tell you what
[1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:45.560]  I got Stuart Rhodes popping in
[1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:46.560]  With big breaking news
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:47.560]  Only five minutes
[1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:48.560]  He's in studio tomorrow
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:50.560]  But I want to talk about
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:51.560]  Because we never really personalize
[1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:52.560]  You see, I always say
[1:28:52.560 --> 1:28:53.560]  Roger, we're going to talk about this
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:54.560]  Really talk about it
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:56.560]  So let's talk about when we come back
[1:28:56.560 --> 1:28:59.560]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic
[1:28:59.560 --> 1:29:01.560]  And only one system allows you to produce

[1:29:12.560 --> 1:29:14.560]  Simply cannot reach
[1:29:14.560 --> 1:29:15.560]  This pioneering method also preserves

[1:32:21.560 --> 1:32:23.560]  It is a classical 360 win
[1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:25.560]  This is the formula that I personally
[1:32:25.560 --> 1:32:27.560]  Have been taking for over a year
[1:32:27.560 --> 1:32:28.560]  And now we believe
[1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:30.560]  We have come as close to perfection
[1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:32.560]  When it comes to a detoxifier
[1:32:32.560 --> 1:32:33.560]  As you can possibly get
[1:32:33.560 --> 1:32:34.560]  You owe it to yourself
[1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:35.560]  You owe it to your family
[1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:37.560]  And you owe it to the future of
[1:32:37.560 --> 1:32:38.560]  This country and the world
[1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:40.560]  That Patriots stay as healthy
[1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:42.560]  And as clean and as focused as you can be
[1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:44.560]  Because we need you
[1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:45.560]  The remnant of America
[1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:47.560]  To reignite those brush fires
[1:32:47.560 --> 1:32:48.560]  The next level
[1:32:48.560 --> 1:32:50.560]  And to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:51.560]  Thanks to your support
[1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:52.560]  And your prayers together
[1:32:52.560 --> 1:32:53.560]  We're changing the world
[1:32:53.560 --> 1:32:55.560]  Now it's time to change our bodies
[1:32:55.560 --> 1:32:57.560]  With ZShield InfoWarsLife.com
[1:33:01.560 --> 1:33:04.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:04.560 --> 1:33:09.560]  We now take you live
[1:33:09.560 --> 1:33:11.560]  It's the most demonized light about
[1:33:11.560 --> 1:33:13.560]  Attack the broadcast of the world
[1:33:13.560 --> 1:33:14.560]  For good reason
[1:33:14.560 --> 1:33:15.560]  We're open to target
[1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:16.560]  Receiving this transmission
[1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:18.560]  You are the Resistance
[1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:22.560]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios
[1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:34.560]  It's Alex Jones
[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:44.560]  That's how we navigate towards the attack
[1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:46.560]  That's our sonar radar
[1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:49.560]  Each seeking guidance system
[1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:51.560]  We don't run from the war
[1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:53.560]  We run to it
[1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:54.560]  And that's why the globalists
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:56.560]  Hate our stinking guts
[1:33:56.560 --> 1:34:00.560]  Their attempt to break our will is over
[1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:02.560]  In the animating contest
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:05.560]  Whether I personally am successful or not
[1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:08.560]  Will spur others to the fight
[1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:11.560]  The globalists always misread
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:12.560]  Because they look through things
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:14.560]  From their prism, not ours
[1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:15.560]  Stuart Rose is instituted
[1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:16.560]  Amara founder of Oath Keepers
[1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:18.560]  Former Chief Stafford Ron Paul
[1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:19.560]  Great Patriot
[1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:21.560]  Army veteran
[1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:22.560]  He is going to be insidious
[1:34:22.560 --> 1:34:23.560]  But he's running a major operation
[1:34:23.560 --> 1:34:24.560]  Down on the border
[1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:27.560]  But Roger Stone, who I want to support
[1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:29.560]  I've learned how things work
[1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:31.560]  He always just throws out a little
[1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:33.560]  Oh, by the way, they're bankrupting me
[1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:34.560]  And having to know like a million
[1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:35.560]  Dollars in bills
[1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:36.560]  Of all the fake lawsuits
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:38.560]  And the congressional subpoenas
[1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:39.560]  And investigations
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:40.560]  And even get a decent lawyer
[1:34:40.560 --> 1:34:42.560]  You know, like $500 an hour
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:43.560]  It's incredible what happens
[1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:45.560]  They've spent millions the last few years
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:48.560]  Beating 15 of the 20 fake lawsuits
[1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:50.560]  So praise God that's happened
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:52.560]  But it is, I don't want to say crippling
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:56.560]  But I walk around with no Achilles
[1:34:56.560 --> 1:34:57.560]  On my right, so whatever
[1:34:57.560 --> 1:34:59.560]  People call that being crippled
[1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:02.560]  The point is, is that
[1:35:02.560 --> 1:35:04.560]  It's kind of cool having a numb leg, actually
[1:35:04.560 --> 1:35:06.560]  The point is, is that
[1:35:06.560 --> 1:35:07.560]  I said, Roger, I'm happy to do
[1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:08.560]  Fundraisers for you
[1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:09.560]  But when you do it
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:11.560]  Let's spend a minute or two on it
[1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:12.560]  And say why
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:13.560]  So you can go to
[1:35:13.560 --> 1:35:14.560]  Roger's Defense Fund
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:16.560]  We'll tell you about it in a moment
[1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:18.560]  And you can buy us books
[1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:20.560]  And things at infowarstore.com
[1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:21.560]  But it is true
[1:35:21.560 --> 1:35:23.560]  It takes a lot of money to win this war
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:26.560]  And info wars
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:28.560]  Shows t-shirts and books
[1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:29.560]  And supplements
[1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:31.560]  And normally our most expensive products
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:33.560]  Have 150% markup
[1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:34.560]  Most supplements by other people
[1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:35.560]  Have a 500 to 700
[1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:37.560]  Because after marketing
[1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:39.560]  And FDA and all the stuff
[1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:41.560]  I know why they do it
[1:35:41.560 --> 1:35:43.560]  But they put nothing in the tablets
[1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:47.560]  Or nothing in the elixirs with us
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:51.560]  It's always 30-40% off
[1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:52.560]  So you're getting basically
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:53.560]  100% markup
[1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:55.560]  And when you go 50%, 70% off
[1:35:55.560 --> 1:35:57.560]  It's a lost leader
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:35:59.560]  So we have the special right now
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:00.560]  The biggest we've ever done
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:01.560]  We're doing total clearance this year
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:03.560]  To sell everything before the new year
[1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:05.560]  So we don't get with inventory tax
[1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:06.560]  Federal and state
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:08.560]  Texas price don't have an income tax
[1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:09.560]  But if you actually run a business
[1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:11.560]  They've got a franchise tax
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:13.560]  Which is a inventory tax
[1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:15.560]  That's why you hear the car commercials
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:16.560]  If you live in Texas
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:18.560]  Where you literally do get the best deals
[1:36:18.560 --> 1:36:20.560]  In the last few weeks of January on a car
[1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:21.560]  It can be a $50,000 car
[1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:22.560]  Get it for $30,000
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:23.560]  Because they're gonna have to pay
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:25.560]  $6, $7, $8, $9, $10,000 in tax
[1:36:25.560 --> 1:36:26.560]  On that sucker
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:29.560]  So I'm selling everything
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:31.560]  You get a free shirt
[1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:33.560]  It's everyone as Alex Jones
[1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:36.560]  Don't censor me with a gas and flag
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:37.560]  Limited edition
[1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:39.560]  Freeshipping store-wide
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:41.560]  $50 to 75% off
[1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:42.560]  Double-patriot points
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:43.560]  And so much more
[1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:45.560]  InfoWarsTour.com
[1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:46.560]  Don't fight the traffic
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:47.560]  Don't fight the crowds
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:48.560]  Get great products
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:50.560]  And that's how you donate to us
[1:36:50.560 --> 1:36:51.560]  But let me tell you
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:52.560]  At this price
[1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:54.560]  This is a loss-leader with the free shirt
[1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:56.560]  Because a shirt costs us like $5
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:36:57.560]  It's a nice soft shirt
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:36:58.560]  But it's only printed on the front
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:36:59.560]  That's what's expensive
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:00.560]  So you add that to everything else
[1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:01.560]  This is a loss-leader sale
[1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:03.560]  But it spreads the word
[1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:04.560]  InfoWarsTour.com
[1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:05.560]  Thanks for all your support
[1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:07.560]  But the great supplements
[1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:10.560]  X2, X3, BrainForce

[1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:17.560]  It's going for 12 days
[1:37:17.560 --> 1:37:18.560]  There's always one special every day
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:20.560]  That's 75% off
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:22.560]  So be sure and check it out
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:23.560]  Roger, specifically
[1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:24.560]  Tell people
[1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:26.560]  I mean, just talk about it
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:27.560]  I know it makes the enemy happy
[1:37:27.560 --> 1:37:28.560]  But you, I know for a fact
[1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:29.560]  I don't just believe people
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:30.560]  I demand to see their finances
[1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:32.560]  If they're wanting raises or whatever
[1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:33.560]  Roger
[1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:34.560]  You know, has not done lobbying
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:36.560]  For almost 10 years
[1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:38.560]  He wrote books exposing the bushes
[1:37:38.560 --> 1:37:39.560]  And so much more
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:40.560]  He kind of got on the outside
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:41.560]  Of the establishment
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:42.560]  And so Roger's what?
[1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:44.560]  Got one client left in lobbying
[1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:45.560]  And he's got InfoWars
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:48.560]  And, you know, Roger has trouble
[1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:49.560]  Keeping the lights on
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:50.560]  So it is a true statement
[1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:52.560]  We don't want to hobble ourselves
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:53.560]  Or grovel here
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:55.560]  But I think if you're going to ask for money
[1:37:55.560 --> 1:37:56.560]  You might as well just tell folks
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:37:58.560]  That Robert, you're not going to break
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:00.560]  But Robert Mueller has bankrupted you
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:01.560]  Almost
[1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:02.560]  You had to move out of your house
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:03.560]  Because of death threats
[1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:04.560]  That was in the news
[1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:05.560]  So you're not having a very good day here
[1:38:05.560 --> 1:38:06.560]  How do folks donate to you, Roger?
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:09.560]  And we're going to go to the great patriot
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:10.560]  About to jump on a plane
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:12.560]  The founder of Oathkeeper Stewart Rhodes
[1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:13.560]  Go ahead, Roger
[1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:15.560]  Well, Alex, as you know
[1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:18.560]  One of the tactics of Mr. Mueller
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:20.560]  And his minions, his retno
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:22.560]  Is to try to bankrupt you
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:24.560]  That way, like General Flynn
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:25.560]  A great patriot
[1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:27.560]  When you're out of money
[1:38:27.560 --> 1:38:28.560]  When you're out of resources
[1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:30.560]  When you can no longer afford to fight
[1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:32.560]  They press you in depleting guilty
[1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:34.560]  To some process crime
[1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:35.560]  You didn't commit
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:37.560]  In my case, they hoped to bankrupt me
[1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:39.560]  And then squeeze me to testify
[1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:41.560]  Against President Donald Trump
[1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:42.560]  Michael Cohen-style
[1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:44.560]  And I'm not going to do that
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:46.560]  But I've already spent half a million
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:47.560]  Dollars in legal fees
[1:38:47.560 --> 1:38:49.560]  I'm looking at another two and a half million
[1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:51.560]  They have dried up my business
[1:38:51.560 --> 1:38:53.560]  I was looking at perhaps having
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:55.560]  One of the best years I've ever had
[1:38:55.560 --> 1:38:57.560]  Facebook had kneecapped me
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:38:59.560]  In the sale of Stone's Rules
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:02.560]  Thank God you can buy it at theinfoors.com store
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:04.560]  So folks who want to help us
[1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:06.560]  And want to make sure that the Stone's
[1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:07.560]  Have a real Christmas
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:10.560]  Can go to stonedefensefund.com
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:13.560]  I have to subsidize my own legal expenses
[1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:15.560]  If I could raise the money for these lawyers
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:18.560]  And they aren't inexpensive, as you point out
[1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:20.560]  I've got excellent lawyers
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:22.560]  They're not raping me on rates
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:24.560]  But they're still expensive
[1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:26.560]  Let's be clear
[1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:28.560]  We help reboot America
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:29.560]  We're the target
[1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:30.560]  The listeners get that
[1:39:30.560 --> 1:39:32.560]  If they can destroy us, we'll be silenced
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:34.560]  So you're doing a great job, Roger
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:36.560]  You'll be on the war room today at 3 o'clock
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:37.560]  God bless you
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:39.560]  Stonedefensefund.com, Alex
[1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:40.560]  Many thanks
[1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:42.560]  Absolutely, and I do know his finances
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:44.560]  There's nothing I don't believe, Roger
[1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:46.560]  But I wanted to see it all
[1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:48.560]  Roger had to move out of his bigger house
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:49.560]  Which was not a big house
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:51.560]  I mean, he's...
[1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:53.560]  And now that makes Mueller very, very happy
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:55.560]  He's done that and everything else
[1:39:55.560 --> 1:39:56.560]  But this is a war
[1:39:56.560 --> 1:39:57.560]  So we expect this
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:39:58.560]  We're just saying, hey
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:00.560]  We are your chess pieces in the war
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:02.560]  Do you want to fund your horses in the fight?
[1:40:02.560 --> 1:40:03.560]  And the listeners get that
[1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:04.560]  So I'm just saying, baby birds
[1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:06.560]  We need support because we're under attack
[1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:07.560]  All right, thank you for holding
[1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:09.560]  I just wanted Roger to finish that
[1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:11.560]  Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers
[1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:12.560]  Great patriot
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:13.560]  So much happening
[1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:15.560]  He's about to jump on an airplane
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:17.560]  He's got some really big, huge announcements
[1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:18.560]  He's about to make
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:19.560]  So Stuart of oathkeepers.org
[1:40:19.560 --> 1:40:21.560]  Thanks for coming on with us
[1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:23.560]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[1:40:23.560 --> 1:40:24.560]  It's good to be here
[1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:25.560]  It's good to have you
[1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:26.560]  Well, you've got some big announcements
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:27.560]  You'll be in studio tomorrow
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:29.560]  Down there with your great organization, oathkeepers
[1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:30.560]  Tell us what's happening
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:32.560]  On the Texas border and other borders
[1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:34.560]  Well, we're doing a leader's recon here
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:37.560]  I just got done doing one in California
[1:40:37.560 --> 1:40:39.560]  I sent you some pictures of...
[1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:41.560]  There's a large vacant area
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:42.560]  To the border still
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:43.560]  Despite the buildup
[1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:45.560]  This is what people don't understand
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:46.560]  Is that even with the military
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:48.560]  Going into backup border protection
[1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:49.560]  There's still not enough boots
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:50.560]  On the ground on the border
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:52.560]  Trump ultimately is going to have to call out
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:53.560]  The U.S. military in mass
[1:40:53.560 --> 1:40:55.560]  That's what's done back in the day
[1:40:55.560 --> 1:40:57.560]  When they're chasing down Poncho Villa
[1:40:57.560 --> 1:40:58.560]  So we did a border recon
[1:40:58.560 --> 1:40:59.560]  A leader recon in California
[1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:01.560]  I'm doing one now in Texas
[1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:03.560]  I'll be flying over the border today and tomorrow
[1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:06.560]  And we're going to be putting people in the air
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:08.560]  With drones and planes
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:10.560]  And also boots on the ground
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:11.560]  And all the border states
[1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:13.560]  We're doing a call out starting tomorrow
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:16.560]  For volunteers, for volunteer pilots
[1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:18.560]  And volunteer drone operators
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:20.560]  And also boots on the ground volunteers
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:21.560]  Whether they're oathkeepers or not
[1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:25.560]  If you're a patriot, sign up
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:26.560]  Now, again, as you point out
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:28.560]  A 2,300-mile border
[1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:30.560]  And it's already completely overrun
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:32.560]  Trump is trying to control it
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:34.560]  The U.N. is running this assault
[1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:35.560]  And it's going to be great
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:36.560]  You're going to be flying over the border
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:38.560]  We're going to have so much of these images
[1:41:38.560 --> 1:41:40.560]  Coming in, Stuart
[1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:42.560]  But as you point out as an Army veteran
[1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:44.560]  I mean, this whole U.N. project
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:45.560]  The mayor of Tijuana
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:47.560]  We'll talk about when we come back from break
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:48.560]  The mayor of Tijuana has said
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:49.560]  These are criminals
[1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:51.560]  The U.N. is organizing women and children
[1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:53.560]  Some of these kids are kidnapped, confirmed
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:55.560]  Arrest the leaders of the caravan
[1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:58.560]  Who are funded by George Soros
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:00.560]  Yeah, their cartels, they're notorious
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:02.560]  They're like the western hemisphere
[1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:03.560]  Version of ISIS
[1:42:03.560 --> 1:42:05.560]  They sell women and children
[1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:07.560]  The sex slavery in Mexico, as you know
[1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:09.560]  And also in the United States
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:10.560]  They're modern-day slavers
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:12.560]  And so the leftist country
[1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:13.560]  Is aiding and abetting
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:15.560]  The modern-day version of the slave trade
[1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:17.560]  That's what this really is
[1:42:17.560 --> 1:42:19.560]  They're taking over, it's a cartel state
[1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:21.560]  Who in Mexico is run by the cartels?
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:22.560]  That's who runs it
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:24.560]  It's the Lozadas
[1:42:24.560 --> 1:42:26.560]  In Texas, I think
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:28.560]  It's the dominant cartel here
[1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:29.560]  And so that's who runs this area
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:31.560]  And they're running both sides of the border now
[1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:32.560]  And of course, you know
[1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:34.560]  All the counties along the Texas border
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:35.560]  Voted blue
[1:42:35.560 --> 1:42:37.560]  That's why you had a, you know
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:38.560]  I was killing your teeth
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:40.560]  You still got a Republican senator
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:41.560]  Otherwise, you flipped
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:42.560]  It's because he legally...
[1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:44.560]  And Bito, Bito the Pito
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:46.560]  I mean, the Bito
[1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:48.560]  He got caught funding the illegal caravan
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:50.560]  This is a link up with the cartels
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:52.560]  We'll be right back with Stuart Rhodes
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:54.560]  Founder of Oathkeeper's Great Patriot
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:55.560]  To give not just his view on the border

[1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:03.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:09.560 --> 1:47:12.560]  They're intentionally leaving the borders open in Europe
[1:47:12.560 --> 1:47:13.560]  Bringing in mass refugees
[1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:15.560]  Among them are going to be jihadists
[1:47:15.560 --> 1:47:17.560]  Who are setting up a future TED offensive
[1:47:17.560 --> 1:47:20.560]  TESTVAL offensive in Europe
[1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:22.560]  And the same things being done to this country
[1:47:22.560 --> 1:47:24.560]  On her way to work one morning
[1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:27.560]  Down the path along the lake
[1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:29.560]  A tender-hearted woman
[1:47:29.560 --> 1:47:33.560]  Saw a poor half-frozen snake
[1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:35.560]  His pretty colored skin
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:38.560]  Had been all frosted with a dew
[1:47:38.560 --> 1:47:40.560]  Oh well, she cried
[1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:41.560]  I'll take you in
[1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:43.560]  And I'll take care of you
[1:47:43.560 --> 1:47:45.560]  Take me in, oh tender woman
[1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:47.560]  Take me in for heaven's sake
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:49.560]  Take me in, oh tender woman
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:53.560]  Side the vicious snake
[1:47:55.560 --> 1:47:57.560]  Take me in, oh tender woman
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:47:59.560]  Take me in for heaven's sake
[1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:01.560]  Take me in, oh tender woman
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:05.560]  Side the vicious snake
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:08.560]  Now she clutched him to her bosom
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:11.560]  You're so beautiful, she cried
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:13.560]  But if I hadn't brought you in
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:16.560]  By now, you might have died
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:19.560]  She stroked his pretty skin
[1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:22.560]  And then she kissed and held him tight
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:25.560]  But instead of saying thank you
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:30.560]  That snake gave her a vicious bite
[1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:33.560]  I saved you, cried the woman
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:36.560]  And you've bit me heavens-wide
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:39.560]  You know your bite is poisonous
[1:48:39.560 --> 1:48:42.560]  And now I'm going to die
[1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:45.560]  Oh shut up, silly woman
[1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:47.560]  Said the reptile with a grin
[1:48:47.560 --> 1:48:51.560]  You knew damn well I was a snake
[1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:53.560]  Before you took me in
[1:48:56.560 --> 1:49:00.560]  From the front lines of the Information War
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:02.560]  It's Alex Jones
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:08.560]  He's joined us, I thought I'd put an intro to Stuart Rhodes
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:12.560]  Of Oathkeepers.org, introduced that great patriot
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:14.560]  Stuart graduated, I assume he'd come along
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:16.560]  From University of Nevada, Las Vegas
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:18.560]  He worked professional sculptor in Nevada
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:20.560]  State certified, concealed carry farms
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:22.560]  Instructor after college, he worked
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:24.560]  Representative Ron Paul's office
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:26.560]  Graduated from Yale Law School in 2004
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:28.560]  Where his paper solving the puzzle
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:30.560]  Of the enemy combatant status
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:32.560]  Won Yale's Judge William E. Miller prize
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:34.560]  For best paper in the Bill of Rights
[1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:36.560]  He assisted teaching U.S. military history
[1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:38.560]  Yale's university department was a Yale research scholar
[1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:40.560]  And is now writing a book on the dangers
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:42.560]  Of applying the laws of war to the American people
[1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:44.560]  While practicing law in Montana
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:46.560]  He also serves as a volunteer fireman
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:48.560]  And he founded Oathkeepers.org
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:50.560]  Which is a great patriotic group
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:52.560]  So in the eight minutes we have left
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:54.560]  You've got the floor, tell us about the big announcements
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:56.560]  What's happening, your battle space view
[1:49:56.560 --> 1:49:58.560]  On what Trump's doing, where we're at
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:00.560]  The treason of the Federal Reserve
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:02.560]  Trying to plunge the economy openly
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:04.560]  I mean this is so obvious
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:06.560]  The view, Stuart
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:08.560]  Well, we're running out of time
[1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:10.560]  We're running the clock out on Trump
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:12.560]  And so what's going to have to happen
[1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:14.560]  We have a small window where the Republican party
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:16.560]  We still fund the border wall
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:18.560]  But we know they won't, we should push them
[1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:20.560]  But what Trump's going to have to do after that
[1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:22.560]  Is that no funding is going to come out of the House
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:24.560]  Representatives, he's going to have to put the troops
[1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:26.560]  On the border and build the wall
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:28.560]  Using the DOD resources
[1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:30.560]  And we did it in Korea, we still man
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:32.560]  A massive border in Korea successfully
[1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:34.560]  In South Korea, we can do it here
[1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:36.560]  So we want to push Trump to do the right thing
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:38.560]  Using the military as commander in chief
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:40.560]  This is what it's going to take
[1:50:40.560 --> 1:50:42.560]  Well you've been saying that for a few years
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:44.560]  He's now saying it's not a wall we need
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:46.560]  We need that too with Constantinowire
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:48.560]  It's better than a wall, right
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:50.560]  What we need is troops
[1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:52.560]  We do, we need troops and a wall
[1:50:52.560 --> 1:50:54.560]  The wall they've got planned
[1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:56.560]  A 15 foot wall would be great
[1:50:56.560 --> 1:50:58.560]  Or a 30 foot wall would be awesome
[1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:00.560]  Right now
[1:51:00.560 --> 1:51:02.560]  If you want that cheaper and better
[1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:04.560]  Say four layers of it
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:06.560]  If people chew through it, you just repair it
[1:51:06.560 --> 1:51:08.560]  It can be cut, it can be cut
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:10.560]  Any infantry guy will tell you
[1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:12.560]  Unless you monitor the barrier
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:14.560]  It can be circumvented, including the wall
[1:51:14.560 --> 1:51:16.560]  So it takes both, it takes barriers
[1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:18.560]  It takes the troops, it takes sensors
[1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:20.560]  It takes guys in helicopters as a QRS
[1:51:20.560 --> 1:51:22.560]  It takes a road right behind the walls
[1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:24.560]  They have in California, that's been done right
[1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:26.560]  And now the UN has openly declared war
[1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:28.560]  On borders with these new treaties
[1:51:28.560 --> 1:51:30.560]  This is for all the marbles
[1:51:30.560 --> 1:51:32.560]  This is for the survival of our nation
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:34.560]  That's why, you know, we're going to do
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:36.560]  We have to do to at least
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:38.560]  Show our support for the president
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:40.560]  To encourage him to go further
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:42.560]  And the American people have got to rise up
[1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:44.560]  And demand and put boots on the ground
[1:51:44.560 --> 1:51:46.560]  With their own, their own
[1:51:46.560 --> 1:51:48.560]  By the way, I trust you and Oathkeepers
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:50.560]  Really smart guys to be down there
[1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:52.560]  Eyes and ears, but what about
[1:51:52.560 --> 1:51:54.560]  Southern Property Law Center ADL infiltrators
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:56.560]  Posing as militia
[1:51:56.560 --> 1:51:58.560]  Engaged in some sort of, you know,
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:00.560]  Criminal event to, to, to
[1:52:00.560 --> 1:52:02.560]  To fame Trump, to fame Oathkeepers
[1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:04.560]  You've got to be worried about that
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:06.560]  Well sure, we'll hold that people
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:08.560]  I mean, we're going to rely heavily on air
[1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:10.560]  Our big game changer is
[1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:12.560]  Volunteer Pilots, we already got Volunteer Pilots
[1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:14.560]  Stacked up to go out and fly over the border
[1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:16.560]  That's where you have
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:18.560]  The best
[1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:20.560]  Use of resources is to put pilots in the air
[1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:22.560]  To spot a port for board
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:24.560]  Patrol from the air
[1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:26.560]  And then we'll have our select guys
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:28.560]  Guys who are most experienced
[1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:30.560]  Boots on the ground
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:32.560]  So if someone's a volunteer, they've got the right background
[1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:34.560]  Either infantry or police officer
[1:52:34.560 --> 1:52:36.560]  Will heavily vet them
[1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:38.560]  And only when they're vetted will they be assigned on a border ranch
[1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:40.560]  Otherwise, no
[1:52:40.560 --> 1:52:42.560]  Can you believe though
[1:52:42.560 --> 1:52:44.560]  Everything you and I talked about decades ago
[1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:46.560]  Is now mainstream? They don't even debate us
[1:52:46.560 --> 1:52:48.560]  About world government or trying to overthrow our borders
[1:52:48.560 --> 1:52:50.560]  It's now just like out in the open
[1:52:50.560 --> 1:52:52.560]  Yep, it's a cloud tripping strategy
[1:52:52.560 --> 1:52:54.560]  The cloud tripping strategy applied
[1:52:54.560 --> 1:52:56.560]  As we saw in Europe as being done right now
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:52:58.560]  To be applied here
[1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:00.560]  To swamp us with the third world
[1:53:00.560 --> 1:53:02.560]  And transform our nation
[1:53:02.560 --> 1:53:04.560]  And steal electoral power permanently
[1:53:04.560 --> 1:53:06.560]  They'll be able to limit power
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:08.560]  Taken by the Democratic Party
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:10.560]  As a permanent block on power
[1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:12.560]  That's what they want
[1:53:12.560 --> 1:53:14.560]  So to stop it though, we have to get behind the president
[1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:16.560]  And I think it's going to take up boots on the ground
[1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:18.560]  To say, look, this is not enough
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:20.560]  It's a good start
[1:53:20.560 --> 1:53:22.560]  This is backing up the border patrol agents
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:24.560]  On the tech points, on the crossing points
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:26.560]  In between, they're not out there
[1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:28.560]  I've seen it
[1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:30.560]  Let me ask you this though, with all your sources
[1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:32.560]  We have a lot of sources obviously down there with us
[1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:34.560]  We've had Greg Reese and some unnamed reporters
[1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:36.560]  For their safety in Mexico
[1:53:36.560 --> 1:53:38.560]  For two weeks
[1:53:38.560 --> 1:53:40.560]  And the Mexicans finally got mad and made
[1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:42.560]  The six or seven thousand go to a sports stadium
[1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:44.560]  Forty miles south of Tijuana
[1:53:44.560 --> 1:53:46.560]  They are now deporting hundreds a day
[1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:48.560]  And are really starting to put the screws to them
[1:53:48.560 --> 1:53:50.560]  To not let the rest of the caravan get up there
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:52.560]  Because they get, for their own country
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:54.560]  How out of control it is to breach their own southern border
[1:53:54.560 --> 1:53:56.560]  With Guatemala and Honduras
[1:53:56.560 --> 1:54:00.560]  But again, Soros isn't going to stop
[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:02.560]  What about what Lou Dobbs said
[1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:04.560]  Or the Tijuana mayor said
[1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:06.560]  He said, arrest these NGOs
[1:54:06.560 --> 1:54:08.560]  They're smuggling kids, man
[1:54:08.560 --> 1:54:10.560]  This is total illegal border crossing
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:12.560]  So the Mexicans, even the
[1:54:12.560 --> 1:54:14.560]  The federalis are saying
[1:54:14.560 --> 1:54:16.560]  It's time to arrest these
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:18.560]  Organizers out of Chicago
[1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:20.560]  Absolutely, I mean, they're all guilty
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:22.560]  That there's a federal statute against
[1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:24.560]  Eating and abetting illegal aliens
[1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:26.560]  It's a federal felony
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:28.560]  So I don't understand why it's not happening right now
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:30.560]  But what should be happening is arrest
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:32.560]  And prosecution, absolutely
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:34.560]  And your constitutional lawyer, well
[1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:36.560]  Trump gives the orders, we now know
[1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:38.560]  And they don't follow him, so this is mutiny
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:40.560]  I mean, the low level people are all great
[1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:42.560]  But it's the bureaucrats, the lawyers
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:44.560]  Aren't following the president
[1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:46.560]  He needs a clean house
[1:54:46.560 --> 1:54:48.560]  He needs to train that swamp first
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:50.560]  You can't train the rest of it unless you have a prosecutorial
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:52.560]  Team that'll do your work
[1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:54.560]  Otherwise, you're dead in the water
[1:54:54.560 --> 1:54:56.560]  So he's got to train that swamp first
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:54:58.560]  But meanwhile, he should put the military on the border
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:00.560]  As we do with Pershing
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:02.560]  Pershing did an expedition, a predatory expedition
[1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:04.560]  Into Mexico, chased down Poncho Villa
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:06.560]  And that was all done by the president of the United States
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:08.560]  As a commander in chief of the nation
[1:55:08.560 --> 1:55:10.560]  And Trump could do the exact same thing
[1:55:10.560 --> 1:55:12.560]  And they always, I mean, Mexico has control
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:14.560]  Of its other border, or it's trying to
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:16.560]  If the UN can break our border, it's over
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:18.560]  And it's not like you're here from some position
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:20.560]  Of hating Mexicans, I mean, your mom is from Mexico
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:22.560]  Well, no, my grandfather
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:24.560]  Grandfather, my great grandfather
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:26.560]  That's right
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:28.560]  Yeah, that's not a racial issue, it's about assimilation
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:30.560]  My family is assimilated, and someone can assimilate
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:32.560]  And the numbers that can be assimilated, great
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:34.560]  But they're coming here, you know
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:36.560]  They're flying the Honduran flag with the next
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:38.560]  American flag, I don't want them here
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:40.560]  So if you're not going to assimilate
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:42.560]  They're coming here under UN control
[1:55:42.560 --> 1:55:44.560]  To break us
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:48.560]  Right, they're coming here as a
[1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:50.560]  Four-generation warfare force multiplier
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:52.560]  For the globalists, it's a military
[1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:54.560]  And political, it's a military invasion
[1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:56.560]  And a political coup, by the left
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:55:58.560]  In this country, and by the globalists
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:00.560]  So, you know, we got to stand up and oppose it
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:02.560]  I don't care where they come from
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:04.560]  If they're coming here for those purposes, I don't want them here
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:06.560]  Well, clearly they've escalated
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:08.560]  And now they use Antifa as their decoys
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:10.560]  To laze conservative and nationalist
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:12.560]  And patriot targets, as you predicted
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:14.560]  I've confirmed my own self
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:16.560]  But also from really smart sources
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:18.560]  That the left has a backup plan
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:20.560]  If they can't stop Trump, they are planning
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:22.560]  National assassination
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:24.560]  Basically, day
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:26.560]  Coming up in the future
[1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:28.560]  That's why everybody who is a major
[1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:30.560]  Patriot leader should know
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:32.560]  This is maximum alert time right now
[1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:34.560]  Stuart, do you want to comment to that information?
[1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:36.560]  Absolutely, and in fact, we'll be at
[1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:38.560]  Upcoming hearing in DC
[1:56:38.560 --> 1:56:40.560]  We're going to be there to counter Antifa
[1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:42.560]  I'm sending some of my best retired police officers
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:44.560]  And infantry veterans there
[1:56:44.560 --> 1:56:46.560]  Just in case
[1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:48.560]  Because that's what's going to happen
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:50.560]  Eventually they'll go kinetic
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:52.560]  I think they will
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:54.560]  But they said they are, because they're losing
[1:56:54.560 --> 1:56:56.560]  StuartRoads, oathkeepers.org
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:56:58.560]  Big announcements coming soon
[1:56:58.560 --> 1:57:00.560]  You're going to be in the studio with us tomorrow, right?
[1:57:00.560 --> 1:57:02.560]  Absolutely, look forward to it
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:04.560]  All right, Stuart, oathkeepers.org
[1:57:04.560 --> 1:57:06.560]  You too, countless, thank you
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:08.560]  All right, we're going to come back
[1:57:10.560 --> 1:57:12.560]  And we've got
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:14.560]  A full hour to take your phone calls
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:18.560]  I did something last night on the Sunday show
[1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:20.560]  That I thought was a good idea
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:22.560]  We have digital lines
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:24.560]  So potentially we can take thousands of calls
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:26.560]  We got 24,000 calls one time in two hours
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:28.560]  A lot of folks calling back and back
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:32.560]  But I don't want to make you sit on hold
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:34.560]  So what we're going to do is
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:36.560]  We'll just take the first ten
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:38.560]  Get them up there
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:40.560]  And then not take more calls till they're gone
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:42.560]  So you don't sit on hold
[1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:44.560]  So open phones and a ton of news
[1:57:44.560 --> 1:58:05.560]  And we'll see you in the next one
[1:58:05.560 --> 1:58:29.560]  So go to infowarstore.com and get SuperMailVitality
[1:58:29.560 --> 1:58:35.560]  Before it's gone, this is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality

[1:59:33.560 --> 1:59:37.560]  Our best seller, BrainForce Plus, now 55% off
[1:59:37.560 --> 1:59:40.560]  The 2018 has been an incredible year
[1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:44.560]  And as we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again for making the entire info war possible
[1:59:44.560 --> 2:00:11.560]  And again, you are the resistance
[2:00:11.560 --> 2:00:14.560]  Here's a smith for infowars.com
[2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:19.560]  We know that social media often deletes people or content based on arbitrary metrics
[2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:22.560]  And vague sort of enforcement rules
[2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:29.560]  But what would it be like to have your constitutional rights, your God given rights, subject to the same sort of arbitrary enforcement
[2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:33.560]  Well that would in effect be the purpose of the bill
[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:39.560]  Recently put forward for a vote in the New York State Senate by New York State Senator Kevin S. Parker
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:44.560]  He calls for the Second Amendment, for the right to own guns, to be limited
[2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:53.560]  And to be subject to a review of your social media and your search engine history for the past three years
[2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:58.560]  The government will go in and look at your search engine history and your social media posts
[2:00:58.560 --> 2:01:06.560]  Looking for, quote, commonly used profane slurs or bias language used to describe the race, color, national origin, ancestry
[2:01:06.560 --> 2:01:12.560]  Gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability, or sexual orientation of a person
[2:01:12.560 --> 2:01:21.560]  Folks, this is the slow creeping death knell of totalitarianism
[2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:27.560]  This is Chinese style social censorship getting its foot in the door in America
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:35.560]  Of course they would do it in New York State in a very liberal place to try to set the precedent that they can expand out to the rest of America
[2:01:35.560 --> 2:01:39.560]  Folks, this is insane, this is outrageous
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:46.560]  The fact that your free speech, your search engine results, and your social media posts, and not just the public posts
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:55.560]  This bill actually calls for you having to turn over your username and password to the police in order to qualify for owning a gun
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:01:58.560]  For exercising the Second Amendment
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:03.560]  And don't stop, don't think for a second that they're going to restrict it to the Second Amendment
[2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:17.560]  They get this passed, if this succeeds, it will be very short order before they're subjecting every right we have as Americans to the arbitrary oversight of some sort of government bureaucracy
[2:02:17.560 --> 2:02:23.560]  Who can go in and say, I don't like the tone this person used, I don't like the news this person read, I don't like the way this person talked about these other people
[2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:28.560]  He's not going to be able to exercise his God given rights
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:35.560]  This is absolutely ridiculous, ridiculous, outrageous, it should be infuriating
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:43.560]  If you know anything about the course of history and about what happens when you allow to talitarians to get bills like this passed
[2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:50.560]  And put a nice little spin on it and say, well, we've had these massacres and the people, you know, they posted on social media beforehand
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:57.560]  So, you know, maybe we need to review people's social media to decide whether or not they're worthy of exercising their right to bear arms
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:02.560]  There's a reason that the founding fathers use the phrase, shall not be infringed
[2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:09.560]  They knew that the right to bear arms would not be destroyed all at once, it will be infringed slowly but surely nibbled away at
[2:03:09.560 --> 2:03:14.560]  Until we wake up one day to find that we are completely defenseless in the face of a totalitarian government
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:22.560]  That is exactly what's happening here and they're starting it at this spot right here at Kevin S. Parker's office in Brooklyn, New York
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:31.560]  Folks, we know how they do things. We know that if you criticize George Soros, they'll call you anti-Semitic
[2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:37.560]  We know that if you just talk about Alex Jones, you risk having your video or your account banned
[2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:46.560]  Well, very soon, it's not hard to foresee a time when criticizing people like George Soros or the Rothschilds will be called anti-Semitism
[2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:55.560]  And be grounds for you not being able to exercise your rights. Not even China is at that level yet, yet that is the purpose of this bill
[2:03:55.560 --> 2:04:02.560]  Put forward by Kevin S. Parker of Brooklyn, New York
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:07.560]  And again, they're not making a big deal out of this, they're not doing this in a conservative state
[2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:12.560]  They're doing this in a liberal state where they hope that people are too dumbed down and too unconnected and too unaware
[2:04:12.560 --> 2:04:16.560]  They aren't going to realize that this is happening, they're going to pass it quietly
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:22.560]  And by doing that, they're going to set the president that they can then expand to all other states and to all other rights
[2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:25.560]  Guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution
[2:04:25.560 --> 2:04:32.560]  This is outrageous, this is ridiculous, this should, as I say, be infuriating to each and every one of you
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:37.560]  Folks, call your congressman, call your senators, call your state senators and your state legislature
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:43.560]  And make it known that this is unacceptable and that this will not stand
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:46.560]  For Infowars.com, this has been Harrison Smith
[2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:50.560]  Powerful info, it's George Soros that's anti-Israeli anti-Semitic
[2:04:50.560 --> 2:04:55.560]  Larry Klayman joins us with huge news in one minute, stay with us
[2:04:55.560 --> 2:05:01.560]  In the last few months, Infowars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items
[2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:08.560]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off double-patriot points
[2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:14.560]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order
[2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:18.560]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:23.560]  You'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last
[2:05:23.560 --> 2:05:27.560]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out
[2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:32.560]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out
[2:05:32.560 --> 2:05:35.560]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders
[2:05:35.560 --> 2:05:40.560]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had
[2:05:40.560 --> 2:05:43.560]  So this is a loss leader, we are losing money on this
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:47.560]  This is our biggest sale ever, get your free gift, your free shipping, everything
[2:05:47.560 --> 2:05:53.560]  And don't fight the crowds, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or triple-8253-3139
[2:05:53.560 --> 2:05:57.560]  God bless you and thank you for your support
[2:06:24.560 --> 2:06:26.560]  There's one segment, let me give the number out and take your calls
[2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:32.560]  Larry Klayman is representing, formerInfoWars.com, reporter, Dr. Jerome Corsi
[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:36.560]  Corsi goes to war, prosecute Miller, staff for criminal acts
[2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:40.560]  I'm no lawyer, but when you tell somebody, say this, they're going to go to jail
[2:06:40.560 --> 2:06:41.560]  And it's not true, that's criminal
[2:06:41.560 --> 2:06:45.560]  Conservative writer, Corsi, files criminal complaint against Mueller
[2:06:45.560 --> 2:06:48.560]  Alleges bid to seek false testimony, and then there's this
[2:06:48.560 --> 2:06:51.560]  Here's Trump's tweet from earlier today, we had Roger Stone on earlier
[2:06:51.560 --> 2:06:55.560]  I will never testify against Trump, this statement was recently made by Roger Stone
[2:06:55.560 --> 2:07:00.560]  Essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor
[2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:04.560]  Who thinks he's God to make up lies and stories about President Trump
[2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:07.560]  Nice to know that some people still have guts
[2:07:07.560 --> 2:07:10.560]  So joining us is Larry Klayman, thanks for coming on on short notice
[2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:13.560]  This is a big deal, tell us what's happening
[2:07:13.560 --> 2:07:18.560]  Alex, I appreciate you too, you have guts, there are very few of us anymore than do
[2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:24.560]  But this is a very important case, because I have now filed a complaint on behalf of Dr. Corsi
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:28.560]  With Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker
[2:07:28.560 --> 2:07:33.560]  With the US Attorney in the District of Columbia, with the Criminal Division of the Justice Department
[2:07:33.560 --> 2:07:37.560]  With the Office of Professional Responsibility Inspector General
[2:07:37.560 --> 2:07:40.560]  And with the DC Bars Disciplinary Council
[2:07:40.560 --> 2:07:44.560]  It would be interesting to see what they do, because they're run by leftists who've donated heavily
[2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:49.560]  To various Democrat campaigns, but we have a real shot at the Justice Department
[2:07:49.560 --> 2:07:54.560]  To get an investigation, of course it's under the control of Matthew Whitaker now
[2:07:54.560 --> 2:07:59.560]  And we're asking that Mueller and his staff, the ones that were involved, Jeannie Rhee
[2:07:59.560 --> 2:08:03.560]  Aaron Zelinski, Mark Goldstein and one other
[2:08:03.560 --> 2:08:07.560]  Be investigated, that it be referred for criminal prosecution
[2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:12.560]  And that in the end they'd be disbarred, they should not be allowed to practice law anymore
[2:08:12.560 --> 2:08:17.560]  And to have a new special counsel appointed, one who is honorable, who's honest
[2:08:17.560 --> 2:08:19.560]  Who isn't partisan
[2:08:19.560 --> 2:08:23.560]  Well, most listeners know that it tells, but they're so voluminous, it's hard to...
[2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:24.560]  There's so many
[2:08:24.560 --> 2:08:28.560]  Go over like Tarmac meetings in Hillary and Uranium One
[2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:32.560]  And then Jeannie Rhee's involved in covering up, and the other lawyers are
[2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:36.560]  It's like if there was a Nuremberg trial and Hitler was the judge against the Nazis
[2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:39.560]  I mean, that's how crazy this is
[2:08:39.560 --> 2:08:42.560]  Well, it's... Yeah, crazy is a nice way of putting it
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:44.560]  You're being very polite, Alex
[2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:46.560]  It's criminal, that's what it is
[2:08:46.560 --> 2:08:50.560]  This is an attempted coup d'etat against the President of the United States
[2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:56.560]  Anybody that gets caught in between, such as Dr. Corsi or Roger Stone or others
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:08:59.560]  Are destroyed unless they're going to testify falsely
[2:08:59.560 --> 2:09:02.560]  And with regard to Dr. Corsi, I don't represent Roger Stone
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:08.560]  But these people are being backed up against the wall, backed into a corner
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:11.560]  And either they lie or they get indicted
[2:09:11.560 --> 2:09:13.560]  And obviously this isn't going to stand
[2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:18.560]  Dr. Corsi had been offered what the special counsel called a sweetheart plea deal
[2:09:18.560 --> 2:09:23.560]  And he had the courage and he had the temerity to reject that
[2:09:23.560 --> 2:09:29.560]  He is now going up against the most powerful Justice Department person in the United States
[2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:31.560]  And perhaps of all time
[2:09:31.560 --> 2:09:35.560]  And I just hope that the law and ethics prevail
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:38.560]  So I'm going to do everything I can to protect him
[2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:41.560]  It would be very unwise for Mueller to indict him
[2:09:41.560 --> 2:09:44.560]  That would give me the opportunity, which the President should have done long ago
[2:09:44.560 --> 2:09:47.560]  But unfortunately, he has lawyers that I think have given him bad advice
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:50.560]  To challenge Mueller's mandate and authority
[2:09:50.560 --> 2:09:53.560]  Well, that was my next question, because you're a smart constitutional lawyer
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:09:56.560]  How do they act like Mueller's God?
[2:09:56.560 --> 2:09:58.560]  And he can do whatever he wants and it goes on forever
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:01.560]  And he was seeing it and it means he breaks all the rules
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:05.560]  And then there's no Russia gay and it just goes on year after year
[2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:10.560]  And then the President, who's a separate branch of government, has to answer to him
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:14.560]  I mean, what is going on here?
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:20.560]  What's going on here is that the world has turned into a war by the left against the right
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:23.560]  You know that, you've been a victim of that, okay?
[2:10:23.560 --> 2:10:25.560]  I have to deal with it on a daily basis as well
[2:10:25.560 --> 2:10:29.560]  Everybody does, he's a conservative who speaks out, who takes positions
[2:10:29.560 --> 2:10:31.560]  Is that they want to destroy all of us
[2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:34.560]  And of course, the President is the number one guy they want to destroy
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:35.560]  So how do you do that?
[2:10:35.560 --> 2:10:41.560]  You go to people like Corsi and Stone and you get them to testify falsely
[2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:42.560]  That's the way it works
[2:10:42.560 --> 2:10:43.560]  And Mueller is out of control
[2:10:43.560 --> 2:10:47.560]  You know, there's this big argument that Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general
[2:10:47.560 --> 2:10:49.560]  Should have been confirmed by the Senate
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:52.560]  Well, Mueller should have been confirmed by the Senate, constitutionally
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:53.560]  He has no authority
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:55.560]  So should...
[2:10:55.560 --> 2:10:57.560]  That's a really good point
[2:10:57.560 --> 2:10:59.560]  I saw you make that on the war room the other day
[2:10:59.560 --> 2:11:01.560]  He's not been confirmed
[2:11:01.560 --> 2:11:05.560]  And they literally fall down and worship this man
[2:11:05.560 --> 2:11:08.560]  With this huge history of corruption
[2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:11.560]  Talk about acting as an attorney general without being confirmed
[2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:12.560]  That's Robert Mueller
[2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:17.560]  And of course, he had this hack, Rod Rosenstein rubber stamp everything he wanted
[2:11:17.560 --> 2:11:23.560]  And just the other day with regard to the indictment of Cohen, of Michael Cohen
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:28.560]  Mueller went to Rosenstein before he went to the person who's in charge, Whitaker
[2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:31.560]  And Rosenstein has no authority anymore on this
[2:11:31.560 --> 2:11:32.560]  He's been taking off of it
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:33.560]  So that tells you everything
[2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:37.560]  They're going to their guys that want to destroy this President
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:44.560]  And clearly, they're rating lawyers that have nothing to do with Russia
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:47.560]  Trying to find some dirt on them
[2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:50.560]  If you were Trump, because I know Trump pays attention to this broadcast
[2:11:50.560 --> 2:11:52.560]  And I see OAN behind you, pays attention to that
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:56.560]  And you know, the trickle up, you know, Fox listens to us
[2:11:56.560 --> 2:11:59.560]  What would you do if you were the President right now?
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:01.560]  Because this country is in clear and present danger
[2:12:01.560 --> 2:12:04.560]  You have Mueller and you have Hillary involved with the Russians
[2:12:04.560 --> 2:12:06.560]  And trying to blame everybody else
[2:12:06.560 --> 2:12:10.560]  What would you do when they're trying to overthrow an election, trying to do this?
[2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:13.560]  I mean, at some point it becomes a dereliction of duty
[2:12:13.560 --> 2:12:14.560]  Here's what I'm saying
[2:12:14.560 --> 2:12:16.560]  The President tweeted last Monday
[2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:18.560]  That he's getting ready to take the gloves off, there should be treason trials
[2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:21.560]  Then he said, I've got all the proof of your crimes
[2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:25.560]  Which we know they've got the NSA's got Hillary's 35,000 emails
[2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:27.560]  We know that they've got all the dirt
[2:12:27.560 --> 2:12:32.560]  We know they have the illegal information that they put out the lies to get the FISA warrant
[2:12:32.560 --> 2:12:34.560]  So the President's letting them know he has this
[2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:36.560]  I don't want to second-guess him, he's a really smart guy
[2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:39.560]  But shouldn't he just drop the bombs now?
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:42.560]  He should, Alex, we've been saying that all along
[2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:44.560]  Three things he should do, primarily
[2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:46.560]  Number one, he is the head of the Justice Department
[2:12:46.560 --> 2:12:48.560]  He's the head of the executive branch
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:50.560]  He can't tell the Justice Department to indict people
[2:12:50.560 --> 2:12:52.560]  But he can tell them to investigate
[2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:54.560]  And he can order an investigation
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:57.560]  And he can himself order a special counsel
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:12:58.560]  He should do that
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:01.560]  Number two, he should challenge Mueller's authority
[2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:03.560]  And take it all the way up to the Supreme Court
[2:13:03.560 --> 2:13:04.560]  He has a great shot to do that
[2:13:04.560 --> 2:13:06.560]  He's President of the United States
[2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:10.560]  Number three, he should be bringing lawsuits as I did against the NSA
[2:13:10.560 --> 2:13:12.560]  You made reference to that earlier
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:16.560]  The CIA, the FBI for the illegal surveillance of the Trump Tower
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:19.560]  Himself, his family, and his colleagues
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:20.560]  He should fight back
[2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:22.560]  But he's been getting this bad advice from his lawyers
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:24.560]  Who are telling him, like court gestures
[2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:26.560]  Everything's going to be okay
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:28.560]  They're telling the king, don't worry about it
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:30.560]  And what they're really doing is covering their ass
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:34.560]  So they don't get doubted by Mueller on taxes they didn't pay
[2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:35.560]  Well, it could be
[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:36.560]  Who knows what Mueller's got?
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:39.560]  Look, there's surveillance on everybody
[2:13:39.560 --> 2:13:40.560]  Alex, we know that
[2:13:40.560 --> 2:13:43.560]  And if they want to get the lawyers
[2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:46.560]  Or they want to get this person or that person
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:50.560]  You know, they will do it and they'll manufacture claims to use against them
[2:13:50.560 --> 2:13:52.560]  We can see that with Dr. Corsi
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:54.560]  So this is the world we live in today
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:13:56.560]  It's them versus us
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:13:59.560]  We're trying to fight back peacefully and legally
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:02.560]  Well, I agree, but the courage it takes for you
[2:14:02.560 --> 2:14:05.560]  Who's like the perennial guy of courage
[2:14:05.560 --> 2:14:06.560]  I'm not just saying it's true
[2:14:06.560 --> 2:14:08.560]  You're always, I've been on there 20-something years
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:10.560]  It's always you at the center of the fight
[2:14:10.560 --> 2:14:11.560]  I bless you
[2:14:11.560 --> 2:14:12.560]  And Corsi's a great guy as well
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:14.560]  I don't get into current client privilege
[2:14:14.560 --> 2:14:16.560]  In the last minute and a half
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:19.560]  The conversation, you're deciding to go ahead and do the criminal complaint
[2:14:19.560 --> 2:14:22.560]  Even if it goes nowhere, it's standing up against the tyrant
[2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:24.560]  It's saying, you're a fraud, I know you are
[2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:26.560]  It's not groveling
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:28.560]  Well, and we'll also take it to court
[2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:30.560]  To seek to have it enforced if they do nothing
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:33.560]  And I hope the people will go to Dr. Corsi's website
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:36.560]  I'm representing him in my private capacity here
[2:14:36.560 --> 2:14:39.560]  The CorsiNation.com and donate to his defense fund
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:42.560]  Because he's really standing up, not just for himself, but for everybody
[2:14:42.560 --> 2:14:44.560]  And this is the one chance that we have
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:46.560]  To take Mueller down legally
[2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:48.560]  Well, I mean, I've gotten mad at him
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:50.560]  Just because someone with his recollections aren't mine
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:52.560]  But overall, he's saying the same thing
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:54.560]  And I really admire Corsi overall
[2:14:54.560 --> 2:14:58.560]  But yeah, the craziness of them openly telling him to lie
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:14:59.560]  Or he'll go to prison
[2:14:59.560 --> 2:15:03.560]  This is just the bravada, the hutzpah, the arrogance
[2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:05.560]  What do you call this word?
[2:15:05.560 --> 2:15:09.560]  Yeah, well, hutzpah's a nice way of saying it again, Alex
[2:15:09.560 --> 2:15:10.560]  Again, being diplomat
[2:15:10.560 --> 2:15:11.560]  Criminality
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:15.560]  And what they also said, Genie retold him to keep the plea agreement confidential
[2:15:15.560 --> 2:15:16.560]  And he can't do that
[2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:17.560]  He's a securities dealer
[2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:20.560]  If he had pled to one account for a felony violation
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:21.560]  He would have to report it
[2:15:21.560 --> 2:15:24.560]  So that was another crime committed by the special counsel's office
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:28.560]  To keep that information away from federal regulators for securities
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:31.560]  No, but you said it
[2:15:31.560 --> 2:15:35.560]  It's wild-eyed, megalomaniac criminality
[2:15:35.560 --> 2:15:36.560]  Well, it is
[2:15:36.560 --> 2:15:40.560]  And this is what we've come to as a nation
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:44.560]  And this is why I'm trying so hard to do it in the courts
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:45.560]  To do it legally
[2:15:45.560 --> 2:15:48.560]  Matthew Whitaker has to step up to the plate
[2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:49.560]  He does
[2:15:49.560 --> 2:15:51.560]  Larry Klayman, thank you so much for watching USA
[2:15:51.560 --> 2:16:11.560]  God bless you, we'll be right back

[2:16:59.560 --> 2:17:05.560]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way
[2:17:05.560 --> 2:17:08.560]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove
[2:17:08.560 --> 2:17:11.560]  That only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel
[2:17:11.560 --> 2:17:15.560]  The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable
[2:17:15.560 --> 2:17:20.560]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA

[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:31.560]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place
[2:17:31.560 --> 2:17:34.560]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed

[2:20:17.560 --> 2:20:22.560]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report
[2:20:22.560 --> 2:20:51.560]  It's Alex Jones
[2:20:53.560 --> 2:20:56.560]  Cheney had a heart pump for two years
[2:20:56.560 --> 2:21:00.560]  That's the longest-lived person ever had an outside heart
[2:21:00.560 --> 2:21:03.560]  And then he got all these other hearts and he's still alive
[2:21:03.560 --> 2:21:05.560]  It looks better than he looked 30 years ago
[2:21:05.560 --> 2:21:10.560]  Don't tell me there isn't life extension technologies for the establishment
[2:21:10.560 --> 2:21:17.560]  But again, George Herbert Walker Bush made his money off his Nazi collaborator father
[2:21:17.560 --> 2:21:20.560]  Then he told Saddam to invade Kuwait and set him up
[2:21:20.560 --> 2:21:23.560]  Then he helped ship narcotics in before
[2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:25.560]  It's just incredible
[2:21:25.560 --> 2:21:28.560]  And then all his behavior, I'm so sick of him
[2:21:28.560 --> 2:21:31.560]  I want to give the number of the listeners, though, separately from this
[2:21:31.560 --> 2:21:35.560]  On globalism, I think it really is dead
[2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:37.560]  I think that's what we're seeing here
[2:21:37.560 --> 2:21:40.560]  This is an archetype, this is a totem
[2:21:40.560 --> 2:21:44.560]  A sign, a sign, a logos
[2:21:44.560 --> 2:21:49.560]  A tea leaf, a portend, an omen
[2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:57.560]  Of globalism being dead
[2:21:57.560 --> 2:22:04.560]  We have the New World Order losing every election except for Venezuela and here
[2:22:04.560 --> 2:22:07.560]  In the last six years
[2:22:07.560 --> 2:22:14.560]  We're the only election other than Venezuela that anti-globalists have lost in six years
[2:22:14.560 --> 2:22:16.560]  Eight elections in Germany
[2:22:16.560 --> 2:22:19.560]  Five elections in England
[2:22:19.560 --> 2:22:20.560]  Three elections in Spain
[2:22:20.560 --> 2:22:22.560]  Four elections in Italy
[2:22:22.560 --> 2:22:26.560]  Multiple elections in Brazil
[2:22:26.560 --> 2:22:28.560]  Should I keep going here?
[2:22:28.560 --> 2:22:32.560]  But magically here, we see total fraud, oh it didn't happen
[2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:33.560]  Because of the fraud
[2:22:33.560 --> 2:22:35.560]  Just like Venezuela
[2:22:35.560 --> 2:22:40.560]  So I want to get your take on all of this and where you see this going
[2:22:40.560 --> 2:22:45.560]  And the riots happening in France by citizens
[2:22:45.560 --> 2:22:48.560]  It's not a bunch of Islamists in their nightgowns that never had a job in their life
[2:22:48.560 --> 2:22:52.560]  You know, walking around wiping their ass with their left hand or whatever they do
[2:22:52.560 --> 2:22:54.560]  I mean, this is the real world ladies and gentlemen
[2:22:54.560 --> 2:22:56.560]  This is people fighting back, this is humanity
[2:22:56.560 --> 2:22:58.560]  And it's exciting
[2:22:58.560 --> 2:23:03.560]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX
[2:23:03.560 --> 2:23:06.560]  877-789-2539
[2:23:06.560 --> 2:23:10.560]  877-877-789-2539
[2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:13.560]  877-789-ALEX
[2:23:13.560 --> 2:23:15.560]  And we'll get to everybody that calls
[2:23:15.560 --> 2:23:18.560]  Because instead of taking 30 calls that we can take on the board
[2:23:18.560 --> 2:23:20.560]  We'll just take 10, let the others ring
[2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:21.560]  We're done with those, we'll get more
[2:23:21.560 --> 2:23:25.560]  That way nobody ends up getting cheated on their air time
[2:23:25.560 --> 2:23:27.560]  Because I don't want people sitting on the hold anymore
[2:23:27.560 --> 2:23:29.560]  The no one bench have been really hilarious, smart
[2:23:29.560 --> 2:23:32.560]  Really not even just a comedian now, a censor comedian
[2:23:32.560 --> 2:23:36.560]  But an analyst of mind control, a media manipulation
[2:23:36.560 --> 2:23:39.560]  He'll be joining us coming up in the fourth hour ahead of the war
[2:23:39.560 --> 2:23:43.560]  With Owen Shroyer and Roger Stone who Trump's been tweeting about today
[2:23:43.560 --> 2:23:47.560]  Saying thank God somebody still got guts
[2:23:47.560 --> 2:23:53.560]  And you know, I love the fact that Trump doesn't give that guts comment to many people
[2:23:53.560 --> 2:23:59.560]  And I'm not a sycophantic person that worships power or prestige
[2:23:59.560 --> 2:24:01.560]  Or people in the media, most people in the media I hate
[2:24:01.560 --> 2:24:05.560]  But Trump doesn't give the, you're a real man, you've got a lot of courage
[2:24:05.560 --> 2:24:10.560]  I admire you to a lot of people
[2:24:10.560 --> 2:24:12.560]  And so I'll go ahead and say it
[2:24:12.560 --> 2:24:15.560]  Just to trigger the media that thinks I'm out here in Neverland
[2:24:15.560 --> 2:24:18.560]  And you've defeated me, which we have in our core audience is bigger than ever
[2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:21.560]  Our reach is restricted to new people
[2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:27.560]  Which I hate because it's great to talk to folks that are awake all day long
[2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:30.560]  But what I really want to reach is new people
[2:24:30.560 --> 2:24:33.560]  When we still reach a ton of them, but just not like before
[2:24:33.560 --> 2:24:37.560]  That's, you know, I just tell this where people say you don't give them and tell it's true, man
[2:24:37.560 --> 2:24:42.560]  You gotta, you know
[2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:45.560]  The point is Trump has a lot of courage when he's doing
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:24:52.560]  And Trump has always sat there
[2:24:52.560 --> 2:24:54.560]  And I've talked to him
[2:24:54.560 --> 2:24:56.560]  Or my wife's talked to him
[2:24:56.560 --> 2:24:58.560]  And or people I know that know Trump bring it up
[2:24:58.560 --> 2:25:00.560]  Like man, Jones got a lot of courage, put up with that crap
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:02.560]  I see what they're doing, that means he's over the target
[2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:05.560]  I really listen to him because I know they really hate him
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:07.560]  So that means, you know, I look into it all the time
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:10.560]  It's really accurate what he says, man, smart guy
[2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:14.560]  And it's just, I would not care if George Herbert Walker Bush said that to me
[2:25:14.560 --> 2:25:15.560]  Or George W. Bush
[2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:17.560]  In fact, they even tried to
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:23.560]  My sister went to school with the same school as the Bush daughters here in Austin
[2:25:23.560 --> 2:25:26.560]  St. Andrews, she's younger than me
[2:25:26.560 --> 2:25:29.560]  And so even when I was in college
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:32.560]  I'd go to the barbecue and there'd be George W. Bush
[2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:37.560]  Before he was, well, when he was governor
[2:25:37.560 --> 2:25:39.560]  And then I remember like
[2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:42.560]  Federal Marshals when he was already President-elect
[2:25:42.560 --> 2:25:44.560]  Or they were fighting over the election
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:47.560]  It was about to be President-elect, came down, came down to the office
[2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:51.560]  They said, he'll be watching tonight, George W.
[2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:56.560]  And all he's asking is that
[2:25:56.560 --> 2:25:59.560]  You say nice things about him tonight
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:01.560]  And he wants you to come to Governor's Mansion
[2:26:01.560 --> 2:26:03.560]  And it was like learning how to be a whore
[2:26:03.560 --> 2:26:07.560]  And I said, so I went on that show that night and attacked the Bushes
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:11.560]  And it was very easy to do, that's what I do
[2:26:11.560 --> 2:26:14.560]  But these people collect humans like baseball cards
[2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:17.560]  I'm not here to be collected
[2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:22.560]  But with Trump being demonized and lied about
[2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:25.560]  And everything else
[2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:29.560]  It's so real that I haven't been collected by Trump
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:31.560]  We're together in the fight
[2:26:36.560 --> 2:26:39.560]  And so I'm not going to say what Trump said to me privately
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:43.560]  Many times, but let's just say this
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:46.560]  We are definitely birds of a feather to fly together
[2:26:46.560 --> 2:26:49.560]  And I know all the secrets
[2:26:49.560 --> 2:26:51.560]  About ever talking to Trump
[2:26:51.560 --> 2:26:54.560]  Because my dad was just like his dad
[2:26:54.560 --> 2:26:58.560]  And we were drinking from the very same well
[2:26:58.560 --> 2:27:01.560]  So people say, how the hell are you guys so synced?
[2:27:01.560 --> 2:27:04.560]  We are spiritually synced
[2:27:04.560 --> 2:27:08.560]  We're not fake Bible thumpers, we love God
[2:27:08.560 --> 2:27:10.560]  But we're not out to get people
[2:27:10.560 --> 2:27:13.560]  And we don't like people suppressing people
[2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:16.560]  And Trump was reading Western Goals
[2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:20.560]  By Congressman Larry McDonald for a decade
[2:27:20.560 --> 2:27:22.560]  And so was I when I was a little kid
[2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:27.560]  Well, my dad was reading it
[2:27:27.560 --> 2:27:30.560]  It was like an army colonel at the house
[2:27:30.560 --> 2:27:34.560]  An FBI guy and you know, my dad would like be
[2:27:34.560 --> 2:27:38.560]  All this stuff going on and they were just all
[2:27:38.560 --> 2:27:41.560]  They didn't want power, those men didn't want power
[2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:43.560]  They had power, they were powerful men
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:45.560]  They were from powerful families, they were strong
[2:27:45.560 --> 2:27:49.560]  They wanted to defend America
[2:27:49.560 --> 2:27:52.560]  And so when I was 10 years old and 5 years old
[2:27:52.560 --> 2:27:55.560]  And hearing all this, Donald Trump was reading this
[2:27:55.560 --> 2:27:58.560]  And his lawyer Roy Cohen
[2:27:58.560 --> 2:28:00.560]  On the board of Western Goals
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:03.560]  The heart of the resistance
[2:28:03.560 --> 2:28:05.560]  Knowing all this was coming
[2:28:05.560 --> 2:28:07.560]  Donald Trump, man, he was there
[2:28:07.560 --> 2:28:11.560]  So yeah, I was synced with Donald Trump
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:14.560]  When I was 5 years old
[2:28:14.560 --> 2:28:17.560]  Because when you're 5 years old
[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:20.560]  And you're getting your uncle wounded off a C-130
[2:28:20.560 --> 2:28:22.560]  At the Air Force Base
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:24.560]  Or you're sitting around the table
[2:28:24.560 --> 2:28:26.560]  And a bunch of guys are sitting around talking about the country
[2:28:26.560 --> 2:28:29.560]  You're listening to this and you know, this isn't TV
[2:28:29.560 --> 2:28:31.560]  This isn't the movies, this is the real thing
[2:28:31.560 --> 2:28:33.560]  Your little ears go, throw it
[2:28:33.560 --> 2:28:35.560]  You're listening to it just like Donald Trump did
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:37.560]  He was a man when all this was happening
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:40.560]  And he, Roy Cohen, told him everything
[2:28:40.560 --> 2:28:42.560]  His dad already knew it all too
[2:28:42.560 --> 2:28:45.560]  And so now they've got basically a John Burt society president
[2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:48.560]  Up there, he knows how to fight all their tricks
[2:28:48.560 --> 2:28:50.560]  And their worst nightmares come true
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:52.560]  That's why they're so freaked out
[2:28:52.560 --> 2:29:15.560]  Everyone ask who he really is?
[2:29:22.560 --> 2:29:24.560]  This is John, available at Amazon Books
[2:29:52.560 --> 2:30:00.560]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage
[2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:02.560]  And that's why we need you to go to the site now
[2:30:02.560 --> 2:30:05.560]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest

[2:30:08.560 --> 2:30:13.560]  $25, $50, $100, $250, even $500
[2:30:13.560 --> 2:30:16.560]  Would be a godsend to our important work here
[2:30:16.560 --> 2:30:18.560]  To beat back the globalists
[2:30:18.560 --> 2:30:21.560]  And to destroy their campaign of censorship
[2:30:21.560 --> 2:30:25.560]  In which they want to strangle our first amendment rights
[2:30:52.560 --> 2:30:53.560]  And with your help spreading it
[2:30:53.560 --> 2:30:54.560]  And with your help downloading it
[2:30:54.560 --> 2:31:21.560]  We are unstoppable
[2:31:25.560 --> 2:31:27.560]  So that we're not pesky in the future
[2:31:27.560 --> 2:31:30.560]  I want to be troublesome and pesky
[2:31:30.560 --> 2:31:31.560]  I want to keep going
[2:31:31.560 --> 2:31:33.560]  I want to make them do the ultimate
[2:31:33.560 --> 2:31:35.560]  Not just destroy us financially
[2:31:35.560 --> 2:31:37.560]  I want to push all the way
[2:31:37.560 --> 2:31:38.560]  I've committed to do that
[2:31:38.560 --> 2:31:39.560]  I've prayed for that
[2:31:39.560 --> 2:31:41.560]  And I've been told that's going to happen
[2:31:41.560 --> 2:31:42.560]  But you've got to back us
[2:31:42.560 --> 2:31:44.560]  And I promise you this
[2:31:44.560 --> 2:31:45.560]  I will never falter
[2:31:45.560 --> 2:31:47.560]  I will never waver at the spiritual level
[2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:48.560]  I physically will
[2:31:48.560 --> 2:31:50.560]  But I give you my commitment
[2:31:50.560 --> 2:31:51.560]  If you financially support us
[2:31:51.560 --> 2:31:54.560]  Then go to foreshore.com to give you
[2:31:54.560 --> 2:32:23.560]  An absolutely total commitment
[2:32:25.560 --> 2:32:28.560]  We have seen what they want to do
[2:32:28.560 --> 2:32:30.560]  They called it UN Agenda 21
[2:32:30.560 --> 2:32:32.560]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda
[2:32:32.560 --> 2:32:35.560]  They want everybody off of the rural lands
[2:32:35.560 --> 2:32:37.560]  They want people out of the suburbs
[2:32:37.560 --> 2:32:39.560]  They want to pack everybody into the cities
[2:32:39.560 --> 2:32:41.560]  Because that's where it is easiest
[2:32:41.560 --> 2:32:43.560]  For them to control everyone
[2:32:43.560 --> 2:32:45.560]  It's The David Knight Show
[2:32:45.560 --> 2:32:47.560]  I never missed your show
[2:32:47.560 --> 2:32:48.560]  And he did
[2:32:48.560 --> 2:32:51.560]  And he was, I mean, never
[2:32:51.560 --> 2:32:55.560]  EditForce.com forward slash show
[2:33:21.560 --> 2:33:28.560]  We're going to write to your phone calls
[2:33:28.560 --> 2:33:30.560]  I want to make this point right now
[2:33:30.560 --> 2:33:32.560]  You can sit here and you can over
[2:33:32.560 --> 2:33:34.560]  Analyze and calculate and look at
[2:33:34.560 --> 2:33:37.560]  Every point of the compass
[2:33:37.560 --> 2:33:39.560]  But at the end of the day
[2:33:39.560 --> 2:33:41.560]  The final equation
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:42.560]  The final equation
[2:33:42.560 --> 2:33:43.560]  The final equation
[2:33:43.560 --> 2:33:44.560]  The final equation
[2:33:44.560 --> 2:33:45.560]  The final equation
[2:33:45.560 --> 2:33:46.560]  The final equation
[2:33:46.560 --> 2:33:47.560]  The final equation
[2:33:47.560 --> 2:33:48.560]  The final equation
[2:33:48.560 --> 2:33:51.560]  The final equation
[2:33:51.560 --> 2:33:53.560]  There are people that do things
[2:33:53.560 --> 2:33:56.560]  Because they think it's the right thing to do
[2:33:56.560 --> 2:33:59.560]  Because they're honorable
[2:33:59.560 --> 2:34:02.560]  And sometimes they get misled
[2:34:02.560 --> 2:34:04.560]  And there are people
[2:34:04.560 --> 2:34:06.560]  That are a bunch of backstabbing
[2:34:06.560 --> 2:34:09.560]  Knuckled dragon trash
[2:34:09.560 --> 2:34:11.560]  And they're always white shoe boys
[2:34:11.560 --> 2:34:12.560]  That think they're slick
[2:34:12.560 --> 2:34:13.560]  And they all kiss each other's ass
[2:34:13.560 --> 2:34:15.560]  And talk crap about each other
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:16.560]  And angle
[2:34:16.560 --> 2:34:19.560]  And try to get in control of things
[2:34:19.560 --> 2:34:20.560]  They didn't build
[2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:22.560]  Instead of admiring those
[2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:23.560]  That built something
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:25.560]  And wanting to work with those people
[2:34:25.560 --> 2:34:27.560]  To build something greater
[2:34:27.560 --> 2:34:29.560]  And when you realize that
[2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:31.560]  You see the existential envy
[2:34:31.560 --> 2:34:33.560]  Of the white shoe boy establishment
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:35.560]  And then right down to the third world
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:37.560]  There's some great people in the third world
[2:34:37.560 --> 2:34:39.560]  Great innovations there
[2:34:39.560 --> 2:34:41.560]  But they don't want those people
[2:34:41.560 --> 2:34:43.560]  They want the people that are attracted
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:45.560]  To the UN refugee camp
[2:34:45.560 --> 2:34:47.560]  Into the hating America
[2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:49.560]  And believe that you're going to get something free
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:52.560]  And to the criminals
[2:34:52.560 --> 2:34:54.560]  And all I want to report to you is
[2:34:54.560 --> 2:34:57.560]  The dreams of people
[2:34:57.560 --> 2:34:59.560]  That I saw 30, 40 years ago
[2:34:59.560 --> 2:35:01.560]  Who were concerned about
[2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:02.560]  Where this country was going
[2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:03.560]  Or alive today
[2:35:03.560 --> 2:35:05.560]  And what they stood for
[2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:06.560]  And what they spoke about
[2:35:06.560 --> 2:35:08.560]  They had no idea
[2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:10.560]  They were handing out thousands of books a month
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:12.560]  And literature and warning people
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:15.560]  And then sitting right there
[2:35:15.560 --> 2:35:18.560]  Was somebody that was three feet tall
[2:35:18.560 --> 2:35:19.560]  Watching
[2:35:19.560 --> 2:35:21.560]  You never know where your real audience is
[2:35:21.560 --> 2:35:22.560]  Is my point
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:25.560]  Sometimes it's right there
[2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:28.560]  In the room
[2:35:28.560 --> 2:35:30.560]  Sometimes they've got Zilla
[2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:32.560]  That's kind of attacked the globalists
[2:35:32.560 --> 2:35:33.560]  It's right there
[2:35:33.560 --> 2:35:34.560]  But it's little to baby
[2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:36.560]  Nobody sees it then
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:37.560]  Because we're running around
[2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:39.560]  Trying to wake the zombies up
[2:35:39.560 --> 2:35:40.560]  Which I still do
[2:35:40.560 --> 2:35:42.560]  But more and more I realize
[2:35:42.560 --> 2:35:44.560]  It's about targeting the thinkers
[2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:46.560]  And reaching out to them
[2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:48.560]  I'm going to go to your phone calls
[2:35:48.560 --> 2:35:50.560]  It's just this that
[2:35:50.560 --> 2:35:52.560]  It's better sweet because we're under attack
[2:35:52.560 --> 2:35:54.560]  And that's not fine
[2:35:54.560 --> 2:35:56.560]  Because we want to be here for the long haul
[2:35:56.560 --> 2:35:57.560]  I want to be here
[2:35:57.560 --> 2:35:58.560]  You know, it's like, you know
[2:35:58.560 --> 2:35:59.560]  You get older
[2:35:59.560 --> 2:36:00.560]  You don't fear death anymore
[2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:01.560]  But you fear death
[2:36:01.560 --> 2:36:03.560]  Because you want to be here for your children
[2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:04.560]  And your grandchildren
[2:36:04.560 --> 2:36:08.560]  Like, what happens when I'm not here?
[2:36:08.560 --> 2:36:11.560]  Like, I got over the fear of death a long time ago
[2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:14.560]  But now I fear not being here for my children
[2:36:14.560 --> 2:36:15.560]  Then there's the fear of doing this
[2:36:15.560 --> 2:36:16.560]  And damaging your kids
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:18.560]  But then you realize there's no future anyways
[2:36:18.560 --> 2:36:19.560]  But you don't do it
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:22.560]  But then you still try to figure out
[2:36:22.560 --> 2:36:26.560]  The right thing to do
[2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:27.560]  And you sit back
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:28.560]  And you think about the globalists
[2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:31.560]  Who don't give a damn about anybody
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:32.560]  What a horrible state that must be
[2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:33.560]  But you know what?
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:35.560]  You can't sit there and feel sorry for them
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:37.560]  We've got a job to block them
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:38.560]  And get in their face
[2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:40.560]  And you know, let them know
[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:42.560]  Hey, you defiled Jesus Christ
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:44.560]  We defiled you, Mueller
[2:36:44.560 --> 2:36:46.560]  Everybody kisses your ass all day
[2:36:46.560 --> 2:36:47.560]  You're a piece of crap
[2:36:47.560 --> 2:36:49.560]  I'm going to pull you down
[2:36:49.560 --> 2:36:50.560]  Satanists want to defile Christ
[2:36:50.560 --> 2:36:51.560]  I defile you
[2:36:51.560 --> 2:36:52.560]  You're their God
[2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:55.560]  I say, you're a piece of crap
[2:36:55.560 --> 2:36:57.560]  They don't like that
[2:36:57.560 --> 2:36:58.560]  Jesus Christ doesn't care
[2:36:58.560 --> 2:37:00.560]  If some devil works for hate
[2:37:00.560 --> 2:37:01.560]  He feels sorry for their soul
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:02.560]  But these devils
[2:37:02.560 --> 2:37:03.560]  They defiled Christ
[2:37:03.560 --> 2:37:05.560]  Because they wouldn't like that
[2:37:05.560 --> 2:37:08.560]  Being done to them
[2:37:08.560 --> 2:37:10.560]  That's a big understanding
[2:37:10.560 --> 2:37:11.560]  How to pick a fight with these people
[2:37:11.560 --> 2:37:13.560]  You know, I've done it
[2:37:13.560 --> 2:37:14.560]  I did it all
[2:37:14.560 --> 2:37:19.560]  And I'm proud of it, quite frankly
[2:37:19.560 --> 2:37:21.560]  But you know it scares the hell out of me
[2:37:21.560 --> 2:37:24.560]  That I can not manipulate
[2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:25.560]  My own wife or children
[2:37:25.560 --> 2:37:26.560]  I have no power
[2:37:26.560 --> 2:37:27.560]  I wouldn't even try
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:30.560]  But these globalists
[2:37:30.560 --> 2:37:32.560]  I've been given the power to do it
[2:37:32.560 --> 2:37:34.560]  And I just leave them around by the nose
[2:37:34.560 --> 2:37:38.560]  And that's a very scary final equation
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:41.560]  That these people are running things
[2:37:41.560 --> 2:37:43.560]  And they can be manipulated into a fight
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:46.560]  At the time and place of your choosing
[2:37:46.560 --> 2:37:47.560]  The difference is though
[2:37:47.560 --> 2:37:50.560]  You've got to be ready
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:52.560]  You've got to be ready for that fight
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:55.560]  We're going to go to these loaded phone lines
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:37:56.560]  A lot of cool names here
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:37:58.560]  We're getting things like Mega Titan
[2:37:58.560 --> 2:38:00.560]  And Ken and Howard and Jim and Carlos
[2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:02.560]  And John and Tucker Vett
[2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:04.560]  And Alex and Terry and Derek
[2:38:04.560 --> 2:38:06.560]  Who's up first here?
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:10.560]  Who should we go to first?
[2:38:10.560 --> 2:38:11.560]  Let's go to the very top
[2:38:11.560 --> 2:38:12.560]  Alex and Michigan
[2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:13.560]  Thanks for holding your on the air
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:14.560]  Welcome
[2:38:14.560 --> 2:38:15.560]  Alex Jones
[2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:16.560]  Thanks for taking my call
[2:38:16.560 --> 2:38:17.560]  Thanks for calling brother
[2:38:17.560 --> 2:38:18.560]  Go ahead
[2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:22.560]  Yep, just good job exposing George Bush
[2:38:22.560 --> 2:38:24.560]  And I just wanted to mention
[2:38:24.560 --> 2:38:26.560]  He has some ties to the opium trade
[2:38:26.560 --> 2:38:30.560]  As well as he's married to Alistair Crowley's daughter
[2:38:30.560 --> 2:38:31.560]  What's your name?
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:33.560]  Well, people say that
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:34.560]  I haven't seen the proof of that
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:37.560]  But he definitely had ties to the skull and bones
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:39.560]  It was founded by opium trade
[2:38:39.560 --> 2:38:41.560]  And the narcotics trafficking
[2:38:41.560 --> 2:38:42.560]  It wasn't Reagan bringing cocaine
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:43.560]  And it was him during the eighties
[2:38:43.560 --> 2:38:45.560]  And yeah, no, it was like
[2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:46.560]  Bush would do everything
[2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:49.560]  And then leak it to the press and blame Reagan
[2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:50.560]  And I'm not just defending Reagan
[2:38:50.560 --> 2:38:51.560]  Out of the folks that were there
[2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:53.560]  It was going on
[2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:54.560]  Oh yeah
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:38:56.560]  And also David Knight does a good job explaining
[2:38:56.560 --> 2:39:00.560]  Kind of, I'm a big fan of Laura the Rings
[2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:02.560]  And David Knight does some good analogies
[2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:04.560]  Of how you can tie it
[2:39:04.560 --> 2:39:05.560]  You can make metaphors all day
[2:39:05.560 --> 2:39:06.560]  But I'll just, you know
[2:39:06.560 --> 2:39:09.560]  Oh yeah, I mean J.R.R. Tolkien was a genius
[2:39:09.560 --> 2:39:10.560]  He'd been to World War I
[2:39:10.560 --> 2:39:12.560]  In England, South Africa, Europe
[2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:14.560]  And that was an allegory of good nibbles
[2:39:14.560 --> 2:39:16.560]  It was very powerful
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:18.560]  Yeah, like Sauron corrupted the waters
[2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:19.560]  Of the Greenwood first
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:21.560]  That turned it into Merckwood
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:23.560]  That corrupted all the creatures
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:25.560]  And all the spiders came out
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:27.560]  And just, if you look at the GMOs
[2:39:27.560 --> 2:39:28.560]  The vaccines, the fluoride
[2:39:28.560 --> 2:39:30.560]  Oh, the golden child, all of it
[2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:33.560]  They poison you first to get control of you
[2:39:33.560 --> 2:39:35.560]  Yep, the phyroestrogens from soybeans
[2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:37.560]  The barium, aluminum, sulfates, and chemtrails
[2:39:37.560 --> 2:39:40.560]  The open air pharmacological crops
[2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:43.560]  Like from companies like Protegen, the 5G, the Wi-Fi
[2:39:43.560 --> 2:39:45.560]  The borer field tissues used in flavoring
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:47.560]  Companies like Xenomics
[2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:49.560]  And by the way, that's not your opinion
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:52.560]  The globalists admit they're corrupting us to control us
[2:39:52.560 --> 2:39:55.560]  That, like you read the Ecoscience
[2:39:55.560 --> 2:39:57.560]  Written by the former White House Science
[2:39:57.560 --> 2:40:01.560]  Of Obama, he said all this in 1974
[2:40:01.560 --> 2:40:05.560]  45 years ago, the year I was born
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:08.560]  I mean, these people are nasty
[2:40:08.560 --> 2:40:12.560]  But you see, they see future war against everybody
[2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:14.560]  They see us as their threat
[2:40:14.560 --> 2:40:16.560]  And they see the survival of the fittest
[2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:18.560]  If they can do something evil to us
[2:40:18.560 --> 2:40:20.560]  And dominate us, it's their right
[2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:22.560]  Under their social Darwinistic view
[2:40:22.560 --> 2:40:23.560]  Thank you, Alex
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:26.560]  Really great points today
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:28.560]  Let's talk to Terry in Arizona
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:30.560]  And we'll talk about M4's in-game
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:31.560]  And the battle for the Republic
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:33.560]  Go ahead, Terry, you're on the air
[2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:35.560]  Yes, Alex
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:38.560]  First, God bless you
[2:40:38.560 --> 2:40:40.560]  And everybody you're working with
[2:40:40.560 --> 2:40:41.560]  All your guests
[2:40:41.560 --> 2:40:44.560]  I don't care if they're packing boxes for you
[2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:48.560]  But to my point, I watched in-game yesterday
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:51.560]  Which since I've been watching documentaries
[2:40:51.560 --> 2:40:54.560]  Since the mid-50s
[2:40:54.560 --> 2:40:58.560]  That's the most brilliant spot on documentary
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:40:59.560]  I've ever seen
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:01.560]  When I saw that years ago
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:04.560]  When it came out, I've been with you ever since
[2:41:04.560 --> 2:41:05.560]  And a lot of us
[2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:08.560]  But you need to bring that back up
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:10.560]  It was ahead of its time
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:12.560]  Give promotionals
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:14.560]  Everybody needs to see that
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:17.560]  But I watched the extra on that
[2:41:17.560 --> 2:41:19.560]  Besides Jimmy Vaughn's cool song
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:21.560]  You ought to be playing
[2:41:21.560 --> 2:41:24.560]  And battle for the Republic
[2:41:24.560 --> 2:41:27.560]  Is about a spot on to what's going on
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:29.560]  On the border right now
[2:41:29.560 --> 2:41:33.560]  This country needs to be watching that
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:36.560]  And personally, I'll have to listen to you on shortwave
[2:41:36.560 --> 2:41:39.560]  Because that's the only way I get it
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:43.560]  But anyway, you need to bring...
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:45.560]  Sir, I totally agree
[2:41:45.560 --> 2:41:46.560]  Here's the deal
[2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:48.560]  I've made a film in six, seven, eight years
[2:41:48.560 --> 2:41:50.560]  They're trying to block us everywhere from doing it
[2:41:50.560 --> 2:41:52.560]  They're trying to make films
[2:41:52.560 --> 2:41:54.560]  And we're going to do it again
[2:41:54.560 --> 2:41:56.560]  And we're going to put them out for free
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:41:57.560]  Like we've always done
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:41:59.560]  In-game had, let's not exaggerate
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:02.560]  Like 67 million views on Google video
[2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:04.560]  Then they just got rid of it and deleted it
[2:42:04.560 --> 2:42:05.560]  And then Google video went away
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:07.560]  And it's got like, you know, total
[2:42:07.560 --> 2:42:09.560]  I think on YouTube like 10 million views or something
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:11.560]  5 million here, a few million there
[2:42:11.560 --> 2:42:14.560]  But yeah, the film was made 11 years ago
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:15.560]  Everything in it's come true
[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:16.560]  Because it's what they said they'd do
[2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:17.560]  Which is even more frightening
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:19.560]  These people mean business
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:21.560]  And so it gets into the whole eugenics
[2:42:21.560 --> 2:42:24.560]  The funding of Hitler, the master plan
[2:42:24.560 --> 2:42:27.560]  The transhumanism, it's a free film
[2:42:27.560 --> 2:42:28.560]  I don't even want to talk about it
[2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:30.560]  Because actually George Soros has been lobbying
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:32.560]  Through many of matters
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:34.560]  To have it removed off of YouTube
[2:42:34.560 --> 2:42:36.560]  And off Amazon where you can rent it
[2:42:36.560 --> 2:42:37.560]  For like 20 cents or something
[2:42:37.560 --> 2:42:39.560]  But yeah, God bless you
[2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:41.560]  Yeah, it's a very important film
[2:42:41.560 --> 2:42:43.560]  And that's why God's really blessed us
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:46.560]  We've done multi-lifetimes of work
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:47.560]  That's why I want to keep fighting
[2:42:47.560 --> 2:42:49.560]  But if something happens, then for worse
[2:42:49.560 --> 2:42:51.560]  I can already feel like we've already
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:43:20.560]  Filled our purpose
[2:43:21.560 --> 2:43:23.560]  Back against the modern day lifestyle
[2:43:23.560 --> 2:43:25.560]  With the screen time and the extended hours
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:27.560]  To still have the stamina and endurance
[2:43:27.560 --> 2:43:29.560]  Energy and drive
[2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:31.560]  To get to the gym, get to the park
[2:43:31.560 --> 2:43:33.560]  And get exercise that you need

[2:43:39.560 --> 2:43:41.560]  This is actually our last run
[2:43:41.560 --> 2:43:43.560]  Of supermail vitality
[2:43:43.560 --> 2:43:45.560]  So I want you to experience
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:47.560]  Supermail vitality before it's too late
[2:43:47.560 --> 2:43:50.560]  Unleash the supermail in you
[2:43:50.560 --> 2:43:52.560]  For supermail vitality
[2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:54.560]  Go to infowarstore.com
[2:43:54.560 --> 2:43:56.560]  The globalists know
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:43:58.560]  That if they suppress the good halogen
[2:43:58.560 --> 2:44:00.560]  And pump the environment full of the bad halogens
[2:44:00.560 --> 2:44:02.560]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it
[2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:04.560]  That it lowers IQ
[2:44:04.560 --> 2:44:06.560]  It literally dumps the population down
[2:44:06.560 --> 2:44:08.560]  And on our quest to bring
[2:44:08.560 --> 2:44:10.560]  Our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:13.560]  We've gone through two permutations
[2:44:13.560 --> 2:44:15.560]  First seaweed-based iodine
[2:44:15.560 --> 2:44:17.560]  That was pretty good but hard to source
[2:44:17.560 --> 2:44:19.560]  And the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it
[2:44:19.560 --> 2:44:21.560]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals
[2:44:21.560 --> 2:44:23.560]  A pure nascent iodine
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:25.560]  And brought you X2
[2:44:25.560 --> 2:44:27.560]  That's been incredible
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:29.560]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that
[2:44:29.560 --> 2:44:31.560]  We did more research and secured
[2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:33.560]  More of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:35.560]  But chemists, scientists, and others
[2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:37.560]  Showed us the research
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:39.560]  That by combining it with three other compounds
[2:44:39.560 --> 2:44:41.560]  Two forms of iodine and vitamin C
[2:44:41.560 --> 2:44:43.560]  It supercharges it
[2:44:43.560 --> 2:44:45.560]  And makes it even more
[2:44:45.560 --> 2:44:47.560]  Bioavailable
[2:44:47.560 --> 2:44:49.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:51.560]  You want to see it, it's an incredible discovery
[2:44:51.560 --> 2:44:53.560]  X3, now available at

[2:48:09.560 --> 2:48:15.960]  there's a lot of bad happening but I just want to point out every election for six years except two
[2:48:18.120 --> 2:48:23.560]  has gone against the globalist Venezuela in the USA because of fraud
[2:48:27.320 --> 2:48:29.480]  and then I've got all the other reports
[2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:37.880]  they're in trouble that's why they're fighting so hard so don't don't get too down
[2:48:39.880 --> 2:48:43.320]  you know you think the public would be in to solve preservation and free market and seeing
[2:48:43.320 --> 2:48:49.160]  that Trump's going to bat for him again people say oh you need to quit supporting Trump I've been
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:54.840]  persecuted because I support Trump and I support him more because I've been persecuted not less
[2:48:54.840 --> 2:48:59.080]  than I've grown men and lawyers and everybody else go you know Robert Mueller
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:05.480]  and I mean folks that work with me I shouldn't get into this I'm not really supposed to
[2:49:07.240 --> 2:49:14.040]  because unless something's criminal and things are you know on record I don't talk about them but
[2:49:14.040 --> 2:49:20.760]  you know I've told the president about this and I've told high-level national talk shows about
[2:49:20.760 --> 2:49:26.200]  it and I've got all the documents out there because it happened twice I had Robert Mueller literally
[2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:32.200]  try to set me up and I called the FBI and I said I'm a letter too I said I'm ready to come in
[2:49:32.200 --> 2:49:35.640]  I'm ready to talk about this right now of course they didn't because they they sent the people that
[2:49:35.640 --> 2:49:40.920]  did it it doesn't mean the whole FBI is bad and it's not like some ass-kissing thing about the FBI
[2:49:40.920 --> 2:49:47.640]  it's like saying Walmart you know one guy was an a jerk to me so all of Walmart is bad I want to be
[2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:53.080]  clear some of the best people I've ever met in my life for FBI agents I mean I group around some of
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:49:59.000]  family friends people steadfast Christians super hardworking doing great things working 24 hours a
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:04.200]  day sometimes to get kidnapped kids or bank robbers and then you got big old evil turds like Robert
[2:50:04.200 --> 2:50:08.360]  Mueller right on top of it and I just you know I'm just not going to put up with it or that idiot
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:15.080]  call me but get them off the screen I can't look at them so when I say nice things about the FBI
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:19.720]  it's not because I don't hate the corruption in it it's because I'm not gonna lie and say the whole
[2:50:19.720 --> 2:50:26.840]  thing's bad but let me tell you something it's real personal when all you care about is the country
[2:50:26.840 --> 2:50:32.040]  and you're a good moral person who's never screwed anybody over let me tell you something I would have
[2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:36.600]  made let's not exaggerate you know how much money I'm gonna go the calls but I just I've been meaning
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:42.040]  to say this and I'm gonna say you know what I'll just maybe I'll say it tomorrow it's like I'm
[2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:46.200]  hide one about to say it's just it's like such an example of what I stand for
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:51:00.040]  I could have made 500 million dollars I went back and looked at the offers and these are real groups
[2:51:01.160 --> 2:51:05.320]  but see I'm not Floyd Waymether and I'm not saying he's a bad guy but
[2:51:05.320 --> 2:51:13.080]  I could have sat up here and pitched you Ponzi schemes with different bitcoins and been paid
[2:51:13.640 --> 2:51:19.560]  millions per month per group for years on the way up they tried to hire me I got visited and
[2:51:19.560 --> 2:51:25.400]  told how great George Soros was and how I should leave Malone and here's 20 million dollars of
[2:51:25.400 --> 2:51:36.360]  Bitcoin I didn't even ever get it off the laptop I don't know where it is
[2:51:37.800 --> 2:51:46.600]  and then I sat there and I had them offer me last year you know even more money and it's big groups
[2:51:46.600 --> 2:51:54.280]  in the news and I and they even told me oh here's how you do it you tell them you're being paid
[2:51:54.280 --> 2:51:57.640]  you just kind of slip it in there that way you don't think you know the Securities Exchange
[2:51:57.640 --> 2:52:01.800]  Commission didn't go after you and and and he was still there I was like no I'm not doing that
[2:52:03.160 --> 2:52:07.400]  because I said I believe cryptocurrencies be real technology but this whole thing of pumping
[2:52:07.400 --> 2:52:12.680]  it up and dumping it let me just quantify this for you Soros is behind Bitcoin okay
[2:52:14.440 --> 2:52:20.280]  and they even sent their got dogged agents in here and they think I'm stupid
[2:52:20.280 --> 2:52:29.000]  and they can't believe I didn't take the money Soros if I was 14 they offered me money to round
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:36.840]  up my fellow people or anybody else I'd tell them yes and then I'd get a submachine gun
[2:52:36.840 --> 2:52:43.880]  and I'd go after everybody see because I'm a Texan I mentally ill you see I care about people
[2:52:43.880 --> 2:52:51.080]  but I'm also a killer so you guys can't get the two together like it's it's like conlad
[2:52:51.080 --> 2:52:55.880]  Lorenz and animal psychology the most vicious animals are actually the most loving because
[2:52:55.880 --> 2:53:03.800]  they have a governor you people are weak you don't have a governor you see so I didn't want the 500
[2:53:03.800 --> 2:53:10.520]  million dollars so what I'd have some private jet and a bunch of people hate me and I'm a
[2:53:10.520 --> 2:53:17.240]  I hang around a bunch of mummies like you and that's what makes me sick about so-called little
[2:53:17.240 --> 2:53:22.440]  friends I knew that won't even talk to me now because I've been blackballed they don't even get
[2:53:22.440 --> 2:53:28.760]  that they sold out their whole birthright everything and they didn't even know so I am I
[2:53:28.760 --> 2:53:32.760]  don't cruise rate people like oh this is great we have these advertising things I even had to
[2:53:32.760 --> 2:53:43.720]  tell GCN a few years ago I said if you run those Bitcoin ads I'm gonna leave your network they're
[2:53:43.720 --> 2:53:49.320]  like well that's very threatening and I said it ain't threatening man if I'm gonna sell out
[2:53:49.960 --> 2:53:54.120]  I'm gonna go all the way I'm not gonna like not sell out the globalist and then sit here and
[2:53:54.120 --> 2:54:03.400]  F my audience over it's not happening because my audience is me if my audience treated me like that
[2:54:03.400 --> 2:54:09.000]  I'd want to kill them you people don't get that do you you don't have an understanding of treating
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:13.240]  people like you want to be treated you don't have any christlike qualities you have zero
[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:19.720]  and you think it's so tough to screw people over you think it's so cool but you know I look at the
[2:54:19.720 --> 2:54:30.440]  globalist and they almost all of them give their sons over to the pedophile rings
[2:54:32.600 --> 2:54:36.440]  as I mean you could even be one of the most powerful robber baron families in the country
[2:54:36.440 --> 2:54:41.800]  and your son's now a CNN host and at nine year old nine years old they gave their son to the cult
[2:54:43.240 --> 2:54:47.960]  so 50 guys could gang bang them I'm not gonna say the name of the guy but it's well no
[2:54:47.960 --> 2:54:53.880]  no I mean that's who these people are it's like do you think I want to be with you forever I do
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:58.680]  not want to be near you this is a spiritual thing like I don't want to be close to you you
[2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:04.280]  understand that so taking your money is getting close to you it's like it's not hard to deny your
[2:55:04.280 --> 2:55:16.680]  money it's the opposite it's a pleasure it's a pleasure because this is a spiritual thing
[2:55:16.680 --> 2:55:24.920]  I ain't screwing no kids and I ain't into kids you got that and I'm not into your devil worship
[2:55:24.920 --> 2:55:29.800]  or all the rest of it and so I just wanted to metaphysically get that out here just as an example
[2:55:30.840 --> 2:55:38.440]  that I in nine years of Bitcoin being promoted all the rest of it never promoted it and never
[2:55:38.440 --> 2:55:43.000]  took it as advertising and never did even though I had to sit here and hear it on local stations
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:50.280]  and hear it promoted my name because the Lord knows I try to be good but I can't control everybody
[2:55:50.280 --> 2:56:02.920]  around me and I told people I said I can understand this and I see it as a scam and there's promoters
[2:56:02.920 --> 2:56:07.480]  and speculators creating bubbles and Ponzi schemes and I will not be involved even I could tell my
[2:56:07.480 --> 2:56:14.200]  audience hey get involved in this it's a bubble I'll tell you when to get out well why not rob banks
[2:56:14.200 --> 2:56:19.000]  why not be Robert Muller then and you know let Jeffrey Epstein run child kidnapping rings for
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:28.760]  you you know if you're going to go bad why not go all the way but see I've chosen a different path
[2:56:31.960 --> 2:56:35.080]  and I think they've already figured it out and it's not just me it's all of you
[2:56:35.080 --> 2:56:40.120]  you see what we are is the lethal injection to the new world order
[2:56:44.040 --> 2:56:49.720]  and they just now figured it out you see I didn't say that that powerful because I don't
[2:56:49.720 --> 2:56:57.000]  love death I don't like death but I had to recognize it that info wars is the angel of death
[2:56:57.800 --> 2:57:02.040]  that's why they're so scared so they call us most dangerous people in the world and
[2:57:02.040 --> 2:57:06.360]  we were to destroy the world and all these publications and why must be and it's the truth
[2:57:07.480 --> 2:57:15.400]  because to death life coming back to the world is death and so I am the grim reaper so are you
[2:57:16.280 --> 2:57:23.160]  for these people and I'm not knocking anybody was involved in all the bitcoin permutations but
[2:57:23.160 --> 2:57:33.080]  I wouldn't promote it to you because my spirit told me it was a scam to discredit other cryptocurrencies
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:38.440]  coming in the future doesn't mean all of it's bad but it still means that it's a fraud

[2:59:58.520 --> 3:00:07.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live
[3:00:07.320 --> 3:00:11.480]  from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[3:00:15.960 --> 3:00:20.520]  Owen Benjamin one of the top comedians in the country put into the fandom zones joining us
[3:00:20.520 --> 3:00:26.280]  15 minutes because i'm in a bad boy i'm stealing 50 minutes of the hour he's
[3:00:26.280 --> 3:00:32.040]  grace you should have to host go to your phone calls trucker vet in fema region nine that means
[3:00:32.040 --> 3:00:35.560]  he's out on the west coast you're on the other thing for holding brother go ahead
[3:00:35.560 --> 3:00:43.640]  hey alex uh great to talk to you um you talked a couple segments ago about uh engaging thinkers
[3:00:43.640 --> 3:00:49.400]  i'd like to think of myself as a thinker maybe you can engage me in a little dialogue maybe we
[3:00:49.400 --> 3:00:56.680]  can come up with um an idea or two that could be so revolutionary that it would it would be the
[3:00:56.680 --> 3:01:02.840]  final nails in the coffin but i don't think i i don't think we're anywhere close to that yet
[3:01:02.840 --> 3:01:09.480]  because it's so simple the globalist or multinational corporations who pay no tax
[3:01:09.480 --> 3:01:14.040]  are diplomatically immune above the law telling us to all fight with each other
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:19.960]  and get rid of our nation states to loot our public treasury so if we just renounce globalism
[3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:27.640]  and go back to nationalism and localism and and cultural icons of success and get back to
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:35.080]  competition we will win i mean it's all right there okay uh and on and on the subject that you
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:39.720]  brought up what's another thing that we could renounce and and that would put everybody that
[3:01:39.720 --> 3:01:45.960]  would put the common person once the common person renounces this then it's not just alex jones
[3:01:45.960 --> 3:01:53.320]  and renounce the smartphones renounce the gmo tell me what to renounce i'm ready uh here we go
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:58.040]  not necessarily for you you're on the front lines but for everybody else that's had enough and that
[3:01:58.040 --> 3:02:04.440]  wants to say you know what i'm in this fight too and this we would even be challenging our president
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:12.440]  to say hey uh buy your own principles of uh the book that you wrote uh the art of the deal
[3:02:12.440 --> 3:02:21.240]  you don't pay contractors that that break their contract you stop paying and and uh also something
[3:02:21.240 --> 3:02:26.600]  else that you brought up um probably a little over a week ago yes the social contract has
[3:02:26.600 --> 3:02:34.200]  been broken the social contract by the powers to be that they have broken their contract with us
[3:02:34.200 --> 3:02:40.760]  therefore we have a right to say you know what you've broken that contract i am no longer paying
[3:02:40.760 --> 3:02:50.200]  my federal income taxes and i dare the president to um i dare president trump to come in and protect
[3:02:50.200 --> 3:02:59.320]  people that are doing that because um uh because we are acting just why why should we pay uh trucker vet
[3:02:59.320 --> 3:03:05.880]  you are you are infinity correct i just can't give people advice in their own lives and then
[3:03:05.880 --> 3:03:10.120]  they do it wrong or however and then they get in big trouble because the mafia comes to break their
[3:03:10.120 --> 3:03:15.640]  legs and it's my fault but yes the social contract has been broken trump's trying to fix it he's
[3:03:15.640 --> 3:03:19.960]  trying to set up a level playing field bring back prosperity so we're not forcing the welfare and
[3:03:19.960 --> 3:03:25.880]  and uh bondage uh and you're absolutely right that the system is out of control the illegal aliens
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:31.080]  don't follow the social contract the democrats don't follow it the eu doesn't follow it they're all
[3:03:31.080 --> 3:03:35.000]  tax exempt in fact i said that before you even brought up your point because it's all the truth of
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:41.480]  this but right but so we're trying to get the social contract back because third the third world
[3:03:41.480 --> 3:03:46.840]  has a broken social contract everybody knows it civilization is about a social contract limited
[3:03:46.840 --> 3:03:54.680]  government around main ideas that promote human empowerment right okay right so therefore the
[3:03:54.680 --> 3:03:59.480]  common person if you want to get in this game one way to do it is to stop paying your federal
[3:03:59.480 --> 3:04:04.440]  income taxes and at the same time we're kind of making it a little more dangerous for trump
[3:04:04.440 --> 3:04:11.800]  but say hey everybody everybody that does this uh you need the parts that are not here here's a
[3:04:11.800 --> 3:04:14.920]  problem and then and then they have a white supremacist works for the southern property law
[3:04:14.920 --> 3:04:21.720]  center that does it and embarrasses trump here's the issue we have to say it's broken ourselves
[3:04:21.720 --> 3:04:27.240]  trump can't do it all and we have to stand up be made be made an incredibly good point here
[3:04:27.240 --> 3:04:31.160]  and we have to realize that that's where this is gone and reach out to other people but here's
[3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:36.200]  the problem the globalist control the actuaries and the fiat currency the banks they don't even
[3:04:36.200 --> 3:04:41.800]  need the tax money bro that's all to siphon off the economy they raise taxes to kill recoveries
[3:04:41.800 --> 3:04:47.720]  so at the point of i don't blame people that don't pay taxes as things are a fraud as long as
[3:04:47.720 --> 3:04:50.280]  they're not pulling welfare do whatever you have to do
[3:04:53.960 --> 3:04:58.120]  in the last few months in full wars has been escalating our sales to clear out
[3:04:58.120 --> 3:05:02.360]  inventory of many of our best-selling items and then i came up with the idea last week let's not
[3:05:02.360 --> 3:05:08.280]  just extend the sale free shipping store wide 50 to 75 off double patriot points let's extend that
[3:05:08.280 --> 3:05:15.080]  sale but also add a free gift with every order even if it's a tube of fluoride free colloidal
[3:05:15.080 --> 3:05:21.560]  silver iodine fortified super blue you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies
[3:05:21.560 --> 3:05:25.560]  last and what i mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out
[3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:30.840]  so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out
[3:05:30.840 --> 3:05:35.080]  and then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days
[3:05:35.080 --> 3:05:40.920]  we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had so this is a loss leader we are losing
[3:05:40.920 --> 3:05:45.240]  money on this this is our biggest sale ever get your free gift your free shipping everything
[3:05:45.240 --> 3:05:50.200]  and don't fight the crowds in four store dot com in four's life dot com or triple eight two five

[3:07:26.200 --> 3:07:32.280]  know about uh the uh prince intelligence uh shooter the jackal all of it i believe me
[3:07:33.080 --> 3:07:40.760]  yes well her husband was george demorin shield uh also a questionable intelligence white russian
[3:07:40.760 --> 3:07:48.040]  in the oil business who arranged for oswald to be introduced to the community in dallas
[3:07:48.040 --> 3:07:53.080]  and who arranged for the job for him to believe me i know all about the community in dallas i grew
[3:07:53.080 --> 3:08:02.440]  up there and oswald uh got the job at the repository there um mister um demorin shield
[3:08:02.440 --> 3:08:08.680]  was associated in the oil business with george uh herbert walker bush who who was in the cia
[3:08:08.680 --> 3:08:14.440]  was he classified in 1979 in hearings that he was involved running an operation and when he was called
[3:08:14.440 --> 3:08:19.880]  to testify the second time around in the late sixties he contacted george herbert walker bush
[3:08:19.880 --> 3:08:25.960]  for help um he subsequently uh shot himself he killed himself of course he did about the
[3:08:25.960 --> 3:08:29.240]  yeah but then they had the church hearings later in the seventies and it all came out
[3:08:30.120 --> 3:08:33.960]  yes let me tell you something i'm not gonna get into the details but my grandmother my mom's mom

[3:08:44.920 --> 3:08:49.400]  i'm gonna get into it before that the point is it was all a big joke in austin and dallas she was

[3:08:53.640 --> 3:08:58.840]  that son of a bitch yeah i mean it wasn't even i mean around here by just brags about it i mean
[3:08:58.840 --> 3:09:05.560]  we all know who the shooters are everything around here because when i watched the video the movie
[3:09:05.560 --> 3:09:12.600]  and i noticed that the movie was so steady the hand held steady shot i always suspected something
[3:09:12.600 --> 3:09:17.960]  i didn't subsequently followed up because you know french agents were here in quebec in canada
[3:09:17.960 --> 3:09:23.560]  trying to get back to separate and it turns out that madame le gond arranged for the video of the
[3:09:23.560 --> 3:09:29.720]  brooder which nobody had seen for charles the goals to see and he watched it on the day that
[3:09:29.720 --> 3:09:36.040]  kennedy was shot that day was his birthday your um uh the goal is a little bit of message
[3:09:36.040 --> 3:09:41.640]  with jacal who kicked out the german e u plan and sees the nuclear weapons in a silent coup
[3:09:41.640 --> 3:09:46.600]  it was a threat to the goal correct and it was charles the goal that had told earlier before
[3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:51.400]  the assassination to president nixon that he had a very good chance of becoming president
[3:09:51.400 --> 3:09:56.600]  of the united states um there's so much more of course you can get in but i want to just remind
[3:09:56.600 --> 3:10:02.120]  you that it's heartbreaking because we in canada love president kennedy as well we were kids that
[3:10:02.120 --> 3:10:07.240]  was 12 years old and only subsequently when visiting his grave with my parents a couple of
[3:10:07.240 --> 3:10:13.160]  years later it was the grave was just uh on the ground with a torch lit we were there my parents
[3:10:13.160 --> 3:10:18.680]  and my brother speaking spanish and very sad when a couple walked behind us and approached us and
[3:10:18.680 --> 3:10:26.120]  very quietly we we looked over and here was captain ahab it was uh the actor gregory peck and his wife
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:31.880]  and we were all quiet there at the grave and he meant so much to us because of kennedy and of
[3:10:31.880 --> 3:10:38.200]  course uh this famous actor and uh his wife said oh you speak spanish and we just couldn't say much
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:44.600]  just other than it was so sad we walked away you know president kennedy was a person who had every
[3:10:44.600 --> 3:10:50.040]  opportunity to do his job as president and only cowards rely on assassinations no you're right
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:54.360]  i wasn't finishing your story to let me sound smart i want people to know it's not made up
[3:10:54.360 --> 3:10:59.160]  it's actually well known they had french intelligence they had the military there
[3:10:59.160 --> 3:11:03.880]  they had the italian mafias they could blame any group they wanted to but we know who was put on the
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:09.960]  trigger and it was he howard hunt he wasn't just a benchwarmer he was a famous uh super long shot
[3:11:09.960 --> 3:11:16.280]  guy from uh the uh pre-war uh before world war two in china and he was one of the guys that
[3:11:16.280 --> 3:11:21.320]  pulled the trigger along with uh some of the other boys there thank you carlos gotta move quick now
[3:11:21.320 --> 3:11:24.520]  so i said i won't give a call or five minutes i just gave him five minutes the caller was so good
[3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:31.080]  john in massachusetts you're on the air how's globalism all play out tell me it's great to be
[3:11:31.080 --> 3:11:37.800]  with you um you know globalism is now dead and they can't put the toothpaste back into the tube
[3:11:37.800 --> 3:11:42.280]  you see people that are rising up and really donald trump has been the big change in the
[3:11:42.280 --> 3:11:48.840]  whole thing from the guy that's fighting on our side and um you know it's just absolutely amazing
[3:11:48.840 --> 3:11:54.360]  you see the people rising up in france chanting that they want trump um there is far more support
[3:11:54.360 --> 3:11:59.480]  out there than the mainstream would ever let us know and they cover it up and you know just a
[3:11:59.480 --> 3:12:03.320]  message oh yeah they'll be totally won the election all the other elections were winning
[3:12:03.320 --> 3:12:09.080]  and all the evidences they stole it oh 100 percent and you know what we'll get those back to and the
[3:12:09.080 --> 3:12:13.720]  truth will come out we have um the department of homely insecurity is going to put out that i was
[3:12:13.720 --> 3:12:18.280]  about to say we'll just indict all these democrats they're the ones started all this we're going to
[3:12:18.280 --> 3:12:23.560]  finish it and you know just to leave you with a final thought and a message for the globalist
[3:12:23.560 --> 3:12:29.000]  you know one day every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:33.640]  and they can have their power on earth they can work on their life extension technology to prevent
[3:12:33.640 --> 3:12:38.440]  themselves from going to hell but at the end of the day you know jesus has the final say
[3:12:38.440 --> 3:12:42.760]  and they're going to pay for what they've done to the people on this planet and um you know that's
[3:12:42.760 --> 3:12:46.520]  going to be the real justice i agree john god bless you i can tell you why the right wing in
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:51.720]  texas was pissed kennedy did some things made him mad and he was going really fast on a lot of things
[3:12:51.720 --> 3:12:57.000]  that i agree with like civil rights and all that but then they thought the killing of kennedy was to
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:13:02.840]  stop the new old order and it got worse that's why they're so pissed and that's a little inside
[3:13:02.840 --> 3:13:09.880]  baseball because texas is the reason the president's dead to quote the misfits uh let's talk to uh
[3:13:09.880 --> 3:13:14.440]  who's up next year he's been holding along just uh so and benjamin's awesome i want to cut him to
[3:13:14.440 --> 3:13:19.320]  him i want to take your calls i only said take ten calls he's like 20 here derek in florida

[3:13:25.480 --> 3:13:31.880]  thank god bless you man i was curious what your opinion was on hw's funeral being scheduled
[3:13:31.880 --> 3:13:36.600]  for wednesday december 5th which is the same day that the congressional oversight committee was
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:40.680]  scheduled to meet with huber regarding his investigation into the clinton foundation
[3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:46.440]  i think it's interesting and they got the stock market closed but we'll see what happens i mean
[3:13:46.440 --> 3:13:52.600]  george hw bush was a horrible globalist i don't celebrate his death or anything it's just i do
[3:13:52.600 --> 3:13:59.560]  see it as a kind of an arc type of how globalism isn't so much trouble what do you think um yeah i
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:04.520]  agree um i mean i noticed though that they did postpone the the hearing with huber and that was
[3:14:04.520 --> 3:14:08.520]  a little bit disappointing i've been waiting patiently for a few weeks now to see that happen
[3:14:09.240 --> 3:14:13.560]  so i also was you know kind of curious do you think that once that hearing does take place
[3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:17.400]  are they gonna start releasing some of those findings into the public or do you think they're
[3:14:17.400 --> 3:14:23.160]  going to continue to you know kind of keep this silent war behind you know public scrutiny oh the
[3:14:23.160 --> 3:14:28.120]  deep stated thought it was invincible and it's committed all these unbelievable crimes that's
[3:14:28.120 --> 3:14:32.760]  what they're fighting so hard is to keep the national security act in place keep it going forever so
[3:14:32.760 --> 3:14:41.560]  they can classify things out to infinity because they ever get caught they go down and that's why
[3:14:41.560 --> 3:14:48.360]  dc is just full of all these cowardly lawyers who are just in this incredible sycophantic worship
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:54.200]  fest uh of these globalists i mean i've been in some of these meetings off record not selling out
[3:14:54.200 --> 3:15:00.600]  but just in meetings with people that wanted to meet and this is the sycophantic way they all

[3:20:14.840 --> 3:20:19.960]  All right, well, John and Mega Titan and Ken and Jim, we're going to get to get on air,
[3:20:19.960 --> 3:20:23.800]  but Owen Benjamin, this happens with the magic of sky, cannot get our audio.
[3:20:23.800 --> 3:20:27.080]  If we have to in the next segment, I'll just over phone let him know he's on air,
[3:20:27.080 --> 3:20:30.920]  so I want to hear what he has to say and host because he's a shot after comedian and really smart
[3:20:30.920 --> 3:20:35.800]  guy, but John in Wyoming, I'm going from memory, but is this the guy that was at the 1980 convention
[3:20:35.800 --> 3:20:38.040]  who's been calling for like 20 years on the show?
[3:20:38.040 --> 3:20:40.920]  Only calls in when we talk about Ronald Reagan and George Robert Walker Bush.
[3:20:40.920 --> 3:20:44.040]  Is this that John or another John? John, welcome to the airwaves.
[3:20:44.040 --> 3:20:45.080]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[3:20:45.960 --> 3:20:51.320]  It's the John who told the anti-gunners at the Houston NRA convention.
[3:20:51.320 --> 3:20:53.080]  Fill your hand, USOB.
[3:20:53.960 --> 3:20:54.600]  You're awesome.
[3:20:54.600 --> 3:20:58.280]  And we're going to, I'm always a year behind, but we're getting you ready to be hosting a show soon.
[3:20:58.280 --> 3:20:59.480]  So we got your number.
[3:20:59.480 --> 3:20:59.800]  Get ready.
[3:20:59.800 --> 3:21:00.840]  I had her for you in six months.
[3:21:00.840 --> 3:21:01.720]  Good to have you here.
[3:21:01.720 --> 3:21:04.680]  What do you make of this George Herbert Walker Bush worship and all of it?
[3:21:05.320 --> 3:21:06.760]  Well, here's the whole point.
[3:21:06.760 --> 3:21:13.640]  I knew that he was a scoundrel from way back because when I was living in Houston in 1968,
[3:21:13.640 --> 3:21:17.560]  he was my congressman from the 22nd congressional district,
[3:21:17.560 --> 3:21:21.720]  and he voted for the gun control act of 1968.
[3:21:22.280 --> 3:21:28.120]  Then three years later, when he was Nixon's UN ambassador, when they voted to illegally expel
[3:21:28.760 --> 3:21:33.640]  nationalist China from the security council and replace them with communist China,
[3:21:33.640 --> 3:21:34.600]  he abstained.
[3:21:34.600 --> 3:21:38.200]  He allowed that vote to go through when he could have vetoed it.
[3:21:38.200 --> 3:21:45.320]  Also, when he was Reagan's vice president, remember Reagan, one good thing Reagan did
[3:21:45.320 --> 3:21:51.640]  is he built up the Navy to over 600 surface ships and submarines so America would be strong.
[3:21:51.640 --> 3:21:57.640]  And as soon as Bush became president, he started dismantling the Navy and scrapping
[3:21:57.640 --> 3:22:03.800]  hundreds of surface ships and submarines to weaken this country so we would be vulnerable.
[3:22:03.800 --> 3:22:09.960]  Also, while he was a CFR member, he was also on the board of directors of the CFR
[3:22:09.960 --> 3:22:13.160]  from 1977 to 1979.
[3:22:13.160 --> 3:22:16.840]  And let's not forget Reagan and Goldwater gave speeches against him directly.
[3:22:17.720 --> 3:22:18.120]  Right.
[3:22:18.120 --> 3:22:25.560]  And what Goldwater wrote in his wonderful 1979 book with no apologies, page 126,
[3:22:25.560 --> 3:22:28.920]  for those of you who think the CFR is some innocuous group,
[3:22:28.920 --> 3:22:35.240]  Goldwater wrote, the CFR is the American branch of the society which originated in England.
[3:22:35.240 --> 3:22:41.400]  Internationalist in viewpoint, the CFR, along with the Atlantic Union movement and the Atlantic
[3:22:41.400 --> 3:22:48.680]  Council of the United States, believes national boundaries should be obliterated and one world
[3:22:48.680 --> 3:22:50.040]  rule established.
[3:22:50.040 --> 3:22:55.480]  And again, that's that Cecil Rhodes and again, then it's not like Kumbaya World
[3:22:55.480 --> 3:22:58.920]  Government, it's a world government run by them, they're above the law.
[3:22:58.920 --> 3:23:03.560]  And so his death, the Clintons can't fill any stadiums, even 10 percent.
[3:23:03.560 --> 3:23:07.960]  This is all seen as a symbolic, really death of the New World Order.
[3:23:07.960 --> 3:23:09.960]  What do you make of that, John?
[3:23:09.960 --> 3:23:11.480]  I agree.
[3:23:11.480 --> 3:23:17.240]  And remember, for the 208 weeks that Bush was president, that's fourfold years,
[3:23:17.800 --> 3:23:24.200]  he made over 208 speeches mentioning the term New World Order over and over.
[3:23:24.200 --> 3:23:28.040]  Which is the UN running our country, and then it's well known that he actually
[3:23:28.040 --> 3:23:30.520]  ran the Clintons and the CIA, that's what he classified,
[3:23:31.480 --> 3:23:33.320]  with Cord Meyer and a bunch of other people.
[3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:34.920]  And so what happened is.
[3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:42.200]  And he also, he was also the only adult in Dallas, Texas on November 22nd, 1963,
[3:23:42.200 --> 3:23:45.320]  who could not remember what he was doing that day.
[3:23:45.960 --> 3:23:50.520]  But it did turn out he was photographed there outside the book, the repository building,
[3:23:50.520 --> 3:23:52.440]  and then he was in the CIA.
[3:23:52.440 --> 3:23:55.480]  You know, they always said he wasn't in the CIA, but then he became the director of it
[3:23:55.480 --> 3:23:56.760]  out of nowhere in the 70s.
[3:23:57.400 --> 3:23:58.840]  So here's the bottom line.
[3:23:58.840 --> 3:24:02.920]  He was a horrible globalist who parlayed American power.
[3:24:02.920 --> 3:24:07.720]  His family were always social climbers, just like they were the head Nazi agents.
[3:24:07.720 --> 3:24:13.800]  I mean, these people were always the folks that were trying to climb and get into power.
[3:24:13.800 --> 3:24:17.400]  And now the Clintons and Obama were all in extension
[3:24:17.400 --> 3:24:21.800]  of their stay behind group in the CIA, and Trump is breaking that right now.
[3:24:21.800 --> 3:24:23.320]  And you can see how hard they're fighting.
[3:24:23.880 --> 3:24:27.240]  You can see how hard they're fighting because this is that they're having their,
[3:24:27.240 --> 3:24:29.080]  their, their deep state is being broken.
[3:24:29.880 --> 3:24:33.000]  They're going to try to assassinate President Trump.
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:33.640]  I feel it.
[3:24:34.200 --> 3:24:35.960]  And I think I'm funny.
[3:24:35.960 --> 3:24:41.320]  You said that I had a dream last night that I went and saw Trump lying in state
[3:24:41.320 --> 3:24:43.560]  like a debtor in a doornail.
[3:24:43.560 --> 3:24:44.840]  And I hope that doesn't happen.
[3:24:44.840 --> 3:24:47.000]  But I'm telling you, it's an archetypal worry.
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:49.160]  I'm telling you, they know they can't beat him.
[3:24:49.160 --> 3:24:50.200]  They're going to try to kill him.
[3:24:50.200 --> 3:24:50.520]  I agree.
[3:24:50.520 --> 3:24:51.080]  I agree.
[3:24:51.080 --> 3:24:55.960]  The same way with JFK because JFK, before they murdered him,
[3:24:55.960 --> 3:25:01.400]  issued executive order 11110 on June 4th, 1963,
[3:25:01.400 --> 3:25:06.200]  which recalled these fraudulent Federal Reserve notes and replaced them with debt.
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:07.160]  Oh, he said, you do it.
[3:25:07.160 --> 3:25:07.960]  And let me bring this up.
[3:25:07.960 --> 3:25:11.480]  Anytime I feel sorry for myself at the lawsuits, the threats, the attacks,
[3:25:11.480 --> 3:25:15.160]  I think about how much more Trump's lost $2 billion, his whole family under attack.
[3:25:15.640 --> 3:25:18.040]  And I just think about what he's gone through for this country.
[3:25:18.600 --> 3:25:20.200]  And, you know, there is a God.
[3:25:20.200 --> 3:25:21.960]  I mean, literally, and I'm not trying to kiss Trump's butt.
[3:25:21.960 --> 3:25:22.680]  It's true.
[3:25:22.680 --> 3:25:25.000]  God gave us Donald Trump at this moment,
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:27.880]  and all these other nationalists are winning everywhere else,
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:31.640]  and they're stabbing them in the stomach and shooting at him and threatening him.
[3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:33.400]  This is a war for humanity, brother.
[3:25:33.400 --> 3:25:34.280]  This is real.
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:35.480]  Trump is real.
[3:25:35.480 --> 3:25:36.360]  He is real.
[3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:43.000]  When you see all the Trump haters on the network news media praising and worshiping
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:45.640]  at the altar of George Herbert Walker Bush,
[3:25:45.640 --> 3:25:47.800]  you know that they're birds of a feather.
[3:25:47.800 --> 3:25:49.560]  But I agree.
[3:25:49.560 --> 3:25:52.680]  But when we get persecuted for supporting Trump,
[3:25:53.480 --> 3:25:55.880]  it doesn't make it easier knowing what he's gone through.
[3:25:55.880 --> 3:25:58.440]  I mean, people think everybody asks, how are you doing?
[3:25:58.440 --> 3:25:59.480]  How are you taking it?
[3:25:59.480 --> 3:26:00.920]  And I'm like, I've never been better.
[3:26:00.920 --> 3:26:02.280]  I mean, I'm doing what I'm supposed to.
[3:26:02.280 --> 3:26:03.880]  I'm in a war for my country.
[3:26:03.880 --> 3:26:06.520]  And I've got a president that I know is for real.
[3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:08.680]  This is what we ask God for this.
[3:26:09.480 --> 3:26:11.400]  This isn't a bad thing, what I'm saying, John.
[3:26:12.280 --> 3:26:14.920]  Well, I still think that sooner or later,
[3:26:14.920 --> 3:26:17.400]  what the globalists are going to realize,
[3:26:17.400 --> 3:26:19.160]  I don't care how much money you have.
[3:26:19.160 --> 3:26:21.560]  Look at that idiot, Michael Bloomberg,
[3:26:21.560 --> 3:26:23.640]  who said two years ago when he dies,
[3:26:23.640 --> 3:26:25.720]  he knows he's going straight to heaven
[3:26:25.720 --> 3:26:28.120]  and he won't have any time for any interviews.
[3:26:28.120 --> 3:26:29.720]  Well, I have news for them.
[3:26:29.720 --> 3:26:32.360]  They'd better get used to extremely hot weather
[3:26:32.360 --> 3:26:35.160]  because when Jesus judges these people,
[3:26:35.160 --> 3:26:37.000]  they're going straight to hell.
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:39.480]  Do not pass, go, do not collect 200.
[3:26:39.480 --> 3:26:40.120]  No, I agree.
[3:26:40.120 --> 3:26:42.440]  But let's just get back to Trump.
[3:26:43.320 --> 3:26:46.920]  He has gone through living hell and he only gets stronger at 72.
[3:26:46.920 --> 3:26:49.000]  I'm 45 and I can handle it.
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:51.640]  But my God, I mean, who could give it?
[3:26:51.640 --> 3:26:53.880]  Something like Reagan didn't have the stamina.
[3:26:53.880 --> 3:26:57.400]  I mean, and they all bitch and snipe and spin everything he does.
[3:26:57.400 --> 3:26:59.640]  But if you really shit back and look at Trump,
[3:26:59.640 --> 3:27:01.000]  he is a godsend.
[3:27:02.520 --> 3:27:05.480]  He cares about the American people,
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:07.560]  something these globalist low-lifes
[3:27:07.560 --> 3:27:10.840]  like the Bushes and the Clintons and the Obamas
[3:27:10.840 --> 3:27:11.480]  and the rest of them.
[3:27:11.480 --> 3:27:13.800]  They think it's weak to care about people.
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:15.480]  They think it's weak to care about people.
[3:27:15.480 --> 3:27:17.960]  Well, it isn't weak.
[3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:21.000]  It means that he has a good Christian heart
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:24.200]  and he is following God's commandments
[3:27:24.200 --> 3:27:27.000]  and he is doing what is best for America
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:30.920]  and for the American people and the globalist be damned.
[3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:35.320]  It means they stand for nothing but their own damn power.
[3:27:35.320 --> 3:27:36.440]  It's unbelievable.
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:37.560]  All right, God bless you, John.
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:38.360]  I appreciate your call.
[3:27:38.360 --> 3:27:42.200]  Did we get on Benjamin's Skype working?
[3:27:42.200 --> 3:27:47.000]  All right, well, we'll go to him be a phone
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:49.320]  because he'll be Skype audio, but he'll have phones.
[3:27:49.320 --> 3:27:50.920]  I'll introduce him, bring him in.
[3:27:50.920 --> 3:27:52.440]  When we come back, wow.
[3:27:53.400 --> 3:27:53.960]  Look, it's true.
[3:27:54.840 --> 3:27:56.120]  I don't care about Hollywood.
[3:27:56.120 --> 3:27:57.640]  I don't care about being on red carpets.
[3:27:58.200 --> 3:28:00.280]  I don't care, but they tried to buy me off of all that.
[3:28:00.280 --> 3:28:02.280]  But some people said, oh, why are you supporting Trump?
[3:28:02.280 --> 3:28:03.880]  Just give up on Trump.
[3:28:03.880 --> 3:28:06.600]  I mean, I was even told, I'm not going to say that.
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:09.960]  I can't say this, but let's just say
[3:28:09.960 --> 3:28:11.960]  I've been threatened with him taking everything
[3:28:11.960 --> 3:28:15.320]  I've got, my children, everything.
[3:28:15.880 --> 3:28:18.520]  And the other day I told the system, I'm not doing it.
[3:28:20.120 --> 3:28:24.440]  But the average person cannot deal with that level of oppression.
[3:28:25.800 --> 3:28:27.400]  And that's what we're dealing with here.
[3:28:27.400 --> 3:28:31.560]  So it's up to those of us that can, they're built for this to do it.
[3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:33.480]  And that's what it comes down to.
[3:28:34.600 --> 3:28:37.000]  And once you're built for this, you realize it's like a joke.
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:40.360]  Built for this.
[3:28:42.040 --> 3:28:45.240]  What I'm not built for is rolling over on my belly
[3:28:45.240 --> 3:28:47.000]  and letting these wolves pull my guts out.
[3:28:47.000 --> 3:29:07.000]  Yeah, I'm built for survival.
[3:29:17.000 --> 3:29:20.440]  It's also perfect to wrap around your legs, knees or shoulder and neck.
[3:29:20.440 --> 3:29:22.280]  But I need to know their good quality.

[3:31:29.400 --> 3:31:34.360]  get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[3:31:34.360 --> 3:31:38.440]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.
[3:31:38.440 --> 3:31:42.040]  This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality.
[3:31:42.040 --> 3:31:47.080]  So I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's too late.
[3:31:47.080 --> 3:31:53.720]  Unleash the SuperMail in you with SuperMailVitality from InfowarsStore.com.
[3:31:53.720 --> 3:31:57.880]  In the last few months, Infowars has been escalating our sales to clear out
[3:31:57.880 --> 3:32:00.120]  inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[3:32:00.120 --> 3:32:01.720]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[3:32:01.720 --> 3:32:04.200]  Let's not just extend the sale free shipping store-wide,
[3:32:04.200 --> 3:32:06.680]  50 to 75% off double-patriot points.
[3:32:06.680 --> 3:32:12.760]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[3:32:12.760 --> 3:32:16.840]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine, 4 to 5 super blue,
[3:32:16.840 --> 3:32:21.640]  you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[3:32:21.640 --> 3:32:25.320]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[3:32:25.320 --> 3:32:30.680]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[3:32:30.680 --> 3:32:33.240]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[3:32:33.240 --> 3:32:38.520]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[3:32:38.520 --> 3:32:40.040]  So this is a loss leader.
[3:32:40.040 --> 3:32:41.560]  We are losing money on this.
[3:32:41.560 --> 3:32:43.000]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[3:32:43.000 --> 3:32:45.000]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[3:32:45.000 --> 3:32:49.720]  And don't fight the crowds in FullWorksStore.com, in FullWarsLive.com, or triple-eight, two,
[3:32:49.720 --> 3:32:51.400]  five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:32:51.400 --> 3:32:53.400]  God bless you and thank you for your support.
[3:32:57.160 --> 3:33:05.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:11.560 --> 3:33:12.840]  All right, Owen Benjamin.
[3:33:12.840 --> 3:33:16.360]  We really appreciate him hosting once a week for a full-hour top comedian.
[3:33:16.360 --> 3:33:18.600]  One of the most banned people in the world, Owen Benjamin.
[3:33:18.600 --> 3:33:19.480]  Huge pianist.
[3:33:19.480 --> 3:33:20.600]  That doesn't mean pee-pee.
[3:33:20.600 --> 3:33:21.640]  It means piano.
[3:33:21.640 --> 3:33:26.760]  He's a six-foot-six big linebacker looking guy, or NFL lineman looking guy.
[3:33:26.760 --> 3:33:27.880]  Plays the piano quite well.
[3:33:27.880 --> 3:33:29.240]  HugePianist.com.
[3:33:29.240 --> 3:33:33.240]  He's taking over right now on the right shotgun because his Skype doesn't get audio from us.
[3:33:33.880 --> 3:33:35.880]  So that when he goes in and out of breaks, I'll be here.
[3:33:35.880 --> 3:33:37.720]  Just briefly, because I didn't plug last hour.
[3:33:37.720 --> 3:33:39.400]  I get so caught up in the news that we don't do this.
[3:33:39.400 --> 3:33:40.040]  We won't be here.
[3:33:40.040 --> 3:33:46.040]  You know George Soros openly has gone after our payment processors and taken five of six.
[3:33:46.040 --> 3:33:47.560]  They're trying to shut down our shopping cart.
[3:33:48.840 --> 3:33:52.520]  As long as your order gets in, we'll get it out to you.
[3:33:52.520 --> 3:33:57.160]  We're selling everything out at sales 30, 40, 50% bigger than we ever done.
[3:33:58.680 --> 3:34:00.360]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[3:34:00.360 --> 3:34:02.040]  We have 50 to 75% off.
[3:34:02.040 --> 3:34:03.400]  That means the lowest sale.
[3:34:03.400 --> 3:34:05.240]  Everything's 50 to 75% off.
[3:34:05.240 --> 3:34:06.120]  50 is the lowest.
[3:34:06.120 --> 3:34:07.400]  Everything's 50% off.
[3:34:07.400 --> 3:34:10.200]  Storeable food, water filtration, air filtration.
[3:34:10.200 --> 3:34:11.800]  50 to 75% off.
[3:34:12.680 --> 3:34:15.800]  And double-patriot points out of 5%, 10%.
[3:34:15.800 --> 3:34:17.960]  So 10 cents on every dollar towards your future purchase.
[3:34:18.680 --> 3:34:20.200]  And a free t-shirt.
[3:34:20.200 --> 3:34:22.040]  They printed 5,000 of this bad boy.
[3:34:22.040 --> 3:34:23.080]  It'll go in a couple of days.
[3:34:23.080 --> 3:34:23.880]  We'll have the next shirt.
[3:34:24.600 --> 3:34:26.280]  And we are all Alex Jones.
[3:34:26.280 --> 3:34:28.680]  Not my idea, but the news has all pointed that out.
[3:34:28.680 --> 3:34:30.120]  Even Ted Cruz did that.
[3:34:30.120 --> 3:34:32.280]  And it says, don't censor me with a gas and flag.
[3:34:32.280 --> 3:34:36.280]  You get that free in every order on top of it.
[3:34:36.280 --> 3:34:38.440]  So you want to trigger folks?
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:38.920]  There it is.
[3:34:38.920 --> 3:34:42.920]  Very nice, soft black t-shirt with the Gadsden snake on it.
[3:34:42.920 --> 3:34:43.960]  Infowarstore.com.
[3:34:43.960 --> 3:34:45.160]  But don't battle the crowds.
[3:34:45.160 --> 3:34:46.120]  This is a pretty easy sell.
[3:34:47.240 --> 3:34:48.120]  Don't battle the crowds.
[3:34:48.120 --> 3:34:49.400]  Don't battle the traffic.
[3:34:49.400 --> 3:34:50.200]  Get supplements.
[3:34:50.200 --> 3:34:50.840]  Get videos.
[3:34:50.840 --> 3:34:51.320]  Get books.
[3:34:51.320 --> 3:34:51.960]  Get t-shirts.
[3:34:51.960 --> 3:34:52.920]  Get materials.
[3:34:52.920 --> 3:34:56.040]  And fund the Infowar and Infowarstore.com.
[3:34:56.040 --> 3:34:57.560]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[3:34:58.600 --> 3:35:00.440]  And without you, we will not be here.
[3:35:00.440 --> 3:35:02.600]  But quite frankly, most of these are lost leaders.
[3:35:02.600 --> 3:35:04.680]  We're clearing out the warehouse, so please take action.
[3:35:04.680 --> 3:35:06.760]  Okay, it's not his fault.
[3:35:06.760 --> 3:35:07.640]  Skype is crazy.
[3:35:07.640 --> 3:35:08.600]  It's a great technology.
[3:35:08.600 --> 3:35:09.720]  You never figure it out.
[3:35:09.720 --> 3:35:13.320]  Owen Benjamin of hugepianist.com censored
[3:35:13.320 --> 3:35:15.800]  because he doesn't want five-year-olds to be taught
[3:35:15.800 --> 3:35:17.720]  how to suck golf balls through garden hoses.
[3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:19.720]  I believe there's two genders.
[3:35:19.720 --> 3:35:21.560]  He also believes two plus two equals four.
[3:35:21.560 --> 3:35:23.080]  Another thought crime he committed.
[3:35:23.080 --> 3:35:24.360]  Which I almost don't forget him for.
[3:35:24.360 --> 3:35:25.400]  That one's really racist.
[3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:27.560]  But Owen, thank you for joining us
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:28.920]  and tell us what you got coming up today.
[3:35:29.880 --> 3:35:31.560]  Oh, thanks for having me out.
[3:35:31.560 --> 3:35:36.520]  I'm going to discuss my namesake of my website, hugepianist.
[3:35:36.520 --> 3:35:37.560]  We're going to talk about music.
[3:35:37.560 --> 3:35:39.160]  I got a piano right here.
[3:35:39.160 --> 3:35:40.840]  And we're going to talk about the power of music
[3:35:40.840 --> 3:35:43.000]  and comedy and why it's so censored.
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:46.360]  I'm about to embark tomorrow on a tour.
[3:35:46.360 --> 3:35:49.000]  And we have to sell, I would sell tickets for the city,
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:49.960]  but not the location.
[3:35:49.960 --> 3:35:56.440]  Because if I set the location, SJW, you know, just called.
[3:35:56.440 --> 3:35:57.880]  I don't know how many of them there are.
[3:35:57.880 --> 3:36:01.960]  But I did a tour like seven months ago.
[3:36:01.960 --> 3:36:05.960]  And seven out of seven of the venues canceled on me
[3:36:05.960 --> 3:36:06.840]  because of complaints.
[3:36:06.840 --> 3:36:08.600]  So now we sell a city.
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:10.600]  And then I email the people where it is.
[3:36:10.600 --> 3:36:11.880]  So I was like, come and speak easy.
[3:36:12.520 --> 3:36:14.600]  And I started thinking about it.
[3:36:14.600 --> 3:36:17.960]  Like, why is it music and comedy that's so...
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:20.600]  Yeah, I'm going to turn myself down a little bit.
[3:36:20.600 --> 3:36:21.560]  Yeah, Skype is wacky.
[3:36:21.560 --> 3:36:22.920]  But I'm going to turn you down a little bit.
[3:36:22.920 --> 3:36:23.640]  See you guys tomorrow.
[3:36:23.640 --> 3:36:24.040]  That's fine.
[3:36:24.040 --> 3:36:25.800]  And then I'll tell you when we're going to break
[3:36:25.800 --> 3:36:26.680]  in like seven minutes.
[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:27.080]  Go ahead.
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:27.960]  Oh, great. Awesome.
[3:36:29.480 --> 3:36:31.160]  So why...
[3:36:31.160 --> 3:36:31.560]  I didn't...
[3:36:31.560 --> 3:36:33.240]  When I first got into comedy and music,
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:37.800]  I had no idea the amount of like mind control it has over people.
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:39.800]  Like, I'm going to show you something.
[3:36:39.800 --> 3:36:41.640]  Like, right now I'm like a band comedian.
[3:36:41.640 --> 3:36:43.640]  And I'm like, not allowed in Hollywood and stuff.
[3:36:43.640 --> 3:36:47.880]  But if you could think, who's the most leftist,
[3:36:47.880 --> 3:36:49.480]  famous female movie star?
[3:36:50.520 --> 3:36:54.120]  I'll show you a clip right now of how it used to be.
[3:36:54.120 --> 3:36:55.320]  This was three years ago.
[3:36:55.320 --> 3:36:58.440]  This is Anne Hathaway and her opinion on me.
[3:37:02.680 --> 3:37:03.160]  Hello.
[3:37:05.160 --> 3:37:07.880]  Who else here is a massive fan of Owen Benjamin now?
[3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:12.040]  He's so incredible.
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:16.680]  And the only reason I'm playing that is because I just want to show
[3:37:16.680 --> 3:37:19.720]  how music and comedy has a way of uniting.
[3:37:21.720 --> 3:37:22.920]  Hey, I got to turn this down.
[3:37:22.920 --> 3:37:23.640]  I'm going to drive myself.
[3:37:23.640 --> 3:37:26.680]  Now, understand, you couldn't get Skype Audio to us or you,
[3:37:26.680 --> 3:37:27.880]  and then you went with that.
[3:37:27.880 --> 3:37:30.040]  And when we all learn these tricks dealing with this,
[3:37:30.040 --> 3:37:32.520]  you might want to keep the phone maybe in front of you than doing it.
[3:37:32.520 --> 3:37:34.040]  Then just go audio phone only.
[3:37:34.040 --> 3:37:35.080]  But it doesn't matter.
[3:37:35.080 --> 3:37:35.880]  We're going to work through these.
[3:37:35.880 --> 3:37:36.760]  We're going to work through these problems together.
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:37.480]  We're going to work through it.
[3:37:39.320 --> 3:37:41.560]  So anyway, what I was saying is comedy and music
[3:37:41.560 --> 3:37:42.920]  have a way of uniting people.
[3:37:42.920 --> 3:37:45.160]  And as we see with like globalism,
[3:37:45.160 --> 3:37:47.640]  they really need us to not be united.
[3:37:47.640 --> 3:37:51.480]  And here's another clip of my, now my buddy, Tommy Robinson.
[3:37:51.480 --> 3:37:55.800]  And the power, the political power of just a song.
[3:37:55.800 --> 3:37:58.280]  And I had no idea how powerful these things are,
[3:37:58.280 --> 3:38:01.080]  but watch this little video about the progress of what
[3:38:02.040 --> 3:38:04.760]  an honest song can do for somebody.
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:05.720]  And a song you created.
[3:38:05.720 --> 3:38:06.120]  Here it is.
[3:38:06.760 --> 3:38:10.040]  So we've all seen the process of the Tommy Robinson song, right?
[3:38:10.040 --> 3:38:11.400]  So we're riffing it.
[3:38:11.400 --> 3:38:11.800]  All right.
[3:38:11.800 --> 3:38:12.520]  So let's do it.
[3:38:12.520 --> 3:38:14.120]  Let's write the Tommy Robinson.
[3:38:14.840 --> 3:38:18.840]  I heard there was a secret chord.
[3:38:18.840 --> 3:38:19.880]  We all write it together.
[3:38:19.880 --> 3:38:21.640]  I do it on this thing.
[3:38:21.640 --> 3:38:26.040]  I heard there was a secret chord where journalists
[3:38:26.040 --> 3:38:28.440]  weren't allowed to report.
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:32.680]  But you don't really care for freedom, do you?
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:36.840]  And then I do it live.
[3:38:36.840 --> 3:38:37.960]  And everyone's like, oh, no way.
[3:38:37.960 --> 3:38:39.400]  Like that became that.
[3:38:39.400 --> 3:38:51.000]  It goes like this, without the faith, the gavel falls, and they cover us. It's, it's not okay, but this is how they rule you.
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:38:53.480]  Right?
[3:38:53.480 --> 3:38:55.560]  And then Coddington did a cover.
[3:38:55.560 --> 3:39:11.160]  It goes like this, without the faith, gavel falls, and they cuff your wrist. It's not okay that this is how they rule you.
[3:39:11.160 --> 3:39:18.200]  How they rule you, how they rule you.
[3:39:18.200 --> 3:39:21.160]  And then Tommy Robinson and his guys heard it.
[3:39:21.160 --> 3:39:33.160]  And then they contacted me to do a studio version so that they can sell it in the UK to get money for Tommy's wife.
[3:39:33.160 --> 3:39:35.640]  So that, that happened.
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:36.520]  That's now happening.
[3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:50.680]  So like when a soldier in freedom goes to jail and they have a wife and they have a mission, your, your role at that point is to keep their name being heard.
[3:39:50.680 --> 3:39:53.640]  And, and being preachy doesn't, doesn't really work.
[3:39:54.680 --> 3:39:56.600]  That's why this song is so sweet.
[3:39:56.600 --> 3:39:58.600]  All right, so check out what Coddington made.
[3:39:58.600 --> 3:40:01.560]  Kids look up to you for truth.
[3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:05.720]  Please don't say, baby, this is now how they rule you.
[3:40:07.720 --> 3:40:15.720]  How they rule you, how they rule you, how they rule you.
[3:40:15.720 --> 3:40:19.720]  This is my thank you to our new Benjamin in America.
[3:40:29.720 --> 3:40:31.720]  It became a rallying cry.
[3:40:31.720 --> 3:40:43.720]  And then when I, when I saw that all these people were singing it in England, it dawned on me why art and why beauty and why like, uh, uh, just any semblance of good or quality is taken out of our music.
[3:40:43.720 --> 3:40:47.720]  Your quality is taken out of our life because it inspires people.
[3:40:47.720 --> 3:40:57.720]  And that's, that's kind of like what we're facing right now because I was talking to my wife about this because she knows a lot about architecture and fashion.
[3:40:57.720 --> 3:41:05.720]  And she was saying the same thing would happen with architecture and that they're like this intentional ugly building or an intentionally ugly outfit.
[3:41:05.720 --> 3:41:11.720]  And I was going to show you guys today, I don't know, probably in the next segment how, how it works and how it happens.
[3:41:11.720 --> 3:41:19.720]  You left us from CIA admitted 40 years ago, they began to put out ugly dehumanizing architecture, sexualization of children.
[3:41:19.720 --> 3:41:28.720]  This is all done to show, like you did last week, Jenner, you know, is this ugly man, you know, this hit and run guy.
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:33.720]  And if this is the most beautiful woman on earth, you'll believe that a pile of crap is chocolate ice cream.
[3:41:33.720 --> 3:41:38.720]  So they're giving you a big pile of a feces saying, no, it's Dutch chocolate ice cream.
[3:41:38.720 --> 3:41:40.720]  No, no, it's not.
[3:41:40.720 --> 3:41:49.720]  And if you don't eat the crap and think it's chocolate ice cream, you're a bigotracist homophobe and you don't deserve to be on Twitter, YouTube or Apple.
[3:41:49.720 --> 3:41:50.720]  And that's exactly it.
[3:41:50.720 --> 3:41:54.720]  The real, the real art of modern art isn't the art.
[3:41:54.720 --> 3:41:57.720]  It's getting people to buy it for exorbitant amounts of money.
[3:41:57.720 --> 3:42:05.720]  It's almost like the mind control art where there is just a dot on a piece of paper and someone will pay millions of dollars for it.
[3:42:05.720 --> 3:42:11.720]  The real art is the art of war and that where they can subvert people to the point where they don't even know what good looks like.
[3:42:11.720 --> 3:42:18.720]  And once they've broken the individual and once they've broken the thing to strive for, it's, it's, it's a subverted population.
[3:42:18.720 --> 3:42:21.720]  And at that point, anybody can take, take over.
[3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:26.720]  And that's why it's important to just fight against that and still make what is good.
[3:42:26.720 --> 3:42:34.720]  And, and I want to compare hip hop and country music to like the different messages of these people and like how it all works.
[3:42:34.720 --> 3:42:38.720]  Owen Benjamin, hugepianist.com, one of the most censored media in the world.
[3:42:38.720 --> 3:42:41.720]  We'll be with us live on the other side of this quick break.

[3:43:40.720 --> 3:43:43.720]  paired with our ultimate fish oil or used separately.

[3:46:17.720 --> 3:46:24.720]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,

[3:46:30.720 --> 3:46:35.720]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags. We'll win.
[3:46:35.720 --> 3:46:42.720]  We have huge sales at infowarsstore.com right now. When we're still able to operate, the shop and garden get stuff shipped out to you,
[3:46:42.720 --> 3:46:46.720]  despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market.
[3:46:46.720 --> 3:46:49.720]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.
[3:46:49.720 --> 3:47:06.720]  This is infowars darkest hour. With your support, I'm counting on you.
[3:47:06.720 --> 3:47:15.720]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones with Owen Benjamin.
[3:47:17.720 --> 3:47:24.720]  Yeah. That's a hot track. The heavy. The heavy. That's a great band. How are you guys?
[3:47:24.720 --> 3:47:31.720]  I wanted to talk a little bit about Neil deGrasse Tyson's Me Too Rape allegations.
[3:47:31.720 --> 3:47:40.720]  And I'm going to start by saying no idea if he's guilty or not because of a beautiful American tradition called due process.
[3:47:40.720 --> 3:47:47.720]  But he's the guy. He's one of the guys that said believe women and all this stuff.
[3:47:47.720 --> 3:47:53.720]  And the credibility of his accusation, his accusers is infinitely higher than Kavanaugh's.
[3:47:53.720 --> 3:48:06.720]  I mean, one was an undergrad black woman at a college who just has details about when, where, why, how apparently he drugged her allegedly.
[3:48:06.720 --> 3:48:11.720]  And then another was a groping. That's at the point I'm trying to make.
[3:48:11.720 --> 3:48:16.720]  The point is rather not he's guilty or innocent, it doesn't matter.
[3:48:16.720 --> 3:48:22.720]  I think that people should be held to their own rules that they inflict on other people because in rules for radicals by Saul Linsky,
[3:48:22.720 --> 3:48:29.720]  the way these people operate is make your enemy hold their own standard, but don't follow their standard.
[3:48:29.720 --> 3:48:35.720]  And that's, and that's BS. And my gut says he's probably, he's probably a perv. I mean, Bill Nye is a total perv.
[3:48:35.720 --> 3:48:40.720]  Allegedly, but very, very validly, allegedly. I don't know if that's even a word.
[3:48:40.720 --> 3:48:50.720]  But today I wanted to kind of look through some of Neil deGrasse Tyson's just a couple of his tweets and kind of assess what this guy's all about.
[3:48:50.720 --> 3:48:58.720]  Because I think people kind of tell you what they're all about. Like people will tell you who they are constantly and it's our job just to kind of understand it.
[3:48:58.720 --> 3:49:08.720]  And it's interesting how leftist men, when they get a hard meet too, like Neil deGrasse Tyson, it goes away really fast.
[3:49:08.720 --> 3:49:17.720]  This won't go anywhere. No one will care. And his, and his, and he addressed it and apologized for, for making someone feel uncomfortable,
[3:49:17.720 --> 3:49:23.720]  even though he totally slandered the woman saying that she's basically a nut job after college.
[3:49:23.720 --> 3:49:29.720]  He started like getting into all this weird stuff. It's like, well, that could easily be explained by a rape.
[3:49:29.720 --> 3:49:36.720]  But so anyway, let's check out one of these, one of these tweets and we'll just kind of go from there and we'll assess this guy's character,
[3:49:36.720 --> 3:49:41.720]  what he stands for and what that may, how that may affect women.
[3:49:41.720 --> 3:49:48.720]  All right. So I can't really read the, all right. So I don't know if you can zoom out a little bit on this one, but to wait in line.
[3:49:48.720 --> 3:49:54.720]  So basically this one says, this is Neil deGrasse Tyson, that he just had to wait in line to renew his passport.
[3:49:54.720 --> 3:50:00.720]  That's allowing him to visit members of my own species across artificially conceived borders.
[3:50:00.720 --> 3:50:05.720]  All right. So that's a tweet that he sent. So this guy doesn't believe in borders or boundaries.
[3:50:05.720 --> 3:50:13.720]  So that would apply to how he feels about women, people that typically, people that don't believe in boundaries.
[3:50:13.720 --> 3:50:18.720]  And they're not arbitrary lines in the sand. He makes it seem like they're artificially conceived.
[3:50:18.720 --> 3:50:26.720]  I don't even know what that means. That's bad. It's bad language skills there, Neil. Stick with the calculator, buddy.
[3:50:26.720 --> 3:50:32.720]  They're not, they're not random. People fought and died for those lines in the sand.
[3:50:32.720 --> 3:50:40.720]  Like, like the reason that there's a line in a certain part of the ground on a map is because of war treaties,
[3:50:40.720 --> 3:50:47.720]  because people fought for every single inch they could possibly get so they could govern their own lives and not live under tyranny.
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:53.720]  So when he says I had to wait in line to renew a passport, allowing me to visit members of my own species across artificially conceived borders.
[3:50:53.720 --> 3:51:03.720]  What he's saying is he feels that waiting in a line is too much of an inconvenience for him and there shouldn't be borders between countries.
[3:51:03.720 --> 3:51:12.720]  And those tip, the reason that there's so many rape allegations against leftist men is because people that don't believe in boundaries don't believe in boundaries.
[3:51:12.720 --> 3:51:19.720]  So if you think that that's why we're going to see a rise in, I'm not going to make any predictions.
[3:51:19.720 --> 3:51:23.720]  Anyway, give me another, we're going to, I'm going to show you guys another tweet.
[3:51:23.720 --> 3:51:30.720]  This one will reveal even more about old Neil Tyson.
[3:51:30.720 --> 3:51:39.720]  This one says, if there were ever species for whom sex hurt, it surely went extinct long ago.
[3:51:39.720 --> 3:51:50.720]  Okay, men, good men can spot that type of behavior. What he's trying to do is say something that gets him laid at a party.
[3:51:50.720 --> 3:51:59.720]  It's very similar to a guy with a guitar or he talks about rather or not, this is all a dream and the dreams are all, and the dream is real and life isn't real.
[3:51:59.720 --> 3:52:01.720]  And then they're like, let's go into my room.
[3:52:01.720 --> 3:52:09.720]  When he's saying that, that if sex hurt anyone, that species will go extinct. He's obviously forgets about the cat.
[3:52:09.720 --> 3:52:15.720]  All cats procreate on violent rape where there's even spikes.
[3:52:15.720 --> 3:52:19.720]  And it's just, I don't even want to get into it. I know there's a family show.
[3:52:19.720 --> 3:52:27.720]  So I don't want to describe to you in graphic detail just how brutal some of the rapes are in the animal kingdom.
[3:52:27.720 --> 3:52:35.720]  So what he's trying to do here is try to set up this whole idea that he's like, hey, baby, listen, I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson.
[3:52:35.720 --> 3:52:39.720]  I have a hyphenated last name, which is a total red flag in men.
[3:52:39.720 --> 3:52:45.720]  But if sex hurt anybody, they would have went extinct long ago.
[3:52:45.720 --> 3:52:50.720]  Come on, man. He's basically setting up a rape defense.
[3:52:50.720 --> 3:52:56.720]  If there were ever species for whom sex hurt, it surely went extinct long ago. Tell that to cats.
[3:52:56.720 --> 3:52:59.720]  Tell that to cats, Neil.
[3:52:59.720 --> 3:53:04.720]  All right, let's check out another one of this, this human.
[3:53:04.720 --> 3:53:09.720]  On this day long ago, a child was born who by age 30 would transform the world.
[3:53:09.720 --> 3:53:13.720]  Happy birthday, Isaac Newton, December 25th, 1642.
[3:53:13.720 --> 3:53:18.720]  He tweeted that, of course, on Christmas.
[3:53:18.720 --> 3:53:23.720]  It's one thing to not be Christian or religious.
[3:53:23.720 --> 3:53:30.720]  Whatever you are, you are. It's another thing to have like a real cynical, you want, you take cynical jabs.
[3:53:30.720 --> 3:53:38.720]  It really says a lot about somebody and a little known fact, not little known if you read books, but Isaac Newton was a devout Christian.
[3:53:38.720 --> 3:53:50.720]  So what he's trying to say here is he's trying to establish a secular religion called leftism, globalism, and it's all based on, on, on nonsense.
[3:53:50.720 --> 3:53:59.720]  Of all the miracles of Christ, nothing is, is less believable than the Big Bang.
[3:53:59.720 --> 3:54:04.720]  He's saying that all, he's saying that all, okay.
[3:54:04.720 --> 3:54:08.720]  It was this quote, God is an all ever receding pocket of science.
[3:54:08.720 --> 3:54:14.720]  Man, this guy's terrible. Look at that mustache. He's like, he's like a weird, he's like a black Zoro.
[3:54:14.720 --> 3:54:25.720]  But so, so the Big Bang says that all physical laws and properties existed instantly out of nothing and that matter cannot be created or destroyed.
[3:54:25.720 --> 3:54:30.720]  It can merely be converted from energy to matter and matter to energy.
[3:54:30.720 --> 3:54:33.720]  And where did it all come from? Nothing.
[3:54:33.720 --> 3:54:36.720]  And it happened randomly out of nowhere.
[3:54:36.720 --> 3:54:39.720]  And we good?
[3:54:39.720 --> 3:54:48.720]  That, that's, there's a great C.S. Lewis quote, he said some, he said some along the lines of science says, give me one miracle and we'll explain everything.
[3:54:48.720 --> 3:54:52.720]  Science is based on a miracle.
[3:54:52.720 --> 3:54:59.720]  And the fact that they won't acknowledge the miracle makes it extra, extra nefarious.
[3:54:59.720 --> 3:55:04.720]  I believe in God, but I know that I require faith to do that.
[3:55:04.720 --> 3:55:08.720]  And I say it's faith. It's faith. I have faith. That's why it's called faith.
[3:55:08.720 --> 3:55:11.720]  These people will not admit that they have faith.
[3:55:11.720 --> 3:55:15.720]  They say that they're rational, right. It's all provable and it's facts.
[3:55:15.720 --> 3:55:18.720]  Humans are machines. It's all material.
[3:55:18.720 --> 3:55:26.720]  We're just material predetermined chemistry factories that are just playing out whatever the Big Bang wants us to.
[3:55:26.720 --> 3:55:29.720]  That's, that's a guy who rapes.
[3:55:29.720 --> 3:55:34.720]  So when he's just taken a jab, and by the way, he wouldn't do that on Mohammed's birthday.
[3:55:34.720 --> 3:55:38.720]  It's only against Christianity. Why? Because Christianity sets people free.
[3:55:38.720 --> 3:55:40.720]  Christianity isn't a slave religion.
[3:55:40.720 --> 3:55:46.720]  Unlike our brothers and sisters in the Middle East who are in slave religion.
[3:55:46.720 --> 3:55:49.720]  Islam is, Islam is communism with a God.
[3:55:49.720 --> 3:55:56.720]  It's designed to just say nonsense over and over again and do things just to stay in line.
[3:55:56.720 --> 3:56:03.720]  And if Christianity doesn't punish Jews and Muslims differently than Christians and crimes.
[3:56:03.720 --> 3:56:06.720]  How revolutionary that is. How rare that is.
[3:56:06.720 --> 3:56:13.720]  That'll shout like, like, like there's different laws for non-Muslims than there is for Muslims.
[3:56:13.720 --> 3:56:18.720]  And as a non-Muslim, I find that horrifying.
[3:56:18.720 --> 3:56:20.720]  There's a tax for non-Muslims.
[3:56:20.720 --> 3:56:24.720]  So, so the fact his reverence for Islam, he's never attacked Islam,
[3:56:24.720 --> 3:56:32.720]  and his disdain for Christianity is very telling because people who like slaves,
[3:56:32.720 --> 3:56:34.720]  rape because it's about control.
[3:56:34.720 --> 3:56:38.720]  Sexual predation is about control, pedophilia, all of it.
[3:56:38.720 --> 3:56:40.720]  It's about control, control, control.
[3:56:40.720 --> 3:56:42.720]  It's about having power over somebody else.
[3:56:42.720 --> 3:56:44.720]  I went through a phase where I didn't believe that,
[3:56:44.720 --> 3:56:49.720]  where I thought that saying that rape is about power and not sex was some weird argument,
[3:56:49.720 --> 3:56:50.720]  and I didn't quite understand it.
[3:56:50.720 --> 3:56:58.720]  And then the older I got, the more I realized outside of different procreation strategies
[3:56:58.720 --> 3:57:04.720]  and horrific times of our history, it is about power.
[3:57:04.720 --> 3:57:08.720]  It's about being able to inflict your will on somebody else.
[3:57:08.720 --> 3:57:12.720]  I think we might have time for one last tweet here.
[3:57:12.720 --> 3:57:17.720]  Another tweet by Neil deGrasse Tyson. Check this one out, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:57:17.720 --> 3:57:19.720]  Oh, we got to go on a break.
[3:57:19.720 --> 3:57:23.720]  When we come back, more good stuff or fun.

[3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:31.720]  Neil deGrasse Tyson allegedly is a full-blown rapist.
[3:57:31.720 --> 3:58:00.720]  Yeah.
