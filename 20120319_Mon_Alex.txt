[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:32.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.920 --> 00:40.920]  we are live my friends thank you for joining us it is the 19th day of March
[00:40.920 --> 00:46.080]  2012 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours famous civil rights
[00:46.080 --> 00:53.920]  activist Dick Gregory we'll be joining us here on the broadcast today coming up
[00:53.920 --> 00:59.200]  in the third hour to discuss the warmongering of the left as well as the
[00:59.200 --> 01:05.480]  controlled right and a lot more he'll be joining us coming up in the third hour
[01:05.480 --> 01:13.480]  today obviously the drudge report at the big headline yesterday martial law and
[01:13.480 --> 01:19.360]  then it went into this new Obama executive order and it's caused quite a
[01:19.360 --> 01:25.440]  stir so I thought today I would break down and explain to people the fact that
[01:25.440 --> 01:31.040]  we're already under a quasi-martial law and that it's being expanded and
[01:31.040 --> 01:37.080]  basically phased in right now remember I'm the guy probably better known than
[01:37.080 --> 01:42.440]  anybody else in the United States for talking about a program of long-term
[01:42.440 --> 01:47.560]  plan to slowly get rid of due process and incrementally establish martial law
[01:47.560 --> 01:54.560]  in this country they're not going to call it martial law they're going to call it
[01:54.560 --> 01:59.480]  security they're going to call it continuity of government now he quietly
[01:59.480 --> 02:04.640]  signed this last Friday just like he signed the NDAA on New Year's Eve and
[02:04.640 --> 02:07.360]  they tried to deny that it affected citizens that would allow us to be
[02:07.360 --> 02:12.680]  disappeared into the night but now they admit that why are they now implementing
[02:12.680 --> 02:18.640]  because Obama pointed out hey I'm just reauthorizing a 1950s plan for when we
[02:18.640 --> 02:24.280]  were under nuclear attack to have the entire country nationalized now remember
[02:24.280 --> 02:29.240]  the federal government itself is run by a small handful of megabanks that are
[02:29.240 --> 02:33.720]  anti-free market and so when you're talking about nationalization it's
[02:33.720 --> 02:36.640]  bad enough to have it be the federal government but this is the very same
[02:36.640 --> 02:41.080]  foreign banks that have nationalized Europe it's now admitted the euro is
[02:41.080 --> 02:47.240]  just a receivership arm to nationalize Europe raise taxes and pay it to private
[02:47.240 --> 02:52.040]  banks not on debts the people owe the lion's share of it's not debts that they
[02:52.040 --> 02:58.200]  owe from their pensions or you know unfunded mandates the lion's share this
[02:58.200 --> 03:00.600]  is what the right wing won't tell you and the left wing won't tell you because
[03:00.600 --> 03:05.800]  they're all bought and paid for or they're ignorant it's signing on to the
[03:05.800 --> 03:14.160]  debt of the megabanks the too big to fail and so this is a planned trajectory
[03:14.160 --> 03:22.400]  a planned targeting and we're following right along online it will lead to secret
[03:22.400 --> 03:26.560]  arrest it will lead to censorship of free speech not just being arrested for
[03:26.560 --> 03:30.080]  videotaping police or having our website shut down but actually being
[03:30.080 --> 03:35.240]  arrested and disappeared it will lead to that because that's what the system is
[03:35.240 --> 03:40.560]  training for that's their promised land that's where the globalist want this to
[03:40.560 --> 03:46.160]  lead that's where it will go if we don't stop them some people say well that's
[03:46.160 --> 03:51.080]  scary Alexa what you have said is coming true this voice in the wilderness I
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.600]  better shut up no no no no that's how they win so many of you say well I'll
[03:55.600 --> 04:01.120]  just go along with it I'll be all right the UN the globalist Maury Strong all
[04:01.120 --> 04:04.280]  of them admit that they want to lower our standard of living in the first phase
[04:04.280 --> 04:10.080]  by 50% they've already greatly lowered our standard of living the last 30
[04:10.080 --> 04:17.000]  years they want another 50% on that and then they accelerated even more and this
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.960]  is about indiscriminate arrest indiscriminate terror prisons everywhere
[04:21.960 --> 04:25.080]  we're already the biggest prison economy in the world I drove out to the
[04:25.080 --> 04:29.480]  Austin rodeo yesterday and drove by two or three jails giant prisons just
[04:29.480 --> 04:35.360]  driving outside Austin this is where it's all going a predatory economy by
[04:35.360 --> 04:41.000]  design to come back we'll get into that also fraud against the Ron Paul campaign

[06:59.000 --> 07:04.600]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[07:04.600 --> 07:08.360]  pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[07:08.360 --> 07:12.440]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[07:12.440 --> 07:15.920]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[07:15.920 --> 07:20.600]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[08:32.360 --> 08:40.040]  to tune in today because the martial law system being incrementally rolled out
[08:40.040 --> 08:44.680]  and beta tested here in the United States is also being standardized and
[08:44.680 --> 08:54.000]  expanded in other nations of this globe this is ruled by private anti free
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.280]  market crony capitalist monopoly men and their own IMF and World Bank documents
[09:01.280 --> 09:05.320]  have been public now for a decade of how they plan to implode Europe using
[09:05.320 --> 09:09.880]  derivatives and signing countries on to their own debts and how they plan to
[09:09.880 --> 09:14.840]  then do that here in the United States then in the wealthier areas of Asia they've
[09:14.840 --> 09:19.160]  already done it in Latin America they've already done it in Africa they've
[09:19.160 --> 09:23.000]  already done it in Eastern Europe they've already engaged in it in poorer
[09:23.000 --> 09:30.640]  areas of Asia they've already had the oligarchs suck places like Russia dry
[09:30.640 --> 09:36.360]  repeatedly the globalist the big money man want to work with authoritarian
[09:36.360 --> 09:40.680]  systems as professor Carol Quigley the head of Georgetown political science
[09:40.680 --> 09:47.160]  Bill Clinton's mentor wrote in his book tragedy and hope it was only meant to be
[09:47.160 --> 09:51.760]  a thousand copies given to high-level State Department CIA people so that they
[09:51.760 --> 09:56.240]  could understand well wait we fund fascist but we fund communist and we
[09:56.240 --> 10:00.520]  fund socialist they couldn't even understand it and so Quigley wrote the
[10:00.520 --> 10:04.800]  book it wasn't meant the plates to be leaked out which they were in copies
[10:04.800 --> 10:10.800]  made doesn't matter most people don't read 900 plus page or it's almost a
[10:10.800 --> 10:17.640]  thousand with a bibliography documents and in it he explains the system is
[10:17.640 --> 10:22.960]  command and control it will fund anything authoritarian and it wants to
[10:22.960 --> 10:29.200]  destroy free market and destroy individual freedom and destroy any type
[10:29.200 --> 10:37.640]  of self-sufficiency and then he went on to endorse that the globalists sit
[10:37.640 --> 10:41.600]  above our nations playing us off against each other now I have an
[10:41.600 --> 10:48.760]  incredibly important broadcast obviously lined up for you today it's finally
[10:48.760 --> 10:54.240]  getting attention people are finally paying attention there have been steps
[10:54.240 --> 11:01.400]  towards the road of martial law because this isn't like one day there's a
[11:01.400 --> 11:05.080]  military coup and there's troops on the streets it's just incrementally more and
[11:05.080 --> 11:09.200]  more troops more and more militarized police people being arrested nationwide
[11:09.200 --> 11:14.080]  for filming police more and more cameras the government admitting hey we are
[11:14.080 --> 11:19.920]  surveilling you without warrants head of the CIA last week gave us speech wired
[11:19.920 --> 11:24.360]  magazine washed in post all covered it reporting on it like it was kind of cool
[11:24.360 --> 11:29.560]  here's his quotes all the new appliances all the new cell phones washers and
[11:29.560 --> 11:35.760]  dryers clock radios are having tech built in for very inexpensive that has
[11:35.760 --> 11:42.440]  bugs listening to you the power lines are actual data cables hooked in even if
[11:42.440 --> 11:46.160]  you don't even have internet we're listening to you people are like wow
[11:46.160 --> 11:50.920]  this is what Alex Jones said for a decade because it was all in the public
[11:50.920 --> 11:56.560]  documents but why are they now admitting it but remember I'm still kooky and bad
[11:56.560 --> 12:03.160]  I was on Fox News and said I would never do a show there and turn them down most
[12:03.160 --> 12:08.600]  the time but man cows a friend of mine and you wanted me to take a tape a show
[12:08.600 --> 12:12.480]  that's gonna air later on Fox we'll see what's gonna air that day and they
[12:12.480 --> 12:15.360]  announced we're gonna hurt in a week now since Alex Jones is on but that was
[12:15.360 --> 12:18.840]  that was interesting I could care less if I'm on there or not I just went on
[12:18.840 --> 12:23.680]  Fox News and screamed at him when his guest said oh you're a kook our
[12:23.680 --> 12:28.440]  appliances aren't tracking and watching us you're a nut I said shut up shut up
[12:28.440 --> 12:33.200]  idiot it's in hundreds of publications he gave a speech I'm sick of you using
[12:33.200 --> 12:40.000]  that throwaway line open tyranny's upon us and I said shut up shut up people like
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.800]  oh my gosh that makes you look like you're angry it's time to get people out
[12:43.800 --> 12:53.560]  of their box like Howard Beale says in network first you've got to get mad I've
[12:53.560 --> 12:57.520]  got the transcript there's even short video clips of it they've put out I
[12:57.520 --> 13:04.400]  don't know if in to tell the public CIA investment firm if they're gonna publish
[13:04.400 --> 13:08.920]  all of the video but I didn't mean it it's there it's it's wired magazine you
[13:08.920 --> 13:15.160]  name it wire magazine headline CIA director your dishwasher is spying on
[13:15.160 --> 13:26.520]  you and I go on and I say hey everything is being engineered with spy grids in it
[13:26.520 --> 13:29.640]  and the government admits they're watching them enlisting without warrants
[13:29.640 --> 13:36.040]  and they start laughing at me and then I went on to say six years ago Google put
[13:36.040 --> 13:41.480]  out a press release to its shareholders saying we're now watching people over the
[13:41.480 --> 13:49.080]  cameras built into their laptops and they started laughing at that I mean
[13:49.080 --> 13:54.040]  that's an article six years ago prisonplanet.com with a link to Google.com
[13:54.040 --> 14:02.880]  in the shareholder section with the press release and here's the CIA director
[14:02.880 --> 14:09.160]  saying it and it was in hundreds of news articles daily mail associated press
[14:09.160 --> 14:13.360]  Reuters there it is wire magazine CIA chief will spawn you through your
[14:13.360 --> 14:19.200]  dishwasher and then it's got the quotes how everything I mean for a dollar or
[14:19.200 --> 14:23.480]  less they can have a wireless system that the smart meter dials into and
[14:23.480 --> 14:33.560]  listens to you with an audio bug I remember a Time Warner installer one
[14:33.560 --> 14:38.240]  day was in my house and he said hey Alex I'm a listener and I heard you talk
[14:38.240 --> 14:41.840]  about in Australia they found cameras and microphones in the cable boxes that
[14:41.840 --> 14:45.640]  that did happen like 12 years ago he goes let me show you the manual for this
[14:45.640 --> 14:50.320]  to the scientific Atlantic cable box you said you see that little mark that's a
[14:50.320 --> 14:53.840]  microphone and back then there was no voice control of it he goes look inside
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.240]  you see this whole tech area that's a remote audio sensor and they've got
[14:58.240 --> 15:02.320]  systems back at Time Warner that track everything you watch and put it into a
[15:02.320 --> 15:09.000]  psychological algorithm and I'm like you're you're a cable installer he goes
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.320]  well I'm actually a engineer you know for every 20 or so of the installers you
[15:15.320 --> 15:18.680]  know they have an engineer in case there's problems but just thought I'd tell
[15:18.680 --> 15:23.240]  you that he said yeah you can borrow the manual and I went on air and showed the
[15:23.240 --> 15:27.600]  manual and got death threats this is 10 years ago and people were calling in
[15:27.600 --> 15:33.760]  going you are a complete lunatic there's no microphone in my cable box when
[15:33.760 --> 15:37.720]  when there was a little hole and the microphone was inside so I went on air
[15:37.720 --> 15:46.600]  and opened the cable box up on air and people still didn't believe it had to
[15:46.600 --> 15:49.000]  basically break it to get into it because it's got a special tool and I
[15:49.000 --> 15:55.400]  didn't have it but again this is my frustration is that I read the Rand
[15:55.400 --> 15:59.160]  Corporation talk about how they would just acclimate everybody to a security
[15:59.160 --> 16:07.120]  state martial law incrementally until we were in deep martial law and I saw the
[16:07.120 --> 16:10.840]  preparations and I went to urban warfare drills and I had police chiefs warn me
[16:10.840 --> 16:15.640]  like police even San Antonio in a sit-down video interview because he was a
[16:15.640 --> 16:19.800]  patriot and former army and had been an intelligence and knew this was what they'd
[16:19.800 --> 16:23.920]  been trained to do to third-world countries overthrowing him he was
[16:23.920 --> 16:28.040]  approached by the army then I talked to Thomas Sanchez head of emergency
[16:28.040 --> 16:31.820]  management himself a Vietnam veteran just so happened had been an
[16:31.820 --> 16:36.680]  intelligence he's like this is what we did infiltrating in in Vietnam I'm not
[16:36.680 --> 16:41.960]  well this is illegal they've got Marines Army in every town the
[16:41.960 --> 16:46.280]  government ships the narcotics and it's all on record all the police chiefs
[16:46.280 --> 16:53.240]  know this of any size it's all a big joke folks okay the attorney general man I
[16:53.240 --> 16:57.200]  saw this yesterday afternoon one of our listeners had found it on going into the
[16:57.200 --> 17:01.920]  sea Spanish but all of its videos back 25 years by the way lamb the head of it
[17:01.920 --> 17:05.560]  stepping down online you can search it by keywords so people are digging through
[17:05.560 --> 17:09.200]  it right now singing ended that a few years ago and we were able to go find
[17:09.200 --> 17:12.560]  the stuff I'd seen and heard where the cops are like get back they're blowing
[17:12.560 --> 17:17.640]  seven up the point is they blew seven up on 9-11 building seven all these old
[17:17.640 --> 17:21.440]  archives are getting posted now you could search them now with keyword and
[17:21.440 --> 17:26.840]  there is the attorney general on C-span in 1995 he was then deputy attorney
[17:26.840 --> 17:32.320]  general and there he is saying we need I've talked to all the media heads we're
[17:32.320 --> 17:36.520]  gonna get ads out there to teach you that you don't need to have guns well
[17:36.520 --> 17:40.640]  now they've gone further you draw a gun you get arrested there is no law but they
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.960]  got juries that'll convict well plus it's family court there is no jury in
[17:44.960 --> 17:50.440]  most cases so they just you go to jail for a thought crime and he says we're
[17:50.440 --> 17:56.880]  gonna brainwash people I remember Sarah Brady got caught on the floor of the
[17:56.880 --> 18:02.480]  house by the way this was she was asked about this in the big Union magazine
[18:02.480 --> 18:06.000]  and that's where the quotes came out it's been confirmed she admitted she said
[18:06.000 --> 18:11.920]  but somebody ought to search that 1993 Clinton had just got an office and the
[18:11.920 --> 18:17.120]  mic was on and she was up there at the by the dais during a vote and she said
[18:17.120 --> 18:20.840]  well we'll get our socialist America as soon as we've disarmed these people
[18:20.840 --> 18:24.680]  somebody's got to go actually search that now I bet you can find that the C-span
[18:24.680 --> 18:30.360]  archive it's all been uploaded just megaterabytes we only had the text
[18:30.360 --> 18:34.280]  before I bet we can get that but I'll play the brainwash clip when we come
[18:34.280 --> 18:42.120]  back in a moment and I'll get into all the martial law knows but we can pull
[18:42.120 --> 18:47.280]  the Ted Turner C-span from 1996 where he said he you know kill 90% of the
[18:47.280 --> 18:51.400]  useless eaters wow what up you've got the power there's millions of listeners
[18:51.400 --> 18:55.000]  start digging through their system Aaron's always finding nightmare jewels
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.800]  of globalist meetings back when I guess they thought C-span was their own
[18:58.800 --> 19:06.680]  private channel nobody was watching with them of course the UN's openly states
[19:06.680 --> 19:13.480]  July 7th 2000 in New York that was on C-span if they want total abolition of
[19:13.480 --> 19:19.640]  private ownership of guns it's always been their plan and now if Obama gets
[19:19.640 --> 19:25.360]  reelected of course Mitt Romney probably be just as bad or whoever that they're
[19:25.360 --> 19:28.920]  gonna buy executive fiat go after the guns and that's what he's announced
[19:28.920 --> 19:33.840]  basically in these executive orders so we're gonna come back in and give you
[19:33.840 --> 19:39.920]  that information straight ahead but criminals are in control of this
[19:39.920 --> 19:43.840]  government and people that work for the system have really got to have a gut
[19:43.840 --> 19:48.800]  check now because never before has it been more obvious never before has it
[19:48.800 --> 19:54.080]  been more out in the open that we're dealing with real modified good old
[19:54.080 --> 20:01.520]  fashion hardcore tyranny here better choose the side a little over a year
[20:01.520 --> 20:06.000]  ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size
[20:06.000 --> 20:09.920]  meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[20:09.920 --> 20:14.000]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[20:14.000 --> 20:17.960]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost

[25:12.160 --> 25:16.480]  but I really thought you were exaggerating but they then apologize
[25:16.480 --> 25:20.280]  and say why is everything you said actually coming true how did you know
[25:20.280 --> 25:31.800]  all this and in that is my great frustration it's all public I've got
[25:31.800 --> 25:35.840]  what three different newscasts with firemen and police and others saying
[25:35.840 --> 25:41.200]  get back they're gonna blow up building 7 on 9 11 I mean I heard CBS radio back
[25:41.200 --> 25:46.280]  when they were still doing news on the day of 9 11 say they're preparing to
[25:46.280 --> 25:51.520]  control demolition the Solomon Brothers building and then I went on air back to
[25:51.520 --> 25:55.040]  the radio show because I was on at night then to not just the day and I said
[25:55.040 --> 25:58.520]  yeah anybody else hear him on the news say they blew it up all these callers
[25:58.520 --> 26:05.800]  called in and said yeah I saw it on CNN years later I met with police officers
[26:05.800 --> 26:10.160]  in New York who said I was there Amy Goodman was there back which had a local
[26:10.160 --> 26:14.520]  TV show now she has national and there was a countdown and they said get out
[26:14.520 --> 26:21.200]  of there so we ran and then years after that CNN data dumped both their
[26:21.200 --> 26:25.320]  channels material from that day so did BBC and there was all the footage of it
[26:25.320 --> 26:29.320]  everything we'd remembered everything we'd seen and people are like you
[26:29.320 --> 26:33.920]  despicable traitor you think the government did 9 11 all I know is buddy
[26:33.920 --> 26:38.480]  they blew up building 7 and it needs to be investigated all I know is they've
[26:38.480 --> 26:42.760]  taken that and used it to take my liberties away all I know is when good
[26:42.760 --> 26:47.200]  law enforcement sent me internal documents none of it has to do with
[26:47.200 --> 26:55.120]  Ahmed denigide none of it has to do with with with Ahmed in Afghanistan all of it
[26:55.120 --> 27:00.640]  has to do with gun owners conservatives libertarians farm owners machine shop
[27:00.640 --> 27:05.240]  owners I saw an article today in fact I think I am to you guys if I didn't I
[27:05.240 --> 27:09.880]  send it to Watson and Kurt but one of the biggest survivalist blogs it now
[27:09.880 --> 27:13.920]  admits the FBI for months they've now discovered was redirecting their traffic
[27:13.920 --> 27:18.320]  through their own systems just to get a database of everyone who was concerned
[27:18.320 --> 27:30.240]  about survival totally illegal since then no warrants since last year when we
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.680]  were wrong we were told oh FEMA's not going around door-to-door at cannery's
[27:35.680 --> 27:39.440]  asking about where's horrible food going since then it's been admitted that
[27:39.440 --> 27:48.320]  they're doing that I mean have people figured out yet have people figured out
[27:48.320 --> 27:53.680]  yet that this is real have people figured out that this is happening if
[27:53.680 --> 27:58.160]  anybody ever wanted to know what the fall of the republic would look like this is
[27:58.160 --> 28:03.000]  it in fact guys for the upteenth time I know you always print it I never read

[28:31.200 --> 28:41.000]  emailed to the producers to print off today so I could cover it the urgency

[33:17.680 --> 33:24.000]  there's a couple questions everybody should be asking themselves number one
[33:24.000 --> 33:33.120]  do you like the fruits of the new world order society falling apart the United
[33:33.120 --> 33:38.600]  States leading the world in every bad statistic from obesity to cancer to
[33:38.600 --> 33:45.520]  lowered IQs not just test scores you know what it means when IQs drop across the
[33:45.520 --> 33:54.960]  board right that's chemical that's being done to you that's not just laziness you
[33:54.960 --> 34:00.640]  might want to ask yourselves do you like the way things are going because if you
[34:00.640 --> 34:05.440]  don't like the way things are going you don't like the new world order because
[34:05.440 --> 34:10.320]  this is what comes out of the other end of the new world order pain suffering
[34:10.320 --> 34:19.400]  poverty wars humiliation injustice bondage those are the fruits of the new
[34:19.400 --> 34:31.200]  world order now continuing here because I want to ask people out there because a
[34:31.200 --> 34:39.160]  lot of you been listening for a long time and I want to ask you a question do
[34:39.160 --> 34:46.000]  you think I'm exaggerating now do you think I'm fair mongering now because
[34:46.000 --> 34:53.640]  let me tell you something I was a main line libertarian Ron Paul type until I
[34:53.640 --> 34:57.800]  went to urban warfare drills and witnessed the military training to go
[34:57.800 --> 35:03.600]  house-to-house in America in the drills and take our guns and talk to the troops
[35:03.600 --> 35:10.240]  and had them admit it and then had troops bosses their commanders and their
[35:10.240 --> 35:15.320]  civilian counterparts run over and threaten me and try to get my videotape
[35:15.320 --> 35:23.200]  and my cameramen had Marines with guns point them at them in America in places
[35:23.200 --> 35:29.920]  like Hebron Maryland and had the army point guns at us in San Antonio because
[35:29.920 --> 35:33.800]  we got in the police chief to speak out we were exposing their secret operations
[35:33.800 --> 35:40.280]  and we had an MP come right over and just stick that Beretta right up to Mike
[35:40.280 --> 35:43.920]  Hansen because they said give me your camera give me your tape Mike said no
[35:43.920 --> 35:48.440]  and the guy just pulled it out chambered around and said I told you give it to me
[35:48.440 --> 35:53.880]  right now now that's that's what America is they're ready to gun you and your
[35:53.880 --> 36:00.760]  family down so fast it'll make your head spin that was 14 years ago that they
[36:00.760 --> 36:04.400]  wouldn't let them do the drills off base to terrorize the public so they did
[36:04.400 --> 36:10.520]  it on Fort Sam Houston an open medical facility blew up part of a derelict
[36:10.520 --> 36:16.520]  building they were remodeling we were there the next day to show it and I as
[36:16.520 --> 36:20.280]  an American citizen the military instantly went into the role when the
[36:20.280 --> 36:27.080]  Delta Force handlers ordered those MPs to come after us and the minute Mike said
[36:27.080 --> 36:30.800]  I have a right you're not going to take my camera I want to talk to you I want to
[36:30.800 --> 36:37.160]  talk to your commanding officer and the message was you're just like one of
[36:37.160 --> 36:41.960]  those Hodges I'm ready to kill you so fast it'll make your head spin I like
[36:41.960 --> 36:46.040]  killing people and you know what the New World Order likes killing our country
[36:46.040 --> 36:49.880]  to they like killing the Bill of Rights they like killing the Constitution you
[36:49.880 --> 36:53.480]  think you like to kill soldier you think you like the power of death those
[36:53.480 --> 36:58.200]  little nerdly New World Order bureaucrats they like brainwashing people they
[36:58.200 --> 37:02.560]  like poison in the water and the vaccines and back during the GMO crops you
[37:02.560 --> 37:06.400]  think they just backdoor all the appliances with bugs that the CIA
[37:06.400 --> 37:09.680]  director general Petraeus just told everybody about last week in a public
[37:09.680 --> 37:11.880]  speech
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.160]  oh they backdoor the food you think you've been given all this power to kill
[37:18.160 --> 37:21.480]  for no reason huh
[37:25.240 --> 37:31.280]  and I guess there's a hide a killing you know in Afghanistan I remember many
[37:31.280 --> 37:33.960]  years ago
[37:37.360 --> 37:42.560]  what was his name what was his name you're still stay on this camera right
[37:42.560 --> 37:44.960]  here I'm just gonna look at people right here and forget these cameras here
[37:44.960 --> 37:47.560]  because what happens is I've got these cameras in here I'm always paying
[37:47.560 --> 37:51.960]  attention to him I it messes up my thinking process I'm just gonna forget
[37:51.960 --> 37:56.680]  these cameras are here today I realize that's one of the reasons that I can't
[37:56.680 --> 38:00.920]  focus into all my information we'll just stay on this camera today right here one
[38:00.920 --> 38:03.160]  camera
[38:05.160 --> 38:09.440]  if you're a radio listener going what camera you're listening on XM-166 you're
[38:09.440 --> 38:13.840]  listening on AMFM we stream video at prismplanet.tv and there's a box up at
[38:13.840 --> 38:21.080]  them FullWars.com we'll do it as well
[38:21.080 --> 38:28.480]  see the globalists know how to do all this incrementally to where most people
[38:28.480 --> 38:35.040]  can't resist it if they're unconscious if they just become acclimated to it
[38:35.040 --> 38:45.160]  but I
[38:48.040 --> 38:56.120]  I'm just sad for this country because Afghanistan Iraq and all of that
[38:56.120 --> 39:01.600]  seizing the oil and circling those countries that was a secondary mission
[39:01.600 --> 39:09.360]  the primary mission was to create large groups of soldiers who served up to eight
[39:09.360 --> 39:17.160]  tours who can then be brought back here and be turned into paramilitary police
[39:17.160 --> 39:22.880]  to carry out those exact type of martial law operations that's what Afghanistan
[39:22.880 --> 39:27.400]  Iraq are on record the checkpoints the frisking the house-to-house gun
[39:27.400 --> 39:32.800]  confiscations the government admits that that's a laboratory for here in the
[39:32.800 --> 39:39.760]  United States and I remember private Gruckheimer was in the Ithaca newspaper
[39:39.760 --> 39:45.920]  in 2003 and he came back and talked about how much he loved his job and how
[39:45.920 --> 39:51.120]  they'd go into villages and kill everyone including the children and the army
[39:51.120 --> 39:57.080]  the day later had a clarification on Fox News and they said the Pentagon wants
[39:57.080 --> 40:02.280]  to clarify only certain villages that have hostiles do we send in ground troops
[40:02.280 --> 40:08.280]  after a cluster bombing them and kill everybody including children and so he
[40:08.280 --> 40:13.880]  just did something you know this guy that reportedly killed the 16 people look
[40:13.880 --> 40:20.560]  most of them little kids toddlers and burned them up stabbed them this was
[40:20.560 --> 40:24.720]  this was a lot of enjoyment going on here and he told him you know my
[40:24.720 --> 40:30.040]  foot's partially blown off I don't want to be sent back was it his fifth time
[40:30.040 --> 40:35.000]  fourth time and this was his fifth deployment they say it was Mr. Goody
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.320]  two-shoes growing up Mr. Good Guy but you look what Mr. Good Guy turned into now
[40:42.320 --> 40:46.080]  they're making him a victim and some of the talk radio shows are saying oh come
[40:46.080 --> 40:54.480]  on it's just Hodges and when these guys come home and kill their families and
[40:54.480 --> 41:00.160]  kill little kids and stuff they're the minority that can't handle it why they're
[41:00.160 --> 41:06.280]  just going to take our guns because of it the general public's so we can't
[41:06.280 --> 41:09.960]  protect ourselves from the other troops that have gone haywire that are the
[41:09.960 --> 41:18.640]  police you know the ones where they go on a bus and tell a woman stand up and she
[41:18.640 --> 41:22.840]  says what's your problem so the cop full-power punches her and basically
[41:22.840 --> 41:29.720]  breaks her jaw and then the media defense it says oh that's good yeah yeah well
[41:29.720 --> 41:34.400]  the banks are gonna abuse everybody too see it's like a green light for the
[41:34.400 --> 41:38.080]  psychopaths in the government and the armies they've created to have their way
[41:38.080 --> 41:47.160]  with us but then the vast majority of the military men and women who haven't
[41:47.160 --> 41:51.240]  gone insane because of their relationship with God or family whatever the
[41:51.240 --> 41:56.440]  case is their mental toughness the you're the enemy that in all the government
[41:56.440 --> 42:01.440]  documents you're the enemy you're the enemy and they're gonna send all the
[42:01.440 --> 42:06.600]  other troops that will do whatever they're told and just want to kill some
[42:06.600 --> 42:11.440]  people they're gonna send them after you and this has all been a big
[42:11.440 --> 42:20.520]  laboratory to to produce these forces to do that and I'm gonna get into a big
[42:20.520 --> 42:26.480]  report on martial law and all the rest of it here today and I'm gonna play a
[42:26.480 --> 42:31.080]  clip of the Attorney General talking about brainwashing the public through
[42:31.080 --> 42:35.760]  television the full clips up on info wars.com we'll play about a minute of
[42:35.760 --> 42:39.680]  it here and then later if we have time play the whole clip for the radio
[42:39.680 --> 42:43.920]  audience and then in the second hour I want to open the phones up for police
[42:43.920 --> 42:52.520]  and military again we do this every few weeks active duty as I say veterans the
[42:52.520 --> 42:57.560]  veterans who were great folks will fill the phones and then we can't get any
[42:57.560 --> 43:03.440]  active duty calling in but the first round of calls current police serving
[43:03.440 --> 43:07.880]  police you all of its military parlance we're the civilians they're the
[43:07.880 --> 43:19.680]  military government that's the essence of the definition of martial law and so
[43:19.680 --> 43:23.360]  we'll be opening the phones up for everybody but but I did hours of
[43:23.360 --> 43:27.120]  research yesterday and hours this morning and I want to give you a little
[43:27.120 --> 43:33.440]  presentation here on what martial law is how it operates and how we're being
[43:33.440 --> 43:38.440]  incrementally brought into it but then the bigger question why what does the
[43:38.440 --> 43:48.280]  system plan to do once the sun is set once the doors are shut once we're tied
[43:48.280 --> 43:54.520]  down see criminals always when they come into a bank and get your hands up
[43:54.520 --> 43:58.760]  anybody moves I'm gonna blow your head off they want to scare you that's what
[43:58.760 --> 44:03.040]  the government does they're using less lethal weapons that's the real name for
[44:03.040 --> 44:06.360]  them and then upping the power of the taser upping the power of the microwave
[44:06.360 --> 44:10.480]  upping the power of the sound cannon until it starts killing people rubber
[44:10.480 --> 44:14.200]  bullets every few months start killing people in America and then it's more
[44:14.200 --> 44:18.280]  power rubble rubber bullets and then not just one out of 50 times but one out of
[44:18.280 --> 44:22.200]  10 you die then one out of three you die till everybody's just trained that you
[44:22.200 --> 44:28.920]  die when you protest you get arrested when you videotape police you disappear
[44:28.920 --> 44:34.840]  you lose your radio license when you criticize the government you get your
[44:34.840 --> 44:40.600]  website shut down you get your credit card turned off you get your PayPal
[44:40.600 --> 44:45.080]  turned off you better do what you're told and so everybody does what they're
[44:45.080 --> 44:53.160]  told and the sun fully sets and then what do they plan once that happens this
[44:53.160 --> 44:59.360]  particular elite doesn't just want to rob stuff if you have a tyranny like
[44:59.360 --> 45:03.360]  that it's bad the economy breaks down because nobody wants to produce anymore
[45:03.360 --> 45:06.440]  because somebody's just gonna steal it from you you kind of fall apart into a
[45:06.440 --> 45:14.920]  third-world type scenario we're not gonna be like Venezuela or Nigeria we're
[45:14.920 --> 45:21.720]  not gonna be that lucky we're a 21st century system bigger and better the
[45:21.720 --> 45:27.520]  center of the new world order eugenics empire we're gonna be killed we're gonna
[45:27.520 --> 45:33.200]  be tortured we're gonna be secretly arrested because that's the new economy
[45:33.200 --> 45:38.400]  that's the new scholarships that's the new way you think the US leading the
[45:38.400 --> 45:46.120]  world in prisons that's just the start and there's gonna be forced inoculations
[45:46.120 --> 45:50.520]  and all homeschooling is gonna be banned and everyone's gonna have their local
[45:50.520 --> 45:57.080]  rural affairs minder in your town
[45:57.760 --> 46:02.160]  has all been announced that's gonna come on your property and boss you around
[46:02.160 --> 46:08.920]  and give you fines and fees and if you get smart with them a SWAT team's gonna
[46:08.920 --> 46:12.840]  pull up an armored vehicle with a bunch of killers who served five or six tours
[46:12.840 --> 46:18.680]  and combat zones and they're gonna kill you and your family and they want you to
[46:18.680 --> 46:22.680]  get into a fight with them that's what they're planning and then there's gonna
[46:22.680 --> 46:30.360]  be a civil war and the bankers are gonna sit back in Europe and they're gonna
[46:30.360 --> 46:35.880]  laugh at it that's what they plan on happening
[46:38.520 --> 46:42.880]  I don't know could Americans wake up and say no hey we've got enough of world
[46:42.880 --> 46:48.720]  government enough of global corporate fascist rule enough of all this tyranny
[46:48.720 --> 46:54.840]  enough of it I don't know that's a question but the people steering us
[46:54.840 --> 47:05.960]  have a destination on record that is absolute despotism absolute deception
[47:05.960 --> 47:11.880]  remember fast and furious shipping guns into Mexico to blame the second
[47:11.880 --> 47:18.040]  amendment all caught thousands dead nobody gets in trouble billboards up
[47:18.040 --> 47:25.960]  across the country for 20 years just say report illegal guns and it's an image
[47:25.960 --> 47:29.880]  of a shotgun or a revolver and then when the carpet cleaner is in your house
[47:29.880 --> 47:33.960]  and sees a gun case they call the cops on you and the cops go ahead and come
[47:33.960 --> 47:38.520]  and go ahead and arrest you even though there's no law that happens all over the
[47:38.520 --> 47:45.920]  United States I see it in the newspaper every week I see it in the news where a
[47:45.920 --> 47:49.200]  realtor comes to your house and sees reloading equipment and a can of black
[47:49.200 --> 47:54.920]  powder you're going to jail it's on the news mr. Jones mr. Johnson mr. Smith was
[47:54.920 --> 47:59.960]  arrested for an arsenal you go look at the state law what is an arsenal there's
[47:59.960 --> 48:05.440]  no such thing and they've got jury so kept and so done a lot of times you go
[48:05.440 --> 48:10.920]  to jail you're like but that's not there's not even a law that's right
[48:10.920 --> 48:16.040]  there's no law they can take your kids we're not taking vaccines but they do
[48:16.800 --> 48:21.120]  see we're already under martial law and I haven't even gotten to this
[48:21.120 --> 48:24.800]  presentation yet and then I'm going to give the number up
[48:24.800 --> 48:37.440]  but I'm begging you to realize we're dealing with pure deception and
[48:37.440 --> 48:44.400]  manipulation and I'm begging the military and the police and others to not
[48:44.400 --> 48:49.360]  be cowardly everyone I know now goes you're right it's tyranny it's all
[48:49.360 --> 48:54.440]  coming true oh great that it doesn't make me happy I don't want to be right
[48:54.440 --> 49:00.040]  do you realize how dangerous it is to be Alex Jones and to be right and to have
[49:00.040 --> 49:08.160]  all this credibility you think the system likes the fact that I've made a
[49:08.160 --> 49:11.680]  study of everything they do and then I can guess 10 steps ahead what they're
[49:11.680 --> 49:14.840]  going to do you think you think they're happy about that you think they're
[49:14.840 --> 49:17.560]  happy about the fact I have millions of listeners they're trying to kick
[49:17.560 --> 49:23.800]  everybody else off the radio right now and they're trying with us the only
[49:23.800 --> 49:27.600]  chance we've got to beat these people is to stand up against them now here is the
[49:27.600 --> 49:38.560]  Attorney General when he was deputy Attorney General on C-SPAN in 1995 we're
[49:38.560 --> 49:44.360]  going to go out to break with this saying we need to brainwash the public
[49:44.360 --> 49:49.320]  and he goes on that he's met with all the executives of the media and he's
[49:49.320 --> 49:52.240]  asking him to really push anti-gun messages that's why it's in all the
[49:52.240 --> 49:56.840]  sitcoms the dramas the cop shows it's brainwashing and here he is saying it
[49:56.840 --> 50:01.400]  brainwashing go ahead so that we can get these ads so we can use these spots
[50:01.400 --> 50:06.360]  and not to give us one two o'clock in the morning ads when nobody's watching
[50:06.360 --> 50:10.120]  but at the time when people particularly young people are watching
[50:10.120 --> 50:13.640]  television so that when they're watching you know the Fresh Prince of Bel Air or
[50:13.640 --> 50:17.160]  or Martin or whatever else they watch and yeah I watch those things once in a
[50:17.160 --> 50:21.840]  while so that they'll see these ads and they'll be grabbed by these ads I
[50:21.840 --> 50:26.240] 've also asked people who have influence over youngsters entertainers
[50:26.240 --> 50:29.920]  athletes to be involved in this program as well but not only them
[50:29.920 --> 50:34.960]  community leaders Jesse Jackson Mayor Barry people who have credibility with
[50:34.960 --> 50:38.800]  young people should be on the television on the radio as much as we
[50:38.800 --> 50:42.280]  possibly can and telling these youngsters that it's wrong to carry a gun and
[50:42.280 --> 50:46.080]  if you have information about people who are carrying guns you've got to share
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.200]  that with Chief Thomas and with his people as well I've also asked the
[50:50.200 --> 50:55.560]  school board to make a part of every day some kind of anti-violence anti-gun
[50:55.560 --> 51:00.480]  message every day every school at every level one thing that I think is clear

[54:11.480 --> 54:16.720]  we're gonna play the rest of the clip or he says brainwashing and earlier in the
[54:16.720 --> 54:20.080]  three-minute snippet he's talking about I've met with the advertising
[54:20.080 --> 54:24.400]  executives the TV people we've got to get these messages out there we've got a
[54:24.400 --> 54:29.480]  literally brainwash and that's what all this is this idea that because there's
[54:29.480 --> 54:35.120]  crime you've got to turn your guns in this is a guy quoted supporting the
[54:35.120 --> 54:39.840]  complete abolition of the individual ownership of guns now you notice on the
[54:39.840 --> 54:43.240]  subject of Second Amendment we're turning the tide Al Gore was here in town
[54:43.240 --> 54:47.440]  last week for South West was quoted as saying he's losing the war for the
[54:47.440 --> 54:50.600]  environment now the globalist for the ones actually hurting the environment
[54:50.600 --> 54:54.680]  while creating strong in arguments about carbon dioxide just because they want
[54:54.680 --> 54:59.880]  to tax all human activity you see they are beginning to lose that's why they're
[54:59.880 --> 55:05.680]  taking the gloves off and we'll just take over via martial law now here's
[55:05.680 --> 55:10.400]  Eric Holder a guy whose memos have been declassified talking about covering up
[55:10.400 --> 55:14.800]  what really happened in Oklahoma City and I've talked to the eyewitnesses who
[55:14.800 --> 55:19.480]  saw the feds in their plant in the bombs but notice he's talking to the
[55:19.480 --> 55:23.040]  Justice Department people like a little kid well I like the fresh Prince of
[55:23.040 --> 55:27.960]  Bel Air it's like Obama he's out on St. Patty's day with a beer at the pub he's
[55:27.960 --> 55:35.680]  a nice guy a nice tyrant and again these tyrants come and go but the
[55:35.680 --> 55:41.320]  bureaucracy and the criminal interest their power expands and the NRA is on
[55:41.320 --> 55:45.320]  record saying they've got sources in the Justice Department and Obama's told
[55:45.320 --> 55:49.560]  Sarah Brady they're gonna get the guns by stealth that in the second term he is
[55:49.560 --> 55:52.880]  planning to use executive order to restrict the second amendment and guess
[55:52.880 --> 55:58.400]  what the ATF already did that last year we're in five southwestern states told
[55:58.400 --> 56:03.880]  him you're gonna now implement new gun regulations outside of law remember that
[56:03.880 --> 56:12.320]  and had the nerve to blame it on something that they'd themselves cause
[56:12.320 --> 56:16.560]  the ship and the guns into Mexico now here's Paul Watson's article Obama
[56:16.560 --> 56:24.360]  executive order paves way for nationalization of the economy and Paul
[56:24.360 --> 56:28.920]  goes through it all it's a Paul Watson Alex Jones article we're gonna read this
[56:28.920 --> 56:33.080]  I'm gonna go over what martial law is when we get into the next hour then I'm
[56:33.080 --> 56:41.680]  gonna open the phones up for police and military to specifically call in let's go
[56:41.680 --> 56:46.480]  ahead and go back to the attorney general with his brainwashing quote here it
[56:46.480 --> 56:52.000]  is I've also asked the school board to make a part of every day some kind of
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.680]  anti-violence anti-gun message every day every school at every level one thing
[56:57.680 --> 57:01.600]  that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just
[57:01.600 --> 57:06.000]  have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a
[57:06.000 --> 57:09.880]  Monday and then only do it every Monday we need to do this every day of the week
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.080]  and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly
[57:14.080 --> 57:19.040]  different way we also want to have a hotline that we will set up and have the
[57:19.040 --> 57:22.000]  number of that hotline that we just go out there and that would be something
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.960]  that people would have emblazoned in their mind so that when they see a gun
[57:24.960 --> 57:28.960]  or become familiar about the facts of a gun crime they would call that hotline
[57:28.960 --> 57:32.760]  and pass that information thank you back it back up to the brainwashing part
[57:32.760 --> 57:42.160]  please thank you now notice he said make part of the school day anti-gun and
[57:42.160 --> 57:45.120]  that's when you put your kids in a government training center public
[57:45.120 --> 57:48.880]  schools whether they're rural no matter where you live whether it's Alabama or
[57:48.880 --> 57:53.760]  Texas where you think it's pro-gun or Vermont it's anti-gun what does mommy and
[57:53.760 --> 57:59.240]  daddy own the feds are out of control taking over everything notice he said
[57:59.240 --> 58:04.880]  the hotline there are people telephone repair people cable people making more
[58:04.880 --> 58:11.120]  money per year in tattletale money then they do on their regular job while
[58:11.120 --> 58:17.060]  they're in your house and the cops still come because they're told even if the
[58:17.060 --> 58:21.280]  guns legal let's go check it out and then you get a knock-and-talk hi we
[58:21.280 --> 58:25.520]  hear there's some firearms mind if we look at them I mean they do this in rural
[58:25.520 --> 58:30.360]  areas now and and they're just getting the cops ready to be scum
[58:30.360 --> 58:35.400]  secret police enemies of this country you better decide which side you're on
[58:35.400 --> 58:45.240]  the Attorney General is a criminal terrorist this is GCN the Genesis
[58:45.240 --> 58:53.280]  communications radio network I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of

[58:57.640 --> 59:01.560]  body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key
[59:01.560 --> 59:06.560]  vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was
[59:06.560 --> 59:11.080]  eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at

[1:00:36.920 --> 1:00:41.560]  interests want the United States is an engine of world domination and they want
[1:00:41.560 --> 1:00:45.880]  the American people's property and all over the country under agenda 21 they're
[1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:50.840]  taking people's property that is the essence of martial law is a suspension
[1:00:50.840 --> 1:00:55.600]  of due process private property right to assemble all of its happening like
[1:00:55.600 --> 1:01:03.800]  clockwork habeas corpus and we come back I'm gonna attempt in just one segment to

[1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:27.560]  defense over the whole thing Congress is not involved that is the essence of
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:32.640]  martial law as well I mean they have hit every point if there was say a list of
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:38.560]  20 things to give you martial law they've double checked each one of them I

[1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:10.240]  Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:14.920 --> 1:08:26.080]  I'm about to cover the fact that martial law is being incrementally
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:33.160]  established permanently as the new form of government here in the United States
[1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:39.120]  with what's left of county city and state and federal government basically
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:45.400]  keeping its name intact but operating as pure auxiliaries of the Defense
[1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:53.680]  Department itself controlled by puppet presidents 100% installed and run by six
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:59.680]  global megabanks who have openly dominated almost every nation of the
[1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:06.280]  world and are in the process right now of mopping up a few final countries now
[1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:10.760]  we're not just being usurped by powerful elites that simply wish to rule and own
[1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:18.640]  the public these control freaks crave power because they are eugenicists they
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:23.760]  absolutely hate humanity they believe that they are superhuman and that you are
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:30.120]  detestable trash who is subhuman and deserves to be basically poisoned and
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:36.120]  work to death and then euthanized now before I get into this special report
[1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:41.600]  on martial law that's finally getting a major nationwide attention I want to
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:45.800]  just add that you need to understand that they're bringing in martial law and
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:51.480]  overthrowing checks and balances and due process because you can't have a total
[1:09:51.480 --> 1:09:56.240]  command and control system that has due process you can't have automated
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:10:00.800]  computer systems that order the police to arrest somebody you can't have people
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:07.280]  disappear into gulags that the NDA supposedly legalizes of course you
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:13.600]  can't legalize tyranny so it's a fraud if you still have due process and a lot
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:16.840]  of people say well I have nothing to worry about I'm going along with the
[1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:24.000]  system the system wants to use and abuse you just because you're a nice
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:28.560]  person doesn't mean someone won't try to break into your house and tie you up
[1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:32.040]  while they rape your wife and children in front of you and then slit their
[1:10:32.040 --> 1:10:37.040]  throats just because you're a nice person didn't mean the Soviets wouldn't
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:43.440]  invade Poland the Ukraine or Romania or Czechoslovakia and arrest daddy and he's
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:47.600]  never seen again and rape mommy they're in the kitchen in front of the little
[1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:54.480]  kids you naive people who've lived in the shadow of freedom that our forebears
[1:10:54.480 --> 1:11:02.600]  paid for in blood have no idea the hell gates you're opening I said it hell
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:09.240]  gates all of you trendies that just buy into this idea of a liberal persona it's
[1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:14.760]  a persona there's nothing liberal about Obama and Eric Holder and Janet
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:20.600]  Napolitano and any of them these are dangerous authoritarians but they
[1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:25.600]  themselves are nothing but minions of the completely cold-blooded Goldman
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:30.720]  sacks and JP Morgan Chase that runs the whole show globally on record now
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:35.480]  remember world governments now admitted the solution to world problems created
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:40.480]  by the megabanks is world government technocratic systems run by them all
[1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:44.720]  over Europe they're removing elected leaders installing bankers as the heads
[1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:51.960]  of the country malaria is spreading cholera you name it in Greece it was the
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:59.720]  jewel now rotting in just a year imploded by design austerity is coming here
[1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:06.760]  they are flicking the switches in the control room image that martial law was
[1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:10.840]  in place and ready to come out of moth balls now they're flicking the switches
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:16.880]  turning it on powering it up and you know when they're getting ready to move
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:23.720]  with new wars new false flag stage terror attacks media censorship false flags on
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:27.320]  the internet you know when they're getting ready to move when they start
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:32.520]  preconditioning the public for it and they're doing it on all fronts right now
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:42.920]  moving quickly I don't want to look back later and wish that we would have done
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:49.880]  more now now you and your gut as a bureaucrat as an enforcer of this system
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:55.520]  whether in the military a police officer or a bureaucrat that commands them or
[1:12:55.520 --> 1:12:59.960]  any of these systems I know you've been given a false template of compartmentalization
[1:12:59.960 --> 1:13:04.160]  of why you do what you do filled with kernels of truth but if you look at
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:08.720]  general history common sense what our forebearers warned us about the track
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:14.000]  record we have with this government and I say that loosely you know we're in bad
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:19.120]  shape I don't really know anybody that denies that anymore but people say well
[1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:23.360]  what are you gonna do about it just keep your head down no at times like this in
[1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:29.640]  history keeping your head down is not the right move if you're being chased by
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:34.000]  ten wolves through the forest you don't get your head down and get in a fetal
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:42.680]  position and cry for mommy you get into a small cave and block the entrance you
[1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:47.200]  climb a tree or you get up on a high ground with some boulders and you stand
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:54.800]  in fight you do not get in a fetal position and kiss your behind goodbye I
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:05.720]  hope everybody understands that now the Psyop works like this it's been done
[1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:09.920]  incrementally if you look at the definitions of martial law that we have
[1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:13.920]  linked in this big article by Paul Joseph Watson that's red linked on info
[1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:19.080]  wars.com it's also mirrored at prisonplanet.com Obama executive order
[1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:25.080]  paves the way for nationalization of entire economy government greases the
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:30.120]  skids for America's grease style meltdown and that's always been the
[1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:37.680]  public plan now the national defense resources preparedness takes cold war
[1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:48.120]  1950 emergency legislation that is put into place to be activated if Congress
[1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:55.200]  gets destroyed by a Soviet nuke strike so Congress got tricked into letting this
[1:14:55.200 --> 1:15:01.240]  be on the books for a nuke strike basically continuity of government
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:07.840]  Obama changes it to say any emergency including economic which Bush did in
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:12.160]  his presidential decision directive and executive order in 2008 that we made a
[1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:15.560]  big deal out of people are like okay well Bush did it do now Obama's doing it
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:21.600]  the point is is that everything in those old orders is being updated and is now
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:27.400]  being implemented that's why this is so important it's one thing to have a plan
[1:15:27.400 --> 1:15:35.480]  on the shelf that's dangerous enough it's another thing to begin to activate
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:40.160]  it what do you think it is when the TSA is not just in airports but on
[1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:44.920]  highways pulling people over without warrants commanding local police no
[1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:50.160]  jurisdiction no they're not even federally or state sworn not bonded it's
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:55.760]  totally illegal but they say it's legal under the emergency that's why they
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:59.600]  declare a new emergency every year in Congress they've only got a new reason
[1:15:59.600 --> 1:16:04.800]  but it's under that emergency declaration since the 1933 war powers the
[1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:12.120]  1947 National Security Act the 1915 National Defense Resources preparedness
[1:16:12.120 --> 1:16:19.400]  and all of these are just tweaking's of systems of martial law and reauthorizations
[1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:24.720]  and then rearranging who's in command John Warren Defense Authorization Act
[1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:31.040]  2007 says prepare for insurrection not just by citizens but by the states
[1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:35.600]  prepare a governor's council to operate and speak for all 50 appointed by the
[1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:39.800]  president the public will still see 10 governors that's in the definitions
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:44.120]  blacks law has about 10 pages was reading it last night this morning on
[1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:49.000]  martial law and it's different permutations but it's governors with
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:52.520]  military power have you watched during a flood how its military generals at
[1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:57.760]  FEMA now under big sis have you watched how during tornadoes its generals under
[1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:01.080]  Homeland Security have you watched how the whole power structure is going to
[1:17:01.080 --> 1:17:06.560]  military people under North come it fits all the definitions checkpoints
[1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:13.800]  curfews suspension of the fourth amendment open warrantless spying head of
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:19.160]  the CIA last week in a speech saying we spy on all of you without warrants there

[1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:32.640]  the wire magazine back up thank you people that are watching on prison
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:37.360]  planet TV why are they now admitting all this why are they saying yeah we'll
[1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:41.000]  secretly arrest you for any reason and disappear you because they've got to get
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:45.720]  the military and the contractors a lot of them foreign government contractors
[1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:51.440]  are here that's in FEMA document in L. E. O. 9 and others in the John Warren
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:55.600]  defense authorization act it treasonously traitorously in the most
[1:17:55.600 --> 1:18:06.240]  brazen puts the fueled bravada I've ever seen says the Pentagon will move into
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:10.720]  the states and governors and legislators they're saying if the
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:15.920]  legislature doesn't do what they're told the feds will move armor in and take
[1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:20.640]  the capitals that's in the John Warren defense authorization act what did they
[1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:26.080]  say last year when they unanimously passed in the house to ban the TSA from
[1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:30.240]  touching people's genitals they don't even do that in communist China or
[1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:42.280]  North Korea what did they say they said we'll run an air blockade we'll run an
[1:18:42.280 --> 1:18:48.360]  air blockade with f-16s of Texas and shoot down any aircraft that enter that's
[1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:55.760]  John Warren defense authorization act we are in deep trouble now why is the
[1:18:55.760 --> 1:19:01.120]  system doing this that's the $64 million question we come back from break I'm
[1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:04.000]  gonna address that and then we'll give the number out and talk to police and

[1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:18.280]  now it's very simple and I want to be clear about this the United States has
[1:24:18.280 --> 1:24:25.240]  been criminally conquered the washington post time magazine financial times of
[1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:29.560]  London they all brag every time I pick one up about yeah big mega banks run
[1:24:29.560 --> 1:24:34.000]  things now yeah we don't even need local governments anymore the experts are
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:37.120]  running things you won't be voting anymore in your town or city this is
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:40.880]  happening all over the US no a corporation's gonna run your town now
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:46.240]  in some cases big cities and guess what we're tripling your power and water
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:52.600]  prices oh it's so we make bigger profits don't like it move somewhere else but
[1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:57.560]  we're taking over there too and this is so you can't get due process this is so
[1:24:57.560 --> 1:25:02.960]  they can exempt themselves from lawsuits this is so the criminals that have
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:06.880]  hijacked our nation can have their way with us and who's at the top of the
[1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:12.400]  pyramid Goldman Sachs one of their top executives went public last week saying
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:16.440]  we're there to cheat our customers and we call them scum and muppets and
[1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:23.000]  idiots and I can't do it anymore that's the attitude let's rip people off they're
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:27.960]  just total criminals again who ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:31.840]  Amendment and remember what the Attorney General just got caught saying from a
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:39.160]  tape back in 95 let's brainwash the public to be anti-gun and when you see
[1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:43.640]  a gun call the police and that's why when the telephone guys in your house he
[1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:47.760]  calls the cops on you even though the guns legal this is what they've turned
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:53.320]  us into a nation of snitches reporting to a bunch of criminals they want the
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:26:00.080]  martial law in because the normal law and the system of due process and the
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:05.120]  Constitution is like holy water to a vampire it's what will send them to
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:10.920]  prison so they want to get rid of it so they can steal at an even greater level
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:19.600]  arrest their political opposition and can't get in trouble it's elementary
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:24.400]  every tyranny ends up falling though because the elites and their minions
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:28.240]  just start stealing at every level and the elite will never go after their own
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:33.600]  minions because you know that would be you know bad for morale and so everybody
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:38.120]  just starts stealing and then everything falls apart
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:44.440]  and I was reading the black's law definition of martial law typically
[1:26:44.440 --> 1:26:47.480]  the imposition of martial law the company's curfews those are going
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:53.800]  everywhere the suspension of civil law civil rights everywhere it's happening
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:57.680]  no protest arrest you for filming police habeas corpus they're getting rid of
[1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:03.360]  that NDA and the application or extension of military law or military
[1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:09.720]  justice civilians the police act like military now civilians defying martial
[1:27:09.720 --> 1:27:13.520]  law and be subjected to military tribunal you don't even get a military
[1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:20.240]  tribunal under NDA you just they just kill you it's beyond even martial law
[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:30.040]  it's just total mafia serial killer government I mean folks they grow the
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:35.080]  opium in front of everyone on the news now because the trips are going I won't
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:38.600]  do this I'm gonna tell people oh really watch this they put the troops grow the
[1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:45.960]  opium move along I want to read you this Cicero quote and we're gonna come back
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:51.600]  and take calls from police and military only please a nation can survive its
[1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:57.240]  fools and even the ambitious but it cannot survive treason from within an
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:03.000]  enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is known and carries his banner
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  openly but the traitor moves amongst those within the gates freely his sly
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:13.160]  whispers rustling through all the alleys heard in the very halls of the
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:19.600]  government itself for the traitor appears not a traitor he speaks in the
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:24.680]  accents familiar to his victims and he wears their face and their arguments he
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:30.440]  appears to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men he rots the
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:35.920]  soul of the nation by design I would add he works secretly and unknown in the
[1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:43.240]  night under national security to undermine the pillars of the city he
[1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:49.160]  infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist a murderer is less to
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:56.240]  fear the traitor is the plague Marcus Tulia Cicero ancient Roman lawyer writer
[1:28:56.240 --> 1:29:06.280]  scholar orator and member of the Senate statesman 106 BC to 43 BC resisted
[1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:21.120]  Caesar was killed by one that came after Caesar let it be known that this was to
[1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:26.720]  come to pass as this nation went into bondage America for all intents and
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:32.720]  purposes is dead has been conquered is gone but countries are not like people
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:39.960]  who die but once countries are ideas and we could rise from the ashes like the
[1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:45.920]  mythical Phoenix anytime we wanted to but we have to admit that we have an
[1:29:45.920 --> 1:29:52.440]  illegitimate criminal group running the nation we're on the march the empires on
[1:29:52.440 --> 1:30:02.360]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a little over a year ago I'm
[1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:06.480]  began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal
[1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:10.640]  that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[1:30:10.640 --> 1:30:14.200]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:18.200]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:23.040]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:27.440]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best

[1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:35.480]  states Obama executive order paves the way for nationalization of the economy
[1:33:35.480 --> 1:33:39.800]  and of course as you know I'm the individual more than anybody that's
[1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:44.480]  warned of military takeover the United States through foreign banks I told you
[1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:49.040]  Europe would be collapsed through derivatives fraud 12 13 years ago I've
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:53.160]  broken down exactly how they would do it what it would look like how they would
[1:33:53.160 --> 1:33:57.360]  roll it out because it's in their documents now all the different news
[1:33:57.360 --> 1:34:01.200]  outlets that are analyzing this executive order are stating that oh yeah
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:05.760]  Obama says he can take over all industry work brigades oh this is terrible
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:09.680]  what folks haven't done is actually gone and looked at all the company
[1:34:09.680 --> 1:34:17.360]  executive orders and us code and COG that this mentions because that's where
[1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:22.920]  you really find everything national draft for military work brigades
[1:34:22.920 --> 1:34:30.000]  everything now does it mean they're gonna ever implement all of this no but
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:37.440]  they're trying to and this is a group who's been caught shipping guns into
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:40.760]  Mexico to blame it on their political enemies I mean that's diabolical
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:45.760]  imagine what else they're up to now I want to hear from active-duty military
[1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:48.960]  and police and I'll go to you quickly you can make your point I'll move the
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:53.640]  next person about this because the reason we're covering it today after
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:57.920]  probably talking about this I don't know more than a thousand times in the
[1:34:57.920 --> 1:35:04.120]  last 17 years on air is because now it's all starting to move quicker it's on
[1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:10.680]  the same trajectory but accelerating and people are finally getting it but this
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:16.640]  is bipartisan this goes back to Eisenhower again under nuclear attack
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:20.320]  they put this in place this is not for nuclear attack Obama's changing it to
[1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:25.920]  say any disaster any emergency repeating what Bush did but he's moving to
[1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:33.520]  activate it and remember Obama announced we need a domestic security force
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:38.120]  just as big just as strong remember that quote in fact guys later I'm gonna
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:41.760]  play the brainwashing clip by the Attorney General one more time brainwash
[1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:45.440]  folks you know against the Second Amendment tell people to call and report
[1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:50.000]  guns even if they're legal I want to play that clip again but then just we've
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:53.600]  got it in the computer but it's it's Obama calls for national security force
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:36:02.440]  and we'll pull that up but I want to give the number out for police and
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:05.440]  military because you know police military calling they go yeah we know
[1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:08.680]  we're being trained for this but it's your job as a citizen to stop it or it's
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:12.920]  Congress's job yeah I know that but historically it's the police and
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:20.040]  military saying no in East Germany or in Romania or in Czechoslovakia or in so
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:25.160]  many other areas that ends up stopping this I mean I'm asking you here's my
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:30.480]  question is there any order you won't follow I mean do you realize the Bill
[1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:34.040]  of Rights Constitution that's why we love America and hang flags outside our
[1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:38.440]  doors that's why we appreciate the military when the military becomes an
[1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:43.000]  instrument to overthrow that it becomes an anathema I'm not saying the German
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:46.960]  military was bad pre-Hitler most of them under Hitler didn't even agree with
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:53.520]  him but they followed orders you've got to say no I mean do you agree with me do
[1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:57.320]  you disagree are you concerned when they put out an executive order and say we
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:37:01.480]  can suspend Congress the president runs things under the Department of Defense
[1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:08.920]  will have 10 governors that run the country toll-free number 800-259-9231
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:19.040]  800-259-9231 but first I want to play the attorney general clip one more time
[1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:28.240]  this is from 1995 17 years ago and he was deputy attorney general the memos
[1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:32.000]  there've been lawsuits for years they've come out where he's saying we got to
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:36.400]  cover up okay see this is our number one priority what you want to cover up
[1:37:36.400 --> 1:37:42.040]  buddy boy we know ran another false flag didn't you shipping the guns into
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:48.880]  Mexico blaming it on the Second Amendment I mean I'm here risking my life
[1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:54.960]  to expose these criminals none of us are safe I'm not gonna be a coward and sit
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:59.720]  here and hold back what I say they've got to be brought to justice but how do
[1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:02.640]  you bring the UN to justice for war crimes when they're in charge of that
[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:06.640]  how do you bring the attorney general to justice for fast and furious when he's
[1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:11.820]  in charge of justice that's what tyranny is when the bad guys get the high
[1:38:11.820 --> 1:38:17.560]  ground and again why are they trying to fall out all these martial law
[1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:21.920]  provisions right now and add cherries on top that were never there of they can
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:25.600]  disappear people because they want to be able to tell the Merck's look you got a
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:29.800]  law start killing make it look like a heart attack we don't want his body
[1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:34.520]  ever found make it look like a carjacking
[1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:41.760]  where are the men let's go ahead and go to the attorney general here it is we
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:45.880]  need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into
[1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:50.880]  thinking about guns in a vastly different way we also want to have a hotline
[1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:54.720]  that we will set up and have the number of that hotline that would just go out
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:57.440]  there and that would be something that people would have emblazoned in their
[1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:01.200]  mind so that when they see a gun or become familiar about the facts of a gun
[1:39:01.200 --> 1:39:07.400]  crime they would call that hotline and pass that information okay so there you
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:11.320]  go and we're gonna play the clip of Obama talking about his national
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:17.040]  domestic security force on record your preachers executives even over small
[1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:21.000]  companies are even giving them license to kill that came out five years ago
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:24.520]  about infra guard where they've got executives ready to take phone calls on
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:29.800]  people to kill that work for them you bet they're the president saying he can
[1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:34.600]  kill whoever he wants they've got want to be hitman everywhere these criminals
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:39.680]  are so out of control they're trying to hire local executives and giving them
[1:39:39.680 --> 1:39:47.800]  license to kill 007 type behavior so you notice they never give that to the
[1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:50.640]  police and military because you're actually professional and trained they
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:58.160]  created TSA they create a brown shirt they create these goon forces who they
[1:39:58.160 --> 1:40:01.680]  can later flush down the toilet when they're done with them all right I want
[1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:07.280]  to go to your phone calls Brian in Ohio's a police officer Lou in Ohio just
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:14.360]  active two months ago Eric in Texas a police officer blaze Alaska airborne
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:18.880]  infantry let's go to Brian in Ohio we'll go to them as they came in listening
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:22.160]  Ohio police officer show what do you think about all the stuff that's going
[1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:28.960]  on well you know first of all I'll say I'm a big fan I just hope my eyes woke up
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:34.520]  about two or three years ago and listen to you try to listen to you every day
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:39.000]  especially I'm working out or something like that but uh you know as far as the
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:43.040]  uh Eric Holder and the the whole brainwashing and weapons thing you know
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:48.000]  I don't know how effective that's going to be I mean where I work at police
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.640]  officers in my department especially me I can't say all of them but most of them
[1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:58.040]  love the new care you can feel while we have an Ohio that came about a few years
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:01.240]  ago I think yeah that's kind of scare all the bad guys doesn't it because the
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:06.480]  crime rapist plunge when you have that you know I think I I think it did we
[1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:09.720]  had we've had a few instances on the street where people have gotten robbed
[1:41:09.720 --> 1:41:14.960]  and we were able to return fire from their concierge carry a weapon and that
[1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:18.280]  doesn't match it out to the street especially with a lot of young punks
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:23.560]  out there um let me ask you a question are the police starting to wake up that
[1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:29.800]  that a secret arrest and things like that is not good well as far as where I
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:35.360]  work at it's a big city in Ohio and I don't think we've gotten to the point
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:41.840]  where we've been exposing like that yet I know I haven't one of things I always
[1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:46.880]  wanted to call talk to you about is at least for where I work we are we're
[1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:50.120]  kind of just we don't see ourselves as working for the government we are we
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:54.600]  kind of see ourselves as local crime fighters that's the way it should be but
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:59.320]  my point is the feds are starting to take over and that's why there's going to
[1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:03.280]  be a collision you got record gun sales the people said because they don't trust
[1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:07.240]  the federal government most the police I talked to are awake now most the
[1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:13.880]  military's away so well I don't see how this is gonna you know basically wash
[1:42:13.880 --> 1:42:20.560]  out then when you've got the public waking up and the feds power grabbing
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:26.840]  yeah I'm interested like you said you know police officers you're waking up
[1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:29.840]  and a lot of them you know don't necessarily want to be woken up to a
[1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:33.080]  certain extent because like I said they're they're innocent in their own
[1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:37.040]  ways of just being crime fighters they're not out here trying to you know
[1:42:37.040 --> 1:42:40.720]  protect dignitaries or work for corporations or they're not trying to
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:48.040]  you know make make arrests at protest that distance we just come to work we
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:52.960]  respond to calls that the citizens give us and we try our best to help people out
[1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:57.360]  and we try our best to get the bad guy and sometimes we give them sometimes we
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:02.960]  don't and you know I'd like to think of it as we don't do what we do on day-to-day
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:10.360]  basis on behalf of the government we do it on behalf of honest innocent people
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:13.600]  what do you do when you have these idiots that have never owned a gun and
[1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:17.140]  watched sitcoms and they think you're supposed to report somebody who's got a
[1:43:17.140 --> 1:43:20.720]  shotgun in a gun case because they're over at their house delivering say
[1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:25.160]  couches and then and then they call the hotline and say I'm over here and this
[1:43:25.160 --> 1:43:30.640]  guy's got a shotgun well that that has never happened to me I'm not gonna tell
[1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:35.920]  you a story about a month ago there was a 17 year old girl that lived in a house
[1:43:35.920 --> 1:43:41.800]  with her parents of course she had her own her own child 17 she was the biggest
[1:43:41.800 --> 1:43:47.280]  brat in the world she called the police because her father just realized that
[1:43:47.280 --> 1:43:52.920]  his wife was cheating on him and he got angry and was you know throwing things
[1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:57.360]  around the house and he made a threat just to just to them vocally that he's
[1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:01.640]  gonna kill this guy well he was just angry we talked to him because we had
[1:44:01.640 --> 1:44:04.900]  called over because she called the police and said that she wanted him
[1:44:04.900 --> 1:44:08.520]  arrested and brought him to move the house and she wants confiscated guns
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:13.080]  because he's got guns and he made threats to kill somebody and he's dangerous
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:18.880]  well we showed up basically whacked in her face and told her that you know we
[1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:22.400]  can do that and we're not gonna do that good because in a lot of areas they
[1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:25.680]  would have taken his guns well God bless you good to hear from you that's
[1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:30.240]  what we need to hear it's this idea of just you know go after everybody and
[1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:35.000]  and in the so-called liberals as they call themselves love to use the system
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:39.560]  against people and I'm sick of it okay now again I'm asking the military and
[1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:44.120]  police though here what are you gonna do is all this starts unfolding because
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:50.360]  Obama is falling out nuclear war provisions but he's saying for economic
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:58.240]  emergency to nationalize farms ranches transportation water everything and
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:02.960]  even mainline scholars it's all over the news are saying this is martial law our
[1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:08.040]  people concerned about this Lou in Ohio active duty just two months ago go ahead
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:14.000]  love hey Alex love you brother I honestly want to thank you about two years
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:17.560]  into my service and Army special operations I started watching some of
[1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:22.920]  your documentaries and started reading a little Jim Mars and when my ETS they
[1:45:22.920 --> 1:45:28.800]  came up I got out there as fast as I could I I just want to say that there
[1:45:28.800 --> 1:45:33.280]  are two things that I really feel like we need to be doing one I know we got we
[1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:37.480]  got some lawyers you have to know some lawyers on our side right they're quite
[1:45:37.480 --> 1:45:43.360]  a few well let's get the evidence let's get the witnesses of this voter fraud
[1:45:43.360 --> 1:45:48.200]  let's put it in the courts and let's force them to acknowledge our rights we
[1:45:48.200 --> 1:45:51.720]  can't let this slide we got you know we got all these people behind Ron Paul this
[1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:59.000]  year if we just take this sitting down how are we gonna recover from that well
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:02.040]  you're right and I intend to get into that in the next hour that was actually
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:08.000]  next on my list video of the election fraud the fact that he did start winning
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:13.320]  a bunch of delegates and they had the police come in and arrest them and they
[1:46:13.320 --> 1:46:17.040]  admitted that it was part of a regular delegate fight and that that's how it's
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:21.600]  normally done but this time they arrested the Ron Paul supporters and gave
[1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:26.920]  the delegates to Mitt Romney and of course you're alluding to that and there
[1:46:26.920 --> 1:46:30.840]  was election fraud in Iowa there was election fraud in Maine a hundred percent
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:35.200]  confirmed in Maine that that Ron Paul won and they just didn't give it to him
[1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:41.000]  that's what I'm saying what do you do when they're doing stuff like that well I
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:44.480]  think the second thing we need to do is we need to make it clear to the GOP that
[1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:48.800]  we're not voting as Republicans we're not voting for Ron Paul as a Republican
[1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:52.520]  we're voting for Ron Paul and if he doesn't get it we're not going to vote
[1:46:52.520 --> 1:46:56.520]  for Mitt Romney so if they steal it from him they're not gonna get their
[1:46:56.520 --> 1:47:01.240]  candidate in because his votes are leaving listen I got a whole stack on
[1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:06.800]  that and I promise I'm gonna get to that and it's important but soon it won't
[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:11.160]  even matter when you've got the federal government activating all these martial
[1:47:11.160 --> 1:47:16.840]  law provisions as fast as they can they're doing that for a reason they're
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:21.240]  getting ready for a bigger economic collapse and Iran war it may be a big
[1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:27.800]  false flag all I know is danger danger will Robinson and we've got to make the
[1:47:27.800 --> 1:47:31.720]  fact that impeachment proceedings that can lead to the impeachment of Obama
[1:47:31.720 --> 1:47:36.680]  have begun in the house it's not getting any coverage over the fact that he's
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:40.080]  launching wars when the president's launching wars without congressional
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:45.720]  approval folks that's martial law when he's turning off power plants outside of
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:50.040]  law so his buddies make more money with their plants that's martial law when
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:54.440]  they're federalizing things that's martial law martial law just means doing
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:48:02.200]  what you want rule of the dictator rule of the hunter let's go to Erica taxes
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:06.640]  who is a police officer go ahead Eric thank you for holding yes sir I
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:10.240]  appreciate you taking my call I hope you can hear me okay I've been kind of
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:15.040]  under the weather though I can hear you a couple of things real quick number one
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:19.640]  I just want to say the establishment is scared of us okay or else they wouldn't
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:26.000]  be pushing this federalized takeover of law enforcement and in general okay they
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:29.480]  want to get us under their thumb yeah they're criminals they're criminals yeah
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:34.200]  and the mafia wants to take over every department and every jury and grand jury
[1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:39.680]  in the country so they can really engage in some crime right but we're not a
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:43.960]  bunch of dumb gorillas okay I can tell you that right now a police officer I'm
[1:48:43.960 --> 1:48:48.320]  a firearms instructor tactics instructor I preach to my guys all the time the
[1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:54.920]  message of both keepers the message of the Constitution and I can just tell you
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:58.840]  when it comes down to those questions that you're asking you know will you
[1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:02.760]  obey when they tell you to do something illegal something unconstitutional
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:07.800]  there's a whole lot of police officers that are not going to do it I'm I'm big
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:11.800]  on preaching this I wear I'm a lifetime member of both keepers I wear my
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:15.960]  keeper t-shirt with my gun and badge all the time I wear info wars t-shirts with
[1:49:15.960 --> 1:49:18.440]  my gun and badge all the time and I would encourage other officers to do the
[1:49:18.440 --> 1:49:22.440]  same because the citizenry looks at that I can't tell you how many times people
[1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:26.640]  have come up to me and said man I love that t-shirt I love that message they're
[1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:31.640]  looking to police officers and the military to to provide some leadership
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:37.440]  form we live in dark times but I think if we will get that message out there
[1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:41.320]  you know taking flyers to the grocery store I take them with my kids put up
[1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:45.560]  flyers at the grocery store you know info wars stuff we've got to get aggressive
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:49.440]  and start your own organization but listen I can hear it in your either
[1:49:49.440 --> 1:49:53.680]  spirit that you're putting out here is one of truth as bad as stuff is folks
[1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:57.520]  we haven't gone down the slide yet this I just got chills this is the
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:01.760]  preparation that means these are really bad people that have taken over the
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:05.640]  federal government they are the nastiest types you can imagine we're all
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:10.480]  in danger folks and America knows that look at the gun sales is that not a
[1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:14.560]  positive thing I'm gonna hold you over but is that not positive that is a
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:20.200]  beautiful thing I am all about the arms citizenry I think it's a beautiful thing
[1:50:20.200 --> 1:50:23.760]  let me ask you this question what do you do that when they do dirty tricks and
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:26.960]  blow stuff up and blame it on libertarian conservatives to try to turn the
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:30.120]  police and military against each other you know they're not they're not just
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:33.200]  gonna launch this takeover without staging some stuff I want to ask you
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:38.040]  about that when we come back then we'll go to Joseph blaze and we got Corey
[1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:41.720]  that was so many calls coming in eight after we've got a famous civil rights
[1:50:41.720 --> 1:50:45.440]  activist joining us now look forward to that because it turns out he was with
[1:50:45.440 --> 1:50:51.320]  George Clooney last week and again I don't like what's being done to the
[1:50:51.320 --> 1:50:56.880]  Christians in Sudan so it's a complex issue we'll be discussing that as well

[1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:14.960]  used to cover urban warfare drills some of them that were unannounced I see
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:20.360]  people saying I'm a liar I'd say it says if they pulled guns on you Alex
[1:54:20.360 --> 1:54:25.880]  where is the video BS as usual remember 9-11 says that's posted in the article
[1:54:25.880 --> 1:54:31.360]  Obama executive order paves the way for nationalization of economy did you not
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:39.280]  hear what I said they took our camera and erased the tape that's why Mike
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:43.400]  Hansen said I'm not giving you my camera that's why there's not footage more
[1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:50.800]  on ask Mike Hansen and point is we've got footage in Hebron Maryland of them
[1:54:50.800 --> 1:54:54.800]  coming up to the camera guy with their guns the Marines and saying turn your
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:55:00.440]  camera off you know I don't have footage of me in the woods at night an urban
[1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:09.280]  warfare drill and oh it doesn't matter it you know it's just crazy it's just
[1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:15.240]  crazy how people want to deny what's going on out there you know what I
[1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:19.840]  didn't get confiscated is the San Antonio police chief who's in police
[1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:25.480]  state 2000 saying Delta Force tried to buy him off to let him you know give
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:29.800]  them control the city basically to run secret operations that's how the bags
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:34.360]  of money so sorry it's all there and footage of the drills that still went
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:39.400]  ahead even though he said no don't try to deny this tyranny's happening I also
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:43.320]  saw a comment another story saying there's Jones again on the video I
[1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:47.520]  shot yesterday at home saying Obama wants a domestic security force what a
[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:53.240]  liar okay well FEMA's announced it Friday under Secure Corps in AmeriCorps
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:59.080]  you go look at the fine print it's little domestic spies but here's Obama in
[1:55:59.080 --> 1:56:04.040]  the campaign talking about it so sick of you people living in denial out there
[1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:11.520]  we have the clip correct well let's roll it we cannot continue to rely only on
[1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:15.680]  our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:20.400]  said we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as
[1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:26.560]  powerful just as strong just as well funded all right yep there it is none of
[1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:30.600]  that's gonna happen America though now he's actually doing it and the NRA says
[1:56:30.600 --> 1:56:35.440]  their lobbyist sources have told him the NRA is pretty milk dust and I looked
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:41.680]  it up it's true Obama does plan to attempt an executive order ban of all
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:47.560]  semi-automatics in the next administration so enjoy they're gonna
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:50.960]  come going back to the police office they're gonna go to break for one minute
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:55.040]  come back with Joseph Blaze and Corey and others Eric you heard my question
[1:56:55.040 --> 1:57:00.840]  before the break you know I mean are police aware that the system can stage
[1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:06.520]  events like an Oklahoma City to try to get a civil war going you bet let me
[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:10.080]  give you an example of that some recent training that I conducted we had an
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:14.760]  agent from online security that came in to quote-unquote observe it okay during
[1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:19.280]  that training he told some of my guys hey you know I can hook you guys up with
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:22.280]  doing some undercover stuff for us if you want to come out to the local airport

[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:35.560]  that I was like how many of you think that that's a really good idea and none
[1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:40.800]  of them did oh I have actual cases where they try to set police up to do that to
[1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:45.640]  create lack of trust with local police that you're terrorist that actually
[1:57:45.640 --> 1:57:50.080]  happened in Phoenix last year that's exactly right I'm telling you we're not
[1:57:50.080 --> 1:57:55.200]  stupid guerrillas and people are understanding that the people in the
[1:57:55.200 --> 1:57:58.640]  federal government are not understanding that that's why they fear us they know

[2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:44.360]  process and I just want everybody to remember that we still have the 25th
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:50.520]  amendment to impeach the president if he appears insane and Coney 2012 was a
[2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:55.840]  sigh of good call on that and that's my take on that Alex and I appreciate the

[2:02:11.600 --> 2:02:17.200]  of all the donations were to Ron Paul but now it's just open fraud from every
[2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:20.760]  major state and it's just just incredible let's talk to airborne

[2:02:26.360 --> 2:02:32.440]  a lot of soldiers are waking up when I was in Afghanistan I'd see him spraying
[2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:37.600]  chemtrails every day and I'd always talk to my soldiers and say hey you know
[2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:41.800]  what they're doing right and I was called the crazy I was called you know
[2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:45.920]  lunatic and then as soon as we got back from deployment up here on station up
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:51.160]  Alaska I'd pointed out to them that right here they look going on right here a
[2:02:51.160 --> 2:02:55.200]  lot of them are waking up to what's going on and how they're spraying in all
[2:02:55.200 --> 2:03:02.440]  NATO countries we swore an oath to the Constitution the United States
[2:03:02.440 --> 2:03:08.520]  Constitution and not the United Nations so what people need to realize is a
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:14.400]  total takeover the United Nations is is directing our military now publicly
[2:03:14.400 --> 2:03:19.240]  publicly do they tell Congress and now Obama says I'll take over the entire
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:25.000]  economy without Congress I mean he's not announcing all this for nothing
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:33.080]  exactly and the Secretary of Defense Pina basically told our Congress to bow
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:38.160]  down to him in the UN that will go get permission from the United Nations and
[2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:42.200]  then we'll inform Congress what we're gonna do and I didn't even hear about
[2:03:42.200 --> 2:03:50.600]  that from any mainstream news media because they're all controlled now Hillary
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:55.880]  Clinton also what the UN did the small arms treaty where they basically they're
[2:03:55.880 --> 2:04:00.680]  saying that the real weapon of mass destruction now in their eyes is the
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:05.360]  small arm no they're saying look you know dear Hillary says we'll adopt your
[2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:09.840]  treaty total abolition of civilian ownership of firearms that's in the
[2:04:09.840 --> 2:04:16.200]  treaty the words total abolition of civilian ownership of small arms
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:21.000]  exactly and that's what they're gonna try to do if he gets reelected also look
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:25.120]  at Australia and England they're totally passed by now in Australia when they
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:30.000]  turn their guns in you know you see videos of them chopping up with the
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:35.040]  chop saw all the guns and all the the civilians down there saying you know

[2:08:31.280 --> 2:08:35.560]  news we haven't gotten to yet I'm gonna be bringing up those items with Dick
[2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:39.440]  Gregory who doesn't need any introduction an iconic civil rights
[2:08:39.440 --> 2:08:45.320]  activist of course comedian he was on the front line of the 60s during the civil
[2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:49.160]  rights era and has been fighting for freedom ever since then Gregory has been
[2:08:49.160 --> 2:08:55.040]  arrested for civil disobedience several times and has activism has him to run
[2:08:55.040 --> 2:09:01.720]  for mayor of Chicago in 66 and for president in 68 in the early 70s
[2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:05.640]  Gregory abandoned comedy to focus on his political interests which widened
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:09.960]  from race relations who includes us issues as violence world hunger capital
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:14.600]  punishment drug abuse poor health care he was recently arrested with George
[2:09:14.600 --> 2:09:19.280]  Clooney outside the Sudanese embassy so I respect Dick Gregory and know he's a
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:23.400]  really great guy who does care about freedom and has a lot of courage he's
[2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:27.680]  been on this show before he's talked about 9-11 you name it now I'm gonna be
[2:09:27.680 --> 2:09:33.560]  honest though Dick as for George Clooney I want to believe that he means well but
[2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:40.000]  the State Department people who are using him to push for a war in Sudan and
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:44.360]  other areas I don't see that just to preface this here so you know where I'm
[2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:51.640]  coming from I don't see that as the West wanting to go in there to actually stop
[2:09:51.640 --> 2:09:55.240]  some of the brutal leaders who who are abusing and killing Christians I've
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:09:59.560]  been talking about that for a decade here I see it as a pretext just like Iraq we
[2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:03.680]  just saw Libya that was a total pretext you know to go in there and take over and
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:07.880]  now there's ethnic cleansing of the black Libyans by some of the Arabs I mean
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:10.960]  it's definitely worse than it was I'm not saying Gaddafi was perfect but he was
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:14.880]  building up all of Africa and so when I see the State Department that supported
[2:10:14.880 --> 2:10:22.560]  that behind Darfur and you know Sudan and all of this it just I just find it
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:26.040]  suspicious now you're there getting arrested and I respect that so tell us
[2:10:26.040 --> 2:10:32.160]  out of the gates why you know you're supporting what's going on there
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:48.840]  let me just back up for a minute one of the most brutal brutal mentions in modern times mainly because of the fastness of the news and television was when James Byrd was lynched and
[2:10:48.840 --> 2:10:58.160]  dismantled by three white men in Texas and because of the fastness and the conscience
[2:10:58.160 --> 2:11:03.000]  of people they arrested the three whites that did it before they identified who the
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:08.480]  black man was one of them was sentenced to a long sentence the other two was
[2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:13.520]  sentenced to death I was against the death penalty I was there with a group of
[2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:18.600]  people when they killed the first one about four months ago in Huntsville
[2:11:18.600 --> 2:11:25.480]  Texas I stood outside of there with a prayer vigil and said you know killing
[2:11:25.480 --> 2:11:31.160]  by the state is wrong you give me life in jail and that's punishment when you
[2:11:31.160 --> 2:11:37.400]  give me death that's revenge and so I don't I don't draw the line or worry I
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:43.400]  don't never have to be validated by ignorance and the people who contacted
[2:11:43.400 --> 2:11:47.120]  me and didn't understand I don't do things according to your understand
[2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:53.080]  killing is wrong by the state I say that the presence why I went to jail the
[2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:59.200]  other day the rainy season is coming and there'll be like three six hundred
[2:11:59.200 --> 2:12:04.280]  thousand people that will starve to death that's what I was there for and I
[2:12:04.280 --> 2:12:09.720]  would be there for anybody starvation I was with Bobby Sands I went there when
[2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:15.560]  Bobby Sands was starving himself to death in the jail I go wherever there
[2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:20.560]  seemed to be injustices with women and children and talking about eating I'm
[2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:25.040]  adding today politics a whole lot of people can be in the politics and feel
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:31.960]  feed people I mean here in America they talking about about 30 million meals a
[2:12:31.960 --> 2:12:38.640]  day in schools and we got politicians here they say wait a minute ketchup is a
[2:12:38.640 --> 2:12:46.720]  vegetable pizza is good nutrition and french fries my act was if you go to
[2:12:46.720 --> 2:12:51.480]  visit your mother and father and your friends on Thanksgiving and they give
[2:12:51.480 --> 2:12:57.440]  you ketchup pizza and french fries you know how they feel about you and the
[2:12:57.440 --> 2:13:02.960]  fact that we would do that to children I believe Hitler would do it to Jews but
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:07.160]  I don't believe Hitler would have put that crap in the schools for Germans so
[2:13:07.160 --> 2:13:12.280]  when you look around at a filthy system that stuff have been going on over and
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:18.240]  over and over and over again I never thought I would see today that I could
[2:13:18.240 --> 2:13:22.360]  say I'd rather be killed by someone didn't kill someone that's what the
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:26.600]  civil rights movement did to me that's where it changed me John Wayne was my
[2:13:26.600 --> 2:13:30.760]  hero man I'm 80 years old we didn't have no television I was a little boy and
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:35.960]  John Wayne said if you're right and they wrong kill him and then what Dr. King
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:40.360]  came around said no no no no killing is not right it's about love and then I
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:46.920]  look at the outcome it is about love not love but can you be lovable and so so
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:53.320]  if someone had captured brutal brutal people and said they was gonna starve on
[2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:57.120]  the death I'd be on the front line that said no no no no this is this there's
[2:13:57.120 --> 2:14:01.840]  other ways of dealing out justice and starving people that that does not want
[2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:06.040]  to that's why I was there and that's why I was in jail well let me just be clear
[2:14:06.040 --> 2:14:10.840]  I only brought this up out of the gates because I had noticed that you'd been on
[2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:16.400]  the list of arrested people and I know that you always get behind causes that
[2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:22.960]  you believe are are good and just and and so I respect you and I had just been
[2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:29.840]  talking last week about Angelina Joe Lee who went to the border of Libya there
[2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:35.720]  in Tunisia last October and called over and over again for invasion and bombing
[2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:41.400]  and I know that that that that was about destabilizing Africa so I got very
[2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:46.280]  very angry with her the UN's constantly caught doing evil things I
[2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:49.520]  understand they talk about a bunch of good stuff they want to do and then good
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:52.720]  people like yourself and others give them money give them time give them
[2:14:52.720 --> 2:14:57.440]  energy and I saw George Clooney go up there and talk about how you know folks
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:03.080]  are flying over there in Sudan and then dropping bombs on the Christians and and
[2:15:03.080 --> 2:15:06.760]  I don't like that but then I think okay George well what about our government
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:11.160]  with drones and 14 countries dropping bombs and saying it's okay to kill 200
[2:15:11.160 --> 2:15:15.800]  people at a wedding as long as you kill one guy you claim was bad my whole point
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:20.160]  is when I see Fox News with George Clooney on and Fox is just saying yeah
[2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:24.160]  this is good let's go in there I'm like wait a minute all I know is this war
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:28.960]  machine that's run by these big foreign banks they'll use people's concern about
[2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:33.400]  something wrong that's going on but then actually double-cross everybody I mean
[2:15:33.400 --> 2:15:37.880]  take take Joseph Coney hadn't been seeing all these years and now we're
[2:15:37.880 --> 2:15:41.920]  hearing oh we got to go into there what about the leader of that country that's
[2:15:41.920 --> 2:15:46.400]  been connected all I'm saying is I've learned that when they tell me we got to
[2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:49.920]  attack this country because of WMD's or we got to go into Sudan because the
[2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:54.360]  Muslims are killing the Christians I know they are I don't like it but but at
[2:15:54.360 --> 2:15:57.360]  the same time I don't see our government wanting to go in there to
[2:15:57.360 --> 2:16:00.600]  actually help people it's always to get the natural resources I mean do you see
[2:16:00.600 --> 2:16:05.080]  what I'm saying I was just let me tell you something you know things that most
[2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:10.920]  folks don't know there's a whole lot of people that get involved emotional and
[2:16:10.920 --> 2:16:14.760]  humanitarian that they don't know the black I've been knowing Gaddafi been
[2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:19.560]  CIA since he was 15 years old my grandmother don't know that I'm one of
[2:16:19.560 --> 2:16:24.200]  the people believe if I'm stupid enough to believe Gaddafi is a dead haha please
[2:16:24.200 --> 2:16:29.360]  then my mother was Jesus okay but this is what you learn from research this is
[2:16:29.360 --> 2:16:33.640]  what you learn from put you know you make the show look easy but let me tell
[2:16:33.640 --> 2:16:37.680]  you something I bump into people that swear by you because they know when I
[2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:42.000]  when I take it from here I don't have to worry about the New York Times in the
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:47.040]  Washington Post but you worked hard to do that you worked hard to check and
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:50.960]  recheck there's a whole lot of people that don't know my mother if she was alive
[2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:56.720]  today she didn't know King James or another Bible she died for that she
[2:16:56.720 --> 2:17:00.520]  didn't know King James was King of England she didn't know King James was
[2:17:00.520 --> 2:17:05.360]  such a weird strange homosexual he hated women so bad he killed his mother and
[2:17:05.360 --> 2:17:09.520]  his lover was Lord Buckingham who Buckingham Dallas is named after she
[2:17:09.520 --> 2:17:14.960]  didn't know that if my mother walked in your studio the day you think God spit
[2:17:14.960 --> 2:17:18.680]  her out that's how precious and kind and sweet but if you try to convince my
[2:17:18.680 --> 2:17:22.560]  mother that Jesus Christ wasn't a person she had stomped you to death but she
[2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:26.640]  didn't know Christianity never happened till a hundred years after Jesus was
[2:17:26.640 --> 2:17:30.920]  dead so you have a whole lot of people out here that don't have proper
[2:17:30.920 --> 2:17:36.840]  information including my mother if he was alive and so somewhere when you sit
[2:17:36.840 --> 2:17:41.680]  and look at those of us that have the information in a few weeks we'd be
[2:17:41.680 --> 2:17:48.040]  celebrating the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King on April 4th now you
[2:17:48.040 --> 2:17:52.480]  know this but there's a whole lot of people it's not aware when you see
[2:17:52.480 --> 2:17:57.360]  that famous picture King's land on the ground and all of these people's
[2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:03.880]  pointing up now come on now if a shot is fired and I'm on a balcony we all
[2:18:03.880 --> 2:18:08.440]  gonna hit the ground now nobody's gonna get how they know it wasn't gonna be a
[2:18:08.440 --> 2:18:13.040]  second shot in his Dr. King land on the ground and nobody was saying are you
[2:18:13.040 --> 2:18:18.360]  alright what was told but we see this and we've been out there dealing with it
[2:18:18.360 --> 2:18:25.400]  for years I'm the one that released the picture with Ron Brown the secretary
[2:18:25.400 --> 2:18:29.240]  of commerce with the bullet in the back his head and they couldn't deny it
[2:18:29.240 --> 2:18:36.000]  because the day the ones brought the picture to me so they couldn't deny it
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:40.160]  but you think the New York Times Washington Post was running not until I
[2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:45.880]  went to jail not till I went to jail on Christmas Eve did that story run well
[2:18:45.880 --> 2:18:48.920]  you know we should talk about that absolutely I just raised the whole
[2:18:48.920 --> 2:18:54.360]  point so so you so you think George Clooney really means well then wait
[2:18:54.360 --> 2:18:58.480]  wait wait wait I'm not getting into that that's like somebody asking me
[2:18:58.480 --> 2:19:02.240]  somebody do you think the gravy mean well when he's standing there with this
[2:19:02.240 --> 2:19:06.480]  this white transplant that fixer get the lecture here I'm not getting into that
[2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:10.820]  the only reason I ask you is I was getting ready to do a whole video on
[2:19:10.820 --> 2:19:14.760]  George Clooney and I'm really trying to find out whether I should go after him
[2:19:14.760 --> 2:19:18.000]  or not not for even getting arrested there but for pushing for military
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:22.320]  intervention I do think we should help the people of southern Sudan it's just
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:25.800]  that I just don't see it's like the death penalty we're going to break but I
[2:19:25.800 --> 2:19:28.440]  want to come back and talk about this with you and get into Ron Brown get
[2:19:28.440 --> 2:19:33.640]  into MLK RFK JFK whatever you want to get into because you know you're so
[2:19:33.640 --> 2:19:40.080]  well informed on it all I'm trying to say is that it's like the death penalty
[2:19:40.080 --> 2:19:45.040]  I believe somebody that murders a child some serial killer I want them to die
[2:19:45.040 --> 2:19:49.000]  but I can't trust this corrupt government to carry out the execution
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:52.600]  because that's an even greater danger did Gregory's our guest we'll be right
[2:19:52.600 --> 2:19:56.520]  back with him on the other side of this quick break
[2:19:56.520 --> 2:20:04.720]  I'd seen the ungevity products work for many others and so I bought a bunch of
[2:20:04.720 --> 2:20:08.520]  them started using them had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the
[2:20:08.520 --> 2:20:13.680]  regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds
[2:20:13.680 --> 2:20:18.360]  when I saw those results I said I better follow my own advice I started taking
[2:20:18.360 --> 2:20:23.840]  the ungevity products and it's been incredible 37 pounds in two months our
[2:20:23.840 --> 2:20:28.520]  bodies are amazing and God gave us an incredible gift but if our body doesn't
[2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:32.240]  have the tools it needs all of the vitamins all of the minerals and the
[2:20:32.240 --> 2:20:36.600]  other key essential trace elements we're not gonna be healthy folks this

[2:21:08.240 --> 2:21:12.600]  recovery or will it be a W shaped one where the nation slips back into

[2:24:17.200 --> 2:24:22.000]  he was part of wounded knee while they were shooting the place up from when I
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:26.600]  was reading thousands of rounds ammo poured in there he went in there to be
[2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:31.080]  peacefully stand with those that were under attack I mean he's been everywhere
[2:24:31.080 --> 2:24:35.040]  and done everything they've got that Johnny Cash song I've been everywhere man
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:39.400]  we got interrupted by the break moving away from Clooney and Darfur and Sudan
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:44.400]  and you know that whole nightmare situation over there expanding on what
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:48.480]  you're trying to talk about with the Commerce Secretary I remember and it was
[2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:52.360]  you that forced it out because the coroners had leaked it he'd been shot
[2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:57.400]  in the head and of course then they guided the plane in and yeah but tell
[2:24:57.400 --> 2:25:00.440]  folks about that story I mean because there's so many other things you've
[2:25:00.440 --> 2:25:03.880]  witnessed and then I want to ask you about President Obama is one of the
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:09.760]  things that when when the coroner brought it to me well I was really
[2:25:09.760 --> 2:25:18.440]  touched and here's the reason why it was seven folks one woman might be two women five
[2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:27.680]  males one of the the males was up to to move and to be in a general after that
[2:25:27.680 --> 2:25:34.280]  all of that stopped at seven white folks came to me about a black man who had
[2:25:34.280 --> 2:25:40.360]  been murdered and there was no plane right and I had to ask myself if you
[2:25:40.360 --> 2:25:48.720]  did great was ready to be elevated to a general in the United States military and
[2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:55.040]  no God knows how far you could go if a white guy had a bullet in the back of
[2:25:55.040 --> 2:26:02.280]  his head you know would you get involved would you get involved with it at the
[2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:10.080]  expense of your family they did man this is my life had moved me in the
[2:26:10.080 --> 2:26:16.200]  situation where I've been able to see things and then I have to question God
[2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:22.080]  man how do these well I would probably the other day in jail I'm thinking that's
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:27.760]  the first time he's ever been to jail now his program while we were there was
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:32.840]  talking about we got a short window we had a meeting in the jail and I said
[2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:38.880]  man a bell didn't ring inside of me if you've got extra amount of weeks before
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:46.440]  these people I said look let me take I'm gonna eat nothing but liquids until
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:49.920]  they move that blockade I'm interested in the war that's that's that I'm
[2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:55.760]  interested in all wars right now look if I fall out the 18th floor winter and I've
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:27:01.120]  come to your hospital and your doctors and teens all around and I got a broken
[2:27:01.120 --> 2:27:07.320]  ankle of practice skull I've got crack ribs I've got all kinds of stuff and my
[2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:12.960]  heart stops huh everybody got to stop doing what they're doing to work on my
[2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:16.600]  heart that's why I look at this problem over there I know what this country is
[2:27:16.600 --> 2:27:21.360]  doing I know the most black folks think white supremacists the blue club plan
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:27.120]  don't determine public policy most white folks don't even understand what
[2:27:27.120 --> 2:27:32.320]  white supremacy is that's why when all these folks say I saw UFOs we were
[2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:36.880]  shooting at them I'm the airport ain't nobody admitted why because once you
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:41.160]  admit that white supremacy goes out the window organized religion go out the
[2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:45.280]  window and then we've become earthlings we would be earth people and there's
[2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:50.120]  nothing in my grandma's head that could commit her to believe there could be a
[2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:58.640]  Baptist on Mars so when you spit and look at where this is going and how much
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:04.520]  information is out here that's been tricked and and and and and twist it and
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:09.160]  all of that let me tell you I know stuff about that Kennedy shooting and if you
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:14.080]  ever hear me read anything I say I'm one of the few people that don't say when
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:19.200]  he was assassinated but there's certain things you don't say because you would
[2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:25.000]  discredit yourself I see horror stories out here when I was in and I was in
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:31.680]  New York on September the 10th and the 11th because the head of the ACLU for
[2:28:31.680 --> 2:28:37.600]  20 years had been fighting police brutality cases and and now he's running
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:47.480]  for public something I think of in a minute and so so a woman called me a
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:52.800]  black woman and she said look this white brother here in the last 20 years have
[2:28:52.800 --> 2:28:59.440]  caused the New York City about five four to five billion dollars winning and
[2:28:59.440 --> 2:29:06.160]  selling police brutality cases and he's running for a public advocate and what
[2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:11.960]  would it cost to you to come in and campaign for him and said I'm the one
[2:29:11.960 --> 2:29:17.360]  that wanted and I said no I know him I'll do it for free and here's the
[2:29:17.360 --> 2:29:26.000]  conditions on the 10th 01 I come in we hold a press conference and on the 11th
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:30.800]  give me a team to go into the black community and tell black folks who this

[2:33:32.400 --> 2:33:35.560]  and you know his view of the world love him or hate him you've got to admit the
[2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:39.280]  guy's consistent and certainly an open mind and a great comedian in his own
[2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:44.680]  right and he's a living history book he's seen so much mr. Gregory you were
[2:33:44.680 --> 2:33:48.600]  getting into the fact that a friend called because you're asking hey where am I
[2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:52.920]  sleeping in New York if folks just joined us in your own words recap that
[2:33:52.920 --> 2:33:57.760]  and continue well I'll call my wife at the night of the 10th and I said hey
[2:33:57.760 --> 2:34:02.040]  there were you got me sleeping tonight she has all my hotel trainer did you
[2:34:02.040 --> 2:34:07.880]  not your friend called me told me the day he said don't tell you don't spend
[2:34:07.880 --> 2:34:13.800]  the night in New York tonight so I trust him I know who he is I know what
[2:34:13.800 --> 2:34:20.080]  level of consciousness so I go to the train station and get me a train out
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:25.560]  coming to Washington DC and midnight I get here for the morning and I can't
[2:34:25.560 --> 2:34:29.600]  wait to get off the plane to train to call this friend of mine so I called him
[2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:34.040]  and nothing can stay on the phone I said how'd you know I was in New York he
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:41.240]  said we picked you up on the satellite brother so I don't know what what was
[2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:45.880]  gonna happen many of us been knowing about blowing up the world trade deal
[2:34:45.880 --> 2:34:48.800]  and I didn't know the date there were some people that knew that I didn't know
[2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:53.040]  the date it's called Operation Binkhole that's how long we knew about it when
[2:34:53.040 --> 2:34:57.360]  we busted some folks in the Philippines and found it in they hard drive so all
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:35:01.640]  this stuff that that that that that that's the game that they play yeah
[2:35:01.640 --> 2:35:08.640]  but Jacob yeah and so so consequently I I go home and I call some folks my
[2:35:08.640 --> 2:35:14.280]  apartment I wouldn't plan on being here in DC and in DC we walk every morning
[2:35:14.280 --> 2:35:19.840]  at like five o'clock so I said so sit back an hour and I'll meet you in the
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:24.080]  park and so when I get back home my wife and one of my children that called me
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:29.160]  and told me playing that hit the world he's building I'm thinking like a pot
[2:35:29.160 --> 2:35:33.680]  one in Piper Cove like we throw in King Kong right and so while I'm getting
[2:35:33.680 --> 2:35:40.520]  dressed to meet them for a talk about a demonstration at the Capitol I see the
[2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:49.080]  other plane hit the building oh so now I call my friend who hit me off and I
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:55.600]  said wow and all he said is you owe me one you don't talk on the phone right and
[2:35:55.600 --> 2:36:02.080]  so now I start watching everything now I shut down called Leo if it I'm out of
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:06.160]  circulation I'll call a couple researchers and put on every TV you got
[2:36:06.160 --> 2:36:10.440]  in your house and watch it watch it watch it watch it and then so all it was now
[2:36:10.440 --> 2:36:15.520]  the second plane that the second plane here I'm gonna ask you a question those
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:23.560]  you that's listening if you work for NBC your CBS the ABC and you was the one
[2:36:23.560 --> 2:36:29.200]  that captured that picture of that second building being hit you have a Nobel
[2:36:29.200 --> 2:36:36.120]  you have a pull a surprise you make $40,000 a speech and your name would
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:40.960]  be world-renowned how come we don't know the person that took that picture it
[2:36:40.960 --> 2:36:46.920]  is simple deduction how come we don't know the person it took that picture now
[2:36:46.920 --> 2:36:51.760]  I'm looking and I know what to look for I know when when the stuff hit you
[2:36:51.760 --> 2:36:55.960]  dealing with people's emotions you can put all kind of stuff down then you get
[2:36:55.960 --> 2:37:02.320]  the Pentagon okay it got hit right well now let's look the Pentagon that plane
[2:37:02.320 --> 2:37:06.800]  came in six feet off the ground how you gonna have a plane doing six feet of a
[2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:11.520]  ground doing 450 miles an hour that's impossible you can't do that but let's
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:16.440]  say it did now if you know what a Pentagon is and you you move out from the
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:20.320]  Pentagon you got the highway and you keep moving you got Arlington Cemetery
[2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:25.600]  and all the four planes that hit the Pentagon six feet off the ground it had
[2:37:25.600 --> 2:37:30.400]  to come to Arlington Cemetery there's not one tree a lamppost knocked down in
[2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:35.040]  Arlington Cemetery now one of the tricks they'll do is right after something
[2:37:35.040 --> 2:37:39.480]  happened you got a cab driver said you know I saw it come in and I was scared
[2:37:39.480 --> 2:37:42.820]  you don't know if that's an agent or not you don't know who that is they've
[2:37:42.820 --> 2:37:46.000]  already got people playing or what they're gonna say you think they just
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:52.040]  and one of the things that's gonna bring this country down to its knees it's a
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:55.680]  handful of cops I'm not talking about these ones we see in the street that
[2:37:55.680 --> 2:38:01.160]  know that homicides when they call it suicide and all that they know it and
[2:38:01.160 --> 2:38:06.000]  the news media knows it I'm not talking about these reporters I'm talking about
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:10.080]  the news media that put the tricks down and and feel this out and say so-and-so
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:14.360]  saw this they don't want their names and so when you sit and you look at that
[2:38:14.360 --> 2:38:20.520]  whole Pentagon now here's another thing there was five building zero to be hit
[2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:27.480]  five places the World Trade Building the White House the Pentagon the Sears
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:32.400]  Tower and the big bank out there in San Francisco it's something that's
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:42.200]  interesting now if nobody knew this then why is it that nobody evacuated Baltimore
[2:38:42.200 --> 2:38:46.000]  I mean you don't get the Pentagon and supposed to get to the White House and
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:52.440]  all the government activity that go on in Baltimore and all the way up to 95th
[2:38:52.440 --> 2:38:59.280]  quarter you got you got the space headquarters and all of that nobody
[2:38:59.280 --> 2:39:04.560]  evacuated that nobody evacuated Pennsylvania Philadelphia how'd you know
[2:39:04.560 --> 2:39:09.360]  I mean how did you know it was just gonna be those and then when you go back
[2:39:09.360 --> 2:39:15.440]  into Chicago they evacuated the Sears Tower we knew that was on one of the
[2:39:15.440 --> 2:39:21.640]  zero right down the street is big and it all building with just a couple of
[2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:26.600]  stories shorter than how come nobody evacuated that because they knew what the
[2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:32.080]  targets were they knew what the targets were and so I'm saying when you sit and
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:37.400]  you're my poor mother-in-law if they was alive they'd be duped into it too and so
[2:39:37.400 --> 2:39:44.600]  when you have that kind of hard core now for those you only listen let me tell
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:51.840]  you what you need to do on September the 11 now in America we don't list state
[2:39:51.840 --> 2:39:58.480]  by the number of the month we say September Halloween October 31st why
[2:39:58.480 --> 2:40:03.360]  they use a number for that one because it's 9-1-1 and anytime you don't say
[2:40:03.360 --> 2:40:08.000]  September the 11th and you say 9-1-1 it can you tell the brain to be scared
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:12.360]  okay that's right for instance if any of you all listen walked into your house
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:16.680]  this evening and someone was on the phone your mother your father your wife
[2:40:16.680 --> 2:40:21.200]  the children and you said we're talking to that just about 9-1-1 what kind of
[2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:26.320]  look comes over your face listen when I see 9-1-1 on a clock now I see as an
[2:40:26.320 --> 2:40:30.880]  ill um and they did it as a they even picked a number to program everybody the
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:35.440]  passports magically survived hijackers trained at US bases but I got to go back
[2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:39.800]  here because I hadn't heard you talking this much detail about what you just
[2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:44.920]  discussed dick Gregory a civil rights icon as our guest we just tuned in but
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:51.760]  there is something of what you speak on record mayor Willie Brown he admitted
[2:40:51.760 --> 2:40:58.560]  that he got warned all right that's what I was getting ready to tell your
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:11.360]  listeners pull up the San Francisco Chronicle on September the 12th the next
[2:41:11.360 --> 2:41:19.720]  day and that's where they had a front page story where Willie Brown had been
[2:41:19.720 --> 2:41:31.440]  told his bodyguard not to take his flight into New York City that Tuesday
[2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:38.000]  hmm now I don't have no problem with that I've got a problem with this when a
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:44.120]  rep to hold newspaper as far as newspapers are concerned not one of the
[2:41:44.120 --> 2:41:48.680]  newspaper ran that story huh it's flipped through that he was told don't fly
[2:41:48.680 --> 2:41:53.200]  September 10th on September 11th and the reported person that told the bodyguards
[2:41:53.200 --> 2:42:00.000]  that made the call was Condoleezza right hey we all knew that huh wow right there
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:03.520]  don't fly to New York but they didn't know anything about the attacks but no
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:09.720]  no that don't bother me what bothers me is who told the New York Times they print
[2:42:09.720 --> 2:42:16.320]  stories out of paper I've got a man for Tim walk up there it if if the San
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:22.760]  Francisco Chronicle report a pimp shot five prostitutes to death and beat
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:28.600]  their mothers to death that story was run all over the world oh yes now how come
[2:42:28.600 --> 2:42:37.080]  not one newspaper ran that story okay now go back to that Friday which was
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:46.760]  Tuesday was the 11 12 13 14 15 the Friday San Francisco Chronicle the ex
[2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:53.680]  secretary state George Heldt said he knew seven days before that's right front
[2:42:53.680 --> 2:42:59.240]  page story okay so we're not talking about a mayor the one we talking about
[2:42:59.240 --> 2:43:06.840]  the ex secretary of state and as you know dick he's a major kingmaker you know
[2:43:06.840 --> 2:43:12.080]  at some levels some believe you even higher up than even Kissinger that
[2:43:12.080 --> 2:43:15.160]  actually call in the shots I mean he's a guy knows where all the bodies are
[2:43:15.160 --> 2:43:19.160]  buried and then there was also what an Associated Press blurb that the joint
[2:43:19.160 --> 2:43:24.320]  chiefs of staff canceled flights to New York on for September 11th I mean so they
[2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:30.400]  all knew and these are real articles Colonel Stephen Butler was told he said
[2:43:30.400 --> 2:43:34.560]  that they trained some of the people on the hijacker list at their base he said
[2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:41.360]  the government was behind it and they started the move to court martial him
[2:43:41.360 --> 2:43:47.040]  until he shut up sure so we'd be crazy 9-11 the government was absolutely
[2:43:47.040 --> 2:43:51.040]  conscious and let it happen bare minimum well you know here's what they'll do
[2:43:51.040 --> 2:43:56.680]  they'll come out 50 years from now and admit certain things and then people
[2:43:56.680 --> 2:44:01.920]  overlooked it and this and that but not let me show you something else I had a
[2:44:01.920 --> 2:44:08.120]  friend of mine I said do me a favor I want you to look at all the flights on a
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:13.880]  five-day period Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday look at it for two years
[2:44:13.880 --> 2:44:18.600]  all your major flights coming out of Hartford Connecticut going to the West
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:23.480]  Coast coming out of Boston Airport going to the West Coast coming out of
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:28.280]  Kennedy going to the West Coast coming out of Philadelphia direct non-stop
[2:44:28.280 --> 2:44:32.760]  flight coming out of Washington DC dollars going to the West Coast and
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:37.920]  here's what we found out we found out that on a Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[2:44:37.920 --> 2:44:43.160]  Friday that if you wanted to book a first class from any of those airports
[2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:47.360]  going to the West Coast because you gain three hours you gain a whole business
[2:44:47.360 --> 2:44:54.520]  date you have to book about a month in advance to get first class about three
[2:44:54.520 --> 2:45:00.760]  days in advance to get a seat on coach that's everyone is in flight that day
[2:45:00.760 --> 2:45:10.760]  all of those flights from from Boston going to San Francisco going to LA
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:19.960]  Philly Airport from Kennedy from Washington DC all of those flights was
[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:26.840]  about 34% full yes okay so I'm saying when you fit they all got tipped off
[2:45:26.840 --> 2:45:30.040]  that's why there were kids locally saying those towers won't be there next
[2:45:30.040 --> 2:45:37.000]  week yeah I mean this was everywhere and then there was that weird base in it was
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:42.640]  up in Nebraska where hundreds of CEOs had been told come to a special meeting a
[2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:46.520]  week before and then they closed the hangar and showed them some video and
[2:45:46.520 --> 2:45:50.280]  they all came out freaked out and Warren Buffett was running it I mean you're
[2:45:50.280 --> 2:45:54.320]  talking about weirdness well I'm very seldom somebody would tell you something
[2:45:54.320 --> 2:45:58.320]  that you don't know but if you don't know this look in this and tell you both
[2:45:58.320 --> 2:46:04.480]  those those little training where those those apps were supposed to have gone
[2:46:04.480 --> 2:46:09.480]  taking a train in the Florida yes those schools is owned by Warren Buffett did
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:13.600]  you hear me no I didn't all right I mean I heard you I didn't know that okay
[2:46:13.600 --> 2:46:18.480]  that was owned by Warren Buffett right now let me just tell you something very
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:29.560]  interesting do you remember Martha Mitchell yes he was kidnapped right yes
[2:46:29.560 --> 2:46:34.920]  and then a week later she died from some kind of strange cancer right yes now
[2:46:34.920 --> 2:46:42.160]  anytime you can kidnap the attorney general's wife of the United States when
[2:46:42.160 --> 2:46:45.120]  you become the attorney general of the United States you the number one cop in
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:50.320]  the world cuz America is the number one mightiest power on the planet okay now
[2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:54.160]  when you can kidnap the attorney general's wife of the United States and
[2:46:54.160 --> 2:47:00.640]  as we talk right now brother nobody's ever been arrested for that kidnap did
[2:47:00.640 --> 2:47:07.360]  you hear him no you're right okay now why was she kidnapped it cuz she heard her
[2:47:07.360 --> 2:47:12.680]  husband and a bunch of the old white boys sitting around in their living room
[2:47:12.680 --> 2:47:17.560]  with their cognac talking about when the World Trade Bill was going to be
[2:47:17.560 --> 2:47:24.040]  blowed up she was outraged she you know she wasn't in the room this was the
[2:47:24.040 --> 2:47:29.800]  white boy meeting and she got on him and said well I'm gonna tell the world on
[2:47:29.800 --> 2:47:35.480]  Monday I hold a press conference she was kidnapped man shot her in the butt
[2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:40.600]  with a cancer shot and she died and we keep paying our rent and we keep doing
[2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:44.120]  this and looking at all this old crazy kind of stuff and don't know what's
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:49.880]  really going on and so consequently when you sit and look now while I was
[2:47:49.880 --> 2:47:55.440]  watching this if people start getting tired and they start making mistakes
[2:47:55.440 --> 2:48:05.880]  don't ask you a question now if that that building has oh fifty thousand people who work there in the
[2:48:05.880 --> 2:48:14.680]  World Trade and by evening there's over 120,000 people in the bill people coming
[2:48:14.680 --> 2:48:19.360]  there for business coming but yes but the view and all that now around the
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:25.600]  corner a block and a half around the corner is five station seven something
[2:48:25.600 --> 2:48:34.400]  like that they go there every day year round a minimum of 50 times maximum of
[2:48:34.400 --> 2:48:42.000]  75 why because if your smoke detects the blowout you can get a fuse and put in it
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:46.760]  but because of the insurance on the building like that the amount of people
[2:48:46.760 --> 2:48:50.360]  that's in there you can't do that you have to call the fire department and
[2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:55.960]  they'll send someone there you get a bill for it to put that fuse in and then
[2:48:55.960 --> 2:49:00.840]  clear that it's working okay so I'm a status again that fire station the
[2:49:00.840 --> 2:49:07.640]  block in the hair company go there a minimum of 50 times every day a maximum
[2:49:07.640 --> 2:49:15.560]  of 75 on September the 11th there was 343 five fighters killed that's not
[2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:18.720]  counting the ones that was injured that's not counting the cops just
[2:49:18.720 --> 2:49:24.960]  far fight not one five fighter was killed and injured from number seven of
[2:49:24.960 --> 2:49:30.440]  blocking our air okay a block in our air from the World Trade Building not one
[2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:35.400]  of those five fighters was injured or killed if somebody knows something I
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:40.920]  mean five fighters came from all over the city and many of them died it was
[2:49:40.920 --> 2:49:47.280]  injured right around the corner nothing and so when you sit and you think about
[2:49:47.280 --> 2:49:52.920]  you know how it worked and how maybe so I'm watching it I'm looking at it because
[2:49:52.920 --> 2:49:57.120]  I know what they do I'm looking at it and I'm looking at it and then the story
[2:49:57.120 --> 2:50:02.920]  getting tired and then I heard CNN interviewer guy and he says uh where
[2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:09.160]  would you when this was a day later well I was uh I'm uh I'm going to school to
[2:50:09.160 --> 2:50:14.680]  be a first responder and uh I got about six months and and then I heard this
[2:50:14.680 --> 2:50:20.640]  awful noise and I start running towards it and I open up this door and I go in
[2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:28.840]  there and there's about a hundred FBI and Homeland Security people there there
[2:50:28.840 --> 2:50:35.280]  what do you mean that I wonder how they got there that quick two days later they
[2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:39.200]  was interviewing one the guy from Homeland Security and I guess he was
[2:50:39.200 --> 2:50:43.200]  just tired to give we sent a team in here two days before it happened so we
[2:50:43.200 --> 2:50:47.040]  could be in place yeah that was Kennedy and then he said I was a mistake and
[2:50:47.040 --> 2:50:50.880]  later it was confirmed the whole drill that was used to cover up wiring the
[2:50:50.880 --> 2:50:55.840]  buildings was called tripod to and they'd already moved out of all the
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:51:00.240]  buildings their own offices to run the drill from the end of the pier blowing
[2:51:00.240 --> 2:51:04.760]  it all up a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research in
[2:51:04.760 --> 2:51:08.720]  to why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my
[2:51:08.720 --> 2:51:13.040]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[2:51:13.040 --> 2:51:16.400]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[2:51:16.400 --> 2:51:21.000]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:25.600]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[2:51:25.600 --> 2:51:30.320]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[2:54:16.880 --> 2:54:23.320]  time and I was all this news I wanted to go over with with Dick Gregory but the
[2:54:23.320 --> 2:54:26.960]  time has gone so fast and I promise you it won't be two years till the next time
[2:54:26.960 --> 2:54:31.280]  he's back on in fact I hope to get him on regularly because he's such an
[2:54:31.280 --> 2:54:34.840]  interesting person I've got to bring it up or folks will get mad because we've
[2:54:34.840 --> 2:54:38.120]  had the phone lines filling up saying asking about Obama what do you think
[2:54:38.120 --> 2:54:42.720]  about Obama what is your view and I understand at the end of the day I see
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:47.640]  it as positive that you know America could elect a black president just
[2:54:47.640 --> 2:54:51.320]  because it shows some unity but I see the system is doing it as a way to
[2:54:51.320 --> 2:54:56.280]  actually drive wedges in the final equation and he's he's signing in
[2:54:56.280 --> 2:55:03.000]  martial law provisions in DAA all of this is happening and he's he's able to
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:08.760]  do things Bush could never get away with because of the left cover in the final
[2:55:08.760 --> 2:55:13.560]  equation what do you think's going on with Barack Obama Dick Gregory well I
[2:55:13.560 --> 2:55:19.200]  put it this way I was one of the ones that was thrilled while he got elected I
[2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:23.640]  just said wow it's gonna run so many people crazy and we saw that happen on
[2:55:23.640 --> 2:55:27.800]  a on a inauguration day when you have one of the most powerful men in the
[2:55:27.800 --> 2:55:33.560]  world the Supreme Court the Chief Justice he only got to do is read two
[2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:39.800]  sentences and looked up and saw that blackface and messed up nobody we jump
[2:55:39.800 --> 2:55:43.960]  on a redneck for doing something but when somebody with his power do it we
[2:55:43.960 --> 2:55:48.680]  kind of eat no words and say bye bye bye and so I'm so glad because it might
[2:55:48.680 --> 2:55:53.880]  with all of the other stuff I mean and I'm living in a country where they're
[2:55:53.880 --> 2:55:58.920]  telling me it is easier for a black person to be elected president than to
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:03.040]  be a senator are you telling me I got a black president I don't have a black
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:09.960]  senator so it's a whole lot of stuff hooked around that I was hoping that
[2:56:09.960 --> 2:56:15.320]  Herman Cain would have won the nomination for the Republicans and then
[2:56:15.320 --> 2:56:21.240]  America would have two black men to pick from one that they say is a genius and
[2:56:21.240 --> 2:56:26.400]  the other one they made him come off looking like but weak but let me tell
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:29.160]  you something about Herman Cain I've been telling people for two years watch
[2:56:29.160 --> 2:56:33.960]  your black man named Herman Cain on the brilliant minds on the planet and people
[2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:37.120]  laugh when they saw the script they wrote for him but let me tell you who's
[2:56:37.120 --> 2:56:42.440]  doing Herman Cain is Herman Cain was chairman of the Kansas City Federal
[2:56:42.440 --> 2:56:47.480]  Reserve I know you knew that right yes did you know that I was the 12th Federal
[2:56:47.480 --> 2:56:53.240]  Reserve in America's Kansas City was the first one did you know that yes and I
[2:56:53.240 --> 2:56:57.840]  also know it's very very powerful they did also when you go to the and see the
[2:56:57.840 --> 2:57:02.520]  movie or the play the Wizard of Oz do you know Oz do you know that's about the
[2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:06.200]  Kansas City Federal Reserve yes sir I did know that that's how vicious they
[2:57:06.200 --> 2:57:11.080]  were the wicked wicked and so we got to ask you that well who is Herman Cain and
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:17.200]  so when I sit and I look at what's going on and what's happening but my
[2:57:17.200 --> 2:57:23.880]  grandmother you understand see what what what what I have to be careful of is the
[2:57:23.880 --> 2:57:27.720]  way people treat celebrities there's a whole lot of celebrities you had a white
[2:57:27.720 --> 2:57:34.280]  boy that that left his wife in the car or rather and went back in to get his gun
[2:57:34.280 --> 2:57:39.400]  and came back and she was dead and nobody's asked him why you why you
[2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:43.960]  why you carry the gun what you took it in the restaurant did you check it or
[2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:47.160]  did you take it is it normal to go in the restaurant eat take your gun set in a
[2:57:47.160 --> 2:57:54.520]  chair celebrity status and when you look at Obama he's a celebrity to a lot of
[2:57:54.520 --> 2:57:59.560]  young folks and to a lot of black folks and they left celebrities that you
[2:57:59.560 --> 2:58:03.760]  don't have to ask many things look at look at the Tiger Woods he was a
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:08.520]  celebrity to black folk that a white racist sexist system I live in a
[2:58:08.520 --> 2:58:13.440]  country where white boys all they had to do was call a white woman a witch and
[2:58:13.440 --> 2:58:18.040]  they could burn her at the state and we have never washed this field also when
[2:58:18.040 --> 2:58:23.240]  you get somebody come down the line that that looks to look and talks to talk
[2:58:23.240 --> 2:58:28.800]  and as a celebrity I as a black person I know a whole lot of stuff about a whole
[2:58:28.800 --> 2:58:32.600]  lot of people I wouldn't dare fail on this radio show or no other radio show
[2:58:32.600 --> 2:58:37.360]  I bet you know what five more minutes overdrive this is amazing back in 60

[3:00:31.760 --> 3:00:34.920]  interesting perspectives on things we were just talking during the break and
[3:00:34.920 --> 3:00:38.920]  you were going off into Obama please repeat what you were saying sir I was
[3:00:38.920 --> 3:00:45.080]  saying you know I knew many years before he was elected we getting ready for a
[3:00:45.080 --> 3:00:50.120]  black president and you got four movies come out of Hollywood showing black
[3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:54.560]  men as president they weren't comedy and the number one TV show in the land was
[3:00:54.560 --> 3:00:59.720]  24 a black president fascinated by the Secretary of State so he really better
[3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:08.040]  keep his eye on Hillary oh yeah Hillary super bad news so I mean you've had a
[3:01:08.040 --> 3:01:12.200]  chance to meet President Obama no I never look if I was invited to the White
[3:01:12.200 --> 3:01:17.200]  House today I wouldn't go because when you take all the things that I've said
[3:01:17.200 --> 3:01:21.440]  they go on in this country and they would say well let me tell you about the
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:26.000]  great here's what he said I don't know he got his own problem about let me ask
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:29.840]  you this though if you were standing before Barack Obama because I know a
[3:01:29.840 --> 3:01:32.640]  lot of these presidents are just reading off teleprompers but he's obviously a
[3:01:32.640 --> 3:01:36.720]  very smart guy but he's following orders I mean if I was in front of Obama I'd
[3:01:36.720 --> 3:01:40.800]  say I understand that your your blackmailed all these things but you
[3:01:40.800 --> 3:01:45.400]  should really back up you know back off all this corruption I mean what would you
[3:01:45.400 --> 3:01:50.120]  say to Obama if you had two minutes to talk to him I had two minutes to talk
[3:01:50.120 --> 3:01:54.680]  to him I say one I'm so glad you were spreading the United States because I
[3:01:54.680 --> 3:01:59.160]  have to apologize to all white folks because before you became president I
[3:01:59.160 --> 3:02:03.480]  was convinced that all black folks look alike to white folks now that you the
[3:02:03.480 --> 3:02:06.840]  president I haven't had one white person walk up to me and say excuse me mr.
[3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:11.320]  president I know we don't all look alike the other thing I'd ask him I said that
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:17.040]  I'm having financial problem would you be my co-signer okay talk to the people
[3:02:17.040 --> 3:02:20.360]  in China see if they would you know to let me a little long like they slip
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:26.200]  y'all that's all I'd say to him he don't have no control over what's going on no
[3:02:26.200 --> 3:02:30.200]  president that's good so you know that they don't have no control over what's
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:33.760]  going on when Kennedy thought they had control they had a bullet waiting for
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:37.640]  when Bobby thought I'm gonna get in and find out they had a bullet waiting for
[3:02:37.640 --> 3:02:41.160]  him let me take you this story real quick I'm doing herb cups in the chill
[3:02:41.160 --> 3:02:48.920]  in Chicago the first day of June and no no no it was the last to make and me and
[3:02:48.920 --> 3:02:53.200]  Bobby was close friends and Bobby said to me during the commercial that when

[3:03:43.200 --> 3:03:46.280]  I've got to get you back on the show soon just to talk about the history you
[3:03:46.280 --> 3:03:51.680]  witnessed so the FBI wanted the tape of that radio broadcast where you were able
[3:03:51.680 --> 3:03:55.400]  to predict that they were gonna kill him so I can tell you but I can never show
[3:03:55.400 --> 3:04:01.700]  you the piece of tape right Wow that's that's the whole game
[3:04:01.700 --> 3:04:06.280]  but who would thought he was in charge they killed who but they found who was

[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:15.440]  whole Ram fact his whole thing he thought he had some power and he didn't
[3:04:15.440 --> 3:04:20.000]  realize there's a group bigger than him there's a group bigger than Queen Elizabeth
[3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:25.120]  I don't have to tell you you know you know London is not part of Britain you
