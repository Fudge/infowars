[00:00.000 --> 00:10.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.280 --> 00:11.280]  You want answers?
[00:11.280 --> 00:13.480]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.480 --> 00:17.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.640 --> 00:28.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:28.120 --> 00:36.720]  Here we are, another week spanning out before us, it is Monday, the 23rd day of April, 2011.
[00:36.720 --> 00:41.160]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to have open phones yet again, four first
[00:41.160 --> 00:42.840]  time callers later in the hour.
[00:42.840 --> 00:48.840]  Then we're going to get into Agenda 21 and how it ties in with Big Pharma, Big Agra,
[00:48.840 --> 00:54.600]  trying to shut down people's independence from vitamins and minerals right into gardening
[00:54.600 --> 00:55.600]  and farming.
[00:55.600 --> 01:02.720]  Dr. Cordy Gold joining us in the second hour and open phones into the third hour as well.
[01:02.720 --> 01:06.800]  Look at this piece of news, out of the Detroit news.
[01:06.800 --> 01:13.160]  General Motors to build the 2013 Cadillac in China this year.
[01:13.160 --> 01:20.160]  I remember government motors announcing that billions of dollars, was it more than 20
[01:20.160 --> 01:26.680]  million total, was moving, using the money to move the factories, I can't even say it's
[01:26.680 --> 01:31.160]  so amazing, to Eastern Europe, China and Brazil.
[01:31.160 --> 01:33.920]  This is the new world order.
[01:33.920 --> 01:37.440]  This is globalism and this is not done to build up those countries.
[01:37.440 --> 01:39.480]  People can't even afford the cars there.
[01:39.480 --> 01:45.040]  It is meant to complete the implosion of the West and Agenda 21.
[01:45.040 --> 01:51.120]  And that dovetails with human events, summertime blues, they're closing many U.S. national
[01:51.120 --> 01:55.640]  parks, not even for their usual excuse of saving money because everything has to go
[01:55.640 --> 02:00.800]  to Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, all your tax money, but because humans are bad for the
[02:00.800 --> 02:01.800]  earth.
[02:01.800 --> 02:07.000]  So this is the Agenda 21 UN maps where over half the country is off limits.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.640]  We'll show you some of those coming up in the second segment today and I'll do a special
[02:11.640 --> 02:15.800]  report on this on the nightly news this evening as well.
[02:15.800 --> 02:22.520]  That dovetails with UN seeks new powers to remake world at Rio Sustainability Summit,
[02:22.520 --> 02:29.760]  continuing with a infowars.com, prismplanet.com article, new Big Brother satellite to hunt
[02:29.760 --> 02:34.640]  down carbon criminals and of course they admit all over the world governments are now using
[02:34.640 --> 02:39.800]  satellites to harass farmers and landowners if you dare have a well or you dare build
[02:39.800 --> 02:47.520]  a shack or you dare even plant crops, remember last year the EPA said dust is multi-thousand
[02:47.520 --> 02:55.360]  dollar fines per particle of dust, grass dust, hay dust, illegal, no judge, no jury, just
[02:55.360 --> 03:00.400]  a regulation, we're coming for your land, your pigs are invasive, we're going to kill
[03:00.400 --> 03:08.160]  them and arrest you, now happening, just absolute hordes of savage control freaks gibbering
[03:08.160 --> 03:14.640]  with pleasure, TSA, groping miss USA, groping your children, ripping off colostomy bags,
[03:14.640 --> 03:20.320]  armored checkpoint pillboxes being delivered, federal spies on buses and street corners,
[03:20.320 --> 03:25.760]  Houston Chronicle all being announced, just classical in your face tyranny, head of the
[03:25.760 --> 03:30.900]  CIA, we're listening to everything you do with devices inside, all your major appliances
[03:30.900 --> 03:40.560]  in your face, it is just lawless wicked pig government, just pig like tyrants, sucking
[03:40.560 --> 03:47.280]  off everyone, government openly run by foreign banks, Europe squeezed, destroyed, smashed,
[03:47.280 --> 03:52.520]  massive austerity and the dumbed out French run to the hands of a socialist, not the Sarkozy's
[03:52.520 --> 03:58.840]  good, as if socialists save us from the bankers, we only pay 87% in taxes and it's wrecked
[03:58.840 --> 04:04.120]  our economy and the big mega bankers are offshore and suck our money out but our trader French
[04:04.120 --> 04:13.080]  media won't tell us, same thing here, oh the answer is socialism, no, freedom and low taxes
[04:13.080 --> 04:17.920]  and private property is what creates so much wealth, then you become decadent slobs and
[04:17.920 --> 04:25.080]  the usurpers come in and take you over, it is a cycle, that's the problem with prosperity,
[04:25.080 --> 04:31.520]  is that it creates slovenly creatures who don't care a few generations in and the whole
[04:31.520 --> 04:36.200]  cycle repeats itself, this time the cycle is going to repeat itself with elites that
[04:36.200 --> 04:42.960]  have super bio weapons, high tech fission weapons, nuclear weapons, incredible brainwashing
[04:42.960 --> 04:48.360]  propaganda systems, electromagnetic weapons, so that's the problem, usually the elites
[04:48.360 --> 04:52.920]  just get so decadent, they start mirroring their horses, dancing around, going insane
[04:52.920 --> 05:00.840]  and commit suicide, this time they'll probably just blow the planet up when they commit suicide.
[05:00.840 --> 05:04.760]  Hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[05:04.760 --> 05:09.360]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle, did you know that in a real meltdown

[08:02.360 --> 08:08.920]  From his central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues,
[08:08.920 --> 08:25.840]  it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. I find myself shaking my head in disbelief
[08:25.840 --> 08:34.120]  more and more, even though I consciously understand that we're facing a systematic scientific
[08:34.120 --> 08:45.840]  premeditated form of tyranny to watch it unfold in my beloved republic and to see it duplicated
[08:45.840 --> 08:53.000]  all over the world and to know that my nation has been used as the engine and as the brain
[08:53.000 --> 09:04.240]  trust to establish this abomination worldwide is very, very painful. And to realize that
[09:04.240 --> 09:20.960]  infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.com is front and center in the resistance to this
[09:20.960 --> 09:28.480]  voice. That's why I talk about not feeling like I'm doing a good enough job because we
[09:28.480 --> 09:35.400]  are, other than somebody like Ron Paul, the most prominent voice against the new world
[09:35.400 --> 09:48.920]  order and world government. And truth is so much stranger than fiction. And that's why
[09:48.920 --> 09:53.800]  I tend to get down on myself. That's why it's torture when people call in and tell me what
[09:53.800 --> 09:58.560]  a great job I'm doing because I'm just flesh and blood like everybody else. This corruption
[09:58.560 --> 10:03.040]  is so out in the open. I'm like, where are the other people? Well, the answer is they're
[10:03.040 --> 10:09.760]  under mind control. They're under conditioning. They're under Pavlovian manipulation. They've
[10:09.760 --> 10:17.080]  been chemically, biologically, radiologically, electronically, spiritually tampered with.
[10:17.080 --> 10:24.120]  And we've got to find the levers to unlock their minds and get the blinders off. We've
[10:24.120 --> 10:32.560]  got to find the string that unties the knot. We've got to do it very, very quickly. I was
[10:32.560 --> 10:43.200]  thinking this morning about invasive species because this weekend I was inside Austin driving
[10:43.200 --> 10:50.000]  along and I stopped at a red light and I saw a parrot is sitting there in a tree. They
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.880]  call them Monk parakeets, but it's really a parrot. And they've been around for 30 years
[10:54.880 --> 11:02.400]  in central Texas from, they're from South America. And it reminded me the first time
[11:02.400 --> 11:08.240]  I saw a Monk parakeet. It was probably 20 years ago. I was just out of high school.
[11:08.240 --> 11:14.440]  I would go to the downtown YMCA and jog around the lake. They call it Lake. It's really the
[11:14.440 --> 11:18.520]  Colorado River. They call it Lake Austin now Lake Ladybird Lake. See everything is wheels
[11:18.520 --> 11:23.400]  within wheels just to have the accurate data. Everything's a lie. Everything's a deception.
[11:23.400 --> 11:30.840]  It's the ether in which we swim. And I looked up at the telephone pole and it was this giant
[11:30.840 --> 11:35.760]  nest with like 20 parrots going in and out of it. I went back to the YMCA after I jogged
[11:35.760 --> 11:41.040]  and I said, there's parrots. And they said, yeah, those are the Monk parakeets. But my
[11:41.040 --> 11:49.280]  point is this is how my thought process works. I went home last night and this morning and
[11:49.280 --> 11:54.920]  I searched Monk parakeets of Austin, Texas. And you know, there they were in maps of where
[11:54.920 --> 12:02.160]  their nest are and there's thousands of them they estimate. And they're an invasive species
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.480]  and in government was whining about them and worried about them. No fire ants are real
[12:07.480 --> 12:12.720]  invasive species or rabbits in places like Australia where there's no real predators.
[12:12.720 --> 12:19.400]  So they tens of millions of them get produced. But a Monk parakeet. I don't really see that
[12:19.400 --> 12:24.720]  as an invasive species. I mean, crackles are a bird that's on the coast, but they've adapted
[12:24.720 --> 12:28.720]  to human settlements like live around humans. They're annoying, but also interesting to
[12:28.720 --> 12:34.000]  watch. You're like, there's all this important world news when you stop talking about birds.
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.120]  But it hit me this morning. I'm like, why are we worried about an invasive species of
[12:39.120 --> 12:54.400]  a green parrot? But we're not worried about the invasive species of GMO, genetically modified
[12:54.400 --> 12:59.240]  organisms and the media will say, oh, this is just like spliced in two types of carrots.
[12:59.240 --> 13:08.360]  No, that's a hybrid. That's interbreeding totally natural. You can mate a donkey and
[13:08.360 --> 13:14.080]  a horse together and get a mule. You get those type of things in nature. They're almost always
[13:14.080 --> 13:18.560]  generally sterile though. So are most hybrid plants. That's nature's way of dealing with
[13:18.560 --> 13:25.720]  it. You can breed different types of goldfish together. The point is that there's all this
[13:25.720 --> 13:33.240]  freaking out about an invasive vine or an invasive weed or an invasive bird. But then
[13:33.240 --> 13:39.400]  meanwhile, because you can't see it, there are tens of thousands of open air released
[13:39.400 --> 13:46.520]  variants of pharmacological crops. Take protogen 10 years ago, open air planted all over the
[13:46.520 --> 13:53.680]  U.S. corn that grows HIV in it. People didn't believe me when I first reported this, even
[13:53.680 --> 13:56.920]  that was in the Associated Press. I just talked about it. They're like, oh, yeah, there's
[13:56.920 --> 14:02.640]  corn that grows HIV in it. That was just one test they did. And when you look into it,
[14:02.640 --> 14:07.880]  there are tens of thousands. In fact, it's got to be more than that. Some companies alone
[14:07.880 --> 14:15.200]  have done thousands of open air tests of plants that naturally, well, artificially, but themselves
[14:15.200 --> 14:23.720]  grow industrial chemicals, plants that produce pesticides on their own that kill the bugs
[14:23.720 --> 14:29.080]  if they eat them. And you've got to plant refuge. This is the vast majority of the crops
[14:29.080 --> 14:34.040]  we eat, refuge crops right next to it. So the bugs have something to eat the government
[14:34.040 --> 14:39.600]  regulators say because you can't feed the bugs with the humans are being fed. It's killing
[14:39.600 --> 14:45.600]  the honeybees, German studies, U.S. studies. I mean, the list goes on and on. How wild
[14:45.600 --> 15:00.680]  all of this is. And I'm just constantly marveling. And I can't believe that the general public
[15:00.680 --> 15:05.960]  is not more just completely in awe at what's going on because we're living in the middle
[15:05.960 --> 15:11.680]  of a science fiction movie. And the globalist have openly said, well, we're going to do
[15:11.680 --> 15:16.360]  all this whenever mutations happen, happen because humans are natural to this planet.
[15:16.360 --> 15:22.280]  So whatever we do by extension is natural. That's the weird argument they have. And
[15:22.280 --> 15:27.640]  I'm like, okay, well, what if something naturally kills key parts of the biosphere and creates
[15:27.640 --> 15:32.120]  a huge crisis, which is already has to a great extent, or something a mutated virus gets
[15:32.120 --> 15:38.960]  out and kills the majority of homo sapiens sapiens. And that's really the stage that's
[15:38.960 --> 15:44.480]  being shed here. So it can be blamed on that. While the elites build bunkers and underground
[15:44.480 --> 15:52.080]  bases and underground railways and huge armored seed vaults and DNA animal vaults, they say
[15:52.080 --> 16:01.560]  for doomsday scenarios. And it's all the Rockefellers and you in and Ted Turner. There's a headline
[16:01.560 --> 16:06.360]  they found HIV drug grown in genetically engineered plant approved for human testing. Yeah, that's
[16:06.360 --> 16:18.200]  just an HIV drug grown in the plant. I'm talking about HIV. The headline was AIDS vaccine grown
[16:18.200 --> 16:24.280]  in corn. And then you read it, it's a modified AIDS virus in the corn. So they can just extract
[16:24.280 --> 16:34.400]  it from the corn. But there's like 2002. The point is
[16:34.400 --> 16:41.840]  that we are not in Kansas anymore, as I like to say, we are not. And people are worried
[16:41.840 --> 16:45.720]  about their kids grades, they're worried about getting them into college when over half the
[16:45.720 --> 16:51.280]  college graduates aren't ever getting a job that'll pay for their their bills. And that's
[16:51.280 --> 16:58.480]  big studies out today. The civilization, regardless of where we go, up or down or flat, we are
[16:58.480 --> 17:04.640]  not we are not in the world we used to be in. It's Buck Rogers right now. The average
[17:04.640 --> 17:10.040]  person still thinks they can turn on I love Lucy and everything's okay or turn on the
[17:10.040 --> 17:15.400]  football game and at least that's still there. Or go get a TV dinner. It's not the TV dinner
[17:15.400 --> 17:22.600]  grandpa. And then you learn they're doing it all on purpose. And the organ failure is
[17:22.600 --> 17:30.680]  off the chart. And the neurological disorders, the cancer, every disease, every blasphemous
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.600]  curse. And I see it all around me and I'm like, does anybody else see what's going on
[17:35.600 --> 17:46.720]  here? So I thought about the invasive species of GMO and how they control the courts and
[17:46.720 --> 17:53.440]  have gotten and nominated the judges in Monsanto, Arch Daniels, the big, big pharma. That's
[17:53.440 --> 17:59.040]  big Agra. It's the same group, all the big pharma companies. They maneuver their people
[17:59.040 --> 18:07.640]  in where they plant crops next to yours, it infects your crop, they trespass, come on
[18:07.640 --> 18:14.440]  your property, take your plants and a plant's not like a human. One daddy, one mommy. It
[18:14.440 --> 18:18.080]  can have hundreds of daddies and mommies and over the polarization process. And if they
[18:18.080 --> 18:26.760]  find even less than 1% of their genetics in your corn or your canola or your soybean,
[18:26.760 --> 18:33.480]  they take your farm. And the judge says, yes, there's stuff blue on you. You stole it. Again,
[18:33.480 --> 18:39.040]  common law turned on its head because these aren't real courts. These are fraudulent
[18:39.040 --> 18:46.080]  jokes. Then you learn and you learn it was in again, Reuters and you name it 14 years
[18:46.080 --> 18:52.720]  ago and again, 12 years ago that none of the Monsanto facilities for their scientists,
[18:52.720 --> 18:58.840]  they demand there be no GMO in the cafeteria. I heard that a few months ago. That can't
[18:58.840 --> 19:02.920]  be true. Searched it and there it all was. Then I learned all the elite do it publicly.
[19:02.920 --> 19:10.720]  I mean, it's just like, whoa, wow, wow. I'm being assaulted. My family is. All sorts of
[19:10.720 --> 19:15.400]  behavioral problems in the public now, all this stuff. We're being killed. And I don't
[19:15.400 --> 19:19.640]  know how else to say it to you. And then the more you learn, the crazier it gets. And then
[19:19.640 --> 19:26.280]  I learned most food is now infected with nanotech. I learned this today and went and found it.
[19:26.280 --> 19:30.120]  It's a whole area. I didn't even know about for over a decade. And now it's in hundreds
[19:30.120 --> 19:36.160]  and hundreds of products. They're putting nanotech in the food and they admit it's going
[19:36.160 --> 19:48.640]  into people's brains and then when we get back, none of that's a problem though. It's
[19:48.640 --> 19:52.960]  carbon dioxide. They're using spy satellites on people's farms and they're shutting down
[19:52.960 --> 19:57.720]  the national parks for the environment. I'll tell you about that. When we come up, I mean,
[19:57.720 --> 20:01.000]  it's just wild folks.

[22:39.440 --> 22:43.200]  was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater
[22:43.200 --> 22:45.680]  menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.

[24:16.880 --> 24:34.320]  Now the question is, you've got to ask yourself, who are you? What side are you on? I know
[24:34.320 --> 24:50.800]  who I am. Knowing yourself is half the battle. And not compromising. Crank it up.
[24:50.800 --> 25:07.800]  What if I say I'm not like the others? What if I say I'm not just another one of your
[25:07.800 --> 25:23.800]  legs? You're the pretender. What if I say I'm not just another one of your legs?
[25:23.800 --> 25:31.800]  It's time to get real as the food fighters are telling us. Stop pretending. Get real.
[25:31.800 --> 25:43.480]  The windows. A perception to the greater universe. I ask you again, who are you? I'll tell you
[25:43.480 --> 25:51.280]  who I am. I'm on team humanity. I know my life is incredibly short. And I look at the
[25:51.280 --> 25:56.880]  literature, the art, the architecture, the love, the passion. I look at the innocence
[25:56.880 --> 26:02.200]  of my children and other people's children. And I have a deep desire to defend humanity.
[26:02.200 --> 26:07.760]  I have a deep desire for wholesomeness. I have a deep desire to be honorable and to
[26:07.760 --> 26:16.400]  be strong. I have a deep desire to uplift the species. To uplift beauty and innocence
[26:16.400 --> 26:28.040]  and everything wholesome. And I have a deep dislike for ugliness. You know, they say in
[26:28.040 --> 26:33.120]  exorcisms, whether you believe it or not, that the demons are in the people's minds
[26:33.120 --> 26:39.120]  speaking horrible things to them constantly until they finally take them over. And I watch
[26:39.120 --> 26:45.040]  television and the culture and the dedication to sickness and ugliness and the children's
[26:45.040 --> 26:51.680]  cartoons now are hyper sped up and even cause convulsions and make no sense and are confusing
[26:51.680 --> 26:57.800]  to rewire their brains. And the studies come out and it is rewiring their brains. It is
[26:57.800 --> 27:05.040]  just a savage, hateful death letter to humanity. And I'm writing a love letter to humanity
[27:05.040 --> 27:11.000]  and I'm saying shake it off, folks. Shake off the mind control. You got to get mad first
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.240]  to do that. I'm telling you anger is a gift. Who said that? One of the people from rage
[27:16.240 --> 27:20.440]  against the machine? Yes, their anger hasn't led them to understand socialism as another
[27:20.440 --> 27:31.320]  tool of the globalist, but whatever the statement is true. But after the anger comes the focus.
[27:31.320 --> 27:38.040]  The question is, can you handle the focus? Well, you better. I'm the first to love distraction
[27:38.040 --> 27:42.800]  and diversion, but it doesn't fulfill. It's hollow. It's like cotton candy. It's good
[27:42.800 --> 27:46.760]  while you're eating it, but doesn't sit well in your stomach and gives you a headache an
[27:46.760 --> 27:53.600]  hour later. Whereas grandma's good old cooking didn't do that, did it? It was satisfying
[27:53.600 --> 28:03.200]  in your stomach. You were full all day from that Sunday lunch. That's the difference.
[28:03.200 --> 28:12.160]  The New World Order's poison cotton GMO candy or what's natural here on God's green earth.
[28:12.160 --> 28:19.040]  And that's the paradox is that the very people, the greatest crime of the fake environmentalist
[28:19.040 --> 28:26.740]  Al Gore crew is that it's all a movement to make mankind feel guilty. So that the television
[28:26.740 --> 28:33.200]  and the culture controllers can play the part of God's and direct us and tax us and suck
[28:33.200 --> 28:41.640]  off of us. That's the great crime. And then actually wreck the planet in the process diverting
[28:41.640 --> 28:49.040]  everyone from the invasive species. What do you think a GMO virus or bacteria is a bacteria
[28:49.040 --> 28:54.080]  is living viruses are really nature's nanotech. But I think viruses are living. There's a
[28:54.080 --> 29:03.520]  long scientific debate about that. But they're living. They replicate. They operate as parasites
[29:03.520 --> 29:12.160]  within more complex life forms. They're alive. But they're like antimatter of life. But they
[29:12.160 --> 29:26.400]  also give life. Nothing man has invented is new. It's only squat, ugly copycat counterfeit
[29:26.400 --> 29:39.800]  frauds of the galactic system of life. When we come back, prison agenda 21, the environmentalist
[29:39.800 --> 29:46.680]  cult launches new phases of complete takeover. National parks to be shuttered against invasive
[29:46.680 --> 29:54.840]  humans spy satellites in action. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones
[29:54.840 --> 30:04.160]  and the GCN radio network. A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research
[30:04.160 --> 30:08.720]  into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving. And my research
[30:08.720 --> 30:13.520]  led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[30:13.520 --> 30:18.400]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[30:18.400 --> 30:24.160]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves,
[30:24.160 --> 30:29.640]  fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company
[30:29.640 --> 30:34.400]  out there and discovered young Jevity. The young Jevity products are designed to give
[30:34.400 --> 30:38.640]  you the real nutrition you need. And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as

[32:00.560 --> 32:05.200]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[32:05.200 --> 32:09.520]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:09.520 --> 32:13.840]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[32:13.840 --> 32:18.920]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[32:18.920 --> 32:23.560]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[32:23.560 --> 32:29.200]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:29.200 --> 32:33.520]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[32:33.520 --> 32:37.680]  of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[32:37.680 --> 32:42.000]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.320]  in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[32:53.240 --> 33:20.880]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:20.880 --> 33:27.080]  Think of how far humanity has come. Think of what our ancestors went through against
[33:27.080 --> 33:36.080]  the bare elements, bare knuckle battles, with the big cave bears and the lions and the elements
[33:36.080 --> 33:43.200]  and the famines and the disease, everything that brought us to this point as humanity.
[33:43.200 --> 33:48.400]  And we stand on the shoulders of our ancestors of every race, color, and creed. And I ask
[33:48.400 --> 33:53.560]  you now, are we really going to let a bunch of mad scientists, I mean, look at the psychology
[33:53.560 --> 34:01.080]  of the globalist. Think about it. They routinely make 40-to-1 bets with other people's money,
[34:01.080 --> 34:09.240]  lose it and don't get in trouble, aka MF Global, John Corzine. The elite British royalty funded
[34:09.240 --> 34:17.680]  five British families, the Galtons, the Wedgewoods, the Darwin's, the Huxleys, and one other,
[34:17.680 --> 34:22.240]  to enter breed, they thought it would create a superman that lived hundreds of years and
[34:22.240 --> 34:27.880]  was a genius, that created mentally retarded children, stillborn deaths, and a few highly
[34:27.880 --> 34:34.640]  intelligent, adult, semi-weirdo creatures. And by that, smart, but a lot of quirks and
[34:34.640 --> 34:39.760]  problems that wasn't even greater than the original intelligence of the scientific families
[34:39.760 --> 34:50.080]  seen as the smartest in the UK. I mean, they're going off of a 160-year plan, conservatively,
[34:50.080 --> 34:56.000]  over 160 years old since they launched it. The whole world is based on it. The whole
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.960]  world system is based on this. And it's an old idea that goes back to Plato and the Greeks
[35:02.960 --> 35:10.000]  of Eugenics, picked up 160 years ago as social Darwinism, survival of the fittest, and it
[35:10.000 --> 35:17.200]  just isn't operating in reality. And the whole system's based on it, and almost no one understands
[35:17.200 --> 35:23.520]  this. My one victory I can really feel good about is finally a core of people and news
[35:23.520 --> 35:27.880]  websites and talk show hosts, and of course none of them giving us any credit and I could
[35:27.880 --> 35:32.320]  care less. That's even better in a way, I actually like that. That way they can't kill
[35:32.320 --> 35:37.120]  me or destroy me politically or say that I, you know, murder Easter bunnies or something
[35:37.120 --> 35:42.880]  and then attack the idea. So actually it's a good thing. And say all this eugenics stuff
[35:42.880 --> 35:50.040]  is discredited because Alex was caught, you know, again, murdering Easter bunnies or leprechauns
[35:50.040 --> 35:55.440]  or whatever it is they make up, whatever, fantasy unicorns. I'm chopping unicorn horns
[35:55.440 --> 36:01.400]  off and living in a subterranean vault. The point is that the idea is now out there, the
[36:01.400 --> 36:07.680]  reality's out there. The enemy is more and more being engaged because there's a real
[36:07.680 --> 36:13.080]  core. I call a core, you know, I don't know millions of people now that really get it
[36:13.080 --> 36:18.560]  and you've got to get this message out to people because they won't get it right away.
[36:18.560 --> 36:22.880]  That okay, this is a more and more of an artificial habitat we've been put in. They're taking
[36:22.880 --> 36:28.080]  out more and more of the natural areas of our habitat, blocking us off limits to those
[36:28.080 --> 36:33.320]  guys. Pull up the Dr. Michael Kauffman UN map here in a few minutes. I wanted to get
[36:33.320 --> 36:39.160]  that pulled up before the 20 break. And I want to pull up the Dr. Michael Kauffman map,
[36:39.160 --> 36:44.760]  the UN 21 map to show people the congressional map on that when I get into this news. They
[36:44.760 --> 36:49.520]  are phasing out our connections to the land, our connections to reality, our connections
[36:49.520 --> 36:56.280]  to family because it's an artificial system in their own words. Brave new world. I want
[36:56.280 --> 37:01.560]  to buy that and bulk and shell it and put maybe a little pamphlet in with it with the
[37:01.560 --> 37:07.200]  words of Aldous Huxley. Tell Tim, I want to buy that in bulk. And then I'm going to write
[37:07.200 --> 37:12.000]  like a one page pamphlet so that people can give it to friends and family with quotes,
[37:12.000 --> 37:18.080]  like a little double fold deal of Huxley at Berkeley and other places saying and in brave
[37:18.080 --> 37:27.400]  new world revisited that this is not fiction that he wrote in 1932. He wrote it in 31 published
[37:27.400 --> 37:33.200]  in 32 where there's a global government and they shrink humans down to be more manageable
[37:33.200 --> 37:38.920]  and have a subway drone class and then a classes above that. And now that's being proposed
[37:38.920 --> 37:44.560]  in mainstream news, cutting food off genetically engineering babies before they go in the womb
[37:44.560 --> 37:48.920]  to be smaller for the earth. You're like, that sounds crazy. The point is, these people
[37:48.920 --> 37:55.320]  are crazy. And Huxley said this is our real plan. My brother heads up UNESCO. He said
[37:55.320 --> 38:02.200]  this in the 50s, Julian Huxley. And it's just all there. You read a book written in 31
[38:02.200 --> 38:08.040]  that these people envisioned and now it's beginning to come true. And then we've got
[38:08.040 --> 38:12.840]  him telling you, well, I wrote this as fiction because we wanted to put out to the public
[38:12.840 --> 38:19.680]  what we were going to do to you. And by the year 2000 or so much of this will, much of
[38:19.680 --> 38:24.840]  the foundation for this will be in place. And they're already engineering us with nano
[38:24.840 --> 38:30.920]  tech and the food and water that's admitted. They're already engineering us with thousands
[38:30.920 --> 38:36.320]  of variant crops on record that just wreak havoc and every mammal you feed them to within
[38:36.320 --> 38:40.960]  three generations near complete sterility, hair growing out of rats mouths, genitals
[38:40.960 --> 38:52.000]  on the top of their head or the order shrunken intestines, mutations. You see, unbelievable.
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.800]  We're at least 30 years into the first phases of them testing us. That's a generation and
[38:55.800 --> 39:03.440]  a half. You're like a generation. That's 74 years. Generation recycle. I'm talking about
[39:03.440 --> 39:09.280]  when the when they have youth on average around 20. So we're 30 years or so into that. That's
[39:09.280 --> 39:14.280]  a generation and a half. So you see the massive mutations, the brain damage, the autism from
[39:14.280 --> 39:21.320]  one in 25,300 to one in the 50s or 60s, depending on which number you look at, just massive,
[39:21.320 --> 39:29.560]  just all of it. It's here. It's here. It's here. We're a generation and a half and it's
[39:29.560 --> 39:39.640]  following the exact graph of all the other mammals, pigs, goats, guinea pigs, rabbits,
[39:39.640 --> 39:46.080]  lab rats, lab mice, all the same, all the same, all the same, terminal, terminal, terminal,
[39:46.080 --> 39:52.440]  red alert, red alert, emergency made a globally, psychopaths, inbred psychopaths who develop
[39:52.440 --> 40:01.560]  their plans under syphilitic mind rot in the 1860s are in control. Emergency, emergency,
[40:01.560 --> 40:10.440]  emergency, emergency. Do you understand? This is an emergency. This is an emergency. We've
[40:10.440 --> 40:16.800]  got to get these people out of there now. We've got to start reversing this now. They've
[40:16.800 --> 40:22.320]  had control of the West through social engineering and chemical attacks for 100 years or more.
[40:22.320 --> 40:26.200]  Hitler just moved a little too fast for him. It went after one or two groups. The global
[40:26.200 --> 40:34.760]  didn't like that. They're going after everybody. And now for more than three decades, they've
[40:34.760 --> 40:38.640]  been hitting us with a bio attack through the food. They've been hitting us for 60 years
[40:38.640 --> 40:42.800]  through the chemical attack in the water. They're hitting us electromagnetically. They're
[40:42.800 --> 40:49.640]  hitting us and hitting us hard. And their hate of humanity is so great, they've accepted
[40:49.640 --> 40:55.120]  blowback on themselves. They take mitigating factors. They've got some reversal systems,
[40:55.120 --> 40:59.720]  some treatments. They've got clean water, non GMO food, but they're still hit by the
[40:59.720 --> 41:04.040]  electromagnetic and all the rest of it. That's why globalists, most of them have moved to
[41:04.040 --> 41:09.160]  remote areas and are now telecommuting. You can look into that trend. The elite are dug
[41:09.160 --> 41:16.680]  in, dug in in high mountain areas, staying far away from what they're doing to us. This
[41:16.680 --> 41:28.520]  is a black commitment to Hades and everything wicked.
[41:28.520 --> 41:36.040]  Let me just give the number out. I said I would 800-259-9231, first time callers. You
[41:36.040 --> 41:39.120]  have millions and millions of listeners. I want to give people every day a new chance
[41:39.120 --> 41:44.960]  to call and give people their chance. 800-259-9231. If you want to speak about this, I mean,
[41:44.960 --> 41:51.800]  I'll get more into this after we take calls, but FDA targets nanoparticles and food appliances
[41:51.800 --> 41:57.000]  over health risk. And it goes on. This is direct links to the U.S. government admitting
[41:57.000 --> 42:08.400]  it and the project on emerging nanotechnologies. And it goes on to show brain damage in fish
[42:08.400 --> 42:20.040]  and in mammals that it's been tested on. There's over 1,300 manufacturers of everyday
[42:20.040 --> 42:26.080]  products, food, you name it, filled. This is a prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, article
[42:26.080 --> 42:31.480]  by Mike Barrett. Very good job. And I didn't even know about this. I knew it was some nanotech,
[42:31.480 --> 42:35.600]  but I didn't know for a decade it had proliferated across the board and across his blood brain
[42:35.600 --> 42:44.200]  barrier. It's oh my God. Neurological disorders are just a car. These people are killing everybody.
[42:44.200 --> 42:50.640]  And they know exactly what they're doing. The black devil in hell and God in heaven
[42:50.640 --> 42:56.680]  are the only ones that know exactly how bad it is. Continuing here, scientists call for
[42:56.680 --> 43:01.200]  global ban on be-killing pesticides. Really going to ban the ones that are in the GMO?
[43:01.200 --> 43:06.040]  That's what's really killing them. They go get that pollen and it kills them. The plants
[43:06.040 --> 43:10.480]  grow pesticides so bugs won't eat it and they feed it to us. Did you hear that message?
[43:10.480 --> 43:14.860]  Did you get that transmit? Did you hear how hardcore that little statement is hiding in
[43:14.860 --> 43:29.120]  plain view? And then I got hit by this little jewel. New Big Brother satellite to hunt down
[43:29.120 --> 43:36.360]  carbon criminals. This story is eight years old, but now it's back on the news. The Geospatial
[43:36.360 --> 43:42.640]  Administration, NASA, NSA, all of them, it turned out were giving local and viral cops
[43:42.640 --> 43:48.960]  and local police access to the super high tech satellites that in the 60s could zoom
[43:48.960 --> 43:56.080]  in and read the date on a penny. Do you imagine what they can do now in 2012? Eight, nine
[43:56.080 --> 44:00.800]  years ago it was in what the Denver Post that they were going after people that built barns
[44:00.800 --> 44:05.720]  on their property when they get told you can't now for the earth. You could plant some GMO
[44:05.720 --> 44:12.080]  that'll kill everybody, but don't build a barn. Can't build a GM vehicle here either.
[44:12.080 --> 44:16.840]  They're going to build Cadillacs in China now. Did I mention that? I won't be any rules
[44:16.840 --> 44:21.080]  over there. That's because the globalists have got their investments over there. You
[44:21.080 --> 44:25.960]  like how that works? Shut us down. Put all the power over there. China's adopted eugenics.
[44:25.960 --> 44:32.240]  They're in the catbird seat. They don't need the TSA reaching out in their pants. Their
[44:32.240 --> 44:39.320]  government's feeding them GMO and reaching into their DNA. Continuing here, labeled
[44:39.320 --> 44:44.760]  carbon sat. The satellite system will have the ability and differentiate between natural
[44:44.760 --> 44:48.840]  carbon emissions and man-made CO2 releases. They're announcing they're banning outdoor
[44:48.840 --> 44:56.480]  fireplaces, indoor fireplaces, space heaters. This will identify it. It can even identify
[44:56.480 --> 44:59.440]  humans exhaling. The European Space Agency has set the green light that is surveillance
[44:59.440 --> 45:04.360]  satellite. It's not just usually old ones. It's new ones that will measure man-made carbon
[45:04.360 --> 45:08.800]  emissions from space in order to hunt down, that's their quote, violators of international
[45:08.800 --> 45:18.440]  climate agreements allowing Big Brother to enforce future tax on CO2 emissions.
[45:18.440 --> 45:22.120]  The Astri Impress Release announcing the project makes no mention of the fact that the satellite
[45:22.120 --> 45:26.000]  will be used to perform surveillance on individuals and businesses to keep tabs on their carbon
[45:26.000 --> 45:31.280]  footprint, instead presenting its roles merely measuring carbon emissions. Now let me give
[45:31.280 --> 45:43.800]  you the big super enchilada article right now. Guys, do we have the map to show TV viewers,
[45:43.800 --> 45:49.760]  if not just type in U and Agenda 21 Off Limits Maps or Congressional Map on Biodiversity
[45:49.760 --> 45:56.560]  or Dr. Michael Kaufman with a C and you'll get the Congressional Maps, a simulated reserve
[45:56.560 --> 46:02.400]  corridor system to protect biodiversity. He just took the maps that they had in the mid-90s
[46:02.400 --> 46:07.520]  and integrated them in. He had them on a region-by-region base. He just integrated them together and
[46:07.520 --> 46:11.600]  he is an environmentalist and biologist and all that stuff, so he was able to integrate
[46:11.600 --> 46:18.320]  it for Congress and I noticed the area they've grabbed just south of Austin as a UN reserve.
[46:18.320 --> 46:22.760]  Years after, by the way, he did this map is exactly what they did grab. I mean, it is
[46:22.760 --> 46:28.320]  dead on and they've got the UN signs there now. They've got the UN Baby Blue Affiliate
[46:28.320 --> 46:37.600]  Group. So this is what's going on at the national parks and buffer zones. This is now happening.
[46:37.600 --> 46:43.320]  There it is. Around half the country completely off limits. In the west, over 85% of the land
[46:43.320 --> 46:47.640]  is owned by the feds. They're now blocking it, tearing up the roads, blocking the dirt
[46:47.640 --> 46:53.960]  roads, not letting people go in and run their cattle on it. It's over. 80% plus the western
[46:53.960 --> 47:02.320]  U.S. off limits. It's as high as 60% in some areas of the east and midwest. Texas has the
[47:02.320 --> 47:07.760]  most private land in the country. The feds are here like locust. Now, let me continue
[47:07.760 --> 47:17.880]  here. This is from human events. And of course, she did a good job. Audrey Hudson, but Audrey,
[47:17.880 --> 47:21.480]  I know you'll end up getting sent video of this. Let me just tell you something. Let
[47:21.480 --> 47:25.360]  me give you the rest of the story as Paul Harvey would say. They're announcing all over
[47:25.360 --> 47:31.600]  the U.S. they're shutting down completely to human access or to partial human access,
[47:31.600 --> 47:37.480]  to national parks. This is about, they already have this all over Austin. They've taken
[47:37.480 --> 47:41.240]  parks that I went to as a child. They got fences up around them saying environmentally
[47:41.240 --> 47:52.040]  sensitive area. It's called an exercise of power. Headline should be the beginning of
[47:52.040 --> 47:58.600]  closure of national parks begins under agenda 21 UN treaty. As Hillary said, she is for
[47:58.600 --> 48:09.280]  total individual firearms bans civilian ownership ban. Uniteer UN treaty agreement July 7, 2000.
[48:09.280 --> 48:14.680]  They agreed to ban all firearms in civilian hands. Go read it. They said the civilian
[48:14.680 --> 48:20.680]  ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state July 7, 2000.
[48:20.680 --> 48:28.400]  United Nations building on Rockefeller land, New York City, Eastern Seaboard, North America
[48:28.400 --> 48:33.360]  Area, FEMA, region one dictatorship. Is it New York or FEMA region one? Please check
[48:33.360 --> 48:41.000]  my memory. Thank you. Planning a vacation this summer to Miami's Biscayne Bay for a
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.240]  little fishing. Think again, because the National Park Service wants to set aside a large swath
[48:45.240 --> 48:50.040]  of the pristine areas of marine reserve zone. So you might want to leave the fishing poles
[48:50.040 --> 48:55.280]  at home and the boat, but that's okay. Sounds like it's reasonable, right? Fishing it. Oh,
[48:55.280 --> 48:59.880]  great. Perhaps horseback riding is more your speed. Nope, that's banned. And the family
[48:59.880 --> 49:04.480]  plans to ride through California, Sequoia or King Canyon National Park. Sorry. But
[49:04.480 --> 49:09.800]  all the permits were pulled for those activities and soon you won't drive a car into any of
[49:09.800 --> 49:14.720]  them. They're already getting it ready at the Grand Canyon with big giant parking lots.
[49:14.720 --> 49:21.120]  That's your lot less sustainable to make you go on the buses with audio droning, in packing
[49:21.120 --> 49:25.200]  you about how bad humans are. Think you want to go eat? They give coloring books to your
[49:25.200 --> 49:31.800]  kids telling them, go get your, present this coupon and get a free badge. And when they
[49:31.800 --> 49:34.880]  show up to get the free badge, I went and looked, they try to sell them like a hundred
[49:34.880 --> 49:40.480]  dollar uniform and have more stuff about tell your parents what to do to turn the lights
[49:40.480 --> 49:44.800]  off. Don't let them take hot baths. Your parents are bad. I mean, this is a go to a national
[49:44.800 --> 49:58.320]  park. This is actually going on FEMA region to thank you. New York, New York by itself
[49:58.320 --> 50:01.360]  is from a region to that's right. I forgot what's from a region one main and all that
[50:01.360 --> 50:08.360]  is my memory failing. New England. Yes. Okay. Anyways, and they go on to announce all over
[50:08.360 --> 50:15.560]  the country. And of course, this it's even worse. They're not even allowing. This is
[50:15.560 --> 50:20.440]  the feds people into many of these. I remember they took that land right across from the
[50:20.440 --> 50:24.520]  Golden Gate Bridge and said it would be an environmental preserve and kicked the people
[50:24.520 --> 50:28.840]  off their homes in the 60s and 70s. There's been big articles in the San Francisco Chronicle
[50:28.840 --> 50:33.360]  how they then partially shut it down to humans, then put cameras in and then fully shut it
[50:33.360 --> 50:40.360]  down. And then it turns out the state people that are in it own the private homes themselves
[50:40.360 --> 50:46.800]  and have luxury parties in thousands of acres they stole. That's how it's feudalism. It's
[50:46.800 --> 50:51.960]  agenda 21 in your face in the hunger games. And I've since learned it looks like the author
[50:51.960 --> 50:55.680]  is a good lady and is actually aware of it wanted to show people the tyranny she thinks
[50:55.680 --> 51:02.200]  coming. So we did confirm she knows what she's talking about your calls coming up 37 things

[54:46.360 --> 54:53.200]  i'm looking for is freedom is survival of our species the globalists tell us we're
[54:53.200 --> 54:58.840]  crud all day a lot of you will buy into it and act like it but we're not we're made
[54:58.840 --> 55:05.080]  in the image of the creator of all that is that's a pretty big deal isn't it and we
[55:05.080 --> 55:10.600]  haven't begun to discover our true destiny let's talk to Gina in Oregon you're on the
[55:10.600 --> 55:16.920]  air welcome hi alex it's so good to talk to you good to talk to you absolutely thank
[55:16.920 --> 55:23.000]  you for your work i think the reason i'm calling is because i have a i'm torn in a million
[55:23.000 --> 55:29.000]  directions like i'm sure many of your listeners are i mean from you know we're bombarded from
[55:29.000 --> 55:34.800]  the gmo's i mean the new world order FEMA vaccinations you know my friends just had
[55:34.800 --> 55:38.640]  babies i tell them not to vaccinate and they're slowly killing them and they're scared they
[55:38.640 --> 55:42.920]  can't get them into school without it i mean you know we've relocated my husband and i
[55:42.920 --> 55:47.720]  we were on the Oregon coast i know it's a terrible hellacious zone it's probably going
[55:47.720 --> 55:52.400]  to be the next earthquake i'm aware of the planets and stuff so we wrote like relocated
[55:52.400 --> 55:57.600]  to higher ground and a hundred miles inland i've got a food supply i've got seeds i'm
[55:57.600 --> 56:02.080]  doing everything i can and i'm preaching to my friends and the ones that look at me like
[56:02.080 --> 56:05.400]  i'm crazier the same ones that look up at the chemtrails that i'm pointing out you know
[56:05.400 --> 56:10.000]  the crisscross in the sky and they say jeana it's planes and i say what the hell are they
[56:10.000 --> 56:15.040]  doing are they playing hopscotch up there what's going on wake up but i don't know how you
[56:15.040 --> 56:20.720]  keep your courage and how you keep your resistance to all of it because people are just constantly
[56:20.720 --> 56:24.920]  well the people that are laughing at you don't know that the government admits that there's
[56:24.920 --> 56:31.440]  giant testing programs spraying aluminum dioxide to barium salts and other things that a lot
[56:31.440 --> 56:36.000]  of the jet fuel has it added to it that nasa admits the atmosphere is over twenty percent
[56:36.000 --> 56:42.640]  darker i think what's best with friends is to give them a copy of say a film like what
[56:42.640 --> 56:47.280]  in the world do they spring by the way it's available at info wars dot com or have a showing

[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:38.520]  Now Friday I spent some time getting into incredible news on the Neurological Disorder
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:44.160]  Autism Front. And I'd seen this information before, but here it was in another big study.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.200]  So we're going to be talking about that coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.680]  Continue with your calls. Scott in Idaho, you're on the air. Scott, go ahead.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:59.120]  Good day, Alex. Thank you for taking my call. I am a pastor, kind of out of the sticks.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:06.760]  And I just wanted to get a call up and encourage you, not only what you're doing,
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:13.720]  but also just in some of the statements that you've made recently with some
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:20.240]  frequency, I hear you referring to kind of the clergy response team. And the comments you make,
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.160]  I'm sure they're not intentional, but sometimes they seem pretty absolute. They kind of paint
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:31.480]  all of us who are Christian ministers with a broad brush. And for those of us who are
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:37.760]  awake and who are not only seeking to teach the Bible to our folks, but also shepherd them
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:43.640]  through life, and we're doing our best to wake them up and help them to know that this is
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:48.040]  a spiritual issue at the base. And I'm just a little concerned that maybe some of these
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:55.640]  comments when they're made, and they sound pretty broad on your program may cause some
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:01.320]  undue concern for some folks, not only for those in the church, but for those maybe who are seeking
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:08.040]  at this point, and they may hear some of those. I just got some concern that they might be driven
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:12.480]  away from some of us who are awake and really seeking. Well, here's the deal. I don't get
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.920]  into the nominations. I don't get into all the endless debates about this and that. I know I'm
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:24.120]  as wicked as the day is long. I love God. We are being murdered. There is total attack going on.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:30.440]  Most churches are just give it to God and go along and the government's God and Romans 13,
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:36.960]  and I'll assure you they're wrong. And so I'm here with the frontal assault. Here's the information
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:43.040]  as I see it, and it tends to knock people off their horse and wake them up. And I've had a huge
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.840]  effect. You don't argue with success. I know I've got lots of room for improvement and I
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.400]  improve all the time. Thanks to the good Lord above. And I need criticism. I need it. And I
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:58.680]  pray every day that I be a better person and try to present things better. And I get nasty
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.440]  moods. I mean, Friday through fits a couple of times on air. Don't you know this stuff gets to
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:09.320]  me? I have to control the fear is gone of being killed or set up with them coming after my family.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:15.080]  Instead, I get mad that I have to be in the position fighting these globalists all day when
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:21.640]  they're destroying themselves. It's so stupid. I want it to stop. So in place of the fear is rage.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:28.000]  And people say, well, you shouldn't be angry all the time. You know what? I found that's where
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.560]  the action begins. And I don't know how to explain it to you, but we need to get moving here. We
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:40.040]  need to get up and do something. You see what I'm saying? I've got no argument with with anything
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:46.000]  you just said. I just I guess I would be hopeful that there would be some way to perhaps balance it.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.760]  I know that you've interviewed, what is it Baldwin? I believe Baldwin. Yeah, Chuck Baldwin. Good
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:56.880]  guy. Okay. And so I know that you understand that all of us aren't asleep or all of us aren't
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:02.000]  in league with the enemy. So I, you know, we're all in league with the devil at one way or
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:09.120]  another. The difference is where your heart is. And all I'm saying is, is that is that all I know
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.000]  is I've been to probably 20 churches. And all I hear even if they're Christians, you can tell if
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.560]  they've got the spirit of the Lord or not is I still then a bunch of government worship and a
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:26.720]  bunch of evil added to it. And it's just it's sick. But I'm confused. What are you saying?
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:33.040]  I'm doing that's going to confuse people when statements are made that are that are very
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:37.120]  absolute. And I understand you're that kind of individual, especially when you get fired up.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:42.240]  I appreciate that. I tend that direction myself. But that when you make a broad sweeping statement
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.360]  that as a for instance, that stay there, I got a guest coming up, but a minute or two on the
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.960]  other side, I want you to be able to finish your point here. I want to hear this genuine
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:57.200]  criticism because I need this information. Then we've got Dr. Corey Gold with incredible info

[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:11.040]  good-sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact that most
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.200]  of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:21.360]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:27.120]  our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy. I then searched out the
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:33.120]  best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products

[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:16.800]  on the GCN Radio Network. We're going to continue with phone calls with Dr. Corey Gold, with us
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:22.240]  a little bit in the next hour. Study links autism with industrial food and environmental toxins.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:28.480]  There's been studies for years. This is what's happening. When you've got cancer, neurological
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:34.960]  disorders, diabetes, degeneration of the joints, life expectancy dropping despite all the heroic
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:39.520]  medical efforts, something's going on. Gee, it's being done on purpose. That's the fact.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:45.520]  So that is coming up with Dr. Corey Gold and more here in a moment. Always great having him on,
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:51.040]  because he told us this a year ago. This is what they talk about. Wait till I get to it.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.800]  Then they're going to shut down the large areas of public lands and national parks to human access
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.920]  or partially, all teaching you what's in 21, FDA targets nanoparticles and food,
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.640]  appliances over health risk, blood-brain barrier, incredible news, Detroit News reports happily.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:14.800]  GM DeBull, it's 2013 Cadillacs in China. I remember a couple years ago when they took
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.240]  over General Motors with your tax money the federal government did, and it was 20-something
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.760]  billion total. It's five billion to move to China, four or five billion to move to Eastern Europe,
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:29.120]  five plus billion to move to Brazil, and then move some stuff to Mexico, anywhere but America.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:37.520]  Your tax money, your tax money pays to move your jobs out of the country. That's what the
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:42.160]  New World Order is. That's what corporate welfare is. That's what crony capitalism is,
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:47.120]  and the answer the media tells us is socialism. They say the free market doesn't work. Well,
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.760]  yeah, when crooks take control of it, it doesn't. It's just not free market. Like the French are
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:56.320]  running to a socialist now who's won the first round of elections, taking control of their parliament.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.520]  They're so desperate they ran to the socialist and are going to probably throw out Sarkozy,
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.960]  who's horrible. I don't like Sarkozy. He's terrible. But the socialist, you already pay on average
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:11.520]  over 80% in taxes. They have the highest taxes in the world in France, one way or another.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:21.280]  And you guys think that's going to fix it. More of it. What a shame. What a shame. What a shame.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.120]  That's what they sell here. The answer socialism. What are the big mega banks want?
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:32.480]  They want socialism, so they get your wealth and transfer it offshore. They want controlled markets.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:42.640]  I just can't believe it. GM to build 2013 Cadillac in China. Unbelievable. Starting next year.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:55.760]  Post industrial world. That's the name of the game. All right. Now I'm going to spend two minutes
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:05.600]  with him because our guest is waiting, but I want to go to the caller. Scott in Idaho was in the
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:10.720]  short rule segment and he said, look, I'm a pastor and your absolute statements may turn people away
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:15.440]  from God. Well, my job is to cover the news here. I don't hide the fact I'm a Christian, but I'm not
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.800]  going to go into the Briar Pratch or the tar baby of these thousands of nominations fighting with
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.080]  each other all day over, you know, they got monopoly on God's have come to their church.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:32.240]  My relationship with God is in my heart. Okay. Now, but I'd like to hear how you say I'm giving
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:38.960]  absolute statements. Go ahead. Okay. First of all, I've got to apologize for miscommunicating had
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.320]  nothing to do. My statement had nothing to do with you driving folks away from God.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:48.160]  Simply for folks like myself who are trying to wake folks up to the greater reality. I mean,
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:53.680]  that we're looking at with the new world order that it can create a greater suspicion
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.200]  of us going in for folks like myself with a statement that has been made along the lines of
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.800]  this, that your minister, you know, is probably part of the clergy response team at this point,
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.560]  that your minister is working with the government. And it sounds like that's been your experience.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:15.280]  For some of us that aren't in that position, it can hamper when those statements are made
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:20.480]  that absolutely, then that can make folks suspicious of me right off the bat. And let's
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:25.360]  face it, I've got a hard enough time as a say that again. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're saying like,
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.840]  if you send people to the show and they hear all this wild stuff being discussed, it scares them
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.880]  with the S those who I have talked to, and if folks are already listening to your show,
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:39.840]  which I hope they are, then if I meet them and have an opportunity to share and reinforce it,
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:46.080]  they may be unduly suspicious of me or folks like me. Well, I mean, look, they want to be timid.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:51.760]  They want, you know, you're telling them Hitler's a bad guy in 1940, and they just don't want to
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.160]  believe it yet. I mean, in 39 Time Magazine was still saying Hitler was a great guy.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:03.360]  My father, when he was a little boy, they still called Stalin Uncle Joe on the news,
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.800]  and how great he was. I mean, the guy killed probably twice what Hitler did.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:14.480]  Uh, this is the time our government made a deal with Mao Zedong. They're naive and I understand.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:21.520]  See, here's why the globalists have one over on us. What they're doing is so crazy, so wild,
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:26.080]  so over the top, people can't believe it's happening. And isn't that the devil's biggest
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.400]  trick? You know, when a burglar comes to your house to rob you, do they want to come in there?
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.240]  No, generally they want to come when you're gone. They don't want you to know they're there.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:40.080]  They want to sneak up. And the globalists have snuck up, and now they've gotten so close,
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:44.880]  they're in our living room, and people don't want to believe it's happening. It's happening.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:53.280]  It's going on. It's real. And look, I know I turn a lot of people off. I've never had a
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:58.640]  calculated plan for my show. I've just gone with my gut, my instinct, my facts, and just let the
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.040]  chips fall where they may. There's no scripting here. That's why the show's popular, despite all
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.800]  the problems. Some days I hear the show, it's terrible. Other times I hear it, it's genius,
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:14.320]  in my humble opinion. The point is, is that, yes, it takes different strokes for different people,
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:20.720]  all kinds, make the world go around, whatever floats your boat, all those sayings. It's going
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:26.560]  to turn some people off, because reality, and I know we're very close to what reality is,
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:35.120]  is crazy. I mean, look, here's an example. I told people two years ago, because it was in the
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:42.960]  executive announcements, that they were funding billions of dollars to send general motors
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:49.040]  overseas, and they basically shut it, most of it down in the U.S. And people sent me emails,
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:53.360]  and I got calls saying that's not true. I mean, here it is, Detroit News today.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:59.360]  You know, Cadillacs be made in China, and they've got all these excuses of why they do it, and the
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:10.880]  rest of it. So, so I sit here, and I deal with this. I mean, I tell people that most of the GMO
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:17.680]  crops sterilize and reduce fertility. I tell people there's cancer viruses and vaccines.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:24.000]  It's true. It's true. So, I mean, what am I supposed to do? Caller?
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.360]  Just keep speaking truth, okay, which I've got no argument with. In the end,
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.680]  brother, I just want you to keep hammering away. I'm going to pray for you. I'm going to stand with
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:40.400]  you. I just thought I'd call up and in wine about it, because it struck me a number of times,
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:44.000]  so I thought rather than just... No, I hear you, I hear you, but the truth is going to freak people
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.040]  out, and I hear you. I could do a better job. God bless you. No, look, when I was dressing up in
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:56.080]  a Joker outfit with white paint on my face to draw an illustration to corruption,
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:04.000]  I knew people would say, this guy's crazy. No, I did an imitation of the Joker. Like, I like to paint,
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.160]  I like poetry, I'm a good actor if I want to be, you know, doing characters and things.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:16.960]  Everybody else would choke in the school play, I wouldn't. And so, I like to have fun sometimes,
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.440]  and people are going to say, oh, well, he's acting crazy in a Joker outfit or Cobra Commander,
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:28.480]  but it's obvious I'm doing a character. You know, why can people like Johnny Carson did that,
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.240]  and it was okay? They're like, well, you're not a comedian. The point is, I'm just real.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:37.200]  I'm just trying to have fun with it. Okay, enough of that, because I want to save some lives.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.880]  Right now, we'll go back to your calls. I'll be with us about 20 minutes in the next hour.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:47.200]  I really appreciate him joining us. I saw this report, actually several reports
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:53.680]  last week. New study links autism to high fructose corn syrup.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:00.080]  And there's another report here. Study links autism with industrial food and environmental
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:08.080]  toxins. April is Autism Awareness Month and the Journal of Clinical Epigenetics.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:14.320]  And there's a bunch of other studies have said this. The study explores how mineral efficiencies
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:19.920]  affected by dietary factors such as high fructose corn syrup could impact how the human body
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:24.640]  ridges itself of common toxic chemicals like mercury and pesticides. See, and here's what
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.560]  the studies basically show. We're going to get Dr. Gold, who's been saying this for over a decade.
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:33.360]  He's a dentist and a lot of other things to break it down. And one of the major formulators of
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.680]  some of the best health products out there, but that's a side issue.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:45.760]  From my study, and this is just out there hidden in plain view, when you eat heavy metals and things,
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:59.760]  the minerals and vitamins, the minerals and vitamins aren't just needed for your body. They bind
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:05.920]  with the toxins that help bring them out. And when you don't have the normal minerals
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:10.400]  and the trace elements, all the toxic things are able to bind and fill up your different glands
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.320]  and bones and things. Now that's a layman's way of saying it, but I want to break down this new
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:19.520]  study. We're about to go to break, but Dr. Gold joins us. And of course, we'll go over his bio
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.160]  when we come back, but he's a dentist. He's also got some other degrees also in health care, but
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:28.800]  we'll leave it at that for now. Doc, briefly get into what's happening here and why even mainstream
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:33.760]  science is having to admit this now. Well, some are admitting it, some are not. But if somebody
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.560]  was to tell you that our own Center for Disease Control would admit to at least one out of every
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:46.160]  56 boys age eight today have some form of autism spectrum, it's unbelievable. One out of 56 and
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.840]  nobody seems, it's like the sky is falling with autism and no one seems to notice. Why is it now
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:56.720]  one out of 56? Oh, we don't know. Everybody just keep going on, watch Dancing with the Stars,
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:02.320]  the NFL's about to go on. I think there's a comedy show on TV. No one look over here. One out of
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:09.680]  every 56 eight year olds in America today has some form of autism spectrum. That is unbelievable.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:14.800]  And they're leading us to believe that there's no reason for it. When I was growing up as a kid,
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.280]  it was very rare that somebody had autism. In fact, if you look in Iceland today, it's still
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:24.880]  like one out of every 1500, one of every 1200 kids. But here in the United States, one out of every
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:32.880]  88 eight year olds, it's growing at such an enormous pace and no one is asking why. Time
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.280]  magazine had a big article on this in their health section just a year or two ago. And they said,
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:43.920]  well, maybe 30 or 40% of that increase is due to better testing, better reporting. But no one
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:50.960]  ever asked, what's the other 70% from? Okay, so we were testing better, but 70% increase from other
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:56.720]  sources. We don't even talk about it. Well, that's a whitewash too. I mean, children don't look the
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:03.120]  same. And the and I go out in public. The kids look bad. I mean, if people think the cancers
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.640]  and all the rest of it and children's bad now, my gosh, it's going off the charts.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:12.720]  Well, and no one's talking about it. We're doing lots of walks for the cures. We're doing lots of
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:18.480]  walks for this. No one's doing any walks for the cause. I mean, the biggest thing to my mind is
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:25.600]  what is causing this explosion of autism spectrum disorders, childhood cancers, childhood obesity.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:33.040]  Hey, start a breast cancer thing or a pediatric march for the cause and use it for people that
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:38.240]  want to come out and expose the cancer society and the rest of them. Hey, your racket, you know the
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:45.040]  cause GMO pesticides, toxins, vaccines, you know the cause and have all the facts. See how they
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:49.600]  like that. No, they just want to have the events raise money and stick it in their fat, greedy,
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:55.120]  murderous pockets. Well, if we had a car and somebody said, well, don't put good fuel in it.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.200]  Just stick all this other stuff in it. You go, wait a second, my car is not working well. It was
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:03.360]  never designed to work with the junk they're putting in. But our bodies were putting in all
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.360]  kinds of things that were never designed to go into our bodies. And no one's saying, Hey, wait a
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:12.720]  second, why is our body working well? The fuel we're putting in is absolutely atrocious. Yeah,
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:17.920]  the, the globalists are urinating in the gas tank and then telling us they want to find a cure for
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:23.280]  the broken engine instead of stop urinating in the gas tank. Yeah, we're going to make GMO
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.600]  genetically modified foods that will be resistant to all kinds of bugs and pesticides. In fact,
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:32.240]  it kills the bugs, but don't worry, it's absolutely safe for you. It makes no sense at all.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:39.280]  What it is is cuckoo crazy nuts. And then, you know, the United States before the age of five,
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:45.120]  the average kid will receive 36 vaccinations. Some of them are triple vaccinations and they contain
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.200]  all kinds of adjuvants that are quite frankly hundreds of times more higher than the levels
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:55.600]  allowed by law in certain areas. Listen, I go out in public and I mean, kids look like they've been
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:02.880]  run over by trucks. I mean, I mean, they look unhealthy, sickly. They look like they're dying.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:08.960]  I mean, it's scary folks, more and more children. I see just, we're, man, this is big. How are they
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:12.960]  going to cover it up when it's one in 10? I was looking at the numbers. They're estimating at this
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:18.160]  an increase rate in less than a decade. It'll be more than one in 10 with a neurological disorder.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:23.040]  Oh, that's how they're going to solve unemployment. Don't worry, you'll be hired helping out those
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.840]  who can't help themselves. Everybody's going to be shadows helping children schools and helping
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.840]  adults, you know, who can't help themselves. We're going to solve unemployment by having
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:38.160]  people help the disabled that we create. That's actually what Wired Magazine talked about 12
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.360]  years ago. You may have hit something there. They say they're going to give us lots of
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:46.240]  little make work things to do or the elite can just get rid of us. That's the whole debate
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:51.920]  they're having. Wow. And if you look in the school systems, everything's being geared down
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.600]  because you have to handle this population that really has a tough time learning,
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:59.280]  not be the kids because the kids don't want to learn. It's harder for them to learn. Who would
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.480]  come up with something like this? I want to get into the science and the facts, but I mean,
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:07.440]  people don't believe in the devil. I mean, only something like the devil could come up with
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.720]  something that's diabolical because you know, from my research, you've done your own. Do you
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.920]  think this is on accident, Dr. Gold? I think way too many people know now whether it started
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:21.440]  on accident. It's like the tobacco. We were told for years and years, don't worry, tobacco's safe.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.840]  But for decades, people behind the scenes knew it was killing people, causing cancers,
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:31.280]  addicting. Incorrect. Incorrect, sir. I'm sorry. They had ads saying tobacco was good for you.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:35.280]  Right. Right. I mean, for years, I knew it was the people, but people inside the industry knew
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:39.440]  it was bad for you. While the medical society's told you, don't worry, it calms you down. If you
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:44.480]  don't feel good, take a cigarette or take the edge off, but inside the tobacco industry, inside the
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:49.200]  walls of Congress, people knew it was bad for you and killing people. I saw studies from 1912
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:53.520]  where they were feeding smoke to rats and killing them with cancers. I mean, they've known this all
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:59.200]  along. Well, look what happens when rats will eat these artificial sugars we put into everything.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:05.840]  Literally, the brain's destroyed. But don't worry, it cuts calories down in your diet soda that also
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:10.960]  takes the calcium out of your bones. Unbelievable. Doc, again, Dr. Corey Gold received his doctorate
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:17.600]  and dental surgery from the University of California, San Francisco in 1988. And prior to that, he
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.600]  received a bachelor's degree in biology with a minor in chemistry from California State University
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:25.680]  Fullerton and received a bachelor's degree in dental science from the University of California,
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:33.120]  San Francisco. And it just goes on. He is the president and co-founder of Projoba International,
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:39.200]  a noted product formulator. And it just goes on from there. He and his wife are the active and
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.280]  supporting children and family struggling with autism and other spectrum disorders. That's why
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:48.320]  I wanted to get him on because this is autism month. We've got about six, seven minutes before we
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:53.920]  go to break here. Dr. Gold, break down this new study that's out and explain to us because I know
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:58.080]  for over a decade you and, of course, Dr. Wallach, who discovered it in his veterinary practice,
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.520]  of course, I've worked for a large animal vet's 25 years ago and they knew it was minerals.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.640]  What's happening when we don't have the minerals and then they add heavy metals on top of it?
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:13.280]  Well, your body is designed to be a self-maintaining system. When it gets the right kind of vitamins,
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:19.280]  minerals, nutrition, it can clear out toxins, it can deal with the sun, it can deal with, you know,
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:24.160]  invaders of bacteria and viruses in a pretty efficient way. I mean, people didn't have a lot
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.960]  of the wonderful things we have medically 100 years ago when they survived the sun and they were
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:34.080]  out all day and people weren't dying of cancer at the age of 30. When we don't get what we need,
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.080]  our body can't function the way it's supposed to function. And one of the things our body's supposed
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:44.080]  to do is clear toxins out of our system. We have created so many more toxins for our body to deal
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:49.520]  with through how we make, for example, you mentioned high fructose corn syrup. Just the process used
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:54.480]  to make high fructose corn syrup is pretty darn scary. And when our body doesn't have its natural
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:26:00.080]  defense systems, it's going to be the brain can't function well. The body has a weakened immune system.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:04.640]  Look how many people have autoimmune disorders. Nobody used to talk about autoimmune disorders
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.080]  50 years ago. Now it seems like everybody has an autoimmune disorder. And that's what allergies
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:15.520]  are as the precursor, correct? Yeah. And you know, nowadays, everybody has an attention deficit
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:19.440]  disorder. Where did that come from when we were kids? Sure, there were a few hyperactive kids,
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:25.040]  but there's only a few. Today, one out of 50 boys has autism spectrum disorders. Today, like,
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:31.440]  was it one out of every five or six kids under the age of 10s obese? What are we doing? And yeah,
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:36.880]  you know, our government says get out there and move. I can't blame them for that. But everything
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:42.560]  else we're doing is poisoning our kids. Well, again, the government will say we're chop your
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:47.440]  legs off. Here's a mandate. And I was being a bit cheeky earlier when I said incorrect.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:52.720]  It isn't just the cigarette maker said the cigarettes aren't bad for you. I was just pointing
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:56.640]  out that you're not exaggerating. In fact, you're doing the opposite. We have TV ads,
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:02.640]  well, old newsreel ads and magazine ads, where even in the 50s, they were telling people it was
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:08.560]  good and I'm a doctor. And what's good for your throat, if it's sore, is a camel filterless or
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.360]  can't. I mean, my point was, doc, it's even worse than you're saying. The cigarette makers were
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:18.720]  saying it's good for you. Well, and then somebody wants to go to a local farm and the local farm
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:23.760]  is told they can't operate or somebody wants to buy milk from a local farmer and they are and they
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:28.720]  can't do that because somehow that's a danger to us. But we'll have Coke machines and Pepsi machines
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:35.840]  on every 100 yards full of high fructose corn syrup. And they're even trying to change the name
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:41.600]  of high fructose corn syrup, just calling it corn syrup, because that sounds like it's good for
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:46.560]  you. So they're trying to just, you can't even have the word GMO. If I want to make a product
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:53.040]  right sound and says contains no GMOs, it's not even legal to do because it would imply that maybe
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.600]  somebody should be concerned about GMOs. Now they want to get rid of the word high fructose corn
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:01.920]  syrup because people might be concerned and look for that on the label. You can't be doing that.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.720]  Well, that's how they change the name of MSG, that I get a violent headache if I eat it. I didn't
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.760]  need experts to tell me that, you know, 20 years ago. And now I'll eat something and I'll say that
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:19.040]  you said no MSG. Oh, but we use the yeast extract. So they're always changing the name.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.840]  Well, it's controlling the language. It's controlling the nomenclature, like I'd say,
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:30.000]  if somebody is pro-abortion, it's pro-choice. And that sounds good on its face, pro-choice. I like
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.480]  people to have choices. You want, you want regular, you want supreme, you want the large coffee or the
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:39.520]  small coffee. So it sounds good on its face, but it's labeling something very different. So it's
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:44.400]  controlling the language. You can't say high fructose corn syrup. Corn syrup, you can't say
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:49.200]  something doesn't contain GMOs because that might raise flags that GMOs might be a challenge. It's
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:54.400]  controlling the language. Listen to when, when President Obama was running, he was talking about
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:59.440]  the most transparent presidency, changing the culture. It's all about language and controlling
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:05.920]  people through language. That's right. Now they're saying in these ads for Obama, I'm in with his
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:11.360]  wife, like you're in the in group and it's all a cynical joke. I mean, I've got to say, is it that
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.560]  Obama's so bad or is it just getting worse because the establishment is getting more out of control?
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:22.400]  I mean, Obama lies at a level that makes Bush and Clinton look tame. It is so amazing.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:28.400]  Well, I always ask myself, is it because that's the way they think the world should be and they're,
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:34.640]  they're protecting us idiots from ourselves? Like, you know, what's next after the healthcare
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:38.240]  mandate they have? They're going to tell you what time you have to go to bed because we're not smart
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:42.320]  enough to know what time to go to bed. We're going to mandate to eat broccoli every third day.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:47.120]  We're going to mandate that you have fish every Friday. We have to tell you what to do because
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.400]  you're not bright enough to make decisions for yourself. Stay there. We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:57.040]  We'll be right back. The empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:05.760]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:10.320]  secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.480]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds have all performed even
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:18.480]  gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:23.680]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:29.680]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:34.160]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:39.360]  any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:48.640]  today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:57.680]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:03.680]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:08.720]  Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions.
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:12.480]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:17.840]  designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:22.880]  Sifaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator. Not only does the Silver Lungs
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:28.080]  System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:33.840]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:41.840]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:49.840]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com

[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:31.120]  By the way, we're going to get into all of the latest on the economy, the TSA, amazing demonization,
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:38.640]  and a posthumous way of Breitbart by NPR. I was really amazed by this report. I heard Friday.
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:45.360]  I did a YouTube video on it. NPR includes Breitbart and Report on Nazis. That's up at infowars.com.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:51.120]  It's just beastial demonization. Talk about word games. Dr. Gold was just talking about it.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:55.760]  It's like Obama had people on MSNBC, which they admit is run by the White House basically,
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:02.400]  along with other George Soros-type groups like Media Matters, and they would have Carlos Watson,
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:08.560]  Slimeball Matthews, and others openly say people don't like government health care because they're
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.800]  racist and don't like black people. Remember those quotes I'd play them? You're like,
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:18.400]  what does that have to do with black people? Oh, sure, racist. And they just say,
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:25.280]  do what we say or we call you racist. And it's a tool that's used over and over again
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:29.600]  when people can't win debates. Now, we'll go to some of your calls coming up here in a few
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:34.000]  minutes. I know they're all over the map, but Dr. Corey Gold's got his own big-time radio show,
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.200]  by the way, and so he can certainly take calls on any subject and health. I just wanted to get
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.160]  him on and have him ride shotgun with us when I saw this article Friday, Study Links Autism with
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:48.720]  Industrial Food and Environmental Toxins. Now, we're an hour and a half into the show and I
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:53.840]  haven't infomercialed anything and we're funded by you, the listeners, but I only promote what I
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:59.200]  believe in. All the time I have health food companies come to me or vitamin companies and say,
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:05.280]  we want a sponsor, we want you to endorse. Just last week, I turned down a huge sponsor
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:09.760]  because I don't have time to try the product and make sure it's really what they say.
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:18.000]  And it just sounded, you know, not like I just fully understood it all. Okay? It took me over a year
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.160]  to really get behind young Jebedee and Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, Rebound, Cell,
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.600]  Shield, C2Q, the Healthy Start, Alex Pack, all of it discounted. You can get free shipping and
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:34.560]  things like that or get discounts when you sign up to be a distributor at infowarsteam.com.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:40.800]  But this Beyond Tangy Tangerine right here is absolutely amazing. In fact,
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:44.480]  if you guys just give me a wide shot here, I literally was back there during the break
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:50.640]  about to have some Tangy Tangerine and that's why I thought, wait, I got Dr. Gold on,
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.840]  I'll just do a plug on air. I was back there during the break
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:59.920]  about to pour this into the water and I went, wait a minute, I'll just do this on air
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:05.840]  because I have become addicted to Beyond Tangy Tangerine. I have become addicted
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:10.720]  instead of coffee. In fact, somebody's don't even drink coffee now. I just have a Pollen Burst
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:14.320]  in the morning, Pollen Burst in the afternoon. I'm going to a movie and I'm tired or something
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:19.520]  with my wife. Seven o'clock at night, Pollen Burst. I mean, coffee gives you that kind of
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:25.280]  sick wide awakeness. And by the way, I drink so much Tangy Tangerine, I don't do the two scoops,
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:29.280]  you know, twice a day, like they say, I end up drinking four glasses a day with one scoop.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.600]  And it has got everything in it.
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:39.600]  Oh, the first time I started drinking it, I didn't like it. And then after I was honored
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.520]  about two weeks, I'm addicted to it. Because I mean, it's real. It's not like just some pink,
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:48.880]  sugary stuff. Doesn't even really taste sweet. And I guess what is it sweet with orange peel and
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:53.920]  stuff? It's just you start getting addicted to it like, like, like people that drink wine every
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:59.120]  day start wanting it like, like me in the past. This stuff is so good. My mother is going to do
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:05.600]  a testimonial. She's reclusive when it comes to media. The guy that my wife uses as a handyman.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:10.880]  He heard about it, did it for like a month and a half, lost 30 something pounds is saying this.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:18.480]  Alex wasn't lying. It's not even, of course I'm not lying. You have to be from another planet
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:23.760]  to not understand that we don't have the minerals in the food because the soil has been played out
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:31.920]  and these toxic fertilizers to allow the plants to grow in most cases. You've got to understand
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.640]  this has the mining 90. They say you only need 70 something minerals. It's got more than that.
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:42.960]  It's got 115 vegetables and fruits, natural antioxidant, great tangy, tangerine taste,
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:46.880]  supports a healthy immune system, supports cardiovascular health, supports a healthy
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:51.840]  digestive system, supports optimal health, gluten free, no artificial sweeters, preservatives,
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:57.360]  low glycemic index, glycemic friendly, promotes healthy blood sugar levels.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:04.320]  And it just goes on and on everything. It's got bigger dosages. It's got 7,500
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:15.280]  IUs of vitamin A, 150%, vitamin C, 1,667 times, 1,667% more than what they say you need each day.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:25.200]  Vitamin D3, 187%, vitamin E, 667%, vitamin K, 38% of the daily, thiamin, 2,000%, riboflavin,
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:33.360]  1,765%, niacin, 200%, vitamin B6, 1,500% more than what the government says you need,
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:40.880]  folate, 100%, vitamin B12, 8,338, whopping succulent percentage points. It's just I can't
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:46.960]  read. Okay. I'm not going to go into a big infomercial here. It's no brag when it's fact,
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.800]  as John Wayne, who wasn't said that note? Guys, look up the quote, no brag, just fact.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.600]  It's no brag, just fact. This is what big brother doesn't want you to have. And they sure don't
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:00.000]  want you to buy it at infowarseteam.com and get the discounts and support us as I hire more
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.160]  reporters, more equipment, more transmission, more battle, more war against the globalist.
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:12.240]  Hmm. I'm telling you, I'm addicted. It is so awesome. Beyond Tangy Tangerine,
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:21.760]  pollen burst, rebound, all of it available at infowars.com. The rebound, the sell, shield,
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:25.920]  RTQ, all of it. There's hundreds of products. I'm just endorsing the ones I've tried, love,
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:31.440]  have had a big effect. So again, infowarseteam.com or give them a call if you've got any questions,
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:38.240]  the infowarseteam members, you can become one of them, 877-551-1301. It's also a great business
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:43.280]  opportunity to become a distributor. My dad's doing it and loving it. My dad, like six months ago,
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.440]  was like, okay, another vitamin thing. He's like, that stuff's incredible. My dad looks younger.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.240]  You know what? People have never heard me hype vitamins and minerals and products like this,
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:56.480]  Dr. Gold. And they're like, why is he doing this? Because it's real. What is different
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:01.200]  with the products you and others have formulated that we have at infowars.com? What is different
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:05.760]  about pollen bursts that you developed? What is different about the Beyonce and Tangerine?
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:10.400]  Why does it work so well? Well, one of the reasons I, well, first off, I tell people one of the
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:15.360]  reasons that you're so successful on the radio is because you're a real person telling a real
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:19.120]  message that's not being told anywhere else. And people gravitate to it. They say, wait a second,
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:23.120]  we're not hearing that anywhere else. It's kind of like that with these products, kind of like,
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:26.400]  wait a second, people aren't quite doing what these people are doing. They're really putting
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:32.080]  those 90 central nutrients into the products. It's not just enough to have the name on the box
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:36.800]  so that people will go buy it. They have the 12 amino acids that people need, the 16 vitamins,
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:42.320]  the 60 minerals, the three omega oils that people are needing to have a really good system.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:46.800]  And I know a lot of people make a lot of hype out there. We don't do that. If people go to our
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:49.920]  website, they're going to say it's a very modest website. We don't want to make a lot of claims.
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:54.480]  We want people to try it themselves and let their body tell them that they love the product.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:58.720]  But when your body is getting the right mix of things, and it used to get so many of these things
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:03.760]  from just eating well, and it's just not in the food today, people are driving through all these
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.760]  drive-throughs. They're drinking all these things with high-fructose corn syrup. They're having all
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:12.960]  these things with MSG and so many other things that the body is just starving for nutrition.
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:16.320]  And then all of a sudden, your body gets the nutrition it needs, and it starts working the
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:21.360]  way it's supposed to work. A lot of what we do is bringing plant-derived minerals to people,
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.400]  so that the minerals are actually coming from a plant source. They're very small. The body
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.000]  recognizes them. They go, wait a second. We haven't seen it for a while. But genetically,
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:35.040]  we know we're supposed to be eating this, and it's in a particle size that the body can utilize and
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:39.120]  get into the cells and start doing the things that they're supposed to do, and the body starts
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:44.560]  operating the way it's supposed to. When people try these products and they do it for two or three
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:49.920]  weeks, they forgot how good they used to feel. They don't wake up feeling the way they used to wake
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:54.400]  up. Why did it taste more bitter to me at first, and now it tastes totally delicious?
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:01.280]  You know, a lot of it is, is just that your body gets used to tasting certain things. It gets addicted
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:06.560]  to certain sweetnesses. If you actually take pasta or bread and chew it for a while versus just eating
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:10.800]  it real fast and swallowing it, you notice there's a sweetness in the bread because it allows the
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:16.560]  natural sugars to come out. Your body is looking for them. Your body's adjusted itself to actually
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:20.960]  enjoying eating vitamins, minerals, and nutrients the way they were supposed to be eating them.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:28.160]  It was confused for a long time by all the chemicals and the neurochemicals put into the other products.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.560]  Well, you're right. You're right about that. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I was going to say, like,
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:40.560]  you know, for example, when you think of MSG, MSG is a neurotoxin. MSG is designed to excite,
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:47.040]  is an exciting chemical to your brain. It's made to, it's put in there to make you taste something
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:52.560]  that's yucky, tasting good. It's meant to fool you. And that's why MSG is in so many things,
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.120]  and it kind of poisons your brain to some degree. And that's why so many people say,
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.040]  I don't want MSG as my food. I don't feel good when I take it. I kind of feel
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:04.960]  queasy or whiteheaded when I take it. You mentioned coffee. I happen to enjoy a cup of
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:08.480]  coffee each day. But a lot of people say, I don't really feel good when I take certain things.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:13.200]  Your body is telling you things. We stopped listening to our bodies a while back. But luckily,
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:17.440]  guys like Dr. Joe Wallach, you mentioned it earlier. Peter Glidden, I know, has been on your show
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:23.520]  before. Ben Fuchs has been on. You know, Mike Adams. I read so many articles by Mike Adams last
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:26.960]  night. I was just so impressed with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger. And they started talking to
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.280]  about what your body is supposed to be doing. And all you have to do is give it the minerals,
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:36.080]  give it the amino acids, the vitamins, the omega oils, and it will do amazing things to
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:40.800]  go back to the way it used to be. You look at kids today. My daughter happens to be a tennis
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:45.920]  player and she's in great shape and she runs around. When we were kids, everybody ran around the
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:50.640]  neighborhood and ran around the parks, had a great time, had plenty of energy. Today, kids get tired
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:55.200]  like in 10 minutes. It's like they want to go inside and play Game Boy. When I was a child,
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:44:01.520]  I ran around barefoot, especially in the summer when I wasn't in school. From the time I got up
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:07.680]  in the morning until nighttime with scrapes all over me and like some wild hyena. And now I look
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:12.960]  at children and they're like, I don't want to do anything. And we had television. We had white bread.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:18.800]  We had all that. It's so poisonous now. The GMO and the rest of it, they're like jellyfish. I used
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:24.240]  to get up early just so me and my friends could play in the woods for an hour or so. Then I'd run
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:28.720]  in and grab some breakfast and jump on the school bus. It's totally different. And by the way,
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:34.080]  I did find the quote, it was William Brennan in a Western said, no brag, just fact. And again,
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:39.280]  I hear rebroadcast of when I have a guest on about nutrition like you, Dr. Gold. And I sound like
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:43.680]  this frothing carnival barker person. And I'm like, I shouldn't sound like that when I pitch
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:49.360]  something. But the problem is barkers are trying to act like they really believe in something.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:55.760]  With me, I'm excited because I've lost 40 plus pounds. I can suddenly jog five, six miles when
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:00.800]  used to I couldn't go more than two or three miles. I'm suddenly able to lose weight and eat
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:06.800]  basically the same stuff I was. I feel so much better. My mind is so much clearer. I can work
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:11.200]  longer hours. I don't need that second and third cup of coffee. Then gives me a weird
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:15.840]  headache, a lake when I take the pollen burst. Tell us, tell us what's in pollen burst also
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:21.440]  available at info wars team.com. Well, pollen burst is another product that starts with plant
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:26.480]  derived minerals. So you're getting those minerals and that's your body is looking for trace minerals.
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.160]  And I know people sometimes, you know, they say, well, do I want zinc? Your body needs zinc in
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:35.600]  small amounts. Do I want these, these minerals? Your body is looking for them and trace amounts.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:39.920]  And then in addition to that, you have your vitamin A, your B vitamins, you have your,
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.360]  your, your D vitamins, and you have green tea extracts in there. And then you have natural plant,
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:49.280]  you know, when people start talking about, well, I'm not sure I want that. It has orange peel in it.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:54.400]  It has orange has mango. Your body is looking for vitamins coming from natural plant sources.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:59.920]  So when it's getting plant derived minerals, when it's getting vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C,
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:05.200]  vitamin D from natural plant sources, you know, when it's getting green tea extracts,
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:09.200]  it's going to, it's going to work well. And I got to tell you one thing I'm really proud
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:14.080]  about with pollen burst is that it tastes great. So people actually enjoy getting healthy. And
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:18.080]  that's really important because when kids will take it, when my dad will drink it, you know,
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:23.280]  it's got to be tasting pretty good. And we can start introducing people to better health without
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:28.640]  them feeling like it's a punishment. And people have to stop pretending that somebody else is
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:33.600]  in charge of their body. You know, it's not like you take your car in and you get it worked on,
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.800]  like, well, we need to replace your carburetor. People just think of their body like it's a car
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:42.160]  and they're going to take it into these other people like doctors and they're responsible for
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:46.560]  their vehicle. You've got to take, start taking a lot more responsibility for your vehicle called
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.360]  your body and start treating it a lot better. I know people who take better car, their carpet,
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:56.480]  then they take care of their body. And well, this cost only 99 cents at this fast food restaurant.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.120]  Oh my God, what could they put in it for 99 cents? I pay 99 cents not to eat it.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:08.320]  Again, Dr. Gold very well said, I hope people will check out infowarsteam.com.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:14.160]  And again, because the solution is there, I just read the study where, you know, for people on
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:20.960]  air here and just covered it where they're saying there's heavy metals in the high fructose corn
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:27.280]  syrup and corn syrup. They are building in the body and then we don't have enough minerals and
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:32.720]  regular vitamins and things that are used to strip that out of the body. So it's a double whammy.
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:36.960]  In fact, guys, people won't believe it. It was in the Washington Post like three years ago.
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:45.760]  Type in half of corn syrup has lead. And then you can also find one where half has mercury.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:50.880]  And again, it's the manufacturing of this. How do they make it? I mean, how do they get away with
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:56.720]  this doc? I don't know. I mean, people say, Corey, you're exaggerating. I don't know. When I was a
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:00.800]  kid, we used to use certain kinds of paints and you'd have to dip the paintbrush like in
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:04.800]  turpentine to clean and you get your hand with a little turpentine in it and your hand and your
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:08.560]  whole body would feel weird when you stuck got some turpentine on it. So things we put into
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.200]  our body, even on our skin, get inside our system and they make these different things like high
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:18.720]  fructose corn syrup and they have to use all these toxic chemicals to make it. How do you think they
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:23.440]  get it all out when they try to make it? When they use toxic chemicals to make something,
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.520]  it's not surprising that some of it would be in there when you finally put it into your body.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:31.840]  And if your body can't clear heavy metals out of its system, a lot of those heavy metals find
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:37.440]  their way into your brain and you almost like you're sleeping or you're kind of fuzzy and you
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:42.000]  multiply that day after day, week after week, month after month, especially with a small infantile
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:49.360]  brain as a child develops or a mother when she's having a child in utero and we're setting up that
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:54.560]  brain not to function right. I mean, somebody's got to be asking themselves, how do we have one
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:01.600]  out of every 50, 55 boys being born today having autism spectrum and nobody's asking or very few
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:06.720]  people are asking why is it that used to be one out of thousands and now we're at one out of 50?
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:11.440]  Something's different. No, no, you're absolutely right. Let's expand on that and then come back
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:17.920]  as we're taking some calls here. People like Daniel in New York listening on WASB 1590 AM,
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:24.000]  an affiliate we've had for about 12 years, great folks up there, expanding on that. I remember
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:30.480]  reading studies in the 90s about HIV and why drug users, illegal drug users were getting
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.960]  into such higher levels, not just the needles, but that they were getting autoimmune disorders and
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:42.000]  were more receptive to the virus, being able to attack them because they were using methamphetamine
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.040]  in things and because the precursors were controlled, the chemists have to get a bunch of
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:52.400]  ingredients and they don't separate all the toxins and heavy metals in grignard reagents out
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:56.800]  and then that basically destroys their T lymphocytes, the toxins, the heavy metals
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.120]  and then they basically have no immune system. Well, that's what we're seeing in the general
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:07.360]  public. The general public has the neurological disorders and other disorders that drug addicts
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:13.520]  that take dirty speed have and I mean, it's very simple. Our culture is in deep trouble.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:20.880]  It's like the Romans lining their, their jugs, their clay jugs with lead and it leaching in.
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:24.240]  They didn't know. Well, we do know we need to stop it.
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:29.520]  You're absolutely right. I mean, take it to the most basic level. A lot of times when somebody's
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:33.920]  totally run down, they've been working nonstop for a week or two, they're not sleeping well and they
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:38.320]  go, oh my goodness, I just got a cold. Surprise, surprise, you got sick. Your body was completely
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:42.800]  run down. It was malnourished. You weren't getting good food. You weren't getting good rest. You
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:46.960]  weren't getting good exercise. You were never de-stressing at all and surprise, surprise,
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:52.000]  you got sick. Do that for years or generations and all of a sudden everybody's getting autoimmune
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:57.760]  disorders. Everybody's getting on early onset diabetes, early onset issues with that. They used
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:01.920]  to get, somebody used to get dementia in the 80s and 90s. Now they're getting in the 50s. People
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:08.000]  can't remember in the 40s. Diesel owners had enough of hard starts, poor fuel mileage and poor
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.040]  performance. The cause is stiction. A gummy residue that clings to injectors like cholesterol
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:18.240]  clings to arteries. Stiction robs your diesel engine of power, performance and gas mileage.
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:24.160]  The answer, hot shot secret. This is Lee from Minnesota. I have a F350 with a 6-0 diesel. I
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:28.560]  had many injector problems and heart starting problems. After I added hot shot secret, it now
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:33.040]  starts better, feels stronger and my mileage went up two miles per gallon. I recommend hot shot
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:39.680]  secret to anyone with a diesel engine. Hot shot secret, the only oil additive engineered to remove
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:45.280]  stiction in all diesel engines. Clean from the inside out with hot shot secret. Available
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:55.520]  nationwide at all tractor supply stores or call 800-341-6516. That's 800-341-6516 or go to
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:52:04.720]  hotshotssecret.com. Hot shot secret, powered by science. That's what it sounds like when a burglar
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:09.600]  kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home. Don't let your home be the next
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:14.960]  target. Make it look like someone is home watching television with fake TV. Fake TV is a small
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:19.760]  electronic device that makes the same light as a real television. So from outside it looks like
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:24.720]  someone is home watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer but is far more
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:30.640]  convincing to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm and is highly recommended
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:35.840]  by numerous police departments. Use it anytime you're away from home. To order your fake TV for
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:45.520]  only 34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5 FAKE TV. Each additional fake TV is only 29.95.
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:50.640]  So get one for you and one for a loved one or safety, security and peace of mind for both of
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:59.680]  you. Call 877-5 F-A-K-E-T-V or go to faketv.com, faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.

[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:16.240]  this right now because this can really hurt the new world order. When we thrive, when humanity does
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:24.720]  well, when we have knowledge, we don't perish. If you go back 300 years ago or so, the Spanish,
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:31.680]  the French, the Dutch, nobody knew that you needed vitamin C. They didn't know what vitamin C was.
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:36.720]  And by the time your ship was three, four thousand miles away, all the fresh fruit was gone.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:42.080]  You're eating hard tack and salt pork. The men, old cuts, if you'd cut your arm bad when you were
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:47.360]  a kid, it would open back up. Sores, you couldn't walk, you get a cold, you'd fall over dead.
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:53.040]  Remember seeing statistics about half the slaves they bring over would die on those
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:59.360]  coffin ships from West Africa to the Americas and the Caribbean until I read deeper and learned
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:04.640]  on an average mission more than 30 percent, in some cases whole ships would die, would die of
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:09.600]  what they call yellow fever and things going into Africa. And it was because they were so
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:15.360]  debilitated and the men were pressed. They were slaves on the ships to go get black slaves.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:21.120]  That's why most of them started going pirate because that was better than just dying of malaria
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:27.120]  and side issue. History is very, very interesting. A lot of times they would mutiny and refute over
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:30.560]  the treatment of the blacks. So you're never taught that there were always good people.
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:36.880]  But the point is, is that then the, what was it about 300 years ago or so, but they kept it a
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:45.200]  national secret. The scientists in England discovered that there was something in fresh fruit
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:48.960]  that would keep their soldiers and everybody totally healthy. That's why they got the name
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:53.760]  limies. Cause the men didn't want to swim, didn't want to clean. They had all these old wives tell
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:59.200]  things. They wouldn't, let me repeat this, they wouldn't eat fresh vegetables most of the time.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:04.560]  They thought they were bad for you. I'm not joking. And so they would say, you want your daily payment
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:10.560]  of grog that is what, one part rum, two parts water. That was the water they were given was alcohol.
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:16.960]  They would put the little key limes, the little, I love those little suckers, love the pies they
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:22.800]  make. They would put them into the grog. And then that's where everybody called them limies.
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:27.360]  You call Germans the derogatory term on the watch, derogatory crowds,
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:31.520]  cause they eat sauerkraut or somebody who's got, you know, the name, you know,
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:35.120]  Mick, cause they're from a certain area. They call them that. Well, that's why you call the Irish,
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:42.800]  not the Irish, the Brits were called limies because their ships would have the limes on them.
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:48.320]  That's all I'm saying here. I mean, just, just getting mega dosages of vitamin C is going to do
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:53.280]  a lot for you in fall wars team.com. We're, we're about to go to break. I promise I'm coming back
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:57.840]  to all your calls on a host of issues. It'll be all over the map with Dr. Corey Gold here.
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:00.960]  But doc is my point about scurvy, a good one for people.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:07.600]  It was probably the first documented time where people connected helping a disease,
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:11.360]  actually curing or preventing a disease with food and that you could have a lime,
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:14.640]  you could have an orange, you could have a tangerine and people didn't get a disease.
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:18.000]  You took that away from them. They got the disease. Simple connection A to B.
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:23.520]  And the British Empire in the next 200 years became dominant because everybody else laughed at them
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:27.280]  with the limes and the Brits didn't say why they were doing it because nobody told them.
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:32.480]  The guys on the ship didn't know why. Can you believe the British Empire was able to take over
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:38.080]  because of limes? Well, sometimes simple things make a big difference. If your army can withstand
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:42.000]  cold weather better, you're going to do better. If your army can stand being out in the field
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.320]  longer, you're going to do better. And why they've used salt peter in periods of times,
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:52.080]  why they put fluoride in waters in prison camps, they're trying to control the population. Why
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:55.280]  do they allow some people to learn how to read and not allow other people to read controlling
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:58:00.480]  information? But you're right. What people are fed, that's why in a lot of countries, look at
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:05.600]  North Korea now, the only people who are fed well are the soldiers. They feed them, they don't feed
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:10.240]  the other people. And then nobody can raise their hand against them. I've talked to troops that are
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:14.960]  in Iraq, and they talk about how debilitated the Iraqis are from Mount Neurixmen, and that's why
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:20.320]  they can't really fight. I mean, it is amazing. We're going to take some calls, then I want to
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:26.240]  get into food as a weapon. The UN talks about it. Your food's been adulterated, all of it by design,
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:32.720]  plus all these toxins are addictive, just like arsenic becomes addictive. We're being poisoned
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:38.640]  by design. We'll be right back. Don't forget the website infowarsteam.com. Get healthy today.

[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:56.160]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights and
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:01.680]  jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:07.280]  as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:13.040]  eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products at infowarsteam.com,
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:20.480]  but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:26.800]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:32.160]  Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months. Now,
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:39.040]  that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarsteam.com and to order just three
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:44.640]  of their products. And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite

[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:27.120]  All right, Dr. Corey Gold is our guest. I might just keep an old whole rest of the hour if he can
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:31.200]  do it. I got a bunch of news I want to throw at him. He's his talk show host in his own right.
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:36.400]  Very interesting, very smart fellow. We got loaded phones after I take five or six that have been
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:42.080]  on hold. Then it can be some questions for him on nutrition and his research. I got a bunch of
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:45.680]  points he wants to get to that I haven't even covered yet because I said, hey, what are some of
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:50.800]  the things that are hottest on your radar? What will I get to that? But I get back to this whole
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:55.520]  thing of the scurvy. It's like the Limes. For hundreds of years, the British scientists knew
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:01:00.240]  that's why their soldiers could be 8,000 miles from home, pull up to another ship from Spain or
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:04.880]  France and kick their hind in because usually the other sailors and soldiers, the Marines,
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:09.840]  the Dragoons, couldn't even get up off the deck. I've read these naval histories. They're so
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:15.120]  interesting. It was the British secret weapon and the other governments just stayed in their ways
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:20.560]  and laughed at them. They weren't asking why are their people fresh thousands of miles away from
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:27.040]  home and not dying like ours from disease. It's amazing. We'll get to it later. It just blows
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:32.480]  me away, Doc. Well, food's been used as a weapon for a long time. Troops have always been fed much
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:36.560]  better than the general population. When you're controlling the population with a small number
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:40.640]  of people, you want them to be the strongest and you want them to be the most loyal. They're loyal
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:44.400]  to them because you feed them. We're kind of running like that in America right now with so
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:49.520]  many people on food supply by the government, I mean free food by the government. When the
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:54.480]  government's responsible for the foods you eat, the water you drink, the school you go to, your
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:59.120]  home loan, your car loan, your job, nobody questions the government too much. Otherwise,
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:04.320]  you don't eat and drink. Wow. Wow. We'll get back into that after calls. Very powerful point.
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:10.080]  Daniel in New York, listening on WASB, 1590 a.m. Welcome, sir.
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:15.600]  Thank you. A minor correction. It's actually WRSB-1310 out of...
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:20.160]  I knew it was WRSB. I don't know why. When I read that, I thought it looked wrong. But hey,
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:23.600]  we've got to get things wrong here. It's important we do that.
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:30.880]  Anyway, I've listened to you since something like 1998. The Lindenrush organization first
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:37.600]  will work me up to the eugenics agenda in late 77. Hey, wait a minute. I know why we got it wrong
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:41.680]  because there's another station that carries us, the sister station. Yeah, it's exactly that.
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:45.200]  Okay. Well, we really didn't get it wrong then. But anyways, I apologize. Go ahead and make your
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:51.040]  point. Right. But I can't get the station out of Brockport. It's too far away. Go ahead. Anyway,
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:59.680]  I've got three points. The first point is fast and furious. We can't stop at the
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:06.400]  demonization of the Second Amendment being the cause for it. Because if you look at it a little
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:14.720]  further, the real reason is, I think, so that the Mexican drug cartels can take over chunks of the
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:28.480]  southwestern border states. If the guns are coming in and being used to take certain areas of Arizona
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:35.520]  and New Mexico and such over, it's really constitutionally defined treason, which is a very rare
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:42.240]  bird. Now, to prove it, what people need to do is to connect the guns at the locations
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:52.160]  where they have taken over in the border states. I think we might look at a much larger scandal
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:56.560]  than simply demonizing the Second Amendment.
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:01.920]  No, I thought it's about destabilization the entire region. We'll get Corey's take on that
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:09.760]  after the break. But what's your other points? Well, another point is Paul Joseph Watson,
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:14.720]  who's been having all sorts of ailments and such from dealing with the British medical
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:21.280]  establishment and their ineffective ways. I know I'm trying to get him on me on Tangier
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:27.760]  Reign, but go ahead. Yeah, but if you hook him up to your health experts.
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:33.600]  I know that's something I've overlooked. Well, he's over in England. Listen, Watson's not sickly.
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:38.320]  He exercises all the time. He got a chest cold and for over a month couldn't get in to see the
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:41.360]  health service. Then he wanted to go to a specialist because they tried to give him some
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:45.680]  Tylenol, basically, and they wouldn't even let him go see a regular doctor. So the point is,
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:50.640]  you can't get to see the doctor in England because it's socialist, eugenicist, murder care.
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:55.440]  So I don't want the idea that Watson's like this snot nose, you know, person who's in bad shape.
[02:04:55.440 --> 02:05:00.080]  He got a bad cold and can't even find out what it is because there's no healthcare in England.
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:07.040]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:13.360]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:22.080]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:28.640]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:34.560]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:40.240]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.

[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:53.600]  degrees in biology and other areas and he is one of the top nutritional formulators in the country.
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:59.440]  When I say that you can check him out. Dr. Corey Gold joins us via video skype. I'm just inviting
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:03.920]  to stay the whole rest of the hour to cover other news items and take your phone calls.
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:08.320]  But there's also some other points I want to get to with him on Codex Alimentarius
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:12.560]  and the Food and Drug Administration trying to block people even getting vitamin C now.
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:16.720]  People didn't believe that could happen. Europe is now starting this up. This is really
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:20.880]  going on. Who would have thought I'm going to go back to calls but let me ask you this Corey.
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:26.080]  Who would have thought that they'd be shutting down most of the public land 80 plus percent
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:31.920]  of the land is public out west where you live and shutting down parts of national parks and
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:41.040]  saying no vehicles, no humans, no pets, no kites, no fishing, no horse riding and they're shutting
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:45.440]  down all these big famous national parks, shutting down part of it to human access,
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:52.320]  saying no cars. This is all Agenda 21. On top of that UN seeks new powers to remake world at
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:58.160]  Rio Sustainability Summit. Here is another one where they're using spy satellites in the U.S.
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:05.920]  and Europe to spy on people new big brother satellite to hunt down carbon criminals. I mean
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:11.760]  all of this is going on doc. What do you what do you make of the fact that you know we had this
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:17.920]  Forbes writer last week call for marking people that are climate change skeptics and where we
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:24.800]  live and then burning our houses down or taking our property from us. There's such open authoritarians
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:32.160]  or NPR doing a report on Nazis and Hitler and then including Breitbart and saying he's a bad
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:36.640]  journalist like them. I mean just I don't know if you heard that but it was bizarre.
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:41.680]  Well there's so many topics in there back to Fast and Furious where the last caller was for a
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:46.400]  second. Think about this if I was to give a gun to somebody knowing they were going to use it in
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:52.880]  a crime I would go to jail for aiding and abetting a murder and our government gave hundreds if not
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:58.880]  thousands of weapons to people who they knew would kill other people with no way of tracking at all
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:04.880]  and that's all for our safety. If you and I were to do the exact same thing even with good intentions
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:10.720]  we'd all go to jail and yet I don't hear it in the news anymore. We have a U.S. government taking
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:16.880]  tax dollars buying semiotic weapons giving them to gangsters and criminals even killing Americans
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:21.680]  with those weapons and somehow you know they had to do the Justice Department still and still
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:26.560]  unseated. I can't even imagine that this would go on and if you were just to give one gun to
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:30.800]  somebody knowing you'd go to a murder we'd go to jail but if the government does it it's considered
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:36.640]  to be a good good thought. In California here there is an entire central California knows the
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:40.560]  bread basket of the United States where they grow so much fruits and vegetables and they've been
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:44.800]  shutting the water off to farmers meaning that people are losing their jobs people losing their
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:51.280]  farms they're having to get crops from other places because there's a non-native fish that's
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:55.920]  in the aqueduct and it might get hurt by the turbines. And again think of the precedent this
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:12:00.480]  has been going on a decade now at Klamath Falls and Southern Oregon all of it huge lakes full of
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:07.600]  water huge aquifers shut them off for a sucker fish that doesn't even isn't even from there that is
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:13.840]  a new so they'll claim something's invasive and take property or then it isn't invasive it's just
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:18.240]  amazing go ahead. Well I mean literally there's ranches I mean we used to get these wonderful
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:22.320]  fruits and vegetables right from the Central Valley and now people are losing their farms
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:28.800]  because they can't get water and the water's there but they decided to prioritize a non-native fish
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:34.000]  versus the people who live there and have lived there for generations and decades
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.120]  and all the people who gain livelihood there's 20 percent employment in that area because people
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:44.080]  used to have jobs based upon the farms those farms are gone we still need to eat food so now
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:48.800]  we're going to get food from someplace else and it has to be trucked in and boated in and
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:53.920]  airplane in like that's somehow better to take food from South America that takes all this
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:58.720]  pollution to get here it doesn't even have no no no that's the thing in the next why go crazy in
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:04.400]  the name of sustainability they're harassing backyard gardens front yard gardens that are
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:12.080]  Amish uh big ag war rights the rules it's not it's to shut everybody down and and folks it's
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:17.840]  beautiful farmland all over california the people can't get water for grapes now they can't it's
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:23.360]  killing everything and government doesn't care if 50 000 people come out and protest in a small
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:29.280]  town from all the other towns they don't care it's about a raw exercise of power california knew
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.480]  when they passed a 20 plus percent yearly carbon tax that would just make people leave the state
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:41.440]  they don't care because the globalists have said they want a post industrial world they want to shut
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:47.520]  things down they're diabolical your take dr. gold on gen 21 well you have to wonder where it's all
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:52.480]  heading you know i love it here in california i live in california i happen to know it's a beautiful
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:57.680]  place my family's from here and yet we're getting most of our you know oil and other things from
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:02.160]  other parts of the world like somehow it's not polluting when they get it from from the middle
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:06.240]  east somehow it's not dangerous when they bring it forward in these ships to the united states
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:10.720]  because gosh forbid we drill it here they're closing down factories here in the united states
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:14.880]  because of pollution standards and we're still buying that same product but it's made in china
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:19.680]  where the pollution standards don't even exist so three times the pollution created to get the same
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:25.040]  product here but and then it's because the globalists are all invested in china and mexico
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:30.800]  it's simple they shut down their competition to increase their overall bottom line things
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:35.680]  implode here they come back with our money china our biggest creditor and buy everything up it's
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:40.880]  a very simple equation what do you make of the detroit news reporting gm to build the new cadillacs
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:47.200]  in china and our bailout money went to build the new factory i'm not really surprised uh you know
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:51.920]  that we're moving manufacturing capacity off out of the united states that used to be what made
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:56.640]  america so powerful we were the economic engine of the world because we manufactured the best of
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:02.560]  the best and after world war two after germany and japan had been you know pretty much flattened
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:08.400]  america had the industrial capacity we've voluntarily laid down our industrial capacity
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:14.560]  now we have to import even things like steel we used to own the steel industry now we have to
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:20.400]  import steel and ask people to send us steel we are now weak because of that because we depend
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:24.720]  upon other countries for what we used to do ourselves well they spin it too they're also
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:29.040]  building the vault there and they say oh that will protect the technology no they'll have the
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:33.360]  factories and build one right next to it and again it's not that all the chinese people to do well
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:38.240]  the chinese communist government made a deal with the globalists to team up and bring in this new
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:43.520]  world order and that's the truth the globalist or ally with china i'm not fans of what russia
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:49.360]  does but notice now china just came out and is backing attacks on syria let me raise that point
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:54.720]  what do you make of al qaeda being in the news openly working for the west attacking muammar
[02:15:54.720 --> 02:16:01.760]  qaddafi and now attacking the the people in syria i mean that really adds a lot of credence to
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:05.840]  what i've been pointing out about this being synthetic manufactured terror doc well then the
[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:10.000]  muji hadin used to be our friends when they were fighting the russians in afghanistan
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:14.080]  i mean those are the people we supplied with arms to defeat the russians now they're the people
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:19.120]  basically fighting the americans in afghanistan so it's it's it's you have to kind of look at what
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:23.600]  uniforms they have on those are the people we were rooting for when it was the bad russians over
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:27.920]  there now that's the americans over there and i'm not upset at the american troops i mean they go
[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:31.680]  where they're told to go the average person in the listing you know they want to do the right thing
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:36.640]  for america they go where they're told to go and god bless them but the people sending them there
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:42.000]  they're now being attacked by the same muji hadin people that used to be our friends no it's absolutely
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:48.080]  ridiculous the point is this whole war on terrorism hoax is being used to take our freedoms phil in
[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:53.840]  new jersey thanks for holding then we'll go to ivel and others go ahead phil hey alex how you doing
[02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:59.440]  good hey uh you know i was i'm not sure if it was a friday's episode with uh mike adams the health
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:05.680]  ranger um talking about ammunition and uh yeah i don't know he did a superlative i listened to it
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:10.800]  i'm like man this god is just giving my show does a better job than i do uh mike sat in yesterday
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:15.440]  and did a great job on the sunday show okay well not not to discredit him he did have
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:19.280]  he did a great job i just wanted to kind of bring the light that there are some agencies here in the
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:26.400]  united states uh that do use um the hollow points to call the hydro shock rounds and that magnet as a
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:31.040]  matter of fact um you have to you have to train on those and qualify in those rounds in order to go
[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:36.720]  downrange and work for certain no i know i i know that a lot of agencies have hollow points my point
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:42.160]  is the government's buying armored pill boxes hundreds of millions of rounds of ammo agencies
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:46.320]  have never been armed before buying shotguns uh they're having the department of education
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:51.680]  swat team people they're having i saw an article yesterday where they're having uh debtors prisons
[02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:59.120]  now i mean that's illegal uh your take uh on uh that uh dr gold the federal government arming
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:04.960]  against the american people well you know a posse comatatus you're not supposed to be doing that
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:10.080]  but it seems like now there's all these cooperation drills i remember when it was brought in what for
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:14.880]  the uh was it the wasn't the olympic so super bowl that the that the army would be involved with
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:20.480]  security now and the super bowl and other things is slowly dripping upon us now that the army in
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:26.160]  the united states is a normal thing and they're here to help us uh caller what else do you want
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:32.560]  to point out about um the issue of the government arming up against us well you know it's kind of
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:38.720]  funny you you segue into that i just i work for a company and uh who remain anonymous that we just
[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:45.440]  got word that ammunition is going to rise between 15 and 20 and we're only allowed to get quotes up
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:51.360]  to two weeks out that means that they think they're not going to be able to handle the supply in the
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:58.320]  future uh well it's not so much the supply but where's the supply going so it whenever you
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:03.200]  like for somebody like myself if i want to go online and purchase ammo as a you know a private
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:09.520]  purchase um the ammo is getting redistributed distributed somewhere else so they're just
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:16.000]  the the price that's going up 15 20 percent and i bought a you know a bunch of ammo back in january
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.880]  and i went back three weeks later the price for the purchase that i would have done would have
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:26.240]  20 rounds per box of what i uh purchased back three weeks prior to that so now that now the
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:32.160]  distributors just distributors are giving us uh information back saying we'll only keep these
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:36.880]  quotes for two weeks so you need to make a purchase or yeah it's amazing the gun bubble

[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:04.640]  them for wars dot com ron paul slams internet control bill syspa by steve watson we ought to
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:08.800]  add my video from last week to that it was a powerful video but didn't get any views also

[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:27.120]  continuing new big brother satellite to hunt down carbon criminals already mentioned that
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:32.480]  curtain emma showed me an article about satellites this is out of space dot com
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:39.360]  and yahoo news huge mysterious satellite silent satellite spotted by another spacecraft it's the
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:45.040]  size of a school bus just mysteriously floating around well the e who's launching lots of new
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:49.280]  spy satellites with the general public just all part of them using our money to enslave us
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:54.320]  as the curtain emma said when he handed me the article he said well that's that's money well spent
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:26:00.000]  more just taxpayer money by the control freaks but but getting into this gun bubble a lot of
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:05.760]  big brokerage firms are involved in it now we're seeing five million guns sold a month the previous
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:10.640]  record was like two million you're seeing people say they don't trust the government that's a pretty
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:18.800]  pretty big no confidence vote on the government cori what's your take on it they go ahead if the
[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:22.640]  polls look like obama is going to win again you're going to watch it accelerate and accelerate
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:27.760]  and accelerate people really think it's a second second administration he's going to really cut down
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:33.200]  on the access to guns watch what happens with this whole trayvon martin situation they're going to
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:44.880]  use that as part of that as well expand on where you see all this going well i can see it such that
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:49.920]  they want to have the public having less access to guns i mean if you listen to harry clinton she
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:55.120]  wants less access to guns you listen to most people the gun is the evil part you know they can have
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:59.840]  all the guns in the world you know they have all the gun laws in the world in mexico it's not the
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:04.000]  good people that are hurting people occasionally a good person will do something silly with a gun
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.800]  because they're not trained or they get scared that's the minority of situations bad people will
[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:15.120]  find guns if they want to find guns so taking guns away does not really help the average person
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:19.600]  look what happened in nazi germany one of the very first things they did was disarm the public
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:24.480]  there's there's a couple things that we have in america right now one is is that the more and more
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:30.080]  the middle class disappears the less power is in the hands of the average person because the people
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:35.120]  with less economics are dependent upon the government for food dependent on the government for housing
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:39.520]  dependent on the government for education dependent on the government for medical care dependent on
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:43.520]  the government for most every and they only choose them as weapons against the middle class right
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:49.280]  it's a class warfare situation the middle class in america used to have extra income and extra money
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:54.240]  so they could support good candidates they could support good causes they could take time to protest
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:28:01.360]  things they didn't like in society with less and less people having disposable income and time and
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:06.000]  we're also told to turn away from those items because they're too big for us they used to be
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:11.280]  local items now everything's a national item so it's so far away from you that you really can't
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:17.040]  deal with it and now we've all these distractions between sports and tv and other things that
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:23.200]  people are told it's just too big a problem disenfranchised deindustrialized kicked off the
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:30.960]  land it is a strategic globalist takeover program of dependence and when people do protest like
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:36.000]  as they use the tea party for example they're told they're racist they're told they're backwards
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:41.280]  they're told they're you know you know bible hugging individuals they're narrow minded they
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:46.640]  they want you know bad things to happen to other groups of people so when people do get together
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:51.200]  just simply to say we don't like the direction the government's going they're demonized they're
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:56.480]  called names they're told that they're stupid and backwards and people who say that population
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:02.880]  control is good that one child policies are good that people you know shouldn't drive cars are good
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:07.200]  that we are killing the world that's a you know you should look what they're teaching our children
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:12.560]  today that's considered to be elite in fact i think they're trying to take you know god out of
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:19.200]  everything because government's becoming god i think you've hit the core of it that is what the
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:24.480]  new world order is we have a clip in jason berness's film visible empire we're on c-span
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:28.800]  they're having a globalist meeting and they say the new world order is the definition is the state
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:36.240]  is god more for phone calls coming up after this quick break we'll also get into some other health

[02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:05.680]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:10.880]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:15.760]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:21.360]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:26.400]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:31.920]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:36.320]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:41.840]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:45.920]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my

[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:11.120]  weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:16.960]  elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as i had that i immediately could eat half of what i
[02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:22.400]  was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at info wars team

[02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:36.320]  i mentioned this in the middle of the last hour and i so i thought i'd
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:40.720]  briefly go over it and then into some other health news and the rest of your phone calls
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:47.040]  study finds high fructose corn syrup contains mercury this is out of the washington post january
[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:54.080]  28 2009 almost half of tested samples of commercial high fructose corn syrup contained mercury
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:34:01.840]  you can also find it with lead which was also found in nearly a third of 55 popular brand name food
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:07.840]  and beverage products with high fructose corn syrup in the first or second highest labeled ingredient
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:14.400]  according to two new us studies and it goes into the fact that it was very high levels of mercury
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:25.520]  folks this absolutely continuing here hfcs's has replaced sugar as the sweetener in many beverages
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:32.320]  folks when mike adams has done this here on air you can go to the baby store and get major brands
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:41.280]  all the major brands of formula oh it's formula it's high tech and it'll be 45 high fructose
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:46.160]  corn syrup and then another 10 sugar and then some i mean some of them are over 70 sugar
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:56.960]  deadly toxic sugars bad enough with process sugar with mercury with lead which is in the i mean
[02:34:56.960 --> 02:35:00.880]  folks you might as well just throw the child off a 10-story building i'm not saying literally do
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:06.080]  that by the way people are actually on all these heavy metals they'll believe it we say it's like
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:12.320]  the public or zombies they are and you look at neurological disorders straight up cancer straight
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:22.400]  up diabetes straight up organ failure so i mean they this is huge and that's why then years ago i
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:26.000]  tried different vitamins and stuff at the regular store it's all crud just goes right through you
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.400]  then i finally found dr walloch who'd been a veterinarian and then also had some other
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:36.080]  medical degrees and the point is he was saying everything i knew from the large animal vet i
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:42.240]  worked for jess adkins in freestone county east texas because you know i got in trouble at
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:46.960]  hospital and they sent me down there for much of a year and one of those guys work hard but the
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:52.240]  point is is that he was a large animal that still works great vet by the way if you can come see
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:58.560]  he's so busy and and it was all about minerals and he'd come out and check a herd and do this a
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:03.040]  cow sheep and he'd say you need to give them this mineral and this feed and yeah and you know
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:07.680]  he'd look at them um they need this and he was just oh everybody loved him because he was well
[02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:14.080]  top of his class and a and m but also he was you know the real deal and it was all about of course
[02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:19.040]  up north i later researched the cows freeze to death if they haven't gotten the proper minerals
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:24.640]  i mean real veterinary science especially on an industrial level is all about this the system
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:30.480]  sees us as animals and is taking what we need minerals when you get the full spectrum of the
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:36.880]  trace elements that's what the studies are showing they help pull the toxins out do you understand
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:41.280]  that it's not just that you need these for your body they pull the other stuff and they fill up
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:48.400]  the glands they fill up the biological space where the toxins would go so you need these in
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:53.440]  the receptors it's very simple it's like it's like the thyroid in layman's terms when there's
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:59.040]  different radioactive isotopes like the radioactive iodines that first hit you and fall out it will
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:03.440]  actually not just make you get sick if you get too much it it'll die inside your body and you die
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:11.040]  your thyroid just rots so you take the good potassium iodine it fills it and blocks it now
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:16.960]  this is in layman's terms we've got a master formulator you know chemist biology the dentist
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:22.400]  you know dr cori gold on but am i am i saying this correctly from my layman research yeah i think
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:28.000]  you've hit it pretty well close you talk about animals people spend a lot of money animals are
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:32.960]  worth something cows are worth something chickens are worth something livestock's worth something
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:38.640]  so they feed them exactly the right kind of nutrition that's designed to either create more
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:44.400]  beef or create more fat or create a larger cow or decrease whatever they're trying to decrease
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:49.600]  to keep them healthy because sick animals can't be sold sick animals don't reproduce sick animals
[02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:55.040]  don't give off milk and they can't use them so they take a lot of care in feeding them well
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:38:00.960]  they don't take that care in feeding you they don't and if we actually ate like they fed the
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:07.600]  animals on farms we'd be much healthier 50 years ago they understood that amino acids vitamins
[02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:12.720]  minerals and omega oils were important to these animals they they reproduce better they had better
[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:17.840]  they had better you know livelihood they produce more milk they resisted they could live in the
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:22.800]  colder weather they had you know greater ability to live off smaller amounts of food they they grew
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:28.800]  faster you they had less diseases less genetic mutations so they fed them right they don't we
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:33.840]  don't care about us as much so they want to see garbage they'll give us high fruit toast corn syrups
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:39.200]  you know they'll they'll give us you know all kind of things msg and our food they'll give us all
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:45.280]  kind of brand names of these different kind of artificial sweeteners they'll give us all these
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:50.960]  sodas they're full of syrups and different things absolutely ends exactly and by the way
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:55.040]  i didn't just when i relearned all this information because i'd always known it just hadn't paid
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:39:00.080]  attention i went and did research it turns out in industrial veterinary medicine this is just
[02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:06.640]  common knowledge so really what dr walloch has come up with is just a way to formulate what we're
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:13.520]  missing it's just like limes for the sailors so they don't get scurvy but if people don't have that
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:18.080]  basic knowledge it's destroying them and i know dr walloch talks about a lot of the public
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:24.080]  basically has scurvy nowadays of one form or another well we a lot of people have mineral
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:29.120]  deficiencies a lot of people have vitamin deficiencies you know they're getting a lot of
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:34.160]  calories so people are very conscious of calories but calories and nutrition are not tied together
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:39.840]  anymore it used to be a high calorie diet with a high nutrition diet today it's totally the opposite
[02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:48.080]  it so i mean if you look at it today the average parent is is doesn't know where to turn to to
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:52.480]  give their kids the vitamins amino acids minerals and omega oils they don't even know they're not
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:57.120]  even in the foods they're eating they're eating by they're eating food that's the void of minerals
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:02.080]  so they they may even go down to the store and try to pick an apple or an orange and it looks
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:07.760]  orange and it looks red but it's not that doesn't have the nutrition in it it's been it maybe took
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:12.000]  two weeks to get from the farm to the market because we had to get it from chili and had to go on a
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:16.640]  boat and by the time it gets here it's under a red light so it looks tasty for you by the time you
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:22.880]  get at home it doesn't really have much in it and by the way from what i've read if they're giving
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:29.680]  them the chemical fertilizers in many cases it makes it grow but it doesn't actually contain
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:35.040]  the material and of course that's the issue is the plate out soils and i had my mic on i was
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:38.400]  telling the guys go ahead and get another shot of it because while you're talking i'm showing
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:43.280]  people articles again here's the washington post study finds high fructose corn syrup contains
[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:54.160]  mercury and you read the article high levels in it high levels high levels and again it goes on
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:41:00.000]  and on and on they know full well explain to people why high fructose corn syrup it's in tens of
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:05.520]  thousands of products conservatively why it has mercury in it well it's a process that used to
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:10.560]  make it it's the industrial manufacturing process they don't they don't you could just say they
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:16.320]  don't want it in there but it's a byproduct of the manufacturing so you have it left over
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:20.880]  and they try to remove a good portion if not as much as they can out of it but you still have
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:26.400]  a lot left over and for some reason the government says the process is safe and that the end process
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:31.680]  is okay for people to use and when you grab a can of soda out of the you know out of the big machine
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:35.040]  not only are you getting the carbonation which is bad for your bones but you're getting the
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:40.400]  you're getting the high fructose corn syrup which inhibits your body's use of calcium and
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:45.520]  zinc and phosphorus that your body needs to rid itself of heavy metals and to have strong bones
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:50.160]  and to resist osteoporosis so if anybody tells you that nobody's out there telling you that
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:54.080]  drinking sodas is good for you so i mean even the medical association is not telling you that
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:58.080]  drinking sodas is good for you but it's just they don't tell you how bad it is for you well you
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:03.120]  know whenever i was in high school my senior year i was lifting weights and jogging i was in pretty
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:08.400]  good shape but i would drink twice a day they had coke machines i would during the five minute
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:13.440]  break i'd grab one guzzle it down and go into class and somebody said hey if you quit drinking
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:17.520]  those you'll lose weight because i was about 20 pounds of her weight within a month of going off
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:22.400]  coca-cola by the way i had a coke cola last night i had one about twice a year they taste great
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:28.480]  the point is that i lost like 20 pounds boom but that's not the issue dentists tell you
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:33.440]  don't drink them because they eat your teeth not just the sugar uh but the other chemicals in it
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:38.720]  i don't think there's anybody out there telling you drinking a soda is good for you
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:42.880]  they may say hey listen have one now and then and i'm the same way i had a soda with my daughter
[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:46.880]  yesterday it was it was good it tasted good you can do naughty things every once in a while
[02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:50.480]  but if you do it all the time it's not good for you and what people are doing nowadays like
[02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:53.920]  hey let's go eat healthy let's go that health food store and eat there once every few months
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:58.320]  because it's good for us and they eat at the other store all the time it's the opposite you know
[02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:02.400]  you're having a soda once in a while great treat yourself you know that's fun but if you're not
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:07.120]  getting the the vitamins the amino acids the minerals the omega oils those 90 central nutrients
[02:43:07.120 --> 02:43:11.680]  your body can't function because if your body has that stuff when occasionally you go the wrong
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:16.880]  way and you have that fun food it clears it out it says okay you went the wrong if somebody drinks
[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:22.000]  too much once in a while the person feels bad for a day so we do know that when you put the
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:26.400]  wrong things in your body your body feels sick anybody who doesn't drink very often if they
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:30.160]  drink too much they know their body feels really rotten the next day your body has to clear all
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:34.560]  those toxins and poisons out but your body can do it if it's only once in a while if you're
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:39.440]  constantly drinking too much your body just degenerates your liver starts failing you start
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:44.560]  getting you start getting the crows oh i'll say this i i took my children to laser blazer with
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:49.040]  their cousin to have you know a laser fight and they're in there playing and i'm sitting there
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:54.400]  with the four-year-old and we're playing a few of the you know games where you roll the ball up and
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:44:02.160]  it goes in the holes or i forget the name of that what's that called a skeetball and i look over and
[02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:06.960]  i see the coca-cola fountain now and i was like you know i haven't had one like it two years or
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:12.480]  literally i went and got one it was really good but about an hour later after that i went to my parents
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:19.520]  hadn't felt that exhausted in in a year and it was like wow that fruit toast high fruit toast
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:26.400]  jacked me up brought me down and i don't want to do that again well you're right i mean there's
[02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:31.680]  a new study just released today that was talking about giving vaccinations to kids and say well
[02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:36.800]  some of these vaccinations when they're real young is bad for you but when it's older it's okay because
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:41.600]  it doesn't affect the system as much and you know i'm reading here where the the doctors actually
[02:44:41.600 --> 02:44:46.880]  saying yeah when you give it to him i'm reading it directly from the study though the seizures are
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:52.640]  scary for parents they're not really very dangerous and do not lead to later epilepsy epilepsy or
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:58.960]  seizure disorders so we give you a vaccination and you have a seizure it's scary but hey so is a theme
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:04.080]  park you mean it's my god it's like oh well you know the kid had a seizure when you have that stop
[02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:09.600]  right there stop right there this is how conditioned i am i want to just stop we need to get a drum roll
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:16.080]  i'm not big on sound effects but we need a collapse for our guest i want to get those loaded in like
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:22.960]  applause but you're a drummer you're a great drummer uh why don't we pull in some well just
[02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:29.280]  find me on youtube a drum roll for this real quick because because listen folks i saw the study last
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:35.040]  week and didn't even cover it that's how conditioned i am i already know the inserts for 30 years or
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:40.160]  plus have said can cause narcolepsy degenerative diseases of the brain neurological disorders
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:48.240]  all this stuff can cause uh epilepsy a narcolepsy i've shown you the news headlines but now they're
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:54.880]  saying give two-year-olds painkillers have them go to sleep because the vaccines are so powerful now
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:59.680]  a lot of people are having seizures right there and the doctors like it when you just go home
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:03.760]  have the seizure then they can take your kids and say they had a seizure because you beat them
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:08.960]  do a cat scan show blood on the brain from the autoimmune response that's a double goodie then
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:13.280]  once they take your kid from you they can really murder them with vaccines and drugs the real party
[02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:19.280]  can start as texas doctors went public wo ai investigation the average foster child is on
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:24.000]  seven drugs on average and then and the doctors said then they start having the seizures when we
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:29.040]  put them on on any seizure medication and the state just gets more and more money it's like just a
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:34.080]  feast of murder but they got the average doctors on a murderer they're just doing what the system
[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:38.800]  tells them but the system knows what they're doing but here he is they've now come out and said it's
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:44.320]  normal to have a seizure everyone have seizures it's good to have a seizure bite your tongue off
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:48.480]  and but but but you're not going to get it permanently when the insert actually says it
[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:54.080]  we're able to find a drum roll ladies and gentlemen uh let's go ahead if we found one and play one
[02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:59.440]  so dr gold can go to the study and give you time to pull oh we don't have it don't worry about it
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:05.360]  it's all right uh i'll pull one up right here uh it doesn't matter uh go ahead and tell us about
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:10.400]  the study because it's just normal have a seizure barbie has cancer it's fun it's the new freedom
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:15.440]  well it's just a febrile seizure which means it's because you're you have such a high fever so you
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:19.760]  took this vaccination it's not that you have a real seizure it's just you have such a high
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:24.240]  fever as as a result of this wonderful thing they're giving you that your body goes into a seizure
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:30.160]  and it says it might be very scary for parents but they're not dangerous you have such a high fever
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:34.880]  your body's in seizure but it's not dangerous it's all very good for you and it's not going to lead
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:39.520]  to long-term effects but maybe we should wait till they're older to give them this thing so they can
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:43.760]  handle a little bit better it wasn't good for you when you're younger how's it much better for you
[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:48.320]  when you're older uh it's it's just the whole thing in there well don't worry don't be scared
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:52.640]  it's just that your kid has a really super high fever i've had fevers many times my kids have had
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:57.040]  fevers they've never gone into seizures how high does this fever have to be in this very helpful
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:06.800]  thing oh there's your drum roll there you go oh my gosh that's pretty good but i mean we need like

[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:58.560]  ahead dr gold well you know you go on and on with this and it sounds funny when you start adding it
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:03.200]  together but the reality is these are the things that it's just overwhelming for an average parent
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:07.040]  because they want to listen to a doctor and the doctor probably thinks they're doing the right
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:12.080]  thing but somewhere along the food chain of this somebody's got to say to themselves wait a second
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:18.960]  one out of 58 boys is having autism isn't somebody looking to find the reason why i mean one's going
[02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:24.480]  to be one out of 40 and one out of 35 and one out of eight and one out of two and that's everybody
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:29.840]  i mean isn't somebody worried i mean it's it's kind of like when it gets closer and closer and closer
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:36.080]  one out of 50 kids has autism and we don't and when somebody says well maybe it's the vaccines
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:40.880]  they say well that parent's just disgruntled that their kid has autism and they're trying to find
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:47.840]  somebody to blame isn't somebody else looking for what's causing it unbelievable stay there i want

[03:00:32.640 --> 03:00:38.640]  Alright, Dr. Corey Golds, our guest. He's an advisor and helped me pick a lot of products.
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:41.640]  I have it at infowarchteam.com. He formulated pollen burst.
[03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:44.640]  I want to take one more call from Sean in Arizona.
[03:00:44.640 --> 03:00:48.640]  Maybe Phoenix if we have time.
[03:00:48.640 --> 03:00:50.640]  Or no, Mike's been holding a long time.
[03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:53.640]  But real fast, I meant to get into this with you and of course I'm so long-winded I didn't.
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:00:56.640]  What are these new attacks that the FDA is doing?
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:00:58.640]  I know they're trying to bring in Codex Alimentarius.
[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:00.640]  60 seconds on that, Doc.
[03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:02.640]  You've got to be worried about it.
[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:05.640]  The more they tell you they're protecting you, the more you've got to be scared.
[03:01:05.640 --> 03:01:11.640]  They're trying to really turn vitamins and minerals into regulated drugs where they're not.
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:13.640]  And they're trying to limit your access to them.
[03:01:13.640 --> 03:01:16.640]  It's already happening in Europe to a large degree.
[03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:18.640]  And they're really launching a lot of attacks.
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:20.640]  We've got to get you back up. This is all happening right now.
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:23.640]  There are all these points you wanted to get to, of course, I never even let you.
[03:01:23.640 --> 03:01:26.640]  Sean in Arizona, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:30.640]  Yes, Alex, I'm so glad to be able to talk to you finally.
[03:01:30.640 --> 03:01:32.640]  Good to have you on.
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:34.640]  Mike turned me on about three years ago.
[03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:36.640]  I'm only going to make three or four statements.
[03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:38.640]  Now I'll get off here and let you comment.
[03:01:38.640 --> 03:01:39.640]  Go ahead, brother.
[03:01:39.640 --> 03:01:40.640]  What?
[03:01:40.640 --> 03:01:41.640]  Go ahead, brother.
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:43.640]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[03:01:43.640 --> 03:01:44.640]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:44.640 --> 03:01:45.640]  Okay.
[03:01:45.640 --> 03:01:50.640]  I said I'm only going to make three or four comments and then I'll get off here and let you comment.
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:53.640]  Come back to me on it, you and the doctor.
[03:01:53.640 --> 03:02:00.640]  First of all, I'm, I've got a degree in electronic engineering and also in American history.
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:02.640]  And my wife is the light.
[03:02:02.640 --> 03:02:10.640]  I was a licensed nurse in the system and she divorced that for the simple fact that she saw where it was going.
[03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:12.640]  Thanks to you.
[03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:20.640]  I long, a long time ago, divorced the electronics industry or the simple fact that I saw where it was going.
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:24.640]  And he's dropping on civilians that it was doing.
[03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:40.640]  And I, at that time I was working in the R&D department for a Chrysler corporation who was under contract in NASA who had gotten their contract from a branch of government that doesn't exist, the NSA.
[03:02:40.640 --> 03:02:50.640]  And we saw where it was going with the satellites that could counter freckles and the hairs on your, up your nose.
[03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:53.640]  So I want to thank you.
[03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:59.640]  I want to tell you that you and everybody on the info team are in my prayers constantly.
[03:02:59.640 --> 03:03:06.640]  I used to listen to, before I found you, I used to listen to people like Beck and Savage.
[03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:13.640]  And I thought they were weak knee whips, but I did get a little information from you.
[03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:25.640]  On the other hand, in my opinion, I think you need to get out there and scream some more and show some more rage because they're killing us hand over fist.
[03:03:25.640 --> 03:03:28.640]  They are killing us hand over fist.
[03:03:28.640 --> 03:03:31.640]  It is. It's so crazy when you're actually know what's going on.
[03:03:31.640 --> 03:03:33.640]  It's beyond words.
[03:03:33.640 --> 03:03:35.640]  I feel like I'm not doing enough.
[03:03:35.640 --> 03:03:39.640]  You're exactly right. And I'm going to tell you, I'm one of the dying ones right now.
[03:03:39.640 --> 03:03:41.640]  I'm one of the soft killers.
[03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:43.640]  I mean, I heard that.
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:47.640]  I served 17 and a half years in the Navy.
[03:03:47.640 --> 03:03:56.640]  And then they put me out with a medical because that's all they could get me out the door on because I was they put me out, labeled me as a renegade and gave me an RECode four.
[03:03:56.640 --> 03:03:59.640]  Because they couldn't do anything else with me.
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:07.640]  Well, God bless you, sir. And you know what? They may have soft killed a lot of us. All of us have had time taking off our lives, all this poisoning.
[03:04:07.640 --> 03:04:09.640]  But every day is a treasure.
[03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:11.640]  We've got our lives to warn people.
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:17.640]  Those of you that know you've been hurt by these people or have a child damaged by the vaccines, you know now.
[03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:22.640]  Don't let other kids be hurt and warn people.
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:25.640]  And the power and the pain you've gone through as a testament to others.
[03:04:25.640 --> 03:04:30.640]  God bless you. And I appreciate your call. Mike, if you get back in tomorrow, go to the head of the line, everybody else.
[03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:32.640]  We're trying to take more calls.
