[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War, and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.000 --> 00:38.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:38.000 --> 01:03.000]  When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19 hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.
[01:03.000 --> 01:17.000]  They did not know if they would survive the hour, they did not know if they would grow old, but they knew that America had to prevail.
[01:17.000 --> 01:33.000]  Their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America, they did it for us.
[01:33.000 --> 02:02.000]  Everything that has come since, our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice, all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.
[02:02.000 --> 02:27.000]  Think of this capital, think of this very chamber where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways and defeat fascism, to secure civil rights and to face down evil empires.
[02:27.000 --> 02:36.000]  Here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.
[02:36.000 --> 02:59.000]  You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii, from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona, from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.
[02:59.000 --> 03:08.000]  Together we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.
[03:08.000 --> 03:16.000]  What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?
[03:16.000 --> 03:31.000]  I ask the men and women of this Congress, look at the opportunities before us. Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.
[03:31.000 --> 03:57.000]  Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them.
[03:57.000 --> 04:14.000]  We must choose whether we squander our great inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible.
[04:14.000 --> 04:34.000]  We conquer the unknown. This is the time to reignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star.
[04:34.000 --> 04:50.000]  This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future, our fate.
[04:50.000 --> 05:09.000]  Very powerful. We're going to come back to play a lot more of this today. On this Wednesday, February 6, 2019, Global Transmission, I'm Alex Jones.
[05:09.000 --> 05:28.000]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements. But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[05:28.000 --> 05:42.000]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, free workout, and beyond system in the world. There's nothing else like it. You must experience it. It is a total game changer.
[05:42.000 --> 05:57.000]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like. Warning, though, it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours, so take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[05:57.000 --> 06:16.000]  TurboForce at EnforceLive.com.
[06:27.000 --> 06:56.000]  It's Wednesday, February 6, 2019, and I am very, very reflective this morning, this afternoon.
[06:56.000 --> 07:14.000]  I'm going to talk about what we're facing and the fact that everybody at a core, deep-down level who's got any connection to God or any connection to reality understands that we are facing a demonic invasion.
[07:14.000 --> 07:42.000]  Call it demonic, call it space aliens, call it whatever you want. There are fingerprints, there are desires, there are hungers that aren't human, that are manifesting themselves throughout civilization and that are attempting to basically take over our world and destroy our children, our health, our psychies, our very souls.
[07:42.000 --> 08:00.000]  Call it what you want, but when you study the globalist and you study what they're really into, they're all heavily into the occult, and they believe that entities from another dimension are giving them divine power.
[08:00.000 --> 08:12.000]  That's the New World Order religion, and they're like, well, that's exactly what the Bible says, and everything in the Bible and Revelation is now unfolding.
[08:12.000 --> 08:22.000]  And Revelation says in the last days there will literally be demons running around in people possessed, en masse.
[08:22.000 --> 08:41.000]  And I come in here and I look at the news, and I'm not digging for stuff like this, and it's incredible, and I see it on the street in Austin, and I hear about it from friends and family in other cities and other areas where there is a hunger of the left, the left-hand path.
[08:41.000 --> 08:49.000]  That's Satanism. They're not liberals. They're the left. They're the Satan party.
[08:49.000 --> 09:01.000]  And now all over national news, they have the Church of Satan, Temple of Satan, all these groups ongoing. We fear the Christians, and they have to be dealt with, and they have to be banned.
[09:01.000 --> 09:11.000]  And the news is like, thank you, Church of Satan. You're right. Thank you for protecting the children.
[09:11.000 --> 09:20.000]  And then their statue that they put up in public is Bathomet with the two children looking up to Bathomet.
[09:20.000 --> 09:29.000]  Oh, Bathomet. Think about how Trump, in last night's speech, I want to play this over and over again.
[09:29.000 --> 09:40.000]  We've got a big list here, but can you guys cue it up? We talked about a doctor executing a baby, and how the black face and all that's bad enough.
[09:40.000 --> 09:49.000]  But what about killing babies after they're born? And Trump says, well, why do we even need a law? That's already illegal.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  And that's the point, is it's the way they're saying, the government shouldn't be involved.
[09:54.000 --> 10:06.000]  We're going to let the doctors decide the medical facilities. It's all about organs. So that's the next piece, is the organs. And he's an organ-harvesting doctor.
[10:06.000 --> 10:17.000]  I knew he was a pediatrician and a surgeon on children, but I looked deeper. He's involved in the organ racket. I knew it.
[10:17.000 --> 10:29.000]  And when Trump said that, I was fascinated this morning. I spent like an hour looking for different angles. C-span, ABC, they're all different.
[10:29.000 --> 10:38.000]  The Democrats were shaking their heads and angry with him when he said, you shouldn't kill a baby after it's born. You shouldn't execute it.
[10:38.000 --> 10:56.000]  He used the proper term. The president did. So see, that's the thing here, is that then Trump starts talking about all the women they've saved from sex slavery
[10:56.000 --> 11:03.000]  and all the children and the massive arrest being way up in the convictions and they're all shaking their heads again and angry.
[11:03.000 --> 11:11.000]  And because we tell you something, folks, I live in Texas where the Democrats have almost taken over. The average Texas walking around going, well, never get control of Texas.
[11:11.000 --> 11:22.000]  Bull, they'll get control just like California. You better wake up. Two minutes to midnight here.
[11:22.000 --> 11:34.000]  And I've got all these clips of Democrats angry and shaking their head and staring at the front with hate because folks, let me explain something to you.
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  Beto O'Rourke brags that we're getting thousands in from caravans a day.
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  While in national news, he says there's no such thing as a caravan. This is military operations we're up against.
[11:44.000 --> 11:56.000]  Where you lie to your enemy, the people, you tell your own operatives, we're getting 2,000 a day in just in my sector. This is an army of evil.
[11:56.000 --> 12:09.000]  And the Democrats skim money off the illegal aliens. They're the permanent underclass. They've caught them all over Texas with city council members, families running dungeons with chained up people inside of them
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  because they didn't pay all the money they were supposed to to get smuggled up here.
[12:14.000 --> 12:24.000]  These are hardcore criminals. So when you sit there and you see Cortez and all these people pissed, shaking their heads and angry,
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  and Camilla Harris shakes her head at Trump, talking about combating cartels of human traffickers.
[12:30.000 --> 12:38.000]  That's because this is a mafia, folks. America's got cancer. These people are cancer.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  These are dirtbag crooks, man. They run rackets.
[12:42.000 --> 12:53.000]  MS-13, Mexican mafia is their enforcement arm. Democrats pull hits all the time in major cities. They kill people.
[12:53.000 --> 13:05.000]  What you just think, gangsters are only Italian?
[13:05.000 --> 13:13.000]  The Italian mafia got pushed out from its quasi-dominant path in the 50s because they wouldn't be involved in pedophilia.
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  That's why the Italian mafia got minimized.
[13:18.000 --> 13:27.000]  The real mafia, ladies and gentlemen, is the scum you see on those dioceses.
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  And the dirtier Italian mafia, that's what Pelosi comes from, joined.
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  They're joined with evil. That's who these people are.
[13:37.000 --> 13:47.000]  And so Gavin McGinnis has now discovered that in the Canadian trans kids program, they're teaching the kids about serial killers and how cool they are.
[13:47.000 --> 13:55.000]  You're like, oh, that's just one more piece, like the amazing Desmond.
[13:55.000 --> 14:05.000]  Desmond is amazing, talking about taking ketamine and drugs and sex parties, and he dances on stage for men.
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  And it's all in your face.
[14:10.000 --> 14:20.000]  You understand? That's what it is. When you sign on to Hollywood, you sign on to any of it.
[14:20.000 --> 14:30.000]  That's who you're with now. So let's play the president standing up against killing babies after they're born.
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  Wow. And we can't even get everybody to agree to that. Here it is.
[14:34.000 --> 14:49.000]  There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days.
[14:49.000 --> 15:03.000]  Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth.
[15:03.000 --> 15:12.000]  These are living, feeling beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.
[15:12.000 --> 15:22.000]  And then we had the case of the governor of Virginia, where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.
[15:22.000 --> 15:41.000]  To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late term abortion of children who can feel pain in a mother's womb.
[15:41.000 --> 15:51.000]  Yeah, we're facing devil wars.
[15:51.000 --> 16:20.000]  Period. And these entities want children. Period. That's what this is. They're harvesting our children in front of us.
[16:21.000 --> 16:29.000]  Deep State began with World War One, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[20:31.000 --> 20:37.000]  From the front lines of the Information War.
[20:37.000 --> 20:48.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  You know, I missed Joe Rogan's phone call last night.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  Had my phone off.
[20:56.000 --> 21:05.000]  I really am so disgusted I don't know if I would have taken the call if I knew he called.
[21:05.000 --> 21:12.000]  Nevertheless, Joe will be on with us at the bottom of the next hour live, Joe Rogan.
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.000]  So I guess we'll take his call live here on here.
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.000]  Unlike the fact that he never lets me defend myself on his podcast.
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.000]  So Joe Rogan will be on bottom of the next hour.
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  And of course, satire starts with an S. I'll leave it at that.
[21:30.000 --> 21:37.000]  Now, let's get serious.
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  I am not just sure.
[21:39.000 --> 21:48.000]  I am absolutely 100% dead accurate.
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  On everything the Bible says is true.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  And it's all right in front of us.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  And it's crazy.
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  This is a fricking space invasion, people.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  We're on a planet out in space.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  The globalists are a bunch of devil worshipers.
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.000]  They want our children's essence.
[22:05.000 --> 22:06.000]  And they want our souls.
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  They want our minds.
[22:09.000 --> 22:16.000]  And if you just look at the genetic engineering and everything going on, we're in the middle of a takeover of a revolution.
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.000]  And the people involved in it are unified and focused and organized and know exactly what they're doing.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  It's formulaic.
[22:25.000 --> 22:26.000]  It's unity of purpose.
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  It's strategic.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  And it's directed.
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  And I knew God was real.
[22:31.000 --> 22:40.000]  And I knew all this was real before because of experiences and six cents and things I grew up seeing and all of it.
[22:40.000 --> 22:55.000]  But when I went to a city fully under alien control, like San Francisco or Seattle, that's a couple of their main bases, as you know, their main breakthrough points.
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  They've breached and they've got pretty much the whole city under their control.
[22:59.000 --> 23:09.000]  Demons, whatever it is, is that Zimmerman is not a cowardly guy, but he stopped wanting to go outside with me after about two days.
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.000]  For six days in Seattle, particularly, because he saw it.
[23:14.000 --> 23:23.000]  He saw it where we would round one corner and it was like Agent Smith in The Matrix.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  The elite's telling you all this, which is jump into person after person.
[23:26.000 --> 23:32.000]  And it was like people were saying incredibly evil, horrible things to me.
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  As I would round a corner, the next person would finish the sentence and do it in a demonic voice.
[23:38.000 --> 23:47.000]  We've played a lot of these videos and people have seen the State House where they're trying to pass a pro-life deal and women just chain reactions,
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.000]  start going, Hail Satan, I want babies, I want blood, Hail Satan, Hail Satan.
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.000]  Women in business suits, it wasn't even organized.
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  They all just, like the spirit of Satan just came down upon them.
[23:58.000 --> 24:03.000]  Or you go to a pro-life demonstration and the Antifa shows up and they've got devil tattoos.
[24:03.000 --> 24:08.000]  They're saying, I killed my kid, I love Satan and it's getting worse.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  It's like all over.
[24:09.000 --> 24:16.000]  Whether you believe demons are real or whatever this is or it's like some avatar jacking into them, these people are into this.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  This is happening everywhere.
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  This is who they are.
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.000]  And they know that we have morals and moral superiority in the moral high ground.
[24:23.000 --> 24:29.000]  So they're always telling us that we're bad and we're scum and we're stupid.
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  And that we morally are doing bad things because they know that's how they get to us.
[24:34.000 --> 24:40.000]  They have no morals except whatever they want to do.
[24:40.000 --> 24:46.000]  In fact, we'll play an intro from the show a few years ago, just a few clips of the devil worshiping.
[24:46.000 --> 24:58.000]  But the reason I say that is when you understand that we're facing are a bunch of people that aren't playing like they're vampires.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  Folks, they've got big circles around their eyes.
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  They have got zombie looks in their face.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  They're drooling.
[25:04.000 --> 25:11.000]  You're literally battling the forces of hell.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  It's real.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  It's real.
[25:15.000 --> 25:21.000]  And that's why every culture has been obsessed with it.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  And everyone knows it.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  And you've got a bunch of weak people that think evil is powerful.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  So they go join with it, kind of like mass Stockholm syndrome.
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.000]  So I want to open the phones up about this issue and also open the phones up about the state of the union.
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.000]  What you thought the best parts of it were, the best moments and the worst moments, those three topics.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  Revelation is now becoming manifest.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  Mark of the Beast, world government.
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  Jack Dorsey, I just tune in to Joe Rogan.
[25:56.000 --> 26:06.000]  And he's pushing a new global one world government currency run by Jack Dorsey and Twitter, moderated by all their people like they did with the Bitcoin wars.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  All that censorship.
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  Oh, I forgot to tell you guys, just type in Joe Rogan, Bitcoin.
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  And there's a bunch of big articles by folks pointing out that it's insider trading, just like I told you.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  And very unethical.
[26:20.000 --> 26:27.000]  And one of them is the dark side of Joe Rogan and Bitcoin or things from hack.com.
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  Just that's the article.
[26:28.000 --> 26:36.000]  And there's the dark side of Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin push on Joe Rogan.
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  And of course, Joe didn't say on the show that it was a sponsor made it clear.
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  He talked about how great it was because it helped somebody's charity.
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  So it was all esoteric to figure it out.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  The SEC, don't worry.
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  Dorsey dropped the cards that, hey, I meet with the SEC.
[26:51.000 --> 26:56.000]  They're helping me, which means he's giving him jobs and revolving doors and he's covered.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  He's he's protected.
[26:58.000 --> 27:03.000]  He's, he's, he's, he's part of the mission are at protectorate.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  He's in the priesthood.
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.000]  He's a made man.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  He can do it every once.
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  Don't worry, Joe.
[27:09.000 --> 27:22.000]  I'm just letting your fans know that they're being sucked into another pump and dump on the old Bitcoin with the hope down the road that out of the crises comes regulation that makes it the one currency.
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  How authoritarian is that he's also pushing through his platform.
[27:26.000 --> 27:35.000]  It's already the dominant platform is square cash that it only be Bitcoin that no one even knows who made or where it came from.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  Definitely a world government move.
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  Definitely the position to block other cryptocurrencies in the future.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  They definitely tried to seduce me.
[27:43.000 --> 27:50.000]  I remember how pissed one of them got when they offered me, I guess at its peak, it would be like $40 million worth of Bitcoin.
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  And I wouldn't take it and they got so pissed.
[27:55.000 --> 28:00.000]  And of course I got told, oh, I hang out with George Soros and stuff, you know, his son's pretty nice.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  Hey, you might be so mean to him.
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  You might come to New York sometime up to Connecticut and meet him.
[28:06.000 --> 28:12.000]  And I've tried.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  I mean, these guys have tried to recruit me so many times like my headspin.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  But see, they don't get they think I'm stupid.
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  I go with my spirit.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  I let it ripen.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  You see, while I'm learning and scanning and watching.
[28:24.000 --> 28:34.000]  And then when it's time to cut down a tree or butcher a hog, that's when I pulled and I fell.
[28:34.000 --> 28:42.000]  Politically, and people are like, well, you might get destroyed.
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  You realize that if you were in God's presence, you would not be afraid of the devil.
[28:46.000 --> 28:53.000]  You'd be absolutely on your knees for total eternity and absolute complete knowledge.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  Yeah, I'm with God.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  You guys can go with the devil.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  I weighed 329 pounds.
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  I was a heart attack waiting to happen.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  It makes me not so hungry.
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.000]  I started noticing more energy.
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  I noticed my belly was starting to shrink up.
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  I started seeing weight come off 80 some pounds.
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.000]  I went for 330 to 245 for a 56 year old guy to lose that much weight.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  It took something, brother.
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  I feel great.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  I feel like I was when I was 35 years old.
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  That was Ruben.
[29:21.000 --> 29:24.000]  Now listen to what Josh says about Andrew 400.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  Well, I'll tell you, man, that stuff really works.
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.000]  It was insane.
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  I've heard the commercials walk for a decade.
[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  I was like, I'm just gonna try it.
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  My pants are like falling off.
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  It really works.
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  I bought suits last year for my new job and they're falling off of me.
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  It's insane.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  Guys, if you want to lose belly fat, gain energy, strengthen muscle and look and feel years younger,

[32:22.000 --> 32:28.000]  Now we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[32:28.000 --> 32:33.000]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[32:33.000 --> 32:41.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[32:41.000 --> 32:45.000]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:45.000 --> 32:50.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[32:50.000 --> 32:55.000]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[32:55.000 --> 33:03.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:03.000 --> 33:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:11.000 --> 33:19.000]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[33:19.000 --> 33:24.000]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers,
[33:24.000 --> 33:29.000]  maybe you can call the A-team.
[33:29.000 --> 33:32.000]  How many did I insult? I killed my kids.
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  I killed my kids.
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  So why the f**k is this race f**king veil that doesn't stand for women's rights?
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  That's pretty cool man.
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.000]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.000]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  I don't think so.
[33:55.000 --> 34:02.000]  I don't hear children. I f**king love things.
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  I pay for them.
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  How many pay for them?
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  Upwards of 50.
[34:10.000 --> 34:11.000]  Really?
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.000]  Oh yeah.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  You piece of f**king s**t.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  Bunch of misogynists and mother f**king s**t.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  Take your mail privilege somewhere else.
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  How about you, Pina Gressen?
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  I'm Pina Gressen.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  Come on, in on us!
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  Get in on us!
[34:27.000 --> 34:33.000]  These are the guys that attack Alex Jones.
[34:33.000 --> 34:48.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  My cat is just called in and he's going to get hooked up on Skype.
[34:51.000 --> 34:59.000]  He wants to say something about Joe Rogan and Bitcoin and all these scams that are going on.
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  Yes, that's a rumble.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  Wildtowers fall.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  Man.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  Woo!
[35:11.000 --> 35:17.000]  And put them in control.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  Let's hear a little more of this.
[35:19.000 --> 35:25.000]  Watch people's heads a-roll.
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  Watch people's heads a-roll.
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  Just like the Pied Piper.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  Let rats loose.
[35:33.000 --> 35:38.000]  Just like the Pied Piper.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  Let your children away.
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  That's what he really came for.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  Every fairy tale.
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  In every culture.
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  And every legend.
[35:52.000 --> 35:58.000]  They think you come for your children.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  Acting like a robot.
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  Acting like a robot.
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  The metalhead corrodes.
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  It's metal brain corrodes.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  Try to take us boss.
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  For the headaches boss.
[36:14.000 --> 36:20.000]  You try to take us boss.
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.000]  Before the head explodes.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  Explodes.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  I'm here to tell you something.
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  Explodes.
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.000]  Within 20 years.
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  Nothing you see is going to be left standing.
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  None of it.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  All these billionaires are going to be dead.
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  Most of the cities are going to be destroyed.
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  Billions will be gone.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  They know it now.
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  Their plan to orderly exterminate the population.
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  Has already begun the countdown to destruction.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  There is no way to reverse it.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  And their bunkers.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Like Pharaoh's tools.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  Will be their prisons.
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  Built by them.
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  For them.
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  Nothing will be left standing.
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.000]  None of it.
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  All of you that signed on to it.
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  Las Vegas.
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  Los Angeles.
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  They'll all be giant tombstones in the desert.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  But not just there.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  San Francisco.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  New York City.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  Houston, Texas.
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  Gone.
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  You think we can kill hundreds of millions of babies.
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  And splice their genes.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  With cows and mice and rats.
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  For unholy operations.
[37:52.000 --> 37:58.000]  And that we won't be judged by the universe itself.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  BrudgeReport.com.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  Without even looking.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  I can't even get away from it.
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  I told you this 23 years ago.
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  What's their number one attack on me after Sandy Hook.
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  And gay frogs.
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.000]  What is it?
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  What is it?
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  It's Jones is crazy.
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  And claims there's animal.
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.000]  Human.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  Chimeras.
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  Yeah, it was in research literature.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  25 years ago.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  That it was going on decades before.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  I mean, I'm talking MIT.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  And folks.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  Wasn't photos of it.
[38:39.000 --> 38:45.000]  But it was pigs that are nothing but pure me.
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  It was salmon that are three times bigger and will take over the whole ocean.
[38:49.000 --> 38:56.000]  It was goats that are part spider to create body armor.
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  And I was just going, wow, this is in science literature.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  Because I was covering things on there.
[39:02.000 --> 39:08.000]  And they were going to bring me who were engineers and scientists stuff that was not on the news.
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  Let me tell you, I would talk about cable boxes with microphones that I'm 20 years ago.
[39:13.000 --> 39:23.000]  And they would have the US Army show up in parking lots at Target and threaten to kill me if I talked about it again.
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  See back then they don't want people to be warned.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  And I said, you go ahead and do what you need to, buddy.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  Just remember this, God's going to judge you.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.880]  So it's on drugs right now that they're splicing babies
[39:33.880 --> 39:34.920]  with mice.
[39:35.760 --> 39:37.720]  Folks, they were doing that 50 years ago.
[39:37.720 --> 39:38.560]  You know why?
[39:38.560 --> 39:40.760]  We're mostly genetically akin,
[39:40.760 --> 39:41.600]  if you won't get to it,
[39:41.600 --> 39:44.440]  it's not to chimpanzees, but to pigs and to mice.
[39:45.640 --> 39:48.480]  And that's why they've been doing it their first, folks.
[39:48.480 --> 39:49.540]  Pigs and mice.
[39:52.200 --> 39:54.920]  I mean, humans and our genetics just take to those
[39:54.920 --> 39:56.360]  like ducks to water.
[39:56.360 --> 39:57.480]  I'm gonna come back with Mike Adams
[39:57.480 --> 39:58.440]  to get into some of this,
[39:58.440 --> 40:02.480]  but there's no doubt now that this is
[40:02.480 --> 40:04.240]  an interdimensional alien invasion.
[40:04.240 --> 40:05.840]  And you notice, they don't ever play me saying that,
[40:05.840 --> 40:07.680]  they don't attack it in the news because they know it.
[40:07.680 --> 40:10.200]  San Francisco, all of them, they worship it.
[40:10.200 --> 40:12.040]  They worship, they believe that they are,
[40:12.040 --> 40:13.880]  and the Bible, it's exactly that,
[40:13.880 --> 40:16.320]  a literal, lower level, dimensional attack.
[40:16.320 --> 40:18.680]  And that's why when you run into these things,
[40:18.680 --> 40:20.760]  they're so low level, they're so stupid,
[40:20.760 --> 40:23.280]  they're so hateful, and all they wanna do,
[40:23.280 --> 40:26.000]  like zombies, is kill people and attack children.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.280]  So, I guess it's the operating system
[40:29.280 --> 40:31.600]  of this thing that makes us all kill each other.
[40:31.600 --> 40:34.120]  I mean, I'm not, I've looked at every angle of it,
[40:34.120 --> 40:36.240]  but the point is the Pentagon and everybody else,
[40:36.240 --> 40:37.160]  and I had General Stubblebine
[40:37.160 --> 40:38.400]  who ran the operations about this,
[40:38.400 --> 40:41.300]  they were given volunteers, like astronauts,
[40:41.300 --> 40:43.240]  mega doses of drugs, okay,
[40:43.240 --> 40:44.960]  with wires hooked into their brains,
[40:44.960 --> 40:46.840]  and they were in interdimensional meetings
[40:46.840 --> 40:49.080]  with the damn aliens, giving them technology, okay?
[40:49.080 --> 40:51.520]  You don't meet the aliens in a flying saucer by the moon.
[40:51.520 --> 40:54.760]  You meet them in this interdimensional vortex.
[40:54.760 --> 40:56.160]  I'm not the one saying it.
[40:56.160 --> 40:57.960]  They're the ones that are doing it.
[40:58.960 --> 41:01.680]  Hale Buzz Aldrin told me all this stuff too, off air.
[41:01.680 --> 41:02.520]  He's been on the show.
[41:02.520 --> 41:04.520]  I mean, they all know about it.
[41:04.520 --> 41:05.800]  And Trump and others are saying,
[41:05.800 --> 41:09.160]  man, let's not blow the planet up and kill everybody.
[41:09.160 --> 41:11.000]  And the Democrats and the globalists are like,
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.360]  they're the anti-human party.
[41:12.360 --> 41:13.960]  They're the collaborators with it.
[41:13.960 --> 41:16.920]  Call it the devil, call it aliens, whatever it is, man.
[41:16.920 --> 41:19.040]  I've had three star generals on
[41:19.040 --> 41:21.020]  that had people with wires hooked in their brains
[41:21.020 --> 41:23.240]  in damn two year meetings with aliens
[41:23.240 --> 41:24.800]  that lasted one second long.
[41:26.720 --> 41:29.280]  I mean, you understand, folks, that's what the Pentagon does.
[41:29.280 --> 41:30.280]  That's what's going on.
[41:30.280 --> 41:31.280]  It's already happening.
[41:31.280 --> 41:32.840]  It's been happening for decades.
[41:35.480 --> 41:39.040]  And any aliens that'll contact this planet are bad, folks.
[41:39.040 --> 41:42.340]  God doesn't contact us because of free will.
[41:43.760 --> 41:47.440]  This is like a flu or cancer we have, this crap.
[41:47.440 --> 41:49.880]  And everyone knows it at a genetic level
[41:49.880 --> 41:54.080]  that we're far superior to these damn zombies.
[41:54.080 --> 41:57.040]  So they tell us to give in to them and submit to them
[41:57.040 --> 41:59.360]  and go along with all this and have no morals
[41:59.360 --> 42:01.320]  so that they can run their operating system
[42:01.320 --> 42:03.480]  and poison the sky and the genetics
[42:03.480 --> 42:05.040]  and irrevocably attack us.
[42:05.040 --> 42:07.640]  We are under attack.
[42:07.640 --> 42:09.360]  We are under attack.
[42:09.360 --> 42:11.440]  This is not of this world.
[42:11.440 --> 42:12.880]  What's the devil say?
[42:12.880 --> 42:17.440]  Not of this world and nothing bites like I do.
[42:17.440 --> 42:21.000]  Nothing screams out loud in the dark of night.
[42:22.160 --> 42:24.200]  That's what we're dealing with.
[42:24.200 --> 42:27.000]  A spirit, a force, a broadcast.
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.200]  Kill yourselves, kill yourselves, kill yourselves,
[42:29.200 --> 42:30.040]  kill yourselves.
[42:30.040 --> 42:31.200]  You dial into the globalist channel.
[42:31.200 --> 42:33.880]  It's rah, just like death metal.
[42:33.880 --> 42:36.840]  Rah, oh wow, you're the best death metal singer ever.
[42:36.840 --> 42:38.960]  Hell, I can just dial into their frequency.
[42:38.960 --> 42:40.120]  That's all you hear.
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.960]  You can hear the frequency, they're turning the damn thing up
[42:43.960 --> 42:45.720]  and they go, oh, you sound like a schizophrenic.
[42:45.720 --> 42:47.480]  Schizophrenics are people that have already fallen
[42:47.480 --> 42:49.480]  into this stuff or can't handle it.
[42:49.480 --> 42:51.320]  That's why perception is so narrowed
[42:51.320 --> 42:53.160]  so that people can't handle this.
[42:53.160 --> 42:55.080]  I'm not the one saying all this.
[42:55.080 --> 42:59.200]  San Francisco, Big Tech, literally worship aliens.
[43:00.080 --> 43:02.760]  For those looking for the ultimate source of energy

[45:00.560 --> 45:03.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.120]  and put it together with our own four years
[45:05.120 --> 45:08.440]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[45:08.440 --> 45:09.880]  that God gave us through Mother Nature
[45:09.880 --> 45:11.160]  to detoxify the body.
[45:11.160 --> 45:13.200]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[45:13.200 --> 45:16.040]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[45:16.040 --> 45:17.440]  It's made in the USA.
[45:17.440 --> 45:20.280]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[45:20.280 --> 45:23.040]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[45:23.040 --> 45:24.320]  and it supports the info war.
[45:24.320 --> 45:26.440]  It is a classical 360 win.
[45:26.440 --> 45:28.680]  This is the formula that I personally
[45:28.680 --> 45:30.120]  have been taking for over a year.
[45:30.120 --> 45:33.280]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[45:33.280 --> 45:36.160]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[45:36.160 --> 45:38.120]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family
[45:38.120 --> 45:40.480]  and you owe it to the future of this country
[45:40.480 --> 45:42.960]  and the world that patriots stay as healthy
[45:42.960 --> 45:45.760]  and as clean and as focused as you can be
[45:45.760 --> 45:48.680]  because we need you, the remnant of America
[45:48.680 --> 45:51.000]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.240]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together
[45:55.240 --> 45:56.320]  we're changing the world.
[45:56.320 --> 45:57.920]  Now it's time to change our bodies
[45:57.920 --> 46:00.160]  with ZShield and infowarshore.com.
[46:03.160 --> 46:06.200]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[46:06.200 --> 46:08.400]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products
[46:08.400 --> 46:09.880]  can give you a short boost,
[46:09.880 --> 46:12.640]  the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[46:12.640 --> 46:14.360]  TurboForce from InfoWarslife
[46:14.360 --> 46:16.440]  is a powerful mix-in energy packet
[46:16.440 --> 46:19.960]  that utilizes vitamins, amino acids and extracts
[46:19.960 --> 46:23.200]  used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity
[46:23.200 --> 46:24.800]  and a boost of energy on the go.
[46:28.040 --> 46:30.760]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount
[46:30.760 --> 46:32.120]  of water and enjoy.
[46:33.640 --> 46:36.800]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply
[46:36.800 --> 46:38.720]  this is the formula to stock up on
[46:38.720 --> 46:40.120]  whenever you need a boost.
[46:41.720 --> 46:44.840]  Perfect for work, in the car or at home.
[46:44.840 --> 46:48.080]  TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[46:48.080 --> 46:50.120]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[46:50.120 --> 46:53.280]  Herc up with TurboForce at infowarshore.com.
[46:53.280 --> 47:06.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:06.160 --> 47:23.600]  A waiting the hour of the present, the time strips away.
[47:23.600 --> 47:30.880]  All of you devils, all of you enemies, all of you collaborators.
[47:30.880 --> 47:37.040]  Just wait until you get dumped with a phantom show.
[47:37.040 --> 47:42.040]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[47:55.120 --> 47:56.800]  All right, now getting back to what I'm covering here.
[47:56.800 --> 47:58.760]  People always wanted me to cover space aliens
[47:58.760 --> 47:59.440]  and all those stuff.
[47:59.440 --> 48:00.800]  I never got into all that because
[48:00.800 --> 48:02.000]  I was covering political stuff
[48:02.000 --> 48:03.240]  at the Federal Reserve and how it all works.
[48:03.240 --> 48:07.640]  But in decades of research, in decades of high level contacts
[48:07.640 --> 48:10.000]  and people in Hollywood and billionaires
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.680]  reaching out and all of it, it's like Elon Musk
[48:11.680 --> 48:15.000]  went on Joe Rogan's show about a year after I did
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.440]  and repeated everything I said and said it was all true.
[48:17.440 --> 48:22.400]  According to the cults he's in or the cults they let him into
[48:22.400 --> 48:24.880]  and he's freaked out and scared.
[48:24.880 --> 48:27.520]  So he tried to come tell you, I don't believe
[48:27.520 --> 48:29.120]  in space aliens and all this stuff.
[48:29.120 --> 48:31.400]  The globalists do, see, people say,
[48:31.400 --> 48:33.160]  well, you don't believe in the devil.
[48:33.160 --> 48:34.560]  The devil believes in you.
[48:34.560 --> 48:36.600]  Ruin of Mike Adams.
[48:36.600 --> 48:38.040]  I don't plug on my own worth enemy
[48:38.040 --> 48:44.840]  and I gotta tell you, I am my own worth enemy.
[48:44.840 --> 48:48.560]  If you don't habituate to go, you're not just gonna
[48:48.560 --> 48:50.720]  t-shirt, the reason coffee and toothpaste
[48:50.720 --> 48:53.200]  and stuff so great is you have to buy it every month
[48:53.200 --> 48:55.320]  and you get the coffee like, damn, this is really good coffee.
[48:55.320 --> 48:57.480]  Sign up for auto-ship, additional 10% off.
[48:57.480 --> 48:59.680]  Toothpaste, coitle, silver, iodine, fortified,
[48:59.680 --> 49:03.040]  concentrated, super, this is the best toothpaste I've ever had.
[49:03.040 --> 49:07.240]  Yeah, but we only make like a little bit of money.
[49:07.240 --> 49:09.240]  I mean, the coffee, we discounted so much.
[49:09.240 --> 49:11.800]  The same coffee from Chiapas, since we got
[49:11.800 --> 49:13.480]  from the same distributor, is sold at Whole Foods
[49:13.480 --> 49:17.000]  for $10 more a pound.
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.400]  I only like eight bucks on this.
[49:18.400 --> 49:21.200]  I only like three, four bucks on the toothpaste.
[49:21.200 --> 49:24.000]  So I gotta sell a ton of it.
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.040]  But remember, metaphysically, I can only give you
[49:27.040 --> 49:29.480]  a good deal because that's how I wanna be treated.
[49:29.480 --> 49:31.200]  That's a rule.
[49:31.200 --> 49:32.160]  And the more you get into that rule,
[49:32.160 --> 49:33.840]  you can't ever get out of the rule.
[49:35.600 --> 49:36.800]  Like I've talked to a lot of top marketers,
[49:36.800 --> 49:38.760]  they go, look, if you just put crap in it,
[49:38.760 --> 49:40.280]  sell it for 10 times what it's worth,
[49:40.280 --> 49:41.920]  you'll be out of all your issues of all the funding.
[49:41.920 --> 49:43.080]  But then I'd already sold out.
[49:43.080 --> 49:45.440]  See, why didn't I just sell out when they offered me $40
[49:45.440 --> 49:49.640]  million in fricking Bitcoin eight years ago to push it?
[49:49.640 --> 49:51.760]  Because I can't do it.
[49:51.760 --> 49:53.760]  Or a year and a half ago, it was up to a million a month
[49:53.760 --> 49:56.160]  they were offering to push this stuff.
[49:56.160 --> 49:57.520]  And again, I'm not saying it's all bad.
[49:57.520 --> 49:58.720]  I'm saying it's who's behind it
[49:58.720 --> 50:00.320]  and how it's being manipulated.
[50:00.320 --> 50:01.640]  But I need funding.
[50:01.640 --> 50:03.480]  And I know you don't want the enemy to win.
[50:03.480 --> 50:05.000]  And I sit there going, red alert, red alert,
[50:05.000 --> 50:05.840]  need your help.
[50:05.840 --> 50:07.120]  It's because you are the info war.
[50:07.120 --> 50:07.960]  It's like oxygen.
[50:07.960 --> 50:09.560]  I need air.
[50:09.560 --> 50:14.560]  And my heart has to beat 60 times in a minute or whatever.
[50:14.640 --> 50:18.080]  And it's like three meals a day.
[50:18.080 --> 50:19.600]  It has to come in.
[50:19.600 --> 50:20.440]  It has to come in.
[50:20.440 --> 50:21.280]  It has to come in.
[50:21.280 --> 50:22.280]  So thank you for your support,
[50:22.280 --> 50:24.000]  but these are products you absolutely need.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.480]  We have big specials right now on Brainforce Plus
[50:26.480 --> 50:28.240]  and on our latest product that goes with it.
[50:28.240 --> 50:30.880]  Turboforce that's just beyond description.
[50:30.880 --> 50:33.320]  Warning, it's very natural and very strong
[50:33.320 --> 50:35.360]  and lasts a lot longer than the other crappy energy drinks.
[50:35.360 --> 50:36.200]  It is next level.
[50:36.200 --> 50:38.280]  It's the best that the top developers come up with
[50:38.280 --> 50:41.600]  infowarslife.com or AAA-253-339.
[50:41.600 --> 50:42.840]  But just thank you for your support.
[50:42.840 --> 50:45.600]  But please commit to get the products and support us.
[50:45.600 --> 50:47.480]  Get a t-shirt, get a book, get a video.
[50:47.480 --> 50:50.240]  And at the same time, also spread the word
[50:50.240 --> 50:52.920]  because that's every day in the trenches
[50:52.920 --> 50:56.200]  in this wrestling match, this 5,000 round war.
[50:56.200 --> 50:58.360]  And we're like 4,000 rounds into it right now,
[50:58.360 --> 51:00.080]  but there's another 1,000 rounds left.
[51:00.080 --> 51:01.920]  And we just gotta go, you gotta commit
[51:01.920 --> 51:06.760]  and just get in the focused zone and turbo over this.
[51:06.760 --> 51:07.640]  And that's what's gonna happen.
[51:07.640 --> 51:09.480]  Okay, I appreciate Mike Adams wanting to pop in.
[51:09.480 --> 51:13.200]  He wanted to talk about Jack Dorsey and Joe Rogan.
[51:13.200 --> 51:15.800]  And there's an article out of hack.com
[51:15.800 --> 51:18.160]  that says the dark side of Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin push
[51:18.160 --> 51:19.000]  on Joe Rogan.
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.040]  And they went and reviewed it.
[51:20.040 --> 51:22.480]  Joe didn't tell him it was a sponsor when he was on.
[51:22.480 --> 51:24.680]  Joe didn't tell him that Dorsey owns it.
[51:24.680 --> 51:25.600]  Joe didn't tell him that, you know,
[51:25.600 --> 51:27.120]  he wants it to be the one unified currency
[51:27.120 --> 51:28.080]  for a world government.
[51:28.080 --> 51:31.800]  Actually, the owner of Twitter did say that.
[51:31.800 --> 51:33.960]  But being said that, you know, obviously he was the owner.
[51:33.960 --> 51:35.840]  And so it's just very unscrupulous here.
[51:35.840 --> 51:38.960]  And it's just, that's dialing into one show.
[51:38.960 --> 51:40.400]  I don't watch Joe's show.
[51:40.400 --> 51:43.200]  And so it's like, it's dirty.
[51:43.200 --> 51:45.080]  And you know, Joe was calling me last night and stuff.
[51:45.080 --> 51:46.920]  And again, the phone was off.
[51:48.600 --> 51:49.600]  I just covered the state of the union.
[51:49.600 --> 51:50.800]  It was like 11 o'clock at night.
[51:50.800 --> 51:52.360]  So I haven't talked to Joe.
[51:52.360 --> 51:53.440]  This isn't about Joe.
[51:53.440 --> 51:54.920]  This isn't about me coming back on your show.
[51:54.920 --> 51:56.560]  I need to understand something.
[51:56.560 --> 51:58.280]  This is not about me being cool.
[51:58.280 --> 51:59.360]  I'm not out in Hollywood, bro.
[51:59.360 --> 52:01.040]  Okay. It's about, I've got to be clean.
[52:01.040 --> 52:01.880]  Okay.
[52:01.880 --> 52:05.800]  And I feel dirty that I had some concerns about you
[52:05.800 --> 52:06.640]  for a long time.
[52:06.640 --> 52:08.000]  I didn't do anything about it.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.160]  Cause I've never sold out and I'm not going to start now.
[52:10.160 --> 52:12.400]  And it's just, everybody's kind of waking up
[52:12.400 --> 52:14.000]  to the fact that you're the establishment's darling.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.600]  So I don't take pleasure in infighting.
[52:15.600 --> 52:17.400]  I don't do this stuff.
[52:17.400 --> 52:20.640]  But Joe Rogan in their globalist model,
[52:20.640 --> 52:24.040]  they think is a key player in the deception.
[52:24.040 --> 52:26.560]  So joining us is Mike Adams of naturalnews.com,
[52:26.560 --> 52:30.560]  an engineer and a software programmer, par excellence,
[52:30.560 --> 52:32.800]  to give, and a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency,
[52:32.800 --> 52:34.080]  I would say expert.
[52:34.080 --> 52:36.520]  What, what is your take on all this?
[52:36.520 --> 52:39.040]  And why you would, because I'm always trying to get you on.
[52:39.040 --> 52:39.880]  You're too busy to come on.
[52:39.880 --> 52:42.400]  Well, why you would say, hey, get me on right now.
[52:42.400 --> 52:44.800]  Well, first Alex, I want to say that you,
[52:44.800 --> 52:47.480]  on the cosmic extermination agenda
[52:47.480 --> 52:48.640]  that you have been talking about,
[52:48.640 --> 52:53.080]  I just want to affirm that you are 100% on track,
[52:53.080 --> 52:55.600]  that the call has gone out to exterminate humanity.
[52:55.600 --> 52:58.320]  And this is why Democrats are now pro-infanticide.
[52:58.320 --> 53:02.400]  This is why they love the idea of murdering Christians,
[53:02.400 --> 53:04.440]  murdering conservatives, killing Trump.
[53:04.440 --> 53:06.560]  They're all about death and execution now
[53:06.560 --> 53:08.200]  because the order has come down.
[53:08.200 --> 53:11.400]  So what you've said, for example, about Atrazine,
[53:11.400 --> 53:14.960]  making amphibians alter their gender expression,
[53:14.960 --> 53:15.960]  you know, making the frogs game.
[53:15.960 --> 53:17.200]  It's 100% true.
[53:17.200 --> 53:20.720]  We've confirmed much about pesticides and herbicides,
[53:20.720 --> 53:21.800]  you know, in our, in our lab.
[53:21.800 --> 53:23.640]  I'm telling you, you are on track
[53:23.640 --> 53:26.640]  and there aren't that many people willing to defend you.
[53:26.640 --> 53:30.760]  I had a phone call from a major influencer two days ago
[53:30.760 --> 53:33.640]  who called me and he said that he,
[53:33.640 --> 53:37.160]  he couldn't decide whether to defend you publicly
[53:37.160 --> 53:40.000]  because if he did, that he knows Google and Facebook
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.320]  would destroy his entire platform.
[53:42.320 --> 53:45.760]  And he was asking me, begging me, it practically in tears,
[53:45.760 --> 53:47.080]  what should he do?
[53:47.080 --> 53:49.840]  And I said, look, man, you got to decide for yourself,
[53:49.840 --> 53:52.520]  but I'm speaking out for humanity.
[53:52.520 --> 53:55.760]  Alex Jones is on Team Humanity and I'm with Team Humanity.
[53:55.760 --> 53:57.040]  And you got to decide what you want to do.
[53:57.040 --> 53:59.240]  But yeah, if you tell the truth, if you defend Alex,
[53:59.240 --> 54:01.120]  you're going to be absolutely destroyed on these platforms.
[54:01.120 --> 54:04.160]  But Alex, people are calling me about this issue.
[54:04.160 --> 54:06.440]  I just wanted to be on the record about that.
[54:06.440 --> 54:07.280]  Let me throw this out.
[54:07.280 --> 54:08.480]  I mean, we, we, we go in the next hour.
[54:08.480 --> 54:10.880]  I know you got to go soon, but I want to get into Bitcoin.
[54:10.880 --> 54:14.440]  I got a call this weekend and they were pretty hot.
[54:14.440 --> 54:15.280]  And then later they said,
[54:15.280 --> 54:17.280]  well, don't give the specifics.
[54:17.280 --> 54:19.120]  First it was, you can, you know, kind of go there later.
[54:19.120 --> 54:19.960]  Well, don't go there.
[54:19.960 --> 54:23.800]  But a very famous military veteran who has the TV shows,
[54:24.960 --> 54:26.320]  that they're begging him to do all the shows.
[54:26.320 --> 54:30.480]  They said, well, we want you to do this big hit show.
[54:30.480 --> 54:31.320]  And it's going to be, you know,
[54:31.320 --> 54:33.080]  on these bigger channels than ever,
[54:33.080 --> 54:35.480]  but you've got to come out against Alex Jones
[54:35.480 --> 54:37.240]  and you've got to denounce him.
[54:37.240 --> 54:38.880]  And the guy told us through you,
[54:38.880 --> 54:40.720]  but it, see, it's a litmus test.
[54:40.720 --> 54:42.760]  Because as you said, the order has come down.
[54:42.760 --> 54:44.920]  They're literally, we're going to kill babies.
[54:44.920 --> 54:47.360]  The humanity sucks, the human era is over
[54:47.360 --> 54:50.000]  and all of the world, there's pro-human parties.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  It's not even like you said, capitalists versus whatever.
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.240]  It's not even, no, it's pro-human versus anti-human.
[54:55.240 --> 54:58.280]  This is literally a directive.
[54:58.280 --> 55:00.440]  And you've got a so-called ruling class
[55:00.440 --> 55:02.200]  that has to sign on to this.
[55:03.360 --> 55:06.280]  They have stopped threatening me, by the way.
[55:06.280 --> 55:09.440]  They have, whoever has been behind this all these years,
[55:09.440 --> 55:10.560]  they've stopped threatening me
[55:10.560 --> 55:13.280]  because they know I'm not going to turn against humanity.
[55:13.280 --> 55:15.400]  They know I'm on team humanity.
[55:15.400 --> 55:17.400]  I'm going to defend your right to speak, Alex.
[55:17.400 --> 55:18.560]  I'm going to defend your right
[55:18.560 --> 55:21.400]  to sell high quality nutritional supplements as you do.
[55:21.400 --> 55:23.400]  As I know, because I've verified in the lab,
[55:23.400 --> 55:25.400]  you sell really high quality products,
[55:25.400 --> 55:27.920]  very high quality, very clean products.
[55:27.920 --> 55:30.120]  I am not going to turn against humanity.
[55:30.120 --> 55:31.160]  So they've stopped bothering me,
[55:31.160 --> 55:33.320]  but they're going after everybody else in the industry
[55:33.320 --> 55:34.920]  and they're trying to get people to turn against you
[55:34.920 --> 55:37.880]  and promising them wealth and riches and power.
[55:37.880 --> 55:40.800]  So look, this is the cosmic question.
[55:40.800 --> 55:43.360]  Do you turn against God?
[55:43.360 --> 55:44.960]  You know, those influencers out there,
[55:44.960 --> 55:47.720]  do they join Satan, have a contract with the devil
[55:47.720 --> 55:50.720]  and get riches and get influence and get power
[55:50.720 --> 55:52.200]  by turning against humanity?
[55:52.200 --> 55:54.600]  Because that's the offer that's being made
[55:54.600 --> 55:56.480]  to people all across this industry.
[55:56.480 --> 55:58.760]  And those of us who stand for humanity,
[55:58.760 --> 56:01.720]  we are being vilified, defamed, slandered, punished,
[56:01.720 --> 56:06.000]  economically sabotaged, deplatformed in every way possible,
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.840]  lie after lie written about us,
[56:07.840 --> 56:09.600]  but here we still stand firm.
[56:09.600 --> 56:11.760]  I just, you know, I've got something to say
[56:11.760 --> 56:13.200]  about Bitcoin and Rogan here,
[56:13.200 --> 56:15.600]  but I wanted to call in today and say, Alex,
[56:15.600 --> 56:19.440]  I recognize you brother for what you're doing for humanity,
[56:19.440 --> 56:21.520]  and I am with you in this fight.
[56:21.520 --> 56:25.040]  Humanity can survive, but we have to stand up now,
[56:25.040 --> 56:26.280]  or we will be destroyed.
[56:26.280 --> 56:27.120]  Well, Mike, I want to say this,
[56:27.120 --> 56:29.440]  it makes me sleep better at night knowing you're there.
[56:29.440 --> 56:31.600]  And it's not about, once people realize what we're up against,
[56:31.600 --> 56:33.160]  it's not like you're a hero to fight this.
[56:33.160 --> 56:35.720]  This is literally, you're a scientist,
[56:35.720 --> 56:38.440]  you've done incredible broadcasts on this.
[56:38.440 --> 56:40.320]  They are trying to kill the earth
[56:40.320 --> 56:42.560]  and implode the atmosphere and poison every,
[56:42.560 --> 56:44.520]  they're trying to kill the plankton.
[56:44.520 --> 56:47.840]  And I mean, we are under attack.
[56:47.840 --> 56:49.840]  We are under some kill switch has been thrown,
[56:49.840 --> 56:54.040]  whoever's behind it, the elite are in like meetings,
[56:54.040 --> 56:56.640]  interdimensional meetings with fricking aliens.
[56:56.640 --> 56:58.920]  And I'm not the one into this, they believe this.
[56:58.920 --> 57:01.400]  This is the religion, they're recruiting,
[57:01.400 --> 57:03.680]  they're in seminars when they're on these drugs
[57:03.680 --> 57:05.880]  and wire headed in to all this crazy crap.
[57:05.880 --> 57:08.600]  We are facing an absolute collaborator,
[57:08.600 --> 57:09.880]  this is the invasion.
[57:09.880 --> 57:12.400]  And notice, they never attack me when I say all this,
[57:12.400 --> 57:13.400]  because they know it's true.
[57:13.400 --> 57:14.800]  I imagine how discrediting they think would be
[57:14.800 --> 57:16.160]  to say all this, no, they don't touch it.
[57:16.160 --> 57:18.880]  They make up slave colonies on Mars and I've ever said,
[57:18.880 --> 57:20.080]  because this is their religion.
[57:20.080 --> 57:22.200]  And you're a top programmer, you've been around,
[57:22.200 --> 57:25.120]  you know this, I mean, this is their religion, man.
[57:26.520 --> 57:28.400]  It's terraforming, it's poisoning the atmosphere,
[57:28.400 --> 57:30.240]  they're trying to shut down photosynthesis,
[57:30.240 --> 57:32.040]  they're trying to kill off the ecosystem,
[57:32.040 --> 57:33.360]  while claiming they're saving the planet,
[57:33.360 --> 57:35.240]  they want to collapse the food supply,
[57:35.240 --> 57:36.080]  they want to call that a much more.
[57:36.080 --> 57:37.680]  Yeah, they're the guardians saying,
[57:37.680 --> 57:39.080]  humans are killing the earth,
[57:39.080 --> 57:40.120]  then they start killing it,
[57:40.120 --> 57:41.080]  and then they're the good guys.
[57:41.080 --> 57:43.320]  See, we told you it's gonna die.
[57:43.320 --> 57:44.640]  Oh my God, we'll be right back.
[57:44.640 --> 57:45.960]  They're a death cult.
[57:49.960 --> 57:54.960]  ["Best Selling Supplement Family in the World"]
[57:58.600 --> 58:00.920]  By leaps and by bounds,
[58:00.920 --> 58:03.840]  the number one best selling supplement family
[58:03.840 --> 58:07.600]  in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[58:07.600 --> 58:10.520]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins
[58:10.520 --> 58:12.960]  and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[58:12.960 --> 58:14.560]  that sure get you a quick boost,
[58:14.560 --> 58:16.320]  but burn out in just a few hours
[58:16.320 --> 58:17.680]  and have terrible side effects.
[58:17.680 --> 58:20.640]  We have developed, hands down, from our research,
[58:20.640 --> 58:23.600]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink,
[58:23.600 --> 58:27.080]  pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[58:27.080 --> 58:29.520]  If there's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[58:29.520 --> 58:33.000]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use,
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.320]  packaged, mixed in with fruit juice or water,
[58:35.320 --> 58:36.560]  whatever you like.
[58:36.560 --> 58:38.040]  Warning though, it's very, very strong,
[58:38.040 --> 58:40.480]  it lasts 10 hours, so take a half packet
[58:40.480 --> 58:41.320]  the first time you take it,
[58:41.320 --> 58:43.760]  because TurboForce is named TurboForce

[58:53.840 --> 58:56.520]  best selling, highest rated products

[58:59.960 --> 59:02.880]  who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel
[59:02.880 --> 59:04.520]  that is the strongest out there
[59:04.520 --> 59:09.000]  and we private label it and we sell it for $10 less online
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.600]  than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[59:11.600 --> 59:13.800]  We also have another product also produced
[59:13.800 --> 59:16.480]  by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[59:16.480 --> 59:18.920]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel

[59:53.160 --> 59:56.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:56.240 --> 59:59.680]  Yes.
[59:59.680 --> 01:00:04.280]  When you don't hear it, you may not hear it.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.400]  When you listen to it, it's when you hear it.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.120]  What does alien mean?
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.680]  We'll talk about it the next second.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:35.320]  of this world not normal, not natural, not of the genesis. And what's the Bible all about
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.760]  and God having to destroy the life on earth to cleanse it of what had happened? It's the
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:46.760]  same story over and over again. So think about that and understand that globalists have all
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.280]  this hidden knowledge, a lot of it, and they're using it against humanity instead of using
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.760]  the knowledge and power of humanity. Some stations don't care there's five minutes,
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.120]  so this is a Bitcoin thing next segment, Mike, but MikeAdamsNaturalist.com. I wanted to talk
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:04.840]  to you about, just in general, why the establishment seems like they're so incredibly panicked.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:10.760]  Because this isn't just, oh, this is their time for their offensive. They're behind,
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:15.080]  they're pissed, and they've put the heat to all their minions that you are going to carry
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:20.560]  out this operation and demoralize and break these people's will right now. And I think
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:25.880]  the enemy is in deep trouble and has basically cut loose all their backup forces. And if
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:30.520]  people don't bow to this and just stay the course, I think we're going to win some big
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.160]  developments. There are some folks that don't want this planet to go to the next level,
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.400]  but I mean, at a gut level, I say we're already winning.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.760]  There has been a concerted multi-vector effort, as you know, you're well aware of this, to
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:48.320]  poison the minds of the people with chemicals, with fluoride in the water, with toxic pesticides
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.360]  in the food, with 5G cell towers and so on. But what's new to understand about this is
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:57.400]  it's not just about causing lobotomies like with the mercury in vaccines. It's in the
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.840]  flu shots given to children in California. I've got that on a letter from the Secretary
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.240]  of Health of California. They inject children with mercury. It's not just about the health
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:12.040]  implications, Alex. It's about making them spiritually vulnerable. And I know this is
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:18.120]  going to sound a little bit out there, but spiritually vulnerable to true demonic possession,
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.800]  demonic influence, demonic possession. This is the biblical cosmic war that is taking
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:29.400]  place in our world today. When you see these leftists go insane over a bloodlust of murdering
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:35.840]  children and celebrating it, standing up and applauding it, that is not a human response.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.360]  That is a demonic response. Some of these leftists, not all of them, but some of them
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:46.640]  are now literally consumed and controlled by demonic spirits. But getting there requires
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:53.080]  attacks on the human neurology, attacks on consciousness, attacks on the divinity, the
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:58.840]  divine spirit, the God-like spirit that is in every real human being. That's the war.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:03.120]  We get infested and attacked because we are special.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.600]  Well that's right, but they have to create a weakness and they use chemicals and they
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.440]  use assaults on your neurology to make you vulnerable to a spiritual infection.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.720]  And Hollywood knows this. So in every movie, it's like, oh, the golden child, the devil
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.040]  can't kill, until we can give the blood of a baby they killed of the golden child and
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.160]  corrupt the golden child, then we can kill them.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:29.600]  And remember too that satanic and demonic forces, they market themselves, so to speak,
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.600]  as liberty to the youth. They say you should be free to do anything you want without any
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.680]  boundaries, without any authority, without any overriding rules, no ethics, no morality.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:45.320]  You are free. Here, join Satan. It's marketed as freedom, but it's actual enslavement to
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.320]  that demonic force.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.280]  And that's why they didn't like Walt Disney. He wasn't perfect, but he was, he, you know,
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.360]  Pinocchio. They got to get the kids to be criminals first, then they lose their protection
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:59.040]  and become slaves. They become donkeys and are loaded on the slave ship.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:04.160]  They're exactly right. So what we are actually facing, the battle of our realm right now
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.040]  is not simply a political battle. It's not an economic battle. It's not even a battle
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:14.080]  of left versus right. It's a spiritual battle. It's an end times book of revelation battle.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:19.240]  No, I agree. And why are these demons? They're so dumb. It's like, they're like slimer, but
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.720]  they're able to conquer us.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.680]  Well, it's like zombies, you know, you, you can't reason with a zombie. You can't negotiate
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.680]  with a zombie. So it's just like, you can't reason with liberals. You can give them all
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.080]  the facts in the world and they reject them.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.200]  Because it's an attack force broadcast. There's obviously a bigger intelligence behind it,
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:40.840]  but their armies seem like they're mindless. No, it's just they're single minded.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:44.880]  And those who have intelligence and have wisdom and have consciousness break out of it eventually
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:49.400]  if they get influenced by it and they wake up and that's what's happening. A mass awakening
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.400]  worldwide.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.360]  Man, I tell you, this is, this is the ultimate truth. This is what it is on this planet.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.360]  It's a secret.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.360]  We'll be right back.

[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:40.240]  All right, coming up. I'm going to open the phones up right through to the end of the
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.240]  broadcast.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.240]  Stuart Rose going to pop in.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.160]  He'll take your calls with me on the great state of the union. The clips, it's all coming
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.160]  up. What were the best parts?
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:49.720]  What were the worst parts? I should probably give the number out though. About 30 minutes
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.720]  ago I said, hey, we're going to open the phones up. I'm going to open the phones up. Specifically
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.560]  on what do you think the best parts of the state of the union were versus the worst parts?
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.240]  And what do you just make of the Democrats openly becoming, like shaking their heads
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:05.080]  like Trump, we don't want to kill babies after they're born. They're like, no, we do, we
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.080]  do.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:12.680]  And then we've helped bust people that are child trafficking. No, no, that's bad. I mean,
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:17.000]  they're just coming out in the open. But going back to Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, he's
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.480]  a programmer. He's a researcher. He's an author. You know, it's a big lab that does a scanning
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.360]  of a product. So he's a, he's a jack of many scientific trades, a renaissance man, you
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.360]  could say.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:33.120]  And I wanted to just get his take on, you know, these articles, the dark side of Jack
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:37.760]  Dorsey's Bitcoin push on Joe Rogan and people at first were like, really, they're involved
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:41.480]  in SEC violations. Well, when you don't tell somebody, your main sponsor is something. And
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:45.080]  then the fact that they're trying to make the Bitcoin, you know, the main operating system
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:49.640]  of it. And then you don't tell people when you're telling them invest in it. That's very
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.280]  unethical at any level.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:08:05.040]  So the number to join us is 877-789 Alex, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539. And we will take your phone
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:10.840]  calls. But Mike, getting into this, obviously, I'm not against cryptocurrencies. I understand
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.880]  the Federal Reserve's fiat. I'd like to have a thousand different currencies and whatever
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:17.760]  we choose is the best and that becomes dominant. But I want five or six big ones, a hundred
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.760]  big ones, whatever.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:25.560]  Here's Jack Dorsey. We want a planetary currency. It's going to be run by Twitter. Twitter's
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.040]  going to face scan you to be able to communicate with people. And then we're going to have
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.880]  our moderators who can't talk bad about Bitcoin. He's already done all this. And then there's
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:38.680]  Joe going, oh, how wonderful. Not telling anybody what they're watching. This was a
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:44.160]  really shickening pump and dump. I mean, if you look at Jack Dorsey, he dumped Bitcoin
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.880]  right when it was starting to go down. That's insider trading. So now is he wanting a dead
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.680]  cat bounce, a second group of suckers? Or is it because his platform Square Cash is
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:58.520]  based on it? I mean, obviously he says he wants it to be the global currency. So it
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:03.400]  sounds like some lofty visions he's got. Who do you really think Jack Dorsey is?
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:08.440]  Like you, Alex, I am opposed to central bank control over the money supply. And I'm pro
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:15.200]  crypto theory. I like the idea of a decentralized money supply. However, my research has led
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:19.960]  me to conclude. And remember, I started warning about Bitcoin a year and a half ago and took
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:25.720]  a lot of heat for that. But my research leads me to understand that Bitcoin is a creation
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:32.200]  of the deep state. Bitcoin is used to launder money and to move money surreptitiously so
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:40.200]  that deep state operatives can bribe, pay off and fund specific targets. For example,
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:45.280]  my research and certain sources that I have that I can't name yet, tell me that in fact
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:53.840]  the Mexican drug cartels are paying off demo to oppose a wall off in Bitcoin and see Bitcoin
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.040]  allows the movement of money, but it requires a critical mass of public participation in
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.920]  order to provide cover. So you have to get a lot of people involved in order for Bitcoin
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:06.400]  to have value and fluidity, where someone can trade Bitcoin for something else such
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:12.600]  as gold or cash. So according to my research, certain key Democrats are taking Bitcoin,
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.560]  and then they're using it, they're trading it for gold or other precious metals, which
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:22.160]  can then be held and kept anonymously and at a future date sold off anonymously without
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.680]  creating any traceable transactions. But at the same time, Alex, and this is key, this
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:32.160]  is how they were trying to trap you with Bitcoin. What they can do is they can selectively
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:38.400]  prosecute people for engaging in pump and dump schemes. Anybody who promoted Bitcoin
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:45.320]  that is on the target list can be said to have been involved in a fraud or a scam or
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:52.000]  financial losses when Bitcoin went from 20,000 down to $3,500. Meanwhile, the globalists
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.040]  never get prosecuted because all prosecutions are selective. So I got to say, Alex, you
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.440]  dodged a huge bullet. I think that they would have you in jail right now if you had been
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:07.000]  pumping Bitcoin, they would have arrested you, and they would have charged you with
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.280]  financial fraud. But yet people like Rogan and Jack Dorsey and others can do the exact
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.640]  same thing. But because they're part of the protected class of the deep state insiders
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:20.480]  who continue to pump these things, they are never prosecuted just like Hillary Clinton
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.160]  is never prosecuted. That's my summary of it, Alex.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.640]  Powerful elaborate.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:34.120]  Well, so where this is going is of course total government control over ever transaction.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:39.560]  When you use a cryptocurrency that's controlled by the NSA, and by the way, the NSA wrote
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:43.840]  the original encryption algorithm for Bitcoin. There's no doubt in my mind that there's a
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:47.520]  backdoor into Bitcoin and the risks are enormous.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:52.040]  Well, that's what the blockchain is. It's finally a way to track all transactions.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:57.760]  Yeah. Well, it's a shared online spreadsheet where every transaction is tracked by every
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.160]  person who is participating in it.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:04.000]  You know, they've got an editing tool where they can plant stuff.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.520]  Look, I have no doubt they've got backdoors built into Bitcoin, but they're still trying
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.880]  to push it because this is the way to sucker everybody in while they pump and dump. They
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:18.160]  keep whiplashing the market and just taking money from people.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:23.040]  But where is this money going? See, remember Gary Webb, the journalist. He was murdered
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:31.920]  by the CIA for exposing the financial line to, was it the cocaine trade or the heroin
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.920]  trade?
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.920]  It was cocaine.
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.920]  Yeah.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.560]  It was cocaine. Now, that's what they used to do. They used to move cocaine to raise
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.560]  money for the CIA.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:45.000]  That was their black money. That was their secret money. And now it's Bitcoin.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.680]  Now it's Bitcoin. See, that's it. Used to be cocaine. Now it's Bitcoin. So they have
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:51.440]  to keep Bitcoin alive so they can continue to use it.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:55.440]  Exactly. So they're, they're, so the dead cat bounce is they're bringing in more suckers
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.440]  to keep it on life support so they can keep running money through it.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.840]  That's right. And ultimately, the people who are pushing Bitcoin now, they don't care
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:06.400]  about the Federal Reserve. They don't care about liberty. They don't care about decentralization.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.520]  The big ones I'm talking about, what they care about is having a money laundering and
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.680]  money funneling system so they can continue to fund their deep state operation.
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:18.600]  And it shows that Bitcoin has always been controlled because you've always had the cryptocurrencies
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.520]  and Jack Dorsey is like, no, it will be the one. It's the only one. And we don't care
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.840]  if it's popular or other ones. We use this one.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.040]  And the tech giants are merging with the deep state. I mean, it's already happened. So you
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:34.080]  look at Twitter, Google, Facebook, they are now an extension of the deep state and they
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.440]  are, they're one and the same at this point. So of course they're going to try to
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.640]  They always were Mike. And that's what I'm saying is we forced their uncloking. I think
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.640]  they're doing all this out of a panic.
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:49.000]  Well, absolutely the same way that they are censoring you and me and everybody else who's
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.760]  speaking out about this, they have to control all speech, all thoughts, all history, like
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:14:00.040]  Orwellian style, and they have to control every transaction, the entire money supply.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.360]  And this is how they can commit also economic sabotage, because if they can track you, they
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:09.800]  can also shut you off. They can say you can't participate in this cryptocurrency system
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.800]  because
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.240]  Yeah, like Jack Dorsey says, you're banned for life. Well, that's what the article says,
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.120]  the dark side of Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin push on Joe Rogan is like the way they censored
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:25.040]  on Reddit everywhere else, when Bitcoin tried to stay dominant, they're like, oh my God,
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:29.520]  they're now going to be in your finances, actual leftist censors are going to be involved
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.200]  with your whole financial history right in front of you. Again, it's all about robbing
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.960]  privacy. Everything they've done is about that with the cell phones and all of it.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:44.240]  Yeah, and there's no doubt. It's obvious Joe Rogan has signed up to be one of the front
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:49.960]  men for the deep state. No doubt he is in with them. He has always been a conformist
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:55.440]  with Hollywood. He's always wanted to get popular and have influence no matter what
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.840]  kind of ethics or morals were required to get there. And frankly, you know, that's,
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:04.160]  that's his decision. But that's not my decision. And that's not your decision. We operate with
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.160]  morals and ethics.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.720]  He doesn't get he called me last night. I didn't take the call, but I heard from his
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.720]  friends that were calling me this morning, what it was about. He's like, please stop,
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.440]  dude, I don't want to go out against you. You've now joined the dark side. You've now enlisted
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:21.680]  completely. And so you become a target. I mean, I don't know what he thinks I do. Like
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:25.960]  this is not a game here. This is this is what we do. Right. Right. Look, they should know
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:30.960]  by now they can't turn you. They can't turn me. There are others like us who stand firm
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:37.480]  and and we are all in man. This is not just our lives are in our souls are in this fight.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:40.120]  We fight for humanity. End of story. Not negotiable.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:44.480]  Exactly. And they think they're scaring us. I'm scared of not being with God. Like they
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.560]  cannot scare us. Like I've seen who they are. I'm like, God, I'm like hanging on the helicopter
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:53.120]  skids in the fall of Saigon. Like God take me with you. I think I'm worried about these

[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:35.160]  tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.800]  been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.400]  thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.880]  help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such

[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:16.960]  a national stand. Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now. We

[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:12.720]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:23.440]  All right, I made the joke earlier. It becomes a key window in the global government, cash
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:29.360]  for societies, how they manipulate people, what the system thinks is a successful weapon
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:38.480]  system against humanity. So that reason I have pledged to do a detailed vivisection
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:48.720]  on Joe Rogan politically, a dissection. So that will be happening. We're going to go
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:52.200]  to your phone calls here in just a moment. But I should start getting into this great
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:56.520]  state of the union and I'm not sure leading for Trump. There's a lot Trump's doing like
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:00.680]  his new NAFTA deal. He claims is great. It gives all the tech giants the right to censor
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:05.600]  whoever they want. So that'll be fought in Congress. But didn't matter. You're now a
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:11.640]  hero if you say we shouldn't kill babies after they're born. I mean, one day of the system
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:16.440]  as it's way they'll say, birth is when we eat a baby or birth is when we hang out by
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.360]  their toes. You know, it's like conspiracy theorists claim that once there were things
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:27.240]  called mothers, but now we grow the hams and tanks and eat them. Do we always have little
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:34.000]  fork tails? Yes, you always did. After the mutation. I mean, it's just, and of course
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.120]  that sounds insane. That's what I mean. It's just the mental illness of the knowledge of
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:41.320]  evil. We have the knowledge of good already. The knowledge of evil is like cancer. It's
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:47.760]  like the knowledge of going crazy. And so it looks schizophrenic because there's schizophrenic.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:53.720]  It's crazy people. And then we say, Hey, don't sexualize kids. Don't do all this. They go,
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:57.960]  Hey, we're going to do it. Go away, crazy man.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:03.360]  They tell you, you're crazy for doing the opposite of what they're doing. And all you're
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:07.080]  doing is covering how they're crazy. That clips actually coming up next segment. But
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:12.080]  here is President Trump because that's what the doctor said. And that's what they do
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:16.880]  in places all over the country. The laws haven't been passed because all the lawsuits and things
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:21.920]  that are happening, Planned Parenthood's lobbying to get it legalized to keep babies alive after
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:27.240]  birth because it's what they're doing. So in the organs, that's why they're so desperate
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:31.320]  to like God almighty. We've been harvesting a ton of these kids and people are gonna find
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.520]  out the mothers are gonna find out how much money they could have got. Even their psychotics
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:37.600]  like us that they could have gotten hundreds of thousands of dollars for these, for these
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:48.280]  levers and other goodies, other giblets, other little giblets. It's so sick. So then they're
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:53.480]  trying to normalize. Yeah, we can make him comfortable, kill him after they're born. I'm
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:23:02.320]  a fine southern human though. So it's all right. And then I'm the bad guy. In fact, later
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:06.600]  I'll get to this. I saw it this morning. I sent the crew. It's the Joe Rogan stuff.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:14.760]  He's like, Jones is in a bad place. He plays the clip. Jimmy Savelle kidnapped children
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:19.360]  and tortured them to death in dungeons and had group satanic sex parties at morgues with
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:26.400]  the bodies. That's BBC reporting where he worked. Joe, I know it's crazy to have sex
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.160]  with dead kids at morgues. It happened. It's admitted.
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:39.160]  Let's see. Joe Rogan can't handle that. He just goes, Jones is crazy instead of typing
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:46.960]  in Jimmy Savelle secret dungeon discovered. Jimmy Savelle sex with dead kids at morgues.
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:53.280]  It's confirmed. It's admitted. It's a giant British pedophile network. Dead kids dug
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:59.760]  up on the on the estates. In fact, we search into Jimmy Savelle. Since I said it, just
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:07.440]  type in Jimmy Savelle. And if he isn't the spitting image of what if I went to hell,
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:10.160]  I would expect to see it. Hell's gates. Or I'll type it in the phone here. We can't do
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:16.880]  it. There he is. Now, now, now, now, folks, that's a guy that procured children for prime
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.600]  ministers and others. And man, they even later confirmed like one prime minister. They played
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:27.560]  like plastic out his thing. Favorite thing was little brunette girls with blue eyes.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:34.280]  Very expensive. Very hard to kid now. But they lead a man with the plastic on the floor.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:42.520]  And then Savelle would slit their throat ear to ear. And then the prime minister would
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:47.760]  masturbate over the dead body. Now, you know, oh, there it is. Oh, go that's big street
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:52.240]  news. I'm sorry, Joe Rogan. See, Joe's like, can you believe the sickness of Jones? Put
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:57.960]  us back up for TV viewers. Yeah, yeah, zoom it out. That's me. What is that London Telegraph?
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:03.960]  BBC. Back it up, please. How BBC star Jimmy Savelle allegedly got away with abusing 500
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:12.640]  children and sex with dead bodies. So Joe, you said I was in a bad place. I am in a
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:18.400]  bad place, man. I actually know what's going on. I want to stop. I'm not some candy ass
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:24.240]  out in LA trying to act cool, saying Alex Jones has defamed Bill Maher. Bill Maher
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:28.640]  makes jokes about how 12 year olds having sex with 35 year olds is okay. And the name
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:39.440]  of his production company is Kid Love. That is the slogan of Nambla. See, see how that
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:52.680]  works, JoJo? See how that works, JoJo? JoJo? Jo, the snake Rogan. Yeah, John of God, faith
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:59.560]  healer kept teenagers and sex slaves and sold their babies for up to 40,000 pounds before
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:10.240]  shipping them from Brazil to Europe. And what do you think happened to the babies in Europe?
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.520]  Let's just say it's not pretty. A lot of stuff. A lot of them are kept alive. Their blood's
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:22.240]  blood off by vampires. This drink, these vampires don't actually live forever though. So yeah,
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:28.440]  I'm not for blood drinking kids. I just, yeah, here's the deal. Joe Rogan's on blood drink,
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:32.880]  no kid, blood drinking team. I mean, he's doing it, but you signed up with Jack Dorsey,
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:43.840]  a flaming demon lying psychopath. So give a sense, Jo, it's my duty to come after you.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.520]  And then once it's my duty, I admit, I kind of get a little fired up and it's not the
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:54.840]  coming of me, but I don't like destroying people, even if they're evil. So God made
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.720]  us, the Lord works in mysterious ways. Let's just say I'm not into raping and torturing
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:05.880]  little kids. I am into going after people that are involved in it. And when I get my
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:12.820]  hands on you, when I get my hands around your neck and all of your fake so-called male
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:19.040]  prowess, you will understand and you will know. So you think I like the fact that I
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.160]  know they're murdering kids right now and sucking their fricking blood and then you
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:28.760]  won't man up and say it's wrong. Joe Rogan, you've got one last chance to get down your
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:32.400]  knees to the Holy Spirit and ask Jesus Christ to cleanse you because I don't believe you
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.280]  don't know all the stuff. You're smart. When I was on your show, you knew everything I
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:42.760]  knew and more. I've known you 21 years and you're smart, but you're a devil. And your
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:47.640]  old logo was a devil, a space alien, a space gray with a devil on the other side. Can I
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:57.320]  tell you, the devil is the, yeah, Joe, look, we already know, but Christ always offers
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:05.640]  that last chance. You understand? Let me tell you, I wouldn't want to get between God and
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:10.280]  what people have done to the children. No, look up his old logo from his old website.
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:17.040]  He shut off. It was, it was a half of it. I'll show you. It was like a gray alien on
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:23.800]  one side and a devil on the other. But you're like, wait, there's symmetry. It's the same
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:37.800]  thing, which it is. So you think you're going to get all our kids? Nine. Nine. And all we've
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:41.480]  got to do is set our will against these people. You set your will. That's what we're scared
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.800]  of. Your will is trillions of times more powerful than theirs. Set your will, commit, stop being
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:53.160]  afraid, and all of a sudden God pours in on you. And then, then you know. Open the gate.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:54.160]  Bring Christ in.

[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:23.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:33.720]  news report. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:37.760]  Alright, so what was the most powerful points in last night's state of the union? What were
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.360]  the most disgusting points? I haven't gotten a lot of these. I'm going to your phone calls
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:45.520]  right now. Shirt Rose is coming on next hour to co-host with us. I've got a little satire
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:49.080]  piece I'm doing on Joe Rogan's, so I'm obsessed with that right now. I'm starting the next
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:58.000]  hour. A little sneaky snap to join us in the studio. So that's all coming up.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:09.400]  The first thing I want to do here is just say this. I support President Trump because
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:19.360]  my guts never been wrong and the older I get, the learner just go with it. But he's surrounded
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:27.240]  and he's got major problems. And I don't need to list all those or buy pretty much
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:34.120]  those problems. We just can't put all our eggs in the one basket. Trump, you can't put
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:40.480]  all your eggs in this basket. You can't put all the eggs in your own basket. We all have
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:44.880]  our own hopes and dreams. We hope our children can fulfill them. All our hopes and dreams
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:52.600]  go with them. That's why they're attacking them. They're the future. And it's a real
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:59.240]  war for the future. And my biggest regret is I just don't have enough strength or energy
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:03.440]  to do what I really should do for people. And that's why I hate it when you call in
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:14.480]  and tell me how great I am. Listen. When you're fighting people, their whole religion is about
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:19.520]  torturing children. It's obnoxious to tell me I'm great when I'm doing that. That's
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:27.000]  normal. And I use the allegory. They got famous cases where a car comes over on some little
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:33.920]  kid and mom gets so upset she can pick the car up. I've been trying to pick the car
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:45.000]  up. I can't do it. And even though I spiritually am stronger than I have been, I can feel my
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  legs getting weak under the enemy's attack. And I can feel my body giving out. And then
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.520]  I just ask myself, who are the other people that are going to fight this? And I see some
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:05.200]  prospects out there. But you know, most people just can't handle the truth. They just can't
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:14.600]  deal with it. So I just don't know what to say. I just can't believe we're in this position
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:20.200]  that the president's a hero because he says we shouldn't kill babies after they're born.
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:28.800]  Man, imagine that. That's so freakish. That's so sick. So you know what? I was gonna say
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:35.360]  today that President Trump defending babies that are already born was the best part of
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:41.880]  the speech. You know what? It's the worst part. I watched this like six, seven times
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:50.320]  last night. I probably watched it 10 times this morning. I probably watched it 20 times
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:55.560]  actually. Then I went and I knew I had to see it. I had to see it. I went to 30 minutes.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:02.800]  I found cutaway shots of Democrats were looking at him like they wanted to kill him when he
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:12.320]  didn't want to kill babies. At a certain point, I don't know what we're supposed to do at
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:25.400]  this point. I mean, it's just what the hell is going on here? He'll tell you all day about
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:29.400]  if you call a tranny the wrong name, you're going to go to jail. But if you want to kill
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:35.760]  a little baby because you want the damn organs, that's good. These people are just horrible
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:44.440]  because they're not people. They're demons. And I already knew that, but it's the realization
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:58.080]  that in February 2019, the underdog is the people protecting babies that are already
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:03.120]  born. But hell, you're going to kill them in the womb. Why not go even exactly? And
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:06.320]  the case for killing granny and let's get rid of old people because we'll have a better
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:12.680]  world once we get rid of everybody. We build a civilization on taking care of people. Again,
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:16.120]  the enemy says they're trying to save the earth. They're trying to kill the earth. They
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:25.000]  say they care about old people. They want to euthanize them. And America and the world
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:33.880]  is like caught in a trance. It's a trance. It's a spell. People are literally physically,
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:40.120]  mathematically mesmerized by television and the flicker rates and all the systems. There's
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:50.880]  a dark ancient evil force, not of this world. You can give it a name, you can postulate,
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:39:01.720]  but you don't know what it is. It's a torpedo. The earth is a womb, an egg, giving birth
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:07.840]  to an amazing species. I mean, in our dreams as embryonic creatures, we've already built
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:18.600]  all this. Can you imagine what we are? But any egg is a plump, juicy treat because there
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:29.000]  isn't just big, beautiful, good things in the universe. There's snakes slithering, watching,
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:36.720]  coiling, feeding. I want to hit this gap again, his piece after this piece, but here is the
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:43.720]  president speaking blasphemy. The killing children, is it good? Satanism in front of
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:50.100]  you. The bad guy says, don't kill already born children. Oh, but there's no Satanist
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:59.000]  killing children. Here it is. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:06.640]  of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:16.320]  days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:24.640]  allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth. These are living,
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:30.360]  feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:38.040]  with the world. And then we had the case of the governor of Virginia, where he stated
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:47.640]  he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:55.600]  to pass legislation to prohibit the late term abortion of children who can feel pain.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:14.760]  He gives me power over the babies. She's literally salivating like a giant T bone steak
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:19.840]  that just came off the grill is being pulled back from her. And we come back the most powerful
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:25.320]  footage in your calls. He says, we're stopping child kidnapping. We're stopping sex gangs
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:31.000]  that the Democrats are like pissed. I mean, they're making hard cold cash on that baby.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:37.640]  And usually you're going to stop a bunch of smugglers like Cortez. He's stopping nothing.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:44.640]  We're going to bring these people in. Schumer, all these people. We're going to break. Please
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:50.000]  don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, without your support, without your prayers, we're
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  nothing. And I'm in your hands. It's that simple. I appreciate you all. InfoWars.com,

[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:47.560]  AAA-253-3139. It's the final countdown. Certain forces want to strangle humanity in the crib.

[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:13.000]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is

[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:35.400]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world. There's nothing

[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:45.040]  to use, packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like. Warning though,
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:49.080]  it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half packet the first time you take
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:54.400]  it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive. Turbo
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:56.200]  Force at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:03.200]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:10.920]  there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:18.360]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:24.120]  like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won. They don't want us to
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:29.880]  have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did. And that's why
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:34.760]  the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut InfoWars down. This is a fight about
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:40.080]  taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away. This
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:45.360]  country is in a war. So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:48.840]  you if you don't spread the articles and videos and if you don't financially get the great

[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:19.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:23.880]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:36.640]  Waiting for the sun, man. The island without pain, heaven.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:49.920]  I'm going to go to your phone calls, but because I mentioned it, I'm going to do it. These
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.920]  videos, if you're a radio listener, I'll try to describe them, are so horrible. I don't
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:48:07.560]  sit there and look at the women's consortium of Democrats and feel good that they're so,
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:15.200]  not just physically ugly, but so twisted and mentally ill and fake and slovenly. We were
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:20.000]  the first to put memes out saying, you know, because they say everything's KKK when it's
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  not. So, oh, they're all wearing white. Obviously they're saying we're goddesses, we're pure,
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.840]  we're good. We kill our babies, though, but, you know, that's not a goddess. But they're
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:34.800]  all wearing white, having no idea that obviously if Republican women did that, they'd say
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:40.360]  they were in the KKK. So the memes are all out there. Democrat women were white, KKK,
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:45.480]  and searching. I should have told you about it. But we put some out last night. But there
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:51.200]  they are, and it wasn't just a few times, Trump would say, we're stopping child kidnapping
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:56.000]  and women being kidnapped and they get pissed. And we're doing this. And as you realize,
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:03.560]  when Pelosi said that MS-13 are God's children, you have to understand, folks, these are the
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:09.680]  muscle of these people. Literally. They're into all this. That's who they use for their
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:14.840]  dirty activity. They give the word and then the guy in prison gives the order to kill
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:21.360]  people. And then you just hear it's a carjacking gone bad. These are killers. They're low IQ
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:28.920]  killers. And so they're pretty arrogant because in their cities and their areas, let me tell
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:34.400]  you something, these people get away with everything. And the globalists will turn America
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:42.600]  into a cross between Venezuela and North Korea and the Soviet Union faster than you can say,
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:51.960]  kiss my hand. So the more things change, the more they stay the same. I mean, if the Democrats
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:56.760]  weren't the party of the KKK, if they weren't the party that passed laws to give blacks
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:01.640]  three times the prison sentence for nonviolent crimes that Trump just reversed, then it wouldn't
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:07.840]  happen. It's a joke how bad they are. They're the bad people. The Republicans are a bunch
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:17.720]  of intimidated cowards and half of them are bad too. I've never seen anything like it
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:22.720]  in my life. I just did a certain point. I'm having flashbacks. The problem is I study
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:25.720]  all day long and then once I get on air, it's kind of like I've already looked at it. I'm
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.920]  like, I'm almost like I'm doing something bad. Like, let me show you this. It's like,
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:34.040]  it's like, you think I want to get up here and go there splicing babies with mice for
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:38.720]  organ harvesting? I knew it 20 years ago. Now it's mainstream news. So I'm just credited
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:45.880]  because I'm right again. Folks, I wouldn't steer you wrong. They had a gun to my head.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:50.360]  Everybody knows that. Like there's all this damn evil in the world. And then I'm real.
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:54.280]  I can't sit up here and act like goody two shoes. Sometimes I'll tell a dirty joke. I
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:51:01.360]  don't like women because I like having babies. But man, I don't like the devil. And everybody,
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.720]  do you understand, you're not going to get somebody that's going to take on the devil
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:10.000]  most of the time that acts like Jesus Christ because I'm not perfect. And I don't want
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:16.360]  it. The point is, is that I try to be a nice person. But I've been in this so long now
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:26.320]  that when you got up to fight this stuff, it's like Joe Rogan said, Alex is not well.
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:32.480]  It's true. I'm not well. I don't, I see people saying we're going to kill newborn babies.
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:36.640]  And it's a good thing. And it makes me upset. See, you're well. You know, they always said
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:47.680]  the in the kingdom of the blind, the one eyed man is king. See. And so I'm just a normal
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:52.120]  person like a throwback. I did the programming didn't work on me. I'm like from somebody
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:56.560]  from like 1920s that teleported into the future. And I watched the state of the union and the
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:00.960]  president saying, we don't kill babies after they're born. And then he's the bad guy. And
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:05.600]  you know what? I get pretty freaked out. I start wanting to unscrew some people's heads.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:10.800]  I start wanting to kill people. I'll be honest. As a man, hearing about babies getting killed,
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:16.440]  you know, that's what a man does. Man starts getting passed. And I'm supposed to cut the
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:21.760]  emotions off because I might like these sociopaths. It's like a past. I have deep emotions and
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:25.480]  I get pissed at myself constantly that I'm not doing enough for all these children with
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:30.680]  these damn demons, raping the hell out of them. So I was going to ask everybody again,
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:34.880]  what am I supposed to do? I don't know. What are you supposed to do? But just don't ever
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:40.000]  say it's extraordinary to fight people who are like this. It's the default. And if you're
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:48.120]  not doing it, then you're on the enemy side, period.
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:54.640]  These godless, selfish people that serve evil are jokes. You know, at least the devil worshiper
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:58.040]  loves the devil and wants to torture a kid to death. But the people that know what's
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:02.680]  going on, that make deals with it, they're what allows the evil to exist and they're
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:09.120]  the worst. Like God said, you were hot or cold. I spit you out of my mouth. I know the
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:18.160]  devil. I know the sick twisted psychology and the whole game. But the people that decide
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:25.200]  to serve it, even though they don't have a taste for it, are the real people that I
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:36.880]  look forward to. I'm not a sadistic person, but I do look forward to you begging for God,
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:41.800]  begging like those children beg. You're going to beg Joe Rogan so hard. When you're before
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:46.880]  you're gone, you're going to beg God. You're going to beg and beg and God's not going to
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:55.880]  come. You understand? God's not coming. God's not coming for tortoros or tag dorsi or any
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:07.680]  of you. So you better take as many kids with you as you can because when those gates close
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:15.520]  and you're separated from God, it's not going to be funny anymore. You're not going to be
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:20.520]  in charge anymore. You're not going to be sitting up with the establishment believing
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:27.880]  that you're administering everything. Oh, yes, you administer nothing. You failed the
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:35.800]  test. You're a failure. And you look at those Democrats. I didn't know they could stack
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:42.400]  trees in that high. I didn't know there was such a weak, pathetic worms that be recruited
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:51.080]  and organized. I didn't know such mentally ill low IQ garbage slithered on this planet,
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:55:04.160]  but they do. And our blindness has let them take over our spiritual weakness, our attempt
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:11.600]  to make deals. It's all over now. All right, we'll go to break him back with calls. I promise
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:16.920]  sugar on top. Pinky promise. But let's play a few of these clips here. Here. Let's play
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:23.440]  Alexander Cortez. That's not even the bad one. Failed to applaud stopping sex, traveling
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:28.000]  of girls and like 30 seconds in, they go, Hey, get up, lady. I mean, you talk about
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:39.760]  a meth head. Here it is. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:48.240]  One says that if I can make sure these young girls that look on pluses, I've really done
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:57.600]  my job. Thanks to his work and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:06.360]  and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation. And more than
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:14.240]  1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:29.840]  But Cortez is just on her own little planet. That's what a slave looks like. Will not clap.
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:35.120]  They grab her, tell her stand up. It's on her clap, clap, clap. She would clap. She's
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:41.720]  a ruling class, man. Look at her eyes. I mean, that is a demon driven creature. Okay.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:48.640]  Literally, yeah, for a gray alien. Let's go ahead and go to this next clip. Camilla Harris
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:53.360]  shakes head at Trump combating cartels and human traffickers because that's her bread
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:55.760]  and butter, man. Here it is.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:01.920]  How is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:11.160]  immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:21.760]  out of business? God, look at Schumer. I mean, God, I might as well just say.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:42.560]  We have a moral duty to create an immigration system. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen,

[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:27.520]  We're on your calls. The worst part of President Trump's speech was what I thought was the
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:33.960]  best part. But in hindsight, it's the best part that he says we shouldn't kill babies
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:40.200]  after they're born. And then Democrats boo. I mean, this is Twilight Zone, man. The Democrats
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:45.040]  are for all these wars. I don't want to let black people out of jail. I mean, it's like
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:01:02.120]  these people have uncloked as howling demons. And it's hard to beat them. We've been putting
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:07.480]  on a trance or something. I just don't even know what to say at this point. I guess that's
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:10.720]  why I'm going to go to your calls. What was the best part of Trump's speech? What was
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:18.400]  the worst thing you saw from the crowd? Or maybe you think Alexandria Cortez shaking
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:22.240]  her head or Camilla Harris shaking her head like we're stopping sex slavery and we're
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:29.800]  going to know you're not going to stop it. I mean, it's like, who are these freaks, man?
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:37.880]  Who are these freaks? Like this governor in Virginia, we keep the baby comfortable in
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:47.480]  we. I mean, it's like, what? And the directives come down, normalize killing children, normalize
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:53.400]  killing everybody. Just kill, kill, kill, kill. Bernie Sanders, America will never be a socialist
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:02:00.680]  country. Bernie Sanders, a crook that robbed universities and just a swindling, just sack
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:06.520]  of inhuman trash. Lobbying that owes socialism is the way to go when the big bankers he works
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:14.120]  for want socialism with the general public because they're exempt from it. Just a sack
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:22.520]  of garbage. An insecure, demonic, praying person just every minute of his life has been
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:27.880]  about how he is the best and he's better than you and he's going to get controlling you.
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:32.280]  I'm telling you right now, Bernie Sanders got control of America. It'd be linen level
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:36.960]  red terror. Christian churches will be burned down coast to coast. People will be hanging
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:41.080]  up by their feet, you know, just like they did with the Arab Spring. They're the same
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:46.680]  globalist fund of the Arab Spring because they hate Christians and they hate women and
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:55.600]  they hate the Western Renaissance egalitarian system because it'll take us past the stars.
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:00.520]  Past infinity. Because infinity is only in this universe and he knows it and he's literally
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:06.920]  a gatekeeper sellout who purchase. Let's play the clip. I'm going to your calls. Here's
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:15.440]  Bernie Sanders, this worm, this, this, this, this, this demon perched on our chest trying
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:22.040]  to suffocate us and he's just this arrogant degenerate. Here he is. Here in the United
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:35.680]  States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:43.920]  founded on liberty and independence and not government coercion, domination and control.
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:57.600]  We are born free and we will stay free. There is the enemy right there. Look at that sack
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:10.600]  of crap. I'm so scared. I mean, how do you even respond to something? If you're a regular,
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:15.760]  you're so lucky not having to look at Bernie Sanders. Didn't have a paying job till he
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:30.600]  was 42 years old. The definition of a total sociopath. He's so pissed you've got a soul.
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:35.640]  He's so pissed you're a good person. Hates you so much. Every moment of his day is just
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:40.840]  how does he hurt people? How does he poison America? He went to Russia when they had Christians
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:45.840]  and death camps and celebrated and dance in the streets with a shirt off, satanic dances.
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:54.840]  And he wants to hurt you so bad he will. If you let him, your calls are one minute away.
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:05:12.120]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:17.800]  energy drinks and energy supplements. But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:22.280]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:27.680]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects. We have developed hands down from our research,
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:34.480]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world. There's nothing
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:39.320]  else like it. You must experience it. It is a total game changer and it comes in easy
[02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:44.120]  to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like. Warning though,
[02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:48.160]  it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half packet the first time you take
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:53.880]  it because Turboforce is named Turboforce because it will take you into overdrive. Turboforce
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:06:19.360]  and enforcelife.com. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:31.880]  I'm going to host some of the next hour when I will interview Joe Rogan, satire included.
[02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:39.560]  Let's go ahead. Joe will be like, and did he? He said I was coming on but I wasn't.
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:45.800]  It wasn't true. It's called satire, buddy. By the way, brought to you by Jack Dorsey's
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:52.320]  wife, plug. Sorry. Getting better. Getting better. I just, best part of the song right
[02:06:52.320 --> 02:07:01.040]  here. Crank it up. Cemetery Gates. I go walk by those sometimes. All right. I have one
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:11.080]  of your phone calls. Joe, Bill, Alex, Andrew, Rudy, Judy, Debbie, Ted, Doyle, Cameron, Brad.
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:20.040]  Who's up first here? Who should I go to first? Yeah, a lot of the globalists tricked us into
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:24.200]  their social networks, made it 90% of the Internet, and now uses a bully tool while
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:33.400]  claiming they're not censoring. What a group of crooks. Let's go to Doyle first in the
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:39.480]  great state of Indiana where Mike Pence hails from. Go ahead, you're on the air. Yes, God
[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:46.440]  bless you, Alex. I have a question. They're using the term post birth abortion. My question
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:53.960]  is what's the time limit after the birth to kill the baby? Because I'm almost 60 and
[02:07:53.960 --> 02:08:00.840]  I could be, you know, I'm post birth. And the fact that you said it's an alien invasion,
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:06.880]  and when they abort babies, they suck their brains out. And it's like the movie Starship
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:12.720]  Trooper, where you have these big bug aliens that suck people's brains out? Brain bugs,
[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:16.640]  exactly. They're telling you the whole deal. Well, the Satanists do eat baby brains. That's
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:21.920]  their favorite. That's the delicacy. It's been confirmed. Jimmy Savelle did it. Joe Rogan's
[02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:25.920]  like, Jones is crazy. He says that Jimmy Savelle was having sex with dead kids and eating their
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:32.320]  brains. It's in the BBC. I mean, I know it sounds like I'm crazy because that's crazy.
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:35.920]  But if I'm telling you that I saw a homeless person on the side of the street eating their
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:40.560]  own feces, I'm not the crazy one. I'm like an anthropologist, a sociologist telling you
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:47.440]  what I saw. But Joe either knows what's going on, is covering it up, or he just can't believe
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:55.200]  it. But you're absolutely right. You bring up this whole situation. Here's the deal. Baby
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:09:01.640]  parts and organs are up to $500,000 per baby, depending on how you do it. But if you can
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:07.880]  keep them alive and blood test them, then you're able to get donors, people, recipients
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:14.080]  ready. You can get $100,000. A baby probably only worth like $100,000 on the chopping block
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:18.440]  if you sell it to a medical research facility when the baby's cold. But if you can get the
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:22.520]  organs out, get them on ice, get them ready, then you get a lot of money. So they keep
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:28.640]  these babies alive a couple weeks. I tell the mother, you decide your baby's got a problem.
[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:32.560]  My love. That's actually what the governor is a surgeon that did this. We now know. That's
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:36.440]  why she's an expert. And then the mother's like, okay, she's all drugged up. She signs
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:45.040]  the forms. The baby's kept alive a week on a special wing, special nurses, special doctors.
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:51.280]  And then yeah, exactly. Now it's like suddenly, oh, post birth abortion, eight pound, nine
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:58.120]  pound, 10 pound, 7.6 pound. That's the average. I was 7.6 pounds, the average. That's what's
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:04.360]  going on. And, and then it's all just the government don't need to get involved here.
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:13.040]  Like the governor said, we take care of it back there and no special, special wing of
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:18.400]  the hospital. And so that's the next big shootup. Why they want me off here? Because I'll take
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:24.800]  you the next level. Why is he hiding in plain view that they kill him after because they
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:29.320]  need the bills because people are now onto it. You know, Planned Parenthood's been caught.
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:32.000]  Criminal indictments have happened. A bunch of the settlements have happened because they're
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.760]  keeping the babies alive. I'm going to say it again. It's like a fish tank. Let's say
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:43.320]  the fish are organs. If you keep the water going, what happens with the fish? They stay
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:48.920]  alive. So if you're wanting to sell some fish, you wouldn't take the plug out while you're
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:53.680]  putting ads on eBay for your salt water tank. You'd keep it, keep them feeding them and
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:57.800]  taking care of them. Because you could probably sell those fish in that salt water tank for
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:03.040]  $1,000. I got a salt water tank. It's probably got $1,000 of fish in it. Okay. Some of those
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:06.800]  fish are like eight years old. So I'm taking care of it. But the point is, is some of those
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:12.520]  fish were like $500 apiece. So if I unplug it, they all died about a day. And I don't
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:22.000]  get anything except this tank sale. But if I keep the air going, $10,000. So see, you
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:29.120]  got to keep the little baby. We keep them comfortable while we, while we get ready for
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:37.800]  the, all the airplanes land, they've got the ice chest. And then the procedure happened
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:42.480]  and the organs sold. Now, is that diabolical oil?
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:51.680]  Oh my gosh, it's beyond diabolical. It's just, I think Americans cannot process the evil
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:56.280]  of the last. We just can't imagine it. We can't process it. And that's why they're
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:12:00.080]  getting away with so much of it. Exactly. It's like another language. We just, it's
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:05.120]  like, what? Yeah, it can, can I say one other thing?
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:11.240]  Go ahead, brother. I was just wanting to ask you, I think that if you wrote a book and
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:16.160]  put it in multiple translations, you would get around the sentence and you would sell
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:22.640]  100 million copies. The only problem is they death threat any publisher, they fire everybody.
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:25.920]  Sir, if you knew the stuff behind the scenes, it's, it's, I mean, I don't make a big deal
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:29.040]  out of it because I mean, I'm not a little kid getting chopped up. So I don't want to
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:34.160]  act like I'm under it. I mean, I expect to be under attack, but it's cuckoo land attacks.
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:38.240]  But yes, we do want to try to put some books out. We would do want to get the basics out
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:42.480]  and then get around. But I mean, people understand it's like, you can still get t-shirts to date
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:46.720]  M4 Wars. You can still get products. They're trying every minute to shut us down. They're
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:51.720]  working around the clock and I agree. I need to make a film that's a magnum opus and I
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:55.880]  need to put a book out and just say, here's my testament and here's what's going on.
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:59.800]  And we just need to get it done. The problem is I'm so busy at the parapet in constant
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:06.080]  war that I can't get down into the, you know, into the study and actually put together the
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:10.800]  final transmission. And I don't want to be dramatic, but I mean, I think everybody knows
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:15.640]  we're kind of, you know, I have to sit here every day going, well, do I tell people we're
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:19.600]  in a lot of trouble, which is true, or I just keep fighting and I just, I just can't seem
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:24.320]  to, I just can't seem to sound the retreat. So I'm just going to stay here at the, at
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:29.400]  the point as long as I can. And I believe in you. I believe in God and I appreciate your
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:35.960]  brother. God bless the oil and I appreciate this crew to putting up with me. I just, it's
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:42.400]  a very, very crazy point in this universe. Let's go to Debbie, Debbie in New Jersey.
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:45.400]  Debbie, thanks for calling. I really appreciate you. Go ahead, Debbie.
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:49.120]  Thanks, Alex. I'm not going to tell you how great you are. I'll just tell you that you
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:54.120]  stink and you stink so bad that we take your stickers and we put them on our checks and
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:58.120]  envelopes and every time we mail something out, we make sure everybody knows we support
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:00.800]  info wars. Thank you.
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:11.160]  We also magically, they appear on stop signs too down here, but the thing I found most
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:17.960]  interesting about the speech was the abortion issue as well. The fact that he said that
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:26.280]  not securing the border was an immorality and his genuine salute to the veterans was
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:33.280]  very touching. We really enjoyed that. That was nice. Oh yeah, trust the real deal. Yeah.
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:41.360]  Yeah. And the shifting of Nancy Pelosi with those dentures, I wanted to just slap that
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:47.920]  bitch right across the mouth. I'm so sick of her ugly face. I am too. God, she's a
[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:52.200]  demon. I'm glad, I'm glad put, I mean, I'm glad that God put term limits. I'm sad my
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:56.240]  grandmas and grandpas are dead. But you know what? Death's a term limit on evil people.
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:58.520]  And it's a term limit on good people too, but you know, she's got a term limit. She's
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:00.840]  got an expiration date.
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:09.760]  Yeah. Yeah. Did you check out Schumer's evil eyes? His face looks like a witch mask.
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:13.000]  Oh, exactly. He's flaming evil.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.360]  Yeah. Yeah, he makes me, he probably makes me mad.
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:23.240]  You know that this is from good sources. His boyfriend is Anthony Wiener. Seriously. I
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:26.880]  believe you. Nothing surprises me.
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:29.800]  Let me finish up with you, Debbie. And then we've got Stuart road, popping, but he's gonna
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:32.440]  take calls with us. He's got a lot to say. We got more of these clips. Well, you're on
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:36.320]  fire. I wonder if you and the Judy and others folks. Listen, I don't want to get up here
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:41.600]  with all this dark stuff, but it's going on. So let's just admit it. Let's own up to it.
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:47.960]  Let's face it. Let's do it. The children are counting on us for ourselves for it for our
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:55.120]  children for us all. Let's just do it. Let's commit.
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:59.600]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem. Learn how to get sober after we share these
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:04.240]  stories. I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:09.600]  out of control. After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:15.680]  often and using prescription drugs. After my second DWI and arrest, my ex husband threatened
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:20.960]  to take our children away from me. I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:28.680]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't. It hit me when I was arrested. Get sober now.

[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:03.840]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:07.880]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people

[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:30.280]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:35.400]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:42.240]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.,
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:48.040]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:57.160]  World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:33.680]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:34.680]  Jones.
[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:37.840]  I'm Stuart Rhodes riding a shotgun while this is taking calls. We're all talking about the
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:44.320]  same thing. Founder, health keepers, veteran, constitutional lawyer, good friend of mine.
[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:48.320]  You know, I really fought with this last night, and this morning I kept watching the clip.
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:52.520]  I mean, I'm not exaggerating, 15 times, six, seven times last night, 10 times this morning,
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:55.560]  my wife at breakfast is like, why do you keep watching? I said, there's something about
[02:20:55.560 --> 02:21:01.240]  this clip where Trump defends not killing babies after they're born and the Democrats
[02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:04.760]  all boo and get pissed. I was like, this is the best clip of the night, and then it hit
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:12.080]  me. No, it's the worst clip. We are so far down the rattle of Satan's whatever it is
[02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:20.800]  that now saying we shouldn't kill already born babies is rare. I want to finish up before
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:25.160]  you go Stuart Rhodes, Debbie holding over. Funny you said that. Everybody in the studio
[02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:29.400]  last night today said, and I'm not calling for violence against Pelosi, God never, but
[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:33.760]  they just want to slap the dentures out of her face, the weird neurotic clicking and
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:39.560]  everything, and then Camilla Harris frowning and shaking her head when we were stopping
[02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:47.800]  child kidnappers. No, you're not. And Alexandria Cortez, you know, won't clap when we're talking
[02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:53.520]  about stopping sex slavery. I mean, these are freakazoids and their extremism has gotten
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:22:03.240]  so bad that the very worst of them becomes the blue ribbon, the pole position, the standard.
[02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:07.760]  So finishing up, Debbie, because you were on fire earlier, it's not about hating them.
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:13.920]  For me, it's about it's embarrassing. Like, how do we have a group of people this bad,
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:18.160]  this evil, this stupid ruling over us? It makes me feel like crap.
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:23.520]  You know what, Alex, it's because we're on such an elevated plane, the people who are
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:34.120]  awake. We're so elevated in this dimension that it sickens us and makes us so ill physically.
[02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:40.360]  It's just, it's so hard to look at people like that and want to even be kind to them
[02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:49.640]  because they just turned your freaking stomach. But the other thing I wanted to say is Cortez,
[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:55.280]  she looks like a rabid Boston terrier with those bulging eyeballs of hers, too. She really
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:56.280]  is demonic.
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:23:03.520]  You know, we can laugh about her and I do, but it's like, it's like Beto in his fake voice
[02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:10.120]  and how corrupt he is. It's like, this is their superstars, Beto or Rourke and Alexandria
[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:14.920]  Cortez, these people are idiots. And I'm not trying to be mean, it's just true.
[02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:20.320]  Yeah, yeah, no, it is. It is. Alex, I'm going to let you go, but I want to let you know
[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:27.960]  that my husband and I have every t-shirt, every product. We give it away. We gift it
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:33.680]  because we love you. We love the info warriors and everybody there that works there. We really
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:40.240]  think the world to you people. And I send Reiki to David when he was going for a surgery.
[02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:46.080]  I'm a Reiki master and we are also lifetime oath keepers. Thank you, Stuart Rhodes. We
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.080]  love you.
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:51.440]  Thank you, Debbie. And let me just say this. I was in meetings this morning with the Countains
[02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:55.840]  at the lawsuits they've got against us and we beat like 15 of them. So they filed like
[02:23:55.840 --> 02:24:02.080]  five more. And I was just looking at this and it was like, the enemy turns up the heat.
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:07.040]  You give us product purchases that just meet the level we need. We need financial support,
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:11.600]  folks. We need to say that. I mean, it's insane. The attack we're under and the fact that we've
[02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:14.880]  sustained thanks to you is amazing. So thank you all.
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:19.600]  Stuart Rhodes, constitutional lawyer, veteran, founder of Oath Keepers, oathkeepers.org.
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:22.600]  So much happening. Very powerful speech. I wish you would have gotten into more internet
[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:26.520]  censorship because it's new NAFTA rewrite, you know, obviously gives the tech companies
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:30.080]  a lot of power that will get negotiated in Congress. You also worked in Congress for
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:35.080]  Ron Paul. But just your overall snapshot, Stuart Rhodes, of what we saw last night in
[02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:40.800]  the 76% major polls, even though they're fake polls, it probably means 85%, 90%. This was
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:45.080]  a big victory where they actually got to hear the president. What's your view?
[02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:50.840]  Yeah, exactly. I think he did very well at presenting himself as a sincere uniter who
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:56.280]  cares about the American people across the board. And the prison reform in particular
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:01.960]  cuts against this, you know, the false label of him being racist because obviously prison
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:07.160]  affects so many black people. As we all know, they tend to go to prison for drug crimes
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:12.520]  far more than whites who use cocaine. It's just, just well known. One thing I do think
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:17.800]  he could do is to even further down that road is by legalizing marijuana at the federal
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:22.680]  level and advocating for that and pledging that even if they're Republicans, but a few
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:28.840]  of them won't do it, even if they won't do it, then he will pardon people who are nonviolent
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:31.480]  drug possession prisoners in federal prison.
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:34.120]  Ooh, that's a great idea. Mass pardons.
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:39.440]  Absolutely. It would drive a massive wedge on the left and bring even more people into
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:43.960]  the walkaway movement, which is what you need. You need to go out there and find the people
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:49.200]  who have been brainwashed by the left and conditioned and find a way to reach them. And I think
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:53.360]  drug legalization of marijuana at the federal level is, well, it's, it's a constitutional
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:57.680]  thing to do. It's right. It's the right policy, constitutionally, limit to the states, but
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:25:58.680]  it would drive a massive wedge.
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:01.800]  You got a lot of points to make, but let me ask you this question. And he's tried to
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:04.640]  do that. He's been blocked by sessions and others. Maybe it'll get through now, but that's
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:06.920]  common sense. It makes sense.
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:10.600]  Why are the left so tone deaf to shake their head when we're going to free women and sex
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:14.720]  slavery or children or we're going to stop MS 13 and then the Democrats are so defensive
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:20.280]  of that for my Intel, which is not just Intel, the left's working with the smugglers skimming
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:24.720]  money off all these legalization lawyers, immigration lawyers. I mean, we're talking
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:29.800]  about their soldiers, not just Antifa, but the real is MS 13, Mexican mafia. That's why
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:31.880]  they're so defensive of it.
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:36.680]  Well, sure, but you have to differentiate between your average rank and file support
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:41.160]  of the left or voter in the Democrat party and the leadership and the, you know, intelligentsia.
[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:45.040]  Of course, you're ever going to reach them. They're unreachable. The courtesans of the
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:50.560]  world and, and Bernie Sanders are all ideological Marxists, but the average college student can
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:53.840]  be reached. And the one way to reach them is, is, you know, I think prison reform did
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:58.720]  a good job, but I would also decriminalize marijuana and set those people free as well.
[02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:02.600]  That would be a massive wedge. It could be, could be a huge watershed moment.
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:07.960]  No, I agree. I'm just saying what is wrong with the Democrats to boo when Trump says,
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:11.520]  we don't want to kill babies already born. I mean, they're even more evil than I thought.
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:14.200]  I know they're into this, but now they're out in the open.
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:18.840]  Yeah. Well, that's, that's the thing is that's, that's what worries me is they believe that
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:25.360]  they have a lock on political power. So sure that they can go ahead and take the mask off
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:30.640]  and show what they really are. And it must be because they believe that they have successfully
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:34.560]  outmaneuvered Trump on the immigration issue and they're going to have, you know, massive
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:39.240]  numbers of new voters. That's the only thing I can think of is they plan on, you know,
[02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:43.080]  even the walk away movement is not only bothering them because they can figure out, well, eventually
[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:47.640]  we'll have 30, 30 million or 40 million new Democratic voters by bringing in illegal
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:50.040]  aliens and giving them the right to vote.
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:53.840]  So Trump has to stop that. That's another thing he didn't do last night. He did pretty
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:58.880]  decent on talking about the sex, sex slavery, but really he should have had a survivor of
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:04.720]  sex slavery there in the front row of a young female who had been taken here as a child
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:08.320]  and enforced into sex slavery. And he should have been blunt about what they endure, you
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:14.320]  know, being forced to, being raped by 30 men per day as guests, customers of the cartels.
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:18.720]  That's pretty horrific experience. And so to have that front and center and having the
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:23.440]  Democrats sit there silent and not applaud her would have been even a better victory
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:25.000]  for them.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.440]  You know, I demonize Democrats and then sometimes think, Oh, no, I can't go far enough. They
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:37.840]  are just such scum. It's like the other callers said, because we're not into evil. We just
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:43.560]  can't even imagine it. It's like, it's from another planet, literally. We'll be back to
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:48.120]  Stuart Rhodes, more phone calls, stay to the union club straight ahead. And then I'm going

[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:53.040]  All right, we're back live broadcasting worldwide. Stuart Rhodes, our guest founder of Love Keepers,
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:56.680]  constitutional lawyer, patriot, veteran. I'm going to go to your phone calls now because
[02:33:56.680 --> 02:33:59.400]  you're all on the same topic. We're all here together. I'm going to host you in the next
[02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:03.400]  hour. Push Roger Stone back 30 minutes. God bless him. He knows it's part of hosting the
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:09.520]  fourth hour. Sometimes I take over, but I wanted to bring this up to Stuart Rhodes. Stuart,
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:14.800]  what did you think was the best part of the speech versus the worst thing? Because we
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:18.440]  heard that paradox I got into earlier where I was like, oh, it's great. He defended arty
[02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:25.080]  born babies. But it's like, no, that's really Twilight Zone horrible and trying to be demoralizing
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:29.960]  here. I just like, this is pathetic that this guy's embattled because he says, don't kill
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:33.280]  arty born babies because they want to get their organs. They want to set the precedent
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:37.000]  and keep them alive because again, they can parlay out the body parts so they can keep
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.480]  them alive a week or so and get the jets ready and the ice ready and, you know, make money.
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:45.920]  Because there are arguments like, hey, this baby's worth $500,000, you know, let's not
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:51.520]  just a sanguine, it's blood and collagen for high end cosmetics for women's lips. You
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:55.320]  know, let's let's get full dollar on this, but you got to kill born babies. So they,
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:59.800]  they moved that ball down the field. And you should have called him out on that. I
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:04.680]  believe he should have been very overt about the money that Planned Parenthood makes and
[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:09.240]  then how they, they contribute then to the political careers of all of these legislators
[02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:13.520]  who benefit directly from it. He should have been very overt about that. So, you know,
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:17.520]  I think he did a good job, but I think he could have been more aggressive when it comes
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:21.840]  to calling him out on the worst of their own agenda. It's very hard to defend. I think,
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:25.920]  I think plenty of people even on the political left are starting to wake up because of the
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:26.920]  overt infanticide.
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:30.400]  Well, exactly. They, they tried to steal the election from Ted Cruz, who I think is
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:35.320]  a great guy overall. I mean, super smart, great Patriot. I mean, compared to Beto O'Rourke,
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:42.000]  it's like night and day, but the word is I've heard so many Hispanic Texans and others,
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:45.680]  they tried to steal it. They thought they had to steal about 10 points, but so many Hispanics
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:50.080]  learned that he was for late term abortion. They just couldn't do it. I think that's the
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:54.520]  Achilles heel of the globalist trying to brainwash his Spanish into being leftist is if we reach
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:57.640]  out to them and point out, Hey, they're the party of killing babies. That it's like, you
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:02.200]  know, even the archetypal Tony Montana of fiction wouldn't kill kids, no women, no kids.
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:05.080]  I think, I think, I think this is a lie in the sand. Like you said,
[02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:11.920]  That's an excellent point. They're very much culturally conservative. And of course they've
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:16.080]  been brainwashed and conditioned by the left to think that the left is the only ones who
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:19.840]  got to stand up for them. That's why Beto goes by Beto, right? He's not even any part
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:24.040]  Mexican. He says, I, he's an Irish guy, but they, they're doing identity politics thing.
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:28.120]  I think you're actually correct. It's much like the spirit killing turned off a lot of
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:35.080]  Hispanics or the spirit, what do they call it? Spirit cooking. Exactly. That, that costs
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:41.000]  Hillary quite a few votes. I think the infanticide in your face, demonic infanticide will do
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.840]  the same thing. You're right.
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:48.120]  Cause people say where they'd say in polls, but when people get like, if I vote for killing
[02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:53.040]  babies that are already born, I'm, I'm in bed with the devil. I mean, this is, it doesn't
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:54.320]  get any clearer now, does it?
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:58.400]  No, it doesn't. That's exactly right. And then, and he just makes that connection and
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:03.280]  say, look, this is not about, you know, being any women. That's why it's so important also
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:08.920]  to hammer on the fact that tens of thousands of children and young women are brought into
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:14.520]  this country as sex slaves by the cartels. Hammer on that, educate the American people
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:15.520]  of the reality.
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:21.960]  I agree. Why do you think Harris and Cortez on video shook their heads and got mad when
[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:27.640]  Trump said we were saving women and sex slavery in children? I mean, they know the optics.
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:28.640]  What are they signaling there?
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:33.760]  Well, they're trying to signal this is all bullshit. That's not true. That somehow Trump
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:37.880]  is lying. It's why he needs to have a survivor standing right there. He needs to explain
[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:41.920]  it and teach him. It's like Ross Perot had his charts and explained the American people
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:42.920]  was coming.
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:43.920]  He should be very.
[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:48.320]  I agree. He should have had like 20 women and 10 children that were sex slaves. It had
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:49.320]  been game over.
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:53.800]  Exactly. Precisely. That's what he should do. And the same goes for the cartels. He needs
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:58.320]  to educate the American people about the reality. What he should have done with that
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:03.080]  is said, look, this is just like in Poncho Villa, right at across the American border
[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:08.160]  and kill eight U.S. soldiers and 10 civilians and Wilson responded with the military. But
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:13.360]  the cartel now is far worse than Poncho Villa. They've killed far more Americans, but educate
[02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:18.240]  Americans to our own history that it took the U.S. Army on the border before there was
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:22.680]  any border patrol to secure the border or forts all along the border and start laying
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:27.640]  the groundwork for his eventual necessity of using the military to secure the border
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:32.520]  at that. Make sure they understand the cartels are international terrorist organizations.
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:35.280]  Let me throw this at you.
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:38.400]  I thought Trump was going to declare an emergency a few months ago as the word was he backed
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:42.120]  off it. Then he let them have the government shut down that took billions of economy out
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:46.080]  every week. So it's just being executive. It's time to clear the emergency in like a
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:47.080]  week.
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:51.240]  I agree. But that's why you should have laid the groundwork. You should have said, you
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:54.600]  know, it's like his strategy. You can see what I get. Lay the predicate.
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:59.760]  Right. Yeah. Lay it out. So now he has gotten the Democrats to show the true colors of being
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:04.400]  obstruction is not one to work with them, et cetera. And on the 15th, when they refused
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:11.720]  again to compromise, he needs to then say, this is why I must do exactly what President
[02:39:11.720 --> 02:39:18.480]  Wilson did in 1916, when he ordered blackjack crocheting to take it to Pontia via his bandits.
[02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:23.080]  Same thing here. The cartels are just like Pontia via in fact, worse, far worse than
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:28.360]  Pontia via far as I know, Pontia via wasn't sex slaving women and children. The cartels
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:33.360]  are they are like ISIS. They are the Western hemisphere version of ISIS and he's hammered
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:34.360]  that.
[02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:36.920]  That's incredible. We got to come back and rush through calls here. But since I mentioned
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:39.040]  it, let's go to a few of these clips.
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:45.120]  Is Trump slams wealthy politicians for having walls? Exactly. It's like having a car doors
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:51.040]  or a screen door on your house. Of course, your country has barriers. Here it is.
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:57.680]  Tonight I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:06.440]  devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:13.360]  between America's working class and America's political class than illegal. God bless, he's
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:14.720]  so hard to look at.
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:22.560]  Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:25.240]  and gates and guards.
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:30.640]  I mean, a country is about your border. I mean, that's the first part of a country is it's
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:37.240]  ethos and then it's border and then it's military. I just believe these Democrats, I mean, these
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:42.560]  are demons. I just, much of criminals.
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:50.240]  Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration,
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:58.560]  reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded you can't get
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:05.120]  in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:10.840]  Man, you look at those Democrats, how self satisfied they look when they know that they've,
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:14.560]  the globalists have collapsed Latin America and now they're doing it here. I mean, these
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:18.240]  are some cold-blooded people. Here's another clip of the president. We're going to get
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:23.920]  it all in, but southern border security, the victims, it's, I'll go to your calls, we
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:28.680]  come back, I apologize. We're going to go right to your calls, we come back and we'll do it.
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:31.920]  We've got a minute and a half to break. I'm going to tell you again, oathkeepers.org.
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:36.120]  I'll get a t-shirt, support stories to it. It does great work.
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:42.600]  Infowars, I do not want to make our enemies happy and, you know, I don't really engage
[02:41:42.600 --> 02:41:47.720]  in Machiavellian stuff where I try to like calculate everything. I just go with the truth
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:51.640]  and so there's different thoughts like, well, let the globalists know they're hurting you,
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:55.120]  they'll attack more, but if you don't have the listeners know they're hurting you, then
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:42:03.080]  look, I just go with the truth. We need listeners to understand that they put stories out in
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:10.120]  the news that I'm worth at $500 billion so that no one supports us, okay? I'm worth $5
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:15.200]  million and that's the cost of this company that they say I've valued a bunch of equipment
[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:19.600]  and cameras that's almost worthless if I got shut down. It's all obsolete a year after.
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:23.440]  I'm not, I don't have anything but a house. I'm not about money. I'm committed to fighting
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:27.920]  these people and my crew and the great work they're doing, but I need you to buy products
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:33.360]  and you need them and then I can fight the globalists and I can win. You are literally
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:39.080]  the air which we fly through or the water through which we swim. We've got the best

[02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:07.120]  damage.
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:08.120]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:09.120]  We stopped her.
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:12.120]  We got a nationalist in.
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:14.040]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:15.040]  We are winning.
[02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:20.520]  But those of us who are at the very front line, the tip of the spear, are under unprecedented
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:21.520]  attack.
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:25.880]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:31.280]  This is about who wants it most, and you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors
[02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:32.360]  they've taken, everything.
[02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:33.360]  I am in your hands.

[02:44:55.720 --> 02:44:58.000]  Listen, I'm just going to tell this or something right now.
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:02.680]  I think our best products, our body's ultimate turmeric formula, with a 95% curcuminoid level

[02:46:56.320 --> 02:47:07.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:22.720]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:31.880]  The boys tell how much you'll fail, he left his living in cheap hotels, the desert's quiet,
[02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:38.160]  Cleveland's cold, and so the story ends with gold.
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:47.160]  Aren't you need your prayers, it's true, save a few for let it do, he only did what
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:55.000]  he had to do, and now, and now, he's growing old.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:03.600]  Stewart Rose, our guest, O-Cubers.org, don't forget the enemy is working around the clock
[02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:05.640]  to destroy us.
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:11.800]  They believe metaphysically that if we can be taken down, they somehow win.
[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:12.960]  They want our heads.
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:15.560]  They want to mount our standard to their wall.
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:20.320]  So I tell you, support Info Wars, because I never intended to be in this position, but
[02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:24.040]  we are seen as the standard in the fight.
[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:29.400]  We're seen as the scalp to take, the head to chop, the fortress to bring down.
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:33.400]  Let's not give the enemy what they want, at least keep me in the fight a little longer.
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:36.880]  Part of me gets tired and sometimes they take me out of the game, but then I think about
[02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:41.680]  the children, the innocence, and the duty we have to carry this fight on and to have
[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:43.320]  that long stamina.
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:45.680]  Stewart Rose, our guest, we're taking phone calls right now.
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:49.960]  Judy, in Florida, you're on the year worldwide, your take on what's happening with censorship
[02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:52.200]  against Christians, conservatives, and what's happening.
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:53.200]  Go ahead.
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:54.200]  Hi, Alex.
[02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:56.200]  Let's go to speak with you again.
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:03.720]  Yes, I was listening during marketing yesterday to Paul Joseph Watson talking to you, and
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:11.320]  the whole subject of the censorship of conservatives and Christians, just people, you know, on
[02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:17.960]  the right, has to stop very soon, because I agree with him, Trump will not get elected
[02:49:17.960 --> 02:49:24.080]  again if we don't have the type of strength in the marketplace that we used to be online.
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:26.000]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:29.240]  The globalists were arrogant before and ignored us, but Stewart, that's the question I want
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:30.240]  to actually raise you up front.
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:31.240]  I'm glad a caller did.
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:36.640]  And I'd say, Judy, for a comeback response, but I mean, that's Trump's greatest failing
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:40.640]  is that he's letting them, you know, this new NAFTA deal gives telecoms anything they
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:44.880]  can do, the big tech, in that area, he's letting them kill him.
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:48.520]  I mean, it's like, as you know, the censorship is just unbelievable.
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:53.880]  Yeah, he has not spoken out enough against that, or even at all, as far as I can tell.
[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:54.880]  You're right.
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:59.960]  He's a hammer on this suppression, or early in suppression of free speech.
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:03.520]  He does call him out of his fake news, but he needs to go to the other side of the coin,
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:05.320]  which is just also the censorship.
[02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:09.640]  They're not just lying about the truth, they're stopping the truth.
[02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:14.920]  I mean, your constitutional lawyer, he works in Congress, Stewart, what do you think the
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:15.920]  president should do right now?
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:16.920]  I mean, I want anti-trust.
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:18.920]  They're violating Section 230.
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:20.120]  I mean, he's got them.
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:21.120]  It's insane.
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:22.120]  Yeah, precisely.
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:27.120]  I mean, you know, it's the same frustration we have about why are there no prosecutions
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:29.120]  for the open harboring of illegal aliens?
[02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:32.960]  You can say, well, he's concerned about, you know, political backlash.
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:37.800]  When you're going after antitrust, when you're going after, you know, the clear suppression
[02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:42.800]  of free speech and collusion and conspiracy, then I think it's a different story.
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:46.120]  He needs to go after them for that hammer on them and say, I'm here for free speech
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:47.120]  for all Americans.
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:50.240]  I don't care what your political background is, and he should make a point of doing the
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:55.320]  same thing to any right-wing outlets and doing the same kind of stuff if he could find one.
[02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:59.520]  He should be fair about that, but it needs to happen.
[02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:00.920]  It's a total existential threat.
[02:51:00.920 --> 02:51:05.000]  I mean, it's for all the marbles, and that's why they work around the clock to shut enforce
[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:09.280]  down as they know the president, when he does see our info, looks into it and responds.
[02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:11.080]  Well, they can't stop you at rallies.
[02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:12.720]  They can't stop you calling Congress.
[02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:14.680]  They can't stop you writing letters to the president.
[02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:16.200]  They can't stop you.
[02:51:16.200 --> 02:51:19.680]  You, folks, it's not, stop saying it's me or Stuart.
[02:51:19.680 --> 02:51:20.680]  It's all of us.
[02:51:20.680 --> 02:51:22.200]  We're all warriors in this fight.
[02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:24.200]  Judy, you're absolutely...
[02:51:24.200 --> 02:51:33.120]  Put another email to the White House, WhiteHouse.gov forward slash contact.
[02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:38.240]  People should be writing as often as they see fit, because they do have a voice with
[02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:44.120]  the president through email, at least, while the stupid government shutdowns still in effect.
[02:51:44.120 --> 02:51:45.120]  Absolutely.
[02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:46.120]  Thank you, Judy.
[02:51:46.120 --> 02:51:51.000]  We're going to go to Andrew in Florida, talks about the devil takeover of this earth.
[02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:55.040]  If it hit the devil running it, might as well be it's just as bad as the archetypal devil
[02:51:55.040 --> 02:51:56.040]  I heard about.
[02:51:56.040 --> 02:51:58.040]  So, Andrew, thanks for holding your own ear.
[02:51:58.040 --> 02:51:59.040]  Go ahead.
[02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:00.040]  Hey, Alex.
[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:03.400]  First, I have to plug out Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:08.680]  Listen, it's so much better than Joe Rogan's Caveman coffee.
[02:52:08.680 --> 02:52:14.560]  Let me tell you, I do not get no heartburn with Patriot Blend, but the reason why I called
[02:52:14.560 --> 02:52:19.800]  is the devil, yeah, really did take over, because if you think about it, this goes back
[02:52:19.800 --> 02:52:21.360]  to the Georgia guide stones.
[02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:25.680]  I mean, why do you think they're going with this abortion route?
[02:52:25.680 --> 02:52:33.200]  Because they're trying to depopulize a generation, the upcoming generation, I mean, think about
[02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:34.200]  it.
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:38.200]  I mean, once they're done with that operation, we're next.
[02:52:38.200 --> 02:52:44.240]  That's why we have 5G and sold it to us, so they're trying to make us...
[02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:45.240]  No, I hear you.
[02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:50.280]  I mean, the whole globalist program is about anti-human, end expansion, end productivity,
[02:52:50.280 --> 02:52:51.280]  end the Renaissance.
[02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:53.120]  I mean, I don't believe in aliens.
[02:52:53.120 --> 02:52:54.120]  I don't cover aliens.
[02:52:54.120 --> 02:52:57.760]  I mean, globalists act like they're aliens trying to end human expansion.
[02:52:57.760 --> 02:53:02.720]  I mean, if you sit back and look to like, what's going on here, it's an absolute attack
[02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:03.720]  on the species.
[02:53:03.720 --> 02:53:05.520]  I think it's for the call, Andrew.
[02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:07.000]  Your take on that story, Rose.
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:11.480]  Well, yeah, it's really a natural outcome of Marxism.
[02:53:11.480 --> 02:53:17.400]  This is what Marxists are, they're anti-human, they're anti-nature, they're anti-life, and
[02:53:17.400 --> 02:53:18.400]  they're totalitarian.
[02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:23.600]  It's going to come next to the euthanasia, and if they can openly kill children after
[02:53:23.600 --> 02:53:26.920]  birth, then they could kill anyone at any stage of life, and they will.
[02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:27.920]  That's what's coming next.
[02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:30.640]  They're conditioning the American people to accept this.
[02:53:30.640 --> 02:53:32.640]  It's like a game of chicken.
[02:53:32.640 --> 02:53:35.640]  They're saying, hey, now we're going to come out in the open, and we're still going to
[02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:36.640]  prevail politically.
[02:53:36.640 --> 02:53:41.320]  And if they can successfully prevail politically in New York, despite being open advocates
[02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:44.520]  of infanticide, then they'll think there's no stopping them.
[02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:48.880]  So we have to stand up and say that this is unacceptable, and we have the pressure, the
[02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:54.160]  President, the Supreme Court, to take action to put a stop to it as fast as possible.
[02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:55.160]  That's right.
[02:53:55.160 --> 02:54:01.560]  They want to not let us kill Charlie Manson, but who admits he killed people, but, oh,
[02:54:01.560 --> 02:54:02.560]  you want to kill a baby?
[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:03.560]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:54:03.560 --> 02:54:05.200]  It's like, because they can't speak for themselves.
[02:54:05.200 --> 02:54:10.440]  It's like the most bullying, villainous thing you could imagine, and they're, did you see
[02:54:10.440 --> 02:54:14.520]  how excited Governor Cuomo and those Democrats got when they signed the bill to kill kids
[02:54:14.520 --> 02:54:15.520]  after they're born?
[02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:17.840]  It was like they were having orgasms.
[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:21.080]  I mean, because they're Satanists, it was like, in front of everyone, we're going to
[02:54:21.080 --> 02:54:22.080]  kill babies.
[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:23.080]  Yeah!
[02:54:23.080 --> 02:54:27.960]  It's like Maleficent and the little mermaid when she gets the contract, I mean, it was
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:32.800]  just like, oh my God, this is like Ted Bundy wasn't this evil.
[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:37.080]  And the more you can expose it to what it really is, the better.
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:40.840]  And I think there's a video out there of a former abortion doctor describing in front
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:45.840]  of Congress exactly what it looks like for a third term, it was a second trimester abortion.
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:48.800]  It was very graphic as explanation.
[02:54:48.800 --> 02:54:52.960]  That's what you need to do is bring out more witnesses to this is the reality of what happens.
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:53.960]  We have to humanize.
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:54.960]  Here it is.
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:54:55.960]  We have to humanize.
[02:54:55.960 --> 02:54:56.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:54:56.960 --> 02:54:57.960]  God almighty.
[02:54:57.960 --> 02:55:03.360]  I just, I'm, Stuart, I'll be honest with you, you know, you've been a veteran and a lawyer
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:08.360]  working in Congress, and I've done a lot of stuff in my life, 45 years, but just like,
[02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:10.880]  like, I just don't even get these people.
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:14.640]  I don't know how you act like this, why they're so committed to evil.
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:16.160]  What's wrong with these people?
[02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:18.560]  Well, they have been conditioned as well.
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:22.720]  I mean, they've, they've, they've conditioned themselves, and this has been the left sort
[02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:27.280]  of the left's goals, I think, or at least the leadership has been to brainwashing conditioned
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:32.640]  people, just like, just like any totalitarian society, so that they have a disassociation
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:37.640]  with reality, that you can, you can go ahead and show them a videotape of a, or, or, you
[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:43.120]  know, ultrasound of a child moving and, and yawning, et cetera, and they still insist
[02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:47.360]  that that's not a human life, but the real, the real answer for them is that they don't
[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:52.320]  care, that yes, that's a child, but so what, we still have the right to kill it because
[02:55:52.320 --> 02:55:53.320]  it's utilitarian.
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:58.840]  Yeah, they're selfish pigs, and, and so, oh, but when they get killed, it's a big deal
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:03.360]  though, and don't they get that, like, they're summoning something that's going to be, because
[02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:07.000]  I don't want any violence offensively, but I mean, let's be honest, Stuart, they're really
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:08.000]  summoning something.
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:11.280]  I, I mean, because what are they going to do when, when people say, hey, you don't have
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:12.280]  a life?
[02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:17.720]  Well, I feel like a German in, in Nazi Germany, who is looking and, and, and you know the
[02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:21.840]  trains are running, you know your neighbors being taken to the death camps, you know,
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:22.840]  what are you going to do?
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:26.080]  Are you going to do like Soros did and turn on your neighbors, or are you going to man
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:27.080]  up and stop it?
[02:56:27.080 --> 02:56:30.920]  That's kind of where we're at, and this is starting to get to the pushing point where
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:35.680]  not only do they not deny it, but we can't deny it, and what do we do when children are
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:39.760]  being murdered right there in our own country, we just sit back and we don't take action,
[02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:41.760]  we now become accomplices.
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:42.760]  Exactly.
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:45.280]  So I think, I think Trump needs to take the spearhead.
[02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:49.160]  He did a little bit last night, pretty good work on it, but he really needs to hammer
[02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:51.440]  and he needs to ask the Supreme Court to put a stop to it.
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:52.440]  He needs to do a emergency.
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:56.440]  I agree, because I mean, whatever you want to call it, the left is gone completely insane.
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:57:01.800]  And, and, and, and they're taking it, I think on purpose, they're taking us to a point of
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:05.120]  no return, and they just want that physical conflict.
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:09.280]  And then once it happens, they are going to squeal and beg and I don't want to be like
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:14.040]  this, folks, but if we, you know, once things kick off, if they do, we can show no mercy
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:16.320]  because no mercy was shown to these children.
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:18.720]  Stuart Rhodes, I really appreciate you, Okeepers.org.
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:19.720]  Thank you.
[02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:20.720]  Thank you.
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:21.720]  God bless.
[02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:25.880]  Do you, do you agree with my point about, though, if they, at a certain point, like they didn't
[02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:27.280]  give the children mercy?
[02:57:27.280 --> 02:57:32.440]  Well, we have to always be Christian in our response, but you can still fight the future
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:33.440]  enemies.
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:36.960]  So if you do it in Nazi Germany, or any other, other retaliatory, but they're going to, I
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:40.680]  don't understand, they're going to beg, though, don't put them on trial.
[02:57:40.680 --> 02:57:41.680]  They should be tried.
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:42.680]  Exactly.
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:54.640]  Put their asses on trial, right?
[02:57:54.640 --> 02:58:01.080]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:03.200]  energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:08.920]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:12.920]  that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible
[02:58:12.920 --> 02:58:13.920]  side effects.
[02:58:13.920 --> 02:58:20.280]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:23.160]  and beyond system in the world.
[02:58:23.160 --> 02:58:25.600]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[02:58:25.600 --> 02:58:30.160]  It is a total game changer, and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[02:58:30.160 --> 02:58:32.800]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:36.920]  It's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the first time you
[02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:42.480]  take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:58:42.480 --> 02:58:46.600]  TurboForce at M4sLive.com.
[02:58:46.600 --> 02:58:50.400]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents, know that they can food during the fall, so
[02:58:50.400 --> 02:58:55.600]  they'd have it during the winter, and that's what I'm talking about at M4sTour.com.
[02:58:55.600 --> 02:59:01.680]  With M4 Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply, one of the top most respected
[02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:07.760]  companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts
[02:59:07.760 --> 02:59:10.360]  that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:59:10.360 --> 02:59:14.640]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storeable food, so it's a total
[02:59:14.640 --> 02:59:15.640]  win-win.
[02:59:15.640 --> 02:59:21.520]  We have those incredible sell prices back at M4sTour.com, on M4 Select, storeable foods,

[02:59:32.760 --> 02:59:35.320]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[02:59:40.240 --> 02:59:49.400]  M4sTour.com and M4s Select, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my patriots supply.
[02:59:49.400 --> 03:00:04.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.840 --> 03:00:10.600]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:12.880]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.880 --> 03:00:21.240]  All right, Brad and Rudy, we're going to hear in a final segment with Stuart Rose, and then
[03:00:21.240 --> 03:00:28.520]  Joe Rogan in studio, big satire warning, obviously, not Joe, but I'm so cool, he called me last
[03:00:28.520 --> 03:00:32.560]  night and asked the phone, but that's coming up because it's about the globalist next weapon
[03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:33.560]  against America.
[03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:34.560]  We've got to cover it.
[03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:37.400]  Stuart Rose of Oathkeepers is our guest.
[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:39.080]  Let's go ahead and go to Brad in Pennsylvania.
[03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:40.680]  Brad, thanks for holding your own ear.
[03:00:40.680 --> 03:00:44.400]  Thanks, Alex, and happy early birthday to you.
[03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:46.640]  I love everything you do.
[03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:47.640]  You're awesome.
[03:00:47.640 --> 03:00:51.880]  Anybody who hates on you, just let it go, including Joe Rogan.
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:01:00.960]  I know you're a fighter, and I don't blame you for standing up against any kind of illegitimate
[03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:04.960]  stuff like that, but don't waste your time on it because it's not productive.
[03:01:04.960 --> 03:01:05.960]  That's just my feeling.
[03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:11.560]  No, I mean, I tend to agree with you, he just becomes like Jack Dorsey wants the global currency
[03:01:11.560 --> 03:01:16.080]  to be Bitcoin he controls with this cashless thing he's rolling out, and then they're not
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:19.520]  telling you that they're violating SEC rules when they're doing it.
[03:01:19.520 --> 03:01:22.800]  So the more I looked, I was like, gosh, this is way worse than I thought.
[03:01:22.800 --> 03:01:24.680]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:01:24.680 --> 03:01:26.040]  I know where you're coming from.
[03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:29.880]  I've been listening to you for 15 years at least, and so I know exactly what you're thinking
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:31.760]  most of the time, and I'm right on board with everything.
[03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:36.000]  Well, yeah, I feel guilty that I kind of halfway knew and ignored it for like a decade.
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:41.440]  And so now I'm just trying to, trying to like, like catch up, I don't know how to explain
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:42.440]  it.
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:47.800]  No, and hey, your son pointed it out, once Rex did that, I'm sure I fired you up.
[03:01:47.800 --> 03:01:48.800]  I don't blame you.
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:53.320]  And it was my son who said get behind Trump, like when he first announced.
[03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:58.840]  Hey, your son and your dad are the best, man, and I'm right there with you when Mueller
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:02:03.360]  comes after you and your dad, that is BS and everybody knows that he's, he knows your
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:04.360]  dad's problem.
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:07.800]  I gotta say, there's something so powerful that my son and my dad are with me in this,
[03:02:07.800 --> 03:02:09.320]  and it's just like three generations.
[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:11.400]  It's like, it's powerful.
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:14.680]  God bless you, your, your dad, your son and your girls, Alex, because that's where it
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:15.680]  all comes from.
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:16.680]  Family.
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:20.280]  If you don't, not, not if anybody who doesn't have kids doesn't understand, because I'm
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:25.000]  sure some of, some of them can, but when you have kids and you have a family, you're
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:26.000]  right, man.
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:29.880]  It takes, it's a whole different level of feeling and understanding, and that's how
[03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:30.880]  you know.
[03:02:30.880 --> 03:02:32.120]  I used to be Democrat.
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:36.920]  I used to be, I was grown up, I was raised Catholic, but then I, then I went to the other
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:43.280]  side because I was, you know, with earthly, worldly, so my wild oats, but then I came
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:47.760]  back around and laughed or listened to you and come into my senses in the last 10, 15
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:48.760]  years.
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:52.440]  I'm conservative now and glad I am and I feel so much better about my life, about where
[03:02:52.440 --> 03:02:56.720]  I am, but I feel for people who are turned over to evil and they, you know, we need
[03:02:56.720 --> 03:03:01.240]  to pray for everybody, but especially all the good people out there who need our help
[03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:06.280]  because the times, these are end times, it seems like, and I'm not, I don't know.
[03:03:06.280 --> 03:03:07.280]  No, you're right, Brad.
[03:03:07.280 --> 03:03:08.280]  Beautiful things you've said.
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:09.280]  God bless you.
[03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:11.800]  Stuart Rhodes, closing comments, what Brad just said.
[03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:12.800]  I mean, this is what it's all about.
[03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:14.400]  I know you've got a lot of children as well.
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:18.680]  I mean, they give you incredible strength because then they really invest you.
[03:03:18.680 --> 03:03:22.480]  Well, yeah, and this is our duty, it's not about us.
[03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:25.520]  We're only here for a short time, but it's about our children and grandchildren.
[03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:29.360]  I mean, if you don't, if you don't defend your family, you don't defend the children
[03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:31.520]  of your country, then what would good are you?
[03:03:31.520 --> 03:03:36.320]  It's the most basic and primal imperative, especially of us men as warriors, we need
[03:03:36.320 --> 03:03:42.360]  to be able to be willing and able to defend our own people and defend our own territory.
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:43.360]  It's a primal situation.
[03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:45.200]  Why does so many men think it's cool to sell out?
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:48.880]  I think they're smart doing it, and I just want to strangle them.
[03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:53.440]  Well, they'd be conditioned to believe that their own manhood is somehow, you know,
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:54.440]  caustic and dangerous.
[03:03:54.440 --> 03:03:58.520]  In fact, Jordan Peterson's got a pretty good article out about this right now about how
[03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:02.960]  the Psychiatric Association is attacking manhood, and it's very blatant and clear.
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:05.320]  He just came out and said masculinity's evil.
[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:08.760]  Yeah, you know, and the reason why is they can't control you.
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:12.920]  I think, I think it was one of the kickboxer, Anthony, what's his name, just talked about
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:13.920]  this as well.
[03:04:13.920 --> 03:04:19.920]  On the Twitter page, they want to stop masculinity because they fear men as warriors, because
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:22.080]  they know we can stop them.
[03:04:22.080 --> 03:04:26.280]  They know that we will stop them, so they want to neuter us and get rid of manhood.
[03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:28.560]  The classic military attack, take out the military.
[03:04:28.560 --> 03:04:31.920]  They got the warrior class, yeah, absolutely right.
[03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:33.920]  God, oh my.
[03:04:33.920 --> 03:04:38.720]  All right, thank you Stuart Rose, we'll talk to you soon, God bless you.
[03:04:38.720 --> 03:04:40.840]  You're too mad, God bless brother.
[03:04:40.840 --> 03:04:46.640]  More calls coming up, and I got this little piece coming up.
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:05:16.600]  I'll try to have some fun with this, best I can, it's fair to have a stay with us.
[03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:26.600]  And maybe you won't hear, but he'll sneak up behind you and drink all of your root beer.
[03:06:26.600 --> 03:06:33.600]  And then sneaky snake goes dancing, wiggling and a hissing.
[03:06:33.600 --> 03:06:39.600]  Sneaky snake goes dancing, giggling and a kissing.
[03:06:39.600 --> 03:06:46.600]  I don't like old sneaky snake, he laughs too much you see.
[03:06:46.600 --> 03:06:53.600]  When he goes wiggling through the grass, it tickles his underneath.
[03:06:53.600 --> 03:07:00.600]  Well sneaky snake brings root beer, and he just makes me sick.
[03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:06.600]  When he is not dancing, he looks just like a stick.
[03:07:06.600 --> 03:07:13.600]  Now he doesn't have any arms or legs, you cannot see his ears.
[03:07:13.600 --> 03:07:19.600]  And while we are not looking, he's stealing all of our beer.
[03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:26.600]  And then sneaky snake goes dancing, wiggling and a hissing.
[03:07:26.600 --> 03:07:28.600]  Sneaky snake goes dancing.
[03:07:28.600 --> 03:07:40.600]  Now that's Tom T. Hall bringing us in with Sneaky Snake, and we're trying to decide whether the Joe Rogan theme song should be Tom T. Hall's Sneaky Snake, or can we play Snake Farm, which is another, we've got to play this.
[03:07:40.600 --> 03:07:56.600]  And again, the reason I wanted Joe Rogan is, I looked at his sponsors, it's like all these Jack Dorsey companies, Twitter, he doesn't tell people it's that, and it's like George Soros stuff, and then he's on air, like George Soros talking points every day.
[03:07:56.600 --> 03:08:05.600]  And then saying Alex Jones is lying, I'm not giving out any George Soros talking points, but Media Matters says Alex Jones did this.
[03:08:05.600 --> 03:08:07.600]  That's literally George Soros.
[03:08:07.600 --> 03:08:11.600]  So I realized the way they're pushing him and all this, that CNN has no viewers.
[03:08:11.600 --> 03:08:18.600]  Joe has 10 million viewers, average podcast, bigger podcast, like the one I was on, 45 to 50 million people.
[03:08:18.600 --> 03:08:26.600]  So he's not the platform I am, and then he wants to sit there while I'm tied up in the corner, they think.
[03:08:26.600 --> 03:08:28.600]  We're still reaching a lot of people.
[03:08:28.600 --> 03:08:32.600]  Those that really count, those that are tuned in and really care, he tries to shut me down.
[03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:34.600]  So Joe, this is not satire.
[03:08:34.600 --> 03:08:36.600]  Joe did call me last night a couple of times.
[03:08:36.600 --> 03:08:41.600]  I had the phone off and got the messages in the morning.
[03:08:41.600 --> 03:08:44.600]  And I don't really think there's anything for me to talk about.
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:49.600]  Joe's like, I apologized to you yesterday.
[03:08:49.600 --> 03:08:57.600]  If I hurt your feelings or didn't have you on, but you're in a bad place and you're mentally ill.
[03:08:57.600 --> 03:08:58.600]  And I don't even have time to watch it all.
[03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:02.600]  I guess he's done hours on this, but he's like, yeah, Jones is insane.
[03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:08.600]  He claims Jimmy Savelle had sex with dead kids at hospitals and ate their brains.
[03:09:08.600 --> 03:09:10.600]  Dude, that's London Telegraph.
[03:09:10.600 --> 03:09:12.600]  That's, that's, that's BBC.
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:16.600]  In fact, just type in Jimmy Savelle, sex with dead children.
[03:09:16.600 --> 03:09:17.600]  There's the Washington Post.
[03:09:17.600 --> 03:09:19.600]  And the Washington Post is whitewashing.
[03:09:19.600 --> 03:09:20.600]  It was alleged.
[03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:21.600]  No, it was confirmed.
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:27.600]  So look, he goes, Jones is a schizophrenic.
[03:09:27.600 --> 03:09:32.600]  Really, I've been around 45 years and started a media operation that nobody could challenge.
[03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:36.600]  And, you know, I had no criminal record and I, I know how to tie my shoelaces.
[03:09:36.600 --> 03:09:41.600]  You know, I'm pretty, pretty, I can walk the line.
[03:09:41.600 --> 03:09:42.600]  Yeah.
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:43.600]  I mean, I used to mountain climb.
[03:09:43.600 --> 03:09:45.600]  I could sit there and like be 500 feet up with like one arm hanging off.
[03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:47.600]  Pretty, pretty, pretty cool dude.
[03:09:47.600 --> 03:09:50.600]  I'm not like, I'm not a scared.
[03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:53.600]  I'm not a schizophrenic on a street corner.
[03:09:53.600 --> 03:10:00.600]  Jimmy Savelle would take children and lay out plastic all over the floor and then slit their
[03:10:00.600 --> 03:10:01.600]  throats ear to ear.
[03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:04.600]  And it came out in the news, Joe.
[03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:07.600]  And if you're a radio listener, I'm showing ABC news.
[03:10:07.600 --> 03:10:11.600]  He committed sex acts on dead bodies while volunteering in high hospital.
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:16.600]  And really the police reports, they would eat the pituitary plant.
[03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:22.600]  Well, you think like, because like Joe, like, God, he's an incredible writer though.
[03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:25.600]  He comes up with amazing stuff better than Stephen King.
[03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:28.600]  No, dude, I didn't come up with any of it.
[03:10:28.600 --> 03:10:33.600]  I didn't come up with Cortez booing Trump when he said we were going to stop sex slavery.
[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:39.600]  I didn't come up with him saying we keep babies alive and take their organs on TV, man.
[03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:40.600]  The governor of Virginia.
[03:10:40.600 --> 03:10:43.600]  I got freaked out about it, Joe, Joe.
[03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:52.600]  So you sit there and maybe you're out there in your LA cocoon with your head up your cool.
[03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:56.600]  But I mean, dude, I don't just say this stuff.
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:11:02.600]  They want me off the air to shut down the exposure of what they're into.
[03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:05.600]  It's an anti-child devil cult.
[03:11:05.600 --> 03:11:12.600]  When I learned that it was in WikiLeaks, the devil worship, the human sacrifice, the pedophilia,
[03:11:12.600 --> 03:11:16.600]  the Aleister Crowley stuff, and then the media just diverted onto a pizza place.
[03:11:16.600 --> 03:11:19.600]  I was like, oh my God, the pizza place is a diversion.
[03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:21.600]  Like a mockingbird saying it's wings broken.
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:22.600]  Nothing.
[03:11:22.600 --> 03:11:24.600]  And I go, oh, there's no pedophilia in the world.
[03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:25.600]  Joe admits he's fake.
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:26.600]  We can't have him on air.
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:29.600]  Joe, I don't want on your stupid show, dude.
[03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:32.600]  I produce loose change.
[03:11:32.600 --> 03:11:37.600]  But before they took the view counter down, had 187 million views on Google Video.
[03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:41.600]  187 million views, Joe.
[03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:46.600]  Back when you were eating donkey testicles on Fear Factor.
[03:11:46.600 --> 03:11:50.600]  And I made all these other films, hundreds of millions of views, billions and billions of views that were,
[03:11:50.600 --> 03:11:53.600]  I don't, oh, oh, oh, please have me on.
[03:11:53.600 --> 03:11:54.600]  Please do.
[03:11:54.600 --> 03:11:59.600]  Joe's like, we may have you on if you're good and sit down and you're good.
[03:11:59.600 --> 03:12:00.600]  Oh, let me sit then.
[03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:03.600]  Do I get a treat?
[03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:05.600]  Dude, you weren't on my radar.
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:12.600]  When you pulled all this, you went tracking radar, enemy assessed, targeting operations,
[03:12:12.600 --> 03:12:18.600]  enemy propaganda vehicle, destroy the extreme prejudice.
[03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:27.600]  Like you just literally just got the program, like it's like destroy headquarters, destroy enemy, key enemy,
[03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:34.600]  maximum commitment, prime target, attack.
[03:12:34.600 --> 03:12:38.600]  Because you see, it's not just that you're on a higher echelon evil.
[03:12:38.600 --> 03:12:42.600]  You're almost there, but you are a good pickets.
[03:12:42.600 --> 03:12:44.600]  You're cleared to fire, Joe.
[03:12:44.600 --> 03:12:48.600]  What that means is you're dead in my sights, son.
[03:12:48.600 --> 03:12:53.600]  So this isn't about men acting tough to man and me, me scaring you and all those other things.
[03:12:53.600 --> 03:12:59.600]  You need to know as a sneaky snake what I'm going to do.
[03:12:59.600 --> 03:13:05.600]  So I joked around earlier and I said, Joe Rogan is going to be on the show today.
[03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:07.600]  And then of course I said it was satire.
[03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:10.600]  He'll spin and say, Alex lied and said I'd be on.
[03:13:10.600 --> 03:13:13.600]  I wasn't, it's a lie, but you won't show the clip.
[03:13:13.600 --> 03:13:17.600]  Because that's what sneaky snakes do.
[03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:21.600]  So if you're a TV viewer, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Rogan is now in studio with us.
[03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:24.600]  And let's do a document cam shot closer here please.
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:25.600]  He's going to be interviewed.
[03:13:25.600 --> 03:13:30.600]  So it's like, hey, George Soros was on 60 Minutes and said he supported the Nazis.
[03:13:30.600 --> 03:13:31.600]  No, he didn't.
[03:13:31.600 --> 03:13:34.600]  George Soros cut his head off.
[03:13:34.600 --> 03:13:36.600]  I'm a sneaky snake.
[03:13:36.600 --> 03:13:38.600]  I mean, this is what it is.
[03:13:38.600 --> 03:13:39.600]  Because here's the deal.
[03:13:39.600 --> 03:13:45.600]  If you pay Joe enough money, if your cash square and Jack Dorsey, which is all confirmed,
[03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:48.600]  told the news now, the insider trading investigations going on.
[03:13:48.600 --> 03:13:53.600]  If you pay him, like, you know, if you like, like, like, like you put coins into the snake,
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:54.600]  then the snake does whatever you want.
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:13:57.600]  Oh, thanks, Alex.
[03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:01.600]  Oh, yeah, I'm a sneaky snake now.
[03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:04.600]  So again, if you're a TV viewer, this is a not really Joe Rogan.
[03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:10.600]  So yeah, that'll be the headline tonight, like Alex Jones claimed Joe Rogan was on.
[03:14:10.600 --> 03:14:11.600]  They really wasn't on.
[03:14:11.600 --> 03:14:15.600]  Jones engaged in incredible fake notes.
[03:14:15.600 --> 03:14:19.600]  So do we have snake farm chewed up?
[03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:21.600]  All right, let's go out to break with snake farm.
[03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:26.600]  I like the other song, but I think this is actually Joe's official song.
[03:14:26.600 --> 03:14:32.600]  And so Joe, Joe, Joe thought that, you know, he was with the establishment and I didn't see what he was doing.
[03:14:32.600 --> 03:14:39.600]  But Joe, I don't really think he realized what was happening.
[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:41.600]  Jiu Jitsu master.
[03:14:41.600 --> 03:14:47.600]  I don't think the Jiu Jitsu master understood what's happening.
[03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:52.600]  So when we come back, we're going to get to sneaky snake.
[03:14:52.600 --> 03:15:00.600]  But the good news is seriously new men's attire 2020 apparel is going to be this like forget the boa.
[03:15:00.600 --> 03:15:03.600]  This is like absolutely incredible.
[03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:08.600]  When we come back, I'll get serious and take more your phone calls than Roger Stone is going to take over.
[03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:11.600]  But I mean, I just had to talk about this.
[03:15:11.600 --> 03:15:14.600]  I just had to do this because I can't keep track of everything.
[03:15:14.600 --> 03:15:16.600]  And my listeners were mad at me about Joe Rogan.
[03:15:16.600 --> 03:15:18.600]  Like, aren't you hearing what he's doing?
[03:15:18.600 --> 03:15:20.600]  I was like, no, I'm busy doing stuff.
[03:15:20.600 --> 03:15:21.600]  I've only got 20 years.
[03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:24.600]  And then I just I see his responses back.
[03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:26.600]  I see the disinfo.
[03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:35.600]  Yeah, so I mean, Joe Rogan's experience is brought to you by Snake Farm Insurance.
[03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:42.600]  And if you want your country burned down and pedophiles have sex with your kids and that dorsi to run a world currency where we bitch about it.

[03:15:43.600 --> 03:15:45.600]  Then you're all about the snake farm.

[03:16:22.600 --> 03:16:28.600]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:28.600 --> 03:16:31.600]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:31.600 --> 03:16:37.600]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:37.600 --> 03:16:41.600]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:41.600 --> 03:16:42.600]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:42.600 --> 03:16:43.600]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:43.600 --> 03:16:46.600]  The deep state began with World War I.

[03:19:56.600 --> 03:20:03.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:03.600 --> 03:20:28.600]  First down the Snake Farm, Snake Farm.
[03:20:28.600 --> 03:20:50.600]  You know, people ask why are you, some of them, never in fights on such a Joe Rogan kick right now.
[03:20:50.600 --> 03:21:00.600]  And, you know, again, it's like the condescension of Joe. Like, Joe, oh, I'm sorry, Alex, I want to be your friend.
[03:21:00.600 --> 03:21:05.600]  You know, maybe you can come on the show to just be nice and stop.
[03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:09.600]  Dude, I didn't start attacking you because I wanted to get on your stupid show.
[03:21:09.600 --> 03:21:15.600]  You know how many times I've turned down 40 million in Bitcoin and a million a month in Bitcoin.
[03:21:15.600 --> 03:21:23.600]  You know, it's like, what planet are you on? Not for sale, man.
[03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:31.600]  You see my ass right here? See this? I've never broke it or sold it out to anybody.
[03:21:31.600 --> 03:21:39.600]  To quote Tony Montana, there's two things I don't break. And that's my word and my boss.
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:48.600]  And so Joe's this new Silicon Valley darling because they've compromised him. I don't know what.
[03:21:48.600 --> 03:21:51.600]  And then he misrepresent everything. He's like, we'll go back to your calls.
[03:21:51.600 --> 03:21:59.600]  Alex Jones says I'm in the CIA and he's a liar. Joe, I didn't say you were in the CIA.
[03:21:59.600 --> 03:22:03.600]  I said the entire group around you pushing DMT in ayahuasca.
[03:22:03.600 --> 03:22:08.600]  You can look up their names. They're involved in DARPA and major research projects of the CIA on record.
[03:22:08.600 --> 03:22:16.600]  We bibliographed all that. So don't change the subject, Joe.
[03:22:16.600 --> 03:22:20.600]  And then he gets into his next big lie and his next big lie.
[03:22:20.600 --> 03:22:28.600]  Oh, Alex lied about me. He said that my family got threatened a few years ago and that's why I sold out.
[03:22:28.600 --> 03:22:34.600]  But that never happened. And you know, in that there's a kernel of truth.
[03:22:34.600 --> 03:22:42.600]  Because Eddie Bravo dinner a couple of years ago after I've already been on Joe's podcast was like.
[03:22:42.600 --> 03:22:47.600]  Okay, I think he got threatened. He got threatened. He hangs out with his professors and his weirdos.
[03:22:47.600 --> 03:22:50.600]  So I go in there and I say, you know, I think Joe's family's been threatened.
[03:22:50.600 --> 03:22:52.600]  And he goes, oh, my family didn't get threatened.
[03:22:52.600 --> 03:22:55.600]  And I'm like, okay, Eddie Bravo didn't say they got threatened.
[03:22:55.600 --> 03:22:59.600]  And he says it's that he thought you got threatened.
[03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:10.600]  And that turns into this whole thing about I don't have Alex on Alex isn't the captain of the football team or Alex isn't the class president.
[03:23:10.600 --> 03:23:15.600]  Alex isn't invited to wear the sweater over his shoulders and tie it together.
[03:23:15.600 --> 03:23:22.600]  A little ascot because he's a liar.
[03:23:22.600 --> 03:23:25.600]  I'm going to explain this to you again, Joe.
[03:23:25.600 --> 03:23:33.600]  I'm not coming after you because you didn't have me on your stupid podcast.
[03:23:33.600 --> 03:23:36.600]  Like I've already been on everything. It's a joke.
[03:23:36.600 --> 03:23:41.600]  I'm pissed at you.
[03:23:41.600 --> 03:23:46.600]  Because when I started looking into you, when people said, why are you leaving this guy alone?
[03:23:46.600 --> 03:23:50.600]  And I was like everywhere I looked, there's like, oh, it's like, let me spot check this.
[03:23:50.600 --> 03:23:55.600]  Oh, my God, that's the worst. Oh, my God, that's like, I look over here like, oh, that's even worse.
[03:23:55.600 --> 03:23:58.600]  Like, well, let me just randomly check over here. Oh, my gosh.
[03:23:58.600 --> 03:24:02.600]  It's like, I like zoom in just to spot check what you're up to.
[03:24:02.600 --> 03:24:09.600]  And every time I tune in, it's like though it's like the Satan channel or something.
[03:24:09.600 --> 03:24:13.600]  And I don't mean the Satan channel like hot cheerleaders and shooting guns.
[03:24:13.600 --> 03:24:23.600]  No, that's what the devil had you believe is. That's God's channel. God's channels like women and kids and life and spaceships and awesome crap and everything.
[03:24:23.600 --> 03:24:28.600]  And like, you know, the devil's like, oh, I did that. I did that. I gave you your wife, your husband.
[03:24:28.600 --> 03:24:31.600]  I'm the author of all those good things.
[03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:37.600]  That's what's frustrating about this is that I don't want to be in LA.
[03:24:37.600 --> 03:24:39.600]  I don't want to be part of the system.
[03:24:39.600 --> 03:24:45.600]  And then there's this one person I know is part of it for whatever weird twist of fate over 20 years.
[03:24:45.600 --> 03:24:57.600]  And then, you know, I witnessed stuff from Joe that I would never even say on air that is just is just outrageous.
[03:24:57.600 --> 03:25:00.600]  I mean, no wonder Joe doesn't have a lot of people around him.
[03:25:00.600 --> 03:25:08.600]  Because if you get close to Joe, I mean, you actually get in a hotel room with him at 6 a.m. in Las Vegas, you know, it's a little something different.
[03:25:08.600 --> 03:25:17.600]  And, you know, me, I'm like, hey, well, you know, here's the deal, son.
[03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:20.600]  You know, I don't think I'm going to be able to stop and not say all this stuff. You know what?
[03:25:20.600 --> 03:25:23.600]  Here's the problem. Here's the reason I've held back.
[03:25:23.600 --> 03:25:27.600]  If you go buy a Christmas turkey, you're going to cook. You got to cook it right.
[03:25:27.600 --> 03:25:30.600]  You know what I mean? It's kind of like going to have some presentation to it.
[03:25:30.600 --> 03:25:35.600]  There's got to be some presentations, the cooking of the turkey and everything else.
[03:25:35.600 --> 03:25:44.600]  And so here it is.
[03:25:44.600 --> 03:25:50.600]  You think I want to be part of your system when I want to burn you down.
[03:25:50.600 --> 03:25:56.600]  And your bosses have figured that out like Alex Jones is not for sale.
[03:25:56.600 --> 03:25:59.600]  Just it's already sold out.
[03:25:59.600 --> 03:26:02.600]  I signed on to the big command base right home.
[03:26:02.600 --> 03:26:05.600]  I'm signed on to that. I'm just lucky I made the cut.
[03:26:05.600 --> 03:26:08.600]  I mean, I'm I brushed up because people like you so much.
[03:26:08.600 --> 03:26:11.600]  I can't believe I'm dirty rags. I can't believe God even accepts me.
[03:26:11.600 --> 03:26:14.600]  I'm really lucky to be on the team. Let me just tell you that.
[03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:19.600]  And I'm counting on it every moment that God says you attack these people
[03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:21.600]  and you take it to them all the way.
[03:26:21.600 --> 03:26:23.600]  Maybe I let you be with us.
[03:26:23.600 --> 03:26:26.600]  I'm like, yes, sir, please take full control of me.
[03:26:26.600 --> 03:26:29.600]  And God goes, I don't do that. You're going to have to do this.
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:34.600]  I'm just like, OK, so you're all trying to take DMT and get in contact
[03:26:34.600 --> 03:26:39.600]  with little floating retard demons from the pit of hell.
[03:26:39.600 --> 03:26:43.600]  And I just want you to know, Joe, that there's a whole another dimension
[03:26:43.600 --> 03:26:48.600]  and then on from that and you're just not making the cut, Joe.
[03:26:48.600 --> 03:26:51.600]  I mean, do you really think it higher dimensions?
[03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:58.600]  You see Joe Rogan walking around.
[03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:01.600]  You know, maybe he's got platform shoes that go up to the next dimension,
[03:27:01.600 --> 03:27:03.600]  like elevators.
[03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:06.600]  I mean, when you're walking around heaven on a big command base
[03:27:06.600 --> 03:27:08.600]  and you're like, oh, my God, I wish I had known this.
[03:27:08.600 --> 03:27:11.600]  Like, yeah, getting the field. We're at a huge attack coming in.
[03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:14.600]  I mean, imagine when you get to the next level and you're like, oh, my God,
[03:27:14.600 --> 03:27:17.600]  I know it was. Oh, yeah.
[03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:21.600]  Can you imagine like looking back on Hollywood and looking back on these losers
[03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:23.600]  and looking back, it's going to be a joke.
[03:27:23.600 --> 03:27:26.600]  We're going to say that almost defeated us.
[03:27:26.600 --> 03:27:30.600]  That's what we almost sold out to like, like bugs to a bug zapper flying out
[03:27:30.600 --> 03:27:37.600]  to Los Angeles to show we all present our butt to the devil properly.
[03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:44.600]  He might decide to mount us.
[03:27:44.600 --> 03:27:46.600]  There you go.
[03:27:46.600 --> 03:27:50.600]  You know, Mueller and all these guys take themselves so seriously.
[03:27:50.600 --> 03:27:51.600]  There you go.
[03:27:51.600 --> 03:27:56.600]  I'm going to do it properly. It's like some things backwards.
[03:27:56.600 --> 03:28:01.600]  So this is all about defiling their gods.
[03:28:01.600 --> 03:28:05.600]  It's all about burning bridges because God wants us.
[03:28:05.600 --> 03:28:07.600]  Oh, I know there's no God.
[03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:10.600]  The first message of the devil worship is there is no God.
[03:28:10.600 --> 03:28:12.600]  Because they don't want you to know there's an escape.
[03:28:12.600 --> 03:28:13.600]  They don't want you to know there's a bridge.
[03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:15.600]  They don't want to know there's this whole beautiful thing right there.
[03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:17.600]  Like, oh, it doesn't exist. There's no hope.
[03:28:17.600 --> 03:28:20.600]  No, there is nothing but hope.
[03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:24.600]  But the devil tells you there's no God and then sneaks up so he can pretend as God.
[03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:26.600]  You have to accept God.
[03:28:26.600 --> 03:28:33.600]  You have to say, God, I'm weak, but I love you and I want free will and I have free will
[03:28:33.600 --> 03:28:38.600]  and I want you to come in and take control and I want to then carry out the mission.
[03:28:38.600 --> 03:28:48.600]  Not to get a bigger house or a jet airplane, but to engage people like this at point blank range.
[03:28:48.600 --> 03:28:51.600]  I'll take a few final calls when Roger Stone takes over.
[03:29:19.600 --> 03:29:22.600]  But I need to know their good quality.

[03:33:16.600 --> 03:33:22.600]  Alright, here's the deal. I've tried to go to all your calls and Roger Stone's got some stuff to cover.
[03:33:22.600 --> 03:33:33.600]  He'll be on the war room coming up today as well, but I can tell you right now that we got banned off 22 Facebook pages yesterday
[03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:37.600]  and I looked these up. These weren't even our pages.
[03:33:37.600 --> 03:33:45.600]  And they said, oh, it's recidivism, like it's thought crime. It actually says people promoting Alex Jones.
[03:33:45.600 --> 03:33:51.600]  And in some pages had like a half million followers, 300,000, 200,000, 100,000 followers, millions all together.
[03:33:51.600 --> 03:33:55.600]  And I'm just like, the media's calling it, well, your pages got taken down.
[03:33:55.600 --> 03:34:00.600]  And I'm like, I wouldn't talk to our people there in social media.
[03:34:00.600 --> 03:34:03.600]  No, two of them, we had fans that ran that we knew.
[03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:12.600]  One of them had like a half million, another 200,000, but imagine using the term recidivism, recidivism.
[03:34:12.600 --> 03:34:19.600]  That means like I robbed a bank when I was 20 and I got out of prison when I'm 35 and I go rob a bank again.
[03:34:19.600 --> 03:34:23.600]  Or I'm a child molester and I've raped two kids and I go to jail and I get back out.
[03:34:23.600 --> 03:34:26.600]  The recidivism policy, yes.
[03:34:26.600 --> 03:34:29.600]  And they just do this to get a bunch of headlines.
[03:34:29.600 --> 03:34:34.600]  We get less than 1% of our traffic from Facebook. It's dead.
[03:34:34.600 --> 03:34:37.600]  And then they're like articles everywhere, get him off, get him off.
[03:34:37.600 --> 03:34:43.600]  You know, a year ago it was like, oh, because he did something.
[03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:48.600]  Now they just go, he isn't allowed to be on the internet.
[03:34:48.600 --> 03:34:54.600]  So I've said this about 5,000 times and I'll say it again for listeners.
[03:34:54.600 --> 03:34:59.600]  This isn't regular talk radio. It isn't regular TV. It's not regular stuff.
[03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:05.600]  It's toe-to-toe with the globalist, relaunching capitalism, Americana, pro-Christian society.
[03:35:05.600 --> 03:35:08.600]  And we're under a major attack.
[03:35:08.600 --> 03:35:14.600]  And I can tell you right now that we didn't expand the shows last year like I intended.
[03:35:14.600 --> 03:35:17.600]  We didn't launch all the new stuff.
[03:35:17.600 --> 03:35:24.600]  And I'll just tell Roger in front of God and Country, I already told Paul this two days ago, Paul and Roger Stone are on the chopping block.
[03:35:24.600 --> 03:35:30.600]  There's a money's not there. Money's not coming in to pay some of our employees.
[03:35:30.600 --> 03:35:34.600]  And I thought about this a lot. It'll give the enemy a lot of excitement.
[03:35:34.600 --> 03:35:37.600]  You're like, oh, no crap you're getting to us.
[03:35:37.600 --> 03:35:41.600]  My God, you took most of our bank accounts away. We can't advertise online.
[03:35:41.600 --> 03:35:43.600]  All we've got is the listeners.
[03:35:43.600 --> 03:35:51.600]  People say, well, we don't want to bet on a loser. Well, then you just bet on yourself being a loser because info wars is a standard in the fight.
[03:35:51.600 --> 03:35:59.600]  It's seen as a symbol, a signal, a logo, a art type that must be brought down.
[03:35:59.600 --> 03:36:09.600]  And, you know, a six out of me has been in the fight 24 years on air.
[03:36:09.600 --> 03:36:17.600]  And the six out of me is just like the responsibility of like, I get up earlier in the morning, easier than I ever did.
[03:36:17.600 --> 03:36:21.600]  And your kid, you can't get out of bed now. It's like, I just get up because there's a mission.
[03:36:21.600 --> 03:36:24.600]  I'll be laying in bed with God. This bed feels incredible. I got to fight him.
[03:36:24.600 --> 03:36:36.600]  And so all I'm telling listeners is in me, you've got a AI attack robot made of flesh and blood that is completely committed to fighting the globalist.
[03:36:36.600 --> 03:36:41.600]  But I need fuel and the spectrum of media and systems.
[03:36:41.600 --> 03:36:51.600]  If you don't put fuel in the jet tank, I can't drop bombs on George Soros.
[03:36:51.600 --> 03:36:56.600]  I mean, I'll be stuck on the tarmac fantasizing about dropping bombs till the day I die.
[03:36:56.600 --> 03:37:01.600]  But I want to drop weapons, information weapons, not violent weapons.
[03:37:01.600 --> 03:37:08.600]  I want to engage and engage and engage and engage and engage until the cows come home.
[03:37:08.600 --> 03:37:19.600]  But I need, we already have great products, you know, we already have brain force, we already have turbo force, the new product, 50% off, big special one right now.
[03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:22.600]  We already have ultimate brown broth. We already have super silver.
[03:37:22.600 --> 03:37:26.600]  No one got the private label of this. It's 40 bucks in stores. It's FDA approved.
[03:37:26.600 --> 03:37:33.600]  It's the most weaponized silver on the planet below the level that the same company sells as prescription.
[03:37:33.600 --> 03:37:38.600]  So I need everybody to go to enforce.com, everybody to go there and just realize that it's a war.
[03:37:38.600 --> 03:37:43.600]  Just find your war bonds and get the toothpaste, get the coffee, get it all and just take action.
[03:37:43.600 --> 03:37:49.600]  I'm going to let Roger take over here because I'm going to go to some meetings and I'm sorry that the callers we didn't get to, but I tried my best.
[03:37:49.600 --> 03:37:57.600]  It's just that, you know, you think the team that's like, let's not kill babies after they're born will be winning.
[03:37:57.600 --> 03:37:59.600]  But the media is like, Trump was evil to even say that.
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:02.600]  So I'm kind of like, I'm not a fatalist.
[03:38:02.600 --> 03:38:18.600]  But you know, if humanity thinks it's normal to have medical doctors that are governors on TV saying we kill babies after they're born, then I'm not going to throw the towel in it, but it's kind of like you've made your choice.
[03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:20.600]  And again, you can say Texas is Southern.
[03:38:20.600 --> 03:38:23.600]  I love Southerners, but there's a certain type of Southerner.
[03:38:23.600 --> 03:38:25.600]  In fact, he would ever play it.
[03:38:25.600 --> 03:38:32.600]  Who's like a fake Southerner who gets into it all effeminate and like, just go to sleep while I slit your throat.
[03:38:32.600 --> 03:38:37.600]  He'll keep the baby comfortable and we don't ask the women, women won't.
[03:38:37.600 --> 03:38:39.600]  It ain't the women.
[03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:40.600]  It's for the women.
[03:38:40.600 --> 03:38:46.600]  No, they're selling the organs and these women like cult members sit there looking at him.
[03:38:46.600 --> 03:38:49.600]  These are sick freaks, man.
[03:38:49.600 --> 03:38:52.600]  And we can't beat them.
[03:38:52.600 --> 03:38:58.600]  Our president is extreme because he doesn't want to kill babies after they're born.
[03:38:58.600 --> 03:39:03.600]  Then, you know, at a certain point they want to demoralize us.
[03:39:03.600 --> 03:39:04.600]  They want to make us give up.
[03:39:04.600 --> 03:39:05.600]  It's what they want.
[03:39:05.600 --> 03:39:10.600]  But let's play that clip of the governor with his mint mule.
[03:39:10.600 --> 03:39:12.600]  Here it is.
[03:39:12.600 --> 03:39:21.600]  And there are, you know, when we talk about third trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother with the consent.
[03:39:21.600 --> 03:39:22.600]  Hit pause.
[03:39:22.600 --> 03:39:23.600]  Back it up.
[03:39:23.600 --> 03:39:25.600]  What if the, what if the, I don't want to be violent.
[03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:26.600]  I'm just apathetically.
[03:39:26.600 --> 03:39:34.600]  What if the doctors said, let's tie him up with piano wire and then like slowly use loppers to cut his toes off?
[03:39:34.600 --> 03:39:37.600]  Like, oh, the doctors had a consensus.
[03:39:37.600 --> 03:39:47.600]  We're going to hang you up by your toes, governor, and we're going to slit your throat, but not before we cut your fingers off with, with pruning loppers.
[03:39:47.600 --> 03:39:49.600]  Oh, it'd be like, oh my God, this is horrible.
[03:39:49.600 --> 03:39:50.600]  This is a human being.
[03:39:50.600 --> 03:39:51.600]  Don't do it.
[03:39:51.600 --> 03:39:58.600]  But he's, he's got, we keep the baby comfortable in his pants.
[03:39:58.600 --> 03:40:01.600]  Like he's having a, I mean, this is a demon.
[03:40:01.600 --> 03:40:02.600]  And I'm sorry.
[03:40:02.600 --> 03:40:10.600]  And I wasn't getting harm upon him saying like, what if the hospital said hang governor north up up and then feed him into a wood shipper?
[03:40:10.600 --> 03:40:15.600]  We like, well, the hospital said, so let's not get the government involved.
[03:40:15.600 --> 03:40:17.600]  So here's the governor.
[03:40:17.600 --> 03:40:30.600]  There are, you know, when we talk about third trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother with the consent of the physicians, more than one physician, by the way.
[03:40:30.600 --> 03:40:33.600]  And it's done in cases where there may be severe deformities.
[03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:36.600]  There may be a fetus that's non viable.
[03:40:36.600 --> 03:40:37.600]  There may be.
[03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:38.600]  There may be.
[03:40:38.600 --> 03:40:44.600]  No, they want to keep kids alive with dumb young poor mothers to get the organs because they keep them alive a week or so they can sell them at higher prices.
[03:40:44.600 --> 03:40:49.600]  We're like, by the way, by the way, let's go back to by the way.
[03:40:49.600 --> 03:40:50.600]  Here we go.
[03:40:50.600 --> 03:40:52.600]  A fetus that's non viable.
[03:40:52.600 --> 03:40:58.600]  So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[03:40:58.600 --> 03:41:00.600]  The infant would be delivered.
[03:41:00.600 --> 03:41:02.600]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[03:41:02.600 --> 03:41:08.600]  The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[03:41:08.600 --> 03:41:12.600]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[03:41:12.600 --> 03:41:15.600]  So I think this was really blown out of proportion.
[03:41:15.600 --> 03:41:20.600]  But again, we want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions.
[03:41:20.600 --> 03:41:21.600]  Exactly.
[03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:24.600]  We want the decision to be made by the mothers.
[03:41:24.600 --> 03:41:30.600]  And this is why Julie, that legislators, most of whom are men, by the way,
[03:41:30.600 --> 03:41:36.600]  should be telling a woman what she should and shouldn't be doing with her body.
[03:41:36.600 --> 03:41:40.600]  And so Trump says, killing babies after they're born is wrong.
[03:41:40.600 --> 03:41:43.600]  And then Cortez and everybody gets upset.
[03:41:43.600 --> 03:41:45.600]  So Rodgers don't take over.
[03:41:45.600 --> 03:41:47.600]  And I appreciate him holding on to this today.
[03:41:47.600 --> 03:41:48.600]  He'll take over next segment.
[03:41:48.600 --> 03:41:53.600]  I just at a certain point, I don't know what to say anymore.
[03:41:53.600 --> 03:41:59.600]  I mean, if this effeminate trollop, this chicken neck with a weird little mullet that, like,
[03:41:59.600 --> 03:42:05.600]  goes down his neck, and he's all, you know, and then the baby, and then the baby's inside.
[03:42:05.600 --> 03:42:10.600]  And he's like a big grotesque spider with these dumbass women sitting there.
[03:42:10.600 --> 03:42:11.600]  Look at those dumbasses.
[03:42:11.600 --> 03:42:15.600]  I mean, it's just like, good God.
[03:42:15.600 --> 03:42:17.600]  He's literally like this spider.
[03:42:17.600 --> 03:42:20.600]  He's actually a pediatric surgeon.
[03:42:20.600 --> 03:42:21.600]  He's an organ harvester.
[03:42:21.600 --> 03:42:22.600]  That's his job.
[03:42:22.600 --> 03:42:26.600]  And he's just like, we're going to get them babies, goodlies.
[03:42:26.600 --> 03:42:28.600]  We're going to get them babies, chitlins.
[03:42:28.600 --> 03:42:31.600]  We're going to get all them little smacky girls.
[03:42:31.600 --> 03:42:33.600]  And you know what's wrong?
[03:42:33.600 --> 03:42:35.600]  Keep that baby comfortable.
[03:42:35.600 --> 03:42:38.600]  We're going to take good care of that baby.
[03:42:38.600 --> 03:42:45.600]  When I'm not wearing my KKK outfit, I love my KKK.
[03:42:45.600 --> 03:42:46.600]  I'm governor.
[03:42:46.600 --> 03:42:48.600]  I'm governor Norfolk.
[03:42:48.600 --> 03:42:51.600]  I'm a big man now.
[03:42:51.600 --> 03:42:53.600]  I'm big.

[03:43:27.600 --> 03:43:30.600]  and beyond system in the world.
[03:43:30.600 --> 03:43:32.600]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:43:32.600 --> 03:43:33.600]  You must experience it.
[03:43:33.600 --> 03:43:35.600]  It is a total game changer.

[03:46:47.600 --> 03:47:13.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.600 --> 03:47:24.600]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.600 --> 03:47:30.600]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:30.600 --> 03:47:34.600]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:34.600 --> 03:47:37.600]  You know, I agree with what Alex Jones just said.
[03:47:37.600 --> 03:47:41.600]  There's nothing really worse than a Southern white liberal.
[03:47:41.600 --> 03:47:44.600]  And what he described was infanticide.
[03:47:44.600 --> 03:47:48.600]  That's right, the murder of a born child.
[03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:50.600]  Donald Trump called him out last night.
[03:47:50.600 --> 03:48:04.600]  But contrast the situation with Governor Northam, who was found red-handed to have a yearbook photo of him either in blackface or in a Ku Klux Klan outfit.
[03:48:04.600 --> 03:48:13.600]  First, he said, well, he apologized. That was him. Then he said, well, maybe it wasn't him, but he admitted that he'd been in blackface previously.
[03:48:13.600 --> 03:48:18.600]  Now compare that to Florida Secretary of State Mike Ertell.
[03:48:18.600 --> 03:48:25.600]  Mike Ertell was appointed Secretary of State by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis.
[03:48:25.600 --> 03:48:33.600]  And when a photo of him surfaced in blackface, he resigned within 24 hours.
[03:48:33.600 --> 03:48:38.600]  You see, that's the difference between Republicans and Democrats, both of them wrong.
[03:48:38.600 --> 03:48:42.600]  But in this case, Northam trying to hold on to power.
[03:48:42.600 --> 03:48:49.600]  You saw that group of women clad in white last night during the president's State of the Union address.
[03:48:49.600 --> 03:48:55.600]  I haven't seen that many Democrats wearing white since they formed the Ku Klux Klan.
[03:48:55.600 --> 03:49:02.600]  No, last night was a Reagan-esque tour de force for President Donald Trump.
[03:49:02.600 --> 03:49:10.600]  Now, I personally have attended six State of the Union addresses during the eight years of the Reagan presidency.
[03:49:10.600 --> 03:49:19.600]  But I must tell you, I never felt the kind of energy, the kind of dynamism that you could feel in the room last night.
[03:49:19.600 --> 03:49:22.600]  And I was watching on TV.
[03:49:22.600 --> 03:49:30.600]  I thought Ronald Reagan was the father of our greatest economic comeback until Donald Trump became president.
[03:49:30.600 --> 03:49:33.600]  And now America is open for business.
[03:49:33.600 --> 03:49:38.600]  And we finally have a president who puts America first.
[03:49:38.600 --> 03:49:46.600]  Contrast that with the disrespectful, even bizarre behavior of Nancy Pelosi.
[03:49:46.600 --> 03:49:56.600]  Shuffling through the papers while the president is speaking in an extraordinary display of disrespect and arrogance.
[03:49:56.600 --> 03:50:05.600]  At the meantime, I don't criticize her for not smiling because she has so much Botox, I don't think she can move her face.
[03:50:05.600 --> 03:50:18.600]  But the antics of the Democrats on the floor watching Octavia Cortez air slapping no one, slapping five with the air,
[03:50:18.600 --> 03:50:21.600]  was nothing less than bizarre.
[03:50:21.600 --> 03:50:28.600]  The president, I think, hit all the right notes. First, he talked about the major comeback of America's economy.
[03:50:28.600 --> 03:50:35.600]  4.8 million new jobs, 500,000 manufacturing jobs alone.
[03:50:35.600 --> 03:50:39.600]  Those are the jobs Barack Obama said were never coming back.
[03:50:39.600 --> 03:50:45.600]  300,000 new jobs in the last quarter, almost twice the estimate,
[03:50:45.600 --> 03:50:53.600]  wage growth at an all-time high and African American, in Hispanic unemployment,
[03:50:53.600 --> 03:50:57.600]  at the lowest point since they began keeping those statistics.
[03:50:57.600 --> 03:51:02.600]  Then, of course, the president called out Robert Mueller in the deep state.
[03:51:02.600 --> 03:51:07.600]  Because after two years and $30 million of your tax money,
[03:51:07.600 --> 03:51:18.600]  we still have no evidence of Russian collusion or any other crime that involves Russia and connects the Trump campaign to the Russian state.
[03:51:18.600 --> 03:51:22.600]  Let's face it, this is a move to remove our president.
[03:51:22.600 --> 03:51:28.600]  The most troubling thing about yesterday was the stunning news that the war room,
[03:51:28.600 --> 03:51:34.600]  which I co-host with my colleague Owen Schreuer, has been knocked off of Facebook.
[03:51:34.600 --> 03:51:43.600]  Folks, this is part of the same insidious, relentless campaign of censorship that is being wielded against info wars.
[03:51:43.600 --> 03:51:47.600]  Why? Because Alex Jones brings you the truth.
[03:51:47.600 --> 03:51:50.600]  Because Roger Stone brings you the truth.
[03:51:50.600 --> 03:51:56.600]  Because David Knight and Owen Schreuer and Millie Weaver and so many others on the info war team,
[03:51:56.600 --> 03:52:02.600]  give it to you straight, unvarnished, unedited, the stone cold truth, if you will.
[03:52:02.600 --> 03:52:05.600]  And that's why they want to take us down.
[03:52:05.600 --> 03:52:10.600]  What's the answer? Well, we're prepared to fight, but not if you don't have our back.
[03:52:10.600 --> 03:52:15.600]  I've got to be honest with you, I'm going through some very difficult days as people know.
[03:52:15.600 --> 03:52:19.600]  But there's a new product and I think people know I use the info war products.
[03:52:19.600 --> 03:52:25.600]  I swear by brain force plus, but turbo force takes it to a whole new level.
[03:52:25.600 --> 03:52:32.600]  This product gives me the vitality and the energy that I need to fight 12 hours a day.
[03:52:32.600 --> 03:52:37.600]  It's round the clock for me these days, meeting with lawyers, giving interviews,
[03:52:37.600 --> 03:52:41.600]  preparing for my conversations here on info wars.
[03:52:41.600 --> 03:52:45.600]  So I can tell you firsthand and I've used them all.
[03:52:45.600 --> 03:52:52.600]  This is the very best energy and vitality and focus product that I've ever used.
[03:52:52.600 --> 03:52:57.600]  The scientists who work closely with Alex Jones have taken it to a whole new level.
[03:52:57.600 --> 03:53:04.600]  And when you stack it with brain force plus, you are turbo charging your focus,
[03:53:04.600 --> 03:53:08.600]  your energy, your vitality, your intellect.
[03:53:08.600 --> 03:53:12.600]  It's more than just a physical lift, it's a mental lift at the same time.
[03:53:12.600 --> 03:53:18.600]  So please recognize that we cannot continue to conduct the war against the deep state.
[03:53:18.600 --> 03:53:26.600]  We cannot continue to fight with George Soros and the insidious and corrupt intelligence agencies
[03:53:26.600 --> 03:53:33.600]  that are still sadly in the control of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama without your support.
[03:53:33.600 --> 03:53:40.600]  And the campaign of censorship that is being run against info wars is part of their master plan.
[03:53:40.600 --> 03:53:44.600]  It's not a secret to anybody that they want to take me down.
[03:53:44.600 --> 03:53:47.600]  They want to send me to prison for the rest of my life.
[03:53:47.600 --> 03:53:56.600]  And I want people to understand that the platform of info wars is vitally important in terms of my strategy for survival.
[03:53:56.600 --> 03:54:01.600]  If I don't have the ability to come to info wars and tell you exactly what's going on,
[03:54:01.600 --> 03:54:06.600]  tell you why an Obama appointed judge is now considering slapping a gag on me
[03:54:06.600 --> 03:54:12.600]  and why I believe that gag will be challenged in court and could be overturned
[03:54:12.600 --> 03:54:15.600]  because I can't come to info wars and tell you the story.
[03:54:15.600 --> 03:54:22.600]  No, when I go on any of these other channels, they give me a little time and they try to edit what I say.
[03:54:22.600 --> 03:54:28.600]  Now, I'm not going to tell you a chapter in verse about the charges against me
[03:54:28.600 --> 03:54:36.600]  other than to say that a vital part of my strategy is being able to speak to you every day on info wars.
[03:54:36.600 --> 03:54:39.600]  It's the only way that you can get the truth.
[03:54:39.600 --> 03:54:42.600]  And as Alex Jones has said many times,
[03:54:42.600 --> 03:54:48.600]  part of the fight is for you to take the very best links, the very best stories,
[03:54:48.600 --> 03:54:54.600]  the things you find most compelling about what we say and report here at info wars
[03:54:54.600 --> 03:54:56.600]  and send it to your email list.
[03:54:56.600 --> 03:55:02.600]  Put it up on your Facebook page, your Twitter page, your Instagram page.
[03:55:02.600 --> 03:55:05.600]  You've got to spread the word.
[03:55:05.600 --> 03:55:10.600]  You see, Alex Jones is like the Paul Revere of this revolution.
[03:55:10.600 --> 03:55:14.600]  He's the early warning system that tells you what's coming.
[03:55:14.600 --> 03:55:17.600]  And that's why they are so desperate to silence him.
[03:55:17.600 --> 03:55:20.600]  So please go to the m4s.com store now.
[03:55:20.600 --> 03:55:22.600]  There's a lot of choices.
[03:55:22.600 --> 03:55:27.600]  You can buy one of our great nutraceutical products like Turbo Force or Brain Force Plus,
[03:55:27.600 --> 03:55:32.600]  or one my sister really likes, the turmeric formula.
[03:55:32.600 --> 03:55:37.600]  I find really good for people who are on their feet long hours.
[03:55:37.600 --> 03:55:40.600]  She's a waitress. She swears by it.
[03:55:40.600 --> 03:55:45.600]  Or you can buy one of our books or t-shirts or you can just send a contribution.
[03:55:45.600 --> 03:55:49.600]  $25, $50, $100, $500.
[03:55:49.600 --> 03:55:53.600]  Yes, some info warriors, they've even sold, sent $1,000.
[03:55:53.600 --> 03:55:59.600]  But whether it is any of our nutraceuticals, any of our books, any of our t-shirts,
[03:55:59.600 --> 03:56:03.600]  you can rest assured that you're helping fund the fight for freedom.
[03:56:03.600 --> 03:56:06.600]  You're helping fund the fight for the First Amendment.
[03:56:06.600 --> 03:56:11.600]  You are helping fund the fight to preserve the U.S. Constitution.
[03:56:11.600 --> 03:56:17.600]  As someone who's targeted for extinction, I want to thank the many in the info wars community
[03:56:17.600 --> 03:56:22.600]  who have helped me, who have prayed for me, who have contributed to my legal defense fund,
[03:56:22.600 --> 03:56:30.600]  and who fight every day to make sure the platform of info wars is there so you can hear the truth.
[03:56:30.600 --> 03:56:33.600]  You don't have to depend on CNN.
[03:56:33.600 --> 03:56:38.600]  I don't get my news from CNN for the same reason I don't eat out of the toilet.
[03:56:38.600 --> 03:56:46.600]  I don't watch Fox half the time unless Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity or even Judge Andrew Napolitano,
[03:56:46.600 --> 03:56:50.600]  all good friends of mine, are on. I've tuned out Fox.
[03:56:50.600 --> 03:56:57.600]  But if you want to know the truth, if you want to get the full story, the unvarnished story,
[03:56:57.600 --> 03:57:03.600]  the stone cold truth as it were, there's only one place that's info wars.
[03:57:03.600 --> 03:57:09.600]  Alex Jones needs you to have his back. We all hear info wars need you to have our back.
