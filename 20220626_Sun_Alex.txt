[00:00.000 --> 00:25.960]  Go Biden, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, all the usual suspects are telling us that a new pandemic
[00:25.960 --> 00:28.000]  and lockdowns are imminent.
[00:28.000 --> 00:42.720]  Let's look at lockdowns, cost us trillions of dollars, and we're paying for that now
[00:42.720 --> 00:49.560]  with super high inflation, and I think I'm interested in when Johns Hopkins comes out
[00:49.560 --> 00:56.240]  with a study that said basically that didn't have any impact on mortality, and I don't
[00:56.240 --> 01:01.800]  know that that study addressed what mortality might have been impacted in terms of deferring
[01:01.800 --> 01:11.960]  other healthcare, can we take lockdowns off the table in terms of what we do in the future?
[01:11.960 --> 01:15.800]  I can't say because I don't know what that future holds for us.
[01:15.800 --> 01:19.640]  What about the study that Johns Hopkins did because we're always saying pay attention
[01:19.640 --> 01:20.640]  to the science?
[01:20.640 --> 01:22.520]  I'm not familiar with that study, sir.
[01:22.520 --> 01:29.680]  The most recent data demonstrates that you are more likely to become infected or have
[01:29.680 --> 01:36.320]  disease or even death if you've been vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated people.
[01:36.320 --> 01:40.560]  This is shocking to hear, but it is what the data are showing us.
[01:40.560 --> 01:47.160]  The data now show that these experimental gene therapy treatments can damage your children
[01:47.160 --> 01:49.000]  as well as yourself.
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.680]  They can damage your heart, your brain, your reproductive tissue, and your lungs.
[01:55.680 --> 01:59.880]  This can include permanent damage and disablement of your immune system.
[01:59.880 --> 02:05.280]  As the world plunges into financial crisis via hyperinflation.
[02:05.280 --> 02:11.160]  All of what we are seeing play out in Europe right now is an upsetting of the balance of
[02:11.160 --> 02:17.040]  the world order as they want it, as people like Dr. Harari, as people like Klaus Schwab,
[02:17.040 --> 02:19.800]  and others, Bill Gates is another one.
[02:19.800 --> 02:25.040]  We have to understand that these are people that are very smart, they're very well resourced,
[02:25.040 --> 02:31.680]  and they have a very sort of strategic idea of how they want to see the world develop,
[02:31.680 --> 02:37.600]  and God and a soul are not part of that strategy.
[02:37.600 --> 02:42.760]  There's all the symptoms of the disease that is the new world order and globalism.
[02:42.760 --> 02:48.360]  The big question is how do we tackle globalism, how do we expose globalism, how do we dismantle
[02:48.360 --> 02:53.960]  and prosecute globalism, and then separately how do we recognize the fruits of globalism
[02:53.960 --> 02:58.360]  to wake up our friends, family, neighbors, and strangers so they understand why their
[02:58.360 --> 03:04.680]  lives are getting very bad, why crime is increasing, why they're going bankrupt.
[03:04.680 --> 03:06.440]  What is the worst thing they're doing?
[03:06.440 --> 03:10.200]  What is the number one thing they're doing that we need to stop?
[03:10.200 --> 03:18.480]  Releasing the currencies, defying the police, dissolving the borders, coming after our guns,
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.520]  launching war with Russia, preparing to release new bioweapons, but you know they're not really
[03:23.520 --> 03:29.400]  preparing to release new bioweapons, they are releasing new bioweapons, or targeting a new
[03:29.400 --> 03:39.440]  group of people with their bio nanotech weapon, and that is babies, six months old and up.
[03:39.440 --> 03:43.520]  Texas Children's Hospital started administering some shots yesterday.
[03:43.520 --> 03:49.240]  These vaccines are for those kids ages six months through four years, and because this
[03:49.240 --> 03:53.360]  group just received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, Dell Medical School
[03:53.360 --> 03:56.320]  is trying to calm worried parents.
[03:56.320 --> 04:02.520]  The corrupt FDA had three different rounds of resignations, firings, off their board
[04:02.520 --> 04:07.320]  the last year and a half, because the board would not even authorize authorizing these
[04:07.320 --> 04:09.920]  experimental injections for anybody.
[04:09.920 --> 04:14.360]  So they had one board resign, or large portions of it, then they got new people on and said
[04:14.360 --> 04:17.480]  now we're going to go down to age 16 and a bunch of them said no.
[04:17.480 --> 04:22.180]  Now we're going to add boosters and shots every few months, no, and they've got a board
[04:22.180 --> 04:27.440]  now that unanimously voted to lie to the public and say that this works great, that it's
[04:27.440 --> 04:30.080]  a vaccine, and that it totally protects you.
[04:30.080 --> 04:34.240]  When it isn't a vaccine, it doesn't protect you, destroys your immune system, causes all
[04:34.240 --> 04:42.360]  sorts of serious problems, absolute organized evil, depopulation against the people of this
[04:42.360 --> 05:00.880]  planet.
[05:00.880 --> 05:05.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity
[05:05.880 --> 05:08.560]  and hit humanity extremely hard.
[05:08.560 --> 05:14.400]  It is beyond critical that everyone listening to the sound of my voice protect yourselves
[05:14.400 --> 05:18.680]  and your families to the greatest extent possible, and these two new sales do that.
[05:18.680 --> 05:23.840]  We have the ultimate immune support, 60% off when you get these four items together.
[05:23.840 --> 05:28.520]  The immune support, X2, D3 gummies, and multivitamin.

[05:33.480 --> 05:34.480]  amazing.
[05:34.480 --> 05:35.480]  60% off.

[06:02.560 --> 06:16.560]  It's Sunday, June 26th, we're live, this is the InfoWars, strap yourselves in, this is
[06:16.560 --> 06:21.560]  a big broadcast.
[06:21.560 --> 06:28.320]  The second amendment in the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights is arguably the most revolutionary
[06:28.320 --> 06:32.080]  act of government in all of recorded history.
[06:32.080 --> 06:37.840]  And some Americans seem to think it's a law that allows a citizen to own a firearm for
[06:37.840 --> 06:39.840]  self-protection.
[06:39.840 --> 06:41.400]  That is false.
[06:41.400 --> 06:44.280]  This was true before the American Revolution.
[06:44.280 --> 06:49.840]  All throughout history there were laws created by the ruling power that allowed certain citizens
[06:49.840 --> 06:53.560]  to carry certain weapons for self-protection.
[06:53.560 --> 06:56.640]  But that's not what the second amendment is at all.
[06:56.640 --> 07:02.000]  The second amendment officially recognizes the God-given birthright that every American
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.280]  innately possesses, freedom.
[07:05.280 --> 07:10.960]  Every single American down to the lowest commoner has the right to arm themselves and constitute
[07:10.960 --> 07:13.320]  themselves in a militia.
[07:13.320 --> 07:19.480]  The second amendment does not grant us the right, it stands to protect our natural rights
[07:19.480 --> 07:21.000]  from government.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.920]  It is the bane of every tyrant and control freak, because before the second amendment
[07:25.920 --> 07:29.320]  only the ruling class had standing armies.
[07:29.320 --> 07:35.200]  The second amendment is the only remedy man has ever wielded against a corrupt government.
[07:35.200 --> 07:42.200]  And it can't be taken away or infringed upon unless we fail future generations and allow
[07:42.200 --> 07:44.880]  it, which is already happening.
[07:44.880 --> 07:50.680]  Federal states have unlawfully stripped Americans of their birthright and imposed infringements
[07:50.680 --> 07:56.960]  upon gun ownership, which has only increased the amount of gun violence in those areas.
[07:56.960 --> 07:59.840]  Because criminals don't obey laws.
[07:59.840 --> 08:04.400]  And even though the Supreme Court recently honored the second amendment, our corrupt
[08:04.400 --> 08:09.760]  Congress is working together to infringe upon all Americans.
[08:09.760 --> 08:15.080]  No matter what happened in Uvalde, Texas, we know that the police stood down and allowed
[08:15.080 --> 08:16.440]  it to happen.
[08:16.440 --> 08:22.120]  And after Hollywood dispatched their latest celebrity prostitute with political aspirations
[08:22.120 --> 08:27.320]  to dance on the graves of children, we know why they stood down.
[08:27.320 --> 08:32.800]  Unless you're a brainwashed zombie, it's crystal clear why the government is desperately trying
[08:32.800 --> 08:35.120]  to challenge the second amendment.
[08:35.120 --> 08:40.600]  The U.S. government is not only guilty of committing crimes against the American people, they're
[08:40.600 --> 08:46.560]  guilty of committing crimes against humanity and international war crimes.
[08:46.560 --> 08:53.680]  It is in fact the American citizen's duty to remedy the situation and restore the republic.
[08:53.680 --> 08:59.560]  Violence may often be a solution in human affairs, but it is never a good solution.
[08:59.560 --> 09:05.560]  And it requires very little courage to kill, if any at all, and that brings us to the First
[09:05.560 --> 09:06.560]  Amendment.
[09:06.560 --> 09:12.600]  The First Amendment is not nearly as revolutionary as the Second, but it requires more courage
[09:12.600 --> 09:13.960]  to wield.
[09:13.960 --> 09:21.000]  To peacefully stand against evil with your individual voice alone requires great courage.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.680]  And if enough people were able to muster that courage, then the light of truth would overcome
[09:25.680 --> 09:31.240]  the darkness, and the American people would become a righteous people.
[09:31.240 --> 09:36.480]  This is why the tyrants in Washington D.C. want to convict Julian Assange under the
[09:36.480 --> 09:38.240]  Espionage Act.
[09:38.240 --> 09:42.360]  They see it as a viable way to circumvent the First Amendment.
[09:42.360 --> 09:49.120]  If they can convict Assange, they can convict Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones, and anyone
[09:49.120 --> 09:51.480]  who exposes their corruption.
[09:51.480 --> 09:52.640]  And then what?
[09:52.640 --> 09:58.080]  Immediately following the Supreme Court's decision to recognize the Second Amendment,
[09:58.080 --> 10:02.880]  they overturned Roe v. Wade, another constitutional victory.
[10:02.880 --> 10:09.440]  The tyrants and their pro-abortionists see children as a commodity, a slave, or a piece
[10:09.440 --> 10:13.320]  of property to dispose of as its owner sees fit.
[10:13.320 --> 10:18.800]  But our American birthright applies to every living American.
[10:18.800 --> 10:24.000]  As revolutionary as it may be, the Bill of Rights is nothing more than a lawful remedy
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.600]  that we inherited.
[10:25.600 --> 10:28.920]  It merely recognizes our natural freedom.
[10:28.920 --> 10:34.240]  To actually secure this freedom requires the courage and the will of the people.
[10:34.240 --> 10:38.520]  Our government's job is not to change our constitution.
[10:38.520 --> 10:44.560]  Their job is to secure it and abide by it, which is what only one Supreme Court judge
[10:44.560 --> 10:46.760]  seems interested in doing.
[10:46.760 --> 10:51.760]  In the recent Supreme Court arguments, the majority of judges expressed their concern
[10:51.760 --> 10:58.320]  that their decision would be used to overturn other recent decisions, specifically constitutional
[10:58.320 --> 11:03.720]  laws pertaining to contraception, sodomy, and gay marriage.
[11:03.720 --> 11:09.600]  And Judge Thomas alone made it clear that these decisions should be overturned.
[11:09.600 --> 11:14.760]  And he's right, because all of these perverse concessions are nothing more than attacks
[11:14.760 --> 11:16.680]  on our constitution.
[11:16.680 --> 11:22.440]  And if Americans were a serious and righteous people, we would preserve our American birthright
[11:22.440 --> 11:25.080]  for generations to come.
[11:25.080 --> 11:54.080]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[11:56.080 --> 12:02.320]  Well, the headline, if you're a TV viewer, that you can see on screen, says it all, ladies
[12:02.320 --> 12:06.800]  and gentlemen, Nightmare Bombshell.
[12:06.800 --> 12:15.080]  Children paraded with naked men to the streets of Seattle and other cities across these captured
[12:15.080 --> 12:18.920]  United States and the blue city, safe and at command bases.
[12:18.920 --> 12:23.440]  The pedophiles are out of the closet.
[12:23.440 --> 12:26.560]  And I'll just be completely honest with the audience, and sometimes these are my better
[12:26.560 --> 12:31.680]  broadcasts where I get so upset and so depressed that I'm actually calm.
[12:31.680 --> 12:38.880]  I was already very tired today because at about 3.15 a.m., my wife woke me up and said
[12:38.880 --> 12:45.280]  there is a man trying to pick the lock to the house at the front door.
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.800]  And by the time I got up and went there, he'd run off in the vehicle and driving off into
[12:49.800 --> 12:55.160]  the night, and he was wearing a utility belt and a bunch of other stuff.
[12:55.160 --> 13:01.720]  And obviously, in my instinctive understanding of this, the evidence points towards it being
[13:01.720 --> 13:03.120]  an anti-foot type individual.
[13:03.120 --> 13:07.920]  We know they've done this to a lot of other prominent nationalist Christians, populist
[13:07.920 --> 13:08.920]  and conservative.
[13:08.920 --> 13:09.920]  So I've been up since 3.15 a.m.
[13:09.920 --> 13:11.160]  I couldn't go back to sleep today.
[13:11.160 --> 13:16.000]  And I was already tired coming here tonight, but I wanted to do the show.
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.920]  And then I began to review for the broadcast in the last few hours the pro-abortion, pro-death
[13:23.920 --> 13:25.560]  rallies across the country.
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.360]  And one of the producers came over and he said, have you seen all this news?
[13:29.360 --> 13:34.560]  And I've seen similar things, but it's intensifying now, and they're even showing it on the news
[13:34.560 --> 13:36.160]  like it's a good thing.
[13:36.160 --> 13:42.560]  And it was images not just of the left reaching the capital in Phoenix of Arizona, not just
[13:42.560 --> 13:48.960]  people simulating the abortion of their babies saying, we kill our children, we love it.
[13:48.960 --> 14:00.880]  But it was naked men at a parade with children being sexually paraded through with children
[14:00.880 --> 14:07.720]  being brought to the events.
[14:07.720 --> 14:15.200]  And all of this is just an exercise of dominance and control over the minds and the innocence
[14:15.200 --> 14:16.400]  and the future of our children.
[14:16.400 --> 14:25.920]  This is all a giant, evil exercise of power and the destruction of children's futures.
[14:25.920 --> 14:32.840]  It's all part of the sex trafficking Jeffrey Epstein cult that is the Rothschild Rockefeller
[14:32.840 --> 14:35.240]  New World Order.
[14:35.240 --> 14:43.920]  And so I have a quandary here or a paradox that we have a lot of TV stations that pick
[14:43.920 --> 14:48.200]  up this syndicated radio TV program, a lot of cable stations.
[14:48.200 --> 14:52.160]  And I understand why in the past when we've shown you footage of drag queen pedophile
[14:52.160 --> 14:58.440]  time and shown you footage of seven, eight, nine, 10 year olds at quote gay bars, scannily
[14:58.440 --> 15:05.920]  clad, sticking money in the G-strings of men and women and dancing half naked, that the
[15:05.920 --> 15:14.480]  stations go, hey, you can't show this on broadcast television.
[15:14.480 --> 15:17.120]  We're going to kick you off the station if you show it again.
[15:17.120 --> 15:19.840]  And believe me, I want to throw up.
[15:19.840 --> 15:22.040]  I'm really upset right now.
[15:22.040 --> 15:27.160]  I'm having trouble doing this broadcast and I'm not showing you the worst stuff out of
[15:27.160 --> 15:29.320]  respect for our stations and our viewers.
[15:29.320 --> 15:32.200]  But here's the paradox.
[15:32.200 --> 15:34.320]  Children are being put in this.
[15:34.320 --> 15:35.920]  They're being shown this.
[15:35.920 --> 15:36.920]  It's being pushed on them.
[15:36.920 --> 15:43.120]  So how in the hell am I supposed to expose this?
[15:43.120 --> 15:47.160]  But it's okay for children to see, but we can't put it on TV, which I totally agree.
[15:47.160 --> 15:49.000]  This should not be on TV.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.200]  I showed you one of the mild things of men with their genitals hanging out, creating around
[15:54.200 --> 15:55.200]  with children.
[15:55.200 --> 15:56.200]  That's nothing.
[15:56.200 --> 15:57.200]  They're eating poop.
[15:57.200 --> 16:06.040]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this, trust
[16:06.040 --> 16:08.840]  in God that tie up your camel.
[16:08.840 --> 16:13.120]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way, pray to God but row away from the rocks.
[16:13.120 --> 16:17.160]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and
[16:17.160 --> 16:19.160]  killed, but also try to row away.
[16:19.160 --> 16:23.200]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish and it's the same thing with our immune system.
[16:23.200 --> 16:25.280]  God helps those who help themselves.
[16:25.280 --> 16:30.240]  We have a lot of amazing products on sale right now at infowarsstore.com, like the ultimate

[16:57.760 --> 17:00.760]  family at infowarsstore.com.
[17:00.760 --> 17:04.880]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans.
[17:04.880 --> 17:10.480]  They financed major universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing
[17:10.480 --> 17:15.040]  their propaganda at the New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know
[17:15.040 --> 17:20.440]  it is a bad thing and must be ended, and the first step in that is getting women out of
[17:20.440 --> 17:25.760]  the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters
[17:25.760 --> 17:27.260]  and husbands is a bad thing.
[17:27.260 --> 17:32.160]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter.
[17:32.160 --> 17:36.160]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well, I love to make breakfast.
[17:36.160 --> 17:40.360]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[17:40.360 --> 17:44.520]  nurturative and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[17:44.520 --> 17:50.720]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions
[17:50.720 --> 17:51.720]  are coming together.
[17:51.720 --> 17:52.720]  They really are.
[17:52.720 --> 17:58.200]  Sick, evil, scientific, cult of filth that will domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.080]  We cannot let this continue.
[18:02.080 --> 18:06.960]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good

[19:22.240 --> 19:24.760]  is already unfolding with level food shortages.
[19:24.760 --> 19:29.720]  I told you over two years ago the globe was going to have massive inflation and food shortages
[19:29.720 --> 19:34.600]  and it's happened just like clockwork and I'm telling you it's going to get a lot worse,
[19:34.600 --> 19:36.000]  they have designed this.
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.520]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.

[20:01.200 --> 20:09.200]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:09.200 --> 20:19.480]  Take the highway to the end of the night, end of the night.
[20:19.480 --> 20:28.200]  So I have the proper answer to this for our TV stations, cable stations out to the care
[20:28.200 --> 20:33.760]  of the show that will undoubtedly complain about this and undoubtedly have a right to
[20:33.760 --> 20:37.600]  and quite frankly they should complain about it, but they shouldn't complain about the
[20:37.600 --> 20:45.960]  fact that I'm about to show you the milder pedophilic indoctrination and baptism of children
[20:45.960 --> 20:48.080]  and not the really hardcore stuff.
[20:48.080 --> 20:53.160]  I'm going to do it next segment, I'm going to give people plenty of time to have their
[20:53.160 --> 20:59.520]  children tune out and not watch this and not see this, but people cutting themselves,
[20:59.520 --> 21:05.160]  people ramming spikes through their hands and legs, people eating feces, people urinating
[21:05.160 --> 21:12.880]  each other's mouths, people parading in front of children, twerking in front of children,
[21:12.880 --> 21:14.680]  naked.
[21:14.680 --> 21:17.760]  And by the way, you're not supposed to want to see this.
[21:17.760 --> 21:25.240]  You have a spiritual instinct to be against this, I am physically sick right now with
[21:25.240 --> 21:30.160]  the latest footage that I watched before the broadcast and with all the footage it made
[21:30.160 --> 21:33.520]  me remember.
[21:33.520 --> 21:38.400]  So the footage we're showing you now is mild compared to what we have, naked men of your
[21:38.400 --> 21:45.200]  radio listener, riding bikes and walking around and women in front of children as young as,
[21:45.200 --> 21:53.520]  all newborns with the same weird fat obese brood mothers out there indoctrinating them
[21:53.520 --> 22:05.400]  into this open air mental institution at the Seattle Trans Parade and it goes on and on
[22:05.400 --> 22:14.920]  and on with children and young people marching with them, captured slaves and the Boy Scouts
[22:14.920 --> 22:26.160]  of America marching with their rainbow flags as captured slaves of this sex cult, of this
[22:26.160 --> 22:27.160]  pedophile cult.
[22:27.160 --> 22:33.400]  Again, I'm going to give you the hardcore stuff next segment.
[22:33.400 --> 22:44.440]  And young children, you've seen them twerking in little boys in many skirts at these parades.
[22:44.440 --> 22:49.880]  The footage we've got, a lot of it we can't show you from this event and from others because
[22:49.880 --> 22:51.920]  I'm not going to look at it.
[22:51.920 --> 22:56.920]  I'll look at it once to know what happened but I'm not going to subject you to this.
[22:56.920 --> 23:04.400]  Them cutting themselves, them urinating on each other, them eating feces off the ground.
[23:04.400 --> 23:08.520]  But as bad as that is, remember these are the folks that keep babies alive after they're
[23:08.520 --> 23:17.200]  born and sell their body parts.
[23:17.200 --> 23:20.640]  And just get it off the screen, okay?
[23:20.640 --> 23:27.480]  We're going to show some of this coming up.
[23:27.480 --> 23:29.120]  You know, maybe we shouldn't show it actually.
[23:29.120 --> 23:33.400]  I don't think I can look at it again but I'm going to explain this.
[23:33.400 --> 23:40.000]  I remember being 10 years old and I remember driving in the car with my mother and she
[23:40.000 --> 23:53.520]  was listening to NPR and they were playing tapes of Nixon talking about f-ing this and
[23:53.520 --> 23:55.280]  f-ing that.
[23:55.280 --> 24:00.160]  And I said to my mom, I said, how can they play someone saying the F word on the radio?
[24:00.160 --> 24:01.160]  You're not allowed to say this.
[24:01.160 --> 24:07.640]  Well, son, she works for newspapers, for documentary purposes when it's not done for
[24:07.640 --> 24:14.480]  a lewd reason but done for a documentary reason to show what happened so that it's not edited
[24:14.480 --> 24:18.400]  so that people can see what happened in context, you're allowed to do that.
[24:18.400 --> 24:21.040]  That's why you'll tune into PBS sometimes over the years.
[24:21.040 --> 24:25.960]  And if they want to demonize a right wing group or something, they will show really
[24:25.960 --> 24:26.960]  horrible stuff.
[24:26.960 --> 24:32.080]  That's how they show on CBS and ABC and NBC.
[24:32.080 --> 24:39.200]  In the 1960s, remember Walter Croncott famously, the little six-year-old girl totally naked,
[24:39.200 --> 24:44.040]  shows her genitals, her skins burn off on her arms and legs, hanging off and she's running
[24:44.040 --> 24:48.040]  and crying, she's been hit with nape bomb.
[24:48.040 --> 24:54.960]  Now you couldn't show and you wouldn't want to show a six-year-old naked girl in entertainment
[24:54.960 --> 24:58.720]  show because that would be lewd and disgusting and dehumanizing and wrong.
[24:58.720 --> 25:05.320]  But if you're trying to save a little girl from having nape bomb dropped on her and to
[25:05.320 --> 25:12.000]  show the horrors of war, you can show the naked little girl with the black burned skin
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.480]  hanging off her body.
[25:13.480 --> 25:15.680]  And that, of course, is famous footage.
[25:15.680 --> 25:18.080]  Do I need to show that to you?
[25:18.080 --> 25:23.000]  I don't want to look at that either, but I've seen it probably a hundred times.
[25:23.000 --> 25:30.160]  But when the left wants to get a point across, they can show you the horrors, but when they're
[25:30.160 --> 25:35.160]  parading children around and doing all this, we're not supposed to show you.
[25:35.160 --> 25:41.800]  They can do it, CNN can say the F word, they can say the SH-T word, and I don't even want
[25:41.800 --> 25:47.720]  to say those words, but the point is, we will be fine, we will be shut down by the FCC,
[25:47.720 --> 25:49.720]  we're not just on the Internet.
[25:49.720 --> 25:55.040]  We're not as free as the left to where they want.
[25:55.040 --> 26:01.360]  And that's really what all this is, is we're not supposed to, and I understand why people
[26:01.360 --> 26:07.200]  don't want to see this stuff, we're not supposed to, there's a black and white photo, there's
[26:07.200 --> 26:16.560]  famous color footage of it, we're not supposed to show you what they're doing, but they can
[26:16.560 --> 26:23.520]  parade little children around while this is going on, and it's disturbing.
[26:23.520 --> 26:28.000]  And I actually agree with the TV stations and the cable stations that have called us
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.840]  in the past and said, listen, we like your show, we agree with you, but our viewers just
[26:32.840 --> 26:40.280]  can't handle it, even if you're right, we get it, don't show it, don't show it, okay?
[26:40.280 --> 26:47.560]  How do I stop them if I don't show it, because believe me, I don't want to look at it, and
[26:47.560 --> 26:50.600]  I don't want to cover it, but here's the problem.
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.960]  If we don't show this, they're going to capture our children and get away with it in the dark
[26:54.960 --> 26:55.960]  of night.
[26:55.960 --> 27:00.320]  You think a jury or grand jury wants to see footage of some serial killer shot of a kid
[27:00.320 --> 27:05.160]  they kidnapped and tortured and murdered, you think the cops want to see that, you think
[27:05.160 --> 27:13.280]  I want to see that, I can barely do this broadcast right now, because I am so upset by what I've
[27:13.280 --> 27:18.800]  seen, and it's so horrible in front of children, people pissing on each other, people eating
[27:18.800 --> 27:25.440]  crap, people cutting themselves in front of children, as if fat, disgusting, pervert men
[27:25.440 --> 27:33.680]  pushing pedophilia isn't bad enough, that's the light end of what I've got.
[27:33.680 --> 27:36.800]  But I don't know what to do at this point, I actually don't know what to do, you know,
[27:36.800 --> 27:39.920]  people turn into talk shows here, confidence, they know what to do, and I usually know what
[27:39.920 --> 27:46.280]  to do about 99% of the time, but I'll be honest with you, I paradoxically agree with our affiliates
[27:46.280 --> 27:53.320]  not to show this, but at the same time, I have a responsibility to show it to you, because
[27:53.320 --> 27:57.960]  I don't want to just sit here and tell you what I've seen, I want to show you what I've
[27:57.960 --> 28:03.040]  seen, just like if I say Joe Biden's at the G7 right now, and he just said there's going
[28:03.040 --> 28:09.280]  to be imminent bio weapon releases and new lockdowns, when I say something I'll show
[28:09.280 --> 28:13.480]  you the clip, we'll show it next segment, oh and I tell you Donald Trump promised to
[28:13.480 --> 28:17.640]  overturn Roe v. Wade six years ago during the campaign trail, here's the video, I mean
[28:17.640 --> 28:24.520]  I neurotically show you, but our enemies are so bad, and what they're doing is so terrible
[28:24.520 --> 28:35.600]  that they can do it in the blue cities they control, but we can't show you, and they know
[28:35.600 --> 28:41.080]  that, and that's why they're winning, I mean I was talking to a Christian lady today at
[28:41.080 --> 28:47.120]  church, who sends her daughter to what was a conservative Christian large private school
[28:47.120 --> 28:52.520]  in Austin, they're going to take it over my leftist, and her six year old came home,
[28:52.520 --> 29:00.280]  and she's friends with my daughter, and said, two daddies, two mommies.
[29:00.280 --> 29:06.120]  The internet and talk radio are on fire, with the slogan, Alex Jones was right, people ask
[29:06.120 --> 29:10.480]  what's it like to be vindicated, well it's actually very sick feeling, because I knew
[29:10.480 --> 29:16.440]  this was coming, I tried to stop it, and now everything I've talked about is going to become
[29:16.440 --> 29:22.480]  more important than ever, because the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports,
[29:22.480 --> 29:28.040]  and documents, it's now out in the open, Klaus Schwab said last week, that they rule the
[29:28.040 --> 29:34.720]  earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group, so now the fight's out in the open,
[29:34.720 --> 29:38.280]  they're making their move, because they know they're behind schedule, we're going to win
[29:38.280 --> 29:42.080]  this thing, God's watching, the children are counting on us, I just want to thank the viewers
[29:42.080 --> 29:45.640]  and listeners for your word of mouth, and your prayer, and your financial support, because
[29:45.640 --> 29:49.960]  without you, info wars would not be here, so I want you to really internalize the fact
[29:49.960 --> 29:54.680]  that you are the info war, and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance, so
[29:54.680 --> 29:59.200]  I want to thank you, and salute you again for all you've done, and ask you now to redouble
[29:59.200 --> 30:00.480]  your efforts.
[30:00.480 --> 30:07.840]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right, thanks for holding her on the ear, go ahead.
[30:07.840 --> 30:13.800]  Hello, first of all, let me say I love your products, I am a granny, and for all the senior
[30:13.800 --> 30:19.200]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up the sunspots
[30:19.200 --> 30:24.160]  or age spots, as they're lovingly called, but since taking your x2 for the last couple
[30:24.160 --> 30:31.280]  of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually, people think I'm 55 years old, and
[30:31.280 --> 30:35.240]  I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well maybe that's
[30:35.240 --> 30:39.520]  what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[30:39.520 --> 30:44.480]  taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started
[30:44.480 --> 30:50.720]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[30:50.720 --> 30:56.080]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully,
[30:56.080 --> 31:00.280]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.

[33:01.120 --> 33:10.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:10.960 --> 33:38.280]  You could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion.
[33:38.280 --> 33:45.520]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[33:45.520 --> 33:55.120]  the mind of man, Thomas Jefferson, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's
[33:55.120 --> 33:56.120]  Alex Jones.
[33:56.120 --> 34:02.600]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying, and that's why they run the fake headline
[34:02.600 --> 34:09.960]  against myself, and Tucker Carlson, everywhere, every day, Jones admits he's an actor, or
[34:09.960 --> 34:13.680]  Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[34:13.680 --> 34:14.680]  Where do we say that?
[34:14.680 --> 34:20.200]  We never said that, they just say we said that, but where's the clip?
[34:20.200 --> 34:21.280]  Where's the article?
[34:21.280 --> 34:22.280]  Where do we say that?
[34:22.280 --> 34:23.280]  It doesn't exist.
[34:23.280 --> 34:28.040]  Alex Jones is playing a character, and is a performance artist.
[34:28.040 --> 34:31.080]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[34:31.080 --> 34:35.680]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[34:35.680 --> 34:37.760]  He's actually a performance artist.
[34:37.760 --> 34:39.280]  He's a performance artist.
[34:39.280 --> 34:41.280]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[34:41.280 --> 34:47.880]  They're lying to you, because they think you're stupid, and it's all based on a custody battle
[34:47.880 --> 34:51.920]  with my ex-wife five years ago, and she was trying to put into evidence of me dressed
[34:51.920 --> 34:57.560]  up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic saying take your Prozac kids,
[34:57.560 --> 35:03.640]  take your illegal drugs too, you'll die, it's fun, so people wouldn't take drugs.
[35:03.640 --> 35:06.520]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence, they look, he's insane telling kids to use
[35:06.520 --> 35:12.600]  drugs, and my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks
[35:12.600 --> 35:19.000]  that's really Jack Nicholson, so yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander, or Optimus Prime,
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.280]  Autobots, let's roll, or the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good,
[35:24.280 --> 35:25.280]  or Darth Vader.
[35:25.280 --> 35:28.280]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[35:28.280 --> 35:32.800]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[35:32.800 --> 35:34.800]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[35:34.800 --> 35:35.800]  No.
[35:35.800 --> 35:38.440]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Cobra Commander, the Joker?
[35:38.440 --> 35:39.440]  No.
[35:39.440 --> 35:44.800]  And clearly, no reasonable person would think, when I'm doing satire, that what I'm saying
[35:44.800 --> 35:46.560]  is what I really think.
[35:46.560 --> 35:51.320]  No one believes the Babylon Bee, it's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[35:51.320 --> 35:55.280]  Why the vaccinate me on Moodle today, it's required by the CDC.
[35:55.280 --> 36:00.360]  But they play those games, and that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[36:00.360 --> 36:05.000]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out,
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.200]  and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[36:09.200 --> 36:12.960]  Every day when I leave work, I do this, that man's a threat to this country.
[36:12.960 --> 36:15.240]  And they go, look, he admitted in court, he's an actor.
[36:15.240 --> 36:21.240]  Well yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly, I was an actor in Waking Life, I was an actor
[36:21.240 --> 36:24.760]  when I was Cobra Commander.
[36:24.760 --> 36:29.640]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles
[36:29.640 --> 36:34.640]  to you, isn't a real thing, and isn't something I'm actually saying, and you know that.
[36:34.640 --> 36:39.600]  You're insulted right now, I'm even explaining that to you, and so am I, but that's who
[36:39.600 --> 36:42.320]  these people are.
[36:42.320 --> 36:46.640]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[36:46.640 --> 36:48.200]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[36:48.200 --> 36:54.040]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented, he's smart, he's funny as hell, he's truly
[36:54.040 --> 36:55.040]  funny.
[36:55.040 --> 37:04.040]  I'm kind of retarded.
[37:04.040 --> 37:10.200]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what
[37:10.200 --> 37:15.160]  I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola
[37:15.160 --> 37:21.240]  on InfoWars.com that has all the cited information, the latest tragedy sudden adult death syndrome?
[37:21.240 --> 37:24.000]  No, that's a real thing.
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.160]  That's something happening in the real world, and that's what we're breaking down here
[37:28.160 --> 37:29.160]  today.
[37:29.160 --> 37:33.760]  I am Alex Jones, and I am the guy on this show every day.
[37:33.760 --> 37:38.760]  I am an American, and that's what I promote is freedom, and justice, and liberty, and
[37:38.760 --> 37:45.760]  they can't stand it.
[37:45.760 --> 37:54.600]  Alright folks, I'm just going to be completely honest with the audience, I'm having trouble
[37:54.600 --> 38:02.760]  doing the show right now, because it's just all sometimes hits me, and it's hard to maintain
[38:02.760 --> 38:07.040]  focus here with all the stuff that's going on happening, and that's part of the enemy
[38:07.040 --> 38:14.080]  plan, but I'll just say this, it's normal to not be able to deal with all this.
[38:14.080 --> 38:22.640]  Everything that's being done is so incredibly evil, is so absolutely out of control that
[38:22.640 --> 38:28.840]  a normal person is meant to just recoil from it, but that's what they want to do, is exercise
[38:28.840 --> 38:33.200]  all this corruption and just throw it in our face, till we don't even know what to do and
[38:33.200 --> 38:34.200]  we just give up.
[38:34.200 --> 38:40.800]  We can't let that happen, but sometimes we're going to falter, sometimes it's going to really,
[38:40.800 --> 38:46.200]  really get to us, but the most important thing to do like a surgeon is to remove your emotion
[38:46.200 --> 38:51.960]  from it and just coldly stand against it and resist it, knowing that you're doing it for
[38:51.960 --> 38:54.800]  the innocence of the children and the future of the species.
[38:54.800 --> 38:59.960]  Now when I say that bit of advice, I'm telling myself that, I'm not lecturing you, I'm telling
[38:59.960 --> 39:10.400]  myself, hey, control yourself, don't get upset, just coldly analyze what's happening.
[39:10.400 --> 39:14.760]  I tend to have trouble doing that, so I tend to really get upset by this, or I tend to
[39:14.760 --> 39:21.040]  get really sarcastic and angry and make sick jokes about it, but I'm not having fun while
[39:21.040 --> 39:28.760]  I'm doing that, so I mean, I'll just tell you what's happened here, folks.
[39:28.760 --> 39:32.880]  I've got a human animal cloning stack here that I was going to cover Thursday and Friday
[39:32.880 --> 39:40.080]  and Saturday at a show that's so horrible that I just, I just feel overwhelmed by it,
[39:40.080 --> 39:42.680]  and I know you do too.
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.720]  And then I've got, Biden is saying a second pandemic is imminent, get ready to lose all
[39:47.720 --> 39:52.000]  your rights again, and it's on record, they launched the attack, they launched the previous
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.280]  attack, they've now legalized through their emergency authorization, shooting six month
[39:57.280 --> 39:59.760]  olds and up with these deadly shots.
[39:59.760 --> 40:03.720]  We have the British Medical Journal coming out, they're editor, and doing a whole big
[40:03.720 --> 40:09.920]  article on an index of mainline studies, all confirming that these shots are not vaccines
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.480]  that destroy your immune system, and they give you heart attacks and blood clots and
[40:15.480 --> 40:16.480]  so much more.
[40:16.480 --> 40:21.920]  I mean, that alone is just like, whoa, they're really doing this, and even though I knew
[40:21.920 --> 40:27.960]  it was their plan, I knew they'd test this out around the world, in beta tests, it is
[40:27.960 --> 40:36.760]  just so insane, and it's so sad, and you see the blue cities collapsing, you see everywhere
[40:36.760 --> 40:42.720]  the left controls things falling apart by design, and you just say to yourself, why
[40:42.720 --> 40:43.720]  is it so horrible?
[40:43.720 --> 40:49.920]  And it's because by increment we were tolerant of evil, myself included, and now it is absolutely
[40:49.920 --> 40:57.200]  run rampant over everyone, and it's just getting started.
[40:57.200 --> 41:03.920]  I mean, here's another example, and I'm not mad at Owen, I'm not mad at the crew, I'm
[41:03.920 --> 41:10.760]  not mad at myself, but I had to do a special show yesterday that was not on TV or radio
[41:10.760 --> 41:16.240]  stations, that was just to info wars viewers, and about a half million people tuned into
[41:16.240 --> 41:19.640]  the streams, we have the numbers and a little over half million have watched the video.
[41:19.640 --> 41:24.000]  So that's great, we came into the two hour emergency show yesterday, with Savannah Hernandez
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.840]  and Drew Hernandez, no relation, two great investigative journalists, in DC outside the
[41:28.840 --> 41:33.200]  Supreme Court, and the left came over, even though they didn't know they were with info
[41:33.200 --> 41:39.240]  wars, and screamed and yelled and attacked them, because they weren't ramped with MSNBC
[41:39.240 --> 41:49.520]  or MPR, or the Huffington Post, and Custon screamed so much that you can't have your
[41:49.520 --> 41:55.720]  reporters on from these crowds, because they're so vile, just like you can't show them parading
[41:55.720 --> 42:02.480]  scantily clad children with naked men pissing on each other, because you can't put that
[42:02.480 --> 42:10.360]  on TV, and I agree, but they do it in the middle of the damn street.
[42:10.360 --> 42:16.640]  And so it's that paradox that Owen is downtown at the Beto O'Rourke rally that starts in
[42:16.640 --> 42:20.440]  20 minutes, and he's going to be on with us, and I was just sitting back thinking, hey
[42:20.440 --> 42:26.400]  did we think for the 10,000th time, Owen can't be at one of those rallies, they're all going
[42:26.400 --> 42:30.520]  to attack him, and all it's going to be is solid F bombs.
[42:30.520 --> 42:34.400]  Did anybody think of that, I'm not mad at the crew, I'm not mad at myself, Owen was
[42:34.400 --> 42:37.240]  right here an hour before the show, he said all right boss, I'm going to go down there,
[42:37.240 --> 42:40.760]  I'll see it five, I'll be down there at 430, live feeds, we'll have more feeds, and I'm
[42:40.760 --> 42:43.720]  just sitting there, okay Owen we'll see you on the show, and I'm sitting here in the break,
[42:43.720 --> 42:48.760]  it's the same thing, I can't show you all the pedophile stuff in Seattle, because it's
[42:48.760 --> 42:52.880]  quite frankly illegal, but they can do it in front of the kids, and then I can't even
[42:52.880 --> 42:57.160]  have a damn reporter out there, because these people are such animals, you know let's
[42:57.160 --> 43:04.160]  kind of tweak through this folks.
[43:27.240 --> 43:32.280]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself, these other three together, it is
[43:32.280 --> 43:39.120]  amazing, 60% off, then the trapecta immune support, 50% off, on immune support, X2 and
[43:39.120 --> 43:46.120]  D3 gummies, and then 40% off on X2, now back in stock at M4store.com, now just the X2 alone
[43:47.160 --> 43:51.880]  is the missing link with most people, highest quality deep breath crystal iodine, beyond
[43:51.880 --> 43:56.080]  critical for your immune system and your whole body, it's 40% off back in stock, but
[43:56.080 --> 43:59.760]  you get four of the products together for 60% off.
[43:59.760 --> 44:06.480]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all, and if we
[44:06.480 --> 44:12.680]  don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse, but as bad as things are, we still
[44:12.680 --> 44:19.280]  have time to prepare, and that alone is something to be grateful for, a gravity water filter
[44:19.280 --> 44:24.680]  will provide you with clean healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut
[44:24.680 --> 44:29.960]  off, and having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA
[44:29.960 --> 44:35.680]  camps, and if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider
[44:35.680 --> 44:41.680]  stocking up for your neighbors, some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's
[44:41.680 --> 44:48.680]  coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration,
[44:48.680 --> 44:55.680]  whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully, stock up now at preparetoday.com
[45:18.680 --> 45:35.040]  and get it discounted up to 30% off when you get it with other documentary films, like
[45:35.040 --> 45:39.760]  in-game blueprint for global enslavement, the seminal classic that predicted the great
[45:39.760 --> 45:45.320]  reset, and of course part one, part two, and now the new part three of COVID land, get
[45:45.320 --> 45:50.640]  them separate, get them together, massively discounted at infowarstore.com, but everyone
[45:50.640 --> 45:57.000]  needs to have 2,000 mules in their library so the globalists can't censor it, infowarstore.com
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.800]  to get 2,000 mules today.
[46:00.800 --> 46:05.920]  So I did it, I signed up for the Austin Marathon, I've been training probably not as much as
[46:05.920 --> 46:11.360]  they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarstore.com, before
[46:11.360 --> 46:16.640]  I start out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get
[46:16.640 --> 46:21.640]  going, you know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.480]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids
[46:26.480 --> 46:30.640]  for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[46:30.640 --> 46:36.600]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' sore list, I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[46:36.600 --> 46:41.280]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[46:41.280 --> 46:43.640]  support and extra flexibility.
[46:43.640 --> 46:48.200]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[46:48.200 --> 46:52.920]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, turbo force that can
[46:52.920 --> 46:56.920]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep
[46:56.920 --> 47:01.480]  you moving and feeling great at any age.
[47:01.480 --> 47:16.240]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:16.240 --> 47:36.960]  From the front lines of the war against the Satanists, the Alex Jones show.
[47:36.960 --> 47:41.760]  Evil is coming out of the closet at every level.
[47:41.760 --> 47:48.400]  Human animal cloning, open borders, devalued currency, massive sex trafficking, pedophilia,
[47:48.400 --> 47:58.440]  world government, world IDs, new virus releases, just absolute insane tyranny.
[47:58.440 --> 48:12.200]  And the paradox of the left being so nasty and so hateful and parading quasi-naked children
[48:12.200 --> 48:19.360]  with naked men and women down the main thoroughfares, down the main streets of cities across the
[48:19.360 --> 48:21.880]  country.
[48:21.880 --> 48:25.040]  And we have our morals.
[48:25.040 --> 48:26.920]  We don't want to see this.
[48:26.920 --> 48:29.040]  We don't want to show people this.
[48:29.040 --> 48:35.680]  And that's how they're winning, because no one's going to go stop them.
[48:35.680 --> 48:40.760]  And they've got access to our children, but we then can't even show the world what they're
[48:40.760 --> 48:41.760]  doing.
[48:41.760 --> 48:42.760]  And then it hit me during the last break.
[48:42.760 --> 48:43.760]  That's why I got so mad.
[48:43.760 --> 48:48.000]  We're about to go to Owen Shroyer at a Beto or Rourke rally, and I guarantee you those
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.400]  demonic freaks are going to be cussing and screaming and running around naked and everything
[48:53.400 --> 48:54.400]  else.
[48:54.400 --> 48:57.000]  We're going to show that.
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.560]  So it's a paradox, and it just, paradoxes give me a headache.
[49:01.560 --> 49:05.520]  I mean, it really gets, and listen, I'm a strong guy.
[49:05.520 --> 49:06.520]  I think you're strong.
[49:06.520 --> 49:07.920]  A lot of you out there listening are strong people.
[49:07.920 --> 49:09.840]  That's why you do it and you care.
[49:09.840 --> 49:13.960]  You think I want to look at this footage?
[49:13.960 --> 49:21.040]  We got stuff so horrible that as a grown man, it hurts me to look at it.
[49:21.040 --> 49:23.000]  You know, here's an analogy.
[49:23.000 --> 49:30.560]  I've had friends and I've had family that wanted to help people who became paramedics.
[49:30.560 --> 49:32.120]  And people talk about police officers.
[49:32.120 --> 49:39.800]  On average, that's a very hard, tough, rough, stressful job you put your life in your hands.
[49:39.800 --> 49:43.160]  Last night, 315, my wife wakes me up.
[49:43.160 --> 49:45.800]  There's a man trying to break in the front door.
[49:45.800 --> 49:50.480]  He runs off, gets in his car, drives off.
[49:50.480 --> 49:57.920]  Police were there in four minutes, APD and Sheriff's Department.
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.320]  And I said, do you think it's a burglar?
[50:01.320 --> 50:05.040]  And he said, no, I think it's somebody that doesn't like you.
[50:05.040 --> 50:08.400]  And I think you know that from your description, my wife's description.
[50:08.400 --> 50:14.440]  Somebody all in black with a tactical belt and a bunch of, she described it as different
[50:14.440 --> 50:25.280]  packages, different little containers, all over a lower pack around his back.
[50:25.280 --> 50:31.560]  He's all in black.
[50:31.560 --> 50:33.160]  And that's just who these people are, folks.
[50:33.160 --> 50:38.000]  They are a creeping army of evil that wants our children, that wants to assault us in
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.520]  our houses, and they're all over the place stalking and sneaking and doing all this.
[50:43.520 --> 50:51.920]  And going back to the police, if you think police have a tough job, paramedics have an
[50:51.920 --> 50:52.920]  even worse job.
[50:52.920 --> 50:56.720]  And so the firefighters, they assist that, and the cops have to see it too.
[50:56.720 --> 51:01.720]  I've only seen a few fatal car wrecks where I pulled over to render aid.
[51:01.720 --> 51:05.760]  And man, you walk up and somebody's got blood spraying out of the side of their crowded artery
[51:05.760 --> 51:11.000]  and they're flopping around with their arms cut off.
[51:11.000 --> 51:22.280]  And one wreck I saw when I was about 15 was a friend that was driving a few years older.
[51:22.280 --> 51:24.040]  He pulled over to render aid.
[51:24.040 --> 51:25.760]  This is Corvette was racing this other car.
[51:25.760 --> 51:33.080]  They shot past this 150 miles an hour, had a blowout, the Corvette spun like a top down
[51:33.080 --> 51:39.040]  the street, turned up forward, spun and twisted into pieces, and there were three people in
[51:39.040 --> 51:43.160]  the Corvette, even though it was a two seater, two men and a woman.
[51:43.160 --> 51:47.720]  And I saw their bodies in the air flying around, and we pulled over to help them.
[51:47.720 --> 51:51.480]  Just in the two minutes by the time we pulled over, got to help them, and one had blood
[51:51.480 --> 51:54.600]  spraying out their neck and the cut off arm and all of it.
[51:54.600 --> 51:59.840]  This man gets up with blood pouring all out of him, young man, and he already had fire
[51:59.840 --> 52:04.520]  ants all over him to the summer just staining.
[52:04.520 --> 52:16.680]  And the reason I tell this story I've told it before is I'll just never forget that.
[52:16.680 --> 52:24.080]  And watching two of them die before the paramedics got there and trying to help them and trying
[52:24.080 --> 52:28.760]  to put our hands on their necks and trying to rip their pants off to do a tourniquet
[52:28.760 --> 52:35.600]  and the best we knew, because I've been on a swim team and when I was a couple years
[52:35.600 --> 52:40.200]  they had the fire department come out and do the basic tourniquet, basic helmet maneuver,
[52:40.200 --> 52:44.960]  basic resuscitation, mouth-to-mouth training, so I know a little bit of that.
[52:44.960 --> 52:47.060]  And I'm a tough guy.
[52:47.060 --> 52:51.960]  Only a few car wrecks I saw, I still have nightmares about that.
[52:51.960 --> 52:54.600]  I still have nightmares about that.
[52:54.600 --> 52:56.160]  And our enemies are using that against us.
[52:56.160 --> 52:58.720]  And I have a lot of friends who've gone to be paramedics.
[52:58.720 --> 52:59.720]  One of them works here.
[52:59.720 --> 53:00.720]  She's finally got a degree.
[53:00.720 --> 53:03.760]  She's been a great lady, Catherine.
[53:03.760 --> 53:07.400]  And she just finally got her certificate and waited about six months and got her first
[53:07.400 --> 53:08.400]  job.
[53:08.400 --> 53:12.160]  And she's this little, sweet, innocent woman who cares about people and she's about to
[53:12.160 --> 53:17.880]  be going to houses with OD people and babies that died in the bathtub and burned down houses
[53:17.880 --> 53:20.080]  and car wrecks and shooting victims.
[53:20.080 --> 53:27.840]  And I just thought how admirable that is to be able to go see that stuff every single
[53:27.840 --> 53:36.720]  day and not go crazy, because I'll be honest with you.
[53:36.720 --> 53:40.720]  I don't know how long I can do this show, not because of the new world order's threats,
[53:40.720 --> 53:44.360]  not because of their attacks, not because their persecution of me personally.
[53:44.360 --> 53:45.840]  That makes me fight harder.
[53:45.840 --> 53:52.040]  But man, I just don't like looking at them parading half naked kids with naked men while
[53:52.040 --> 54:00.080]  they piss on each other in Seattle or San Francisco.
[54:00.080 --> 54:04.760]  I mean, the stuff we're showing you is the stuff we can show you.
[54:04.760 --> 54:16.560]  We have stuff so horrible that I am torn on whether or not we should show it.
[54:16.560 --> 54:18.760]  And you know, I have a feeling of guilt.
[54:18.760 --> 54:26.000]  Even though I'm not part of this and I'm not doing this, I feel absolutely horrible knowing
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  this.
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.800]  And I get why most people don't want to be a police officer or a soldier or a paramedic
[54:31.800 --> 54:35.040]  and believe me, people in the military will tell you, it's those trauma doctors and nurses
[54:35.040 --> 54:36.560]  got the worst job.
[54:36.560 --> 54:41.280]  Men and women coming in with their arms and legs blown off begging for mama every day.
[54:41.280 --> 54:44.560]  But I'll say that's what my job's like.
[54:44.560 --> 54:48.840]  And I get why people don't want to admit the new world order and don't want to admit the
[54:48.840 --> 54:54.680]  human trafficking, because we went down last year quite a few times the Texas border and
[54:54.680 --> 54:55.680]  I haven't gone back.
[54:55.680 --> 54:59.920]  We went down there myself three or four times, the crew about 10 times and when the crew
[54:59.920 --> 55:05.640]  comes back, they don't want to go back because to see America broken, to see the border totally
[55:05.640 --> 55:11.600]  wide open and to go to facilities run by the U.S. government where there are literally
[55:11.600 --> 55:18.400]  pedophiles coming out and saying, I want children, why are you here trying to stop me?
[55:18.400 --> 55:23.120]  And like I want that eight year old girl and they sign it over and hand them over or people
[55:23.120 --> 55:32.120]  just taking babies with no ID and just putting them on a plane with random people and you
[55:32.120 --> 55:45.200]  see this and then you know they're getting away with it and it's so incredibly upsetting.
[55:45.200 --> 55:47.360]  And so we've got to figure this out.
[55:47.360 --> 55:53.800]  The enemy knows they're doing this on purpose and they know this designed to break her will
[55:53.800 --> 55:56.040]  and it's not going to break her will.
[55:56.040 --> 56:00.560]  But I'm not going to sit up here and put on an act on this broadcast tonight and act
[56:00.560 --> 56:05.720]  like that this isn't tearing my guts out.
[56:05.720 --> 56:09.400]  That's why most people that are paramedics do it five, six years and no matter how good
[56:09.400 --> 56:12.480]  their intentions, man, you just can't do it anymore.
[56:12.480 --> 56:16.200]  I was talking to one of the folks that worked here who'd been a paramedic and he became
[56:16.200 --> 56:20.480]  a police officer and he went into radio sales because he just couldn't handle it anymore.
[56:20.480 --> 56:24.960]  He was a paramedic for about 10 years, police officer for six and he said when he finally
[56:24.960 --> 56:32.840]  quit being a paramedic was they go in this house in South Austin and there's a two year
[56:32.840 --> 56:39.800]  old non responsive blue in the face that got into the parents methamphetamine because they
[56:39.800 --> 56:49.520]  saw daddy smoking it and he had to quit the job because he basically almost killed the
[56:49.520 --> 57:01.000]  father and the mother because while he's trying to save the two year old, these people start
[57:01.000 --> 57:07.360]  shooting their mouths off and the police had to restrain him and but before they could
[57:07.360 --> 57:12.760]  restrain him, he'd already bashed in one of their heads and it just comes down to that
[57:12.760 --> 57:24.400]  point and you know, I'm ashamed of humanity that we have this many evil people and I want
[57:24.400 --> 57:29.280]  to say this, the left know they're evil, they love it, they think it's fun and I just can't
[57:29.280 --> 57:34.160]  even imagine loving evil and loving hurting people and loving hurting children and all
[57:34.160 --> 57:38.760]  I know is this, God's real and you're going to pay for what you've done.
[57:38.760 --> 57:45.840]  We are eternal spirits and I think hell was the main thing, no, you deserve eternal pain
[57:45.840 --> 58:15.800]  for what you've done and you will, you will and you know it too.
[58:15.840 --> 58:34.760]  We have the best deals on high quality, storeable food and a whole spectrum of other preparedness

[59:26.800 --> 59:30.960]  the most important as you can make is to have high quality, storeable food, water filtration,
[59:30.960 --> 59:34.880]  air filtration and more and it's not just those items, it's hundreds of other high quality

[59:52.800 --> 1:00:04.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:08.320]  What do you want to do with your life?
[1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:10.320]  I want to rock.
[1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:17.320]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're going to see some serious shit.
[1:00:17.320 --> 1:00:21.760]  You know someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to
[1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:29.600]  America it will come in the name of liberalism.
[1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:34.320]  Those who seek to infer are not phased by gun control laws.
[1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:36.320]  I've happened a personal experience.
[1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:47.280]  I don't think that you should look back in one belly ache or try to hold somebody else
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:48.760]  guilty for everything you did.
[1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:49.760]  Why is the beef?
[1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:50.760]  All right.
[1:00:50.760 --> 1:00:51.760]  What is the trilateral commission?
[1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:55.760]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockwell.
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:01:01.720]  You see what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members and
[1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:07.880]  the positions of power in this country to work to erase national boundaries, create
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:14.440]  an international community, and in time bring about a one world government with David Rockabeller
[1:01:14.440 --> 1:01:16.760]  calling the shots.
[1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:21.240]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons
[1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:26.480]  to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, congressional investigators in recent months
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:31.920]  have tried to learn if Nina Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to
[1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:33.760]  the U.S. backpunt for rebels.
[1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:40.320]  It all begins in 1982 when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Nina Arkansas.
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:44.320]  He used to smuggle drugs and he got caught and he became one of the government's most
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:46.840]  valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:52.320]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seal's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:57.360]  17-year-old Kevin Irons and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:01.560]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:04.400]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:11.000]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  an airplane.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:16.160]  The pairs in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:17.160]  train.
[1:02:17.160 --> 1:02:21.040]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed this ruling from probable homicide
[1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:23.160]  to definite homicide.
[1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:25.000]  I'm scared of these people.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:32.560]  I'm very scared of them.
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:34.560]  How you think the crack drop hits into the country?
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:36.480]  We don't own any planes.
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:37.840]  We don't own no ships.
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:41.240]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:45.160]  I will tell you, Director George, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective that
[1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:50.520]  the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:54.960]  Some who were working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:57.640]  in the Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:01.360]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back, they say the
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:02.920]  ends justify the means.
[1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:08.360]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at
[1:03:08.360 --> 1:03:09.360]  Mina, Arkansas.
[1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:17.440]  This base was set up by George Bush in all over North and the CIA to help the Iran countries
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:22.280]  and they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United
[1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:26.960]  States and then they took some money and bought weapons and took them back to the country
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:30.080]  as all of which was illegal, as you know, under the law and act.
[1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:34.360]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because they're nice of
[1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:35.360]  security?
[1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:42.160]  We had nothing zero to do with it and everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:47.680]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:50.680]  These allegations are false.
[1:03:50.680 --> 1:04:14.680]  I need your money to kill babies by abortion.
[1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:18.680]  You, taxpayer, give me your money to pay for baby telling.
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:21.160]  No, I don't believe in abortion.
[1:04:21.160 --> 1:04:22.160]  I don't care.
[1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:25.560]  Render to Caesar what to Caesar's.
[1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:27.560]  Give me money to kill babies.
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:29.880]  All right, all right, I'll pay you.
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:30.880]  Don't hit me anymore.
[1:04:30.880 --> 1:04:31.880]  Please, please, kill my baby.
[1:04:31.880 --> 1:04:32.880]  Kill my baby.
[1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:33.880]  You.
[1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:34.880]  Kill that woman's baby.
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:35.880]  Yes.
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:36.880]  Yes.
[1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:37.880]  Yes.
[1:04:37.880 --> 1:04:38.880]  Yes.
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:05:02.040]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with
[1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:04.000]  word of mouth and prayer.

[1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:11.960]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:14.600]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[1:05:14.600 --> 1:05:17.880]  That's what I want to thank you all for buying products and InfoWarsStore.com, like books
[1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:21.680]  and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.

[1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:16.240]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones show.
[1:06:16.240 --> 1:06:24.160]  The left are lowering our defense shields.
[1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:29.080]  They're committing massive satanic crimes in front of God so that God will remove his
[1:06:29.080 --> 1:06:32.760]  hedge of protection so that evil can have its way.
[1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:37.360]  All of the pedophilia, all the satanism, all the sexualization of children, all the drag
[1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:44.920]  queen pedophile time, all of it is to lower our defenses and set it up where we accept
[1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:50.280]  it and don't say no to it so that God removes the protection so that Satan can have his
[1:06:50.280 --> 1:06:51.440]  way with the planet.
[1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:56.480]  It is biblical, it is historical, it is a fact, it is going on.
[1:06:56.480 --> 1:07:01.360]  So as upset as I got in the last hour and that was 100% real and me just trying to get control
[1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:06.920]  of myself, let me talk about the positives here.
[1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:13.840]  God is in control, history is repeating itself, we have free will and in the end God wins.
[1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:16.080]  Know that the evil will be punished.
[1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:20.480]  And hey, we just saw Roe v. Wade overturned, they've got all their arguments for abortion
[1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:24.360]  all day long but the people running it want baby parts.
[1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:27.360]  The people running it want humans to be a commodity.
[1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:32.240]  The people orchestrating this whole operation want to kill the old people and kill everybody
[1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:37.200]  and they're saying we're all non-essential and we're worthless.
[1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:43.920]  And so we have to understand that we had a major victory with the Supreme Court ruling
[1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:48.880]  saying all across this country starting with New York governments can't bar non-fillings
[1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:53.080]  from owning guns or concealed carries another huge victory.
[1:07:53.080 --> 1:07:58.240]  There's not just evil in the universe but when good men do nothing evil triumphs.
[1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:02.960]  Thomas Jefferson was asked in a letter, how do we defeat evil?
[1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:04.920]  How do we defeat corruption?
[1:08:04.920 --> 1:08:11.080]  And what is the level that tyrants will go to to fight us during a Revolutionary War?
[1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:21.120]  He said the level of tyranny that tyrants will take us to is whatever level you will
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:22.360]  accept.
[1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:27.360]  There's no limit to these people.
[1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:30.400]  And you're seeing that.
[1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:35.360]  So I've decided what I'm going to do.
[1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:38.500]  I talked about it all last hour, I know we had a lot of radio stations and people tuning
[1:08:38.500 --> 1:08:44.120]  in every millisecond, millions tuned in, but last hour I came here today with what I was
[1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:51.640]  going to cover and then I saw the parades across the country, the quote gay parades,
[1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:57.560]  the gay pride parades and it was so horrible and then it reminded me of all those other
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:01.880]  footage that's so horrible we can't show it to you that I had that discussion we have
[1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:02.880]  a lot of.
[1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:06.920]  I totally get our affiliates saying do not show this, we're showing them all the stuff
[1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:10.120]  right now.
[1:09:10.120 --> 1:09:14.960]  But what do we do and it's a real question and you know maybe I should open the phones
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:15.960]  up.
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:16.960]  In fact, I'm not maybe.
[1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:21.400]  I'm going to ask listeners that question and I'm going to go with what you say.
[1:09:21.400 --> 1:09:26.320]  I'm going to take 10 phone calls coming up by the hour.
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:29.720]  And then I'm going to do what I'm not punting.
[1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:35.500]  I really need to go with what these random callers say.
[1:09:35.500 --> 1:09:42.120]  Do we show you them eating poop or pissing in each other's faces in front of children?
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:46.600]  Do we show you naked children at these parades?
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:48.720]  That's happening.
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:53.360]  Do we show you stuff that I don't want to look at and you don't want to look at but
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:58.360]  they're doing it so if we don't show it, we're actually covering it up.
[1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:00.040]  And that's my paradox here.
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:07.880]  That's why I'm physically sick because in my life 99% of the time stuff is cut and dry.
[1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:09.160]  You know what, I think I have the answer.
[1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:13.440]  I said I'd take your calls and ask the question and I still want your view on it but we have
[1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:20.440]  banned out video and it's our own platform, it's not on TV or radio and if people want
[1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:26.280]  to know what they're doing, maybe I should just take all these clips and put them together
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:32.640]  and just say this is for criminal investigation, viewer discretion is advised, this is what
[1:10:32.640 --> 1:10:35.360]  we're looking at.
[1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:36.720]  Hours of it.
[1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:37.720]  The new stuff, the old stuff.
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:45.120]  I mean it's so, it's worse than car wrecks I've seen.
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:50.200]  Watching people bleed out was an easier thing to do and I'm not bitching or saying I'm a
[1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:54.080]  victim or complaining, I'm saying I get our affiliates.
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:59.720]  No one wants to look at this who's normal but what am I supposed to do?
[1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:07.280]  If I was running a grand jury in diving these people for a decency with a child, and again
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:12.760]  remember what we're showing you is not on a scale of 1-10, we're showing you the 1s.
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:20.240]  We're not showing you the 2s, the 3s, the 4s, the 5s, the 6s, the 7s, the 8s, the 9s,
[1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:21.240]  the 10s.
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:25.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have footage, it's like Hunter Biden's laptop.
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:32.320]  I went in there before the election ended and right when the laptop came out one night
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:37.840]  I said about four or five hours and I said I've heard what's on this laptop, I did not
[1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:41.120]  expect any crew to look at this, it may be a crime to look at this.
[1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:45.400]  I said I'm going to start clicking on this and watching it and I walked out after three
[1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:52.480]  hours and I said, and we put a memo out, I said I'm ordering our crew, do not look at
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:12:03.440]  that laptop and do not click on that.
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:11.640]  Because I've lived 47, God that was already two years ago, I've lived 46 years, I've never
[1:12:11.640 --> 1:12:14.440]  seen nothing like that in my life.
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:27.920]  And I only spent three hours, folks, it was tens of thousands of videos.
[1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:29.640]  And what is the FBI doing?
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:34.680]  It's trying to indict media outlets that do publish it and do make it available because
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:40.880]  it's illegal to show that, that affiliate is illegal, it should be.
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:48.760]  Never Biden having sex with his niece and shooting trophy videos is illegal because I'm going
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:54.600]  to ask you again the paradox, at one level I feel like a coward, I'm not showing you
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:13:01.640]  this and I'm not looking at it because you know what, my mind, one time Barbara Bush
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:08.120]  was asked about the Iraq war and millions dead and she said my mind's too beautiful
[1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:09.120]  to even think about that.
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:13.920]  So let me tell you something, my mind ain't beautiful, but it sure as hell ain't a toxic
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:14.920]  waste dump.
[1:13:14.920 --> 1:13:18.600]  We got O and now we're going to break them back to him, we're coming back to you in
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:20.720]  five minutes on.
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:27.240]  And so this really becomes the paradoxical moment where we can't look at Hunter Biden's
[1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:32.120]  laptop, it's illegal, it's so criminal.
[1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:41.280]  And the FBI has it for two and a half years and has done zero about it, which is an endorsement
[1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:47.800]  of everything that happens in it and that's what I'm saying, it's that I started just
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:58.800]  going through clicking the stuff and I was like what the hell is that, I mean, you know,
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:05.760]  is when you look at something, you become a part of it ladies and gentlemen.
[1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:10.680]  So I don't know the paradox, I don't know how we deal with this when they're committing
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:21.520]  crimes so massive that I can't even look at it and I've got a stack of articles right
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:33.200]  here in videos that would make a billy goat puke.
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:39.280]  So I'm just, I'm kind of stuck in this right now because I just don't know how to mentally
[1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:44.080]  work through this, spiritually work through this.
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:49.400]  And I've gotten the point where I don't even want to investigate these people anymore
[1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:52.640]  because it's so horrible.
[1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:54.360]  And then I feel like a coward.
[1:14:54.360 --> 1:15:01.960]  I've never been a coward my whole life, but I'll admit it.
[1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:09.640]  These people are so evil, so twisted, so dark that I'm afraid to look at what they're even
[1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:14.480]  doing anymore and what happens when they're above the law and they don't get in trouble
[1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:27.960]  and they're doing stuff so bad, so evil that grown men can't even look at it.
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:35.960]  Videos of Hunter Biden raping his niece, think about that.
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:40.040]  And that's just the start of it.
[1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:43.640]  And that's who these people are and that's who runs our country.
[1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:45.640]  And of course, they've got access to our children.
[1:15:45.640 --> 1:15:49.880]  Of course, they're trying to sexualize them because they're pedophiles.
[1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:55.840]  And folks, the pedophilia is just the admittance to the door fee.
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:16:07.880]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:14.400]  prince, that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are
[1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:15.400]  lost.
[1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:20.560]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you
[1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:28.880]  get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:29.880]  You have a concussion.
[1:16:29.880 --> 1:16:31.680]  And that's what the globalists have done.
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:33.080]  They have stunned us.
[1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:38.040]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently
[1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:39.040]  came out and gave him speech.
[1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:43.680]  He called the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:48.760]  in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide
[1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:50.920]  humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:52.440]  That's what the great reset is.
[1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:53.960]  They need darkness to thrive.

[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:10.240]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way, pray to God but row away from the rocks.
[1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:14.360]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on
[1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:16.560]  and killed but also try to row away.

[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:03.480]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones is right.
[1:19:03.480 --> 1:19:04.920]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:10.680]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it
[1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:15.920]  and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[1:19:15.920 --> 1:19:21.040]  the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:27.280]  Now, out in the open, Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg
[1:19:27.280 --> 1:19:29.240]  Group founded Davos Group.
[1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:34.360]  So now, the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're
[1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:35.360]  behind schedule.
[1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:36.360]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:38.360]  God's watching, the children are counting on us.
[1:19:38.360 --> 1:19:42.080]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:45.480]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:49.840]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are
[1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:52.200]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:56.720]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[1:19:56.720 --> 1:19:58.520]  your efforts.
[1:19:58.520 --> 1:20:20.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:20.480 --> 1:20:40.920]  I don't know if we'll talk about this next segment, have you seen the footage of the
[1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:45.160]  pedophile parades happening around the country where children are being marched, including
[1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:51.600]  the Boy Scouts, with naked men and women with their genitals hanging out, and that's only
[1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:53.520]  the beginning of this.
[1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:56.440]  There's stuff so horrible we can't even show it on air.
[1:20:56.440 --> 1:21:01.400]  This is just evil coming right out of the pit of hell, and the good news is we forced
[1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:07.640]  them out in the open, so I shouldn't be so down about this, but Owen, you're amongst
[1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:12.320]  some really deceived people, but also a lot of them we know actually love it and tell
[1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:13.800]  us they love death.
[1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:18.560]  Yeah, one guy was actually willing to talk to me and said that that's what he was out
[1:21:18.560 --> 1:21:24.080]  here for, that exact reason, but let me just kind of give you a briefing on what's happened,
[1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:25.080]  Alex.
[1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:26.080]  I fired up a video.
[1:21:26.080 --> 1:21:30.840]  I did a little intro like I normally do, and then I headed into the crowd here.
[1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:34.320]  As you can kind of see it behind me, I've been removed from the public park.
[1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:38.440]  I'm hoping to have a conversation with police about that, but I was able to go around for
[1:21:38.440 --> 1:21:44.960]  about, say about 10 minutes before they removed me from the park, and in that 10 minutes,
[1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:48.720]  I was able to have some conversations, but it was pretty much stereotypical people putting
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:55.040]  signs in front of me, screaming at me, shouting obscenities at me, but Beto has now arrived
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:58.840]  and they wanted to make sure I wasn't able to be in the park when Beto, Robert Francis,
[1:21:58.840 --> 1:22:04.000]  his real name, posing as a Hispanic because they love stealing glory.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  That's what they do.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:08.120]  They give you a victim economy, then they steal from you in it.
[1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:12.800]  So Robert Francis O'Rourke, who pretends to be Hispanic, has arrived, but it's amazing,
[1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:17.080]  Alex, when you try to have an intellectual or logical conversation with these people,
[1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:18.080]  they just fall apart.
[1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:19.080]  They just crumble.
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:21.040]  And I've realized what the thing is, Alex.
[1:22:21.040 --> 1:22:23.280]  This isn't really about abortion here.
[1:22:23.280 --> 1:22:26.520]  Most of these people are not going to have abortion and have never had an abortion.
[1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:32.440]  This is about protecting the false paradigm and worldview of the liberal left because
[1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:34.800]  they claim they have the moral high ground.
[1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:39.720]  That's where everything else derives from the left is that they have the moral compass.
[1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:44.640]  Therefore they should be allowed to govern with authority and with like a dictator.
[1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:49.240]  But if abortion is murder, they are self-appointed.
[1:22:49.240 --> 1:22:52.600]  But if abortion is murder, Alex, then they lose the moral high ground.
[1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:58.240]  They lose the moral compass and all of a sudden everything that encompasses the leftist paradigm
[1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:01.480]  starts to crumble when they don't have that moral authority anymore.
[1:23:01.480 --> 1:23:06.040]  So that's what this is really about, protecting their moral authority, propagandizing young
[1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:10.240]  women that they believe will vote Democrat in the future, and then keep the money train
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:11.240]  rolling.
[1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:12.240]  I mean, let's just be honest.
[1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:14.440]  Abortion is a $100 billion industry.
[1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:17.980]  Half of that money goes right back into the pockets of the Democrat Party.
[1:23:17.980 --> 1:23:20.320]  So they got to protect their money at the end of the day, too.
[1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:22.400]  Let's not forget about that.
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:26.440]  Democrats have had, what, 50 years to codify Roe vs. Wade?
[1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:27.960]  Why didn't they, Alex?
[1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:30.360]  Because they like having this divide and conquer.
[1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:32.720]  They like getting people fired up for abortion.
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:35.040]  They like using it during election years.
[1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:37.680]  It's another political tool of the Democrat Party.
[1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:40.440]  Now, the police have just arrived on scene, Alex.
[1:23:40.440 --> 1:23:42.840]  Would you like me to talk to them while I'm on air with you?
[1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:43.840]  Please do.
[1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:44.840]  All right.
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:46.520]  I'm going to approach the police here now.
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:48.080]  Again, where's your free space?
[1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:52.480]  They can berate naked children and naked adults, but when you're there, you're being told you're
[1:23:52.480 --> 1:23:53.480]  not allowed to be there.
[1:23:53.480 --> 1:23:54.480]  I'm not going to put my weight here.
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:55.480]  Yeah.
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:56.480]  Hi, gentlemen.
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:23:57.480]  The camera's shooting me right now just so you know you're not on film.
[1:23:57.480 --> 1:24:01.560]  Do I have the right to be at this park because I was doing nothing and they came and physically
[1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:02.560]  removed me?
[1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:06.240]  Even though they're permanent, the security can't remove us if we're just doing our job.
[1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:11.440]  Now, if he literally physically picks me up and removes me, can I file a charge?
[1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:13.080]  I'd like to file a charge, please.
[1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:15.400]  Actuals, they're in control, but they're going to...
[1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:16.400]  Okay.
[1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:18.960]  We're the active attack team, but we'll let you do all those things.
[1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:19.960]  Okay.
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:20.960]  Are they going to come here or should I go to them?
[1:24:20.960 --> 1:24:27.960]  If they want to call again, they probably told him they wanted to get away from the
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:28.960]  crash.
[1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:29.960]  Okay.
[1:24:29.960 --> 1:24:34.760]  So just like they censor online, they're trying to censor you, showing what they are.
[1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:37.200]  Do I have the guy's face?
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:38.200]  I don't know his name.
[1:24:38.200 --> 1:24:40.760]  Should I try to get that from another security guy or what do you think?
[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:46.640]  I mean, it's a good editorial candidate, just showing.
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:47.640]  He had a security shirt on.
[1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:51.320]  He said he was private security hired by, I guess, whoever organized this.
[1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:52.320]  They also work security.
[1:24:52.320 --> 1:24:53.320]  I work security.
[1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:54.320]  But yeah, I mean, we have it all on tape.
[1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:55.320]  He physically grabbed me.
[1:24:55.320 --> 1:24:56.320]  He tried to trip me.
[1:24:56.320 --> 1:24:58.920]  He shoved me and he told me I couldn't be here.
[1:24:58.920 --> 1:24:59.920]  And I did nothing illegal.
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:00.920]  Yeah.
[1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:03.520]  We'll let patrol know if you said you already called.
[1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:04.520]  Yes, sir.
[1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:05.800]  But so I can go into the park, right?
[1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:08.000]  I'm perfectly in my right to go into this park.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  They can't kick me out even if they have a permit.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  Right.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Correct.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  Okay.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  All right.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  So there you go.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  So, Alex.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  So we just...
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:20.080]  Yeah, but show the police or the media will say you made it up.
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:22.480]  You still got to show the cops to show them.
[1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:24.840]  They just told me I can go in.
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:27.000]  So they just told me I can go in.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  All right.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  Now, here's what I'll do.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  If you can...
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.080]  Alex, there's a guy out here who wants to say hi to you real quick.
[1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:34.080]  Hey, Alex.
[1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:35.080]  Big fan, brother.
[1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:36.080]  Hey.
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:37.080]  Love you, brother.
[1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:38.280]  So he says he loves you too.
[1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:40.240]  So here's...
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:42.120]  Is there any way you can give me that gentleman's name?
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:43.120]  If not, I understand.
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:44.120]  All right.
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:45.120]  All right.
[1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:46.120]  Well, so Alex, here's what I'm going to do.
[1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:48.140]  I'm going to go back in.
[1:25:48.140 --> 1:25:50.240]  The guy's probably going to come kick me out again.
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:51.640]  I'm going to ask for his name.
[1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:54.240]  He's probably not going to give it to me, but I'm going to give him one more chance, telling
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:58.800]  him I'm filed charges and see if he wants to cooperate after violating my first amendment
[1:25:58.800 --> 1:25:59.800]  rights.
[1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:00.800]  So we're going to see what happens here, Alex.
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:01.800]  All right?
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:02.800]  Let's go.
[1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:03.800]  Let's do it.
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:04.800]  I know.
[1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:05.800]  Hey, man, call...
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:07.600]  If you've got to call your guy, he can come kick me out.
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:09.320]  He can come violate my rights again.
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:10.320]  You saw the police.
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:11.320]  You heard what they said.
[1:26:11.320 --> 1:26:12.320]  All right, Alex.
[1:26:12.320 --> 1:26:18.480]  So the left of the giant part is trying to say that press can't be there in the Democrat
[1:26:18.480 --> 1:26:20.480]  death cult Beto O'Rourke group.
[1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:25.960]  And here goes Owen Schreuer, live to millions at infowars.com, reports live showing stations
[1:26:25.960 --> 1:26:28.120]  across the country.
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:29.480]  And we'll have to cut the audio.
[1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:32.440]  They all start screaming cuss words, which they do.
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:33.440]  But here we go.
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:35.720]  Owen is going back into the crowd.
[1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:37.480]  We'll see if they try to assault him again.
[1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:39.280]  They're telling him he can't be there.
[1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:41.560]  Because they're such free-loving Americans.
[1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:44.300]  They're such good people.
[1:26:44.300 --> 1:26:45.800]  You met God?
[1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:47.400]  What did God say about killing babies?
[1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:52.960]  There's no God, huh?
[1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:54.760]  There's no God?
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:56.000]  You being here.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  Life is the proof.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:00.640]  We are the most complicated organism on earth.
[1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:01.640]  We are the most...
[1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:02.640]  Oh, evolution.
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:04.640]  So who started the cycle?
[1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:05.640]  Who created the cycle?
[1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:14.560]  My body, my choice, Alex, except with vaccines.
[1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:16.360]  My body, my choice, except with vaccines.
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:17.360]  Am I right?
[1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:18.360]  Except with a mask.
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:20.240]  A lot of people got forced to take a vaccine.
[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:22.240]  A lot of people.
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:23.240]  A lot of people.
[1:27:23.240 --> 1:27:26.040]  And then they act like no one got forced to take a vaccine.
[1:27:26.040 --> 1:27:28.640]  It's so funny.
[1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:31.760]  Why do you guys support baby murder?
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:38.000]  Abortion should be a rare and barbaric event.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.360]  Oh, and just try to go up to the front.
[1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:42.160]  All right, Alex.
[1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:47.000]  The good news is, Alex, abortion will go down in American history with the likes of slavery
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.120]  as a barbaric act that we ended.
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:50.120]  Well, it's a barbaric act.
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:51.120]  As a barbaric act.
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:52.120]  It's human sacrifice.
[1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:53.120]  It is.
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:54.120]  It is.
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:55.120]  So they're shoving me now, Alex.
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:56.120]  Now I'm being assaulted, Alex.
[1:27:56.120 --> 1:27:57.120]  Now it begins, Alex.
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:27:58.120]  Here we go.
[1:27:58.120 --> 1:28:03.120]  And now they're cursing, Alex.
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:04.120]  Now they're cursing.
[1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:05.120]  All right.
[1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:06.120]  All right, buddy.
[1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:07.120]  All right.
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:08.120]  We've got to go to break.
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:10.120]  Hundreds of radio stations are about to rejoin us.
[1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:11.120]  We're going to break.
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:12.120]  We'll see what happens.
[1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:13.120]  I went after this.
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:17.760]  We'll have all the footage tonight when he comes back here very soon, 6 to 8 p.m. central.
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:18.760]  He'll get a little bit late.
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:19.760]  It's all closed.
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:20.760]  So he gets here.
[1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:23.360]  But that's all coming up.
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:31.600]  And I'm sorry that I wouldn't say choked for the first hour, but man, the stuff these
[1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:36.600]  people are doing is so evil that it boggles the mind.
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:43.400]  And you ask yourself, how have we fallen this far?
[1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:51.240]  How have we let ourselves become like this?
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:57.920]  Let's pray for Owen.
[1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:01.680]  Freeworldoutlet.com.

[1:30:02.400 --> 1:30:07.600]  a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[1:30:07.600 --> 1:30:08.600]  You see it every year.
[1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:13.800]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[1:30:13.800 --> 1:30:19.600]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:23.000]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  this and knowing this.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:29.680]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[1:30:29.680 --> 1:30:34.880]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your
[1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:35.880]  money.
[1:30:35.880 --> 1:30:40.600]  And that's why I'm here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.

[1:31:07.240 --> 1:31:11.920]  They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:14.240]  They're coming for your free speech.
[1:31:14.240 --> 1:31:16.040]  They're coming for your privacy.
[1:31:16.040 --> 1:31:21.040]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative
[1:31:21.040 --> 1:31:24.480]  and government that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[1:31:24.480 --> 1:31:30.200]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view, 2000 Mules,
[1:31:30.200 --> 1:31:35.560]  is now available on DVD with expanded extras at infowarsstore.com.
[1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:43.000]  You can also get the powerful film with other documentaries discounted at infowarsstore.com.

[1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:51.480]  They're planning to run the same scams again.
[1:31:51.480 --> 1:31:54.040]  This film can stop them if you take action.
[1:31:54.040 --> 1:31:57.760]  infowarsstore.com, 2000 Mules.
[1:31:57.760 --> 1:32:04.480]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all, and if we
[1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:08.520]  don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:14.280]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare, and that alone is something to
[1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:15.760]  be grateful for.
[1:32:15.760 --> 1:32:21.240]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of
[1:32:21.240 --> 1:32:27.000]  your taps getting shut off, and having your own food will save you from getting ensnared
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:29.240]  in government FEMA camps.
[1:32:29.240 --> 1:32:33.680]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider
[1:32:33.680 --> 1:32:36.480]  stocking up for your neighbors.
[1:32:36.480 --> 1:32:42.000]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:46.920]  having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[1:32:46.920 --> 1:32:51.760]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[1:32:51.760 --> 1:32:58.760]  Back up now at preparetoday.com.
[1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:28.760]  Welcome back to Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:32.760]  We have to take these breaks, this pre-program of the radio stations and TV stations.
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:36.400]  Oh, we'll have all the raw footage if he gets out of this bed to a roar.
[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:40.440]  Austin, Texas, Satanic rally they're having, but his feet got cut.
[1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:43.680]  They ought to knock the camera out of his hand, his camera guy.
[1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:48.400]  We're not sure we're trying to reconnect right now, but I want to show you a live clip from
[1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:54.400]  yesterday that we've had to edit and bleep out the cuss words of Savannah Hernandez and
[1:33:54.400 --> 1:33:58.960]  Drew Hernandez in DC outside the Supreme Court building, and they're just out there
[1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:02.600]  peacefully talking to people that aren't even saying they're with them for wars.
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:06.840]  And one person after another, they're about 100 yards away from the big line of protesters
[1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:09.520]  behind the police barricades.
[1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:12.960]  They come over and say, I love killing babies.
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:13.960]  I hate you.
[1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:14.960]  I'll beat you up.
[1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:19.120]  I'll beat you, and they hit their cameras, they shove them, they hit them, and the police
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:21.320]  just sit there and watch it happen.
[1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:22.320]  But that's who these bullies are.
[1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:28.440]  And I want to show this clip from yesterday when I did a live show for two hours, 11 a.m.
[1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:29.440]  to 1 p.m.
[1:34:29.440 --> 1:34:33.000]  Because they were out there, and because it wasn't already on TV stations, I could have
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:38.400]  a live feed where they could do all their cussing and screaming and howling and going
[1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:43.400]  crazy, and I could show you who these animals are, and it was an insane two hours.
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:46.000]  It's archived at Band-Aid video right now.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:50.640]  But here's a clip from yesterday, and then a clip from a few years ago of an abortion
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:54.400]  doctor sounding like the exact same demon.
[1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:59.440]  So here's the clip from yesterday with another clip of an abortion doctor back to back.
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:00.440]  Here it is.
[1:35:00.440 --> 1:35:01.440]  You will be arrested immediately.
[1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:02.440]  Hey, calm down.
[1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:03.440]  You take your hands off me.
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:04.440]  So the left always attacks free speech.
[1:35:04.440 --> 1:35:05.440]  Calm down.
[1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:06.440]  Calm down.
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:07.440]  Calm down.
[1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:08.440]  Calm down.
[1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:09.440]  Let's have a conversation.
[1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:10.440]  Calm down.
[1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:17.440]  Calm down.
[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:25.680]  I guess the pandemic's over.
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:26.680]  What's wrong, sir?
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:27.680]  You like killing babies?
[1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:28.680]  You love killing babies?
[1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:29.680]  Love killing babies.
[1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:30.680]  You love killing babies, huh?
[1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:31.680]  You love that, don't you?
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:32.680]  You love that.
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:41.000]  I pray, sir, you got to repent, sir, you got to repent, sir, for murdering babies.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  Why?
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:43.240]  Because it's a sin before God.
[1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:44.240]  Why?
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:45.240]  Stinky breath.
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:46.240]  Why?
[1:35:46.240 --> 1:35:47.760]  Yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty evil to you, sir.
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:48.760]  Yeah, I am.
[1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:53.400]  And I hope and pray that you, well, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:54.400]  I love it.
[1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:55.400]  You love it, huh?
[1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:56.400]  Yeah, I do.
[1:35:56.400 --> 1:35:57.400]  Okay.
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:35:58.400]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:35:59.400]  Oh, I'd ever go to Christ.
[1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:00.920]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:01.920]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:03.720]  I don't listen to Christ.
[1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:04.800]  You will have a darkened heart, sir.
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:06.280]  I do have a darkened heart.
[1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:07.280]  Yeah.
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:08.280]  You have a darkened heart.
[1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:09.280]  I do, I do very, very much so.
[1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:10.880]  And you will stand before God in judgment day?
[1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:11.880]  Yes, I will.
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:12.880]  Every day.
[1:36:12.880 --> 1:36:13.880]  You will stand before God in judgment day?
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:14.880]  Yes, I will.
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:15.880]  Every day.
[1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:16.880]  All the babies in that field.
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:17.880]  I love it.
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:18.880]  I love it.
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:19.880]  Yeah, keep tearing the babies apart.
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:20.880]  Yeah, I will.
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:21.880]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:22.880]  I will.
[1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:23.880]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[1:36:23.880 --> 1:36:24.880]  Oh, yes, I will.
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:28.120]  Yes, sir, the babies, their blood streams from the ground.
[1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:29.120]  Their blood streams.
[1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:30.120]  My friends, you are a murderer, sir.
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:31.120]  You are a murderer.
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:32.120]  Yes, sir.
[1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:33.100]  You are a murderer, sir.
[1:36:33.100 --> 1:36:34.200]  You are a murderer.
[1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:37.760]  I'm here in Austin just a few miles away from the Capitol.
[1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:41.840]  Owen Stroyer is in the midst of those people and they are assaulting them, they're already
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:43.640]  attacking them, try to throw them out, the police said no.
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:45.360]  You have a right to be there.
[1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:48.180]  The First Amendment is a press covering it.
[1:36:48.180 --> 1:36:49.920]  And we don't know how Owen's doing.
[1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:59.040]  He's supposed to be here in 24 minutes, hosting Sunday Live for to 6 p.m.
[1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:03.880]  show six to eight. He does Sunday live. He does weekdays three p.m. Central right after
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:08.760]  my broadcast 11 a.m. to three p.m. Central. That's right after of course American Journal
[1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:14.040]  eight a.m. Every morning with Harrison Smith at the embattled info wars dot com for its
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:21.840]  last show, you know, I was really torn genuinely in the first hour because normally I get
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:26.920]  ready by researching off and on during the day before a show and then I came in here
[1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:32.040]  and they said have you seen the transgender pride parades around the country and I said
[1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:43.840]  no they said we'll watch this and it's so horrible that we can't show it and this is
[1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:52.080]  what we'll do. I'm going to blur the genitals out and and all of that Owens back and and
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:56.440]  we'll get it done tomorrow it'll take a day there's so much of it and we'll air it Tuesday
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:00.280]  that's that's the way to do this is that's the way to do this, but it just loses the
[1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:06.760]  effect folks. Owen is ready. Owen they tried to throw you out earlier the police said they
[1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:11.880]  couldn't what just happened. I went in and again I got assaulted multiple times they
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:16.400]  spit on me they poured drinks on me they shoved me they hit me in the head. It's typical liberal
[1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:20.960]  loving tolerant behavior, but it's okay Alex because I'm okay with that I know these people
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:25.240]  are demonically possessed. I know they're mad their entire worldview is about to collapse.
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:30.480]  And so so I understand they're angry because they've been lied to they have a false worldview
[1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:33.600]  and their entire paradigm is collapsing right in front of them so they're throwing fits
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:39.000]  of rage. So I'm expecting that Alex but what's sad is that they don't recognize that abortion
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:44.760]  is going to go down in American history as a barbaric inhumane thing just like slavery
[1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:48.400]  and the fact that they're in here brainwashing young girls and boys into thinking that's
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:51.960]  not the case it's really sad. The good news is Alex hey all of a sudden they're for bodily
[1:38:51.960 --> 1:38:56.560]  autonomy all of a sudden they're for bodily autonomy but they wanted forced vaccines and
[1:38:56.560 --> 1:39:02.480]  I got women in there to say only women can get pregnant. I said hey it's 2022 lady men
[1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:07.440]  can get pregnant too you bigot. So the entire left wing ideology is falling apart Alex is
[1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:11.080]  a huge victory for America but I don't know why hey look if you're in a blue state you'll
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:14.120]  probably they'll probably let you kill your baby after it's born. These people are so
[1:39:14.120 --> 1:39:19.280]  demonically possessed so you know this is just typical the abortion win is not the
[1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:22.680]  win they think it is they're not going to have political victories on this because here's
[1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:26.320]  why Alex. People are going to forget about abortion in a month they're going to forget
[1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:29.680]  about guns they're going to forget about J6 and you know what they're going to remember
[1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:35.080]  a hundred dollars to fill up their tank their grocery bill going up 40 percent their energy
[1:39:35.080 --> 1:39:38.640]  bill going up 40 percent. So that's what's going to happen Alex they're not going to
[1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:41.920]  remember any of this they're going to remember what happened to them economically is what
[1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:46.600]  they're going to remember. I totally agree you know I see you host your show you do
[1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:52.840]  a great job you co-host mine sometimes and I see you really have trouble processing it.
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:59.640]  What about the paradox of pedophiles parading children with American Boy Scouts in Seattle
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:05.640]  other areas with naked men twerking and showing their genitals to three year olds with howling
[1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:12.200]  mothers loving at the giant open air sex party I mean and then we can't show it which I agree
[1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:16.760]  we shouldn't show it but the paradox is what do you do when you have this footage you know
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:20.640]  these crimes are being committed but then these George Soros jurisdictions that can get away
[1:40:20.640 --> 1:40:26.040]  with parading our captured children around. You know Alex there's a there's a prayer of
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:31.680]  mine called the serenity prayer and it's moments like this as to why I like it. God grant me
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:35.520]  the serenity to accept the things I cannot change the courage to change the things I
[1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:39.400]  can and the wisdom to know the difference. We need wisdom right now Alex I don't know
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:43.040]  how to deal with this I mean this is beyond our pay grade this is why we got to go to
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:47.840]  the big guy upstairs. It's so evil it's so demonic it confuses us we don't know how to
[1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:53.440]  handle it so we come out here we expose it you're not evil do you believe that abortion
[1:40:53.440 --> 1:41:01.360]  is a good thing well then why are we out here celebrating abortion oh we're celebrating
[1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:17.720]  yeah we are peace about them wanting to put vaccines in it. And that's less than one percent
[1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:22.400]  no it's not no it's not no it's not of the one million abortion. What about selling baby
[1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:32.920]  body parts. There's no point even talking to these people. Ask them about the facts
[1:41:32.920 --> 1:41:38.200]  they're trying to make us take experimental shots. Do you believe my body my choice what
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:42.640]  about with vaccines. Yes. Okay so I so you can't force a vaccine. Hey that's good that's
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:49.120]  good. Can men get pregnant. No. All right. Hey you have actually you have solid logic
[1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:52.760]  I appreciate that. Oh there it is. And then she flipped him off for me. There it is.
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:59.360]  Because she doesn't want to have any common ground. Yeah so there you go. Hey Owen you
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:02.440]  need to you need to you need to get you need to get in your car and get over here to host
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:07.400]  the show. Yeah you got it. Yeah get in the car and get down here because I'm not bitching
[1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:10.720]  I want to host the next few hours but I got to get a bunch of work done a bunch of accounting
[1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:14.520]  here. I'll be up here working till 10 o'clock tonight about bitching I just need you to get
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:19.080]  down here. Okay. Thank you very much. All right. Owen Schroyer is going to get in the
[1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:23.000]  car. He's going to get down here and host Sunday live coming up. He'll get a little
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  bit after the next hour starts. You can find the feed in fours.com forward slash show.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:36.760]  Great job Owen. Great job crew. And I look you folks give me a little break sometimes
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:43.120]  when I have trouble. I got all this news and I just I got I got a I got a I got to get
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:46.680]  a rain check on this man this is just I'm I'm I'm not going to lie I'm overwhelmed right
[1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:58.240]  now these people are crazy and the footage I got what they did I came in there. The Internet
[1:42:58.240 --> 1:43:03.760]  and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right. People ask what's it
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:08.920]  like to be vindicated. Well it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming
[1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:14.640]  I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important
[1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:20.840]  than ever because the globalist aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents. It's
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:27.040]  now out of the open. Claw Schwab said last week that they rule the earth. The Bilderberg
[1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:33.000]  group founded Davos group. So now the fight's out in the open. They're making their move
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:36.880]  because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing. God's watching
[1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:40.080]  all the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:44.720]  word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you info wars would
[1:43:44.720 --> 1:43:49.480]  not be here. So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you
[1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:53.800]  are the reason humanity has a fighting chance. So I want to thank you and salute you again
[1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:59.120]  for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts. So when I first started taking
[1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:04.280]  survival skills basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:09.040]  believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened
[1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:13.440]  to it. So the first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked pretty
[1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:17.080]  good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with X2. You had you know with a deep
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:21.360]  burden source you know and I got really excited about that. So I took it and man in two weeks
[1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:27.040]  I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened. You know I could
[1:44:27.040 --> 1:44:31.800]  think again I could connect with people again. And over the course of the next couple of
[1:44:31.800 --> 1:44:36.160]  years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:40.920]  all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knock out literally like
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:45.120]  if you want to sleep just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway so the point is we have
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:49.200]  to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system and the only way
[1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:52.400]  to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[1:44:52.400 --> 1:45:03.480]  Beautifully said brother. I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed. I want to say brain
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:07.640]  force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is. But if you took it with
[1:45:07.640 --> 1:45:13.240]  fish oil it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it. And that's an
[1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:18.920]  example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy. Brain. Body. Heart. The
[1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:23.240]  cleanest. The best out there. Crill oil is the best. And it'll give you the damn burps.
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:26.960]  And I'm sorry. You want something like this. You don't get stuff for free. The krill is
[1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:30.600]  hallucinogenic. It's so good. In my view. I'm not a medical statement here. But let
[1:45:30.600 --> 1:45:34.580]  me tell you something. I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing
[1:45:34.580 --> 1:45:45.840]  Santa Claus that night. So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is. So we don't
[1:45:45.840 --> 1:45:49.080]  make a big profit off of it. But you know what I'm just obsessed with. Whatever the best
[1:45:49.080 --> 1:45:58.480]  is we've got. I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it. Info wars store. Cognitive dissonance
[1:45:58.480 --> 1:46:04.360]  is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:09.920]  to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition. Buy
[1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:15.600]  them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store dot com. Studies have suggested
[1:46:15.600 --> 1:46:20.880]  that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:26.440]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:32.920]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:40.040]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[1:46:40.040 --> 1:46:46.200]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and
[1:46:46.200 --> 1:46:52.560]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:58.560]  a friend, family member or yourself at info wars store dot com.
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:05.560]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:35.560]  So even Fox News has the headline cryptic comments. Second pandemic. Biden alarms Twitter
[1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:50.760]  with his cryptic comments. Here we go again. So a week ago he said, Hey, there will be
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:55.120]  another pandemic soon. There's going to be new lockdown soon. That's their power grab.
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:48:02.120]  And now Biden is gallivanting around giving the exact same statements again. Here it is.
[1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:09.840]  We need more money to plan for the second pandemic. There's going to be another pandemic.
[1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:14.560]  We have to think ahead. And that's not something the last outfit did very well. That's something
[1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:19.760]  we've been doing for fairly well. That's why we need the money.
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:23.880]  And that's the old clip. I'm sorry. I wasn't really clear with the crew. Let me let me
[1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:27.760]  give you the new place it's at. Okay. Here it is. Fox News. You can find the video right
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:33.760]  there. Second pandemic. Biden alarms Twitter with his cryptic comments. Here we go again.
[1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:40.680]  And it goes through all of that. So, so that's where they're going with this. And they are
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:46.320]  definitely preparing the general public for it. There's an excellent report. Prison,
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:51.280]  planet, lockdowns will resume. And we're going to air that special report while Owen gets
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:55.920]  back to the studio. He's like 10 minutes away at the start of the next hour. That's the
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:49:02.240]  first report that we are going to be airing here today. Okay. You know, I kind of spun
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:07.640]  my tires today. It was still an important broadcast. Got a lot done. And I didn't get
[1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:13.360]  to this cloning world government stack that I've been talking about for days because it's
[1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:19.400]  just so important. I just choke. I mean, it's just like it's insane. We've also got a lot
[1:49:19.400 --> 1:49:27.200]  of new Jeffrey Epstein news coming out. We've got a lot of government controlled sex trafficking
[1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:35.560]  by Biden going on. And then we've got this stack. And I can't show you most of it because
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:45.440]  it's illegal. And a bunch of fat, disgusting men naked with little children in public engaged
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:58.320]  in sexual gyrations is pedophilia. And again, I've reached a paradoxical point of how do
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:03.200]  I show you something like this and expose what they're doing without being part of what
[1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:06.320]  they're doing. So I'm going to have to think about it tonight. I'm going to have to figure
[1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:14.560]  it out. You know, here's the goodness. These people aren't going to ever stop. That's the
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:19.600]  bad news too, isn't it? And so we're going to be forced to deal with them. We're going
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:26.600]  to be forced to decide at what level are we going to start saying no to these people who
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:32.720]  I told you 25 years ago, their operating system is the destruction of innocence. Their operating
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:40.600]  system is pedophilia. And I would talk about that 25 years ago. I remember being on local
[1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:44.800]  radio and having the number one show at night. And the program director would come down to
[1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:50.400]  the office and they'd say, we're getting calls from other stations and stuff. Was that a
[1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:55.840]  that's not a real FBI agent, former FBI agent you had on? That's a that's person's fake,
[1:50:55.840 --> 1:51:00.400]  right? Saying this. I go, here's Ted Gunterson's phone number call. Of course, Ted Gunterson
[1:51:00.400 --> 1:51:08.840]  was 100% real. And so much of it's been released and declassified since then. But I get why
[1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:16.520]  people 25 26 years ago, when I was laying this out would listen and go, there's no way
[1:51:16.520 --> 1:51:23.280]  this is real. And Ted Gunterson was giving real cases of real things that were going
[1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:28.960]  on. But you don't need to hear from Ted Gunterson. You can turn on your television. You can go
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:36.560]  down a local parade and you can see a bunch of fat men with their penises hanging out
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:45.520]  with children with hula hoops dancing around with them. And that's the mild stuff. Ladies
[1:51:45.520 --> 1:51:53.600]  and gentlemen, naked bicyclists circle the route in front of large crowd of children
[1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:58.040]  with the mother's cheering. Now look at this from years ago, I said was the plan to take
[1:51:58.040 --> 1:52:04.160]  over the Boy Scouts Boy Scouts provide condoms in upcoming jamboree as children as young
[1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:12.880]  as eight. You send your children to Boy Scouts now it's to become ground meat for the pedophiles.
[1:52:12.880 --> 1:52:19.320]  And what was at this local parade in Seattle, scouting color guard and supporters in Seattle
[1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:28.480]  pride parade. The captured children gay pride is about family in Seattle with all the naked
[1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:34.440]  men running around. In the shock video out of Dallas, 17 year old girl escaped sex-traving
[1:52:34.440 --> 1:52:42.960]  ever been kidnapped two years ago, who held her captive for over a year. It's all interrelated.
[1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:51.600]  Jeffrey Epstein, every single benefit is part of the same dehumanizing program where they
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:59.240]  can normalize the state and these different cults targeting your children, hoping that
[1:52:59.240 --> 1:53:04.520]  everyone then just gives up and says it's too able to face. We're just going to give
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:10.320]  into it. But the answer is a mass exodus out of the colleges out of the public schools
[1:53:10.320 --> 1:53:15.400]  out of corporate America. And that's happening. And as the left loses and they are beginning
[1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:23.240]  to lose, they panic even more and say, double down, move the Overton window, become even
[1:53:23.240 --> 1:53:28.880]  more radical. So it's naked men and convicted pedophiles having access to your children
[1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:33.840]  at school. That's what they're doing now. It won't look so bad when we teach your five
[1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:40.640]  year old son, he's really a girl. So they're trying to radicalize and do things so extreme
[1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:45.960]  that no one can stand against them. And here's some of those headlines night of rage, dozens
[1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:51.400]  arrested as pro-abortion mobs violently siege medical centers, assault police, storm AZ
[1:53:51.400 --> 1:54:00.560]  Capitol. All the Democrats have hearings about people wandering into a Capitol. Waved in
[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:06.920]  by the police. Democrats cling to abortion rights as a chance to clawback votes. State
[1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:12.680]  see Abrams calls for no limits on abortion, including up to the moment of birth. And this
[1:54:12.680 --> 1:54:20.720]  photo says it all a real photo. So woman probably weighs 500 pounds, says I'm on strike. No
[1:54:20.720 --> 1:54:31.880]  choice for me. No sex for you. And the Twitter commenter, Alex Burowitz says your terms are
[1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:38.000]  acceptable. There's another real photo and I'm not making fun of fat people. I'm a little
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:43.360]  overweight myself. But man, you go to the Antifa groups. It's another 400 pound woman
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:55.560]  in her commando outfit prepared to wage war. What a joke. Ladies and gentlemen, but she
[1:54:55.560 --> 1:55:02.760]  has the backing of the establishment and she has our acquiescence and the fact that we're
[1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:07.640]  bullied by their intimidation of what they might say or what they might do to us. You
[1:55:07.640 --> 1:55:14.360]  should be much more worried about them running your society and your civilization and the
[1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:21.080]  fact that capitulating, the fact that bowing down, the fact that groveling, the fact that
[1:55:21.080 --> 1:55:29.160]  appeasement has only made the mob of idiots and fools and perverts and weirdos and scumbags
[1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:39.520]  and control freaks and criminals and societal arsonist become that much more emboldened.
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:43.240]  You have my commitment. Every time I get hit by stuff that really freaks me out, I come
[1:55:43.240 --> 1:55:49.200]  back stronger a day later. I will assure you unless God interferes, which I don't think
[1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:57.720]  God will. God intervenes is the word. God's in full control. Unless God intervenes, I
[1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:05.000]  will be back at 11 a.m. tomorrow flame throwing powerful, exposing all this and hitting the
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:10.400]  other news items. I didn't get to still a powerful Sunday broadcast, but just a little
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:16.080]  bit of me off my equilibrium because I want to show you them cutting themselves and them
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:21.240]  eating poop and them peeing on each other in front of children, but we just can't show
[1:56:21.240 --> 1:56:27.560]  that on air. I'm going to blur it out. I'm going to put it together and I'm going to
[1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:32.120]  put it out on air. And that's what they want us off air because they know nobody in the
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:35.920]  media is going to cover this. They're going to promote it out. It's wholesome and good
[1:56:35.920 --> 1:56:41.080]  and fun. Remember Tim Allen got a show canceled. You know, it was a hit show because he went
[1:56:41.080 --> 1:56:45.600]  on national TV and said, you know, I'm not against gay people, but gay parades aren't
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:49.320]  a family thing. If you've been to one, I ain't been to one folks, but I've seen the footage
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:56.560]  and that ain't quote gay. That's satanic. That's disgusting people having sex in the
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:57:01.440]  street, cutting themselves, eating poop, pissing on each other. And I don't want to talk about
[1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:05.760]  stuff like this on air. I got better things, beautiful things to talk about, but this is
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:10.880]  who wants access to our children because they know we reject them, but they believe if they
[1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:17.200]  can get our children early, they can do anything they want to them. All right, couple of special
[1:57:17.200 --> 1:57:23.440]  reports and the great Owen shroyer battle hardened back from hell at the Beto Rourke
[1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:34.000]  pedophile satanic. Comflab, Conflab, Conflab, Conflab is a word event, great meeting that

[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:48.240]  Live shows Sunday Live coming up right now in FullWars.com, port slash show. There's
[1:57:48.240 --> 1:57:53.600]  an old Beto one saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this. Trust in
[1:57:53.600 --> 1:57:59.360]  God with tie up your camel. Hunter S. Thompson put it this way, pray to God, but roll away
[1:57:59.360 --> 1:58:03.760]  from the rocks. If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get
[1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:07.440]  smashed on him and killed, but also try to roll away. You can't just sit there like
[1:58:07.440 --> 1:58:12.680]  a jellyfish and it's the same thing with our immune system. God helps those who help themselves.

[1:58:46.600 --> 1:58:55.000]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas,
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:58:59.200]  Mexico, the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's
[1:58:59.200 --> 1:59:04.760]  wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah,
[1:59:04.760 --> 1:59:07.920]  we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really
[1:59:07.920 --> 1:59:11.680]  they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got
[1:59:11.680 --> 1:59:14.840]  it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this
[1:59:14.840 --> 1:59:18.120]  from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never
[1:59:18.120 --> 1:59:22.160]  gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per
[1:59:22.160 --> 1:59:25.480]  pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's
[1:59:25.480 --> 1:59:30.840]  Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally. In fact, I'm going to tell
[1:59:30.840 --> 1:59:37.720]  you a little story. We had like that. Okay, if you want to believe it. Anyway, so it's
[1:59:37.720 --> 1:59:42.520]  infowarsstore.com and that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't fund us and don't
[1:59:42.520 --> 1:59:57.560]  want us here, that's fine. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
