[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.740]  Larry, thanks for joining us via ISDN, via stereo line, it's like you're in studio, there's
[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.120]  a lot going on, can you give us the scanning on what's happening?
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:25.220]  Well the most recent development, you've already mentioned I think, is the Bush gun ban, he
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.620]  wants to team up with Dianne Feinstein, and when we learned about that, our mouths dropped
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.960]  open.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.220]  What in the world would be the political advantage, let's forget the Constitution because we know
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.300]  what regard that's got here in town, but to suggest that the thing that put him in the
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.660]  White House is now an issue that he wants to flip over on the other side on.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.380]  It was the perception, correct, that Al Gore wanted to grab your guns that made the yellow
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.100]  dog state of West Virginia go Republican.
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.140]  And it sounds like the thing that did his daddy's political career in, saying vote for
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.940]  me I'll cut your taxes and then raising them, it's that same lying instinct.
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.340]  Well it's very perplexing because both of them I guess got a little heady when they
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.740]  had a successful war going on, ratings are high, and Bush won, told Republicans when
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.100]  he wanted them to vote for the tax increase, just blame it on me.
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.260]  Well they did, and he took it right in the head politically, and if Bush thinks that
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.580]  his popularity will endure assault on guns the same as a, you know if he wants to team
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.260]  up with Charlie Schumer and Dianne Feinstein, not to mention Hillary Clinton, I don't think
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.180]  he's going to like the outcome.
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.380]  Now Barbara Boxer is more conservative than Bush in reality on the gun issue, she said
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.460]  arm all pilots, that showed Bush up, he didn't want to arm any of them, so he said okay jump
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.620]  through 100 flaming hoops, you might be able to have a gun, and my Democrat bureaucrat
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.460]  Tommy Thompson says you can, so this is the reality and now I talked to you a few weeks
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.180]  ago and you said you had your lawyers, your constitutional scholars there in D.C. looking
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.420]  at the Patriot Act, I read the analysis last night, it's worse than my analysis, it's on
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.420]  Infowars.com, we now have your analysis posted, a hyperlink directly to it on Infowars.com
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.980]  or you can go to gunowners.org.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.780]  Well the advantage we had is that the particular individual that ended up doing this had worked
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.020]  in the Senate for perhaps a quarter of a century and he now does consulting and we're fortunate
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.780]  to have him, he was able to look at the different areas of the code and there's I don't know
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.620]  three or four different sections of the federal code that are amended by this act or added
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.020]  onto and so you had to go back and look at the original language to understand what was
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.740]  being said, if all you had was the bill itself in front of you, you really didn't have enough,
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.180]  My analysis is six pages long and I give the subsection where they say you don't have to
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.060]  commit a crime, we'll secretly arrest you, you'll never be seen again, secret executions,
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.340]  basically gun owners are going to be terrorists, you guys have written an analysis that says the
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.300]  same thing, in fact even worse, can be secretly arrested, never seen again, on page six it says
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.780]  here's the bottom line, at its lowest common denominator, a native-born American could be
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.980]  stripped of his citizenship and permanently and clandestinely detained in a secret location
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.300]  without charges and without an attorney if he and then it also says later you can be secretly
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:55.980]  executed, that's what it says in the bill and in here it says basically engage in terrorist activity
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.580]  in the use of a firearm with the intent to endanger directly or indirectly the safety
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.180]  or one or more individuals or cause substantial damage to property, so and that's just one section
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.700]  you found, there are dozens where it says any action that endangers human life, that gets your
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.340]  life in prison, any action that aids terrorists unknowingly gets you secretly in prison forever
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.980]  executed, I mean this thing is worse than what Stalin put on paper Larry, and even if they were
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.780]  nice to you and let you out after a couple of days because you had been suspected of being a
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.340]  terrorist, they would have taken a DNA sample and added it into the national database that
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.820]  they're building, oh and then they say oh well we're not really trying to pass this, USA Today
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.300]  last Wednesday Bush wants DNA database for all, not just criminals or those that have misdemeanors
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.220]  but anyone who's ever arrested including a traffic stop, they want to slurp your blood and now I have
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.180]  the articles from Oklahoma, from Arizona, from Colorado where they say they're going to have
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.140]  roadside checkpoints taking our blood, does that sound like a free country Larry? I think what we
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.580]  need is take the DNA of all politicians and leave the rest of us alone, they've got it backwards,
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.700]  the people are not supposed to be transparent, the government is and there's not supposed to
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.700]  be that much government so you don't have that much to look through anyway. Well it's a giant
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.580]  analysis of the Patriot Act, key points, second amendment points, key areas that Larry Pratt's
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.220]  constitutional scholar found. It was a very impressive job, this guy not only is good at
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.940]  analyzing bills, he's good at writing them and he knows the rules of the senate I think better than
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.300]  any senator, several years ago there was a filibuster going on that the Republicans were
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.740]  leading when there was still some willingness to try to throw roadblocks up and Bird, Bobby Bird
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.940]  was the majority leader at that time and when he came into the chamber and saw the snarl that
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.860]  everything was in he said I'll bet it's that blankety blank then he named the guy that did
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:06.540]  that and he's the only blankety blank that can get us out of this mess too so we had a very keen
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:13.580]  eye looking at this and we're very certain that that which he has produced is right on
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.340]  and he doesn't miss much and one of the things that he's good about is he doesn't give them the
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:26.220]  benefit of the doubt if there's any ambiguity in the language he has learned over the years
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.300]  that that ambiguity will always be exploited by the guys that have the most guns. Well let me give
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.820]  you an example, you know I read the first Patriot Act and frankly I was one of the first people like
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.500]  two days after it finally was made public as Ron Paul said they weren't allowed to read it
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.500]  they were told at midnight pass this the Democrats Republicans in the House have taken
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.220]  bad stuff out the Democrats teamed up with Bush Schumer had the really bad stuff put back in again
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.220]  these two were probably vacationing together literally and it passed and then I went in and
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.100]  looked at the section and on the sunset section it said there is no sunset and it listed the key
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:09.180]  police state provisions like 213 and others and and and you know I made that point and now I look
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:15.020]  at the first Patriot Act section 802 says if you try to influence politicians that's terrorism
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.940]  well that's that's gunners of America that's Alex Jones of course uh you know that's the ACLU that's
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:26.620]  anybody uh then it says or any action that endangers human life is a violation of any
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.220]  federal or state law well the new Patriot Act says in a subsection we have this in my analysis
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.740]  says it doesn't matter uh section 802 isn't strong enough we want everything to be terrorism
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.780]  we want to be able to grab you for no reason and if a cop tells the news where we took you
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:50.060]  he gets life in a FEMA camp so this is insane Larry as you know this is the very definition of
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:56.380]  of tyranny what are we going to do about it we might point out that there's not a whole lot
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.140]  of difference between the provisions of this act and the way Saddam Hussein was running
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.340]  his little tyranny or for that matter of the tyrannies of the last century
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:12.220]  uh this is the provision for a secret police when the police do things in secret that is
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:18.940]  by definition secret police and I think we help ourselves to a certain extent by calling things
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:29.900]  what they are uh this is a and by the way there may well be some kind of a uh sunset in that
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:36.220]  first Patriot Act still because Orrin Hatch wants to take it out he's got a bill in his committee
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:44.220]  that would do that so and that's a conservative Republican trying to do that these guys are
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:49.260]  giving us a lot of challenge and I'm just delighted that the members of Gun Owners of America are not
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.740]  bedazzled by the popularity of the president at the moment I think most of our members
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.900]  tend to support the president on the war but it didn't stop them from immediately responding with
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:07.660]  real vigor to tell him that well I mean Larry let's be honest they're using that goodwill
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:14.060]  in the election they're going to say who you're going to vote for Gore or Skull and Bones Kerry
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:20.460]  or you're going to vote for me ha ha ha and I say let the Democrats in because that will energize
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:26.460]  the conservative base in reality and oppose the UN takeover oppose this whole new world order
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.540]  I think if we put George Bush back in office he's going to do what his daddy did he's going
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.900]  to gun grab he's going to raise taxes he's going to do all this I'm tired of it I'm tired of neocons
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.940]  you know Larry on these big national talk shows the big establishment ones they won't they will
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:48.140]  tell you you're a liar if you say Bush is supporting uh Clinton's gun ban I mean it's
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.020]  it's almost like reality isn't allowed or something and I for one I'm sick and tired
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:58.700]  of it I mean they want to secretly arrest me and they say for crime not even terrorism now
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.580]  and I disappear forever and by the way they want my guns I mean that gets my blood boiling Larry
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:10.380]  it um it's so much of a police state provision this unbelievable and to his credit by the way
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:17.340]  Bob Barr who did vote for it uh now is repenting and says that it's a terrible piece of legislation
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.860]  he's obviously had this is patriot one he's obviously had a chance to read it um but you know
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:28.700]  part of the problem and where I might disagree with you is that the you talk about the conservatives
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:34.300]  being energized I didn't really see enough of that under Clinton to make me confident that
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:40.700]  that would happen if there were a democrat and the republicans were so supine during that time
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:47.740]  that they were letting judges go through uh they were voting for education well Larry you're up
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:53.820]  there in DC okay Bush is for open borders Senator Bob Smith they targeted him because he was a real
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:00.140]  conservative got him removed put the neocon Sununu in they publicly said they're targeting Tom Tancredo
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.140]  because he's pro-America they're putting hit pieces in the media on him Bush said you're not
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.980]  going to be reelected uh because he's for sovereignty uh Bush has signed on to UNESCO
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.700]  uh Bush is blocking Dan Burton's committee of investigation of Harding gate he signed
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:20.460]  campaign finance reform where that was implemented I couldn't have you on 60 days before an election
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:26.380]  you know I think we forget here I don't know I mean I mean I it's I think we got Chucky Schumer
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.620]  in the White House I mean past the rhetoric uh I don't know what we're supposed to do I mean this
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.500]  was a nightmare well at least politically I don't think they're going to be able to budge Tom
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:41.740]  Tancredo nor get him out of office I the problem that Bob Smith had and it was that he had left
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:47.660]  the Republican party and said some strong truths about them and then had come back in
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:55.900]  now others have done that successfully but the first test is your first re-election Ron Paul
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:01.340]  actually had run for president as a libertarian and then had come back in and gotten elected and
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:08.220]  the party threw everything at him but the kitchen sink but he has his own funding sources he didn't
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:14.540]  have to depend on the Republican party largesse and so he was able to withstand it in Tancredo's
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:21.100]  case he's been re-elected since taking his position 68 yeah yeah so I I think you know
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.940]  that if they want to fire at him fine they're just going to waste their ammo and it'd probably
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:31.180]  be a good idea if they got Bush taking millions from known terror sponsors that's been all over
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:37.260]  the news and then and then McKinney takes a few thousand they go oh look or Tancredo does oh look
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.660]  he's evil when there's no way to know even where these donations are coming from sure and they can
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.660]  call any group whatever they want I mean you know some group could send you a donation you wouldn't
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.820]  know and then you know it's an affiliation with another group so I see these dirty tricks against
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:55.820]  real conservatives it makes me want to puke and I'm sick of it Larry well I think it's getting
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:03.740]  harder for them to carry out these campaigns now admittedly McKinney went down she was targeted
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.260]  yeah she's not a conservative but my point is it's that same dirty trick I was just using the
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.700]  example but if if and when they try that on a conservative we now have assets that we didn't
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:19.420]  have 10 years ago and we're able to communicate directly with the American people and you're
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.380]  certainly an excellent so you mean real conservative real constitutional internet sites
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:30.860]  and alternative conservative radio shows that aren't the ultra-liberal neo-cons exactly and
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.500]  I mean this afternoon unless they change the schedule I'm supposed to be on MSNBC
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:41.340]  Pat Buchanan that may have a new hour so I'm going to have a shot at talking about these
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:46.460]  frivolous lawsuits that are being brought against gun companies and you know I get to go out on live
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:52.540]  television so now if they win one of those Larry one of these suits were cooked and we're cooked
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.620]  even if we don't stop them because these things are absolutely draining these companies financially
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:04.700]  and that is the head of the NAACP said the other day when he filed his suit up in Brooklyn
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:10.380]  we're aiming to break the back of the gun industry yeah in Cuomo said we're going to
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.500]  kill a death by a thousand cuts Clinton said we're going to eat it like an elephant one
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:20.300]  by the time I mean this is racketeering this is criminal subversion we'll be right back
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.660]  well I really do appreciate Larry Perrette executive directors of gun owners in America
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.540]  joining us the website gunowners.org I appreciate gun owners because they'll
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.420]  they'll put out an alert and tell you what the gun bills are the NRA won't really do
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:47.260]  that on most gun bills and just lets them pass and I guess supports s22 that'll register all
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:52.220]  gun owners and Larry told us a few weeks ago he was on that it actually has a total information
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:58.380]  awareness network clause to spy on gun owners so it was worse than I had first thought and I guess
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:04.060]  I just want to punish the neo-con republicans I want because they're they're they're worse than
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:09.820]  democrats they get more through than democrats and conservatives go to sleep and allow it but Larry
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.620]  you're saying that you've seen the real conservatives the constitutionalists get
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:22.060]  really angry about Bush's latest gun grab trying to reinstate the Clinton gun bill what we had more
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:32.780]  response to this alert by far than anything else we've ever done before ever people were just I
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:38.140]  think they were insulted not to mention anything else that might have been going through their
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:45.820]  what in the world you know and we didn't put it quite so tough but some some of the folks have
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:51.820]  gotten back to us and showed they not only sent our letter but they sent one of their own and it
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:56.300]  started it starts off saying so why don't you want to get reelected Mr. President
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:04.620]  unbelievable well I mean look he's being hailed by Chuckie Schumer and Barbara Boxer and
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:13.980]  Feinstein and the million mommy bureaucrats I mean it's disgusting it it is the most amazing
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:20.540]  thing it doesn't really have any rational explanation that I can tell it doesn't do
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.380]  is order agenda Larry and you've written about that and you know you know what's going on
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:30.140]  you know frankly that's all it can help it it doesn't help republicans it doesn't help
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:35.740]  conservatives it completely neutralizes to the extent that he succeeds with this
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.940]  one of the more effective issues the party had to differentiate itself
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:46.620]  from the democrats 87 percent of those that were pro-gun won in the 98 elections and even higher
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.900]  than that in the 2000 that I'm sorry that what was the beginning years there was eight I saw
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:57.420]  statistics of 87 that were pro-gun won in 98 midterm and in 2000 it was even higher than that
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:04.700]  oh absolutely it's a winning issue it turned about 60 seats in 94 Clinton was willing to
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:11.740]  admit 20 but of course we never really trust him for anything anyway and we know it turned the
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.540]  presidential election now that's a whole lot of power he wouldn't even be in office if it weren't
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:23.420]  for this issue and to go and embrace the opposition to it it it is absolutely it tells you where his
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:29.340]  head is and I'll tell you the thing that struck me was he's really thinking like the folks inside
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:36.860]  the beltway do this whole homeland security idea the idea that we want to ban homeland security
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:44.620]  rifles which is what we're really talking about this is a a response of a bureaucrat Larry Larry
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.460]  Larry let's put it all together they got legislation to secretly arrest us for no
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.700]  reason even says you don't have to commit a crime or be a terrorist secretly take you away for your
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.780]  life and put you away no one knows where you're at and they want our guns with it I mean that's
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:02.780]  that sounds that's exactly what Saddam did in fact he had I guess more lenient gun laws that's
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:08.780]  exactly what Hitler and Stalin did so this is bad this is scary and even time enough to stay with us
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:13.980]  in the the next hour part of the next hour the toll free number to talk to Larry Pratt here on
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:23.100]  the Alex Jones show is 1-800-259-9231 if you have any questions about their incredible analysis of
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:31.100]  Patriot Act 2 or the Republican gun grabbing where the Democrats is going on 1-800-259-9231
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.220]  Larry what are some of the other things you want to talk about in the next 30 minutes
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:40.700]  well I think we I'd like to continue along with this homeland security idea and show the mindset
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:47.820]  what it's really it's anti-individual citizen anti-individual responsibility
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.260]  absolutely it's national ID card thumb scanner by itself Pentagon watching you
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:19:01.180]  uh it's it's a running man matrix brave new world 1984 Orwellian nightmare
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:07.340]  uh second hour I'm angry you should be angry we got Larry Pratt on with us stay with us at
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.540]  beautifulwars.com
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:22.940]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:31.900]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:38.140]  all right my friends we've got some news on the economy coming up in about 30 minutes
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:44.220]  I'll show what's happening in Iraq the attack on Syria and Rumsfeld's documents where he says they
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:51.340]  want to attack North Korea next October we'll be discussing that later in the hour and coming up
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.140]  the next segment we'll be taking your calls what did you think when you heard that Bush wants to
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:01.020]  reinstate the assault weapons ban and all the stuff that that entails and that he supports all
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:06.140]  these other bills that are going after our guns I'm asking the listeners that what did you think
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.860]  when I told you six months ago I told you a year ago he's going to do this in 94 when the
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:17.900]  reauthorization comes up what how did that affect you out there and and and did that make you angry
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:26.300]  one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:33.420]  with Larry Pratt in the next segment Larry uh how are things going with I know the house passed the
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:41.100]  bill to lock lawsuits against gun makers wonderful where is that going will lord bush sign it that's
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:46.940]  one measure that we do think he will sign he signed something similar as governor in Texas
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:53.180]  his position has been supportive of it it's been in committee in the senate
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:03.180]  the the um antis will try to mount a filibuster but I think that can be overcome because I think
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:09.820]  there are enough senators who even if they're not pro-gun they're anti-lawyer and this bill
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:16.220]  has a lot of tort reform flavor to it because after they do this I think they ought to come
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:22.380]  back for more and put a cap on what some of these sharks can guard well we've already discussed
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.540]  that it's collusion it's racketeering and when you've got Cuomo you've got all these other
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.460]  leaders saying we're going to get the gun manufacturers we're going to ban your guns
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:35.100]  by shutting down the manufacturers death by a thousand cuts eat the elephant one bite at a time
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.380]  that is the definition of racketeering you're saying they're going to shut a business or
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.700]  group of businesses down by discriminating and attacking them with frivolous lawsuits
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:49.020]  uh I mean it's obvious they better give them liability protection or they're now going to
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:54.060]  sue the hamburger makers they're going to sue ford when a drunk runs over somebody in the street
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:59.500]  or the greens may well decide that they want to target a particular industry and they're mean
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.580]  enough to do the same kind of thing that the anti-self-defense folks have been doing well
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:09.980]  my gun I mean if I want to go buy a 400 40-cal pistol now the thing's 700 bucks when it was 400
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:16.060]  just a couple years ago so we're already seeing the cost of these lawsuits oh you bet we are and
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:22.140]  uh the other cost is going to be when you can't find a gun anywhere because a lawsuit in one
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:29.260]  state resulted in the changing of a policy system-wide eventually these companies are either
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:35.260]  going to go out of business or they're going to start capitulating and either way we lose and
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:41.580]  sir brady wins and by capitulate uh when smith and wesson was owned by the redcoats they tried
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.500]  to make people sign an agreement to waive their rights just to carry their guns they were going
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.820]  to be a shill for the gun grabbers but luckily we found out and defused that and look where
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:55.180]  smith and wesson is that's right now they're slightly on the mend but frankly i'm not that
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:23:01.100]  happy with them because they now are owned by a company that makes trigger locks and i really
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:07.420]  don't think i know when i would ever want to use a trigger lock if i don't want to use the
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:12.300]  gun for self-defense i'm going to put it in the safe this is training us to accept biometrics larry
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:17.180]  well i think that's uh definitely where they would like to go with this and and one of the
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:23.660]  things that uh so upset us about a gun with a chip in it say that it was an electronic device
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.820]  is that that can be scrambled and then your gun is simply a three pound paperweight
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.100]  well uh new jersey passed that smart gun technology it was on the governor's desk in
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.580]  new mexico it's california's probably going to pass it and then that'll set the precedent where
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.900]  manufacturers will have to make these and then it's easy for them to pass it across the board
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:47.100]  we're very close losing our guns we'll talk about the globalist strategy to disarmage our strategy
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:53.500]  to defeat them and uh we're talking to the head of the real no compromise gun group not the trojan
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:59.180]  horse gun grabber group we're talking to gun owners of america donors.org i'm alex jones
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:04.300]  info wars.com is my website we'll get to your calls after this break how do we get our second
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:15.500]  amendment back 1-800-259-9231 stay with me he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:21.500]  radio network all right we're talking to larry pratt we got a bunch of callers that want to
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.820]  talk to him but larry wanted to get into homeland security and this police state mentality
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.660]  and some of the other key areas where they're talking our second amendment give us that key
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:38.060]  analysis from your expert position there in the district of criminals in dc and then we'll go to
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:44.380]  these calls larry okay well let me be real brief i just wanted to make a contrast the response to
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:49.980]  an attack on the united states during world war ii and it wasn't just pearl harbor there were
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:55.100]  japanese and german submarines that were harassing both coasts the japanese were
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:00.780]  trying to start forest fires with unmanned dirgibles loaded with fuel and the governors
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:06.780]  responded not by calling washington and asking for help there they figured washington was out
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:13.100]  doing what it had to do abroad they called on the militia and they had the militia patrol the
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.740]  shorelines and they actually uh the civil air patrol was part of that militia movement uh
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:24.140]  looking at the coast flying out a little bit into the ocean and actually didn't have a gun
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:30.140]  they'd hand you one oh absolutely and today it's oh we need your guns we've got to have
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:35.180]  armed police uh searching you we're going to leave the border wide open it's obvious they're
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:40.540]  using it as an excuse to crack down on us only the experts need to be involved in self-defense
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:47.900]  60 years later this is a government uh problem and and of course even if you just accept what
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:53.260]  they're talking about how is it that if a large bureaucracy the fbi and the other
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:00.140]  entities police agencies like that here in washington were incapable of handling september
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.460]  11 and completely missed them they were out looking for guys like you and me in the vast
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:11.660]  right-wing conspiracy uh because reno had so directed the fbi had really made them politically
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.780]  correct and so the plane loads of victims flew right by their nose they never had a clue
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:23.900]  and when patrick lahey senator from vermont asked ashcroft prior to the enactment of patriot one
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:30.780]  what are the powers in here that would have been used to stop september 11 he said none oh no they
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:35.260]  told us now that they've taken more liberty oh get ready for even bigger to attach and then we'll
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:40.780]  take even more liberty we hate getting our our pension funds expanded more power and control
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.020]  government never likes that but gee we've got to go ahead and enslave you and somehow we were
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:52.060]  supposed to believe that uh the ineptitude of a large bureaucracy was somehow going to be relieved
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:57.980]  by making it even bigger and giving an unlimited power sounds like a good idea now that's a great
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.700]  point though larry in world war ii they handed out guns we didn't have one they had the people
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.380]  defend the border now you go down to defend the border the police will arrest you i drive through
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:13.500]  checkpoints they search my car internally but there's no one on the border this is pathetic
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:19.900]  you know it would be so simple to even make do perhaps with the existing border patrol
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:25.580]  forces that they have if they would use the same technology they're using to try to seal
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:31.980]  borders in afghanistan and and work with our troops in iraq those predator drones would be
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:39.900]  just excellent but let me tell you the scam warner you know the senator uh what is he defense
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:45.260]  chairman right now over the committee armed forces i guess yeah he he came out and he said
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:51.340]  in the news he said no i want drones to watch u.s citizens and uh then they came out and they said
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:56.300]  okay well what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and we're going to say it's for the
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:01.100]  border it's the same story it isn't going to be for the border to larry well i missed what warner
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:07.180]  said that's outrageous i'm not surprised that he said it because he's really a new world order type
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:14.780]  but um uh well anyway why don't we talk to the callers let's see how they settle to us all right
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:19.260]  we're about to go to brisbee hung up let's talk to sylvester in south carolina sylvester you're on
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:25.980]  the air go ahead go ahead sylvester you're on the air good morning mr pratt mr jones hello
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:32.860]  look i'd like your opinion like there was a article in a little paper uh small towns or
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:41.740]  tape and it was written by robert novak and it was saying the nra probably won't support uh
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:49.740]  uh congressman paul yes sir well and it said the gun owners of america you know would
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:56.700]  um what it's all about this uh ostensibly all about this uh bill that we've been talking about
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:04.220]  yes uh lawsuit bill and congressman paul i happen to disagree with him but he he made his argument
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:09.740]  based on his understanding of the constitution that this legislation was a violation of the
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:16.620]  basic federal structure in the country and he had some criticisms that were perhaps even more
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:21.180]  forceful about the wording of the law and it may not be as effective as people would hope it would
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:28.460]  be well i disagreed with him particularly on the federalist angle because i think letting a state
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:34.140]  determine what all states do is not federalism but that was an honest disagreement he's arguing
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:40.460]  the state should pass uh bans on suing and that was the rest of his argument but how are you going
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:47.180]  to say that ron paul is anti-gun when he's the guy that has the legislation introduced that would do
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:53.260]  away with federal gun control that's a hard sell and that's not going to go down in his district
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:59.660]  i i know that district and i i've talked to the office since that uh article came out and since
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.900]  the vote took place and there were people that wrote in and questioned why he had voted the way
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.860]  he did and when he explained it they can live with it because they know that ron paul isn't
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:13.740]  playing games he is calling it the way he sees it he's right down the line he's got a bill to
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:19.660]  abolish the federal reserve get us out of the un uh he's got bills to repeal all the gun laws
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.260]  and so he's saying hey this is more federal control and i've read the bill it does have some
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:28.060]  holes in it but we have got look i'm for criminal charges against those that have called for
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:33.100]  rocketeering and going against gun manufacturers they have said it's a conspiracy larry to shut
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.620]  down the second amendment so i don't know why they're still walking around they're not behind
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:43.500]  bars they have absolutely done that the attorneys general at one point under clinton uh were doing
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:49.820]  the same thing they were in an open conspiracy but of course they're above the law so rico wouldn't
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:56.300]  apply to them it just applies to pro-lifers and if gunny's ever had enough demonstrations to
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:03.260]  really bother them they would do the same thing to gun owners so anyway the i i think the nra is
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:07.980]  i'm not quite sure why they're that peaked with this with the congressman because
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:15.660]  they had a zillion and one votes it was to their opposing ron paul didn't hold them up and so it's
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:20.460]  some petty issue they can now attack a real conservative and then go after one of the real
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:26.700]  enemies i guarantee you if they try something against him it will be fruitless that man is so
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:33.180]  he has been able to effectively explain to cotton farmers why the subsidies they've been getting are
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:39.180]  not good for them i mean this guy is a very effective and articulate spokesman yeah he
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.420]  certainly is we've had him on many times we support him let's uh anything else ilvestor
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:48.380]  yeah there's one thing i have to say about this my opinion in other words the federal government
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:53.100]  you know i'm in i'm in agreeance with what he says the federal government is trying to
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:32:00.620]  run the state well and that they issued these against of course and they already are though so
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:05.980]  we're just going to the federal government saying okay then you can't uh go after gun makers you
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.860]  can't say that i can't have a gun in virginia because of a lawsuit you had in brooklyn new york
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:16.220]  which is the ultimate impact and this and this becomes a larger i guess kind of preemption debate
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:22.540]  exactly uh thanks for the call silvester fred in south dakota uh fred you're on the
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:29.900]  air with larry pratt go ahead how are you doing gentlemen hello yes uh i got two questions
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:35.500]  essentially uh the first one would be uh i tuned in a little late and i was wondering
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:43.020]  how far this uh s 22 has gone in their greasy little legislation uh if it is law
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:51.180]  or what else whatever it is uh and the other question is mr pratt uh you've lived in washington
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:57.180]  for a time and uh it's been my experience that i've lived from one coast to the other coast in
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:04.780]  this country and uh i've seen that even i can think way back when they uh were just getting
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:10.860]  rid of the cattle guards in the west uh people didn't realize that they were pieces of steel
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:16.380]  grading to keep cattle in a cattle in a particular area there were people in in areas that actually
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.860]  believed that it was a human being that was being laid off right people back here were thinking that
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:25.660]  well i wonder how they dress cattle guards out there in the country yes it was it was amusing
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:31.420]  but the point is are are they that far out of touch they're disingly out of touch
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:39.100]  and you believe in your heart of hearts that the days come and when they start like s 20 like this
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:44.620]  s 22 business uh they're going to be in for a surprise they didn't plan on well let them
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:50.060]  let them answer it i mean i can real quick say that thing passed the house last year the session
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:55.260]  ended now it's back where is it right now larry a component of it did perhaps the nastiest which
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:00.940]  is the so-called our lady of peace which would allow the psychiatrist to determine who does or
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:07.340]  does not have a gun but uh it's part of a larger bill that would put gun shows out of business and
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:15.740]  do all kinds of things it's kind of the omnibus barf bill and that is happily not moving at the
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:23.180]  moment it's still to be heard in committee but of course with bush shaking things up it's going to
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:30.220]  embolden the other side and that means that this thing could come storming to life now that's bush
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:34.460]  giving aid and comfort to the enemy democrats well we have to realize we're dealing with people
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:41.020]  that are completely out of touch with their constituents totally unfortunately well there's
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.700]  all too much truth to that i'm afraid you know you guys are older than i am you're telling me
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:49.580]  people in dc thought they were when they were taking cattle guards out of the highways they
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:54.940]  thought they were firing an actual guard yeah yeah actually i talked to a congressman that
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:00.460]  had beaten george bush i'm struggling to remember his name he was a very conservative democrat
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:07.820]  and he told a joke without ever saying the word bush but he talked about this connecticut yankee
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:13.420]  that had been driving on his limo uh along the texas road and he got lost and he asked for
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:18.300]  directions and the directions finally led him up to the entrance to the ranch and the guy said and
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:24.380]  you'll you'll uh as soon as you go across the uh the cattle guards you'll be you know on the ranch
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:30.140]  and the window rolled up with the limousine and they drove on and all of a sudden it backed up
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.660]  and they said oh by the way um those cattle guards how will they be dressed
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:41.100]  i heard that hey but here's the deal for those that don't know in case uh the cattle guard is
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:46.380]  bars in the ground so a cow won't won't step on it because they look you know for holes in the
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:51.260]  ground uh it it won't walk across and leave your land so the gate can be open so you can drive
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.660]  onto your property exactly well for those that didn't know and for those who didn't know the
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:01.100]  second amendment's an individual right too uh yeah i know it's a lot of it is just these people
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:06.780]  are just delusional silver spoon morons and that's a big part of our problem we'll be right
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:17.820]  back with larry pratt final segment war calls well larry pratt's going to be on msnbc this
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:23.660]  afternoon with poppy cannon i hope he mentions not just the suits of the gun manufacturers but
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:28.620]  bush's gun grabbing trying to reinstate the clinton program and more are you going to do
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:34.140]  that larry when you're on the show or well i think there might be a way to slip it in and
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:39.580]  that would be to point out that maybe these lawsuits won't make that much difference if
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:45.260]  bush ends up banning our guns anyway well that's you know that's the way the media controls things
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.580]  they'll tell you because i've been on good morning america and only shows not as much as you have
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:54.540]  obviously and they'll tell you that you're talking about this issue this alone well how can you talk
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:37:00.140]  about an issue without connecting it to everything else well at least with pat buchanan i'll probably
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:05.980]  have a chance to get a word in edgewise if it's uh something critical of bush now is press on
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:12.780]  that show yes now there's an aggressive liberal um he's a piece of work he's extremely personable
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:18.940]  and friendly when you're off camera as soon as the camera's on and he'll bring a point up
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:23.020]  challenge you and you can see his lip quivering he's you know he gives every impression that
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:29.740]  he's almost out of control yeah we got a bunch of callers a quick question comment for larry
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:34.940]  pratt bruce in arizona and george michael and joe go ahead bruce you're on the air okay i have a
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:41.980]  question enough in 1776 did we vote king george off this this continent and when are you going
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:46.860]  to start telling people to do what they need to do versus just being informed because informed
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:52.140]  people can be moved aside just well did you hear all said that the founding fathers resulted over
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:57.020]  much revolt over much lighter forms of oppression but right now we've got to educate people comments
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:04.940]  larry i i have to agree with you alex that uh people were willing to fight because well let's
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:10.220]  put it let me make an anecdote to give you they were enforcing patriot act like activities
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:18.300]  well indeed they were uh before the battle of lexington and concord uh the pastor clark jonas
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:23.580]  clark had been asked by someone well would your men fight and his answer was well of course they
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:27.980]  will that's what i've been preaching well have you heard that being preached in very many places no
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:31.740]  we've well we've got him telling us about this church here in austin says turn your guns in
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:37.020]  good point bruce i i appreciate the call we got to educate folks first and we got to take our
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.900]  country back and we've got the republic now it's this group of scallywags that are taking it over
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:47.660]  george in uh tennessee you're on the air go ahead hello this is george from texas okay doesn't
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:54.860]  matter go ahead uh yes uh mr pratt uh i'm honored to uh to be a new life member of your organization
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:59.420]  i've done my part very much i appreciate that plug by the way people can find out how to do
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:05.340]  that at gunowners.org where they can call our toll-free number triple eight double eight six
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:12.540]  guns that's eight eight eight eight eight six guns or gunowners.org uh real quick george any
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:19.260]  comments or uh yes i was involved in george w bush's uh 1994 campaign for governor and i
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.820]  distributed a lot of his yard signs and bumper stickers well it does matter you're from texas
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:30.940]  and uh i did get a personal commitment from him face to face when i talked to him because i did
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:37.500]  get a chance to talk to him about the gun issue that he would never betray the gun owner and i
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:44.060]  think he might be getting some bad advice he may not be aware of what some of the people uh are
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:50.140]  is going on underneath him oh yeah maybe skull and bones is a crushing organization too george
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:56.300]  well alex i agree with you on on everything about mr bush but i think on this issue he may
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:02.700]  be being betrayed i got you bad political advice even if he wants our guns it's a stupid move thanks
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:09.500]  for the call yeah i agree michael in kentucky michael go ahead you're on the air well hey
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:16.860]  alex and uh larry um and i hope i can use my your first names uh one thing that no you better call
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:24.060]  me lord jones go ahead well you know how southerners are and and there are politeness
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:29.900]  sometimes we say certain man and all that um anyway it took me a while after i found this
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:36.860]  out support to sneak in but you read the original intent in the preamble to the bill of rights
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:44.060]  and they're kind of misnamed they're actually bill of restrictions really i'm trying to be
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.740]  polite too but we're honest polite in texas i need to know what your point is we're almost out
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.540]  of time right i'm trying to say that that uh when we say that these things are rights that are in
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:56.460]  the bill of rights it's actually a restriction on the government when you think about it that way
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:01.180]  everybody's kind of looking at them the wrong way and the supreme court's uh ruling on them back
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.860]  thank you michael you know that's a good point larry these really are restrictions on them
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:10.300]  the whole constitution was set up uh to make it clear what the government could do wasn't very
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:15.020]  much and just in case somebody didn't get the idea from the main body of the constitution
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:19.340]  they gave us the bill of rights real quick 10th amendment is perhaps the most important
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:25.580]  so is the night uh that phone number again uh triple eight double eight six guns that's 888
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:33.100]  886 guns or gun owners dot org and that's where you get on our email list absolutely great email
