[01:56.400 --> 02:03.640]  got the plan parent on every corner the number one tyrant is right here so everything is

[04:12.600 --> 04:18.280]  rates them psychologically I hope the enemies of this broadcast when you lie about us when

[05:40.400 --> 05:44.200]  was hoping Marco Rubio would overtake Cruz in the race but Rubio's love affair with
[05:44.200 --> 05:50.000]  and the state for illegal aliens makes an unelectable in the eyes of many Americans keep checking

[08:30.400 --> 08:36.680]  Welcome my friends welcome thank you so much for joining us as we broadcast worldwide on
[08:36.680 --> 08:45.360]  this 18th day of January 2016 it is a Monday I always start the broadcast and try to be
[08:45.360 --> 08:51.720]  calm as best I can but one reason I get so angry is getting ready at night for the next
[08:51.720 --> 08:58.640]  day's radio show getting ready in the morning and then coming in and going over the stacks
[08:58.640 --> 09:04.640]  and stacks of news and just looking at it for myself and seeing the spin seeing the
[09:04.640 --> 09:10.560]  insanity seeing the deception but also seeing the truth makes my blood boil and I always
[09:10.560 --> 09:15.520]  get asked by folks on the ground by media well how do you know what's accurate and what
[09:15.520 --> 09:23.640]  isn't and that's an incredibly complex question and I don't think you can answer how a great
[09:23.640 --> 09:28.960]  painter like Rembrandt was able to capture the light and do what he did he couldn't describe
[09:28.960 --> 09:35.640]  it he was just able to do it and I'm not describing what I do here on air as some great Rembrandt
[09:35.640 --> 09:40.520]  but when it comes to knowing their lies knowing what their next move is going to be knowing
[09:40.520 --> 09:46.200]  how they operate if you study something for 20 plus years even if you're not the sharpest
[09:46.200 --> 09:49.880]  knife in the drawer you're going to get pretty proficient at tracking it and understanding
[09:49.880 --> 09:56.680]  it and I think that's what this comes down to is the average man is an expert on following
[09:56.680 --> 10:02.400]  sports or an expert on how to be social at work to be promoted you know playing golf
[10:02.400 --> 10:05.520]  and being you know nice at work is probably more important than actually getting a lot
[10:05.520 --> 10:11.200]  done in most companies there's social skills there's different types of IQ there's mathematical
[10:11.200 --> 10:17.440]  IQ there is social aptitude there is your looks I mean there's so many things that go
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.960]  into it but as a culture people are really good at following the trends of television
[10:23.960 --> 10:29.280]  following the trends of entertainment following the trends of style following really this
[10:29.280 --> 10:36.320]  false reality that's been projected but now this false reality has been able to more and
[10:36.320 --> 10:45.040]  more take control of the real world and because humans can envision what they then build what
[10:45.040 --> 10:53.280]  the globalist put out as a pipe dream many times actually becomes a reality and when
[10:53.280 --> 10:58.000]  you think about how they control mass movements through hype and through fads and through
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.760]  peer pressure you really then can see the master design but that's only one thing that
[11:03.760 --> 11:08.440]  goes into it but when you see what they're pushing what they're trying to brand what
[11:08.440 --> 11:13.320]  their agenda is then you fully understand where they're going and then you can pick
[11:13.320 --> 11:20.480]  up a declassified psychological warfare program from the US from Russia from England from
[11:20.480 --> 11:25.360]  Japan and you know what the next paragraph is going to be when you're reading those white
[11:25.360 --> 11:31.920]  papers because you're so immersed already in the psychological system the nomenclature
[11:31.920 --> 11:41.640]  the culture the ether the ocean the soup that is the thinking of conquest economies you
[11:41.640 --> 11:46.920]  know the frauds you know the game plans you you know the drive you you know the mind of
[11:46.920 --> 11:55.600]  the enemy and bless the general public's heart they just want a nice car want to have some
[11:55.600 --> 12:00.120]  vacation time want to go get drunk want to watch a football game want to have some good
[12:00.120 --> 12:08.480]  sex they're not even thinking at the level of a manager or a controller or a master controller
[12:08.480 --> 12:19.160]  so the world's just a bunch of complexity a storm a sandstorm of work and they just
[12:19.160 --> 12:24.800]  want to get away from it they want to hide from it and then they run into the arms of
[12:24.800 --> 12:31.080]  the false paradigm they run into the arms of the delusion they're now ready and willing
[12:31.080 --> 12:38.680]  and wanting to be deceived here's an example that I'll get into all the news I saw going
[12:38.680 --> 12:46.280]  through over 150 articles today two different stories out of prestigious publications going
[12:46.280 --> 12:54.360]  hey did you know that they just invented mixing humans with plants and animals and insects
[12:54.360 --> 13:02.520]  and they're in Petri dishes there's these little mutants in that queue to can now it's
[13:02.520 --> 13:13.640]  been the same story for 20 plus years since they started reporting this and they tried
[13:13.640 --> 13:23.200]  to reporting 20 years ago or so about 1995 they started reporting on that the fact that
[13:23.200 --> 13:26.760]  they've been happening for 10 years and I know I keep harping on this because if you
[13:26.760 --> 13:30.840]  understand this you understand everything and then now instead of it being in a white
[13:30.840 --> 13:38.840]  paper or being in a scientific publication 20 years ago where I would have to go almost
[13:38.840 --> 13:44.640]  every day as a talk show host to the UT library and dig through the periodical stuff that the
[13:44.640 --> 13:48.440]  professors would be in there going through it looking at me like I was a space alien
[13:48.440 --> 13:53.600]  saying are you a student no wow I wish my students cared about this I wish they were
[13:53.600 --> 14:02.120]  digging through the microfilm the microfiche my gosh you're showing interest you ought
[14:02.120 --> 14:07.160]  to come you know trying to get a doctorate that's how bizarre it is to the intelligency
[14:07.160 --> 14:17.320]  that anyone even cares now it's in the news constantly and they're mainlining it financial
[14:17.320 --> 14:24.680]  times of London today Petri dish magic cultivates a modern chimera scientists create organisms
[14:24.680 --> 14:30.200]  that contain cells of humans and animals and then it goes on and notice they always couch
[14:30.200 --> 14:39.320]  it perfectly the it's always cells it's always tissue it's always magic it's cute it's fun
[14:39.320 --> 14:48.320]  oh there's creatures with cells in them oh this goat has the cells of spiders oh there's
[14:48.320 --> 14:56.920]  tissue in this cow in its uterus that has human cells no it's a humanoid when you read
[14:56.920 --> 15:02.680]  the white papers that's part cow but looks like a human so that the cow doesn't reject
[15:02.680 --> 15:13.160]  it it's a clone related to that very species of cow so that it won't be rejected that's
[15:13.160 --> 15:21.400]  30 years ago 15 years ago China was selling human milk produced by cows it's identical
[15:21.400 --> 15:28.120]  to human milk coming out of cow udders do you have any idea the mutagens the viruses
[15:28.120 --> 15:36.080]  the bacteria mixtures how deadly dangerous this is the cross species contamination the
[15:36.080 --> 15:57.960]  zoological hell fire I run into every year to top scientists top genetic engineers top
[15:57.960 --> 16:02.640]  people you've heard a lot of them on the air people that have had it up entire gmo companies
[16:02.640 --> 16:06.640]  top scientists have been on whistleblowing about yes we found that the long leaf potato
[16:06.640 --> 16:12.360]  developed in England actually sterilized mammal species within two generations and was toxic
[16:12.360 --> 16:18.280]  and when I brought it forward you know to the board they said shut up we're gonna fire you
[16:18.280 --> 16:25.400]  that's the kind of folks I've had on but I have run into ut professors and I run into
[16:25.400 --> 16:38.080]  others at parties and events and they'll all be huddled around and then they'll see me
[16:38.080 --> 16:41.400]  and they'll say yes what you talk about true it's much worse than you know and they'll
[16:41.400 --> 16:45.280]  and they'll start talking about it and this happened like four times and they'll just
[16:45.280 --> 16:50.000]  start men women you name it they'll just start rocking back and forth in their seats with
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.680]  what they know and I go what's going on and they go you know what's going on but we can't
[16:54.680 --> 16:59.400]  talk about it but it's worse than you know that's why we're moving out to Wembley or
[16:59.400 --> 17:04.880]  we're moving out to Costa Rica and we're moving and we're just waiting and I'm like waiting
[17:04.880 --> 17:12.160]  for what this is happening they're like you know like what's going on you know it's horrible
[17:12.160 --> 17:22.800]  I go what's horrible you know folks if 30 years ago they were growing humans inside cows
[17:22.800 --> 17:27.320]  do you can you imagine what's going on on these giant government reservations everywhere
[17:27.320 --> 17:33.520]  I mean the word is in Austin Texas they've got huge labs just full of this I've talked
[17:33.520 --> 17:38.600]  to people involved and they're scared I mean the stuff they're doing to monkeys out at
[17:38.600 --> 17:47.240]  Bastrop is nothing compared to what they're doing to these humanoids and the pharmacological
[17:47.240 --> 17:58.240]  crops being grown everywhere and the incredible evil of it all and the fact that you can't
[17:58.240 --> 18:03.600]  even get anyone concerned and the fact that every article I read about is how it's cute
[18:03.600 --> 18:08.760]  and how it's funny and how it's neat and how it's no big deal no discussion of do these
[18:08.760 --> 18:12.960]  creatures have rights you know they're telling you about it they brought them to term you
[18:12.960 --> 18:18.400]  know for heaven's sakes they're walking around folks I mean there's a whole breakaway civilization
[18:18.400 --> 18:26.640]  and we're living in a real ex files and the scariest part is they've got the reporters
[18:26.640 --> 18:31.960]  it's always elite publications MIT quarterly financial Times of London Wall Street Journal
[18:31.960 --> 18:37.200]  New York Times always the same people always the same operatives always couching it as
[18:37.200 --> 18:42.880]  non-threatening oh they're mixing humans other things it's no big deal oh Planned Parenthood
[18:42.880 --> 18:55.720]  does sell some tissue no it's dead babies and it's the way they just sell it all
[18:55.720 --> 18:59.680]  and you see the conditioning of the public and then you think about what are they doing
[18:59.680 --> 19:03.800]  in the GMO to us what are they doing in the vaccines what are they doing and just what
[19:03.800 --> 19:08.760]  we know what the UN's been caught doing with sterile and hormones added to the tetanus
[19:08.760 --> 19:14.960]  shots and SV 40s and literally hundreds of other deadly super viruses added to major
[19:14.960 --> 19:19.600]  vaccines and when companies do do a study they sue them and say it's proprietary or not
[19:19.600 --> 19:27.600]  allowed to reverse engineer our mutated genetic virus it's basically nanotech they're putting
[19:27.600 --> 19:34.120]  viruses in people now that mutate by design us and every cancer is just everywhere everybody's
[19:34.120 --> 19:38.960]  dying all around us they've conditioned us to just slowly be killed and not even notice
[19:38.960 --> 19:42.840]  it and then I've got to hear about racism and black lives matter and everybody fighting
[19:42.840 --> 19:49.040]  with each other and all this George Soros run weirdness with a freakish Nazi collaborator
[19:49.040 --> 19:54.560]  ruling the planet is doing horrible things and the average man just wants to talk to

[22:04.760 --> 22:08.360]  our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing ten years
[22:08.360 --> 22:11.920]  ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials
[22:11.920 --> 22:16.760]  started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID
[22:16.760 --> 22:21.680]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was
[22:21.680 --> 22:26.440]  also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit
[22:26.440 --> 22:31.280]  passes would all soon incorporate RFID it was then I formed ID stronghold to share my
[22:31.280 --> 22:35.640]  inventions and blocking RFID signals with the world there are a lot of misconceptions

[24:19.600 --> 24:27.600]  only the executive branch but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges to
[24:27.600 --> 24:32.280]  make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution due process and rule of law then we're gonna
[24:32.280 --> 24:41.000]  have some problems the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind I'm not trying
[24:41.000 --> 24:48.560]  to be negative when I get up here and I talk about the whole breakaway shadow government
[24:48.560 --> 24:54.920]  takes more resources than the rest of the economy and the planet gets shadow government
[24:54.920 --> 25:02.320]  worldwide and this giant Manhattan like project I've always described the new world order
[25:02.320 --> 25:11.200]  as a man Manhattan project squared meaning exponentially order of magnitude larger and
[25:11.200 --> 25:17.680]  notice now you hear the Davos people you hear Hillary you hear others describing what they're
[25:17.680 --> 25:27.880]  building as a Manhattan project which means a huge giant trillion dollar in today's money
[25:27.880 --> 25:36.240]  system completely secret with hundreds of thousands of people involved and so it really
[25:36.240 --> 25:45.600]  is a breakaway civilization but not a spaceship like Elysium it's right here and one of the
[25:45.600 --> 25:49.680]  greatest examples of that and I'm gonna go do this myself the next week it's an important
[25:49.680 --> 25:57.680]  piece I want to shoot is the JJ Pickle Center in Austin Texas in north Austin and it's
[25:57.680 --> 26:06.800]  been there since the 70s it's a giant facility it's got all sorts of secret stuff in it what
[26:06.800 --> 26:21.720]  we know about is the largest or one of the largest research reactors in the world one
[26:21.720 --> 26:27.320]  of the largest research reactors in the world and the reason I routinely mention that is
[26:27.320 --> 26:31.920]  I've talked to probably a couple hundred people on the street average folks police officers
[26:31.920 --> 26:41.000]  you name it and I say do you know about the nuclear reactors in Austin and they go no
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.120]  and a lot of the public says you got any other conspiracy theories for me so that's what
[26:45.120 --> 26:50.960]  I mean people who are ignorant just use the conspiracy theory label to not have a discussion
[26:50.960 --> 26:56.600]  with you and of course they don't know there's genetic engineer facilities all over the country
[26:56.600 --> 27:05.520]  that are clandestine that are behind glass windows in many cases these aren't even really
[27:05.520 --> 27:16.560]  hidden that's how on curious and uninvolved and zombie like the public is is that it's
[27:16.560 --> 27:22.400]  been known Planned Parenthood and others have been selling baby parts since Roe v Wade got
[27:22.400 --> 27:29.080]  rammed through in 1973 there have been lawsuits it's come out abortionists have gone to jail
[27:29.080 --> 27:34.400]  many times because pro-lifers break in they go to jail too and you know and show evidence
[27:34.400 --> 27:38.880]  and notepads of where they're making fun of the dead babies they're selling their parts
[27:38.880 --> 27:43.040]  they're keeping them alive they throw them in the dumpster there's a whole bunch of people
[27:43.040 --> 27:48.400]  that have testified to Congress hundreds of people that have survived because used to they
[27:48.400 --> 27:53.240]  weren't always selling the parts they just throw them out and they were so lazy that
[27:53.240 --> 27:57.320]  they wouldn't even throw them in a bucket or the baby'd be crooked in the water bucket
[27:57.320 --> 28:01.640]  and it'd be you know eight month baby and they throw out the trash can and pro-lifers
[28:01.640 --> 28:07.360]  would get them out of the dumpster they would wait till five o'clock every day see see how
[28:07.360 --> 28:10.760]  truth is tragedy the fiction there's a lot of famous people we've had a couple of these
[28:10.760 --> 28:16.040]  women on who are survivors tougher fetus tougher baby usually female most of the survivors
[28:16.040 --> 28:20.040]  are women and a lot of them they've got big hacked wounds you know legs that were pulled
[28:20.040 --> 28:29.840]  off now Planned Parenthood is suing the Center for Medical Progress who snuck in did these
[28:29.840 --> 28:36.880]  interviews came in through open doors investigative journalism you know when you're exposing criminal
[28:36.880 --> 28:43.560]  activity you're legally covered and they'll probably end up winning their lawsuit that
[28:43.560 --> 28:49.200]  is the CMP will if they have enough money but they're gonna need support but what I'm
[28:49.200 --> 28:53.400]  getting at here is there's a lot going on right beneath the surface and you don't even
[28:53.400 --> 28:57.000]  have to scratch the paint off the wall to see what's beneath it the paint's peeling
[28:57.000 --> 29:02.880]  off and now they're just coming out with all these articles more and more admitting so
[29:02.880 --> 29:08.200]  much of what's going on oh there's a plan to add stuff to jet fuel to protect us from
[29:08.200 --> 29:15.760]  global warming oh we've been doing some testing with aluminum salts and aluminum dioxide and
[29:15.760 --> 29:22.320]  barium and things to this kind of oh yeah there's a world government oh yeah and they
[29:22.320 --> 29:26.880]  take all our tax money they exempt themselves and they're just building giant research
[29:26.880 --> 29:31.880]  labs everywhere with cyclotrons and heavy conducting super colliders and nuclear reactors
[29:31.880 --> 29:37.880]  and fission fusion and black hole accelerators and just crazy mad scientist planet with genetic
[29:37.880 --> 29:41.640]  engineering and thousands of pharmacological crops and everybody's getting sick from the
[29:41.640 --> 29:46.080]  pollen and meanwhile Kim Kardashian we'll be back with the news though we'll be back
[29:46.080 --> 29:54.840]  with the news we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:54.840 --> 30:02.640]  so gas stations in Michigan have lowered their gas prices to under one dollar per gallon
[30:02.640 --> 30:07.460]  with one station as low as 78 cents per gallon meanwhile across the US oil is so plentiful
[30:07.460 --> 30:11.360]  and cheap that at least one buyer said it would actually need to be paid to refine oil
[30:11.360 --> 30:15.720]  Flint Hill Resources a refinery owned by the Koch brothers said it wants 50 cents a barrel
[30:15.720 --> 30:20.120]  Friday for North Dakota Sour a high-grade soul for grade of crude according to a list
[30:20.120 --> 30:24.720]  price posted on its website in comparison the refinery was paying $13.50 a barrel a year
[30:24.720 --> 30:30.840]  ago and $47.60 in January 2014 overall US benchmark oil prices have collapsed more than
[30:30.840 --> 30:36.080]  70% in the past 18 months and fell below $30 a barrel for the first time in 12 years last
[30:36.080 --> 30:40.400]  week West Texas Intermediate was already trading near $29 in New York on Monday this will lead
[30:40.400 --> 30:43.880]  to the collapse of major oil companies and the loss of tens of thousands jobs meaning
[30:43.880 --> 30:47.560]  the economic compression is likely in other words the global oversupply of oil is now
[30:47.560 --> 30:51.200]  reached the point that the market is effectively forcing producers to pay them to give their
[30:51.200 --> 30:55.400]  oil away otherwise oil will simply sit in bloated source facilities are on tankers parked
[30:55.400 --> 31:17.360]  out in the ocean this is the kid Daniels with info words.com reporting again ladies and

[33:05.320 --> 33:10.760]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat in UK hospitals.
[33:10.760 --> 33:14.680]  Silent green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[33:14.680 --> 33:20.400]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals
[33:20.400 --> 33:21.400]  in the UK.
[33:21.400 --> 33:25.680]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[33:25.680 --> 33:30.840]  What is the secret of silent green?
[33:30.840 --> 33:33.440]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[33:33.440 --> 33:36.240]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[33:36.240 --> 33:40.880]  Because of its enormous popularity, silent green is in short supply.
[33:40.880 --> 33:43.880]  Remember, Tuesday is silent green day.
[33:43.880 --> 33:46.880]  The supply of silent green has been exhausted.
[33:46.880 --> 33:49.880]  You must evacuate the area.
[33:49.880 --> 33:51.880]  It's silent green.
[33:51.880 --> 33:58.280]  The rule that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group company, are not allowed
[33:58.280 --> 34:04.200]  to know what they're using the baby parts for and the flavoring, but we already know.
[34:04.200 --> 34:06.200]  So enjoy the flavor.
[34:06.200 --> 34:09.400]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels
[34:09.400 --> 34:10.680]  and sales taxes.
[34:10.680 --> 34:12.600]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[34:12.600 --> 34:14.560]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[34:14.560 --> 34:15.840]  I'm for regular suicide.
[34:15.840 --> 34:17.880]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[34:17.880 --> 34:22.200]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would
[34:22.200 --> 34:29.240]  it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off and medical cost?
[34:29.240 --> 34:33.600]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[34:33.600 --> 34:48.120]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[34:48.120 --> 34:50.760]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[34:50.760 --> 34:55.600]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[34:55.600 --> 34:58.200]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[34:58.200 --> 35:03.160]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison
[35:03.160 --> 35:07.560]  guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[35:07.560 --> 35:10.560]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[35:10.560 --> 35:12.840]  The scoops are on their way.
[35:12.840 --> 35:15.160]  The scoops are on their way.
[35:15.160 --> 35:18.560]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[35:18.560 --> 35:21.880]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[35:21.880 --> 35:24.880]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[35:24.880 --> 35:26.880]  We've got to stop them.
[35:26.880 --> 35:27.880]  Come on.
[35:27.880 --> 35:31.880]  What is my secret name, Soylent Green?
[35:31.880 --> 35:34.480]  Soylent Green is people.
[35:34.480 --> 35:38.040]  Soon they'll be breeding us like cattle.
[35:38.040 --> 35:40.040]  They'll be breeding us like cattle.
[35:40.040 --> 35:42.040]  You've got to tell them.
[35:42.040 --> 35:45.960]  You've got to tell them.
[35:45.960 --> 35:53.360]  That came out in the early 1970s, and of course it's basically based on a lot of white papers
[35:53.360 --> 36:01.440]  put out by people like Paul Ehrlich, who wrote Ecoscience the same year that film came out
[36:01.440 --> 36:05.280]  with the current White House science are that I've talked so much about where they admit
[36:05.280 --> 36:10.440]  fluorides put in the water to lower your IQ and lower fertility.
[36:10.440 --> 36:15.600]  Books free online, 1,100 pages long, you might want to go read it, and about how they see
[36:15.600 --> 36:22.560]  the planet as a petri dish and that bacteria in a petri dish will eat through the base,
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.320]  the medium, and then they will eat each other.
[36:26.320 --> 36:28.760]  They will die in their own excrement.
[36:28.760 --> 36:33.160]  Not that humans would innovate, not that humans would go to the stars, but that no, humans
[36:33.160 --> 36:40.840]  are the problem and must be removed to manageable levels in neo-futilism run by a technocracy,
[36:40.840 --> 36:47.280]  a global government with the elite enjoying all of the spoils that we get zero.
[36:47.280 --> 36:49.080]  And by the way, it's in the news today.
[36:49.080 --> 36:53.800]  I saw two different articles again, suddenly, oh, we're going to be able to live forever
[36:53.800 --> 36:54.800]  soon.
[36:54.800 --> 36:57.880]  But can the general public have access to that?
[36:57.880 --> 37:01.640]  Many of you agree not to have any children.
[37:01.640 --> 37:05.680]  And you see, you notice cancer rates only go up the more money we spend looking for
[37:05.680 --> 37:07.200]  a cure.
[37:07.200 --> 37:12.920]  No one asking why is it exploding on every front.
[37:12.920 --> 37:19.360]  And believe me, they have, I don't want to say they have cures every time, but there are
[37:19.360 --> 37:25.240]  effective treatments that are withheld and that are shelved because they're seen as disruptive
[37:25.240 --> 37:30.960]  technologies and the public is then given 30, 40, 50 year old technology that doesn't
[37:30.960 --> 37:36.360]  work and ends up frying your body even if you survive and giving you leukemia.
[37:36.360 --> 37:41.160]  If you survive chemotherapy, they admit on record you're probably going to get leukemia
[37:41.160 --> 37:45.020]  within 10 to 15 years.
[37:45.020 --> 37:52.440]  And other cancers from the chemo itself.
[37:52.440 --> 37:59.680]  So many people I've seen take chemo who are fine and they're dead days later.
[37:59.680 --> 38:03.640]  I know two people personally last year who were fine with cancer, took chemo and were
[38:03.640 --> 38:05.560]  dead in a week.
[38:05.560 --> 38:11.960]  I had a dog, a Boston terrier, and my wife wanted to, wanted to do treatments.
[38:11.960 --> 38:15.560]  He had a tumor in his throat.
[38:15.560 --> 38:23.280]  He died 30 minutes after getting his first chemo shot.
[38:23.280 --> 38:26.320]  And what I'm getting at here is folks, they're suppressing the treatments.
[38:26.320 --> 38:33.680]  You wonder why Dick Cheney survived on a heart machine that no one else had ever survived.
[38:33.680 --> 38:40.120]  You know, Cheney is the record holder with that heart pump and he's about to be a record
[38:40.120 --> 38:46.520]  holder with a heart transplant and he looks good.
[38:46.520 --> 38:49.800]  But when he gives speeches on C-Spain, he talks about this is the care everyone gets.
[38:49.800 --> 38:51.880]  I got nothing special.
[38:51.880 --> 38:56.960]  Oh, Magic Johnson, he doesn't have HIV anymore.
[38:56.960 --> 38:59.400]  He's released his test a decade ago.
[38:59.400 --> 39:03.520]  Doesn't have the virus in him.
[39:03.520 --> 39:04.520]  How about you and your friends?
[39:04.520 --> 39:05.520]  How about you and your family?
[39:05.520 --> 39:06.800]  How's that working for you?
[39:06.800 --> 39:08.200]  Oh, they go in a box.
[39:08.200 --> 39:09.200]  They get cremated.
[39:09.200 --> 39:10.200]  Why?
[39:10.200 --> 39:11.200]  Don't they?
[39:11.200 --> 39:18.840]  So, while we're busy talking about discrimination over race or over sexual orientation, and
[39:18.840 --> 39:23.560]  oh, we got to have bathrooms for five-year-old trannies and all the public schools, all these
[39:23.560 --> 39:28.560]  diversions, we as a species are being targeted by the elite and basically exterminated.
[39:28.560 --> 39:33.360]  Now, I'm going to stop and cover news for the balance of the broadcast today.
[39:33.360 --> 39:36.480]  And David Knight's popping in to talk about something positive.
[39:36.480 --> 39:40.800]  I've spoken so much about how, and you've seen it manifested on this broadcast, this
[39:40.800 --> 39:49.320]  radio slash TV transmission, how the intelligentsia in the military, in the art culture, in Hollywood,
[39:49.320 --> 39:57.840]  in the media, in the news, in the scientific divisions, and in the religious realms, the
[39:57.840 --> 40:09.280]  clergy, the ecumenical, the ecclesiastical, the financial, the educational, the cultural,
[40:09.280 --> 40:13.960]  to use those terms.
[40:13.960 --> 40:15.560]  Basically everyone's having a debate now.
[40:15.560 --> 40:20.680]  They're going, okay, there is a planetary government, okay, it's very totalitarian.
[40:20.680 --> 40:22.680]  It is eugenics-based.
[40:22.680 --> 40:24.360]  It's anti-human.
[40:24.360 --> 40:27.480]  It's very oppressive.
[40:27.480 --> 40:28.760]  It's very deceptive.
[40:28.760 --> 40:30.760]  It's very hypocritical.
[40:30.760 --> 40:35.640]  Okay, the whole move for world government was not to bring in world peace and to stop
[40:35.640 --> 40:37.800]  weapons proliferation.
[40:37.800 --> 40:42.240]  It was about bringing in a hegemonic banking cartel to consolidate financial power, bring
[40:42.240 --> 40:46.560]  everyone else to their knees bankrupted so they can dictate the terms, and the terms
[40:46.560 --> 41:04.920]  are a narcoleptic extermination, a phased out culling of humanity, a childhood's end
[41:04.920 --> 41:06.680]  but not run by aliens.
[41:06.680 --> 41:13.280]  I mean, we're here, it's real, face it, or go watch NFL, party, drink, and just say you
[41:13.280 --> 41:19.040]  don't care, but I'm telling you what's going on, and why, where are the survival instincts?
[41:19.040 --> 41:23.440]  Because people in a dream don't feel like they've got to fight back because the mind
[41:23.440 --> 41:25.640]  at a subconscious level knows it's not real.
[41:25.640 --> 41:26.640]  This is real.
[41:26.640 --> 41:28.960]  The system wants you to be in a dream.
[41:28.960 --> 41:30.560]  This is real, folks.
[41:30.560 --> 41:31.560]  It's all over the place.
[41:31.560 --> 41:32.560]  You can't deny it.
[41:32.560 --> 41:36.920]  In fact, it's worse than I can say because I can't ever line it all up and explain it
[41:36.920 --> 41:37.920]  all.
[41:37.920 --> 41:40.240]  It's too big.
[41:40.240 --> 41:44.980]  One cannot see the matrix in a trance.
[41:44.980 --> 41:47.880]  You can only see it by waking up out of it.
[41:47.880 --> 41:53.320]  One cannot be told about it.
[41:53.320 --> 41:59.080]  It's like being 12 years old and talking to your big brother who's 18 and got a superhot
[41:59.080 --> 42:03.120]  girlfriend and he's like, what's it like when she's in the backseat of that car with
[42:03.120 --> 42:04.120]  you?
[42:04.120 --> 42:07.560]  And you know, you say, son, you just got to experience it for yourself.
[42:07.560 --> 42:12.440]  You got to experience those good things in life, a woman that loves you, pressed up against
[42:12.440 --> 42:17.160]  you, kissing her and all that passion, running your hands through her hair.
[42:17.160 --> 42:21.640]  You got to experience that and until you've experienced it, people don't know what it's
[42:21.640 --> 42:22.640]  like.
[42:22.640 --> 42:30.600]  Well, you've got to experience monkey farms in Bastrop run by UT killing hundreds of
[42:30.600 --> 42:36.720]  apes and monkeys a week, testing different psychological warfare systems and mainly just
[42:36.720 --> 42:41.080]  testing flicker rates with televisions, how to bring them in and out of trances, how to
[42:41.080 --> 42:45.600]  program them, how to show them television and then to see what makes them more suggestible
[42:45.600 --> 42:47.560]  and then they kill them.
[42:47.560 --> 42:55.960]  And then they take that primate study and they bring humans into the lab run by DARPA
[42:55.960 --> 42:58.040]  at the cute politically correct UT.
[42:58.040 --> 43:02.160]  I mean, you know, they tell you what language to use because they're real liberal.
[43:02.160 --> 43:09.600]  They walk around and act real trendy so they're not threatening when they are priests of the
[43:09.600 --> 43:18.800]  end of humans, high priest of doom, high priest of a suicide cult, Dr. Pionka, you know, we
[43:18.800 --> 43:22.400]  had the FBI investigate him and we talked about it, the FBI did go there.
[43:22.400 --> 43:26.560]  He's on TV going, you know, the bio weapon will soon be out, 90% will die.
[43:26.560 --> 43:28.760]  I'm ready for me and my family to die soon.
[43:28.760 --> 43:33.520]  It'll be airborne, like something out of, you know, 12 monkeys.
[43:33.520 --> 43:37.600]  You go to his UT website and he's talking about how much he loves Lucifer in druidic
[43:37.600 --> 43:42.360]  robes and you find out he's like the head of one of the departments.
[43:42.360 --> 43:43.360]  And then I started getting threats.
[43:43.360 --> 43:46.120]  I've told the story many times, I'll tell it again because I'm just getting back to
[43:46.120 --> 43:47.120]  the basics.
[43:47.120 --> 43:48.120]  I can't help it.
[43:48.120 --> 43:49.120]  This is what it's all about.
[43:49.120 --> 43:50.120]  All those other stuff is window dressing.
[43:50.120 --> 43:57.120]  And we get this threatening letter, you know, saying, how dare you talk about this great
[43:57.120 --> 44:01.400]  man and we look at who her name is and then later find out, you know, find articles, she's
[44:01.400 --> 44:06.080]  written about him positively and that she now works at a big bio research facility in
[44:06.080 --> 44:15.640]  California at the time advanced genetic engineering facility.
[44:15.640 --> 44:16.640]  And here she is.
[44:16.640 --> 44:21.840]  I'm trying to find a photo of her with her craze looking around this power trip and she
[44:21.840 --> 44:28.680]  sent us this letter and she said, of course, Pianca is, you know, quite kind.
[44:28.680 --> 44:31.000]  He's, he's, he's quite moderate.
[44:31.000 --> 44:38.600]  It's only saying 90% can you not deny humans are a parasite that must be dealt with and
[44:38.600 --> 44:41.920]  should probably be extinct.
[44:41.920 --> 44:45.280]  So thank Dr. Pianca that he's so gracious.
[44:45.280 --> 44:50.440]  See they, they put themselves in this position of everyone's going to die if we choose it.
[44:50.440 --> 44:57.440]  Of course, how he's quite liberal and quite kind to only want 90% to die.
[44:57.440 --> 44:58.440]  He's a great man.
[44:58.440 --> 45:03.960]  There are those of us who absolutely understand that's more than done.
[45:03.960 --> 45:05.920]  I mean, it's just like what?
[45:05.920 --> 45:06.920]  And there are no bodies.
[45:06.920 --> 45:13.120]  There are these soft power tripping people who just get off on the idea of deciding who
[45:13.120 --> 45:15.120]  lives and who dies.
[45:15.120 --> 45:22.920]  And he got a standing ovation in March of 2006, the Texas Academy of Sciences.
[45:22.920 --> 45:28.000]  I had reporters on it with their photos to standing ovations went on three times one
[45:28.000 --> 45:38.840]  a minute long with people crying as he projected a giant PowerPoint of skulls from Rwanda with
[45:38.840 --> 45:43.520]  a red human skulls with a red filter on it.
[45:43.520 --> 45:47.640]  And he said, we, you know, we must basically get rid of the human population as a disease.
[45:47.640 --> 45:53.320]  And it was a power tripping goblin moment where they were hopping up and down and crying
[45:53.320 --> 46:05.440]  and I mean, you know, you need to understand who you're dealing with.
[46:05.440 --> 46:09.600]  The scientists of this country are basically demon possessed.
[46:09.600 --> 46:12.280]  I don't know how else to describe it.
[46:12.280 --> 46:14.360]  Not a science fiction book where aliens do it.
[46:14.360 --> 46:15.360]  I don't know.
[46:15.360 --> 46:17.240]  I don't know what's doing it.
[46:17.240 --> 46:19.240]  All I'm telling you is we're screwed folks.
[46:19.240 --> 46:20.240]  Okay.
[46:20.240 --> 46:24.040]  I mean, unless we totally break with this and realize it's out of control, it's accelerated
[46:24.040 --> 46:25.160]  past us.
[46:25.160 --> 46:26.160]  It's crazy.
[46:26.160 --> 46:31.920]  I mean, you think it's a victory that even the Washington Post goes, okay, take the
[46:31.920 --> 46:32.920]  floor out of the water.
[46:32.920 --> 46:35.040]  It's hurting your teeth, giving you cancer.
[46:35.040 --> 46:36.200]  Who would have thought it?
[46:36.200 --> 46:37.280]  We made a mistake.
[46:37.280 --> 46:39.240]  Take it out of the pesticides.
[46:39.240 --> 46:44.760]  They've already moved on folks to God knows what.
[46:44.760 --> 46:52.280]  They've got GMO on record leaching into our DNA.
[46:52.280 --> 46:55.160]  I mean, I can't even believe I have to get up here and explain this to people.
[46:55.160 --> 46:56.160]  I mean, but that's it.
[46:56.160 --> 46:57.160]  I'm not a trans.
[46:57.160 --> 46:59.160]  I'm a white.
[46:59.160 --> 47:02.240]  And so let's hear, hear, let's get into the other news here.
[47:02.240 --> 47:09.640]  ISIS members, uh, massacres, 280 civilians for cooperating with the Syrian army report
[47:09.640 --> 47:11.320]  the risk of nuclear theft increasing.
[47:11.320 --> 47:12.600]  They're, they're, they're putting that out.
[47:12.600 --> 47:18.960]  So when they say terrorists did it, they've got a backstory, uh, robots, uh, new working
[47:18.960 --> 47:28.040]  ways to cost 5 million jobs by 2020 Davos Switzerland study says to Iranian poets facing
[47:28.040 --> 47:35.720]  lashings in prison, escape country, you know, here's what's really important, actually,
[47:35.720 --> 47:40.440]  because it just shows where it's all going to understand their engineering of financial
[47:40.440 --> 47:45.720]  collapse to then get more power out of it and more trillions and maker bailouts and
[47:45.720 --> 47:52.200]  more regulations to shut down all their competition and more immunity.
[47:52.200 --> 47:54.360]  French president declares economic emergency.
[47:54.360 --> 47:59.960]  Gee, you think when you come out with a hundred and one percent tax for three years on anyone
[47:59.960 --> 48:04.960]  whose middle class, gee, you think it will stall the country, which is exactly what he
[48:04.960 --> 48:05.960]  wants.
[48:05.960 --> 48:06.960]  So they can buy everything up.
[48:06.960 --> 48:07.960]  Those that are exempt.
[48:07.960 --> 48:11.520]  This whole party's been caught with Swiss bank accounts.
[48:11.520 --> 48:12.520]  They don't pay taxes.
[48:12.520 --> 48:14.480]  I thought of associated press.
[48:14.480 --> 48:18.280]  French president declares economic emergency, Hollande socialist government has struggled
[48:18.280 --> 48:21.160]  to boost long stagnant French growth.
[48:21.160 --> 48:22.160]  Oh, really?
[48:22.160 --> 48:24.720]  No, like, Obamacare isn't meant to shut down the economy.
[48:24.720 --> 48:29.640]  I love how, gee, we don't know what's going on.
[48:29.640 --> 48:36.320]  Double and triple health prices and the economy stalls.
[48:36.320 --> 48:39.600]  We don't know what's going on.
[48:39.600 --> 48:48.960]  The financial apocalypse accelerates as Middle East stocks crash to begin the week.
[48:48.960 --> 48:52.520]  Political officials, Walmart closures, shocking, devastating.
[48:52.520 --> 48:56.840]  Oh, you thought it would be, see, people keep thinking Walmart, I remember seeing these
[48:56.840 --> 49:05.080]  articles the last 20 years, when everything implodes because Walmart takes all the local
[49:05.080 --> 49:09.600]  jobs and finally the economy implodes and ships and slave goods.
[49:09.600 --> 49:11.400]  What are everybody going to do?
[49:11.400 --> 49:14.720]  Well, Walmart already had all that actually worried out.
[49:14.720 --> 49:20.320]  They've closed, you know, 140 something here in the U.S., two aren't something 69 worldwide.
[49:20.320 --> 49:29.840]  They'll close hundreds more by the time they're done because that's part of the plan.
[49:29.840 --> 49:35.000]  Walmart was allowed to do things nobody else was allowed to do and had longstanding relationships
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.600]  nobody else was allowed to have as part of a strategic partnership like IBM or Microsoft
[49:40.600 --> 49:44.680]  in the establishment.
[49:44.680 --> 49:50.400]  Their families getting, you know, what is it, 60 billion a piece or whatever that Bernie
[49:50.400 --> 49:54.200]  Sanders harps on all day?
[49:54.200 --> 50:02.160]  That's just icing on the cake for these people.
[50:02.160 --> 50:09.440]  And then they're there to basically sell out real capitalism with their crony capitalism.
[50:09.440 --> 50:11.840]  But you know who really did it?
[50:11.840 --> 50:15.680]  It was all the local people wanting the cheap slave goods that break by the time you get
[50:15.680 --> 50:17.320]  the toy out of the box.
[50:17.320 --> 50:22.160]  It was the people, all the little rural folks wanting to go see the big, pretty fancy store
[50:22.160 --> 50:27.000]  that had the big American flag hanging up in it and a picture of Walt.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.400]  I like Walt.
[50:29.400 --> 50:33.160]  They knew how to sell us and they knew how to take care of us, didn't they?
[50:33.160 --> 50:37.440]  Yeah, they did, boy.
[50:37.440 --> 50:39.680]  So that's just a model of it all.
[50:39.680 --> 50:43.960]  And they got Target for the trendy Liberals and all the rest of it.
[50:43.960 --> 50:46.240]  Disney World for the kitties.
[50:46.240 --> 50:51.040]  It's all about using you as a resource, a resource they see as garbage they want to

[51:58.400 --> 52:03.720]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinewetz, I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[52:03.720 --> 52:06.640]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic
[52:06.640 --> 52:07.640]  pickpocketing.
[52:07.640 --> 52:11.040]  Ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government
[52:11.040 --> 52:15.000]  officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip
[52:15.000 --> 52:16.000]  called RFID.
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.920]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[52:19.920 --> 52:24.960]  Soon after it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, US passports, hotel room
[52:24.960 --> 52:29.040]  keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[52:29.040 --> 52:32.840]  It was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with
[52:32.840 --> 52:33.840]  the world.
[52:33.840 --> 52:37.040]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[52:37.040 --> 52:40.280]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.

[53:57.000 --> 54:18.800]  All right, David Knight has some good news for us and I started to get into this earlier
[54:18.800 --> 54:20.680]  but I didn't so I'm going to do that in just a moment.
[54:20.680 --> 54:22.800]  They'll be with us five minutes to the next hour.
[54:22.800 --> 54:26.160]  The Injukari Jacks are going to be breaking it down in the fourth hour today.
[54:26.160 --> 54:29.120]  Those two co-hosting the fourth hour and a lot more.
[54:29.120 --> 54:34.840]  But 13 hours gets a good review from David Knight and Jakari Jackson.
[54:34.840 --> 54:39.240]  So that's coming up in the fourth hour and that's part of the positive thing I was saying
[54:39.240 --> 54:43.360]  where the intelligency is now really having a discussion.
[54:43.360 --> 54:49.480]  For the first time ever, the intelligency right below the elite of decompartmentalization
[54:49.480 --> 54:54.720]  about the horrible world the globalists are building using our resources, our time and
[54:54.720 --> 54:58.480]  energy and our acquiescence.
[54:58.480 --> 55:03.520]  And the fact that this new film just blames the government, blames those above the CIA
[55:03.520 --> 55:07.760]  and the State Department and says there was a stand down which there was for 13 hours,
[55:07.760 --> 55:13.440]  really about eight from the time they absolutely knew.
[55:13.440 --> 55:18.160]  And the fact that Michael Bay would put that out shows the rebellion I'm talking about in
[55:18.160 --> 55:19.760]  Hollywood.
[55:19.760 --> 55:23.480]  I haven't talked to Michael Bay but I've talked to pretty much everybody else.
[55:23.480 --> 55:25.320]  I mean a lot of top people.
[55:25.320 --> 55:26.680]  I mean Chris Carter is a listener.
[55:26.680 --> 55:31.480]  I'm going to leave it at that but look for something on that front very soon.
[55:31.480 --> 55:34.560]  People really understand this is for real now folks.
[55:34.560 --> 55:35.560]  This is for real.
[55:35.560 --> 55:38.680]  They're not just buying into the system anymore and it's system wide.
[55:38.680 --> 55:40.480]  It's a big game changer.
[55:40.480 --> 55:46.560]  Briefly, we have a new shower filter in that has a much quicker flow.
[55:46.560 --> 55:50.040]  I am very, very proud of it.
[55:50.040 --> 55:56.000]  It's put out by Pro Pure, the Pro Max and it basically cuts everything out or reduces
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.720]  it down to basically non-detectable levels, the fluoride, the glyphosate and it has a
[55:59.720 --> 56:03.920]  fast flow rate and it's very inexpensive with promo code water.

[56:15.840 --> 56:18.120]  deal and that helps find their operation.
[56:18.120 --> 56:20.600]  So thank you all for your support.
[56:20.600 --> 56:25.760]  We are ending several specials today at the end of the show and they're gone.
[56:25.760 --> 56:26.760]  I've extended them.
[56:26.760 --> 56:28.720]  I tend to do that a few days.

[56:30.880 --> 56:32.920]  20 people can use each membership.
[56:32.920 --> 56:33.920]  We've never done six months free.
[56:33.920 --> 56:34.920]  We're doing six months free.

[56:47.480 --> 56:49.280]  nascent iodine.

[56:55.160 --> 57:02.120]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[57:02.120 --> 57:06.080]  Check it out or give us a call 888-253-3139.
[57:06.080 --> 57:09.920]  David will be with me five minutes into the next hour, then Bob Barr comes on about impeachment
[57:09.920 --> 57:13.000]  more, the former congressman that actually did start the impeachment against William
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  Jefferson Clinton.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.880]  But this is just another sign that there's a battle in Hollywood that I've been told
[57:18.880 --> 57:23.240]  about for years behind the scenes but now is becoming very, very evident and we're telling
[57:23.240 --> 57:27.320]  folks in Hollywood show us which side you're on and we're really seeing it more and more,
[57:27.320 --> 57:28.320]  David Knight.
[57:28.320 --> 57:32.840]  Yeah, Alex, it's interesting in this movie, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama are not mentioned
[57:32.840 --> 57:33.840]  by name.
[57:33.840 --> 57:35.520]  This is not a polemic against them.
[57:35.520 --> 57:39.360]  What you see from this is, this is told from the perspective of the soldiers.
[57:39.360 --> 57:43.560]  The people who are serving a bureaucracy that doesn't have any clear mission, doesn't have
[57:43.560 --> 57:48.320]  any moral principles, has no regard for the people who serve it and it makes the point
[57:48.320 --> 57:51.960]  very clear that when you serve that kind of government, that kind of government will
[57:51.960 --> 57:55.920]  callously allow you to die and twist in the wind.
[57:55.920 --> 58:01.160]  The one thing I would change about this, if I was going to give them any direction on
[58:01.160 --> 58:06.200]  this, you see the timeline going and it's absolutely amazing to watch this unfold even
[58:06.200 --> 58:10.160]  though it's not in real time, you know, it's a couple of hours instead of the 13 hours.
[58:10.160 --> 58:14.080]  But I would have them count this up and say, this is our number this, this is our number
[58:14.080 --> 58:15.080]  this.
[58:15.080 --> 58:18.600]  They say at one point, a 20 minute delay is going to change this from a rescue mission
[58:18.600 --> 58:21.960]  into a suicide mission and that's very clear.
[58:21.960 --> 58:25.240]  Come back and tell us more about the film, spoiler alert straight ahead but obviously
[58:25.240 --> 58:29.360]  folks Benghazi, it's known what happened, they're talking to David, he's talking to
[58:29.360 --> 58:34.200]  Jakari, they say that it basically, they use the word stand down and point out that those
[58:34.200 --> 58:38.680]  above them have ordered a stand down and the CIA is really upset about it because the truth
[58:38.680 --> 58:39.680]  is coming out.
[58:39.680 --> 58:44.760]  This is a big deal folks, this really shows that they can't control everybody in Hollywood
[58:44.760 --> 58:48.760]  if folks start saying no.
[58:48.760 --> 58:52.760]  Over the years there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and
[58:52.760 --> 58:53.760]  nutraceuticals.

[59:51.400 --> 01:00:01.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:08.080]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:13.480]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:19.000]  Former Congressman Bob Barr is coming up to talk impeachment, the Constitution, TSA,
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.320]  behavior, government spying, internet freedom, he heads up Liberty Guard, he'll also open
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320]  the phones up.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:31.640]  David Knight, go ahead and give us a preview of what's coming up in the fourth hour when
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.360]  you spend 20 minutes or so on the new David Bay movie.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:41.560]  And I'm not knocking David Bay, but the Transformer movies are for kids and are pretty ridiculous.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.680]  Michael Bay, sorry, I can't be those names right, teleprompter free folks.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.880]  But you said that you thought it was pretty accurate from what we know, and we know the
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.000]  government is pretty upset about it.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.080]  Yeah, in terms of it being a film, I would recommend it to people.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.880]  If you like Black Hawk Down, this is that type of film.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.880]  Very well done.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.800]  And of course, Michael Bay's strong points are action.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.400]  And when you look at the reviews from audiences, people are giving it in the mid 80%.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.800]  If you look at Rotten Tomatoes, whereas critics don't like it.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:16.320]  Critics say, well, this is a too subtle a subject.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.320]  No, it's not.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.160]  It's not a subtle subject.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.800]  And what this boils down to, Alex, is whether or not there was a stand down order given,
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:30.400]  whether or not the CIA chief there in Benghazi withheld help from the ambassador, from the
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.400]  separate compound that was under attack, and then later they came under attack.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.280]  And when we see the back and forth of this, it was talked about in a variety on Friday.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.040]  The CIA says, well, this is not accurate.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.720]  However, Trey Gowdy, who was head of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said there's
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.400]  witnesses who said there was a stand down, and there are witnesses who said that there
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.400]  wasn't.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.600]  So you have to evaluate their credibility.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.240]  Now, the people who did the film, the people who did the book, came back and said, we have
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:03.160]  people who are named sources, people who were there, John Teagan, Chris Peranto.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.240]  They heard this CIA chief use the term stand down.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.080]  And the facts are that they were delayed for 20 minutes before they...
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.080]  Yes.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:18.080]  Headline on this interview confirmed Benghazi was a stand down.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.080]  Yes.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:25.440]  And look, obviously, 13 hours, 8 hours from the time the stand down comes out, that's
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:30.640]  8 hours of stand down with helicopters less than an hour away at giant military bases
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:36.960]  that are fore responding to this stuff in a major war zone with Italy only an hour away
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.840]  and so much more drones above.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.800]  That's why the military is so upset because thousands of people reportedly watched this
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.480]  unfold over 13 hours.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.480]  Yes.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.120]  And they made the point, they're begging just for some jets to fly by the jets were only
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.120]  20 minutes away.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.440]  They said, you don't have to strafe the area, just do a low fly by that will scare them
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.080]  off that will buy us some more time.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.080]  They would do nothing to help them.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.440]  And of course, against these people who were willing to come out put their names on the
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.280]  record people who were there.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.080]  You have an anonymous single source from the CIA who has a vested interest in saying there
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.080]  was no stand down.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.960]  Bob, Bob says there's no stand down.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960]  That was the quote.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.600]  A man identified as Bob.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.600]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.400]  And we don't even know if Bob is his first name.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.040]  How about a man identified as Pinocchio?
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.040]  Exactly.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:28.040]  So, you know, when you ask yourself does an anonymous CIA source who we don't even know
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.520]  if that's his real first name, Pinocchio, yeah, it says that against multiple witnesses
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.640]  who were there who will go on record with their name.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.120]  I think that's a lot more credible.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.920]  Of course, there was another reference in the film about the fact that at one point
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.840]  they said they're saying back home this is in response to protests.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.840]  Did you see any protests?
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.240]  They said there were no protests there.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.680]  Well, they put out a covert lie too that it's a response to sexual activities of the ambassador.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.120]  I mean, there's no end to the bull they're putting out on this.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.760]  Well, when we talk about this more in depth with Jakari in the fourth hour, we're going
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.680]  to talk about the articles that were coming out two days after Benghazi where Hillary
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:08.920]  is still pushing this absurd laughable ludicrous narrative that this is in response to that
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.520]  film that nobody saw, that nobody would take seriously the innocence of Muslims.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.160]  I remember they locked that guy up for a year.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.160]  In America.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.160]  In America.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.160]  Yeah, for doing a film.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:24.760]  I mean, that ought to tell people just what a master propagandist, what a master liar Hillary
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.920]  Clinton is.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.360]  Not only that, but just the cold-bloodedness of the entire bureaucracy as they were pulling
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.360]  out.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.600]  So they could get him out of there.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.800]  He wasn't supposed to put up that much of a fight.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.840]  That's why the rest of the staff had already been told to get out and evacuated to get those
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:46.240]  giant caches of weapons to the Turkish ambassador to Turkey to outfit their new Al-Qaeda al-Nusra
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.240]  ISIS brigade.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.520]  David Knight, we'll talk to you coming up in about two hours.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.040]  Great job with you and Jakari.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.040]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:58.840]  If you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:02.800]  Saudi Republicans are now seeing a two-man race between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.960]  RNC power brokers and donors now working to get on Trump's good side as they now see
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:11.240]  him as the eventual nominee, especially as his reputation expands throughout the Republican
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.520]  political class.
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.080]  Some of these donors include former Jeb Bush supporters who are now jumping ship as Bush
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.880]  begins to fade away in obscurity, but they're also courting Cruz, who they see as a stronger
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.960]  challenger to Trump, especially after the six GOP debate in which Cruz accused Trump
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.840]  of once having New York values.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.840]  As said, numerous people, including Trump himself, are questioning whether the Canadian-born
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.280]  Cruz meets the status as a natural-born citizen of the United States, which is one of the
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.080]  eligibility requirements established in the Constitution for election to the Office of
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.720]  President and Vice President.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.600]  The establishment was hoping Marco Rubio would overtake Cruz in the race, but Rubio's love
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:48.280]  affair with amnesty for illegal aliens makes him unelectable in the eyes of many Americans.

[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:07.940]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:25.940]  Alex, I was with some folks just recently, and I pulled out of a file in my office, the
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:33.940]  House Resolution, the House Resolution that I introduced on November 5th of 1997.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:40.940]  That was the very first official inquiry of impeachment filed against Bill Clinton, and
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:47.940]  that was mine, and at the time I think I had 18 co-sponsors was all in November of 1997.
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:56.940]  And what I did is I took that document, figuratively kind of dusted it off, added a little bit of language to it,
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:02.940]  and darned if it doesn't sound pretty good with Barack Obama's name in there.
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:09.940]  That was former Congressman Bob Barr last year, and he went on to say that if he was
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:17.940]  elected, re-elected to a new seat in Georgia, and he was way ahead in the polls then, that
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:22.940]  he would begin the process, because clearly the evidence is overwhelming.
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:26.940]  And people say, oh, well he's a lame duck, let's leave Obama alone.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:31.940]  You statutorily folks, and he's a constitutional lawyer, former CIA officer, you name it, but
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.940]  I don't have to be that to know, reading the law, that if someone's committing crimes,
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:39.940]  the government then has a job to investigate that.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:43.940]  He's also a former federal prosecutor.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:49.940]  And so we look at everything Obama's doing, even liberals like Jonathan Turley,
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:53.940]  constitutional lawyer, says he's done triple what Bush did.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:58.940]  And I know Congressman Barr was a critic of a lot of the stuff Bush did, but the nastiness,
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:04.940]  the way they're gutting the borders, bringing the illegals in, above the law, ordering the
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:10.940]  board patrol to finish the smuggling process, the way he, by executive action, coming after
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:15.940]  the Second Amendment, going after the power plants, not getting in trouble for the IRS
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:22.940]  persecutions, Nixon thought about it and was removed, had to step down.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:28.940]  Obama's doing it on mass scales that we grew up hearing about the Stasi in Eastern Europe,
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:31.940]  in Germany.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:38.940]  So it's so frustrating, and I want to get into, obviously he wants to,
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.940]  a few weeks ago I wanted to get him on, we finally got him, about the latest TSA, bringing
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:46.940]  back the naked body scanners for everybody, even though the law says you shouldn't do
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.940]  it to 18 years or younger.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.940]  I wanted to get him on because he heads up Liberty Guard, libertyguard.org, and of course
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:57.940]  Bob Barr.org, and I wanted to get him on about the executive actions, and I wanted to get
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:05.940]  him on about impeachment, but really it is a surreal point in this country to see things
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:11.940]  that if they were going on in, say, an African dictatorship, you'd be amazed by them.
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:16.940]  I mean, it makes these African dictators that get caught buying 100 Lamborghinis look like
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.940]  good guys.
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:22.940]  It makes corrupt Eastern European systems look tame, because when America does it, it does
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:25.940]  it on such a big scale, and here's what's crazy.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:29.940]  If you study criminology, you study history, you study trends, when something gets this
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:36.940]  corrupt, and it's the Republicans too, and it's the American people as well, it only
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:37.940]  gets worse.
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.940]  I mean, we've got basically really bad cancer.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:42.940]  We're going to go to our guests for the Balanced The Hour, take your phone calls, you name it,
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.940]  cover the waterfront, but it is a paradox.
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:49.940]  We've still got some of the best, hardest working, most moral people in the world.
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:55.940]  We're still world leaders, we're still innovators, but off our old inertia, but we also lead
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:59.940]  the world in crime, drug use, obesity, corruption.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:05.940]  I mean, we really, the bigger they are, the harder they fall, and I just wonder now that
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:11.940]  crimes are committed nakedly, that Nixon would have been crucified for and should have been,
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:15.940]  and I just wonder, what is next?
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:17.940]  What are they thinking?
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.940]  What are the Republican leaders doing?
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:23.940]  That's my filibuster, Congressman, bobbar.org.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.940]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:29.940]  I just wanted to set the table with that whole spinning constellation of weirdness.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.940]  There's also a lot of good things happening, obviously, but you've got the floor now to
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.940]  cover any topic you want or go with any of those points, sir.
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:41.940]  Well, thank you, Alex, always great to be with you and your many, many listeners and viewers
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:47.940]  all across the country, because you have it paged up precisely right, and that is, we
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:52.940]  remain, as everybody knows, the world's greatest power, the greatest nation on the face of
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:59.940]  the earth, but the problem is we have strayed so far from our foundations that not just
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:05.940]  our founding fathers would not recognize this country today, but even if 100 years ago
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:12.940]  or 150 years ago when America was first becoming a world power, our leaders then would not
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:15.940]  recognize how far we've strayed.
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:20.940]  I was just last week, Alex, up in New Hampshire with Senator Cruz, whom I'm working for as
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:25.940]  a volunteer in support of his candidacy and his campaign, and the people that we met up
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:30.940]  there, we had a second amendment rally out in the cold, but we had a huge crowd, and
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.940]  then we had a huge town hall meeting.
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:39.940]  I mean, New Hampshire, Iowa, Georgia, my home state, all across this land, you find communities
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:46.940]  of hardworking, honest people who simply want to be left alone to pursue their dreams and
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:53.940]  to be free to do what they want in pursuit of their happiness, and yet our leaders in
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:59.940]  Washington, so many of them have become fixated on this and enmeshed in this cronyism and
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:02.940]  executive power, that's the problem.
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:05.940]  We have to change the leaders in Washington.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:09.940]  That's why this election is so vital and why it's so important for you to continue to be
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:13.940]  out there raising the alarm.
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:19.940]  Getting into Obama's power grabs, I mean, they have the desperate criminal energy is what
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:24.940]  I would describe it, that I've only seen in the Bolsheviks or the Nazis, and I know that
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:31.940]  those terms get overused and describe corrupt politicians, but there is an avarice and a
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.940]  driving force in these people.
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:37.940]  Is it because they know the world's waking up to them?
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.940]  Is it because they know their time is short or is it because they're confident?
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:48.940]  It's primarily because they're arrogant and they simply do not wish to and will not abide
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:53.940]  by the rule of law, and our court system and our leadership in the Congress basically
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.940]  has been asleep at the switch, continues to be.
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:15:05.940]  I mean, for example, you take the latest TSA goings on, you mentioned, there was a court
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:13.940]  order by a federal court five over five years ago that required TSA if it wished to continue
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:20.940]  to use these naked body scanners to put forward and open themselves up to public comment so
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:23.940]  that we could at least see what they're doing.
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:29.940]  We filed way back when a Freedom of Information Act, they refused to give us any information.
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:33.940]  We filed another letter along with other privacy-oriented organizations.
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:39.940]  We had Liberty Guard to force them to do what the law requires them, but this administration
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:46.940]  is so arrogant, they have a court order that requires TSA to go to the American people,
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:51.940]  tell us what they're proposing, solicit comments, and then do it the right way.
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:53.940]  They simply refuse to do that.
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:59.940]  They ought to be held at a minimum in contempt of court, and yet Congress sits back and has done
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:00.940]  nothing so far, Alex.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.940]  That's the problem.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:08.940]  Before we get into Obama's power grab, the executive actions, how you think we should respond,
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:14.940]  we learned from inside the RNC that they had a vote, only four people voted to have a resolution
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:17.940]  calling for the beginning of impeachment investigations.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:22.940]  I mean, if they don't even do the investigations, when they could score points for Liberty by
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:28.940]  exposing the crimes, maybe scare these crooks into not being so aggressive, run the wolves
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:33.940]  off, at least wave a flaming torch around a little bit around the campfire, they won't
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:34.940]  even do that.
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.940]  They're just letting them do whatever they want.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:39.940]  I want to speak to that.
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:42.940]  But first, talking about Ted Cruz, I love Ted Cruz.
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:46.940]  I mean, I think he's obviously the guy that has the best voting record right now.
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:49.940]  He's actually doing what he says he'll do.
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:54.940]  Trump has the people behind him, and I know he's changed some, and I want to believe that
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:55.940]  he's who he says he is.
[01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:59.940]  I know those two were getting along for a while now because they're the two leaders, the only
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.940]  person challenging Trump early, I think, not Rubio, correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:09.940]  I just hate to see them start tearing each other up because, you know, obviously anything's
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.940]  better in my view than Hillary or Bernie Sanders.
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:15.940]  What's your view on that, and why are you supporting Ted Cruz?
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:21.940]  I'm supporting Ted Cruz, Alex, because far and above better than any of the other Republican
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:26.940]  candidates, and we have a very strong feel, particularly as compared to the Democrat
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:30.940]  field, which is very, very weak and shallow.
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:35.940]  We have a very strong feel, almost too many really good people in there running this time,
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:42.940]  but alone among all of those candidates, Ted Cruz understands the importance of protecting
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:48.940]  individual liberty in all that government does, and that includes this notion of the most
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.940]  important duty of government being able, being, keeping us safe.
[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:53.940]  Well, that's not quite true.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:58.940]  The most important function, the most important responsibility of government is to protect
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:17:59.940]  liberty.
[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:00.940]  Ted Cruz gets that.
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:04.940]  A lot of the other candidates, while they may be good on second amendment issues, they
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:10.940]  may be good on this side or the other thing, they miss that fundamental principle that,
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.940]  above all else, is the responsibility of the federal government under our constitutional
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.940]  republic to protect liberty.
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:22.940]  He does that, he understands it, and he alone has been fighting for that in the Senate.
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.940]  That's what impresses me about Ted Cruz.
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:27.940]  I think Alex, more than anything else.
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:31.940]  Can you imagine how he would mop the floor with Hillary Clinton in a debate?
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:32.940]  I'd love it.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:37.940]  Man, that would be worth paying a high price for a ticket to watch that debate.
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:42.940]  Speaking about politics, because it's interesting, you were so ahead in the polls, another establishment
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.940]  came against you.
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.940]  How did you lose your run for the House again?
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:53.940]  Well, it was an odd election year from that standpoint, and we're still seeing a little bit of that
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:56.940]  this cycle with the presidential race, Alex.
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:02.940]  For example, I'd served in the House for eight years, as you recall, and it is standard operating
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:07.940]  procedure in the House, and I think pretty much the same in the Senate that if a member
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:13.940]  leaves the House and then comes back in a subsequent election, they regain their seniority,
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.940]  just standard operating procedure.
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:21.940]  Yet the mere fact that I had served in the House previously and would get my seniority
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:27.940]  back was somehow in that weird election year last time in 2014, turned against me.
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:35.940]  And my opponent, who eventually won the seat, painted me as a part of the Republican establishment
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.940]  of all things.
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:39.940]  I mean, I was never part of the Republican establishment.
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:40.940]  Exactly.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:43.940]  So we've got all these baby patriots, baby libertarians, conservatives, just now getting
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:48.940]  involved, and so someone who's never been in Congress can say, look, he was in Congress.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:53.940]  Don't go with an insider, let's kind of have term limits on Bob Barr, which is just, I
[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:56.940]  mean, you were anything but establishment.
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:00.940]  Well, that's right, but we continue to fight.
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:05.940]  I continue to fight just like you continue to fight for the Constitution, for individual
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:07.940]  liberty, and against the establishment.
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:11.940]  Because the establishment is full of crony capitalists.
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:16.940]  And some of the other candidates, Donald Trump, for example, I mean, he proudly says,
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:18.940]  basically, I'm a crony capitalist.
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:22.940]  I pay money to whoever is in office so I can get favors from them.
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:28.940]  As long as we have people like that in public office who do not have the public good in
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:32.940]  mind at the front and center, we're going to continue to have these problems.
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:36.940]  You know, a lot of that, I think, is Trump putting out red meat.
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:40.940]  But when he does say things like, oh, don't worry, we'll just surveil so much.
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:42.940]  They'll never attack us next time.
[01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:44.940]  We have the foreign intelligence.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:45.940]  There's too much intelligence.
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:47.940]  They spy on everything.
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:50.940]  That's why they can't find the needle in the haystack, according to all the experts.
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:51.940]  It is.
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:53.940]  And it's about to get worse.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:21:00.940]  Alex, as you know, the Congress has slipped into the omnibus spending bill, always, always dangerous.
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:04.940]  Anything that has the word omnibus in front of it, be very, very careful.
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:09.940]  But they passed that omnibus spending bill right at the end of December, right before Christmas,
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:11.940]  as a matter of fact.
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:16.940]  And it included a provision that was not debated.
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:18.940]  It was just slipped in there at the last minute.
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:24.940]  The Cyber Intelligence Security Act that is going to make it even worse in terms of the
[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:29.940]  amount of information that the government can scoop up and that it can get from private
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:37.940]  companies and they'll have immunity from prosecution or from lawsuits for violating our privacy.
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:42.940]  All of this new information will be now made available to the government.
[01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:46.940]  And they can't, they don't even know what to do with all the information that they have right now,
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:51.940]  aside from the fact that it is an invasion of privacy.
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:57.940]  Before we get into the executive power grab and where you see Obama going his last 11 months at
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:02.940]  office, if he's not checked, at least with an investigation, in your long history as a federal
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:08.940]  prosecutor and of course working in major administrations and being in Congress and seeing
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:14.940]  everything that you've seen, obviously I'm not going to sit here and defend the CIA because
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.940]  it's been given a lot of unconstitutional dirty missions.
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:22.940]  But if we just sit there and blame the best known agency and not the other 15 intelligence
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:25.940]  agencies, people really lose the forest for the trees.
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:29.940]  But there are a lot of patriotic people in all these agencies who put out information,
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:35.940]  exposed corruption, blow the whistle, look at the CIA guys that died in Benghazi.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.940]  And of course the stand down order there.
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:43.940]  But as a culture, when you go back to Washington, when you talk to other insiders,
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:49.940]  I'm seeing actually a lot of military, a lot of people in intelligence saying what's happening is wrong.
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:54.940]  The former head of defense intelligence, as you know, the general went public two months ago and said,
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:23:00.940]  no, Obama ordered us to fund al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, and then ISIS directly on purpose and it's wrong.
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:06.940]  We see the head of Southcom coming out a few weeks ago and saying, putting women in frontline combat will ruin the military.
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.940]  It's terrible, but I'll follow the order.
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:14.940]  People I don't think get, this is really rebellion level, but it's not mutiny.
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:20.940]  It's people standing up for the Constitution against a president who is at mutiny with the country.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:26.940]  And I mean, there's not strong enough words, but are you aware of this major battle now
[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:32.940]  that's coming out in the open inside the system itself instead of the American people being played off by Soros on the left
[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:38.940]  just to have a big anti-government war with the police and the military and the CIA like it's all our enemy?
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:41.940]  I think we should understand that actually some of the best people are in there.
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:47.940]  They're actually more awake on average than the general public and they need public support out here on the front lines
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:52.940]  to be able to do what they do to try to save this country because I've been aware of this for a long time,
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:56.940]  but I've met with groups of prominent special forces people.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:59.940]  A lot of them have come on the show like Tim Kennedy last week and others.
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:02.940]  And I mean, they say massive awakening.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:03.940]  I talked to others.
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:06.940]  I mean, it's just, I don't mean to be kind of ranting here.
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:12.940]  It's just, I don't think people understand there is a giant counterrevolution basically going on behind the scenes.
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:17.940]  Even if this election doesn't work, it's an incredible time to be alive right now.
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:21.940]  I'm glad you mentioned that because despite all of the problems,
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:26.940]  despite the massive bureaucracies we're dealing with in the area of intelligence,
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:32.940]  part of the problem is we have way too much bureaucracy and both the prior Bush administration
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:37.940]  and this administration has continued to fund and expand this huge bureaucracy.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:38.940]  That's part of the problem.
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.940]  Who do we, the people, fight?
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:42.940]  Where exactly is the problem?
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.940]  You know, you go after one agency, one provision,
[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:48.940]  then you find out another agency is doing the same thing,
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:51.940]  but has power over the first agency.
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:57.940]  It used to be that the CIA was formed to provide a single focus point
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:03.940]  for all foreign intelligence analysis and operations coming to the president of the United States.
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.940]  Well, never worked that way because president after president,
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:11.940]  Republican and Democrat wouldn't stand up to the bureaucracy over the Pentagon
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.940]  and really back the CIA.
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:17.940]  Now it's far worse because we have something called the DNI,
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:19.940]  the director of national intelligence.
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:23.940]  So trying to put your finger on exactly what the problem is
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:27.940]  so that we can hold the government accountable has become extremely difficult
[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:30.940]  and to be honest with you, the oversight function,
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:34.940]  the oversight responsibility of the Congress, particularly the House,
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.940]  they have fallen flat on their faces.
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:38.940]  They have some good people.
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:42.940]  Jay Fitz, who heads the House Oversight Committee, is good.
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:44.940]  He's aggressive. He's smart.
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:47.940]  Yet the leadership is not seen fit to give him the power
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:52.940]  that he really needs to get to the bottom of these investigations.
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.940]  What's the inside baseball on Benghazi?
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:58.940]  I mean, I know my perspective on it and my access,
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:00.940]  which has been proven to be pretty accurate,
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:03.940]  but overall with what Obama is really trying to do,
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:07.940]  because I didn't buy this stuff seven years ago from the super far right.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:09.940]  I'm more of a libertarian that Obama is a secret Muslim.
[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:11.940]  He wants to destroy America.
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:13.940]  But I mean, you look at Obamacare, you look at the open borders,
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:15.940]  you look at the Cloward and Pivot strategy,
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:17.940]  you look at him financing the Muslim Brotherhood,
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:21.940]  you look at him with his cousin Odinga and Kenya and the radicals,
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:24.940]  you look at what he's doing in ISIS.
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:30.940]  I mean, he really is a destabilization campaign that doesn't even help America.
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:33.940]  I'd be against any moral destabilization campaign
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:35.940]  because I want us to have the moral high ground.
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:38.940]  But what about a destabilization campaign that also hurts us?
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:41.940]  I mean, they're doing things that only hurt us
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:43.940]  and they're doing it too well.
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:45.940]  It can't just be ineptitude.
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:48.940]  I think you're precisely on point.
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:50.940]  You just took the words right out of my mouth.
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.940]  The fact of the matter is one could be charitable
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:57.940]  if these were isolated incidents to claim that,
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.940]  well, this administration just doesn't understand the Middle East.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.940]  They don't understand the nature of the enemy.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:05.940]  They don't understand what governments are doing
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:08.940]  over in a part of the world far, far away.
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:13.940]  But the fact of the matter is it's been going on far too long.
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:17.940]  We see it in virtually every foreign policy arena
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.940]  in which our government has been operating
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:22.940]  and has to operate under this administration.
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:25.940]  It's far more important, far beyond simple ineptitude.
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.940]  They have an agenda.
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:31.940]  This administration has an agenda to reign America in,
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:34.940]  to make it no more powerful than other nations,
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:38.940]  the European Union, for example, to put America in its place.
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.940]  This administration wants to put America in its place,
[01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:43.940]  which is not at the point of the spear,
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:45.940]  not at the top of the heap,
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:49.940]  but right there sort of in the middle along with everyone else.
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:51.940]  I mean, it's a very insidious agenda
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:53.940]  and it goes far beyond incompetence.
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:55.940]  Isn't there a name of that?
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:57.940]  I mean, if he wants to go work for China
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.940]  or somebody else and try to put America in its place,
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:01.940]  he could do that.
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:02.940]  But when you do that as the president,
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:04.940]  isn't that treason or sedition
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:07.940]  or subterfuge undermining the country?
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:10.940]  I mean, isn't that what a foreign enemy would do?
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:13.940]  It certainly is what those who would do us harm
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:15.940]  would like to see happen.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:17.940]  And one could certainly put together a case
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:21.940]  that what Obama is doing and has done
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:25.940]  would be a classic example of how a foreign power,
[01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:29.940]  a foreign puppeteer would be controlling
[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:31.940]  what's going on in this country.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:35.940]  But we're never going to get to the bottom of it, really,
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.940]  unless Congress does its job.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:39.940]  This notion, as you mentioned at the beginning,
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.940]  that people are afraid or unwilling
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.940]  to utter the word impeachment
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:47.940]  because, well, after all, Obama's a lame duck,
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.940]  don't understand the problem
[01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:51.940]  and just don't have the guts of the background
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:53.940]  to tackle the problem.
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:55.940]  It doesn't matter whether a president is a lame duck
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:57.940]  or in the first day of his first term.
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:01.940]  If he or she commits unconstitutional, unlawful acts,
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:03.940]  as this president has done,
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:06.940]  then Congress needs to inquire into it to hold it down.
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:07.940]  That's right.
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:09.940]  And that's why the Republican establishment
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:12.940]  didn't want you in and kept you out of Congress
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:14.940]  by playing the Tea Party.
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:15.940]  Tea Party's great.
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:16.940]  They can be played both ways.
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:17.940]  Folks that would be more sophisticated.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.940]  When we come back, I want to get into impeachment.
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:22.940]  Obama's power grab, what you think we should do.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:23.940]  I want to get into Liberty Guard.
[01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:25.940]  I want to get into the other work you're doing,
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:28.940]  trying to block all these cybersecurity power grabs.
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:31.940]  Bob Barr, Bob Barr.org is our guest.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:33.940]  LibertyGuard.org.
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:35.940]  Your questions or comments for Bob Barr,
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:42.940]  as well, 800-25-99-231-800-2599-231.
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:47.940]  Stay with us. We'll be back.
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:48.940]  We're on the march.
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.940]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:30:19.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:30.940]  The U.S.
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:32.940]  benchmark oil prices have collapsed more than 70%
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.940]  in the past 18 months and fell below $30 a barrel
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:36.940]  for the first time in 12 years last week.
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.940]  West Texas Intermediate was already trading
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.940]  near $29 in New York on Monday.
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:42.940]  This will lead to the collapse in major oil companies
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:44.940]  and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs,
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:45.940]  meaning the economic compression is likely.
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:46.940]  In other words,
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.940]  the global oversupply of oil has now reached the point
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:52.700]  effectively forcing producers to pay them to give their oil away. Otherwise, the oil will simply
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:56.700]  sit in bloated storage facilities or on tankers parked out in the ocean. This is Kit Daniels

[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:38.140]  Your phone calls are coming up, Eric, Dwayne, Damien, Liberty, Luke and others for Bob Barr.
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:47.820]  He's Liberty Guard, libertyguard.org. There is a process in corruption throughout history where
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:53.500]  basically a population becoming broke back and where people just give in and then that's why
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:58.700]  you see most of these third world countries that have resources are still in such hellish squalor
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:07.420]  because they have cultures based on conquest and on strongmen, el-hefes, not on innovation,
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:12.220]  not on trailblazing. And obviously there's always a mix of those two type systems at any
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:17.420]  civilization. But when you start getting 10, 20, 30 percent conquest in your innovation,
[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:21.740]  it will always like cancer takeover the rest. We're going back to our guest in a moment to
[01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:29.980]  discuss how we fight back against this because believe me, Obama only accelerates the same
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:35.980]  things happening in Europe, the socialist consolidation, the power grabbing. And they're
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:41.580]  never met with any opposition that's sustained or widespread so they just keep growing.
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:48.380]  And then Republicans get elected and they go up there and basically get absorbed into all this.
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:53.020]  It's the same thing in Europe, folks. It is looking like the type of stuff we saw in the
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:56.860]  30s and 40s. I mean, we're really going into a very nasty time in the climate,
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:01.420]  politically. And a lot of elites, the Pentagon, Ministry of Defense, others admit that the French
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:07.580]  Socialists has declared an economic emergency. What does he think 90 and plus percent taxes
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:13.340]  are going to do? A hundred and one percent on some groups. So that's all coming up as well
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:19.740]  with Bob Barr, BobBarr.org as well, a lot of excellent stuff on his site. Folks, there are a
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:26.380]  lot of bad halogens, bromide, bromine, chlorine, fluoride in the water. I mean, even again, Harvard
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:31.260]  admits high levels of fluoride is really bad for you. It fills up your glands, it really hurts you.
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:35.580]  Then you can't find the good halogen. What is it? Well, it's iodine. They used to put it in the salt.
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:40.540]  You can pull up mainstream news articles, you know, 15 percent IQ increase after a decade in
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:46.220]  the Midwest after they started putting iodine in the salt. But that was the cheap base iodine that
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:51.820]  didn't even break down very well. We have, they've been taking an out since the 70s, we have the good
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:58.220]  deep earth source iodine. It turns blue on paper, not red. Iodine is not red, folks. When it breaks
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:02.780]  down, it's blue. That's what the real crystal looks like. Take a couple of drops of this in your
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:07.020]  water to consult your physician first, but it has just been life changing for me. You can read the
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:14.540]  rave reviews from third party sites at infoarstore.com, infoar'slife.com. We have it with colloidal silver,
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:20.620]  a great topical or internal, you know, obviously anti-antibacterial and viral. Silver bullet,
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:26.220]  colloidal silver, 30 parts per million were less than the stuff they sell at Whole Foods that's
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:30.300]  from the same manufacturer. Just to let you know, we private label it. So it's really high quality.
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:36.940]  That is half off, right now it's regular price. So it's $9.95 when you get it with the
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:44.380]  X2 deep earth crystal based, purest iodine you can find anywhere. It is the purest
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:49.260]  anyone has ever come up with. It actually comes in a gaseous form that has been injected
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:55.900]  into the organic palm oil base. That's a special that will end today. It will be gone tomorrow.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:37:05.660]  infoarstore.com, infoar'slife.com or call 888-253-3139. And then separately we have a new shower
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:12.300]  filter in that has the best testing background ever by Pro Pure, the Pro Max. And it's got a
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:17.340]  four stage filter, really fast flow as well. I like it. Cuts out hundreds of different chemicals
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:23.100]  and pathogens. Others it reduces down to 99% and it just came out. People love it.
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:30.940]  infoarstore.com, the Pro Pure Pro Max, 10% off promo code water. So much of the toxins in the water
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:35.420]  you absorb through your skin and your lungs. This is a really important way to protect yourself and
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:39.660]  your family. And it makes your hair obviously a lot cleaner on having all the chlorine, all the
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:43.020]  great, you know, great to have chlorine and it kills bacteria. The problem is then you're drinking
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:48.300]  it too. It kills bacteria, you're drinking it. Not a good idea. Do goldfish live in the tap water?
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:56.300]  No, they die. Joe Perry, the rock star, sent me a text message about his goldfish. They put them
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:38:00.780]  in the tap water there in Florida and they died. You know, not thinking. That's just an example.
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:06.220]  So infoarstore.com. And folks make fun of us saying, you know, watch out with the tap water.
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:10.140]  Some cities have great tap water. Most places don't. Like Houston tap water, you can almost
[01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:15.260]  light on fire. Okay. Dallas tap water, I grew up drinking horrible. They have all these PR
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:18.940]  pieces about it. They say, oh, conspiracy theorists say it's bad for you. Folks, the life of states,
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:23.500]  all of it has come out. You're nuts if you're not filtering your water. Okay, I'm done ranting
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:28.380]  about that. Going back to Bob Barser, before we go to calls, you've got the floor here to break down
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:34.380]  your concerns. I know you've written about it. You know, as a constitutional lawyer, as a congressman,
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:39.820]  as a former prosecutor, federal prosecutor, what are we seeing with these executive orders?
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:44.860]  What should be done? What's the proper path for citizens? You know, A, what are Obama's crimes
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:49.580]  against the Constitution that warrant it? And then B, what do we do lobbying-wise as citizen
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:56.460]  activists to try to get the RNC to take action, to try to get Congress to take action? What do we do?
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:04.140]  I'm not sure that the RNC any more than the DNC will actually do anything. It's important to go
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:10.220]  directly to the members of Congress and the court system. I mean, we have three branches of government.
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:16.860]  We have a president and executive branch right now that believes and who believes that he is above
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:25.100]  the law and has put in the position of the attorney general and enabler who, woman now,
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:32.700]  similar to what her predecessor Eric Holder did, basically to tell the president why you can continue
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:39.260]  to operate without the consent of Congress and violation of what Congress and the laws are
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:45.580]  rather than an attorney general that does their best to keep the president operating within
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:49.980]  the bounds of the law. So we're not going to get any help from the Department of Justice,
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:56.380]  obviously. So that leaves us with the Congress, which for many, many years has simply forgotten
[01:39:56.380 --> 01:40:03.660]  or deliberately abrogated its oversight responsibility and the courts. So what the citizens need to do,
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:09.180]  one is to identify candidates for the House, the Senate, and the president who actually have the
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:14.700]  courage and the understanding to stand up for the Constitution and will fight. Going back to
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:21.580]  your earlier question, the reason why I support Ted Cruz in this election year. But we also need
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:28.860]  to make sure that Congress reacquaints itself with its oversight responsibility. It is simply
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:36.700]  not doing that. Plus the fact, Alex, as you know very well, when I filed back in 1997 in November
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:42.300]  of 1997, the very first inquiry of impeachment, it's different from an article of impeachment.
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:47.900]  It's the first step that Congress should take and needs to take to determine whether or not
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:53.020]  there are legitimate grounds for an impeachment. I think there are a lot of people think that
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:58.620]  there are, but I'm not calling on the Congress to jump ahead and do something that is
[01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:05.100]  in call for that the evidence isn't there, but simply to inquire into whether or not this president
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:12.140]  in, for example, directing the Department of Justice to ignore and the Department of the
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:19.500]  Homeland Security to simply ignore the laws on immigration and to enforce the laws that are on
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:26.380]  the books. That in fact is not acting within the Constitution. The president is deliberately
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:33.100]  subverting the laws of this land. It's not that he simply has decided, well, in this particular case,
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:38.380]  I'm not going to have my attorney general prosecute a case. That's fine. That's prosecutorial
[01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:43.580]  discretion. But for president to deliberately say, we're not going to enforce the laws, we're going
[01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:49.180]  to operate contrary to the laws that Congress has passed in immigration. And I think we're going to see
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:54.540]  the same thing very shortly with regard to his executive actions, with regard to firearms.
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:42:00.060]  Congress has to step in because a lot of times if citizens just file action in the courts,
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:05.580]  the courts will say, well, you don't have standing. The issue isn't ripe or whatnot.
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:10.380]  We ought to continue to press these issues in court, but we need to demand that the Congress,
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:15.740]  particularly the House, stand up for its oversight responsibility. That's right. And we also have
[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:20.620]  clips of him saying, hey, don't worry, Congress wouldn't act. So I changed the law. That's a
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:26.060]  close quote. I mean, he said, Congress didn't act. So I changed the law. Then a week and a half ago,
[01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:32.780]  he said in his speech before press Congress, he said, Congress hasn't gotten in line on gun
[01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:39.980]  control. So I'm taking action. I mean, this is very Napoleonic. It is extremely Hitlerian. I'm
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:47.020]  sorry. That's what it is. It is furious to have him doing this, have him saying this. It's surreal.
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:50.700]  It'd be one thing if he did it and claimed it was constitutional and he could do it because it,
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:55.100]  you know, was rulemaking or whatever. He doesn't. He just says, they're not in line. I'm doing this.
[01:42:55.660 --> 01:43:02.380]  And I changed the law. And then we have airplanes coming in every day. And occasionally it's in
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:08.140]  the news where 150 people land from Mexico, no IDs. And they say, don't even check them at customs.
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:13.420]  Just let them in. But then citizens, they're going to grow part genitals and put, you know,
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:20.620]  10-year-old girls and naked body scanners. It's just, it's so transparent that it just teaches
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:26.860]  to be slaves, to set up a federal bureaucracy, to create internal checkpoints, to have the IRS say
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:33.100]  you can't fly outside of law if they feel like it, that they are affecting and activating a naked
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:40.620]  tyranny while engaging in flagrant disregard of constitutional duties of the government. So
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:45.020]  that's why I really wanted to get you in last year because you said then on the show, we have the
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:48.300]  clubs that you believe there were impeachable offenses and that you were going to bring that
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:53.020]  forward. What does it take for one man or woman in Congress to do what you've done before?
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:44:00.060]  It takes guts. It takes simply standing up and filing a piece of paper called an
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:05.980]  inquiry of impeachment. I did that on November 5th of 1997. I remember the day very well.
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:11.020]  Didn't have a lot of folks that were supportive, as I mentioned to you earlier on your show.
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:14.940]  But it got the talk going and then impeachment came out again, though. I mean, you got the ball
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:20.380]  rolling. We got the ball rolling. And as you recall also, Alex, it had nothing to do with
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:25.740]  Monica Lewinsky. Now, what eventually wound up being the grounds for the impeachment of William
[01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:32.140]  Jefferson Clinton were legitimate, that perjuring obstruction of justice. But when I first filed
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:38.940]  the inquiry of impeachment in 1997, none of us had heard of Monica Lewinsky or Paula Jones or
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:45.020]  any of that. But we were very concerned. I was very concerned. And the 17 other members of the
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:51.340]  House that signed on to that original inquiry of impeachment, including Rest His Soul, Sonny Bono,
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:57.820]  and initially, we were concerned about real direct violations of the law, the selling of
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:04.540]  national security information to these communist Chinese communist Chinese money coming directly
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:09.580]  into the White House, the subversion of our law campaign finance missile secrets getting
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:13.340]  transferred. And for those that don't know, I want to bring this up. That's why you were such a hero
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:17.900]  there. You brought up stuff the Republican establishment didn't want because they were
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:22.860]  involved in it. And later, the prosecutor, you know, obviously, on the next case connected into
[01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:27.020]  it because you're obviously indicted in the House, tried the Senate, you were bringing up stuff that
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:32.460]  would bring down the whole corrupt system. They wanted it to be the sex case and the perjury case
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:37.100]  because it isolated it down directly to only them. I mean, I know that because you told me
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:42.780]  that at the time it also came out in the newsletter. That is a correct recitation of history.
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:48.700]  Many of the issues that I and, for example, Dan Burton, who was chair of the House Oversight
[01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:55.500]  Committee at the time, were trying to go into was to really get to the bottom of this cronyism,
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:46:01.340]  particularly involving foreign money that was coming in. And the leadership just would have
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:07.420]  nothing to do with it in large measure, in my view, because it hit a little bit too close to home.
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:12.540]  There were members of the Republican Party that were taking money from some of these foreign
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:19.500]  sources as well. Sir, is it this how countries finally do get taken over in outside soft espionage
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:23.580]  that they just start taking money? Nobody else wants to report on it because they're taking money
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:27.900]  and pretty soon you're totally bought off the Saudi Arabians or the Chinese Communists. Tell
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:31.340]  you what movies to produce. Tell you what Congress people you're going to have. I mean,
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:35.420]  aren't we pretty much already getting to that point where we've been taken over by multinationals
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:41.180]  in foreign countries? We're moving down that road very, very quickly, Alex. And to compound the
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:47.180]  problem, we have a president who is so arrogant, as you mentioned, unlike Nixon, who was corrupt in
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:52.940]  his own way, but did it behind the scenes. This president is so arrogant, he goes out there and
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:57.740]  says, I'm going to act extra constitutionally. Congress isn't doing something so I'm going to.
[01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:07.820]  And the perfect storm here is that we have a citizenry that by and large has become ignorant
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:13.660]  and unknowing about the proper constitutional standard and how our system operates. So you have
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:18.300]  a president that is supremely arrogant, you have a Congress that is some nebulant,
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:24.700]  and you have a citizenry that is largely ignorant of its responsibility as the citizenry
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:30.300]  to take action against the president. It's a very, very bad, very toxic combination we have here.
[01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:38.220]  And exactly. And now, I mean, like Hillary and the State Department openly getting money from
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:43.660]  dictatorships to then bypass Congress and say, oh, you have a special letter, you can have these
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:49.020]  weapons or we're taking these sanctions off and then billions of dollars flow in. It's completely
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:54.780]  naked. She's worse than Al Capone. And then now if she doesn't get in trouble, what happens next?
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:48:00.780]  I mean, do you think Hillary can survive new emails coming out that she did lie about just
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:06.380]  knowing her servers were hacked? I mean, it's just incredible. It is, unfortunately,
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:11.020]  when you look at the lay of the land politically, particularly with our electoral college system
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:17.580]  that we have, Hillary Clinton, whoever the nominee is going to be, and I think it's very,
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:25.420]  very likely to be Hillary Clinton, unfortunately, that candidate starts out with a huge electoral
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:31.180]  college advantage because of the way the states have lined up, for example, California, New York,
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:35.980]  and so forth. Could this country survive Hillary Clinton? I mean, I really think she's such a
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:39.980]  psychopath that if she gets in control, it's, I mean, I don't know what she's going to do.
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:42.700]  She probably says she wants to go after our free speech. I mean, you name it.
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:46.780]  She's going to destroy America as we know it, Alex. No doubt about it.
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:52.620]  These people are just, they've already run the country. Why do they want to fundamentally
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:55.900]  break it? Why do they want to make us like Venezuela? I just don't get it.
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:02.540]  They're in a different universe. It's very, very difficult to understand as American citizens who
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:07.420]  read as you have done, read our history, understand it, understand the Constitution.
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:13.420]  It makes no sense. But unfortunately, there are far more people out there who are ignorant of what
[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:18.780]  you understand and I understand in history of this country than there are that understand it.
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:24.860]  That's why it's so hard to fight this, but we have to. Absolutely. I want to go to some phone calls
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:29.500]  here. We're about to go to break. Let's get one in right now. Let's talk to Eric in West Virginia.
[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:32.940]  You're on the air with former Congress from Bob Barr of Liberty Guard. Go ahead, Eric.
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:42.700]  Hi, Bob. Hi, Alex. Okay, so this is just based on an observation. I wonder if you agree. I've seen
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:47.180]  a lot of videos and seen a lot of stories of people that have, you know, exercised their second
[01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:52.540]  and a right. For example, one place out in Washington, I think it was where it was a national
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:58.460]  park and they had just turned it into a gun-free zone and the people rose up and they showed up
[01:49:58.460 --> 01:50:04.620]  in about 300 at a town hall meeting. Everybody fully armed and they managed to get that up overturned
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:09.820]  overnight, literally. And then another case down in Texas recently where people were, you know,
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:13.580]  people were getting arrested for feeding the homeless, people show up fully armed and
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.940]  So you're saying what about civil disobedience?
[01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:25.020]  Yes, civil disobedience. Do you think that it would be reasonable to actually exercise a second
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:30.780]  amendment peacefully in all town hall meetings? Well, here's the problem. They're going to start
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:35.260]  sending infiltrators in. They already are doing it. So then it'll work a few times and then it blows
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:40.700]  up in your face. But we're going to get Bob Barr's take on that on the other side. But I mean,
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:45.100]  look, I went down with Jerry Patterson, the land commissioner, first speech politically at the
[01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:50.300]  Alamos since the Daughters Republic of Texas controlled it. And we marched 1,500 people with
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:55.020]  loaded guns in San Antonio because they said that was illegal, but the state law said it wasn't.
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:59.980]  And then their local law got overturned. But I did it with a state leader. My dad was 59 when he
[01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:04.220]  collapsed from a heart attack late last year. Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on
[01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:09.100]  the St. Croix River. I loved my dad. But boy was he stubborn. He hadn't been to the doctor in over
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:14.700]  25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it. He wasn't a rich man by any means. At less than
[01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:19.980]  $107 per month, libertyoncall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:24.700]  Don't wait. Go to libertyoncall.org right now for not just your sake,
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:28.700]  but for the sake of your loved ones. Again, that's libertyoncall.org.

[01:53:48.700 --> 01:54:17.020]  Since I mentioned Obama talking about changing the law with his executive order on immigration,
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:21.980]  I thought I would just go ahead and play the clip here it is. You're absolutely right that there
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:31.740]  have been significant numbers of deportations. That's true, but what you're not paying attention to
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:41.100]  is the fact that I just took an action to change the law. Now, that's enough and it goes on from
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:47.660]  there. But getting back to another point, under the Declaration of Independence, we do have a right
[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:53.100]  to defend ourselves when tyranny becomes overwhelming. At the same time, though, we're
[01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:58.140]  winning the Info War. A lot of bad stuff's happening, but people all over the world are waking up.
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:05.100]  We have to be very, very smart about when we do provocative things. That's all I'm saying.
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:11.100]  I'm not judging anybody. I'm just saying the system is trying to prod us into physical action.
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:17.180]  I don't know what Bob Mars take is on this, sir. There are a lot of organizations out there.
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:22.060]  I'm involved in a law enforcement education organization, the Law Enforcement Education
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:26.940]  Foundation. We have, of course, as you've already mentioned, Liberty Guard. Citizens need to be
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:34.540]  very careful how they do exercise their rights because it's so easy to run afoul of some local
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:40.300]  regulation or state law and you wind up in jail and then you're on the defensive and have to spend
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:46.540]  a lot of money. For example, there was a bill passed by the Congress six, seven, well, I guess
[01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:53.900]  about 10 years ago now called HR 218, the Peace Officers Safety Act, that was designed to ensure
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:56:00.540]  that peace officers, retired, certified law enforcement officers, could carry a firearm
[01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:07.500]  across state lines. Well, New York and a number of other liberal jurisdictions continue to take
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:14.620]  action against individuals who are supposed to be protected under HR 218. They don't even want
[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:19.580]  retired cops with a good record to be able to have a gun. These people are sick. These are
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:25.820]  officers that are post-certified. Police officers are standards in training and they have certification
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:32.700]  to prove it and yet we're going to end of these governmental entities and states like New York
[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:38.860]  take action against them. So citizens need to be very careful. There are organizations out there
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:45.260]  like a couple that I just mentioned and one that you showed, the FOP, that are active out there
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:50.380]  to help police officers. So it's always wise to make sure that you understand what the laws are
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:55.180]  in your jurisdiction. They may be unconstitutional, but they can still give you a real headache
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:57:00.380]  before you take action. Exactly. That's why we had 1500 of us march in San Antonio with the
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:05.180]  land commissioner and then we did it on state land as well and then we educated the police before
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:08.940]  we came and it was meant to make the city council change what they were doing, not with the liberal
[01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:13.900]  media claim, you know, some anti-police action because Soros is really trying. That's another
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:17.180]  question for you, sir. We got loaded phones here, but we're almost out of time. I'll probably have to
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:22.460]  take the calls after you're gone, but is there any doubt in your mind about Soros, 35 million alone
[01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:27.900]  in Ferguson trying to stir up a revolution against local government so the feds and Sharpen's words
[01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:34.060]  can come in and federalize the police? That's exactly what we're seeing. This Department of
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:39.180]  Justice is not out there to support individual officers. They're not out there to support
[01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:44.780]  individual law-abiding citizens. They're using the power of the Department of Justice, the power of
[01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:51.180]  the federal bureaucracy, the power of the ability to use our civil rights laws against the police
[01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:57.900]  to come in whenever there's a perceived racial issue and make the police officer, the police
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:03.180]  department, the sheriff's office, the bad guy, not the citizens who are stirring things up.
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:07.580]  Sure. If you've got to go, I understand this is a 72nd break in only a five-minute segment. If we
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:14.780]  could, I'd like to come back and ask you one more question about jihadis or maybe come back another
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:20.620]  time. Can you say five more minutes? I can today, Alex, but I'll definitely make myself available.
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:24.220]  All right, 30 seconds. How do you think Obama thinks he can bring in jihadis?
[01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:25.740]  Have them attack them and they're not getting trouble?
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:32.540]  Because he controls the levers of power. These people like the ones out in San Bernardino,
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:37.020]  the ones that were arrested in Texas, in California just a week or 10 days ago,
[01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:41.180]  this administration does not care about protecting the Americans.
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:44.300]  It's the arrogance. All right, Bob Barnes, thank you so much, sir. We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:52.220]  I got my question in. Got it all done. Thank you. For all of recorded history, civilizations around

[02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:15.660]  I'm sorry to the callers. I kind of hogged Bob Barr. And look, I know Bob Barr had some bad
[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:20.220]  votes. He wasn't perfect, but he really did try to impeach. He went after the Republicans on
[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:26.300]  missile secrets to China. And his last years in Congress, he got a lot better against the police
[02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:31.580]  state, and he's been really good since. But all I'm saying is, compared to what we've got now,
[02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:37.180]  he's a lot better. And look, I agree with him. Rand Paul has kind of receded in the race,
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:44.380]  maybe of Cruz and Trump falling their face. Maybe Rand Paul can reassurge. Rand Paul would have been
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:49.740]  the presumptive nominee six, eight months ago, when he was in the lead for the year before that,
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:52.940]  if he would have acted more aggressive, what people want to see.
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:01:01.980]  But he doesn't really play politics. He's very dry. I don't want to say that Paul's a robotic,
[02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:07.740]  because they're very, very principle, but they are very calm. I have a sense their blood pressure
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:16.060]  is pretty low. Mine's not. It's not high, but it's not really low. And people are in a trance.
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:20.220]  They've got to be shaken out of the trance. The reason they're into sports is it's all raw. Raw
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:27.980]  or raw, raw instincts are not for sports. Therefore, getting involved in society,
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:34.140]  getting involved in our lives, getting excited about jobs we're doing. And you look at any spoiled
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:37.100]  rotten kid, you know, they never want to work. They never want to do anything. And then soon,
[02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:40.220]  they don't want to pick up the channel remote and hit the buttons and they don't want to make, you
[02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:44.140]  know, go get themselves, you know, food or they don't want to dress themselves. That's what spoiled
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:49.020]  kids get like. And as a country, a lot of people have gotten like that, the politicians, the general
[02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:53.260]  public, you name it. And we put up with more and more until we wake up and where are we?
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:57.980]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to go to Max with his take or what he thought about it. I'm
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:02.460]  going to go to Liberty. I'm going to go to Denise and Damien and Luke on the thing we just talked
[02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:06.700]  about. So we'll just get your view on Clinton and Hillary and Ted Cruz and the rest of it.
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:10.380]  Because I know there were some good questions I should have got to about, you know, questions to
[02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:15.580]  Bob Barr about Ted Cruz. We'll probably find out what those questions are now, but I can
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:24.380]  probably tell you as much about Ted Cruz as Bob Barr can. Cruz, it's troubling that his wife was
[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:32.620]  high level Goldman Sachs. It's troubling he got loans from him. It's troubling that his wife was
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:37.340]  in the council on foreign relations. But I know a lot of people that come on this show now and
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:41.980]  speak out against the new world order that were in the CFR. The CFR is up to like 6,000 people.
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:48.860]  Now it used to be just a couple thousand, but they've got regional boards now. There's a couple
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:53.580]  hundred on the actual steering committee and the different boards. That's three different groups,
[02:02:53.580 --> 02:03:01.180]  but that's the real CFR. There's all these little influence peddling deals that where they want to
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:04.700]  run the local governments, they want to run everything and people get a lot of business and
[02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:11.980]  a lot of contacts obviously out of being on the CFR. But, you know, in a way Goldman Sachs has
[02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:17.260]  its tentacles into everything and it kind of gets to a point of an old meme about this show
[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:26.460]  where they go, Alex Jones is owned by ABC News because at that time stations pick people up
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:31.020]  off of three satellites, Clear Channel, ABC News, and then one was called Jones.
[02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:38.860]  And so we would lease under federal law, there had to be lawsuits not by us by others decades ago,
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:44.220]  where they wouldn't lease people. Satellite time to be on radio and there have been lawsuits.
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:48.940]  So you go and you pay them, you know, just like if you wanted to get syndicated, you'd call up and
[02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:52.300]  say, I want to lease time, you know, on the satellite and they'll just lease it to you.
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:56.620]  People then say, well, Alex Jones, you know, he works for ABC News.
[02:03:56.620 --> 02:04:04.220]  You know, just bizarre stuff like that. So I don't want to go that far because Goldman
[02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:10.380]  Sachs is so big and say, well, that just means he's the devil. But there, his wife really was a
[02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:18.940]  high level executive at Goldman. He really did do all those things. I'm not even saying he's a bad guy
[02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:24.220]  because at the state level and at the federal level, he's had good votes, a good background.
[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:29.580]  He was involved in anti-communist activities when he was a teenager. I think his dad is a patriot.
[02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:35.580]  And I don't think Ted Cruz is a bad guy. I mean, we didn't know much about him back when he came
[02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:39.660]  out of the state. And, you know, we first interviewed him like six, seven years ago,
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:45.660]  and then suddenly he's US Senator. Now he's the second, you know, place in the run for the Republican
[02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:51.180]  nomination. But now we've seen more Ted Cruz and I don't think he's a bad guy. I think he's a good
[02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:56.940]  guy. I mean, I admire Ted Cruz. So I'd be happy if he became president. Stay with us.
[02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:25.500]  Especially after the sixth GOP debate in which Cruz accused Trump of once having New York values.
[02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:29.820]  That said, numerous people, including Trump himself, are questioning whether the Canadian-born
[02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:35.020]  Cruz meets the status as a natural-born citizen of the United States, which is one of the eligibility
[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:39.420]  requirements established in the Constitution for election to the office of president and vice president.
[02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:43.820]  The establishment was hoping Marco Rubio would overtake Cruz in the race. But Rubio's love affair
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:47.980]  with amnesty for illegal aliens makes him unelectable in the eyes of many Americans.

[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:23.740]  Let the freedom to fail give you the hope to fight from the front lines of the information war.
[02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:36.540]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:47.020 --> 02:08:51.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday.
[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:56.700]  Worldwide broadcast. That's an interesting liner they came up with. I like it.
[02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:02.620]  But think about that. Let the freedom to fail be your hope to fight.
[02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:11.500]  We know where this is going brings us into enslavement. We know there are just amazing
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:17.740]  things going on all around us, some good, some bad. And we know, most importantly, that it's not just
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:25.020]  some foregone conclusion that we go into this corrupt, tyrannical world government. The very
[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:31.900]  megabanks that run the planet are now setting up another engineered collapse to then demand,
[02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:39.740]  holding us ransom, even more power if we don't give them all these new regulatory systems
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:44.460]  and all these trillions and trillions and currencies. I'm going to go over news now. Some
[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:47.820]  of what I mentioned, a lot of what I haven't gotten to, and then we had a phone glitch and
[02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:52.140]  lost the callers. I'm just going to get new calls on new subjects, the economy. How bad do
[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:56.220]  you think the worldwide meltdown is going to be? What do you think of the democratic debates last
[02:09:56.220 --> 02:10:09.340]  night? 800-259-9231, first time callers 800-2599-231. 800-2599-231. I mean, it's really sickening
[02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:17.900]  to watch Bernie Sanders. It's truly nauseating to see him juxtaposed, a weird communist who went
[02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:24.460]  to communist events and hangs out with weird third-world dictators up there creepily calling
[02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:29.900]  for socialism. We know the hell it produces, and then not calling this crony capitalism,
[02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:35.180]  but demonizing wealth as a problem. We know it's full wealth. Capitalist systems produce so much
[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:44.300]  wealth and create such incredible power. He doesn't criticize Walmart for running shady deals and
[02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:49.020]  having a plan to deindustrialize things and doing slave deals with China. He criticizes it because
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:54.780]  they made a bunch of money. Then you juxtapose it with Hillary claiming she's out fighting big banks
[02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:03.260]  and she's the anti-establishment candidate when there's never been a candidate other than Obama
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:07.980]  who's been as establishment as Hillary. I mean, she is a thoroughbred of Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:14.540]  Morgan. In fact, she's gotten more money last article I saw a few months ago than all the
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:21.980]  Republican candidates combined from Wall Street. And not from the general Wall Street that does a
[02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:27.420]  lot of great work, capitalizes this nation and the world, but the big mega brokerage firms that
[02:11:27.420 --> 02:11:32.460]  do the flash trading and run the scams and fix the markets. I mean, there's only five or six of
[02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:39.420]  these groups in North America and only a few others globally. They all operate globally.
[02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:46.060]  And man, they are above the law. They rig the stock market, the interest rates, everything.
[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:51.900]  The currencies, gold and silver, it's all admitted. We used to fight and fight and fight 10 years ago
[02:11:51.900 --> 02:11:56.940]  to expose that everything was staged. We knew it was. We had whistleblowers on. I've had guests on
[02:11:56.940 --> 02:12:03.100]  who got killed after they exposed stuff on the stock market. You talk about scary. Now, things
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:09.820]  that people died for is just no big deal. Bernie Madoff stealing tens of billions of dollars,
[02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:14.940]  he got in trouble because he stole it from insiders with a scam even better than their scams.
[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:23.180]  And so they burned him. And he was kind of the sacrifice that came out of 2008.
[02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:30.220]  He was low level. He stole billions. They steal trillions. He ran his own personal scam.
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:37.740]  But when Goldman Sachs does it or JP Morgan does it or Wells Fargo does it, it's okay.
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:43.180]  And now you've got the Royal Bank of Scotland saying, sell all your stocks, get out in the next
[02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:50.860]  month. You've got all these other top governmental institutions, X checkers, private treasuries,
[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:56.380]  public treasuries. Why are they saying that? French president declares economic emergency.
[02:12:57.740 --> 02:13:08.780]  Associated press. French President Hollande pledged today to redefine France's business model and
[02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:13.740]  declared what he called a state of economic and social emergency. So first, he drives the country
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:20.860]  in a total bankruptcy in the last three years with 101% taxation on the nouveau riche to use a
[02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:26.860]  French word, the new rich. I mean, you're making 100,000 pounds a year. You pay like 80% tax.
[02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:31.900]  You're making 500,000 pounds a year. You pay 101%. But if you're a super elitist, you rattle the laws
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:39.340]  or tax exempt unveiling a 2 billion euro plan to revive hiring and catch up with the fast moving
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:45.900]  world economy. That means give money to select corporations to hire people. Oh, that'll really
[02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:50.620]  say, but see, the 2 billion is nothing. It's the civil emergency allows him to operate however he
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:56.140]  wants. The measures he proposed, however, are relevant, relatively modest. And he said they
[02:13:56.140 --> 02:14:01.340]  would not put into question the 35 hour work week, which his country is under a state of emergency
[02:14:01.340 --> 02:14:04.780]  since extremist attacks in November. Yeah, I noticed they bring in the extremists.
[02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:11.900]  They attack and then they declare no free speech, a civil emergency. And now there's an economic
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:16.620]  emergency. See, first, they put the civil emergency in, then they take your money.
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:21.660]  And then it's the announcement of the economic emergency allows him to give money to whoever
[02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:26.460]  he wants, do whatever he wants. And but no, here's $2 billion. Here's some chicken feed for you.
[02:14:27.980 --> 02:14:32.220]  He like runs up a $10,000 bill and gives the waiter $5 is basically what that is.
[02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:39.100]  Here's another report. The financial apocalypse accelerates as middle east stocks crash to begin
[02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:50.940]  the week. Local officials say Walmart closures shocking and devastating. So if Walmart closing
[02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:56.140]  near your town is devastating, what does it say your town is? People that work in most of these
[02:14:56.140 --> 02:15:00.780]  little towns travel up to 50 miles a day to go find work, then they come back and like the company
[02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:07.820]  store, give everything to Walmart. And there's all these dead empty towns. And part of that's
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:11.820]  folks moving into the cities. Part of that is people, those populations getting old. But
[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:18.300]  Walmart was there to take advantage of all that. And you look at the Walmartians when you're out
[02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:26.460]  in the country waddling in. I mean, I got to tell you, and I'm going to be honest, I've lost 60 plus
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:30.220]  pounds. I need to go take another photo today with my shirt off just for the products because it's
[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:36.060]  it's astounding. I have a hat that's like, you know, 4x 5x. I mean, I, you know, I think there's
[02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:40.060]  only like one or two head sizes bigger than mine. I've rarely seen people that have bigger head
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:46.540]  than mine. So it creates a optical illusion on television, you know, that that I'm not so much
[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:51.660]  fat, but just have this big head. I have a huge skull. And in fact, my dad's a dentist and he
[02:15:51.660 --> 02:15:57.340]  says it's one of the widest mandibles he's ever seen. But the point is I have a bulldog head
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:01.660]  literally. That's what George Norrie calls me the bulldog because in person you can see it.
[02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:07.260]  And I have big, big, big shoulders too. But so it offsets just how big the head is. But man,
[02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:14.060]  I'm telling you, I now have six pack. I don't have to suck in my stomach and I have a big torso.
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:19.580]  But when I'm sitting down, how did I get off into this story? Oh, it's about Walmartians.
[02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:27.020]  You go in Walmart, you go in places and the people are shuffling around black, white,
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:32.300]  Hispanic as a matter. If they're not obese, they have like green, blue skin with zits all over them,
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:38.300]  old, young, eczema skin falling off. Everyone looks dead like zombies. I mean, just everywhere
[02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:46.780]  I go, Americans look like hell. And the numbers show it. And so I'm not up here bashing anybody.
[02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:52.620]  It's the culture, it's the food, it's the fluoride, but it's the TV. It's TV signals. You've got all
[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:59.180]  these people on average now getting about 10 hours of screen time that brain damages you.
[02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:06.860]  They're never awake and they don't exercise. And if we want to defeat the globalists, we really
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:10.940]  have to get away from the television. People always comment, well, why are you on it then?
[02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:15.420]  That's like saying, if I'm going to fight, why am I on the, you know, if you're against being a gladiator,
[02:17:15.420 --> 02:17:19.580]  why are you in the arena? Because they threw me in the arena. I mean, I don't want this to be the system,
[02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:24.940]  but this is. And, you know, they admit radio, something that's healthy for the mind because you
[02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:30.300]  listen to it and it makes you image what is being said and causes new neural pathways to form. Reading
[02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:34.300]  does the same thing. They're both very good. Just look up studies, listening to radio, good for your
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:39.900]  brain, reading, good for your brain, study, TV, bad for your brain, because you don't have to
[02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:46.780]  do anything. It's already done. You're just receiving, not constructing gray matter, too much
[02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:52.620]  screen time damages brain. And that's a whitewash. That's psychology today. And look, I'm not telling
[02:17:52.620 --> 02:17:57.580]  you anything you don't know. I'm not up here telling you, I'm smart and I'm your guru. I'm
[02:17:57.580 --> 02:18:03.420]  saying stuff, you know, don't let your kids watch television. Don't let them have computers. I get
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:10.060]  it. You can go watch your show. They can watch their show. It's fun. It's easy to do. Make sure
[02:18:10.060 --> 02:18:16.140]  it's Nova. Make sure it's a World War II documentary. Make sure it's not these modern sitcoms and
[02:18:16.140 --> 02:18:20.540]  dramas that are meant to take your kids away from you, scramble their brains and turn them into mental
[02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:27.500]  patients who don't have good logic and just make jokes and everything. It's psychological warfare.
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:33.900]  And I'm digressing. It's just that the world is so incredible. Incredible things are happening
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:39.980]  right now and they want to permanently wire your brains where you have no attention span and can't
[02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:47.180]  even be communicated with. And I do want to go out with a video camera and show people at a swimming
[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:54.060]  pool at Barton Springs, show people walking down the street, show people at different events. And
[02:18:54.060 --> 02:19:01.820]  then you see the fitness people and the health people. They're just glowing and look healthy and
[02:19:01.820 --> 02:19:07.980]  look great. And then you see everybody else and they look like they've been run over by a truck.
[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:13.900]  And that shows you what the system will do, what it's feeding you, what it's showing you.
[02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:17.900]  And let me tell you, I talk to these fitness people. They might watch a football game once a
[02:19:17.900 --> 02:19:21.740]  week. They might go see a movie at night. It's not bad to watch a few TV shows in my view.
[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:28.380]  To go see a movie. But obviously, if you're doing it 10 hours a day,
[02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:34.940]  if you got to be on screens a couple hours a day at work, do that. And then don't watch television
[02:19:34.940 --> 02:19:42.220]  at night or be aware of what you're doing because it screws your brain up. Read a book. And look,
[02:19:42.220 --> 02:19:48.780]  I'm saying this to myself. I'm saying this to myself. We're all in this together. And I'm telling
[02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:54.220]  you, in five years trying to get healthy, I've lost 60 plus pounds. I feel better. I feel like
[02:19:54.220 --> 02:19:58.380]  I'm 20 years old. And everybody can do it. You don't have to do it overnight.

[02:24:03.500 --> 02:24:09.660]  I'm not the kind to kiss and tell. Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with
[02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:18.540]  fairer. I've never been with anything less than a dime so fine. I've been on fire with Sally,
[02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:26.220]  feel gone fast with a girl named Bo, but somehow they just don't end up as mine. It's death to
[02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:32.780]  fire. We're gonna go to David, Denise, Darren, Joe, Max, start of the next segment.
[02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:39.180]  And we are going to go over more news after they leave us.
[02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:47.500]  But let me right now get back into more of the news, finishing up with a whole financial situation.
[02:24:50.380 --> 02:24:54.300]  Again, I want to repeat this and I know you know this, we got to get this talking point out to
[02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:59.820]  everybody. The same people that ran the 29 collapse, that ran the other major collapses,
[02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:05.420]  this is admitted in congressional hearings, stood to gain and engineered and triggered
[02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:12.620]  2007, 2008, because they set the bubbles in motion, then they decide want to implode them.
[02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:18.140]  It's institutionalized insider trading, which again is admitted and flash trash
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:25.500]  trading and micro trades and all of it. It's just a total scam, derivatives, credit default swaps.
[02:25:25.500 --> 02:25:33.660]  And so now we've got the Dow Jones industrial average down another 390 points today,
[02:25:34.380 --> 02:25:40.620]  down to 15,988. And they can keep putting derivatives into it, they can keep putting
[02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:46.140]  dollars into it as long as they wanted to. They decided to go ahead and raise interest rates,
[02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:53.740]  which signaled this. They're riding the artificial system and they are going to control the next
[02:25:53.740 --> 02:25:58.540]  consolidation and the next bailout. And it'll be like Groundhog Day, but worse. And then it'll
[02:25:58.540 --> 02:26:04.460]  happen again in five, 10 years. And then again, and again, and again, and again, until we are
[02:26:04.460 --> 02:26:10.780]  homeless. That's the goal, bankrupt the general public, because the elites are basically exempt
[02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:15.820]  from the regulations and taxes they foist on us. And until people like Hollande of France
[02:26:16.700 --> 02:26:22.380]  and the EU bureaucrats aren't tax exempt like the other establishment people, until that happens,
[02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:27.580]  they're going to destroy us. This is modern warfare. This is how they capture us.
[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:33.180]  And then they bring in the jihadis and Obama takes our liberties. They bring them the jihadis
[02:26:33.180 --> 02:26:38.380]  and they declare a civil emergency, martial law in Europe. And now they've declared financial
[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:45.900]  emergency. See how they do that? And they arrest filmmakers in America.
[02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:53.740]  Like the guy that made a film about Muhammad and that whole fake thing and blaming Mungazi
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:58.140]  on it. Arrested him. He spent a year in jail. David Knight, Jakari Jackson's hosting is going
[02:26:58.140 --> 02:27:02.380]  to be covering it next hour. I always mess up his hosts in the fourth hour because I don't get a
[02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:06.620]  sheet to litter like David Knight is no dude. It'll be, it'll be great. It'll be Jakari Jackson
[02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:11.900]  and David Knight hosting that. And they say it was a great movie, 13 hours. I talked to
[02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:20.140]  Shane who went to it with Tim Kennedy. I wish I would have gone. I was busy, but I do want to go
[02:27:20.140 --> 02:27:24.300]  see it. And they said from what they know, it's pretty accurate. And that's what our crew has
[02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:28.060]  said about it. Basically saying there was a government ordered stand down, which we know,
[02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:32.380]  at least for eight hours, but the whole thing took 13. I mean, you really believe they stood down
[02:27:32.380 --> 02:27:37.260]  while you, all the US ambassadors under attack for eight hours. I mean, of course they've been
[02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:44.460]  proven to be lying academically, but it just shows how crazy it is. And getting back to what I was
[02:27:44.460 --> 02:27:51.740]  covering with the financials, the problem is they've been securing themselves. The elite have been
[02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:59.660]  digging in while telling us everything's okay and getting themselves positioned. And then I see
[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:06.780]  articles like this one. El Chapo lawyers say he can't get a fair trial in the US because of Donald
[02:28:06.780 --> 02:28:14.940]  Trump saying he's a criminal. What a stupid way to defend El Chapo. How about the fact that his
[02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:21.820]  number two admitted four years ago in a federal hearing in Chicago, was in the Chicago Tribune
[02:28:21.820 --> 02:28:26.060]  and El Paso times we did reports on at the time and wrote articles. You can pull it up. It was
[02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:31.820]  even in Business Insider Associated Press that, Hey, I'm CIA. We bring it in for the US government.
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:35.980]  They've turned against us. I need to go into secret hearing and the judge released him and said,
[02:28:35.980 --> 02:28:43.420]  yeah, he's CIA. Shinaloa and El Chapo have been allowed to operate for 20 something years,
[02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:49.020]  really 30, but as the LFA for 20, because they had a deal with the US government and other
[02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:56.700]  Western governments and big banks, just like Manuel Noriega had, just like Pepe Escobar had.
[02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:02.300]  And what they do is down the road, these guys always get too big for their britches.
[02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:07.900]  I don't like Richard Nixon got too big and thought he was really president. And that's why they had
[02:29:07.900 --> 02:29:12.060]  an inside coup against him. They shot Ronald Reagan when he thought he was president was going
[02:29:12.060 --> 02:29:18.220]  to get rid of the IRS. I mean, to their credit, of course, I'm not comparing Ronald Reagan people
[02:29:18.220 --> 02:29:24.860]  to El Chapo. What I'm getting is this is all a joke. You can't put El Chapo in jail when he's
[02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:30.620]  just a CIA kingpin, a front man. I mean, he's a lot bigger, but he's in the same ballpark
[02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:36.380]  as Freeway Rick Ross. You know, the real Rick Ross, the 25 million a day cocaine dealer with a CIA,
[02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:41.500]  not the fat jail guard that runs around masquerading us him and then puts down the real Rick Ross,
[02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:47.180]  because the body snatcher always puts down the real person. The pod always puts down the real person.
[02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:54.620]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:54.620 --> 02:30:02.300]  Several gas stations in Michigan have lowered their gas prices to under $1 per gallon,
[02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:07.260]  with one station as low as 78 cents per gallon. Meanwhile, across the U.S., oil is so plentiful
[02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:11.020]  and cheap that at least one buyer said it would actually need to be paid to refine oil.
[02:30:11.020 --> 02:30:15.900]  But Hill Resources, a refinery owned by the Koch brothers, said it wants 50 cents a barrel Friday
[02:30:15.900 --> 02:30:20.380]  for North Dakota Sauer, a high-grade soul for grade of crude, according to a list price posted
[02:30:20.380 --> 02:30:26.380]  on its website. In comparison, their refinery was paying $13.50 a barrel a year ago and $47.60
[02:30:26.380 --> 02:30:31.260]  in January 2014. Overall, U.S. benchmark oil prices have collapsed more than 70 percent in
[02:30:31.260 --> 02:30:36.220]  the past 18 months and fell below $30 a barrel for the first time in 12 years last week. West
[02:30:36.220 --> 02:30:40.700]  Texas Intermediate was already trading near $29 in New York on Monday. This will lead to the collapse
[02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:44.620]  of major oil companies and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs, meaning the economic compression
[02:30:44.620 --> 02:30:48.700]  is likely. In other words, the global oversupply of oil has now reached the point that the market
[02:30:48.700 --> 02:30:52.300]  is effectively forcing producers to pay them to give their oil away. Otherwise, the oil will
[02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:56.060]  simply sit in bloated storage facilities or on tankers parked out in the ocean. This is

[02:33:07.820 --> 02:33:15.180]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:19.420]  All right. I'm going to go through your phone calls and then I'm going to go through the science
[02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:27.020]  and tech news, the economy news, the politics news, the election news. But I just hit the El
[02:33:27.020 --> 02:33:31.660]  Chapo stack. Let me just give you an example of what's in this one stack. And I've got like
[02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:40.700]  1112 stacks here. El Chapo lawyers say he can't get a fair trial in the U.S. because of Donald
[02:33:40.700 --> 02:33:45.500]  Trump. Linda Tripp, Bill had affairs with thousands of women and then she goes into all the other
[02:33:45.500 --> 02:33:52.780]  rapes. Bernie Sanders' radical past of the Vermont Firebrand started wearing a suit and gave up
[02:33:52.780 --> 02:34:00.300]  on taking over big companies. And then it just goes through all the stuff he did.
[02:34:01.660 --> 02:34:05.660]  U.S. and Iraq search for Americans kidnapped and Baghdad.
[02:34:07.900 --> 02:34:14.780]  Poll, majority of Americans support marijuana legalization. That ties into the El Chapo thing.
[02:34:14.780 --> 02:34:20.300]  I'm not for the drug culture. I don't like it. But making it illegal makes the drugs dirty,
[02:34:20.300 --> 02:34:25.740]  makes it really profitable, creates crime waves of people out robbing and stealing and selling
[02:34:25.740 --> 02:34:30.620]  their bodies to get the drugs. The drug war only makes it worse for us, better for the big banks
[02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:36.620]  that launder the money. And they've used it to corrupt the police. It goes on and on and on. I
[02:34:36.620 --> 02:34:43.740]  want to get into report risk of nuclear weapons being stolen up. I want to get into harshest
[02:34:43.740 --> 02:34:48.700]  Arctic era of the season to grip Midwestern, Eastern U.S. And then Hillary, when it got really cold
[02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:52.860]  again a few weeks ago, came out and said, this is global warming. And I've got all these clips
[02:34:52.860 --> 02:34:57.980]  of Bernie Sanders. Climate change is that climate change is absolutely real. Okay.
[02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:04.220]  I know I talk like a muppet, but it's real. Do something now to save the earth. We have to do
[02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:11.660]  this now. There's no more. These big Walmart people, the oil companies lie all day, but they know
[02:35:11.660 --> 02:35:17.420]  the earth is dying. It's not genetic engineering. It's not overfishing. It's not secret weapons
[02:35:17.420 --> 02:35:24.540]  and dangerous. It's carbon dioxide plants breathe. Is that clear? Meanwhile, the big mega banks,
[02:35:24.540 --> 02:35:32.060]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, all of them are financing carbon taxes as the jewel in the crown of world
[02:35:32.060 --> 02:35:39.900]  government to not just tax, but to selectively tax all human activity and to be able to label
[02:35:39.900 --> 02:35:44.700]  any other activity they don't want is evil. They're like, we may have to cut down trees
[02:35:44.700 --> 02:35:51.020]  by the millions. They're producing carbon dioxide. That's, that's Smithsonian Associated Press.
[02:35:52.060 --> 02:35:59.420]  Now the trees are evil. You're like, that sounds crazy. Why would they say they're not crazy? They
[02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:06.540]  want to ask for the moon because when you ask for the moon, you tend to get the moon. They're demanding.
[02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:12.300]  They've got us paying for millions of sex changes a year,
[02:36:12.300 --> 02:36:17.340]  but they will take the house from an old lady who has a heart attack claiming she owes $5,000
[02:36:17.340 --> 02:36:23.340]  to the IRS. They're bloodthirsty scum. They give you the right to have your genitals cut off,
[02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:27.340]  but they don't give you the right to not have the NSA spying on you. They give you the right to eat
[02:36:27.340 --> 02:36:32.140]  GMO foods that'll kill you dead in a hammer, but they'll make sure Seattle Bands brown bags because
[02:36:32.140 --> 02:36:38.860]  they're racist. They give you faux mentally ill rights and take your real rights away.
[02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:46.860]  Now I'm going to go to your calls. First off, this is a big success and I can't wait to see the
[02:36:46.860 --> 02:36:51.340]  reviews come in because when they got ready for this and sent us the prototype six months ago,
[02:36:53.900 --> 02:36:58.620]  we only had one of these. So one of our camera folks took it home, used it, loved it, loved the
[02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:05.180]  how fast the water came out. We have the side by side studies of how it purifies and cuts all
[02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:08.780]  these hundreds of toxins out of your water. I mean, a lot of these with shower filters just take out
[02:37:08.780 --> 02:37:13.180]  a little bit of the stuff, reduce it some, you make it have a better smell. And you know, it's
[02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:17.980]  still good. You know, they're charcoal based, not this. This has four filters in it and is a game
[02:37:17.980 --> 02:37:23.740]  changer. And I'm really proud of Pro Pure and what they've developed. Best filters period when it
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:29.580]  comes to shower filters. And they're available at info wars store.com in the water filtration
[02:37:29.580 --> 02:37:33.420]  section. We have four different brands there. They're all excellent for the prices.
[02:37:33.420 --> 02:37:38.220]  They're all comparable. Some are better at flow rates. Some are better at taking this out, but not
[02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:43.100]  at that. The point is that all reduces it or takes it out hundreds of things that takes out hundreds
[02:37:43.100 --> 02:37:49.980]  of things that reduces down to less than 1%. That's a big deal. And it's very hard to get things
[02:37:49.980 --> 02:37:55.180]  like fluoride and glyphosates out. They're ubiquitous. And this brings it down to basically
[02:37:55.180 --> 02:38:06.140]  non detectable levels. So proud of it info wars life.com info wars store.com pro pure pro max.
[02:38:06.140 --> 02:38:10.540]  And you know, I'm going to put the water filters in the info wars life section, I think to not just
[02:38:10.540 --> 02:38:14.540]  in the main section, because this is, this is comparable to a nutraceutical. This is just as
[02:38:14.540 --> 02:38:22.300]  important as taking X2 or survival shield X2, super male vitality, lung cleanse and all the
[02:38:22.300 --> 02:38:28.940]  other great products because it's that amazing. We are also ending a special today, but you can get
[02:38:29.820 --> 02:38:35.420]  10% off the promo code water on these great new shower filter systems. And I finally put them
[02:38:35.420 --> 02:38:40.460]  in last weekend, because we just gotten a big shipment of them in last week. And they are so
[02:38:40.460 --> 02:38:47.100]  amazing. It works as good as the old shower head I had in there that only reduced stuff and wasn't
[02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:51.580]  as good. And it's a little bit less expensive. And we still sell those as well. I mean, something's
[02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:56.540]  better than nothing. Before the very best thing you could get unless it was a whole house system,
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:39:03.020]  only reduced stuff. And the other ones didn't have a good enough flow rate. This has great flow rate
[02:39:03.020 --> 02:39:08.380]  and massively cuts it out or on some pathogens reduces it. But finally, we have a special ending
[02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:13.260]  today will end today. I promise it will be done today. Sometimes I use folks being behind schedule
[02:39:13.260 --> 02:39:16.380]  being so busy just the way to keep a sale going. They haven't I said, I've been taken down here
[02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:20.860]  supposed to be taken down this weekend. No, it hadn't fine take it down tonight. And that is the
[02:39:20.860 --> 02:39:25.820]  50% off colloidal silver. When you get a bottle of X to 50% off on silver bullet
[02:39:26.940 --> 02:39:32.860]  at info wars life.com. And then we had to end the 30% off or 40% off depending on which item
[02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:37.260]  on the info or selects verbal food, but it's still the lowest price out there, even without the
[02:39:37.260 --> 02:39:43.580]  discount. So check that out at info wars store.com as well today. And it does end today. Speaking of
[02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:49.340]  today, it will be gone tomorrow, six months free when you sign up for a year. The next best thing
[02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:54.060]  is to sign up for 595 ago month to month after tomorrow. But we only do this in the part of
[02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:58.380]  December in January every year, usually five months free. It's six months free prison planet

[02:40:04.140 --> 02:40:09.100]  support our local sponsors on the local stations, support the national sponsors as well, but and
[02:40:09.100 --> 02:40:14.380]  support those local affiliates by spreading the word or becoming a sponsor. And by
[02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:21.740]  letting those stations know that you're supporting the sponsors or send the stations 100 bucks.
[02:40:21.740 --> 02:40:25.660]  I'm serious. You don't know how they're trying to bankrupt talk radio. You don't know how the
[02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:32.060]  big insiders are coming in with these institutional media packages for hospital groups and, and,
[02:40:32.060 --> 02:40:37.180]  you know, so much more or even government paid PR. You're supposed to just run
[02:40:38.460 --> 02:40:43.340]  public interest type stuff as part of your FCC license. Well, a lot of now are government paid
[02:40:43.340 --> 02:40:47.020]  where they can't survive on advertising. So the government comes along and says,
[02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:53.100]  Oh, we've got some PSAs and things that are funded. But by the way, we want Alex Jones off air.
[02:40:54.460 --> 02:41:02.140]  I'd never followed the LCRA back in like 1996, 97. And then I got called in by the new general
[02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:07.580]  manager and he said, you've been talking about the LCRA. I go, you mean the lower Colorado River
[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:12.780]  Authority? That was set up by LBJ famously corrupt and stuff. And it's had a lot of scandals
[02:41:12.780 --> 02:41:17.020]  before and since then. But I said, I haven't really talked about them. He goes, you talk about
[02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:22.540]  land grabbing. You talk about SOS, Save Our Springs, really taking these hundreds of thousands
[02:41:22.540 --> 02:41:27.020]  acres and building houses on it later. And I said, yeah, and he goes, well, if you want your job,
[02:41:27.020 --> 02:41:32.700]  keep your mouth shut about it. And about a month later, he calls me back here and he goes,
[02:41:33.340 --> 02:41:37.900]  don't talk about Bill Clinton either. And I said, I've got top ratings on the station.
[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:42.140]  You pay Howard Stern to be on and I've got the same ratings as he does at night.
[02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:44.700]  I mean, I have like three times the ratings of your number one sports show
[02:41:45.420 --> 02:41:52.940]  on during drive time afternoon. And he said, listen, you're going to start doing more entertainment
[02:41:53.500 --> 02:41:59.180]  and you are going to leave the system alone or you're not going to be on the air.
[02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:09.660]  And I said, I don't understand. I said, I do, you know, politicians, you do conspiracy theories.
[02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:14.700]  Now get out of my damn office because I guess when people feel bad about firing you and selling
[02:42:14.700 --> 02:42:19.660]  out or whatever, I guess they have to then make it like you're the bad guy. And then about a
[02:42:19.660 --> 02:42:25.180]  month later, I walk in with the BBC who was following me around for documentary and I become
[02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:30.140]  a salesman and I was bringing them, bringing in all this money and you know, the sponsors all love
[02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:38.620]  me and they didn't care. He walks in the hall and he goes, Alex, you're fired. Get your bleep out of
[02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:43.500]  here. He was just getting off on fire. I mean, like some bad guy out of a movie. And I said,
[02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:47.180]  well, I got to get my microphone and equipment out of the production studio because, you know,
[02:42:47.180 --> 02:42:51.260]  they were so cheap and stuff, you know, that they were always busy on the equipment they had that
[02:42:51.260 --> 02:42:55.900]  it was a big talk station. I had my own equipment on, you know, data recorder and stuff like that
[02:42:57.340 --> 02:43:03.500]  and microphone. And I just said, he goes, you're out of show business. And I looked at him and I
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:08.940]  said, I was never in show business. I said, I'm here just trying to promote the Bill of Rights
[02:43:08.940 --> 02:43:14.220]  and Constitution. And he goes, he got in my face, he goes, get out of here right now, like you wanted
[02:43:14.220 --> 02:43:24.540]  to fight me. And they let that guy go a few months later and change the format. And then he basically
[02:43:24.540 --> 02:43:30.540]  was washed up, I read. And the other program director that who'd never been a program director
[02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:35.180]  and got off on calling me in and treating me like crap, he's nowhere. But I don't mean to digress
[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:40.460]  onto all that. It's just these are the type of people that would sell, in my opinion,
[02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:45.100]  type folks are in the government. Those folks are much worse than these people.
[02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:51.180]  They would sell their mother out for a stick of bubblegum, as my grandfather used to say. They just
[02:43:51.180 --> 02:44:00.220]  are bootleckers. And a nation of bootleckers will be slaves. It's really that simple.
[02:44:01.740 --> 02:44:05.740]  And so I was just talking about our stations there. That's how I went off on that memory lane,
[02:44:07.260 --> 02:44:13.980]  that the good stations picking us up in many cases are turning down lots of money to take
[02:44:13.980 --> 02:44:18.780]  me off the air. They're turning down all sorts of stuff, all sorts of pressure, all sorts of dirty
[02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:23.100]  tricks, all sorts of stuff happening. Try to get us off stations and the opposite's happening.
[02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:29.020]  We're getting more affiliates, more stations, but folks, you better appreciate the stations that
[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:34.780]  pick up this broadcast. You better know that you shouldn't take it for granted and put a sign on
[02:44:34.780 --> 02:44:39.820]  your barn. Pay for a billboard if you got the money, especially folks that have means. Keep on
[02:44:39.820 --> 02:44:45.980]  your head down. Might have gotten you along before this. It won't now. This is a time of great up
[02:44:45.980 --> 02:44:54.380]  evil. So choose a side, as Christ said. Denise in Texas, thank you for holding her on the air
[02:44:54.380 --> 02:45:02.780]  worldwide. Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex. You know, I've got stock and if there's coyotes
[02:45:02.780 --> 02:45:08.940]  howling near my door and I don't pick up something to fire off around or two, it's my fault if they
[02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:14.860]  get taken out. And so I think with Obama and Benghazi, it's very clearly sedition where he
[02:45:14.860 --> 02:45:22.060]  incited the violence. Well, I mean, they had Al Qaeda running the security of Benghazi. They were
[02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:25.580]  running the attacks from the rest of the country out of there. They wanted to get the weapons
[02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:30.220]  and we're not sure, but we know the Turkish ambassador showed up. They were told they were
[02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:34.300]  getting the weapons. When they didn't, they showed up and took the weapons and so they were
[02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:40.220]  transferred to Al Qaeda and now that's all come out. And so next hour, one of many things,
[02:45:40.220 --> 02:45:45.900]  Jakari Jackson is going to be breaking down is his review of 13 hours, which I'm very pleased
[02:45:45.900 --> 02:45:50.700]  to hear is pretty accurate and admits that there was a major stand down. The CIA is upset about it.
[02:45:50.700 --> 02:45:55.260]  So that's another great sign. The globalists aren't in full control. If more of us just stop going
[02:45:55.260 --> 02:46:00.380]  along, so much of this tyranny counts on us acquiescing and just doing what we're told. Well,
[02:46:00.380 --> 02:46:05.500]  no, we're a free country and we're not going to just do what we're told anymore when it's flagrantly
[02:46:05.500 --> 02:46:12.060]  corrupt. Go ahead. You know, our weapons, anything that goes out of our country, somebody in the
[02:46:12.060 --> 02:46:18.060]  State Department has to put an okay stamp on it and somebody's got to keep track of what gets
[02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:23.820]  shipped where. And if Obama wants to put any kind of tags or locks on our guns, I'd like to know
[02:46:23.820 --> 02:46:29.420]  first, where did all those weapons go? That would be number two on my list, anything about Indiana.
[02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:36.620]  Absolutely. He's got to be impeached. There was a stand down order because those Navy Seals,
[02:46:36.620 --> 02:46:44.140]  CIA commandos, former Navy Seals to be technical, sacrifice their lives to try to defend those people.
[02:46:44.140 --> 02:46:50.620]  It held it up eight more hours and then the whole world could just sit there and watch the stand
[02:46:50.620 --> 02:46:58.060]  down like drying molasses. It just like like flypaper. It just didn't dry. It just sat there.
[02:46:58.060 --> 02:47:03.260]  Everybody could see it in slow motion and then see Hillary sit up there and say,
[02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:10.220]  I didn't know anything went on. Thank you, Denise. Darren in New Jersey. Go ahead. You're on the
[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:18.220]  here. Hi, Alex. How you doing today? Good, brother. I just want to ask you a question about these
[02:47:18.220 --> 02:47:26.620]  10 sailors that were captured by Iran. They got two heavily armed PT boats were captured by,
[02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:36.220]  I look like two 28 foot Boston Whalers. Sure. Last week. Go ahead. No, you go ahead.
[02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:43.340]  There's sailors that were heavily armed. How would they let these boats come up on them in the first
[02:47:43.340 --> 02:47:49.980]  place and let them take them in the second place? Well, I don't claim to be a Navy man,
[02:47:50.540 --> 02:47:54.140]  but I do know a little bit about the procedures and things. That's a question I should open up
[02:47:54.140 --> 02:47:57.820]  in the phones maybe next hour if they have some time throw out the question because they're talking
[02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:03.820]  about, you know, the 13 hours movie. Well, what about what just happened last week? They admittedly
[02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:14.540]  sent those boats up past the line into their waters. The question is they were only reportedly,
[02:48:14.540 --> 02:48:18.700]  you know, just a few hundred yards in. Why didn't they motorboat out of there? As you said, they had
[02:48:18.700 --> 02:48:25.500]  a lot faster boats and those little commando boats. And why did they not resist? They were, Dick Cheney,
[02:48:25.500 --> 02:48:31.100]  it came out with Sy Hirsch, wanted to false flag Iran and send in Navy SEALs and then have
[02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:37.020]  attack the ship and blame it on Iran. I don't know if that happened here, but the whole thing
[02:48:37.020 --> 02:48:43.180]  stings to high heaven. I'm just glad the Iranians released them very quickly. The U.S. military
[02:48:43.180 --> 02:48:46.940]  said the Americans were intercepted after the diesel engine and one of their boats
[02:48:46.940 --> 02:48:49.900]  developed the mechanical problems. That's one reason they couldn't run off, although it was
[02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:55.980]  unclear if the crew was aware of their precise location. The U.S. sailors were aboard the patrol
[02:48:55.980 --> 02:49:01.020]  boat. So there's your answer. One was in there probably to tow it out. So that that new info
[02:49:01.020 --> 02:49:06.300]  has come out. I'm just glad this wasn't used as a larger, larger provocation. What do you
[02:49:06.300 --> 02:49:08.780]  think's going on here? Just a mistake or do you think it's something else?
[02:49:10.300 --> 02:49:15.820]  I'll tell you the truth. It's not a mistake. How could they not know where they are? First of all,
[02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:21.660]  with all the equipment they have. And secondly, how would they let these people board their ship?
[02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:26.380]  It's the strongest Navy in the world and they let a couple... Well, that's another question.
[02:49:26.380 --> 02:49:30.700]  I mean, when you're in somebody else's waters and big ships pull up with guns on you, I mean,
[02:49:31.740 --> 02:49:34.220]  were they under orders to fight back against the Iranians?
[02:49:37.980 --> 02:49:42.620]  Yeah, I think they were under order to stand down and be captured for some reason, but I can't
[02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:47.900]  figure out why. Well, here's the problem. We know there's been so much dirty pool going on that you
[02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:51.420]  have to just assume dirty stuff's going on nowadays. I appreciate your call. Good points.
[02:49:52.220 --> 02:49:56.540]  You know, I followed that some last week as an unfolded, but they weren't releasing info for two
[02:49:56.540 --> 02:50:01.660]  days. What happened last Thursday, last Wednesday? And then for like two days, they wouldn't say
[02:50:01.660 --> 02:50:08.300]  anything and then they released them. I think it was Friday and thank God. That's a whole
[02:50:08.300 --> 02:50:12.620]  another subject. I don't want war with Iran. I'm not anti-Iran. I'm not anti any of these countries,
[02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:20.140]  but I am against the Mullahs oppressing their people. I am against the Saudi Arabian leadership is
[02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:28.540]  even worse. And we know they staged the whole arms for hostages situation with Iran-Contra
[02:50:28.540 --> 02:50:33.100]  back in 1980. And we know the Iranians have been involved in a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff,
[02:50:33.100 --> 02:50:37.820]  and I'll be honest with you, even top people I talked to don't know who the U.S. is really backing
[02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:41.820]  the Sunnis or the Shiites in the civil war. And the answer is they're not backing either side. It's
[02:50:41.820 --> 02:50:46.780]  just a big destabilization campaign. And a sick person could say, good, let the Muslims kill each
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:52.540]  other. Okay, well, get past Machiavelli. They're letting the blowback come here to then take our
[02:50:52.540 --> 02:50:56.700]  freedoms on the backs of the jihadist attacking us. So you're going to put up with that?
[02:50:59.420 --> 02:51:03.260]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune
[02:51:03.260 --> 02:51:08.300]  system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases. Since poor diet injuries are stressed for all
[02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:12.460]  contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation. Your body's number one means of
[02:51:12.460 --> 02:51:17.100]  neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione. Glutathione is the
[02:51:17.100 --> 02:51:21.660]  body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation. Hi, my name
[02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:27.020]  is Jason. I'm 44 years old. For 10 years, I have been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen
[02:51:27.020 --> 02:51:32.460]  and groin that radiated down into my feet. After three weeks on one roadway, the pain in my feet
[02:51:32.460 --> 02:51:37.740]  reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well. I ran out of one
[02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:43.100]  roadway and the pain returned. I got another container and again after three weeks, the pain
[02:51:43.100 --> 02:51:48.220]  reduced significantly throughout my body. I'd highly recommend one roadway to anyone dealing
[02:51:48.220 --> 02:51:55.340]  with chronic pain due to inflammation. Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com. That's one

[02:52:59.020 --> 02:53:04.300]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinewetz. I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold. By now you've heard our
[02:53:04.300 --> 02:53:08.380]  commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing. Ten years ago, I created
[02:53:08.380 --> 02:53:12.140]  a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about
[02:53:12.140 --> 02:53:17.420]  issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID. I felt having to broadcast my
[02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:22.460]  personal information was an invasion of privacy. Soon after it was also announced that credit cards,
[02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:28.060]  debit cards, U.S. passports, hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[02:53:28.780 --> 02:53:32.860]  It was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the
[02:53:32.860 --> 02:53:37.980]  world. There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID. I encourage everyone to get
[02:53:37.980 --> 02:53:43.740]  informed and get protected. Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or
[02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:48.300]  badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data. You'll be pleasantly surprised
[02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:52.540]  that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[02:53:52.540 --> 02:54:08.460]  It is as though the protection is free. Visit idstronghold.com today.
[02:54:08.460 --> 02:54:15.740]  Come on, come on, come on, baby. Come on, come on, come on.
[02:54:19.420 --> 02:54:24.140]  If we fight back, if we speak up, if we say we won't submit, there's no way the globalists
[02:54:24.140 --> 02:54:30.780]  can win, but they need our compliance. The enemy's now out in the open. Our job's pretty easy
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:35.660]  if we take action and have faith. Believe me, these globalists are mortal,
[02:54:35.660 --> 02:54:42.620]  and there's a God above. Look at the new story at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Kit Daniels,
[02:54:42.620 --> 02:54:47.100]  you can't make this stuff up. The Bill of Rights birthplace was demolished. He says partially
[02:54:47.100 --> 02:54:52.940]  demolished. There's a photo. They basically knocked half the building down. Serving as a
[02:54:52.940 --> 02:55:02.620]  microcosm or I'd say an omen or as a symbol or as a, what's the right word for something
[02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:09.420]  when it, when it just perfectly fits apropos. There's one even better,
[02:55:12.060 --> 02:55:20.940]  poignant, eerily poignant. Serving as a eerily poignant microcosm, I've added, of the Obama
[02:55:20.940 --> 02:55:26.940]  administration, a real estate developer partially demolished the reputed. Well, there's, there's
[02:55:26.940 --> 02:55:31.260]  no debating it. I just love how they're so into facts. My writer's just over fact stuff. No,
[02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:37.180]  that's the famous tavern. Birthplace, the Bill of Rights, the developer triple crown core secured
[02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:41.500]  a permit to demolish a two-story building, formerly known as the James Bell Tavern in
[02:55:41.500 --> 02:55:46.700]  Silver Spring Township, Pennsylvania. But by the time the third of the building was destroyed,
[02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:51.180]  the city stopped the demolition because officials realized the Bill of Rights was
[02:55:51.820 --> 02:56:00.460]  conceived the tavern in a 1788 meeting. And you'd think it'd be a tourist attraction,
[02:56:00.460 --> 02:56:05.580]  but people don't care. Now that was a tourist attraction to worship, you know, Kanye West,
[02:56:07.100 --> 02:56:12.860]  Kyan's wife's behind or something. I mean, then they would all absolutely love it.
[02:56:15.340 --> 02:56:19.420]  I'm going to take your phone calls a few of them right now. There's a new Mark Dice video out.
[02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:29.260]  It's up on infowars.com. Hillary supporters sign a petition to repeal the Bill of Rights for Hillary.
[02:56:30.460 --> 02:56:35.100]  So the Don Salazar article infowars.com, somebody needs to send it to Drudge.
[02:56:36.940 --> 02:56:41.100]  So, you know, he's also gone out and asked him, will you, will you put gun owners in FEMA camps?
[02:56:41.100 --> 02:56:45.020]  And he goes, forced labor and they're like, yes, the guy's like, I'm sick of them. Let's arrest them.
[02:56:45.020 --> 02:56:50.220]  These are well-spoken people that want to arrest those. You see, these are freaks, folks. You know,
[02:56:50.220 --> 02:56:56.700]  Handgun Control Incorporated, Bob Barr reminded me, opposed retired police officers with good records,
[02:56:56.700 --> 02:57:02.700]  honorably discharged, honorably retired from being able to have concealed carry across state lines.
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:09.580]  I mean, they don't even want retired cops to have guns, folks. These are freaks. They're rich people
[02:57:09.580 --> 02:57:14.140]  with their bodyguards and their private jets, and they don't like us being able to protect ourselves.
[02:57:14.140 --> 02:57:17.660]  They're going to place some of that coming up in Jakari Jackson takes over.
[02:57:18.380 --> 02:57:21.260]  David in New York, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[02:57:22.700 --> 02:57:27.900]  I'll let you have to get rid of the guns if you, if they're going to do what they want to do here.
[02:57:27.900 --> 02:57:35.500]  But anyways, I'm calling you today from UN Region 2. And I heard a little while ago,
[02:57:35.500 --> 02:57:41.900]  we were talking about the impeachment of Obama. And I'm thinking that I don't really think it's
[02:57:41.900 --> 02:57:48.940]  an Obama thing. I think it's not even a Democrat or Republican. Obviously, it's bigger than him,
[02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:55.500]  but we have to start prosecuting some of their front people. Right, right. I, I get that.
[02:57:55.500 --> 02:57:59.580]  But it's like if you're in a foxhole, the soldiers climbing in it with a bayonet,
[02:57:59.580 --> 02:58:03.340]  you know, sure, you'd rather be able to remove Hitler from office if you're in World War Two,
[02:58:03.340 --> 02:58:05.900]  Battle the Bulls, but you got to deal with what's coming at you with a bayonet.
[02:58:05.900 --> 02:58:14.620]  That's true. I've been reading the UN manuals agenda 2030. And the way they talk in there,
[02:58:14.620 --> 02:58:18.620]  the language of that. Oh, yeah, I should do more on 2030. We've been reporting on,
[02:58:18.620 --> 02:58:23.260]  now it's on agenda 21. Now they have 2030, the next phase of their evil. Go ahead, sir.
[02:58:24.380 --> 02:58:28.780]  Yeah. And they're, they're, the wording of it, they're, they're actually referring to
[02:58:28.780 --> 02:58:35.900]  the United States and other countries as their countries with their people, but they already
[02:58:35.900 --> 02:58:41.180]  consider this done. Yes, they'll be back folks. Fourth hour in full wars.com. Forced last show.

[02:59:46.860 --> 02:59:53.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:53.580 --> 03:00:17.900]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and
[03:00:17.900 --> 03:00:25.660]  do nothing. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. We now take you live
[03:00:25.660 --> 03:00:33.100]  to the central Texas command center. It's Alex Jones. I want to go to a few more of these
[03:00:33.900 --> 03:00:38.780]  callers but I want to play a little bit of Mark Dice's latest video that's up on info wars.com
[03:00:38.780 --> 03:00:42.540]  and if Jacari and David have time during this next hour, I think we should probably play the
[03:00:42.540 --> 03:00:47.660]  whole thing and they can all obviously have commentary over it. Remember he shows everybody
[03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:52.540]  interviews folks. We go out and do it in Austin. We get eight out of ten saying put gun owners in
[03:00:52.540 --> 03:00:57.820]  FEMA camps, kill kids up to age three if you call it abortion. He gets nine out of ten to do it out
[03:00:57.820 --> 03:01:01.820]  there. So let's play a clip of them saying repeal the bill of rights for Hillary. Here it is.
[03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:07.740]  Hillary Clinton has announced her plan to help repeal the bill of rights for the new world order
[03:01:07.740 --> 03:01:13.500]  and progress America and help with the government. We just need a few more signatures to support the
[03:01:13.500 --> 03:01:19.100]  plan. Just print birth date signature to support Hillary's plan to repeal the bill of rights.
[03:01:19.100 --> 03:01:25.340]  Hillary is the right person to... She's going to lead us. She's going to go in the right direction.
[03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:29.820]  She's in the right direction. We're repealing the bill of rights starting off her campaign
[03:01:30.380 --> 03:01:35.660]  and I think it's about the about time that we support someone who wants to do it. What specific
[03:01:35.660 --> 03:01:41.820]  parts is she going to... Well just to sort of compact them down and modernize them and I really
[03:01:41.820 --> 03:01:45.980]  appreciate... Get them up to date. I'm with you brother. Appreciate your support. Hillary appreciates
[03:01:45.980 --> 03:01:54.060]  your support too. Hillary needs your help. She has a new proposal to repeal the bill of rights
[03:01:54.060 --> 03:02:00.140]  just to help out with the campaign and the democracy. Just need a quick birth date. That's
[03:02:00.140 --> 03:02:04.620]  good. We're going to download that. We're playing that directly off YouTube. It's glitching out right
[03:02:04.620 --> 03:02:09.100]  now through the computers. We have Mac minis in there and I don't want them. We're going to get rid
[03:02:09.100 --> 03:02:13.100]  of them. I've always hated Mac minis. I can't get rid of them. They multiply like... What are the
[03:02:13.100 --> 03:02:22.860]  creatures on trebles? I'm going to start killing the Mac minis with hammers next week. Let me guess.
[03:02:22.860 --> 03:02:29.100]  That was a Mac mini glitching, wasn't it? It was. I knew it. I know even their glitches.
[03:02:29.980 --> 03:02:37.340]  Four years ago, I didn't like them. I'm getting angry. I'm getting angry. Anyways,
[03:02:37.340 --> 03:02:42.860]  the point... We're not rich, but we got the money for computers. A lot of Mac products are fine,
[03:02:42.860 --> 03:02:47.980]  slave goods, but these are real pieces of trash. Anyways, and the people that run Apple are a bunch
[03:02:47.980 --> 03:02:53.340]  of garbage too. How about that? A bunch of fake liberal fascist scum. Mark in California, you're
[03:02:53.340 --> 03:03:03.500]  on the air. Welcome. Max, I'm sorry. I'm so angry. I can't even read now. Common Core says MAX means
[03:03:03.500 --> 03:03:09.580]  Mark, so I'm actually not wrong. Go ahead. That's because of Mark Dyson's work. That's right. Mark,
[03:03:09.580 --> 03:03:16.780]  go ahead. Mark's now spelled MAX. Go ahead. I just want to say on two topics. On the
[03:03:17.660 --> 03:03:23.100]  supermail vitality and the deep cleanse, it's helping me get through a gallbladder
[03:03:23.820 --> 03:03:29.740]  removal that I had. I just want to plug that. It's making me feel great. It's helping my digestion.
[03:03:29.740 --> 03:03:33.420]  What did it do for you? You said you had it removed before, and then when you're on the
[03:03:33.420 --> 03:03:39.900]  products, what happened? I had a gallbladder issue, and it kind of came up suddenly. So,
[03:03:39.900 --> 03:03:45.500]  of course, they suggested surgery, which I, in hindsight, I wish I kept it, but they took it
[03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:54.300]  out. And then after the surgery, I started reading up on how to boost my liver. And then I heard
[03:03:54.300 --> 03:04:02.540]  your show, and you started talking about the powers of the deep cleanse and the liver. And
[03:04:03.180 --> 03:04:08.060]  I read how important that is because it produces the bile and keeps you healthy and digests your
[03:04:08.060 --> 03:04:11.740]  food. Sure. They said it's a conspiracy theory that even needs a gallbladder. You're just supposed
[03:04:11.740 --> 03:04:16.460]  to leave all those stones there and have it chopped out. You'll be able to grab my honor
[03:04:16.460 --> 03:04:21.340]  in the microwave, right? Absolutely. What happened once you started taking, which products did you
[03:04:21.340 --> 03:04:30.700]  take? Well, first, actually, it took the X2. That was the first thing I did. And then
[03:04:31.660 --> 03:04:37.420]  noticed that after the surgery, it felt a little sluggish. Hold on. I'm going to hold you over
[03:04:37.420 --> 03:04:41.260]  and then pass the baton to Jakari. I'm going to come back, let you finish, and they've got a whole
[03:04:41.260 --> 03:04:46.380]  hour to cover a whole bunch of breaking news we haven't gotten to yet. Their review of 13 hours
[03:04:46.380 --> 03:04:49.820]  and more. But stay there because, Max, you called in about renewable energy and futures,
[03:04:49.820 --> 03:04:55.500]  but I do. They're always telling me, hey, people like the testimonials. Why do you cut them off?
[03:04:55.500 --> 03:04:58.460]  Okay, well, I'm not going to get your testimony off. I want to hear what it really did for you.
[03:04:58.460 --> 03:05:02.620]  Party Republicans are now seeing a two-man race between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.
[03:05:02.620 --> 03:05:07.100]  RNC power brokers and donors are now working to get on Trump's good side as they now see him
[03:05:07.100 --> 03:05:11.100]  as the eventual nominee, especially as his reputation expands throughout the Republican
[03:05:11.100 --> 03:05:15.340]  political class. Some of these donors include former Jeb Bush supporters who are now jumping
[03:05:15.340 --> 03:05:19.180]  ship as Bush begins to fade away in obscurity. But they're also courting Cruz who they see
[03:05:19.180 --> 03:05:23.580]  as a stronger challenger to Trump, especially after the sixth GOP debate in which Cruz accused
[03:05:23.580 --> 03:05:27.820]  Trump of once having New York values. That said, numerous people, including Trump himself,
[03:05:27.820 --> 03:05:32.060]  are questioning whether the Canadian-born Cruz meets the status as a natural-born
[03:05:32.060 --> 03:05:36.060]  citizen of the United States, which is one of the eligibility requirements established in
[03:05:36.060 --> 03:05:40.140]  the Constitution for election to the Office of President and Vice President. The establishment
[03:05:40.140 --> 03:05:44.460]  was hoping Marco Rubio would overtake Cruz in the race, but Rubio's love affair with amnesty
[03:05:44.460 --> 03:05:48.940]  for illegal aliens makes him unelectable in the eyes of many Americans. Keep checking back at

[03:07:27.980 --> 03:07:34.460]  feeds at infoworse.com forward slash show, but it is the members that are paying it forward and
[03:07:34.460 --> 03:07:42.620]  helping so many other people see the truth, and it's prisonplanet.tv that finances so much of
[03:07:42.620 --> 03:07:48.380]  the cameras, the equipment, the crew, the reporters. You get exclusive HD, higher quality, get it first,

[03:07:52.860 --> 03:08:05.420]  helping finance to put it out for free to everybody, prisonplanet.tv.
[03:08:11.020 --> 03:08:18.460]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex
[03:08:18.460 --> 03:08:29.260]  Jones. I see your hair is burning. Oh, it's hard to turn this off. Hills are filled with fire.
[03:08:29.260 --> 03:08:36.780]  If they say I never loved you, if they say I never loved you, you know they are a liar.
[03:08:37.740 --> 03:08:43.340]  You know they are a liar. I tell you, I really like it when Jakari hosts the fourth hour,
[03:08:44.540 --> 03:08:47.900]  and you know, Jakari's a little nervous on air, so is David Nighn, and now they just do
[03:08:47.900 --> 03:08:52.140]  as good a job as I do or better. And you know, some folks like the way they host better than I
[03:08:52.140 --> 03:08:55.820]  host it. That's what it is. It's different strokes for different folks. They have different angles,
[03:08:55.820 --> 03:09:00.140]  different perspectives. People sometimes will see them, FullWars.com, and maybe Curt Demo has an
[03:09:00.140 --> 03:09:05.180]  article that partially disagrees with something I've said, or Paul Watson, or vice versa. Paul
[03:09:05.180 --> 03:09:12.140]  Watson thinks the Sandy Hooks just like the way they said it happened. I think it's fake, not the
[03:09:12.140 --> 03:09:16.860]  whole thing, but large parts of it. And you know, that's what a free country is. I'm not here
[03:09:16.860 --> 03:09:21.740]  here. Major newspapers call our reporters and they ask them, they go, so Jones micromanage,
[03:09:21.740 --> 03:09:25.820]  everything you do. It's to the point when I come around and tell folks to do something,
[03:09:25.820 --> 03:09:30.220]  they kind of look at me like, you know, what's this? I told what I want. But they're obviously
[03:09:30.220 --> 03:09:36.300]  libertarians, they're patriots, Christians. I mean, those aren't litmus tests, but that
[03:09:36.300 --> 03:09:41.900]  seems to go with the territory. They're lovers of life, lovers of liberty. And so Jakari and David
[03:09:41.900 --> 03:09:47.740]  not are going to be hosting this fourth hour of what's left of it. I wanted to finish up because if
[03:09:47.740 --> 03:09:53.340]  I encourage this, a lot of people will call in and comment. And then I don't want to really make the
[03:09:53.340 --> 03:09:58.620]  whole show about it. But at the same time, people buy stuff off testimonials. And so I could do less
[03:09:58.620 --> 03:10:03.180]  plugging if occasionally I let people do testimonials. And they know I don't like it. So they'll
[03:10:03.180 --> 03:10:07.100]  sneak it in. It's like Max from California, renewable energy futures. That's what he was
[03:10:07.100 --> 03:10:15.740]  calling about. He was first talking about what X2 did for him. Folks, we know what we're talking
[03:10:15.740 --> 03:10:22.380]  about. We have top experts. We do our research. I don't claim to be Mr. Health Nut Beach Boy,
[03:10:22.940 --> 03:10:26.940]  but I've gone from being in horrible, from being in great shape to horrible shape to pretty good
[03:10:26.940 --> 03:10:31.420]  shape now. And I've done it not so much with the exercise, just four or five years and I was swimming
[03:10:31.420 --> 03:10:35.980]  two miles a day some days and couldn't lose weight. It was the nutraceuticals, the X2,
[03:10:35.980 --> 03:10:43.660]  the oxy powder, the supermail vitality and other M4WarsLife.com products. And if you'll just try
[03:10:43.660 --> 03:10:51.740]  Supermail, if you'll just try X2 for a month, you've supported the broadcast and I've run into
[03:10:51.740 --> 03:10:58.540]  very, very few people that didn't have a big effect with the products. And the few that didn't have
[03:10:58.540 --> 03:11:06.460]  an effect with X2 had it with oxy powder. No one, I know, hasn't had an effect with oxy powder.
[03:11:07.260 --> 03:11:11.980]  Almost no one, I know, has not had when they do the liver cleanse, the gallbladder cleanse,
[03:11:11.980 --> 03:11:16.220]  you know, do it properly and it took an extra day with me and then it was like, I was calling
[03:11:16.220 --> 03:11:20.220]  them and it hadn't happened, it hadn't happened. When it did, it was like, whoa, this was like in
[03:11:20.220 --> 03:11:30.140]  the movie Alien or something. So it really does work and it supports the broadcast. Plus, why
[03:11:30.140 --> 03:11:33.580]  wouldn't I want to sell stuff that really works? Then you come back and buy more. That's why I don't
[03:11:33.580 --> 03:11:37.420]  get so many companies put out crud because they think they're getting away with something selling
[03:11:37.420 --> 03:11:41.100]  a cheap product, making a big profit on a one-time sale. Why wouldn't you want to sell it so many
[03:11:41.100 --> 03:11:47.820]  a hundred times but sees the globalist model of like Chinese slave goods that so many toys,
[03:11:47.820 --> 03:11:53.580]  I won't buy toys from China or places anymore because you look like a cool toy, you buy it for
[03:11:53.580 --> 03:11:59.180]  your kids, I'm a big kid, I like toys and then they break in like an hour or that never works
[03:11:59.900 --> 03:12:04.860]  and you're supposed to be lazy and not take it back or stand in some hour-long line. I'm kind
[03:12:04.860 --> 03:12:09.580]  of ranting. I put out good products because I really care and have a conscience and I care about
[03:12:09.580 --> 03:12:15.180]  people. This is stuff I want to take but then it is true, it would be better for evil people to do
[03:12:15.180 --> 03:12:19.420]  good stuff for them but see they won't do it because their nature is evil is what I'm getting at.
[03:12:19.420 --> 03:12:23.180]  So finishing up Max real quick then we're going to hand the baton over to the other host.
[03:12:24.300 --> 03:12:29.740]  Your uninterrupted start back over, your review of X2 of the other products you took.
[03:12:31.260 --> 03:12:37.100]  Okay start from the top. I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months
[03:12:37.100 --> 03:12:45.660]  and needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, started to get some reading
[03:12:45.660 --> 03:12:49.100]  and I thought it was weird while I was in the hospital. First thing I wanted to do was give
[03:12:49.100 --> 03:12:57.260]  you a hamburger. I was like, I can't digest this. But anyway, so I stumbled on the X2 and the deep
[03:12:57.260 --> 03:13:04.460]  cleanse and you guys with Dr. Gurd having your show and I thought you know I'll give it a try and
[03:13:04.460 --> 03:13:11.980]  I was already always big into probiotics anyway so that was helping me out somewhat but I needed
[03:13:11.980 --> 03:13:18.700]  the deep talks basically and that's when I got out of one of your shows and your stuff on your
[03:13:18.700 --> 03:13:26.540]  info war site and so it took about two weeks. I started taking the X2 first for about seven days
[03:13:26.540 --> 03:13:34.860]  and then I did the deep cleanse and after two weeks I noticed a significant change in my
[03:13:34.860 --> 03:13:41.340]  digestive flow. I was like really more natural and I know it's funny to talk about it. I did
[03:13:41.340 --> 03:13:46.540]  intend to talk about energy but I wanted to start with energy, human energy and they built a
[03:13:46.540 --> 03:13:53.260]  renewable since we're having that gas leak out here in Southern California that is basically
[03:13:53.260 --> 03:13:57.900]  it's like they're saying it's bigger than what happened in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:13:58.620 --> 03:14:05.260]  So we need to go to renewable energy just like we need to renew our human energy.
[03:14:05.260 --> 03:14:08.620]  Absolutely, I appreciate your call sir. God bless you and thank you for the support.
[03:14:09.260 --> 03:14:14.140]  Yeah, we can't give a lot of the testimonials. In fact, a lot of the reviews we get are just
[03:14:14.140 --> 03:14:23.340]  too incredible so we don't even put them on the site. So many people are starved for X2, for true iodine,
[03:14:24.220 --> 03:14:29.100]  for pure iodine. They're starved for the things that are in things like supermail.
[03:14:29.660 --> 03:14:34.220]  Just go research the thing for yourself. Finally, then I'm passing the baton. There's a video up
[03:14:34.220 --> 03:14:41.660]  on infowars.com. There's a video titled Alex Jones' Anti-Sports Rant. Major sports uses
[03:14:41.660 --> 03:14:46.620]  modern Roman Coliseum. I mean it's admitted that that's happening and some of the commenters are
[03:14:46.620 --> 03:14:52.540]  criticizing me saying you ought to try some sports and stuff like that and this obsessive,
[03:14:52.540 --> 03:14:56.940]  super serious, more informed than thou attitude doesn't do the Liberty Movement any good. 82
[03:14:56.940 --> 03:15:03.900]  times a year I go watch hockey. Nobody said you're bad watching games. I said most of the people
[03:15:03.900 --> 03:15:09.180]  that aren't involved and don't care are obsessed with TV, entertainment, video games and then
[03:15:09.180 --> 03:15:15.020]  don't care about what's happening in the world. You need R&R. I need R&R. You didn't watch the video.
[03:15:16.220 --> 03:15:21.420]  All I said is the NFL and stuff is full of anti-gun propaganda now too and it's full of
[03:15:23.740 --> 03:15:28.460]  all this anti-mail product placement. The Super Bowl last year had like what five ads
[03:15:28.460 --> 03:15:34.860]  putting down fathers and then the games on father's day did as well. I mean it's crazy
[03:15:34.860 --> 03:15:41.420]  and the Pentagon paying them for all this war propaganda. It's a big deal and the more corrupt
[03:15:41.420 --> 03:15:45.580]  society gets the more obsessed it is with sports and gambling and that's what I was getting at.
[03:15:45.580 --> 03:15:50.140]  That's another topic for our host. All right Jakari you guys take over and then of course
[03:15:50.140 --> 03:15:54.140]  we've got the nightly news tonight 7 o'clock central with another one of the great crew
[03:15:54.140 --> 03:15:58.060]  hosting that and I'll be filing a report for the news as well but I hand the baton over to
[03:15:58.060 --> 03:16:03.180]  Jakari Jackson and David Knight so from the war room to the situation room I'll see you back here
[03:16:03.180 --> 03:16:08.220]  tomorrow. I'll be watching just like you are. All right thank you so much Alex. Now coming up in
[03:16:08.220 --> 03:16:11.740]  this hour we will be taking your calls a little bit later. I know some of our callers have been
[03:16:11.740 --> 03:16:16.860]  holding for quite a while but first we're going to start off with a movie review of 13 hours I
[03:16:16.860 --> 03:16:21.740]  have David Knight in studio with me and just to lay a little bit of the groundwork on this film.
[03:16:21.740 --> 03:16:25.660]  To anybody who hasn't seen the film it doesn't know exactly what it's about. It's 13 hours.
[03:16:25.660 --> 03:16:31.100]  It's called the secret soldiers of Benghazi. It's about the Benghazi attacks obviously that
[03:16:31.100 --> 03:16:36.060]  claimed the life of Ambassador Stevens and I'll say a little bit about this before we get David
[03:16:36.060 --> 03:16:40.540]  Knight's commentary. One of the most controversial moments in the film one of the most debated
[03:16:40.540 --> 03:16:47.100]  moments in the film is when the operators there in Benghazi are ready to go give the assistance
[03:16:47.100 --> 03:16:54.060]  to Ambassador Stevens in his security detail and they're told to stand down. Now a former CIA chief
[03:16:54.060 --> 03:17:00.540]  in Benghazi has come out and said that the movie is not exactly accurate. It says this is a Washington
[03:17:00.540 --> 03:17:05.980]  post article according to the officer in charge of the CIA's Benghazi base that night. The scene in
[03:17:05.980 --> 03:17:12.620]  the movie is entirely untrue. There was never a stand down order. The base chief known as Bob
[03:17:12.620 --> 03:17:18.220]  said publicly for the first time and no time did I ever second guess that the team would depart.
[03:17:19.100 --> 03:17:25.820]  So that is Bob the CIA director out there in Benghazi's take. Now let's take a look at this
[03:17:25.820 --> 03:17:31.020]  Fox News clip where they actually talked to the men who were in Benghazi that night and they say
[03:17:31.020 --> 03:17:36.060]  a different story than what Bob had to say. Do you guys have that queued up? You can hear the
[03:17:36.060 --> 03:17:41.260]  distress calls. You can hear the radio calls of the State Department personnel saying we're going
[03:17:41.260 --> 03:17:47.100]  to die. We're going to die. We're going to die. The CIA station chief where you were at the time
[03:17:47.820 --> 03:17:53.740]  told you repeatedly according to the movie stand down. We saw that in the trailer. Use the words
[03:17:53.740 --> 03:17:59.340]  stand down. Is that how you remember it? Yeah, I mean. All right. Thank you so much. That's enough
[03:17:59.340 --> 03:18:04.620]  of that. So there we have it, David Knight. We just saw the clip of the gentlemen who were actually
[03:18:04.620 --> 03:18:08.940]  in Benghazi that night who said they were told to stand down. So do you believe these gentlemen or
[03:18:08.940 --> 03:18:14.780]  do you believe Bob? I believe the guys who are there. I believe the guys who put their faces on
[03:18:14.780 --> 03:18:19.980]  television, who gave their names, who have their reputation at stake, rather than an anonymous
[03:18:19.980 --> 03:18:25.100]  bureaucratic source, a single source who has a vested interest in saying, no, no, no, I'm not
[03:18:25.100 --> 03:18:29.260]  responsible for the murder of those people. As they pointed out in the film, by holding them up for
[03:18:29.260 --> 03:18:35.100]  20 minutes from giving relief to the outpost there because it's not an embassy. That's one of the
[03:18:35.100 --> 03:18:40.060]  things you and I were both surprised at how unfortified and unsecured this area was. This is
[03:18:40.060 --> 03:18:45.180]  basically a resort house. Exactly. And it's some distance from where the CIA compound that later
[03:18:45.180 --> 03:18:50.460]  came under attack was by holding them for 20 minutes. They said, you're turning this from a
[03:18:50.460 --> 03:18:56.620]  rescue mission into a suicide mission. So we've heard the version from Hillary. We've heard the
[03:18:56.620 --> 03:19:02.060]  version from the CIA. And what this movie tells and what the book that is based on tells is the
[03:19:02.060 --> 03:19:08.300]  version from the soldiers who fought and died to save lives there. Many of them died unnecessarily
[03:19:08.300 --> 03:19:13.500]  because the thing that is driven home by the fact that it is 13 hours that elapses in this
[03:19:13.500 --> 03:19:17.980]  is the fact that the repeated calls for any kind of assistance from the federal government,
[03:19:17.980 --> 03:19:22.620]  from the bureaucracy would not be listened to. And as they're pointing out, you see these overhead
[03:19:22.620 --> 03:19:27.980]  drones taking video and identifying where the attacks are coming in. And they say, they're seeing
[03:19:27.980 --> 03:19:33.500]  the same feeds we are, and they won't send any relief. Now, when we come back, I'd like to talk
[03:19:33.500 --> 03:19:38.700]  about what Hillary Clinton knew and when she knew it. And I want people to because they don't talk
[03:19:38.700 --> 03:19:42.540]  about Hillary Clinton by name. They don't talk about Obama. They don't even mention the State
[03:19:42.540 --> 03:19:47.820]  Department withholding this. But we need to look at the lies that she told after this happened.
[03:19:47.820 --> 03:19:50.780]  All right, very good. Stay tuned. We will have more of that coming up next.
[03:19:59.260 --> 03:20:05.180]  Are you sneezing, coughing and aching? Do you have a sore throat, a fever or the sniffles?

[03:21:01.980 --> 03:21:06.300]  and CEO of ID Stronghold. By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you
[03:21:06.300 --> 03:21:10.540]  from electronic pickpocketing. Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying
[03:21:10.540 --> 03:21:14.780]  eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in
[03:21:14.780 --> 03:21:19.980]  radio chip called RFID. I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[03:21:20.700 --> 03:21:24.700]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, US passports,
[03:21:24.700 --> 03:21:30.060]  hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID. It was then I formed
[03:21:30.060 --> 03:21:34.700]  ID Stronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world. There are a lot of
[03:21:34.700 --> 03:21:39.660]  misconceptions out there today about RFID. I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[03:21:40.380 --> 03:21:44.940]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you need
[03:21:44.940 --> 03:21:49.420]  to protect your personal financial data. You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct

[03:24:10.140 --> 03:24:15.420]  hour, Jakari Jackson. Joining me in studio is David Knight, and we're giving our review of 13 hours
[03:24:15.420 --> 03:24:20.140]  of The Secret Soldiers of Ngozi. Now, we were talking before the break, and one of the things
[03:24:20.140 --> 03:24:25.260]  that's interesting about this film, David, they don't directly address Hillary Clinton or Barack
[03:24:25.260 --> 03:24:29.340]  Obama, but there is a scene in the film where Ambassador Stevens is, I guess he's riding his
[03:24:29.340 --> 03:24:34.380]  cables, his memos, and he sent them out to a person who we can assume is Hillary Clinton.
[03:24:34.380 --> 03:24:39.340]  Yeah, but they don't touch on the arms transfer story that is behind all this. We've had
[03:24:39.340 --> 03:24:44.060]  numerous sources talking to us about the secret arms transfer going on. Steve Pachennick,
[03:24:44.060 --> 03:24:48.780]  Anthony Schaefer, others pointing out what's really going on. But I want to talk a little bit
[03:24:48.780 --> 03:24:53.980]  about, well, first of all, let's just briefly say that if you like action films, this is a great
[03:24:53.980 --> 03:24:59.180]  action film. If you like Black Hawk Down, you'll like this a lot. It's not a boring movie at all.
[03:24:59.180 --> 03:25:05.100]  No, and I would, a very, very fast-paced, amazing action film. If your wife doesn't want to go see
[03:25:05.100 --> 03:25:10.620]  it, offer to go see Pride and Prejudice or something with her. You can go see this. You should see
[03:25:10.620 --> 03:25:15.580]  this. And when I mentioned Black Hawk Down, I think people ought to remember that the last
[03:25:15.580 --> 03:25:20.540]  time we saw a betrayal that was very similar to this was at the beginning of the Bill Clinton
[03:25:20.540 --> 03:25:25.420]  administration and the Battle of Mogadishu that Black Hawk Down is about. So there's your connection
[03:25:25.420 --> 03:25:30.860]  there with that. Of course, Hillary Clinton says she doesn't plan to see this Benghazi movie. She's
[03:25:30.860 --> 03:25:36.380]  just too busy campaigning. I think it's interesting as these emails are coming out, Jakari. We have
[03:25:36.380 --> 03:25:42.780]  stories now about email surfacing to her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, the night of the Benghazi attacks.
[03:25:42.780 --> 03:25:49.660]  She tells her daughter, Chelsea, two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al-Qaeda-like
[03:25:49.660 --> 03:25:53.820]  group. I fear more of the same tomorrow. Yeah, because she's not about to send any help.
[03:25:53.820 --> 03:26:00.300]  Yes. Okay. And she knows that this isn't about this phony narrative that they sold people about it
[03:26:00.300 --> 03:26:05.020]  being a protest of a movie that nobody had ever heard of, nobody had ever seen. They addressed
[03:26:05.020 --> 03:26:08.700]  that in the film. And the guys, the guy just sitting, I mean, we don't give the whole spoilers,
[03:26:08.700 --> 03:26:11.740]  but there's a scene where the guy just sitting on the roof and I guess they got called his wife
[03:26:11.740 --> 03:26:15.980]  or something. He said, yeah, back home. They're saying this off some movies, some anti-Muslim movie.
[03:26:15.980 --> 03:26:19.820]  There's some protests. He goes, I didn't see any protests. The guy says, there were no protests.
[03:26:19.820 --> 03:26:24.220]  No. Okay, let's make that clear. And nobody had ever seen or heard of that film. But of course,
[03:26:24.220 --> 03:26:28.300]  they locked up the filmmaker. Listen, when they start locking up filmmakers, you know,
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:33.900]  they're pushing war. Woodrow Wilson did that in 1917. The second person got locked up with the
[03:26:33.900 --> 03:26:39.740]  Espionage Act. Okay, it was a filmmaker and he'd made a film called The Spirit of 1776,
[03:26:40.300 --> 03:26:43.980]  criticizing the way the British had conducted themselves. Okay, whether that was true or
[03:26:43.980 --> 03:26:48.700]  not, Woodrow Wilson didn't want anything that would hurt his war effort. Okay, so here we go
[03:26:49.260 --> 03:26:53.660]  with the innocence of Muslims talking about this. But I want to go to these other emails.
[03:26:53.660 --> 03:27:00.380]  Sidney Blumenthal in a second memo the day after this attack said, sensitive sources in Libya
[03:27:00.380 --> 03:27:07.020]  had said that Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaeda-backed terror group, had planned the attacks for a month
[03:27:07.020 --> 03:27:12.540]  and had used the protest as a cover. But she also goes on to say that there wasn't any protests.
[03:27:12.540 --> 03:27:18.060]  She said, I just heard an NPR report about CIA station chief and Tripoli sending a cable on 912
[03:27:18.060 --> 03:27:23.260]  saying there was no demo, no, no protests. In other words, what do you know about this? Okay,
[03:27:23.260 --> 03:27:27.820]  meanwhile, she's still selling two days after this happened. I went back and looked at a
[03:27:27.820 --> 03:27:34.380]  September 13, 2012 article from Business Insider where she says, this film is just disgusting
[03:27:34.380 --> 03:27:38.140]  and reprehensible. Let me state very clearly, and I hope it's obvious, the U.S. government had
[03:27:38.140 --> 03:27:42.300]  nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its content, its message. I know it's hard for
[03:27:42.300 --> 03:27:47.500]  some people to understand why the U.S. cannot or does not prevent these kinds of reprehensible
[03:27:47.500 --> 03:27:51.740]  videos from ever seeing the light of day. Oh, maybe we can censor them like Woodrow Wilson,
[03:27:51.740 --> 03:27:59.740]  okay? But it is a totally false, fake, lie propaganda to try to redirect attention away
[03:27:59.740 --> 03:28:05.180]  from their arms transfer away from the betrayal of these people. That's what this film focuses on,
[03:28:05.180 --> 03:28:09.100]  simply the soldier's story. It doesn't get into all the backstory, the arm transfer.
[03:28:09.100 --> 03:28:13.020]  Their point of view. Exactly. And that's what's important about this. And that's what really
[03:28:13.020 --> 03:28:18.700]  gets hammered down is the betrayal, the unnecessary dying and suffering that people suffered from
[03:28:18.700 --> 03:28:24.220]  this because they wouldn't even allow them to send a flyover of F-16s to make them think that
[03:28:24.220 --> 03:28:27.820]  reinforcements are on the way to back them off. That's what they'd asked for. Couldn't even get
[03:28:27.820 --> 03:28:33.020]  that from them. Yeah, because they weren't supposed to be there. So you can send these guys out there
[03:28:33.020 --> 03:28:36.780]  because it may cause some type of international incident. Meanwhile, you already have an international
[03:28:36.780 --> 03:28:41.500]  incident because they're trying to kill Ambassador Stevens. Yeah. So you've got a bureaucracy,
[03:28:41.500 --> 03:28:48.220]  like the CIA or what? And they've got this immoral, unstated objective that's going on here, okay?
[03:28:48.220 --> 03:28:51.740]  They don't have clear objectives. And I've seen this my entire life, going back to Vietnam,
[03:28:51.740 --> 03:28:55.980]  the way they betrayed soldiers in Vietnam for a war that wasn't necessary, the war that was
[03:28:55.980 --> 03:29:02.940]  based on a lie, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as Robert McNamara confessed in the fog of war,
[03:29:02.940 --> 03:29:08.300]  Narrow Morris documentary. That never happened, okay? And so they have this war going on. They
[03:29:08.300 --> 03:29:12.300]  have this phony idea that they're selling everybody about the domino theory, okay?
[03:29:12.300 --> 03:29:16.620]  They would go in, they put these people at risk. They would let them fight these horrific battles
[03:29:16.620 --> 03:29:20.780]  and then just pull out and give the enemy back the territory that they just fought over.
[03:29:20.780 --> 03:29:26.540]  That's the way they have used people. When you fight for an incorrupt immoral government,
[03:29:26.540 --> 03:29:30.860]  they will kill you as well. And that's what we need to get people to understand.
[03:29:30.860 --> 03:29:35.500]  Do not fight these wars for them. Absolutely. And you don't have to believe us. You can go listen
[03:29:35.500 --> 03:29:39.580]  to the interviews from the soldiers themselves that were on the ground in Benghazi. Stay tuned.
[03:29:39.580 --> 03:29:50.780]  We'll have more on this right after this break. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.580 --> 03:29:54.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:29:58.460 --> 03:30:02.300]  Several gas stations in Michigan have lowered their gas prices to under one dollar per gallon,
[03:30:02.300 --> 03:30:07.260]  with one station as low as 78 cents per gallon. Meanwhile, across the U.S., oil is so plentiful
[03:30:07.260 --> 03:30:11.260]  and cheap that at least one buyer said it would actually need to be paid to refine oil. Flint
[03:30:11.260 --> 03:30:16.060]  Hill Resources, a refinery owned by the Koch brothers, said it wants 50 cents a barrel Friday for
[03:30:16.060 --> 03:30:20.700]  North Dakota Sour, a high-grade sulfur grade of crude, according to a list price posted on its
[03:30:20.700 --> 03:30:26.940]  website. In comparison, the refinery was paying $13.50 a barrel a year ago and $47.60 in January
[03:30:26.940 --> 03:30:32.460]  2014. Overall, U.S. benchmark oil prices have collapsed more than 70% in the past 18 months
[03:30:32.460 --> 03:30:37.020]  and fell below $30 a barrel for the first time in 12 years last week. West Texas Intermediate
[03:30:37.020 --> 03:30:41.100]  was already trading their $29 in New York on Monday. This will lead to the collapse of major
[03:30:41.100 --> 03:30:44.780]  oil companies and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs, meaning the economic compression is
[03:30:44.780 --> 03:30:48.780]  likely. In other words, the global oversupply of oil has now reached the point that the market is
[03:30:48.780 --> 03:30:52.540]  effectively forcing producers to pay them to give their oil away. Otherwise, the oil will simply
[03:30:52.540 --> 03:30:56.620]  sit in bloated source facilities or on tankers parked out in the ocean. This is Kit Daniels

[03:33:01.740 --> 03:33:10.540]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:33:14.540 --> 03:33:18.700]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm your host for this hour, Jakara Jackson. I'm joined
[03:33:18.700 --> 03:33:23.260]  in studio by David Knight. I'm going to take some of your calls now. We have Joe in Texas. You want
[03:33:23.260 --> 03:33:27.900]  to talk about the movie 13 hours that we've been giving our review on. It says that you are a U.S.
[03:33:27.900 --> 03:33:33.500]  security contractor? Yeah, I've worked in security contracting since 2008.
[03:33:34.380 --> 03:33:41.500]  Okay, so what's your view on the film 13 hours? Well, I was lucky enough to attend the premiere
[03:33:41.500 --> 03:33:48.940]  in Dallas the other night, and I was actually very impressed with Michael Bay's execution of the film.
[03:33:48.940 --> 03:33:57.260]  I thought that he did a really good job in really diving into the community itself,
[03:33:57.260 --> 03:34:05.740]  kind of the post-spec ops community, and that culture, and understanding the closest that
[03:34:05.740 --> 03:34:12.300]  these guys have. And most often, it's guys who have families at home. These guys are looking for
[03:34:12.300 --> 03:34:16.140]  a way to kind of get back on their feet financially, a thought that they showed,
[03:34:16.140 --> 03:34:21.260]  really captured that in the film. So a lot of these guys have a lot of skin in the game,
[03:34:21.260 --> 03:34:25.020]  and they're just trying to make it, especially in a downed economy.
[03:34:25.020 --> 03:34:30.620]  Exactly. Every one of them, they showed a family that they had back home pretty much,
[03:34:30.620 --> 03:34:33.900]  or at least the key characters. You know that they've got young children back home,
[03:34:33.900 --> 03:34:40.300]  and they're Skyping, as this is happening. They're able to have conversations via Skype
[03:34:40.300 --> 03:34:45.820]  with family, with children back home, which drives it really home. As you pointed out,
[03:34:45.820 --> 03:34:48.460]  again, they've got in the game. Now, Joe, I want to ask you,
[03:34:49.900 --> 03:34:54.300]  the CIA keeps saying that there is no stand down order. Do you have any view on that?
[03:34:56.380 --> 03:35:01.500]  Well, I don't know anything about that. And all I can say is that I personally know Chris
[03:35:01.500 --> 03:35:09.580]  Peronto and a lot of other guys that are involved in this. And for me, I have a close
[03:35:09.580 --> 03:35:16.940]  relationship with the guys on the ground. So I have a tendency to believe what they say.
[03:35:16.940 --> 03:35:23.580]  I wasn't there. I don't know how that went down. But that's kind of how I feel about it.
[03:35:23.580 --> 03:35:32.140]  And I was actually in Iraq while this was going down, and we were kind of waiting to see if there
[03:35:32.140 --> 03:35:37.740]  would be more attacks, and how far they would be carried out, whether they were going to be
[03:35:37.740 --> 03:35:43.100]  in any Iraq or anything like that. So what do you think about that? What do you think about the
[03:35:43.100 --> 03:35:48.620]  fact that it took so long before they got any kind of assistance? And what's your opinion on that?
[03:35:49.660 --> 03:35:55.500]  Yeah. So, you know, whenever it goes from just basic, I think, operations,
[03:35:56.380 --> 03:36:02.380]  and the security team takes orders to a certain point. And then at some point, there's a turnover.
[03:36:02.380 --> 03:36:09.180]  And so obviously, from my perspective, without being there, it seems like there was a hesitancy
[03:36:09.180 --> 03:36:17.580]  in transferring that authority. And just like they say in the film, I mean, anybody knows this,
[03:36:17.580 --> 03:36:23.980]  is that time is everything. You have to have that element of surprise. And these guys were
[03:36:23.980 --> 03:36:32.860]  already getting attacked. So it was absolutely key. So minutes are everything. I think you guys
[03:36:32.860 --> 03:36:39.580]  mentioned it earlier. It goes from being a rescue to a suicide. And so it seems like,
[03:36:39.580 --> 03:36:41.740]  obviously, for some people, that's the way it went down.
[03:36:41.740 --> 03:36:46.940]  And it seemed to me, like in the Battle of Mogadishu, there were political considerations
[03:36:46.940 --> 03:36:50.620]  that were far more important than the lives of the people that were serving the government.
[03:36:50.620 --> 03:36:55.180]  In the Battle of Mogadishu, they were very concerned about having a very, very small footprint,
[03:36:55.180 --> 03:36:59.500]  so they didn't give them sufficient resources to protect them. And we're reluctant to commit
[03:36:59.500 --> 03:37:03.660]  those resources. They seem like in this movie, you heard the same sort of thing.
[03:37:05.820 --> 03:37:11.260]  Yeah, just in that way. And unfortunately, because of the way, you know, politics are in
[03:37:11.260 --> 03:37:13.900]  the world and where we're supposed to be and where we're not supposed to be,
[03:37:13.900 --> 03:37:21.980]  then budgets can't be allocated or resources. And then you just have what you have in that
[03:37:21.980 --> 03:37:28.300]  situation. And, you know, you try to get the best equipment and the best guys. And ultimately,
[03:37:29.020 --> 03:37:34.940]  you may look around and be somewhere where you got five, six, maybe 10 guys with you that are
[03:37:34.940 --> 03:37:38.860]  good, solid guys, and you're just going to do the best job that you can to make sure that
[03:37:38.860 --> 03:37:44.700]  everybody makes it home. Well, thank you for letting us know how that that looked from the
[03:37:44.700 --> 03:37:49.100]  perspective of somebody who's actually been there, because, you know, we can't have any way to
[03:37:49.100 --> 03:37:54.140]  validate that. I assume that they would go through and be very careful to get consultants that would
[03:37:54.140 --> 03:37:58.940]  give them an accurate view of that. But what do you make of this narrative that was sold for several
[03:37:58.940 --> 03:38:05.660]  days about this being a reaction to that silly film, The Innocence of Muslims? Right. So,
[03:38:05.660 --> 03:38:09.340]  yeah, I mean, we watched that kind of unfold also. It seemed,
[03:38:11.900 --> 03:38:17.500]  you know, I can only tell you my perspective. I mean, like I said, I was watching from Baghdad,
[03:38:17.500 --> 03:38:23.900]  and it seemed a little strange that that was the reason for it.
[03:38:26.620 --> 03:38:32.060]  It'd be like riding over a South Park episode. I remember when that happened, we thought it was
[03:38:32.060 --> 03:38:36.380]  absolutely laughable and ludicrous. And I think it's interesting now that we see these
[03:38:36.380 --> 03:38:41.180]  Hillary Clinton emails being revealed that she didn't believe it either.
[03:38:43.500 --> 03:38:47.980]  Right. Yeah, I mean, yeah, obviously, it seems that way. Once you've looked at the
[03:38:47.980 --> 03:38:53.100]  different information that's been reported. You know, that's another thing that the movie
[03:38:53.100 --> 03:38:59.420]  did really well is just really when it comes down to it. You know, they said it in Black Hawk
[03:38:59.420 --> 03:39:03.660]  down to is that once the shooting starts, all the politics got the door. I mean, the guys on the
[03:39:03.660 --> 03:39:10.940]  ground that the mission is to they're, they're protecting each other, you know, because everybody
[03:39:10.940 --> 03:39:16.300]  knows that they, like I said, most of these guys have families at home and everybody, you know,
[03:39:16.300 --> 03:39:21.980]  is there engaged in the moment they're there to do a job. But ultimately, you're, you know,
[03:39:21.980 --> 03:39:26.220]  you just, you're facing an enemy and you're trying to get back home to your family. Sure.
[03:39:26.220 --> 03:39:30.860]  Sure. All right. Well, thank you so much, Joe in Texas. Now, we will continue with our calls,
[03:39:30.860 --> 03:39:35.660]  but we want to intersperse a little bit of video here. So take the time and I'm actually going
[03:39:35.660 --> 03:39:40.220]  to look at the Democratic debate that happened this past weekend. And we're going to start with
[03:39:40.220 --> 03:39:45.500]  this clip from Bernie Sanders. And he's talking about the debate is over. Climate change is real.
[03:39:45.500 --> 03:39:50.860]  And the thing that's interesting to me about this clip isn't so much Bernie Sanders response.
[03:39:50.860 --> 03:39:55.260]  It's how the question was asked by the host, I believe it was Lester Holt. Let's go ahead and
[03:39:55.260 --> 03:40:02.060]  take a look at that video. Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices
[03:40:02.060 --> 03:40:06.860]  plummeted. How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that
[03:40:06.860 --> 03:40:11.500]  they need to change their behavior? I think we already are younger generation understands that
[03:40:11.500 --> 03:40:18.700]  instinctively I was home in Burlington, Vermont on Christmas Eve. The temperature was 65 degrees.
[03:40:18.700 --> 03:40:23.260]  People in Vermont know what's going on. People who did ice fishing where their ice is no longer
[03:40:23.260 --> 03:40:28.220]  there on the lake understand what's going on. I'm on both the environmental and energy committees.
[03:40:28.220 --> 03:40:33.900]  The debate is over. Climate change is real. Okay, that's good. Thank you guys. Now,
[03:40:34.460 --> 03:40:38.620]  if you notice how you answered the question as the guys queue up this next clip from the official
[03:40:38.620 --> 03:40:44.540]  Bernie Sanders campaign, he says Americans are going out and buying all these SUVs. Don't you
[03:40:44.540 --> 03:40:48.540]  think there's something wrong with this? Should we go out here and try to make people understand
[03:40:48.540 --> 03:40:52.540]  what's wrong with these SUVs? Now, if you're listening on the radio, I will narrate this
[03:40:52.540 --> 03:40:58.300]  next clip. Let's go ahead and play this. This is an official Bernie Sanders campaign video,
[03:40:58.300 --> 03:41:03.260]  and you can see a Bernie Sanders riding in a vehicle here. Stop right there. There is Bernie
[03:41:03.260 --> 03:41:09.340]  Sanders stepping out of an SUV. Mr. Sanders, we have a big issue with all these people riding
[03:41:09.340 --> 03:41:15.660]  around in SUVs. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders is riding around and what you guessed it, an SUV.
[03:41:15.660 --> 03:41:21.500]  And I would imagine too that when these guys go out on trips in BC, they have some type of big SUV
[03:41:21.500 --> 03:41:25.580]  or satellite truck. Matter of fact, I know they do because I've seen them multiple times on location.
[03:41:26.140 --> 03:41:31.100]  And there's nothing wrong with that because being on these trips, when we go out to California,
[03:41:31.100 --> 03:41:36.300]  wherever we go, we rent a Suburban or whatever. We got so many guys, so many gear, so much gear,
[03:41:36.300 --> 03:41:40.220]  we have to get it all into the vehicle. So yes, you do need a larger vehicle. So I just thought
[03:41:40.220 --> 03:41:46.620]  it was rather humorous. The way they slipped it in there trying to shame you into getting a Prius,
[03:41:46.620 --> 03:41:50.700]  you're not going to fit all your camera equipment into a little Prius. I'm pretty sure the guys that
[03:41:50.700 --> 03:41:57.260]  NBC know that. Let's return to our calls. We have James in Ohio. You have been holding for quite a
[03:41:57.260 --> 03:42:09.500]  while. You want to talk about US and Iran. Go ahead. James in Ohio. Okay. So I guess, you there, James?
[03:42:10.620 --> 03:42:17.980]  Yes. Alex asked earlier, and he said he's not a boat master, how these ships ended up in Iranian
[03:42:17.980 --> 03:42:22.860]  waters. But after being in the Naval Secret Air Corps growing up and my dad actually owns the
[03:42:22.860 --> 03:42:33.100]  marina. If you're lost at sea, it's simple. You drop the anchor. And I just wanted to point that
[03:42:33.100 --> 03:42:38.700]  out. That's all you have to do. All right. Well, thank you so much, James. No, how did you have
[03:42:38.700 --> 03:42:45.020]  anything else you want to add to that? Oh, that's all. All right. Thank you. I know that I was trying
[03:42:45.020 --> 03:42:50.140]  to get to you a little earlier. Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Well, thank you, James, for your
[03:42:50.140 --> 03:42:55.660]  comment. Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Illinois. You want to talk about the Rapture. And before
[03:42:55.660 --> 03:43:05.420]  we go to Dan, I'll give the number out. It is 1-800-259-9231. Once again, it is 1-800-259-9231.
[03:43:05.420 --> 03:43:15.420]  Go ahead, Dan. Okay. Oh, Illinois. I met you guys at the training station back in September
[03:43:15.420 --> 03:43:20.860]  before you was taken off on the Amtrak. Yes, I recall. That was me in the Obama mask. Yeah,
[03:43:20.860 --> 03:43:27.980]  you called before, hadn't I? Sorry about the crappy video. People have been complaining about that on
[03:43:27.980 --> 03:43:37.100]  my YouTube channel. But yeah, I was disagreed with Alex about the Rapture. I wanted to talk to him
[03:43:37.100 --> 03:43:42.620]  directly. He's not available right now. He's out doing other projects, but you can make your point
[03:43:42.620 --> 03:43:49.980]  if you'd like to. Well, I could give you my phone number. He can call me whenever he's available.
[03:43:49.980 --> 03:43:54.700]  Well, honestly, sir, I don't think he's going to call you. So just you just have to call back
[03:43:54.700 --> 03:44:00.540]  another day when he's available. Thank you so much, Dan. Now I want to go on to a few articles I have
[03:44:00.540 --> 03:44:05.660]  here. I want to talk about Mrs. Clinton because we've been talking about the Mugazi movie. And
[03:44:05.660 --> 03:44:11.180]  as we said, Mrs. Clinton is not directly addressed, but they do have a scene in the movie where I
[03:44:11.180 --> 03:44:16.220]  believe they are referencing her. You see Ambassador Stevens. He's sitting there typing out his cables,
[03:44:16.220 --> 03:44:20.300]  typing out his memos. He's saying, hey, I don't have enough security out here. So while Hillary's
[03:44:20.300 --> 03:44:24.940]  in the news, I want to talk about Hillary and politics. And I have this article here from
[03:44:24.940 --> 03:44:30.700]  prisonplanet.com. Hillary, I know how much money influences political decision making. And this is
[03:44:30.700 --> 03:44:35.740]  something that is very interesting to me because if you guys recall the first GLP debate, I thought
[03:44:35.740 --> 03:44:43.260]  the single greatest highlight from that piece was the fact that a number on Sanders, Donald Trump
[03:44:43.260 --> 03:44:48.700]  said that how he pretty much controls politicians, right? He says, I give money to Hillary Clinton.
[03:44:48.700 --> 03:44:52.860]  I give money to whoever and then I call them up in the midnight hour and they do pretty much
[03:44:52.860 --> 03:44:58.540]  whatever I want them to do. So when everybody's talking about how Trump was fighting with Megan
[03:44:58.540 --> 03:45:02.860]  Kelly and all this other silliness, nobody really called him out on that. Had I been a moderator in
[03:45:02.860 --> 03:45:06.300]  that debate, I said, hold on, Mr. Trump, what are you talking about? Because we always know,
[03:45:06.300 --> 03:45:10.060]  we always hear about these people, the guy behind the curtain, right? The smoke filled room,
[03:45:10.060 --> 03:45:15.420]  the guy with the money. Trump is saying that to an extent he is the money man or a money man,
[03:45:15.420 --> 03:45:21.020]  driving these political situations. But nobody wants to talk about that, how much this money
[03:45:21.020 --> 03:45:24.780]  actually influences the politics. So I thought that was a very good article that is available
[03:45:24.780 --> 03:45:32.460]  on the prison plan as well as infowars.com. Let's go ahead and talk to Hillary. Wow, Hillary. And
[03:45:32.460 --> 03:45:39.580]  was that Washington? You want to talk about Trump being banned from the UK? Hillary.
[03:45:39.580 --> 03:45:48.780]  Okay, I guess we lost Hillary. Let's go ahead and go now to Kyle in Arizona. You also want to
[03:45:48.780 --> 03:45:55.420]  talk about the 13 hours movie. Go ahead, Kyle. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Okay, you know what?
[03:45:55.420 --> 03:45:59.660]  First of all, it's an honor speaking to you guys. Tell Alex Jones, I send my regards.
[03:46:00.220 --> 03:46:05.100]  Just walked out of the movie wearing my Hillary for prison t-shirt. Awesome. It was awesome.
[03:46:05.100 --> 03:46:09.980]  But let me just get back to what you said that the movie doesn't show Hillary yet.
[03:46:10.700 --> 03:46:15.180]  It kind of referenced to her. Let me just tell you, from my optic listening to the Alex Jones
[03:46:15.180 --> 03:46:21.980]  show and just being brainwashed my whole life and waking up, you could obviously see what was
[03:46:21.980 --> 03:46:26.300]  happening behind the curtains, even though it wasn't there in front of your face. And my applause,
[03:46:26.300 --> 03:46:31.180]  go to Michael Bay. He's a patriot, I think. Yeah, well, because I'll let you finish your point.
[03:46:31.180 --> 03:46:35.580]  Just anybody who's put off, you hear Michael Bay and some people don't like the Transformers movies
[03:46:35.580 --> 03:46:40.380]  or whatever. This is not that. This is a whole different level of action movie. It's a very well
[03:46:40.380 --> 03:46:45.340]  made film. Go ahead with your point. Absolutely. He redeemed himself from Transformers and those
[03:46:45.340 --> 03:46:49.740]  Ninja Turtle movies. I'm sorry to offend the people that love that. But anyways, you could,
[03:46:49.740 --> 03:46:54.220]  I could just see my sixth sense was telling me that there's something else going on, you know,
[03:46:54.220 --> 03:46:59.180]  those 17 folders, spoilers, but the other Libyan folders that were supposed to help them,
[03:46:59.180 --> 03:47:03.740]  they were calling the CIA and saying, Hey, tell them to stop shooting at us. But they were shooting
[03:47:03.740 --> 03:47:09.740]  at our American men. I mean, someone else was basically what I'm trying to say is either Hillary
[03:47:09.740 --> 03:47:14.860]  Obama or someone else was watching the whole time. They were feeding the enemy information.
[03:47:14.860 --> 03:47:20.140]  That's just my take on it, man. This is all orchestrated, man. And I'm glad that this movie
[03:47:20.140 --> 03:47:25.660]  came out to wake the people up. And I'm not afraid of death. Obama, he has to be a Muslim
[03:47:25.660 --> 03:47:29.340]  or something. Nothing against Muslims, but I don't know, brother. I just don't know what else
[03:47:29.340 --> 03:47:34.780]  to say before it starts sounding crazy. Thank you so much, Kyle and Arizona. That's a problem I
[03:47:34.780 --> 03:47:39.740]  have quite often. Well, I definitely do appreciate that. Yeah. If you watch the film, they show a
[03:47:39.740 --> 03:47:45.180]  drone flying around the battle zone the whole time. So they definitely were feeding information to
[03:47:45.180 --> 03:47:49.180]  somewhere. And as they referenced in the film, they're asking for any kind of assistance. You
[03:47:49.180 --> 03:47:54.540]  don't even have to come out here and engage the enemy, you know, fly jet, fly a helicopter over
[03:47:54.540 --> 03:47:58.220]  and scare these guys with a back off and give us a little bit more time to regroup.
[03:47:58.220 --> 03:48:02.300]  But of course, as we know, none of that actually happened. Let's go ahead and continue with our
[03:48:02.300 --> 03:48:07.900]  calls here. We have Phil and is that Florida? You also want to talk about the film 13 hours.
[03:48:07.900 --> 03:48:14.860]  Go ahead, Phil. Yes, I do. I saw the movie and I read the book. And in the book, this guy who's
[03:48:14.860 --> 03:48:20.620]  coming out and saying that that isn't exactly how it happened, Bob Bob, the CIA station chief there
[03:48:20.620 --> 03:48:26.940]  at the time, that's how they called him in the book. They called him Bob. And then another thing
[03:48:26.940 --> 03:48:32.460]  in the that I didn't really notice in the movie. And it wasn't really mentioned in the book, but
[03:48:32.460 --> 03:48:39.500]  I have learned it through listening to y'all is those weapons, they were I mean, there's no
[03:48:39.500 --> 03:48:44.540]  discussion about where they were shipping those weapons. And, you know, how they were going
[03:48:44.540 --> 03:48:54.220]  through Turkey. And then also they the I had the next day, the day. So this is a personal thing
[03:48:54.220 --> 03:48:58.460]  that happened to me. It's a little more detailed than what I'm about to tell you. But on my
[03:48:58.460 --> 03:49:04.700]  Facebook page, I posted, I put up a copy of the Benghazi article and I put it up there and I
[03:49:04.700 --> 03:49:11.820]  wrote, can you say blowback and literally three hours within three hours, I was talking to an
[03:49:11.820 --> 03:49:18.780]  FBI agent. But you said you put this on Facebook. I put it on my Facebook on September 12.
[03:49:19.500 --> 03:49:23.740]  The article came out, they said there was, you know, this raid that had like this, this
[03:49:23.740 --> 03:49:29.340]  shootout happened and these people were dead. And I put a copy of the article up on my Facebook.
[03:49:29.340 --> 03:49:33.180]  And I'm telling you within three hours, and it's a little more complicated than this because it
[03:49:33.180 --> 03:49:39.900]  wasn't at my house. It was somewhere else. But there was an FBI, I was talking with an FBI agent.
[03:49:39.900 --> 03:49:43.260]  Was he, well, did he seek you out or how did you come about this agent?
[03:49:44.540 --> 03:49:49.260]  They brought me out, I guess, I don't know. I was so it's a little more complicated. Like I said,
[03:49:49.260 --> 03:49:55.100]  I walked out of the door. So I put that on the Facebook, I put that and then I was looking for
[03:49:55.100 --> 03:50:01.340]  somewhere to go play golf because I was off that day. So I searched on a popular golf
[03:50:01.340 --> 03:50:06.780]  tea time website and I went went to the golf course and this guy joined up with me. And the
[03:50:06.780 --> 03:50:13.100]  next thing you know, he's telling me how he was a retired Washington DC police officer and he's
[03:50:13.100 --> 03:50:17.980]  talking about chemtrails to me. And then the next thing you know, he starts talking about Benghazi
[03:50:17.980 --> 03:50:23.820]  and he wants to know, you know, why I think it's blowback and it was crazy. It was, it was.
[03:50:23.820 --> 03:50:28.860]  Now did he, now did he reference your Facebook post or did you mention Benghazi in your casual
[03:50:28.860 --> 03:50:35.740]  conversation? It came up in the conversation. So I told him what I put on my Facebook though.
[03:50:35.740 --> 03:50:39.980]  I wasn't like I was going to keep it away from him. It took me here nine holes to figure out who
[03:50:39.980 --> 03:50:45.100]  this guy was. All right. Well, thank you so much. That's very interesting indeed. Definitely be
[03:50:45.100 --> 03:50:49.660]  careful what you put on your Facebooks. Stay tuned. We'll be back right after this break with more calls.
[03:50:49.660 --> 03:51:06.140]  My name is Don Wiscan. In 1994, I lost my 62 year old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:06.140 --> 03:51:11.900]  In 1977, my 44 year old brother was found dead in his apartment. He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:11.900 --> 03:51:16.860]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed. 21 days later,
[03:51:16.860 --> 03:51:21.900]  my 53 year old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital. He waited too long.
[03:51:21.900 --> 03:51:27.820]  In June that same year, I almost joined them at 42. What did I do? I took a seven herb formula I
[03:51:27.820 --> 03:51:32.540]  now call Extendivite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgal, biloba, hawthorn, milk,

[03:53:17.020 --> 03:53:21.740]  to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy. Soon after it was also
[03:53:21.740 --> 03:53:26.220]  announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S. passports, hotel room keys, and even transit
[03:53:26.220 --> 03:53:31.580]  passes would all soon incorporate RFID. It was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my inventions
[03:53:31.580 --> 03:53:36.220]  in blocking RFID signals with the world. There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about
[03:53:36.220 --> 03:53:42.060]  RFID. I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected. Please go to idstronghold.com and

[03:54:05.500 --> 03:54:10.300]  And welcome back to the final segment of the Alex Jones show. I'm your host, Dakar Jackson.

[03:54:56.540 --> 03:55:01.660]  in media. You can see all that stuff on the Info War shop. Now we're going to finish up with some
[03:55:01.660 --> 03:55:07.180]  of our collars and let's go to who's been holding the longest. It looks like Chris in Kentucky.
[03:55:07.180 --> 03:55:11.420]  We'll talk about the Rapture. Now, if your question is addressed to Alex, he isn't here,
[03:55:11.420 --> 03:55:17.100]  but you can go ahead and speak about the Rapture. Hey, Jacarie. I appreciate you taking my call.
[03:55:17.740 --> 03:55:22.060]  Yeah, Alex was talking about the Rapture yesterday, and I just had a quick point about
[03:55:22.060 --> 03:55:27.980]  Christians and what it says that they're going to do as far as prophecy speaking in Daniel and
[03:55:27.980 --> 03:55:36.620]  Revelation. Obviously, I think I'm, what the Bible says is that the Rapture is post-trivial
[03:55:36.620 --> 03:55:43.420]  relationship, free rap. Yes. Go ahead. Right. Post-trip, free rap. And in Daniel 1132, it says
[03:55:43.420 --> 03:55:50.700]  that Christians are going to fall by the sword and go into captivity, but it says that Christians
[03:55:50.700 --> 03:55:56.940]  are going to do exploits. And I did a word search on this in the lexicon, and what it says, what
[03:55:56.940 --> 03:56:05.500]  that means in the Hebrew is that they're going to do exploits in war. Okay. So when it says that
[03:56:05.500 --> 03:56:09.740]  they're going to make, that the beast is going to make war against the saints and overcome them,
[03:56:09.740 --> 03:56:13.580]  that's, there's a war there. Okay. It doesn't mean that we're just going to lay down.
[03:56:13.580 --> 03:56:17.580]  It means that we're going to fight back. And I'm not a teacher. I want to get this straight. I'm
[03:56:17.580 --> 03:56:22.780]  not teaching this. I'm not, I'm not a teacher. This is from my interpretation of what the Bible
[03:56:22.780 --> 03:56:28.060]  has said that Christians will go to war against this system. And that's just, that's all I got
[03:56:28.060 --> 03:56:34.140]  to say about that. Love you guys, Jacarie and David. You guys are awesome. And God bless you.
[03:56:34.140 --> 03:56:38.300]  All right. Thank you so much, Chris in Kentucky. I don't know if we still sell the film, but at
[03:56:38.300 --> 03:56:42.860]  one time we had the film after the tribulation, which documents the things that you were talking
[03:56:42.860 --> 03:56:47.260]  about there. So you guys can try to find that on the shop or I'm sure you can find on Amazon or
[03:56:47.260 --> 03:56:53.980]  someplace else. Let's go to Kevin now in Texas. You want to talk about the mark of the beast?
[03:56:53.980 --> 03:57:02.060]  Go ahead. Yes, I can. Great. Thank you. Yes. Discussing about, again, Rapture,
[03:57:02.060 --> 03:57:09.180]  Sunday night, Alex Jones covered it. Imagine if saying 10 million people in America suddenly
[03:57:09.180 --> 03:57:14.700]  caught. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kevin. Your audio isn't the greatest. Maybe try to call back one
[03:57:14.700 --> 03:57:19.820]  day when you have a better audio system. Sorry about that. Let's go ahead and talk to Rose in
[03:57:19.820 --> 03:57:26.620]  Florida. You want to talk about Bernie Sanders? Go ahead. Yes, I wanted to say keep up the fight,
[03:57:26.620 --> 03:57:32.140]  but in reality, every time Bernie Sanders opens his mouth and spits out this nonsense, that's
[03:57:32.140 --> 03:57:37.100]  what's really causing the climate change. I don't think he's the only one, but yeah.
[03:57:38.220 --> 03:57:42.620]  I know there's a few of them. There's a few of them. So I just wanted to point that out there
[03:57:42.620 --> 03:57:47.980]  and, you know, a little sense of humor with all this that's going on and keep up the good fight.
[03:57:48.700 --> 03:57:53.420]  All right. Thank you so much. Yeah. When I hear people endorse Bernie Sanders and like,
[03:57:53.420 --> 03:57:56.620]  let me be clear. When I talk about any of these politicians, there's plenty of other ones that
[03:57:56.620 --> 03:58:00.540]  I don't like. So it's not like I'm against Bernie Sanders. I'm against Trump or I'm against anybody
[03:58:00.540 --> 03:58:06.460]  else. It's just when I see a guy who keeps promising to give you all these free things,
[03:58:06.460 --> 03:58:10.700]  I can get high school kids and college kids who haven't spent that much time in the workforce,
[03:58:10.700 --> 03:58:14.700]  getting behind all this free stuff. But you have to understand just because it's free for you,
[03:58:14.700 --> 03:58:18.940]  somebody else had to pay for it. And when you keep going up that ladder, when you become 30,
[03:58:18.940 --> 03:58:22.140]  40 years old, and you have a bunch of other college kids saying, I want free stuff, you're
[03:58:22.140 --> 03:58:25.180]  like, hold on, I want to keep my money in my paycheck. So I know, no, no, you signed the
[03:58:25.180 --> 03:58:28.860]  father's free stuff. Now you have to give it to somebody else. Stay tuned. In four wars,
[03:58:28.860 --> 03:58:52.940]  nightly news coming up tonight, 7 p.m. Central. David Knight is going to be hosting.
