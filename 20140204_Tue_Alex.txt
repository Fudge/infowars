[00:00.000 --> 00:13.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.440 --> 00:36.920]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.920 --> 00:44.320]  well the Daily Mail is reporting right now that the Seahawks star Richard
[00:44.320 --> 00:49.320]  Sherman says that they broke and cracked Peyton Manning's hand signal code
[00:49.320 --> 00:57.800]  during the Super Bowl so they would be able to predict every play and win and I
[00:57.800 --> 01:03.800]  think that's good the Broncos do not deserve any privacy in fact it's a sign
[01:03.800 --> 01:09.240]  of criminal activity to have any secrets and I think it's good that the
[01:09.240 --> 01:14.560]  Patriots spied on other teams and stole their playbook remember that and I think
[01:14.560 --> 01:22.400]  it's good that the Seahawks basically cheated because no one has any privacy I
[01:22.400 --> 01:26.720]  think everyone should have plastic bags that are see-through plastic clothing so
[01:26.720 --> 01:30.480]  that you're not carrying a weapon you might be a criminal we're guilty until
[01:30.480 --> 01:34.840]  proven slave and I think it's good the NSA preemptively spies on everything
[01:34.840 --> 01:38.880]  illegally because if you don't have anything to hide why would you want to
[01:38.880 --> 01:43.840]  have any privacy you need to let people have all your secret knowledge so they
[01:43.840 --> 01:49.440]  can take advantage of you and of course I'm being sarcastic here I hear this
[01:49.440 --> 01:54.120]  mantra in controlled media and by a minority of people because the vast
[01:54.120 --> 01:58.520]  majority are against illegal NSA spying every poll it's over 80% even with the
[01:58.520 --> 02:04.800]  media trying to sell it some polls are over 90% they say oh well I have nothing
[02:04.800 --> 02:08.720]  to hide I want to know what I'm doing I want to keep me safe what about criminal
[02:08.720 --> 02:12.280]  elements using your data against you what about I'm selling your data what
[02:12.280 --> 02:16.440]  about criminals getting your data what about the 40 million credit card numbers
[02:16.440 --> 02:22.520]  from Target the list goes on and on even if you had a good government that had
[02:22.520 --> 02:26.600]  this omnipresent surveillance you would guarantee bad people would someday get
[02:26.600 --> 02:31.920]  in and use it to unleash hell but there's an example I mean Peyton Manning's
[02:31.920 --> 02:39.880]  for an upstanding family man a Christian no criminal record Mr. America why
[02:39.880 --> 02:46.440]  should you know he'd have a secret hand signs I mean he doesn't need those why
[02:46.440 --> 02:50.720]  do you want to keep something secret Manning oh cuz the other team kept
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.240]  their play secret too because that's basically cheating and you're not a
[02:56.240 --> 03:00.560]  cheater one thing to study what they do but something to get their actual
[03:00.560 --> 03:05.320]  their actual playbook or their actual hand signs that is cheating but but so
[03:05.320 --> 03:09.800]  what so you lost now we learn because they cheated that's what it is it's
[03:09.800 --> 03:15.680]  cheating you can say it's not cheating but 20 years ago it was considered
[03:15.680 --> 03:18.880]  cheating you know now it's not even considered cheating oh they give
[03:18.880 --> 03:22.800]  bounties to try to hurt people to knock them out of the game oh that's just
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.360]  being tough well 20 years ago that was considered cheating it's a total
[03:27.360 --> 03:34.360]  culture of corruption and again if I can hijack a football meme and get people
[03:34.360 --> 03:41.080]  thinking about reality by hijacking this gladiatorial event that certainly does
[03:41.080 --> 03:45.920]  have entertainment value good because this is the same reason people say you
[03:45.920 --> 03:49.240]  should live in a glass house you shouldn't have any privacy because you
[03:49.240 --> 03:53.520]  might do something bad take Tucson, Oklahoma a couple years ago said we
[03:53.520 --> 03:57.640]  want to inspect all the backyard gardens there might be marijuana oh I'm
[03:57.640 --> 04:05.680]  growing tomatoes and squash and Brussels sprouts and corn in my backyard I've
[04:05.680 --> 04:12.080]  grown all that before peppers habanero jalapeno you name it and so I need to
[04:12.080 --> 04:15.560]  have the police come there cuz my neighbor thinks it's kind of suspicious
[04:15.560 --> 04:20.520]  I'm out there growing things and I've covered reports it's on YouTube years
[04:20.520 --> 04:23.480]  ago where they swat team to hold neighborhood because they had blood
[04:23.480 --> 04:27.880]  weeds growing in the drainage ditch behind six or seven houses and the blood
[04:27.880 --> 04:31.520]  weed looks a little bit like a marijuana leaf police didn't just pull up in the
[04:31.520 --> 04:36.240]  public right-of-way gully that was by the road and go and see it was blood weed
[04:36.240 --> 04:40.120]  they knew full well it wasn't blood weed with their photographs that came out in
[04:40.120 --> 04:43.960]  court they just used the fact that it looked a little bit like marijuana this
[04:43.960 --> 04:47.360]  search I think it was seven or eight houses I forget we went to interview I
[04:47.360 --> 04:53.120]  think the headline was police swat raid over weeds over blood weeds Austin
[04:53.120 --> 04:57.360]  Texas I say a few years ago that was like 12 years ago we'll be right back
[04:57.360 --> 05:03.600]  stay with us in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple
[05:03.600 --> 05:09.040]  foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations

[05:13.640 --> 05:18.240]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[05:18.240 --> 05:23.680]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[05:23.680 --> 05:29.400]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ
[05:29.400 --> 05:33.680]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line

[09:30.200 --> 09:36.920]  viewers slash audio for radio listeners okay I've got so much to cover today but
[09:36.920 --> 09:41.000]  in the last segment if you just joined us I began to get into the bombshell
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.600]  news because it ties into the NSA and it ties into the TSA and it ties into our
[09:46.600 --> 09:53.560]  entire culture the internet the the the real revolution against privacy and what
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.320]  that means the Daily Mail is now reporting that star members of the
[09:59.320 --> 10:07.880]  Seattle Seahawks are now openly and publicly admitting they're now
[10:07.880 --> 10:16.160]  publicly and openly admitting that they had broken Peyton Manning's codes and so
[10:16.160 --> 10:21.760]  they knew what he was going to be doing before he did it and that's how they
[10:21.760 --> 10:27.720]  completely dominated now I'm no sports expert but I have followed it my life I
[10:27.720 --> 10:30.960]  did grow up in Dallas Texas and was completely immersed in football till I
[10:30.960 --> 10:36.240]  was about 20 and back in the day cracking someone's hand signs and then
[10:36.240 --> 10:40.520]  winning a game off of that was considered bad sportsman like conduct and
[10:40.520 --> 10:45.440]  basically cheating teams have always tried to figure it out so you try to
[10:45.440 --> 10:49.280]  hide that information and you try to learn what the teams to do by how they
[10:49.280 --> 10:54.520]  line up and how they behave but this shows how they won and and when the
[10:54.520 --> 11:02.040]  Patriots years ago got caught going and spying on practices and spying on the
[11:02.040 --> 11:05.960]  plays and basically getting the playbook they ended up getting censured
[11:05.960 --> 11:08.960]  and getting in a bunch of trouble and were considered to be cheats remember
[11:08.960 --> 11:12.760]  that am I the only one that remembers that a few years ago that's five six
[11:12.760 --> 11:16.960]  seven years ago time flies guys look it up when was the when was the cheating
[11:16.960 --> 11:21.200]  scandal with the Patriots we didn't really need to cheat there was such a
[11:21.200 --> 11:25.920]  great team I don't even follow football and I knew that they would dominate but
[11:25.920 --> 11:33.160]  this is cheating it was 2007 so it was five six years ago 2007 National Football
[11:33.160 --> 11:38.480]  League videotaping controversy which was considered to be cheating now
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.560]  regardless of what you think it should be about the prowess of the teams how
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.760]  hard they play their skill not about knowing what the other guys are doing
[11:46.760 --> 11:52.840]  tapping their phone lines or having moles inside their inside their their field
[11:52.840 --> 11:56.680]  houses but that goes on and and it's dirty people say well you got to do
[11:56.680 --> 11:59.840]  whatever you do to win well how about you just drug the other team with
[11:59.840 --> 12:04.440]  sleeping pills then the point is that and I wasn't rooting for the Seahawks or
[12:04.440 --> 12:11.240]  the Broncos let's get that clear I societally as a phenomenon the police
[12:11.240 --> 12:18.200]  state the snipers the checkpoints the $1700 nosebleed tickets $10,000 you
[12:18.200 --> 12:23.040]  know for good tickets the tax exemption of the NFL the NFL running
[12:23.040 --> 12:26.640]  Scientology ads and I'm not attacking Scientology I stay out of it but the
[12:26.640 --> 12:30.200]  point is they're running Scientology ads but won't let people run a Christian
[12:30.200 --> 12:36.080]  ad or a pro-gun ad that doesn't even show guns about the right of a man to
[12:36.080 --> 12:43.240]  protect his family Daniel defense and they'll kick people off the show off the
[12:43.240 --> 12:48.840]  Monday night football for criticizing Obama on Fox News Hank Williams Jr. and
[12:48.840 --> 12:54.240]  then put Obama in his place on the Monday night football and and it's come
[12:54.240 --> 13:01.320]  out that Obama had given the football players positive tweets about Obamacare
[13:01.320 --> 13:07.360]  to put out before during and after the game I mean this is immersion immersion
[13:07.360 --> 13:17.520]  in total and complete absolute over-the-chart off-the-chart over-the-top
[13:17.520 --> 13:21.960]  propaganda daily caller reports White House wrote pro-Obama tweets for NFL
[13:21.960 --> 13:29.040]  players to pair it I mean this is a rigged system just like a casino is
[13:29.040 --> 13:33.160]  rigged on record you may like going in there and playing a rig game I don't
[13:33.160 --> 13:38.080]  there's a lot of real risk-taking I can take in life for telling the truth and
[13:38.080 --> 13:42.800]  standing up to bullies and taking action and in business that's where I take my
[13:42.800 --> 13:51.960]  risk and I enjoy it not in rigged scams where I'm a chump walking in the door so
[13:51.960 --> 13:57.480]  that's why I'm bringing this up here today is because the fix is in at so many
[13:57.480 --> 14:03.600]  levels and they now admit Seahawk star Richard Sherman says they cracked
[14:03.600 --> 14:07.640]  Peyton Manning's hand signal code during the Super Bowl so they were able to
[14:07.640 --> 14:12.480]  predict every play controversial quarterback Richard Sherman said that
[14:12.480 --> 14:15.080]  he and the other defenders were able to crack the code on Manning's hand
[14:15.080 --> 14:20.280]  signals said they figured out which plays or which with hand motions during
[14:20.280 --> 14:24.880]  the first quarter of the Super Bowl Sherman equated the game to a mental
[14:24.880 --> 14:29.000]  match saying they were playing chestnut checkers on the field on Sunday
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.360]  Seattle 143 to 8 and surprisingly low scoring game for the Broncos and it
[14:34.360 --> 14:43.000]  shows how corrupt our society is that they don't even like to use the code
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.760]  words blue 42 or whatever anymore because they know that stuff gets stolen
[14:47.760 --> 14:51.480]  every time before the game so then they have to meet hours before the game and
[14:51.480 --> 14:55.720]  go over new hand signals so that the other side isn't getting it and I guess
[14:55.720 --> 14:59.800]  it does take to the level of literal war that this type of stuff's going on so
[14:59.800 --> 15:03.480]  here's my point regardless of whether you think the Seahawks cheated and they're
[15:03.480 --> 15:06.840]  hiding it in plain view just admitting they did this that's how arrogant and
[15:06.840 --> 15:10.800]  corrupt things have gotten regardless of what your view is about that that's why
[15:10.800 --> 15:18.640]  we don't live in glass houses that's why we have privacy that's why we have in
[15:18.640 --> 15:23.040]  coding and encryption on our email that's why you pull your blinds down at
[15:23.040 --> 15:28.160]  night especially we live in a high-rise that's why you lock your doors it's
[15:28.160 --> 15:32.400]  because you do certain precautions to up your level of security and safety and
[15:32.400 --> 15:38.000]  privacy and the basic instinct of a bird is to try to roost in a nest behind
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.080]  some leaves or in a hollow of a tree why for security and if you don't have
[15:43.080 --> 15:48.440]  privacy you have no security they've sold this equation of no privacy
[15:48.440 --> 15:54.920]  equals security that's two plus two equals a thousand it's a pure bolt no no
[15:54.920 --> 16:01.080]  security equals tyranny just like Peyton Manning didn't have his hand signs
[16:01.080 --> 16:05.040]  secret to his team so they lost the game and the people got a terrible game
[16:05.040 --> 16:11.720]  that was a shutout basically because of cheating like a Don King fight where the
[16:11.720 --> 16:16.720]  guys walk out one guys been told to fall at the beginning of the third so he
[16:16.720 --> 16:19.360]  lets the other guy kind of beat him up the other guy didn't to me because he
[16:19.360 --> 16:24.520]  knows it's staged they act like it's a boxing match and every one of them is
[16:24.520 --> 16:27.800]  totally rigged on record and so now now people don't watch professional boxing
[16:27.800 --> 16:33.160]  because they know it's rigged and you ruin the sport same deal just like you
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.080]  ruin a free market by having a rigged economy with insiders that are exempt
[16:38.080 --> 16:41.520]  from the regulations and things they foist upon the people so that is the
[16:41.520 --> 16:48.000]  lesson of Super Bowl 48 and how it was stolen not by skill not by prowess not
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.400]  by focus not by who worked out the hardest no it was stolen because they
[16:53.400 --> 16:57.000]  they cracked the hand signs and so the game wasn't about who was the strongest
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.480]  or who could catch the best or who had the best pass routes down who read the
[17:00.480 --> 17:04.760]  best linebackers who are who had the best offensive or defensive linemen or who
[17:04.760 --> 17:09.160]  had the best quarterback it was about who could cheat basically well if
[17:09.160 --> 17:17.520]  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan with their divisions on Wall Street create super
[17:17.520 --> 17:23.520]  fast trading algorithms where they hook computers directly into the stock
[17:23.520 --> 17:27.000]  market at the Dow Jones industrial average and siphon off a couple billion a
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.840]  day rigging the whole thing it starts really discrediting the stock market
[17:30.840 --> 17:36.080]  and then when they take 40 something trillion dollars the last six years seven
[17:36.080 --> 17:42.240]  years since 2008 and pump it directly into the stock market and it goes up to
[17:42.240 --> 17:48.080]  you know 16 17 18,000 I mean of course it's going to do that because you're
[17:48.080 --> 17:54.560]  putting fiat money in to the only bubble that's left you're like well let us live
[17:54.560 --> 17:57.800]  by bubbles and that's all we've got hey I hear you I don't want it to pop the
[17:57.800 --> 18:04.040]  problem is it gives the insiders who are in control of the bubble first dibs on
[18:04.040 --> 18:08.440]  the money insider trading insider knowledge on trillions of dollars a
[18:08.440 --> 18:12.440]  month meanwhile they'll arrest mark the Stuart over stuff that clearly wasn't
[18:12.440 --> 18:17.720]  illegal they'll try to put the owner of the of the Dallas Mavericks in jail
[18:17.720 --> 18:24.280]  because he criticizes Bush Obama is now you know arresting filmmakers that
[18:24.280 --> 18:27.920]  criticizing with the Justice Department that ran fast and furious this is what
[18:27.920 --> 18:36.840]  it's like to live in a mafia system and this is why you do not want to have
[18:36.840 --> 18:42.200]  crony capitalist monopoly insider systems because they wreck competition they
[18:42.200 --> 18:47.040]  wreck markets general electric for six years has gotten hundreds of waivers on
[18:47.040 --> 18:50.840]  their power plants to run dirty while their competition isn't even allowed to
[18:50.840 --> 18:56.000]  run completely clean and the response is a doubling of energy prices the last
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.760]  five and a half six years in the United States on average a doubling in your
[19:00.760 --> 19:04.680]  electricity and for the select groups that get to turn their plants up full
[19:04.680 --> 19:09.320]  blast and and and their competition gets mothballed or fined as Obama said
[19:09.320 --> 19:12.560]  you can build a coal power plant but we will bankrupt you he means he'll
[19:12.560 --> 19:16.720]  bankrupt who wouldn't party his gang general electric that the last four
[19:16.720 --> 19:20.960]  years guess how much general electric paid in the last four years in taxes
[19:20.960 --> 19:28.760]  zero zero zero and hit and the head of general electric ran Obama's economic
[19:28.760 --> 19:33.680]  council and he lobbied to raise your taxes if you made over 125,000 a year a
[19:33.680 --> 19:38.640]  couple quarter mill because he's a bastard he's a piece of trash he wants
[19:38.640 --> 19:42.600]  that money in bank or bailout money the general electric wanted just like just
[19:42.600 --> 19:46.040]  like Warren Buffett you want to know why I dislike Warren Buffett that gangster

[24:47.640 --> 25:00.120]  this works that's how the globalist operate that's what they do and it's so
[25:00.120 --> 25:05.480]  elementary that they have just trained us to put up with anything and everything
[25:05.480 --> 25:11.720]  in this country and now as I told you a decade ago it's mainstream news
[25:11.720 --> 25:17.600]  Google Microsoft Amazon for that matter anybody that has hundreds of millions
[25:17.600 --> 25:22.200]  people visiting them are able to predict the future with almost 100%

[25:27.080 --> 25:31.680]  month shipping packages packaging them preparing them and even shipping them
[25:31.680 --> 25:36.560]  before you order off of how your mouse moves over things off your whole
[25:36.560 --> 25:41.040]  database history they buy these NSA databases that's the big dirty secret is
[25:41.040 --> 25:49.600]  the whole Internet has been built and set up and designed and ready to read
[25:49.600 --> 25:54.120]  your mind and then if they can read your mind and predict what you're gonna do
[25:54.120 --> 25:57.920]  they can then put stimuli in to manipulate what you're going to do and
[25:57.920 --> 26:06.640]  that has a name it's called mind control the end of free will I mean is it fun to
[26:06.640 --> 26:09.960]  be in a world where everything's rigged is it fun to watch a football game
[26:09.960 --> 26:14.360]  that's 40 something to eight because they know what the other teams about to
[26:14.360 --> 26:20.240]  do and and are able to basically cheat I would not want to play a card game if I
[26:20.240 --> 26:23.240]  knew what cards my friends were gonna be getting I like to play cards when I
[26:23.240 --> 26:30.400]  have time poker you name it I'll play uno of my kids go fish you name it war
[26:30.400 --> 26:39.000]  solitaire would you play a game if you knew the outcome would you get married
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.760]  even knew the outcome would you have kids if you knew there was a predisposed
[26:41.760 --> 26:53.160]  predispositions that down the road you might have some type of physical
[26:53.160 --> 26:56.840]  problem or they won't tell you that it's also what's in the environment that
[26:56.840 --> 27:00.360]  triggers that they lied to you and say oh don't have kids now because you've got
[27:00.360 --> 27:04.400]  a 30% chance you're gonna end up having a child that has some kind of genetic
[27:04.400 --> 27:07.640]  disorder and then now you're in the brave new world of picking and choosing the
[27:07.640 --> 27:17.160]  babies but not even for a better race quote unquote no now social engineering
[27:17.160 --> 27:23.880]  piggybacking into all the technology genetic electronic digital the systems
[27:23.880 --> 27:29.080]  of control to entry will so a bunch of globalist technocrats can literally
[27:29.080 --> 27:34.920]  play God and so that's why I saw that article this morning about the Seahawks
[27:34.920 --> 27:39.440]  cracking Peyton Manning's code you notice they said they did it right at the
[27:39.440 --> 27:41.520]  start of the game because it's considered cheating if you break it
[27:41.520 --> 27:49.480]  before so they went oh we broke it right at the beginning yeah sure you did and
[27:49.480 --> 27:52.280]  they're saying that because they know it's gonna come out later so I guarantee
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.280]  of their coaches told them don't be like the Patriots that lied about it get
[27:57.280 --> 28:01.120]  out front of it see I know how these propaganda operations work as I've
[28:01.120 --> 28:05.880]  watched it so many times they just hide it in plain view and they've gotten away
[28:05.880 --> 28:09.520]  with so much in New York State they're saying it's the law to take flu shots
[28:09.520 --> 28:14.040]  now on top of another 15 shots or so they claim her law and mandated to be in
[28:14.040 --> 28:19.680]  school there's no law to take any of those vaccines there's a waiver but the
[28:19.680 --> 28:25.000]  law just says they'd like you to sign a waiver with the health department it's
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.040]  the same in all 50 states that you're not gonna get the vaccine and quote
[28:30.040 --> 28:34.080]  understand the dangers then they use that as a database of people to persecute
[28:34.080 --> 28:38.920]  who are not inoculated but nevertheless Rick Perry said nine years ago it's the
[28:38.920 --> 28:42.800]  law you've got to take Gardasil shots or eight years ago there was no law we
[28:42.800 --> 28:46.680]  pointed that out the hoax imploded Mexico's an authoritarian state they
[28:46.680 --> 28:51.360]  actually passed the law saying all girls have to take it and it'll come out
[28:51.360 --> 28:55.200]  later most of them are sterilized and the average up you'll go there's too many
[28:55.200 --> 29:01.200]  people but your sterilized to dummy it's done covertly and if a government can do
[29:01.200 --> 29:05.240]  that covertly and lie and say it's the law you think there's not other stuff
[29:05.240 --> 29:09.280]  going on they're lying about flu shots they're lying about Gardasil shots for
[29:09.280 --> 29:12.480]  human papillomavirus they're lying oh by the way they didn't tell you if you're
[29:12.480 --> 29:18.240]  infected with one of the known 8,000 strains of human papillomavirus that it
[29:18.240 --> 29:23.320]  actually reduces a whole group of common cancers down to almost nothing that
[29:23.320 --> 29:29.600]  it's a natural inoculation warts in the environment to viral cancer that those
[29:29.600 --> 29:34.760]  studies have been out for 70 years but it's conclusive now that's why people
[29:34.760 --> 29:38.760]  that take the Gardasil shot massive cancer increases their ovaries basically
[29:38.760 --> 29:44.280]  melt as well but hey if you like endometriosis if you like your ovaries
[29:44.280 --> 29:48.840]  shutting down if you like your body eating itself if you like dying take it

[34:34.840 --> 34:38.600]  Supreme Court justices to take our guns and start the Civil War that's their
[34:38.600 --> 34:44.280]  dream now I'm gonna tie this in what I'm about to do into a big stack of key

[35:31.520 --> 35:37.040]  cup right here of southern Mexican high mountain
[35:37.040 --> 35:44.680]  arabica totally organic out of or incredible volcanic soil I first drink
[35:44.680 --> 35:50.320]  coffee organic coffee I was like 15 years ago really from southern Mexico and
[35:50.320 --> 35:53.320]  it was my favorite right away but it was very hard to get it it was very
[35:53.320 --> 35:57.680]  expensive now co-ops have formed the last decade as demand has increased you
[35:57.680 --> 36:00.960]  can even buy similar coffee at Starbucks it's about twice the price of ours this
[36:00.960 --> 36:05.840]  is directly beyond fair trade to the farmers down there to the point of we
[36:05.840 --> 36:11.160]  almost sold out of the bags we bought we bought enough to bag 10,000 that's
[36:11.160 --> 36:15.920]  basically sold out we just got another 6,000 and that may be all we get we may
[36:15.920 --> 36:20.320]  have to go to Guatemalan coffee that's almost as good right over the border but
[36:20.320 --> 36:24.880]  very hard to prove it's totally organic if these 6,000 bags sell out quickly just
[36:24.880 --> 36:28.760]  to give you an idea we're going directly to the farmers and I'm telling you it is
[36:28.760 --> 36:32.880]  amazingly good this blend two different types one of them has this key reishi
[36:32.880 --> 36:37.560]  mushroom in it known to boost immunity and really help prevent cancer we've got
[36:37.560 --> 36:42.640]  two different brands of it two different types of wake-up america brand blend and

[38:35.480 --> 38:39.560]  super nice piece in it guy and he's like a green beret you know I didn't even know
[38:39.560 --> 38:44.320]  that till I heard about it from somebody else the point is it was after they call
[38:44.320 --> 38:48.520]  him green berets we was in the special forces in the 80s in Asia the point is
[38:48.520 --> 38:51.680]  is he's a really neat guy and he developed this original type of nason
[38:51.680 --> 38:55.040]  iodine that nobody else has got and let us be the exclusive folks that put it out
[38:55.040 --> 39:06.200]  infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and when you shop and when you support us just
[39:06.200 --> 39:12.160]  like you support farmers markets or the Amish or local media your local AM and
[39:12.160 --> 39:16.120]  FM stations your local newspaper if it's even somewhat pro-liberty you got to
[39:16.120 --> 39:20.320]  subscribe you got to support the local businesses I will go 10 miles out of my
[39:20.320 --> 39:25.400]  way to buy lumber from a mom-and-pop even if they're jerks even if they have
[39:25.400 --> 39:28.640]  problems I know what they're going through I will go 10 miles out of my
[39:28.640 --> 39:32.640]  way to go to a mom-and-pop restaurant before I go in a chain plus the chain
[39:32.640 --> 39:37.880]  restaurants suck unless it's like a Perry steakhouse or something I mean it's
[39:37.880 --> 39:42.640]  just chains are bad in almost every case you're treated like an animal this is
[39:42.640 --> 39:45.120]  something like Bruce Chris or something you know some of the steak houses get it
[39:45.120 --> 39:49.880]  down perfectly and then you know then you want to go to the national chain but
[39:49.880 --> 39:54.840]  that's only for steak houses folks the point is in my experience or maybe
[39:54.840 --> 39:59.040]  Ralph Lauren clothing I mean I'm not even into designer stuff but that Ralph
[39:59.040 --> 40:02.040]  Lauren for whatever reason fits me better than other stuff I got a weird
[40:02.040 --> 40:05.600]  size body I guess I got the like the upper half of like a six foot five guy
[40:05.600 --> 40:09.560]  and I'm 511 I just got a big upper size and you know small lower size like a
[40:09.560 --> 40:13.680]  bulldog this is what George Norrie calls me that the point here is ladies and
[40:13.680 --> 40:19.320]  gentlemen that you need to shop local the system wants to extinct local barter
[40:19.320 --> 40:25.240]  and local economy they want it shut down they want it shut down the big
[40:25.240 --> 40:28.440]  charities have gotten regulations passed trying to shut down small charities
[40:28.440 --> 40:34.480]  like United Way and the Red Cross demonic anti-gun groups that steal
[40:34.480 --> 40:37.960]  almost all the money on record the only national charity out there and they
[40:37.960 --> 40:42.480]  don't pay me to say this I've done the studies almost 90% it's gotten worse of
[40:42.480 --> 40:47.240]  that it was 96% few decades ago but the cost and everything of bureaucracy now
[40:47.240 --> 40:51.840]  it's like 89% the Salvation Army and I give money the Salvation Army meals on
[40:51.840 --> 40:55.800]  wheels most of it actually goes to the people my point is you got to do research
[40:55.800 --> 41:01.480]  on what you support and local is the answer I cannot stress that enough and
[41:01.480 --> 41:04.800]  now let me prove it to you okay remember the story yesterday in fact people
[41:04.800 --> 41:09.360]  won't believe it it was CNS news was also an AP out of Virginia you guys
[41:09.360 --> 41:13.560]  pulled me that article about banning eight kids in their own quarter acre
[41:13.560 --> 41:20.600]  backyard for a seven-year-old's birthday party I mean I mean I say that and I
[41:20.600 --> 41:24.040]  think I'm lying they're having to pass a law to allow birthday parties in
[41:24.040 --> 41:29.760]  America so the so the militarized zoning police don't show up here it is Fox
[41:29.760 --> 41:34.640]  News you can't celebrate America school says students and parents of the
[41:34.640 --> 41:38.400]  Colorado High School are outraged after administrators turned down the request
[41:38.400 --> 41:44.360]  for a spirit weekday honoring America because it might offend non-American
[41:44.360 --> 41:49.680]  see being American now means you pay all the taxes all the regulations you
[41:49.680 --> 41:55.440]  don't get the welfare you're a jump all over the nation San Antonio last year
[41:55.440 --> 41:59.640]  kids were wearing American flags mainly Hispanic chanting USA when they beat
[41:59.640 --> 42:03.600]  the other mainly Hispanic team from South Texas there was a national story
[42:03.600 --> 42:09.000]  saying it was racist to chant USA maybe a little mindless but that's what
[42:09.000 --> 42:16.040]  people chant when they think you know it's like hooray hooray hip hip hooray it
[42:16.040 --> 42:23.240]  has nothing to do with being against Hispanic people that was in a basketball
[42:23.240 --> 42:29.240]  game in San Antonio last year remember in San Francisco on Cinco de Mayo they
[42:29.240 --> 42:34.760]  the Hispanic kids all over the school if they were wearing jackets with American
[42:34.760 --> 42:38.880]  flags or or old Navy shirts that had American flags it turned out in several
[42:38.880 --> 42:41.920]  cases they weren't even wearing it because it was the week of Cinco de
[42:41.920 --> 42:47.640]  Mayo and they were sent home and it's in federal court last time I checked in
[42:47.640 --> 42:53.720]  fact let's prove it to folks search up search feel about San Antonio San Antonio
[42:53.720 --> 42:59.120]  basketball USA chant racist USA chant racist San Antonio basketball it'll come
[42:59.120 --> 43:02.440]  up here's the article I mentioned CNS news from yesterday in case you're a new
[43:02.440 --> 43:06.600]  listener because I know this sounds crazy property rights bill introduced at
[43:06.600 --> 43:12.200]  Virginia woman threatened with fines for kids birthday party eight children with
[43:12.200 --> 43:17.960]  excuse me 10 year old girls and some were seven there in Bonita's backyard and
[43:17.960 --> 43:22.440]  the neighbors called the police and they came and threatened with $5,000 fines
[43:22.440 --> 43:27.240]  okay that's yesterday now here it is you can't celebrate America school says they
[43:27.240 --> 43:31.680]  said they didn't want to offend anyone from other countries or immigrants a
[43:31.680 --> 43:35.280]  16-year-old member of the student council told me they just really did not
[43:35.280 --> 43:38.280]  want to make anyone feel uncomfortable so see that's like they say don't be a
[43:38.280 --> 43:42.400]  cowboy or a Native American at a Halloween deal what's that to do with
[43:42.400 --> 43:46.360]  putting people down don't be a geisha girl they've said at colleges everywhere
[43:46.360 --> 43:51.240]  you'll be kicked out that insults Japanese don't be a pirate don't don't be
[43:51.240 --> 43:56.400]  a again it's all about we're all off balance we have no free speech we but
[43:56.400 --> 44:01.040]  government can do whatever it wants you can have black folks all over the
[44:01.040 --> 44:04.640]  country because it's seen as trendy now beating up white people on the street I
[44:04.640 --> 44:08.760]  mean you go down to 6th Street folks on a Saturday or Friday night and you walk
[44:08.760 --> 44:13.480]  down by 35 or 6th Street ends and I'm gonna go do stakeouts very soon when I
[44:13.480 --> 44:16.960]  get some time I'm gonna have my folks sitting cars and videotaped us every
[44:16.960 --> 44:20.840]  night people are beaten or stabbed or attacked by groups of racist blacks
[44:20.840 --> 44:25.400]  rolling whites and robbing them because it's acceptable to roll whites because
[44:25.400 --> 44:29.280]  whites are the devil and the whites of course don't fight back because they've
[44:29.280 --> 44:33.320]  been taught if you're lifelong here and are a trendy they know and they they
[44:33.320 --> 44:36.000]  test and talk to them they don't do it to other blacks they don't do it to other
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.880]  redneck whites they don't do it to Mexicans for sure that's a good way to
[44:39.880 --> 44:45.120]  get stabbed every time down there at night no ladies and gentlemen they do
[44:45.120 --> 44:50.040]  it I mean they do it to white trendies who go come on bro I'm down with you
[44:50.040 --> 44:54.480]  you're down with me and they beat them and take their stuff so that's what's
[44:54.480 --> 44:58.960]  going on this is the ultra political correctness that they've trained everyone
[44:58.960 --> 45:04.320]  through guilt I don't have any guilt I've done nothing to anybody I genuinely
[45:04.320 --> 45:08.560]  hate black racism and Hispanic racism against whites and I'm so sick of it
[45:08.560 --> 45:12.480]  just like when I'd be in East Texas doing a job working for a large animal
[45:12.480 --> 45:15.720]  vet and you'd run into racist clan people that say you're not from around
[45:15.720 --> 45:19.040]  here are you Yankee they don't even like the white people in some of those
[45:19.040 --> 45:23.200]  areas where they've taken control I don't like ignorant gangs of morons who
[45:23.200 --> 45:27.720]  don't stand for anything except the fact that they're in a group and it's
[45:27.720 --> 45:34.240]  disgusting but it's kosher to be racist if it's against whites it's acceptable
[45:34.240 --> 45:39.560]  in this country and I'm tired of it and I'm calling it out and the media will
[45:39.560 --> 45:42.960]  not cover other than drudge report has forced it out the last two years blacks
[45:42.960 --> 45:46.280]  attacking people all over the country every day there's an article about it
[45:46.280 --> 45:50.720]  and he saw a university last week that said oh whenever there's an APB out
[45:50.720 --> 45:54.080]  about a black person attacking somebody don't say the race if it's black
[45:54.080 --> 45:57.840]  because we don't like hearing black males seen carjacking black males seen
[45:57.840 --> 46:02.880]  robbing because that's politically you know incorrect to say we're on the look
[46:02.880 --> 46:06.280]  out for a black male driving a red truck now it's a white male driving a red
[46:06.280 --> 46:09.520]  truck or Hispanic male driving a red truck or an Asian male driving a red
[46:09.520 --> 46:17.240]  truck that's okay but do not say a black male and do not do not do not have a
[46:17.240 --> 46:21.600]  celebrate American values week which we need what are American values it
[46:21.600 --> 46:25.880]  didn't bombing round people and have a checkpoints they said they didn't want
[46:25.880 --> 46:29.200]  to offend anyone from other countries the student council at Fort Collins High
[46:29.200 --> 46:33.200]  School has proposed having a day to celebrate the United States during next
[46:33.200 --> 46:36.980]  week's winner spirit week no no no spirit needs to be like celebrating
[46:36.980 --> 46:42.320]  Justin Bieber or something or Obama the young people pitched
[46:42.320 --> 46:48.080]  Marcia Monday and invited their classmates to dress in patriotic colors I
[46:48.080 --> 46:52.520]  know what that means their proposal was promptly shot down by administrators as
[46:52.520 --> 46:58.440]  hurtful they said they do not want to they would did not want to be exclusive
[46:58.440 --> 47:03.680]  to any one country exactly you cannot talk about America in America it's
[47:03.680 --> 47:09.160]  offensive and this is not just some spot-checked point going on here this is
[47:09.160 --> 47:12.520]  happening everywhere it's not just some rare thing look at this article of the
[47:12.520 --> 47:16.440]  Associated Press it's finally this happened two years ago it's happening
[47:16.440 --> 47:20.640]  nationwide finally making it into court students sent home for wearing US flag
[47:20.640 --> 47:26.040]  shirts on Cinco de Mayo get day in appeals court racial tensions and gang
[47:26.040 --> 47:31.760]  problems were plaguing the North care California high school no the the the
[47:31.760 --> 47:35.800]  illegal aliens were attacking people that said they were Americans were three
[47:35.800 --> 47:39.640]  students arrived for class in 2010 wearing American flag t-shirts on
[47:39.640 --> 47:47.960]  Cinco de Mayo unpleasant verbal exchanges that that's how un-American or the
[47:47.960 --> 47:53.960]  word is people always say be tolerant oh well the illegal alien kids guaranteed
[47:53.960 --> 47:58.160]  they're so intolerant of the American flag I mean you have a Cinco de Mayo day
[47:58.160 --> 48:01.920]  or one of these illegal alien marches I've got the video raising the kids up
[48:01.920 --> 48:07.520]  Mexico Mexico we're taking over down with the gringo the plan of San Diego well
[48:07.520 --> 48:11.680]  I know what the plan of San Diego is a plan to kill all white males 16 and up
[48:11.680 --> 48:15.640]  and people are wearing plan of San Diego shirts that's like a clan shirt
[48:15.640 --> 48:20.440]  saying kill all blacks I've gone out and protested the clan probably 15 times but
[48:20.440 --> 48:25.160]  the clan doesn't say kill all the blacks least in public
[48:25.160 --> 48:30.960]  Texas High School apologizes for fans USA chant after basketball game NBC News
[48:30.960 --> 48:36.600]  see I told you there it is we're not making this stuff up it's total tyranny
[48:36.600 --> 48:41.520]  it's beyond political correctness for total control you can't wear American
[48:41.520 --> 48:44.200]  flags what are the illegals do when they were when Bush was trying to get
[48:44.200 --> 48:47.880]  amnesty and they had a PR firm for the Republicans in Dallas it came out with
[48:47.880 --> 48:52.720]  Dallas Morning News fund all the illegals in that big 2007 March that
[48:52.720 --> 48:55.400]  backfired with the Mexican flags they were handing on American flags they
[48:55.400 --> 48:59.920]  threw them down because Mexico is a very old-fashioned country very into their
[48:59.920 --> 49:03.640]  sovereignty can you imagine if 30 million Americans moved to Mexico and

[55:01.000 --> 55:04.640]  rights away in the name of fighting al-qaeda where the TSA sticks their

[55:35.520 --> 55:42.360]  a client state to take us over and it's the same thing with Obamacare yo it's
[55:42.360 --> 55:46.000]  racist to not be for Obamacare it's just because you don't like Obama his

[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:27.280]  news and Whole Food news on that front coming up some of the news that I have
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:36.760]  not covered yet if you've just joined us is that the NRA is calling 2014
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:42.200]  elections do or die vows war with Michael Bloomberg and Obama and they point out
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:46.440]  that if we don't get libertarian pro-gun people elected to replace all these
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.960]  Republican and name only people we're going to lose the Second Amendment in
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.360]  2015 they're going to start manning and registering where they haven't already
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:57.320]  done it everywhere they're in control New York Chicago they take the guns
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.800]  Europe they take the guns Australia they take the guns they will take the guns
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:06.560]  and I agree with the NRA who by the way ten years ago was terrible selling a
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:14.360]  salad part of the establishment it was about ten years ago that God rest his
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:20.120]  soul Chuck Heston started fading away and the NRA started really getting soft
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.240]  and then it was gunners of America that really put them on the hot seat and
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.040]  radicalized them as the media calls it it's not radical and in the face of a
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.320]  radical takeover standing up to it is survival it's not radical but it's like
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.280]  oh it's incredible you want to fly American flags it's hurtful to the
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:41.320]  immigrants give them everything free so the mayor says on and on and on and on
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:45.160]  well if you like globalism you're really gonna enjoy what's happening because
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.960]  this country's collapsing
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:54.280]  continuing here there's a pullout via the hill Bill Clinton is the most
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:04:00.840]  forgivable liar I didn't lie to you I never said that a former president Bill
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.960]  Clinton is a liar the public is the most able to forgive nearly two decades
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.640]  after his affair with then White House intern Monica Lewinsky because they went
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:11.120]  after him on something petty because the Republicans were up to their eyeballs
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:16.560]  in the missiles to China the technology transfers the corruption naff to get
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.440]  that's why they never want to go after him because they're involved in it as
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:27.480]  well I mean look at this new 60 minutes report Congress using slush funds to

[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:29.480]  alex jones as the NFL goes so goes the rest of America we've seen Obama care
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:35.480]  promoted anti-gun messages promoted we've seen incredible corruption we've
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:41.200]  seen back in 2007 the Patriots caught spying on the other teams practices and
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.880]  basically stealing their playbooks that is cheating by the way folks and that's
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:51.360]  why I've been focused in on the NFL a lot the last few weeks is because it just
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:56.240]  shows the bellwether or the canary in the coal mine of how wrecked our society's
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:01.040]  getting decades ago if the other team cracked the hand signals of the
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:06.000]  playbook it would be considered cheating if they won the whole game knowing
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.640]  what the hand signs were or if they'd stolen the playbook now the Seattle
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.920]  Seahawks quarterback comes out it's in the Daily Mail it's up on drudgerport.com
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.920]  on the right hand side red linked Seahawks star Richard Sherman says he
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:22.200]  cracked Peyton Manning's hand signal code that's how he was able to win the
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:27.840]  game well what do you think Google can do being able to predict the future of
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.840]  individuals and mass groups what do you think Amazon can do packaging your
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.840]  package and shipping it to you before you order it days before predicting the
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:44.000]  future they can game the entire reality and in civilization as we know it and
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.880]  our civilization is piloted by anti-human globalist who want all the
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.040]  advanced technology and life extension for themselves so here's my question to
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:57.480]  the establishment do you really think you're going to do this to humanity and
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.840]  not have it come back on you you really think this evil nature that you don't
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.720]  think evil is all but it's survival of the fittest social Darwinism do you
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.040]  really think you're going to get away with this turn back now in power
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.280]  humanity don't cheat don't take the dark side path so you can dominate and be in
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:20.120]  charge in power everyone trust in God do the right thing turn back now and I
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.120]  don't think everybody in the power structure is going to do that but I know
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.800]  a lot of people in the power structure highest level of Hollywood producers
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:35.760]  Hollywood stars major banking major media people royalty Japanese government
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.280]  number three in the Japanese government listen to this show and I'm nobody
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.160]  special I just care about humanity I'm worried about the crisis we're entering
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:49.280]  and other people won't tell it like it is so nature abhors a vacuum so info
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:56.480]  wars.com this radio show is rising we have found the zeitgeist which is human
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:03.440]  empowerment out of love not out of some type of marketing research not out of a
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:09.160]  focus group so by predicting the future off of the mass movements and quantum
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:14.360]  computers Amazon Google Microsoft and others can control the future I don't
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.840]  want to live in Bill Gates's future resist everything they're doing say no
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:25.400]  to them buy local shop local go see your local hockey team it'll be more
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:29.320]  entertaining anyways if you're into sports go be on the local softball team
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.960]  or baseball team get into sports yourself that's all healthy and good
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:38.120]  they've taken something so good like sports and ruined it until the bottom of
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:41.440]  the hour then we'll get into all the other economic news stock market news
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.520]  political news it's all coming up but until the bottom of the hour we're
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:50.160]  joined by the author of the fixes in and he's also got a new book out Brian
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:55.840]  Tui and of course he was a big commentator across the board on TV and and you
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:59.480]  name it until he just began to learn that the fix was in and the FBI admits the
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.960]  fixes in doesn't mean the whole games are rigged but key plays key kickoffs key
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.680]  basketball he was saying is amazingly corrupt I want to get his take on the
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.080]  Super Bowl we just saw and any other big events where the fix has been in
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:17.120]  because the fix is in on the stock market the fix is in on interest rates we
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.640]  told you that over a decade ago now Rolling Stones confirmed it remember
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.560]  that headline the fix is in on everything live or the fix is in on the
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.760]  stock market with the high frequency trading just realize that we don't want
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:35.280]  to chump economy we don't want to be in a rig system we'll be in a system where
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.400]  the individuals and powered not where the whole things gamed that'd be like
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.240]  putting a baby in a box for the first five years and feeding it through a
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.560]  feeding tube and then opening the box up and saying look the babies retarded
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:50.840]  I'm smarter than it and then killing it with a meat cleaver no I'm dominant I
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:56.000]  locked it up and dumbed it down and gamed it I'm the king no what's dominant
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.080]  is empowering everyone having a level playing field being honorable and then
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.560]  dominating in that system or at least doing well in that system by being
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.720]  honorable that's called chivalry ladies and gentlemen every culture at it that
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:13.560]  rose the ancient Romans were full of chivalry more than the English Knights
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.160]  then they've got decadent and had their decline the Greeks were very chivalrous
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.320]  and then became corrupt in their different city-states it's the same
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:25.160]  story folks you go through cycles George Washington was a great knight in
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.400]  shining armor and then things became corrupt we need to rediscover that and
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.200]  I'm telling you the NFL is not the example of wholesomeness look at this
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.840]  not only was the game rigged knowing the hand signs that's why they dominated
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:44.480]  Peyton Manning that's why the game was so terrible so it was rigged on that front
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.640]  now it's come out that Obama the Daily Caller reports and the White House
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.520]  admits it gave the key players who were their buddies information on what to
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:57.840]  tweet out to create that illusion this is the type of stuff we're talking about
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.440]  just be aware that there's stuff being gamed going on Brian thanks for coming
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.080]  on on short notice you've got the floor tell us about what you saw with your
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.960]  expert eye what your inside FBI sources are saying was this game rigged or was
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:16.480]  it so rigged because the Seahawks knew the plays that it was a terrible game
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.600]  it well it's hard to say thanks for having me on by the way Alex but the
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:24.800]  thing with it is people don't believe that this is possible in the United
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.560]  States and I think that's the biggest misconception that I tried to prove I
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.120]  mean I cannot say for certain whether the Super Bowl was rigged and I don't
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.280]  think anybody else out there can really say for certain that it wasn't rigged
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.120]  but the fact the matter is one of the world's biggest sporting events actually
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.200]  the biggest sporting events the World Cup which is coming up in Brazil in 2014
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.800]  we know World Cup soccer matches haven't deep been fixed and we can prove
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:53.120]  that beyond a shadow of a doubt if they can fix the world's biggest sporting
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.960]  event who used to say they couldn't fix the Super Bowl I mean it's it's a
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.920]  football game that's all it really is is it's merely a football game and the fact
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.560]  of the matter is is that gamblers have been able to get the soccer players to
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.560]  get them to fix matches they've been able to get to tennis players got them to
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.280]  fix matches cricket players got them to fix matches they can get to our college
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.360]  athletes and get them to fix matches why do we believe the NFL the NBA the
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.200]  major league baseball all these are immune from such corruption when you
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.360]  look around the United States and you see corruption and everything be business
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.360]  politics or even religion unfortunately and the fact of the matter is with the
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:29.480]  NFL with all these major sporting leagues they are entertainment industry
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:32.760]  they are show business they will argue this they have argued this in front of
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:37.080]  the Supreme Court and because they are show business they can legally manipulate
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:41.440]  their own games and get away for it if the NFL wanted to fix the Super Bowl they
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.960]  could do it legally and no one has any recourse or legal applications to fight
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:51.760]  them on this what do you make of the quarterback saying they knew Manning's
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:56.240]  plays well you know he very well they very well could have figured it out
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.840]  they could be a very legitimate thing or someone could have tipped them off
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.920]  someone could have given the heads up and said hey if he does this if he does
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.280]  this this is what the Broncos offense is gonna do exactly and that's basically
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.600]  illegal so they claim they broke the code instead of having a mole give it to
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.160]  him exactly and I mean this has been going on for sports for decades I mean
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:19.160]  the famous shot heard around the world which is a 1951 between the Giants and
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.640]  Dodgers supposedly they were stealing the pitching signals and knew what pitch
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:25.880]  was coming before it was thrown I mean this is nothing new in sports if this
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.920]  truly is what happened it could have been a tip-off it could have been
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:32.280]  something they figured out and but you know to think that these games are
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:36.080]  always on the level I think is very naive I think is incredibly naive of
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:39.640]  course people can be gotten to I mean that's the bottom line the mafia knows
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.080]  how to get to people the government knows how to get to people and because the
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:48.200]  NFL has become over and above everything I mean in terms of sports has become a
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.880]  national holiday the Super Bowl I mean it's a great and look at how the
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:57.520]  securities paid for by government their tax exempt the NFL's tax exempt they're
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:02.400]  really above the law so the biggest most corrupt thing is the prime suspect
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.000]  you've got a new book out called larceny games I haven't read it yet tell me
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.080]  about that larceny games is based on interviews with the gambling insiders in
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:15.160]  the sports gambling industry as well as former FBI agents but mainly it's based
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:19.520]  on four over 400 FBI files I obtained through the Freedom of Information Act
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.320]  and when the NFL claims we've never had a game fixed ever in our history by the
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:29.040]  mafia or organ or you know professional gamblers these FBI files that I
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.880]  unveiled that which nobody else ever accessed before I mean ESPN didn't get
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:35.800]  it sports illustrated didn't get them I was the one who went out and got these
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:41.240]  these files clearly show that the FBI had numerous information on numerous
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.160]  games numerous hall of fame players and athletes who were involved in not only
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:48.440]  gambling on their sport but potentially fixing games I mean it's stuff that
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:52.480]  should be front-page news in these major sports media outlets but they refuse to
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.320]  cover it I mean they outright refuse to cover this information well sure the FBI
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:01.560]  until the early 50s said organized crime didn't exist because J ever Jagger
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:06.560]  Hoover was getting paid off oh yeah but the fact of the matter is is it's funny
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.320]  when you read some of these files and some of them exist before the passage of
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:14.520]  the sports bribery act which happened in 1964 and it made it illegal as a on a
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:19.760]  federal level for someone to bribe a player an athlete or a coach to fix the
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.440]  game alter the outcome of the game the FBI had great information on players who
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:27.760]  were gambling they had great information on owners who were gambling and they
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.640]  really did nothing about it until 1964 then they started to investigate this
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.520]  stuff and what they found I think was very shocking and I think if fans and
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:39.360]  people read larceny games it will change their understanding of not only
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:43.120]  sports gambling in the United States which is a massive illegal enterprise
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.960]  worth hundreds of billions of dollars but also changed the way they look at the
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.720]  leagues and look at the league security divisions which are supposed to be in
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.760]  investigating the stuff yeah in a lot of cases they're running the whole
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.120]  operation do you ever get told to shut up cuz I know you've been on ESPN hundreds
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.840]  of times before you even wrote this book I knew that used to be a total sports
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:06.520]  junkie I do do you ever get phone calls and said hey shut up no they don't they
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:10.400]  don't touch me because really the information I have I think is untouchable
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.840]  is unquestionable now people may not agree with the conclusions I reach and I
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:17.680]  can understand that but a lot of people you know out there people in the sports
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.800]  media will try to belittle me they will try to you know call me a fool call me an
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:26.320]  idiot for believing such things but they're covering up for themselves I
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:31.160]  mean let's face it ESPN funds the NFL they fund the NBA they are not about to
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:35.520]  do real investigative work on these leagues that they fund that in turn fund
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.200]  them I mean it's an insetuous relationship sure and they're tied into
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.600]  the Justice Department pushing propaganda and brainwashing people as the
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:46.240]  Attorney General has said and they call you a conspiracy theorist I've seen that
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.200]  I mean it's a fact that they're rigging games there's a fact this stuff goes on
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.520]  and so they call you conspiracy theorist like Obama cares a giant screw job they
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:58.560]  call me a conspiracy theorist well no it is a screw job folks we'll be right

[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.520]  roll especially on the road when they're rolling down the road and the
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:42.240]  gremlin they listen to the show a lot of times I want to say out of Dave make a
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:48.800]  death amazing band live ladies and gentlemen he's not faking it you know
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.480]  most rock and roll bands even the new ones play a whole track over it and act
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.120]  like they're playing almost all rock and roll hip-hop it's all fake now but
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:04.160]  bands like mega death it's all real all real that's very rare black Sabbath
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.680]  term totally fake folks just give you a little tip but they don't even have a
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:12.920]  track playing they got real musicians behind the thing playing I'm not gonna
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:17.240]  say anymore just unbelievable country Dave didn't tell me that I was told by
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:20.000]  others and actually was listening to Eddie trunk live on the radio he was
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.800]  admitting it I mean just who wants to go here something that's totally fake I
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.480]  mean they can't get Aussie out of his diapers long enough to literally to be
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.960]  able to roll him out there crapping all over the stage I apologize ladies and
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:35.840]  gentlemen I'm just giving you the reality here let's go back to Brian to a
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:40.720]  Brian other points about the Super Bowl and how political it's become that's
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.320]  why I'm sick of sports is is is the anti-gun messages the Obamacare
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.640]  messages Obama in Monday Night Football intro I mean I'm about to puke here
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:53.320]  what's some other big corruption news you've got going on well you know go
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.600]  actually go back to your point you're just making about like music being fake I
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:00.600]  mean you think about the entertainment industry in general and you think about
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:04.280]  like you say Britney Spears lip-syncing music you think about you know what they
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.480]  could potentially do with the voting in American Idol and you think about these
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:11.520]  reality television shows and how they stage things and re-enact things and
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.800]  have the producers manipulate things to get certain things to happen that's
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:18.960]  exactly what I'm saying sports has become today it's become an entertainment show
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:22.960]  and they're doing the best they can to put on the best show they possibly can
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.080]  to get the highest ratings they can to get the most advertising money they can
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.760]  and they can do all of this legally a lot of fans want to say well this is
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.600]  sports this is pure but the fact the matter is it's entertainment now and
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.280]  what the Super Bowl was was a massive television show that's all it was it was
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:43.080]  a television show and they used it like you show it like you talk about to you
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:47.480]  know push certain political agendas and certain ideas onto a massive people
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:52.000]  100 and what 10 11 million tuned in and they talk to public that none of that
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.040]  exists you tell them most live music is not live if it's a big national act
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.680]  that's just a fact that's well known in the industry they go you're a
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.800]  conspiracy theorist you tell them that a lot of sports are rigged or paid off they
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.640]  tell them your conspiracy theorists you tell them the Federal Reserve is private
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:09.200]  which is a fact that tell your conspiracy theorist the word conspiracy
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:13.040]  theory is like a crutch for dumb people I think well what it was I think it's
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.200]  because skeptics hijacked the word skeptic you know what I mean they turned
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:22.120]  skeptic into towing the party line whereas can I suppose conspiracy
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:25.900]  theorists are really the skeptical ones word ones were questioning the status
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:29.120]  quo we're questioning what we're being presented meanwhile the skeptics are
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:32.280]  just backing that just saying well you know you're crazy because you don't
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:35.560]  think of the way everyone else thinks well that doesn't mean we're wrong I
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:39.840]  mean just because you don't like it you can't just call yourself a skeptic and
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.320]  call me conspiracy theorist and if anything maybe we're both skeptics but
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.560]  by the way I'll throw a little secret about Megadeth because I've got to see
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.520]  it like five times which is really good in the dressing room they play the
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:56.760]  entire hour hour and a half two hours the whole thing before they go out with
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.920]  amplifiers and everything in a room and I can just sit back and you know sip on
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:05.600]  ice tea or whatever and see the whole concert but but the point is to then learn
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:10.360]  that most other bands literally just play a soundtrack now can you believe
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.680]  that I mean and by the way you didn't used to be like that it's getting worse
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.480]  and worse work I guess because the public will accept it why not just have
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.280]  holograms at the concert well I mean you think go back to the Super Bowl and you
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:25.520]  think about how much time and energy effort and practice like to Denver Broncos
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.360]  put in and how great Peyton Manning is he's a five-time MVP and I mean he's
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.040]  a legend he's going to be in the Hall of Fame he's already won a Super Bowl
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:37.560]  ring and then you see what they did on that field on Sunday and you think well
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.800]  where did all that practice go where did all that preparation go how did it just
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.280]  completely fall apart was it really just that Seattle's defense was that good
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:48.080]  was it because they knew his hand signals no Seattle's bragging that they
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:51.760]  had the hand signals yeah but I mean exactly what's something else going on
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:55.360]  that we just weren't alert to that we just didn't know his fans that we were
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:59.320]  being shown one thing and being hidden from something else I mean that's what
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:03.400]  I talk about in sports is I want people to think of sports in a different light I
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.240]  want them to take this sure what do you think happened with the power going off
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:12.480]  last year oh I think there was a complete a fake I really do because they
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:16.200]  make millions of dollars every 30 seconds with the viewers and if you have a
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.320]  power outage for a few minutes that gets everybody to tune back in to pay
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.920]  attention and yeah I agree with you totally staged I think the sign about
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:26.360]  the you know the blackout was look at how much security they put in supposedly
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:29.920]  they had you know millions of dollars they spent they had snipers hidden hold
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.640]  on I want to do five more minutes with you can do it I want to ask about this
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:35.600]  guy that snuck through with the 9-11's an inside job we had him on
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.040]  exclusively yesterday so I want to ask you about that and yeah the whole
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.280]  security theater it's incredible final segment we'll do a few minutes with our

[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:51.760]  911 a 911 was perpetrated by people within our own government and again
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.600]  that was Matthew Mills we played part of it we're gonna play it again for
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:02.520]  everybody here where he went into the most valuable player press conference
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.040]  infiltrated all throughout all the security while the MVP was mumbling
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:12.760]  one of the linemen and pointed out that 911 was an inside job perpetrated by
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.640]  people inside the government and regardless of what you think of that
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:20.800]  statement regardless of what you believe really happened there it shows the
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:24.520]  security is total theater and nothing but a big police state power grab I mean
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:28.240]  they never had this stuff in the past and then meanwhile our own government's
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:33.240]  funding al-qaeda overseas let's let's play the full clip here
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:42.320]  investigate 911 a 911 was perpetrated by people within our own government and
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:46.440]  again that only lasts like 10 seconds but it had such a big effect and we had
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:52.240]  that gentleman on the show yesterday brian tui author of the fixes in the
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:56.600]  showbiz manipulation of professional sports what's your take on that the
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:01.200]  security point you were getting into well isn't that just that one incident
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:04.720]  kind of a microcosm like you say of the American security state that we
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.320]  supposedly have all the security net this guy with a pass to a music festival
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:11.720]  walks right through all the Super Bowl security all the way into the press
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:15.120]  conference and all the way up to the microphone I mean imagine if he didn't
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:18.600]  manage to get a gun in there manage if he was some sort of terrorist or
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:22.840]  something like that I mean that's how ridiculous the security state is but
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:25.920]  going to the Super Bowl going back to the blackout I mean think of all the
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.280]  security they had in place in New York here they had all that same sort of
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:33.440]  security in place in New Orleans but the fact is when the power went out no one
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.560]  panicked and that I think was the biggest tipoff is if you think about what
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:41.200]  just happened at the Super Bowl you know again the biggest TV broadcast in
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:45.100]  America every year and the lights go out and nobody panics owners was this
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:49.000]  the terrorist detected anonymous do this what happened here they all just had
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.520]  turns and all the power went out no big deal I think that's kind of a tipping
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:56.600]  sign a tipping point that shows that you know a lot of this stuff just isn't
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.480]  what you really think it is well I agree with you and then meanwhile every half
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:07.360]  time show I see has weird sex magic rituals for those that don't know weird
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.560]  Illuminati connotations you see the Grammys full of that any idea on why
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:17.760]  they're always putting the occult into these prime time events now it's really
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:20.800]  hard to say I mean that's not something I ever really looked into but if I think
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:24.320]  if you look into the fact of the people who own these NFL teams who own these
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.720]  professional sport franchises I think you'd find that these guys are some
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.960]  serious bigwigs I mean Paul Allen is the owner of you know the Seattle Seahawks
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:36.640]  and I think if you see what the government gives to these professional
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.380]  sports leagues like you mentioned before you know the tax breaks the tax
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:43.320]  exempt statuses they built stadiums and for crying out loud I mean this is the
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:47.600]  modern bread and circuses except now it's you know especially flavored potato
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:51.080]  chips in the NFL but it's the same sort of thing it's still distracting us for
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:55.520]  more important things it's become a soap opera for many people many men and it's
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:59.680]  distracting them from bigger and more important issues in this country well
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:03.320]  that's my issue you've got the male role model pulled down and all the other
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:08.880]  TV images and the culture on purpose so the state can be the father and men and
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:13.400]  women are both the wives of the state now or kind of the the prostitutes of
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:19.200]  the pimp of the slaves of the owner but it's just sick how then they hijacked
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:23.120]  one of the final you know examples of quote manhood and turned it into a
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.440]  government extravaganza what what are you working on now in closing what are
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:32.160]  some other corruption points in sports that you've been covering one of the
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.960]  things I'm working on is that I have an article that should be coming out I
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:38.840]  worked with Lance Williams who co-wrote the book on Barry Bonds and Balco called
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:41.480]  Game of Shadows and we have an article coming out about potentially fixed
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:45.600]  baseball game from 2012 and what Major League Baseball did to cover this whole
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:49.840]  thing up and you know my book Largesty Games based on all these FBI files I
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:54.360]  still get FBI files and FBI information about corruption within these sports and
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:57.520]  I'm gonna keep publishing it as long as people let me I mean I write for sports
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:02.400]  on earth.com which is Vili with USA Today and somehow they let me put some of
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:05.880]  this stuff out there and I think you know if fans look at it and really think
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.360]  about it I think it'll open their eyes to what's really going on in
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:13.680]  professional sports and then what that means for the rest of the world. Now we've
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:16.920]  seen the third world caught over and over again in the World Cup in open
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:20.560]  corruption we know that it's happening everywhere. From your research is it
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:24.240]  getting worse or better? It's getting worse because there's more and more
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.960]  money involved I mean they estimate perhaps as much as one trillion dollars
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:32.320]  is bet illegally on sports around the world every year in the United States in
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:36.360]  might be as much as five hundred billion dollars bet illegally on sports and
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.760]  that's not like a bet between you and me that's a bet between me and my bookie
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:43.360]  that's what's illegal and if there's five hundred billion dollars being wagered
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:47.480]  illegally in the United States nobody can tell me otherwise that that sort of
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:51.680]  money cannot and has not influenced the games we watch it's just naive to think
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:56.960]  so. What is your gut about what happened with Super Bowl 48 because again
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:00.880]  regardless it's a way to wake people up to the corruption I mean all the experts
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:04.000]  almost all of them thought that Peyton Manning and the Broncos would win and
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.920]  then you see that near shutout and then you see them bragging we broke their
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.360]  handsigns openly trying to say it so it doesn't look like fraud but for me that's
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:17.600]  that's basically cheating and so right there it looks like the fix is in. And it
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:20.840]  very well may have been like I said I can't argue for sure that that was
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:25.160]  definitely fixed but I know for a fact the NFL made money on that game Fox made
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.920]  money on the game the Las Vegas sports books month made money on that game the
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.760]  legal bookies made money on that game everyone profited and what do they say
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:37.040]  about conspiracy you know if everyone profits done Derek called a conspiracy
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:42.280]  correct. That's right my friend well I really appreciate you spending time with
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:45.440]  us look forward to talking to you again keep up the good work. Thanks Alex I
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:48.160]  appreciate you having me on today. You've had one conspiracy theorist to
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:52.240]  another of course the conspiracy theorist is one who's informed and does not
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:59.560]  believe known liars it means the opposite of a chump. Now Cass Sunstein has bragged
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.200]  at the White House and before he was at the White House six years ago seven
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:07.720]  years ago in the Harvard Review and others also Chicago Business School he
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:12.960]  writes for both that they would infiltrate alternative media and create
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:18.680]  infighting number one and discredit the entire movements out there putting out
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:26.160]  cockamamie ridiculous news and you see that out there this person's really that
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:31.800]  person you know the center of the earth is hollow and there's an alien base in
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:37.960]  there you know all of this is done basically but then be so far out there
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:42.400]  that they can say I don't think aliens run the planet secretly and the fellow
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:47.760]  reserves private and they equate the two there and look nobody's perfect people
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.800]  that say I get all excited and wacky and stuff and that discredits things but in
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:56.040]  the final equation I'm covering real news I'm real judge a tree by its fruits I
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:00.280]  have woken up pretty scary to say this most of the people that are active out
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.560]  there today will tell you that I woke them up and I'm the most common person
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.440]  you see cited online for getting people to think so judge tree by its fruits
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:11.400]  we're doing really good work by the grace of God and I'm trying to do a better
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:17.640]  job but we also try to act as a platform to have other amazing people on who are
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:21.600]  doing really incredible work and the food girl so we're talking about some
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.920]  really big news the good that the food babe is going to be joining us to talk
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:33.800]  about the whole waterfront here with the good the bad and the ugly of what's
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:38.000]  happening with the movement towards getting true organic labeling and true
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.280]  organic quality versus the attacks by the establishment out there to stop
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:45.920]  labeling and so much more she's going to cover the waterfront with us coming up
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:53.840]  in the next hour I want to hear from you though on children in and in high
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.080]  school and junior high students in Colorado are not allowed to have American
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.040]  flags they're not allowed to talk about America they're not allowed to propose
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:05.120]  America for spirit week to talk about what makes America great bill of rights
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:11.560]  Constitution but you're allowed to learn that the US really belongs to Mexico in
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:16.000]  public school and have Mexican flags everywhere on Cinco de Mayo there's
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:22.040]  more articles out today where they are teaching kids the Koran and the Muslim
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:26.720]  holidays and holy days in public schools nationwide and I'm not attacking
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:31.920]  Muslims here my point is everything's acceptable except American culture
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.560]  because the globalist want to get rid of that because owning guns men being men
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.960]  private property that's a threat to the power structure they want to make every
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:44.880]  other subgroup acceptable except gun ownerships bad white males are bad the
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:49.760]  families bad now there's more articles out today were a White House advisors
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:54.440]  here it is you know are coming out and saying your kids belong to us I mean it
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:59.400]  it's just they're normalizing they're out of control behavior and what do you
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:03.520]  make of I mean is it cheating people say why are you covering sports I'm not
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.160]  covering sports I'm covering fraud when I talk about how most rock bands and
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:13.480]  hip-hop bands have a total tape playing digitally and they sing along with it
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:21.720]  and it's totally fake that's a fact and it's not about music it's about things
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:27.600]  being a fraud it's about getting people to think outside the box and realize
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:31.480]  that we're being manipulated that's the answer to not be chumps I want to hear
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:34.600]  from you on these issues whatever issues you want to cover first-time callers

[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:54.240]  to show you this article while we're talking about it worldwide cancer cases
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:45:01.080]  expected to soar by 70% over the next 20 years new cancer cases expected to
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:09.400]  grow more than 14 million a year in 2012 from 2012 on with the biggest burden in
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:14.200]  low and middle-income countries and it just goes over the incredible toxins of
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:17.520]  industrialization and that's absolutely right and cancer is already more than
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:21.440]  doubled on average since the 50s a lot of it's the Gardasil vaccines and
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:26.480]  before that the SV 40 viruses and the polio vaccines I mean I've had national
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.560]  media say why do you claim there's cancer viruses and vaccines and I just look
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:34.520]  at them and say it's on record I mean it literal ignorance of these people is
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:41.000]  just just absolutely totally mind-blowing so the answer to that is
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.240]  exercise purified water with the propure water filtration systems discounted

[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:38.960]  I will go directly to your phone calls but this week newspaper asked the
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:43.840]  question why is there a war like Forbes asked last year on lemonade stands and
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:48.120]  the answer is they want to extinct barter local sales people voting with their
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:51.320]  dollars the big box stores around the country with the Chinese slave goods
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:55.240]  they don't want you buying local that's why I said with the media or with
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:59.600]  organic foods or with anything you've got to vote with your dollars you've got
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:03.920]  to build an alternative to the system before they've got their casual society
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:08.480]  in place to totally lock everything down that's why the globalist are making
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:14.440]  their move right now on every front to shut down bake sales to shut down little
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:18.520]  kids make it a few cupcakes and sell them to their friends sending a SWAT team
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:22.000]  basically they're doing all this to answer the question of this week why is
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.120]  it happening but the good news is there's gonna be a national movement now to
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:30.840]  have more lemonade stands to counter this this is a revolution of the
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:34.840]  bureaucratic class against us and guys will you relaunch the phone system
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:39.960]  that's a daily reboot that's down thank you very much I appreciate that saw that
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:43.720]  was down at the start of the show need to reboot that keep our eyes on the
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:50.080]  screens in this operation as we basically fly through the media here in the
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:55.520]  info war there they are I got my calls I can take them Justin in Florida you're
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:00.760]  on the air go ahead hey Alex how you doing good thanks for calling go ahead
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:04.960]  first-time caller first-time caller I just wanted to say just quick you're a
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:08.800]  nason iodine I've been working great for me I really love the water bottle and
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:13.300]  the fluoride shield but the point I wanted to make was um do you find it
[01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:18.200]  ironic with the constant conditioning to the people let's say for the gun
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:23.440]  agenda they try to um basically at first they condition us to be kind of numb to
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.280]  war and the death and everything but then at the same time they want to get a
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:30.680]  rise out of us when there's a tragedy doesn't that kind of don't you think
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:36.080]  bite them in the rear end well sure I mean they haven't perfected their social
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:39.680]  conditioning operations because they're humans as well and they want to use our
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:42.680]  human emotions at other times to be able to turn them off when they want they
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:46.480]  want to make us like robots and but being aware of the attempt to make us
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:50.160]  robots and not have individualism is the way to defeat I mean look at all these
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:53.360]  people that with the body modification and the tattoos and some of it looks
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:57.760]  good you know I'm bashing people to do that you know my whole point is is that a
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:01.440]  lot of times I find they're actually more individualistic and care about
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:05.680]  freedom more because they started out trying to be individuals and basically
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.040]  differentiating from the system like you differentiate from your parents when
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:13.640]  you're 13 and you know might do some stupid stuff in that in that process
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:18.360]  but moving towards freedom some of the most sedated people are those that wear
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:21.560]  the business suits and think they're part of the establishment and are going
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:25.080]  along with the whole show but I think the answer is making a break with the
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:31.280]  system I totally agree I also just want to say a big thanks to the Super Bowl
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:34.760]  guy from yesterday we can get more people to get out there and do their own
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:38.760]  thing and I get people to to wake up and really get in the spotlight I think we
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.840]  can really change it I try to preach that you know the only reason they've been
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.560]  able to pull this off is because it's been you know behind closed doors without
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:49.040]  our knowledge if we had consent of this we'd never agree to it so once we get
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:54.320]  everyone aware and everyone on the same page we can change the side I totally
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:58.720]  agree with you God bless you let's jam in lab rat we're all lab rats in the
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:03.120]  scientific dictatorship from Mexico and we'll hold he or she over to the next
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:08.600]  segment lab rat what do you want to talk about yeah Alex it's good to talk to you
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:12.440]  finally first-time caller long-time listener I can't keep too much or they
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:16.880]  will pin me in voice ID to me I want to tell you after 20 minutes 20 years in the
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:21.840]  entertainment industry and moving to New Mexico you can extrapolate what goes
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:27.400]  on out here and I started working in mobile industry I worked with a guy who
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:34.320]  was doing stuff and tell your listeners to Google or sorry search engine
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:39.440]  semantic web and the semantic web technology allows us to find every
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:43.840]  single thing that you've ever said or done things you've posted 10 20 years
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.640]  ago when the web was just nice and although now I want to explain that when
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:51.920]  we come back explain what this web is for those that don't know like the
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:55.840]  technology that's seven years old like Shazam where you can hold your phone up
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:59.360]  and tell them any song is that's used to map everything you've ever done I'll
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:03.400]  squint it we get back silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic and
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.800]  only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:11.560]  solutions silver lungs dot com you'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:15.360]  just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions the silver lungs
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:19.080]  generator allows you to make your own so stop paying for silver solutions the
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:22.400]  unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:26.160]  silver solutions simply cannot reach see the silver lungs generator and lung
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:31.800]  delivery system at silver lungs dot com that's over lungs dot com that's the
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:36.680]  sound of a 44 magnum and trauma max a high-tech hybrid Kevlar bulletproof

[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:55.160]  mobility and it weighs less than five pounds get details at infidel body
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:52:01.880]  armor dot com that's INF IDL body armor dot com the facts are in the studies are
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:06.480]  legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:10.520]  devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people so why
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:15.480]  are the social engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:19.800]  population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:23.680]  have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:27.680]  get it out of our bodies I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive

[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:46.200]  if I am guilty I will pay
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:55:15.200]  the public is not conscious the scientific studies show it they're in a trance state the general public is not even there they're in a trance just wandering around no one hears anything no one's alive unless they want to be when they're watching a TV show television has killed our culture that's why I'm saying search this on air look at this article pull this up I'm trying to make it interactive using the evil medium of visual television to try to wake people up I don't even know if it's effective
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:31.200]  I mean you can't get the average person to even hear what you're saying nowadays and the more you beg somebody to please understand what you're saying the more they won't understand it that's why it's so hard to sell your family on good ideas because they don't want to listen to you and it's very very sad we're talking to
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:51.200]  Labrat in New Mexico and he was talking about voice print analysis grids and my thing is so what if they know who you are of course they can fake people's voices 20 years ago with the voice print systems and now with the computing it's getting faster and faster so go ahead and make your point sir thanks for calling in
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:56:05.200]  sure let me try and put it in a nice media bite for you I think I might have miscommunicated it's not so much about voice analysis it's about being able to take everything that you've ever done and create the predictive analytics that you talk about and everything you just said
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:11.200]  just now is probably the most perfect encapsulation of trying to wake other people up and the problems that are inherent
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:22.200]  I noticed you could manipulate people on the stage using technology for 20 years in the entertainment I'm not going to get into the end topic I got out of it I got into technology I moved here
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:30.200]  you know what's here every secret lab in the planet and everything you can think of everything you ever talk about is all here in plain sight
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:41.200]  they call Santa Fe Langley West the biggest nuclear repository is in Albuquerque not in our missile silos
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:51.200]  anyway I started working with a guy who had created eHarmony and when you start to match things and you can get the computer to create perfect matches
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:57:01.200]  and you have all the data which is really like the new oil it's a byproduct like carbon dioxide of our existence 4 trillion data points are created every day
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:10.200]  new ones and people give out their data like they exhale when you take all that data and you scrape it like oil you mine it you refine it
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:20.200]  and then you use it to fuel the engine of commerce or steer things your way we can predict the movements before they form steer them where we want them
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:28.200]  and get them anywhere they wanted to go I worked with continuity of trading some of what you were talking about earlier while I was back in New York
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:38.200]  guys made $20 billion during 9-11 because they were able to keep continuity and do thousands of trades per second while everybody else was staring at buildings coming down
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:49.200]  they were chopping up to the hand and they were making a fortune I don't know what telling you all this is going to cost me but I'm tired of sitting on it and listening to your show every day
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:58:01.200]  agreeing with what you say and telling you that the supercomputers that are out there now and when my partner would speak at the semantic conferences and conferences just going other places
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:11.200]  everybody out there was military and the semantic web is just a new way of looking at the web if you Google Tim Berners-Lee and get into some of that
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:17.200]  you'll understand the depth of what I'm talking about it's not voice imprint it's using entertainment principles
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:27.200]  no no no I understand I was bringing up voice as one part of how they can track the whole web off just your voice print and then erase everything you've ever said or done
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:38.200]  once they get this grid in place it's just one example of the control we're coming back in 60 seconds I want to come back to you and give you some more time to talk about this because my issue is this destroys free will
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:40.200]  that's what it does
[01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:47.200]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:15.200]  these are items that I did research on that I personally use
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:20.200]  you've got the life straw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:25.200]  the K-Tour hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field

[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:21.200]  and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:38.200]  all right lab rats bottom line
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:43.200]  I mean I remember reading this over a decade ago and now Google admits they can predict the future Amazon you name it
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:49.200]  individually or mass movements that's really Isaac Asimov's foundation series
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:55.200]  where he develops a future predicting system and mass movements with enough data with supercomputers
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:58.200]  but then bad guys use it to control society
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:04.200]  and but then there's also the idiot savant type that's so charming and whatever that can actually over algorithm that
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:08.200]  and then that becomes a whole deal it's a very good series of four books I read it when I was a teenager
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:14.200]  but the issue here is this is what they've now done and for me it's the end of free will
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:19.200]  because as you said they learn even individually what can control you
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:23.200]  and with kids given little kids computers and iPhones and laptops
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:28.200]  they don't have any hope it's the end of free will is it not
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:33.200]  Alex the only way I can say it is free will is so 20 years ago
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:38.200]  and you're correct in reading about the technology is around now
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:43.200]  and it's being announced what they have wouldn't I can't talk about it
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:47.200]  and would no one would believe me not even you would believe me anyway
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:52.200]  I don't know I know it's able to not predict the future it's able to create the future
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:57.200]  that's correct and then some and with holograms and other stuff it gets really
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:03.200]  I understand so what are you talking about carrier waves over the computer that Amazon isn't actually predicting you're going to order
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:07.200]  they're making you order that's also part of it correct yes
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:11.200]  I just want to say that in the early days post 9-11 I tried to take the government head on
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:15.200]  I was in entertainment I was killed because of what I saw
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:21.200]  and I watched two towers come down with my own eyes and I watched the machines slowly grind its rusty gears
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:27.200]  and get worrying again and I watched the playoffs kick in and Cohen telepros start happening
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:33.200]  and I went around the world on tour with a show I can't say the name of the show because it'll ID me there was only one guy
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:38.200]  but I got media attention everywhere and all I can tell you is two different computers
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:44.200]  an Apple 4G and a second generation Apple Q5 or 5G just two separate computers
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:49.200]  two separate addresses turned themselves on for two years our friends used to laugh at us
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:54.200]  our friends used to laugh at us and call us crazy and we'd be over for dinner
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:58.200]  and each of the maps go brown and boot itself up
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:02.200]  and thrown home so I kind of went to ground for a long time
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:10.200]  and I just got to tell you I'm tired of living with everything that you're talking about around me in the open
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:13.200]  I can't tell you what I see and what I know
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:19.200]  no exactly because you're on the inside of this you see the whole fake reality you see humanity losing their free will
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:25.200]  you see us being taken over and you can't get excited about a football game anymore
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:29.200]  and then when you talk to the ignorant public that would laugh at you if you told them this knowledge
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:34.200]  which most of it's open source and available they would laugh at you
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:37.200]  because they're already that enslaved
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:43.200]  that's exactly right and you've got a dig for it but if you dig like you do and you follow the links
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.200]  you go down the rabbit hole and you keep clicking the hyperlink and the hyperlink like you do
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:50.200]  until you get to the source document and you read it
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:54.200]  then you go to your wife and say hey honey or your friends and say oh my gosh guys
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:04:00.200]  and they look at you like you got six heads they totally dismiss you they want to play iPad games
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:05.200]  they want to watch so they're already gone and in parents one parent will tell the other parent
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:09.200]  don't give the kids computers don't give them iPhones they don't care they still do it
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:13.200]  they're all gone you were just losing them all right now and there's nothing we can do
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:19.200]  I use it as a tool but it's still dominating my life and I've just got to get rid of it and it's just so sad
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:23.200]  I just want to tell your listeners and I'm not telling you anything you don't know
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:26.200]  I'm an ardent ardent I suppose there's the wrong word
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:28.200]  Brother there's a lot of stuff I don't know
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:37.200]  I'm a huge supporter and I was a friend of Phil Hoffman's and he and I used to drink together before I got my act together
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:44.200]  and I knew him well and Jim Gandolfini a lot of these guys drank hard, lived hard, partied hard
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:48.200]  and that's the way the culture masters want it
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:51.200]  the most genius people in the world have an imbalance
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:54.200]  genius has to come at the expense of something else
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:58.200]  so our brightest and our best are being burned out and used I just saw your...
[02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:00.200]  Hold on hold on
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:07.200]  In the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:11.200]  a practice now banned in nations around the world
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:13.200]  guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:14.200]  fluoride
[02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:19.200]  Ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:22.200]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:25.200]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:30.200]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ increase
[02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:33.200]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:35.200]  bottom line iodine is important
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:38.200]  unbound clean in a glycerin base
[02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:42.200]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family

[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:13.200]  for more than a decade my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico
[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:17.200]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown arabica beans
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:22.200]  we have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend

[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:38.200]  hands down this is my favorite coffee
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:43.200]  and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers
[02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:47.200]  dropped by the site today order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed

[02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:02.200]  the facts are in the studies are legion
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:06.200]  sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:10.200]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people
[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:14.200]  so why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:19.200]  simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:22.200]  we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:25.200]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies
[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:30.200]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive infowarslife fluoride shield formulation
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:35.200]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world

[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:41.200]  but a whole host of toxic substances
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:46.200]  let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:48.200]  I use fluoride shield every day

[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:05.200]  at infowarslife.com
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:34.200]  Bonnie Hari is our guest for the balance of the hour
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:37.200]  interspersed with some other economic news
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:41.200]  she is a very effective food activist
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:43.200]  she's foodbabe.com
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:47.200]  and she's another great example of people using their talents, their beauty
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:50.200]  their research to go out and reach millions of people every week
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:54.200]  and she's got a bunch of initiatives going out there to target different stores
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:58.200]  different fast food places you name it and get them to go organic
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:00.200]  and to get stores to go organic
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:03.200]  and she's having a huge huge effect
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:08.200]  so it's great to have the foodbabe on with us to talk about some of these initiatives
[02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:10.200]  and some of the big news that's taking place
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:14.200]  Russia is looking right now at completely banning all GMO
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:18.200]  you know where they have pesticides that grow naturally in the crop
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:21.200]  and by naturally I mean they engineer it where it grows in the crop itself
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:24.200]  so bugs can't eat it but then we can supposedly eat it
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:28.200]  big pharma and big agra have obviously been lobbying
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:32.200]  so that we don't have labeling to know stuff like that is going on
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:34.200]  so great to have you with us
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.200]  thank you so much for having me here today Alex
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:38.200]  you bet so where do we start
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:41.200]  I mean tell us about your show, what you're doing and some of the big initiatives
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:45.200]  or let's say you're talking to new people that aren't worried about food
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:48.200]  don't know what's going on most of our audience does
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:52.200]  if you have five minutes to warn somebody about what's going on
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:54.200]  and let them understand what's happening
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:58.200]  well there's been a mass deception of the food industry
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:03.200]  the entire reason the food industry has been able to make millions and millions of millions of dollars
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:07.200]  and make more than was ever thought possible
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:11.200]  is because they are creating food in a laboratory
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:14.200]  that makes us either addicted to it
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:18.200]  makes us reliant upon it
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:22.200]  or is encouraging us through marketing tactics
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:25.200]  to thinking that we need that type of food
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:30.200]  and the only food that we really do need is what comes naturally from the earth
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:32.200]  that's grown by heirloom seeds
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:35.200]  not genetically engineered in a laboratory
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:38.200]  not made in a factory or a plant
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:41.200]  but we need to be eating plants
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:46.200]  and I think the one thing that really upsets me
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:48.200]  and that really energizes a lot of people
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:51.200]  is understanding what's in ingredients
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:53.200]  and when you look at the back of the package
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:55.200]  and if you can't pronounce it
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:57.200]  and if you can't even spell it
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:59.200]  is it something that you really need to be eating
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:02.200]  and when I tell people about, for example, an ingredient
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:04.200]  called azodicarbonamide
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:06.200]  that I just launched a petition today
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:12.200]  on foodbabe.com slash subway where this ingredient is a foamed plastic
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:17.200]  it's used in yoga mat and shoe soles and synthetic leather
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:19.200]  and it is a chemical when you breathe it in
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:22.200]  it causes asthmatic reaction
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:26.200]  and this is a chemical that subway bread is using
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:28.200]  subway sandwiches, all of their rolls
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:31.200]  their deli style rolls, their nine grain wheat bun
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:34.200]  their oats, their honey oat, their battalion
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:36.200]  their Monterey cheddar
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:39.200]  all of those different ones have this chemical in it
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:42.200]  here in the United States
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:44.200]  but not anywhere else across the globe
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:47.200]  not in the UK, not in Europe, not in Australia
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:50.200]  not in Singapore, actually if you get caught
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:53.200]  using this ingredient in Singapore you get put in prison
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:55.200]  you get fined $450,000
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:58.200]  because this chemical is very dangerous to deal with
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:02.200]  but the food manufacturers here in the United States
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:04.200]  are allowed to use this ingredient
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:06.200]  because the FDA is asleep at the wheel
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:08.200]  and the people running our food system
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:11.200]  are not everyday citizens like me and you Alex
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:14.200]  they are people who are out to make money
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:17.200]  and those are the people, the big companies
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:20.200]  the Frito-Lay, the PepsiCo, the Coca-Cola
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:22.200]  the Subways out there
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:25.200]  are what is creating the discourse in this country
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:27.200]  and I can't tell you
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:30.200]  but one really thing that really energized me
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:32.200]  and I apologize for the beep
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:34.200]  that's okay
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:37.200]  Vani Hari, the food babe is our guest here
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:40.200]  and again it's come out that all the big fast food chains
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:42.200]  use the silicone fluffer
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:45.200]  in their chicken McNuggets, you name it
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:47.200]  and this is illegal everywhere
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:49.200]  when China was executing people over melamine
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:51.200]  five years ago
[02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:53.200]  Associated Press ran the headline
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:55.200]  I saw it in the Washington Post
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:58.200]  that FDA says melamine is fine for kids kidneys
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:01.200]  so they execute you in China for it
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:04.200]  here they just wave a magic wand and say it's fine
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:06.200]  because this is being done on purpose
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:09.200]  there's a reason we lead the world in cancer
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:12.200]  but regardless it's there, it's going on
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:15.200]  no one else allows this but us
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:17.200]  that's correct
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:21.200]  and when I talk about who's running the food system in America
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:23.200]  how it's really these corporations
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:26.200]  you can even see the influence they're having
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:29.200]  when you look at just a week ago
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:32.200]  where the first lady of the United States
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:35.200]  has endorsed subway sandwiches
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:37.200]  is safe for kids
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:40.200]  saying it has the highest nutritional standards
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:42.200]  something that's made with bread
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:44.200]  that is completely not even whole
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:46.200]  it's made up of all these different chemicals
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.200]  including that chemical as a dicharbonamide
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:51.200]  which is very dangerous
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:53.200]  and you have to realize that
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:56.200]  these corporations have a strong hold on
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:58.200]  our leaders who are making decisions
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:00.200]  who are preventing GMO labeling
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:03.200]  and preventing the elimination
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:05.200]  of these certain chemicals in our food
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:09.200]  and they're really rising up against us
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:11.200]  in their own best interests
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:13.200]  and against our interests of being healthy
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:15.200]  and safe and clean
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:17.200]  and be able to live a really wonderful life
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:20.200]  and I think that is what people need to realize
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:23.200]  is that in order to eat food
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:25.200]  in this country you really have to take control
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:27.200]  of your food back
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:29.200]  you have to make it at home
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:31.200]  you have to know where it comes from
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:33.200]  you have to understand the ingredients on the label
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:36.200]  you have to make sure it hasn't been sprayed with pesticides
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:38.200]  that it hasn't made in the laboratory
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:41.200]  and that it's something that you can actually trust
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:44.200]  to put in your body that has high nutrition
[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:47.200]  and you hit the key here with your research
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:50.200]  if you go back to the 20s when there wasn't any regulation
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:53.200]  big pharma and of course big oil
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:55.200]  had all these extra derivatives of oil
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:57.200]  distillates as they call them
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:00.200]  that they could turn into highly addictive substances
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:03.200]  most poisons are actually addicting
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:06.200]  in fact one of the most common addictions in England
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:09.200]  if you go back over 100 years ago it was arsenic
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:11.200]  but it's obviously very very toxic
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:13.200]  and actually occurring poison
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:16.200]  but it also has an amphetamine type effect
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:19.200]  and so they learn to make all these
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:21.200]  addictive chemicals
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:23.200]  that would make you hungry right away
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:25.200]  make you also feel bad till you got more
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:27.200]  that's addictive
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:29.200]  and when you look at all the hundreds of ingredients
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:31.200]  I mean I can't find
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:33.200]  children's candy, gum, now it's yogurt
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:36.200]  it's over 10,000 items that doesn't have
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:38.200]  aspartame but since people know what aspartame is
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:40.200]  now they've come out with a bunch of molecules
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:42.200]  that are almost the same but are
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:44.200]  in some cases even worse
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:47.200]  and it's literally in everything
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:49.200]  it's in potato chips now
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:51.200]  it is just invading
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:54.200]  and it's being used for social control
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:56.200]  and then these very same companies
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:58.200]  lobby to make sure that we can't
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:01.200]  even have it labeled that something's GMO
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:04.200]  so this is really a big pharma
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:06.200]  for 90 years has been
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:08.200]  I mean take the Japanese military
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:10.200]  as you know but listeners may not know this
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:12.200]  the Japanese military in World War I
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:14.200]  and the war with the Russians after that
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:16.200]  couldn't get the Japanese who were big foodies
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:18.200]  to eat the canned food
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:20.200]  so they found MSG, a toxic salt
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:22.200]  that would make them eat it and want to eat more
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:24.200]  just like they know that aspartame
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:26.200]  gives you diabetes and makes you fatter
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:28.200]  and makes you want to drink more, that's all admitted now
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:30.200]  Dr. Blalock said it 20 years ago
[02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:32.200]  now it's in the news this year and last year
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:34.200]  so I'm starting to be ranting
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:36.200]  the point is they know what they're doing
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:38.200]  it's not an accident that they're doing this
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:40.200]  go ahead
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:42.200]  it's really not an accident
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:44.200]  and even the dairy industry
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:46.200]  has tried to lobby the FDA
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:48.200]  to allow aspartame
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:50.200]  and hidden artificial sweeteners
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:52.200]  and milk for kids
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:54.200]  to think that they're lobbying them
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:56.200]  for these type of things
[02:16:56.200 --> 02:16:58.200]  if it wasn't for the uproar of the consumers
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:00.200]  people like me and you who talk about these issues
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:02.200]  then they probably could have snuck this in
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:04.200]  so from
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:06.200]  a consumer standpoint
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:08.200]  it's really important for all the listeners to understand
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:10.200]  that you have a choice
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:12.200]  of what you put in your body
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:14.200]  and you eat every single day
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:16.200]  and every single time you decide to put something
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:18.200]  in your mouth, that is a decision
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:20.200]  that is a vote
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:22.200]  that vote is more powerful than I believe
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:24.200]  even the power of the people we elect
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:26.200]  to put in office
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:28.200]  because that money that we spend
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:30.200]  is the money that we are going to give
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:32.200]  to either the good guys or the bad guys
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:34.200]  well I mean I've got
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:36.200]  Cass Sunstein's book over there on the shelf
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:38.200]  and others, let's not exaggerate, more like a hundred
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:40.200]  where they talk about in the last
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:42.200]  30, 40 years
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:44.200]  putting chemicals in food to control us
[02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:46.200]  and so none of this is a secret
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:48.200]  for those of us that are informed, it's just the general public
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:50.200]  has grown up in this
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:52.200]  and hey, your cancer is up multi-thousand percentage points
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:54.200]  it's only increasing folks
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:56.200]  we need to get off the, I mean now that I don't
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:17:58.200]  eat fast food but every five years
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:00.200]  and I made it when I'm on the road and totally desperate
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:02.200]  but I'll go hungry now instead of that
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:04.200]  or go to a gas station and eat salted peanuts
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:06.200]  and literally get ill
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:08.200]  but people that are on it all the time are addicted
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:10.200]  yeah you know
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:12.200]  it's really interesting
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:14.200]  the people
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:16.200]  who think that they've been eating fast food
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:18.200]  and it's not doing anything to their body
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:20.200]  and they don't feel bad or they're like
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:22.200]  I've been eating that for 10 years
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:24.200]  there's nothing wrong with me
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:26.200]  my acupuncturist told me this
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:28.200]  really great analogy, he said
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:30.200]  when you have a pool of really dirty
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:32.200]  water and you put something
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:34.200]  dirty in it, you're not going to be able to
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:36.200]  identify, you're not going to be able to see it
[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:38.200]  you're not going to be able to feel it, you're not going to be able to know it
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:40.200]  but if you take a really clean
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:42.200]  body of water
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:44.200]  and you put something dirty in it, you recognize
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:46.200]  it right away and that's why Alex
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:48.200]  you have those symptoms of feeling really
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:50.200]  bad when you eat that food because
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:52.200]  your body hasn't adapted
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:54.200]  you know the body is so miraculous
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:56.200]  you know it adapts to all these pain receptors
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:58.200]  and everything to help it survive
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:00.200]  and really there's all of these
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:02.200]  I believe zombies out there
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:04.200]  that are just surviving
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:06.200]  on this fast food
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:08.200]  and their body is adapting and eventually
[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:10.200]  what happens is it starts
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:12.200]  to break down and that's when cancer
[02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:14.200]  and diabetes and heart disease
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:16.200]  and all of these different ailments
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:18.200]  autoimmune disorders, Alzheimer's disease
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:20.200]  all of these things start to happen
[02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:22.200]  later on in life but you know
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:24.200]  we have a choice right now
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:26.200]  we have a choice of whether we want to experience
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:28.200]  that or not and if we
[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:30.200]  want to take control of our health
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:32.200]  we can feel amazing, we can
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:34.200]  like climb huge mountains when we're older
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:36.200]  and do the things that we were supposed to do
[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:38.200]  on this earth. Exactly, but they want to make us sick
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:40.200]  and put us on Obamacare in the death panels
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:42.200]  we've got the food babe
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:44.200]  foodbabe.com with us infowars.com
[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:46.200]  is our site with prisonplanet.com
[02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:48.200]  we're going to talk about some of the big
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:50.200]  attacks on our health that are going on right now
[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:52.200]  and then solutions
[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:54.200]  and I've got some stories I want to bring up as well
[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:56.200]  for the food babe, I'm Alex Jones
[02:19:56.200 --> 02:19:58.200]  we'll be right back on the other side of this quick break
[02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:28.200]  or visit priproducts.com

[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:00.200]  The last 50 years
[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:02.200]  iodine has been
[02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:04.200]  phased out of our staple foods
[02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:06.200]  and replaced with the halogen
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:08.200]  bromine a practice
[02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:10.200]  now banned in nations around the world
[02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:12.200]  guess what else is in the halogen family
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:14.200]  fluoride
[02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:16.200]  ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here
[02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:18.200]  in 1924 the federal government
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:20.200]  did the right thing and encouraged
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:22.200]  salt producers to add iodine
[02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:24.200]  it's the good halogen
[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:26.200]  on the periodic table and the results
[02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:28.200]  are on record reports documented
[02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:30.200]  a 15 point IQ increase
[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:32.200]  in areas that had previously
