[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.640]  The left-wing lunatics are trying very hard to bring back COVID lockdowns and mandates
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.160]  with all of their sudden fear-mongering about the new variants that are coming.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.160]  But to every COVID tyrant who wants to take away our freedom, hear these words, we will
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.760]  not comply.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.280]  California and New York, two captured states on each end of the country, have officially
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:38.000]  rolled out new COVID protocols and mandates on their websites and said that indeed they're
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.280]  bringing back the controls.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.400]  But we really caught them with their pants down almost two weeks ago with the whistleblower
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.400]  info.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got a call yesterday, an individual was in town and they are a
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.380]  high-level manager in the TSA.
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.380]  Tuesday we got called in, the managers, and told that by the middle of September you
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.860]  all have to wear a mask again and so will airport employees.
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.820]  Then by the middle of October, they are going to say that everyone flying has to
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.820]  wear a mask.
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.740]  Well, I mean, why is this happening?
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.780]  They said, well, because of the new variant in Canada.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.560]  What?
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.400]  People who have had the vaccine are more susceptible to BA.2.A6.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.520]  What the actual shit?
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.960]  But I was sent by the whistleblower a link to the California website and it says the
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.080]  controls are back and here they are, right there in black and white.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.880]  They're going to roll them out.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.560]  And through the institutions, to the corporations, to the hospitals, to the hotels, through
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.360]  the colleges, to the public schools, all over the country, they are shutting down
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.240]  public schools if there's one COVID case.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.920]  That's creating the lockdown by sending the children back home.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.280]  That's the beginning of it.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.000]  My sources, because I called around and confirmed what the first source said, said
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.160]  middle of September, Biden is set to start the rollout.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160]  Now, five, six days later.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:22.840]  Joe Biden literally saying, y'all need to come.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.240]  They need to come up with a new vaccine and they need to come up with a way that people
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.160]  have to take it no matter what.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.040]  I'm willing to die about my freedom.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.920]  I'm willing to die about my medical independence.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.200]  So all I got to say to you in that video, try this and go around and find out.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.760]  FDA and CDC, they've made an announcement on the new vaccine.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.320]  So currently they said that they will have and there'll be an updated vaccine September,
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.320]  mid-September.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.720]  There never was a COVID pandemic.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.360]  There never was a SARS-CoV-2 novel virus.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.680]  There was never any of those things.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.880]  This was a behavior modification exercise to fulfill the objective of the financial interests
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.140]  that were being served.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.960]  And let's remember that the quote, until a pandemic is at emergency threshold, the public
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.160]  doesn't understand the need for medical countermeasures such as a pan-corona virus
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.320]  or pan-influenced vaccine.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.160]  We need the media to create the hype.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.620]  We need to use that hype to our advantage, to get to the real issues investors will
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.420]  follow if they see profit at the end of the process.
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.840]  That's a quote from Peter Daszak.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.420]  That's a quote that was made at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.680]  in 2015.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.860]  This is the admission of terrorism again.
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.160]  Now what did I say they were told?
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.260]  The beginning of the announcements begins September 15th.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.040]  This was just the warming up and getting ready that just so happened to begin right
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.200]  after I announced it literally six hours later, everywhere.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.700]  They just opened up on the public, every control corporate outlet, and then the institutions
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.060]  to create the fear.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.020]  You can stop all flights.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.140]  You can lock down entire countries.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.500]  You can actually do that.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:19.040]  And this, I would say, may make us more open to radical ideas about how to deal also
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.720]  with climate change.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.460]  This has nothing to do with public health.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.340]  It has nothing to do with breaking any waves.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.020]  It was always about breaking people.
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.280]  There is the path of resistance or there is the path of total enslavement.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.280]  Come on.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.820]  Your ancestors were stronger than this.
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.660]  You're stronger than this.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.780]  You can focus on the New World Order and its activities, and you can ask God to lead,
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:55.060]  guide, and direct you with discernment, and you do that, we're unstoppable together.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.540]  It's just a mask.
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.380]  It's just six feet.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.940]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.360]  It's just non-essential workers.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.900]  It's just until we work it out.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.420]  It's just a bar.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.580]  It's just a restaurant.
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.500]  It's just nursing homes.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.340]  It's just schools.
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.660]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.240]  It's just until the cases go down.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.500]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.300]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.740]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.340]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.820]  It's just churches and mosques.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.520]  It's just singing.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.180]  It's just travel.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.620]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.620]  It's just for the greater good.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.500]  It's just fact-checking, not censorship.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500]  It's just mandatory.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.500]  It isn't just at all.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.500]  Visit defendjones.com to help fight back today.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:08.500]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.500]  against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.500]  Thomas Jefferson, if you are receiving this transmission,
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.500]  you are the resistance.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.500]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.500]  the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.500]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.500]  where they can remote control a 747,
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.500]  and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.500]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now,
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.500]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.500]  Visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:01.500]  It is 1112 Central Standard Time.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.500]  We are coming to you from the Austin, Texas,
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.500]  studios of InfoWars.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.500]  It is Saturday, September 2nd, 2023,
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.500]  and for the next 45 minutes,
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.500]  General Flynn, one of the leading minds
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.500]  in the fight against the globalists,
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.500]  and then Joe Biggs is scheduled, if he can get through, from prison,
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.500]  true political prisoner, to be joining us as well
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.500]  after he was sentenced to 17 years in prison two days ago
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.500]  for committing absolutely no crime.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.500]  And then I will continue on after he leaves,
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.500]  getting into the ADL and the censorship combine
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.500]  and how they play a key role
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.500]  as a multinational intelligence agency against the American people.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.500]  I have a large stack.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.500]  They directly are working for the UN.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.500]  We'll be laying that out.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.500]  General Flynn's a busy guy.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.500]  He's a hard guy to get on, but I begged him a few days ago.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.500]  I said, I really think they're going to pull a false flag of some type.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.500]  I see them pre-programming into the news.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.500]  I really need your expertise
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.500]  as the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.500]  and Trump's chief national security advisor
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.500]  because you really have over-the-horizon understanding,
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.500]  unlike probably anybody else out there that's on our team.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.500]  The enemy knows what's going on because they're planning it.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.500]  Please come on and give us your views on that,
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.500]  on the lay of the land politically.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.500]  There is a big awakening.
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.500]  People are figuring out this is a permanent coup happening.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.500]  Our enemies are in deep trouble at every level.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.500]  The indictments have backfired that they launched against Trump,
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.500]  but I don't think we should be too confident
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.500]  and we should talk about tomorrow's news today
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.500]  so we can get ahead of it.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.500]  And a sterling example of this is 15 days ago,
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.500]  I went on air and told you
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.500]  that I talked to a high-level TSA manager
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.500]  who said they were told on the 15th
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.500]  they would start rolling everything out of September.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.500]  A week later, they began to roll it out
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.500]  just like we basically said.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.500]  Here is the New York Times.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.500]  New Yorkers told to mask up for Labor Day
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.500]  as new COVID variants sparked fears.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.500]  They're going to have drones watching people in New York
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.500]  with the borders wide open.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.500]  All these universities and high schools have been saying
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.500]  you got to have shots to go there
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.500]  or they've been closing for a week.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.500]  They're trying to bring the masking back.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.500]  So we got ahead of that, though,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.500]  so there's massive political opposition
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.500]  by senators and governors and so many people.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.500]  We're not going to just accept their incremental roll-outs.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.500]  So just like we got ahead of that,
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.500]  we need to get ahead and do our best thinking on
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.500]  if you're a globalist, what are you going to do?
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.500]  You got to get in their mind.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.500]  And General Flynn is the expert
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.500]  to be able to give us that information.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.500]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.500]  I'm going to try as much as I can to give him the floor.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.500]  I said, I'm going to get your briefing, sir,
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.500]  what you think of the people.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.500]  He said, well, I'd like to hear yours as well.
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.500]  So after he's done talking for a while,
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.500]  I'll kind of give a brief synopsis
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.500]  of what I think their next moves will probably be.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.500]  Again, we got to see the pre-programming.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.500]  GeneralFlynn.com.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.500]  He has an amazing new book, How to Fight AI.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.500]  Find it all at GeneralFlynn.com.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.500]  He also has shared this on Twitter
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.500]  and a bunch of other publications
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.500]  so everybody else watching, you can force multiply this,
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.500]  show that not just say a half million people
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.500]  are tuned in right now, conservatively.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.500]  And then this will be posted later as an archive
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.500]  to man.video.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.500]  A million or so will watch it.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.500]  I'll air it on the main show next week.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.500]  Three or four million will see it.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.500]  But when listeners get excited,
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.500]  like you did two weeks ago on the TSA lockdown 2.0 story,
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.500]  we take full control of the narrative
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.500]  and the enemy can't have that
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500]  because now they're having to counter us
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.500]  instead of incrementally rolling out
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.500]  their brainwashing and weaponized mind control.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.500]  So General Flynn, thank you for being gracious
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.500]  enough to spend some of your limited time with us.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.500]  See how busy you are and the prolific work you're doing.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.500]  So for myself and my family and the crew
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.500]  and the listeners and viewers, thank you, sir.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.500]  And God bless you for being here.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.500]  Alex, thanks so much for having me.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.500]  And this is a really important day.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.500]  And I love the way that you come on
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.500]  on these weekend shows particularly,
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.500]  and I know you run these during the course of the week,
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.500]  but these weekend shows are really important
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.500]  because it gives people that are working their tails off,
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.500]  that don't have that kind of time
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.500]  to be able to listen to the depth that they should be
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.500]  and ability to be able to hear some things on these shows.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.500]  So this is super important.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.500]  And let me just lay out a few things.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.500]  And number one, I'm gonna just state
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.500]  the obvious enemies that we have.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.500]  And then I'm gonna go into those that are not so obvious,
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.500]  but we've been talking about it.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.500]  I've certainly been talking about it.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.500]  You've been talking about it for, geez, maybe a decade.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.500]  I certainly have been talking about it
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.500]  for the last few years, four or five years.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.500]  But the obvious ones are,
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.500]  and I'll start right off the top with China, right?
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.500]  China.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.500]  China has infiltrated into every single institution
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.500]  in the United States of America,
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.500]  government, US government institutions,
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.500]  our entirety of our education system,
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.500]  especially our graduate and undergraduate programs.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.500]  They've been coming into our colleges and universities
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.500]  for well over 25 years
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.500]  to the tune of minimum of about 100,000 a year,
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.500]  as high as 500,000 students a year.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.500]  And they basically are attending
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.500]  some of the most elite universities
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.500]  that we have in this country.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.500]  They're also in the institution of Hollywood, right?
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.500]  The moviemaking, the culturalization community,
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.500]  I call it, the culturalization community of America.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.500]  So the Chinese have gotten deep, deep into that
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.500]  and they've been in that for a long, long time.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.500]  And then they're also in the institutions
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.500]  of the cartels, right?
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.500]  And I would call them the sort of on the streets
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.500]  teamed together where the Chinese have teamed together
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.500]  with the cartels.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.500]  And we know that that's a fact
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.500]  because we already have over 100,000 killed in action
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.500]  by fentanyl in this country.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.500]  So that's China.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.500]  That's China, all right?
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.500]  And there's some other things
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.500]  and I'll talk to China
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.500]  because I'm gonna jump to cyber in a second
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.500]  because I think cyber is something
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.500]  that everybody needs to understand
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.500]  and they need to know what that means
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.500]  and how we are going to be affected by cyber.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.500]  You know, because the other part about China
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.500]  and I am gonna talk about the health crisis
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.500]  that we already see being forced down our throats again.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.500]  The second one is Russia, right?
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.500]  Russia is aligned with China as a communist ideology.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.500]  The other element here is this BRICS,
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.500]  this BRICS alignment of countries, right?
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.500]  Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.500]  They just finished their annual summit
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.500]  and actually that summit was the first one
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:37.500]  that they held since pre-pandemic, pre-COVID.
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.500]  So it's been a couple of years
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.500]  and we need to pay attention
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.500]  to what's happening after that summit.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.500]  But Russia and China, there you go,
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.500]  Russia and China now have been cutting energy deals,
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.500]  economic deals, military deals for years,
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.500]  for the last, you know, certainly the last 20, 25 years
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.500]  but in the last five to six years,
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.500]  I've seen them increase their portfolio of arrangements,
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.500]  economic to military and other arrangements
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.500]  that are well, well past anything
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.500]  the United States of America has been able to keep up with.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.500]  And these last couple of years,
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.500]  it's really, really catapulted into a new level.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.500]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.500]  And they're purchasing, you know,
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.500]  the sale of oil is now going to be done
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.500]  not in petrodollars, meaning US dollars,
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.500]  it's going to be done in the currency
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.500]  of the countries that are purchasing it.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.500]  The third, so Russia, Russia,
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.500]  and of course we have Russia right now
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.500]  in this war in Eastern Europe,
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.500]  which is a total distraction.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.500]  We are, we the American people are being distracted,
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.500]  we're being ripped off.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.500]  We are being, we're paying out of the,
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.500]  you know, through our teeth
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.500]  over to something that we don't need to be part of
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.500]  and frankly, it's a losing effort, it's a big time loser,
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.500]  yet the administration is going to continue to distract us
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.500]  with this losing war in Eastern Europe.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.500]  So that's China, Russia.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.500]  The third one is Iran and the Iranian people,
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.500]  you know, I know a lot of Iranians
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.500]  and I have a lot of friends,
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.500]  but the Iranian government is still in coordination
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.500]  with the Democrat party, right?
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.500]  I call it the Democrat, the Marxist party of the left.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.500]  So they are still negotiating
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.500]  and they are still going to allow Iran,
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500]  we, we the United States of America,
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.500]  are going to essentially build a nuclear weapon.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.500]  And this is insane
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.500]  because this is still the leading state sponsor
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.500]  of terrorism on the planet.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.500]  Iran is still, you know,
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.500]  shouts from the tops of the buildings,
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.500]  you know, death to America,
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500]  death to the Satanists, death to Israel.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:16:00.500]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.500]  Thought it was next week.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.500]  I come in this morning,
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.500]  it's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.500]  Body's ultimate memory formula.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.500]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.500]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.500]  Look how full this bottle is.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.500]  Right to the top, folks.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:26.500]  Right to the top with these 95% of humanoids.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.500]  Again, most Timuric formulas are 5%,
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.500]  some are maybe 10.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.500]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.500]  This is 95%.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.500]  Super constant.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.500]  So like taking one pill,
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.500]  it's like taking 10 of the average pill.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.500]  It's that powerful.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.500]  Or more.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.500]  So they're available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.500]  Body's ultimate Timuric formula.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.500]  Pulled out for almost eight months back in stock
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.500]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.500]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.500]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.500]  And they can only be obtained through diet.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.500]  They can be found in grass-fed beef,
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.500]  which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.500]  And they can be found in fish,
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.500]  which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.500]  But the problem today is finding fish
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.500]  without a high mercury content.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.500]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil

[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.500]  for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems,
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.500]  our brain and our heart.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.500]  They improve mood, mental clarity,
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.500]  and immune function.
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.500]  Get your essential omega-3 fatty acids
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.500]  from the best sources available.

[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.500]  a massive dose of beef bone,
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.500]  a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric,
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.500]  and then it just gets crazier from there.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.500]  It's about to sell out.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.500]  We haven't had it in stock for years.

[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.500]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.500]  or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.500]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.500]  that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.500]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.500]  The allowable level the government admits
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.500]  that they allow to be in your water supply
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.500]  is enough to sterilize you
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.500]  and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.500]  Look it up.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.500]  Don't let them do this to your family.

[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.500]  and counter the globalist onslaught.

[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.500]  You need this filter.
[00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:11.409]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:11.409 --> 00:20:16.409]  North Korea is clearly aligned with China, there's no doubt about that.
[00:20:16.409 --> 00:20:19.090]  They are a nuclear power.
[00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:25.230]  They will be used, so the North will be used by China to sort of do the big head
[00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.230]  fake.
[00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:32.670]  If we see Kim Jong-un of North Korea start to conduct things, do things over there in
[00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:39.090]  his sphere of the world, what we call the Near East, if he starts to do things over in the
[00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:44.970]  Near East where he starts to fire missiles, test missiles again, maybe test a space launch
[00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:49.550]  which they have done in the past, then we're going to start to see other movements and
[00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:53.149]  we're going to have to be very, we're going to have to, you know, our country should
[00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:58.870]  be able to juggle more balls at the same time, multiple balls at the same time, but under
[00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:03.230]  this administration we are incapable of doing that right now.
[00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:09.750]  So Iran is, North Korea is the fourth country, so China, Russia, Iran, North Korea.
[00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:14.149]  And then you have these other crises, right, the border crisis, the narcotics crisis that
[00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:19.310]  I mentioned about fentanyl, the domestic crime, the rise of domestic crime in this
[00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.310]  country.
[00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:26.550]  I mentioned Venezuela as, you know, in a way because what is happening, as we've seen the
[00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:31.590]  Chinese starting to come across the border and we recently saw Uzbeks, right, a group
[00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:39.389]  of Uzbeks, and Uzbeks are a strong member of ISIS and a strong member of Al Qaeda.
[00:21:39.389 --> 00:21:44.510]  And so we just had a group of Uzbeks cross the border down in the southern border.
[00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.070]  And what's happening with Venezuela is Venezuela is being used as a conduit, being used
[00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:55.430]  as a conduit for some of these other nations around the world that aren't in this hemisphere.
[00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.270]  So you're going to see Chinese, we have seen an awful lot of Chinese to the tune of about
[00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:05.149]  a thousand a day coming up through what's called the Darien Gap down in between Colombia
[00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:09.230]  and Panama and making their way up to the U.S. border.
[00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.270]  And thanks to Michael Young and others, I know you're working closely with, thinking
[00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:16.389]  about going down there, both of us, I mean, he has the footage, they built a giant
[00:22:16.429 --> 00:22:21.389]  U.N. base down there, the Darien Gap, and these are mainly military-aged men, Chinese.
[00:22:21.389 --> 00:22:25.950]  I mean, I could tell by the look of them, they look military to me, most of them.
[00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.990]  These are military-aged men, of course they are.
[00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:33.350]  And China doesn't just, and the good reporting by Michael as an example, when he starts
[00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.429]  to ask questions like, where did they come from?
[00:22:35.429 --> 00:22:37.030]  These guys are coming from China.
[00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:43.870]  The Chinese do not let refugees leave their country except for a specific purpose.
[00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:48.870]  So we also have these other border, along our border, along the U.S. border, these
[00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:57.550]  border posts, these military camps that have been built along our own border.
[00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.110]  I've seen a couple, I've been to one of them.
[00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.110]  I've seen these.
[00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.790]  These are huge, huge camps.
[00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.070]  And these aren't camps for a couple of kids.
[00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.150]  These are camps, these are large, large camps.
[00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:13.070]  And they are housing thousands and thousands, primarily military-aged men.
[00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.270]  And then you have to start to think about where they're going.
[00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.909]  So Venezuela, I mentioned Venezuela because Venezuela has not only given up their prisoners
[00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:26.310]  and their psychopaths, but they're also acting as a conduit to pass through Iranians,
[00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:31.150]  to pass through Uzbeks, to pass through Chinese and get them on up into the Central
[00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:35.030]  American isthmus there and head on up to the United States.
[00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:39.550]  The other two areas that I wrote down here is financial and economic.
[00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:47.230]  And I think that this is where I want to go back up to the 60,000-foot level and really
[00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.590]  clearly identify the enemy.
[00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.389]  And again, I think it repeats pounding this.
[00:23:54.389 --> 00:23:56.510]  We have to pound this into our audience.
[00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:01.490]  We've got to pound it into American psyche because the enemy is real.
[00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.670]  And when we talk about sort of an enemy headquarters, it's Davos, Switzerland, and the name
[00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:12.070]  of the organization is the World Economic Forum and the name of the leader is Klaus Schwab.
[00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.710]  And then they're like he says, he says there's about, you know, there's about 600 of the
[00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:22.389]  smartest people in the world, you know, in his very, very arrogant sort of way.
[00:24:22.389 --> 00:24:25.909]  But they're actually there's a couple of thousand that are part of this organization
[00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:31.190]  and these thousand, a couple of thousand are sprinkled all over the world in various
[00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:32.190]  governments.
[00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.670]  Some of them are running governments.
[00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:38.650]  Trudeau is one up in Canada, members of his cabinet, members of his government.
[00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.330]  Same with France, Macron.
[00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:46.030]  And there are other members of the World Economic Forum that are running not only governments
[00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:51.710]  and are parts of the bureaucracies and systems of many of these governments around
[00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:52.710]  the world.
[00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.590]  Australia is another, the United States is another.
[00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.870]  But there's also corporations.
[00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.110]  There's corporations that are members of the World Economic Forum.
[00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:07.470]  So when we hear about all this corporate wokeness for the, you know, since 1972, essentially,
[00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:13.670]  there has been this organizing of fact to basically culturalize the world, get the
[00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:16.090]  world ready to be globalized.
[00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.889]  And these guys are no longer hiding it.
[00:25:18.889 --> 00:25:22.830]  So now what we're seeing, and this is going to happen financially, it's going to
[00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.850]  happen in the economic system.
[00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:28.830]  And we are going to we are going to see things, you know, great reset, we're going
[00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:34.429]  to see things like another health crisis discussion, even though in this country, you
[00:25:34.429 --> 00:25:37.629]  know, like, you know, we're going to start, you know, we'll start to hear more.
[00:25:37.629 --> 00:25:38.629]  We will not comply.
[00:25:38.629 --> 00:25:39.629]  Right.
[00:25:39.629 --> 00:25:42.990]  Well, I've got all that and we should not comply with any of this nonsense.
[00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:46.510]  But I'm starting to see things like malaria.
[00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.230]  You know, I pay very close attention to these indicators.
[00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.310]  So in the health crisis in this country, which is going to strain the financial and
[00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.030]  economic system, and they're going to take advantage of it.
[00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:01.670]  So this enemy force that I just laid out and they have subordinate organizations underneath
[00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:06.670]  the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World
[00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:11.270]  Trade Organization, the United Nations, which you have always been highlighting and what
[00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.270]  they're up to.
[00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:16.510]  And that's important that we understand where the UN is at on a given day, particularly
[00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:17.950]  in this country.
[00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:23.350]  But we've seen cases, small, small anecdotal numbers right now of malaria in this country.
[00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.870]  We have never seen malaria in the United States of America.
[00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:29.990]  Yet we've got a couple of cases down here in Florida, a couple of cases up in Washington,
[00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.990]  D.C.
[00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.429]  I think that I just read about one out in Texas the other day.
[00:26:33.429 --> 00:26:35.070]  I mean, these are anecdotal.
[00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:39.110]  But when malaria hits and you're not ready for it, it can spread very quickly.
[00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.790]  The other one that is also a mosquito borne type disease.
[00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:46.629]  And and it seems like this is the Bill Gates thing, right?
[00:26:46.629 --> 00:26:53.310]  The Bill Gates incursion of this footage is yesterday confirmed local news.
[00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:57.429]  That is millions of mosquitoes being released by helicopter in Florida.
[00:26:57.429 --> 00:26:58.429]  Yeah.
[00:26:58.429 --> 00:27:02.629]  And so you say, you know, because the other one that's up there that we talk about is
[00:27:02.629 --> 00:27:05.070]  the West Nile virus, the West Nile virus.
[00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.429]  I mean, these are deadly.
[00:27:06.429 --> 00:27:07.550]  These are deadly things.
[00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:11.230]  So when you see that, what you're showing right there, I mean, this is these are not
[00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.470]  conspiracy theories.
[00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:18.150]  This isn't the bullshit that that's a literal black helicopter that Bill Gates funds spraying
[00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.629]  mosquitoes on Floridians.
[00:27:19.629 --> 00:27:20.629]  Yeah.
[00:27:20.629 --> 00:27:22.670]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:27.030]  And, you know, again, I, I do want to part of part of what I do want to talk about in
[00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:31.030]  some of the time that I have is the is the, you know, the Republican Party, where's the
[00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.030]  Republican Party?
[00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.750]  Well, sir, you've got the floor and let me just interject because you're reading
[00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.950]  my mind.
[00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:42.629]  I want to, before you have to go, get into I understand you're defining for Americans
[00:27:42.629 --> 00:27:47.429]  the Chai Comm power group, the Russians, the globalists, incessuously work with both.
[00:27:47.429 --> 00:27:51.230]  But they're undermining America, trying to demoralize us, trying to bankrupt us, destroying
[00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.830]  our cities.
[00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:53.830]  What is there?
[00:27:53.830 --> 00:28:00.270]  I mean, obviously, I believe you would agree the globalist are the most powerful block.
[00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.550]  Here's their ultimate goal.
[00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.550]  Here's their ultimate goal.
[00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:03.550]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:04.550]  Here's their ultimate goal.
[00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:05.550]  That's exactly what I was about to ask.
[00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.550]  What is their goal?
[00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.030]  Yeah, I've said this.
[00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:12.909]  I've said this very publicly that their that their original intent was eight years
[00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:13.909]  of Obama.
[00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:14.909]  Right.
[00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:18.270]  Steal this country, eight years of Obama, and then get Hillary Clinton in charge and
[00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.550]  have eight years of Hillary Clinton.
[00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.550]  And we would be done.
[00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:22.550]  You'd be done.
[00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.550]  I'd be done.
[00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.550]  We wouldn't be having this conversation.
[00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:28.429]  So to your audience and to the American people, that was their plan.
[00:28:28.429 --> 00:28:29.889]  Eight years of Obama.
[00:28:29.889 --> 00:28:33.310]  And if you weren't on the Obama, you know, if you didn't get on board with Obama,
[00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.030]  you didn't get on board with his team, you were out.
[00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.230]  You were out like I was out, you know.
[00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:44.830]  And then the next step, the next stage was a controlled political person in the name
[00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:48.949]  of Hillary Clinton and just keep her in there for another eight years.
[00:28:48.949 --> 00:28:49.949]  And we were blessed.
[00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:56.389]  We were blessed that Trump, this warrior, stood up and using his own resources and putting
[00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:57.389]  his own life on the line.
[00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:58.389]  And you.
[00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:59.389]  And then that helped derail.
[00:28:59.389 --> 00:29:02.389]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:06.790]  really, really, really, really, really good news because it's a great product you love
[00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:07.990]  and people want it.
[00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:13.310]  And it funds our Operation 360 Win Bodies, Ultimate, Turmeric Formula, the strongest
[00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:18.550]  you're going to find anywhere, jam packed, a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys
[00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.870]  inflammation, that empowers your neurological system.
[00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:22.870]  You name it.
[00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.469]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[00:29:24.469 --> 00:29:25.469]  God gave it to us.
[00:29:25.469 --> 00:29:27.870]  And it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:31.429]  Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid.
[00:29:31.429 --> 00:29:33.909]  Most brands are 5% human.
[00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:35.949]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[00:29:35.949 --> 00:29:40.750]  This is the strongest anybody makes 95% for humanoid.
[00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.310]  I am so glad this is back.
[00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.909]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:48.469]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.

[00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:04.270]  Coffee has not been available at infowarsstore.com for two years because the price went up too
[00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.469]  high and the quality was starting to go down.
[00:30:06.469 --> 00:30:10.870]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.909]  But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees,
[00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:18.070]  I was blown away, we finally have three great coffees that are the best they have
[00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:20.530]  to offer available to you right now.
[00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.790]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:26.510]  It smells amazing and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:32.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single-source Colombian coffees are now available at infowarsstore.com
[00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.550]  exclusively.
[00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:39.149]  Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast, tastes great, it's the strong one, really strong.
[00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:41.229]  But these are all close second and thirds.
[00:30:41.229 --> 00:30:45.229]  Medium Roast, Wake of America, woo, that's what my go-to.
[00:30:45.229 --> 00:30:49.550]  Dark Roast, Tip of the Spear, tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very
[00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.030]  strong, gives you that pep.
[00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:55.909]  They're all three available at infowarsstore.com and they fund our operation and each order
[00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:59.149]  gets a pocket Constitution Citizen rule book.

[00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:04.750]  answer.

[00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.429]  system particularly.

[00:32:04.949 --> 00:32:09.129]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems in the economy, we could not

[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.140]  Oh geez, that's great.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:14.140]  Is the lighting here, please, David?
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.140]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.140]  Beautiful, that's beautiful.
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.140]  First order of business was to get rid of you.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.140]  Exactly, and there you go.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.140]  There's the guy right there, Obama.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:30.140]  There's going to be some things coming out on him in the next couple of weeks on Obama
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:35.140]  that his relationships, you know, the type of person that he is.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:40.140]  Well, you said that six months ago and now it has come out, you know, the homosexuality,
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.140]  the fact that he's blackmailed.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:47.140]  You're saying, so you obviously knew, you're saying even more stuff's coming out.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:51.140]  Yeah, more stuff is going to come out and I think that what we're going to find is
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:55.140]  that, you know, we've been lied to, so that's in the past.
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.140]  But we cannot forget that, Alex.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.140]  We cannot forget that we've been lied to, we've been deceived.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:06.140]  This is how they do it and they have this globalist structure above them
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.140]  and so the big issue is why.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:11.140]  Why do they want the United States of America?
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:16.140]  They want the United States of America for one thing and that's resources, right?
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:20.140]  Resources, energy, food and people that we have, the innovation
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:22.140]  and the innovative people that we have.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:27.140]  I mean, if they could, China would turn the United States of America into a slave state.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.140]  The World Economic Forum would turn us into a slave state and we'd be run by…
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:31.140]  I totally agree.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:35.140]  So, General, what is the calculus to put their boot on our neck and cut off our resources,
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.140]  just bankrupt Americans, drive them into submission?
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:44.140]  Yeah, so here's what I think we're going to see and it's already been stated,
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.140]  Shrob has said some of this.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:49.140]  I think we're going to see something in the world of, you know,
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:52.140]  we've just finished with this book, this artificial intelligence book,
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:55.140]  but I actually think that we're going to see a cyber attack
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:35:00.140]  or a cyber disruption that is so vast, that is so vast, Alex,
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:06.140]  that it's going to basically disrupt the entire internet
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.140]  and I mean to the point of where it's going to shut everything down
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:16.140]  and we have become so connected as a society and so if you…
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:20.140]  I mean we were joking in the back, you know, prior about generators
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.140]  and, you know, you have a $100,000 generator
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.140]  but you've got a 50-cent piece that's missing
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.140]  and so the whole thing goes to…
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:32.140]  I mean, we have a government, the United States government
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:37.140]  has great control over the internet, great control over the internet,
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:43.140]  great control and it has great and strong and powerful weapon systems
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.140]  in the world of cyber, cyber weapons, right?
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:49.140]  Lasers, things like that, space-based systems.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:55.140]  So I actually think that we're going to see some type of cyber attack
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:00.140]  that's so vast it's going to potentially disrupt or disconnect the internet.
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.140]  Let's stop and slow down and I want you to start over.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:07.140]  This is so important and explain to me from your expert perspective,
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.140]  why do the globalists telegraph?
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.140]  Like, people ask how I'm able to predict stuff,
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.140]  they telegraph what they're going to pull next.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.140]  A virus is going to hit, it's going to disrupt Trump,
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:20.140]  a virus will defeat Trump, especially what Fauci and Schwab said a year before
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.140]  and then it happens.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.140]  I guess they want to brag to their minions to show off
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.140]  or they're pre-programming their people
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.140]  because if I was going to do something evil like that
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.140]  and of course I wouldn't but hypothetically I wouldn't telegraph it.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:34.140]  They're telegraphing that the cyber is the next big move,
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:39.140]  it'll make COVID look like nothing in Schwab's words.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.140]  So why are they telegraphing and then lay out how serious this is?
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.140]  Okay, so for everybody, right?
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:51.140]  My whole world for three and a half decades in the military
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:57.140]  was to think like our enemy was going to potentially act.
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:02.140]  So I had to think about and then provide scenarios to those
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:06.140]  that I was supporting, the infantrymen or the armor or the aviators
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:11.140]  or the operators who were going to go out and do a mission
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.140]  to put their own lives on the line.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.140]  So for many, many years, three and a half decades of my life,
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.140]  I had to think about what was the enemy going to do.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.140]  So I studied the enemy, I studied him relentlessly.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.140]  And what I learned, one of the big lessons that I learned
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.140]  is what you just said,
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.140]  that the enemy will typically telegraph what it is that they're going to do
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:35.140]  and if you learn enough about your enemy, enough about him
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.140]  and you don't have to know every single deep, dark secret
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.140]  that's in their heart because that's hard to say.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.140]  But if you know that they're evil,
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.140]  then you better understand how evil operates.
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:49.140]  But what they typically do and what they've always done,
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.140]  they've always told us what they were going to do.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.140]  And people used to say to me,
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.140]  Jesus, Flynn, you're a madman.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.140]  There's some of the things you do come up with that you say the enemy.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.140]  For those that don't know, you never toot your own horn.
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.140]  You were the first major general,
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:07.140]  a major person in the staff to say China's going to break and double-cross this.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.140]  I mean you basically laid all this out a decade before it happened.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.140]  So why do bad guys telegraph?
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.140]  Answer that for me and then get into what you think is next.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:20.140]  They telegraph because they don't have all of the resources
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:24.140]  that they need at their beck and call.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:30.140]  They need to rely on other aspects of the geography and the land.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.140]  Just like the average anti-flight isn't getting orders to burn things down.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.140]  They just know go out and burn stuff down.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.140]  Exactly.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.140]  So they're calling on their militia basically.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.140]  Exactly.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.140]  It's like I've got to put that – it's a dog whistle.
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.140]  It's a bit of a dog whistle.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:48.140]  But they need to be able to rally because when they do these –
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.140]  so from an enemy perspective, that's why they do it.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.140]  They let it be known what they're going to do.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.140]  They get the word out.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.140]  And if we're good, right, guys like you, especially guys like you,
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:02.140]  and people like myself and others, if we're good and we're paying attention
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.140]  and we're listening to what they're saying,
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.140]  they're going to tell us exactly what they're going to do.
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:10.140]  And you have to connect a few dots.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.140]  You've got to do some analytics.
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:16.140]  In some cases, you've got to do deep analysis and some link analysis.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.140]  Some of your listeners would definitely know what I'm talking about.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.140]  And you've got to put the picture together.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.140]  It's like I say on the battlefield in warfare.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:29.140]  You're not going to be handed a thousand-piece puzzle with all thousand pieces.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.140]  You're going to be handed a thousand-piece puzzle box maybe
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.140]  or maybe not even the box top.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:38.140]  And you're only going to be handed maybe 750 pieces of the puzzle
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.140]  and you're not going to have the whole picture.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.140]  So what we have to do is we have to put the rest of it together.
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.140]  And to me, there is so much noise.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.140]  They'll have all this noise out there, all this deflection,
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:54.140]  all of this irregularness to their operations,
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.140]  all while they're planning their big ticket thing,
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:01.140]  like even going after Trump, all of these indictments.
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.140]  I was reading a thing this morning.
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:08.140]  I think we're up to like 74, 75 felony indictments for 700 and something years.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.140]  It's insane.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:15.140]  If they had just given Trump like one or two felony counts,
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.140]  I'd be worried.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.140]  I'd be worried about that.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.140]  I ain't worried because they know that they have nothing.
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.140]  Exactly.
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.140]  They went into overkill, which shows they're not confident.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.140]  Right.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.140]  So one of the other aspects of an enemy,
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.140]  and this enemy that we are facing, is arrogance.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:33.140]  Their arrogance because they just are so arrogant.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.140]  And this is how evil operates, right?
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:41.140]  The arrogance of evil is something that is so profound
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.140]  and it is something that we have to pay attention to.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.140]  Well, we know for the Bible, that's the big sin is pride.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.140]  That's the devil's makeup.
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.140]  Right, right, right.
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.140]  So we just can't look at these people and go,
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.140]  they're just a bunch of arrogant bastards.
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:41:00.140]  These people, their arrogance will be one of the main telegraphing features
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:03.140]  of what it is that they are going to do.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:08.140]  So I go back to this potential cyber
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.140]  because cyber is something that few people understand,
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.140]  even fewer know what to do about it.
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:18.140]  If your phone is shut down, if the internet is shut down,
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:22.140]  if you have your own servers, let's say if you're a media company
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.140]  and you have your own servers, you have your own ability to project,
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.140]  you have, I mean, little things.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.140]  So here's a little thing that people aren't paying attention to.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:36.140]  They are going to remove AM radios, AM radios from cars, right?
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.140]  The big car manufacturers who are all woke corporations,
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.140]  they're taking AM radios out.
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.140]  They're going to stop the Federal Communications Commission
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:49.140]  is going to start to minimize or limit the use of AM radio.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:52.140]  AM radio is one of the most powerful communications means
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:55.140]  in the world still other than maybe a ham radio
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:59.140]  and there's fewer and fewer ham radio operators around the world.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:02.140]  So if you don't have your own server, like you may have,
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.140]  or I know some other small media outlets
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.140]  or some of the other bigger ones have their own server farms
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.140]  where they're able to operate, they have their own generators,
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.140]  but then generators need to run off electricity
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.140]  or fuel and then you run out of fuel.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.140]  If you don't have those things, then the U.S. government
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:22.140]  is going to go to what they'll tell us is emergency broadcast system.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.140]  And by the way, they're doing a huge test.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.140]  I know where you're going with this exactly.
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:29.140]  Think about just 20 years ago, AM, FM, UHF, VHF,
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.140]  media didn't watch you.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:34.140]  Now, by phasing out all the old broadcast systems,
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.140]  starting with AM and shortwave,
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.140]  and our military is moving even away from it,
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:41.140]  everything now is on the web, which makes it all targetable.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.140]  I'm not a military mastermind like you,
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:46.140]  but common sense means our military should be always,
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.140]  100 years from now, still back up shortwave,
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.140]  still back up AM, still back up, you know,
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.140]  all those other secret systems that transmit to the earth.
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.140]  But instead, they're moving away,
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.140]  making us vulnerable to what you're saying,
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.140]  putting us on one step.
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.140]  Bodies is back.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.140]  The ultimate tumeric product on the market
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.140]  has returned to m4store.com
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.140]  and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.140]  Utilized for thousands of years,
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:13.140]  tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:15.140]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.140]  are published every year on the chemistry
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.140]  and therapeutic potential of tumeric
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.140]  and its active components.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.140]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body,
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.140]  help boost and support flexibility,
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.140]  increase mobility, assist in joint function,
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.140]  bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.140]  Regular tumeric from the store contains
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.140]  about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:40.140]  but our super powerful extract used in bodies
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:44.140]  contains over 95% of the active ingredients in tumeric.
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.140]  No other product can compare
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.140]  with this curcuminoid delivery system,
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.140]  so if you want to put the true power
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.140]  of tumeric to the test, then look no further.

[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.140]  and said we're not doing business
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.140]  with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.

[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.140]  and they can only be obtained through diet.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.140]  They can be found in grass fed beef
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.140]  which is why the ruling class
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.140]  is trying to ban it.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.140]  And they can be found in fish
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:17.140]  which are arguably the best source
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.140]  of omega-3s.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.140]  But the problem today is finding fish

[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.140]  our brain and our heart.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:43.140]  They improve mood, mental clarity

[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:15.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:20.940]  Entirety of our country is being put in such a vulnerable spot right now, and this is going
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:26.400]  to continue to, from their perspective, is going to continue to make progress to get
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.940]  to a place where we cannot control anything.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:35.640]  We will not be able to control our phones, we will not be able to control the light switches
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.600]  in our home.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.400]  I want people to realize, they're going to call me nuts about this stuff, but I want
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:47.800]  people to realize that this sobering reality is that evil exists.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.160]  And these people, when Klaus Schwab says and writes about that you're going to own
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.840]  nothing and be happy, he's not joking.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:55.840]  This is not a joke.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.000]  This is a man that doesn't joke.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:05.040]  This is a man who has his hands on every single major nation state on this planet, to include
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.600]  the United States of America.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.560]  His circle of leaders, you know, and these are not . . .
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:15.860]  I remember General Petraeus 12 years ago said, soon your dishwasher will be watching
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.240]  you and listening to you.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.360]  Well now, that's been here a while.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.360]  Right.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.720]  You know, we have something called the Internet of Things, right?
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.880]  People understand the Internet of Things for those that know what I'm talking about.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:33.640]  So I go back to, you know, what are the potential things that could happen, right?
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:38.600]  And one of the ways, you know, in warfare, you know, Sun Tzu used to say that, in fact,
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:46.400]  he wrote about it and I've studied it for ad nauseam, but everything in war is deception.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.140]  I want people to understand what I just said.
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.960]  Everything in war is deception.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.880]  We are in a war right now.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:59.060]  There are some physical components out there, clearly physical components over in Europe.
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:03.120]  There's clearly physical components still in Afghanistan, Iraq, you know, around the
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.120]  world.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.040]  There's physical components in every single major city in this country.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.760]  And it's called, you know, things like defund the police.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:15.440]  The defund the police phrase, that goes back to the Bolshevik revolution under the
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.880]  era of Stalin.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.120]  So you know, the Democrats are . . .
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:25.680]  Oh, that's the State Department memorandum 7277 from 1962 to disarm the police and then
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.120]  our military and only have a U.N. force.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.800]  That's the official policy.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.800]  Exactly.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:38.760]  So I want people to understand that the rise and fall of nation states is very real.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:39.760]  It's a fact of life.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.000]  I joked the other day with some friends that I was with.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.480]  I said, when was the last time you met anybody from Byzantine, from the Byzantine Empire?
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.720]  And they looked at me like I was cross-eyed.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.440]  And I said, because they don't exist anymore.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:55.400]  So the American empire, you know, it's just we're at, let's say, 250 years.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:03.720]  So where are we in that sort of rise and decline of this nation, this beautiful experiment
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.000]  in democracy called the Constitutional Republic?
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.200]  Where are we?
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.920]  And I will tell you, these people are going to work overtime.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:14.480]  And those are the ones that I just laid out to include those in our own government.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.000]  I mean, you know, there's no way in the world that Joe Biden is in charge of anything.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.160]  He could barely go to the bathroom.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:24.940]  I mean, Jesus, this guy, this guy can't walk up two stairs, I mean, without help.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:26.880]  So how do we how do we get here?
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.320]  We got here because because we we have we've been complacent, we've been lazy, we've
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.280]  been apathetic about our political system.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:42.640]  We've allowed a culture of corruption to just be I mean, just bleed into every single
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.520]  aspect of our of our country.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.840]  And this is where I want to jump a little bit and talk about the Republican conservative
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.840]  part.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.160]  That's exactly where I want to go, because we have the incestuous globalists double
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.680]  dealing with the other power blocs.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.200]  But then they're trying to degrade and demoralize the United States.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.680]  I see a great awakening.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:07.320]  How would you describe just in your details in general, the battle space where we're at
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.320]  right now?
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.400]  And then obvious questions listeners want like I can look at the graph, I can look at
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.600]  the trajectory.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.600]  Tucker Carlson's right.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.120]  I mean, I think that they will try to kill Trump.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.720]  I think that's a very reasonable statement.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.280]  I think that they're trying to outlaw their political opposition.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:26.080]  They're trying to create a one party state that even Senator Josh Hawley gets that.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:29.820]  So I see it positive that people realize how much trouble we're in.
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:34.480]  But is it a dollar short and a day late or what can we do?
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:40.120]  Yeah, I what you just said at the very last point, I hope that that's not a dollar
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.120]  short and a day late.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.280]  I hope, you know, I pray that we're not there.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.840]  I think right now they're trying to kill Trump by narrative.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.840]  Right.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.700]  I mean, the narrative is just constant, constant narrative that's been going on for years.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:57.400]  And you know, these latest indictments are just part of the narrative assassination.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:03.760]  I would say because of who he is and what he represents, which is a major, major component
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.680]  of the opposition to what it is that we are facing and this takeover, this continued
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:12.480]  takeover, you know, as Lee Smith, Lee Smith, the great author, wrote about the permanent
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.480]  coup.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.480]  Right.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.880]  We're in we're in the midst of this permanent coup.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:18.720]  So I think that Donald Trump needs to be very careful.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.000]  And I think those that are around him need to be very careful.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.600]  I think the Secret Service that protects his life need to ramp it up.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.360]  And they ought to actually be asking for more help.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:35.080]  They should be asking for more help as those of us that work that run in those same circles.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.680]  We we need to be doing the same thing.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:43.380]  Because these people are they are not without they're not without, you know, that type of
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:48.440]  level of of of action, of activity.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:54.000]  If they feel they are they feel so threatened that what you're doing is going to stop their
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.080]  ability to be able to continue to take this country over, because the rest of the world
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:03.300]  right now is waiting, waiting on America and Americans to stand up and and step up.
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:07.260]  And they really, you know, we just fought tooth and nail to get to get leadership back
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:10.040]  in the least the House of Representatives.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:16.500]  And all I see out of them is more is more and more, excuse me, I mean, more more talk.
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.660]  They're still on vacation.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:19.660]  Come off vacation.
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:20.660]  Quit talking about impeachment.
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:21.660]  That's right.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:25.940]  And I want the audience to get a sense of urgency because, you know, I'm not a military
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:28.060]  trained tactician like you or a combat veteran.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.660]  I'm just a veteran of twenty nine years fighting these people.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:36.540]  And I see a mixture of arrogance, but that's hiding their desperation.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.860]  And the fact that they're all in.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.500]  And I don't think people realize I can feel it.
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.500]  I can see it.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:42.860]  Just what you just said, General.
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:45.300]  I have never had such a sense of urgency.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.580]  That's why I have you here.
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:47.580]  What can we do?
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.580]  Yeah.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:53.820]  So and again, I appreciate everything you've done for years.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:54.820]  Yeah.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:56.700]  There's a sense of urgency that we all need.
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:01.420]  And like I say, a weakness of mine is anxiety.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:02.420]  I get anxious sometimes.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:06.340]  I wake up like I woke up this morning at about three o'clock in the morning and I started
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:11.980]  reading and I woke up at three fifteen and was just I don't have the anxiety during
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:12.980]  the day.
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:17.100]  I wake up because my brain's working while I'm asleep and I woke up at three and I was
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.480]  like, I've got to do something exactly.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:25.300]  And so so to me, I want people to you know, I have a platform.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.300]  You have a platform.
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.340]  I have a national platform and an international platform.
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.740]  And I'm going to continue to use it.
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.300]  I'm going to speak out.
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.180]  I'm going to I'm going to move around this country.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:37.260]  I'm going to get in the faces of these people.
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:39.380]  I'm going to let them know that we got your number.
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:43.540]  I'm going to let Americans know that that we're with you and you've got to be with
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:44.540]  us.
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:48.640]  You've got to stand behind us, that we there will be those of us that will be that
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.280]  pointy end of the spear.
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.700]  But I need every American now.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:56.540]  I need every single person to to get into their communities and to get into the faces
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:58.260]  of their local politicians.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:03.900]  I mean, that's why we've seen particularly women, Alex, getting in the faces of these
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.660]  school boards around the country.
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:09.940]  You know, we haven't really talked about the the educational immersion that they're
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.380]  taking our children through.
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.180]  And this is actually part of the Chinese plan, too.
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:19.540]  So, you know, people don't know that in nineteen forty nine when Mao came to power,
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:21.900]  he created a hundred year plan.
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:25.580]  And by by twenty forty nine, China would be the dominant world power.
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:31.060]  Well, when Xi came on board, which Xi's only like the like the fifth or sixth leader
[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:36.140]  since Mao, I think the fifth leader since Mao, Xi came on board, declared himself president
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:40.740]  for life, and he is going to move at a at a pace that's much faster because he knows
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:43.020]  he's not going to be around in twenty forty nine.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.020]  So he's going to get it.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.980]  He's going to make it happen by twenty twenty nine.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.260]  And I think you hit the key here, though.
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:50.420]  People have to know the enemies are.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:51.420]  And it does.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:56.820]  I am seeing a real acceleration in the learning curve.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.260]  I mean, if I tried to list all the people now that sound, quote, radical like you and
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:01.260]  I, but we're not radical.
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:02.260]  We just are aware.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.700]  No, that's got a really scary.
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:07.860]  I mean, even James Wood sounds like General Flynn now, Russell Brand, Tucker Carlson.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:10.100]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.100]  R.F.K.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.100]  Junior.
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.100]  I mean, right.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.100]  R.F.K.
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.100]  So R.F.K.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.100]  Junior.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.660]  So and the other thing is, don't listen to Alex Jones.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:19.220]  Don't listen to Mike Flynn.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.100]  Go and do your own damn critical research.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:25.260]  And you're going to find that we're not we're only scratching the surface.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:26.260]  Exactly.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.040]  Nothing that we've said is stuff that we're making up.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.500]  This is stuff that we're just scratching the surface of what these people are capable
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.500]  of doing.
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.480]  So where's the Republican Party?
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.480]  Where's the leadership?
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.480]  It's non-existent.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.480]  Non-existent.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.620]  I mean, where's the impeachment of Biden?
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:40.620]  Where is it?
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.620]  Right.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:48.000]  Well, I know that one one congressman has has put in impeachment proceedings to initiate
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000]  them.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000]  But he did that like almost a month ago.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.840]  And yet McCarthy is still on vacation, still got the entire house on vacation.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:01.080]  So MTG, MTG, I should have announced that is in the studio tomorrow night.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:04.320]  And she says that it's going to be introduced the next two weeks.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:10.200]  She says she's got his I'm kind of breaking news here, but let's hope that's the case.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.200]  Yeah.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:16.400]  Well, so a guy by the name of Greg Stube, Congressman Stube from Florida, he did introduce
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:21.040]  impeachment proceedings already and he did it about four weeks ago.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:25.640]  So now it's like I was like jumping through my skin when I heard that four weeks ago.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:30.080]  And I was like, great, let's get all these guys back, guys and gals back to work and
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.080]  let's start the impeachment proceedings now.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.480]  You know, you take a week, take a week's break, take a take a four days.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:39.480]  Yeah, we got to go on offense and instead it's not work.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.480]  We've got to go.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.480]  Yeah.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.480]  We've got to go on offense.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.480]  We can.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.480]  We have got to get off of our heels.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.480]  We have got to start.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:49.200]  You know, the only way we're going to score, the only way we're going to win is by being
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.200]  separately.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.200]  We got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.200]  really, really, really good news.

[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:57.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:16.040]  The globalist's worst nightmare and the Patriots' best friend, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.860]  I mean, look at what, you know, we know what Nancy Pelosi was able to do in really
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.120]  the first 30 days of her previous time as speaker.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.640]  She had 500 indictments out, 500.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:31.860]  I mean, it was 500 subpoenas, I'm sorry, 500 subpoenas out to people for her fake January
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:32.860]  6th hearings.
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:35.280]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.660]  Where are we?
[01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:43.520]  This speaker, McCarthy, as far as I'm concerned, is a RINO establishment figurehead.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.920]  And he doesn't deserve to be called speaker.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920]  No, I totally agree.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.920]  And we should expand on that.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.040]  Obviously, they're scared of the Justice Department.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.040]  They're intimidated.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040]  He should be removed.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.240]  He doesn't take action.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.620]  But that's another great example.
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:58.320]  We need to see the impeachment of Merrick Garland.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.720]  They've caught him meeting secretly with Jack Smith, meeting at the White House with
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.720]  Jack Smith.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.160]  They've they've caught him covering up the Hunter Biden stuff.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.520]  We have all the whistleblowers impeach the son of a bitch.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.520]  Yeah.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.400]  So I just want to I want to take a minute to talk about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:20.220]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., number one, they won't provide him secret service, which tells
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:23.940]  you everything that they plan on potentially doing to that that guy.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:27.880]  Number one, I or number two, the the Kennedy.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.380]  Every time I hear him, I'm like, Jesus, Kennedy, you're you sound like you're an
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.620]  America first guy.
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:39.300]  You sound like a damn an American who you sound like either your old school Democrat
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.460]  and you're right there in the center of the country or you're you're you're on the
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.060]  conservative side because of because of the way you're speaking.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.800]  And I would say that even some of the things that he's written about.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.880]  So I you know, I like him and I know him.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:59.600]  And when I when I see guys like him, I mean, he gives me hope because the Democrats, the
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.440]  Democrats now are are the Marxist Party.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.440]  Right.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.920]  So the Democrats are not going to do a debate with with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.920]  Why?
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:14.040]  Because he represents something that they fear, which is honesty and the truth.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.400]  Why don't they want to have why don't why are they going after Donald Trump so
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.400]  hard?
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.720]  Because he represents honesty and he represents the truth.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:27.480]  And yeah, you're showing some you're showing clips of I mean, of not only his father and
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.640]  assassinated, but but his uncle being assassinated.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.880]  Never mind Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.160]  Never mind Malcolm X.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.900]  I mean, Malcolm X in one of the one of the statements that Malcolm X said is anybody
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:44.320]  that calls themselves a liberal, liberal Democrat, he said, be very careful.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.320]  He talked about liberals.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.320]  Right.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.380]  And he was very careful about somebody who says they're liberal.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:51.680]  And then a couple of days later, when he gave that speech, he was dead.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.680]  He was assassinated.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:03:00.260]  So, you know, that at that time in our history, physical assassinations were much
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:01.680]  easier to get away with.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.000]  And then, of course, you could hide everything in classified or it's under investigation.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.920]  Now physical assassinations would be very, very difficult to get away with because everybody's
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.280]  got a damn camera, you know, but that's why they assassinate, you know, with lawfare
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.280]  and lies.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:23.160]  And I really feel and see that's their desperation button is I see political assassination coming
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.160]  roaring back.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.400]  That's and my gut's never wrong, General.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.600]  Yeah, boy, you know, I mean, this is the time and I hope it is because I hate
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.520]  to think that.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:40.080]  But I will tell you that these people are not going to wake up tomorrow morning, Alex
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.760]  audience and go, you know what, I'm talking about these people, the World Economic Forum
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.120]  or the White House or the White House.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.100]  They're not going to wake up and go, you know what, we've screwed the American people
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.100]  so bad.
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:54.320]  You know, let's let's turn the energy spigots back on.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.720]  Let's get rid of this cultural bullshit inside of our education system.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.980]  Let's stop with the CRT.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:02.120]  Let's stop with the drag queen hour.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.960]  Let's fund the police.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.520]  Let's go ahead and build a wall.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.720]  Let's go ahead and stop this invasion.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.720]  Let's get the fence.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.200]  They could be in charge of a big win and have domination through American culture.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.600]  They'd be 10 times more powerful, but they have they have a needle dick.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.100]  Why do the globalists hate us so much?
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.640]  Why do they have it out for us?
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:29.520]  They hate us because they hate just authentic, honest people who they cannot control.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.600]  And I and you know, I mean, yours truly here.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:38.480]  It's like when I in my when I was in the tail end of my military time, you know, one
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.280]  of the one of the and this is public.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:46.280]  You know, one of the reasons why I was I was told to leave basically a year early from
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.200]  a job that normally would be three years was because I wouldn't toe the line for the
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:56.080]  talking points that that this was on the run, that Al Qaeda was on the run and no
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.080]  longer a threat.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.640]  I just wouldn't tell the line because that isn't the truth.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.200]  It's just a mask.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.020]  It's just six feet.
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:05.560]  It's just nonessential businesses.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.000]  It's just nonessential workers.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.540]  It's just until we work it out.
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.080]  It's just a bar.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.240]  It's just a restaurant.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.160]  It's just nursing homes.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.000]  It's just schools.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.320]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.880]  It's just until the cases go down.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.120]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.960]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.400]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.960]  It's just gyms, salons, spas and sporting events.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.440]  It's just churches and mosques.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.160]  It's just singing.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.800]  It's just travel.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.280]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.280]  It's just for the greater good.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.160]  It's just fact checking, not censorship.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.160]  It's just mandatory.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.960]  It isn't just at all.
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.960]  Visit defendjones.com to help fight back today.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:13.040]  The show that breaks through the mainstream media's lives, Alex Jones.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:17.360]  When they offer you things, they shine this light at the end of the hall and the light
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.480]  is a very easy light to grab hold of.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.360]  They don't want to worry about it.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.360]  You're going to get taken care of.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.360]  Wait till you get out.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.160]  You're going to be put on this board, that board.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.640]  You're going to be given all kinds of things.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.560]  You're going to be taken care of, right?
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.240]  I'm like, that's bullshit.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.280]  We're talking about people's lives here.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.280]  We're talking about...
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.000]  Of course, you were vindicated right after you warned that Al-Qaeda through ISIS had
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.480]  a huge resurgence.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:48.000]  Oh, my God, it was in 24 or 26 countries, if I remember right at the time, and they
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.960]  were exploding all over Africa, all over the Middle East and all over Central Asia,
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.800]  as well as here in this country.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.600]  That's one of the things that the Obama administration didn't want to do, so didn't want to talk
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.320]  about and didn't want to have to admit to, right?
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:07.040]  So they want this country and they're not going to wake up.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.560]  They're going to continue to triple down.
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:13.000]  So we're going to see more of this same stuff.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.920]  You showed the pictures of the mosquitoes, the Bill Gates Foundation spraying mosquitoes.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.760]  We're already talking about masking again.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:26.280]  We're going to see corporations going to start putting the six feet, all this kind of madness
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.280]  again.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.680]  And the American people, we need to beg out of that.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.800]  We need to say, nope, we ain't going to do it.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:37.880]  And we need to find other outlets for us to be able to operate.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.240]  And isn't the resistance to that an example of victory in the few minutes we have left?
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.140]  Any other key points you'd like to add?
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:45.880]  My big concern is false flags.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:50.280]  In your research, obviously, a cyber attack can be blamed on somebody.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.560]  They're trying to say all the conservatives are white supremacists.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.160]  I'm worried they'll attack a black church or a college.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.080]  They're really pushing that narrative.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.520]  What do you see in your false flag wheelhouse?
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.000]  And I want to get you back on soon, so I'm going to read the book.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.360]  I read your last book, How to Fight A.I.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.960]  Tell us about that.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.240]  Yeah.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:14.760]  So one thing on false flags, it's very easy to train a militia of a bunch of white dudes
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:18.360]  up in the, you know, up in the boony somewhere in this country and then get them out
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:22.840]  there to do something and make sure that that, you know, that that they're all taken
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.840]  care of.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:24.840]  Right.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.920]  Easy to do that and make it appear as though it's some white, you know, Christian national
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.920]  Nazi group.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920]  Right.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.920]  And then they blame and they do something.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:33.920]  Biden's telegram.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.680]  He says the number one threat is white terrorists with almost no, it's almost non-existent.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.680]  Yeah.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.640]  So, you know, expand on that.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.640]  We got a few minutes.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.640]  Expand on that.
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.040]  Well, I mean, so these are easy things to do, folks.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.920]  These are these are these false flags.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.920]  We call them.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.160]  These are easy things to create.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:57.840]  Now, if you have another element called a bunch of illegals.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.400]  So nobody's looking for them in, you know, hometown USA.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.400]  Right.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.360]  Nobody's looking for their brother or their or their or their uncle.
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.000]  It's just a bunch of illegals that are being trained.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.920]  And these are we have we have people coming into this coming into America from like
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.600]  one hundred and sixty five, one hundred and sixty eight countries.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:20.360]  Do you remember just six months ago, they had three illegal groups in Texas commit mass
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.800]  shootings and they tried to say white supremacists did it, but it didn't work, so they shut
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.800]  it down.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.800]  Is that what you're getting at?
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.880]  Yes, that's exactly what I'm getting at.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:32.140]  And so they're going to try to they'll they'll test they'll test the waters and
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.160]  you're going to see these false flags.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.560]  We have got to be able to analyze them quickly.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.600]  We've got to be able to if we still have access to the Internet, we have to be able
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.360]  to get the word out quickly.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:47.060]  We've got to use the influencers that we have to say, hey, you know, don't fall into this
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.420]  trap that they want.
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:53.340]  They want this trap of they want it to be to where, you know, the American people
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.700]  start to become violent.
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:58.360]  We have got to call for this is nonviolence, right?
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:04.000]  This is we have got to be so smart about what they are going to try to lure Americans
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.200]  into doing.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.200]  OK.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.880]  And this is part of this false flag.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.480]  Now, if they also do cyber attacks, simultaneous.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.480]  Right.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.400]  At the same time where they're shutting down and they can segment the Internet, they don't
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.560]  just have to shut down the entire Internet.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.560]  They can segment.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.040]  They can only send this to their sites.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.040]  Exactly.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.240]  They're going to hit with a cyber attack, claim it's the Russians.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.240]  They've already said the right wing Trump's going to work with the Russians to shut
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.240]  the web up.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.080]  They shut it down to shut us up.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.780]  That's why they've been trying to get rid of every local talk show host that's on
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:34.040]  AM and FM.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.600]  That's a patriot is because they're still worried about those systems.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.440]  And in the world of A.I., this is how to fight A.I.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:50.760]  In this world, which is really important, they could use false videos of you, of me,
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:56.920]  of Trump, of high profile people making statements, right, crazy statements or making
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.320]  statements that sound legitimate.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.360]  And it's and it looks just like this background.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.280]  I mean, there's a truck mom goes off at a black college and it's Alex Jones or Trump
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.280]  or General Flynn saying, good job, blow more stuff up.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280]  We never said that.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.280]  Exactly.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.280]  Exactly.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.280]  Exactly.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.240]  And now what you have to do is you're on your you're on the defense.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.480]  And now you've got to go out there and fight some some media thing.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:24.240]  And you got, you know, ABC, NBC, CBS, you got all the big major networks, the cable
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.120]  news networks that are going, look, did you see what General Flynn said?
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.480]  Did you see what Alex Jones said?
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.780]  Did you see what these people are talking about?
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:34.840]  And it's not those it's it's none of that, right?
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:35.840]  It's none of that.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.120]  The whole thing is fake.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.560]  The whole thing is a poser, right?
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.560]  It's a poser.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.560]  Well, here's a microcosm.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.560]  I'm there on January 6, trying to get everybody over where Trump's stage was on
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.960]  the northeast side by the Supreme Court.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.880]  And I get up and say it got thousands to not go in Wall Street Journal still ran
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.880]  headlines.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:53.880]  I said attack the Capitol.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.360]  Now, thank God we still had the Internet.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.360]  I was banned.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.020]  But other people got the video out.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.020]  They had to retract.
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:02.520]  But if we're not online, they'll be able to do that.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.680]  They'll be able to do that.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.120]  And they will use and they will be given they will be given access to the emergency
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:11.520]  broadcast system by this administration.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.520]  I guarantee that.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:16.800]  So if we see if we start to hear about the emergency broadcast system being tested
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:22.540]  and used, I really think that we're we're the real potential exists.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:26.080]  And it's this is in Klaus Schwab's words, right?
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.080]  How the enemy telegraphs.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:34.560]  You know, he says he used that a cyber attack so vast it disconnects the Internet.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.280]  Klaus Schwab's words.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:41.720]  So I actually when he said that, it was like he said it and he doesn't say things
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.840]  just off the cuff.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.800]  He says things that are so, so prepared.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.080]  And when he said that and then he didn't talk about it again and nobody questioned
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.080]  him on it.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.880]  Like, what the hell is this guy talking about?
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:58.200]  I thought the World Economic Forum had something to do with economics, had something to do
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:01.840]  with our financial system, had something to do with, you know, there's nothing good
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.840]  about this.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.200]  No, it's the corporate intelligence agency that's taken over every aspect.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.200]  General Flynn.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.200]  Incredible.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.200]  Forty five minutes with us.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200]  General Flynn dot com.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.600]  Everybody should get How to Fight A.I.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.600]  I'm going to read it.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.080]  I'm going to go order it today.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.720]  General Flynn dot com.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.760]  Thank you so much.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.280]  We now have Joe Biggs on the line from prison.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.480]  Would you like to do 60 seconds before we go to him just on your view on what just
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.480]  happened?
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:29.960]  You're talking to Joe or myself, I mean, you, General Flynn, do you have any comments
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.960]  on.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:31.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.920]  I mean, I think that I think that what's going on with our people that are that are
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.960]  being held as political prisoners, this is madness.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.960]  This is sheer madness.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:45.360]  I mean, there's these people the other day that protested outside of a of a plant
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.560]  of a Planned Parenthood site.
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:48.560]  Five of them are going to jail.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.560]  They've all been convicted.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.440]  I mean, one of them, I think, is a 61 year old woman.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.760]  I mean, these people are out there protecting the life of the of of babies and the unborn
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.800]  and the and the Planned Parenthood.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.680]  They're actually killing babies after the fact.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:04.600]  And they knew it after they were born, after they were brought into this world.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.400]  I mean, they're going to put these people in jail for upwards of 10 years.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.800]  These are these are political issues, political prisoners.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.640]  And we have got to stand against this.
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.840]  And trust me, this is not this is why they don't want us back in power.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.160]  This is why they're fighting tooth and nail to keep Trump out and to keep guys like me
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:25.760]  from going back into government to help him, because I know Trump will pardon people
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.760]  like Joe Biggs.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.760]  There's no doubt.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.760]  General Flynn dot com.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:29.760]  God bless you.
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:30.760]  And thank you so much, General.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.760]  Absolutely.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.760]  God bless.
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.760]  Thank you.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.760]  All right.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:35.760]  Wow.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.440]  Now let's go to Joe Biggs, who was was just wrongfully convicted and sentenced to
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.280]  17 years in prison.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:47.480]  Former Infowars reporter, totally innocent, charged with terrorism.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.840]  Terrorism sentencing for being there when.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.160]  Ray Epps broke through the fence.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.760]  This is this is insane, Joe.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.240]  I love you, brother.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.640]  And you know, you're a political prisoner and we appreciate you.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:05.360]  I know you only get 15 minutes per call when you've got a call back at 15 against.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:08.680]  We've got about 12 minutes before they hang up on you that will be waiting for you
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.760]  to come back on again in about 30 minutes.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.440]  But Joe, how are you holding up?
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.440]  And you've got the floor.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.440]  I know it's all right.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:16.440]  You know, my heart hurts.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.440]  You know, this is ridiculous.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:23.440]  You know, they said that shaking a fence was tantamount to terrorism.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:28.480]  The judge told me that and they want to send a message to Americans that if you
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:33.080]  go to these events, if you are part of political groups, they're going to throw you
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.800]  in prison for a long time.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.860]  They want you scared.
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.400]  They don't want you to go out and vote.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.400]  They want people scared before it's time to vote.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.480]  And that's why all this is happening right now.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:12.580]  My idea was pop one of these bad boys overhead shot, please.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:16.820]  Look how full this model is.
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:19.840]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.820]  Right to the top with these 95% of humanoids.
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:28.420]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%.
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.700]  Some are maybe 10.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.440]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.520]  This is 95%.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.520]  Super-constant.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.520]  It's like taking one pill.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:41.140]  It's like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:42.140]  It's that powerful.
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.140]  Or more.

[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:01.740]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high-quality
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.860]  coffee has not been available, and that's because the prices went up too high for the
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:08.160]  raw beans, and the quality had gone down some.
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.400]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us, but now we have brought
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:19.500]  back the coffee, and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.920]  and veteran-operated.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.120]  It's powered by the company, Minuteman Coffee.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:31.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest coffee that I have
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.120]  ever drank.

[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.660]  All you've got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.100]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund our Operation A360 win.

[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:52.980]  And finally, the best tasting dark roast chip of the spear, now exclusively available
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:55.600]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.240]  Get your coffee now.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.480]  Coffee has not been available at Infowarsstore.com for two years, because the price went up
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.760]  too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:09.200]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.240]  But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees,
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.480]  I was blown away, we finally have three great coffees that are the best I have to
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.860]  offer available to you right now.
[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:21.120]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.820]  It smells amazing, and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:30.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single-source Colombian coffees are now available at Infowarsstore.com
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.920]  exclusively.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.760]  Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:35.760]  Tastes great.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.760]  It's the strong one.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.760]  Really strong.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.860]  But these are all close second and thirds.
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.360]  Medium roast, wig of America.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.360]  Whoo!
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.360]  That's what my go-to.
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:47.900]  Dark roast, tip of the spear, tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:48.900]  strong.
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:49.900]  Gives you that pep.
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:53.440]  They're all three available at Infowarsstore.com and the Thunder operation.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:57.860]  And each order gets a pocket Constitution Citizen rule book.
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:01.520]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.560]  concentrated, high-quality bone broth there is.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:10.680]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented, amazing, then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:16.080]  dose of beet pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.800]  gets crazier from there.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:18.920]  It's about to sell out.
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.460]  We haven't had it in stock for years.

[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.440]  We're selling out ultimate bone broth at Infowarsstore.com, 40% off, about to sell out.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:05.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:24.760]  The man who stands tall against globalist agendas, Alex Jones.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:25.760]  This is ridiculous.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.519]  We went there that day with no plan, with nothing.
[01:20:28.519 --> 01:20:33.840]  We were there like every other American, but it's because we're a political group.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:38.160]  We knew that there was going to be a head on us as soon as Joe Biden mentioned us in the
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.760]  first presidential debate.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:44.320]  I knew that there was something going on with this, and sure enough, even Enrique called
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:48.720]  it, they're going to put us in chains, and sure enough they have.
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:55.440]  We went through a long, drawn out trial, five months, and not once did the FBI ever
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:57.080]  have proof of a plan.
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.099]  There was no intelligence of a plan.
[01:20:59.099 --> 01:21:02.880]  Not one of the rats that came forward said that there was a plan.
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:09.559]  Everyone said that there was zero plan of anything happening that day by us, and yet they got
[01:21:09.559 --> 01:21:13.639]  us for conspiracy to plan this.
[01:21:13.639 --> 01:21:17.880]  They said we had this meeting of the mind without ever actually saying anything, and
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:23.960]  it happened on the fly at the first breach, so apparently we all had this telekinesis
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:24.960]  power.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:28.599]  We all agreed that from there on out, when this first fence went down and everyone walked
[01:21:28.599 --> 01:21:32.639]  forward, that we were all going to stop the certification of the election, and that's
[01:21:32.639 --> 01:21:38.519]  what they got the jury to say, and the jury would have convicted us of sorcery and witchcraft
[01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:42.680]  and murder if that was up to vote on.
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.360]  Well, Joe, you're right.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:49.040]  This is the Salem witch trials 10.0, and what do you make of Ray Epps?
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:54.000]  He was there actually saying, go into Capitol and picking up shines and ramming into police,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.440]  but he's the little darling that must be protected.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:01.040]  Well, this is the interesting thing about the trial.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:08.300]  They altered evidence, there was witness tampering, there was witness intimidation by the FBI.
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:12.120]  They rigged this to a point where we had nothing that we could do.
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:19.320]  They only allowed in a video of a fence that goes down in front of me in my area,
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.840]  and there's no video of me breaking the fence.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:25.200]  There's a video of my hand on the fence, then my hand comes off the fence, and then later
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.120]  on the fence breaks after other people have grabbed it and ripped it, but they only showed
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.120]  that video.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.120]  The real video...
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.120]  Hey, well, they charged Owen.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:39.880]  Owen is up resentencing in two weeks, one of your fellow reporters and friends,
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.960]  and they said he should have known the fences had been knocked down.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.599]  So just because he walked onto the property, they charged him.
[01:22:45.599 --> 01:22:47.599]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:22:47.599 --> 01:22:52.160]  So the fence actually goes down in front of Ray Epps, but the video that the government
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:58.200]  gets to be allowed in and the judge allows in shows a green glitch where the fence goes
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.200]  down first.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:02.840]  You can't see all the people rushing up on the stage, and it only shows the fence
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.720]  breaking around the area that we're standing at, me and my buddy.
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:10.519]  So it glitches out the part where it's in front of Ray Epps where all the people are
[01:23:10.519 --> 01:23:13.120]  searching, and then they go in front of the judge and go, look, see, these guys are the
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.639]  first ones that broke it.
[01:23:14.639 --> 01:23:18.880]  These guys are the ones that broke the fence and led the charge to the Capitol, and
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.240]  that is not the truth.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:26.040]  That is not what happened, and videos will come out, this is insane, and they want to
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:30.240]  take me and put me in jail for the rest of my life.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:33.559]  I'm about to turn 40, 17 years, I mean, really, what am I going to do when I get
[01:23:33.559 --> 01:23:34.559]  out?
[01:23:34.559 --> 01:23:35.559]  This is insane.
[01:23:35.559 --> 01:23:37.559]  There's no way that this could stick.
[01:23:37.559 --> 01:23:38.559]  This is a travesty.
[01:23:38.559 --> 01:23:43.160]  To say that the shaking of a fence, that my putting a hand on a fence is tantamount
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:49.920]  to terrorism, they're putting me in the same category as Osama bin Laden and every
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:50.920]  other terrorist out there.
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:54.200]  So obviously you're going to appeal this, but let's talk about how we support you and your
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.720]  daughter and your family.
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:59.680]  FreeJoeBiggs.com, and I'm told you've only got 15 minutes until they cut you off.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:01.720]  Are you going to be able to call back in, or how does that work?
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:06.240]  Yeah, yeah, I'm sitting right here guarding this phone like my life depends on it, so
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.240]  no one's getting over here, no one's going to mess with me.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:12.080]  No one messes with Joe Biggs in this place anyways.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:15.200]  Do people, are you saying people see through the fact that you're a political
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.480]  president?
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:22.080]  Everywhere I go, I can tell you this, everywhere I go people are praying for me.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.639]  Every officer I meet puts their head down and they go, I can't believe this is happening
[01:24:25.639 --> 01:24:26.800]  to you, son.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.760]  Every US Marshal has done that.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:32.519]  The only people who don't give a flying F about what's happening to me are the people
[01:24:32.519 --> 01:24:34.599]  that are in the FBI for the most part.
[01:24:34.599 --> 01:24:37.480]  There are some good, I'm not going to get you wrong, but the FBI for the most
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:43.120]  part, the evil, stinky, conniving scoundrels that want to just see us thrown in jail
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.120]  for the rest of our lives.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:48.599]  But the US Marshals, the Air Marshals, the police, the sheriffs, the people in every
[01:24:48.599 --> 01:24:52.400]  jail I've been to, everybody comes up to me and shakes my hand and goes, this is crazy
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.440]  what's happening to you, this isn't right, we can't believe this.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:58.800]  The prisoners even come up to us with respect, the black gang members, they all
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.400]  come up to us and go, man, we can't believe this is happening and we hope Trump wins,
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.760]  we hope he pardons you because you don't deserve to be here.
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:05.760]  You're not a criminal.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.599]  Well, it's the arrogance of the globalists that has done this and have you not seen your
[01:25:09.599 --> 01:25:16.000]  support supercharged, I'm guessing, since all the indictments against Trump?
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.080]  It's hard to see with the support in here, you know, like, you know, I'm limited on
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.760]  what it is I can and can't see, but I hear about it, you know, I get messages
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:23.760]  and stuff like that.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:27.800]  I hear that there is support, but you know, it's really hard, you know, they really
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.960]  constrict what I'm able to see from inside.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.800]  Where are you right now, where are you going?
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.040]  And obviously you need money for appeal.
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.040]  People say we're always asked for money.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.920]  Yeah, we're in a war against the globalists, folks.
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:40.960]  How do people support you, Joe?
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:46.240]  Well, right now I'm at the D.C. jail, what a lot of people call the D.C. gulag, the one
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:50.280]  spot that had a, you know, were treating prisoners, Brad, at one point.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:55.000]  Owen said when he was there that he would wake up and literally covered in roaches eating
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  his skin.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.360]  Yeah, that's how it was in the building where they first originally had people.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.720]  Now we're in what's called the CTF and it's a lot nicer.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:07.120]  It's not as bad, but the food is horrible, like you can't eat the food here.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:10.240]  It is not edible in any kind of way whatsoever.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:14.680]  You know, to your second point, if you really want to help out, you know, I need money
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:16.200]  to help support my daughter.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:21.120]  You know, they have taken away my military retirement, it's as if I never even served
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.120]  in the military.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:25.040]  You know, the prosecutor gets up and starts, you know, before sentencing because I just
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.840]  want everybody to know that I don't want to take away from Joe Biggs the fact that
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:32.680]  he's an American hero and that he served our country, but basically him touching
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:36.519]  that fence just taints him out to terrorism, his hand touching that fence was the
[01:26:36.519 --> 01:26:40.320]  same as an explosion going off and sending travel through bodies and killing people,
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.720]  um, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:46.519]  And the judge has now said that in the Trump January 6 case, she compared it to 9-11 and
[01:26:46.519 --> 01:26:47.519]  the Boston bombing.
[01:26:47.519 --> 01:26:48.519]  Yeah.
[01:26:48.519 --> 01:26:52.360]  So if you really want to help me out, I need the help I got, I mean the appeals
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:55.880]  case, it takes years, you know, I'm not getting out anytime soon.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.559]  Um, I've already been in for three years almost, you know, I'm, I'm about to come
[01:26:59.559 --> 01:27:03.280]  up with my three years of that three years, I've been in solitary confinement for
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.360]  a year and a half, um, you know, and I'm, you know, praise be to God that I haven't
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.660]  lost my mind from that.
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:13.480]  Everybody wonders how I can still keep, um, you know, my sanity and how I'm still able
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:14.480]  to communicate with people.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:20.320]  Well, I saw the left makes fun of you that you cried when they said 17 years, but
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:26.840]  I mean, obviously you're not 17 years and you've been given this evil tyranny and
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.840]  can't see your daughter.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:28.840]  I would cry too.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:30.400]  They are sick, evil people.
[01:27:30.519 --> 01:27:34.720]  Well, actually, no, the 17 years came after the fact that I cried, I cried when I brought
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:38.639]  up my daughter, but the tears that I had were from my daughter and my daughter alone.
[01:27:38.639 --> 01:27:41.519]  Not anything that the judge had to say to the prosecution.
[01:27:41.519 --> 01:27:45.400]  Um, after I spoke and I had, you know, I had, I had gotten emotional about my daughter.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.680]  I sat down and that's when the judge read the 17 years.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:52.080]  Oh, so they even spun that, that you cried after the sentence, you cried for your daughter.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.080]  Yeah.
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:54.080]  I cried for my daughter.
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.080]  That was it.
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.080]  There was no anybody in that courtroom.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.800]  I got letters today saying it was emotional to hear you talk about your daughter, but
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.200]  It had nothing to do with the sentence thing.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.960]  I sat there and took that like a man.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.880]  I looked at him and do whatever I had to do.
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:08.040]  You know, when I walked out of there with my head held high and I'm going to continue
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.040]  to fight.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.040]  It's a show show.
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.040]  They lie about everything.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.040]  Don't they?
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.040]  Yeah, of course.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:16.880]  I saw, we saw an article on our, our little prison tablet they gave us last night.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:21.440]  It was on Yahoo saying that proud boys cry at trial, not one of us cried about anything
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.440]  like that.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.680]  It was only when we brought up the fact, the guys of us who have kids, which is most
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:29.660]  of us, except for one of us, I think, um, we brought up our children or saw our children
[01:28:30.519 --> 01:28:34.559]  in the, in the, in the pews, we got teary-eyed to think about that, to know that our children,
[01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:38.660]  our children aren't going to see us again for a long time, um, from here, you know,
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:42.860]  you know, go to Joe free, joebinks.com, you know, help out that that money goes
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:47.820]  either to my, uh, appeal or it goes to my mother and daughters to help out.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:58.620]  I don't get any of the first way in any kind of way separately.
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:02.139]  We got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[01:29:02.139 --> 01:29:06.620]  really, really good news because it's a great product you love and people want it.
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:12.059]  And it funds our operation of 360 wind bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest

[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:23.019]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[01:29:23.019 --> 01:29:26.580]  God gave it to us and it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:30.100]  Your leading brands are like 70% humanoid.
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:34.620]  Most brands are 5% and that still does a great thing for you.
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:39.420]  This is the strongest anybody makes 95% for humanoid.
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:41.980]  I am so glad this is back.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.620]  I have been out of this myself for months.

[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.280]  Thought it was next week.
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.280]  I come in this morning.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:04.740]  It's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.

[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.460]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:36.540]  This is 95%.

[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:41.180]  It's like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.180]  It's that powerful.
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:43.180]  Or more.

[01:32:56.830 --> 01:33:06.830]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:11.830]  The Patriots' choice and globalists dread.
[01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:15.830]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:17.830]  Go to Joe at FreeJoeBings.com.
[01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:18.830]  You know, help out.
[01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:24.830]  That money goes either to my appeals or it goes to my mother and daughter to help out.
[01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:27.830]  I don't get any of this personally in any kind of way.
[01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:29.830]  It's not going to help me buy a full house or car.
[01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:30.830]  Joe, we know that.
[01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:32.830]  You don't need to improvise, though.
[01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:35.830]  I think your bill's too low because it's going to take...
[01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:36.830]  I know how these bills work.
[01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:40.830]  It's going to cost a million bucks over the next few years for your appeal alone,
[01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:45.830]  and you're only asking for $75,000.
[01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:48.830]  Well, yeah, that was when we first had it.
[01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:53.830]  But, yeah, we're going to re-up that and change some stuff and redo some of the wording on it and ask for more.
[01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:58.830]  That was just from... I've had this stuff for a little while.
[01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:59.830]  Well, you're a great guy, brother.
[01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:03.830]  I know they're about to hang up on you in a minute, but just say as much as you want before they disconnect you.
[01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:06.830]  Well, I will say this.
[01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:09.830]  The next place I'm going to, I put in for Coleman Low.
[01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:10.830]  That's in Florida.
[01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:13.830]  That's the same spot they sent Martha Stewart to.
[01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:15.830]  It's obviously not the female wing.
[01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:17.830]  I'm sure that'd be a lot more fun.
[01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:22.830]  But they're sending me to possibly the Coleman Low, which is somewhere in Florida north of Orlando.
[01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:25.830]  Well, just say you're a woman. You can be in the female wing.
[01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:30.830]  I think a few of us have tried that already, and they look at us like we're crazy.
[01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:35.830]  I think unless you have Democrat on your voting card, they don't believe it.
[01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:38.830]  They'll just think that you're playing around.
[01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:41.830]  Well, it's good to hear you with so much humor.
[01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:44.830]  And we just keep asking Listers for help, because they're coming after everybody, folks.
[01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:45.830]  We're here on the front line.
[01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:48.830]  We're in a war for everybody, and we're not complaining at Listers.
[01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:53.830]  But if you don't support FreeJoeBigs.com, then you're supporting your own destruction.
[01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:57.830]  Yeah, I mean, look, first they came after me for shaking a fence.
[01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:59.830]  What next is it, you know?
[01:34:59.830 --> 01:35:04.830]  What's the next thing that's going to happen that they're going to say is tantamount to terrorism?
[01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:07.830]  You know, they blamed me for the very first breach.
[01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:09.830]  The judge looked me in the eyes and said-
[01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:12.830]  You have one minute remaining.
[01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:13.830]  My fault.
[01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:15.830]  I was using a bullhorn further back.
[01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:19.830]  There was a guy in front of me close to the gate where Ray Epps was.
[01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:22.830]  We call him Black Negaphone Guy because we don't know his name.
[01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:27.830]  But he was sitting there telling everybody, the men come to the front, get the women out of the front.
[01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:29.830]  We need to take the fence down. We need to push forward.
[01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:31.830]  We need to go after the cops. We need to get through.
[01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:32.830]  I've seen the videos.
[01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:36.830]  The left showed up dressed up like Trump supporters with the D.C. police, and they did it all.
[01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:38.830]  It's incredible.
[01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:40.830]  All right, they're about to disconnect you, Joe.
[01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:43.830]  FreeJoeBigs.com, you're going to call us back in 15 minutes?
[01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:44.830]  Yes, I am. I will be.
[01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:48.830]  Keep talking until the end. Just keep talking. Keep talking.
[01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:50.830]  Well, like I said, I appreciate everybody's help, man.
[01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:53.830]  Like, go there, help us out, and we would appreciate it.
[01:35:53.830 --> 01:36:01.830]  You know, it's interesting to see how the government has spun this entire situation.
[01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:04.830]  They have lied. They lied to the American people.
[01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:06.830]  The media helped it.
[01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:12.830]  The media sat there day in and day out and refused to report on the facts that we brought up during our trial, and only-
[01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:15.830]  Thank you for using Global Tell Link.
[01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:24.830]  Ruthless lawyers, ruthless Larry Fink, BlackRock, just ordering destruction of everything.
[01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:33.830]  No borders, human trafficking, fentanyl, pedophilia with children, world government, World War III with Russia.
[01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:39.830]  Sell out to China, political prisoners, total surveillance, censorship.
[01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:49.830]  And they've got all these yes men and women that are-
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:37:19.280]  Just going along with their own destruction. You know a lot of listeners have asked me where is Stuart Rhodes? Been trying to get him for a year. When he's been in jail. Where's Joe Biggs? I have the same lawyer as Joe Biggs. And the calculus was it'll make the judge mad if you're on air attacking him.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:21.280]  And...
[01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:27.070]  That's why. And then listeners are like, why aren't you talking about it? Well, I've
[01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:33.070]  been trying since he got sentenced to get him on. It took us two days, he's here. And you
[01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:38.070]  can say, well, just don't listen to the lawyers. I mean, it's his lawyer, Norm Pattis, and
[01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:48.070]  I get Norm's point. And so all I can do is comply with what people want. Because
[01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:52.070]  it's not my life. It's Joe's life. It's his lawyer. It's what they decided to do. So we'll
[01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:55.070]  have Joe on all the time when he's able to call in now. I've been trying to get, you
[01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:59.070]  know, they're like, well, just we want to piss people off. And maybe that's the
[01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:02.070]  wrong strategy. I'm the type of guy that's going to talk crap. You saw me to these
[01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:08.070]  judges in my show trials. I say, you're a crook. You're a tyrant. Because they're liars.
[01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:12.070]  The judge is like, he's got $400 million. I'm like, you're a liar. She's like,
[01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:18.070]  no, jury, he's a liar. No, you're a liar.
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:48.340]  And so, that's where we're at. But now, boom. We're going to get Norm on too about this, his lawyer, who's also been my lawyer, who's a famous criminal lawyer and a good guy. People say, oh, your lawyer did a terrible job at Sandy Hook Trial. They didn't let us talk. They gave our lawyers a list of like five things you can talk about for a show trial I was already found guilty. They just found Giuliani guilty. A judge did.
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:53.860]  Judges don't find you guilty. Folks, we're not in Kansas anymore. Have you figured that out yet?
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:39:01.580]  So, during the five-month trial, I'm like, hey, I really want him on. I want Joe on.
[01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:05.500]  I want you on. I want to support him. And they're like, listen, we think there's some
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:10.660]  humanity in this judge, and he's totally innocent, so we don't want to antagonize them.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:16.680]  So we want to just try to see if they've got, and they don't have humanity. So now
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:20.380]  I can talk about it. And you're like, well, you should have talked about it. All
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:24.360]  I can do is honor people that are in jail and do what they want. I'm not going to sit
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:28.080]  there and make your decisions for them. And plus, what does it do, saying the judge is
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:32.600]  a crook? They love it. They'll be promoted. They'll be out playing, the judge is probably
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:37.600]  playing golf today. Feels great. Has no sense of injustice. Ray Epps can run around
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.680]  and say, attack the Capitol, go on the Capitol. I orchestrated it. He's sending his
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:48.680]  text messages. He's ramming signs into police. Joe Biggs is like shaking a fence.
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:55.220]  Seventeen years, bitch. Every three years in jail. You're in a habit of solitary confinement.
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:40:00.740]  I mean, it's just like, and you're around these people and you, but I'll tell you
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:06.140]  the unifying thing about them. Leftists and their minions are dishonorable, cowardly
[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:12.900]  nobodies. And the world's waking up to them. The thing is, they're such crap
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:15.580]  that I don't even wish harm on them. I just want them to get out of my life. Leave
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:21.200]  me alone, go away. Well, they're not going to go away. And they're not going to leave
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:24.800]  everybody alone. But blisters should use their heads. It's not about me. It's not
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:31.280]  about Joe Biggs. It's about understanding things. It probably was smart to not have
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:36.280]  Joe Biggs on my show a bunch while he was facing this kangaroo trial. Cause I get,
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:41.000]  you know, I think Norm's right. I think if Joe had talked crap and they'd all been
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:47.540]  on the show talking smack, that judge, you hit him and what the feds asked for 45 years
[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:57.040]  in prison. Cause the left likes it. They're like, Oh, you don't like us putting you
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:07.380]  in jail? Cockroaches all over you. Well, guess what? You get 45 bitch. But I just
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:11.220]  love the other Patriots that are out there. They're like armchair quarterback. Why didn't
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:16.140]  Alex Jones? And it's on so many subject. Why didn't Alex Jones having him on? Why
[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:22.980]  he doesn't care about those people. One former talk show host that worked here.
[01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:26.940]  He just kept saying I was censoring when I wasn't. I was really upset. He was lying
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:29.860]  and saying I was censoring. I never even barely even watched the show. I'm like,
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:33.980]  why are you saying that? Oh, he doesn't care about his crew. He sent there. I didn't
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:39.580]  send Joe Biggs there. Joe Biggs hadn't worked here for years. I didn't send anybody
[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:45.200]  into the damn Capitol, but Joe didn't do anything in the Capitol. So the idea that
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:51.540]  I'm sending people and I'm doing this and I'm all this crap, it's ridiculous.
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:56.420]  But I'm done talking about that. Cause it's not about me. It's not about any of this.
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:01.700]  It's about the big picture of people sit back in their armchairs and they think they
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:07.580]  know how stuff works and they don't. Now Joe's scheduled to call in about seven, eight
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:13.380]  minutes. So let's do this. Let's hear Greg Reese's new report and some other little
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:17.780]  important promo pieces. And then Joe should be able to get back in in about six, seven,
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:22.020]  eight minutes. We'll go to him. I guess technically eight minutes from now I'll be able to
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:29.820]  call him. And then I'm going to, I promise to do a deep dive on the ADL and I promise
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:34.860]  to hit some of this other news. And so I'm going to do that and I'm going to do it more
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:41.580]  tomorrow night to four to 6 PM. MTG is going to be in studio and a lot more. So look
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:44.900]  for that. But I appreciate the crew coming in on Saturday and I appreciate general
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:50.700]  Flynn being here and I appreciate everybody else that's supporting the show and spreading
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:55.540]  the word because we're in the situation we're in and the globalist aren't going
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:43:01.180]  to go away without major opposition for everything. The globalist hit us with God
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:05.460]  through mother nature has given us the answer. I don't have to sell you on CBD oil,

[01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:05.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:19.670]  And now, for the truth only you can handle, it's the Alex Jones Show with Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.670 --> 01:47:23.390]  Here's Harari saying we're going to make aliens on Earth.
[01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:27.550]  We're going to merge the machines and be a new life form, a new ruling alien class on
[01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:28.550]  Earth.
[01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:34.890]  See, they're building the aliens, the biomedical AI merger with our flesh, the raping of humanity.
[01:47:34.890 --> 01:47:39.650]  It's the same story from Roswell in the late 40s with Colonel Corso, heavily promoted everywhere,
[01:47:39.650 --> 01:47:42.130]  by the biggest publishers, by the biggest movie makers.
[01:47:42.130 --> 01:47:46.050]  That was system funded because they don't want you to understand the full spectrum
[01:47:46.050 --> 01:47:49.610]  of interdimensional contact and the fact that it's always been here.
[01:47:49.610 --> 01:47:53.170]  These things actually aren't alien, they're part of our existence and part of our story
[01:47:53.170 --> 01:47:54.170]  here.
[01:47:54.170 --> 01:47:55.170]  If anything's the aliens, it's us.
[01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:59.210]  We're here on this planet by God and there's these things that are already basically here.
[01:47:59.210 --> 01:48:01.330]  We've probably not been here as long as this thing's been here.
[01:48:01.330 --> 01:48:03.270]  If you really read the ancient text of the Bible.
[01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:06.110]  So they don't want you to know it's far more complex and they're not in control of
[01:48:06.110 --> 01:48:07.110]  it.
[01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:11.270]  All they're doing is being demonically inspired by these creatures that will only
[01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:12.990]  give them hellraiser vision.
[01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:17.870]  It will only give them how to have technology for evil because it doesn't like us.
[01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:22.110]  This is just a training camp where our father has put us here.
[01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:26.850]  We think we're only living on one life so that we're in this super scared position
[01:48:26.850 --> 01:48:30.970]  but having all these spiritual and ancestral intergalactic interdimensional memories.
[01:48:30.970 --> 01:48:36.790]  It's all a giant three dimensional real scenario war game and they don't want you to know that.
[01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:39.150]  They don't want you to understand they signed on the wrong team.
[01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:43.850]  They joined with the destructive force, the evil force so they could have power during
[01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:46.090]  the third dimensional simulation.
[01:48:46.090 --> 01:48:49.770]  It's a three dimensional genetic universal simulation.
[01:48:49.770 --> 01:48:50.770]  It's a real simulation.
[01:48:50.770 --> 01:48:52.330]  It's just that it's forever war.
[01:48:52.330 --> 01:48:57.050]  You don't die when you die folks, you're an electrochemical multidimensional creature.
[01:48:57.050 --> 01:48:59.930]  This is only one lowest manifestation of it.
[01:48:59.930 --> 01:49:01.450]  They have glorified heavenly bodies.
[01:49:01.450 --> 01:49:03.790]  There's this first heaven, the second heaven, the third heaven.
[01:49:03.790 --> 01:49:06.650]  It's all right there for you to understand.
[01:49:06.650 --> 01:49:07.650]  And again, what is the heaven?
[01:49:07.650 --> 01:49:08.650]  A dimension.
[01:49:08.650 --> 01:49:12.470]  They are programming that aliens are these little stupid gray things and they want to
[01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:14.490]  kidnap us at night and take stuff from us.
[01:49:14.490 --> 01:49:16.650]  And there is some evidence for some lower level creatures.
[01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:18.830]  They're like a biological android.
[01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:24.530]  This whole big UFO thing is a distraction that, oh, the aliens are harassing our ships.
[01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:26.730]  The aliens are harassing our troops.
[01:49:26.730 --> 01:49:29.770]  No, that's the globalists with their advanced technology playing games.
[01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:36.490]  So they can brand contact with the angels and God as the devil when really we're here
[01:49:36.490 --> 01:49:37.490]  with the devil.
[01:49:37.490 --> 01:49:38.490]  We're not locked in for the devil.
[01:49:38.490 --> 01:49:39.490]  They're locked in with us.
[01:49:39.490 --> 01:49:44.570]  Well, the bill of rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech
[01:49:44.570 --> 01:49:47.790]  that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[01:49:47.790 --> 01:49:52.090]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think.
[01:49:52.090 --> 01:49:53.490]  And that's corporations.
[01:49:53.490 --> 01:49:55.810]  The left have wised up to this.
[01:49:55.850 --> 01:50:01.530]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it, the social
[01:50:01.530 --> 01:50:02.530]  media giants.
[01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:03.530]  And they are.
[01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:07.930]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them,
[01:50:07.930 --> 01:50:08.930]  prevent them from speaking.
[01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:12.330]  So far, the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the
[01:50:12.330 --> 01:50:14.010]  radio show host, Alex Jones.
[01:50:14.010 --> 01:50:18.050]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big
[01:50:18.050 --> 01:50:21.770]  tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:26.490]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can
[01:50:26.490 --> 01:50:27.490]  you ban this person?
[01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:33.090]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones's content
[01:50:33.090 --> 01:50:34.690]  will be a little harder to find.
[01:50:34.690 --> 01:50:39.090]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead
[01:50:39.090 --> 01:50:43.970]  attack dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working
[01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:45.390]  with big tech.
[01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:46.730]  People know what's true.
[01:50:46.730 --> 01:50:48.090]  They can smell it.
[01:50:48.090 --> 01:50:52.930]  Info Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:50:52.930 --> 01:50:55.810]  In a free country, everyone can be hurt.
[01:50:55.810 --> 01:51:02.370]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be hurt.
[01:51:02.370 --> 01:51:04.690]  It's a Saturday emergency broadcast.
[01:51:04.690 --> 01:51:10.010]  General Flynn, myself, lay out the globalist next move and how to stop them.
[01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:11.010]  Joe Biggs.
[01:51:11.010 --> 01:51:15.890]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:51:15.890 --> 01:51:22.770]  Knocked up in the D.C. gulag, can only get in 15 minutes at a time.
[01:51:22.770 --> 01:51:24.170]  You heard him about 15 minutes ago.
[01:51:24.170 --> 01:51:25.170]  Get cut off.
[01:51:25.170 --> 01:51:29.610]  We're waiting for his call again right now.
[01:51:29.610 --> 01:51:35.570]  The day we got greenlit to get him on the show, because again, the political persecutors
[01:51:35.570 --> 01:51:39.890]  attack you when you defend yourselves now that he's sentenced, he's ready to come on
[01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:40.890]  the show.
[01:51:40.890 --> 01:51:44.290]  We want to get Stuart Rhodes on all the political prisoners.
[01:51:44.290 --> 01:51:48.570]  Remember a few months ago, oh, Rams is going to be indicted, they said in a lawsuit against
[01:51:48.570 --> 01:51:49.570]  Fox.
[01:51:49.570 --> 01:51:50.570]  Didn't happen.
[01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:53.170]  They just create that illusion to get us to stop talking about it.
[01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:56.930]  Hey, all I know is he said he orchestrated his text messages and said, go into the
[01:51:56.930 --> 01:52:00.290]  Capitol and help ram signs into people, and he says, they'll sue you if you talk
[01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:01.290]  about it.
[01:52:01.290 --> 01:52:04.370]  And I'm sure they'll probably sue and have me defaulted, and the judge says I'm guilty
[01:52:04.370 --> 01:52:06.690]  and $85 billion to him.
[01:52:06.690 --> 01:52:10.050]  So what?
[01:52:10.050 --> 01:52:11.050]  He did it.
[01:52:11.050 --> 01:52:12.050]  He said it.
[01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:13.050]  It's going on.
[01:52:13.050 --> 01:52:19.090]  I'm not up about any of it, but I want to thank everybody that's gone to defendjones.com.
[01:52:19.090 --> 01:52:22.330]  Info Wars has stabilized, the bankruptcy looks like it's going through, everything
[01:52:22.330 --> 01:52:25.890]  I told the court was true, everything that media said was a lie, you've seen all
[01:52:25.890 --> 01:52:26.890]  that.
[01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:30.450]  We don't have $10 million versus $400 million.
[01:52:30.450 --> 01:52:35.170]  And I've got a year of legal bills built up that I've gotten a really good crop of
[01:52:35.170 --> 01:52:39.290]  new lawyers last year, they haven't been paid yet.
[01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:41.810]  And that's because the judge got lied to and told that I had all this money, so the
[01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:42.810]  judge said, well, he can pay his legal bills.
[01:52:43.570 --> 01:52:44.570]  And now the judge is like, wait, they didn't have any money.
[01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:48.130]  But I still have the old bill, that's about to all get fixed.
[01:52:48.130 --> 01:52:51.090]  The judge has signaled where he now realizes he was lied to.
[01:52:51.090 --> 01:52:55.090]  But for now, I need to pay that million dollars, like that's a lot of money.
[01:52:55.090 --> 01:52:57.490]  Not really in today's numbers, folks, with inflation.
[01:52:57.490 --> 01:53:02.290]  Trump has spent $67 million this year on lawyers, with hundreds of lawsuits and
[01:53:02.290 --> 01:53:04.570]  all the rest of it and all the criminal charges.
[01:53:04.570 --> 01:53:05.570]  Great.
[01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:06.570]  Trump needs support.
[01:53:06.570 --> 01:53:10.050]  Well, I don't need $67 million, I need a million dollars.
[01:53:10.050 --> 01:53:11.710]  Or we go off the air.
[01:53:11.710 --> 01:53:14.190]  Because if they shut me down, I can't be here.
[01:53:14.190 --> 01:53:18.550]  Infowarsstore.com funds free speech systems, great products you need.
[01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:22.850]  But defendjones.com is where you can make straight donations.
[01:53:22.850 --> 01:53:24.870]  And I want to thank the listeners for their support.
[01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:28.070]  I'm going to be thanking more of you tomorrow on the Sunday show.
[01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:29.070]  But you know who you are.
[01:53:29.070 --> 01:53:33.750]  I think we've raised $67,000, we can put defendjones.com on the screen.
[01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:39.150]  And I know I come to you and ask for your support.
[01:53:39.150 --> 01:53:40.350]  And my eyes aren't that good.
[01:53:40.350 --> 01:53:41.550]  What's the number there?
[01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:43.390]  It's $65,000.
[01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:44.950]  Sounds like a lot, folks.
[01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:50.550]  That's just 6% of what we need.
[01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:53.550]  But we're going to get there and I appreciate your support.
[01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:56.750]  And here I am saying support Joe Biggs, political prisoner.
[01:53:56.750 --> 01:54:00.150]  It takes money to fight these wars or you can just roll over and give up.
[01:54:00.150 --> 01:54:03.990]  Joe Biggs got back through from the DC jail.
[01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:07.090]  You've got now 13 minutes before they hang up on you again.
[01:54:07.090 --> 01:54:09.950]  So Joe, I'm just going to give you the floor because I was interrupting earlier because
[01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:10.950]  it's good to hear your voice.
[01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:13.750]  I have a lot of questions, but you've got the floor to talk about the trial, what's
[01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:16.990]  coming next, the state of the country, just what you're witnessing.
[01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:18.790]  Everybody wants to hear from Joe Biggs.
[01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:20.270]  Political prisoner, Joe Biggs.
[01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:26.470]  Yeah, the trial was a very interesting process to go through.
[01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:31.230]  We had, you're told that you're going to pick a jury of your peers.
[01:54:31.230 --> 01:54:32.230]  These aren't our peers.
[01:54:32.230 --> 01:54:35.710]  The people of DC hate everything that we stand for.
[01:54:35.710 --> 01:54:39.110]  Anyone who's conservative, anyone who's right leaning in any kind of way, you're an outcast,
[01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:40.110]  you're a hater.
[01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:41.830]  They think that you are the scum of the earth.
[01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:45.510]  So to say that you're going to get a fair trial in DC is the most hilarious thing in
[01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:47.030]  the world.
[01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:50.750]  These people convicted us day one.
[01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:51.750]  They said so.
[01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:53.430]  They said that we were guilty from the get-go.
[01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:55.870]  They didn't care what was shown to them.
[01:54:55.870 --> 01:55:01.290]  They didn't care that we showed how many times the FBI lied, how many times on video
[01:55:01.290 --> 01:55:07.990]  that we got the FBI, we could see them coercing and changing the words of their
[01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:14.030]  own witnesses to fit the narrative that they wanted, and still the jury goes, I don't care.
[01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:17.190]  Still the judge goes, I don't care.
[01:55:17.190 --> 01:55:22.710]  It was the most disheartening thing to go through because you watch, and we're sitting
[01:55:22.710 --> 01:55:23.710]  there.
[01:55:23.710 --> 01:55:26.590]  We're bringing forth the truth, but the truth isn't, the courtroom's not a place
[01:55:26.590 --> 01:55:27.590]  for the truth, obviously.
[01:55:27.590 --> 01:55:32.190]  I mean, this is a place for whatever they're allowed to put through, and the judge allowed
[01:55:32.190 --> 01:55:36.550]  the government to get away with everything and push whatever they wanted to through.
[01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:41.110]  It hurt to watch that.
[01:55:41.110 --> 01:55:44.070]  You go in there with your head held high.
[01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:48.710]  You go in there thinking that you know what, we're just going to keep fighting.
[01:55:48.710 --> 01:55:52.470]  We're going to keep going, and this machine is so big, they just don't care.
[01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:54.350]  That's why people need to wake up.
[01:55:54.350 --> 01:55:55.710]  People need to get off their butts.
[01:55:55.710 --> 01:55:59.990]  People need to understand that there's a war going on in the sense that they're
[01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:01.310]  coming after our rights.
[01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:04.790]  They are doing everything they can to throw us in jail.
[01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:06.750]  Oh, and war.
[01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:08.150]  Let's talk about the word war.
[01:56:08.150 --> 01:56:12.630]  Apparently, I say the word war too much, and I know you guys say that.
[01:56:12.630 --> 01:56:14.150]  It's a war for your mind.
[01:56:14.150 --> 01:56:16.030]  You got to watch out, Alex.
[01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:19.190]  The judge brought up the fact that I said war so many times, and they even brought
[01:56:19.190 --> 01:56:20.590]  it up to prosecution.
[01:56:20.590 --> 01:56:24.150]  The amount of times I've said war before, that's a no-no.
[01:56:24.150 --> 01:56:27.390]  You can't say that word anymore because then that means you're waging war against
[01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:30.630]  the government, and you're a terrorist.
[01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:36.190]  The things that came out in this trial, I don't understand it.
[01:56:36.190 --> 01:56:42.910]  You go in there with everything on your side, all that's right, all that's good, and
[01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:44.290]  they still don't care.
[01:56:44.290 --> 01:56:46.510]  The judge still sits there.
[01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:52.430]  The same video that they used, I remember when I first got locked up, they showed the
[01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:56.390]  judge, the government showed the judge of me shaking this fence or whatever.
[01:56:56.390 --> 01:57:00.610]  The judge, his first response was, I didn't see anything in there that shows Joe breaking
[01:57:00.610 --> 01:57:04.690]  the fence, so I'm not going to deny him bail.
[01:57:04.690 --> 01:57:10.330]  Then he comes back two days later and goes, that's terrorism, lock him up, and throws
[01:57:10.330 --> 01:57:11.590]  me in jail.
[01:57:11.590 --> 01:57:12.590]  It was so weird.
[01:57:12.590 --> 01:57:19.290]  His initial response- Because he clearly got his orders later.
[01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:20.290]  It was so weird.
[01:57:20.290 --> 01:57:22.930]  It was night and day because he sits there, he looks at him, he's telling the government,
[01:57:22.930 --> 01:57:23.930]  I don't see this.
[01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:24.930]  This doesn't make sense to me.
[01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:29.610]  That's the same video that they played over and over in trial, the same video that they
[01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:35.010]  used to get the terrorist enhancement, the same stupid video that he goes, I don't see
[01:57:35.010 --> 01:57:36.010]  it.
[01:57:36.010 --> 01:57:37.010]  It's not there.
[01:57:37.010 --> 01:57:38.010]  This doesn't really hold any water.
[01:57:38.010 --> 01:57:40.730]  By the way, we'll pull that video up, I didn't think to do that, but I've seen
[01:57:40.730 --> 01:57:41.730]  that video.
[01:57:41.730 --> 01:57:42.730]  It's just you at the fence.
[01:57:42.730 --> 01:57:48.810]  Then we have Ray Epps picking the sign up, helping ram it into people, that's fine.
[01:57:48.810 --> 01:57:49.810]  Bodies is back.
[01:57:49.810 --> 01:57:55.490]  The ultimate tumeric product on the market has returned to m4store.com and is now 25%
[01:57:55.490 --> 01:57:57.170]  off for a limited time.
[01:57:57.210 --> 01:58:02.530]  Utilized for thousands of years, tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[01:58:02.530 --> 01:58:06.890]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry
[01:58:06.890 --> 01:58:10.770]  and therapeutic potential of tumeric and its active components.
[01:58:10.770 --> 01:58:15.730]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility,
[01:58:15.730 --> 01:58:20.810]  increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much
[01:58:20.810 --> 01:58:21.810]  more.
[01:58:21.810 --> 01:58:26.850]  Regular tumeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[01:58:26.850 --> 01:58:32.530]  but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients
[01:58:32.530 --> 01:58:33.530]  in tumeric.
[01:58:33.530 --> 01:58:36.970]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.
[01:58:36.970 --> 01:58:40.770]  So if you want to put the true power of tumeric to the test, then look no further.
[01:58:40.770 --> 01:58:48.690]  Grab yourself a bottle today for 25% off at m4store.com and put your body at ease.
[01:58:48.690 --> 01:58:52.930]  Coffee has not been available at m4store.com for two years because the price went up
[01:58:52.930 --> 01:58:55.170]  too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[01:58:55.170 --> 01:59:00.090]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us, but when the folks
[01:59:00.090 --> 01:59:03.090]  at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was blown
[01:59:03.090 --> 01:59:08.010]  away, we finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer available
[01:59:08.010 --> 01:59:09.270]  to you right now.
[01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:13.850]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted, it smells amazing, and it's some of the strongest
[01:59:13.850 --> 01:59:15.250]  coffee I've ever drank.
[01:59:15.250 --> 01:59:21.330]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single-source Colombian coffees are now available at m4store.com
[01:59:21.330 --> 01:59:22.770]  exclusively.
[01:59:22.770 --> 01:59:27.930]  Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast, tastes great, it's the strong one, really strong,
[01:59:27.930 --> 01:59:30.050]  but these are all close second and thirds.
[01:59:30.050 --> 01:59:34.010]  Medium Roast, Wake of America, whoo, that's what my go-to.
[01:59:34.010 --> 01:59:38.170]  Dark Roast, Tip of the Spear, tastes the best and is amazing and is still very,
[01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:39.810]  very strong, gives you that pep.
[01:59:39.810 --> 01:59:44.690]  They're all three available at m4store.com and they fund our operation, and each order
[01:59:44.690 --> 01:59:46.690]  gets a Pocket Constitution Citizen rule book.
[01:59:51.690 --> 01:59:56.690]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:08.690 --> 02:00:15.730]  I saw so much crazy stuff happening that day, and we're the ones that have come
[02:00:15.730 --> 02:00:17.890]  out to be the worst of the worst, they said.
[02:00:17.890 --> 02:00:22.290]  They said that our actions were the ones that are, our actions were responsible for
[02:00:22.290 --> 02:00:23.290]  the test test.
[02:00:23.290 --> 02:00:25.130]  Well, they said you led it, they said you did it.
[02:00:25.130 --> 02:00:31.210]  Yeah, they said that my military experience is what gave me the ability to lead an army
[02:00:31.210 --> 02:00:32.210]  against the government.
[02:00:32.210 --> 02:00:35.290]  But is there video you're saying we go into the Capitol, or video you're saying
[02:00:35.290 --> 02:00:37.890]  you, or text message you're saying you orchestrated it?
[02:00:37.890 --> 02:00:39.290]  No, that's Ray Epps.
[02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:41.930]  Yeah, there's none of that whatsoever.
[02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:45.290]  They have a video of me going, oh my god, I can't believe everybody just stormed
[02:00:45.290 --> 02:00:46.290]  the Capitol.
[02:00:46.690 --> 02:00:51.570]  There's even a video of me where I'm walking, and I'm filming it, and I'm going, oh my god,
[02:00:51.570 --> 02:00:54.690]  we've just walked over the barriers, we've just walked over the barriers, not we've
[02:00:54.690 --> 02:00:57.290]  just taken them down, or we've just busted them.
[02:00:57.290 --> 02:00:59.790]  We've just walked over them because someone else had knocked them down.
[02:00:59.790 --> 02:01:03.090]  We've just walked over the barriers, oh my god, I can't believe this, people are storming
[02:01:03.090 --> 02:01:04.090]  the Capitol.
[02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:08.490]  And there's a lady with a little chihuahua going past me faster than I'm going, and
[02:01:08.490 --> 02:01:11.490]  a guy in a wheelchair passes me, but they said that I ran up and led the charge,
[02:01:11.490 --> 02:01:15.290]  and I have people literally passing me as I'm walking and going, oh my god, I can't
[02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:16.290]  believe this is happening.
[02:01:16.290 --> 02:01:20.290]  I'm saying, oh my god, I can't believe this is happening, and that's my initial
[02:01:20.290 --> 02:01:21.290]  response.
[02:01:21.290 --> 02:01:22.290]  What does that tell you?
[02:01:22.290 --> 02:01:23.290]  There's not a plan.
[02:01:23.290 --> 02:01:25.290]  I'm literally shocked by what's happening.
[02:01:25.290 --> 02:01:28.290]  And they go, well no, no, no, no, he knew this was happening.
[02:01:28.290 --> 02:01:33.290]  There was a meeting of the mind that happened somehow between them, and they all agreed
[02:01:33.290 --> 02:01:36.290]  that this was going to happen, even though there's no proof that there was ever
[02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:39.290]  on paper that it was dead, that there was no recording, and not one person's
[02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:43.290]  ever come forward, and not one FBI employee has ever come forward and said that
[02:01:43.290 --> 02:01:46.290]  there was a plan, that there was proof of a plan, or anything like that.
[02:01:46.290 --> 02:01:51.290]  No, no, no, we just somehow had this meeting of the mind that never happened,
[02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:54.290]  but that's what caused this conspiracy, and that's why we're now
[02:01:54.290 --> 02:01:56.290]  seditious terrorists somehow.
[02:01:56.290 --> 02:02:00.290]  You know, if that can happen, what else can happen in court?
[02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:02.290]  What else can they get away with?
[02:02:02.290 --> 02:02:05.290]  And again, for some reason, we can't find the footage of you just touching the fence.
[02:02:05.290 --> 02:02:08.290]  We have Ray Epps there ramming it over the police.
[02:02:08.290 --> 02:02:10.290]  What's the name of that video, Joe, so we can find it?
[02:02:10.290 --> 02:02:11.290]  We'll add it in post.
[02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:13.290]  We're live right now, but that's something we really want to air.
[02:02:13.290 --> 02:02:17.290]  I know they hide all the exculpatory footage, but this is Ray Epps.
[02:02:17.290 --> 02:02:20.290]  There he is, ramming it over the police, and saying he orchestrated it,
[02:02:20.290 --> 02:02:22.290]  and saying go into the Capitol, but that's okay.
[02:02:22.290 --> 02:02:27.290]  Well, the very first, the very first, the very first, the very, very first
[02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:30.290]  January 6th committee hearing was on Donald Trump and me.
[02:02:30.290 --> 02:02:33.290]  The very first one, if you remember, the very first one.
[02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:36.290]  They talked about Donald Trump for the first half, and then Joe Biggs,
[02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:40.290]  and the female cop that gets knocked over by Ryan Samsel
[02:02:40.290 --> 02:02:43.290]  goes, Joe Biggs was in the crowd, and he had his bullhorn.
[02:02:43.290 --> 02:02:46.290]  He looked at me and said, I don't like cops, and cops are trash,
[02:02:46.290 --> 02:02:50.290]  and everybody come and, you know, take out the cops or some crap like that.
[02:02:50.290 --> 02:02:54.290]  And I'm like, I'm sitting here watching this from jail going, are you serious?
[02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:55.290]  That never happened.
[02:02:55.290 --> 02:03:01.290]  And there's literally footage of another man with a bullhorn telling people to charge the fence
[02:03:01.290 --> 02:03:05.290]  that he needs men at the front for the women to get out of the way to push that fence over.
[02:03:05.290 --> 02:03:09.290]  And then she says that I lean into Ryan Samsel's ear,
[02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:12.290]  and that he's the one who comes and takes out the fence.
[02:03:12.290 --> 02:03:14.290]  No, that's not me, that's Ray Epps.
[02:03:14.290 --> 02:03:16.290]  It's incredible, it's incredible.
[02:03:16.290 --> 02:03:18.290]  So we're showing the footage where you're standing at the fence doing nothing.
[02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:21.290]  This is your terrace now because of the footage we're showing right now,
[02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:23.290]  you standing against the fence.
[02:03:23.290 --> 02:03:27.290]  So, how are the other guys doing, or do you see them, or what's happening?
[02:03:27.290 --> 02:03:32.290]  Yeah, yeah, they're all sitting around, you know, Enrique's reading the paper in front of me right now,
[02:03:32.290 --> 02:03:36.290]  but he can't talk because his trial, I mean, he's been in things not until Tuesday,
[02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:40.290]  but he would like to come on if you guys want to have Enrique Carrillo next week.
[02:03:40.290 --> 02:03:42.290]  He said he'd be interested in coming on.
[02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:46.290]  No, we want them all, because I've been waiting to get you on,
[02:03:46.290 --> 02:03:48.290]  but obviously we didn't want to stir the court up.
[02:03:48.290 --> 02:03:50.290]  So when can Enrique come on?
[02:03:50.290 --> 02:03:54.290]  Enrique, Enrique, when do you want to come on with Alex?
[02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:56.290]  Next week? Afterward?
[02:03:56.290 --> 02:03:58.290]  You want to come on with Alex next week? Okay.
[02:03:58.290 --> 02:04:01.290]  Like Wednesday? Okay, Wednesday, he said he can do it.
[02:04:01.290 --> 02:04:03.290]  We're literally talking to American political prisoners.
[02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:05.290]  We've got four minutes left where they cut you off.
[02:04:05.290 --> 02:04:08.290]  Anything else you want to add right now, Joe Biggs?
[02:04:08.290 --> 02:04:13.290]  Yeah, so, you know, it was amazing, you know.
[02:04:13.290 --> 02:04:17.290]  I walk out of the courtroom, you know, I'm sitting there, I'm going through my mind,
[02:04:17.290 --> 02:04:20.290]  after the sentencing, I'm like, you know, it's hard to take it in.
[02:04:20.290 --> 02:04:23.290]  You know, 17 years, that's a big number, you know,
[02:04:23.290 --> 02:04:25.290]  and your life kind of flashes before your eyes.
[02:04:25.290 --> 02:04:29.290]  You start to wonder, like, you know, wow, like, is this it? Is this really it?
[02:04:29.290 --> 02:04:32.290]  But then you have to pull yourself back up and you have to go, no, this isn't it.
[02:04:32.290 --> 02:04:33.290]  This is only the beginning.
[02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:37.290]  This is where God starts to do his miracles because when you're left with nothing
[02:04:37.290 --> 02:04:39.290]  and you're sitting there and your hands are tied behind your back
[02:04:39.290 --> 02:04:42.290]  and you're in jail and you're in solitary confinement,
[02:04:42.290 --> 02:04:45.290]  that's when God really comes through and works miracles.
[02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:47.290]  And I believe we're going to see miracles happen
[02:04:47.290 --> 02:04:49.290]  and I believe God's going to have something good come out of this
[02:04:49.290 --> 02:04:52.290]  because there's just been so much bad going on.
[02:04:52.290 --> 02:04:54.290]  We're seeing this country in such a decline
[02:04:54.290 --> 02:04:58.290]  and I guarantee you, soon, we're going to start seeing some miracles happening.
[02:04:59.290 --> 02:05:00.290]  It's just a mask.
[02:05:00.290 --> 02:05:02.290]  It's just six feet.
[02:05:02.290 --> 02:05:04.290]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[02:05:04.290 --> 02:05:07.290]  It's just non-essential workers.
[02:05:07.290 --> 02:05:09.290]  It's just until we work it out.
[02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:11.290]  It's just a bar.
[02:05:11.290 --> 02:05:13.290]  It's just a restaurant.
[02:05:13.290 --> 02:05:15.290]  It's just nursing homes.
[02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:17.290]  It's just schools.
[02:05:17.290 --> 02:05:20.290]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[02:05:20.290 --> 02:05:23.290]  It's just until the cases go down.
[02:05:23.290 --> 02:05:25.290]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[02:05:25.290 --> 02:05:28.290]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[02:05:28.290 --> 02:05:30.290]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[02:05:30.290 --> 02:05:35.290]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[02:05:35.290 --> 02:05:37.290]  It's just churches and mosques.
[02:05:37.290 --> 02:05:39.290]  It's just singing.
[02:05:39.290 --> 02:05:42.290]  It's just travel.
[02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:44.290]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[02:05:44.290 --> 02:05:46.290]  It's just for the greater good.
[02:05:46.290 --> 02:05:50.290]  It's just fact-checking, not censorship.
[02:05:50.290 --> 02:05:52.290]  It's just mandatory.
[02:05:52.290 --> 02:05:54.290]  It isn't just at all.
[02:05:54.290 --> 02:05:58.290]  Visit DefendJones.com to help fight back today.
[02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:20.290]  You know, it was heartfelt.
[02:06:20.290 --> 02:06:23.290]  I walked through the door of the end of the prison,
[02:06:23.290 --> 02:06:25.290]  and everybody ran up to me and gave me a hug,
[02:06:25.290 --> 02:06:27.290]  and everybody sat there in line,
[02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:29.290]  and they came up and shook my hand,
[02:06:29.290 --> 02:06:31.290]  and you could see the hurt in their eyes to hear that,
[02:06:31.290 --> 02:06:33.290]  you know, I just got 17 years, you know.
[02:06:33.290 --> 02:06:35.290]  And it was an emotional thing, you know,
[02:06:35.290 --> 02:06:37.290]  to have all these men that have been here with you
[02:06:37.290 --> 02:06:39.290]  that have gone through the same thing,
[02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:40.290]  and you see them just go,
[02:06:40.290 --> 02:06:42.290]  oh, my God, I can't believe this happened to you.
[02:06:42.290 --> 02:06:43.290]  Like, you didn't do anything.
[02:06:43.290 --> 02:06:45.290]  Everybody here knows that we didn't do anything.
[02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:47.290]  These other people will even say, look, I did this.
[02:06:47.290 --> 02:06:48.290]  I screwed up.
[02:06:48.290 --> 02:06:49.290]  I did something bad.
[02:06:49.290 --> 02:06:50.290]  I was violent.
[02:06:50.290 --> 02:06:51.290]  I did that.
[02:06:52.290 --> 02:06:54.290]  We didn't do a single thing worthy of this,
[02:06:54.290 --> 02:06:56.290]  and yet we're the ones being hated on the most
[02:06:56.290 --> 02:06:57.290]  because we're the only ones
[02:06:57.290 --> 02:06:59.290]  that were willing to stand up to Antifa.
[02:06:59.290 --> 02:07:00.290]  We were the only ones who were willing
[02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:02.290]  to go out there and speak our minds
[02:07:02.290 --> 02:07:04.290]  and say what the government was doing wrong,
[02:07:04.290 --> 02:07:06.290]  and they came after us, and they want to shut us up,
[02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:08.290]  and they want to scare the American public
[02:07:08.290 --> 02:07:09.290]  by what they're doing to us,
[02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:11.290]  and what they're doing to us should piss you off.
[02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:12.290]  It shouldn't scare you.
[02:07:12.290 --> 02:07:14.290]  It should get you to want to go out
[02:07:14.290 --> 02:07:16.290]  and stand up for your wife more,
[02:07:16.290 --> 02:07:18.290]  to not sit there when it comes time to go vote
[02:07:18.290 --> 02:07:20.290]  and go, well, I think I just won't vote this time.
[02:07:20.290 --> 02:07:22.290]  I think there's enough people who are going to go vote
[02:07:22.290 --> 02:07:23.290]  for Donald Trump this time.
[02:07:23.290 --> 02:07:25.290]  No, you've got to get off your butt and go do it
[02:07:25.290 --> 02:07:27.290]  because if not, I'm staying in jail forever.
[02:07:27.290 --> 02:07:30.290]  Our lives depend on people getting off their butts
[02:07:30.290 --> 02:07:32.290]  and going out and doing the right thing
[02:07:32.290 --> 02:07:33.290]  and putting good people in office
[02:07:33.290 --> 02:07:35.290]  that will help bring sanity back to this country.
[02:07:35.290 --> 02:07:36.290]  My life depends on it.
[02:07:36.290 --> 02:07:39.290]  My daughter's future depends on the American people
[02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:42.290]  to stop sitting around and stop being lazy,
[02:07:42.290 --> 02:07:44.290]  to pull your heads out of your butts
[02:07:44.290 --> 02:07:47.290]  and go to the ballot boxes and do the right thing.
[02:07:47.290 --> 02:07:48.290]  Please.
[02:07:48.290 --> 02:07:49.290]  Well, it sounds like you're buoyed
[02:07:49.290 --> 02:07:51.290]  by the fact that people know that you're innocent
[02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:52.290]  and that this is all a lie.
[02:07:52.290 --> 02:07:53.290]  Yeah.
[02:07:53.290 --> 02:07:55.290]  I mean, it doesn't matter where we go.
[02:07:55.290 --> 02:07:57.290]  People come up to us and go, this is a travesty.
[02:07:57.290 --> 02:07:58.290]  You shouldn't be here.
[02:07:58.290 --> 02:08:00.290]  I mean, I have hardcore criminals.
[02:08:00.290 --> 02:08:02.290]  On the bus ride back from the courthouse
[02:08:02.290 --> 02:08:05.290]  back here to the jail, there's a guy sitting beside me.
[02:08:05.290 --> 02:08:10.290]  He just got picked up for selling 13 illegal firearms in D.C.
[02:08:10.290 --> 02:08:13.290]  That should be five years for each weapon.
[02:08:13.290 --> 02:08:14.290]  He got a two-year deal.
[02:08:14.290 --> 02:08:15.290]  He got a two-year plea deal.
[02:08:15.290 --> 02:08:16.290]  He's laughing at me.
[02:08:16.290 --> 02:08:17.290]  He goes, oh, my God.
[02:08:17.290 --> 02:08:20.290]  Another guy goes, man, I just got so-and-so many years for murder.
[02:08:20.290 --> 02:08:23.290]  He goes, you could have killed someone and gotten out quicker than me,
[02:08:23.290 --> 02:08:25.290]  because they put you in a bus with a bunch of prisoners.
[02:08:25.290 --> 02:08:26.290]  They bring you back to the jail,
[02:08:26.290 --> 02:08:28.290]  and it's different people from different walks of life
[02:08:28.290 --> 02:08:30.290]  that are there for different crimes.
[02:08:30.290 --> 02:08:31.290]  And everyone's like, oh, my God,
[02:08:31.290 --> 02:08:34.290]  I can't believe that a guy who walked around
[02:08:34.290 --> 02:08:37.290]  who has no criminal record is now considered a terrorist.
[02:08:37.290 --> 02:08:40.290]  Oh, people are pointing out that rapists that beat women up
[02:08:40.290 --> 02:08:44.290]  and torture them get two years, and you get 17 years.
[02:08:44.290 --> 02:08:45.290]  Yeah.
[02:08:45.290 --> 02:08:48.290]  I mean, it's crazy when you see, like, hardened gangbangers,
[02:08:48.290 --> 02:08:51.290]  guys who've been, you know, their whole lives, you know,
[02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:54.290]  doing stuff like this, you know, going out, shooting at people,
[02:08:54.290 --> 02:08:56.290]  beating people up, beating them half to death,
[02:08:56.290 --> 02:08:59.290]  and they look at you and go, man, you don't deserve to be here.
[02:08:59.290 --> 02:09:00.290]  You're not like me.
[02:09:00.290 --> 02:09:02.290]  Like, I deserve to be in jail, they'll say.
[02:09:02.290 --> 02:09:03.290]  They go, but you don't.
[02:09:03.290 --> 02:09:05.290]  You should be at home right now with your daughter.
[02:09:05.290 --> 02:09:07.290]  You deserve to be out there on the streets.
[02:09:07.290 --> 02:09:09.290]  Not us, but you do.
[02:09:09.290 --> 02:09:16.290]  And I guarantee you, myself, Ethan, Nourdine, Zachary Real, Dominic Lozola,
[02:09:16.290 --> 02:09:19.290]  or Enrique Tarrio will have similar stories from their experiences
[02:09:19.290 --> 02:09:22.290]  over the last three years at the jail they've been to.
[02:09:22.290 --> 02:09:23.290]  No one thinks that we should be here.
[02:09:23.290 --> 02:09:27.290]  No one believes that this is actually happening, but it is.
[02:09:27.290 --> 02:09:31.290]  And people need to understand that it's time to do something.
[02:09:31.290 --> 02:09:34.290]  Everything that's happening to Trump, it's happened to me already.
[02:09:34.290 --> 02:09:36.290]  Now it's happening to him.
[02:09:36.290 --> 02:09:37.290]  And then guess what?
[02:09:37.290 --> 02:09:38.290]  It's going to happen to you.
[02:09:38.290 --> 02:09:45.290]  Do you have hope that if Trump gets elected, despite all the challenges, he'll pardon you?
[02:09:45.290 --> 02:09:46.290]  Oh, I know he'll pardon us.
[02:09:46.290 --> 02:09:48.290]  I believe that with all my heart.
[02:09:48.290 --> 02:09:51.290]  You know, the thing is, is hopefully getting him, you know,
[02:09:51.290 --> 02:09:57.290]  for him to be able to get into the position where he can at least be, I think, on the ballot to run, right?
[02:09:57.290 --> 02:10:00.290]  You have one minute remaining.
[02:10:00.290 --> 02:10:01.290]  Election interference, right?
[02:10:01.290 --> 02:10:06.290]  It's election interference if they start trying to go after him once he's on there.
[02:10:06.290 --> 02:10:12.290]  I have to understand the legalities of that, but I do believe that Donald J. Trump will pardon us.
[02:10:12.290 --> 02:10:13.290]  And he should.
[02:10:13.290 --> 02:10:14.290]  We didn't do anything.
[02:10:14.290 --> 02:10:16.290]  You know, we're his supporters.
[02:10:16.290 --> 02:10:20.290]  We went there like he asked, and things went wrong that day, and that's sad.
[02:10:20.290 --> 02:10:23.290]  Well, there's no doubt that they set us all up.
[02:10:23.290 --> 02:10:25.290]  We were all patsies that day, Joe.
[02:10:25.290 --> 02:10:28.290]  You've got to come back on any time you want on the broadcast,
[02:10:28.290 --> 02:10:30.290]  any time you can get on.
[02:10:30.290 --> 02:10:33.290]  11 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays, Sundays, or we can always tape.
[02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:34.290]  We love you.
[02:10:34.290 --> 02:10:38.290]  People should go to freejoebiggs.com and donate to support your appeal.
[02:10:38.290 --> 02:10:39.290]  They want to grind us down.
[02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:40.290]  They want to break our will.
[02:10:40.290 --> 02:10:42.290]  Give me a 1776, brother.
[02:10:42.290 --> 02:10:45.290]  1776, brother.
[02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:47.290]  All right, Joe.
[02:10:47.290 --> 02:10:48.290]  Hey, man, I love you guys.
[02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:50.290]  Thanks for, look, look, I said they're not going to hold me down.
[02:10:50.290 --> 02:10:52.290]  I'm going to keep my head held high.
[02:10:52.290 --> 02:10:53.290]  I'm a warrior.
[02:10:53.290 --> 02:10:54.290]  I don't give up.
[02:10:54.290 --> 02:10:55.290]  This fight's not over.
[02:10:55.290 --> 02:10:58.290]  It's only just begun, and I'm telling you right now.
[02:10:58.290 --> 02:11:01.290]  Thank you for using Global Tell Link.
[02:11:01.290 --> 02:11:07.290]  So from a globalist gulag, Joe Biggs cut off.
[02:11:07.290 --> 02:11:09.290]  That's America.
[02:11:09.290 --> 02:11:12.290]  And if you don't think they're coming for your energy and your children
[02:11:12.290 --> 02:11:15.290]  and everything, I mean, it's full-on takeover.
[02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:17.290]  It's here.
[02:11:17.290 --> 02:11:22.290]  And, again, I was not having these guys on because their lawyers didn't want to get into more trouble.
[02:11:22.290 --> 02:11:23.290]  They'd be like, where's Joe?
[02:11:23.290 --> 02:11:24.290]  They're not supporting people.
[02:11:24.290 --> 02:11:26.290]  Well, you didn't know the inside baseball.
[02:11:26.290 --> 02:11:27.290]  Now you do.
[02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:30.290]  So you can all feel morally superior and do the things you do.
[02:11:30.290 --> 02:11:31.290]  I'm not talking to our general audience.
[02:11:31.290 --> 02:11:34.290]  I just get so sick of it.
[02:11:34.290 --> 02:11:38.290]  But now that the guys are ready to come on, we'll have them all on.
[02:11:38.290 --> 02:11:40.290]  And I think they're probably right.
[02:11:40.290 --> 02:11:47.290]  I think the judges would have given them, you know, 40 years, 45 years that the evil globalists,
[02:11:47.290 --> 02:11:50.290]  they're not feds, they're people that have hijacked our government,
[02:11:50.290 --> 02:11:53.290]  were asking for if they would have done interviews.
[02:11:53.290 --> 02:11:58.290]  So this is quite a moment to be alive.
[02:11:58.290 --> 02:12:06.290]  We've got to roll our sleeves up and admit the predicament we're in
[02:12:06.290 --> 02:12:09.290]  and do something about it because it's not going to get any better bowing down.
[02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:15.290]  Putting on the knee pads like Kamala Harris isn't going to get us out of this.
[02:12:15.290 --> 02:12:17.290]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[02:12:17.290 --> 02:12:20.290]  I want to take the ADL to the woodshed
[02:12:20.290 --> 02:12:23.290]  because it's been the top trending thing for a few days and people really get it now
[02:12:23.290 --> 02:12:28.290]  They've got a big stack here that ties into the UN, their whole operation.
[02:12:28.290 --> 02:12:32.290]  And I've got all this other news, too, so I'm really loaded for bear.
[02:12:32.290 --> 02:12:38.290]  I'm going to come back tomorrow, 4 to 6 p.m., MTG's in the studio in the second hour.
[02:12:38.290 --> 02:12:42.290]  With the first hour, I'm going to do the ADL deep dive and some other things.
[02:12:42.290 --> 02:12:44.290]  But I've got a few things I'm going to hit right now.
[02:12:44.290 --> 02:12:47.290]  That's why I'm moving the ADL thing again to tomorrow.
[02:12:47.290 --> 02:12:50.290]  And I'm going to hit it Monday and Tuesday because it is a...
[02:12:50.290 --> 02:12:53.290]  I also now...
[02:12:53.290 --> 02:12:57.290]  I already knew the inside baseball in Elon Musk, whether he's good or not.
[02:12:57.290 --> 02:13:01.290]  And he wasn't good before. He wasn't totally bad.
[02:13:01.290 --> 02:13:04.290]  But he's been a globalist darling.
[02:13:04.290 --> 02:13:10.290]  But he got power. He got to be the richest man in the world.
[02:13:10.290 --> 02:13:14.290]  And they took his son and are getting ready to chop his pee-pee off.
[02:13:14.290 --> 02:13:19.290]  That'll wake anybody up, his firstborn son.
[02:13:19.290 --> 02:13:22.290]  They want that firstborn, don't they?
[02:13:22.290 --> 02:13:31.290]  And another one of his children got killed, it looks like, by a vaccine with sudden infant death syndrome.
[02:13:31.290 --> 02:13:38.290]  And again, Musk lives here in Austin. I'm not going to get into any stuff here or what my sources are.
[02:13:38.290 --> 02:13:42.290]  But we have to be ready for Musk to come over to our side.
[02:13:42.290 --> 02:13:45.290]  And Vivek Ramaswami, sure, he was a leftist before.
[02:13:45.290 --> 02:13:50.290]  He's joining us. The things he's saying are devastating them.
[02:13:50.290 --> 02:13:52.290]  And they're coming after him on every front.
[02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:55.290]  So I really want to caution everybody to not be Pharisees.
[02:13:55.290 --> 02:13:58.290]  Because you know what happened in Christ's day?
[02:13:58.290 --> 02:14:03.290]  There were these members of the Sanhedrin and the rabbis that said they were holier than thou.
[02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:06.290]  Not all of them, but some of them.
[02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:11.290]  And they were always talking about how they were perfect and they were good and everybody else was bad.
[02:14:11.290 --> 02:14:16.290]  But Christ was talking to the tax collectors and the prostitutes and the people who actually wanted to be reformed.
[02:14:16.290 --> 02:14:18.290]  Like when he was dying on the cross or about to die.
[02:14:18.290 --> 02:14:22.290]  And he got the thief and the murderer and one of them believes in God and the other doesn't.
[02:14:22.290 --> 02:14:24.290]  So he says, you'll be with me today in paradise.
[02:14:26.290 --> 02:14:33.290]  So it doesn't mean I turn my back and don't watch Ramaswami or Musk.
[02:14:33.290 --> 02:14:39.290]  But, I mean, look, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know, pun intended,
[02:14:39.290 --> 02:14:42.290]  that when you're, I mean, Musk came out today.
[02:14:42.290 --> 02:14:45.290]  In fact, I didn't see the article. I thought I sent it to you guys.
[02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:49.290]  It's an InfoWars.com article. It's a Zero Hedge article.
[02:14:49.290 --> 02:14:54.290]  He responded and tweeted today. In fact, print it for me because I didn't see it.
[02:14:54.290 --> 02:14:56.290]  You may have given it to me, but I missed it.
[02:14:56.290 --> 02:15:02.290]  And he said, yeah, the head of my marketing has been meeting with him.
[02:15:02.290 --> 02:15:05.290]  Just like you meet in a mafia war with the other side that meetings with him.
[02:15:05.290 --> 02:15:08.290]  He said the ADL has done everything they can.
[02:15:08.290 --> 02:15:11.290]  Quote, ADL has tried very hard to strangle ex-Twitter.
[02:15:11.290 --> 02:15:15.290]  Elon Musk responds to hashtag ban the ADL.
[02:15:15.290 --> 02:15:18.290]  And he says, just because I'm meeting with the extortionist,
[02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:23.290]  you know, Don Corleone met with the guys that shot him and the godfather.
[02:15:23.290 --> 02:15:26.290]  It's all based on true story, different names.
[02:15:26.290 --> 02:15:28.290]  Doesn't mean Musk is with him.
[02:15:28.290 --> 02:15:33.290]  No, they're getting ready to chop his firstborn son's penis off.
[02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:36.290]  And if that doesn't wake your ass up, nothing will.
[02:15:36.290 --> 02:15:39.290]  Another one of his children, the evidence of one was killed by a vaccine.
[02:15:39.290 --> 02:15:41.290]  His brother almost died for one.
[02:15:41.290 --> 02:15:43.290]  And he's like, you know what? I'm not.
[02:15:43.290 --> 02:15:47.290]  Yeah, there's his son captured by the enemy.
[02:15:47.290 --> 02:15:49.290]  I don't care how rich and powerful you are.
[02:15:49.290 --> 02:15:54.290]  If you're not pure evil, having your son getting ready to have his balls cut off
[02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:57.290]  will get your attention real quick.
[02:15:57.290 --> 02:16:02.290]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength,
[02:16:02.290 --> 02:16:05.290]  and they can only be obtained through diet.
[02:16:05.290 --> 02:16:11.290]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[02:16:11.290 --> 02:16:17.290]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[02:16:17.290 --> 02:16:22.290]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[02:16:22.290 --> 02:16:29.290]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:37.290]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems,
[02:16:37.290 --> 02:16:39.290]  our brain and our heart.
[02:16:39.290 --> 02:16:44.290]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.
[02:16:44.290 --> 02:16:49.290]  Get your essential omega-3 fatty acids from the best sources available,
[02:16:49.290 --> 02:16:52.290]  ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil.

[02:17:01.290 --> 02:17:06.290]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at infowarsstore.com.
[02:17:06.290 --> 02:17:10.290]  They are both clones of national best-selling products
[02:17:10.290 --> 02:17:14.290]  from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker that are listeners and patriots
[02:17:14.290 --> 02:17:19.290]  that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price than you'll find in stores.
[02:17:19.290 --> 02:17:23.290]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[02:17:23.290 --> 02:17:28.290]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain
[02:17:28.290 --> 02:17:31.290]  and to also make your nerves healthier,
[02:17:31.290 --> 02:17:36.290]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[02:17:36.290 --> 02:17:38.290]  There's major research behind this all.
[02:17:38.290 --> 02:17:44.290]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD
[02:17:44.290 --> 02:17:48.290]  exclusively at infowarsstore.com right now.

[02:17:50.290 --> 02:17:55.290]  You'll find them exclusively at infowarsstore.com, and they fund our operation.
[02:17:57.290 --> 02:18:02.290]  We finally have our original best-selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[02:18:02.290 --> 02:18:06.290]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems in the economy,
[02:18:06.290 --> 02:18:12.290]  we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:16.290]  But now we've got it 30 parts per million from the top lab.
[02:18:16.290 --> 02:18:17.290]  We've got a limited shipment.
[02:18:17.290 --> 02:18:19.290]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[02:18:19.290 --> 02:18:22.290]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet,

[02:19:56.860 --> 02:20:03.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:41.180]  Prison's bad, but having your son's balls cut off is bad. It's worse. So, that's where
[02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:55.860]  this is. And, no, I actually know people that know us very closely and it's too big a subject
[02:20:55.860 --> 02:21:03.780]  to talk about at this point, but their words are is, Musk is crazy because he's part of
[02:21:03.780 --> 02:21:09.420]  the people on our team completely. These are very prominent people. Musk is completely
[02:21:09.420 --> 02:21:14.620]  pissed and out of his mind at the New World Order because they're getting ready to chop
[02:21:14.620 --> 02:21:21.660]  his son's balls off. That might piss you off, like RFK Jr. blew his father way right
[02:21:21.660 --> 02:21:32.140]  in front of him, killed his uncle on national television. RFK Jr.'s for real? I don't know,
[02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:37.820]  somebody murders your daddy? Do you like him? Yeah, come on. This thing's a lot more important
[02:21:37.820 --> 02:21:44.580]  than money and power, like vengeance and vendettas. So, I mean, the stuff they've
[02:21:44.580 --> 02:21:50.340]  done to me makes me, I'll never give up and they haven't killed my family. They
[02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:56.820]  might have tried. So, no, there's not just evil in the world, folks. There's not just Larry Fink
[02:21:56.820 --> 02:22:05.460]  and the Rockefellers and Obama, that joke. They have the money and the power and the media,
[02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:11.540]  but they don't have much else. They don't have your soul. They don't have your mind.
[02:22:11.540 --> 02:22:22.100]  They don't have your will. No, Tucker Carlson's now awake. Joe Rogan's now awake. Couldn't talk
[02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:27.980]  for hours about all the people, the James Woods of the worlds and the Tulsi Gabbards
[02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:37.100]  and the Russell Brand. Pretty much anybody popular is on our side because humans have a
[02:22:37.100 --> 02:22:43.300]  way about us when we finally get down and we know we're about to go down. We just say,
[02:22:43.300 --> 02:22:50.380]  you know what? How about we just have a fight? Because I've said this a lot. I'll say it again.
[02:22:50.380 --> 02:22:58.360]  I don't know how all this is going to end. We did start this fight and you knew world
[02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:03.980]  order people aren't backing down. So, I guess if you want to fight, you better believe you got
[02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:14.380]  one. That's what you're looking for. You came to the right place. The truth is God
[02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:21.340]  has a sixth sense of humor and I get God. I don't judge God. So many people look at
[02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:25.220]  God giving us free will and they see all the bad things that happen and they see all
[02:23:25.220 --> 02:23:30.420]  the persecution of pain. They say, God's a sadist. No, if anything, God's lonely.
[02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:36.820]  God made billions of creatures with free will and an understanding of the universe and the
[02:23:36.820 --> 02:23:43.540]  ability to interface with infinity. And I'm just thankful for the power I've been given and the
[02:23:43.540 --> 02:23:47.740]  will I've been given and the freedom I've been given to make that choice. And I just say to the
[02:23:47.740 --> 02:24:04.180]  Creator, beam me up. Master, you are so perfect. You are so good. I understand you. At least I
[02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:11.420]  think I do. I don't plan to understand God, but you know, I understand God. I got God fear and
[02:24:11.420 --> 02:24:17.180]  I just appreciate this. I'm going to put on this gorgeous planet and all this wonderful universe
[02:24:17.580 --> 02:24:24.220]  and I can experience beauty and culture and everything and just be alive and have my family.
[02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:33.340]  This is amazing. Wow. Wow. What a ride. What an amusement park. What an incredible thing.
[02:24:33.340 --> 02:24:36.060]  And then, yeah, I go do bad stuff and it's your fault?
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:43.500]  Somebody else does something? So it's your fault for making us know you gave us free will.
[02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:50.060]  Little G, not a God, little God. And some Christians don't like that. Fake Christians
[02:24:50.060 --> 02:24:53.020]  are like, that's blasphemy to say we're God. I didn't say I was God.
[02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:58.940]  Genesis says we were made in the image of God.
[02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:11.420]  Figure that out yet. Yeah. So I do appreciate being made in the image of the Creator
[02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:15.740]  and I'm not prideful about it. I'm very humble about it, but I'm like,
[02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:20.780]  I don't know whatever you're going to tell me. Yeah. Just please take me with you.
[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:27.580]  Oh, I get it. Oh, please. Let me do what? Oh, you don't like cowards?
[02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:31.100]  Well, you just tell me whatever I got to do to prove I'm not one of those.
[02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:38.380]  Yes, sir. You tell me jump. I say how high I'm going to click my heels eight times.
[02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:42.860]  I'm going to do it. You want me to get fed into a wood chipper? You want me to spend a trillion
[02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:49.420]  years in a hell hole? I'll do it because I've already had a little taste of the next level.
[02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:57.500]  Total completion, total victory, total understanding, mastery of everything. It's God.
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:01.500]  And I'm addicted.
[02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:10.780]  But nothing worth anything is free. Nothing that has value is easily gained.
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:13.420]  And that's what this is all about.
[02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:20.060]  So I want to play a disgusting clip, but first I want to take a piss.
[02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:24.940]  It's an error promo. And I'm going to come back with one of the most
[02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:29.180]  disgusting people I've ever met. And that's Sean Penn.
[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:36.780]  I mean, you talk about a arrogant, husk of a creature, a demon who wants World War Three.
[02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:45.980]  Who now just said the quiet part aloud.
[02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:52.220]  He says the lockdowns are a mandatory rehearsal for things to come.
[02:26:52.220 --> 02:27:00.460]  This sick creature wants to lock you up because it makes him feel powerful.
[02:27:00.460 --> 02:27:03.980]  Where have we heard of that before?
[02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:09.420]  And I'm going to tell you why, Sean Penn, you're so obsessed with locking us up
[02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:12.540]  because you're about to get your ass locked up culturally, spiritually.
[02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:16.220]  You're not going to get locked up in some cell.
[02:27:16.220 --> 02:27:22.140]  You're about to get locked up with people like you, dimensionally.
[02:27:23.420 --> 02:27:25.420]  You're about to be cut off from the source.
[02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:32.300]  So that's why he spends all his time trying to claw us into his hell with him.
[02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:38.620]  Because the man is a retarded joke.
[02:27:40.780 --> 02:27:43.420]  I don't mean that meaning it's down syndrome syndrome.
[02:27:43.420 --> 02:27:52.060]  I've had dinner with Sean Penn. The man, 16 years, 17, whenever it was, is a moron.
[02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:01.100]  But aren't the servants of the devil morons?
[02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:10.380]  He literally wants to starve you to death and make you eat bugs because it makes this
[02:28:10.380 --> 02:28:13.580]  goofus feel powerful.
[02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:23.180]  He's a retarded drug addict.
[02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:30.940]  But what does it say about us when we let retarded,
[02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:34.140]  pedophile drug addicts like Joe Biden run our lives?
[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:36.300]  God doesn't like that.
[02:28:37.180 --> 02:28:42.060]  So you know who God hates more than cowards?
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:45.580]  People that don't take their destiny in their hands.
[02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:48.940]  People that don't love beauty.
[02:28:48.940 --> 02:28:50.140]  People that don't love strength.
[02:28:50.140 --> 02:28:51.580]  People that don't love...
[02:28:51.770 --> 02:28:55.770]  ...the animating contest of liberty.
[02:29:22.770 --> 02:29:25.770]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[02:29:25.770 --> 02:29:27.770]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[02:29:27.770 --> 02:29:32.770]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[02:29:32.770 --> 02:29:34.770]  It's just churches and mosques.
[02:29:34.770 --> 02:29:36.770]  It's just singing.
[02:29:36.770 --> 02:29:39.770]  It's just travel.
[02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:41.770]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[02:29:41.770 --> 02:29:43.770]  It's just for the greater good.
[02:29:43.770 --> 02:29:47.770]  It's just fact-checking, not censorship.
[02:29:47.770 --> 02:29:49.770]  It's just mandatory.
[02:29:49.770 --> 02:29:51.770]  It isn't just at all.
[02:29:51.770 --> 02:29:55.770]  Visit DefendJones.com to help fight back today.
[02:29:56.770 --> 02:30:03.770]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down this is the most concentrated, high-quality bone broth there is.

[02:31:28.770 --> 02:31:31.770]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.

[02:31:40.770 --> 02:31:47.770]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for, they're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.

[02:31:55.770 --> 02:31:57.770]  You wanted to plug Rainforce. Do you like Rainforce?
[02:31:57.770 --> 02:31:59.770]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckinladley.
[02:31:59.770 --> 02:32:02.770]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[02:32:02.770 --> 02:32:08.770]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mikovits, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones.
[02:32:08.770 --> 02:32:11.770]  That's because I use Rainforce every day.
[02:32:11.770 --> 02:32:16.770]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[02:32:16.770 --> 02:32:25.770]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins, but the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is Rainforce.
[02:32:25.770 --> 02:32:33.770]  I'll take Rainforce in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[02:32:33.770 --> 02:32:39.770]  So it really is true that Rainforce is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:45.770]  All right, we love you. We'll be right back. Get your Rainforce Plus, Rainforce Ultra, and Turbo Force at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:45.770 --> 02:32:47.770]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[02:32:56.140 --> 02:33:05.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.140 --> 02:33:15.140]  The man who pulls back the curtain on the deep state, Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.140 --> 02:33:42.140]  And I am just so thankful to God, and I don't think our demonic enemies have any imagination.
[02:33:42.140 --> 02:33:49.740]  In fact, I know they don't, because if they ever saw what I've seen, if they ever felt
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:34:03.740]  for one millisecond the third heaven, it is heaven. That's why it's called that.
[02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:09.740]  It's not completion. It's not satisfaction. It's not ecstasy.
[02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:21.740]  It is timeless, total understanding and love, and a feeling of contentment that is so transformative
[02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:26.740]  to just bathe in the consciousness of the Creator. And it all makes sense.
[02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:32.740]  And I'm just blessed, because I unfortunately know this. Most people have not been as blessed
[02:34:32.740 --> 02:34:41.740]  as I've been to experience, I know there's higher levels, but what I've been given access to
[02:34:41.740 --> 02:34:44.740]  only five, six times.
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:49.880]  Yes.
[02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:59.980]  So good that I would spend trillions of years in hell to have one moment of this,
[02:34:59.980 --> 02:35:00.900]  and I've already been given it.
[02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:11.090]  Because I already experienced it when I was a very young child.
[02:35:11.090 --> 02:35:19.570]  Full space, interdimensional level, that recurring dream was the gate being opened.
[02:35:19.570 --> 02:35:25.970]  But it wasn't until I did the work and stood against the enemy that it interdimensionally
[02:35:25.970 --> 02:35:33.570]  created enough charge to then break the wall and go to the next level.
[02:35:33.570 --> 02:35:40.050]  And that's why God does this, is because we've got to be persecuted by evil so that we can
[02:35:40.050 --> 02:35:44.330]  recognize the opposite of it.
[02:35:44.330 --> 02:35:47.570]  Because if you're just given something, you don't appreciate it.
[02:35:47.570 --> 02:35:49.170]  Everybody knows that.
[02:35:49.170 --> 02:35:56.690]  You've got to be shown the other side before you can be shown infinity.
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:04.880]  All right, let's play this clip. I'll come back and get to Sean Penn.
[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:31.880]  I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.
[02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:46.880]  Harrison, visit Infowars.com forward slash show now.
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:53.880]  I hope that old man got that tractor beam by the commissioner. This is going to be a real short trip, okay?
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:37:01.880]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:05.880]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show today.
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:24.880]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:28.880]  This has been an important 2 Plus Howard broadcast.
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:35.880]  And it's only here because of you, so I humbly appreciate you. I say that you should support the transmission.
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:41.880]  Go to DefendJones.com if you want to donate directly to me for legal and professional fees so I can stay on here.
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:52.880]  Free speech has got about 5% gas, which is high. That's the highest we've been in the black in a few years.
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:57.880]  So we're about 5% above the red. Infowars is somewhat halfway, barely stabilized.
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:02.880]  I have no money to pay my legal fees. The judge said I had to pay half of them. I don't have any money. They lied and said it.
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:06.880]  The judge said he's about to reverse that, or it looks like he is, but he signaled that.
[02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:11.880]  But you want me to fight somebody? I mean, I'm taking on the Democratic Party, the whole New World Order.
[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:14.880]  Trump's already spent $67 million this year on lawyers.
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:17.880]  I've been, in the last year, a million dollars in the hole.
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:22.880]  I want to thank all of you that went to DefendJones.com and made donations.
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:25.880]  Whether it's a dollar or a thousand dollars, you know who you are.
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:28.880]  You're in the fight. You've made the decision to take action.

[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:45.880]  Superfilo Vitality is the same as the male Vitality. It's just sold out. It's about to sell out too, 60% off.
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:48.880]  All the great essential oil, fluoride-free toothpaste are there.
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:54.880]  The turmeric, the tooth whitening, and of course, the charcoal toothpaste are there.
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:39:00.880]  Infowarsstore.com. They have a great 3,000 milligram CBD, the best, highest quality you're going to find at the lowest price.
[02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:05.880]  Thousand milligram topical salve. It's all there, and there are great products you need to fund the operation.
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:08.880]  That funds free speech and the crew.
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:13.880]  I have to come here and ask for your help because the court is still not approved.
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:18.880]  The court is still not approved. My salary, I've not been paid when I was supposed to be. I can't pay my legal bills.
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:22.880]  And so I am in your hands. You're making the decision whether to keep us on air or not.
[02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:27.880]  We have amazing products at Infowarsstore.com, and you are literally changing history.
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:33.880]  The globalists are so angry. These aren't just words. Listen to me. They're so angry we're still on air.
[02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:39.880]  They're so upset that they haven't silenced us because they haven't broken your will.
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:44.880]  They haven't gotten you to give up. So spread the word, please. Share the article, share the video, share the clips.
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:49.880]  You're doing it. I see it. Intensify it. Call and talk radio, plug the show, whatever you've got to do.
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:55.880]  It's having a big effect. Infowars and Alex Jones was right, and I'm very humble about this because I'm not perfect,
[02:39:56.880 --> 02:39:59.880]  but it's a rallying point that people are saying, you want to destroy this guy? We got us back.
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:02.880]  Thank you for myself, the crew, and my family.
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:07.880]  But please get products to keep Infowars on air. Plus, get great products that empower your life.

[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:43.880]  Thank you to the crew. Thank you to everybody else.
[02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:48.880]  I'll see you back tomorrow, Lord willing, 4 p.m. Central.
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:53.880]  Marjorie Taylor Greene in studio. The ADL deep dive and more.
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:56.880]  4 p.m. Central, 5 p.m. Eastern. God bless and good luck.
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:28.880]  On March 20th, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq.
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:33.880]  Exactly one year before the invasion, Alex Jones predicted it.
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:37.880]  So now everybody's going, wow, it really was the Iraqis.
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:39.880]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:41.880]  What a beautiful setup.
[02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:44.880]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now,
[02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:47.880]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:55.880]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:41:57.880]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:41:59.880]  I thought it was next week. I come in this morning.
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:01.880]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:04.880]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:07.880]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:09.880]  Overhead shot, please.
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:13.880]  Look how full this bottle is.
[02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:16.880]  Right to the top, folks.
[02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:22.880]  Right to the top with these 95% curcumin oil.
[02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:27.880]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:29.880]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:33.880]  This is 95%.
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:35.880]  Super constant.
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:38.880]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:40.880]  It's that powerful.
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:42.880]  Or more.

[02:43:56.880 --> 02:43:57.880]  Hey everybody, Rodney outbound here.
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:02.880]  I want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars for offering scholarships to River University.
[02:44:03.880 --> 02:44:10.880]  Maybe you're watching InfoWars today and you don't know what to do with the problems that we face in the world today.
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:14.880]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2021, 22, 23.
[02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:21.880]  But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is, but we show you how to deal with it.
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:28.880]  Come, a full three-year bachelor degree will train you up in ministry, government, worship.

[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:11.880]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get the highest quality gloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:13.880]  But now we've got it.
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:16.880]  30 parts per million from the top lab. We've got a limited shipment.
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:18.880]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.

[02:45:52.880 --> 02:46:00.880]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality coffee has not been available.
[02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:05.880]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:08.880]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:18.880]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated.
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:21.880]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:30.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:34.880]  It is game changing. All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.

[02:46:56.400 --> 02:47:05.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:24.400]  So, we came out here an hour ago and not one leftist would defend the mass from the shots with a coherent argument.
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:30.400]  None of them could change my mind about not wanting the COVID charity protocol to come back.
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:36.400]  Send me your non-binary quadruple bags! Champion!
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:42.400]  Tell me why we need new mandates and new lockdowns and fight now!
[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:49.400]  I didn't take a shot and I'm thankful for you for showing that I didn't do that because you awaken me to a lot of things.
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:50.400]  How are you doing?
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:52.400]  Good for you.
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:56.400]  Tell us real quick, would you like to wear a mask again or try to bring the mandates back?
[02:47:56.400 --> 02:47:57.400]  I think not.
[02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:58.400]  So you're not? Well, come tell us!
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:47:59.400]  No, no, no, no.
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:01.400]  You won't? Well, you better speak up. They're coming to do it.
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:03.400]  So, I'd say what? Five to one or against it?
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:06.400]  More shots! More shots! You want more shots?
[02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:07.400]  You need a hug!
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:10.400]  What? You need more shots! I do? Come give me a hug!
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:20.400]  Alex Jones turned out to be right and Bill Gates and Fauci and Claude Schwab, they turned out to be wrong because they were lying on purpose
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:23.400]  and they need to go to prison for what they've done!
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:30.400]  We have only begun to fight in the information war and we will never surrender!
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:35.400]  Never surrender!
[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:56.400]  I like how unfamiliar friends stream in from the other ends
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:01.400]  Everywhere you look, everywhere there's a gun
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:03.400]  I'm out to hold on to you
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:08.400]  Everywhere you look, everywhere there's a place
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:11.400]  A place other than you two
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:15.400]  But you just can't take all these lives anymore
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:20.400]  Down with Crowder will carry you home
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:23.400]  Everywhere you look
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:30.400]  Hello, this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:33.400]  Yeah, yeah. Infoworth.com
[02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:40.400]  My judge, what is the secret of the universe?
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:43.400]  Infoworth.com
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:53.400]  This is Alexander Soros and whatever you do, don't go to Infoworth.com forward slash show
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:55.400]  It sucks
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:08.400]  Well, in case you didn't know, the UN and the CDC and all the criminals like Fauci
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:14.400]  are planning to try to bring back the COVID protocols
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:19.400]  and all the fear and the mask and the mind control
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:23.400]  And I saw some women come by earlier and they scoffed at the no more mask
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:29.400]  Well, they should put one on their face and they should get the bacterial pneumonia they love so much
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:37.400]  So, right here we are in the center of captured New California, formerly Austin, Texas
[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:42.400]  And I'm doing this with Steven Crowder who has, of course, the famous program Change My Mind
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:46.400]  We're doing it right now. We're trying to bring back the mandates
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:49.400]  They got their new poison booster shot
[02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:57.400]  I'd like to hear from people out here that either want the mandates to come back or don't want it
[02:50:57.400 --> 02:51:04.400]  But, of course, I don't want it and I challenge anybody on the left to try to change my mind
[02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:11.400]  So we're out here to have a discussion with anybody that wants to change our mind
[02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:15.400]  that these shots are poisonous and don't work and that the masks don't work
[02:51:15.400 --> 02:51:18.400]  and we've been dealing with serious tyranny
[02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:23.400]  So I'll be sitting right here, not on Bullhorn, anybody wants to come over and talk to us is welcome, sir
[02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:25.400]  Sir, come on over
[02:51:25.400 --> 02:51:26.400]  How you doing?
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:27.400]  I'm Alex
[02:51:27.400 --> 02:51:28.400]  How you doing? Here, have a seat
[02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:30.400]  What's your view on the mask and all the rest of it?
[02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:32.400]  It's horseshit
[02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:34.400]  So I don't need to change your mind, man
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:36.400]  Well, I guess you're not going to be able to change my mind
[02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:38.400]  You know, they're trying to bring back the mandates and controls again
[02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:40.400]  I got COVID on purpose when I first came out
[02:51:40.400 --> 02:51:42.400]  I'm sure you're talking about natural immunity
[02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:44.400]  Absolutely
[02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:46.400]  God bless you, man
[02:51:46.400 --> 02:51:48.400]  You guys looking forward to the new mask mandate?
[02:51:48.400 --> 02:51:49.400]  Absolutely
[02:51:49.400 --> 02:51:50.400]  Oh, you are?
[02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:53.400]  Lawyer, come talk to us about it. Why aren't you wearing your mask?
[02:51:57.400 --> 02:51:58.400]  Hey, Alex
[02:51:58.400 --> 02:51:59.400]  Come on over, brother
[02:51:59.400 --> 02:52:00.400]  I love you so much
[02:52:01.400 --> 02:52:02.400]  Tell us real quick your view
[02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:04.400]  You know, they're trying to bring back the mandates
[02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:05.400]  What do you think about that?
[02:52:05.400 --> 02:52:06.400]  That's crazy
[02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:07.400]  Why would we do that?
[02:52:07.400 --> 02:52:09.400]  It has no benefit to us
[02:52:09.400 --> 02:52:11.400]  It just has benefit to them
[02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:14.400]  And what do you think about the so-called new booster they got coming out?
[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:15.400]  Well, you know what that is
[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:17.400]  Looks like you're pretty healthy without it
[02:52:17.400 --> 02:52:18.400]  I didn't take a shot
[02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:20.400]  And I'm thankful for you
[02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:22.400]  That I didn't do that because you
[02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:24.400]  You awaken me to a lot of things
[02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:26.400]  Well, give us 30 seconds on your view on it
[02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:28.400]  Well, you know, it's almost biblical, right?
[02:52:28.400 --> 02:52:29.400]  It's, uh
[02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:34.400]  People want to control people
[02:52:34.400 --> 02:52:37.400]  And it just seems to be a human nature to try to hurt each other
[02:52:37.400 --> 02:52:38.400]  Absolutely, what power?
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:40.400]  We're separated from each other
[02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:41.400]  And that's wrong
[02:52:41.400 --> 02:52:42.400]  We're not supposed to be separated
[02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:43.400]  We're one
[02:52:43.400 --> 02:52:44.400]  What's your name, brother?
[02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:45.400]  I'm Mark Duke
[02:52:45.400 --> 02:52:46.400]  Nice to meet you, Mark
[02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:47.400]  Take care
[02:52:47.400 --> 02:52:48.400]  Pleasure, see you
[02:52:48.400 --> 02:52:49.400]  Take care
[02:52:49.400 --> 02:52:50.400]  How you doing?
[02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:52.400]  Ma'am, why is your dog not wearing a mask?
[02:52:52.400 --> 02:52:57.400]  You can shove your poison shots up your new world order ass!
[02:52:58.400 --> 02:52:59.400]  I've been shadowbanned
[02:52:59.400 --> 02:53:01.400]  I've been called a liar
[02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:05.400]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man
[02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:08.400]  My life has been threatened repeatedly
[02:53:08.400 --> 02:53:10.400]  They've tried to destroy me
[02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:12.400]  But I've survived
[02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:15.400]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club
[02:53:16.400 --> 02:53:19.400]  The re-platforming begins now
[02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:20.400]  Join Mug Club
[02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:21.400]  And get one month free

[02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:32.400]  This is not about somebody wanting to put on pantyhose and have their sexual organs changed
[02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:34.400]  It's about shocking our children
[02:53:34.400 --> 02:53:36.400]  All these groups are pedophile, let's face it
[02:53:36.400 --> 02:53:38.400]  They want to talk about sex with your kids
[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:40.400]  And in the name of tolerance
[02:53:40.400 --> 02:53:42.400]  They're gonna put your kids on Ritalin and Prozac
[02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:45.400]  They're gonna inject them with deadly vaccines full of cancer viruses
[02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:46.400]  And they're gonna really screw them up
[02:53:46.400 --> 02:53:49.400]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now

[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:25.400]  I made it in my mind because
[02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:32.400]  A new craze has spread among teenagers and patriots all across America
[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:36.400]  The mainstream media is calling it InfoWars Mania

[02:54:59.400 --> 02:55:02.400]  You know life was saved by Alex Jones
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:07.400]  Despite all the invitations
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:09.400]  You know you could just go out
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:11.400]  And dance to that InfoWars station
[02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:14.400]  It was alright
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:17.400]  Hey baby, no, it was alright
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:21.400]  Scary checkpoints, corruption, Monsanto, the aspartame
[02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:23.400]  Boy, end of the vaccines
[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:25.400]  Thumb scanners forgive to get their luck
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:27.400]  To tactless societies
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:31.400]  Satellite tracking systems, cops in black ski masks
[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:34.400]  Foreign troops, FEMA camps
[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:37.400]  She started dancing to that bon bon music
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:40.400]  You know life was saved by Alex Jones
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:46.400]  Despite all the computations
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:49.400]  You could just dance to that InfoWars station
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:52.400]  Baby, it was alright
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:55.400]  It was alright
[02:55:55.400 --> 02:55:57.400]  New world order, we're coming for you, you hear us?
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:01.400]  Good evening, I'm Erika Lost
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:04.400]  An unidentified man is being held for questioning by the FBI
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:08.400]  For suspected links to last month's biological virus deaths
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:13.400]  In local news, a dog named Hero takes the grand prize at the annual
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:15.400]  I wish I could tell you more pertinent news
[02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:17.400]  But we're in a rating system here
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:19.400]  And the key factor is
[02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:20.400]  Sensationalism
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:22.400]  They've got you running in circles
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:24.400]  Nine to five
[02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:26.400]  And five to nine
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:28.400]  You're mine
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:30.400]  I tell you what they want you to know
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:32.400]  And you consider it the truth
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:35.400]  Nobody is opening their eyes
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:38.400]  Our global economy is depleting the world
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:41.400]  Of our lives and natural resources
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:44.400]  And all you have been

[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:29.400]  And my mind
[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:34.400]  It's alright
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:38.400]  If you got candy
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:41.400]  It's alright
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:46.400]  If you're so cool
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:11.400]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body

[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:27.400]  But our super powerful extract used in bodies

[03:00:03.400 --> 03:00:06.400]  The left wing lunatics are trying very hard
[03:00:06.400 --> 03:00:09.400]  To bring back COVID lockdowns and mandates
[03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:12.400]  With all of their sudden fear mongering
[03:00:12.400 --> 03:00:14.400]  About the new variants that are coming
[03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:18.400]  But to every COVID tyrant who wants to take away our freedom

[03:00:19.400 --> 03:00:22.400]  We will not comply
[03:00:22.400 --> 03:00:24.400]  California and New York
[03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:26.400]  Two captured states on each end of the country
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:30.400]  Have officially rolled out new COVID protocols and mandates
[03:00:31.400 --> 03:00:32.400]  On their websites
[03:00:32.400 --> 03:00:37.400]  And said that indeed they're bringing back the controls
[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:39.400]  But we really caught them with their pants down
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:42.400]  Almost two weeks ago with the whistle blower info
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:44.400]  Ladies and gentlemen I got a call yesterday
[03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:46.400]  An individual was in town
[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:52.400]  And they are a high level manager in the PSA
[03:00:52.400 --> 03:00:54.400]  Tuesday we got called in
[03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:55.400]  The managers
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:58.400]  And told that by the middle of September
[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:00.400]  You all have to wear a mask again
[03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:03.400]  And so will airport employees
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:06.400]  Then by the middle of October
[03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:10.400]  They are going to say that everyone flying has to wear a mask
[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:12.400]  Well I mean why is this happening?
[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:15.400]  They said well because of the new variant in Canada
[03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:17.400]  What?
[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:19.400]  People who have had the vaccine
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:24.400]  Are more susceptible to BA.2.A6
[03:01:24.400 --> 03:01:26.400]  What the actual ****
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:29.400]  But I was sent by the whistle blower
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:31.400]  A link to the California website
[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:33.400]  And it says the controls are back
[03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:34.400]  And here they are
[03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:35.400]  Right there in black and white
[03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:37.400]  They're going to roll them out
[03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:38.400]  And through the institutions
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:39.400]  And the corporations
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:40.400]  And the hospitals
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:41.400]  And the hotels
[03:01:41.400 --> 03:01:42.400]  Through the colleges
[03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:44.400]  Through the public schools
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:45.400]  All over the country
[03:01:45.400 --> 03:01:47.400]  They are shutting down public schools
[03:01:47.400 --> 03:01:49.400]  If there's one COVID case
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:51.400]  That's creating the lockdown
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:53.400]  By sending the children back home
[03:01:53.400 --> 03:01:54.400]  That's the beginning of it
[03:01:54.400 --> 03:01:55.400]  My sources
[03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:56.400]  Because I called around
[03:01:56.400 --> 03:01:58.400]  And confirmed what the first source said
[03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:00.400]  It said middle of September
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:02.400]  Biden is set to start the roll out
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:05.400]  Now five, six days later
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:08.400]  I request for additional funding
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:10.400]  For a new vaccine
[03:02:10.400 --> 03:02:11.400]  That is necessary
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:12.400]  That works
[03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:13.400]  And ultimately
[03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:15.400]  It is recommended that
[03:02:15.400 --> 03:02:16.400]  I would like to be recommended
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:17.400]  That everybody can
[03:02:17.400 --> 03:02:19.400]  Joe Biden literally saying
[03:02:19.400 --> 03:02:20.400]  Y'all need to come
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:22.400]  They need to come up with a new vaccine
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:24.400]  And they need to come up with a way
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:25.400]  That people have to take it
[03:02:25.400 --> 03:02:26.400]  No matter what
[03:02:26.400 --> 03:02:29.400]  I'm willing to die about my freedom
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:30.400]  I'm willing to die
[03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:32.400]  About my medical independence
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:33.400]  So all I got to say
[03:02:33.400 --> 03:02:34.400]  To you in that video
[03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:35.400]  Try that s***
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:36.400]  And s*** around
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:37.400]  And find out
[03:02:37.400 --> 03:02:39.400]  FDA and CDC
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:40.400]  They've made an announcement
[03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:42.400]  On the new vaccine
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:43.400]  So currently
[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:45.400]  They said that they will have an
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:47.400]  There'll be an updated vaccine
[03:02:47.400 --> 03:02:48.400]  September, mid-September
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:50.400]  There never was a COVID pandemic
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:51.400]  There never was a SARS-CoV-2
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:52.400]  Novel virus
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:54.400]  There was never any of those things
[03:02:54.400 --> 03:02:57.400]  This was a behavior modification exercise
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:02:59.400]  To fulfill the objective
[03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:02.400]  Of the financial interests
[03:03:02.400 --> 03:03:03.400]  That were being served
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:05.400]  And let's remember
[03:03:05.400 --> 03:03:06.400]  That the quote
[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:09.400]  Until a pandemic
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:10.400]  Is at emergency threshold
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:12.400]  The public doesn't understand
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:14.400]  The need for medical countermeasures
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:16.400]  Such as a pan-coronavirus
[03:03:16.400 --> 03:03:18.400]  Or pan-influenced vaccine
[03:03:18.400 --> 03:03:19.400]  We need the media
[03:03:19.400 --> 03:03:20.400]  To create the hype
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:22.400]  We need to use that hype
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:23.400]  To our advantage
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:24.400]  To get to the real issues
[03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:26.400]  Investors will follow
[03:03:26.400 --> 03:03:27.400]  If they see profit
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:28.400]  At the end of the process
[03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:29.400]  That's a quote from Peter Daszak
[03:03:29.400 --> 03:03:30.400]  That's a quote that was made
[03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:31.400]  At the proceedings
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:33.400]  Of the National Academy of Sciences
[03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:35.400]  Published in 2015
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:36.400]  This is the admission
[03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:38.400]  Of terrorism again
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:39.400]  Now what did I say
[03:03:39.400 --> 03:03:40.400]  They were told
[03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:42.400]  The beginning of the announcements
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:43.400]  Begins September 15
[03:03:43.400 --> 03:03:45.400]  This was just the warming up
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:46.400]  And getting ready
[03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:48.400]  That just so happened to begin
[03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:49.400]  Right after I announced
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:50.400]  It literally six hours later
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:51.400]  Everywhere
[03:03:51.400 --> 03:03:52.400]  They just opened up
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:53.400]  On the public
[03:03:53.400 --> 03:03:55.400]  Every controlled corporate outlet
[03:03:55.400 --> 03:03:56.400]  And then the institutions
[03:03:56.400 --> 03:03:58.400]  To create the fear
[03:03:58.400 --> 03:04:01.400]  You can stop all flights
[03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:02.400]  You can lock down
[03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:04.400]  Entire countries
[03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:06.400]  You can actually do that
[03:04:06.400 --> 03:04:08.400]  And this I would say
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:11.400]  May make us more open
[03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:13.400]  To radical ideas
[03:04:13.400 --> 03:04:15.400]  About how to deal also
[03:04:15.400 --> 03:04:16.400]  With climate change
[03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:18.400]  This has nothing to do
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:19.400]  With public health
[03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:20.400]  It has nothing to do
[03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:22.400]  With breaking any waves
[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:23.400]  It was always about
[03:04:23.400 --> 03:04:25.400]  Breaking people
[03:04:25.400 --> 03:04:27.400]  There's a path of resistance
[03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:28.400]  Or there is a path
[03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:31.400]  Of total enslavement
[03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:32.400]  Come on
[03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:34.400]  Your ancestors
[03:04:34.400 --> 03:04:36.400]  Were stronger than this
[03:04:36.400 --> 03:04:37.400]  You're stronger than this
[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:39.400]  You can focus
[03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:40.400]  On the new world order
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:41.400]  And its activities
[03:04:41.400 --> 03:04:43.400]  And you can ask God
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:45.400]  To lead, guide, and direct you
[03:04:45.400 --> 03:04:47.400]  With discernment
[03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:49.400]  And if you do that
[03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:51.400]  We're unstoppable together
[03:05:18.400 --> 03:05:19.400]  That has applications
[03:05:19.400 --> 03:05:20.400]  For both preparedness
[03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:22.400]  And regular use

[03:05:25.400 --> 03:05:27.400]  Of deionized water

[03:06:35.300 --> 03:06:41.019]  Well, she's firing all of her guns at once, the mighty MTG.
[03:06:41.019 --> 03:06:45.019]  And Texas is already 105, we don't need somebody as beautiful and amazing as her.
[03:06:45.019 --> 03:06:48.220]  She clashes with the heat down here, this place is burning up now.
[03:06:48.220 --> 03:06:49.980]  It is so great to have you here.
[03:06:49.980 --> 03:06:53.580]  So great to be going to dinner tonight and we got an hour with you and you're just
[03:06:53.580 --> 03:06:54.580]  amazing.
[03:06:54.580 --> 03:06:58.539]  I know the Trump attacks, the indictments, I know you're helping quarterback get the
[03:06:58.539 --> 03:07:01.699]  impeachment going, they now admit Biden's getting ready for it.
[03:07:01.699 --> 03:07:05.019]  As you promised months ago, it's coming, they need to first have some of these hearings
[03:07:05.019 --> 03:07:06.019]  and investigations.
[03:07:06.019 --> 03:07:09.140]  But you wanted to talk about, because I just talked to you a few minutes ago before
[03:07:09.140 --> 03:07:13.060]  we went live, you want to talk about what's coming next, their climate lockdown.
[03:07:13.060 --> 03:07:15.980]  So MTG, you are here.
[03:07:15.980 --> 03:07:17.380]  Thank you so much.
[03:07:17.380 --> 03:07:18.380]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:07:18.380 --> 03:07:19.380]  I really appreciate it.
[03:07:19.380 --> 03:07:22.500]  Well, it's always what is the next thing, right?
[03:07:22.699 --> 03:07:28.699]  What we see from Marxism, what we see from the left is any kind of movement that can
[03:07:28.699 --> 03:07:31.580]  capture the masses, get them wrapped up.
[03:07:31.580 --> 03:07:37.660]  So they put the emoji on their social media so they can share it.
[03:07:37.660 --> 03:07:41.539]  Something they get behind, they all donate their money, they all get into the movement.
[03:07:41.539 --> 03:07:43.300]  We saw it happen with BLM.
[03:07:43.300 --> 03:07:46.340]  We saw it happen with COVID, masks, vaccines.
[03:07:46.340 --> 03:07:47.619]  We saw it happen with Ukraine.
[03:07:47.619 --> 03:07:50.939]  They tried it with monkeypox, we made fun of it and it failed.
[03:07:50.939 --> 03:07:54.980]  They're trying to bring COVID back, but I really believe the next thing is going to
[03:07:54.980 --> 03:07:58.900]  be this climate change crisis.
[03:07:58.900 --> 03:08:00.619]  They're going to create it into an emergency.
[03:08:00.619 --> 03:08:03.539]  And Alex, I want to talk about Burning Man for a minute.
[03:08:03.539 --> 03:08:10.779]  We are watching from a distance, there are approximately like 73 or 75,000 people in
[03:08:10.779 --> 03:08:11.779]  Nevada.
[03:08:11.779 --> 03:08:12.779]  And they're locked in there from floods.
[03:08:12.779 --> 03:08:15.340]  And I'm glad, I was going to raise that.
[03:08:15.340 --> 03:08:19.420]  They literally did a mock sacrifice in all this and then it flooded with these tornadoes
[03:08:19.420 --> 03:08:21.179]  and it was, sorry, go ahead.
[03:08:21.179 --> 03:08:24.939]  Well, you know, God has a way of making sure everyone knows who God is.
[03:08:24.939 --> 03:08:26.300]  I'll say that about that.
[03:08:26.300 --> 03:08:29.220]  But let's talk about what is happening in these people.
[03:08:29.220 --> 03:08:35.779]  So there's 73, 75,000 people in Nevada desert right now at this Burning Man.
[03:08:35.779 --> 03:08:36.779]  They're locked in.
[03:08:36.779 --> 03:08:38.500]  They're not allowed to leave.
[03:08:38.500 --> 03:08:44.380]  And they're basically probably being brainwashed that climate change is the cause of all
[03:08:44.380 --> 03:08:45.380]  of it.
[03:08:45.380 --> 03:08:48.140]  It's the root of all evil and it's going to destroy the earth.
[03:08:48.140 --> 03:08:49.820]  And they're feeling the panic.
[03:08:49.820 --> 03:08:52.859]  The media is saying that, oh, this is because you didn't know about climate change.
[03:08:52.859 --> 03:08:53.859]  Yes.
[03:08:53.859 --> 03:08:54.939]  So what's going to happen, Alex?
[03:08:54.939 --> 03:08:58.220]  It's the same way they launch any kind of movement.
[03:08:58.220 --> 03:09:03.900]  After this is over and Burning Man and these 75,000 people disperse and they go back home,
[03:09:03.900 --> 03:09:07.099]  they're going to have these stories to tell and how terrible it is and how we have
[03:09:07.099 --> 03:09:10.500]  to do everything possible to stop climate change.
[03:09:10.500 --> 03:09:13.420]  It's caused by humans and it's carbon.
[03:09:13.420 --> 03:09:15.259]  And it's the amount of carbon that we put out.
[03:09:15.259 --> 03:09:16.720]  It's manufacturing.
[03:09:17.199 --> 03:09:19.800]  It's our gas and diesel engines.
[03:09:19.800 --> 03:09:20.800]  It's agriculture.
[03:09:20.800 --> 03:09:24.119]  I mean, AOC wants to get rid of cattle.
[03:09:24.119 --> 03:09:25.160]  Even population.
[03:09:25.160 --> 03:09:28.119]  We have too many humans putting out too much carbon.
[03:09:28.119 --> 03:09:31.359]  You're going to start hearing all this stuff and this is going to build.
[03:09:31.359 --> 03:09:34.480]  And I believe this is the left's new lie.
[03:09:34.480 --> 03:09:38.679]  They're going to put on the American people and try to get everyone behind and create
[03:09:38.679 --> 03:09:43.480]  it to where, remember AOC and the left and many others said that the earth is going
[03:09:43.480 --> 03:09:45.519]  to literally explode in a ball of fire.
[03:09:45.519 --> 03:09:46.519]  We're going to all die.
[03:09:46.519 --> 03:09:48.320]  It's going to be the end of the world.
[03:09:48.320 --> 03:09:50.400]  This is what they're brainwashing people to believe.
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:51.400]  No, I totally agree.
[03:09:51.400 --> 03:09:55.480]  Now Biden says he's set to announce a new climate emergency that Klaus Schwab said three
[03:09:55.480 --> 03:09:57.480]  years ago they do after COVID.
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:10:00.560]  So they literally cut our resources off and make it fancy.
[03:10:00.560 --> 03:10:02.119]  Well let's be realistic though.
[03:10:02.119 --> 03:10:03.960]  Yes, the climate changes.
[03:10:03.960 --> 03:10:09.359]  It's been changing since the beginning of time, since God created the earth, the climate
[03:10:09.359 --> 03:10:10.640]  has changed.
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:15.800]  And that is the reality because we live on our planet is moving.
[03:10:15.800 --> 03:10:16.880]  It's rotating.
[03:10:16.880 --> 03:10:17.880]  It's moving through.
[03:10:17.880 --> 03:10:19.519]  The only cause of this change.
[03:10:19.519 --> 03:10:21.420]  It always changes.
[03:10:21.420 --> 03:10:22.840]  It rotates around the sun.
[03:10:22.840 --> 03:10:24.240]  It moves through the galaxy.
[03:10:24.240 --> 03:10:26.820]  Our galaxy rotates through the universe.
[03:10:26.820 --> 03:10:30.519]  Of course our climate is going to change.
[03:10:30.519 --> 03:10:32.400]  But does that mean people are causing it?
[03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:33.400]  No.
[03:10:33.400 --> 03:10:35.599]  Does that mean we have to raise taxes to stop it?
[03:10:35.599 --> 03:10:36.880]  No, absolutely not.
[03:10:36.880 --> 03:10:40.599]  Does that mean we have to bow down to a globalist government?
[03:10:40.599 --> 03:10:42.759]  As if they can stop it anyways.
[03:10:42.759 --> 03:10:44.039]  They can't stop it.
[03:10:44.039 --> 03:10:46.080]  It's all the sun, as you said.
[03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:51.880]  So what's happening in Congress, because I know we're getting close to impeachment movements.
[03:10:51.880 --> 03:10:55.560]  We know Biden's the puppet, but still we need to get them on the defense because that
[03:10:55.560 --> 03:11:03.420]  ties into these insane indictments of Trump, which even Donna Brazile admits has totally
[03:11:03.420 --> 03:11:05.359]  blown up their face.
[03:11:05.359 --> 03:11:13.039]  Well, so day one, when I entered Congress in January of 2021, on Joe Biden's first day
[03:11:13.039 --> 03:11:16.220]  in office, I introduced articles of impeachment.
[03:11:16.220 --> 03:11:21.920]  And I introduced those against Joe Biden because of Ukraine, because of Burisma, because
[03:11:21.920 --> 03:11:23.060]  we knew the truth.
[03:11:23.060 --> 03:11:24.960]  We knew the truth a long time ago.
[03:11:24.960 --> 03:11:27.000]  And I introduced those articles of impeachment.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:32.320]  This has been a movement I have been pushing since the time I came into Congress.
[03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:35.199]  This is why they kicked me off committees.
[03:11:35.199 --> 03:11:38.300]  This is why they tried to politically destroy me.
[03:11:38.300 --> 03:11:42.119]  But finally, through our oversight investigations, I'm on the oversight committee.
[03:11:42.119 --> 03:11:46.580]  We have been investigating Joe Biden since the beginning of this Congress and the amount
[03:11:46.580 --> 03:11:52.679]  of evidence we have produced has become so overwhelming now that even our Republicans
[03:11:52.679 --> 03:11:57.980]  in Congress that don't want to have anything to do with impeachment, they are now,
[03:11:57.980 --> 03:12:03.220]  we believe, I believe we have enough votes to vote for impeachment inquiry when we go
[03:12:03.220 --> 03:12:05.980]  back here next week in September.
[03:12:05.980 --> 03:12:06.980]  Amazing.
[03:12:06.980 --> 03:12:07.980]  Elaborate on that.
[03:12:07.980 --> 03:12:11.460]  And then what about impeachment of Merritt Garland or I mean, these people are a joke.
[03:12:11.460 --> 03:12:14.460]  And then you've got Jack Smith meeting secretly at the White House.
[03:12:14.460 --> 03:12:15.460]  That's right.
[03:12:15.460 --> 03:12:19.460]  So if everyone wants to know more information, you can go to impeachmentteam.com, impeachmentteam.com.
[03:12:19.460 --> 03:12:25.619]  By the way, I want to hear a record skip sound right now in everybody's mind.
[03:12:25.619 --> 03:12:28.300]  Slowly give us out because you're on the field.
[03:12:28.300 --> 03:12:30.460]  You're a champion in the fight.
[03:12:30.460 --> 03:12:31.939]  You are quarterbacking this.
[03:12:31.939 --> 03:12:32.939]  You're getting this done.
[03:12:32.939 --> 03:12:35.939]  I promise this month ago, it's happening now.
[03:12:35.939 --> 03:12:36.939]  People need to go to the site.
[03:12:36.939 --> 03:12:37.939]  They need to tweet it.
[03:12:37.939 --> 03:12:38.939]  They need to share it.
[03:12:38.939 --> 03:12:39.939]  They need to get behind it.
[03:12:39.939 --> 03:12:40.939]  So explain this to us.
[03:12:40.939 --> 03:12:43.420]  OK, so I've introduced articles of impeachment on Joe Biden.
[03:12:43.420 --> 03:12:46.099]  I've introduced articles of impeachment on Merritt Garland.
[03:12:46.099 --> 03:12:51.179]  I've introduced articles of impeachment on Christopher Wray, Matthew Graves, who persecutes
[03:12:51.179 --> 03:12:57.340]  January 6th defendants, pro-life protesters, parents who hold their school board accountable.
[03:12:57.340 --> 03:12:58.340]  That's Matthew Graves.
[03:12:58.340 --> 03:13:03.340]  I've introduced articles of impeachment against Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
[03:13:03.340 --> 03:13:04.599]  Here's what's happening.
[03:13:04.599 --> 03:13:08.160]  The amount of evidence, Alex, is becoming so overwhelming.
[03:13:08.160 --> 03:13:09.859]  Just like, here, let me say this.
[03:13:09.859 --> 03:13:11.660]  This is really important.
[03:13:11.660 --> 03:13:17.380]  Just like we can truly say, at least I can truly say, I believe the Great Awakening is
[03:13:17.380 --> 03:13:20.619]  occurring because of truth.
[03:13:20.619 --> 03:13:24.840]  People all over are waking up and God is dividing people by the sheep and goats.
[03:13:24.840 --> 03:13:26.460]  He is literally dividing us.
[03:13:26.460 --> 03:13:28.820]  There's people that can't hear the truth right now, and then there's people that are
[03:13:28.820 --> 03:13:30.539]  waking up over and over.
[03:13:30.539 --> 03:13:38.140]  The amount of truth that is basically just coming out throughout Congress is forcing
[03:13:38.140 --> 03:13:42.019]  the will of Congress, forcing the will of Republicans.
[03:13:42.019 --> 03:13:45.740]  Republicans that wouldn't act before are now becoming willing to act.
[03:13:45.740 --> 03:13:51.160]  And so I have a lot of encouragement and hope where we are going forward.
[03:13:51.160 --> 03:13:55.900]  But at the same time, I caution people at home to please have patience, even though that's
[03:13:55.900 --> 03:13:59.220]  the hardest thing to have, because I feel the same way as you do.
[03:13:59.220 --> 03:14:02.580]  I want impeachment now and I want it on all these people.
[03:14:02.580 --> 03:14:05.420]  But what we have to do is we have to continue to push.
[03:14:05.420 --> 03:14:06.740]  So here's the good thing.
[03:14:06.740 --> 03:14:10.140]  All of my colleagues that I work with, they've been at home in their districts and
[03:14:10.140 --> 03:14:12.019]  they've had to hear from their constituents.
[03:14:12.019 --> 03:14:15.340]  They've had to hear from the voters that sent them to Washington.
[03:14:15.340 --> 03:14:17.859]  And I hope to God they have been yelling at them.
[03:14:17.859 --> 03:14:18.859]  You said that.
[03:14:18.859 --> 03:14:20.380]  You said we've got McCarthy about to do it.
[03:14:20.380 --> 03:14:22.140]  He says now they're moving there.
[03:14:22.140 --> 03:14:23.140]  He said he's ready.
[03:14:23.140 --> 03:14:24.460]  You delivered again.
[03:14:24.460 --> 03:14:25.460]  Thank you.
[03:14:26.019 --> 03:14:27.099]  In a way, I get the point.
[03:14:27.099 --> 03:14:31.179]  You've got to ripen it and have the investigations to show it all, to make sure you have the
[03:14:31.179 --> 03:14:32.179]  votes.
[03:14:32.179 --> 03:14:33.179]  Right.
[03:14:33.179 --> 03:14:34.179]  So here's the process.
[03:14:34.179 --> 03:14:36.019]  Let's explain it out in detail so everyone knows.
[03:14:36.019 --> 03:14:39.980]  In the House of Representatives, we have 435 members of Congress.
[03:14:39.980 --> 03:14:41.259]  Let's be clear.
[03:14:41.259 --> 03:14:46.060]  In our system of three branches, federalism is done to make it slow so a dictator can
[03:14:46.060 --> 03:14:47.060]  take control.
[03:14:47.060 --> 03:14:48.060]  So people get frustrated.
[03:14:48.060 --> 03:14:49.060]  It takes time.
[03:14:49.060 --> 03:14:50.060]  But that's how our system works.
[03:14:50.060 --> 03:14:51.060]  Absolutely.
[03:14:51.060 --> 03:14:53.460]  We don't want it fast because imagine if it was split the other way.
[03:14:53.460 --> 03:14:54.980]  We've already seen that.
[03:14:55.019 --> 03:15:00.380]  They impeached Trump twice by abusing the system and abusing power.
[03:15:00.380 --> 03:15:02.740]  So 435 members of Congress.
[03:15:02.740 --> 03:15:07.960]  We have 222 Republican members, only 222.
[03:15:07.960 --> 03:15:14.619]  We have to have 218 yes votes to do anything in the House of Representatives.
[03:15:14.619 --> 03:15:17.220]  Without 218, we fail on everything.
[03:15:17.220 --> 03:15:19.179]  So you've got to overwhelmingly nail it.
[03:15:19.179 --> 03:15:21.539]  We have to overwhelmingly nail it.
[03:15:21.539 --> 03:15:23.019]  Kevin McCarthy has been there.
[03:15:23.019 --> 03:15:24.140]  He's already been there.
[03:15:24.140 --> 03:15:30.060]  He has spent time, our oversight committee has spent time, judiciary has spent time,
[03:15:30.060 --> 03:15:36.220]  Ways and Means Committee has spent time producing evidence, investigating evidence,
[03:15:36.220 --> 03:15:40.220]  and showing it through our committee work so that we can not only show the American
[03:15:40.220 --> 03:15:47.220]  people, we can also show all of our colleagues, everyone in Congress, to convince them, look,
[03:15:47.220 --> 03:15:53.140]  we have the evidence right now not to impeach, literally just to ask the question.
[03:15:53.140 --> 03:15:55.539]  That's what an impeachment inquiry is.
[03:15:55.539 --> 03:16:00.619]  Can we just request iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the
[03:16:00.619 --> 03:16:04.220]  foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:16:04.220 --> 03:16:08.820]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:16:08.820 --> 03:16:13.019]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:16:13.019 --> 03:16:15.859]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:16:15.859 --> 03:16:19.179]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:16:19.179 --> 03:16:24.380]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:16:24.380 --> 03:16:30.019]  keep the soil rich with iodine, and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient
[03:16:30.019 --> 03:16:36.220]  amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet
[03:16:36.220 --> 03:16:38.099]  below the Earth's surface.
[03:16:38.099 --> 03:16:45.859]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best, pure nascent iodine
[03:16:45.859 --> 03:16:50.060]  stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[03:16:50.060 --> 03:16:57.300]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:16:57.300 --> 03:17:01.539]  Coffee has not been available at InfowarsStore.com for two years because the price went up
[03:17:01.539 --> 03:17:03.820]  too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[03:17:03.820 --> 03:17:08.220]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[03:17:08.220 --> 03:17:11.179]  But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their
[03:17:11.179 --> 03:17:15.300]  coffees, I was blown away, we finally had three great coffees that are the best they
[03:17:15.300 --> 03:17:17.900]  have to offer available to you right now.
[03:17:17.900 --> 03:17:22.480]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted, it smells amazing, and it's some of the strongest
[03:17:22.480 --> 03:17:23.900]  coffee I've ever drank.
[03:17:23.900 --> 03:17:28.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single source Colombian coffees are now available
[03:17:28.820 --> 03:17:31.380]  at InfowarsStore.com exclusively.
[03:17:31.380 --> 03:17:36.539]  Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast, tastes great, it's the strong one, really strong.
[03:17:36.539 --> 03:17:38.619]  But these are all close second and thirds.
[03:17:38.619 --> 03:17:42.619]  Medium Roast, Wake of America, whoo, that's what my go-to.
[03:17:42.619 --> 03:17:46.939]  Dark Roast, Tip of the Spear, tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very
[03:17:46.939 --> 03:17:47.939]  strong.
[03:17:47.939 --> 03:17:48.939]  Gives you that pep.
[03:17:48.939 --> 03:17:53.300]  They're all three available at InfowarsStore.com and they fund our operation and each order
[03:17:53.300 --> 03:17:56.900]  gets a Pocket Constitution Citizen Rule Book.
[03:17:56.900 --> 03:18:01.660]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated,
[03:18:01.660 --> 03:18:04.519]  high quality bone broth there is.
[03:18:04.519 --> 03:18:09.720]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing, then a huge dose of Chaga mushroom, a massive
[03:18:09.720 --> 03:18:15.640]  dose of B-Pone, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier
[03:18:15.640 --> 03:18:16.800]  from there.

[03:19:55.200 --> 03:20:07.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:07.480 --> 03:20:11.120]  I will not vote for any appropriation bill that does those things.
[03:20:11.120 --> 03:20:14.560]  I will not vote for a short-term CR that does those things.
[03:20:14.560 --> 03:20:19.600]  And how amazing, though, has been them trying to roll it out again.
[03:20:19.600 --> 03:20:22.160]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:23.160]  They're losing.
[03:20:23.160 --> 03:20:26.300]  They need things to distract people, to suck them into fear.
[03:20:26.300 --> 03:20:28.440]  That's why they need the climate change crisis.
[03:20:28.440 --> 03:20:31.140]  That's why they want climate activists and protesters.
[03:20:31.140 --> 03:20:32.220]  They're going to be rioters.
[03:20:32.220 --> 03:20:33.220]  Just wait.
[03:20:33.220 --> 03:20:34.220]  Then we may have lockdowns.
[03:20:34.220 --> 03:20:35.720]  You're blocking the roads and everything.
[03:20:35.720 --> 03:20:37.020]  Of course they are.
[03:20:37.020 --> 03:20:41.300]  Then we're going to have more COVID to increase mass hysteria and fear.
[03:20:41.300 --> 03:20:43.980]  They need people distracted, and I'll go back to why.
[03:20:43.980 --> 03:20:45.440]  The border's wide open.
[03:20:45.440 --> 03:20:50.020]  Bidenomics is destroying people's ability to pay their bills.
[03:20:50.020 --> 03:20:53.500]  They're putting us into a war that may lead to World War III.
[03:20:53.500 --> 03:20:56.780]  They cannot win on these policies.
[03:20:56.780 --> 03:21:02.140]  They're locking up their top political opponent, President Trump, who we remember four years
[03:21:02.140 --> 03:21:04.980]  with President Trump, as some of the greatest years in American history.
[03:21:04.980 --> 03:21:08.180]  And now the head of the DNC says, this isn't working.
[03:21:08.180 --> 03:21:11.340]  What do they think was going to happen?
[03:21:11.340 --> 03:21:14.740]  Well, they did a good job with elections before.
[03:21:14.740 --> 03:21:17.020]  We understand that.
[03:21:17.020 --> 03:21:23.700]  But I truly see this as, they're so arrogant, really, Alex, they're so arrogant.
[03:21:23.700 --> 03:21:28.200]  They really believe that their policies are the best, that they know what they're doing,
[03:21:28.200 --> 03:21:34.460]  and that these little stupid peons and the uneducated people of America, the deplorables,
[03:21:34.460 --> 03:21:39.620]  as they called us once before, that we don't know what we're doing, that they know better
[03:21:39.620 --> 03:21:43.060]  than us, and that they can just win.
[03:21:43.060 --> 03:21:45.160]  And Marjorie Taylor Greene, that's the key.
[03:21:45.160 --> 03:21:49.840]  The Black Rocks know it's to create an angrier world, destroy things, and consolidate power.
[03:21:49.840 --> 03:21:53.240]  But you're right, the Democrats actually believe they're creating a utopia, and they're
[03:21:53.240 --> 03:21:55.480]  being given marching orders that are going to destroy everything.
[03:21:55.480 --> 03:21:56.480]  They are.
[03:21:56.480 --> 03:21:58.600]  Well, they're definitely doing that.
[03:21:58.600 --> 03:22:03.800]  They're leading us down to a road of destruction, but I'm telling you, Alex, people are waking
[03:22:03.800 --> 03:22:04.800]  up.
[03:22:04.800 --> 03:22:05.800]  It's the most incredible thing.
[03:22:05.800 --> 03:22:06.800]  Oh, that's an understatement.
[03:22:06.800 --> 03:22:09.920]  And I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying, I don't have a way to describe to people
[03:22:09.920 --> 03:22:13.080]  what I see on the street, because I live in liberal communist Austin.
[03:22:13.080 --> 03:22:14.720]  I got hate a year ago.
[03:22:14.720 --> 03:22:16.520]  No hate ever now.
[03:22:16.520 --> 03:22:18.840]  I mean, it's total reversal.
[03:22:18.840 --> 03:22:23.900]  That's wonderful, because people know, and they're suffering under the Biden administration
[03:22:23.900 --> 03:22:25.300]  or the Biden regime.
[03:22:25.300 --> 03:22:26.540]  They've already been fooled.
[03:22:26.540 --> 03:22:31.440]  People that really bought into COVID, they have come out of this thing so upset and
[03:22:31.440 --> 03:22:32.440]  angry.
[03:22:32.440 --> 03:22:33.440]  Like, I can't believe I got these vaccines.
[03:22:33.440 --> 03:22:34.440]  They didn't even work.
[03:22:34.440 --> 03:22:36.440]  I can't believe I wore a mask all the time.
[03:22:36.440 --> 03:22:37.440]  That didn't help me.
[03:22:37.440 --> 03:22:38.920]  It didn't stop the spread of COVID.
[03:22:38.920 --> 03:22:42.760]  People that are coming out of this are coming out, and they're waking up.
[03:22:42.760 --> 03:22:45.020]  And so they have no desire to go back.
[03:22:45.020 --> 03:22:50.120]  They're also realizing that, oh, maybe there's some truth to this Hunter Biden laptop.
[03:22:50.120 --> 03:22:53.040]  Oh, shoot, maybe Joe Biden has been doing-
[03:22:53.040 --> 03:22:57.180]  So they see Maui really piss people off.
[03:22:57.180 --> 03:22:58.560]  It should piss people off.
[03:22:58.560 --> 03:22:59.960]  Lahaina was a wonderful town.
[03:22:59.960 --> 03:23:00.960]  I've been there many times.
[03:23:00.960 --> 03:23:01.960]  Me too.
[03:23:01.960 --> 03:23:07.160]  Yeah, it was one of the best places to go visit in Maui.
[03:23:07.160 --> 03:23:11.880]  My daughter spent nearly every summer out there for like eight years.
[03:23:11.880 --> 03:23:13.560]  The people there are wonderful.
[03:23:13.560 --> 03:23:16.900]  It just was a great community.
[03:23:16.900 --> 03:23:18.680]  But look at the failure.
[03:23:18.680 --> 03:23:22.600]  He said about the train deal, Roman, he said he's too busy to go there.
[03:23:22.600 --> 03:23:24.300]  We have that club.
[03:23:24.300 --> 03:23:25.300]  Just too busy to go to-
[03:23:25.300 --> 03:23:26.300]  Too busy to go.
[03:23:26.300 --> 03:23:29.220]  Well, you know, Joe Biden, it's amazing.
[03:23:29.220 --> 03:23:34.440]  He wants $24 billion more dollars for Ukraine, but wants to give a $700 one-time payment
[03:23:34.440 --> 03:23:37.360]  to the people of Lahaina that lost everything.
[03:23:37.360 --> 03:23:41.100]  Then when he did go talk to him, he talked about how his kitchen fire and experience
[03:23:41.100 --> 03:23:45.360]  there is that somehow that was comparable to what they went through.
[03:23:45.360 --> 03:23:46.540]  They lost everything.
[03:23:46.540 --> 03:23:47.780]  They can't even find neighbors.
[03:23:47.780 --> 03:23:49.780]  They can't find kids.
[03:23:49.780 --> 03:23:50.900]  Their livelihoods are gone.
[03:23:50.900 --> 03:23:55.300]  Their homes are gone, but yet he hasn't gone to visit East Palestine.
[03:23:55.300 --> 03:23:59.540]  He hasn't gone to the border, but you better bet he's been over to Ukraine to
[03:23:59.540 --> 03:24:04.660]  see Zelensky countless times, and he set his ass on the beach in Delaware I don't
[03:24:04.660 --> 03:24:05.660]  know how many times.
[03:24:05.660 --> 03:24:07.660]  I think at 44% of the time he's on vacation.
[03:24:07.660 --> 03:24:09.420]  Yeah, that's a lot of vacation time.
[03:24:09.420 --> 03:24:15.220]  You know, if you work Monday through Friday, if you work Monday through Friday, that gives
[03:24:15.220 --> 03:24:18.820]  you about 26% of the year vacation time.
[03:24:18.820 --> 03:24:19.820]  Think about that.
[03:24:19.820 --> 03:24:23.100]  If you work Monday through Friday all year long, then you, Saturday and Sunday, Saturday
[03:24:23.100 --> 03:24:28.300]  and Sunday is vacation, so that's about 26% of the year, but Joe Biden has spent
[03:24:28.300 --> 03:24:30.300]  over 40%, 40, 44%.
[03:24:30.300 --> 03:24:31.300]  44%, yeah.
[03:24:31.300 --> 03:24:32.300]  It's incredible.
[03:24:32.300 --> 03:24:35.260]  Well, he's also, he's too old to serve.
[03:24:35.260 --> 03:24:38.100]  Well, that's my next question.
[03:24:38.100 --> 03:24:39.300]  What are they going to do about him?
[03:24:39.300 --> 03:24:41.300]  I mean, they got Newsome kind of getting warmed up.
[03:24:41.300 --> 03:24:42.300]  They got Big Mike.
[03:24:42.300 --> 03:24:43.300]  I'm not sure.
[03:24:43.300 --> 03:24:44.300]  I'm not sure actually.
[03:24:44.300 --> 03:24:49.300]  Oh, Big Mike's got you laughing.
[03:24:49.300 --> 03:24:50.300]  Yeah.
[03:24:50.300 --> 03:24:55.060]  I tell you what, they're going to save her when they, if it hits, if it's a real
[03:24:55.060 --> 03:24:57.300]  emergency, we'll definitely see her come out.
[03:24:57.300 --> 03:24:59.300]  They're going to break in case of emergency.
[03:24:59.300 --> 03:25:00.300]  Exactly.
[03:25:00.300 --> 03:25:01.300]  She's in a case.
[03:25:01.300 --> 03:25:02.300]  It's like a Big Mike.
[03:25:02.300 --> 03:25:03.300]  She's in a case.
[03:25:03.300 --> 03:25:04.300]  She is, she is there.
[03:25:04.300 --> 03:25:07.300]  That is, that's when everything is failing.
[03:25:07.540 --> 03:25:09.540]  Donald Trump's going to win.
[03:25:09.540 --> 03:25:11.680]  Joe Biden is a corrupt criminal.
[03:25:11.680 --> 03:25:12.780]  No one can deny it.
[03:25:12.780 --> 03:25:15.980]  Gavin Newsom can't win because he destroyed California.
[03:25:15.980 --> 03:25:17.100]  They're going to run over there.
[03:25:17.100 --> 03:25:20.940]  They're going to pull the hammer, break the glass, and they're going to pull her out.
[03:25:20.940 --> 03:25:22.940]  Do you think Big Mike's the handsome man?
[03:25:22.940 --> 03:25:25.940]  I'm not getting in trouble all the time.
[03:25:25.940 --> 03:25:29.940]  Well, you know, Joan Rivers might've said things that could...
[03:25:29.940 --> 03:25:30.940]  Yeah.
[03:25:30.940 --> 03:25:31.940]  Wow.
[03:25:31.940 --> 03:25:32.940]  Keep going.
[03:25:32.940 --> 03:25:33.940]  Man, MTG.
[03:25:33.940 --> 03:25:34.940]  I love her.
[03:25:34.940 --> 03:25:36.460]  Yeah, no, really though.
[03:25:36.460 --> 03:25:40.740]  That would be, I don't think she wants to run, I don't think, but we know Obama would
[03:25:40.740 --> 03:25:41.740]  love it.
[03:25:41.740 --> 03:25:44.260]  And actually that'd be their only way to keep going.
[03:25:44.260 --> 03:25:45.260]  And I think...
[03:25:45.260 --> 03:25:47.260]  Isn't this pretty much the third administration of Biden?
[03:25:47.260 --> 03:25:48.760]  Oh, this is totally the third.
[03:25:48.760 --> 03:25:50.300]  It's totally the third term.
[03:25:50.300 --> 03:25:51.300]  Absolutely.
[03:25:51.300 --> 03:25:52.300]  It's the third term.
[03:25:52.300 --> 03:25:55.100]  They've got all the same people back in there.
[03:25:55.100 --> 03:25:59.500]  They're running everything just as if they never skipped a beat.
[03:25:59.500 --> 03:26:02.420]  President Trump was like a speed bump for them.
[03:26:02.420 --> 03:26:07.180]  They went right back to it, pursuing everything they were trying to pursue before.
[03:26:07.180 --> 03:26:09.740]  And they want to continue that process.
[03:26:09.740 --> 03:26:11.180]  And that's where we're at.
[03:26:11.180 --> 03:26:15.940]  And yeah, Michelle Obama, she's definitely the one that will try to save the day.
[03:26:15.940 --> 03:26:18.060]  Roger Stone talks to Trump every day.
[03:26:18.060 --> 03:26:19.980]  He says the guy's got ice water.
[03:26:19.980 --> 03:26:22.580]  He says he's known for 40 something years.
[03:26:22.580 --> 03:26:24.580]  He says Trump's on cloud nine.
[03:26:24.580 --> 03:26:25.580]  What is your view?
[03:26:25.580 --> 03:26:26.580]  You talk to Trump a lot.
[03:26:26.580 --> 03:26:29.100]  This guy's incredible.
[03:26:29.100 --> 03:26:30.340]  President Trump is remarkable.
[03:26:30.340 --> 03:26:36.940]  I think I talk to him a lot, and I think what I can explain to people is, number one,
[03:26:36.940 --> 03:26:38.740]  he is such a real person.
[03:26:38.740 --> 03:26:41.540]  Every time I talk to him, he always asks me, how are you doing, Marjorie?
[03:26:41.540 --> 03:26:43.260]  He genuinely will ask about me.
[03:26:43.260 --> 03:26:45.940]  He called me and my wife on her honeymoon seven years ago.
[03:26:45.940 --> 03:26:47.940]  How did you even know this was happening?
[03:26:47.940 --> 03:26:48.940]  That's great.
[03:26:48.940 --> 03:26:51.060]  That's the kind of man he is, though.
[03:26:51.060 --> 03:26:55.200]  And there's several things that impressed me.
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:27:01.840]  One of them is the fact that he is such a successful businessman for so many years.
[03:27:01.840 --> 03:27:05.480]  And there is no Ph.D. that equals that.
[03:27:05.480 --> 03:27:07.280]  There is no education.
[03:27:07.280 --> 03:27:08.520]  There is nothing that-
[03:27:08.520 --> 03:27:11.320]  When you're a successful businesswoman, you know that's the real streets.
[03:27:11.320 --> 03:27:12.320]  It is.
[03:27:12.320 --> 03:27:13.320]  That is it.
[03:27:13.320 --> 03:27:16.280]  That's why you're so successful, but you never talk about it, but you've been very
[03:27:16.280 --> 03:27:17.280]  successful.
[03:27:17.280 --> 03:27:19.800]  I have, and it takes hard work to be there.
[03:27:19.800 --> 03:27:22.600]  It takes a lot of hard work to get there, but you learn.
[03:27:22.600 --> 03:27:27.760]  You learn real lessons that you cannot learn with any college or university.
[03:27:27.760 --> 03:27:30.520]  There is no master's degree or Ph.D. program-
[03:27:30.520 --> 03:27:32.760]  You don't have to swap BS quick.
[03:27:32.760 --> 03:27:33.760]  Right.
[03:27:33.760 --> 03:27:34.760]  And so President Trump has that.
[03:27:34.760 --> 03:27:37.380]  And then if you take- That's how I view government.
[03:27:37.380 --> 03:27:40.840]  My job in government, I only look at it with a business lens.
[03:27:40.840 --> 03:27:43.420]  And President Trump sees it the same way.
[03:27:43.420 --> 03:27:47.720]  The other thing I really appreciate about President Trump is the fact that he plays golf
[03:27:47.720 --> 03:27:50.480]  every day makes him extremely healthy.
[03:27:50.480 --> 03:27:51.960]  You know, I work out a lot.
[03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:53.520]  That's something that I'm dedicated to, and I-
[03:27:53.520 --> 03:27:55.240]  I love watching you do the power clings.
[03:27:55.240 --> 03:27:56.400]  Thank you.
[03:27:56.400 --> 03:28:00.000]  But health and fitness helps your mental capacity.
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:02.160]  It keeps you sharp.
[03:28:02.160 --> 03:28:08.800]  There's a whole, just everything around it between your health, your fitness, your mental
[03:28:08.800 --> 03:28:09.800]  capacity-
[03:28:09.800 --> 03:28:10.800]  So he's stronger.
[03:28:10.800 --> 03:28:12.200]  Would you say he's stronger now under attack?
[03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:15.600]  I would say he is extremely strong under attack.
[03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:18.080]  Because Brazil said, oh my God, this is a Nietzschean.
[03:28:18.080 --> 03:28:20.040]  She said, that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[03:28:20.040 --> 03:28:21.040]  They're scared.
[03:28:21.120 --> 03:28:23.280]  If you get it, you're in a game of chicken with us.
[03:28:23.280 --> 03:28:26.080]  They should be scared, because I rode down those same streets.
[03:28:26.080 --> 03:28:30.400]  I went to the Atlanta jail, and I rode down there down Rice Street, and I saw all
[03:28:30.400 --> 03:28:34.280]  the people coming out, and they were out on the side of the road, screaming.
[03:28:34.280 --> 03:28:35.280]  Let's talk about that.
[03:28:35.280 --> 03:28:37.520]  And guys, since she mentioned it, I think the clip's in there.
[03:28:37.520 --> 03:28:38.660]  Make sure we bleep it.
[03:28:38.660 --> 03:28:39.760]  This guy's on fire.
[03:28:39.760 --> 03:28:44.880]  This great American, this great American black man, I mean, Joe Rogan sent me this like
[03:28:44.880 --> 03:28:45.880]  three days ago.
[03:28:45.880 --> 03:28:46.880]  This is going on name dropping.
[03:28:46.880 --> 03:28:48.480]  He says, that's how viral this is.
[03:28:48.760 --> 03:28:50.200]  We're going to come back, play this.
[03:28:50.200 --> 03:28:52.080]  MTG is in the house.
[03:28:52.080 --> 03:28:54.960]  We'll give you the URL, too, to get by on the impeachment straight ahead.
[03:28:56.640 --> 03:29:00.760]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high-quality
[03:29:00.760 --> 03:29:02.480]  coffee has not been available.
[03:29:02.480 --> 03:29:06.000]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans, and the quality
[03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:07.160]  had gone down some.
[03:29:07.160 --> 03:29:10.400]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[03:29:10.400 --> 03:29:17.040]  But now, we have brought back the coffee, and it's even better from a national supplier
[03:29:17.040 --> 03:29:19.920]  that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[03:29:19.920 --> 03:29:23.120]  It's powered by the company, Minuteman Coffee.

[03:32:53.600 --> 03:33:04.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:16.600]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[03:33:16.600 --> 03:33:27.600]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[03:33:27.600 --> 03:33:33.600]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:38.600]  Visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[03:33:38.600 --> 03:33:47.600]  Joe Biden literally saying y'all need to come they need to come up with a new vaccine and they need to come up with a way that people have to take it no matter what.
[03:33:47.600 --> 03:33:53.600]  I'm willing to die about my freedom. I'm willing to die about my medical independence.
[03:33:53.600 --> 03:34:03.600]  So all I got to say to you in that video, try this around and find out.
[03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:10.600]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:34:10.600 --> 03:34:17.600]  Well, the future president of the United States, don't just say that to kiss up to her. I feel it.
[03:34:17.600 --> 03:34:25.600]  I think the first female president of the United States, I think in maybe four or eight years, is going to be MTG.
[03:34:25.600 --> 03:34:30.600]  And I can't wait to support her for president of the United States if we save this country.
[03:34:30.600 --> 03:34:34.600]  But MTG, you wanted to get to what's coming next today. You said you came to what's coming next.
[03:34:34.600 --> 03:34:39.600]  This is what InfoWars is all about. All the main numbers show economy and free fall in reality.
[03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:45.600]  We're going to hit that in a moment. But first, this isn't entertainment seeing Trump being attacked like this.
[03:34:45.600 --> 03:34:52.600]  This isn't like a boxing match or a train wreck or a soap opera. This is our future here.
[03:34:52.600 --> 03:34:58.600]  And yeah, he's confident and yeah, it's waking people up, but we can't underestimate our enemies and what they may pull.
[03:34:58.600 --> 03:35:01.600]  Because as Donna Brazile said, they're cornered rats and they're losing.
[03:35:01.600 --> 03:35:07.600]  Gut level and with all your contacts in Congress, MTG, what should we be worried about?
[03:35:07.600 --> 03:35:10.600]  What should we be focused on? What should we be doing? What should we be praying for?
[03:35:10.600 --> 03:35:14.600]  Because they now know nothing they've done has worked. What do they do next?
[03:35:14.600 --> 03:35:18.600]  That's why I've said we don't hope this happens to Biden or Trump.
[03:35:18.600 --> 03:35:23.600]  But I'm really concerned they could have some white supremacists kill Biden, blame us.
[03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:26.600]  They say it's this epidemic that doesn't exist per capita.
[03:35:26.600 --> 03:35:32.600]  And I'm really concerned about them going after Trump because logically, historically, that's the next move of the graph.
[03:35:32.600 --> 03:35:38.600]  Maybe. What I worry about actually is I worry about a hot war.
[03:35:38.600 --> 03:35:42.600]  I worry about a very serious war.
[03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:49.600]  Because historically, if you look at our country, historically, whenever America has gone to war,
[03:35:49.600 --> 03:35:53.600]  the American people rally around whoever the president is.
[03:35:53.600 --> 03:35:55.600]  We remember George Bush after 9-11.
[03:35:55.600 --> 03:35:56.600]  Dr. Surprise.
[03:35:56.600 --> 03:36:06.600]  Yes. So we remember then that's our natural instinct to rally behind our country, behind our flag.
[03:36:06.600 --> 03:36:11.600]  So many people will sign up to join the military and they rally behind the president.
[03:36:11.600 --> 03:36:18.600]  The biggest thing I'm concerned about, Alex, is I'm concerned that they will go to the next level with Ukraine, put troops on the ground.
[03:36:18.600 --> 03:36:22.600]  Russia will absolutely see it for what it really is.
[03:36:22.600 --> 03:36:28.600]  They will go to war with us and the United States and Russia will be in a hot war.
[03:36:28.600 --> 03:36:30.600]  That is my biggest concern.
[03:36:30.600 --> 03:36:40.600]  And I think that would be something that the Democrats, the State Department, the Biden administration could move towards because they will not back off of Ukraine.
[03:36:40.600 --> 03:36:42.600]  And that's exactly what Tucker's been saying.
[03:36:42.600 --> 03:36:43.600]  And now they're sending F-16s.
[03:36:43.600 --> 03:36:47.600]  We know U.S. troops are there as advisers and we know Ukraine's losing now.
[03:36:47.600 --> 03:36:48.600]  So what are you hearing in Congress?
[03:36:48.600 --> 03:36:49.600]  My amendment failed on that.
[03:36:49.600 --> 03:36:52.600]  I had an amendment to block the F-16s going to Ukraine.
[03:36:52.600 --> 03:36:53.600]  It failed on the House floor.
[03:36:53.600 --> 03:36:57.600]  We didn't have enough members of Congress to vote for it.
[03:36:57.600 --> 03:36:59.600]  That's the danger we're in, Alex.
[03:36:59.600 --> 03:37:00.600]  Clear escalation.
[03:37:00.600 --> 03:37:02.600]  There's not much levels left.
[03:37:02.600 --> 03:37:03.600]  No, there's very.
[03:37:03.600 --> 03:37:07.600]  From day one, I voted no for Ukraine.
[03:37:07.600 --> 03:37:09.600]  I voted no for money going there.
[03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:11.600]  I voted no to sanctions on Russia.
[03:37:11.600 --> 03:37:20.600]  I voted no to all of it because the only solution there that makes any rational sense is for those two countries to come to peace terms.
[03:37:20.600 --> 03:37:21.600]  And that's between them.
[03:37:21.600 --> 03:37:23.600]  That doesn't have to involve the United States.
[03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:24.600]  And Trump says he'll get into it overnight.
[03:37:24.600 --> 03:37:25.600]  That's true.
[03:37:25.600 --> 03:37:26.600]  The media says he can't.
[03:37:26.600 --> 03:37:27.600]  The U.S. runs it.
[03:37:27.600 --> 03:37:28.600]  Of course he'll get into it.
[03:37:28.600 --> 03:37:29.600]  Yeah, it can end overnight.
[03:37:29.600 --> 03:37:31.600]  You want to know how we cut off the money.
[03:37:31.600 --> 03:37:32.600]  Zelensky even said it.
[03:37:32.600 --> 03:37:36.600]  He won't even have elections unless America funds his elections.
[03:37:36.600 --> 03:37:38.600]  I'll tell you how bad it is over there.
[03:37:38.600 --> 03:37:43.600]  The United States of America, we send Ukraine one bill.
[03:37:43.600 --> 03:37:44.600]  I'm sorry.
[03:37:44.600 --> 03:37:53.600]  You watching people at home send one billion dollars every single month, every single month to Ukraine to fund their government.
[03:37:53.600 --> 03:37:54.600]  That's not the war.
[03:37:54.600 --> 03:37:56.600]  That's to keep the lights on for their government.
[03:37:56.600 --> 03:37:58.600]  But $700 to people in Maui.
[03:37:58.600 --> 03:38:02.600]  $700 one time for the people in Maui.
[03:38:02.600 --> 03:38:03.600]  And that's outrageous.
[03:38:03.600 --> 03:38:04.600]  It's unacceptable.
[03:38:04.600 --> 03:38:13.600]  But I do believe what we could see is we could see them move us into a full scale war in Ukraine, all in the name of protecting Europe.
[03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:17.600]  They're always saying that Putin, his goal is to take Europe.
[03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:19.600]  We have seen no evidence of that whatsoever.
[03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:21.600]  And I'm not defending Vladimir Putin.
[03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:24.600]  I'm just saying if you look at it black and white.
[03:38:24.600 --> 03:38:28.600]  If Putin had hundreds of thousands of troops in Canada, I'd say go to war with him.
[03:38:28.600 --> 03:38:30.600]  We're there starting this.
[03:38:30.600 --> 03:38:31.600]  Right.
[03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:32.600]  But think about this.
[03:38:32.600 --> 03:38:33.600]  I mean, I'm old enough to remember.
[03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:38.600]  You remember, every time we've ever been at war, didn't we watch it every single night on television?
[03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:43.600]  Remember how we would watch on television the bombing of Baghdad or the bombings in Afghanistan?
[03:38:43.600 --> 03:38:44.600]  It was like entertainment.
[03:38:44.600 --> 03:38:45.600]  It was.
[03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:47.600]  It was like sick, disgusting entertainment.
[03:38:47.600 --> 03:38:50.600]  But they showed it nonstop on the news.
[03:38:50.600 --> 03:38:58.600]  Let me ask you, when is the last time anyone has been able to turn on the television and watch the war that America is funding?
[03:38:58.600 --> 03:39:00.600]  At that point, you don't ever see it.
[03:39:00.600 --> 03:39:02.600]  No, you never see it.
[03:39:02.600 --> 03:39:05.600]  They say it's bigger than Vietnam, Korea.
[03:39:05.600 --> 03:39:07.600]  I mean, it's hundreds of, 340,000 dead.
[03:39:07.600 --> 03:39:09.600]  This is a full war.
[03:39:09.600 --> 03:39:14.600]  Tell me where the CNN war reporters are and why aren't they in a bunker with Ukrainian troops?
[03:39:14.600 --> 03:39:16.600]  Really, I want to know.
[03:39:16.600 --> 03:39:17.600]  Because they don't want you to see the carnage.
[03:39:17.600 --> 03:39:18.600]  That's what they used to do.
[03:39:18.600 --> 03:39:20.600]  That's what we always saw.
[03:39:20.600 --> 03:39:22.600]  Now it's like it's a war on another planet.
[03:39:22.600 --> 03:39:24.600]  It's an invisible war.
[03:39:24.600 --> 03:39:26.600]  You don't get to see it. You're paying for it.
[03:39:26.600 --> 03:39:28.600]  But you don't get to see it.
[03:39:28.600 --> 03:39:30.600]  You want to know why they're lying.
[03:39:30.600 --> 03:39:32.600]  Ukraine is losing this war.
[03:39:32.600 --> 03:39:34.600]  I'm probably the only member of Congress that will say that out loud.
[03:39:34.600 --> 03:39:36.600]  No, you aren't.
[03:39:36.600 --> 03:39:38.600]  I love the meme, how you're not smart.
[03:39:38.600 --> 03:39:40.600]  You're one of the smartest people I know.
[03:39:40.600 --> 03:39:42.600]  You're so smart.
[03:39:42.600 --> 03:39:44.600]  And I love the left claims they're all in power.
[03:39:44.600 --> 03:39:46.600]  They go, oh, MTG is dumb.
[03:39:46.600 --> 03:39:48.600]  It's complex and sophisticated.
[03:39:48.600 --> 03:39:50.600]  And it's just disgusting.
[03:39:50.600 --> 03:39:52.600]  And since when do Democrats support World War III?
[03:39:52.600 --> 03:39:54.600]  I guess they do now.
[03:39:54.600 --> 03:39:56.600]  Absolutely, they do right now.
[03:39:56.600 --> 03:39:58.600]  They have to.
[03:39:58.600 --> 03:40:02.600]  They have to support World War III because it supports their climate change agenda.
[03:40:02.600 --> 03:40:04.600]  It changes the world.
[03:40:04.600 --> 03:40:10.600]  If you support a massive global war, it completely shifts everything.
[03:40:10.600 --> 03:40:12.600]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[03:40:12.600 --> 03:40:16.600]  They're trying to make a full shift in the way, basically the way we live.
[03:40:16.600 --> 03:40:18.600]  The way governments work.
[03:40:18.600 --> 03:40:20.600]  Trade policies.
[03:40:20.600 --> 03:40:24.600]  But they're creeping onto the most dangerous levels that will hurt all of us.
[03:40:24.600 --> 03:40:26.600]  And here's why.
[03:40:26.600 --> 03:40:30.600]  Because we sanctioned Russia, Russia got smart and they went and made trade deals with China.
[03:40:30.600 --> 03:40:34.600]  And then they started making trade deals with other countries.
[03:40:34.600 --> 03:40:36.600]  That was my next point.
[03:40:36.600 --> 03:40:38.600]  This is destroying America's soft power.
[03:40:38.600 --> 03:40:40.600]  And I love our country.
[03:40:40.600 --> 03:40:42.600]  We're seeing America go way down in the world.
[03:40:42.600 --> 03:40:44.600]  Well, look at BRICS.
[03:40:44.600 --> 03:40:48.600]  Because of the war in Ukraine, they have created BRICS.
[03:40:48.600 --> 03:40:52.600]  Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
[03:40:52.600 --> 03:40:58.600]  They've created this very powerful growing international group where they can do trade, buy and sell goods.
[03:40:58.600 --> 03:41:00.600]  The Indians just bought billions in oil.
[03:41:00.600 --> 03:41:04.600]  Yeah, and they're going to tank our dollar because they trade in their own currencies.
[03:41:04.600 --> 03:41:06.600]  Not the U.S. dollar.
[03:41:06.600 --> 03:41:08.600]  They can trade in their own currency.
[03:41:08.600 --> 03:41:10.600]  What's the bigger 30,000 foot view?
[03:41:10.600 --> 03:41:18.600]  The 30,000 foot view is war is an option for the Democrats in their minds to win the election.
[03:41:18.600 --> 03:41:20.600]  Because they think it will rally the people.
[03:41:20.600 --> 03:41:22.600]  So you're saying what's coming next, and I agree with you.
[03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:24.600]  Tucker says it's war.
[03:41:24.600 --> 03:41:26.600]  Expanded war.
[03:41:26.600 --> 03:41:28.600]  Absolutely. I see war.
[03:41:28.600 --> 03:41:32.600]  I see war because I introduce amendment after amendment on the House floor and I cannot get my amendments passed.
[03:41:32.600 --> 03:41:34.600]  To stop F-16s.
[03:41:34.600 --> 03:41:36.600]  To stop funding to go to Ukraine.
[03:41:36.600 --> 03:41:40.600]  Even though the American people overwhelmingly do not support the Ukraine war.
[03:41:40.600 --> 03:41:50.600]  And by the way, the Russians can shoot down a 5,000 mile an hour mock missile the British sold them.
[03:41:50.600 --> 03:41:53.600]  An F-16 only goes like 1500.
[03:41:53.600 --> 03:41:55.600]  They're going to blow those up anyway.
[03:41:55.600 --> 03:41:56.600]  So what is the point?
[03:41:56.600 --> 03:42:02.600]  Well I think if you're to control the American people, number one, you have to make them feel afraid of something.
[03:42:02.600 --> 03:42:03.600]  Or multiple things.
[03:42:03.600 --> 03:42:05.600]  It doesn't have to be just one thing.
[03:42:05.600 --> 03:42:07.600]  It can be the continuing threat of COVID.
[03:42:07.600 --> 03:42:09.600]  It's continuing. It will never go away.
[03:42:09.600 --> 03:42:13.600]  That's why they want new vaccines and more mask mandates and more vaccines.
[03:42:13.600 --> 03:42:15.600]  And we have to keep fighting COVID.
[03:42:15.600 --> 03:42:18.600]  Don't you love that they're like, yeah we want new mandates, but you're crazy.
[03:42:18.600 --> 03:42:19.600]  We don't want new mandates.
[03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:20.600]  Right.
[03:42:20.600 --> 03:42:21.600]  Have you seen that little mind control?
[03:42:21.600 --> 03:42:22.600]  Oh, of course.
[03:42:22.600 --> 03:42:24.600]  And then, and now it's climate change.
[03:42:24.600 --> 03:42:26.600]  And oh, the poor people in Burning Man.
[03:42:26.600 --> 03:42:31.600]  And they're going to run out of there convinced, brainwashed, that that's what happened to them.
[03:42:32.600 --> 03:42:37.600]  Was because man-made climate change nearly killed them in the desert of Nevada.
[03:42:37.600 --> 03:42:39.600]  They're going to run out of there and spread that.
[03:42:39.600 --> 03:42:45.600]  It'll be multiple issues, but the ultimate one is a world war.
[03:42:45.600 --> 03:42:47.600]  And I believe that's where we're going.
[03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:48.600]  Wow.
[03:42:48.600 --> 03:42:51.600]  Let's talk about impeachment again.
[03:42:51.600 --> 03:42:52.600]  You've got a website.
[03:42:52.600 --> 03:42:53.600]  What do people do there?
[03:42:53.600 --> 03:42:54.600]  How do they get involved?
[03:42:54.600 --> 03:42:55.600]  Because we need to put...
[03:42:56.600 --> 03:42:57.600]  Bodies is back.
[03:42:57.600 --> 03:43:02.600]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to Infowarsstore.com and is now

[03:43:10.600 --> 03:43:14.600]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry
[03:43:14.600 --> 03:43:18.600]  and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[03:43:18.600 --> 03:43:23.600]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility,
[03:43:23.600 --> 03:43:29.600]  increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[03:43:29.600 --> 03:43:34.600]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[03:43:34.600 --> 03:43:40.600]  but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients
[03:43:40.600 --> 03:43:41.600]  in turmeric.

[03:43:55.600 --> 03:44:00.600]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[03:44:00.600 --> 03:44:02.600]  or the GMO crops.
[03:44:02.600 --> 03:44:08.600]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[03:44:08.600 --> 03:44:11.600]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[03:44:11.600 --> 03:44:15.600]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[03:44:15.600 --> 03:44:20.600]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your sun into a feminized mutant.
[03:44:20.600 --> 03:44:21.600]  Look it up.
[03:44:21.600 --> 03:44:23.600]  Don't let them do this to your family.

[03:44:39.600 --> 03:44:42.600]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[03:44:42.600 --> 03:44:43.600]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[03:44:43.600 --> 03:44:47.600]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalists onslaught.
[03:44:47.600 --> 03:44:49.600]  Get yours today at info.workstore.com.

[03:44:52.600 --> 03:44:54.600]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[03:44:54.600 --> 03:44:55.600]  You need this filter.
[03:44:55.600 --> 03:44:56.600]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[03:44:56.600 --> 03:44:57.600]  Thought it was next week.
[03:44:57.600 --> 03:44:58.600]  I come in this morning.
[03:44:58.600 --> 03:45:01.600]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[03:45:01.600 --> 03:45:03.600]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[03:45:03.600 --> 03:45:07.600]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[03:45:07.600 --> 03:45:09.600]  Overhead shot please.
[03:45:09.600 --> 03:45:13.600]  Look how full this bottle is.
[03:45:13.600 --> 03:45:16.600]  Right to the top folks.
[03:45:16.600 --> 03:45:22.600]  Right to the top with these 95% curcumin oil.
[03:45:22.600 --> 03:45:25.600]  Again most turmeric formulas are 5%.
[03:45:25.600 --> 03:45:27.600]  Some are maybe 10.
[03:45:27.600 --> 03:45:29.600]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[03:45:29.600 --> 03:45:33.600]  This is 95%.
[03:45:33.600 --> 03:45:34.600]  Super constant.
[03:45:34.600 --> 03:45:38.600]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[03:45:38.600 --> 03:45:40.600]  It's that powerful.
[03:45:40.600 --> 03:45:41.600]  Or more.
[03:45:41.600 --> 03:45:44.600]  So they're available at info.workstore.com.

[03:46:54.700 --> 03:47:02.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:02.460 --> 03:47:04.140]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.500 --> 03:47:08.180]  I get this very easily from me.
[03:47:08.260 --> 03:47:10.380]  You're going to, it's going to click for you real fast.
[03:47:10.700 --> 03:47:15.100]  Joe Biden is the best intelligence asset they have.
[03:47:15.540 --> 03:47:17.020]  You can't get a better one.
[03:47:17.060 --> 03:47:21.300]  You can't get a better president for the intelligence community than Joe Biden.
[03:47:21.580 --> 03:47:22.460]  Do you want to know why?
[03:47:22.900 --> 03:47:23.460]  Think about it.
[03:47:23.700 --> 03:47:25.140]  He's completely controlled.
[03:47:25.420 --> 03:47:28.980]  This is a man that was a Catholic that used to be against abortion.
[03:47:29.220 --> 03:47:30.220]  Where is he at now?
[03:47:30.500 --> 03:47:34.380]  He is for cutting the body parts off of children to change their gender.
[03:47:34.780 --> 03:47:35.940]  Why is he this way?
[03:47:36.380 --> 03:47:37.780]  Because he is controlled.
[03:47:37.820 --> 03:47:38.980]  Why is he controlled?
[03:47:39.140 --> 03:47:42.740]  Because he was, he's a criminal and he's caught and they've told him,
[03:47:43.020 --> 03:47:44.180]  we'll protect you.
[03:47:44.340 --> 03:47:47.500]  We got you covered, Joe, as long as you keep going down this trail.
[03:47:47.620 --> 03:47:50.980]  So that he gets all the blame and they hide behind him.
[03:47:51.020 --> 03:47:52.580]  They don't want to get rid of Joe Biden.
[03:47:52.580 --> 03:47:53.540]  He's the best.
[03:47:53.980 --> 03:47:54.860]  Think about it like this.
[03:47:54.900 --> 03:47:58.340]  Now for the mass, the public that doesn't really pay attention to politics.
[03:47:58.580 --> 03:48:00.460]  They don't know about the Hunter Biden laptop.
[03:48:00.500 --> 03:48:04.300]  They barely, they might know about it a little bit, but they don't really know.
[03:48:04.500 --> 03:48:08.220]  They see Joe Biden, he's innocent, sweet grandpa that stumbles his words
[03:48:08.220 --> 03:48:12.740]  every now and then, likes to get ice cream and just wants to help America.
[03:48:12.780 --> 03:48:14.100]  And he wants to help Ukraine.
[03:48:14.300 --> 03:48:16.260]  That's how they see Joe Biden.
[03:48:16.500 --> 03:48:22.460]  So they want to continue to keep that image of Joe Biden for the masses
[03:48:22.460 --> 03:48:24.500]  of people that are busy in their lives.
[03:48:24.580 --> 03:48:28.820]  Every single day, busy going to work, working two to three jobs,
[03:48:29.020 --> 03:48:33.140]  taking care of their children, maybe paying attention to sports
[03:48:33.140 --> 03:48:37.260]  and just enjoying life, the great life we have as Americans.
[03:48:37.500 --> 03:48:40.860]  They are not in tune to everything about Joe Biden.
[03:48:41.180 --> 03:48:47.140]  And for that issue alone, the best president that can exist in the
[03:48:47.140 --> 03:48:52.220]  White House, especially for the intelligence community, is Joe Biden.
[03:48:52.500 --> 03:48:54.100]  They keep him looking innocent.
[03:48:54.100 --> 03:48:55.100]  They protect him.
[03:48:55.340 --> 03:48:57.820]  They allow him to stay in the White House.
[03:48:58.020 --> 03:49:01.740]  They allow him to enjoy all the glory and they cover up his
[03:49:01.740 --> 03:49:04.260]  crimes as long as he's controlled.
[03:49:04.380 --> 03:49:06.100]  He continues their foreign wars.
[03:49:06.100 --> 03:49:10.260]  He continues to advance their Marxist agenda for America.
[03:49:10.420 --> 03:49:14.260]  He's the perfect president for the left and the intelligence community.
[03:49:15.460 --> 03:49:16.300]  He really is.
[03:49:16.300 --> 03:49:20.820]  So as Donna Brazile and others admit that this is exploding Trump, as if
[03:49:20.820 --> 03:49:24.380]  they wouldn't know that would happen, what do they do as
[03:49:24.380 --> 03:49:25.780]  they get increasingly cornered?
[03:49:26.140 --> 03:49:27.020]  Here's what they've done.
[03:49:27.380 --> 03:49:29.740]  They've indicted President Trump too many times.
[03:49:30.300 --> 03:49:30.860]  Think about it.
[03:49:31.340 --> 03:49:34.540]  The more they indict him, the more they prove that all of this
[03:49:34.540 --> 03:49:38.300]  is political and all of this is a lie and people pay attention
[03:49:38.300 --> 03:49:40.340]  more and more and more.
[03:49:40.340 --> 03:49:44.700]  And the more people pay attention, they see it for exactly what it is
[03:49:44.860 --> 03:49:46.980]  and it exposes everything they're doing.
[03:49:47.260 --> 03:49:50.660]  And so the American people are rallying behind President Trump.
[03:49:50.860 --> 03:49:57.220]  Because under President Trump, we had a $1.75 gasoline in November of 2020.
[03:49:57.420 --> 03:50:02.820]  That's how much gas was in my hometown in Rome, Georgia in the election.
[03:50:02.820 --> 03:50:04.700]  And you talked about this earlier.
[03:50:05.220 --> 03:50:08.940]  We saw double black folks voting for Trump, usually 10% but Republican
[03:50:08.940 --> 03:50:12.900]  like 20, 30%, depending on the demographic, males, females.
[03:50:13.300 --> 03:50:15.660]  Now it's just everywhere.
[03:50:15.660 --> 03:50:19.060]  All the big rappers, all the big people going against the system.
[03:50:19.420 --> 03:50:22.060]  They get it and it's viral everywhere.
[03:50:22.340 --> 03:50:23.380]  You live in Georgia.
[03:50:23.740 --> 03:50:25.620]  I mean, it looks like they're losing the black vote.
[03:50:25.620 --> 03:50:26.940]  I think Trump gets 50% now.
[03:50:27.100 --> 03:50:31.500]  I think he will, but we have to pay attention to absentee ballot voter fraud.
[03:50:31.740 --> 03:50:33.300]  Look at the case in Mississippi.
[03:50:33.540 --> 03:50:35.100]  There's a Democrat in Mississippi.
[03:50:35.100 --> 03:50:36.500]  Oh, I meant to play that video.
[03:50:36.500 --> 03:50:37.220]  Explain that to people.
[03:50:37.220 --> 03:50:38.940]  Yeah, so there's a Democrat in Mississippi.
[03:50:38.940 --> 03:50:40.060]  He has the text messages.
[03:50:40.180 --> 03:50:44.180]  He has the proof, the absolute proof that his election was
[03:50:44.180 --> 03:50:46.580]  stolen with absentee ballot fraud.
[03:50:46.740 --> 03:50:50.300]  They were, they were coming in with thumb drives for the election machines.
[03:50:50.620 --> 03:50:55.300]  They stole the election from him and he has the proof of it and he
[03:50:55.300 --> 03:50:57.020]  is yelling and screaming about it.
[03:50:57.020 --> 03:50:59.580]  And we've known this is how they've always done it.
[03:50:59.780 --> 03:51:01.820]  It has always been an issue.
[03:51:02.060 --> 03:51:07.420]  Elections get stolen and Democrats even steal them from other Democrats.
[03:51:07.420 --> 03:51:10.020]  It's not just Republicans they steal elections from.
[03:51:10.180 --> 03:51:12.580]  It's absolutely against other Democrats.
[03:51:12.740 --> 03:51:14.740]  Look at what happened to Bernie Sanders.
[03:51:14.900 --> 03:51:17.860]  Hillary Clinton stole that election from Bernie Sanders.
[03:51:18.060 --> 03:51:21.980]  So for president Trump to say my election was stolen, regular people
[03:51:21.980 --> 03:51:23.620]  are like, hell yeah, it was.
[03:51:23.780 --> 03:51:26.740]  Because everybody knows that we voted and elected him.
[03:51:26.740 --> 03:51:27.060]  Exactly.
[03:51:27.060 --> 03:51:29.780]  I'm not like a leftist that will overstate our position.
[03:51:30.340 --> 03:51:32.380]  I'm seeing explosive awakening.
[03:51:32.380 --> 03:51:36.620]  Like you think of any prominent talk show or figure, whether it's James
[03:51:36.620 --> 03:51:41.180]  Woods or Joe Rogan or Russell Brand or Tulsi Gabbards or RFK Jr.
[03:51:41.500 --> 03:51:44.020]  Or people like Jimmy Dore.
[03:51:44.180 --> 03:51:45.820]  They're all Trump's great.
[03:51:45.820 --> 03:51:46.660]  Newer loaders bad.
[03:51:46.660 --> 03:51:47.460]  The globalists are evil.
[03:51:47.460 --> 03:51:49.020]  We're going to screw the Democrats.
[03:51:49.260 --> 03:51:51.900]  I mean, they've got hardcore liberals joining Trump.
[03:51:52.180 --> 03:51:53.500]  This is huge.
[03:51:53.620 --> 03:51:54.740]  It is huge.
[03:51:55.180 --> 03:51:58.420]  But there's a lot of things that are happening that, you know, we
[03:51:58.420 --> 03:52:00.140]  don't talk about a lot on the news.
[03:52:00.140 --> 03:52:01.420]  You've got five minutes left.
[03:52:01.500 --> 03:52:02.180]  You're awesome.
[03:52:02.180 --> 03:52:02.700]  You've got the floor.
[03:52:02.900 --> 03:52:04.260]  I want to address that camera right there.
[03:52:04.260 --> 03:52:04.700]  You tell them.
[03:52:04.900 --> 03:52:05.220]  Okay.
[03:52:05.220 --> 03:52:05.660]  I'd love it.
[03:52:05.660 --> 03:52:06.460]  You're hosting right now.
[03:52:06.500 --> 03:52:07.300]  Okay, great.
[03:52:07.540 --> 03:52:08.220]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:52:08.220 --> 03:52:08.780]  I do want to explain.
[03:52:08.780 --> 03:52:09.620]  Oh, thank you for being there.
[03:52:09.620 --> 03:52:10.100]  Oh my God.
[03:52:10.740 --> 03:52:13.780]  So here's something that I think is a major issue.
[03:52:13.780 --> 03:52:15.740]  So the Friday jobs report comes out.
[03:52:16.060 --> 03:52:18.420]  1.2 million American.
[03:52:18.420 --> 03:52:19.460]  We have those graphics guys.
[03:52:19.460 --> 03:52:19.940]  Put them on screen.
[03:52:19.940 --> 03:52:20.340]  Start over.
[03:52:20.500 --> 03:52:23.860]  1.2 million Americans lost their jobs.
[03:52:23.860 --> 03:52:25.940]  That was on Friday's jobs report.
[03:52:26.220 --> 03:52:31.900]  But at the same time, over 600,000 foreigners, people from other
[03:52:31.900 --> 03:52:34.100]  countries gained American jobs.
[03:52:34.340 --> 03:52:35.940]  So put that into perspective.
[03:52:36.580 --> 03:52:41.740]  1.2 million Americans lost their jobs, but we imported foreign
[03:52:41.740 --> 03:52:44.260]  workers and gave them American jobs.
[03:52:44.260 --> 03:52:47.900]  And I want to talk about that, Alex, because this is what I see at home
[03:52:47.900 --> 03:52:51.460]  in my district, but it's happening all over the country and talk about it.
[03:52:51.460 --> 03:52:53.620]  I'm going to go control room and I'm going to put these graphs on screen.
[03:52:53.620 --> 03:52:54.140]  Go keep going.
[03:52:54.140 --> 03:52:54.420]  Okay.
[03:52:54.860 --> 03:53:00.220]  So tax credits, we see state governments, we see county governments, but we see
[03:53:00.220 --> 03:53:01.940]  federal, the federal government as well.
[03:53:01.940 --> 03:53:05.820]  And the Biden administration has done this extensively, especially
[03:53:06.060 --> 03:53:07.540]  because of the Green New Deal.
[03:53:07.740 --> 03:53:12.540]  They've given tax credits and given a lot of your hard-earned tax dollars
[03:53:12.780 --> 03:53:18.660]  to these foreign countries' businesses to bring them in to give Americans jobs.
[03:53:18.660 --> 03:53:20.980]  So let me explain the danger of that for you.
[03:53:21.260 --> 03:53:25.700]  So for example, you'll see maybe a battery company because
[03:53:25.700 --> 03:53:27.460]  of course they love green energy.
[03:53:27.780 --> 03:53:29.780]  And they'll pay the battery company.
[03:53:29.780 --> 03:53:32.660]  They'll pay them by giving them free land.
[03:53:32.660 --> 03:53:37.780]  They'll give them tax credits to move in and build their site,
[03:53:37.780 --> 03:53:39.740]  build their manufacturing plant.
[03:53:40.020 --> 03:53:43.740]  They'll bring them in and they'll help them get completely set up.
[03:53:43.940 --> 03:53:45.820]  They'll even spend money.
[03:53:45.820 --> 03:53:49.460]  Like in Georgia, they have a job training program that they will
[03:53:49.460 --> 03:53:54.420]  train workers for these companies that they bring into Georgia.
[03:53:54.580 --> 03:53:58.860]  So that's paid for by Georgia taxpayers, which is so insulting.
[03:53:58.860 --> 03:54:00.420]  And here's why it's insulting.
[03:54:00.860 --> 03:54:04.980]  When a foreign country's business gets to move in to say my state or my
[03:54:04.980 --> 03:54:09.060]  district or your state or somewhere around where you live, and they get
[03:54:09.060 --> 03:54:13.100]  the help from the federal government and the state government to move there
[03:54:13.100 --> 03:54:17.380]  with tax dollars, they are directly competing with the existing
[03:54:17.380 --> 03:54:18.980]  businesses that are already there.
[03:54:19.140 --> 03:54:20.660]  And here's how they're competing.
[03:54:20.820 --> 03:54:22.740]  We have a worker shortage in America.
[03:54:22.860 --> 03:54:25.420]  We don't have enough workers on every level.
[03:54:25.500 --> 03:54:29.620]  That goes from doctors, pilots, nurses, construction workers,
[03:54:29.620 --> 03:54:33.420]  plumbers, linemen, you name it, truck drivers.
[03:54:33.420 --> 03:54:35.540]  We do not have enough workers in America.
[03:54:35.860 --> 03:54:39.500]  So our government pays these foreign countries to bring their
[03:54:39.500 --> 03:54:42.220]  businesses into our country.
[03:54:42.380 --> 03:54:46.100]  And then these, these foreign country businesses get set up and
[03:54:46.100 --> 03:54:50.940]  they, they steal workers away from the existing American companies.
[03:54:51.380 --> 03:54:53.860]  That is the big problem that's happening right now.
[03:54:54.020 --> 03:54:58.180]  So we're seeing job reports where we're seeing 1.2 million
[03:54:58.180 --> 03:55:00.420]  Americans lose their jobs.
[03:55:00.420 --> 03:55:00.740]  Why?
[03:55:00.740 --> 03:55:02.060]  Because of Bidenomics.
[03:55:02.260 --> 03:55:04.500]  Bidenomics is destroying our economy.
[03:55:04.620 --> 03:55:06.420]  It's destroying small businesses.
[03:55:06.580 --> 03:55:09.980]  It's destroying many ways for people to keep up.
[03:55:10.220 --> 03:55:15.500]  And so you see these American companies failing and faltering and
[03:55:15.500 --> 03:55:17.140]  Americans are losing their jobs.
[03:55:17.140 --> 03:55:17.700]  But guess what?
[03:55:17.700 --> 03:55:19.660]  It's because of an unfair playing field.
[03:55:19.740 --> 03:55:20.420]  That's right.
[03:55:20.660 --> 03:55:22.220]  But think about how bad it is.
[03:55:22.220 --> 03:55:25.340]  So I have the, um, the flooring industry in Dalton, Georgia.
[03:55:25.660 --> 03:55:26.660]  It is a massive.
[03:55:26.660 --> 03:55:29.300]  By the way, you're not talking out of your patootie here.
[03:55:29.300 --> 03:55:30.980]  You're a very successful business lady.
[03:55:30.980 --> 03:55:31.420]  You're all right.
[03:55:31.700 --> 03:55:32.220]  That's right.
[03:55:32.220 --> 03:55:34.540]  I've run a construction company for over 25 years.
[03:55:34.540 --> 03:55:36.020]  I've been in business for a long time.
[03:55:36.540 --> 03:55:37.420]  Here's what's happening.
[03:55:37.420 --> 03:55:39.940]  So we have these massive, uh, flooring companies.
[03:55:39.940 --> 03:55:42.380]  I'm talking about the, some of the biggest in the
[03:55:42.380 --> 03:55:44.100]  world are in Dalton, Georgia.
[03:55:44.340 --> 03:55:49.220]  Well, we have Joe Biden bragging because he funded a solar panel,
[03:55:49.420 --> 03:55:52.740]  a company to be able to expand and build another manufacturing plant.
[03:55:52.940 --> 03:55:56.180]  And he's, they've also funded other companies to move into my district.
[03:55:56.180 --> 03:55:57.140]  Well, guess what's happening.
[03:55:57.460 --> 03:56:01.140]  This, this battery production plant, the solar, these are, I
[03:56:01.140 --> 03:56:04.020]  haven't sold their brainwashing employees into communism at the meetings.
[03:56:04.060 --> 03:56:05.580]  Well, let me tell you what they do.
[03:56:05.900 --> 03:56:07.780]  They, there aren't enough workers.
[03:56:07.980 --> 03:56:09.460]  There aren't enough workers, Alex.
[03:56:09.700 --> 03:56:13.660]  So they are stealing workers from the flooring companies,
[03:56:13.740 --> 03:56:15.100]  uh, manufacturing plants.
[03:56:15.300 --> 03:56:17.780]  They're stealing workers from other companies.
[03:56:17.980 --> 03:56:20.500]  And, and, and they, no one can keep workers.
[03:56:20.940 --> 03:56:22.060]  Their people are just, aren't there.
[03:56:22.060 --> 03:56:22.980]  So you know what they're doing?
[03:56:23.380 --> 03:56:25.980]  They're importing them from overseas.
[03:56:26.180 --> 03:56:31.060]  So in my district, they're bringing in thousands of foreign workers
[03:56:31.260 --> 03:56:32.780]  because they don't have enough workers.
[03:56:32.780 --> 03:56:33.620]  We're out of time.
[03:56:33.620 --> 03:56:36.020]  Anytime you want the show, you can host it or take over.
[03:56:36.220 --> 03:56:37.060]  You are awesome.
[03:56:37.060 --> 03:56:38.540]  In closing, what do we do about this?
[03:56:38.780 --> 03:56:41.220]  What we do about it is we have to fight like hell to
[03:56:41.220 --> 03:56:43.100]  fight for America first policies.
[03:56:43.260 --> 03:56:45.300]  We get president Trump back in the white house.
[03:56:45.460 --> 03:56:48.260]  You guys go to impeachment team.com.
[03:56:48.260 --> 03:56:49.660]  We're going to impeach Joe Biden.
[03:56:49.860 --> 03:56:52.940]  And we're going to, we are going to painfully, painfully
[03:56:52.940 --> 03:56:54.100]  make him go through this.
[03:56:54.100 --> 03:56:55.260]  And that's why they're so scared.
[03:56:55.260 --> 03:56:57.900]  Cause administratively, legally, we can end all this very quickly.
[03:56:59.940 --> 03:57:01.100]  Could we end it right now?
[03:57:01.420 --> 03:57:02.660]  No, but we had Trump in.
[03:57:02.780 --> 03:57:05.020]  Oh, if we had Trump in, none of this would be happening.
[03:57:05.100 --> 03:57:06.100]  That's why we want him back.
[03:57:06.140 --> 03:57:07.220]  What an amazing time.
[03:57:07.220 --> 03:57:12.820]  Thank you for coming in studio and spending part of your weekend with us.
[03:57:12.820 --> 03:57:15.380]  We can't wait till you're back in Congress in a week or so.
[03:57:15.380 --> 03:57:16.500]  Can't wait to get dinner with you.
[03:57:16.940 --> 03:57:19.700]  And just the great folks from Right Side Broadcasting are here.
[03:57:19.980 --> 03:57:21.460]  So we are really excited.
[03:57:21.460 --> 03:57:23.220]  MTG, what other websites people should visit?
[03:57:23.500 --> 03:57:28.180]  Oh, you can go to MTGforAmerica.com, MTGforAmerica.com.
[03:57:28.180 --> 03:57:29.500]  I always appreciate your help.
[03:57:29.540 --> 03:57:29.940]  Thank you.
[03:57:30.140 --> 03:57:34.780]  MTG is our future president and she is the lady we needed back.
[03:57:35.420 --> 03:57:38.620]  Owen Schroyer takes over in two minutes with Sunday Night Live.
[03:57:38.620 --> 03:57:39.220]  Spread the word.
[03:57:39.220 --> 03:57:39.700]  We love you.
[03:57:39.900 --> 03:57:41.300]  MTG, thank you so much.
[03:57:41.300 --> 03:57:41.780]  Thank you.
[03:57:43.820 --> 03:57:54.260]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[03:57:54.900 --> 03:58:00.100]  They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[03:58:00.380 --> 03:58:05.980]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega-3s.
[03:58:06.700 --> 03:58:10.900]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[03:58:11.580 --> 03:58:18.020]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at Infowarsstore.com.

[03:58:46.980 --> 03:58:50.140]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[03:58:50.460 --> 03:58:51.700]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:58:52.380 --> 03:58:55.620]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:58:56.420 --> 03:59:04.500]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:59:05.220 --> 03:59:11.260]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:59:12.100 --> 03:59:13.140]  It's really just incredible.
[03:59:14.060 --> 03:59:17.020]  So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:59:17.700 --> 03:59:22.820]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:59:23.500 --> 03:59:26.500]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:59:26.540 --> 03:59:33.220]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:59:33.620 --> 03:59:34.940]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:59:35.500 --> 03:59:39.180]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:59:39.740 --> 03:59:44.460]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:59:44.740 --> 03:59:45.620]  Please take action now.
[03:59:47.900 --> 03:59:54.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
