[00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:17.077]  The left-wing lunatics are trying very hard to bring back COVID lockdowns and mandates with all of their sudden fear-mongering about the new variants that are coming.
[00:00:17.077 --> 00:00:24.721]  But to every COVID tyrant who wants to take away our freedom, hear these words, we will not comply.
[00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:25.422]  California
[00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:28.293]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got a call yesterday.
[00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:30.435]  An individual was in town and they are a high-level manager
[00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.369]  What?
[00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:27.290]  People who have had the vaccine are more susceptible to B.A.2.A6.
[00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.472]  What the actual s***?
[00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:38.018]  But I was sent by the whistleblower a link to the California website and it says the controls are back and here they are right there in black and white.
[00:01:38.658 --> 00:01:39.819]  They're going to roll them out.
[00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:52.084]  And through the institutions, through the corporations, through the hospitals, through the hotels, through the colleges, through the public schools, all over the country, they are shutting down public schools if there's one COVID case.
[00:01:52.084 --> 00:01:55.806]  That's creating the lockdown by sending the children back home.
[00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:57.307]  That's the beginning of it.
[00:01:57.307 --> 00:02:05.211]  My sources, because I called around and confirmed what the first source said, said middle of September, Biden is set to start the rollout.
[00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:07.492]  Now, five, six days later,
[00:02:20.086 --> 00:02:29.269]  Joe Biden literally saying, y'all need to come, they need to come up with a new vaccine and they need to come up with a way that people have to take it no matter what.
[00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.170]  I'm willing to die about my freedom.
[00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.931]  I'm willing to die about my medical independence.
[00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:37.972]  So all I got to say to you in that video, try this.
[00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:40.112]  Go around and find out.
[00:02:40.112 --> 00:02:44.733]  The FDA and CDC, they've made an announcement on the new vaccine.
[00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:50.955]  So certainly, they said that they will have an updated vaccine in September, mid-September.
[00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:52.695]  There never was a COVID pandemic.
[00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:55.335]  There never was a SARS-CoV-2 novel virus.
[00:02:55.335 --> 00:02:56.636]  There was never any of those things.
[00:02:56.636 --> 00:03:06.098]  This was a behavior modification exercise to fulfill the objective of the financial interests that were being served.
[00:03:06.098 --> 00:03:06.898]  And let's remember,
[00:03:08.203 --> 00:03:21.271]  That the quote, until a pandemic is at emergency threshold, the public doesn't understand the need for medical countermeasures such as a pan-coronavirus or pan-influenced vaccine.
[00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:23.453]  We need the media to create the hype.
[00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:27.597]  We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues.
[00:03:27.597 --> 00:03:31.300]  Investors will follow if they see profit at the end of the process.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.682]  That's a quote from Peter Daszak.
[00:03:32.682 --> 00:03:38.628]  That's a quote that was made at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, published in 2015.
[00:03:38.628 --> 00:03:41.571]  This is the admission of terrorism again.
[00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:43.352]  Now, what did I say they were told?
[00:03:44.144 --> 00:03:47.125]  The beginning of the announcements begin September 15th.
[00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:54.649]  This was just the warming up and getting ready that just so happened to begin right after I announced it literally six hours later.
[00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:55.169]  Everywhere.
[00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:01.472]  They just opened up on the public, every controlled corporate outlet, and then the institutions to create the fear.
[00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:04.953]  You can stop all flights.
[00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:08.095]  You can lock down entire countries.
[00:04:08.095 --> 00:04:10.336]  You can actually do that.
[00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:20.601]  And this, I would say, may make us more open to radical ideas about how to deal also with climate change.
[00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:23.442]  This has nothing to do with public health.
[00:04:23.442 --> 00:04:26.344]  It has nothing to do with breaking any waves.
[00:04:26.344 --> 00:04:28.885]  It was always about breaking people.
[00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:30.326]  There's a path of resistance.
[00:04:31.311 --> 00:04:35.134]  Or there is the path of total enslavement.
[00:04:35.134 --> 00:04:36.315]  Come on!
[00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:39.738]  Your ancestors were stronger than this.
[00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.619]  You're stronger than this.
[00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:45.562]  You can focus on the New World Order and its activities.
[00:04:45.562 --> 00:04:51.927]  And you can ask God to lead, guide, and direct you with discernment.
[00:04:51.927 --> 00:04:54.950]  And you do that, we're unstoppable together.
[00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:02.483]  It's just a mask.
[00:05:02.483 --> 00:05:04.305]  It's just six feet.
[00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:06.867]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[00:05:06.867 --> 00:05:09.289]  It's just non-essential workers.
[00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.851]  It's just until we work it out.
[00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:13.352]  It's just a bar.
[00:05:13.352 --> 00:05:15.534]  It's just a restaurant.
[00:05:15.534 --> 00:05:17.435]  It's just nursing homes.
[00:05:17.435 --> 00:05:19.297]  It's just schools.
[00:05:19.297 --> 00:05:22.599]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.361]  It's just until the cases go down.
[00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:27.402]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[00:05:27.402 --> 00:05:30.222]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:32.683]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:37.264]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[00:05:37.264 --> 00:05:39.724]  It's just churches and mosques.
[00:05:39.724 --> 00:05:41.405]  It's just singing.
[00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:44.106]  It's just travel.
[00:05:44.106 --> 00:05:45.786]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[00:05:46.566 --> 00:05:48.507]  It's just for the greater good.
[00:05:48.507 --> 00:05:50.769]  It's just fact-checking.
[00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:52.430]  Not censorship.
[00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.371]  It's just mandatory.
[00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:56.252]  It isn't just at all.
[00:05:56.252 --> 00:05:59.634]  Visit DefendJones.com to help fight back today.
[00:05:59.634 --> 00:06:13.482]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:06:13.482 --> 00:06:14.663]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:06:16.244 --> 00:06:24.071]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:31.577]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:06:31.577 --> 00:06:41.846]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[00:06:42.666 --> 00:06:48.771]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:58.038]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:06:58.038 --> 00:07:01.740]  It is 11, 12 Central Standard Time.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.303]  We are coming to you from the Austin, Texas studios of InfoWars.
[00:07:05.303 --> 00:07:06.244]  It is Saturday.
[00:07:07.512 --> 00:07:10.074]  September 2nd, 2023.
[00:07:10.074 --> 00:07:17.580]  And for the next 45 minutes, General Flynn, one of the leading minds in the fight against the globalists, is joining us.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:31.451]  And then Joe Biggs is scheduled, if he can get through from prison, true political prisoner, to be joining us as well after he was sentenced to 17 years in prison two days ago for committing absolutely no crime.
[00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.612]  And then I will continue on after he leaves, getting into the ADL.
[00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:40.974]  And the censorship combine and how they play a key role as a multinational intelligence agency against the American people.
[00:07:40.974 --> 00:07:41.955]  I have a large stack.
[00:07:41.955 --> 00:07:44.138]  They directly are working for the UN.
[00:07:44.138 --> 00:07:44.979]  We'll be laying that out.
[00:07:46.547 --> 00:07:50.449]  General Flynn's a busy guy, he's a hard guy to get on, but I begged him a few days ago.
[00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:53.330]  I said, I really think they're going to pull a false flag of some type.
[00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.131]  I see them pre-programming it in the news.
[00:07:56.131 --> 00:08:02.073]  I really need your expertise as the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and Trump's chief national security advisor.
[00:08:02.073 --> 00:08:06.995]  Do you really have over-the-horizon understanding, unlike probably anybody else out there that's on our team?
[00:08:06.995 --> 00:08:08.596]  The enemy knows what's going on because they're planning it.
[00:08:09.116 --> 00:08:14.017]  Please come on and give us your views on that, on the lay of the land politically.
[00:08:14.017 --> 00:08:15.118]  There is a big awakening.
[00:08:15.118 --> 00:08:18.499]  People are figuring out this is a permanent coup happening.
[00:08:18.499 --> 00:08:20.960]  Our enemies are in deep trouble at every level.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:28.662]  The indictments have backfired that they launched against Trump, but I don't think we should be too confident and we should talk about tomorrow's news today.
[00:08:29.622 --> 00:08:30.623]  So we can get ahead of it.
[00:08:30.623 --> 00:08:41.595]  And a sterling example of this is 15 days ago, I went on air and told you that I talked to a high-level TSA manager who said they were told on the 15th they would start rolling everything out of September.
[00:08:41.595 --> 00:08:45.339]  A week later, they began to roll it out just like we basically said.
[00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:47.961]  Here is the New York Times.
[00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:51.845]  New Yorkers told to mask up for Labor Day as new COVID variant sparks fears.
[00:08:52.486 --> 00:08:56.150]  They're going to have drones watching people in New York with the borders wide open.
[00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.893]  All these universities and high schools have been saying you got to have shots to go there.
[00:08:59.893 --> 00:09:01.755]  They've been closing for a week.
[00:09:01.755 --> 00:09:03.216]  They're trying to bring the masking back.
[00:09:03.216 --> 00:09:05.178]  So we got ahead of that though.
[00:09:05.178 --> 00:09:11.064]  So there's massive political opposition by senators and governors and so many people.
[00:09:11.064 --> 00:09:12.966]  We're not going to just accept their incremental rollout.
[00:09:12.966 --> 00:09:14.367]  So just like we got ahead of that,
[00:09:15.248 --> 00:09:20.249]  We need to get ahead and do our best thinking on, if you're a globalist, what are you going to do?
[00:09:20.249 --> 00:09:22.349]  You've got to get in their mind.
[00:09:22.349 --> 00:09:26.290]  And General Flynn is the expert to be able to give us that information.
[00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.130]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice.
[00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.191]  I'm going to try as much as I can to give him the floor.
[00:09:31.191 --> 00:09:33.631]  I said, I'm going to get your briefing, sir, what you think of the people.
[00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:36.412]  He said, well, I'd like to hear yours as well.
[00:09:36.412 --> 00:09:41.633]  So after he's done talking for a while, I'll kind of give a brief synopsis of what I think their next moves will probably be.
[00:09:42.293 --> 00:09:45.836]  Again, because I see the pre-programming, GeneralFlynn.com.
[00:09:45.836 --> 00:09:48.098]  He has an amazing new book, How to Fight AI.
[00:09:48.098 --> 00:09:49.899]  Find it all at GeneralFlynn.com.
[00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:53.762]  He also has shared this on Twitter and a bunch of other publications.
[00:09:53.762 --> 00:10:01.027]  So everybody else watching, you can force multiply this, show that not just to say a half million people are tuned in right now conservatively.
[00:10:01.027 --> 00:10:03.429]  And then this will be posted later as an archived video.
[00:10:03.429 --> 00:10:04.450]  A million or so will watch it.
[00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.552]  I'll air it on the main show next week.
[00:10:06.552 --> 00:10:08.094]  Three or four million will see it.
[00:10:08.094 --> 00:10:24.373]  But when listeners get excited, like you did two weeks ago on the TSA lockdown 2.0 story, we take full control of the narrative and the enemy can't have that because now they're having to counter us instead of incrementally rolling out their brainwashing and
[00:10:25.294 --> 00:10:27.935]  Alex, thanks so much for having me, and this is a really important day.
[00:10:46.576 --> 00:11:00.007]  I love the way that you come on these weekend shows particularly, and I know you run these during the course of the week, but these weekend shows are really important because it gives people that are working their tails off, that don't have that kind of time to be able to
[00:11:00.603 --> 00:11:06.887]  To listen to the depth that they should be, and ability to be able to hear some things on these shows.
[00:11:06.887 --> 00:11:08.788]  So this is super important.
[00:11:08.788 --> 00:11:10.910]  And let me just lay out a few things.
[00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:15.073]  And number one, I'm going to just state the obvious enemies that we have.
[00:11:15.073 --> 00:11:20.656]  And then I'm going to go into those that are not so obvious, but we've been talking about.
[00:11:20.656 --> 00:11:21.737]  I've certainly been talking about it.
[00:11:21.737 --> 00:11:24.319]  You've been talking about it for, geez, maybe a decade.
[00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:27.681]  I certainly have been talking about it for the last few years, four or five years.
[00:11:28.402 --> 00:11:33.105]  But the obvious ones are, and I'll start right off the top with China, right?
[00:11:33.105 --> 00:11:33.565]  China.
[00:11:33.565 --> 00:11:38.608]  China has infiltrated into every single institution in the United States of America.
[00:11:38.608 --> 00:11:39.688]  Government, U.S.
[00:11:39.688 --> 00:11:47.012]  government institutions, our entirety of our education system, especially our graduate and undergraduate programs.
[00:11:47.012 --> 00:11:53.796]  I mean, they've been coming into our colleges and universities for well over 25 years to the tune of
[00:11:54.356 --> 00:12:06.566]  Minimum of about 100,000 a year, as high as 500,000 students a year, and they basically are attending some of the most elite universities that we have in this country.
[00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:09.509]  They are also in the institution of Hollywood, right?
[00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:15.814]  The movie making, the culturalization community, I call it, the culturalization community of America.
[00:12:16.824 --> 00:12:21.129]  The Chinese have gotten deep, deep into that, and they've been in that for a long, long time.
[00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:25.795]  And then they're also in the institutions of the cartels, right?
[00:12:25.795 --> 00:12:28.919]  And I would call them the sort of on-the-street
[00:12:32.134 --> 00:12:46.317]  You know, teamed together where the Chinese have teamed together with the cartels and we know that that's a fact because they're already, we already have over 100,000 killed in action by fentanyl in this country.
[00:12:46.317 --> 00:12:49.177]  So that's China, that's China, all right?
[00:12:49.177 --> 00:12:57.339]  Now let's just, and there's some other things and I'll talk to China because I'm gonna, I'm gonna jump to cyber in a second because I think cyber is something that everybody needs to
[00:12:58.394 --> 00:13:02.920]  Understand and they need to know what that means and how we are going to be affected by cyber.
[00:13:03.573 --> 00:13:10.879]  You know, because the other part about China, and I am going to talk about the health crisis that we already see being forced down our throats again.
[00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:12.700]  The second one is Russia, right?
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.884]  Russia is aligned with China as a communist ideology.
[00:13:17.884 --> 00:13:24.570]  The other element here is this BRICS, this BRICS alignment of countries, right?
[00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:28.012]  Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
[00:13:28.012 --> 00:13:28.673]  They just finished
[00:13:29.173 --> 00:13:29.954]  We're good to go.
[00:13:48.704 --> 00:14:07.049]  Energy deals, economic deals, military deals for years, for the last, you know, certainly the last 20-25 years, but in the last five to six years, I've seen them increase their portfolio of arrangements, economic to military and other arrangements,
[00:14:08.419 --> 00:14:10.160]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:19.683]  And they're purchasing, you know, the sale of oil is now going to be done not in petrodollars, meaning US dollars, it's going to be done in the currency of the countries that are purchasing it.
[00:14:33.627 --> 00:14:35.169]  The third, so Russia.
[00:14:35.169 --> 00:14:42.816]  And of course, we have Russia right now in this war in Eastern Europe, which is a total distraction.
[00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:44.638]  We, the American people, are being distracted.
[00:14:44.638 --> 00:14:46.379]  We're being ripped off.
[00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:52.545]  We're paying through our teeth over to something that we don't need to be part of.
[00:14:52.545 --> 00:14:54.407]  And frankly, it's a losing effort.
[00:14:54.407 --> 00:14:55.468]  It's a big-time loser.
[00:14:55.988 --> 00:15:02.575]  Yet the administration is going to continue to distract us with this losing war in Eastern Europe.
[00:15:02.575 --> 00:15:04.436]  So that's China, Russia.
[00:15:04.436 --> 00:15:05.758]  The third one is Iran.
[00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:17.813]  Yeah, the Iranian people, you know, I know a lot of Iranians, I have a lot of friends, but the Iranian government is still in coordination with the Democrat Party, right?
[00:15:17.813 --> 00:15:20.614]  I call it the Democrat, the Marxist Party of the left.
[00:15:20.614 --> 00:15:27.776]  So they are still negotiating and they are still going to allow Iran, we, the United States of America, are going to...
[00:15:30.635 --> 00:15:30.956]  We're good.
[00:15:59.354 --> 00:16:00.754]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[00:16:00.754 --> 00:16:01.695]  I thought it was next week.
[00:16:01.695 --> 00:16:06.115]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[00:16:06.115 --> 00:16:08.336]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:16:08.336 --> 00:16:12.176]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[00:16:12.176 --> 00:16:14.077]  Overhead shot please.
[00:16:14.077 --> 00:16:18.238]  Look how full this bottle is.
[00:16:18.238 --> 00:16:21.178]  Right to the top folks.
[00:16:21.178 --> 00:16:23.759]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoid.
[00:16:27.037 --> 00:16:29.900]  Again, most turmeric formulas are five percent.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.241]  Some are maybe ten.
[00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.923]  The other strongest brands are seventy-five percent.
[00:16:33.923 --> 00:16:37.866]  This is ninety-five percent.
[00:16:37.866 --> 00:16:38.827]  Super constant.
[00:16:38.827 --> 00:16:42.690]  So like taking one pill is like taking ten of the average pill.
[00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.172]  It's that powerful.
[00:16:44.172 --> 00:16:45.333]  Or more.
[00:16:45.333 --> 00:16:47.455]  So they're available at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:17:08.133 --> 00:17:13.615]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[00:17:13.615 --> 00:17:18.557]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:24.782]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[00:18:58.769 --> 00:19:05.152]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[00:19:05.152 --> 00:19:11.574]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[00:19:11.574 --> 00:19:14.916]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:24.080]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.540]  Look it up.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.521]  Don't let them do this to your family.

[00:19:46.717 --> 00:19:50.460]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.241]  Get yours today at InfoWorksShore.com for a limited time.

[00:19:55.702 --> 00:19:57.123]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[00:19:57.123 --> 00:20:01.865]  You need this filter.
[00:20:01.865 --> 00:20:07.768]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:11.272 --> 00:20:16.454]  North Korea is clearly aligned with China, there's no doubt about that.
[00:20:16.454 --> 00:20:18.715]  They are a nuclear power.
[00:20:18.715 --> 00:20:25.417]  They will be used, so the North will be used by China to sort of do the big head fake.
[00:20:25.417 --> 00:20:36.882]  So if we start to see Kim Jong-un of North Korea start to conduct things, do things over there, you know, in his sphere of the world, what we call the Near East,
[00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:49.562]  If he starts to do things over in the Near East, where he starts to fire missiles, test missiles again, you know, maybe test a space launch, which they have done in the past, then we're going to start to see other movements.
[00:20:49.562 --> 00:20:58.371]  And we're going to have to be very, we're going to have to, you know, our country should be able to juggle more, more balls at the same time, multiple balls at the same time.
[00:20:58.371 --> 00:20:59.913]  But under this administration, we
[00:21:00.433 --> 00:21:02.797]  We are incapable of doing that right now.
[00:21:02.797 --> 00:21:07.043]  But so Iran is the is there or North Korea is the fourth country.
[00:21:07.043 --> 00:21:09.767]  So China, Russia, Iran, North Korea.
[00:21:09.767 --> 00:21:12.011]  And then you have these other crises, right?
[00:21:12.011 --> 00:21:15.856]  The border crisis, the narcotics crisis that I mentioned about fentanyl.
[00:21:16.437 --> 00:21:19.999]  The rise of domestic crime in this country.
[00:21:19.999 --> 00:21:20.699]  Venezuela.
[00:21:20.699 --> 00:21:34.527]  I mentioned Venezuela in a way because what is happening, as we've seen the Chinese starting to come across the border, and we recently saw Uzbeks, a group of Uzbeks, and Uzbeks are
[00:21:35.459 --> 00:21:39.424]  A strong member of ISIS and a strong member of Al Qaeda.
[00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:44.529]  And so we just had a group of Uzbeks cross the border down in the southern border.
[00:21:44.529 --> 00:21:54.521]  And what's happening with Venezuela is Venezuela is being used as a conduit, being used as a conduit for some of these other nations around the world that aren't in this hemisphere.
[00:21:55.484 --> 00:22:09.291]  So you're going to see Chinese where we have we have seen an awful lot of Chinese to the tune of about a thousand a day coming up through that what's called the Darien Gap down in between Columbia and Panama and making their way up to the to the US border.
[00:22:09.291 --> 00:22:13.553]  And thanks to Michael, Jan and others I know you're working closely with and thinking about going down there, both of us.
[00:22:14.173 --> 00:22:15.715]  I mean, he has the footage.
[00:22:15.715 --> 00:22:17.156]  They built a giant U.N.
[00:22:17.156 --> 00:22:18.958]  base down there in the Aryan Gap.
[00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:21.581]  And these are mainly military-age men, Chinese.
[00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:25.485]  I mean, I can tell by the look of them, they look military to me, most of them.
[00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:35.474]  These are military age men, of course they are, and China doesn't just... and the good reporting by Michael as an example, when he starts to ask questions like, where did they come from?
[00:22:35.474 --> 00:22:37.094]  These guys are coming from China.
[00:22:37.094 --> 00:22:43.917]  The Chinese do not let refugees leave their country except for a specific purpose.
[00:22:43.917 --> 00:22:53.321]  So we also have these other border, along our border, along the US border, these border posts, these military camps that have been built
[00:22:54.065 --> 00:22:57.708]  Along our own border.
[00:22:57.708 --> 00:22:58.309]  I've seen a couple.
[00:22:58.309 --> 00:22:59.270]  I've been to one of them.
[00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.890]  I've seen these.
[00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.752]  These are huge, huge camps.
[00:23:01.752 --> 00:23:05.055]  And these aren't camps for a couple of kids.
[00:23:05.055 --> 00:23:05.896]  These are camps.
[00:23:05.896 --> 00:23:07.798]  These are large, large camps.
[00:23:07.798 --> 00:23:13.123]  And they are housing thousands and thousands, primarily military-age men.
[00:23:13.123 --> 00:23:15.104]  And then you have to start to think about where they're going.
[00:23:16.326 --> 00:23:35.074]  So Venezuela, I mention Venezuela because Venezuela has not only given up their prisoners and their psychopaths, but they're also acting as a conduit to pass through Iranians, to pass through Uzbeks, to pass through Chinese and get them on up into the Central American isthmus there and head on up to the United States.
[00:23:35.074 --> 00:23:38.856]  The other two areas that I wrote down here is financial and economic.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:50.532]  And I think that this is where I want to, you know, go back up to like the 60,000 foot level and really clearly identify the enemy, right?
[00:23:50.532 --> 00:23:52.334]  And again, I think it repeats.
[00:23:53.217 --> 00:23:54.418]  Pounding this, right?
[00:23:54.418 --> 00:24:01.481]  We have to pound this into our audience, we've got to pound it into American psyche, because the enemy is real.
[00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:12.066]  And when we talk about sort of an enemy headquarters, it's Davos, Switzerland, and the name of the organization is the World Economic Forum, and the name of the leader is Claude Schwab.
[00:24:12.066 --> 00:24:21.710]  And then there, like he says, he says there's about, you know, there's about 600 of the smartest people in the world, you know, in his very, very arrogant sort of way.
[00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:32.133]  But there are actually a couple of thousand that are part of this organization, and these thousand, a couple of thousand, are sprinkled all over the world in various governments.
[00:24:32.133 --> 00:24:33.534]  Some of them are running governments.
[00:24:33.534 --> 00:24:38.555]  Trudeau is one up in Canada, members of his cabinet, members of his government.
[00:24:38.555 --> 00:24:40.296]  Same with France, Macron.
[00:24:40.296 --> 00:24:42.877]  And there are other members of the World Economic Forum
[00:24:43.497 --> 00:24:57.828]  That are running not only governments and are parts of the bureaucracies and systems of many of these governments around the world, Australia is another, the United States is another, but there's also corporations.
[00:24:57.828 --> 00:25:01.111]  There's corporations that are members of the World Economic Forum.
[00:25:01.111 --> 00:25:10.398]  So when we hear about all this corporate wokeness, since 1972 essentially, there has been this organizing effect
[00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:16.016]  To basically culturalize the world, get the world ready to be globalized.
[00:25:16.016 --> 00:25:18.920]  And these guys are no longer hiding it.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:27.150]  So now what we're seeing, and this is going to happen financially, it's going to happen in the economic system, and we are going to see things.
[00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.472]  Yeah, you go great reset.
[00:25:28.472 --> 00:25:29.714]  We're going to see things.
[00:25:30.402 --> 00:25:37.589]  Like another health crisis discussion, even though in this country, you know, like, you know, we're going to start, you know, we'll start to hear more.
[00:25:37.589 --> 00:25:38.790]  We will not comply.
[00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:38.950]  Right.
[00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.432]  Well, I got all that.
[00:25:40.432 --> 00:25:42.914]  And we should not comply with any of this nonsense.
[00:25:42.914 --> 00:25:46.518]  But I'm starting to see things like malaria.
[00:25:46.518 --> 00:25:49.521]  You know, I pay very close attention to these indicators.
[00:25:50.262 --> 00:25:56.105]  So in the health crisis in this country, which is going to strain the financial and economic system, and they're going to take advantage of it.
[00:25:56.105 --> 00:26:11.912]  So this enemy force that I just laid out, and they have subordinate organizations underneath the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations, which you have always been highlighting and what they're up to.
[00:26:11.912 --> 00:26:17.195]  And that's important that we understand where the UN is at on a given day, particularly in this country.
[00:26:17.938 --> 00:26:23.402]  But we've seen cases, small anecdotal numbers right now, of malaria in this country.
[00:26:23.402 --> 00:26:30.468]  We have never seen malaria in the United States of America, yet we've got a couple of cases down here in Florida, a couple of cases up in Washington, D.C.
[00:26:30.468 --> 00:26:33.431]  I think that I just read about one out in Texas the other day.
[00:26:33.431 --> 00:26:39.175]  I mean, these are anecdotal, but when malaria hits and you're not ready for it, it can spread very quickly.
[00:26:39.175 --> 00:26:46.701]  The other one that is also a mosquito-borne type disease, and it seems like this is the Bill Gates thing, right?
[00:26:46.701 --> 00:26:47.362]  The Bill Gates
[00:26:47.902 --> 00:26:50.925]  Yeah, and so you say, you know, because the other one that's up there,
[00:27:02.031 --> 00:27:05.192]  That we talk about is the West Nile virus, the West Nile virus.
[00:27:05.192 --> 00:27:07.573]  I mean, these are deadly, these are deadly things.
[00:27:07.573 --> 00:27:12.475]  So when you see that, what you're showing right there, I mean, this is, these are not conspiracy theories.
[00:27:12.475 --> 00:27:19.378]  This isn't the bullshit that... Yeah, that's a literal black helicopter that Bill Gates funds spraying mosquitoes on Floridians.
[00:27:20.373 --> 00:27:20.914]  Yeah.
[00:27:20.914 --> 00:27:22.275]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:27:22.275 --> 00:27:30.863]  And, you know, again, I do want to... Part of what I do want to talk about in some of the time that I have is the Republican Party.
[00:27:30.863 --> 00:27:31.944]  Where's the Republican Party?
[00:27:31.944 --> 00:27:37.429]  Well, sir, you've got the floor, but let me just interject here because you're reading my mind.
[00:27:37.429 --> 00:27:39.111]  I want to, before you have to go, get into...
[00:27:40.362 --> 00:27:52.805]  I understand you're fighting for Americans, the Chai Com Power Group, the Russians, the globalists incestuously work with both, but they're undermining America, trying to demoralize us, trying to bankrupt us, destroying our cities.
[00:27:52.805 --> 00:27:59.967]  What is their... I mean, obviously, I believe you would agree the globalists are the most powerful bloc.
[00:27:59.967 --> 00:28:01.528]  Here's their ultimate goal.
[00:28:01.528 --> 00:28:02.388]  Here's their ultimate goal.
[00:28:02.388 --> 00:28:03.028]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[00:28:03.028 --> 00:28:03.728]  Here's their ultimate goal.
[00:28:03.728 --> 00:28:05.049]  No, that's exactly what I was about to ask.
[00:28:05.049 --> 00:28:06.069]  What is their goal?
[00:28:07.498 --> 00:28:14.460]  I've said this, I've said this very publicly, that their original intent was eight years of Obama, right?
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:21.702]  Steal this country, eight years of Obama, and then get Hillary Clinton in charge and have eight years of Hillary Clinton, and we would be done.
[00:28:21.702 --> 00:28:24.582]  You'd be done, I'd be done, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[00:28:24.582 --> 00:28:28.423]  So, to your audience and to the American people, that was their plan.
[00:28:28.423 --> 00:28:29.884]  Eight years of Obama?
[00:28:29.884 --> 00:28:35.525]  And if you weren't on the Obama, you know, if you didn't get on board with Obama, you didn't get on board with his team, you were out.
[00:28:36.065 --> 00:28:38.246]  You were out like I was out, you know.
[00:28:38.246 --> 00:28:46.529]  And then the next step, the next stage was a controlled political person in the name of Hillary Clinton.
[00:28:46.529 --> 00:28:48.950]  And keep her in there for another eight years.
[00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:57.533]  And we were blessed, we were blessed that Trump, this warrior, stood up and using his own resources and putting his own life on the line.
[00:28:57.533 --> 00:28:59.174]  And you, and then that helped derail.
[00:28:59.174 --> 00:29:04.416]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good news.
[00:29:05.316 --> 00:29:10.519]  Because it's a great product you love, and people want it, and it funds our operation of 360WIN.

[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.961]  The strongest you're going to find anywhere.

[00:29:21.865 --> 00:29:22.365]  You name it.

[00:29:24.386 --> 00:29:27.828]  God gave it to us, and it's the strongest curcuminoid out there.
[00:29:27.828 --> 00:29:29.429]  Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid.
[00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:35.894]  Most brands are 5% humidant, and that still does a great thing for you.
[00:29:35.894 --> 00:29:38.777]  This is the strongest anybody makes.
[00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:40.859]  95% curcuminoid.
[00:29:40.859 --> 00:29:43.421]  I am so glad this is back.
[00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:45.283]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:48.205]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[00:29:48.205 --> 00:29:50.007]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.

[00:29:59.687 --> 00:30:06.593]  Coffee has not been available at InfoWarsTore.com for two years because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[00:30:06.593 --> 00:30:10.816]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[00:30:10.816 --> 00:30:15.040]  But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was blown away.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.484]  We finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer available to you right now.
[00:30:20.484 --> 00:30:22.806]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[00:30:22.806 --> 00:30:23.807]  It smells amazing.
[00:30:24.127 --> 00:30:26.548]  And it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[00:30:26.548 --> 00:30:34.153]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single-source Colombian coffees are now available at InfoWareStore.com exclusively.
[00:30:34.153 --> 00:30:36.514]  Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast.
[00:30:36.514 --> 00:30:37.375]  Tastes great.
[00:30:37.375 --> 00:30:38.575]  It's the strong one.
[00:30:38.575 --> 00:30:39.416]  Really strong.
[00:30:39.416 --> 00:30:41.277]  But these are all close second and thirds.
[00:30:41.277 --> 00:30:42.017]  Medium Roast.
[00:30:42.017 --> 00:30:42.718]  Wake of America.
[00:30:43.038 --> 00:30:43.959]  Woo!
[00:30:43.959 --> 00:30:45.300]  That's what my go-to.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:51.006]  Dark roast, tip of the spear, tastes the best, and is amazing, and is still very, very strong, gives you that pep.
[00:30:51.006 --> 00:30:59.095]  They're all three available at InfoWarsTore.com, and they fund our operation, and each order gets a Pocket Constitution Citizen Rollback.
[00:30:59.095 --> 00:31:03.960]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God, through Mother Nature, has given us the answer.
[00:31:04.773 --> 00:31:04.933]  I don't
[00:31:27.301 --> 00:31:29.063]  Because that's who we're getting it from.
[00:31:29.063 --> 00:31:31.766]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[00:31:31.766 --> 00:31:35.410]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:41.016]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.

[00:31:43.819 --> 00:31:44.920]  And here's what's even crazier.

[00:31:50.843 --> 00:31:55.204]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.

[00:32:08.643 --> 00:32:14.984]  We could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[00:32:14.984 --> 00:32:16.064]  But now we've got it.
[00:32:16.064 --> 00:32:18.625]  30 parts per million from the top lab.
[00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:20.045]  We got a limited shipment.
[00:32:20.045 --> 00:32:21.706]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:27.767]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal,

[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:06.462]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:06.462 --> 00:33:07.763]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.712 --> 00:33:24.753]  Exactly, and there you go.
[00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:26.954]  There's the guy right there, Obama.
[00:33:26.954 --> 00:33:35.399]  There's going to be some things coming out on him in the next couple of weeks on Obama, that his relationships, the type of person that he is.
[00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:39.641]  Well, you said that six months ago, and now it has come out.
[00:33:39.641 --> 00:33:43.143]  The homosexuality, the fact that he's blackmailed.
[00:33:43.143 --> 00:33:46.905]  You're saying, so you obviously knew, you're saying even more stuff's coming out.
[00:33:48.154 --> 00:33:54.280]  Yeah, more stuff is going to come out and I think that what we're going to find is that we've been lied to.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.522]  So that's in the past.
[00:33:56.522 --> 00:33:58.223]  But we cannot forget that, Alex.
[00:33:58.223 --> 00:34:00.685]  We cannot forget that we've been lied to.
[00:34:00.685 --> 00:34:01.987]  We've been deceived.
[00:34:01.987 --> 00:34:04.068]  This is how they do it.
[00:34:04.068 --> 00:34:06.671]  And they have this globalist structure above them.
[00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:09.593]  And so the big issue is why?
[00:34:09.593 --> 00:34:11.334]  Why do they want the United States of America?
[00:34:11.334 --> 00:34:16.318]  They want the United States of America for one thing, and that's resources, right?
[00:34:16.318 --> 00:34:17.059]  Resources.
[00:34:17.059 --> 00:34:22.783]  Energy, food, and people that we have, the innovation and the innovative people that we have.
[00:34:22.783 --> 00:34:27.107]  I mean, if they could, China would turn the United States of America into a slave state.
[00:34:27.107 --> 00:34:29.709]  The World Economic Forum would turn us into a slave state.
[00:34:30.089 --> 00:34:30.889]  I totally agree.
[00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:39.294]  So General, what is the calculus to put their boot on our neck and cut off our resources, just bankrupt Americans, drive them into submission?
[00:34:39.294 --> 00:34:41.395]  Yeah, so here's what I think we're going to see.
[00:34:41.395 --> 00:34:46.398]  And it's already been stated, Shrobb has said some of this.
[00:34:46.398 --> 00:34:55.363]  I think we're going to see something in the world of, you know, and we've just finished with this book, this artificial intelligence book, but I actually think that we're going to see a cyber attack.
[00:34:56.207 --> 00:35:06.672]  Or a cyber disruption that is so vast, that is so vast, Alex, that it's going to, it's going to basically disrupt the entire internet.
[00:35:06.672 --> 00:35:08.093]  And I mean, to the point of
[00:35:08.903 --> 00:35:27.971]  Of where it's going to shut everything down and we are we have become so connected as a society and so if you I mean we were joking on the back you know prior about generators and you know you have a you have a hundred thousand dollar generator but you got a 50 cent piece that that's missing and so the whole thing goes to you know but
[00:35:28.531 --> 00:35:28.611]  Yes.
[00:35:28.611 --> 00:35:36.481]  I mean, but we have a government, the United States government, has great control over the Internet.
[00:35:36.481 --> 00:35:37.662]  Great control over the Internet.
[00:35:37.662 --> 00:35:44.731]  Great control and has great and strong and powerful weapon systems in the world of cyber.
[00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:46.292]  Cyber weapons, right?
[00:35:46.292 --> 00:35:50.655]  Lasers, things like that, space-based systems.
[00:35:50.655 --> 00:36:01.242]  So I actually think that we're going to see some type of cyber attack that's so vast it's going to potentially disrupt or disconnect the Internet.
[00:36:01.242 --> 00:36:03.604]  Let's stop and slow down and I want you to start over.
[00:36:03.604 --> 00:36:07.206]  This is so important and explain to me from your expert perspective
[00:36:08.127 --> 00:36:10.108]  Why do the globalists telegraph?
[00:36:10.108 --> 00:36:11.948]  People ask how I'm able to predict stuff.
[00:36:11.948 --> 00:36:13.869]  They telegraph what they're going to pull next.
[00:36:13.869 --> 00:36:14.989]  A virus is going to hit.
[00:36:14.989 --> 00:36:16.289]  It's going to disrupt Trump.
[00:36:16.289 --> 00:36:17.430]  A virus will defeat Trump.
[00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:20.871]  It's basically what Fauci and Schwab said a year before.
[00:36:20.871 --> 00:36:22.551]  And then it happens.
[00:36:22.551 --> 00:36:25.272]  I guess they want to brag to their minions to show off or their
[00:36:25.812 --> 00:36:32.016]  They're pre-programming their people, because if I was going to do something evil like that, and of course I wouldn't, but hypothetically, I wouldn't telegraph it.
[00:36:32.016 --> 00:36:35.379]  They're telegraphing that the cyber is the next big move.
[00:36:35.379 --> 00:36:40.963]  It'll make COVID look like nothing in Schwab's words.
[00:36:40.963 --> 00:36:45.245]  So why are they telegraphing and then laying out how serious this is?
[00:36:45.245 --> 00:36:47.467]  Okay, so for everybody, right?
[00:36:47.467 --> 00:36:54.632]  My whole world for three and a half decades in the military was to think like our enemy
[00:36:55.518 --> 00:36:57.803]  You know, was going to potentially act.
[00:36:57.803 --> 00:37:01.911]  So I had to think about and then provide scenarios to those.
[00:37:03.047 --> 00:37:14.933]  That I was supporting the infantrymen or the armor or the aviators or the operators who were going to go out and do a mission to put their own lives on the line.
[00:37:14.933 --> 00:37:19.456]  So for many, many years, three and a half decades of my life, I had to think about what was the enemy going to do.
[00:37:19.456 --> 00:37:20.376]  So I studied the enemy.
[00:37:20.376 --> 00:37:23.077]  I studied them relentlessly.
[00:37:23.077 --> 00:37:31.442]  And what I learned, one of the big lessons that I learned is what you just said, that the enemy will typically telegraph what it is that they're going to do.
[00:37:31.442 --> 00:37:31.722]  And if you
[00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:45.427]  If you learn enough about your enemy, enough about them, and you don't have to know every single deep dark secret that's in their heart, because that's hard to say, but if you know that they're evil, then you better understand how evil operates.
[00:37:45.427 --> 00:37:46.709]  But what they typically do...
[00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:49.620]  And what they've always done.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.440]  They've always told us what they were going to do.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.321]  And people used to say to me, Jesus, Flynn, you know, you're, you're a madman.
[00:37:54.321 --> 00:37:56.962]  Some of the, some of the things that you come up with that you say to the enemy.
[00:37:56.962 --> 00:37:59.022]  For those that don't know, you never toot your own horn.
[00:37:59.022 --> 00:38:07.505]  You were the first Major General, I mean, Major General, I mean, you're a major person in the staff to say China's going to break and double cross us.
[00:38:07.505 --> 00:38:10.246]  I mean, you basically laid all this out a decade before it happened.
[00:38:10.246 --> 00:38:12.706]  So why, why do bad guys telegraph?
[00:38:12.706 --> 00:38:15.027]  Answer that for me and then get into what you think's next.
[00:38:15.868 --> 00:38:24.070]  Yeah, they telegraph because they don't have all of the resources that they need at their beck and call.
[00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:31.013]  They need to rely on other aspects of sort of the geography and the landscape.
[00:38:31.013 --> 00:38:36.454]  Just like the average anti-fight isn't getting orders to burn things down, they just know, go out and burn stuff down.
[00:38:36.454 --> 00:38:36.954]  Exactly.
[00:38:36.954 --> 00:38:38.735]  So they're calling on their militia, basically.
[00:38:39.635 --> 00:39:06.818]  Exactly, it's like I've got to put that, it's a dog whistle, it's a bit of a dog whistle, but they need to be able to rally because when they do these kinds of, from an enemy perspective, that's why they do it, they let it be known what they're going to do, they get the word out, and if we're good, right, guys like you, especially guys like you, and people like myself and others, if we're good and we're paying attention and we're listening to what they're saying, they're going to tell us exactly what they're going to do.
[00:39:08.527 --> 00:39:10.128]  And you have to connect a few dots.
[00:39:10.128 --> 00:39:12.670]  You've got to do some analytics.
[00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.572]  In some cases, you've got to do deep analysis and some link analysis.
[00:39:16.572 --> 00:39:18.894]  Some of your listeners would definitely know what I'm talking about.
[00:39:18.894 --> 00:39:20.475]  And you've got to put the picture together.
[00:39:20.475 --> 00:39:29.481]  It's like I say on the battlefield in warfare, you're not going to be handed a thousand piece puzzle with all thousand pieces.
[00:39:29.481 --> 00:39:30.502]  You're going to be handed a thousand
[00:39:30.982 --> 00:39:31.783]  We're good to go.
[00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:57.928]  All while they're planning their big ticket thing.
[00:39:57.928 --> 00:39:59.228]  Like even going after Trump.
[00:39:59.228 --> 00:40:02.830]  All of these indictments.
[00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:04.111]  I was reading a thing this morning.
[00:40:04.111 --> 00:40:08.914]  I think we're up to like 74, 75 felony indictments for 700 and something years.
[00:40:08.914 --> 00:40:09.934]  It's insane.
[00:40:09.934 --> 00:40:16.378]  If they had just given Trump like one or two felony counts, I'd be worried.
[00:40:16.378 --> 00:40:17.559]  I'd be worried about that.
[00:40:17.559 --> 00:40:20.200]  I ain't worried because they know that they have nothing.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:20.720]  Exactly.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.542]  They went into overkill, which shows they're not confident.
[00:40:24.571 --> 00:40:29.275]  So one of the other aspects of an enemy, and this enemy that we are facing, is arrogance.
[00:40:29.275 --> 00:40:33.279]  Their arrogance because they just are so arrogant.
[00:40:33.279 --> 00:40:36.122]  And this is how evil operates, right?
[00:40:36.122 --> 00:40:45.170]  The arrogance of evil is something that is so profound, and it is something that we have to pay attention to.
[00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.592]  Well, we know from the Bible that's the big sin is pride.
[00:40:47.592 --> 00:40:48.853]  That's the devil's makeup.
[00:40:48.853 --> 00:40:49.054]  Right.
[00:40:49.813 --> 00:40:50.954]  Right, right.
[00:40:50.954 --> 00:40:55.976]  So, you know, we have to, we just can't look at these people and go, they're just a bunch of arrogant bastards.
[00:40:55.976 --> 00:41:04.119]  These people, their arrogance will be one of the main telegraphing features of what it is that they are going to do.
[00:41:04.119 --> 00:41:10.062]  So, I go back to this potential cyber, because cyber is something that
[00:41:10.658 --> 00:41:16.024]  Few people understand, even fewer know what to do about it.
[00:41:16.024 --> 00:41:28.117]  If your phone's shut down, if the internet's shut down, you know, if you have your own servers, let's say, you know, if you're a media company and you have your own servers, you have your own ability to project, you have, I mean, little things.
[00:41:28.117 --> 00:41:30.440]  So here's a little thing that people aren't paying attention to.
[00:41:31.371 --> 00:41:36.556]  They're going to remove AM radios from cars, right?
[00:41:36.556 --> 00:41:41.040]  The big car manufacturers who are all woke corporations, they're taking AM radios out.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.221]  They're going to stop.
[00:41:42.221 --> 00:41:49.668]  The Federal Communications Commission is going to start to minimize or limit the use of AM radio.
[00:41:49.668 --> 00:41:51.950]  AM radio is one of the most powerful communications
[00:41:52.410 --> 00:42:22.030]  Means in the world still other than maybe a ham radio and there's very few ham radio operators around the world So if you don't have your own server, you know Like you may have or I know some other small media outlets or bigger Some of the other bigger ones have their own server farms where they're able to operate they have their own generators but then generators need to run off a little electricity or or fuel and then you run out of fuel if you don't have those things then the US government is going to go to what they'll what they'll tell us is emergency broadcast
[00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:24.512]  And by the way, they're doing a huge test.
[00:42:24.512 --> 00:42:25.352]  I know where you're going with this.
[00:42:25.352 --> 00:42:26.093]  Exactly.
[00:42:26.093 --> 00:42:27.413]  Think about just 20 years ago.
[00:42:27.413 --> 00:42:30.035]  AM, FM, UHF, VHF.
[00:42:30.035 --> 00:42:32.036]  Media didn't watch you.
[00:42:32.036 --> 00:42:41.763]  Now, by phasing out all the old broadcast systems, starting with AM and shortwave, and our military's moving even away from it, everything now is on the web, which makes it all targetable.
[00:42:41.963 --> 00:42:54.991]  I'm not a military mastermind like you, but common sense means our military should be always, 100 years from now, still back up shortwave, still back up AM, still back up, you know, all those other secret systems that transmit to the Earth.
[00:42:54.991 --> 00:42:59.094]  But instead, they're moving away, making us vulnerable is what you're saying, putting us on one system.
[00:42:59.434 --> 00:43:00.835]  Bodies is back!

[00:46:07.824 --> 00:46:13.306]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[00:46:13.306 --> 00:46:18.248]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[00:46:19.628 --> 00:46:24.473]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[00:47:01.812 --> 00:47:06.416]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:06.416 --> 00:47:07.717]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:47:14.602 --> 00:47:29.968]  The entirety of our country is being put in such a vulnerable spot right now, and this is going to continue to, you know, from their perspective, is going to continue to make progress to get to a place where we cannot control anything.
[00:47:29.968 --> 00:47:32.209]  We will not be able to control our phones.
[00:47:32.209 --> 00:47:37.171]  We will not be able to control, hell, the light switches in our home.
[00:47:37.171 --> 00:47:42.453]  I mean, I want people to realize, you know, they're going to call me nuts about this stuff, but I want people to realize that
[00:47:43.033 --> 00:47:54.847]  That the sobering reality is that evil exists and these people, when Klaus Schwab says and writes about that you're going to own nothing and be happy, he's not joking.
[00:47:54.847 --> 00:47:55.848]  This is not a joke.
[00:47:55.848 --> 00:47:57.510]  This is a man that doesn't joke.
[00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:07.554]  This is a man who has his hands on every single major nation state on this planet, to include the United States of America.
[00:48:07.554 --> 00:48:17.197]  His circle of leaders, you know, and these are not... Well, remember General Petraeus 12 years ago said, soon your dishwasher will be watching you and listening to you.
[00:48:17.197 --> 00:48:18.778]  Well, now that's been here a while.
[00:48:19.929 --> 00:48:23.611]  Right, you know, we have something called the Internet of Things, right?
[00:48:23.611 --> 00:48:26.893]  People understand the Internet of Things, for those that know what I'm talking about.
[00:48:26.893 --> 00:48:33.558]  So, I go back to, you know, what are the potential things that could happen, right?
[00:48:33.558 --> 00:48:43.284]  And one of the ways, you know, in warfare, you know, Sun Tzu used to say that, in fact, he wrote about it, and I've studied it for ad nauseum
[00:48:43.945 --> 00:48:46.506]  But everything in war is deception.
[00:48:46.506 --> 00:48:48.887]  I want people to understand what I just said.
[00:48:48.887 --> 00:48:50.968]  Everything in war is deception.
[00:48:50.968 --> 00:48:52.849]  We are in a war right now.
[00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:59.012]  There are some physical components out there, clearly physical components over in Europe.
[00:48:59.012 --> 00:49:03.254]  There's clearly physical components still in Afghanistan, Iraq, you know, around the world.
[00:49:03.254 --> 00:49:07.056]  There's physical components in every single major city in this country.
[00:49:07.056 --> 00:49:09.797]  And it's called, you know, things like defund the police.
[00:49:09.797 --> 00:49:10.718]  The defund the police
[00:49:11.978 --> 00:49:16.861]  That goes back to the Bolshevik Revolution under the era of Stalin.
[00:49:16.861 --> 00:49:28.066]  So, you know, the Democrats are... Oh, that's a State Department memorandum 7277 from 1962 to disarm the police and then our military and only have a UN force.
[00:49:28.066 --> 00:49:28.906]  That's the official policy.
[00:49:30.723 --> 00:49:32.644]  Exactly.
[00:49:32.644 --> 00:49:38.787]  So I want people to understand that the rise and fall of nation states is very real.
[00:49:38.787 --> 00:49:40.168]  It's a fact of life.
[00:49:40.168 --> 00:49:43.150]  I joked the other day with some friends that I was with.
[00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.671]  I said, when was the last time you met anybody from Byzantine, from the Byzantine Empire?
[00:49:46.671 --> 00:49:48.753]  And they looked at me like I was cross-eyed.
[00:49:48.753 --> 00:49:50.834]  And I said, because they don't exist anymore.
[00:49:50.834 --> 00:49:53.615]  So the American Empire, you know, let's just say 250 years.
[00:49:55.416 --> 00:50:05.940]  So where are we in that sort of rise and decline of this nation, this beautiful experiment in democracy called a constitutional republic?
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.140]  Where are we?
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:10.942]  And I will tell you, these people are going to work overtime.
[00:50:10.942 --> 00:50:14.583]  And those are the ones that I just laid out to include those in our own government.
[00:50:14.583 --> 00:50:18.064]  I mean, you know, there's no way in the world that Joe Biden is in charge of anything.
[00:50:18.064 --> 00:50:19.365]  He could barely go to the bathroom.
[00:50:19.365 --> 00:50:20.385]  I mean, Jesus, this guy
[00:50:21.526 --> 00:50:24.950]  This guy can't walk up two stairs, I mean, without help.
[00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:26.952]  So how do we get here?
[00:50:26.952 --> 00:50:39.266]  We got here because we've been complacent, we've been lazy, we've been apathetic about our political system, we've allowed a culture of corruption to just bleed
[00:50:41.548 --> 00:50:49.738]  That's exactly where I want to go, because we have the incestuous globalists double dealing with the other power blocs, but then they're trying to degrade and demoralize the United States.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.601]  I see a great awakening.
[00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:17.180]  That they will try to kill Trump.
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.021]  I think that's a very reasonable statement.
[00:51:19.021 --> 00:51:22.303]  I think that they're trying to outlaw their political opposition.
[00:51:22.303 --> 00:51:24.724]  They're trying to create a one-party state.
[00:51:24.724 --> 00:51:26.105]  Even Senator Josh Hawley gets that.
[00:51:26.105 --> 00:51:29.967]  So I see it positive that people realize how much trouble we're in.
[00:51:29.967 --> 00:51:32.508]  But is it a dollar short and a day late?
[00:51:32.508 --> 00:51:33.469]  Or what can we do?
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:41.382]  Yeah, what you just said at the very last point, I hope that that's not Nadal is short in a day.
[00:51:41.382 --> 00:51:43.503]  I pray that we're not there.
[00:51:43.503 --> 00:51:47.764]  I think right now they're trying to kill Trump by narrative, right?
[00:51:47.764 --> 00:51:50.605]  I mean, the narrative is just constant, constant narrative.
[00:51:50.605 --> 00:51:52.706]  It's been going on for years.
[00:51:52.706 --> 00:52:01.649]  And, you know, these latest indictments are just part of the narrative assassination, I would say, because of who he is and what he represents, which is a major, major
[00:52:02.544 --> 00:52:06.088]  I think Donald Trump needs to be very careful and I think those that are around him need to be very careful.
[00:52:22.083 --> 00:52:30.370]  I think the Secret Service that protects his life need to ramp it up, and they ought to actually be asking for more help.
[00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:32.611]  They should be asking for more help.
[00:52:32.611 --> 00:52:37.015]  As those of us that run in those same circles, we need to be doing the same thing.
[00:52:37.555 --> 00:52:55.477]  Because these people, they are not without that type of level of action, of activity, if they feel so threatened that what you're doing is going to stop their ability to be able to continue
[00:52:56.235 --> 00:52:57.916]  I want the audience to get a sense of urgency because
[00:53:25.151 --> 00:53:28.233]  I mean, I'm not a military trained tactician like you or a combat veteran.
[00:53:28.233 --> 00:53:31.555]  I'm just a veteran of 29 years fighting these people.
[00:53:31.555 --> 00:53:37.998]  And I see a mixture of arrogance, but that's hiding their desperation and the fact that they're all in.
[00:53:37.998 --> 00:53:40.679]  And I don't think people realize I can feel it.
[00:53:40.679 --> 00:53:41.680]  I can see it.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.061]  Just what you just said, General.
[00:53:43.061 --> 00:53:45.262]  I have never had such a sense of urgency.
[00:53:45.262 --> 00:53:46.543]  That's why I have you here.
[00:53:46.543 --> 00:53:47.103]  What can we do?
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:54.611]  Yeah, so and again, I appreciate everything you've done for years.
[00:53:54.611 --> 00:53:56.875]  Yeah, there's a sense of urgency that we all need.
[00:53:56.875 --> 00:53:58.057]  And like I say, you know, I
[00:53:59.157 --> 00:54:01.218]  A weakness of mine is anxiety.
[00:54:01.218 --> 00:54:02.539]  I get anxious sometimes.
[00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:08.782]  I'll wake up, like I woke up this morning at about 3 o'clock in the morning and I started reading and writing.
[00:54:08.782 --> 00:54:09.183]  Me too.
[00:54:09.183 --> 00:54:12.625]  I woke up at 3.15 and was just, because I don't have the anxiety during the day.
[00:54:12.625 --> 00:54:15.146]  I wake up because my brain's working while I'm asleep.
[00:54:15.146 --> 00:54:16.026]  I went to bed about 10.
[00:54:16.026 --> 00:54:18.728]  I woke up at 3 and I was like, I've got to do something.
[00:54:19.855 --> 00:54:20.476]  Exactly.
[00:54:20.476 --> 00:54:26.103]  And so to me, I want people to, you know, I have a platform, you have a platform.
[00:54:26.103 --> 00:54:30.849]  I have a national platform and an international platform and I'm going to continue to use it.
[00:54:31.934 --> 00:54:33.395]  I'm going to speak out.
[00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:35.255]  I'm going to move around this country.
[00:54:35.255 --> 00:54:37.376]  I'm going to get in the faces of these people.
[00:54:37.376 --> 00:54:39.517]  I'm going to let them know that we got your number.
[00:54:39.517 --> 00:54:43.978]  I'm going to let Americans know that we're with you and you've got to be with us.
[00:54:43.978 --> 00:54:45.819]  You've got to stand behind us.
[00:54:45.819 --> 00:54:50.280]  There will be those of us that will be that pointy end of the spear.
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.741]  But I need every American now.
[00:54:51.741 --> 00:54:57.963]  I need every single person to get into their communities and to get into the faces of their local politicians.
[00:54:58.363 --> 00:55:05.669]  I mean, that's why we've seen particularly women, Alex, getting in the faces of these school boards around the country.
[00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:11.653]  You know, we haven't really talked about the educational immersion that they're taking our children through.
[00:55:11.653 --> 00:55:15.196]  And this is actually part of the Chinese plan, too.
[00:55:15.196 --> 00:55:16.217]  So, you know, people don't know.
[00:55:16.997 --> 00:55:25.723]  Well, in 1949, when Mao came to power, he created a 100-year plan, and by 2049, China would be the dominant world power.
[00:55:25.723 --> 00:55:32.908]  Well, when Xi came on board, which Xi's only like the fifth or sixth leader since Mao, I think the fifth leader since Mao.
[00:55:33.681 --> 00:55:45.388]  He came on board, declared himself president for life, and he is going to move at a pace that's much faster because he knows he's not going to be around in 2049, so he's going to make it happen by 2029.
[00:55:45.388 --> 00:55:48.029]  And I think you hit the key here, though.
[00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:56.474]  People have to know who the enemies are, and I am seeing a real acceleration in the learning curve.
[00:55:56.914 --> 00:56:02.140]  I mean, if I tried to list all the people now that sound, quote, radical like you and I, but we're not radical, we just are aware.
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:02.760]  No.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.585]  That's got to really scare... I mean, even James Wood sounds like General Flynn now.
[00:56:06.585 --> 00:56:08.907]  Russell Brand, Tucker Carlson.
[00:56:08.907 --> 00:56:10.188]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:56:10.188 --> 00:56:10.849]  R.F.K.
[00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:11.290]  Jr., I mean...
[00:56:12.426 --> 00:56:14.747]  Right, RFK, so RFK Jr.
[00:56:14.747 --> 00:56:17.548]  And the other thing is, don't listen to Alex Jones.
[00:56:17.548 --> 00:56:19.229]  Don't listen to Mike Flynn.
[00:56:19.229 --> 00:56:25.392]  Go and do your own damn critical research, and you're going to find that we're only scratching the surface.
[00:56:25.392 --> 00:56:25.712]  Exactly.
[00:56:25.712 --> 00:56:28.013]  Nothing that we've said is stuff that we're making up.
[00:56:28.013 --> 00:56:32.455]  This is stuff that we're just scratching the surface of what these people are capable of doing.
[00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:34.356]  So, where's the Republican Party?
[00:56:34.356 --> 00:56:35.337]  Where's the leadership?
[00:56:35.337 --> 00:56:36.237]  It's non-existent.
[00:56:36.237 --> 00:56:37.178]  Non-existent.
[00:56:37.178 --> 00:56:39.599]  So, where's the impeachment of Biden?
[00:56:39.599 --> 00:56:40.019]  Where is it?
[00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:42.110]  Right.
[00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:51.975]  Well, I know that one congressman has put in impeachment proceedings to initiate them, but he did that like almost a month ago, Alex.
[00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:54.976]  And yet, McCarthy is still on vacation.
[00:56:54.976 --> 00:56:58.038]  He's still got the entire house on vacation.
[00:56:58.038 --> 00:57:04.360]  MTG, I should have announced it, is in the studio tomorrow night, and she says that it's going to be introduced in the next two weeks.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:09.803]  She says she's got his... I'm kind of breaking news here, but let's hope that's the case.
[00:57:10.287 --> 00:57:19.091]  Yeah, well, so a guy by the name of Greg Stubbe, Congressman Stubbe from Florida, he did introduce impeachment proceedings already.
[00:57:19.091 --> 00:57:21.072]  And he did it about four weeks ago.
[00:57:21.072 --> 00:57:25.815]  So now it's like, I was like jumping through my skin when I heard that four weeks ago.
[00:57:25.815 --> 00:57:30.077]  And I was like, great, let's get all these guys back, guys and gals back to work.
[00:57:30.077 --> 00:57:32.098]  And let's start the impeachment proceedings now.
[00:57:32.098 --> 00:57:35.540]  You know, you take a week, take a week's break, take a take a four days.
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.000]  Yeah, we gotta go on offense.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.061]  And instead, it's gotta work.
[00:57:39.281 --> 00:57:41.762]  We've got to go, yeah, we've got to go on offense.
[00:57:41.762 --> 00:57:44.202]  We can, we have got to get off of our heels.
[00:57:44.202 --> 00:57:55.365]  We have got to start, you know, the only way we're going to score, the only way we're going to win is by being... Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good news.
[00:57:55.365 --> 00:58:00.566]  Because it's a great product you love, and people want it, and it funds our operation of 360 Win.
[00:58:00.566 --> 00:58:04.387]  Bodies, Ultimate, Turmeric Formula, the strongest you're going to find anywhere.
[00:58:05.007 --> 00:58:12.413]  Jam-packed, a big ol' giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation, that empowers your neurological system, you name it.
[00:58:12.413 --> 00:58:14.434]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[00:58:14.434 --> 00:58:15.695]  God gave it to us.
[00:58:15.695 --> 00:58:17.877]  And it's the strongest curcuminoid out there.
[00:58:17.877 --> 00:58:21.339]  Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid.
[00:58:21.339 --> 00:58:23.681]  Most brands are 5% curcumidin.
[00:58:23.681 --> 00:58:25.963]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[00:58:25.963 --> 00:58:29.405]  This is the strongest anybody makes.
[00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:30.926]  95% curcuminoid.
[00:58:30.926 --> 00:58:32.267]  I am so glad this is back.
[00:58:33.488 --> 00:58:35.331]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:58:35.331 --> 00:58:38.235]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.

[00:59:51.292 --> 00:59:57.194]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.093 --> 01:00:16.097]  The globalist's worst nightmare and the Patriot's best friend, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.097 --> 01:00:23.100]  I mean, look at what, what, you know, we know what Nancy Pelosi was able to do in really the first 30 days of her previous time as speaker.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.640]  She had 500 indictments out.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.160]  500.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.241]  I mean, it was 500 subpoenas.
[01:00:27.241 --> 01:00:31.883]  I'm sorry, 500 subpoenas out to people for her January, fake January 6th
[01:00:33.155 --> 01:00:34.956]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:00:34.956 --> 01:00:35.997]  Where are we?
[01:00:35.997 --> 01:00:41.762]  This speaker, McCarthy, as far as I'm concerned, is a rhino establishment figurehead.
[01:00:42.629 --> 01:00:46.031]  And he doesn't deserve to be called speaker.
[01:00:46.031 --> 01:00:48.053]  No, I totally agree, and we should expand on that.
[01:00:48.053 --> 01:00:49.974]  Obviously, they're scared of the Justice Department.
[01:00:49.974 --> 01:00:50.994]  They're intimidated.
[01:00:50.994 --> 01:00:51.755]  He should be removed.
[01:00:51.755 --> 01:00:53.336]  He doesn't take action.
[01:00:53.336 --> 01:00:55.617]  But that's another great example.
[01:00:55.617 --> 01:00:58.239]  We need to see the impeachment of Merrick Garland.
[01:00:58.239 --> 01:01:03.702]  They've caught him meeting secretly with Jack Smith, meeting at the White House with Jack Smith.
[01:01:03.702 --> 01:01:06.184]  They've caught him covering up the Hunter Biden stuff.
[01:01:06.184 --> 01:01:07.805]  We have all the whistleblowers.
[01:01:07.805 --> 01:01:09.026]  Impeach the son of a bitch!
[01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:14.386]  Yeah, so I just want to take a minute to talk about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:01:14.386 --> 01:01:23.495]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., number one, they won't provide him Secret Service, which tells you everything that they plan on potentially doing to that guy.
[01:01:25.737 --> 01:01:32.619]  Number two, Kennedy, every time I hear him, I'm like, Jesus, Kennedy, you sound like you're an America first guy.
[01:01:32.619 --> 01:01:46.062]  You sound like a damn, an American who, you sound like either you're old school Democrat and you're right there in the center of the country, or you're on the conservative side because of the way you're speaking.
[01:01:46.062 --> 01:01:49.803]  And I would say that even some of the things that he's written about.
[01:01:49.803 --> 01:01:53.064]  So I like him and I know him.
[01:01:53.784 --> 01:02:02.830]  And when I see guys like him, I mean, he gives me hope because the Democrats, the Democrats now are the Marxist Party, right?
[01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:07.973]  So the Democrats are not going to do a debate with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:02:07.973 --> 01:02:08.673]  Why?
[01:02:08.673 --> 01:02:13.336]  Because he represents something that they fear, which is honesty and the truth.
[01:02:14.036 --> 01:02:18.200]  Why don't they want to have, why don't, why are they going after Donald Trump so hard?
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.683]  Because he represents honesty and he represents the truth.
[01:02:21.683 --> 01:02:30.610]  And yeah, you're showing some, you're showing clips of, I mean, of not only his father being assassinated, but, but his uncle being assassinated.
[01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:32.852]  Nevermind Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:02:32.852 --> 01:02:42.160]  Nevermind Malcolm X. I mean, Malcolm X, in one of the, one of the statements that Malcolm X said is, anybody that calls themselves a liberal, liberal Democrat, he said,
[01:02:43.163 --> 01:02:44.344]  Be very careful.
[01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:45.585]  He talks about liberals, right?
[01:02:45.585 --> 01:02:48.347]  He says, be very careful about somebody who says they're liberal.
[01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:51.710]  And then a couple of days later, when he gave that speech, he was dead.
[01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:52.730]  He was assassinated.
[01:02:52.730 --> 01:03:01.677]  So, you know, at that time in our history, physical assassinations were much easier to get away with.
[01:03:01.677 --> 01:03:05.360]  And then, of course, you could hide everything and classify it or it's under investigation.
[01:03:06.008 --> 01:03:11.512]  Now, physical assassinations would be very, very difficult to get away with because everybody's got a damn camera.
[01:03:11.512 --> 01:03:24.420]  You know, but... That's why they assassinate you now with lawfare and lies, but I really feel and see that's their desperation button is, I see political assassination coming roaring back.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:26.741]  And my gut's never wrong, General.
[01:03:26.741 --> 01:03:33.566]  Yeah, boy, you know, I mean, this is the time, and I hope it is, because I hate to think that, but I will tell you that
[01:03:35.243 --> 01:03:39.389]  These people are not going to wake up tomorrow morning, Alex.
[01:03:40.434 --> 01:03:47.079]  I'm talking about these people, the World Economic Forum or the White House.
[01:03:47.079 --> 01:03:48.600]  They're not going to wake up and go, you know what?
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.562]  We've screwed the American people so bad.
[01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:54.244]  Let's turn the energy spigots back on.
[01:03:54.244 --> 01:03:58.647]  Let's get rid of this cultural bullshit inside of our education system.
[01:03:58.647 --> 01:03:59.928]  Let's stop with the CRT.
[01:03:59.928 --> 01:04:02.050]  Let's stop with the drag queen hour.
[01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:03.851]  Let's fund police.
[01:04:03.851 --> 01:04:05.472]  Let's go ahead and build a wall.
[01:04:05.472 --> 01:04:07.634]  Let's go ahead and stop this invasion.
[01:04:07.634 --> 01:04:08.114]  Let's get the
[01:04:08.234 --> 01:04:16.577]  Yeah, they could be in charge of a big win and have dominations of American culture and be ten times more powerful, but they have a needle dick.
[01:04:16.577 --> 01:04:18.078]  Why do the globalists hate us so much?
[01:04:18.078 --> 01:04:20.419]  Why do they have it out for us?
[01:04:20.419 --> 01:04:28.962]  They hate us because they hate just authentic, honest people who they cannot control.
[01:04:28.962 --> 01:04:30.002]  Yep.
[01:04:30.002 --> 01:04:37.445]  And I mean, yours truly here, it's like, when I was in the tail end of my military time,
[01:04:38.194 --> 01:04:56.909]  You know, one of the, and this is public, you know, one of the reasons why I was told to leave basically a year early from a job that normally would be three years, was because I wouldn't toe the line for the talking points that ISIS was on the run, that Al-Qaeda was on the run, and no longer a threat.
[01:04:56.909 --> 01:04:59.611]  I just wouldn't toe the line because that isn't the truth!
[01:04:59.611 --> 01:05:01.192]  It's just a mask.
[01:05:01.192 --> 01:05:03.013]  It's just six feet.
[01:05:03.013 --> 01:05:05.575]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[01:05:05.575 --> 01:05:07.257]  It's just non-essential workers.
[01:05:07.973 --> 01:05:10.514]  It's just until we work it out.
[01:05:10.514 --> 01:05:12.035]  It's just a bar.
[01:05:12.035 --> 01:05:14.216]  It's just a restaurant.
[01:05:14.216 --> 01:05:16.097]  It's just nursing homes.
[01:05:16.097 --> 01:05:17.978]  It's just schools.
[01:05:17.978 --> 01:05:21.280]  It's just a keep from overwhelming medical services.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.041]  It's just until the cases go down.
[01:05:23.841 --> 01:05:26.103]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[01:05:26.103 --> 01:05:28.225]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[01:05:28.225 --> 01:05:31.388]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[01:05:31.388 --> 01:05:35.953]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[01:05:35.953 --> 01:05:38.435]  It's just churches and mosques.
[01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.117]  It's just singing.
[01:05:40.117 --> 01:05:42.819]  It's just travel.
[01:05:42.819 --> 01:05:44.481]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[01:05:45.261 --> 01:05:47.203]  It's just for the greater good.
[01:05:47.203 --> 01:05:49.445]  It's just fact-checking.
[01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.126]  Not censorship.
[01:05:51.126 --> 01:05:53.108]  It's just mandatory.
[01:05:53.108 --> 01:05:54.949]  It isn't just at all.
[01:05:54.949 --> 01:06:04.937]  Visit defendjones.com to help fight back today.
[01:06:04.937 --> 01:06:08.300]  The show that breaks through the mainstream media's lives.
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.021]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:12.253 --> 01:06:19.376]  And, you know, when they offer you things, you know, they shine this light at the end of the hall, and the light is a very easy light to grab hold of.
[01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:21.116]  They don't want to worry about it.
[01:06:21.116 --> 01:06:22.397]  You know, you're going to get taken care of.
[01:06:22.397 --> 01:06:23.037]  Wait till you get out.
[01:06:23.037 --> 01:06:25.138]  You're going to be put on this board, that board.
[01:06:25.138 --> 01:06:30.580]  You're going to be given all kinds of things, and you're going to, you know, you're going to be taken care of, right?
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.260]  And I just, I'm like, that's bullshit.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.061]  We're talking about people's lives here.
[01:06:34.061 --> 01:06:40.163]  You know, we're talking about... And of course, you were vindicated right after you warned that al-Qaeda through ISIS had a huge resurgence.
[01:06:41.534 --> 01:06:55.627]  Oh my God, it was in 24 or 26 countries, if I remember right at the time, and they were exploding all over Africa, all over the Middle East, and all over Central Asia, as well as here in this country.
[01:06:55.627 --> 01:07:01.513]  And that's one of the things that the Obama administration didn't want to do, so didn't want to talk about, and didn't want to have to admit to, right?
[01:07:04.692 --> 01:07:08.555]  They want this country, and they're not going to wake up, they're going to continue to triple down.
[01:07:08.555 --> 01:07:11.538]  So we're going to see more of the same stuff.
[01:07:11.538 --> 01:07:18.864]  You know, you showed the pictures of the mosquitoes, you know, the Bill Gates Foundation spraying mosquitoes.
[01:07:18.864 --> 01:07:20.485]  We're already talking about masks.
[01:07:21.005 --> 01:07:23.506]  And is it the resistance to that an example of victory?
[01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:26.646]  In the few minutes we have left, any other key points you'd like to add?
[01:07:26.646 --> 01:07:28.907]  My big concern is false flags in your research.
[01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:49.733]  Obviously, a cyber attack can be blamed on somebody.
[01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:52.636]  They're trying to say all the conservatives are white supremacists.
[01:07:52.636 --> 01:07:56.660]  I'm worried they'll attack a black church or a college.
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:08:00.024]  They're really pushing that narrative.
[01:08:00.024 --> 01:08:01.826]  What do you see in your false flag, Will House?
[01:08:01.826 --> 01:08:04.068]  And I want to get you back on soon, because I'm going to read the book.
[01:08:04.068 --> 01:08:06.371]  I read your last book, How to Fight AI.
[01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:06.992]  Tell us about that.
[01:08:08.123 --> 01:08:23.787]  Yeah, so one thing on false flags, it's very easy to train a militia of a bunch of white dudes up in the, you know, up in the boonies somewhere in this country and then get them out there to do something and make sure that, you know, that they're all taken care of, right?
[01:08:23.787 --> 01:08:30.509]  It's easy to do that and make it appear as though it's some white, you know, Christian national Nazi group, right?
[01:08:30.509 --> 01:08:32.490]  And then they blame and they do something.
[01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:35.751]  So, these are easy things to do, folks.
[01:08:35.751 --> 01:08:37.993]  These are these false flags, we call them.
[01:08:37.993 --> 01:08:39.914]  These are easy things to create.
[01:08:39.914 --> 01:08:42.856]  Now, if you have another element called a bunch of illegals,
[01:08:57.865 --> 01:09:01.508]  So nobody's looking for him in, you know, hometown USA, right?
[01:09:01.508 --> 01:09:04.370]  Nobody's looking for their brother or their uncle.
[01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:06.972]  It's just a bunch of illegals that are being trained.
[01:09:06.972 --> 01:09:12.957]  And we have people coming into this, coming into America from like 165, 168 countries.
[01:09:12.957 --> 01:09:24.245]  Do you remember just six months ago they had three illegal groups in Texas commit mass shootings and they tried to say white supremacists did it, but it didn't work so they shut it down.
[01:09:24.245 --> 01:09:24.886]  Is that what you're getting at?
[01:09:25.842 --> 01:09:27.783]  Yes, that's exactly what I'm getting at.
[01:09:27.783 --> 01:09:34.168]  And so they're going to try, they'll test, they'll test the waters, and you're going to see these false flags.
[01:09:34.168 --> 01:09:36.529]  We have got to be able to analyze them quickly.
[01:09:36.529 --> 01:09:42.333]  We've got to be able to, if we still have access to the internet, we have to be able to get the word out quickly.
[01:09:42.333 --> 01:09:48.437]  We've got to use the influencers that we have to say, hey, you know, don't fall into this trap that they want.
[01:09:48.437 --> 01:09:49.578]  They want this trap of
[01:09:50.038 --> 01:09:55.524]  They want it to where the American people start to become violent.
[01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:58.667]  This is non-violence, right?
[01:09:58.667 --> 01:10:05.914]  We have got to be so smart about what they are going to try to lure Americans into doing, okay?
[01:10:05.914 --> 01:10:07.536]  And this is part of this false flag.
[01:10:08.016 --> 01:10:19.381]  Now, if they also do cyber attacks, simultaneous, right, at the same time, where they're shutting down, and they can segment the internet, they don't just have to shut down the entire internet, they can segment the internet.
[01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:21.502]  They can only send this to their sites, exactly.
[01:10:21.502 --> 01:10:37.228]  They're going to hit with a cyber attack, claim it's the Russians, they've already said the right-wing Trump's going to work with the Russians to shut the web off, they shut it down to shut us up, and that's why they've been trying to get rid of every local talk show host that's on AM and FM that's a patriot, is because they're still worried about those systems.
[01:10:38.564 --> 01:10:42.089]  And in the world of AI, this is how to fight AI.
[01:10:42.089 --> 01:10:53.324]  In this world, which is really important, they could use false videos of you, of me, of Trump, of high-profile people.
[01:10:54.316 --> 01:11:01.483]  So a truck mom goes off at a black college and it's Alex Jones or Trump or General Flynn saying, good job, blow more stuff up.
[01:11:01.483 --> 01:11:02.644]  We never said that.
[01:11:10.291 --> 01:11:12.513]  Exactly, exactly, exactly.
[01:11:12.513 --> 01:11:25.704]  And now what you have to do is, you're on the defense, and now you've got to go out there and fight some media thing, and you've got, you know, ABC, NBC, CBL, you've got all the big major networks, the cable news networks that are going,
[01:11:26.725 --> 01:11:28.206]  Did you see what General Flynn said?
[01:11:28.206 --> 01:11:29.407]  Did you see what Alex Jones said?
[01:11:29.407 --> 01:11:31.770]  Did you see what these people are talking about?
[01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:34.833]  And it's none of that, right?
[01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:35.814]  It's none of that.
[01:11:35.814 --> 01:11:37.135]  The whole thing is fake.
[01:11:37.135 --> 01:11:39.517]  The whole thing is a poser, right?
[01:11:39.517 --> 01:11:40.138]  It's a poser.
[01:11:40.138 --> 01:11:41.539]  Well, here's the microcosm.
[01:11:41.539 --> 01:11:47.064]  I'm there on January 6, trying to get everybody over where Trump's stage was on the Northeast side by the Supreme Court.
[01:11:47.885 --> 01:11:50.386]  And I get up and say, I've got thousands to not go in.
[01:11:50.386 --> 01:11:52.287]  Wall Street Journal still ran headlines.
[01:11:52.287 --> 01:11:53.628]  I said, attack the Capitol.
[01:11:53.628 --> 01:11:55.489]  Now, thank God we still had the Internet.
[01:11:55.489 --> 01:11:57.990]  I was banned, but other people got the video out.
[01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.811]  They had to retract.
[01:11:58.811 --> 01:12:02.432]  But if we're not online, they'll be able to do that.
[01:12:02.432 --> 01:12:09.116]  They'll be able to do that and they will use and they will be given, they will be given access to the emergency broadcast system.
[01:12:10.296 --> 01:12:12.436]  By this administration, I guarantee that.
[01:12:12.436 --> 01:12:26.099]  So if we start to hear about the emergency broadcast system being tested and used, I really think that the real potential exists, and this is in Klaus Schwab's words, right?
[01:12:26.099 --> 01:12:34.601]  How the enemy telegraphs, you know, he says he used that a cyber attack so vast it disconnects the internet.
[01:12:34.601 --> 01:12:36.301]  Klaus Schwab's words.
[01:12:36.301 --> 01:12:39.422]  So I actually, when he said that, it was like,
[01:12:40.333 --> 01:12:43.274]  He said it, and he doesn't say things just off the cuff.
[01:12:43.274 --> 01:12:43.915]  No.
[01:12:43.915 --> 01:12:47.836]  He says things that are so, so prepared.
[01:12:47.836 --> 01:12:53.999]  And when he said that, and then he didn't talk about it again, and nobody questioned him on it, like, what the hell is this guy talking about?
[01:12:53.999 --> 01:12:57.781]  I thought the World Economic Forum had something to do with economics.
[01:12:57.781 --> 01:12:59.381]  It had something to do with our financial system.
[01:12:59.381 --> 01:13:02.323]  It had something to do with, you know, there's nothing good about this.
[01:13:02.323 --> 01:13:05.164]  No, it's the Corporate Intelligence Agency that's taking over.
[01:13:05.764 --> 01:13:07.025]  Every aspect.
[01:13:07.025 --> 01:13:09.686]  General Flynn, incredible 45 minutes with us.
[01:13:09.686 --> 01:13:11.027]  GeneralFlynn.com.
[01:13:11.027 --> 01:13:12.748]  Everybody should get How to Fight AI.
[01:13:12.748 --> 01:13:13.389]  I'm going to read it.
[01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.890]  I'm going to go order it today.
[01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:17.591]  GeneralFlynn.com.
[01:13:17.591 --> 01:13:18.772]  Thank you so much.
[01:13:18.772 --> 01:13:21.253]  We now have Joe Biggs on the line from prison.
[01:13:21.253 --> 01:13:24.575]  Would you like to do 60 seconds before we go to him just on your view on what just happened?
[01:13:27.648 --> 01:13:31.970]  Yeah, I do.
[01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:38.912]  I mean, I think that what's going on with our people that are being held as political prisoners, this is madness.
[01:13:38.912 --> 01:13:40.272]  This is sheer madness.
[01:13:40.272 --> 01:13:41.893]  I mean, these people the other day, the
[01:13:42.253 --> 01:13:46.497]  I mean, these people are out there protecting the life of babies and the unborn and the Planned Parenthood.
[01:13:46.497 --> 01:13:48.578]  They're actually killing babies after the fact, and they knew it!
[01:13:48.578 --> 01:13:49.079]  After they were born!
[01:14:03.507 --> 01:14:04.728]  Brought into this world.
[01:14:04.728 --> 01:14:08.971]  I mean, they're going to put these people in jail for upwards of 10 years.
[01:14:08.971 --> 01:14:13.395]  These are political issues, political prisoners, and we have got to stand against this.
[01:14:13.395 --> 01:14:16.998]  And trust me, this is why they don't want us back in power.
[01:14:16.998 --> 01:14:23.983]  This is why they're fighting tooth and nail to keep Trump out and to keep guys like me from going back into government to help him.
[01:14:23.983 --> 01:14:27.326]  Because I know Trump will pardon people like Joe Biggs, there's no doubt.
[01:14:27.326 --> 01:14:30.629]  GeneralFlynn.com, God bless you and thank you so much, General.
[01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:31.069]  Absolutely.
[01:14:31.069 --> 01:14:31.549]  God bless.
[01:14:31.549 --> 01:14:31.870]  Thank you.
[01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:33.584]  Alright, wow.
[01:14:33.584 --> 01:14:50.166]  Now, let's go to Joe Biggs, who was just wrongfully convicted and sentenced to 17 years in prison, former Infowars reporter, totally innocent, charged with terrorism, terrorism sentencing, for being there when
[01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:55.111]  Ray Epps broke through the fence.
[01:14:55.111 --> 01:14:56.591]  This is insane.
[01:14:56.591 --> 01:15:01.732]  Joe, I love you, brother, and you're a political prisoner, and we appreciate you.
[01:15:01.732 --> 01:15:11.675]  I know you only get 15 minutes per call, and you've got a call back at 15 again, so we've got about 12 minutes for you before they hang up on you, then we'll be waiting for you to come back on again in about 30 minutes.
[01:15:11.675 --> 01:15:13.435]  But Joe, how are you holding up?
[01:15:13.435 --> 01:15:15.896]  And you've got the floor.
[01:15:15.896 --> 01:15:17.016]  It's all right.
[01:15:17.016 --> 01:15:18.076]  My heart hurts.
[01:15:18.076 --> 01:15:19.356]  This is ridiculous.
[01:15:19.356 --> 01:15:21.597]  They said that shaking a fence was pantomime.
[01:15:23.464 --> 01:15:34.797]  The judge told me that and they want to send a message to Americans that if you go to these events, if you are part of political groups, they're going to throw you in prison for a long time.
[01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:35.878]  They want you scared.
[01:15:35.878 --> 01:15:37.420]  They don't want you to go out and vote.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.522]  They want people scared before it's time to vote.
[01:15:39.522 --> 01:15:41.304]  And that's why all this is happening right now.
[01:15:57.892 --> 01:15:59.173]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:15:59.173 --> 01:16:00.114]  I thought it was next week.
[01:16:00.114 --> 01:16:04.537]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[01:16:04.537 --> 01:16:06.759]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:16:06.759 --> 01:16:10.602]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[01:16:10.602 --> 01:16:12.503]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:16:12.503 --> 01:16:16.666]  Look how full this bottle is.
[01:16:16.666 --> 01:16:19.629]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:16:19.629 --> 01:16:22.371]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoids.
[01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:29.654]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[01:16:29.654 --> 01:16:31.655]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:16:31.655 --> 01:16:36.279]  This is 95%.
[01:16:36.279 --> 01:16:37.240]  Super constant.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.123]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:16:41.123 --> 01:16:42.585]  It's that powerful.
[01:16:42.585 --> 01:16:43.746]  Or more.
[01:16:43.746 --> 01:16:45.868]  So they're available at infoworksstore.com.
[01:16:47.407 --> 01:17:03.450]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:08.271]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:17:08.271 --> 01:17:10.712]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:17:11.312 --> 01:17:20.896]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[01:17:20.896 --> 01:17:24.138]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.

[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:32.642]  Strongest coffee that I have ever drank.

[01:17:58.015 --> 01:18:04.921]  Coffee has not been available at InfowarsTour.com for two years because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[01:18:04.921 --> 01:18:09.144]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[01:18:09.144 --> 01:18:13.368]  But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was blown away.
[01:18:13.368 --> 01:18:18.812]  We finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer available to you right now.
[01:18:18.812 --> 01:18:21.134]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[01:18:21.134 --> 01:18:22.115]  It smells amazing.
[01:18:22.455 --> 01:18:24.877]  And it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[01:18:24.877 --> 01:18:32.482]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single-source Colombian coffees are now available at Infowarshore.com exclusively.
[01:18:32.482 --> 01:18:34.844]  Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast.
[01:18:34.844 --> 01:18:35.704]  Tastes great.
[01:18:35.704 --> 01:18:36.905]  It's the strong one.
[01:18:36.905 --> 01:18:37.746]  Really strong.
[01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:39.587]  But these are all close second and thirds.
[01:18:39.587 --> 01:18:40.347]  Medium Roast.
[01:18:40.347 --> 01:18:41.028]  Wake of America.
[01:18:41.368 --> 01:18:42.289]  Woo!
[01:18:42.289 --> 01:18:43.630]  That's my go-to.
[01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:49.333]  Dark roast, tip of the spear, tastes the best, and is amazing, and is still very, very strong, gives you that pep.
[01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:56.278]  They're all three available at InfoWareStore.com, and they fund our operation, and each order gets a Pocket Constitution Citizen Rollbook.
[01:18:57.807 --> 01:19:04.572]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[01:19:04.572 --> 01:19:08.215]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented, amazing.
[01:19:08.215 --> 01:19:17.742]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of beet pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.
[01:19:17.742 --> 01:19:18.903]  It's about to sell out.
[01:19:18.903 --> 01:19:20.404]  We haven't had it in stock for years.

[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:14.130]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:18.073]  The man who stands tall against globalist agendas, Alex Jones.
[01:20:24.185 --> 01:20:25.626]  Um, you know, this is ridiculous.
[01:20:25.626 --> 01:20:28.567]  We went there that day with no plan, with nothing.
[01:20:28.567 --> 01:20:32.829]  We were there like every other American, but it's because we're a political group.
[01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:39.912]  You know, uh, we knew that there was going to be a hit on us as soon as, uh, Joe Biden mentioned us in the first presidential debate.
[01:20:39.912 --> 01:20:42.254]  I knew that there was something going on with this.
[01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:46.476]  And sure enough, even Enrique called it, um, they're going to put us in chains.
[01:20:46.476 --> 01:20:53.779]  And sure enough, they have, um, you know, we went through a long, drawn out trial, five months and not once.
[01:20:54.366 --> 01:20:57.067]  Did the FBI ever have proof of a plan?
[01:20:57.067 --> 01:20:59.048]  There was no intelligence of a plan?
[01:20:59.048 --> 01:21:02.809]  Not one of the rats that came forward said that there was a plan?
[01:21:02.809 --> 01:21:08.892]  Everyone said that there was zero plan of anything happening that day by us.
[01:21:08.892 --> 01:21:17.856]  And yet they got us for conspiracy to plan this, they said we had this meeting of the minds without ever actually saying anything.
[01:21:17.856 --> 01:21:21.157]  And it happened on the fly at the first breach.
[01:21:21.909 --> 01:21:33.176]  So apparently we all had this telekinesis power, we all agreed that from there on out when this first fence went down and everyone walked forward, that we were all going to stop the certification of the election and that's what they
[01:21:34.386 --> 01:21:43.392]  Got the jury to say, and the jury would have convicted us of sorcery and witchcraft and murder if that was up to vote on.
[01:21:43.392 --> 01:21:44.232]  Well, Joe, you're right.
[01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:49.076]  This is the Salem Witch Trials 10.0, and what do you make of Ray Epps?
[01:21:49.076 --> 01:21:57.181]  He was there actually saying, go into Capitol and picking up signs and ramming into police, but he's the little darling that must be protected.
[01:21:57.181 --> 01:22:01.064]  Well, this is the interesting thing about the trial.
[01:22:01.064 --> 01:22:02.585]  They altered evidence.
[01:22:03.888 --> 01:22:08.332]  You know, there was witness tampering, there was witness intimidation by the FBI.
[01:22:08.332 --> 01:22:12.156]  They rigged this to a point where we had nothing that we could do.
[01:22:12.156 --> 01:22:19.323]  They only allowed in a video of a fence that goes down in front of me, or in my area.
[01:22:19.323 --> 01:22:28.331]  And there's no video of me breaking the fence, there's a video of my hand on the fence, then my hand comes off the fence, and then later on the fence breaks after other people have grabbed it and ripped it.
[01:22:29.557 --> 01:22:31.679]  They only show that video, the real video.
[01:22:31.679 --> 01:22:33.740]  Hey, well they charged Owen.
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:36.603]  Owen is up for sentencing in two weeks.
[01:22:36.603 --> 01:22:39.865]  One of your fellow reporters and friends.
[01:22:39.865 --> 01:22:42.988]  And they said he should have known the fences had been knocked down.
[01:22:42.988 --> 01:22:45.630]  So just because he walked onto the property they charged him.
[01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:47.651]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:22:47.651 --> 01:22:56.859]  So the fence actually goes down in front of Ray F. But the video that the government gets to be allowed in, and the judge allows in, shows a green glitch.
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:06.725]  Where the fence goes down first, you can't see all the people rushing up on the stage, and it only shows the fence breaking around the area that we're standing at, me and my buddy.
[01:23:06.725 --> 01:23:14.468]  So, it glitches out the part where it's in front of Ray Epps, where all the people are surging, and then they go in front of the judge and go, look, see, these guys are the first ones that broke it.
[01:23:14.468 --> 01:23:20.211]  These guys are the ones that broke the fence and led the charge to the Capitol, and that is not the truth.
[01:23:20.211 --> 01:23:23.933]  That is not what happened, and videos will come out.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:29.943]  This is insane, and they want to take me and put me in jail for the rest of my life.
[01:23:29.943 --> 01:23:32.184]  I'm about to turn 40, 17 years.
[01:23:32.184 --> 01:23:33.825]  I mean, really, what am I going to do when I get out?
[01:23:33.825 --> 01:23:35.926]  This is insane.
[01:23:35.926 --> 01:23:37.507]  There's no way that this can stick.
[01:23:37.507 --> 01:23:38.527]  This is a travesty.
[01:23:38.527 --> 01:23:45.031]  To say that the shaking of a fence, my putting a hand on a fence, is tantamount to terrorism.
[01:23:45.031 --> 01:23:47.732]  They're putting me in the same category as Osama bin Laden.
[01:23:49.869 --> 01:23:55.653]  So obviously you're going to appeal this, but let's talk about how we support you and your daughter and your family.
[01:23:55.653 --> 01:23:59.396]  FreeJoeBiggs.com, and I'm told you've only got 15 minutes until they cut you off.
[01:23:59.396 --> 01:24:02.538]  Are you going to be able to call back in, or how does that work?
[01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:08.303]  Yeah, yeah, I'm sitting right here guarding this phone like my life depends on it, so no one's getting over here and no one's going to mess with me.
[01:24:08.303 --> 01:24:11.745]  No one messes with Joe Biggs and his place anyways.
[01:24:11.745 --> 01:24:15.608]  Do people see through the fact that you're a political prisoner?
[01:24:17.276 --> 01:24:18.657]  Everywhere I go, I can tell you this.
[01:24:18.657 --> 01:24:22.039]  Everywhere I go, people are praying for me.
[01:24:22.039 --> 01:24:26.661]  Every officer I meet puts their head down and they go, I can't believe this is happening to you, son.
[01:24:26.661 --> 01:24:27.842]  Every U.S.
[01:24:27.842 --> 01:24:28.803]  Marshal has done that.
[01:24:28.803 --> 01:24:34.606]  The only people who don't give a flying, you know, F about what's happening to me are the people that are in the FBI, for the most part.
[01:24:34.606 --> 01:24:44.192]  There are some good, I'm not going to get you wrong, but the FBI, for the most part, those are the evil, stinky, you know, conniving scoundrels that want to just see us thrown in jail for the rest of our life.
[01:24:44.192 --> 01:24:44.832]  But the U.S.
[01:24:44.832 --> 01:24:46.413]  Marshals, the Air Marshals, the police,
[01:24:46.812 --> 01:24:53.475]  The sheriff, the people at every jail I've been to, everybody comes up to me and shakes my hand and goes, this is crazy what's happening to you.
[01:24:53.475 --> 01:24:54.555]  This isn't right.
[01:24:54.555 --> 01:24:55.455]  We can't believe this.
[01:24:55.455 --> 01:24:57.676]  The prisoners even come up to us with respect.
[01:24:57.676 --> 01:25:02.418]  The black gang members, they all come up to us and go, man, we can't believe this is happening and we hope Trump wins.
[01:25:02.418 --> 01:25:04.739]  We hope he pardons you because you don't deserve to be here.
[01:25:04.739 --> 01:25:06.059]  You're not a criminal.
[01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:08.820]  Well, it's the arrogance of the globalists that has done this.
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:13.202]  And have you not seen your support supercharged, I'm guessing, since all the indictments against Trump?
[01:25:15.966 --> 01:25:18.067]  It's hard to see with the support in here.
[01:25:18.067 --> 01:25:22.048]  I'm limited on what it is I can and can't see, but I hear about it.
[01:25:22.048 --> 01:25:23.588]  I get messages and stuff like that.
[01:25:23.588 --> 01:25:27.609]  I hear that there is support, but it's really hard.
[01:25:27.609 --> 01:25:31.250]  They really constrict what I'm able to see from inside.
[01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:32.370]  Where are you right now?
[01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:34.391]  Where are you going?
[01:25:34.391 --> 01:25:35.931]  Obviously, you need money for appeal.
[01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:37.171]  People say, we're always asking for money.
[01:25:37.171 --> 01:25:38.932]  Yeah, we're in a war against the clubless, folks.
[01:25:38.932 --> 01:25:40.172]  How do people support you, Joe?
[01:25:41.687 --> 01:25:42.847]  Well, right now I'm at the D.C.
[01:25:42.847 --> 01:25:45.168]  Jail, what a lot of people call the D.C.
[01:25:45.168 --> 01:25:45.729]  Gulag.
[01:25:45.729 --> 01:25:50.571]  This is the one spot that had a, you know, were treating prisoners bad at one point.
[01:25:50.571 --> 01:25:57.113]  Owen said when he was there that he would wake up and literally covered in roaches eating his skin.
[01:25:57.113 --> 01:26:00.375]  Yeah, that's how it was in the building where they first originally had people.
[01:26:00.375 --> 01:26:03.496]  Now we're in what's called the CTF, and it's a lot nicer.
[01:26:03.496 --> 01:26:05.577]  It's not as bad, but the food is horrible.
[01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:07.157]  Like, you can't eat the food here.
[01:26:07.157 --> 01:26:10.719]  It is not edible in any kind of way whatsoever.
[01:26:11.378 --> 01:26:16.182]  Um, you know, to your second point, if you really want to help out, you know, I need money to help support my daughter.
[01:26:16.182 --> 01:26:19.645]  You know, they have taken away my military retirement.
[01:26:19.645 --> 01:26:21.827]  It's as if I never even served in the military.
[01:26:21.827 --> 01:26:24.769]  Uh, you know, the prosecutor gets up and starts, you know, before sentencing.
[01:26:24.769 --> 01:26:31.074]  He goes, I just want everybody to know that I don't want to take away from Joe Biggs the fact that he's an American hero and that he served our country, but...
[01:26:31.843 --> 01:26:34.924]  Basically him touching that fence is tantamount to terrorism.
[01:26:34.924 --> 01:26:40.906]  Um, his hand touching that fence was the same as an explosion going off and sending shrapnel through bodies and killing people.
[01:26:40.906 --> 01:26:41.786]  Um, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:26:41.786 --> 01:26:44.887]  And the judge has now said that in the Trump January 6th case.
[01:26:44.887 --> 01:26:48.608]  She compared it to 9-11 and the Boston bombing.
[01:26:48.608 --> 01:26:49.228]  Yeah.
[01:26:49.228 --> 01:26:51.289]  So if you really want to help me out, I need the help.
[01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:53.970]  I got, I mean, the pills case, it takes years.
[01:26:53.970 --> 01:26:56.131]  You know, I'm not getting out anytime soon.
[01:26:56.131 --> 01:27:00.472]  Um, I've already been in for three years almost, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm about to come up with my three years.
[01:27:00.879 --> 01:27:07.283]  Of that three years, I've been in solitary confinement for a year and a half.
[01:27:07.283 --> 01:27:09.424]  Praise be to God that I haven't lost my mind from that.
[01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:14.787]  Everybody wonders how I can still keep my sanity and how I'm still able to communicate with people.
[01:27:14.787 --> 01:27:20.270]  Well, I saw the left make fun of you that you cried when they said 17 years.
[01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:27.774]  But, I mean, obviously you're not 17 years and you've been given this evil tyranny and can't see your daughter.
[01:27:27.774 --> 01:27:28.854]  I would cry too.
[01:27:28.854 --> 01:27:30.195]  They are sick, evil people.
[01:27:31.055 --> 01:27:31.796]  Well, actually, no.
[01:27:31.796 --> 01:27:34.077]  The 17 years came after the fact that I cried.
[01:27:34.077 --> 01:27:35.359]  I cried when I brought up my daughter.
[01:27:35.359 --> 01:27:38.541]  But the tears that I had were from my daughter and my daughter alone.
[01:27:38.541 --> 01:27:42.324]  Not anything that the judge had to say to the prosecution.
[01:27:42.324 --> 01:27:48.129]  After I spoke and I had, you know, I had gotten emotional about my daughter, I sat down and that's when the judge read the 17 years.
[01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:50.831]  Oh, so they even spun that, that you cried after the sentence.
[01:27:50.831 --> 01:27:52.833]  You cried for your daughter.
[01:27:52.833 --> 01:27:53.994]  Yeah, I cried for my daughter.
[01:27:53.994 --> 01:27:54.494]  That was it.
[01:27:54.494 --> 01:27:56.035]  There was no anybody in that courtroom.
[01:27:56.035 --> 01:27:56.876]  I got letters today.
[01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.900]  And it was emotional to hear you talk about your daughter.
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.300]  It had nothing to do with the sentencing.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:03.081]  I sat there and took that like a man.
[01:28:03.081 --> 01:28:08.425]  I looked at him and did whatever I had to do, you know, and I walked out of there with my head held high, and I'm going to continue to fight.
[01:28:08.425 --> 01:28:12.087]  It just shows, Joe, they lie about everything, don't they?
[01:28:12.087 --> 01:28:12.967]  Yeah, of course.
[01:28:12.967 --> 01:28:16.890]  We saw an article on our little prison tablet they gave us last night.
[01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:19.852]  It was on Yahoo saying that Proud Boys cry at trial.
[01:28:19.852 --> 01:28:22.213]  Not one of us cried about anything like that.
[01:28:22.213 --> 01:28:27.056]  It was only when we brought up the fact the guys of us who have kids, which is most of us except for one of us, I think,
[01:28:27.543 --> 01:28:37.226]  When we brought up our children, or saw our children in the pews, we got teary-eyed to think about that, to know that our children aren't going to see us again for a long time.
[01:28:37.226 --> 01:28:42.268]  From here, you know, go to FreeJoeBinks.com, help out.
[01:28:42.268 --> 01:28:47.909]  That money goes either to my appeals, or it goes to my mother and daughter to help out.
[01:28:47.909 --> 01:28:49.950]  I don't get any of this personally in any kind of way.
[01:28:57.194 --> 01:29:04.018]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good news.
[01:29:04.018 --> 01:29:09.201]  Because it's a great product you love, and people want it, and it funds our operation of 360WIN.

[01:29:11.543 --> 01:29:13.044]  The strongest you're going to find anywhere.
[01:29:13.644 --> 01:29:20.548]  Jam-packed, a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation, that empowers your neurological system.
[01:29:20.548 --> 01:29:21.048]  You name it.
[01:29:21.048 --> 01:29:23.069]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[01:29:23.069 --> 01:29:24.330]  God gave it to us.
[01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:26.511]  And it's the strongest curcuminoid out there.
[01:29:26.511 --> 01:29:29.973]  Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid.
[01:29:29.973 --> 01:29:32.315]  Most brands are 5% curcumidin.
[01:29:32.315 --> 01:29:34.596]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[01:29:34.596 --> 01:29:38.038]  This is the strongest anybody makes.
[01:29:38.038 --> 01:29:39.559]  95% curcuminoid.
[01:29:39.559 --> 01:29:40.919]  I am so glad this is back.
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:43.961]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[01:29:43.961 --> 01:29:46.883]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[01:29:46.883 --> 01:29:48.663]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.

[01:29:53.986 --> 01:29:59.229]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:29:59.229 --> 01:30:00.189]  I thought it was next week.
[01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:04.592]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[01:30:04.592 --> 01:30:06.833]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:30:06.833 --> 01:30:09.014]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[01:30:10.666 --> 01:30:12.549]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:30:12.549 --> 01:30:16.714]  Look how full this bottle is.
[01:30:16.714 --> 01:30:19.658]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:30:19.658 --> 01:30:22.281]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoid.
[01:30:25.501 --> 01:30:29.704]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[01:30:29.704 --> 01:30:31.705]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:30:31.705 --> 01:30:36.329]  This is 95%.
[01:30:36.329 --> 01:30:37.289]  Super constant.
[01:30:37.289 --> 01:30:41.172]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:30:41.172 --> 01:30:42.633]  It's that powerful.
[01:30:42.633 --> 01:30:43.794]  Or more.
[01:30:43.794 --> 01:30:45.936]  So they're available at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:33:09.534 --> 01:33:12.698]  The Patriots Choice and Globalists Dread.
[01:33:12.698 --> 01:33:15.281]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.281 --> 01:33:19.426]  Go to JoeFreeJoeBanks.com, you know, help out.
[01:33:19.426 --> 01:33:25.092]  That money goes either to my appeals or it goes to my mother and daughter to help out.
[01:33:25.092 --> 01:33:27.115]  I don't get any of this personally in any kind of way.
[01:33:27.925 --> 01:33:29.707]  It's not going to help me.
[01:33:29.707 --> 01:33:30.748]  We know that.
[01:33:30.748 --> 01:33:32.850]  You don't need to put a proviso.
[01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:34.411]  I think your goal is too low.
[01:33:34.411 --> 01:33:37.574]  I know how these appeals work.
[01:33:37.574 --> 01:33:42.799]  It's going to cost a million bucks over the next few years for your appeal alone, and you're only asking for $75,000.
[01:33:42.799 --> 01:33:49.285]  Well, yeah, that was when we first had it.
[01:33:49.285 --> 01:33:54.069]  But yeah, we're going to re-up that and change some stuff and redo some of the wording on it and ask for more.
[01:33:55.025 --> 01:33:58.828]  That was just from, I've had this up for a little while.
[01:33:58.828 --> 01:34:00.009]  Well, you're a great guy, brother.
[01:34:00.009 --> 01:34:04.353]  I know they're about to hang up on you in a minute, but just say as much as you want before they disconnect you.
[01:34:04.353 --> 01:34:07.335]  Well, I will say this.
[01:34:07.335 --> 01:34:09.877]  The next place I'm going to, I put in for Coleman Lowe.
[01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:11.098]  That's in Florida.
[01:34:11.098 --> 01:34:14.000]  That's the same spot they sent Martha Stewart to.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.861]  Obviously not the female wing.
[01:34:15.861 --> 01:34:17.723]  I'm sure that'd be a lot more fun.
[01:34:17.723 --> 01:34:20.565]  But they're sending me to possibly the Coleman Lowe.
[01:34:21.318 --> 01:34:23.501]  Uh, which is somewhere in Florida, north of Orlando.
[01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:27.926]  Well just say you're a woman, you can be in the female way.
[01:34:27.926 --> 01:34:30.970]  I think a few of us have tried that already and they look at us like we're crazy.
[01:34:30.970 --> 01:34:36.577]  I think, uh, you know, I think unless you have Democrat on your voting card, they don't believe it.
[01:34:36.577 --> 01:34:38.179]  They'll just think that you're playing around.
[01:34:40.069 --> 01:34:42.430]  Well, it's good to hear you with so much humor.
[01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:45.270]  And we just keep asking listeners for help because they're coming out to everybody, folks.
[01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:46.491]  We're here on the front line.
[01:34:46.491 --> 01:34:47.991]  We're in a war for everybody.
[01:34:47.991 --> 01:34:49.171]  And we're not complaining at listeners.
[01:34:49.171 --> 01:34:55.213]  But if you don't support FreeJoeBiggs.com, then, you know, then you're supporting your own destruction.
[01:34:55.213 --> 01:34:58.454]  Yeah, I mean, first they came after me for shaking a fence.
[01:34:58.454 --> 01:34:59.414]  What next is it?
[01:34:59.898 --> 01:35:05.622]  You know, what's the next thing that's going to happen that they're going to say is tantamount to terrorism?
[01:35:05.622 --> 01:35:08.743]  Um, you know, they blamed me for the very first breach.
[01:35:08.743 --> 01:35:13.987]  The judge looked me in the eye and said, you have one minute remaining.
[01:35:13.987 --> 01:35:16.048]  I was using a bullhorn.
[01:35:16.048 --> 01:35:19.530]  Further back, there was a guy in front of me close to the gate where Ray Epps was.
[01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:31.778]  We call him Black Megaphone Guy because we don't know his name, but he was sitting there telling everybody, the men come to the front, get the women out of the front, we need to take the fence down, we need to push forward, we need to go after the cops, we need to get through.
[01:35:31.778 --> 01:35:38.264]  I've seen the videos, the left showed up dressed up like Trump supporters with the DC police and they did it all and it's incredible.
[01:35:38.264 --> 01:35:40.545]  Alright, they're about to disconnect you Joe.
[01:35:40.545 --> 01:35:43.788]  FreeJoeBiggs.com, you're going to call us back in 15 minutes?
[01:35:43.788 --> 01:35:44.849]  Yes I am, I will be.
[01:35:44.849 --> 01:35:46.330]  Alright, keep talking till the end.
[01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:48.532]  Keep talking, keep talking.
[01:35:49.383 --> 01:35:51.565]  Well, like I said, I appreciate everybody's help, man.
[01:35:51.565 --> 01:35:54.807]  Like, go there, help us out, and we would appreciate it.
[01:35:54.807 --> 01:36:02.812]  You know, it's interesting to see how the government has spun this entire situation.
[01:36:02.812 --> 01:36:04.013]  They have lied.
[01:36:04.013 --> 01:36:05.854]  They lied to the American people.
[01:36:05.854 --> 01:36:07.415]  The media helped it.
[01:36:07.415 --> 01:36:15.761]  The media sat there day in and day out and refused to report on the facts that we brought up during our trial, and only... Thank you for using Global Telling.
[01:36:19.648 --> 01:36:25.569]  Ruthless lawyers, ruthless Larry Fink, BlackRock, just ordering destruction of everything.
[01:36:25.569 --> 01:36:40.613]  No borders, human trafficking, fentanyl, pedophilia with children, world government, World War III with Russia, sellout to China, political prisoners, total surveillance, censorship.
[01:36:40.613 --> 01:36:49.035]  And they've got all these yes-men and women that are
[01:36:55.458 --> 01:36:57.760]  Just going along with her own destruction.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:03.124]  You know, a lot of listeners have asked me, where is Stuart Rhodes?
[01:37:03.124 --> 01:37:07.328]  Been trying to get him for a year.
[01:37:07.328 --> 01:37:10.530]  Where's Joe Biggs?
[01:37:10.530 --> 01:37:13.913]  I have the same lawyer as Joe Biggs.
[01:37:13.913 --> 01:37:20.498]  And the calculus was, it'll make the judge mad if you're on air attacking him.
[01:37:20.498 --> 01:37:23.901]  And that's why.
[01:37:25.401 --> 01:37:27.021]  And then listeners are like, why aren't you talking about it?
[01:37:27.021 --> 01:37:30.402]  Well, I've been trying since he got sentenced to get him on.
[01:37:30.402 --> 01:37:31.502]  It took us two days.
[01:37:31.502 --> 01:37:32.883]  He's here.
[01:37:32.883 --> 01:37:35.263]  And you can say, well, just don't listen to the lawyers.
[01:37:35.263 --> 01:37:41.385]  I mean, it's his lawyer, Norm Pattis, and I get Norm's point.
[01:37:41.385 --> 01:37:46.866]  And so all I can do is comply with what people want.
[01:37:47.807 --> 01:37:52.609]  Because it's not my life, it's Joe's life, it's his lawyer, it's what they decided to do.
[01:37:52.609 --> 01:37:54.949]  So we'll have Joe on all the time when he's able to call in now.
[01:37:54.949 --> 01:38:00.251]  I've been trying to get, you know, they're like, well, just, we want to piss people off and maybe that's the wrong strategy.
[01:38:00.251 --> 01:38:01.532]  I'm the type of guy that's going to talk crap.
[01:38:01.532 --> 01:38:03.612]  You saw me with these judges in my show trials.
[01:38:03.612 --> 01:38:04.853]  I say, you're a crook.
[01:38:04.853 --> 01:38:06.593]  You're a tyrant.
[01:38:06.593 --> 01:38:08.254]  Because they're liars.
[01:38:08.254 --> 01:38:10.155]  The judge is like, he's got $400 million.
[01:38:10.155 --> 01:38:12.155]  I'm like, you're a liar.
[01:38:12.155 --> 01:38:16.017]  He's like, no, jury, he's a liar.
[01:38:16.017 --> 01:38:16.717]  No, you're a liar.
[01:38:21.078 --> 01:38:24.039]  And so, that's where we're at.
[01:38:24.039 --> 01:38:26.420]  But now, boom.
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:28.441]  We're going to get Norm on too about this.
[01:38:28.441 --> 01:38:33.703]  His lawyer, who's also been my lawyer, who's a famous criminal lawyer and a good guy.
[01:38:33.703 --> 01:38:36.284]  People say, oh, your lawyer did a terrible job at standing trial.
[01:38:36.284 --> 01:38:37.884]  They didn't let us talk.
[01:38:37.884 --> 01:38:42.206]  They gave our lawyers a list of like five things you could talk about for a show trial.
[01:38:42.206 --> 01:38:43.867]  I was already found guilty.
[01:38:43.867 --> 01:38:45.467]  They just found Giuliani guilty.
[01:38:45.467 --> 01:38:47.308]  A judge did.
[01:38:47.308 --> 01:38:49.409]  People are like, well, judges don't find you guilty.
[01:38:50.475 --> 01:38:52.277]  Folks, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:38:52.277 --> 01:38:57.542]  Have you figured that out yet?
[01:38:57.542 --> 01:39:00.985]  So, during the five-month trial, I'm like, hey, I really want him on.
[01:39:00.985 --> 01:39:01.685]  I want Joe on.
[01:39:01.685 --> 01:39:02.266]  I want you on.
[01:39:02.266 --> 01:39:03.307]  I want to support him.
[01:39:03.307 --> 01:39:07.511]  And they're like, listen, we think there's some humanity in this judge.
[01:39:07.511 --> 01:39:10.674]  And he's totally innocent, so we don't want to antagonize him.
[01:39:10.674 --> 01:39:14.177]  So we want to just try to, you know, see if they've got, and they don't have humanity.
[01:39:15.993 --> 01:39:18.295]  So now I can talk about it.
[01:39:18.295 --> 01:39:20.356]  And you're like, well, you should have talked about it.
[01:39:20.356 --> 01:39:23.819]  All I can do is honor people that are in jail and do what they want.
[01:39:23.819 --> 01:39:26.441]  I'm not going to sit there and make your decisions for them.
[01:39:26.441 --> 01:39:28.442]  And plus, what does it do saying the judge is a crook?
[01:39:28.442 --> 01:39:29.123]  They love it.
[01:39:29.123 --> 01:39:30.284]  They'll be promoted.
[01:39:30.284 --> 01:39:31.565]  They'll be out playing.
[01:39:31.565 --> 01:39:33.346]  The judge is probably playing golf today.
[01:39:33.346 --> 01:39:34.727]  Feels great.
[01:39:34.727 --> 01:39:36.668]  Has no sense of injustice.
[01:39:36.668 --> 01:39:39.550]  Rebs can run around and say, attack the Capitol, go in the Capitol.
[01:39:39.550 --> 01:39:40.331]  I orchestrated it.
[01:39:40.331 --> 01:39:41.452]  He said in his text messages.
[01:39:43.939 --> 01:39:45.519]  He's ramming signs into police.
[01:39:45.519 --> 01:39:49.681]  Joe Beggs is like shaking a fence.
[01:39:49.681 --> 01:39:51.321]  17 years, bitch.
[01:39:51.321 --> 01:39:53.802]  After three years in jail.
[01:39:53.802 --> 01:39:56.102]  Year and a half in solitary confinement.
[01:39:56.102 --> 01:40:02.524]  I mean, it's just like... And you're around these people and you get... But I'll tell you the unifying thing about them.
[01:40:02.524 --> 01:40:07.665]  Leftists and their minions are dishonorable, cowardly nobodies.
[01:40:07.665 --> 01:40:09.526]  And the world's waking up to them.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:14.201]  The thing is, they're such crap that I don't even wish harm on them.
[01:40:14.201 --> 01:40:16.961]  I just want them to get out of my life, leave me alone, go away.
[01:40:16.961 --> 01:40:20.222]  Well, they're not gonna go away.
[01:40:20.222 --> 01:40:22.462]  And they're not gonna leave everybody alone.
[01:40:22.462 --> 01:40:23.883]  But listeners should use their heads.
[01:40:23.883 --> 01:40:24.663]  It's not about me.
[01:40:24.663 --> 01:40:25.563]  It's not about Joe Biggs.
[01:40:25.563 --> 01:40:27.884]  It's about understanding things.
[01:40:27.884 --> 01:40:35.465]  It probably was smart to not have Joe Biggs on my show a bunch while he was facing this kangaroo trial.
[01:40:35.465 --> 01:40:37.566]  Because I get, you know, I think Norm's right.
[01:40:37.566 --> 01:40:39.046]  I think if Joe had talked crap,
[01:40:40.475 --> 01:40:43.336]  And they'd all been on the show talking schmack.
[01:40:43.336 --> 01:40:47.257]  That judge, you hit him on what the feds asked for.
[01:40:47.257 --> 01:40:53.779]  45 years in prison.
[01:40:53.779 --> 01:40:54.939]  Because the left likes it.
[01:40:54.939 --> 01:40:58.500]  They're like, oh, you don't like us putting you in jail?
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.820]  Cockroaches all over you?
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:00.621]  Well, guess what?
[01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:01.141]  You get 45, bitch.
[01:41:07.022 --> 01:41:09.063]  But I just love the other Patriots that are out there.
[01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:10.783]  They're like, armchair quarterback.
[01:41:10.783 --> 01:41:15.885]  Why isn't Alex Jones, and it's on so many subjects, why isn't Alex Jones having them on?
[01:41:15.885 --> 01:41:20.806]  Why, he doesn't care about those people.
[01:41:20.806 --> 01:41:25.608]  One former talk show host that worked here, who just kept saying I was censoring when I wasn't.
[01:41:25.608 --> 01:41:27.868]  I was really upset that he was lying and saying I was censoring.
[01:41:27.868 --> 01:41:29.669]  I never even, barely even watched the show.
[01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:31.129]  I'm like, why are you saying that?
[01:41:31.129 --> 01:41:32.850]  Oh, he doesn't care about his crew.
[01:41:32.850 --> 01:41:33.810]  He's sent there.
[01:41:33.810 --> 01:41:35.170]  I didn't send Joe Biggs there.
[01:41:35.170 --> 01:41:36.411]  Joe Biggs hasn't worked here for years.
[01:41:37.461 --> 01:41:41.043]  I didn't send anybody into the damn Capitol.
[01:41:41.043 --> 01:41:44.105]  But Joe didn't do anything in the Capitol.
[01:41:44.105 --> 01:41:51.529]  So the idea that I'm sending people and I'm doing this and I'm all this crap, it's ridiculous.
[01:41:51.529 --> 01:41:53.010]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:41:53.010 --> 01:41:58.433]  Because it's not about me, it's not about any of this, it's about the big picture.
[01:41:58.433 --> 01:42:03.596]  People sit back in their armchairs and they think they know how stuff works and they don't.
[01:42:05.029 --> 01:42:09.152]  Now Joe's scheduled to call in in about 7-8 minutes.
[01:42:09.152 --> 01:42:09.772]  So let's do this.
[01:42:09.772 --> 01:42:15.676]  Let's air Greg Reese's new report and some other little important promo pieces.
[01:42:15.676 --> 01:42:19.219]  And then Joe should be able to get back in in about 6-7-8 minutes.
[01:42:19.219 --> 01:42:19.959]  We'll go to him.
[01:42:19.959 --> 01:42:23.282]  I guess technically 8 minutes from now I'll be able to call in.
[01:42:23.282 --> 01:42:29.246]  And then I promise to do a deep dive on the ADL.
[01:42:29.246 --> 01:42:30.206]  And I promise to
[01:42:31.601 --> 01:42:35.704]  Hit some of this other news and so I'm going to do that and I'm going to do it more tomorrow night too.
[01:42:35.704 --> 01:42:37.025]  4 to 6 p.m.
[01:42:37.025 --> 01:42:42.669]  MTG is going to be in studio and a lot more so look for that.
[01:42:42.669 --> 01:42:58.020]  But I appreciate the crew coming in on Saturday and I appreciate General Flynn being here and I appreciate everybody else that's supporting the show and spreading the word because we're in the situation we're in and the globalists aren't going to go away without major opposition.
[01:42:58.490 --> 01:43:04.134]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God, through Mother Nature, has given us the answer.
[01:43:04.134 --> 01:43:14.761]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous system particularly.
[01:43:14.761 --> 01:43:16.803]  Everybody knows it's incredible, it works.
[01:43:16.803 --> 01:43:21.886]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[01:43:21.886 --> 01:43:24.788]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more
[01:43:26.653 --> 01:43:28.415]  Because that's who we're getting it from.
[01:43:28.415 --> 01:43:31.118]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[01:43:31.118 --> 01:43:34.762]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[01:43:34.762 --> 01:43:40.368]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[01:43:40.368 --> 01:43:43.171]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[01:43:43.171 --> 01:43:44.272]  And yours was even crazier.
[01:43:44.993 --> 01:43:46.934]  30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:43:46.934 --> 01:43:50.196]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[01:43:50.196 --> 01:43:54.558]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[01:43:54.558 --> 01:43:55.339]  Rebels In.
[01:43:55.339 --> 01:43:58.340]  Get yours at InfoWarsStore.com now.
[01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:00.982]  InfoWarsStore.com is like a grocery store.
[01:44:01.502 --> 01:44:03.043]  Or like a vitamin shop.
[01:44:03.043 --> 01:44:05.105]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:44:05.105 --> 01:44:07.046]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:44:07.046 --> 01:44:09.528]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:44:09.528 --> 01:44:10.349]  Hey, what's better?
[01:44:10.349 --> 01:44:11.209]  Knockout.
[01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:12.550]  What's better?
[01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:13.291]  Down and out.
[01:44:13.291 --> 01:44:13.811]  What's better?
[01:44:13.811 --> 01:44:16.073]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:44:16.073 --> 01:44:21.017]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:44:21.698 --> 01:44:25.663]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:44:25.663 --> 01:44:27.004]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:44:27.004 --> 01:44:28.306]  They're all very diverse.
[01:44:28.306 --> 01:44:38.497]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.
[01:44:39.238 --> 01:44:44.844]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.
[01:44:44.844 --> 01:44:49.388]  And it's in stock, available right now, of 25% off, out of the gates.

[01:44:58.277 --> 01:45:13.207]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:45:13.647 --> 01:45:15.328]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:45:15.328 --> 01:45:18.309]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:45:18.309 --> 01:45:19.950]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:24.873]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[01:45:24.873 --> 01:45:26.594]  This is something you need now.
[01:45:26.594 --> 01:45:31.176]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[01:45:31.176 --> 01:45:36.899]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[01:45:36.899 --> 01:45:43.062]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water.
[01:45:43.422 --> 01:45:44.804]  And air filtration.
[01:45:44.804 --> 01:45:47.468]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:45:47.468 --> 01:45:48.769]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[01:45:48.769 --> 01:45:51.653]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:45:51.653 --> 01:45:55.559]  Go to nfowarstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[01:45:58.575 --> 01:46:05.341]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[01:46:05.341 --> 01:46:08.984]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.
[01:46:08.984 --> 01:46:18.492]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of beet pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.
[01:46:18.492 --> 01:46:19.673]  It's about to sell out.
[01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:21.095]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[01:46:21.095 --> 01:46:23.096]  This first new run is about to sell out.
[01:46:23.096 --> 01:46:24.117]  Get it discounted right now.

[01:46:47.441 --> 01:46:49.743]  Go to MFONEWORTHSTORE.COM right now.
[01:46:49.743 --> 01:46:52.125]  We're selling out ultimate bone broth.
[01:46:52.725 --> 01:46:55.086]  And now for the truth only you can handle.
[01:46:55.086 --> 01:46:56.827]  It's the Alex Jones Show with Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.511 --> 01:47:23.314]  Here's Harari saying, we're gonna make aliens on Earth.
[01:47:23.314 --> 01:47:28.197]  We're gonna merge the machines and be a new life form, a new ruling alien class on Earth.
[01:47:28.197 --> 01:47:30.359]  See, they're building the aliens.
[01:47:30.359 --> 01:47:33.221]  The biomedical AI merger with our flesh.
[01:47:33.221 --> 01:47:34.842]  The raping of humanity.
[01:47:34.842 --> 01:47:37.084]  It's the same story from Roswell in the late 40s.
[01:47:37.084 --> 01:47:42.047]  With Colonel Corso, heavily promoted everywhere by the biggest publishers, by the biggest movie makers.
[01:47:42.047 --> 01:47:43.748]  That was system funded.
[01:47:43.748 --> 01:47:47.451]  Because they don't want you to understand the full spectrum of interdimensional contact.
[01:47:47.751 --> 01:47:53.852]  And the fact that it's always been here, and these things actually aren't alien, they're part of our existence and part of our story here.
[01:47:53.852 --> 01:47:57.073]  And it is the aliens, it's us, put here on this planet by God.
[01:47:57.073 --> 01:47:59.193]  And there's these things that were already basically here.
[01:47:59.193 --> 01:48:03.254]  We've probably not been here as long as this thing's been here, if you really read the ancient texts of the Bible.
[01:48:03.254 --> 01:48:06.695]  So they don't want you to know it's far more complex, and they're not in control of it.
[01:48:06.695 --> 01:48:12.996]  All they're doing is being demonically inspired by these creatures that will only give them Hellraiser visions.
[01:48:12.996 --> 01:48:17.277]  It will only give them how to have technology for evil, because it doesn't like us.
[01:48:17.757 --> 01:48:22.081]  This is just a training camp where our father has put us here.
[01:48:22.081 --> 01:48:30.790]  We think we're only living on one life, so that we're in this super scared position, but having all these spiritual and ancestral, intergalactic, interdimensional memories.
[01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:34.694]  And it's all a giant, three-dimensional, real scenario war game.
[01:48:35.134 --> 01:48:36.675]  And they don't want you to know that.
[01:48:36.675 --> 01:48:39.137]  And they don't want you to understand they signed on to the wrong team.
[01:48:39.137 --> 01:48:46.021]  They joined with the destructive force, the evil force, so they could have power during the third-dimensional simulation?
[01:48:46.021 --> 01:48:49.703]  It's a three-dimensional, genetic, universal simulation.
[01:48:49.703 --> 01:48:50.864]  It's a real simulation.
[01:48:50.864 --> 01:48:52.305]  It's just that it's forever war.
[01:48:52.305 --> 01:48:53.986]  You don't die when you die.
[01:48:53.986 --> 01:48:56.988]  You're an electrochemical, multi-dimensional creature.
[01:48:56.988 --> 01:48:59.890]  This is only one lowest manifestation of you.
[01:48:59.890 --> 01:49:01.351]  You have glorified heavenly bodies.
[01:49:01.351 --> 01:49:03.732]  There's this first heaven, the second heaven, the third heaven.
[01:49:03.732 --> 01:49:04.513]  It's all right
[01:49:04.813 --> 01:49:05.774]  We're good to go.
[01:49:27.134 --> 01:49:37.378]  No, that's the globalists with their advanced technology playing games, so they can brand contact with the angels and God as the devil, when really, we're here with the devil.
[01:49:37.378 --> 01:49:39.759]  We're not locked in here with the devil, the devil's locked in here with us.
[01:49:39.759 --> 01:49:47.422]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[01:49:47.722 --> 01:49:53.531]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[01:49:53.531 --> 01:49:55.874]  The left have wised up to this.
[01:49:55.874 --> 01:50:01.282]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[01:50:01.282 --> 01:50:02.624]  The social media giants.
[01:50:02.624 --> 01:50:03.005]  And they are.
[01:50:03.365 --> 01:50:09.109]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:13.912]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[01:50:13.912 --> 01:50:18.295]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech.
[01:50:18.835 --> 01:50:21.657]  To silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[01:50:21.657 --> 01:50:27.743]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:50:27.743 --> 01:50:34.788]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[01:50:34.788 --> 01:50:44.597]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[01:50:45.197 --> 01:50:46.698]  People know what's true.
[01:50:46.698 --> 01:50:48.019]  They can smell it.
[01:50:48.019 --> 01:50:53.463]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:50:53.463 --> 01:50:55.825]  In a free country, everyone can be hurt.
[01:50:55.825 --> 01:50:59.087]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be hurt.
[01:51:02.309 --> 01:51:04.431]  It's a Saturday, emergency broadcast.
[01:51:04.431 --> 01:51:09.974]  General Flynn, myself, lay out the globalist's next move and how to stop them.
[01:51:09.974 --> 01:51:10.775]  Joe Biggs.
[01:51:10.775 --> 01:51:15.798]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:51:15.798 --> 01:51:17.379]  Locked up in the D.C.
[01:51:17.379 --> 01:51:20.421]  gulag.
[01:51:20.421 --> 01:51:22.762]  Can only get in 15 minutes at a time.
[01:51:22.762 --> 01:51:24.784]  You heard him about 15 minutes ago get cut off.
[01:51:24.784 --> 01:51:28.306]  We're waiting for his call again right now.
[01:51:29.645 --> 01:51:33.370]  The day we got Greenlit to get him on the show.
[01:51:33.370 --> 01:51:37.215]  Because again, the political persecutors attack you when you defend yourself.
[01:51:37.215 --> 01:51:40.419]  So now that he's sentenced, he's ready to come on the show.
[01:51:40.419 --> 01:51:42.963]  We want to get Stuart Rhodes on.
[01:51:42.963 --> 01:51:44.044]  All of them are political prisoners.
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:49.102]  Remember a few months ago, oh, Rams is going to be indicted, they said in a lawsuit against Fox.
[01:51:49.102 --> 01:51:50.383]  Didn't happen.
[01:51:50.383 --> 01:51:53.265]  They just create that illusion to get us to stop talking about it.
[01:51:53.265 --> 01:52:01.170]  Hey, all I know is he said he orchestrated it in his text messages and said go into the Capitol and help Ram signs into people and he says he'll sue you if you talk about it.
[01:52:01.170 --> 01:52:06.693]  And I'm sure they'll probably sue and have me defaulted and the judge says I'm guilty and $85 billion to him.
[01:52:06.693 --> 01:52:10.075]  So what?
[01:52:10.075 --> 01:52:10.596]  He did it.
[01:52:10.596 --> 01:52:11.816]  He said it.
[01:52:11.816 --> 01:52:12.417]  It's going on.
[01:52:12.417 --> 01:52:13.938]  I'm not going to shut up about any of it.
[01:52:15.319 --> 01:52:19.102]  But I want to thank everybody that's gone to DefendJones.com.
[01:52:19.102 --> 01:52:20.362]  Info wars have stabilized.
[01:52:20.362 --> 01:52:22.164]  The bankruptcy looks like it's going through.
[01:52:22.164 --> 01:52:23.505]  Everything I told the court was true.
[01:52:23.505 --> 01:52:25.246]  Everything that media said was a lie.
[01:52:25.246 --> 01:52:25.986]  You've seen all that.
[01:52:25.986 --> 01:52:28.568]  We don't have $10 million versus $400 million.
[01:52:28.568 --> 01:52:36.293]  And I've got a year of legal bills built up that I've gotten a really good crop of new lawyers last year.
[01:52:36.293 --> 01:52:38.115]  They haven't been paid yet.
[01:52:39.244 --> 01:52:41.607]  And that's because the judge got lied to and told that I had all this money.
[01:52:41.607 --> 01:52:42.909]  So the judge said, well, he can pay his legal bills.
[01:52:42.909 --> 01:52:44.812]  And now the judge is like, wait, he didn't have any money.
[01:52:44.812 --> 01:52:46.855]  But I still have the old bill.
[01:52:46.855 --> 01:52:48.177]  That's about to all get fixed.
[01:52:48.177 --> 01:52:51.041]  The judge has signaled where he now realizes he was lied to.
[01:52:51.041 --> 01:52:53.544]  But for now, I need to pay that million dollars.
[01:52:53.544 --> 01:52:54.566]  Like, that's a lot of money.
[01:52:55.046 --> 01:52:57.368]  Not really in today's numbers, folks, with inflation.
[01:52:57.368 --> 01:53:04.713]  Trump has spent $67 million this year on lawyers, with hundreds of lawsuits and all the rest of it, and all the criminal charges.
[01:53:04.713 --> 01:53:06.034]  Great, Trump needs support.
[01:53:06.034 --> 01:53:11.578]  Well, I don't need $67 million, I need a million dollars, or we go off the air.
[01:53:11.578 --> 01:53:14.220]  Because if they shut me down, I can't be here.
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:17.362]  Infowarsstore.com funds free speech systems, great products you need.
[01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:22.833]  But DefendJones.com is where you can make straight donations.
[01:53:22.833 --> 01:53:24.954]  And I want to thank the listeners for their support.
[01:53:24.954 --> 01:53:27.956]  I'm going to be thanking more of you tomorrow on the Sunday Show.
[01:53:27.956 --> 01:53:29.137]  But you know who you are.
[01:53:29.137 --> 01:53:31.218]  I think we've raised $60,000.
[01:53:31.218 --> 01:53:33.960]  We can put DefendJones.com on the screen.
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:39.144]  And I know I come to you and ask for your support.
[01:53:39.144 --> 01:53:40.324]  And my eyes aren't that good.
[01:53:40.324 --> 01:53:41.425]  What's the number there?
[01:53:41.425 --> 01:53:41.785]  That's $65,000.
[01:53:41.785 --> 01:53:42.746]  Sounds like a lot, folks.
[01:53:42.746 --> 01:53:43.526]  No, that's just 6%.
[01:53:49.622 --> 01:53:50.243]  I don't think so.
[01:54:07.097 --> 01:54:10.980]  So, Joe, I'm just going to give you the floor because I was interrupting earlier because it's good to hear your voice.
[01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:16.944]  I have a lot of questions, but you've got the floor to talk about the trial, what's coming next, the state of the country, just what you're witnessing.
[01:54:16.944 --> 01:54:21.168]  Everybody wants to hear from Joe Biggs, political prisoner Joe Biggs.
[01:54:21.168 --> 01:54:25.771]  Yeah, the trial was a very interesting process to go through.
[01:54:25.771 --> 01:54:31.375]  You know, we had, you know, you're told that you're going to be in a, you know, pick a jury of your peers.
[01:54:31.375 --> 01:54:32.556]  These aren't our peers.
[01:54:32.556 --> 01:54:33.157]  The people of D.C.
[01:54:33.157 --> 01:54:33.557]  hate that.
[01:54:34.153 --> 01:54:35.534]  Everything that we stand for.
[01:54:35.534 --> 01:54:39.276]  Anyone who's conservative, anyone who's right-leaning in any kind of way, you're an outcast.
[01:54:39.276 --> 01:54:39.857]  You're a hated.
[01:54:39.857 --> 01:54:41.838]  They think that you are the scum of the earth.
[01:54:41.838 --> 01:54:43.879]  So to say that you're going to get a fair trial in D.C.
[01:54:43.879 --> 01:54:46.941]  is the most, you know, hilarious thing in the world.
[01:54:46.941 --> 01:54:48.682]  These people convicted us.
[01:54:48.682 --> 01:54:50.784]  They won.
[01:54:50.784 --> 01:54:51.524]  They said so.
[01:54:51.524 --> 01:54:53.445]  They said that we were guilty from the get-go.
[01:54:53.445 --> 01:54:55.887]  They didn't care what was shown to them.
[01:54:55.887 --> 01:55:02.771]  They didn't care that we showed how many times the FBI lied, how many times on video that we got the FBI.
[01:55:02.771 --> 01:55:03.612]  We could see them.
[01:55:04.474 --> 01:55:13.697]  Coercing and changing the words of their own witnesses to fit the narrative that they wanted, and still the jury goes, I don't care.
[01:55:13.697 --> 01:55:15.398]  Still the judge goes, I don't care.
[01:55:15.398 --> 01:55:24.801]  It was the most disheartening thing to go through because you watch, you know, and we're sitting there, we're bringing forth the truth.
[01:55:24.801 --> 01:55:27.662]  But the truth isn't, you know, the courtroom's not a place for the truth, obviously.
[01:55:27.662 --> 01:55:28.662]  I mean, this is a place for
[01:55:29.284 --> 01:55:36.088]  You know, whatever they're allowed to put through and the judge allowed the government to get away with everything and push whatever they wanted to through.
[01:55:36.088 --> 01:55:40.151]  And it hurt to watch that.
[01:55:40.151 --> 01:55:48.436]  You know, you go in there with your head held high, you go in there thinking that, you know what, we're just going to keep fighting.
[01:55:48.436 --> 01:55:50.057]  You know, we're going to keep going.
[01:55:50.057 --> 01:55:52.398]  And this machine is so big, they just don't care.
[01:55:52.398 --> 01:55:54.259]  That's why people need to wake up.
[01:55:54.259 --> 01:55:55.600]  People need to get off their butts.
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:58.862]  People need to understand that there's a war going on in the sense that
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:01.341]  You know, they're coming after our rights.
[01:56:01.341 --> 01:56:05.324]  They are doing everything they can to throw us in jail.
[01:56:05.324 --> 01:56:06.504]  Oh, and war.
[01:56:06.504 --> 01:56:07.845]  Let's talk about the word war.
[01:56:07.845 --> 01:56:12.788]  Apparently, I say the word war too much, and I know you guys say that.
[01:56:12.788 --> 01:56:14.149]  It's a war for your mind.
[01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:16.070]  You've got to watch out, Alex.
[01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:20.613]  The judge brought up the fact that I said war so many times, and they even brought it up to prosecution.
[01:56:20.613 --> 01:56:24.175]  The amount of times I've said war before, that's a no-no.
[01:56:24.175 --> 01:56:29.078]  You can't say that word anymore, because then that means you're waging war against the government and you're terrorists.
[01:56:29.748 --> 01:56:35.290]  Um, you know, the things that came out in this trial just... I don't understand it.
[01:56:35.290 --> 01:56:44.312]  You know, you go in there with everything on your side, all that's right, all that's good, and they still don't care.
[01:56:44.312 --> 01:56:46.232]  The judge still sits there.
[01:56:46.232 --> 01:56:55.415]  Um, and the same video that they used, they showed, I remember when I first got locked up, they showed the judge, the government showed the judge of me shaking the fence or whatever.
[01:56:56.059 --> 01:57:04.548]  And the judge, his first response was, I didn't see anything in there that shows Joe breaking defense, so I'm not going to deny him bail.
[01:57:04.548 --> 01:57:09.373]  And then he comes back like two days later and goes, that's terrorism!
[01:57:09.373 --> 01:57:11.635]  Lock him up and throws him in jail.
[01:57:11.635 --> 01:57:12.716]  It was so weird.
[01:57:12.716 --> 01:57:17.041]  His initial response was... Because he clearly got his orders later.
[01:57:17.041 --> 01:57:17.241]  Yeah.
[01:57:18.123 --> 01:57:20.244]  You know, I mean, it was so weird.
[01:57:20.244 --> 01:57:21.204]  It was night and day.
[01:57:21.204 --> 01:57:23.845]  Because he sits there and he looks at it and he's telling the government, he's like, I don't see this.
[01:57:23.845 --> 01:57:25.186]  You know, this doesn't make sense to me.
[01:57:25.186 --> 01:57:28.787]  That's the same video that they played over and over in trial.
[01:57:28.787 --> 01:57:32.009]  The same video that they used to get the terrorist enhancement.
[01:57:32.009 --> 01:57:35.390]  The same stupid video that he goes, I don't see it.
[01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:36.350]  It's not there.
[01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:38.051]  You know, this doesn't really hold any water.
[01:57:38.051 --> 01:57:39.712]  And by the way, we'll pull that video up.
[01:57:39.712 --> 01:57:41.552]  I didn't think to do that, but I've seen that video.
[01:57:41.552 --> 01:57:42.913]  It's just you at the fence.
[01:57:42.913 --> 01:57:47.075]  Then we have Ray Epps picking a sign up, helping ram it into people.
[01:57:47.075 --> 01:57:47.495]  That's fine.
[01:57:49.841 --> 01:57:57.243]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to InfoWarsTore.com and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[01:57:57.243 --> 01:58:02.624]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[01:58:02.624 --> 01:58:10.266]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[01:58:10.586 --> 01:58:21.478]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[01:58:21.478 --> 01:58:33.250]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:36.956]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.

[01:58:48.467 --> 01:58:55.369]  Coffee has not been available at InfoWarsTour.com for two years because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[01:58:55.369 --> 01:59:03.812]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us, but when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was blown away.
[01:59:03.812 --> 01:59:09.254]  We finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer available to you right now.
[01:59:09.254 --> 01:59:11.575]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[01:59:11.575 --> 01:59:12.875]  It smells amazing and
[01:59:12.915 --> 01:59:15.316]  And it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[01:59:15.316 --> 01:59:22.919]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single-source Colombian coffees are now available at InfoWareStore.com exclusively.
[01:59:22.919 --> 01:59:25.280]  Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast.
[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:26.141]  Tastes great.
[01:59:26.141 --> 01:59:27.341]  It's the strong one.
[01:59:27.341 --> 01:59:28.201]  Really strong.
[01:59:28.201 --> 01:59:30.042]  But these are all close second and thirds.
[01:59:30.042 --> 01:59:30.783]  Medium Roast.
[01:59:30.783 --> 01:59:31.483]  Wake of America.
[01:59:31.823 --> 01:59:32.724]  Woo!
[01:59:32.724 --> 01:59:34.064]  That's what my go-to.
[01:59:34.064 --> 01:59:39.768]  Dark roast, tip of the spear, tastes the best, and is amazing, and is still very, very strong, gives you that pep.
[01:59:39.768 --> 01:59:52.016]  They're all three available at InfoWareStore.com, and they fund our operation, and each order gets a Pocket Constitution Citizen Rollback.
[01:59:52.016 --> 01:59:55.918]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:01.749 --> 02:00:04.411]  Lighting up the darkness with truth, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.646 --> 02:00:31.470]  Yeah, they said that my military experience is what gave me the ability to lead an army.
[02:00:31.470 --> 02:00:34.352]  But is there a video of you saying, we go into the Capitol?
[02:00:34.352 --> 02:00:37.915]  Or a video of you saying, or a text message of you saying, you orchestrated it?
[02:00:37.915 --> 02:00:40.017]  No, that's Ray Epps.
[02:00:40.017 --> 02:00:41.638]  Yeah, there's none of that whatsoever.
[02:00:41.638 --> 02:00:45.881]  They have a video of me going, oh my God, I can't believe everybody just stormed the Capitol.
[02:00:46.329 --> 02:00:53.075]  Um, there's even a video of me where I'm walking and I'm filming it, um, and I'm going, oh my god, we've just walked over the barriers.
[02:00:53.075 --> 02:00:57.158]  We've just walked over the barriers, not we've just taken them down or we've just busted them.
[02:00:57.158 --> 02:00:59.320]  We've just walked over them because someone else had knocked them down.
[02:00:59.696 --> 02:01:01.176]  We've just walked over the barriers.
[02:01:01.176 --> 02:01:02.377]  Oh my God, I can't believe this.
[02:01:02.377 --> 02:01:03.817]  People are storming the Capitol.
[02:01:03.817 --> 02:01:08.399]  And there's a lady with a little, like, uh, chihuahua going past me faster than I'm going.
[02:01:08.399 --> 02:01:11.680]  And a guy in a wheelchair passed me, but they said that I ran up and led the charge.
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:16.461]  And I have people literally passing me as I'm walking and going, oh my God, I can't believe this is happening.
[02:01:16.461 --> 02:01:19.542]  You know, I'm saying, oh my God, I can't believe this is happening.
[02:01:19.542 --> 02:01:20.622]  And that's my initial response.
[02:01:20.622 --> 02:01:21.503]  What does that tell you?
[02:01:21.503 --> 02:01:22.603]  There's not a plan.
[02:01:22.603 --> 02:01:25.004]  I'm literally shocked by what's happening.
[02:01:25.004 --> 02:01:27.004]  You know, and they go, well, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:01:27.004 --> 02:01:28.045]  He knew this was happening.
[02:01:28.045 --> 02:01:29.265]  There was a meeting of the mind.
[02:01:29.713 --> 02:01:46.907]  It happened somehow between them, and they all agreed that this was going to happen, even though there's no proof that there was ever on paper that it was said, that there's no recording, and not one person's ever come forward, and not one FBI employee has ever come forward and said that there was a plan, that there was proof of a plan or anything like that.
[02:01:46.907 --> 02:01:56.194]  No, no, no, we just somehow had this meeting of the minds that never happened, but that's what caused this conspiracy, and that's why we're now seditious terrorists somehow.
[02:01:56.772 --> 02:02:00.624]  You know, if that can happen, what else can happen in court?
[02:02:00.624 --> 02:02:01.828]  What else can they get away with?
[02:02:02.185 --> 02:02:05.608]  And again, for some reason we can't find the footage of you just touching the fence.
[02:02:05.608 --> 02:02:08.430]  We have Ray Epps there ramming it over the police.
[02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:10.391]  What's the name of that video, Joe, so we can find it?
[02:02:10.391 --> 02:02:11.172]  We'll add it in post.
[02:02:11.172 --> 02:02:13.674]  We're live right now, but that's something we really want to air.
[02:02:13.674 --> 02:02:17.577]  I know they hide all the exculpatory footage, but this is Ray Epps.
[02:02:17.577 --> 02:02:22.160]  There he is ramming it over the police and saying he orchestrated it and saying go into the Capitol, but that's okay.
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:29.686]  Well, the very first, the very first, the very first, the very, very first January 6th committee hearing was on Donald Trump and me.
[02:02:30.325 --> 02:02:36.390]  The very first one, if you remember, the very first one, they talked about Donald Trump for the first half, and then Joe Biggs.
[02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:50.463]  And the female cop that gets knocked over by Ryan Sample goes, Joe Biggs was in the crowd, and he had his bullhorn, and he looked at me and said, I don't like cops, and cops are trash, and everybody come and, you know, take out the cops or some crap like that.
[02:02:50.463 --> 02:02:54.086]  And I'm like, I'm sitting here watching this from jail going, are you serious?
[02:02:54.611 --> 02:02:55.811]  That never happened.
[02:02:55.811 --> 02:03:05.713]  And there's literally footage of another man with a bullhorn telling people to charge the fence that he needs men at the front for the women to get out of the way to push that fence over.
[02:03:05.713 --> 02:03:12.255]  And then she says that I lean into Ryan Samsel's ear and that he's the one who comes and takes out the fence.
[02:03:12.255 --> 02:03:12.815]  No.
[02:03:12.815 --> 02:03:13.415]  That's not me.
[02:03:13.415 --> 02:03:14.195]  That's Ray Epps.
[02:03:14.195 --> 02:03:15.475]  It's incredible.
[02:03:15.475 --> 02:03:16.396]  It's incredible.
[02:03:16.396 --> 02:03:19.036]  So we're showing the footage where you're standing at the fence doing nothing.
[02:03:19.036 --> 02:03:22.137]  This is your terrace now because of this footage we're showing right now.
[02:03:22.137 --> 02:03:23.337]  You standing against the fence.
[02:03:24.028 --> 02:03:26.109]  So, how are the other guys doing?
[02:03:26.109 --> 02:03:27.850]  Do you see them, or what's happening?
[02:03:27.850 --> 02:03:30.731]  Yeah, yeah, they're all sitting around.
[02:03:30.731 --> 02:03:34.713]  Enrique's reading the paper in front of me right now, but he can't talk because it's trial.
[02:03:34.713 --> 02:03:40.956]  I mean, his sentence is not until Tuesday, but he would like to come on if you guys want to have Enrique Cario in next week.
[02:03:40.956 --> 02:03:43.197]  He said he'd be interested in coming on.
[02:03:43.197 --> 02:03:48.460]  You know... No, we want them all, because I've been waiting to get you on, but obviously we didn't want to stir the court up.
[02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:51.281]  So when can Enrique come on?
[02:03:51.281 --> 02:03:52.062]  Enrique?
[02:03:52.062 --> 02:03:52.422]  Enrique?
[02:03:53.018 --> 02:03:54.799]  When do you want to come on with Alex?
[02:03:54.799 --> 02:03:55.479]  Next week?
[02:03:55.479 --> 02:03:56.399]  Afterward?
[02:03:56.399 --> 02:03:58.240]  You want to come on with Alex next week?
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:03:59.000]  Okay.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.140]  Like, Wednesday?
[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:00.740]  Okay, Wednesday.
[02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:01.541]  You said you could do it.
[02:04:01.541 --> 02:04:04.001]  We're literally talking to American political prisoners.
[02:04:04.001 --> 02:04:07.042]  We got four minutes left before they cut you off.
[02:04:07.042 --> 02:04:09.483]  Anything else you want to add right now, Joe Biggs?
[02:04:09.483 --> 02:04:13.004]  Yeah, so, you know, it was amazing.
[02:04:13.004 --> 02:04:20.726]  You know, I walk out of the courtroom, you know, I'm sitting there, I'm going through my mind, after the sentencing, I'm like, you know, it's hard to take it in.
[02:04:20.726 --> 02:04:22.667]  You know, 17 years, that's a big number.
[02:04:23.208 --> 02:04:25.711]  You know, and your life kind of flashes before your eyes.
[02:04:25.711 --> 02:04:29.216]  You start to wonder, like, you know, wow, like, is this it?
[02:04:29.216 --> 02:04:29.977]  Is this really it?
[02:04:29.977 --> 02:04:33.041]  But then you have to pull yourself back up and you have to go, no, this isn't it.
[02:04:33.041 --> 02:04:34.322]  This is only the beginning.
[02:04:34.322 --> 02:04:37.667]  This is where God starts to do His miracles, because when you're left with nothing,
[02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:42.861]  And you're sitting there, and your hands are tied behind your back, and you're in jail, and you're in solitary confinement.
[02:04:42.861 --> 02:04:46.282]  That's when God really comes through and works miracles.
[02:04:46.282 --> 02:04:52.684]  And I believe we're going to see miracles happen, and I believe God's going to have something good come out of this, because there's just been so much bad going on.
[02:04:52.684 --> 02:04:58.446]  We're seeing this country in such a decline, and I guarantee you, soon, we're going to start seeing some miracles happen.
[02:04:59.011 --> 02:05:00.572]  It's just a mask.
[02:05:00.572 --> 02:05:02.394]  It's just six feet.
[02:05:02.394 --> 02:05:04.976]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[02:05:04.976 --> 02:05:07.378]  It's just non-essential workers.
[02:05:07.378 --> 02:05:09.940]  It's just until we work it out.
[02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:11.441]  It's just a bar.
[02:05:11.441 --> 02:05:13.623]  It's just a restaurant.
[02:05:13.623 --> 02:05:15.524]  It's just nursing homes.
[02:05:15.524 --> 02:05:17.386]  It's just schools.
[02:05:17.386 --> 02:05:20.688]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[02:05:20.688 --> 02:05:22.450]  It's just until the cases go down.
[02:05:23.250 --> 02:05:25.512]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[02:05:25.512 --> 02:05:27.634]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[02:05:27.634 --> 02:05:30.777]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[02:05:30.777 --> 02:05:35.361]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[02:05:35.361 --> 02:05:37.843]  It's just churches and mosques.
[02:05:37.843 --> 02:05:39.524]  It's just singing.
[02:05:39.524 --> 02:05:42.207]  It's just travel.
[02:05:42.207 --> 02:05:44.669]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[02:05:44.669 --> 02:05:46.630]  It's just for the greater good.
[02:05:46.630 --> 02:05:48.032]  It's just fact-checking.
[02:05:48.852 --> 02:05:50.515]  Not censorship.
[02:05:50.515 --> 02:05:52.519]  It's just mandatory.
[02:05:52.519 --> 02:05:54.362]  It isn't just at all.
[02:05:54.362 --> 02:05:57.688]  Visit DefendJones.com to help fight back today.
[02:06:09.949 --> 02:06:14.111]  The program leftists fear and the man patriots love.
[02:06:14.111 --> 02:06:18.474]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:18.474 --> 02:06:20.335]  You know, it was heartfelt.
[02:06:20.335 --> 02:06:25.337]  You know, I walked through the door of the into the prison and everybody ran up to me and gave me a hug.
[02:06:25.337 --> 02:06:29.920]  And everybody sat there in line and they came up and shook my hand and go you could see the hurt in their eyes.
[02:06:30.427 --> 02:06:30.867]  We're good.
[02:06:47.672 --> 02:06:48.333]  I screwed up.
[02:06:48.333 --> 02:06:49.234]  I did something bad.
[02:06:49.234 --> 02:06:49.914]  I was violent.
[02:06:49.914 --> 02:06:50.555]  I did that.
[02:06:50.555 --> 02:06:59.503]  But everyone agrees, we didn't do a single thing worthy of this, and yet we're the ones being hated on the most because we're the only ones who are willing to stand up to Antifa.
[02:06:59.503 --> 02:07:08.011]  We're the only ones who are willing to go out there and speak our minds, and say what the government was doing wrong, and they came after us, and they want to shut us up, and they want to scare the American public.
[02:07:08.405 --> 02:07:08.805]  I don't think so.
[02:07:30.259 --> 02:07:35.941]  And going out and doing the right thing and putting good people in office that will help bring sanity back to this country.
[02:07:35.941 --> 02:07:36.981]  My life depends on it.
[02:07:36.981 --> 02:07:47.385]  My daughter's future depends on the American people to stop sitting around and stop being lazy, to pull your heads out of your butts and go to the ballot boxes and do the right thing.
[02:07:47.385 --> 02:07:47.885]  Please.
[02:07:47.885 --> 02:07:52.986]  Well, it sounds like you're buoyed by the fact that people know that you're innocent and that this is all a lie.
[02:07:52.986 --> 02:07:53.347]  Yeah.
[02:07:53.347 --> 02:07:55.447]  I mean, it doesn't matter where we go.
[02:07:55.447 --> 02:07:57.468]  People come up to us and go, this is a Travis
[02:07:58.140 --> 02:07:59.102]  You shouldn't be here.
[02:07:59.102 --> 02:08:02.810]  I mean, I have hardcore criminals on the bus ride back from the courthouse.
[02:08:03.277 --> 02:08:05.558]  Back here to the jail, there's a guy sitting beside me.
[02:08:05.558 --> 02:08:11.180]  He just got picked up for selling 13 illegal firearms in D.C.
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:13.480]  That should be five years for each weapon.
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:14.641]  He got a two-year deal.
[02:08:14.641 --> 02:08:15.981]  He got a two-year plea deal.
[02:08:15.981 --> 02:08:16.802]  He's laughing at me.
[02:08:16.802 --> 02:08:20.983]  He goes, oh my god, another guy goes, man, I just got like so and so many years for murder.
[02:08:20.983 --> 02:08:25.645]  He goes, you could have killed someone and gotten out quicker than me, you know, because they put you in a bus with a bunch of prisoners.
[02:08:25.645 --> 02:08:27.005]  They bring you back to the jail.
[02:08:27.005 --> 02:08:29.846]  It's different people from different walks of life that are there for different crimes.
[02:08:30.239 --> 02:08:37.885]  You know, and everyone's like, oh my God, like, I can't believe that a guy who walked around who has no criminal record is now considered a terrorist.
[02:08:37.885 --> 02:08:43.389]  Oh, people are pointing out that rapists that beat women up and torture them get two years and you get 17 years.
[02:08:43.389 --> 02:08:43.509]  Yeah.
[02:08:45.856 --> 02:08:59.779]  I mean, it's crazy when you see, like, hardened gangbangers, guys who've been, you know, their whole lives, you know, doing stuff like this, you know, going out, shooting at people, beating people up, beating them half to death, and they look at you and go, man, you don't deserve to be here.
[02:08:59.779 --> 02:09:00.599]  You're not like me.
[02:09:00.599 --> 02:09:02.520]  Like, I deserve to be in jail, they'll say.
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:04.000]  They go, but you don't.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.620]  You should be at home right now with your daughter.
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:07.841]  You deserve to be out there on the streets.
[02:09:07.841 --> 02:09:08.921]  Not us, but you do.
[02:09:09.693 --> 02:09:22.183]  And I guarantee you, myself, Ethan, Nordin, Zachary Real, Dominic Pozzola, or Enrique Tarrio will have similar stories from their experiences over the last three years at the jails they've been to.
[02:09:22.183 --> 02:09:24.104]  No one thinks that we should be here.
[02:09:24.104 --> 02:09:27.827]  No one believes that this is actually happening, but it is.
[02:09:27.827 --> 02:09:31.990]  And people need to understand that it's time to do something.
[02:09:31.990 --> 02:09:35.133]  Everything that's happening to Trump, it's happened to me already.
[02:09:35.133 --> 02:09:36.594]  Now it's happening to him.
[02:09:36.594 --> 02:09:37.635]  And then guess what?
[02:09:37.635 --> 02:09:38.576]  It's going to happen to you.
[02:09:39.686 --> 02:09:45.711]  Do you have hope that if Trump gets elected, despite all the challenges, he'll pardon you?
[02:09:45.711 --> 02:09:46.911]  Oh, I know he'll pardon us.
[02:09:46.911 --> 02:09:48.473]  I believe that with all my heart.
[02:09:48.473 --> 02:09:57.579]  You know, the thing is, is hopefully getting him, you know, for him to be able to get into the position where he can at least be, I think, on the ballot to run, right?
[02:09:57.579 --> 02:10:00.781]  Because once- You have one minute remaining.
[02:10:00.781 --> 02:10:01.862]  Election interference, right?
[02:10:01.862 --> 02:10:06.245]  It's election interference if they start trying to go after him once he's on there.
[02:10:06.245 --> 02:10:08.947]  I have to understand that, the legalities of that.
[02:10:09.315 --> 02:10:13.603]  But I do believe that Donald J. Trump will pardon us, and he should.
[02:10:13.603 --> 02:10:15.226]  We didn't do anything, you know?
[02:10:15.226 --> 02:10:16.509]  We're his supporters.
[02:10:16.509 --> 02:10:17.571]  We went there like he asked.
[02:10:20.945 --> 02:10:23.106]  Well, there's no doubt that they set us all up.
[02:10:23.106 --> 02:10:25.548]  We were all patsies that day, Joe.
[02:10:25.548 --> 02:10:29.069]  You've got to come back on any time you want on the broadcast.
[02:10:29.069 --> 02:10:30.290]  Anytime you can get on.
[02:10:30.290 --> 02:10:32.731]  11am to 3pm weekdays, Sundays.
[02:10:32.731 --> 02:10:33.811]  Or we can always tape.
[02:10:33.811 --> 02:10:34.792]  We love you.
[02:10:34.792 --> 02:10:38.373]  People should go to FreeJoeBiggs.com and donate to support your appeal.
[02:10:38.373 --> 02:10:39.414]  They want to grind us down.
[02:10:39.414 --> 02:10:40.534]  They want to break our will.
[02:10:40.534 --> 02:10:40.955]  Give me a 1776, brother.
[02:10:47.029 --> 02:10:48.290]  Hey Matt, I love you guys.
[02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:48.971]  Thanks for the look.
[02:10:48.971 --> 02:10:50.952]  Look, I said, they're not going to hold me down.
[02:10:50.952 --> 02:10:52.233]  I'm going to keep my head held high.
[02:10:52.233 --> 02:10:53.654]  I'm a warrior.
[02:10:53.654 --> 02:10:54.574]  I don't give up.
[02:10:54.574 --> 02:10:55.495]  This fight's not over.
[02:10:55.495 --> 02:10:56.416]  It's only just begun.
[02:10:56.416 --> 02:11:02.099]  And I'm telling you right now, thank you for using Global Telling.
[02:11:02.099 --> 02:11:08.164]  So, from a globalist gulag, Joe Beggs cut off.
[02:11:08.164 --> 02:11:09.745]  That's America.
[02:11:09.745 --> 02:11:15.549]  And if you don't think they're coming for your energy and your children and everything, I mean, it's full-on takeover.
[02:11:15.549 --> 02:11:15.829]  It's here.
[02:11:18.030 --> 02:11:22.852]  And again, I was not having these guys on because their lawyers didn't want to get them in more trouble.
[02:11:22.852 --> 02:11:23.913]  They'd be like, where's Jones?
[02:11:23.913 --> 02:11:25.073]  I'm not supporting people.
[02:11:25.073 --> 02:11:27.514]  Well, you didn't know the inside baseball, now you do.
[02:11:27.514 --> 02:11:30.556]  So you can all feel morally superior and do the things you do.
[02:11:30.556 --> 02:11:31.836]  I'm not talking to our general audience.
[02:11:31.836 --> 02:11:34.518]  I just get so sick of it.
[02:11:34.518 --> 02:11:37.519]  But now that the guys are ready to come on, we'll have them all on.
[02:11:38.769 --> 02:11:40.330]  And I think they're probably right.
[02:11:40.330 --> 02:11:53.657]  I think, I think the judges would have given them, you know, 40 years, 45 years that the evil globalists, they're not feds, they're people that have hijacked our government, were asking for if they would have done interviews.
[02:11:53.657 --> 02:12:03.802]  So this is quite a moment to be alive, but we've got to roll our sleeves up and admit the predicament we're in.
[02:12:06.567 --> 02:12:09.388]  And do something about it, because it's not going to get any better bowing down.
[02:12:09.388 --> 02:12:13.170]  Putting on the knee pads like Kamala Harris isn't going to get us out of this.
[02:12:13.170 --> 02:12:17.812]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[02:12:17.812 --> 02:12:22.154]  I want to take the ADL to the woodshed, because it's been the top trending thing for a few days.
[02:12:22.154 --> 02:12:28.958]  People really get it now, and I've got a big stack here that ties into the UN, their whole operation.
[02:12:28.958 --> 02:12:32.259]  And I've got all this other news too, so I'm really loaded for bear.
[02:12:32.259 --> 02:12:33.440]  I'm going to come back tomorrow.
[02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:36.291]  4 to 6 p.m.
[02:12:36.291 --> 02:12:38.112]  MTG's in the studio in the second hour.
[02:12:38.112 --> 02:12:42.415]  With the first hour, I'm going to do the ADL deep dive and some other things.
[02:12:42.415 --> 02:12:44.217]  But I've got a few things I'm going to hit right now.
[02:12:44.217 --> 02:12:47.179]  That's why I'm moving the ADL thing again to tomorrow.
[02:12:47.179 --> 02:12:49.120]  And I'm going to hit it Monday and Tuesday.
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:57.686]  And I also now... I already knew the inside baseball of Elon Musk, whether he's good or not.
[02:12:57.686 --> 02:12:58.967]  And he wasn't good before.
[02:12:58.967 --> 02:13:01.910]  He wasn't totally bad.
[02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:03.531]  But he's been a globalist, darling.
[02:13:04.679 --> 02:13:05.760]  But he got power.
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:10.402]  He got to be the richest man in the world.
[02:13:10.402 --> 02:13:14.965]  And they took his son and are getting ready to chop his peepee off.
[02:13:14.965 --> 02:13:16.066]  That'll wake anybody up.
[02:13:16.066 --> 02:13:17.987]  His firstborn son.
[02:13:17.987 --> 02:13:22.970]  They want that firstborn, don't they?
[02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:30.635]  And another one of his children got killed, it looks like, by a vaccine with sudden infant death syndrome.
[02:13:31.721 --> 02:13:34.042]  And again, Musk lives here in Austin.
[02:13:34.042 --> 02:13:42.507]  I'm not going to get into any, you know, stuff here or what my sources are, but we have to be ready for Musk to come over to our side.
[02:13:42.507 --> 02:13:45.349]  And Vivek Ramaswamy, sure he was a lot less before.
[02:13:45.349 --> 02:13:46.790]  He's joining us.
[02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:50.192]  The things he's saying are devastating them.
[02:13:50.192 --> 02:13:52.313]  And they're coming after him on every front.
[02:13:52.313 --> 02:13:54.734]  So I really want to caution everybody to not be Pharisees.
[02:13:54.734 --> 02:13:57.236]  Because you know what happened in Christ's day.
[02:13:58.285 --> 02:14:03.768]  There were these, you know, members of the Sanhedrin and the rabbis that said they were holier than thou.
[02:14:03.768 --> 02:14:06.089]  Not all of them, but some of them.
[02:14:06.089 --> 02:14:11.212]  And they were always talking about how they were perfect and they were good and everybody else was bad.
[02:14:11.212 --> 02:14:16.095]  But Christ was talking to the tax collectors, the prostitutes, and people that actually wanted to be reformed.
[02:14:16.095 --> 02:14:18.596]  Like when he was dying on the cross, or about to die.
[02:14:18.596 --> 02:14:23.639]  And he got the thief, the murderer, and one of them believes in God, the other doesn't, so he says, you'll be with me today in paradise.
[02:14:26.368 --> 02:14:42.560]  So it doesn't mean I turn my back and don't watch Ramaswamy or Musk, but I mean, look, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know, pun intended, that when you're... I mean, Musk came out today.
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:43.761]  In fact, I didn't see the article.
[02:14:43.761 --> 02:14:44.802]  I thought I sent it to you guys.
[02:14:44.802 --> 02:14:47.864]  It's an InfoWars.com article.
[02:14:47.864 --> 02:14:51.547]  It's a Zero Hedge article.
[02:14:51.547 --> 02:14:52.848]  He responded and tweeted it.
[02:14:52.848 --> 02:14:54.569]  In fact, print it for me because I didn't see it.
[02:14:54.569 --> 02:14:55.690]  You may have given it to me, but I missed it.
[02:14:57.506 --> 02:15:05.368]  And he said, he said, yeah, the head of my marketing has been meeting with them, just like you meet in a mafia war with the other side that meets with them.
[02:15:05.368 --> 02:15:08.069]  He said, the ADL has done everything they can.
[02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:12.051]  Here's a quote, ADL has tried very hard to strangle ex-Twitter.
[02:15:12.051 --> 02:15:16.212]  Elon Musk responds to hashtag ban the ADL.
[02:15:16.212 --> 02:15:24.274]  He says, just because I'm meeting with the extortionist, you know, Don Corleone met with the guys that shot him in the Godfather.
[02:15:24.274 --> 02:15:25.835]  It's all based on true story, different names.
[02:15:27.588 --> 02:15:28.689]  Doesn't mean Mustard's with him.
[02:15:28.689 --> 02:15:34.113]  No, that... They're getting ready to chop his firstborn son's penis off.
[02:15:34.113 --> 02:15:36.555]  And if that doesn't wake your ass up, nothing will.
[02:15:36.555 --> 02:15:39.778]  Another one of his children, the evidence is overwhelming, was killed by a vaccine.
[02:15:39.778 --> 02:15:41.780]  His brother almost died from one.
[02:15:41.780 --> 02:15:43.161]  And he's like, you know what?
[02:15:43.161 --> 02:15:45.423]  I'm not... Yeah, there's his son.
[02:15:45.423 --> 02:15:47.624]  Captured by the enemy.
[02:15:47.624 --> 02:15:56.592]  I don't care how rich and powerful you are, if you're not pure evil, having your son getting ready to have his balls cut off will get your attention real quick.
[02:15:58.092 --> 02:16:06.256]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[02:16:06.256 --> 02:16:16.680]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it, and they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[02:16:18.061 --> 02:16:22.906]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[02:16:22.906 --> 02:16:28.552]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfowarsStore.com.

[02:17:23.197 --> 02:17:36.166]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[02:17:36.166 --> 02:17:38.527]  There's major research behind this all.
[02:17:38.527 --> 02:17:42.590]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve

[02:19:59.568 --> 02:20:05.451]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:31.959 --> 02:20:34.979]  Prison's bad, but having your son's balls cut off is bad.
[02:20:34.979 --> 02:20:36.980]  It's worse.
[02:20:36.980 --> 02:20:37.140]  So...
[02:20:40.902 --> 02:20:43.264]  That's where this is.
[02:20:43.264 --> 02:21:06.060]  And... No, I actually know people that know Musk very closely, and... It's too big a subject to talk about at this point, but... Their words are, is, Musk is crazy, because these aren't even people on our team completely.
[02:21:06.060 --> 02:21:07.441]  These are very prominent people.
[02:21:08.484 --> 02:21:11.625]  Musk is completely pissed and out of his mind at the new award.
[02:21:11.625 --> 02:21:17.108]  Because they're getting ready to chop his son's balls off.
[02:21:17.108 --> 02:21:18.828]  That might piss you off.
[02:21:18.828 --> 02:21:20.189]  Like RFK Jr.
[02:21:20.189 --> 02:21:23.030]  Blew his father away right in front of him.
[02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:24.711]  Killed his uncle on national television.
[02:21:24.711 --> 02:21:29.753]  You think RFK Jr.
[02:21:29.753 --> 02:21:30.193]  is for real?
[02:21:30.193 --> 02:21:32.314]  I don't know.
[02:21:32.314 --> 02:21:34.775]  Somebody murders your daddy.
[02:21:34.775 --> 02:21:35.616]  Do you like him?
[02:21:35.616 --> 02:21:36.236]  Nah, come on.
[02:21:36.903 --> 02:21:42.485]  This thing's a lot more important than money and power, like vengeance and vendettas.
[02:21:42.485 --> 02:21:50.328]  So, I mean, the stuff they've done to me makes me, I'll never give up, and they haven't killed my family.
[02:21:50.328 --> 02:21:53.949]  They might have tried.
[02:21:53.949 --> 02:21:55.650]  So no, there's not just evil in the world, folks.
[02:21:55.650 --> 02:22:02.052]  There's not just Larry Fink, and the Rockefellers, and Obama, that joke.
[02:22:03.186 --> 02:22:09.049]  They have the money and the power and the media, but they don't have much else.
[02:22:09.049 --> 02:22:10.929]  They don't have your soul.
[02:22:10.929 --> 02:22:11.690]  They don't have your mind.
[02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:15.952]  They don't have your will.
[02:22:15.952 --> 02:22:19.533]  No, Tucker Carlson's now awake.
[02:22:19.533 --> 02:22:20.554]  Joe Rogan's now awake.
[02:22:20.554 --> 02:22:32.339]  We could talk for hours about all the people, the James Woods of the world's and the Tulsi Gabbards and the Russell Brands.
[02:22:34.175 --> 02:22:36.316]  Pretty much anybody popular is on our side.
[02:22:36.316 --> 02:22:42.778]  Because humans have a way about us when we finally get down and we know we're about to go down.
[02:22:42.778 --> 02:22:44.699]  We just say, you know what?
[02:22:44.699 --> 02:22:47.680]  How about we just have a fight?
[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:50.621]  Because I've said this a lot, I'll say it again.
[02:22:50.621 --> 02:22:54.602]  I don't know how all this is going to end.
[02:22:54.602 --> 02:22:57.863]  We didn't start this fight.
[02:22:57.863 --> 02:22:59.364]  And you new world order people aren't backing down.
[02:23:01.075 --> 02:23:06.099]  So I guess if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[02:23:06.099 --> 02:23:12.945]  That's what you're looking for, you came to the right place.
[02:23:12.945 --> 02:23:16.768]  The truth is, God has a sick sense of humor.
[02:23:16.768 --> 02:23:17.950]  And I get God.
[02:23:17.950 --> 02:23:19.251]  I don't judge God.
[02:23:19.251 --> 02:23:27.598]  So many people look at God giving us free will, and they see all the bad things that happen, and they see all the persecution and pain, and they say, God's a sadist.
[02:23:28.965 --> 02:23:31.207]  No, if anything, God's lonely.
[02:23:31.207 --> 02:23:39.514]  God made billions of creatures with free will and an understanding of the universe and the ability to interface with infinity.
[02:23:39.514 --> 02:23:47.100]  And I'm just thankful for the power I've been given and the will I've been given and the freedom I've been given to make that choice.
[02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:54.146]  And I just say to the Creator, beam me up, Master.
[02:23:57.435 --> 02:23:58.977]  You are so perfect.
[02:23:58.977 --> 02:23:59.898]  You are so good.
[02:23:59.898 --> 02:24:03.884]  I understand you.
[02:24:03.884 --> 02:24:06.588]  At least I think I do.
[02:24:06.588 --> 02:24:10.313]  I don't plan to understand God, but you know I understand God.
[02:24:10.313 --> 02:24:12.196]  I got God fear.
[02:24:12.196 --> 02:24:13.798]  And I just appreciate this.
[02:24:14.847 --> 02:24:27.451]  I've been put on this gorgeous planet and all this wonderful universe and I can experience beauty and culture and everything and just be alive and have my family and just, dude, this is amazing!
[02:24:27.451 --> 02:24:28.391]  Wow!
[02:24:28.391 --> 02:24:29.071]  Wow!
[02:24:29.071 --> 02:24:30.871]  What a ride!
[02:24:30.871 --> 02:24:32.112]  What an amusement park!
[02:24:32.112 --> 02:24:33.472]  What an incredible thing!
[02:24:33.472 --> 02:24:36.113]  And then, yeah, I go do bad stuff and it's your fault?
[02:24:37.836 --> 02:24:41.759]  Somebody else does something, so it's your fault for making us know.
[02:24:41.759 --> 02:24:44.141]  You gave us free will.
[02:24:44.141 --> 02:24:46.422]  Little g. Not a God.
[02:24:46.422 --> 02:24:48.184]  Little God.
[02:24:48.184 --> 02:24:49.645]  And some Christians don't like that.
[02:24:49.645 --> 02:24:52.127]  Fake Christians are like, that's blasphemy to say we're God.
[02:24:52.127 --> 02:24:56.430]  I didn't say I was God.
[02:24:56.430 --> 02:25:02.474]  Genesis says we are made in the image of God.
[02:25:02.474 --> 02:25:06.237]  Figure that out yet?
[02:25:06.237 --> 02:25:06.658]  Yeah.
[02:25:08.194 --> 02:25:13.416]  So I do appreciate being made in the image of the Creator.
[02:25:13.416 --> 02:25:19.239]  And I'm not prideful about it, I'm very humble about it, but I'm like, I'm gonna do whatever you're gonna tell me to do.
[02:25:19.239 --> 02:25:22.661]  By the way, just please take me with you.
[02:25:22.661 --> 02:25:23.881]  Oh, I get it.
[02:25:23.881 --> 02:25:25.742]  Oh, please.
[02:25:25.742 --> 02:25:26.763]  Let me do whatever.
[02:25:26.763 --> 02:25:28.744]  Oh, you don't like cowards?
[02:25:28.744 --> 02:25:32.165]  Well, you just tell me whatever I gotta do to prove I'm not one of those.
[02:25:32.165 --> 02:25:33.366]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:33.366 --> 02:25:35.607]  You tell me, jump, I say, how high?
[02:25:36.783 --> 02:25:38.604]  I'm going to click my heels eight times.
[02:25:38.604 --> 02:25:39.645]  I'm going to do it.
[02:25:39.645 --> 02:25:41.847]  You want me to get fed into a wood chipper?
[02:25:41.847 --> 02:25:45.009]  You want me to spend a trillion years in a hellhole?
[02:25:45.009 --> 02:25:50.533]  I'll do it because I've already had a little taste of the next level.
[02:25:50.533 --> 02:25:56.917]  Total completion, total victory, total understanding, mastery of everything.
[02:25:56.917 --> 02:26:00.379]  It's all God.
[02:26:00.379 --> 02:26:01.120]  And I'm the
[02:26:05.421 --> 02:26:08.302]  But nothing worth anything is free.
[02:26:08.302 --> 02:26:12.164]  Nothing that has value is easily gained.
[02:26:12.164 --> 02:26:13.545]  And that's what this is all about.
[02:26:13.545 --> 02:26:21.809]  So I want to play a disgusting clip, but first I want to take a piss.
[02:26:21.809 --> 02:26:28.093]  It's AeroPromo, and I'm going to come back with one of the most disgusting people I've ever met.
[02:26:28.093 --> 02:26:29.413]  And that's Sean Penn.
[02:26:29.413 --> 02:26:34.376]  I mean, you talk about an arrogant husk of a creature, a demon,
[02:26:35.796 --> 02:26:42.121]  Who wants World War III?
[02:26:42.121 --> 02:26:47.545]  Who now just said the quiet part aloud.
[02:26:47.545 --> 02:26:54.571]  He says the lockdowns are a mandatory rehearsal for things to come.
[02:26:54.571 --> 02:27:00.615]  This sick creature wants to lock you up because it makes him feel powerful.
[02:27:00.615 --> 02:27:04.058]  Where have we heard of that before?
[02:27:06.135 --> 02:27:09.517]  And I'm going to tell you why Sean Penn, you're so obsessed with locking us up.
[02:27:09.517 --> 02:27:14.339]  Because you're about to get your ass locked up culturally, spiritually.
[02:27:14.339 --> 02:27:18.321]  You're not going to get locked up in some cell.
[02:27:18.321 --> 02:27:21.723]  You're about to get locked up with people like you.
[02:27:21.723 --> 02:27:23.624]  Dimensionally.
[02:27:23.624 --> 02:27:28.666]  You're about to be cut off from the source.
[02:27:28.666 --> 02:27:32.368]  So that's why he spends all his time trying to claw us into his hell with him.
[02:27:35.185 --> 02:27:41.049]  Because the man is a retarded joke.
[02:27:41.049 --> 02:27:43.691]  I don't mean that meaning it's Down syndrome.
[02:27:43.691 --> 02:27:46.552]  I've had dinner with Sean Penn.
[02:27:46.552 --> 02:27:57.740]  The man, 16 years, 17, whatever it was, is a moron.
[02:27:57.740 --> 02:28:01.182]  But aren't the servants of the devil morons?
[02:28:03.991 --> 02:28:22.024]  He literally wants to starve you to death and make you eat bugs because it makes this goofus feel powerful.
[02:28:22.024 --> 02:28:23.285]  He's a retarded drug addict.
[02:28:28.083 --> 02:28:35.704]  But what does it say about us when we let retarded pedophile drug addicts like Joe Biden run our lives?
[02:28:35.704 --> 02:28:40.025]  God doesn't like that.
[02:28:40.025 --> 02:28:44.066]  You know who God hates more than cowards?
[02:28:44.066 --> 02:28:47.126]  People that don't take their destiny in their hands.
[02:28:47.126 --> 02:28:49.127]  People that don't love beauty.
[02:28:49.127 --> 02:28:50.367]  People that don't love strength.
[02:28:50.367 --> 02:28:55.408]  People that don't love the animating contest of liberty.
[02:28:56.929 --> 02:28:58.510]  It's just a mask.
[02:28:58.510 --> 02:29:00.331]  It's just six feet.
[02:29:00.331 --> 02:29:02.892]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[02:29:02.892 --> 02:29:05.314]  It's just non-essential workers.
[02:29:05.314 --> 02:29:07.855]  It's just until we work it out.
[02:29:07.855 --> 02:29:09.376]  It's just a bar.
[02:29:09.376 --> 02:29:11.557]  It's just a restaurant.
[02:29:11.557 --> 02:29:13.458]  It's just nursing homes.
[02:29:13.458 --> 02:29:15.319]  It's just schools.
[02:29:15.319 --> 02:29:18.621]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[02:29:18.621 --> 02:29:20.382]  It's just until the cases go down.
[02:29:21.182 --> 02:29:23.444]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[02:29:23.444 --> 02:29:26.246]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[02:29:26.246 --> 02:29:28.708]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[02:29:28.708 --> 02:29:33.292]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[02:29:33.292 --> 02:29:35.774]  It's just churches and mosques.
[02:29:35.774 --> 02:29:37.455]  It's just singing.
[02:29:37.455 --> 02:29:40.137]  It's just travel.
[02:29:40.137 --> 02:29:42.599]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[02:29:42.599 --> 02:29:44.541]  It's just for the greater good.
[02:29:44.541 --> 02:29:45.962]  It's just fact-checking.
[02:29:46.782 --> 02:29:48.445]  Not censorship.
[02:29:48.445 --> 02:29:50.447]  It's just mandatory.
[02:29:50.447 --> 02:29:52.290]  It isn't just at all.
[02:29:52.290 --> 02:29:55.614]  Visit DefendJones.com to help fight back today.
[02:29:57.261 --> 02:30:04.026]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[02:30:04.026 --> 02:30:07.669]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.

[02:30:17.176 --> 02:30:18.357]  It's about to sell out.
[02:30:18.357 --> 02:30:19.858]  We haven't had it in stock for years.

[02:31:02.130 --> 02:31:02.290]  I don't
[02:31:24.656 --> 02:31:26.418]  Because that's who we're getting it from.
[02:31:26.418 --> 02:31:29.122]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[02:31:29.122 --> 02:31:32.766]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[02:31:32.766 --> 02:31:38.373]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[02:31:38.373 --> 02:31:41.177]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[02:31:41.177 --> 02:31:42.278]  And here's what's even crazier.

[02:31:44.940 --> 02:31:48.202]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[02:31:48.202 --> 02:31:52.565]  So this is the highest rated, already the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[02:31:52.565 --> 02:31:53.345]  Rebels In.
[02:31:53.345 --> 02:31:56.207]  Get yours at InfoWareStore.com now.
[02:31:56.207 --> 02:31:57.247]  You wanted to plug Rainforce.
[02:31:57.247 --> 02:31:57.988]  Do you like Rainforce?
[02:31:58.368 --> 02:32:00.911]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckenladley.
[02:32:00.911 --> 02:32:03.174]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[02:32:03.174 --> 02:32:09.462]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[02:32:09.462 --> 02:32:12.525]  That's because I use brain force every day.
[02:32:13.166 --> 02:32:16.848]  I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[02:32:16.848 --> 02:32:20.789]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[02:32:20.789 --> 02:32:26.371]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[02:32:26.371 --> 02:32:34.055]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[02:32:34.055 --> 02:32:39.697]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[02:32:40.137 --> 02:32:40.897]  Alright, we love you.
[02:32:40.897 --> 02:32:41.498]  We'll be right back.
[02:32:41.498 --> 02:32:46.340]  Get your Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, and Turbo Force at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:59.428]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[02:32:59.428 --> 02:33:05.311]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.069 --> 02:33:15.292]  The man who pulls back the curtain on the deep state, Alex Jones.
[02:33:37.125 --> 02:33:38.966]  And I am just so thankful to God.
[02:33:38.966 --> 02:33:42.829]  And I don't think our demonic enemies have any imagination.
[02:33:42.829 --> 02:34:02.724]  In fact, I know they don't, because if they ever saw what I've seen, if they ever felt for one millisecond, the third heaven, it is, it is, it is, it is, it's heaven.
[02:34:02.724 --> 02:34:03.645]  That's why it's called that.
[02:34:05.393 --> 02:34:25.871]  It's not completion, it's not satisfaction, it's not ecstasy, it is timeless, total understanding and love, and a feeling of contentment that is so transformative to just bathe in the consciousness of the Creator.
[02:34:25.871 --> 02:34:27.372]  And it all makes sense.
[02:34:27.372 --> 02:34:30.015]  And I'm just blessed, because I unfortunately know this,
[02:34:31.559 --> 02:34:36.322]  Most people have not been as blessed as I've been to experience.
[02:34:36.322 --> 02:34:59.977]  I know there's higher levels, but what I've been given access to only five, six times is so good that I would spend trillions of years in hell to have one moment of this.
[02:34:59.977 --> 02:35:00.938]  And I've already been given it.
[02:35:05.455 --> 02:35:11.201]  Because I already experienced it when I was a very young child.
[02:35:11.201 --> 02:35:19.549]  Old space, interdimensional level, that recurring dream was the gate being opened.
[02:35:19.549 --> 02:35:27.698]  But it wasn't until I did the work and stood against the enemy that it interdimensionally created enough charge
[02:35:29.949 --> 02:35:33.490]  To then break the wall and go to the next level.
[02:35:33.490 --> 02:35:44.193]  And that's why God does this, is because we've got to be persecuted by evil so that we can recognize the opposite of it.
[02:35:44.193 --> 02:35:47.514]  Because if you're just given something, you don't appreciate it.
[02:35:47.514 --> 02:35:49.075]  Everybody knows that.
[02:35:49.075 --> 02:35:56.697]  You've got to be shown the other side before you can be shown infinity.
[02:36:03.444 --> 02:36:04.324]  Alright, let's play this clip.
[02:36:04.324 --> 02:36:06.946]  I'll come back and get to Sean Penn.
[02:36:06.946 --> 02:36:16.510]  Go to hell, New World Order.
[02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:19.192]  What kept you?
[02:36:19.192 --> 02:36:20.852]  We, uh, ran into some old friends.
[02:36:20.852 --> 02:36:21.673]  Is she alright?
[02:36:21.673 --> 02:36:27.156]  Seems okay if we can get to her.
[02:36:27.156 --> 02:36:32.038]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.
[02:36:42.506 --> 02:36:50.691]  Harrison, visit InfoWars.com forward slash show now.
[02:36:50.691 --> 02:37:02.678]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:37:02.678 --> 02:37:05.860]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show today.
[02:37:21.417 --> 02:37:26.279]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:37:26.279 --> 02:37:31.182]  This has been an important two plus hour broadcast.
[02:37:31.182 --> 02:37:32.542]  And it's only here because of you.
[02:37:32.542 --> 02:37:34.183]  So I humbly appreciate you.
[02:37:34.183 --> 02:37:36.464]  I say that you should support the transmission.
[02:37:36.464 --> 02:37:42.987]  Go to DefendJones.com if you want to donate directly to me for legal and professional fees so I can stay on air.
[02:37:42.987 --> 02:37:46.929]  Free speeches.
[02:37:46.929 --> 02:37:48.369]  Got about 5% gas.
[02:37:50.748 --> 02:37:51.288]  Which is high.
[02:37:51.288 --> 02:37:53.249]  That's the highest we've been in the black in a few years.
[02:37:53.249 --> 02:37:55.670]  So, we're about 5% above the red.
[02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:59.111]  Importers are somewhat halfway, barely stabilized.
[02:37:59.111 --> 02:38:00.652]  I have no money to pay my legal fees.
[02:38:00.652 --> 02:38:01.952]  The judge said I had to pay half of them.
[02:38:01.952 --> 02:38:02.792]  I don't have any money.
[02:38:02.792 --> 02:38:03.513]  They lied and said it.
[02:38:03.513 --> 02:38:07.994]  The judge said he's about to reverse that, or it looks like he is, but he signaled that.
[02:38:07.994 --> 02:38:10.275]  But, you want me to fight somebody?
[02:38:10.275 --> 02:38:13.036]  I mean, I'm taking on the Democratic Party, the whole New World Order.
[02:38:13.036 --> 02:38:15.957]  Trump's already spent $67 million this year on lawyers.
[02:38:15.957 --> 02:38:18.218]  I've been in the last year, a million dollars in the hole.
[02:38:19.349 --> 02:38:23.492]  I want to thank all of you that went to DefendJones.com and made donations.
[02:38:23.492 --> 02:38:26.354]  Whether it's a dollar or a thousand dollars, you know who you are.

[02:38:30.728 --> 02:38:31.889]  So defendjones.com.

[02:38:37.314 --> 02:38:38.615]  Strongest humanoid out there.
[02:38:38.615 --> 02:38:39.976]  Strongest turmeric out there.
[02:38:39.976 --> 02:38:41.317]  It's back in stock.
[02:38:41.317 --> 02:38:41.918]  25% off.
[02:38:41.918 --> 02:38:44.199]  SuperFill Vitality is the same as the Male Vitality.
[02:38:44.199 --> 02:38:45.180]  It's just sold out.
[02:38:45.180 --> 02:38:46.141]  It's about to sell out too.
[02:38:46.141 --> 02:38:47.322]  60% off.
[02:38:47.322 --> 02:38:50.325]  All the great essential oil, fluoride-free toothpaste are there.
[02:38:50.325 --> 02:38:51.105]  The turmeric, the
[02:38:51.926 --> 02:38:52.386]  We're good to go.
[02:39:10.842 --> 02:39:16.144]  I have to come here and ask for your help because the court has still not approved my salary.
[02:39:16.144 --> 02:39:18.365]  I've not been paid what I'm supposed to be.
[02:39:18.365 --> 02:39:19.866]  I can't pay my legal bills.
[02:39:19.866 --> 02:39:21.707]  And so I am in your hands.
[02:39:21.707 --> 02:39:23.688]  You're making the decision whether to keep us on air or not.
[02:39:24.875 --> 02:39:28.877]  We have amazing products at InfoWareStore.com and you are literally changing history.
[02:39:28.877 --> 02:39:31.238]  The globalists are so angry.
[02:39:31.238 --> 02:39:31.978]  These aren't just words.
[02:39:31.978 --> 02:39:32.739]  Listen to me.
[02:39:32.739 --> 02:39:35.220]  They're so angry we're still on air.
[02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:40.962]  They're so upset that they haven't silenced us because they haven't broken your will.
[02:39:40.962 --> 02:39:42.763]  They haven't gotten you to give up.
[02:39:42.763 --> 02:39:44.784]  So spread the word, please.
[02:39:44.784 --> 02:39:45.425]  Share the article.
[02:39:45.425 --> 02:39:45.965]  Share the video.
[02:39:45.965 --> 02:39:46.425]  Share the clips.
[02:39:46.425 --> 02:39:46.945]  You're doing it.
[02:39:46.945 --> 02:39:47.706]  I see it.
[02:39:47.706 --> 02:39:48.246]  Intensify it.
[02:39:48.988 --> 02:39:51.210]  Call and talk radio, plug the show, whatever you got to do.
[02:39:51.210 --> 02:39:52.872]  It's having a big effect.
[02:39:52.872 --> 02:40:00.421]  InfoWars and Alex Jones was right, and I'm very humble about this because I'm not perfect, but it's a rallying point that people are saying, you want to destroy this guy?
[02:40:00.421 --> 02:40:01.382]  We got his back.
[02:40:01.382 --> 02:40:04.705]  Thank you for myself, the crew, and my family.
[02:40:04.705 --> 02:40:09.050]  But please get products to keep InfoWars on air, plus get great products that empower your life.

[02:40:41.717 --> 02:40:42.857]  You're the reason I'm here.
[02:40:42.857 --> 02:40:43.558]  Thank you to the crew.
[02:40:43.558 --> 02:40:45.038]  Thank you to everybody else.
[02:40:45.038 --> 02:40:47.260]  I'll see you back tomorrow, Lord willing.
[02:40:48.481 --> 02:40:48.981]  4 p.m.

[02:40:55.933 --> 02:40:56.514]  Eastern.
[02:40:56.514 --> 02:40:57.556]  God bless and good luck!
[02:41:25.131 --> 02:41:30.114]  On March 20th, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq.
[02:41:30.114 --> 02:41:35.357]  Exactly one year before the invasion, Alex Jones predicted it.
[02:41:35.357 --> 02:41:38.099]  So now everybody's going, wow, it really was the Iraqis.
[02:41:38.099 --> 02:41:41.041]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[02:41:41.041 --> 02:41:42.402]  What a beautiful setup.
[02:41:42.402 --> 02:41:49.026]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:41:49.026 --> 02:41:53.469]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:41:56.977 --> 02:41:58.378]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[02:41:58.378 --> 02:41:59.318]  I thought it was next week.
[02:41:59.318 --> 02:42:03.740]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:05.980]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:42:05.980 --> 02:42:09.822]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[02:42:09.822 --> 02:42:11.703]  Overhead shot, please.
[02:42:11.703 --> 02:42:15.884]  Look how full this bottle is.
[02:42:15.884 --> 02:42:18.825]  Right to the top, folks.
[02:42:18.825 --> 02:42:21.566]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoids.
[02:42:24.665 --> 02:42:27.527]  Again, most turmeric formulas are five percent.
[02:42:27.527 --> 02:42:28.867]  Some are maybe ten.
[02:42:28.867 --> 02:42:31.549]  The other strongest brands are seventy-five percent.
[02:42:31.549 --> 02:42:35.491]  This is ninety-five percent.
[02:42:35.491 --> 02:42:36.452]  Super constant.
[02:42:36.452 --> 02:42:40.314]  So like taking one pill is like taking ten of the average pill.
[02:42:40.314 --> 02:42:41.795]  It's that powerful.
[02:42:41.795 --> 02:42:42.955]  Or more.

[02:42:59.366 --> 02:43:03.787]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[02:43:03.787 --> 02:43:06.028]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:43:06.028 --> 02:43:09.869]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.

[02:43:24.722 --> 02:43:28.904]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[02:43:28.904 --> 02:43:31.606]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[02:43:31.606 --> 02:43:32.106]  This is 95%.
[02:43:32.106 --> 02:43:36.509]  Super concentrated.
[02:43:36.509 --> 02:43:39.451]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.

[02:43:41.826 --> 02:43:42.987]  Or more!
[02:43:42.987 --> 02:43:49.111]  So they're available at InfoWarsStore.com Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.

[02:43:58.458 --> 02:44:03.841]  I want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars for offering scholarships to River University.
[02:44:03.841 --> 02:44:07.003]  Maybe you're watching InfoWars today and you
[02:44:07.944 --> 02:44:11.466]  Don't know what to do with the problems that we face in the world today.
[02:44:11.466 --> 02:44:16.030]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023.
[02:44:16.030 --> 02:44:22.854]  But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is, but we show you how to deal with it.

[02:45:03.404 --> 02:45:12.968]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[02:45:12.968 --> 02:45:16.610]  But now we've got it 30 parts per million from the top lab.
[02:45:16.610 --> 02:45:18.031]  We've got a limited shipment.
[02:45:18.031 --> 02:45:19.711]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[02:45:19.711 --> 02:45:25.774]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal,

[02:45:56.877 --> 02:46:02.641]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[02:46:02.641 --> 02:46:07.464]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[02:46:07.464 --> 02:46:10.506]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[02:46:10.506 --> 02:46:20.073]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[02:46:20.073 --> 02:46:22.655]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[02:46:23.315 --> 02:46:31.843]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[02:46:31.843 --> 02:46:33.684]  It is game-changing.
[02:46:33.684 --> 02:46:35.926]  All you gotta do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[02:46:35.926 --> 02:46:39.289]  I know you're gonna be hooked, which will then fund your Operation A360 win.

[02:46:54.705 --> 02:46:59.390]  Get your coffee now.
[02:46:59.390 --> 02:47:05.297]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:15.714 --> 02:47:24.480]  No, we came out here an hour ago and not one leftist would defend the mask from the shots with a coherent argument.
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:30.725]  None of them could change my mind about not wanting the COVID charity protocols to come back.
[02:47:30.725 --> 02:47:36.730]  Send me your non-binary, quadruple-vex champion!
[02:47:36.730 --> 02:47:41.893]  Tell me why we need their mandates and their lockdowns and five masks!
[02:47:41.893 --> 02:47:43.715]  I didn't take a shot.
[02:47:44.762 --> 02:47:49.887]  And I'm thankful for you that I didn't do that, because you awaken me to a lot of things.
[02:47:49.887 --> 02:47:51.728]  How are you doing?
[02:47:51.728 --> 02:47:53.070]  Good, how are you?
[02:47:53.070 --> 02:47:56.453]  Tell us real quick, would you like to wear a mask again or try to bring the Mandix back?
[02:47:56.453 --> 02:47:57.293]  I think not.
[02:47:57.293 --> 02:47:57.654]  So you're not?
[02:47:57.654 --> 02:47:59.115]  Well, come tell us!
[02:47:59.115 --> 02:47:59.696]  You won't?
[02:47:59.696 --> 02:48:00.656]  Well, go ahead and speak up.
[02:48:00.656 --> 02:48:01.817]  They're coming to do it.
[02:48:01.817 --> 02:48:03.959]  So I'd say, what, five to one or against it?
[02:48:03.959 --> 02:48:04.960]  More shots!
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:05.361]  More shots!
[02:48:05.361 --> 02:48:07.483]  You want more shots?
[02:48:07.483 --> 02:48:07.943]  You need a hug!
[02:48:07.943 --> 02:48:08.964]  You need more shots!
[02:48:08.964 --> 02:48:09.284]  I do!
[02:48:09.284 --> 02:48:09.945]  Come give me a hug!
[02:48:11.054 --> 02:48:24.081]  Alex Jones turned out to be right and Bill Gates and Fauci and Klaus Schwab, they turned out to be wrong because they were lying on purpose and they need to go to prison for what they've done!
[02:48:24.081 --> 02:48:30.825]  We have only begun to fight in the information war and we will never surrender!
[02:48:43.018 --> 02:48:45.440]  Whatever happened to communicability?
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:50.265]  Have you seen the freaking trainwreck they call the evident TV?
[02:48:50.265 --> 02:48:54.309]  Fight like hell with familial friends, streaming from the other end.
[02:48:54.309 --> 02:48:59.794]  Everywhere you look, everywhere is a club.
[02:49:05.209 --> 02:49:09.132]  We're good.
[02:49:25.011 --> 02:49:31.116]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:49:31.116 --> 02:49:32.437]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:49:32.437 --> 02:49:35.259]  InfoWorth.com, yeah.
[02:49:40.523 --> 02:49:47.908]  Well, in case you didn't know, the UN and the CDC and all the criminals like Fauci
[02:50:09.591 --> 02:50:20.273]  We are planning to try to bring back the COVID protocols and all the fear and the mask and the mind control.
[02:50:20.273 --> 02:50:30.215]  And I saw some women come by earlier and they scoffed at the no more mask, but they should put one on their face and they should get the bacterial pneumonia they love so much.
[02:50:30.215 --> 02:50:36.456]  So, right here we are in the center of captured New California, far away Austin, Texas.
[02:50:38.303 --> 02:50:43.307]  And I'm doing this with Steven Crowder, who has, of course, the famous program, Change My Mind.
[02:50:43.307 --> 02:50:44.848]  We're doing it right now.
[02:50:44.848 --> 02:50:46.910]  We're trying to bring back the mandates.
[02:50:46.910 --> 02:50:50.252]  They got their new quote, poison booster shot.
[02:50:50.252 --> 02:50:58.598]  So I'd like to hear from people out here that either want the mandates to come back or don't want it.
[02:50:58.598 --> 02:51:00.900]  But of course, I don't want it.
[02:51:00.900 --> 02:51:04.743]  And I challenge anybody on the left to try to change my mind.
[02:51:05.720 --> 02:51:18.667]  So we're out here to have a discussion with anybody that wants to change our mind that these shots are poisonous and don't work, and that the masks don't work, and that we've been dealing with serious tyranny.
[02:51:18.667 --> 02:51:20.568]  So I'll be sitting right here, not on Bullhorn.
[02:51:20.568 --> 02:51:24.290]  Anybody that wants to come over and talk to us is welcome to.
[02:51:24.290 --> 02:51:25.670]  Sir, come on over.
[02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:26.551]  How you doing?
[02:51:26.551 --> 02:51:26.931]  I'm Alex.
[02:51:26.931 --> 02:51:28.132]  How you doing here?
[02:51:28.132 --> 02:51:29.052]  Have a seat.
[02:51:29.052 --> 02:51:31.333]  What's your view on the mask and all the rest of it?
[02:51:31.333 --> 02:51:31.954]  It's horseshit.
[02:51:31.954 --> 02:51:33.895]  So I don't need to change your mind then?
[02:51:35.299 --> 02:51:36.600]  Well, I guess you're not going to be able to change my mind.
[02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:38.861]  You know, they're trying to bring back the mandates and controls again.
[02:51:38.861 --> 02:51:41.022]  I got COVID on purpose when I first came out.
[02:51:41.022 --> 02:51:44.104]  I'm sure you're talking about national immunity.
[02:51:44.104 --> 02:51:44.644]  Absolutely.
[02:51:44.644 --> 02:51:45.564]  God bless you, man.
[02:51:45.564 --> 02:51:46.825]  Take care.
[02:51:46.825 --> 02:51:48.606]  You guys looking forward to the new mask mandate?
[02:51:48.606 --> 02:51:49.526]  Absolutely.
[02:51:49.526 --> 02:51:51.147]  Oh, you are?
[02:51:51.147 --> 02:51:52.128]  Well, come talk to us about it.
[02:51:52.128 --> 02:51:53.088]  Why aren't you wearing your mask?
[02:51:57.389 --> 02:51:58.229]  Hey Alex Jones.
[02:51:58.229 --> 02:51:59.110]  I love you so much.
[02:51:59.110 --> 02:51:59.470]  That's crazy.
[02:51:59.470 --> 02:52:00.150]  Why would we do that?
[02:52:00.150 --> 02:52:01.011]  It has no benefit to us.
[02:52:01.011 --> 02:52:01.951]  It just has benefit to them.
[02:52:01.951 --> 02:52:03.011]  Well you know what that is.
[02:52:03.011 --> 02:52:03.512]  I didn't take a shot.
[02:52:19.264 --> 02:52:24.065]  And I'm thankful for you that I didn't do that, because you awakened me to a lot of things.
[02:52:24.065 --> 02:52:26.166]  Well, give us 30 seconds on your view on it.
[02:52:26.166 --> 02:52:28.046]  Well, you know, some of it's biblical, right?
[02:52:28.046 --> 02:52:34.448]  People want to control people.
[02:52:34.448 --> 02:52:37.628]  And it just seems to be a human nature to try to hurt each other.
[02:52:37.628 --> 02:52:37.988]  Absolutely.
[02:52:37.988 --> 02:52:38.769]  They want power.
[02:52:38.769 --> 02:52:41.589]  We're separated from each other, and that's wrong.
[02:52:41.589 --> 02:52:42.730]  We're not supposed to be separated.
[02:52:42.730 --> 02:52:43.410]  We're one.
[02:52:43.410 --> 02:52:44.210]  What's your name, brother?
[02:52:44.210 --> 02:52:44.910]  I'm Mark Duke.
[02:52:44.910 --> 02:52:45.670]  Nice to meet you, Mark.
[02:52:45.670 --> 02:52:45.990]  Take care.
[02:52:45.990 --> 02:52:46.750]  It's a pleasure.
[02:52:46.750 --> 02:52:47.131]  See you.
[02:52:47.131 --> 02:52:48.311]  Take care.
[02:52:48.311 --> 02:52:48.651]  How you doing?
[02:52:50.014 --> 02:52:53.055]  Man, why is your dog not wearing a mask?
[02:52:53.055 --> 02:52:58.597]  YOU CAN SHOVE YOUR POISON SHOTS UP YOUR NEW WORLD ORDER ASS!
[02:52:58.597 --> 02:53:00.338]  I've been shadowbanned.
[02:53:00.338 --> 02:53:02.038]  I've been called a liar.
[02:53:02.038 --> 02:53:06.580]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:09.481]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[02:53:09.481 --> 02:53:12.782]  They've tried to destroy me, but I survived.
[02:53:12.782 --> 02:53:15.443]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[02:53:17.156 --> 02:53:19.882]  The replatforming begins now.
[02:53:19.882 --> 02:53:25.133]  Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com.
[02:53:28.712 --> 02:53:32.993]  This is not about somebody wanting to put on pantyhose and have their sexual organs changed.
[02:53:32.993 --> 02:53:34.593]  It's about shocking our children.
[02:53:34.593 --> 02:53:36.694]  A lot of these groups are pedophiles, let's face it.
[02:53:36.694 --> 02:53:39.254]  They want to talk about sex with your kids.
[02:53:39.254 --> 02:53:47.116]  And in the name of tolerance, they're gonna put your kids on Ritalin and Prozac, they're gonna inject them with deadly vaccines full of cancer viruses, and they're gonna really screw them up.
[02:53:47.116 --> 02:53:53.717]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[02:54:01.392 --> 02:54:03.614]  Say it!
[02:54:03.614 --> 02:54:09.338]  This is how I show my love I've made it in my mind because
[02:54:28.599 --> 02:54:33.445]  A new craze has spread among teenagers and patriots all across America.
[02:54:33.445 --> 02:54:37.410]  The mainstream media is calling it InfoWars Mania.
[02:54:37.410 --> 02:54:44.218]  Millions of listeners are tuning in at InfoWars.com forward slash show to see what the buzz is all about.
[02:54:44.218 --> 02:54:47.743]  Let's take a look now at what's going on everywhere InfoWars can be heard.
[02:54:57.500 --> 02:55:12.995]  Welcome to that fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
[02:55:19.170 --> 02:55:34.254]  Corruption, Monsanto, aspartame, poisons in the vaccines, pump scanners for kids to get their lunch in taxless societies, satellite tracking systems, cops in black ski masks, foreign troops, FEMA camps.
[02:55:34.254 --> 02:55:40.336]  She's not a ranger to the high-tech music you don't like to say by Alex Jones.
[02:55:44.497 --> 02:55:47.702]  New World Order, we're coming for you, you hear us?
[02:55:59.070 --> 02:56:00.211]  Good evening.
[02:56:00.211 --> 02:56:01.572]  I'm Erica Lost.
[02:56:01.572 --> 02:56:09.037]  An unidentified man is being held for questioning by the FBI for suspected links to last month's biological virus deaths.
[02:56:09.037 --> 02:56:15.941]  In local news, a dog named Hero takes the grand prize at the annual... I wish I could tell you more pertinent news.
[02:56:15.941 --> 02:56:21.305]  But we're in a rating system here, and the key factor is... Sensationalism!
[02:56:21.305 --> 02:56:23.627]  They've got you running in circles.
[02:56:23.627 --> 02:56:25.188]  Nine to five.
[02:56:25.188 --> 02:56:27.109]  Then five to nine.
[02:56:27.109 --> 02:56:27.770]  You're mine.
[02:56:28.730 --> 02:56:33.293]  I tell you what they want you to know, and you consider it the truth.
[02:56:33.293 --> 02:56:35.994]  Nobody is opening their eyes!
[02:56:35.994 --> 02:56:41.537]  Our global economy is depleting the world of our lives and natural resources!
[02:56:41.537 --> 02:56:42.297]  Are you happy?
[02:56:42.297 --> 02:56:42.678]  Come on!
[02:56:47.125 --> 02:56:53.733]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[02:57:55.797 --> 02:58:01.182]  Utilized for thousands of years, tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[02:58:01.182 --> 02:58:08.828]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of tumeric and its active components.
[02:58:09.128 --> 02:58:20.012]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[02:58:20.012 --> 02:58:31.777]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[02:58:32.017 --> 02:58:35.501]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.

[02:58:46.554 --> 02:58:51.420]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[02:58:52.213 --> 02:58:52.373]  I don't
[02:59:14.741 --> 02:59:16.503]  Because that's who we're getting it from.
[02:59:16.503 --> 02:59:19.206]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[02:59:19.206 --> 02:59:22.850]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[02:59:22.850 --> 02:59:28.456]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[02:59:28.456 --> 02:59:30.939]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[02:59:30.939 --> 02:59:32.380]  And here's what's even crazier.
[02:59:33.081 --> 02:59:35.022]  30% off of what they're selling it for.
[02:59:35.022 --> 02:59:38.282]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[02:59:38.282 --> 02:59:42.643]  So this is the highest rated, already the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[02:59:42.643 --> 02:59:43.424]  Rebels In.
[02:59:43.424 --> 02:59:50.585]  Get yours at InfoWareStore.com now.
[02:59:50.585 --> 02:59:54.526]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:04.554 --> 03:00:14.837]  The left-wing lunatics are trying very hard to bring back COVID lockdowns and mandates with all of their sudden fear-mongering about the new variants that are coming.
[03:00:14.837 --> 03:00:22.039]  But to every COVID tyrant who wants to take away our freedom, hear these words, we will not comply.
[03:00:24.036 --> 03:00:37.988]  In New York, two captured states on each end of the country have officially rolled out new COVID protocols and mandates on their websites and said that indeed they're bringing back the controls.
[03:00:37.988 --> 03:00:43.172]  But we really caught them with their pants down almost two weeks ago with the whistleblower info.
[03:00:43.172 --> 03:00:45.294]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got a call yesterday.
[03:00:45.294 --> 03:00:50.058]  An individual was in town and they are a high level manager.
[03:00:50.979 --> 03:00:51.139]  What?
[03:01:18.072 --> 03:01:25.035]  People who have had the vaccine are more susceptible to BA.2.A6.
[03:01:25.035 --> 03:01:27.236]  What the actual s***?
[03:01:27.236 --> 03:01:34.899]  But I was sent by the whistleblower a link to the California website and it says the controls are back and here they are.
[03:01:34.899 --> 03:01:36.420]  Right there in black and white.
[03:01:36.420 --> 03:01:37.600]  They're gonna roll them out.
[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:44.183]  And through the institutions, the corporations, the hospitals, the hotels, through the colleges, through the public schools,
[03:01:45.143 --> 03:01:49.846]  All over the country, they are shutting down public schools if there's one COVID case.
[03:01:49.846 --> 03:01:53.548]  That's creating the lockdown by sending the children back home.
[03:01:53.548 --> 03:01:55.068]  That's the beginning of it.
[03:01:55.068 --> 03:02:02.973]  My sources, because I called around and confirmed what the first source said, said middle of September, Biden is set to start the rollout.
[03:02:02.973 --> 03:02:05.254]  Now five, six days later,
[03:02:17.862 --> 03:02:23.146]  Joe Biden literally saying, y'all need to come, they need to come up with a new vaccine.
[03:02:23.146 --> 03:02:27.069]  And they need to come up with a way that people have to take it no matter what.
[03:02:27.069 --> 03:02:29.951]  I'm willing to die about my freedom.
[03:02:29.951 --> 03:02:32.713]  I'm willing to die about my medical independence.
[03:02:32.713 --> 03:02:35.775]  So all I got to say to you in that video, try this.
[03:02:36.556 --> 03:02:37.697]  Go around and find out.
[03:02:37.697 --> 03:02:42.500]  The FDA and CDC, they've made an announcement on the new vaccine.
[03:02:42.500 --> 03:02:48.724]  So, certainly, they said that they will have an updated vaccine in September, mid-September.
[03:02:48.724 --> 03:02:50.465]  There never was a COVID pandemic.
[03:02:50.465 --> 03:02:53.106]  There never was a SARS-CoV-2 novel virus.
[03:02:53.106 --> 03:02:54.407]  There was never any of those things.
[03:02:54.407 --> 03:03:03.873]  This was a behavior modification exercise to fulfill the objective of the financial interests that were being served.
[03:03:03.873 --> 03:03:04.674]  And let's remember,
[03:03:05.984 --> 03:03:19.055]  That the quote, until a pandemic is at emergency threshold, the public doesn't understand the need for medical countermeasures such as a pan-coronavirus or pan-influenced vaccine.
[03:03:19.055 --> 03:03:21.237]  We need the media to create the hype.
[03:03:21.897 --> 03:03:25.358]  We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues.
[03:03:25.358 --> 03:03:29.059]  Investors will follow if they see profit at the end of the process.
[03:03:29.059 --> 03:03:30.440]  That's a quote from Peter Daszak.
[03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:35.561]  That's a quote that was made at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, published in 2015.
[03:03:35.561 --> 03:03:39.342]  This is the admission of terrorism again.
[03:03:39.342 --> 03:03:41.103]  Now, what did I say they were told?
[03:03:41.929 --> 03:03:44.911]  The beginning of the announcements begin September 15th.
[03:03:44.911 --> 03:03:52.415]  This was just the warming up and getting ready that just so happened to begin right after I announced it literally six hours later.
[03:03:52.415 --> 03:03:52.955]  Everywhere.
[03:03:52.955 --> 03:03:59.239]  They just opened up on the public, every controlled corporate outlet, and then the institutions to create the fear.
[03:03:59.799 --> 03:04:02.742]  You can stop all flights.
[03:04:02.742 --> 03:04:05.884]  You can lock down entire countries.
[03:04:05.884 --> 03:04:08.106]  You can actually do that.
[03:04:08.106 --> 03:04:11.770]  And this, I would say, may make us more open.
[03:04:12.990 --> 03:04:18.375]  Two radical ideas about how to deal also with climate change.
[03:04:18.375 --> 03:04:21.218]  This has nothing to do with public health.
[03:04:21.218 --> 03:04:24.121]  It has nothing to do with breaking any waves.
[03:04:24.121 --> 03:04:26.643]  It was always about breaking people.
[03:04:26.643 --> 03:04:31.188]  There's a path of resistance or there is the path of total enslavement.
[03:04:32.921 --> 03:04:34.101]  Come on.
[03:04:34.101 --> 03:04:37.502]  Your ancestors were stronger than this.
[03:04:37.502 --> 03:04:39.383]  You're stronger than this.
[03:04:39.383 --> 03:04:49.685]  You can focus on the New World Order and its activities, and you can ask God to lead, guide, and direct you with discernment.
[03:04:49.685 --> 03:04:52.726]  And you do that, we're unstoppable together.
[03:04:57.648 --> 03:05:02.171]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned!

[03:06:39.166 --> 03:06:40.986]  The mighty MTG.
[03:06:40.986 --> 03:06:41.947]  And Texas is already 105.
[03:06:41.947 --> 03:06:45.008]  We don't need somebody as beautiful and amazing as her.
[03:06:45.008 --> 03:06:46.349]  She clashes with the heat down here.
[03:06:46.349 --> 03:06:48.209]  This place is burning up now.
[03:06:48.209 --> 03:06:49.950]  It is so great to have you here.
[03:06:49.950 --> 03:06:51.691]  So great to be going to dinner tonight.
[03:06:51.691 --> 03:06:52.891]  And we got an hour with you.
[03:06:52.891 --> 03:06:54.071]  And you're just amazing.
[03:06:54.071 --> 03:06:54.992]  I want to talk about the trumpet.
[03:06:55.752 --> 03:06:56.613]  Thank you so much.
[03:07:17.264 --> 03:07:19.105]  Thank you Alex, I really appreciate it.
[03:07:35.729 --> 03:07:37.470]  Social media so they can share it.
[03:07:37.470 --> 03:07:38.551]  Something they get behind.
[03:07:38.551 --> 03:07:40.032]  They all donate their money.
[03:07:40.032 --> 03:07:41.572]  They all get into the movement.
[03:07:41.572 --> 03:07:43.313]  We saw it happen with BLM.
[03:07:43.313 --> 03:07:44.754]  We saw it happen with COVID.
[03:07:44.754 --> 03:07:45.295]  Masks.
[03:07:45.295 --> 03:07:46.355]  Vaccines.
[03:07:46.355 --> 03:07:47.676]  We saw it happen with Ukraine.
[03:07:47.676 --> 03:07:49.077]  They tried it with monkey pox.
[03:07:49.077 --> 03:07:50.918]  We made fun of it and it failed.
[03:07:50.918 --> 03:07:52.859]  They're trying to bring COVID back.
[03:07:52.859 --> 03:07:58.862]  But I really believe the next thing is going to be this climate change crisis.
[03:07:58.862 --> 03:08:00.643]  They're going to create it into an emergency.
[03:08:00.643 --> 03:08:02.865]  And Alex, I want to talk about Burning Man for a minute.
[03:08:03.545 --> 03:08:11.311]  We are watching, you know, from a distance, there are approximately like 73 or 75,000 people in Nevada.
[03:08:11.311 --> 03:08:12.772]  And they're locked in there from floods.
[03:08:12.772 --> 03:08:15.354]  And I'm glad, I was going to raise that.
[03:08:15.354 --> 03:08:21.158]  They literally did a mock sacrifice and all this and then it flooded with these tornadoes and it was, sorry, go ahead.
[03:08:21.158 --> 03:08:25.041]  Well, you know, God has a way of making sure everyone knows who God is.
[03:08:25.041 --> 03:08:26.242]  I'll say that about that.
[03:08:26.242 --> 03:08:29.084]  But let's talk about what is happening to these people.
[03:08:30.583 --> 03:08:35.768]  There's 73, 75,000 people in Nevada desert right now at this Burning Man.
[03:08:35.768 --> 03:08:36.629]  They're locked in.
[03:08:36.629 --> 03:08:38.390]  They're not allowed to leave.
[03:08:38.390 --> 03:08:44.956]  And they're basically probably being brainwashed that climate change is the cause of all of it.
[03:08:44.956 --> 03:08:46.318]  The root of all evil.
[03:08:46.698 --> 03:08:48.079]  And it's going to destroy the Earth.
[03:08:48.079 --> 03:08:49.779]  And they're feeling the panic.
[03:08:49.779 --> 03:08:52.681]  But maybe you're saying that, oh, this is because you didn't know about climate change.
[03:08:52.681 --> 03:08:53.101]  Yes.
[03:08:53.101 --> 03:08:54.922]  So what's going to happen, Alex?
[03:08:54.922 --> 03:08:58.123]  It's the same way they launch any kind of movement.
[03:08:58.123 --> 03:09:10.489]  After this is over and Burning Man and these 75,000 people disperse and they go back home, they're going to have these stories to tell and how terrible it is and how we have to do everything possible to stop climate change.
[03:09:10.489 --> 03:09:12.790]  It's caused by humans and it's carbon.
[03:09:13.410 --> 03:09:15.251]  And it's the amount of carbon that we put out.
[03:09:15.251 --> 03:09:16.691]  It's manufacturing.
[03:09:16.691 --> 03:09:19.393]  It's our gas and diesel engines.
[03:09:19.393 --> 03:09:21.413]  It's, you know, agriculture.
[03:09:21.413 --> 03:09:24.034]  I mean, AOC wants to get rid of cattle.
[03:09:24.034 --> 03:09:25.175]  Even population.
[03:09:25.175 --> 03:09:28.076]  We have too many humans putting out too much carbon.
[03:09:28.076 --> 03:09:31.358]  You're going to start hearing all this stuff and this is going to build.
[03:09:31.358 --> 03:09:41.942]  And I believe this is the left's new lie they're going to put on the American people and try to get everyone behind and create it to where, remember AOC and the left and many others said,
[03:09:42.262 --> 03:09:45.484]  The earth is going to literally explode in a ball of fire.
[03:09:45.484 --> 03:09:46.325]  We're going to all die.
[03:09:46.325 --> 03:09:47.745]  It's going to be the end of the world.
[03:09:47.745 --> 03:09:47.785]  2030.
[03:09:47.785 --> 03:09:50.447]  This is what they're brainwashing people to believe.
[03:09:50.447 --> 03:09:51.208]  No, I totally agree.
[03:09:51.208 --> 03:09:57.431]  And now Biden says he's set to announce a new climate emergency that Klaus Schwab said three years ago they'd do after COVID.
[03:09:57.431 --> 03:09:59.853]  So they literally cut our resources off and make it fancy.
[03:10:00.441 --> 03:10:02.221]  Well, let's be realistic though.
[03:10:02.221 --> 03:10:03.942]  Yes, the climate changes.
[03:10:03.942 --> 03:10:07.383]  It's been changing since the beginning of time.
[03:10:07.383 --> 03:10:10.564]  Since God created the earth, the climate has changed.
[03:10:10.564 --> 03:10:17.786]  And that is the reality because we live on our planet is moving, it's rotating, it's moving through our air.
[03:10:17.786 --> 03:10:19.066]  The only constant is change.
[03:10:19.526 --> 03:10:21.428]  It always changes.
[03:10:21.428 --> 03:10:22.829]  It rotates around the sun.
[03:10:22.829 --> 03:10:24.230]  It moves through the galaxy.
[03:10:24.230 --> 03:10:26.812]  Our galaxy rotates through the universe.
[03:10:26.812 --> 03:10:30.475]  Of course our climate is going to change.
[03:10:30.475 --> 03:10:32.216]  But does that mean people are causing it?
[03:10:32.216 --> 03:10:32.716]  No.
[03:10:32.716 --> 03:10:35.739]  Does that mean we have to raise taxes to stop it?
[03:10:35.739 --> 03:10:36.840]  No, absolutely not.
[03:10:36.840 --> 03:10:40.142]  Does that mean we have to bow down to a globalist government?
[03:10:40.142 --> 03:10:41.023]  Absolutely not, never.
[03:10:41.023 --> 03:10:42.784]  As if they can stop it anyways.
[03:10:42.784 --> 03:10:43.505]  They can't stop it.
[03:10:44.022 --> 03:10:46.083]  It's all the sun, as you said.
[03:10:46.083 --> 03:10:49.144]  So what's happening in Congress?
[03:10:49.144 --> 03:10:51.865]  Because I know we're getting close to impeachment movements.
[03:10:51.865 --> 03:11:04.469]  We know Biden's the puppet, but still we need to get them on the defense because that ties into these insane indictments of Trump, which even Donna Brazile admits has totally blown up in her face.
[03:11:05.250 --> 03:11:16.214]  Well, so day one, when I entered Congress in January of 2021, on Joe Biden's first day in office, I introduced articles of impeachment.
[03:11:16.214 --> 03:11:23.057]  And I introduced those against Joe Biden because of Ukraine, because of Burisma, because we knew the truth.
[03:11:23.057 --> 03:11:24.318]  We knew the truth a long time ago.
[03:11:24.938 --> 03:11:26.980]  And I introduced those articles of impeachment.
[03:11:26.980 --> 03:11:32.186]  This has been a movement I have been pushing since the time I came into Congress.
[03:11:32.186 --> 03:11:34.588]  This is why they kicked me off committees.
[03:11:34.588 --> 03:11:38.252]  This is why they tried to politically destroy me.
[03:11:38.252 --> 03:11:43.798]  But finally, through our oversight investigations, I'm on the oversight committee, we have been investigating Joe Biden.
[03:11:44.318 --> 03:12:05.726]  Since the beginning of this Congress and the amount of evidence we have produced has become so overwhelming now that even our Republicans in Congress that don't want to have anything to do with impeachment, they are now, we believe, I believe, we have enough votes to vote for impeachment inquiry when we go back here next week in September.
[03:12:06.326 --> 03:12:06.726]  Amazing.
[03:12:06.726 --> 03:12:07.987]  Elaborate on that.
[03:12:07.987 --> 03:12:10.208]  What about impeachment of Merrick Garland?
[03:12:10.208 --> 03:12:11.448]  These people are a joke.
[03:12:11.448 --> 03:12:14.389]  And you've got Jack Smith meeting secretly at the White House?
[03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.910]  That's right.
[03:12:14.910 --> 03:12:19.992]  So if everyone wants to know more information, you can go to impeachmentteam.com.
[03:12:19.992 --> 03:12:25.254]  By the way, I want to hear a record skip sound right now on everybody's mind.
[03:12:25.254 --> 03:12:28.235]  Slowly give us out, because you're on the field.
[03:12:28.235 --> 03:12:29.616]  You're a champion in the fight.
[03:12:30.456 --> 03:12:31.897]  You are quarterbacking this.
[03:12:31.897 --> 03:12:32.698]  You're getting this done.
[03:12:32.698 --> 03:12:33.718]  You promised this months ago.
[03:12:33.718 --> 03:12:35.740]  It's happening now.
[03:12:35.740 --> 03:12:37.101]  People need to go to this site.
[03:12:37.101 --> 03:12:37.781]  They need to tweet it.
[03:12:37.781 --> 03:12:38.702]  They need to share it.
[03:12:38.702 --> 03:12:39.522]  They need to get behind it.
[03:12:39.522 --> 03:12:40.623]  So explain this to us.
[03:12:40.623 --> 03:12:43.545]  Okay, so I've introduced articles of impeachment on Joe Biden.
[03:12:43.545 --> 03:12:46.207]  I've introduced articles of impeachment on Merrick Garland.
[03:12:46.207 --> 03:12:48.869]  I've introduced articles of impeachment on Christopher Wray.
[03:12:49.429 --> 03:12:57.196]  Matthew Graves, who persecutes January 6th defendants, pro-life protesters, parents who hold their school board accountable.
[03:12:57.196 --> 03:12:58.177]  That's Matthew Graves.
[03:12:58.177 --> 03:13:03.221]  And I've introduced articles of impeachment against Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
[03:13:03.221 --> 03:13:04.602]  Here's what's happening.
[03:13:04.602 --> 03:13:07.965]  The amount of evidence, Alex, is becoming so overwhelming.
[03:13:07.965 --> 03:13:10.748]  Just like, here let me say this, this is really important.
[03:13:11.448 --> 03:13:20.374]  Just like we can truly say, at least I can truly say, I believe the Great Awakening is occurring because of truth.
[03:13:20.374 --> 03:13:24.816]  People all over are waking up and God is dividing people by the sheep and goats.
[03:13:24.816 --> 03:13:26.377]  He is literally dividing us.
[03:13:26.377 --> 03:13:30.540]  There's people that can't hear the truth right now and then there's people that are waking up over and over.
[03:13:30.540 --> 03:13:32.301]  The amount of truth that is basically
[03:13:34.843 --> 03:13:41.588]  Just coming out throughout Congress is forcing the will of Congress, forcing the will of Republicans.
[03:13:41.588 --> 03:13:45.731]  Republicans that wouldn't act before are now becoming willing to act.
[03:13:45.731 --> 03:13:51.115]  And so I have a lot of encouragement and hope where we are going forward.
[03:13:51.115 --> 03:13:59.381]  But at the same time, I caution people at home to please have patience, even though that's the hardest thing to have, because I feel the same way as you do.
[03:13:59.381 --> 03:14:01.923]  I want impeachment now and I want it on all these people.
[03:14:02.583 --> 03:14:05.445]  But what we have to do is we have to continue to push.
[03:14:05.445 --> 03:14:06.745]  So here's the good thing.
[03:14:06.745 --> 03:14:12.008]  All of my colleagues that I work with, they've been at home in their districts and they've had to hear from their constituents.
[03:14:12.008 --> 03:14:15.350]  They've had to hear from the voters that sent them to Washington.
[03:14:15.350 --> 03:14:17.771]  And I hope to God they have been yelling at them.
[03:14:17.771 --> 03:14:18.632]  And you said that buzzword.
[03:14:18.632 --> 03:14:20.433]  You said, we've got McCarthy about to do it.
[03:14:20.433 --> 03:14:22.194]  He says now they're moving there.
[03:14:22.194 --> 03:14:22.874]  He said he's ready.
[03:14:22.874 --> 03:14:23.555]  So you delivered again.
[03:14:24.335 --> 03:14:24.875]  Thank you.
[03:14:24.875 --> 03:14:26.116]  I appreciate that.
[03:14:26.116 --> 03:14:27.076]  In a way, I get the point.
[03:14:27.076 --> 03:14:31.477]  You've got to ripen it and have the investigations to show it all to make sure you have the votes.
[03:14:31.477 --> 03:14:31.777]  Right.
[03:14:31.777 --> 03:14:33.398]  So here's the process.
[03:14:33.398 --> 03:14:36.318]  Let's explain it out in detail so everyone knows.
[03:14:36.318 --> 03:14:40.379]  In the House of Representatives, we have 435 members of Congress.
[03:14:40.379 --> 03:14:41.280]  Let's be clear.
[03:14:41.280 --> 03:14:47.001]  In our system of three branches, federalism is done to make it slow so a dictator can take control.
[03:14:47.001 --> 03:14:47.842]  So people get frustrated.
[03:14:47.842 --> 03:14:49.422]  It takes time, but that's how our system works.
[03:14:49.702 --> 03:14:50.342]  Absolutely.
[03:14:50.342 --> 03:14:53.463]  We don't want it fast because imagine if it was flipped the other way.
[03:14:53.463 --> 03:14:54.644]  We've already seen that.
[03:14:54.644 --> 03:14:59.786]  They impeached Trump twice by abusing the system and abusing power.
[03:14:59.786 --> 03:15:01.026]  So 435 members of Congress.
[03:15:01.026 --> 03:15:01.887]  We have 222 Republican members.
[03:15:01.887 --> 03:15:02.007]  Only 222.
[03:15:02.007 --> 03:15:05.788]  We have to have 218 yes votes to do anything in the House of Representatives.
[03:15:05.788 --> 03:15:06.888]  Without 218, we fail on everything.
[03:15:06.888 --> 03:15:08.489]  So you've got to overwhelmingly nail it?
[03:15:19.193 --> 03:15:22.978]  We have to overwhelmingly now and here's Kevin McCarthy has been there.
[03:15:22.978 --> 03:15:24.179]  He's already been there.
[03:15:24.179 --> 03:15:25.922]  He has spent time.
[03:15:25.922 --> 03:15:28.705]  Our oversight committee has spent time.
[03:15:28.705 --> 03:15:30.067]  Judiciary has spent time.
[03:15:30.067 --> 03:15:37.997]  Ways and Means Committee has spent time producing evidence, investigating evidence and showing it through our committee work.
[03:15:38.417 --> 03:15:52.735]  So that we can not only show the American people, we can also show all of our colleagues, everyone in Congress, to convince them, look, we have the evidence right now, not to impeach, literally just to ask the question.
[03:15:52.735 --> 03:15:55.458]  That's what an impeachment inquiry is.
[03:15:55.458 --> 03:15:56.119]  Can we just...
[03:15:57.063 --> 03:16:03.991]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:16:03.991 --> 03:16:12.980]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:16:12.980 --> 03:16:15.183]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:16:15.823 --> 03:16:19.127]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:16:19.127 --> 03:16:27.637]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:16:27.637 --> 03:16:31.782]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[03:16:32.442 --> 03:16:43.966]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands-down the best.
[03:16:43.966 --> 03:16:50.028]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[03:16:50.028 --> 03:16:56.210]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:16:57.048 --> 03:17:03.954]  Coffee has not been available at InfoWarsTour.com for two years because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[03:17:03.954 --> 03:17:12.401]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us, but when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was blown away.
[03:17:12.401 --> 03:17:17.845]  We finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer available to you right now.
[03:17:17.845 --> 03:17:20.167]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[03:17:20.167 --> 03:17:21.148]  It smells amazing.
[03:17:21.508 --> 03:17:23.909]  And it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[03:17:23.909 --> 03:17:31.511]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single-source Colombian coffees are now available at Infowarshore.com exclusively.

[03:17:33.871 --> 03:17:34.732]  Tastes great.
[03:17:34.732 --> 03:17:35.932]  It's the strong one.
[03:17:35.932 --> 03:17:36.772]  Really strong.
[03:17:36.772 --> 03:17:38.613]  But these are all close second and thirds.
[03:17:38.613 --> 03:17:39.373]  Medium Roast.
[03:17:39.373 --> 03:17:40.053]  Wake of America.
[03:17:40.413 --> 03:17:41.314]  Woo!

[03:17:42.655 --> 03:17:48.359]  Dark roast, tip of the spear, tastes the best, and is amazing, and is still very, very strong, gives you that pep.

[03:18:16.758 --> 03:18:17.938]  It's about to sell out.

[03:19:05.698 --> 03:19:12.044]  We could not get the highest quality colonial silver for almost three years back in stock.
[03:19:12.044 --> 03:19:13.125]  But now we've got it.
[03:19:13.125 --> 03:19:15.687]  30 parts per million from the top lab.

[03:19:17.108 --> 03:19:18.769]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.

[03:19:58.270 --> 03:20:11.363]  I will not vote for any appropriation bill that does those things.
[03:20:11.363 --> 03:20:14.586]  I will not vote for a short-term CR that does those things.
[03:20:14.586 --> 03:20:19.771]  And how amazing, though, has been them trying to roll it out again?
[03:20:19.771 --> 03:20:20.732]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[03:20:21.789 --> 03:20:22.891]  They're losing.
[03:20:22.891 --> 03:20:26.215]  They need things to distract people, to suck them into fear.
[03:20:26.215 --> 03:20:28.338]  That's why they need the climate change crisis.
[03:20:28.338 --> 03:20:31.121]  That's why they want climate activists and protesters.
[03:20:31.121 --> 03:20:32.143]  They're going to be rioters.
[03:20:32.143 --> 03:20:33.064]  Just wait.
[03:20:33.064 --> 03:20:34.286]  Then we may have lockdowns.
[03:20:34.286 --> 03:20:35.748]  They're blocking roads and everything.
[03:20:35.748 --> 03:20:36.509]  Of course they are!
[03:20:36.949 --> 03:20:41.330]  Then we're going to have more COVID to increase mass hysteria and fear.
[03:20:41.330 --> 03:20:44.011]  They need people distracted, and I'll go back to why.
[03:20:44.011 --> 03:20:45.472]  The border's wide open.
[03:20:45.472 --> 03:20:49.993]  Bidenomics is destroying people's ability to pay their bills.
[03:20:49.993 --> 03:20:53.534]  They're putting us into a war that may lead to World War III.
[03:20:53.534 --> 03:20:56.755]  They cannot win on these policies.
[03:20:56.755 --> 03:21:05.398]  They're locking up their top political opponent, President Trump, who we remember four years with President Trump as some of the greatest years in American history.
[03:21:05.538 --> 03:21:08.140]  The head of the DNC says this isn't working.
[03:21:08.140 --> 03:21:11.362]  What did they think was going to happen?
[03:21:11.362 --> 03:21:14.765]  Well, they did a good job with elections before.
[03:21:14.765 --> 03:21:17.026]  We understand that.
[03:21:17.026 --> 03:21:21.469]  But I truly see this as they're so arrogant.
[03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:23.731]  Really, Alex, they're so arrogant.
[03:21:23.731 --> 03:21:32.177]  They really believe that their policies are the best, that they know what they're doing, and that these little stupid peons and the uneducated people of America
[03:21:32.617 --> 03:21:45.207]  You know, the deplorables, as they called us once before, that we don't know what we're doing, that they know better than us, and that they can just win, and that they'll just- And Marjorie Taylor Greene, that's the key.
[03:21:45.207 --> 03:21:49.831]  The Black Rocks know it's to create an angrier world, destroy things, and consolidate power.
[03:21:49.831 --> 03:21:55.155]  But you're right, the Democrats actually believe they're creating a utopia, and they're being given marching orders that are going to destroy everything.
[03:21:55.535 --> 03:21:56.456]  They are.
[03:21:56.456 --> 03:21:58.558]  Well, they're definitely doing that.
[03:21:58.558 --> 03:22:01.620]  They're leading us down to a road of destruction.
[03:22:01.620 --> 03:22:04.263]  But I'm telling you, Alex, people are waking up.
[03:22:04.263 --> 03:22:05.203]  It's the most incredible thing.
[03:22:05.203 --> 03:22:06.304]  That's an understatement.
[03:22:06.304 --> 03:22:07.866]  I'm not saying you're wrong.
[03:22:07.866 --> 03:22:11.289]  I'm saying I don't have a way to describe to people what I see on the street.
[03:22:11.289 --> 03:22:13.230]  Because I live in liberal communist Austin.
[03:22:13.230 --> 03:22:14.752]  I got hate a year ago.
[03:22:14.752 --> 03:22:16.293]  No hate ever now.
[03:22:16.293 --> 03:22:18.095]  I mean, it's total reversal.
[03:22:18.752 --> 03:22:25.236]  That's wonderful because people know and they're suffering under the Biden administration or the Biden regime.
[03:22:25.236 --> 03:22:26.397]  They've already been fooled.
[03:22:26.397 --> 03:22:31.660]  People that really bought into COVID, they have come out of this thing so upset and angry.
[03:22:31.660 --> 03:22:33.181]  Like, I can't believe I got these vaccines.
[03:22:33.181 --> 03:22:34.302]  They didn't even work.
[03:22:34.302 --> 03:22:36.403]  I can't believe I wore a mask all the time.
[03:22:36.403 --> 03:22:37.144]  That didn't help me.
[03:22:37.144 --> 03:22:38.765]  It didn't stop the spread of COVID.
[03:22:38.765 --> 03:22:42.768]  People that are coming out of this are coming out and they're waking up.
[03:22:42.768 --> 03:22:44.649]  And so they have no desire to go back.
[03:22:44.989 --> 03:22:50.516]  They're also realizing that, oh, maybe there's some truth to this Hunter Biden laptop.
[03:22:50.516 --> 03:22:53.579]  Oh, shoot, maybe Joe Biden has been doing that.
[03:22:53.579 --> 03:22:56.743]  And they see Maui really piss people off.
[03:22:57.219 --> 03:22:58.580]  It should piss people off.
[03:22:58.580 --> 03:23:00.041]  Lahaina was a wonderful town.
[03:23:00.041 --> 03:23:01.081]  I've been there many times.
[03:23:01.081 --> 03:23:01.762]  Me too.
[03:23:01.762 --> 03:23:07.225]  Yeah, it was one of the best places to go visit in Maui.
[03:23:07.225 --> 03:23:11.928]  My daughter spent nearly every summer out there for like eight years.
[03:23:11.928 --> 03:23:13.369]  The people there are wonderful.
[03:23:13.369 --> 03:23:16.932]  It just was a great community.
[03:23:16.932 --> 03:23:22.655]  And Biden, he said about the train deal, Roman, he said he's too busy to go there.
[03:23:22.655 --> 03:23:23.276]  We have that club.
[03:23:24.266 --> 03:23:25.347]  Just too busy to go to.
[03:23:25.347 --> 03:23:26.287]  Too busy to go.
[03:23:26.287 --> 03:23:29.249]  Well, you know, Joe Biden, it's amazing.
[03:23:29.249 --> 03:23:37.293]  He wants $24 billion more dollars for Ukraine, but wants to give a $700 one-time payment to the people of Lahaina that lost everything.
[03:23:37.293 --> 03:23:43.136]  Then when he did go talk to him, he talked about how his kitchen fire and experience there is somehow... Made about him.
[03:23:43.476 --> 03:23:45.338]  I think at 44% of the time he's on vacation.
[03:24:07.950 --> 03:24:09.411]  Yeah, that's a lot of vacation time.
[03:24:09.411 --> 03:24:18.777]  You know, if you work Monday through Friday, if you work Monday through Friday, that's about 26, that gives you about 26% of the year vacation time.
[03:24:18.777 --> 03:24:19.298]  Think about that.
[03:24:19.298 --> 03:24:24.621]  If you work Monday through Friday all year long, then you, Saturday and Sunday, Saturday and Sunday is vacation.
[03:24:24.621 --> 03:24:26.983]  So that's about 26% of the year.
[03:24:26.983 --> 03:24:29.605]  But Joe Biden has spent over 40%, 40, 44%.
[03:24:29.605 --> 03:24:32.026]  It's incredible.
[03:24:32.026 --> 03:24:35.649]  Well, he's also, he's too old to serve.
[03:24:35.649 --> 03:24:36.790]  Well, that's my next question.
[03:24:38.047 --> 03:24:39.408]  What are they going to do about him?
[03:24:39.408 --> 03:24:41.290]  I mean, they've got Newsom kind of getting warmed up.
[03:24:41.290 --> 03:24:43.752]  They've got Big Mike.
[03:24:43.752 --> 03:24:45.713]  I'm not sure, actually.
[03:24:45.713 --> 03:24:49.476]  Oh, Big Mike's got you laughing.
[03:24:49.476 --> 03:24:50.477]  Yeah.
[03:24:50.477 --> 03:24:51.758]  I tell you what.
[03:24:51.758 --> 03:24:53.880]  They're going to save her.
[03:24:53.880 --> 03:24:57.422]  If it's a real emergency, we'll definitely see her come out.
[03:24:57.422 --> 03:24:58.923]  They're going to break in case of emergency.
[03:24:58.923 --> 03:24:59.844]  Exactly.
[03:24:59.844 --> 03:25:00.545]  She's in a case.
[03:25:00.545 --> 03:25:01.586]  It's like a Big Mike.
[03:25:01.586 --> 03:25:02.386]  She's in a case.
[03:25:02.386 --> 03:25:03.387]  She is there.
[03:25:03.387 --> 03:25:04.648]  That's when everything is failing.
[03:25:07.330 --> 03:25:09.530]  Donald Trump's going to win.
[03:25:09.530 --> 03:25:11.711]  Joe Biden is a corrupt criminal.
[03:25:11.711 --> 03:25:12.811]  No one can deny it.
[03:25:12.811 --> 03:25:15.932]  Gavin Newsom can't win because he destroyed California.
[03:25:15.932 --> 03:25:20.873]  They're going to run over there, they're going to pull the hammer, break the glass, and they're going to pull her out.
[03:25:20.873 --> 03:25:22.113]  Do you think Big Mike's a handsome man?
[03:25:22.113 --> 03:25:26.734]  I'm trying to get in trouble all the time.
[03:25:26.734 --> 03:25:31.054]  Well, you know, Joan Rivers might have said things that could have... Yeah.
[03:25:31.054 --> 03:25:32.695]  Wow, keep going.
[03:25:32.695 --> 03:25:33.655]  Man, MTG, I love her.
[03:25:34.909 --> 03:25:38.813]  Yeah, no, really though, that would be, uh, I don't think she wants to run.
[03:25:38.813 --> 03:25:47.481]  I don't think, but we know Obama would love it, and actually that'd be their only way to keep going, and I think... Isn't this pretty much the third administration of Biden?
[03:25:47.481 --> 03:25:48.462]  Oh, this is totally the third.
[03:25:48.462 --> 03:25:48.762]  Or Obama?
[03:25:48.762 --> 03:25:50.064]  It's totally the third term.
[03:25:50.623 --> 03:25:51.223]  Absolutely.
[03:25:51.223 --> 03:25:51.803]  It's the third term.
[03:25:51.803 --> 03:25:54.665]  They've got all the same people back in there.
[03:25:54.665 --> 03:25:59.206]  They're running everything just as if they never skipped a beat.
[03:25:59.206 --> 03:26:02.447]  President Trump was like a speed bump for them.
[03:26:02.447 --> 03:26:07.089]  They went right back to it, pursuing everything they were trying to pursue before.
[03:26:07.089 --> 03:26:09.710]  And they want to continue that process.
[03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:11.110]  And that's where we're at.
[03:26:11.110 --> 03:26:15.052]  And yeah, Michelle Obama, she's definitely the one that will try to save the day.
[03:26:16.138 --> 03:26:18.121]  Roger Stone talks to Trump every day.
[03:26:18.121 --> 03:26:20.045]  He says the guy's got ice water.
[03:26:20.045 --> 03:26:22.649]  He says he's only 40 something years.
[03:26:22.649 --> 03:26:24.572]  He says Trump's on cloud nine.
[03:26:24.572 --> 03:26:25.293]  What is your view?
[03:26:25.293 --> 03:26:26.475]  You talk to Trump a lot.
[03:26:26.475 --> 03:26:27.417]  This guy's incredible.
[03:26:28.800 --> 03:26:30.222]  President Trump is remarkable.
[03:26:30.222 --> 03:26:38.712]  I think, I talk to him a lot and I think what I can explain to people is, number one, he is such a real person.
[03:26:38.712 --> 03:26:41.596]  Every time I talk to him he always asks me, how are you doing Marjorie?
[03:26:41.596 --> 03:26:43.278]  He genuinely will ask about me.
[03:26:43.278 --> 03:26:46.081]  He called me and my wife on our honeymoon seven years ago.
[03:26:46.081 --> 03:26:47.223]  How did you even know this was happening?
[03:26:48.544 --> 03:26:50.865]  That's the kind of man he is though.
[03:26:50.865 --> 03:26:55.208]  And I, one thing that all, or there's several things that impressed me.
[03:26:55.208 --> 03:27:01.731]  One of them is the fact that he is such a successful businessman for so many years.
[03:27:01.731 --> 03:27:05.453]  And there, there is no PhD that equals that.
[03:27:05.453 --> 03:27:07.234]  There is no education.
[03:27:07.234 --> 03:27:09.955]  There is nothing that... You're a successful businesswoman.
[03:27:09.955 --> 03:27:11.396]  You know that's the real streets.
[03:27:11.396 --> 03:27:12.116]  It is.
[03:27:12.116 --> 03:27:13.377]  That is it.
[03:27:13.377 --> 03:27:14.918]  If you can provide... That's why you're so successful.
[03:27:14.918 --> 03:27:16.819]  You never talk about it, but you've been very successful.
[03:27:17.535 --> 03:27:19.839]  I have, and it takes hard work to be there.
[03:27:19.839 --> 03:27:22.603]  It takes a lot of hard work to get there, but you learn.
[03:27:22.603 --> 03:27:27.730]  You learn real lessons that you cannot learn with any college or university.
[03:27:27.730 --> 03:27:30.675]  There is no master's degree or PhD program.
[03:27:30.675 --> 03:27:32.297]  You learn on the spot, BS quick.
[03:27:32.297 --> 03:27:32.578]  Right.
[03:27:33.038 --> 03:27:37.423]  And so President Trump has that, and that's how I view government.
[03:27:37.423 --> 03:27:40.846]  My job in government, I only look at it with a business lens.
[03:27:40.846 --> 03:27:43.449]  And President Trump sees it the same way.
[03:27:43.449 --> 03:27:50.476]  The other thing I really appreciate about President Trump is the fact that he plays golf every day makes him extremely healthy.
[03:27:50.476 --> 03:27:51.897]  You know, I work out a lot.
[03:27:51.897 --> 03:27:53.579]  That's something that I'm dedicated to.
[03:27:53.579 --> 03:27:54.800]  I love watching you do the power clink.
[03:27:55.300 --> 03:27:56.381]  Thank you.
[03:27:56.381 --> 03:28:00.045]  But health and fitness helps your mental capacity.
[03:28:00.045 --> 03:28:02.067]  It keeps you sharp.
[03:28:02.067 --> 03:28:09.554]  There's a whole, just everything around it between your health, your fitness, your mental capacity.
[03:28:09.554 --> 03:28:12.016]  So he's stronger, would you say he's stronger now under attack?
[03:28:12.456 --> 03:28:15.318]  I would say he is extremely strong.
[03:28:15.318 --> 03:28:18.080]  Because Brazil said, oh my god, this is a Nietzschean.
[03:28:18.080 --> 03:28:20.041]  She said, that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[03:28:20.041 --> 03:28:20.742]  They're scared.
[03:28:20.742 --> 03:28:21.462]  Don't you get it?
[03:28:21.462 --> 03:28:23.324]  You're in a game of chicken with us.
[03:28:23.324 --> 03:28:26.266]  They should be scared, because I rode down those same streets.
[03:28:26.266 --> 03:28:27.327]  I went to the Atlanta jail.
[03:28:28.007 --> 03:28:31.950]  And I rode down there, down Rice Street, and I saw all the people coming out.
[03:28:31.950 --> 03:28:34.171]  And they were out on the side of the road screaming.
[03:28:34.171 --> 03:28:35.132]  Let's talk about that.
[03:28:35.132 --> 03:28:37.453]  And guys, since she mentioned it, I think the clip's in there.
[03:28:37.453 --> 03:28:38.594]  Make sure we bleep it.
[03:28:38.594 --> 03:28:39.755]  This guy's on fire.
[03:28:39.755 --> 03:28:42.657]  This great American, uh, this great American black man.
[03:28:42.657 --> 03:28:45.539]  Uh, I mean, Joe Rogan sent me this like three days ago.
[03:28:45.539 --> 03:28:46.039]  This is gone.
[03:28:46.039 --> 03:28:46.659]  I'm not name-dropping.
[03:28:46.659 --> 03:28:48.761]  It's just, that's, that's how viral this is.
[03:28:48.761 --> 03:28:50.182]  We're gonna come back, play this.
[03:28:50.182 --> 03:28:52.623]  MTG is in the house.
[03:28:52.623 --> 03:28:55.005]  We'll give you the URL, too, to get behind the impeachment straight ahead.
[03:28:56.701 --> 03:29:02.465]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[03:29:02.465 --> 03:29:07.289]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[03:29:07.289 --> 03:29:10.331]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[03:29:10.331 --> 03:29:19.899]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[03:29:19.899 --> 03:29:22.481]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.

[03:32:22.384 --> 03:32:24.566]  And it's the strongest curcuminoid out there.
[03:32:24.566 --> 03:32:28.048]  Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid.
[03:32:28.048 --> 03:32:30.370]  Most brands are 5% cumidin.
[03:32:30.370 --> 03:32:32.652]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[03:32:32.652 --> 03:32:35.514]  This is the strongest anybody makes.
[03:32:35.514 --> 03:32:37.615]  95% curcuminoid.

[03:32:40.177 --> 03:32:42.018]  I have been out of this myself for months.

[03:32:48.502 --> 03:32:51.824]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:09.494 --> 03:33:16.997]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[03:33:16.997 --> 03:33:28.082]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[03:33:28.082 --> 03:33:34.544]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[03:33:34.544 --> 03:33:39.006]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[03:33:39.266 --> 03:33:48.428]  Joe Biden literally saying, y'all need to come, they need to come up with a new vaccine and they need to come up with a way that people have to take it no matter what.
[03:33:48.428 --> 03:33:51.329]  I'm willing to die about my freedom.
[03:33:51.329 --> 03:33:54.090]  I'm willing to die about my medical independence.
[03:33:54.090 --> 03:33:59.131]  So all I got to say to you in that video, try that s*** and f*** around and find out.
[03:34:04.413 --> 03:34:09.449]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:34:11.260 --> 03:34:16.584]  Well, the future president of the United States, and I'm going to say that to kiss up to her.
[03:34:16.584 --> 03:34:18.605]  I feel it.
[03:34:18.605 --> 03:34:25.850]  I think the first female president of the United States, I think in maybe four or eight years, is going to be MTG.
[03:34:25.850 --> 03:34:30.853]  And I can't wait to support her for president of the United States if we save this country.
[03:34:30.853 --> 03:34:33.315]  But MTG, you wanted to get to what's coming next today.
[03:34:33.315 --> 03:34:34.856]  You said you can't wait to hear what's coming next.
[03:34:34.856 --> 03:34:36.617]  This is what InfoWars is all about.
[03:34:36.617 --> 03:34:39.819]  All the main numbers show economy and free fall in reality.
[03:34:39.819 --> 03:34:40.920]  We're going to hit that in a moment.
[03:34:41.700 --> 03:34:46.401]  But first, this isn't entertainment seeing Trump being attacked like this.
[03:34:46.401 --> 03:34:51.822]  This isn't like a boxing match, or a train wreck, or a soap opera.
[03:34:51.822 --> 03:35:02.145]  This is our future here, and yeah he's confident, and yeah it's waking people up, but we can't underestimate our enemies and what they may pull, because as Donna Brazile said, they're cornered rats and they're losing.
[03:35:02.745 --> 03:35:03.085]  I don't
[03:35:23.638 --> 03:35:24.199]  Blame us.
[03:35:24.199 --> 03:35:28.122]  They say it's this epidemic that doesn't exist per capita.
[03:35:28.122 --> 03:35:32.806]  And I'm really concerned about them going after Trump because logically, historically, that's the next move of the graph.
[03:35:34.108 --> 03:35:34.788]  Maybe.
[03:35:34.788 --> 03:35:39.450]  What I worry about, actually, is I worry about a hot war.
[03:35:39.450 --> 03:35:43.231]  I worry about a very serious war.
[03:35:43.231 --> 03:35:53.774]  Because historically, if you look at our country, historically, whenever America has gone to war, the American people rally around whoever the president is.
[03:35:53.774 --> 03:35:55.314]  We remember George Bush after 9-11.
[03:35:55.314 --> 03:35:56.695]  Oh, what a surprise.
[03:35:56.695 --> 03:35:56.935]  Yes.
[03:35:57.685 --> 03:36:07.548]  So we remember, that's our natural instinct, to rally behind our country, behind our flag.
[03:36:07.548 --> 03:36:11.909]  So many people will sign up to join the military and they rally behind the President.
[03:36:11.909 --> 03:36:19.151]  The biggest thing I'm concerned about, Alex, is I'm concerned that they will go to the next level with Ukraine, put troops on the ground.
[03:36:19.611 --> 03:36:23.312]  Russia will absolutely see it for what it really is.
[03:36:23.312 --> 03:36:29.813]  They will go to war with us, and the United States and Russia will be in a hot war.
[03:36:29.813 --> 03:36:40.675]  That is my biggest concern, and I think that would be something that the Democrats, the State Department, the Biden Administration could move towards, because they will not back off of Ukraine.
[03:36:40.675 --> 03:36:44.176]  And that's exactly what Tucker's been saying, and now they're sending F-16s.
[03:36:44.176 --> 03:36:44.716]  We know U.S.
[03:36:44.716 --> 03:36:47.597]  troops are there as advisors, and we know Ukraine's losing now.
[03:36:47.597 --> 03:36:48.637]  So what are you hearing in Congress?
[03:36:48.857 --> 03:36:50.159]  My amendment failed on that.
[03:36:50.159 --> 03:36:52.982]  I had an amendment to block the F-16s going to Ukraine.
[03:36:52.982 --> 03:36:54.544]  It failed on the House floor.
[03:36:54.544 --> 03:36:57.708]  We didn't have enough members of Congress to vote for it.
[03:36:57.708 --> 03:37:00.191]  That's the danger we're in, Alex.
[03:37:00.191 --> 03:37:01.413]  Clear escalation.
[03:37:01.413 --> 03:37:02.895]  There's not much levels left.
[03:37:02.895 --> 03:37:03.676]  No, there's very...
[03:37:04.997 --> 03:37:08.219]  From day one, I voted no for Ukraine.
[03:37:08.219 --> 03:37:10.040]  I voted no for money going there.
[03:37:10.040 --> 03:37:12.482]  I voted no to sanctions on Russia.
[03:37:12.482 --> 03:37:22.288]  I voted no to all of it because the only solution there that makes any rational sense is for those two countries to come to peace terms, and that's between them.
[03:37:22.288 --> 03:37:24.010]  That doesn't have to involve the United States.
[03:37:24.010 --> 03:37:25.371]  And Trump says he can end it overnight.
[03:37:25.371 --> 03:37:25.951]  That's true.
[03:37:25.951 --> 03:37:27.272]  The media says he can't.
[03:37:27.272 --> 03:37:27.732]  The U.S.
[03:37:27.732 --> 03:37:28.152]  runs it.
[03:37:28.152 --> 03:37:28.813]  Of course he can end it.
[03:37:29.013 --> 03:37:30.314]  Yeah, it can end overnight.
[03:37:30.314 --> 03:37:30.934]  You want to know how?
[03:37:30.934 --> 03:37:31.734]  We cut off the money.
[03:37:31.734 --> 03:37:33.135]  Zelensky even said it.
[03:37:33.135 --> 03:37:37.096]  He won't even have elections unless America funds his elections.
[03:37:37.096 --> 03:37:39.357]  I'll tell you how bad it is over there.
[03:37:39.357 --> 03:37:53.262]  The United States of America, we send Ukraine one billion, I'm sorry, you watching, people at home, send one billion dollars every single month, every single month to Ukraine to fund their government.
[03:37:53.922 --> 03:37:55.023]  That's not the war.
[03:37:55.023 --> 03:37:57.364]  That's to keep the lights on for their government.
[03:37:57.364 --> 03:38:00.585]  But $700 to people in Maui.
[03:38:00.585 --> 03:38:03.186]  $700 one time for the people in Maui.
[03:38:03.186 --> 03:38:04.307]  And that's outrageous.
[03:38:04.307 --> 03:38:05.627]  That's unacceptable.
[03:38:05.627 --> 03:38:11.350]  But I do believe what we could see is we could see them move us into a full-scale war.
[03:38:12.170 --> 03:38:14.752]  In Ukraine, all in the name of protecting Europe.
[03:38:14.752 --> 03:38:18.175]  They're always saying that Putin, his goal is to take Europe.
[03:38:18.175 --> 03:38:22.438]  We have seen no evidence of that whatsoever, and I'm not defending Vladimir Putin.
[03:38:22.438 --> 03:38:25.841]  I'm just saying, if you look at it black and white.
[03:38:25.841 --> 03:38:29.344]  If Putin had hundreds of thousands of troops in Canada, I'd say go to war with him.
[03:38:29.344 --> 03:38:30.405]  We're there starting this.
[03:38:30.825 --> 03:38:31.605]  Right.
[03:38:31.605 --> 03:38:32.646]  But think about this.
[03:38:32.646 --> 03:38:39.089]  I mean, I'm old enough to remember, you remember, every time we've ever been at war, didn't we watch it every single night on television?
[03:38:39.089 --> 03:38:44.192]  Remember how we would watch on television the bombing of Baghdad or the bombings in Afghanistan?
[03:38:44.192 --> 03:38:45.352]  It was like entertainment.
[03:38:45.352 --> 03:38:45.673]  It was.
[03:38:45.673 --> 03:38:48.394]  It was like sick, disgusting entertainment.
[03:38:48.394 --> 03:38:51.075]  But they showed it nonstop on the news.
[03:38:51.075 --> 03:38:58.959]  Let me ask you, when is the last time anyone has been able to turn on the television and watch the war that America is funding and fueling?
[03:39:01.060 --> 03:39:02.962]  No, you never see it.
[03:39:02.962 --> 03:39:06.064]  They say it's bigger than Vietnam, Korea.
[03:39:06.064 --> 03:39:07.965]  I mean, it's hundreds of 300,000 to 400,000 dead.
[03:39:07.965 --> 03:39:09.266]  This is a full war.
[03:39:09.266 --> 03:39:14.589]  Tell me where the CNN war reporters are and why aren't they in a bunker with Ukrainian troops?
[03:39:14.589 --> 03:39:15.249]  That's what they used to do.
[03:39:15.249 --> 03:39:16.150]  That's what we always saw.
[03:39:16.150 --> 03:39:17.231]  Now it's like it's a war on another planet.
[03:39:23.475 --> 03:39:24.756]  It's an invisible war.
[03:39:24.756 --> 03:39:25.656]  You don't get to see it.
[03:39:25.656 --> 03:39:26.877]  You're paying for it.
[03:39:26.877 --> 03:39:28.238]  But you don't get to see it.
[03:39:28.238 --> 03:39:29.559]  You want to know why they're lying?
[03:39:29.559 --> 03:39:31.120]  Ukraine is losing this war.
[03:39:32.542 --> 03:39:35.124]  I'm probably the only member of Congress that will say that out loud.
[03:39:35.124 --> 03:39:35.504]  No, you are.
[03:39:35.504 --> 03:39:38.146]  And I love the meme, how you're not smart.
[03:39:38.146 --> 03:39:39.787]  You're one of the smartest people I know.
[03:39:39.787 --> 03:39:40.988]  You're so smart.
[03:39:40.988 --> 03:39:44.670]  And I love the left claims they're old and power women, but they go, oh, MTG's dumb.
[03:39:44.670 --> 03:39:50.474]  No, you're saying the truth that is complex and sophisticated, and it's just disgusting.
[03:39:50.474 --> 03:39:52.535]  And since when did Democrats support World War III?
[03:39:52.535 --> 03:39:53.096]  I guess they do now.
[03:39:53.826 --> 03:39:56.267]  Absolutely they do right now.
[03:39:56.267 --> 03:39:57.667]  They have to.
[03:39:57.667 --> 03:40:02.929]  They have to support World War III because it supports their climate change agenda.
[03:40:02.929 --> 03:40:05.089]  It changes the world.
[03:40:05.089 --> 03:40:11.251]  If you support a massive global war, it completely shifts everything.
[03:40:11.251 --> 03:40:12.872]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[03:40:12.872 --> 03:40:20.074]  They're trying to make a full shift in the way, basically the way we live, the way governments work, trade policies.
[03:40:20.074 --> 03:40:20.454]  But they're
[03:40:21.494 --> 03:40:26.558]  They're creeping onto the most dangerous levels that will hurt all of us, and here's why.
[03:40:26.558 --> 03:40:31.482]  Because we sanctioned Russia, Russia got smart and they went and made trade deals with China.
[03:40:31.482 --> 03:40:34.143]  And then they started making trade deals with other countries.
[03:40:34.143 --> 03:40:35.104]  That was my next point.
[03:40:35.104 --> 03:40:37.746]  This is destroying America's soft power.
[03:40:37.746 --> 03:40:42.710]  And I love our country, I love our empire, but I hate seeing America go way down in the world.
[03:40:42.970 --> 03:40:44.151]  Well, look at BRICS.
[03:40:44.151 --> 03:40:48.833]  Because of the war in Ukraine, they have created BRICS.
[03:40:48.833 --> 03:40:52.454]  Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
[03:40:52.454 --> 03:40:59.158]  They've created this very powerful, growing international group where they can do trade, buy and sell goods.
[03:40:59.158 --> 03:41:01.059]  The Indians just bought billions in oil.
[03:41:01.059 --> 03:41:05.561]  Yeah, and they're going to tank our dollar because they trade in their own currencies, not the U.S.
[03:41:05.561 --> 03:41:05.901]  dollar.
[03:41:05.901 --> 03:41:08.362]  They can trade in their own currency.
[03:41:08.362 --> 03:41:09.763]  So what's the bigger 30,000 foot view?
[03:41:11.667 --> 03:41:18.632]  The 30,000 foot view is war is an option for the Democrats, in their minds, to win the election.
[03:41:18.632 --> 03:41:19.052]  Insane.
[03:41:19.052 --> 03:41:21.013]  Because they think it will rally the people.
[03:41:21.013 --> 03:41:25.236]  So you're saying what's coming next, and I agree with you, Tucker, is war.
[03:41:25.236 --> 03:41:26.117]  Expanded war.
[03:41:26.117 --> 03:41:26.697]  Absolutely.
[03:41:26.697 --> 03:41:27.498]  I see war.
[03:41:27.498 --> 03:41:41.427]  I see war because I introduce amendment after amendment on the House floor and I cannot get my amendments passed to stop F-16s, to stop funding to go to Ukraine, even though the American people overwhelmingly do not support the Ukraine war.
[03:41:41.868 --> 03:41:44.399]  And by the way, the Russians can shoot down a 5,000...
[03:41:46.820 --> 03:41:47.020]  Yeah.
[03:42:17.240 --> 03:42:19.962]  Yeah, we want new mandates, but you're crazy, we don't want new mandates.
[03:42:19.962 --> 03:42:21.563]  Have you seen that little mind control?
[03:42:21.563 --> 03:42:22.584]  Oh, of course.
[03:42:22.584 --> 03:42:25.125]  And then, and now it's climate change.
[03:42:25.125 --> 03:42:38.093]  And oh, the poor people in Burning Man, and they're going to run out of there convinced, brainwashed, that that's what happened to them, was because man-made climate change nearly killed them in the desert of Nevada.
[03:42:38.093 --> 03:42:41.295]  They're going to run out of there and spread that.
[03:42:41.295 --> 03:42:45.558]  It'll be multiple issues, but the ultimate one is a world war.
[03:42:46.099 --> 03:42:47.528]  And I believe that's where we're going.
[03:42:48.979 --> 03:42:49.799]  Wow.
[03:42:49.799 --> 03:42:51.880]  Let's talk about impeachment again.
[03:42:51.880 --> 03:42:53.480]  You've got a website.
[03:42:53.480 --> 03:42:54.320]  What do people do there?
[03:42:54.320 --> 03:42:55.161]  How do they get involved?
[03:42:55.161 --> 03:42:57.881]  Because we need to put... Bodies is back!
[03:42:57.881 --> 03:43:05.283]  The ultimate tumeric product on the market has returned to InfowarsStore.com and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[03:43:05.283 --> 03:43:10.665]  Utilized for thousands of years, tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[03:43:10.665 --> 03:43:18.307]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of tumeric and its active components.
[03:43:18.507 --> 03:43:29.516]  Turmeric bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[03:43:29.516 --> 03:43:41.285]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[03:43:41.525 --> 03:43:45.010]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.

[03:43:56.246 --> 03:44:02.608]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[03:44:02.608 --> 03:44:09.030]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[03:44:09.030 --> 03:44:12.391]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[03:44:12.391 --> 03:44:21.554]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:44:21.554 --> 03:44:22.014]  Look it up.
[03:44:22.634 --> 03:44:23.995]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[03:44:23.995 --> 03:44:27.236]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[03:44:27.236 --> 03:44:30.357]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.

[03:44:32.678 --> 03:44:35.319]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[03:44:35.319 --> 03:44:36.899]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[03:44:36.899 --> 03:44:37.899]  It is amazing.
[03:44:37.899 --> 03:44:39.520]  It's great for your home, your business.
[03:44:39.520 --> 03:44:42.741]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[03:44:42.741 --> 03:44:44.162]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[03:44:44.162 --> 03:44:47.923]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[03:44:48.183 --> 03:44:50.725]  Get yours today at m4workstore.com for a limited time.

[03:44:53.287 --> 03:44:54.589]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[03:44:54.589 --> 03:44:55.830]  You need this filter.
[03:44:55.830 --> 03:44:57.231]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[03:44:57.231 --> 03:44:58.192]  I thought it was next week.
[03:44:58.192 --> 03:45:02.615]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[03:45:02.615 --> 03:45:04.837]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[03:45:04.837 --> 03:45:08.680]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:10.582]  Overhead shot, please.
[03:45:10.582 --> 03:45:14.725]  Look how full this bottle is.
[03:45:14.725 --> 03:45:15.947]  Right to the top, folks.

[03:45:23.530 --> 03:45:27.734]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[03:45:27.734 --> 03:45:29.735]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[03:45:29.735 --> 03:45:30.916]  This is 95%.
[03:45:30.916 --> 03:45:39.183]  Super concentrated, so like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[03:45:39.183 --> 03:45:40.665]  It's that powerful.
[03:45:40.665 --> 03:45:41.826]  Or more!
[03:45:41.826 --> 03:45:43.947]  So they're available at infowarstore.com.
[03:45:45.339 --> 03:45:47.942]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[03:45:47.942 --> 03:45:49.143]  Hold out for almost eight months.

[03:46:02.281 --> 03:46:11.546]  The supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get the highest quality colonel silver for almost three years back in stock.
[03:46:11.546 --> 03:46:13.087]  But now we've got it.

[03:46:15.208 --> 03:46:16.609]  We got a limited shipment.
[03:46:16.609 --> 03:46:18.290]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[03:46:18.290 --> 03:46:24.354]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal,

[03:46:58.061 --> 03:47:02.667]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:02.667 --> 03:47:03.969]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:47:06.704 --> 03:47:08.425]  This very easily for me.
[03:47:08.425 --> 03:47:10.826]  You're going to click for you real fast.
[03:47:10.826 --> 03:47:15.688]  Joe Biden is the best intelligence asset they have.
[03:47:15.688 --> 03:47:17.168]  You can't get a better one.
[03:47:17.168 --> 03:47:21.650]  You can't get a better president for the intelligence community than Joe Biden.
[03:47:21.650 --> 03:47:22.430]  Do you want to know why?
[03:47:22.430 --> 03:47:23.851]  Think about it.
[03:47:23.851 --> 03:47:25.531]  He's completely controlled.
[03:47:25.531 --> 03:47:29.373]  This is a man that was a Catholic that used to be against abortion.
[03:47:29.373 --> 03:47:30.633]  Where is he at now?
[03:47:30.633 --> 03:47:34.315]  He is for cutting the body parts off of children to change their gender.
[03:47:34.915 --> 03:47:36.496]  Why is he this way?
[03:47:36.496 --> 03:47:37.958]  Because he is controlled.
[03:47:37.958 --> 03:47:39.299]  Why is he controlled?
[03:47:39.299 --> 03:47:41.160]  Because he's a criminal.
[03:47:41.160 --> 03:47:47.766]  And he's caught and they've told him, we'll protect you, we got you covered Joe, as long as you keep going down this trail.
[03:47:47.766 --> 03:47:49.448]  So he gets all the blame and they hide behind him.
[03:47:51.069 --> 03:47:52.750]  They don't want to get rid of Joe Biden.
[03:47:52.750 --> 03:47:54.150]  He's the best.
[03:47:54.150 --> 03:47:55.010]  Think about it like this.
[03:47:55.010 --> 03:48:00.592]  Now, for the mass, the public that doesn't really pay attention to politics, they don't know about the Hunter Biden laptop.
[03:48:00.592 --> 03:48:04.654]  They barely, they might know about it a little bit, but they don't really know.
[03:48:04.654 --> 03:48:12.916]  They see Joe Biden, he's innocent, sweet grandpa that stumbles his words every now and then, likes to get ice cream and just wants to help America.
[03:48:12.916 --> 03:48:14.117]  And he wants to help Ukraine.
[03:48:14.477 --> 03:48:16.698]  That's how they see Joe Biden.
[03:48:16.698 --> 03:48:26.423]  So they want to continue to keep that image of Joe Biden for the masses of people that are busy in their lives every single day.
[03:48:26.423 --> 03:48:37.690]  Busy going to work, working two to three jobs, taking care of their children, maybe paying attention to sports, enjoying, just enjoying life, the great life we have as Americans.
[03:48:37.690 --> 03:48:41.732]  They are not in tune to everything about Joe Biden and for
[03:48:42.372 --> 03:48:52.625]  For that issue alone, the best president that can exist in the White House, especially for the intelligence community, is Joe Biden.
[03:48:52.625 --> 03:48:54.207]  They keep him looking innocent.
[03:48:54.207 --> 03:48:55.489]  They protect him.
[03:48:55.489 --> 03:48:57.732]  They allow him to stay in the White House.
[03:48:58.152 --> 03:49:04.555]  They allow him to enjoy all the glory and they cover up his crimes as long as he's controlled.
[03:49:04.555 --> 03:49:06.216]  He continues their foreign wars.
[03:49:06.216 --> 03:49:10.577]  He continues to advance their Marxist agenda for America.
[03:49:10.577 --> 03:49:15.620]  He's the perfect president for the left and the intelligence community.
[03:49:15.620 --> 03:49:16.440]  He really is.
[03:49:16.440 --> 03:49:25.824]  So, as Donna Brazile and others admit that this is exploding Trump, as if they wouldn't know that would happen, what do they do as they get increasingly cornered?
[03:49:26.257 --> 03:49:27.497]  Here's what they've done.
[03:49:27.497 --> 03:49:30.398]  They've indicted President Trump too many times.
[03:49:30.398 --> 03:49:31.498]  Think about it.
[03:49:31.498 --> 03:49:37.220]  The more they indict him, the more they prove that all of this is political, and all of this is a lie.
[03:49:37.220 --> 03:49:40.500]  And people pay attention more, and more, and more.
[03:49:40.500 --> 03:49:46.902]  And the more people pay attention, they see it for exactly what it is, and it exposes everything they're doing.
[03:49:47.402 --> 03:49:48.683]  And you talked about this earlier.
[03:50:05.436 --> 03:50:07.857]  We saw double black folks voting for Trump.
[03:50:07.857 --> 03:50:12.240]  Usually 10% but Republican like 20-30% depending on the demographic.
[03:50:12.240 --> 03:50:13.541]  Males, females.
[03:50:13.541 --> 03:50:15.822]  Now it's just everywhere.
[03:50:15.822 --> 03:50:19.164]  All the big rappers, all the big people going against the system.
[03:50:19.164 --> 03:50:20.084]  They get it.
[03:50:20.084 --> 03:50:22.465]  It's viral everywhere.
[03:50:22.465 --> 03:50:23.386]  You live in Georgia.
[03:50:23.386 --> 03:50:25.707]  I mean it looks like they're losing the black vote.
[03:50:25.707 --> 03:50:26.408]  I think Trump gets 50% now.
[03:50:27.228 --> 03:50:31.874]  I think he will, but we have to pay attention to absentee ballot voter fraud.
[03:50:31.874 --> 03:50:33.676]  Look at the case in Mississippi.
[03:50:33.676 --> 03:50:36.640]  There's a Democrat in Mississippi... Oh, I meant to play that video.
[03:50:36.640 --> 03:50:37.301]  Explain that to people.
[03:50:37.301 --> 03:50:40.265]  Yeah, so there's a Democrat in Mississippi... He has the text messages.
[03:50:40.265 --> 03:50:41.847]  He has the proof.
[03:50:41.847 --> 03:50:44.691]  The absolute proof that his election was stolen
[03:50:45.051 --> 03:50:46.872]  With absentee ballot fraud.
[03:50:46.872 --> 03:50:50.755]  They were coming in with thumb drives for the election machines.
[03:50:50.755 --> 03:50:53.196]  They stole the election from him.
[03:50:53.196 --> 03:50:55.057]  And he has the proof of it.
[03:50:55.057 --> 03:50:57.098]  And he is yelling and screaming about it.
[03:50:57.098 --> 03:50:59.940]  And we've known this is how they've always done it.
[03:50:59.940 --> 03:51:02.222]  It has always been an issue.
[03:51:02.222 --> 03:51:04.003]  Elections get stolen.
[03:51:04.003 --> 03:51:07.525]  And Democrats even steal them from other Democrats.
[03:51:07.525 --> 03:51:10.347]  It's not just Republicans they steal elections from.
[03:51:10.347 --> 03:51:12.528]  It's absolutely against other Democrats.
[03:51:12.888 --> 03:51:15.009]  Look at what happened to Bernie Sanders.
[03:51:15.009 --> 03:51:18.231]  Hillary Clinton stole that election from Bernie Sanders.
[03:51:18.231 --> 03:51:23.933]  So for President Trump to say my election was stolen, regular people are like, hell yeah it was!
[03:51:23.933 --> 03:51:26.954]  Because everybody knows that we voted and elected him.
[03:51:26.954 --> 03:51:27.215]  Exactly.
[03:51:27.215 --> 03:51:29.676]  I'm not like a leftist that will overstate our position.
[03:51:30.496 --> 03:51:32.497]  I'm seeing explosive awakening.
[03:51:32.497 --> 03:51:41.580]  Like, you think of any prominent talk show host now, or figure, whether it's James Woods or Joe Rogan or Russell Brand or Tulsi Gabbards or RFK Jr.
[03:51:41.580 --> 03:51:44.301]  or people like Jimmy Dore.
[03:51:44.301 --> 03:51:49.383]  They're all, Trump's great, the New World Order's bad, the globalists are evil, we're in a coup, screw the Democrats.
[03:51:49.383 --> 03:51:52.624]  I mean, they've got hardcore liberals joining Trump.
[03:51:52.624 --> 03:51:53.785]  This is huge.
[03:51:53.785 --> 03:51:54.605]  It is huge.
[03:51:55.265 --> 03:52:00.267]  But there's a lot of things that are happening that, you know, we don't talk about a lot on the news.
[03:52:00.267 --> 03:52:01.668]  You've got five minutes left.
[03:52:01.668 --> 03:52:02.248]  You're awesome.
[03:52:02.248 --> 03:52:03.208]  You've got the floor.
[03:52:03.208 --> 03:52:04.369]  Address that camera right there.
[03:52:04.369 --> 03:52:05.129]  You tell them.
[03:52:05.129 --> 03:52:05.749]  Okay, I'd love to.
[03:52:05.749 --> 03:52:06.610]  You're hosting right now.
[03:52:06.610 --> 03:52:07.650]  Okay, great.
[03:52:07.650 --> 03:52:08.810]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:52:08.810 --> 03:52:09.791]  Thank you for being here.
[03:52:09.791 --> 03:52:11.311]  Oh my God.
[03:52:11.311 --> 03:52:13.912]  So here's something that I think is a major issue.
[03:52:13.912 --> 03:52:17.214]  So the Friday jobs report comes out.
[03:52:17.214 --> 03:52:18.374]  1.2 million Americans.
[03:52:18.374 --> 03:52:19.535]  And we have those graphics, guys.
[03:52:19.535 --> 03:52:20.055]  Put them on screen.
[03:52:20.055 --> 03:52:20.335]  Start over.
[03:52:21.467 --> 03:52:23.989]  1.2 million Americans lost their jobs.
[03:52:23.989 --> 03:52:26.350]  That was on Friday's jobs report.
[03:52:26.350 --> 03:52:34.516]  But at the same time, over 600,000 foreigners, people from other countries, gained American jobs.
[03:52:34.516 --> 03:52:35.938]  So put that into perspective.
[03:52:37.439 --> 03:52:44.304]  1.2 million Americans lost their jobs, but we imported foreign workers and gave them American jobs.
[03:52:44.304 --> 03:52:50.849]  And I want to talk about that, Alex, because this is what I see at home in my district, but it's happening all over the country.
[03:52:50.849 --> 03:52:51.369]  And talk about it.
[03:52:51.369 --> 03:52:53.851]  I'm going to go to the control room and I'm going to put these graphs on the screen.
[03:52:53.851 --> 03:52:54.211]  Keep going.
[03:52:55.012 --> 03:52:56.892]  So, tax credits.
[03:52:56.892 --> 03:53:01.974]  We see state governments, we see county governments, but we see the federal government as well.
[03:53:01.974 --> 03:53:07.815]  And the Biden administration has done this extensively, especially because of the Green New Deal.
[03:53:07.815 --> 03:53:18.758]  They've given tax credits and given a lot of your hard-earned tax dollars to these foreign countries' businesses to bring them in to give Americans jobs.
[03:53:18.758 --> 03:53:21.418]  And let me explain the danger of that for you.
[03:53:21.418 --> 03:53:23.799]  So, for example, you'll see maybe a
[03:53:24.299 --> 03:53:27.341]  A battery company because of course they love green energy.
[03:53:54.119 --> 03:53:58.941]  So that's paid for by Georgia taxpayers, which is so insulting.
[03:53:58.941 --> 03:54:00.941]  And here's why it's insulting.
[03:54:00.941 --> 03:54:19.287]  When a foreign country's business gets to move into, say, my state or my district or your state or somewhere around where you live, and they get the help from the federal government and the state government to move there with tax dollars, they are directly competing with the existing businesses that are already there.
[03:54:19.287 --> 03:54:20.568]  And here's how they're competing.
[03:54:20.928 --> 03:54:22.989]  We have a worker shortage in America.
[03:54:22.989 --> 03:54:25.670]  We don't have enough workers on every level.
[03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:33.594]  That goes from doctors, pilots, nurses, construction workers, plumbers, linemen, you name it, truck drivers.
[03:54:33.594 --> 03:54:35.535]  We do not have enough workers in America.
[03:54:36.055 --> 03:54:50.929]  So our government pays these foreign countries to bring their businesses into our country and then these foreign country businesses get set up and they steal workers away from the existing American companies.
[03:54:51.590 --> 03:54:54.231]  That is the big problem that's happening right now.
[03:54:54.231 --> 03:55:00.573]  So we're seeing job reports where we're seeing 1.2 million Americans lose their jobs.
[03:55:00.573 --> 03:55:00.893]  Why?
[03:55:00.893 --> 03:55:02.433]  Because of Bidenomics.
[03:55:02.433 --> 03:55:04.794]  Bidenomics is destroying our economy.
[03:55:04.794 --> 03:55:06.794]  It's destroying small businesses.
[03:55:06.794 --> 03:55:10.395]  It's destroying many ways for people to keep up.
[03:55:10.395 --> 03:55:17.297]  And so you see these American companies failing and faltering and Americans are losing their jobs.
[03:55:17.297 --> 03:55:17.697]  But guess what?
[03:55:17.697 --> 03:55:19.718]  It's because of an unfair playing field.
[03:55:19.898 --> 03:55:20.800]  That's right.
[03:55:20.800 --> 03:55:22.363]  But think about how bad it is.
[03:55:22.363 --> 03:55:25.830]  So I have the flooring industry in Dalton, Georgia.
[03:55:25.830 --> 03:55:26.771]  It is a massive issue.
[03:55:26.771 --> 03:55:29.417]  By the way, you're not talking out of your patootie here.
[03:55:29.417 --> 03:55:31.100]  You're a very successful business lady.
[03:55:31.100 --> 03:55:31.481]  You're alright.
[03:55:31.823 --> 03:55:32.303]  That's right.
[03:55:32.303 --> 03:55:34.625]  I've run a construction company for over 25 years.
[03:55:34.625 --> 03:55:36.686]  I've been in business for a long time.
[03:55:36.686 --> 03:55:37.546]  Here's what's happening.
[03:55:37.546 --> 03:55:40.368]  So we have these massive flooring companies.
[03:55:40.368 --> 03:55:44.491]  I'm talking about some of the biggest in the world are in Dalton, Georgia.
[03:55:44.491 --> 03:55:53.076]  Well, we have Joe Biden bragging because he funded a solar panel company to be able to expand and build another manufacturing plant.
[03:55:53.076 --> 03:55:56.278]  And they've also funded other companies to move into my district.
[03:55:56.278 --> 03:55:57.619]  Well, guess what's happening?
[03:55:57.619 --> 03:55:59.660]  This battery production plant,
[03:56:00.680 --> 03:56:04.162]  I even saw their brainwashing employees into communism at the meetings.
[03:56:04.162 --> 03:56:06.443]  Well, let me tell you what they do.
[03:56:06.443 --> 03:56:08.103]  There aren't enough workers.
[03:56:08.103 --> 03:56:09.884]  There aren't enough workers, Alex.
[03:56:09.884 --> 03:56:15.387]  So they are stealing workers from the flooring company's manufacturing plants.
[03:56:15.387 --> 03:56:18.168]  They're stealing workers from other companies.
[03:56:18.168 --> 03:56:21.049]  And no one can keep workers.
[03:56:21.049 --> 03:56:22.189]  The people just aren't there.
[03:56:22.189 --> 03:56:22.910]  So you know what they're doing?
[03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:26.392]  They're importing them from overseas.
[03:56:26.392 --> 03:56:32.516]  So in my district, they're bringing in thousands of foreign workers because they don't have enough workers.
[03:56:32.516 --> 03:56:33.677]  Unfortunately, we're out of time.
[03:56:33.677 --> 03:56:36.379]  Anytime you want the show, you can host it or take over.
[03:56:36.379 --> 03:56:37.219]  You are awesome.
[03:56:37.219 --> 03:56:38.420]  In closing, what do we do about this?
[03:56:38.902 --> 03:56:43.364]  What we do about it is we have to fight like hell to fight for America First policies.
[03:56:43.364 --> 03:56:45.586]  We get President Trump back in the White House.
[03:56:45.586 --> 03:56:48.347]  You guys go to impeachmentteam.com.
[03:56:48.347 --> 03:56:54.310]  We're going to impeach Joe Biden and we're going to, we are going to painfully, painfully make him go through this.
[03:56:54.310 --> 03:57:00.053]  And that's why they're so scared because administratively, legally, we can end all this very quickly.
[03:57:00.053 --> 03:57:01.014]  Could we end it right now?
[03:57:01.570 --> 03:57:02.951]  No, but we had Trump in.
[03:57:02.951 --> 03:57:05.011]  Oh, if we had Trump in, none of this would be happening.
[03:57:05.011 --> 03:57:06.112]  That's why we want him back.
[03:57:06.112 --> 03:57:07.392]  Well, what an amazing time.
[03:57:07.392 --> 03:57:12.895]  Thank you for coming in studio and spending part of your weekend with us.
[03:57:12.895 --> 03:57:15.516]  We can't wait till you're back in Congress in a week or so.
[03:57:15.516 --> 03:57:20.178]  Can't wait to get dinner with you and just the great folks from Right Side Broadcasting are here.
[03:57:20.178 --> 03:57:21.618]  So we are really excited.
[03:57:21.618 --> 03:57:23.239]  MTG, other websites people should visit?
[03:57:23.639 --> 03:57:26.821]  Oh, you can go to mtg4america.com.
[03:57:26.821 --> 03:57:28.282]  mtg4america.com.
[03:57:28.282 --> 03:57:29.622]  I always appreciate your help.
[03:57:29.622 --> 03:57:30.383]  Thank you.
[03:57:30.383 --> 03:57:35.566]  MTG is our future president, and she is the lady we need to back.
[03:57:35.566 --> 03:57:38.747]  Owen Schroeder takes over in two minutes with Sunday Night Live.
[03:57:38.747 --> 03:57:39.308]  Spread the word.
[03:57:39.308 --> 03:57:40.088]  We love you.
[03:57:40.088 --> 03:57:41.349]  MTG, thank you so much.
[03:57:41.349 --> 03:57:41.729]  Thank you.
[03:57:46.880 --> 03:57:55.044]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[03:57:55.044 --> 03:58:00.526]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[03:58:00.526 --> 03:58:05.468]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[03:58:06.849 --> 03:58:11.695]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[03:58:11.695 --> 03:58:17.341]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:58:19.238 --> 03:58:28.101]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems, our brain and our heart.
[03:58:28.101 --> 03:58:32.882]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.
[03:58:32.882 --> 03:58:38.024]  Get your essential Omega-3 fatty acids from the best sources available.
[03:58:38.024 --> 03:58:41.065]  Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil.

[03:58:47.065 --> 03:58:50.208]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:58:50.208 --> 03:58:52.510]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:58:52.510 --> 03:58:56.433]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:58:56.433 --> 03:59:04.541]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, the people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:59:04.541 --> 03:59:13.148]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:59:14.173 --> 03:59:17.055]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:59:17.055 --> 03:59:23.598]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:59:23.598 --> 03:59:34.885]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[03:59:35.585 --> 03:59:39.869]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at m4store.com.
[03:59:39.869 --> 03:59:44.834]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:59:44.834 --> 03:59:48.077]  Please take action now.
[03:59:48.077 --> 03:59:53.963]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
