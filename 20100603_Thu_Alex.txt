[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  board that certifies anyone to be able to have a blog or website that purports to
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  be reporting news or analysis the end of the First Amendment we have no fewer
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.000]  than 14 of Obama's top appointees or czars calling for an open end of free

[02:10.000 --> 02:21.000]  news of course I just saw a report last week out of Maryland where they are
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  arresting people who videotape police from even 200 yards away as they beat
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  citizens and then they're charging them with wiretapping though the law doesn't
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  even say that if you you're in a public place you don't have any perception of
[02:34.000 --> 02:41.000]  privacy whether you're police or a bluebird or a weasel or a turkey or a dog
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  walking down the street or a milkman for that matter just and the police know
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  that it's just part of this predatory system and make no mistake ladies and

[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  attacks on free speech going on all of this going on liberal coalition that's
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  an oxymoron they're liberals like that senator in Michigan wanting to ban free

[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  and he's a constitutional lawyer yes oh well he's a constitutional lawyer he
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  says there's no First Amendment well he must know he's a constitutional lawyer
[03:36.000 --> 03:44.000]  liberal coalition demands FCC moved to shut down talk radio and they are moving
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  ahead with that a new article out on that today we covered some of this yesterday
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  but new developments today of course the FCC is simultaneously agreeing with them

[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  pillars of the community in a Chicago case being attacked and so they have a
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  hidden gun and defend themselves in the mob boss daily says look I'm a

[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  plate to every form of criminal in the criminal brotherhood known as government

[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  for 11 minutes into transmission today that we have powerful tools in our hands
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  to defeat this illegitimate criminal new world order because they are illegitimate
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  they are criminal they are engaging in the overthrow of sovereign governments
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  they are replacing our constitutions in every case with draconian
[11:41.000 --> 11:48.000]  authoritarian abusive despotic systems and so if we simply expose them and
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  oppose them and speak out against them they will fall they are illegitimate
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  and i know a lot of us have new world order fatigue i do myself i mean i see
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  articles about public schools brainwashing kids have taken pliable
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  microchips ten years ago i'd yell and scream about it i'd be sensitized i
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  hardly cover it or i see new articles about two major vaccines on the market
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  filled with cancer viruses another filled with a pig virus that is known to kill
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  humans and the government saying it's healthy take your shot that's mainstream
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  news five years ago they would they would they would withdraw a vaccine now
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  they just say yeah it may kill you take it so they know that we're all becoming
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  just conditioned to accept the incredible yeah we're getting ready to take your
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  pension funds publicly that is the government is yeah a lot of companies
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  are either cutting your pension funds or outright stealing them big deal take it
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.000]  yeah there's more homeless people everywhere crawling all over the place
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  societies collapsing stores are shutting down everywhere
[12:50.000 --> 12:57.000]  us factory jobs record low last month record production loss new taxes at
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  every level actually causing the economy to stall further that's the plan
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  we're just careening headlong into tyranny i've got three articles a day about
[13:06.000 --> 13:11.000]  foreign troops and police training in the u.s. to take on u.s. citizens from
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  germany from england from canada open announcements everywhere to restrict
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.000]  our free speech it is happening it is happening see they've dispensed with
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  the denials of tyranny while they were building the infrastructure and they're
[13:27.000 --> 13:42.000]  moving ahead now
[13:42.000 --> 13:52.000]  i mean we need to pause here and have a reflective moment to think about what
[13:52.000 --> 14:10.000]  our society is turning into we have to basically deal with the magnitude of it
[14:10.000 --> 14:21.000]  and really consciously coldly face the situation and we have to really
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000]  understand that our way of life on our way of liberty and freedom is over and
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  all of the horrible fruits of degradation and enslavement and domination will
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  now be what we will enjoy and what our children will suffer under now i mean
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.000]  it's now here it's now we've gone over the cliff in history in societies once
[14:43.000 --> 14:54.000]  you reach a certain point of corruption it's like a flashpoint you can you can
[14:54.000 --> 15:03.000]  put a piece of paper on top of a glass top stove that has the metal coils
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  beneath the glass and you can lay that paper on top of it and turn it up on
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.000]  high and in about a minute you'll see it start the white paper to start to yellow
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  start to crack start to brown then it will turn black and the entire piece of
[15:18.000 --> 15:28.000]  paper will suddenly burst into flame and the paper has yellowed it has browned
[15:28.000 --> 15:35.000]  it has cracked and it is now bursting in flame and the next two years which is
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  just a twinkle of the eye in human history is that one second that it's
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  being consumed in the flame but if you could watch it in slow motion right now
[15:44.000 --> 15:52.000]  the center of the paper has now flashed white in an ignition of flame an
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.000]  explosion you know at flower factories until they put in safety precautions
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  in the last 50 years you would have explosions you know flower can explode
[16:02.000 --> 16:08.000]  like like like black powder because of all the hundreds of millions of little
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  flower particles and they're dry and when they light almost like a gas almost
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.000]  like butane or propane it can explode and it's the same thing it's like a flower
[16:19.000 --> 16:27.000]  factory going up sky high exploding like a thousand pounds of TNT have been
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  detonated that's what's going on right now and the globalists understand that
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  during this flux period during this explosion period they've got to go into
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  the levers make all their changes and use the crisis to get societies and
[16:42.000 --> 16:49.000]  governments and civilizations in a dizzying whirlwind to just accept what
[16:49.000 --> 17:00.000]  happens it is our job right now to put out the maximum effort we can whether
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  it's talking to your neighbor or having a local newsletter you put out or going
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  up to green sheets that are at the gas station or at the mall or at the restaurant
[17:10.000 --> 17:16.000]  the diner and sitting there for 20 minutes and sticking one sheet info
[17:16.000 --> 17:23.000]  flyers you have key websites and key terms and inside of it or sending you
[17:23.000 --> 17:29.000]  know out to your friends email list key info or producing your own you know
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.000]  quick YouTube videos every day or airing my films on access TV or having viewing
[17:34.000 --> 17:42.000]  parties the awakening is now and I cannot state enough that I've I have
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  all the entire spectrum of information out there is a lot of great freedom
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.000]  information truth information anti enslavement info out there but the
[17:51.000 --> 17:58.000]  best info bar none is my films whether it's the Obama deception for the
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  republic invisible empire police state for in game blueprint for global
[18:04.000 --> 18:11.000]  enslavement these are essential films there is so essential that you go to
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  dot com that you get the DVDs because they can shut the web down anytime
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  I've got news on that front today they could stage a cyber attack tomorrow or
[18:20.000 --> 18:25.000]  next year when they kick off their world war three operation and then do you
[18:25.000 --> 18:30.000]  have the films in your stockpile do you have the DVD burners do you have that
[18:30.000 --> 18:36.000]  we have to treat this like a war because it is and of all the films I think the
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  most important right now are probably invisible empire and in game because
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  it's going to give you a general overview of what we're facing and what our
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  enemies game plan is to understand the banking collapse in the current
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  takeover probably follow the republic I mean have you made copies of the
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.000]  film that you have in your custody have you gotten it out to people look
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  you're not going to save the world by yourself it's not going to be a
[18:59.000 --> 19:04.000]  perfect you know one size fits all you're not going to die on a hill and
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  defeat the new world order it's going to be an incremental movement on an

[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  in foreign entanglements and of course they have a ship called the George
[24:32.000 --> 24:37.000]  Washington doing the opposite of that Secretary of State Clinton calls for
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  Israel to investigate itself in flotilla incident that's info wars dot com
[24:43.000 --> 24:53.000]  curtain emma American 19 among Gaza flotilla dead and now the news is
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  reporting it is more than nine dead it looks like the original number is
[24:56.000 --> 25:04.000]  correct of 19 dead Jerusalem Post reports a navy prepares to confront more
[25:04.000 --> 25:12.000]  ships and now Turkey is saying they are sending ships to convoy with them so
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  that crisis is still still looming we'll cover that in the third hour today
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  the former Israeli naval captain and Mossad officer who's critical of this
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  fears of new flashpoint as defiant Israel prepares for showdown with two
[25:29.000 --> 25:37.000]  more Gaza aid ships and Gaza aid flotilla activists who were released by
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  Israel arrived to heroes welcome in Turkey including a small 18 month old
[25:42.000 --> 25:49.000]  baby different blogs have discovered misleading photos used by Israeli
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  ministry of foreign affairs to justify killing activists turns out some of
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.000]  the photos are three years old of binoculars and night vision as well as
[25:59.000 --> 26:10.000]  body armor marked Turkish police the standard government line shifting
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  years into the oil spill nuclear option on Gulf oil spill no way US says we
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.000]  first reported on Tuesday that they were discussing using a hydrogen bomb to
[26:20.000 --> 26:26.000]  seal the oil well the oil well leaking deeper down is already split up spread
[26:26.000 --> 26:32.000]  into other fissures and there's at least three plumes several miles away so
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.000]  it's just ongoing also it turns out Goldman Sachs sold 250 million of
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  British petroleum stocks before the spill their White House insiders Goldman
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  Sachs basically runs the White House that's more evidence of this being a
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  staged event so Obama can go ahead and pass his greenhouse gas taxes on the
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  back of all this anger oh sure and of course it's BP that's invested
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  billions of dollars in the fake green movement to get the carbon tax which
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  their central bank owners will profit from so what do they care if some
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.000]  subsidiary loses face they'll just change the name or shift things around and
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  the fact that you did have a record dumping of stock right before it
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  happened even the oil stocks were generally up is very suspicious firm
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  stocks sale nearly twice as large as any other institution represented 44% of
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.000]  total BP investment the brokerage firm that faced the most scrutiny from
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  regulators in the past year over for the shorting of mortgage related
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  securities seems to have had good timing when it came to something else
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.000]  the stocks of British oil giant BP they didn't dump other big oil stocks they
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.000]  own no just BP according to regulatory filings they found that Goldman
[27:41.000 --> 27:53.000]  stocks sold 4,680 million excuse me 680,822 shares well they had a lot of that
[27:53.000 --> 28:00.000]  didn't they 4,680,822 shares of BP in the first quarter of 2010 Goldman
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  sales were the largest of any firm during that time Goldman would have pocketed
[28:04.000 --> 28:09.000]  slightly more than 266 million if their holdings were sold at the average
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.000]  price of BP stock during the quarter if Goldman had sold these shares today
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.000]  their investment would have lost 36% in value or 96 million this the share to
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  sales represented 44% of Goldman's holdings meaning that Goldman remained
[28:26.000 --> 28:32.000]  remaining holdings have still lost tens of millions in value and they sold this
[28:32.000 --> 28:39.000]  shares days before how suspicious is that so continuing seeing in Obama uses
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  Gulf oil spill for energy agenda push see they're not calling it carbon tax
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  now they call it an energy agenda like Austin calls it an energy agenda oh
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  here's 2.6 billion in taxes in the next three years totaling more than all the
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  other taxes combined and it'll go to private offshore banks sit down and
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  take it if you don't like it will turn your power off if you don't like that
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  will some take your house now if you don't pay your power bill afterwards
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  and if you don't leave your house the Austin SWAT team will kill you better
[29:05.000 --> 29:16.000]  than I ever yeah all world is a bunch of cowardly people ready to get raped and
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.000]  as long as you take it they're gonna keep doing it I'm just mentioning the
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  town where I live the raping that's going on Obama uses Gulf oil spill for
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  energy agenda push it's gonna work absolutely well now and we'll cover
[29:29.000 --> 29:35.000]  that we get back and of course Goldman Sachs got out right on time right on
[29:35.000 --> 29:40.000]  time right on time just like they always do they've got every position in the
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.000]  White House of any power and they've got their new Supreme Court nominee Elena
[29:45.000 --> 29:48.000]  Kagan who says ban the Second Amendment and free speech and she's a former
[29:48.000 --> 29:53.000]  Goldman Sachs member oh yeah we're on the March the Empire's on the run

[34:13.000 --> 34:16.000]  and the Queen of England the Queen of the Netherlands and the Queen of England
[34:16.000 --> 34:23.000]  jointly own the company together they control the company on record
[34:23.000 --> 34:29.000]  and it's a top Bilderberg group company pushing the carbon taxes when you're in an airport
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  or you're looking at billboards or you're looking at a magazine like the Economist
[34:33.000 --> 34:39.000]  every four or five pages is a BP ad the last five years pushing global government carbon taxes
[34:39.000 --> 34:45.000]  and now their whole carbon tax situation is in trouble and magically an oil rig that a month
[34:45.000 --> 34:52.000]  before the disaster 36 days ago gets a award from the Obama administration for safety
[34:52.000 --> 35:02.000]  and then it blows up and it's leaking oil and BP can't put it out can't stop the leak
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.000]  and they don't put bacteria microbes that could eat the oil in at the source
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  they didn't light it on fire day one as they should have done as another recourse
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  they just can't seem to seal it and now they're saying this could go on for years
[35:15.000 --> 35:21.000]  yesterday it was till Christmas another six months now it could be years now it could be forever
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  sorry sorry

[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  sell them to governments to other banks to cities to pension funds

[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  I've got all these other emails now out from them calling everyone dumb scum and BP
[36:15.000 --> 36:22.000]  calling everyone dumb scum you're all dumb scum just like the head of Apple
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  you know telling you how great the slave factories are today and we've got the head of Facebook
[36:27.000 --> 36:37.000]  calling you dumb effing idiots stupid schmuck public trust us so much oh it's so good to rip them off
[36:37.000 --> 36:44.000]  oh it's so good and the public's like yes we love being gullible idiots we want to watch basketball

[36:55.000 --> 37:06.000]  in fact guys go to YouTube pull up end ending scene final scene of face in the crowd
[37:06.000 --> 37:13.000]  what's the name of the actor that played the sheriff from mate from Andy Griffith
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.000]  but I don't think that's his real name though I mean I mean what's the actor's name
[37:18.000 --> 37:23.000]  Andy Griffith okay so I guess he uses his own name on the show and then of course there's Barney Fife
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  but he also played an evil con artist media personality yeah Lonesome Rose
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.000]  find the final scene of Lonesome Rose we go live on TV later I'll I'm gonna play that
[37:35.000 --> 37:40.000]  and then he had everybody conned first he conned the small town then he conned everybody internationally on television
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  kind of like a Glenn Beck character and then at the end of it that the television Mike is still alive
[37:46.000 --> 37:54.000]  and he's going you dumb filthy scum you gullible idiots I'm ripping you off
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  and that destroyed him in the movie ah that doesn't destroy the government here
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  you can have thousands of times they've lied to us they can admit they make fake al-qaeda videos
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  fake bin Laden videos they can admit they put out you know fake news they can admit
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.000]  they're shipping heroin into the country and the public goes good good good rip us off
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  we don't like the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones who tells us not to trust the government
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.000]  we want to have our pension funds taken we want to be raped we want to be scammed we enjoy it
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  we love drinking sodium fluoride and hundreds of other deadly poisons we love injecting our children
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.000]  and watching them flop around and be brain damaged and have convulsions we love having cancer
[38:37.000 --> 38:45.000]  we love dying we love being scammed we love being conned there isn't a con we haven't found we don't love
[38:45.000 --> 38:54.000]  now now but but here's the good news that is a that is a smaller and smaller and smaller sub-segment of the public
[38:54.000 --> 39:04.000]  as Brazinski bemoaned two and a half weeks ago the world is waking up to their new world order
[39:04.000 --> 39:11.000]  the world is waking up to the global government
[39:11.000 --> 39:17.000]  for the first time in history the entire planet is awake to global government
[39:17.000 --> 39:23.000]  because that means the average dumbo in the street who five years ago was calling me a
[39:23.000 --> 39:28.000]  kook has to admit there's a world government go to the dredge report today one of the top stories is the
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.000]  builderberg group calling for world government you got a mainstream news articles are going okay there is a secret
[39:34.000 --> 39:41.000]  cabal they do want a world government but maybe it's good for you like the financial times of London
[39:41.000 --> 39:47.000]  dredged his credit is not saying it's good and then I saw a clip last week of Beck calling people that talk about
[39:47.000 --> 39:54.000]  the builderberg group kooks he says oh there's a world government but but people think it's builderberg or kooks
[39:54.000 --> 40:02.000]  Glenn Glenn Jim Tucker and others have dug through for 30 years the trash of the hotels they've snuck in and been
[40:02.000 --> 40:12.000]  arrested Jim Tucker has been shot at in 1999 in Portugal shot at that was in the local papers they fired
[40:12.000 --> 40:20.000]  shots at him as he climbed over the ivies he's not a spring chicken anymore he can't do that
[40:20.000 --> 40:27.000]  they are setting up world government pal they are one of the top echelons of the world government buddy boy
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  I mean why doesn't rush limbaugh admit there's a world government I don't want to sit here and bash rush
[40:32.000 --> 40:38.000]  come on rush you could save the country if you come clean about world government you too Glenn Beck you too
[40:38.000 --> 40:47.000]  Sean Hannity knock it off stop saying I'm a cook okay I'm not a cook I'm red blooded I'm trying to save this
[40:47.000 --> 41:02.000]  country okay I was ranting there here's CNN Obama uses Gulf oil spill for energy agenda push and he's
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.000]  saying oh this shows we need more federal regulation we need new money to clean this up he wants a
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.000]  overall tax on all of your gasoline and carbon taxes on all factories but don't worry they're already
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.000]  pretty much shut down but you know or federalized that's mission accomplished and they're not going to GM
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.000]  is not going to make mercury anymore you're not gonna be able to buy you a mercury and drive it up and down
[41:23.000 --> 41:30.000]  the road like Alan Jackson talks about no sir you're not gonna buy you a mercury and drive it up and down
[41:30.000 --> 41:39.000]  the road I'm gonna buy the mercury and drive it up and down the road no no you're not you're not
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  gonna make deadly squat you're gonna learn to worship government they're gonna bankrupt you and make you
[41:43.000 --> 41:51.000]  dependent they're gonna make you learn to lick the boots of the machine gun toting proto Neo hippies
[41:51.000 --> 42:02.000]  you're gonna learn to love Trotsky you understand BP tries again to cap well protests set to start
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  this is the dialectic people are egging their buildings they're attacking BP stations they're knocking
[42:07.000 --> 42:13.000]  windows they're protesting and BP says don't do it it'll hurt the local BP franchise owners don't do it
[42:13.000 --> 42:21.000]  don't do it don't do it don't do it look it's about a 95% chance now BP stage this and it's in fact get me
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.000]  Watson online right now I was working on another Bilderberg breaking news report from our inside sources
[42:27.000 --> 42:34.000]  that have sources within Bilderberg but just dial up Watson right now via regular phone I want to get him
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.000]  right now we we can conclusively say now if I come into a YouTube after the show today we can clearly
[42:40.000 --> 42:47.000]  say now that all the evidence is clear it's all now pointing directly at this being a staged event
[42:47.000 --> 42:55.000]  it's taking me 3637 days be able to say that but all the evidence is pointing at it and we'll explain why
[42:55.000 --> 43:05.000]  I mean the biggest thing is just like FEMA blocked off aid and wouldn't let the Coast Guard in and wouldn't
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  let Walmart in and wouldn't let all the police and National Guard at first and then wouldn't let them give
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  aid to people wouldn't let people walk out on the highways wouldn't let them told them go to the Superdom
[43:13.000 --> 43:20.000]  and starve it was to say oh look we screwed up we are bad we need more funds more power and see
[43:20.000 --> 43:26.000]  I'm saying with this now all we screwed up we need more funds more power and notice it's the inside company
[43:26.000 --> 43:33.000]  BP the key globalist oil company that has been chaperoning and hurting all the other oil companies
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.000]  you know Exxon Mobil wouldn't do it until David Rockefeller went to the board meeting and pointed out
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  this is in the news that he owns still all the major stock of the major 12 US oil companies and he said
[43:43.000 --> 43:48.000]  I will remove you Rex Tillerson you will come out and call for global government and two days later
[43:48.000 --> 43:53.000]  Rex Tillerson was in the news saying I want a global carbon tax I want well-headed taxes I want it all
[43:53.000 --> 44:01.000]  and that was the end of it remember that well notice it's BP and notice now Goldman Sachs the insiders
[44:01.000 --> 44:08.000]  dumped more than half their stock right before it happened bring me Watson Watson are you there
[44:08.000 --> 44:14.000]  I know you're working on a big Bilderberg report right now in Brzezinski and that's important
[44:14.000 --> 44:23.000]  but I am ready to say that it's a 90 plus percent I just let's just say 90% chance that this is an inside job
[44:23.000 --> 44:31.000]  that needs to be investigated you got the raw story getting the four year documents with their regulatory filings
[44:31.000 --> 44:40.000]  that Goldman Sachs dumped more than half their stock 4,680,822 shares in the days before the all-time record
[44:40.000 --> 44:47.000]  on a dump directly against BP I notice it wasn't against other oil companies same thing with Buzzy Crongaard
[44:47.000 --> 44:57.000]  and Deutsche Brown dumping record amounts and put options on America and United in the four days before 9-11
[44:57.000 --> 45:03.000]  you have BP being the inter-globalist Dutch roll shell Queen Beatrix Queen Elizabeth company
[45:03.000 --> 45:08.000]  you have them being the main funder of global carbon taxes in the private corporate media
[45:08.000 --> 45:15.000]  sponsoring TV shows you name it you have the fact that they will not cap it that they got the award a month before
[45:15.000 --> 45:21.000]  that Obama is now calling for his carbon taxes and wellhead taxes and pump taxes so oil company taxes
[45:21.000 --> 45:28.000]  citizen taxes at the pump and carbon taxes when their whole agenda is stalled to set up the world government and fund it
[45:28.000 --> 45:37.000]  we know they're dialectic of FEMA staging its own event and not allowing aid to get in to then claim that they needed more funding and power
[45:37.000 --> 45:47.000]  and all that day one I can now conclusively say Watson hands down this has got to be a staged event all the evidence is pointing towards that
[45:47.000 --> 45:54.000]  what say you Watson I want to bounce this off you hearing a mini think tank get your quick take on it
[45:54.000 --> 46:08.000]  I can't say for sure Ali but it seems like BP and the government is more concerned about managing the public relations aspect of what's going on
[46:08.000 --> 46:19.000]  rather than stopping the actual leak well we know governments we know governments and corporations nexus together even the Washington Post admits today
[46:19.000 --> 46:29.000]  that OK VP is basically the big umbrella controller of the fake eugenics climate control movement and we need an article or I can get
[46:29.000 --> 46:37.000]  current your brothers and you're working on this other one but I'm so so call one of them I got Aaron tied down on Kim Troll research right now
[46:37.000 --> 46:44.000]  that this needs to be investigated and the fact that everything's so clamped down and they won't let media out there and he's got SWAT teams guarding it
[46:44.000 --> 46:54.000]  I'm telling you my gut tells me this is a staged event Watson well it's interesting that they tried to get James Cameron to work with BP to
[46:54.000 --> 47:04.000]  manage it the Hollywood film director and yeah he said all the top environmental groups are tied in tied at the head with the oil companies
[47:04.000 --> 47:14.000]  because they both benefit from the fraudulent global warming agenda the environmental groups get the power out of it and the oil corporations get to create
[47:14.000 --> 47:24.000]  artificial scarcity and need taxes which they pass on to us so well Watson correct me if I'm wrong though I mean at first some groups did approach Cameron
[47:24.000 --> 47:36.000]  because he of course has covered the Titanic as an expert you know at least in deploying robotic systems but so are the oil companies they probably know
[47:36.000 --> 47:46.000]  more than he does but he's saying he was rebuffed by BP go ahead yeah he was involved in a brainstorming session with basically the government and
[47:46.000 --> 47:56.000]  scientists on Tuesday and then it came out of the meeting and basically said they're stupid they don't know what they're doing so I mean you were making
[47:56.000 --> 48:06.000]  the point that there are now these microbes that eat up oil and that's not being explored possibly and merely the fact that oil itself is
[48:06.000 --> 48:16.000]  naturally occurring and that the environmental damage may be being hiked by the media obviously the worst thing about it is the government
[48:16.000 --> 48:26.000]  shut down miles and miles of fishing regions in that area and businesses are dying as a result of it
[48:26.000 --> 48:38.000]  well said Watson and it just gets more and more suspicious and of course there are natural microbes new scientists reports that would in just a year or so
[48:38.000 --> 48:50.000]  eat almost all of this oil they just kept it out of the marshes that's the most important thing but they're not doing that they're not burning it off as they've
[48:50.000 --> 48:59.000]  always done in the past because that would create carbon dioxide so either way you slice it this is a serious serious situation and now Obama says
[48:59.000 --> 49:07.000]  hey get ready for this to go on till Christmas maybe years this is just the way it is and you better believe they're going to really try to get their
[49:07.000 --> 49:16.000]  carbon taxes out of this they now admit they're doing it and carbon taxes will do nothing to mitigate oil spills and of course it is hurting the
[49:16.000 --> 49:24.000]  fishermen but that's how the fishermen get gasoline to be able to go out there and engage in their fishing and so at every stage the government is
[49:24.000 --> 49:34.000]  making this as bad as they can making this as you know as as as horrible as they can make it to exacerbate it Watson thanks for joining us
[49:34.000 --> 49:47.000]  all right there goes Paul Watson popping in with us okay I said I go to calls and we've got people holding but I've got four stacks of news and

[54:59.000 --> 55:14.000]  all right Eric I appreciate your call that's very funny let's talk to Ralph in Illinois Ralph you're on the air Alex yes friend brother what a pleasure to talk to you
[55:14.000 --> 55:30.000]  and I just got to tell you I'm a retired iron worker from local one year in Chicago I understand exactly what these what cover-ups you know from the media can do
[55:30.000 --> 55:51.000]  I mean I've known a lot of brother iron workers that when I would tell him you know about those buildings were imploded you know you're crazy you're high and all this but what I really wanted to do is maybe plan a seed
[55:51.000 --> 56:15.000]  are you familiar with the Shepard's Chapel or Pastor Murray no no now he teaches the Bible chapter by chapter verse by verse and donated for about 50 years and just the inside I've got from him from a couple years several years
[56:15.000 --> 56:29.000]  that I've been listening to his teaching but have you ever heard the term tonight I think that was a tribe in the Bible I remember reading something about that in the Old Testament
[56:29.000 --> 56:50.000]  well ten nights were the children of the cane you know cane enable cane being the the first and then oh I understand that saying evil evil bloodlines yeah no I'm I'm familiar with that and you know what Jesus said he came for everybody
[56:50.000 --> 57:00.000]  and I believe everybody can I mean I don't believe black people are going to go to hell because they're black or I don't believe white people are white devils because they're white and I but but I appreciate your call
[57:00.000 --> 57:12.000]  but there are I mean I guess historic things where you know with Abraham God said this group will be blessed and that group won't be blessed but you know what I mean you know like the black Muslims
[57:12.000 --> 57:27.000]  they think the whites of the devils you got a lot of the Rastafarians who think whites of the devils and that you know the king of Ethiopia was basically the Messiah and of course you notice he died
[57:27.000 --> 57:36.000]  and and I mean it seems like every group thinks they're the chosen group and everybody else is the devil and I just you know I really don't subscribe to that
[57:36.000 --> 57:48.000]  but I appreciate your call okay let's talk to Mike in Arizona Mike are on the air yes good morning Alex this is Michael Nesser calling from Arizona I'd like to talk about this
[57:48.000 --> 58:08.000]  Gaza issue yes you know what we do is we need to strike at the root of this you know sometimes when we get into the debate about the raid of if they should have done it or if it was international or water or anything like that what we have to do is again strike at the root we have to realize that all of the land belongs to the Arabs
[58:08.000 --> 58:22.000]  leading up to World War One there was an exchange of letters between Sir Henry McMahon and Sharif Hussein that the British Prime Minister later said that it was a treaty and they promised all of the land and the independence to the Arabs
[58:22.000 --> 58:36.000]  and then the next issue with the strike at the root part is about the Khazars and the Ashkenazi they converted they admitted to Judaism between the 8th and the 10th century there was an article in Heret not that long ago

[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  well the incumbent lost in Alabama yesterday incumbent lost in Hawaii the incumbent lost in Utah the incumbent our establishment candidate lost in Kentucky it's every single race
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  no incumbent whether it's Ireland specter it doesn't matter no one who was an incumbent or seen as the establishment candidate is winning and Rand Paul has extended his lead over Conway despite racism smear this is a key article that is up on info wars dot com
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  that we need to get out there to everybody the media the media demonize Rand Paul the last two weeks and what happened multiple polls showed that he is lead only got bigger
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  his lead only got bigger in one poll by six points another poll by four points his poll only got bigger
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  now what does that tell you it tells you the establishment is crashing and burning and that's why they're going to stage a new war an economic collapse heaven knows because they understand this is not one party out of favor where all the Democrats get thrown out
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  that baiting and switching is over and this will be the last cycle they'll put a bunch of Republicans in because they're mainly the anti-incumbency there most of them are going to get bought off and then people are going to go completely ape
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  and it's going to be just independence and the states are all rebelling and revolting and taking back their power the globalist are in trouble ladies and gentlemen the globalist are in big trouble
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  okay I just got two phone calls from people bringing up dealing with the flotilla racial identity of the Jews I think that's where that was going and I've opened the phones up for whatever
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  and I don't know if it's buddies that are calling in or or or just just just you know random chance sometimes I'll have like five mics in a row call in or five people six people call in from New Jersey in a row
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  but I mean I don't see what any of this has to do with the issue of is this attack on the flotilla right or wrong and I think it was a debacle and wrong
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  you know I just don't get into the black roster firing and saying white people are the devil or La Raza and Metsha saying Hispanics are angels and whites are the devil
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  or saying blacks and Jews are the devil I just every group loves to walk around thinking they're God and you know what I'm just a freedom lover who wants freedom for everybody
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  I would go ahead and tell me about Khazars from northern Georgia and converting and I mean I I do know about that and and Kessler's the 13th tribe I mean I knew about that 20 years ago
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  and but I mean specifically what does that have to do with the flotilla I understand that only what 20% of the Jews in Israel are are really Sephardic from North Africa or from Spain who who really are originally from there
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  and so my issue is are you saying that that that that that people from North Africa or or wherever are you saying they have no right to any land there
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  well that's the beginning of it should all white people leave North America like Metsha says because we came and took this land
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  well I'm not going to divert the conversation we're not talking about Metsha and we're not talking about this and that we're talking about the deal on who owns the land
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  and how they say for instance if I used to be a Baptist and I converted to Catholicism does that give me the right to move to the Vatican because I'm a Catholic and say that I'm living there
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  how is it that these people come out here and say that their God's chosen people and God gave them the land when they are not descendants of the Israelites they converted to Judaism between the 8th and the 10th century
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  and it gives them absolutely no right to own the land back to point number one the treaty that was signed between the British government Sir Henry McMahon and Sharif Hussein who was the representative
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  no listen I'm familiar with that and then the Israelis blew up the British installations to run them out I mean that's the Ergon
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  you know the daddy and granddaddy of the White House chief of staff I understand all that my issue is they got 400 nukes they're not going anywhere and I want to stop my property taxes going up
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  but all we can talk about is Jews all day

[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  all right welcome back ladies and gentlemen we're going to continue with your phone calls blondie quarry frank sonny and others we've got reporters popping in later in the hour from bill deberg in spain
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  ready to get some intel on what's going on there but more and more bill deberg group is past say other than their vetting of politicians and yeah it's a it's a meeting of 150 years so globalist but now their agenda for world government is no longer hidden it's out on the
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  open the things they say at bill deberg are now what they say at davos are now the things that they say on c span they are out in the open because his presence he said and i saw them change two years ago i said they now know their public they now know we've exposed
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  them they they understand that lying about world government denying world government has basically backfired on them because everybody's got their own documents and those there is a world government forming and so now they've shifted gears to go
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  okay we're setting up a world government but it's a good thing but listen my issue on taxes the power to tax is the power to destroy and literally hundreds of new taxes are being passed by county cities and states and the federal government
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  we saw an article a few months ago where 80 plus taxes have been passed and a bunch of others pending in the state of new york alone but the power to taxes the power to destroy and so whoever runs the new world order
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  whatever power structure it is whoever captains it and we study that we cover that it's the old nobility of Europe it's all these inbred families regardless we need to block them their illegitimate world government takeover they want to
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  bankrupt us in their own statements they want to bankrupt us they want to take control of our society and they're openly gearing up to shut down our free speech it's already started in france it's already started in italy is already starting in Australia
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  they're pushing it now in England and the United States and Canada this is going on this is tyranny we know what this is and I'm here to not have a click radio show not a click of cult of personality on the show
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  not a click of the catholics are evil and run it all or the jews are evil and run it all and you're welcome to call in and talk about whatever you want I have my view that I'm not going to get into all these niches and clubs and no it's the reptoids they run it all and Alex you're a
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  reptoid you know I stick to the facts and one I can prove and that's why we are the most listened to alternative radio show in the world the most viewed alternative websites info wars dot com and prison planet dot com that's why my films are the most
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  severely viewed online is because we stick to the facts ladies and gentlemen we lay it out we lay out the globalist agenda and try to get the people to block it without getting into balkanization and division which is how the new world order controls us we
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  look 99.9% of the world population whether you're chinese whether you're germanic whether you're jewish whether you're latin american hispanic whether you're african 99.99% of us are getting the short into the stick are being enslaved are losing our freedoms the new world order is not good for us
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  and I am here opposing it who can be against that and I know the Cointel pro has always come at us through these different niche organizations how many white supremacist leaders have I told you were feds always with the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center manipulating
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  them controlling them FBI trying to maintain control over the patriot movement trying to paint it as racist so that it isn't palatable to the general public so people go with the establishment what do they say you're against health care you're a racist you
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  like Rand Paul and smaller government you're a racist they they need that that's why the Southern Poverty Law Center got caught running the Elohim city white supremacist compound with McVeigh and Andreas Strasmeyer the german intelligence officer that's why the major
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  newspapers in germany report that the modern nazi movement is run by the government and founded by them so they can point to them as an excuse to take other people's free speech I understand the full paradigm I know the game plan I understand
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  it and I stand against it 110% against the new world order and that's why we're effective and that's why we're loved more than anybody and we're hated more than anybody and God has promised that no weapon formed against us so prosper as long as we
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  have faith and do the right thing and are honorable and so all the attacks all the lies all the disinfo only energizes the work we do here on this broadcast it only promotes us all the lies all the disinfo all the deception all the
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  twisting all the prevarication all of it only sends people to this radio show and to my websites and my films and the work we've done in my book and the books I've published because people say I want to check into this Alex Jones in this sea of
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  media and alternative ideas and mainstream ideas we stand out and we stand out more and more and I want to commend all of you that have spread the word about this broadcast I want to commend all of you out there that are continuing to spread the word about the internet feeds
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  the streams the local AM and FM's were on the global shortwave the satellite thank God you're out there we're having a huge effect I want to continue with your calls I want to get some good news first for I go to Blondie Corey Frank sunny and others anti
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  incumbency takes down another congressman Montgomery Alabama the political shooting star otherwise known as anti incumbency fell on Alabama taking down a first term congressman who switched from Democrat to Republican just last year the hotly contested
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  healthcare overhaul was among the issues working against representative Parker Griffith voted out by Republicans Tuesday in the fifth congressional district in favor of Madison County Commissioner Mo Brooks the tea party support and the backing of local GOP leaders still better about losing to
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  governor in 2008 Brooks one Tuesday's primary was slightly more than 50% of the vote in a three candidate field and the establishment always runs an extra to sabotage it.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  Here came on a day when representative Arthur Davis lost his bid to become Alabama's first black governor in the state's Democratic primary and new Mexico's gubernatorial primary set up a general election to debate who becomes the first female governor.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  Griffith's loss was the latest manifestation of an anti establishment anti Washington anti incumbency fervor a 2010 political phenomenon that has shaken the Democratic establishment and the Obama White House and has also caused angst in GOP leadership circles.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  That's right they're scared they had Dick Cheney campaign and speak out against Rand Paul. They had all the big neocons speak out against him all the Israeli lobby people speak out against him because he wants to cut off aid to Israel and everybody else by the way.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  They cut it all off we're bankrupt it's over no more welfare free legal aliens no more aid to Egypt no more aid to South Korea no more aid to Israel no more aid to Germany no more it's over we're done paying we're bankrupt which the bankers wanted to do it's done.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  So you got the neocons all piling and you got the Democrats piling and you got him basically claiming he's the second coming of that off Hitler. He never talked about the civil rights act never made it a campaign issue never called for its repeal was asked about it.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  The globalist knew he would give a standard libertarian answer well I think it's good but gone too far dealing with you know.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  Private clubs but again that doesn't matter. Guess what happened happen to have the polls right here in my hot little hand.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  Rand Paul survived smear campaign to maintain healthy lead over Conway.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  That was an article that Watson wrote three days ago at prisonplanet.com and he gives all the different poll numbers showing him keeping his lead or gaining two points or losing one point one poll.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  Now overall again a new poll Paul Rand Paul extends lead over Conway despite racist smear and it goes through several polls prisonplanet.com.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  Latest figures show anti-establishment candidate has recovered from coordinated media attack making those who declared controversy to be in the polls political career look foolish.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  Yeah.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  All the major respected polls like Angus and Reed Mason Dixon.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  And several others Gallup let me read here what's one of the other ones Rasmussen show that he gained between four and six points from from from 20 points to 26 that's nice if you can get it.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  And then the fake daily cost poll shows that he's gained as well.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  Of course you know they claim that he dropped from 20 points to six points well now he's grown from six in their fake poll you know his six point lead has grown even in their fake poll.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  So what does that tell you it's the same thing I told Politico the day after he won the day before the launch of the attack campaign began.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  I said you know in the article I told the reporter I said I know the media is going to attack Rand Paul now and I said let me give you some advice sarcastically.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  I said come out and endorse him oh oh if the mainstream media endorsed Rand Paul he would lose support.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  Literally but I said you can't do that because your ego maniacs you believe you've got bullets in your gun you're out of bullets and I told the reporter I said and it's on record I said you're a tax on him that are coming are only going to bolster him.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  What happened.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  It bolstered him it made him go up in the polls that's I mean this MSNBC piece coming out against me and Rand Paul for the what is it the.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  Is it the 14th that they're airing matters the 16th I forget I look it up for me that the rise of the right they're going to air it reportedly more than 20 times it's a special report that they'll air over and over again.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  The last one was the death of Ted Kennedy that Matthews he does like one a year usually.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  And it's a big headpiece.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  And in the TV ads they try to make me look like a cook try to make Rand Paul look like a cook try to make soccer moms look like cooks hey folks you're the cooks okay.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  The 16th thank you you of this month so 13 days from now you are the cooks.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Look when you get up there and say if someone doesn't want government run health care that they're racist you lost all credibility okay.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  So that's why I let Nightline come down here and interview me.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  That's why I let CNN interview me that's why I let them interview me.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  Because you don't have any credibility Jack.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  You understand people know that you're not just liberals know you're fake liberals working for General Electric that makes cluster bombs.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  You're a sick disgusting filthy war covered fraud.

[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  Originally we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the Fiat continental system.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  Wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business creating the largest Fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  Hi this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  Again that's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  The problem.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  When your power goes out the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio and producing clean water is the family emergency kit from Kero Stove.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  Kero Stove has been in business for over 12 years with the largest selection of kerosene stoves and family preparedness supplies in the U.S.

[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  Call 888-395-1164 today.

[01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  Again call 888-395-1164 or go to kero stove dot com for family emergency solutions.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  So how exciting is this that in Utah, in Kentucky, in Colorado, in Hawaii, in Alabama, in Pennsylvania, in New York, everywhere,
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  Democrat establishment people like Spector are being thrown out, establishment Republicans are being thrown out and the AP,
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  here we are a year and a half later finally admits this is scaring the Republican Party as well.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  And again I called it because I understand how they try to keep us in that left-right paradigm.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  A year and a half ago, remember how I noticed that at tea parties the Republicans are trying to take them over,
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  they'd have Senator Cornyn, they'd have Rick Perry come up to the dais at the rallies and they would be booed off stage.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  Suddenly Perry went, I'm for succession, he started literally acting like Yosemite Sam in photo shoots and video interviews going,
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  Y'all kill all your rascally rabbit whop.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  I shot a Cody in Austin when I was out in the woods.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  He actually said that, sort of talking like Yosemite Sam and some Texans went,
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  he won't succeed, he won't like a new world order, meanwhile he's going to Bilderberg group meetings, I like Perry.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  And Yosemite Sam actually lifting himself off the ground like jet packs with his 45s, elevating.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  Oh yeah, are you?
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  So he's the only one that survived because he knew how to a year ago, almost a year and a half ago,
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  when he got booed, he went from having that establishment accent and sounding like an establishment person who just like,
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  I'll get rid of them toll roads, I'll get rid of them Bilderberg, I tell you I'm not angry.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  Everybody else is going down in flames.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  Everyone, everyone else, every incumbent at a national level for the Congress, for the House or Senate is terminated, is gone.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  What does that tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the system is in deep trouble?
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  And day one, so everybody can learn their tricks.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  I learned this, most of you understand it, but for laymen out there that are just tuning in, Republicans were being booed everywhere.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  And the media MSNBC came out and said it is racist, the Tea Parties are racist, and it's Republican run by Republican Party lobbyist.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  Totally false, but that became a self-fulfilling prophecy, they knew what was going to happen.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  They rushed in, the Republicans created all their fake Tea Party groups, tried to take control of it, but they haven't been totally successful.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  I'd say 35, 40% successful.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  They were successful in fooling liberals to think, oh, I can't be part of the Tea Party, it's a right-wing thing.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  It's a anti-Black thing, and then everybody's paranoid of each other.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  So they've been somewhat successful keeping us divided, but overall incumbents are out.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  Democrats in Democrat districts are voting incumbent Democrats out, establishment Democrats out.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  In Republican districts, they're voting establishment Republicans out in every single case.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  Unless you talk bad about the New World Order and act like you're your Yosemite Sam, you are out of power.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  And by the way, when Perry continues all his treason, he's going to get in trouble.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  So this is very, very, very exciting, and overall the media, Republican and Democrat-controlled media, Fox News, MSNBC, all of them,
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  they're trying to keep it still on the Republican Democrat Reservation.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  They're trying to keep your choices within that paradigm.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  And they've done everything they can to go, oh, the Tea Party is a conservative thing.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  The Tea Party is an anti-Democrat thing.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  Oh, the Tea Party, it's going to really get those Democrats.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  It's going to get those Republicans too.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  What have I been saying for a year and a half since Obama got into office?
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  And now we see it clear as day and the entire system is panicking in a big, big way today.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  This is so exciting.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  Blondie in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  Hi, Alex.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  I'm glad you've been reiterating that a robber must be confronted with necessary and if, well, if necessary deadly force that they break into your home.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  Now, a reference to your video yesterday on infowars.com, the two-minute one that highlighted the weapons that were held by members of the Bokeh crew.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  Does this mean that if Israeli commandos storm a flag vessel in international waters, the crew can't use stun grenades, sticks, or kitchen knives to defend themselves?
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  Because you never brought this up with Cory Gold and it makes it sound like you're flip-flopping on self-defense.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  Now, I'm not flip-flopping on self-defense.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  I'm just bringing in different perspectives trying to be balanced because there have been claims that no one even fought back.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  And I've stated that I believe it's illegal to attack the ship in international waters.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  But the thing is, I'm not, I'm not hoping Turkey goes and gets in a war with Israel when this next group of ships comes in.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  I hope Israel lets the ships dock and I hope that there isn't conflict.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  Okay, you also stated that the portella may have been a staged advantage for Israeli response.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  Do you still agree with that?
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  Well, stay there.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  This is a great way to be able to monitor the value of your home.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  And again, it's absolutely free.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  There are tons of tools to help you.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  For instance, if you want to remodel your home, go to homegain.com.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  Use their home sale maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  For 10 years, these folks have been helping home sellers and buyers.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  Visit their link at infowars.com.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  Look for Max, the orange home game gorilla, to help you with any real estate needs you might have.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  You'll love this site.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000]  It's homegain.com.

[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  Food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:54.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.000]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:47.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:20.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Mark Anderson, Deputy Editor of American Free Press, the National Weekly Newspaper,
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  is our guest joining us from Spain, from the town where they're having Milnerburg 2010,
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  and we're also getting a Jim Tucker lined up on the line as well right now.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  Now, it officially kicked off today, but they shut the hotel down yesterday.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  We had London Guardian reporter Ron Charlie Skelton, who was actually arrested last year in Greece.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  So to give us what's happening on the ground and any intel that Mark and Jim Tucker have gotten on what's on the agenda,
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  is Mark Anderson of AmericanFreePress.net.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  Mark, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  My pleasure. We've been inundated with local media and state media requests that's been a very interesting day.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  Yeah, I mean, we've gone from 33 years ago or so when the media would say that Jim was a kook and Milnerburg didn't exist.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  You know, the real trailblazer on this.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  To now, the Drudge Report in the Times of London, Secret of Milnerburg Club, ready for protest,
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  and they admit they're pushing for world government there in Sigis, Spain.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  Yeah, that's part and parcel of what's going on here.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  Lots of national and regional media interest, conventional corporate media as well.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  The secrecy is being stripped away, but their drive and their ambitions are a hard thing to satisfy.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  Well, I saw you interviewed by Russia today on the ground with some of the protesters there.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  I saw the police shoving protesters.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  I even saw some of the protesters shoving the police back and the police didn't attack them.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  So it looked like the police aren't wanting a confrontation.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  Normally, police would go haywire if somebody shoved them back because they're used to people submitting to their godlike authority to assault them,
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  but not to be assaulted back.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  Breakdown, the type of security you're seeing and expanding on that, any intel you're getting from inside the hotel.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  The security after I was at Hotel Dolce on June 1st began to show up as the local police on June 2nd,
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  and it intensified with these paddy wagons.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  They have mobile detention bans that the police can ride in themselves,
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  but if they had to detain someone, they can do it on the spot.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  Oh, and I've been told by reliable sources that the plainclothes to private security are beginning to filter in,
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  but what I've seen and what you saw on the Russia program was local police clearing one of those roundabouts,
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  those round turnaround areas common in Europe, and they had to clear the grass area in the middle of that.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  So protesters and activists and journalists could not clearly see or as clearly see or photograph any dark tinted window cars going in.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  It was just to kind of limit visibility and marginalize everyone.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  The pushing and shoving was a lot of local activists that just said, keep your hands off me, keep your hands off me,
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  but so far the police have showed a lot of restraint.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  In terms of what's going on information-wise, I know the broad brushstrokes that they have been looking at making the IMF into a real treasury and things like that,
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  but the minutiae, the detail we're still working on, and Jim can probably address that a little more.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  Yeah, and I know Jim is trying to make his way up to his hotel room being mobbed by media.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  This is the complete opposite of what was happening ten years ago with almost no mainstream media coverage.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  We know this has got to be upsetting these world government schemers that they can't have their little mafia commission meetings in secret anymore.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  Oh, I think it is. And the more this is done, the more they're going to get the pie in the face, so to speak, for people knowing their meeting,
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  and yet no forthcoming press releases, no openness or transparency, no lists or anything of names.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  They're dishonor role, I call it. And at some point, something's got to give.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  With the Greek economy having taken a dive since last year's Bilderberg meeting in Greece, I think the Spanish see the writing on the wall.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  And there's a lot of Spanish people, bartenders, shopkeepers have told me that they see their economy going the same way.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  And as night follows day, the Bilderberg machinations, the fingerprints are all over this thing.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  Mark, now I know you and Jim have been running around throughout the city trying to reach contacts.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  Jim got there a day late because of his plane being delayed. Normally he goes into the hotel before he gets shut down.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  I've been there with him before. This has been done in Canada and, of course, in Virginia.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  But tell us about some of the sleuth work you've been doing.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  Without going into too much detail, to tip my hand too much, just generally trying to learn the ropes,
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  I'm a newcomer to Bilderberg not in writing and reading about it, but in actually attending one.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  I guess you could call me Jim's apprentice in a way.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  This is a very complicated affair when you're dealing with so many important people lodged into one spot
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  and you're trying to get information that you can consider reliable, not just information or rumors.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  A big thing has been to wake the town and tell the people kind of the zee of Zorro on the wall.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  A lot of flyers have been circulating, written in Spanish, telling the average Spanish person what's going on in their town.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  And I produced some of those and they went pretty viral at a lot of the protests at a train station
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  and at different spots around Fitches, which is sort of an outreach of Barcelona, Spain, here along the Mediterranean.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  And the sleuth work has included, this year I was the one to go into the hotel early before they closed it down.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  And what was curious was there were already virtually no people there.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  I tried their wine and looked out over the beautiful view, but there was really hardly anyone there already
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  and they had that place vacuumed as clean as clean can get.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  And without going into too much detail, there just wasn't any sign yet of information or people for the actual Bilderberg meeting.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  But there was a very distinct lack of customers.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  And of course I inquired, can I get a hotel room here in a couple of nights?
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  And they said, no, there's a big convention. You cannot be here.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  They were just playing with them a little bit and there's a lot of ironies and intrigue going on.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  But the media coverage from all levels and both independent and regular media is really quite intense.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  A lot of TV crews have been there all day, yesterday and all day, or part of the day, the day before.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  Well, that's exciting. What's the flavor of the reporting that's going on that you're seeing on television in the press?
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  Or are you unable to read it because you don't just speak Spanish? I mean, I know I don't.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  Well, you know, it's not so much the language barrier, though that plays a role.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  It's that I'm so busy doing this, what I do, that I don't have time to see the results of what they do,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  let alone write up what I've gathered. I managed to file a story, I think, last night.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  I haven't even had a chance to see if it got posted yet online.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  No, it did. It's mainly about the security.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  Oh, yeah, perhaps so.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  And so it's tricky. It's hard to even...
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  Sometimes the reporters that you talk to don't provide all the information on what stations they broadcast on,
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  how to dial it in.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  But the point is there's a lot of media there, so that's exciting.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  It's been almost constant, and it's a great mixture of the independent bloggers right on up to your national and regional TV stations.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  I heard one lady reporter with a national Spanish station arguing with her editor or her boss saying,
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  we do too much trivia, too much bubble gum, we need to do more with this, which is, you know, a good thing to hear.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  Well, I was talking to Charlie Skelton yesterday from The Guardian.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  He said he was talking to BBC TV. They were getting ready to run with it.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  And then later the editor said, look, this has been killed, or the producer he was talking to said, this story's now been killed.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  So we do see Bilderberg there trying to suppress the news, trying to keep real news from hitting the media,
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  but they're having less and less control.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  Let me ask you this, Mr. Anderson from American Free Press, deputy editor.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  Did you see the Zbigniew Brzezinski speech of two weeks ago that we wrote about that was later picked up and used in the speech
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  before the EU Parliament a few days ago, quotes from our article dealing with the fact that Brzezinski basically said,
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  for the first time in history, the whole world is awake to our world government, and things are getting tougher for us.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  I saw a clip of that that somebody sent me like an excerpt, and the only thing I would caution, and I think that's true,
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  what he said is what Taylor Caldwell, the late author, said.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  She warned that we shouldn't too easily believe that these power elite have large squabbles among themselves.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  They might have minor points of disagreement, but they do tend to think pretty much birds of a feather flock together, you know.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  And so some of that could be for public consumption, you know, like the Sun Zoo, the Art of War,
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  when you are strong up here weak, when you are weak up here strong.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  We have to be very careful, and I've cautioned Jim, and Jim agrees that what Brzezinski said is probably true,
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  but we don't want them to play pasta on us.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  We don't want them to put out urban legends that will believe too easily.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  I agree with you, but I'm not a spring chicken in all of this research myself.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  Of course not.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  And what he said is true, just from my own research, the awakening Israel, I see it on the streets,
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  and sure, we don't want to take from this, oh, we've beat them.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  No, we are now just finally finding our feet, and have gotten a few good blows in, so we're in the fight.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  But I think the victory at Trenton by George Washington against the Hessians in the middle of the Revolutionary War,
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  I don't think that was them going, God, we won the war.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  I think it was my God, we're starting to win a few battles here, and the fact that world government is being set up
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  is now mainstream news, and they've tried to keep it secret.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  So I think what Brzezinski is, he's in the corner telling his boxers, hey, you better get in there and take this guy serious.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  We can take him, but you better wake up, here's some smelling salts.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  Yeah, that's a pretty good analogy, Alex, and I think the part that's true is the public awakening,
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  and that has got to trouble the octogenarian tyrants like David Rockefeller and his apprentices or associates
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  like the big New Brzezinski, trilateral boys.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  And it's got to be troubling to them, because I think the patriarch Rockefeller wants to see certain things happen
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  before he goes to the Great Bilderberg meeting in the sky, you know, and excuse me, I'm a little giggly, I haven't slept hardly.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  And so, you know, at some point they're going to get impatient, and hopefully there won't be any strange events or big wars,
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  or, you know, they always resort to war in the final analysis.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  Well, I agree with you, and that's the key intel.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  I can't wait till Jim's able to talk to some sources, but you can also see the Bilderberg mouthpieces more and more out in the open
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  trying to deal with the 24-hour news cycle.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  There are a lot more public, you know, Bilderberg group members in basically pushing the agenda,
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  and undoubtedly within days of the meeting ending, we'll see their spin on what their real agenda is.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  But certainly they're gearing up to go into Iran.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  That's back on the front burner.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  They're using this whole Mediterranean thing with Israel as a new way to kick stuff off.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  The whole North Korean Peninsula, the George Washington, you know, mega aircraft carrier going off the coast of North Korea.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  I mean, war is their only card right now, or giant false flag terror attack.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  That's the downside to the wonderful awakening, is that they always in the end resort to what you just said,
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  the only card that they can play without much interference, and that's the war card.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  And that's, you know, I don't even have to go into why that's bad or how unfortunate that is.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  But yeah, you have a rotating Prime Minister in Japan.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  They can't seem to decide on one.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  They have, of course, the BP spewing of the oil and the Gulf.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  They've got things that, whether they cause these things to happen, they've got things they can exploit.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  And so they've got a lot of variables, maybe, but in the end, you're right.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  War with Iran, as Jim Tucker has reported, has been a major Bilderberg goal.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  Perhaps on behalf of Israel, maybe there's an element there.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  And then the IMF is World Treasury, perhaps the World Health Organization as a World Health Department,
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  maybe using some swine flu-like excuse or something.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  But at the same time, you know, maybe war gets a little messy for them on occasion.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  Maybe they can only fight on so many fronts because they'll wake up the peasants even more.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  But yeah, the media coverage has been the most heartening thing to see here.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  The police haven't been too rough yet.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  We still got about three days of Bilderberg to go.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  And we're going to be doing everything humanly possible to get accurate information
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  and to try and get them to release some sort of press release, something,
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  even put on a semblance of openness, although I know it's not real meaningful.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  But I think we need to force their hand on that.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  Well, well said, Mark Anderson.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  I look forward to having you pop back on sometime tomorrow
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  when you've got more intel of what's happening.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  We're going to work on getting Jim on coming up in the last hour,
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  about an hour and 15 minutes from now, to get him to pop in.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  I know he's got jet lag and is exhausted and trying to make his way up to his room right now.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  So I'm going to put you on hold with my producer here in just a moment
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:17.000]  so you guys can try to work that out because you're there basically assisting Mr. Tucker.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  But before you go, tell folks how they can subscribe to the American Free Press
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  and get all these detailed reports that will come out in the next few days on Bilderberg.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  Online at AmericanFreePress.net, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  Call 888-699-News.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  That's 888-699-News for subscription information,
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  or if you want to just get a specific insert or issue.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  And then you can get a 16 weeks for 1776 trial subscription during the holidays.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  Sometimes it's 16 weeks for $16.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  That's four months of the foremost leading national news weekly.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  And it's among the independent media like yours and Republic Magazine
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  that is really trying to sort of dislodge the corporate media in America
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  and show that there's other voices out there.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  Absolutely. We're going to break here in about two minutes.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  I want to speak to you here in the break.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  I'm going to hand you over to Jared right now.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  We'll talk to you again soon, sir. Thank you for joining us.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  Thanks, Alex. Appreciate it.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  You bet. We'll get Mark Anderson on tomorrow or Sunday.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  Sunday might be the show, live, four to six p.m. Central.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  We do shows six days a week here. We just tuned in.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  Because so much happens over the weekend, I do a two-hour abbreviated broadcast transmission
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  because so much is happening.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  But maybe we should work on getting Tucker and Anderson on then as well
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  because then they'll have all their notes in hindsight and we can get some real intel
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  because things are just now kicking off.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  It starts officially Thursday, some arrive on the Wednesday,
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  and then they have the meeting Thursday evening, Friday, Saturday.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  They play golf generally, and then Sunday they leave.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  And we always get valuable info from Tucker.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  There's other people go to the meetings and kind of get some good intel,
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  make some stuff up.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  But there's other folks that get good information as well.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  But more and more, I mean, I'm just calling it like it is.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  Bilderberg is more about the spectacle of the elite trying to meet in secret,
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  trying to suppress media coverage.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  The world government's now out in the open.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  And, I mean, now this isn't Jim Tucker 30-plus years ago talking about world government
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  and, you know, digging through the trash at Bilderberg and stinking in and getting key info.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  And then that still happens.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  Now it's out in the open, a global constitution of the private central banks
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  that you will pay carbon taxes to.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  And Obama is hell-bent to get this through,
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  and he's saying, well, because of the BP spill, he's got to do this now.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  Because, you know, they've had this problem and because they can't seem to fix it
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  and just so happens Goldman Sachs dumped most of their more than half their stock
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  just on BP days before.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  And now Obama says, see, we need carbon taxes, we need an environmental takeover
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  because of this oil spill.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  And then BP, of course, is the chief globalist oil company,
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  one of the top companies that's at Bilderberg,
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  owned by the World Family of England and the Dutch World Family of the Netherlands,
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  in conjunction on record.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  This is one of the top new order operations.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  I mean, you watch my film in-game,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  It covers Bilderberg, their agenda, eugenics, the whole new order system.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  You watch that film and you very, very quickly realize that, you know,
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  these people absolutely must be stopped and that they're not going to give us any quarter.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  And it's very important for everyone out there to get in-game Blueprint for Global Enslavement on DVD.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  That's probably overall the most important film I've ever made
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  because it gives you in two hours and 35 minutes the entire spectrum of what we're facing.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  We'll be right back with your phone calls and a lot more than Victor Ostrowski joins us.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  And then, by SinoFresh.com, it works.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  All right, I'm going to go to some of your phone calls.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  Corey, Sonny, Bruce, free patriot Ian in this segment and the next.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  And then we've got Victor Ostrowski on.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  I had a lot of callers today.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  You heard them critical of what I had to say about the flotilla
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  and implying that I was saying people didn't have a right to defend themselves.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  Again, more strawman arguments.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  I don't care if people hate me.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  That's what folks don't understand.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  It doesn't hurt me if people make stuff up or exaggerate or bill strawman.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  I just feel sorry for people not being honest about what I've said.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  I was pointing out that I saw press reports where the people on that ship
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  had claimed that they were fired on first and now watching the videos,
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  it looks like they were attacking people first.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  Now, clearly, the boarding is a form of assault.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  And I got a guest coming on who's critical of it.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  But, you know, it's so tribal.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  It's like you got to be on the pro-Israel side or you got to be on the anti-Israel side.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  And I'm rebellious, folks.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  I'm not going to be on either side.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  I'm here covering the issues.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  And, you know, the articles on infowars.com and prisonbunna.com have been critical.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  You know, I'm trying to, in my own little way, stop some type of confrontation.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  But I'm not out there in the Mediterranean.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  I'm not boarding the ship.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  And I'm not beating the Israelis with the Poles.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  You know, I'm here in Texas calling for the Second Amendment and sovereignty
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  and supporting our borders and liberty.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  And, you know, a lot of what it is, is that people are just jealous of this radio show.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  You got a lot of people that are in the alternative media.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  A lot of people that have websites, blogs, make films.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  And they think I'm, like, floating around on Cloud 9
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  and that I know all these Hollywood people and I'm so cool.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  Now, what I am is a hard-working person sitting here in an office park in South Austin
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  who bust my butt, who's going to be working at 10 o'clock tonight
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  And so that's why I've been successful.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  And it just frustrates me that so much energy is spent on Alex Jones.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  I'd say maybe 20% of Internet activity that's anti-New World Order
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  is actually about me, positive and negative.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  I've never tried.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  I mean, I could start organizations.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  I just supported Likradowski and now we are changed.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  It has hundreds of chapters everywhere.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  I mean, all these tourney response teams are everywhere.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  All these other organizations, we have energized.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  My audience has energized.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  I could have some big organization and be some big leader and have groups under me.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  I don't.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  I don't want to be your leader.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  If I was an ego maniac, though, I would probably form an organization
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  and really try to reach for a lot of political power.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  But that's not even what I want.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  I understand the power of getting individuals to take action,
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  of getting individuals to reach out,
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  and getting individuals to expand their paradigms.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  That cannot be stopped.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  If this is a movement about Alex Jones being the big leader,
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  then it can be decapitated.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  But if it is an idea, an idea, as Vifra Vendetta says, is bullet proof.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  So we're going to break, cram in some calls,
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  and we've got Victor Ostrowski joining us after that.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  But I do want to, again, encourage listeners and thank listeners
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  that have supported this broadcast.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  You support it by spreading the word about the radio show.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  You support it by supporting the sponsors, local AM&FM sponsors,
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  and Genesis sponsors, and our sponsors, our web sponsors.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  And you also support us when you buy the books and videos,
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  which are the best out there.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  That's just not me saying that.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  You support it by reviewing our films
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  and calling the talk radio and talking about my films.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  You support it by buying the videos
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  or by giving us donations.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  Infowars.com or write to us at P.O. Box 19549,
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  Austin, Texas, 787-60.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  And the New World Order is not going to stop us.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  The haters aren't going to stop us.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  Nobody's going to stop us.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  Give it God's will.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  And I believe it's God's will we succeed together.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5-Star Soaps for years.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  You can buy factory direct shipped via UPS right to your door.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  or call 800-340-7091.

[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000]  Since 1947, Calden Soap Company has been showing consumers
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:59:48.000 --> 02:00:00.000]  Thank you.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  Okay, my friends, we are back live halfway into this transmission.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.000]  Victor Ostrowski, former Israeli Navy officer
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  and, of course, Mossad officer as well
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  is going to be joining us to give us this take
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  on what's happened with Israel and the flotella.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  Now, more ships coming.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  And what do you think Israel's going to do
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  with that situation, what Turkey's going to do?
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  That's coming up.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  Let's go to Corey Ian and others right now.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  Ian in England, you're on the air.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  Welcome.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  Hello there.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  Yes, yes, Ian, go ahead.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  Hi, very good to hear from you.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  Yeah, I've got...
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  And don't please don't get upset with what I'm going to ask,
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  but I've been very interested in your following of Machete,
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  the movie that is going out.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  And I'm just wondering why we can't...
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  I mean, you always say to validate the information.
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  And I've looked everywhere for a copy of the script.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  Is there anywhere that a surreptitious distribution occurred?
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  Well, to be clear, I was sent the script
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  by an unnamed person involved with the production.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  So we're just going to leave that...
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  I mean, you understand the media has sources
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  and you don't give those sources up
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  and you never get another source again.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  Yes, Alex, I totally understand that.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  Okay, okay, so...
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  And you've seen the trailer for it
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  and you can read the article two weeks ago.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  He did an interview, Rob Rodriguez, the filmmaker,
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  with Any Cool News and he said,
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  I agree there is some stuff in there
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  that could have caused problems with what's happening in Arizona
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  and then he's going to cut it out of the film.
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  And I shot video of the script with screenshots.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  The video I put up with video of the pages underlined?
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  Absolutely.
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  Well, that's a digital reproduction.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  I mean, how do you know...
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  I mean, if that could be fake, then the whole thing could be fake.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  I just put out a fake script.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  I mean, Rodriguez hasn't denied that I have the script.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  I mean, it's been in the Fort Worth Star Telegram,
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  the Miami Herald, the Arizona newspapers.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  It's been in the LA Times.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  It's been in the Washington Post.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  Mr. Rodriguez hasn't denied that I have the script.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  Absolutely.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  I'm not denying that what you put up there is in any way...
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  Well, I mean, it gets into a copyright issue.
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  It's one thing for me to show a script
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  and to show maybe 30, 40 pages of an 87-page thing.
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  And that's even, you know, really a spoiler.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  But, you know, I mean, this is political and it's news
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  and I'm exposing it to stop some type of race war.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  Okay.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  And so, I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  I mean, you know, the trailer is what's in the movie.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  I have the script and Fox, 20th Century Fox, pulled the trailer.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  I mean, what are you implying?
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  I don't understand.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  No, I'm not implying anything, Alex.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  That's the whole point.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  I said at the beginning, please don't take exception to it.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  No, I'm telling you, I just feel like it's wrong
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  to take somebody's book and publish the whole thing.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  I thought it was borderline to even show the script
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  and it was any other movie that wasn't about race war
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  and it hadn't been paralleled and if Arizona hadn't been called out,
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  this is a message to Arizona.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  And if I didn't think it was a PSYOP, I wouldn't have come out
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  and reached out to the director saying,
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  are you being used here, buddy?
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  I mean, I was contacted by his people.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  And so, it's a thin line to walk when you've got a script
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  for a movie five, six months before it comes out.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  I guess four months before it comes out.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  So, yeah, I mean, we have the script
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  and I'm not going to put the whole thing out
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  because, you know, I don't want to, you know, in hindsight,
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  he said he's cutting the race war stuff out
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  and then that even kind of feels dirty
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  to have somebody change something because I'm putting pressure on it.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  I'm not even calling for his censorship.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  I'm just speaking out against it
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  and pointing out the taxpayer money did go to it.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  What do you think of that?
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  But I don't have any wish to damage Robert Rodriguez
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  and, you know, and I think overall
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  they'll end up helping his film in hindsight
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  because they've talked about it, but now there'll be a counterbalance
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  to it in the debate.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  And I think because, I mean, he did say now that he thinks about it,
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  maybe he had too much tequila and he's going to change it.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  I mean, my job was to reach out to Robert Rodriguez and say,
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  hey, pal, look at what you're doing.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  And as soon as he said, you know what, Alex, you're right.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  There is a problem here.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  I said, well, I respect that. Good job.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  So, there you go.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  All right, we'll come back with our guests
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  and get into the whole situation with Israel and a lot more.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  for the global financial system.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  So it's going to be an inner, ruling elite, and then everyone else.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000]  Invisible Empire.

[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  How much do you want? All you can get.

[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water,
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  children, our education, our money.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  You have been warned.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  We have the facts. We have the constitution.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000]  and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  Don't tread on me. Rise the republic.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  A new tool in the info war. Don't tread on me.

[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000]  Gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  Let's get into this third hour. Victor Ostrovsky is our guest.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  We had him on many years ago about his book on the other side of deception.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  And, of course, the first book was a New York Times number one bestseller by way of deception.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  And that turned into a big court case when the Israeli government filed a suit trying to block it that went to the Supreme Court.
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  And you can go to his different websites, thebookpatch.com, where alternative books can be published online,
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  or you can go to his fine art website as well, and we'll give you both of those coming up.
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  But I wanted to get him on because I saw a Washington Post headline yesterday where he basically criticized what happened,
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  and he called it stupid. It was stupefying stupidity, I believe, was the quote.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  And he is uniquely qualified to talk about this because he was an Israeli naval commander.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  He was also the head of the Israeli naval weapons development program.
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  And then he was also a case officer in the Israeli Mossad.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  And then he left and spoke out about corruption, disinfo they gave the government, and other things.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  We were talking during the break before he came live because he hadn't been on in probably four or five years or longer.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  And I said to him, well, just to be clear, I'm not part of the religion of hating Israel,
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  but I'm also not part of the religion of worshiping Israel because it seems like there's two different polarized camps.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  And I make both sides mad at me. I just think every government's corrupted out of control like Thomas Jefferson said.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  And I think Israel, just from a layman's term, why not just stop the propellers?
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  Why not just let it come into dock and, you know, then follow any weapons via satellite?
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  I mean, it was definitely a PR disaster. And now you got Turkey coming in with ships.
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  You got another flotilla coming in with Nobel laureates on board.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  And, you know, you got the North Korea situation with the U.S. George Washington going there.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  All these crises popping up right now, we couldn't have a better guest on than Victor.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  So, Victor, break it down for us first, your experience in the Israeli Navy and then in the Mossad.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  I mean, I can't think of anybody better to speak about this than the point you made in the Washington Post
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  that you believe the actual boots on the ground who had the expertise were ignored
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  and that Netanyahu and others were running this.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  And so we'll talk about your history, what you think happened, what was wrong,
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  and what you think they'll do next knowing their mindset.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  Well, first of all, this kind of like united all the extremists in Israel.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  You know, shouting, actually, when you read in these really papers, the commentary after the articles,
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  they're saying, well, let them come again. We'll send them back in coffins.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  I mean, this is the kind of, you know, crowd mentality that you get when things like that take place.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  Netanyahu already announced today that he's willing to consider changing in the blockade,
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  using the blockade on Gaza and bringing international forces that would be helpful
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  in checking the materials that are coming in and out.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  So basically what they tried to do with this flotilla had succeeded.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  They wanted to point to a situation which is very disastrous, very bad for the reputation of Israel.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  You know, this blockade holding so many people in such a dire strait.
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  The stupidity, in my opinion, was on the tactical side, not necessarily just the political,
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  because, you know, sometimes I look at people and you see all the actors
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  and all these people come and talk about politics and what they would do and whatever,
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  and just because people know their name, they think they have a right to an opinion.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  I'm not a politician, so put that aside, look at the tactical side of it.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  Here come ships loaded with civilians who you know what they are carrying.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  You know there are no weapons aboard.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  The Turkish government has checked that.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  It is your ally.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  You're about to have a military exercise with the Turks in the Mediterranean,
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  so it's not really an enemy, right?
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  And they're saying there are no weapons aboard.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:46.000]  So, you know, take the steps and make it like try to stop them outside the territorial water.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  The Navy can do that.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  The Israeli Navy, the Israeli commandos, probably the best in the world in doing that
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  after the American Seals, they could have stopped them quietly.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  The guys on board would not even know what happened.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  But first of all, even though you have the San Remo Naval, you know, manual
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  that allows you to board ships if you have an embargo on an area outside your territorial waters,
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  why go there?
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  Why not let them cross into the territorial water?
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  It's still way out of range.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  I mean, you're talking about 12, 14 miles.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  Let them in.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  And then take whatever exercise you do.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  So, at least you're taking one bad block off the table.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  You're not in international water.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  Secondly, the rate itself, the way they came into the ship, that was stupid.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  I mean, I've worked with these commandos.
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  You can come down from a helicopter four at a time.
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  They chose to come down one at a time because of the narrow area that they had at the top of the ship.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  Who comes in the top of the ship?
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  Why not at the bow or the stern where you have at least two or three areas that are protected?
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  The whole operation was stupid.
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  You clearly saw that this was something that was kind of pulled at the last minute.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  Like somebody was shouting, go, go, go, go, go.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  We don't have any time.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  Let's do it.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  Let's do it.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:14.000]  And they had months to plan for this.
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  So, there goes my stupid and it's stupid.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  Well, I think it would have been politically smarter just to let the ships in.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  If they were searched in Turkey, there's not weapons other than clubs.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  Let them bring the aid into Gaza.
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  Well, now you're talking on the political side.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  Here's the problem.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  The Israelis have stopped the bringing in of supplies into Gaza to a point where, for example,
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  you can bring in, you know, cinnamon, but you can't bring in cardamom.
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  They have lists of things that the soldiers and the officers are busy making sure what comes in and what doesn't come in.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  The blockade is not just against weapons.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  They're not allowing construction materials like concrete and metal because they're saying that metal will be used for missiles.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  The concrete will be used for bunkers.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  They don't, and yet they had, and this is after the last raid into Gaza, which demolished, you know, 35% of all houses there.
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  So, the blockade is not just against weapons.
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  It doesn't allow a variety of foods.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  It only allows a very limited amount of medical equipment.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  So, the lists are very long.
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  This is a humanitarian problem with the blockade itself.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  This is not typical Israeli behavior.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  This is something that is almost vicious in its behavior to that.
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  That would never have been done and never has been done in the West Bank.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  They're trying to basically tell the populace in Gaza, as long as you have the Hamas as your leaders, you're going to be suffering.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  And that's against the Geneva Convention.
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  It's against everything else.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:06.000]  And that's also historically just going to turn the population who wasn't radicalized to Hamas and only make them dig in.
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  Absolutely.
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  We know that.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  I mean, the bottom line, the philosophy that always was prevalent in Israel was, you can't fight ideas with force.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  The only way you fight an idea is with a better idea.
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  And this has been forgotten.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:28.000]  It's like we can force them to surrender.
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000]  We know that's not possible.
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  I mean, we had a blockade against the state of Israel before it was a state.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.000]  It was still Palestine.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  And the British put a blockade and it didn't help.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000]  We kept bringing in people.
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.000]  We brought in arms.
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  We fought them off because the stronger they fought, the harder we fought back.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  This is the way people are.
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  There are three kinds of terrorism.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  There's a psychological or what's called ideological terrorists.
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  You have the territorial terrorists and you have the lunitons.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  Well, the lunitons and the ideological ones, you can usually beat.
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  But the territorial ones, you can't.
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  These are people fighting for freedom on their land.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  They almost always succeed.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  I mean, take it from the starting from the American Revolution and you go through every time.
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  You've got Vietnam.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  You've got the 80s with the Afghans and the Russians.
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  I mean, it's always, it's always.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  And the people who have the ideological ones, which used to be like the butter mine off
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:46.000]  or the Red Army Brigades or any one of those, they have disappeared in time.
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  That's why Al Qaeda, for example, tries to latch itself on to a territorial terrorist groups.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:18:01.000]  That's why Al Qaeda wants to be tied in with groups like the Hamas, like the people in Yemen,
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:10.000]  because they need a territorial background and a suffering of the people to recruit new people to their lines.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  The Gaza is like the magnet for all these terrorist organizations to recruit against the West.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.000]  It's the Mecca.
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  There's no question about that.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.000]  And the suffering there is unbelievable.
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  I mean, people don't understand what we're talking about.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  Going to the Gaza Strip, Sweato in South Africa, at its worst, was a paradise compared to what's going on in Gaza.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.000]  It's incredible.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  And the time we've got, I want to get into your books and some of the things you criticize the Israeli government
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  and the Mossad did when you were involved in it and also the Navy.
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  But you talked about militarily, if they were going to do this, you would go in an open-top wet submarine
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  or basically a glorified underwater seadoom.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  And then basically, there's a lot of different ways to disable those propellers.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  And then it doesn't give the people wanting to have this big standoff, this spectacular event.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  Because at a base level, people always cheer for the underdog.
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  You got folks with clubs getting shot by commandos.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:26.000]  I mean, any way you slice it is going to be a PR disaster for Israel.
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  And again, I'm no genius about all this stuff, but I could see that.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  I mean, it seems like a five-year-old can mentally work through all this.
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  Absolutely. It's stupefying.
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  I mean, how do you even explain it when you have the Israeli government responding and saying,
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:50.000]  OK, they came down with commandos on board ships in the middle of the night from a helicopter,
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:55.000]  and then they're saying that the people defending themselves are attacking the soldiers?
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  I mean, even the explanation is stupid.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:22.000]  Stay there, Victor. This is key info coming up.
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:33.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:37.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:42.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:47.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:04.000]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000]  Are we going to see economic growth?
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000]  Slide into a recession or at worst, depression.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:16.000]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:19.000]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:29.000]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold,
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:18.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:25.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:35.000]  Police State IV chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:10.000]  Victor Ostrovsky is our guest naval commander, the head of their naval weapons program
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:17.000]  and then of course recruited to be a case officer for the Israeli Mossad
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:22.000]  and he's authored two nonfiction books about his service in the Mossad. We're going to tell you about his website
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:30.000]  thebookpatch.com coming up or Ostrovsky fineart.com. This is a short segment.
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  You were finishing up with the plight of what's happening in Gaza
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  and then I want you to elaborate on the mindset of the Likudniks who say hey we got 400 nukes
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  and you know we're just ready to go wild I mean basically I mean hoodspose the word
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  and then expanding on that what you see happening with Turkey they're saying they're going to send naval ships in
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  they're saying that you know more ships from Ireland and Malta and other places are coming
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  and what do you expect Israel to do?
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  Well according to the prime minister he's already starting to show that he's you know under U.S. pressure
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:18.000]  and then he just may you know ease the Gaza siege. I mean there's no question about that
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  and easing it in a way that he would kind of like backtrack but not lose space into his own party
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  which is an extreme right wing party in Israel which has people like Lieberman and others
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  who are extremely right wing. I mean these are people who are calling for any citizen in Israel
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:40.000]  to make us oath of allegiance to Israel as a Jewish state.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  Now that would be a problem for a lot of Palestinians who are not Jewish
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  and he wants them to lose their citizenship should they not be willing to make that oath.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  So that's the kind of people we're dealing with.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  So Netanyahu is caught between you know the rock and the hard place
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  even if he wants to compromise he has to do it in a way that he shows that he's not losing face.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  He will try and give some leniency towards materials coming in
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  and that would alleviate the situation in the Gaza Strip without a question.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  Turkey may, may, I don't think they will but they may send you know an escort,
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  a military escort with those ships. Then the question is do you actually confront them?
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  Do you put Israeli ships to confront Turkish ships?
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:33.000]  That I don't think is something Israel would want to do.
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  Now the Turkish ships would not cross into Israeli waters.
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  They would probably stop in the international water on the line if that were to happen.
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:50.000]  Now we're dealing with countries here that are easy to get you know to heat up.
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:58.000]  You know Turkey with all due respect is not exactly your, you know, your angel in the area.
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  I mean they're dealing with the courts in a way that you know nobody wants to.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  They're preventing them from their own languages and there's a lot of things they have there.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  Yeah, Turkey's got a military iron fist and basically a front government and that's on record
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  and that's going to destabilize Turkey if they are put into a confrontation with Israel.
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  Absolutely and it's an internal problem that they have to solve too.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:24.000]  And Raduan who is you know trying to show a face to the Muslim world in what he's doing
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  is basically this whole situation has forced everybody in the whole arena to turn towards
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  their extreme side and say we're not on Israel's side.
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  That's what they have achieved in this.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  So this is what Israel has achieved in their attack on the ship.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  Egypt which was an ally to Israel for at least three years in this blockade
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  had had to back off and open the border between Gaza and Israel.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  Already 500 Palestinians had been allowed into Egypt and they're allowing a lot more.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  Something they had not done for the last three years under extreme pressure from all the Arab world
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000]  and they have allowed it now.
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  So basically it's kind of like, talk about shoot yourself in the foot.
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.000]  This is exactly what they have done.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  Had they stopped them out in the water like you said before with those what's called wet submarines
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.000]  which is really a large torpedo with two or three or six seats in it
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  that people you know divers are in it with their oxygen tanks and whatever.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  They could have come close to the rear end of those ships and stopped them
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  without nobody on board even knowing what happened.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  They could have boarded these ships in a way that would be a lot easier to handle.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:44.000]  I mean again they basically almost started the riot by you know they threw tear gas grenades first
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  before they came off the helicopters and then figured that's what's going to happen
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  and now some of them are saying well we came down with paintball rifles.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  Well okay even if they had paintball rifles which I doubt
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  how does the guy on the ground know that what's aiming at him is a paintball rifle?
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  Well how do all these people get killed if it's paintball?
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  Well and here's the funny part they say paintball rifles
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  but then they say what they shot at us they say that they didn't have any
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  the people in the ship did not have any weapons they said yeah but they took
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  some weapons from Israeli soldiers and then shot at them.
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  Well how is it when the Israeli soldier shoots at the paintball rifle
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  and when he's shot back it's a real gun.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  It's amazing propaganda but just to be clear earlier we're going to break
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  and we'll get the answer when we come back.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  You're saying that it's good the people were defending themselves or that's a normal response
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  I mean that's what I got from what you said before the last break

[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:43.000]  As founder and owner for over 63 years people keep asking me how's business?
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:47.000]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:58.000]  This is Alex Jones for www.survivalseedbank.com
[02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:01.000]  We're going back to our guest here in a moment
[02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:04.000]  and I may even keep him a little bit in the next hour if he can do it

[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:24.000]  and my film, Fall the Republic, exposes how there's a global corporate takeover of every sovereign nation on Earth
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  and how these big banks have sold derivatives to the nation states.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.000]  This is just a form of neocolonialism and a stealth empire
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:35.000]  and if we're aware of this system, it will not succeed
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000]  and it's already in deep trouble.
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:41.000]  So be sure and get Fall the Republic available at www.infowars.com
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  a two-hour film with expanded extras, such an important documentary.

[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000]  just came out about a month and a half ago
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  getting into the globalist and their overall master operation
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  and of course a solution video, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:03.000]  with myself, Michael Bagnarek, Charles Keeb, Evan Vieira and many others
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:06.000]  and it gets into the 10th and 9th Amendment, how to take the states back
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  and how to save our country, such an important document.
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:14.000]  Where were you during the Second American Revolution?
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:18.000]  Don't Tread on Me, available at www.infowars.com

[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  We have a great sponsor.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  You're going to love these folks of everything you can imagine for your self-defense need
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  and you need to go to weapons-universe.com,

[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  They have authentic movie replica swords like the one made out of folded steel
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  with a movie cone and they sent me one.
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:15.000]  It's awesome.
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  Made in Spain.
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:17.000]  This is nice stuff.
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  You won't find a better selection of brand-named, like cold steel,
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:26.000]  Spy Draco and Smith & Wesson, weapons-universe.com is the largest selection
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000]  and some of the best prices you'll find anywhere,
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:32.000]  weapons-universe.com or check on the link at infowars.com.
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  You'll be glad you did weapons-universe.com.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  And speaking of great info,
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:40.000]  because they tried to censor his best-selling books,
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000]  he set up the bookpatch.com.
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  Victor Ostrowski, again,
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  former Israeli naval commander and the Mossad case officer commander.
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  Tell us about the bookpatch.com.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  Well, the bookpatch is a website that is designed for writers of all kinds.
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:58.000]  It's absolutely free.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  You go there and you can start writing your book.
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:06.000]  You have writing tools that are not available anywhere that I designed for myself
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  and then made it available on that site.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  You can write there.
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  You can invite your friends to join you.
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000]  You can co-author with others.
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  You can communicate.
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:18.000]  You can write from anywhere that you have an internet connection.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:23.000]  You can use the site to have other people read your chapters and comment.
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:26.000]  You can hire or get editors to help you do that.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000]  And when you're done and everything is finished,
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  you can press a button and get it either downloaded as a PDF to yourself
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  or order a real hard copy book.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000]  You can order a single copy.
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:44.000]  You can get your first book for like $16 and then it goes down.
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000]  By the time you reach book number 10,
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  you're less than about $8 or $7 a copy.
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000]  Well, so that's a very affordable book on demand,
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000]  but really one-stop shop.
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  Absolutely, and you don't have to order them.
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  In fact, if you finish writing it, you can put it in the bookstore
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  and other people will order it and then they buy it.
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:05.000]  You don't have to order books.
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  You don't have to put any expenditure out forward.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.000]  I mean, I think people who have a talent or have something to say
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.000]  and want to have a book out don't have to go into a big spending spree
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000]  in order to get one in their hand.
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  I think it should be something that's really easy and cheap and inexpensive
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:24.000]  and that's what we try to do.
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000]  And that's why the book patches.
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  We've launched it about two weeks ago
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:32.000]  and we have over 400 people writing books as we speak.
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  Amazing.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  No, it's a genius idea and I hope folks check it out.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  And we'll talk about why you launched it from your experience of attempted censorship.
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:46.000]  Now, finishing up before we get into some other subjects with you while we have you,
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  what do you expect to happen though?
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  I mean, you're saying it'd be smart of Netanyahu to back off
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  and you're saying it looks like he is a little bit,
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  but the same bravada or arrogance or I mean, I don't know what you call it
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:02.000]  that caused this could lead to more.
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  I mean, I don't want you to look into a crystal ball because none of us have one,
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  but what do you think is most likely to happen?
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  Well, I think that the ships are going to continue coming.
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  There's no question about that.
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  And you can understand why there is a people in suffering
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  and there is a need to help.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  So this is just one covers the other and there is a force trying to stop them
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  and people feel that they're justified in doing it
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  and more and more volunteers will join and make that happen.
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  It's kind of like, you know, they're fighting the good fight, so to speak.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  What would happen is Israel will find a way
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:45.000]  and I think that's what they're working on now to allow the ship closer in
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  to surround it in a way that it's not harmful to the people on board
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  and to show that they're allowing the material to come down,
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:57.000]  but they don't want the big presentation.
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  That is the best smart way to do it.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  But again, considering the fact that we're dealing with the same people
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:12.000]  who send commandos in the middle of the night to drop onto a ship fully armed
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:18.000]  and then complain that they were being attacked, then, you know, what do you say?
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  I mean, what could you...
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  Well, that's another point.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:24.000]  I mean, there's that archetypal thing of men lowering down in the night
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  that that's when the bad guys come.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  That's right, and you're scared of that.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000]  I mean, wouldn't you be scared?
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  Now, don't forget, we're talking about people that have been dealing with Israel
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:38.000]  on the sharp side of the bayonet.
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:43.000]  So they know what happened, and Israeli soldiers have gone into the West Bank,
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  have gone into Gaza, had used their weapons.
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  People have died in large numbers.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  Yeah, a lot of the people on that boat have family or cousins or friends that are dead.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  I would not know.
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:00.000]  I don't know, but I know a lot of them are volunteers who have heard about that.
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000]  Some of them were former Gazans, yeah.
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:06.000]  Yes, yes, and some of them are people that have never been back to Israel
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  and their families have been evicted in 48.
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.000]  So you don't know, but there's a lot of tension going on.
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  And now when they're being attacked, they have no idea or no...
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  They can believe that the soldiers are coming to kill them.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  I mean, they don't know.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  And it's not like the Israelis came down from the helicopter through down ballots
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  and said, we're coming in in a force.
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  Do not resist us.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  We will fire at it.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:34.000]  They just came down those ropes and the people.
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:37.000]  And to say that they had weapons.
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  I mean, they're showing kitchen knives.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  Show me a cruise ship that doesn't have kitchen knives.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  Or binoculars.
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  What kind of weapons are those?
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  And then they have...
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  Well, they're calling binoculars night vision, but expanding on that.
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  A Arab member of the Israeli Knesset is on record, you've probably seen this,
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  saying that Israel wanted a high casualty to intimidate people from coming.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  But watching the video, and correct me if you think I'm wrong,
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  it doesn't really look like that.
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  It just looks like Laurel and Hardy, basically.
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  Absolutely.
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  You know what?
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  There is no way, no legitimate government in Israel,
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:22.000]  and I don't care if they're right wing or left wing or center,
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  would send people out to go kill them.
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  And anybody who says that doesn't know what the hell they're talking about,
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:34.000]  because that would not happen, and nobody would ever dare even say that.
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000]  Well, it wouldn't happen because it would be a PR disaster.
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  Well, no, it wouldn't happen because that is not what Israelis are about.
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.000]  That's not...
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  You know, that's taking it to a degree that it's not there.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  Let me expand on that since you brought that up.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  What about the USS Liberty?
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  Two years ago, they did declassify the NSA intercepts
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  that Israel was not being honest about why they attacked that ship.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  Well, let me tell you this about the Liberty.
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  I was in the Navy.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000]  I was not in the Navy at the time that it happened.
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  I can tell you categorically, okay,
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  from my knowledge of the people who were involved at the time in the Israeli Navy,
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  categorically, and you can see that I'm not somebody who goes out to defend Israel,
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  categorically, this was an accident.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  Now, there was a lot of screw ups on the way.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  I have spoken to many people on the Liberty.
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000]  I have said this again and again.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  There was an ambassador from Lebanon, an American ambassador in Lebanon who said,
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  and this was, he was making a speech, and I was on the phone.
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  I was on a remote, you know, contact.
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  And he said that he personally heard Israeli-sold pilots talking to each other
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  and saying that they recognized or they notified or they saw the flag that was being waved
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:51.000]  and that's American ship and they said, doesn't matter, let's go attack anyway.
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:54.000]  And then I turned to him and I spoke to him in Hebrew.
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:57.000]  And he did not respond because he said he doesn't understand Hebrew.
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  So I asked him how there, did you hear their voices saying that
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  because you think the Israeli pilots were talking English just for you.
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.000]  And he kind of backed off and he said, no, I read it in the transcripts.
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  I said, but you just said you heard them in your own years.
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:17.000]  And it went on and on. There's a lot of fabrication going on about that particular piece,
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  but I can tell you categorically, knowing the people.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:24.000]  I also know that the head of the Israeli Navy at the time was not found anywhere
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  and everybody was looking for him because they had the skunk on the radars,
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  a skunk being an unidentified ship.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:37.000]  And he was nowhere to be had because he was having a affair in the middle of the war.
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  So, you know, not everybody came out smelling well from that,
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  but that was not a deliberate act.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  And the mistakes were, you know, colossal.
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:52.000]  Well, I've interviewed the admirals and they're all dead now, but those interviews are there.
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.000]  And they said that when they got on the phone to McNamara and said we're sending ships to the fin,
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:59.000]  McNamara said, no, you're not to, and they refused his order.
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  And then LBJ came on and said, look, that ship's going to the GD bottom.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  And that basically it was a pre-done deal to blame it on Egypt,
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  but you're saying that isn't the deal.
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  No, I'm saying, no, no, no, you're mixing two things.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  The fact that there was a cover-up after that and that American ships or forces were not sent to aid
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000]  and all that, that is accurate.
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  I don't know about that.
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  I can't say to that anything.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  I can only say that the attack on the ship itself was not a deliberate act by the Israeli Navy or the Israeli Air Force.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:38.000]  And nobody who fired at any point has known or admitted to know that it was a...
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000]  Well, how could torpedo boats not see an American flag?
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:47.000]  Well, because by the time the torpedo boats arrived, you're talking about there was smoke on board already.
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  They called in the numbers that were on the side.
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  They did not see the flag because the flag was being waved towards the planes.
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:45:03.000]  This is all I can tell you. I mean, I can't get into a lot of detail about it because of the fact that I have not been there.
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  But I know the people that are involved.
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:11.000]  And on a personal level, this is completely on a personal level, I can vouch for every one of them
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:16.000]  knowing that none of the people I know would have opened fire on an American ship.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000]  Yeah, take it for what it's worth.
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  Yeah, well, from my research, it looks like a live-action Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000]  I mean, again, I'm not...
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:28.000]  No, no, no, actually not.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:40.000]  Now, where I find it hard to fathom, what I do find hard to fathom is the fact that the airplanes did not see the flag.
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.000]  Now, I don't know.
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:46.000]  Now, maybe a pilot was strafing and he saw the flag at the last minute and he doesn't want to admit it.
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000]  That could have been the case.
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  I don't know.
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  I've seen the footage from the machine gun cameras, right?
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:58.000]  And when it passes over, you don't see any flag at that point.
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:01.000]  And in fact, that is available in the Israeli Navy book.
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:02.000]  I have a copy of that.
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  No, I know.
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000]  I've seen the footage on television and it's a...
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  It's a gray gun pod camera.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:13.000]  You see a big black blob, but his eyes weren't shooting the black and white film.
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  Absolutely.
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  I can't argue with that.
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:24.000]  That's what I'm saying, I can tell you from the Navy standpoint, the people who were on board and were involved from the Navy side did not know what they were firing at.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:25.000]  Okay, well, that's your take on it.
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  I don't want to burn up all of our time.
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  No.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  Separately, you've written two books and I remember one account about the Israelis was submarine jacking in to a Libyan communications facility
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  sending out false flag info that then got Reagan to send in the Ardvarks and blow up Gaddafi's tents.
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000]  Break that down for us and talk about your books.
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:51.000]  Well, okay.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:56.000]  This was written in the other side of deception, which is my second non-fictional book.
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  And I described there what happened was there were Mossad units with special forces that came in and installed a bounce off device,
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:12.000]  kind of like a communication system that you can broadcast to it from some location.
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:21.000]  It then takes the communication that you've sent to it and will bounce it off as if it's coming from a source very close to where it's located.
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:25.000]  In fact, they put it in an apartment building, which was a block and a half or two blocks away.
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  I remember exactly from the Libyan high command and they broadcast information in code that was then broken to say that they basically took responsibility,
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  put responsibility on the Libyans for the Label attack where an American serviceman was killed.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  And that called in itself as a terrorist attack against American forces, brought about the attack by Reagan,
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:04.000]  who called in an air attack on Libya that killed Gaddafi's daughter, I think, one of his children or something.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000]  So that is a frame up.
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:07.000]  Yes.
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  And so when you were in the Mossad, you had knowledge of that.
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  Yes.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:14.000]  This is the information that I'm talking about.
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  Israel cannot be happy that you're talking about that.
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:22.000]  Well, Israel is not happy about anything I say.
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  The point is, I don't wave flags.
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:28.000]  When I talk about these things, I talk about either what I know.
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  No, I understand.
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  It sounds like you're saying you're a political atheist.
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  What are some other interests?
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  I mean, what made you get upset with the Mossad and critical?
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  What are some of the other misdeeds?
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:41.000]  Well, what got me, I'm not a political atheist.
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  I have a left-leaning and I admit that.
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000]  And I think the Palestinians should have a state.
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:52.000]  Well, my political atheist, I mean, you just try to analyze the facts you see.
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000]  Yes, I do.
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  My main concern with the Mossad and my main problem with the Mossad was the fact that
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  the Mossad is a very important entity in the protection of the state of Israel.
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:10.000]  And what it should do is gather information, analyze it to the best of its ability,
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:16.000]  put it into the process of, you know, into the rest of the information-gathering system,
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  and provide the leaders of the state the ability to make a decision which is based on reality and data.
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:29.000]  The Mossad had a tendency to feel that, you know, politicians come and go.
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  We can't rely on them to make the proper decisions.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  So therefore, we will tailor the information in a way that will cause and about the results that we call for.
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  You can't trust the Arabs.
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  There's never going to be peace.
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:44.000]  The Palestinians have no intention.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000]  And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000]  All intelligence agencies have been caught doing that.
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  Absolutely.
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  But, you know, not being a member of others, I can't complain about them.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:56.000]  And I don't feel a responsibility that I need to.
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  What type of missions did you mainly run?
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  Mainly recruiting of agents to...
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:06.000]  The difference between a case officer and an agent with a lot of people makes it up.
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:12.000]  A case officer is a person who works in the field and makes contact with people of the enemy,
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:18.000]  turns them, and then sends them back into their own countries to gather information for you.
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000]  That's what a case officer does.
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  And that was my...
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  So you were like a spy master?
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  Absolutely, yes.
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:28.000]  Well, yeah, in a way, you know, it's kind of...
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  It's more kind of a handler.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  And I was more on the side of the actual...
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  The actual point you made in the Washington Post that guaranteed Israeli intelligence is all over Turkey,
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:41.000]  they had people on probably all those ships.
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:42.000]  No question about that.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  In fact, the question that arises today about this, you know, this screw-up is,
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000]  which intelligence was wrong here?
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:54.000]  If the Mossad did not provide the intelligence to the naval intelligence,
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  then it's Mossad's fault.
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  Well, stay there.
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  Let's talk about that when we come back and we'll take some phone calls with our guests.

[02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:34.000]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:39.000]  Herb Kay was right. His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:43.000]  What have you got to lose? Stop the calls now. Get out of debt and have more money.
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:47.000]  Get Herb Kay's number one death secret absolutely free now.
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:51.000]  Call 800-822-1291.
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:55.000]  That's 800-822-1291.
[02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:59.000]  800-822-1291.
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:00.000]  Time.
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  All right. Maybe when we take a few calls, they can give us what that question was.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:38.000]  But Victor Ostrowski is our guest.
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  Thebookpatch.com is one of his websites.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:45.000]  And we're here discussing the situation the world's in.
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:51.000]  Separately, you've got the whole North Korean Peninsula with the U.S. aircraft carrier about to arrive.
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:58.000]  And I find it very curious that there's all these tensions rising globally as there's a world economic meltdown happening.
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000]  And I go back to World War I and World War II.
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:04.000]  We always have wars when the planet is in a crisis.
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:10.000]  And I don't know if it's human instinct or if it's being orchestrated or what's happening.
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  But looks like rough times are ahead.
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  Victor, what's your take on the whole geopolitical landscape?
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  That when you have problems with economically governments tend to go to war.
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  I mean, it drowns out their failures and puts the focus on something more dangerous.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  It's like they said that the biggest solution to all economic problems would be aliens if they arrived.
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:39.000]  Because then we would unite.
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  Things can be solved in simple terms, but politicians have a problem that they have short-term elections.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  They have to get reelected again.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  Well, you brought that up during a break.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000]  There's a lot of scandals in Israel right now.
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:56:04.000]  Maybe Netanyahu knew this would blow up, but it would have a way of unifying Israelis and is a good smokescreen.
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  Well, I think he's got a big problem with trying to solve the situation in the Middle East.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  I mean, when you have one of the chief heads of the American military go in front of Congress and say that every time an Israeli soldier suits a Palestinian kid,
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  you know, five more people join al-Qaeda and shoot at American soldiers in Afghanistan.
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:34.000]  And he tied the things together, which are to be tied.
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  I mean, one does relate to the other.
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  I mean, we're all, so to speak, fighting the same war against terror.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  And as we're fighting it, we're creating situations that allow people to be recruited into that world.
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  And we have to remember things from history.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:56.000]  I mean, people are saying, oh, you know, we have people that are Americans that have joined al-Qaeda.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000]  I know they're also surprised.
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  But don't forget, you know, you had British heads of the intelligence who turned sides and joined the Soviets.
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:12.000]  But you also had British commandos who helped set up the state of Israel as well.
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:13.000]  That's correct.
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  And so did American soldiers that were there.
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  But expanding on that, if you have a thousand predator drones killing people indiscriminately,
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  don't even have to know what their name is because they have a gun in Afghanistan or Pakistan,
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:30.000]  that is going to create real terrorism.
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000]  Well, the thing is this.
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  Here's the thing.
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:36.000]  We have created these monsters, so to speak.
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  No, we can't talk to them.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:40.000]  And if you can't talk to them, then you have to kill them.
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:44.000]  And they're saying, well, if you have to kill me, I'm going to fight back.
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  On the other hand, if you create a dialogue and you open a window and you say, wait a minute, wait a minute, you know, let's not do it that way.
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  But the military industrial complex once wore, once a pretext, once weapons sales, so it's only going to get worse.
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  Well, Eisenhower threatened against that.
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:02.000]  He warned us against that.
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:05.000]  He said at the time, beware of the military industrial complex.
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  And there is one, for example, in Israel.
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:08.000]  I know that for a fact.
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000]  The Israeli military wants to try new weapons.
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000]  They want to try new equipment.
[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000]  They want to make sure that things are happening.
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:22.000]  And that's why Mossad is part of that same game, saying, you know, we need to develop things so we can protect ourselves.
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  All right, we're going to do just one more segment.
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  We'll have to have you back soon.
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  We'll go to free patriot David George, a few others with quick questions for our guest.
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:32.000]  And then we'll definitely have him up sooner than, I don't know how many years.
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  It might have been eight, nine years.
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:34.000]  I forget.
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000]  I just remember we've had Victor on before.
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000]  He remembers it as well.
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:45.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:50.000]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:57.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:03.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:11.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:20.000]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:27.000]  Put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:30.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000]  We turned jeans inside out.
[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:37.000]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:41.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:46.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000]  Others don't.
[02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:00.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:07.000]  Alright, final segment with Victor Ostrowski.
[03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:13.000]  We will continue with your phone calls into the final hour that we just kicked off.
[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:18.000]  And I got a bunch of news on the BP oil spill, on the economy,
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:22.000]  on what's happening in China, North Korea, it's all coming up.
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:27.000]  But former Mossad case officer and he's also a Navy commander
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:31.000]  so uniquely qualified to speak about the flotilla fiasco.
[03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:34.000]  Victor Ostrowski is our guest for about another five minutes.
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  Free patriot in Ohio. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  Good afternoon gentlemen. How are you guys doing today?
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:42.000]  We're doing good. Go ahead.
[03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:47.000]  I have a question. This is for mainly towards Victor.
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  If Israel was attacked by other nations and threatened its existence,
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:57.000]  is it still possible for Israel to initiate the Samson option?
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:03.000]  Israel has a nuclear capability and I don't think they consider that.
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:07.000]  The Samson option is kind of like a generality that is used
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:10.000]  which is we'll take them with us and we'll go.
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:14.000]  Israel has the capability of smaller nuclear weapons
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  that can take out enemies that are trying to attack it
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000]  without destroying itself.
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:24.000]  Nobody around in that area really has the kind of capability to compare.
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  And so, as the head of Mossad just said about a week ago,
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  that Iran's capability has been hampered
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:34.000]  and their whole system is coming down anyway.
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:38.000]  Well yeah, Iran's trying to have it enriched in Brazil
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:41.000]  and then our own government's trying to block that.
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  I mean, that fixes it right there.
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  And Turkey, by the way.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:48.000]  Turkey and Brazil both offered to do that.
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:53.000]  It's a strange thing, but they have the option.
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:57.000]  They have the military capability and the nuclear capability to do that,
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  but I don't think it should be called the Samson option anymore
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  because it's not a self-destructive element.
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  Okay, thank you. You're welcome.
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  All right, let's talk to David in Florida. You're on the air with our guests.
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  Go ahead, David.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  Yeah, Alex. I have a question for Victor.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  You had a guest on the other day, Mr. Hart,
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:22.000]  and he was talking about the Mossad might be involved with the 9-11,
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:25.000]  and that was his theory.
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  I was wondering what Victor thought of that.
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:31.000]  Yeah, the former BBC reporter, I had him on as he talked to engineers
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:34.000]  who said it was explosives, and we know the buildings were blown up.
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000]  That's a separate issue.
[03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:40.000]  And then he was saying his theory is that Al Qaeda was going to do the attack
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  and that Mossad knew about it.
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  And because it did come out in our news that Mossad was shadowing him,
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  but what's your take on that, Victor?
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:03:00.000]  Israel as a whole, Mossad in particular,
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  would never get involved in anything like that.
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  The U.S. is an ally.
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:08.000]  We disagree on things. Israel disagrees with them.
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  But never, ever, ever would Israel do that.
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:20.000]  And again, like I said, I'm not the one defending Israel or whatever,
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000]  but I can tell you that categorically,
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000]  that knowing the people in the Mossad,
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  knowing a lot of friends of mine who are still working there,
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:30.000]  that would not be done ever.
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  Well, here's my issue. Government stage terror.
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  And Israel wanted us to go into the Middle East.
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  But Dick Cheney was in control of the stand down.
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  The Pentagon, NORAD, CIA drills that day.
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:47.000]  And so I see these intelligence agencies all joined at the hip.
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  So I mean, I know that governments are capable of anything.
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:58.000]  My whole issue is, and of course, I mean, I expose the entire 9-11 situation,
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:02.000]  that people who think Israel did the thing all by themselves.
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:05.000]  No, I don't think Israel was involved at all, period.
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:08.000]  What I'm saying is Israel couldn't run the attack,
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:11.000]  even if you believe that it is an inside job, which I do, Victor.
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000]  I have the evidence.
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:16.000]  I'm saying Israel couldn't run the entire attack.
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:19.000]  Well, Israel could not have been an even involved.
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  And that would be, you know what?
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:24.000]  Israel is an open society on that level.
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  And they would have come out.
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  And there is just no, there is no basis for that.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  And I can tell you that Israel would never, ever do that.
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  But certainly you've heard all the accusations about Israel being involved.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  I've heard so many things, you know, about the kitchen sink on them.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  And I'm the first one to point out what they are involved in
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000]  and what they're not from my personal knowledge.
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:49.000]  I can tell you that one thing I can guarantee with my life.
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:53.000]  And I would take my life on that, and Israel had nothing to do with 9-11.
[03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:56.000]  Well, you know what, sir? We've got to break. Do a few more minutes with us under the sack,
[03:04:56.000 --> 03:05:00.000]  because I'm going to finish up on this discussion with our guest, Victor Ostrowski.
[03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:01.000]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:05.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:06.000]  Tyranny is here.
[03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:10.000]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:15.000]  The United States is now recognized globally
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:18.000]  as one of the most impressive police states on earth.
[03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:22.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,

[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:29.000]  I was talking to him during the break and I said,
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:33.000]  look, I think Israel does corrupt bad things. They've been caught doing false flags.
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000]  You know, you've talked about it.
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:38.000]  And I said, I don't think Israel could carry out 9-11.
[03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:42.000]  And he said, well, Israel didn't do it. I can tell you that, but they sure could carry it out.
[03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000]  So, whoa, he's got my attention there.
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:48.000]  I want to hear what he has to say on that subject.
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:51.000]  And I'm glad that the caller brought up that point.
[03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:54.000]  So, Victor, please enlighten me.
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:57.000]  Well, anybody could do it. It was a very simple operation.
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:03.000]  The point was this, the operation that the Al-Qaeda carried out in taking out the buildings in 9-11
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:08.000]  and doing this whole attack was based on a simple basic thing.
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:11.000]  And the basic thing was that you were defenseless.
[03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:14.000]  You stood there. You had no expectations of it.
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:17.000]  You didn't have any system to protect you against it.
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:21.000]  You did not take any measures to stop anything like that.
[03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.000]  You were not even thinking in that direction.
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:30.000]  You had a whole system that was built and designed to fight the Soviet Union and to fight other, you know, countries.
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:37.000]  And here comes a small organization, relatively small, that had trained in the U.S. to fly planes, gets onto an airplane.
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:40.000]  You did not have a locked door between the front and the back.
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000]  You know, you go onto any allow plane.
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  No, no, I understand, Victor, but what I'm saying is, I mean, you're looking at this from the way it's projected at us.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  I'm looking at what, you know, the evidence shows happened on 9-11.
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:58.000]  Well, the point is, does Israel have, I mean, you know, technically, then you're saying a group of Israelis could have gone on, taken over.
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:02.000]  A group of, you know what, let's put it this way. A group of Kurds could have done it.
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:05.000]  No, I know, but, I mean, Israel doesn't have suicide operators.
[03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  Well, you know what? First of all, every country at its own time had somebody who, you know,
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:16.000]  I mean, the first suicide bomber was, you know, was Israeli in a way.
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  I mean, Samson said, may I die with a Philistine?
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  So, you know, it started somewhere.
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:28.000]  But the point of it is that to carry out such an operation, you don't need much.
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:35.000]  And to say that you have to have a whole system in place, when you're talking about, you know, NORAD or whatever,
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:43.000]  you're talking about some civilian airplanes that are flying in the air out of their lock when nobody at the time was thinking about that being done
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.000]  and that an airplane could actually be used.
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  Okay, let's go over this briefly. I mean, let me tell you then, and I can send you all this if you want it,
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:54.000]  because I don't expect everybody to, you know, be aware of everything going on.
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:11:02.000]  It is confirmed, Colonel Stephen Butler at the Defense Language School, Monterey, California, AP, San Jose Mercury News,
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  and I talked to him on the phone, it is confirmed in Newsweek, everywhere, that these guys,
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  I've interviewed Springman, the head of the Visa Division, they were ordered to let them in.
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:20.000]  They were told their terror list is only their cover. They worked for us.
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:22.000]  The CIA was running a drill that day.
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  They didn't have a terror list at the time.
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:28.000]  Oh, yeah, the CIA did with the State Department.
[03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:35.000]  Yeah, you know what? I'll make a deal with you. You see? I'm in total disagreement with you.
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  Okay? And I'm allowed to do that. I mean, you're the first guy who will say that I'm allowed to have a different opinion than you.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:42.000]  Sure, yeah.
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  I'm saying, okay, you got my email. Send me the stuff. Let me look at it. I'll come back and I'll kill them in an opinion.
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:50.000]  I may tear everything you say down.
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  Well, I mean, NORAD did stand down, and we do have the tapes of them saying,
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:58.000]  what's this exercise stuff on my screen?
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:04.000]  Absolutely. It makes absolute sense. You know, if that's the case and if that's there, yeah.
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:07.000]  Why would they think differently? It's not been done before.
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:11.000]  You know what? I was on a radio show when my book came out by way of deception,
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:17.000]  and I was arguing that, you know, some people are defending Israel's acts to the extreme.
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  And I said, what would happen one day if somebody walks up to you at 30,000 feet
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:24.000]  and puts a gun to your head and says, show me your passport?
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:29.000]  Now, do you want to have a passport that has a total agreement with everything Israel does
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:32.000]  or do you want to have somebody that actually stood up and said something?
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:39.000]  So this was not something that was not on the minds of people in intelligence services around the world.
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:45.000]  Israel did not put steel doors in the airplanes because they thought it would be better for the pilots
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:48.000]  because, you know, women wanted to get to them.
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  There was a reason for that. We all knew that.
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  America decided not to take action, not to protect itself because it was too costly
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:00.000]  because it would take too much money.
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  Let me expand on that. I mean, they've got naked body scanners in to teach us how to submit to...
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:06.000]  Now they do. Now they do.
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:09.000]  To teach us how to submit to tyranny. Look, look.
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000]  The Gulf of Tonkin was staged. That's now declassified.
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:16.000]  I've got the Army training manuals for captains in black ops that have been leaked,
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:20.000]  which the government admits are real, where they teach our Army captains how to stage terror attacks.
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:24.000]  Now, are you... I mean, you know about false flag. You talked about Israel.
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:25.000]  Absolutely.
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:30.000]  So what I'm telling you is... Look, now to be clear what you said during the break, though.
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  I mean, have you looked at the information about 9-11 having evidence of false flag?
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:36.000]  No.
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:39.000]  Are you aware that there are police and firemen saying,
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:44.000]  get back there blowing up Building 7 and that BBC reported Building 7 had fallen 25 minutes before it fell?
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:45.000]  No.
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  No. I'm telling you right now. No.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  I don't. But you see, I'm...
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  Either I've been brainwashed or whatever you want to call it,
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000]  but I don't believe that the American government.
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  I don't believe that the Israeli government.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000]  I don't believe that... I don't believe that.
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:08.000]  Now, I think it's rogue networks within the government structures working together.
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:10.000]  Look, I mean, Cheney...
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:12.000]  What was the point?
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:20.000]  PNAC, Project for New American Century, September 20, 2000, said minus a huge Pearl Harbor catalyzing event,
[03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:24.000]  we're not going to be able to launch our Pax Americana world government.
[03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:26.000]  We need a giant stage terror attack.
[03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:28.000]  We need a terror attack.
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:32.000]  You know, you know where all this has a problem,
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:38.000]  where I find a problem with the American government supposedly trying to take over everything?
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:42.000]  If we did, we wouldn't be in such a big debt to China.
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:46.000]  I mean, look at the situation we're in today.
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  The situation is not of a world leader.
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  The situation we're in today, you know, is a nation almost at its knees economically to a world that it gave open access to everything it has.
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:04.000]  If you think there's a problem here, I'll tell you what I think the problem here.
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:06.000]  I think the problem here is that we have no tariffs.
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  I think that anybody can come to this country, sell whatever they want, reprice they want, and we cannot...
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.000]  No, I agree, but that's globalization.
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  We were the globalist used America to build its empire.
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:22.000]  Now they've set us up as the boogeyman, and they're going to basically chop us down like wheat in the autumn.
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:25.000]  Victor Estrowski, I really appreciate you joining us.
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  And the website is thebookpatch.com.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  Two interesting informative books critically acclaimed on the inside of the Mossad in the Israeli government.
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:41.000]  I look forward to having you back in the near future, and we appreciate your insight on the situation with the flotella.
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:46.000]  And as that unfolds, you may be back with us next week for a brief interview if you can.
[03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  Okay?
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:48.000]  Any time you want.
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:49.000]  Victor, thanks a lot.
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  It's been a pleasure.
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:51.000]  Thank you.
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:52.000]  Thanks a lot.
[03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:53.000]  Interesting having him on.
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:56.000]  So we've had people on that believe Israel is the source of all evil.
[03:15:56.000 --> 03:16:00.000]  We've had people on who basically love Israel and think it can't do much wrong.
[03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:03.000]  We've had people on kind of in the middle of the road like Victor.
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:09.000]  So we're trying to give a wide view to this as I try to decipher what's going on here for myself.
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:12.000]  Like I've always said, I can't tell right away what's going on.
[03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:15.000]  But give me time, I can tell you.
[03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:20.000]  Just like day one, I said, look, stage with the underwear bomber on Christmas.
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  And within a month, we knew the State Department was ordered to let him on and protected him, and that was staged.
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:32.000]  And I'm not sure yet, but I'm getting more and more there that BP was a stage deal to pass carbon taxes.
[03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:39.000]  And now we find out that the stock was dumped by Goldman Sachs two days before at a record low.
[03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:43.000]  I mean, you know, I know how this system works.
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:47.000]  And I think even intelligent people like Victor, they look at it in a two-dimensional way.
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:52.000]  But I'm looking at it in a, not even a three-dimensional or four-dimensional, but a fifth-dimensional, you know,
[03:16:52.000 --> 03:17:00.000]  all these different angles and compartments and, you know, dimensions to it.
[03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:10.000]  You know, to really get that full spectrum analysis, that's how we're able to predict things so accurately here on the show.
[03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:16.000]  But it's mind-boggling.
[03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:20.000]  Look, I'm going to go to your calls in a bunch of news, but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up.
[03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:24.000]  He hadn't been on in a while, and gold has been way up in the last week.
[03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:31.000]  There are record levels in Europe, record levels here, premiums on gold coin surge.
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:33.000]  This is out of international business times.
[03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:38.000]  Despite the rising prices of gold, physical demand for the yellow medal continues to surge.
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:45.000]  Physical demand for gold is robust, and premiums on gold coins continue to rise in Kibomian markets in London, Dubai,
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:47.000]  Mumbai, New York, and Beijing.
[03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:55.000]  According to the Analysts for Gold Core, premiums on British gold sovereigns have increased from 3% to 7% in just one month
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:18:03.000]  on British sovereigns and British investors buy the coins as they do, and then it just goes on from there.
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:08.000]  And so I want to point out, Ted keeps buying gold when it's low, selling it when it's high at the old price,
[03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:13.000]  and he's run out of almost everything at, you know, the price when gold was $70, $80 lower.
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:18.000]  But he's still got a little bit, and then he bought other coins as it was going up that are still the best deals you're going to find.
[03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:27.000]  I mean, I use the example I've seen, one of the biggest gold companies selling Frank's, European Frank's fifth of an ounce for $360.
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:31.000]  And Ted last week, what was, they were $250 something.
[03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:35.000]  I mean, Ted's losing money in this market if he bought them now.
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:42.000]  So there's always a premium, but you can forget the premium, you can forget, you know, even bullion prices with these deals.
[03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:50.000]  So briefly, Ted, what do you have right now for people that's available because most coin shops are sold out or there's giant premiums?
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:59.000]  Well, like you said, Alex, the best thing that I have going on right now is the Frank coin at $256.68.
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  Now, if you buy that coin from us, you're going to get a full year subscription to Bob Chapman's International Forecaster too.
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:10.000]  Yeah, but if even if people have already got the free forecaster, which is twice a week and a great value, that isn't what matters.
[03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:14.000]  That $256 per fifth of an ounce, Frank, that's a really good deal.
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:18.000]  It's, it's, it's as good as it gets across the entire globe.
[03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:22.000]  And you're right about the British sovereigns to the premiums have shot up in them.
[03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:25.000]  The supplies are so thin that I don't even sell them right now.
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:34.000]  I'm not keeping stock because 800 686 2237 800 686 2237.
[03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:40.000]  Folks, don't screw around. Call up fifth of an ounce, Frank. That's what I've been buying the last few years.
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:42.000]  Really great deal. But, but briefly, tell me, come back.
[03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:46.000]  Tell us about some of the other coin offers you've got that are also excellent deals.
[03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  Folks, you're not going to find Frank's any less than this.
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:52.000]  And you're probably not going to be able to find them of this love.
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:55.000]  So, plus it's a patriot organization.
[03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:58.000]  They've got them on hand, ready to ship to you right now.
[03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:01.000]  We'll be back. Stay with us.
[03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:06.000]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:09.000]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:13.000]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:17.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule. Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:20.000]  So they think they own our land. They think they're on our water.
[03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:23.000]  Children, our education, our money.
[03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:27.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:32.000]  You'll have been warned.
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:35.000]  We have the facts. We have the constitution. We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:38.000]  We have common law. Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:42.000]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:47.000]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:50.000]  A new tool in the Info War. Don't Tread on Me.

[03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:03.000]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:08.000]  Are we going to see economic growth? Slide into a recession or at worst, depression.
[03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:10.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:15.000]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:23.000]  But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:29.000]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:33.000]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold,
[03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:38.000]  discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:43.000]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:47.000]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold 6000-year history.
[03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:53.000]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:57.000]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[03:22:57.000 --> 03:23:24.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:32.000]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself. Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:36.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:40.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:45.000]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:52.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[03:23:52.000 --> 03:24:01.000]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:08.000]  By the way, I talked to Jim Tucker, the granddaddy of the Bilderberg Sleuths,
[03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:12.000]  and there wasn't a point to get him on today. He said he hadn't gotten the intel yet,
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:19.000]  but he should have it tomorrow if not by Sunday from the global government meeting going on in Spain.
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:23.000]  So look for that tomorrow. I've got a key announcement coming up after the next break.
[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:26.000]  I'm going to blitz through some news and I promise get to all the phone callers
[03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:31.000]  that are patiently holding 1-800-259-9231.
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:37.000]  Ted, I've got some mainstream articles here today that explain that you've got bankrupt countries
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:42.000]  bailing out bankrupt countries and then they bail out the other bankrupt countries,
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:47.000]  but the private bankers are issuing all this currency and credit out of nothing.
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:52.000]  They're getting real assets in return. There's a method of this madness,
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:57.000]  and you notice Greece goes down and then Spain and now France and England and Iceland,
[03:24:57.000 --> 03:25:00.000]  and it's just getting worse and worse. The jobless number's up.
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  More factories shutting down. You've got the situation with Mercury.
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  Not going to be able to buy Mercury anymore, folks. The government runs GM.
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  They want us dependent, and there's no silver bullet to save anybody in this,
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:19.000]  except take the states back, take our government back, get a true fiscal responsibility.
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:24.000]  But as a stopgap measure to protect yourselves, I don't buy gold and silver as an investment.
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:30.000]  Though I started buying gold, it was $265 or so an ounce, and I still buy it when it's $1,200.
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:34.000]  And I don't sell it when it goes up to, quote, take a profit.
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:40.000]  It's an emergency backup against total depression, just like storable food or firearms.
[03:25:40.000 --> 03:25:46.000]  It's not that I'm living in fear. Oh, no, I'm living in control, just like the old timers,
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:50.000]  just like the grasshopper does in the store stuff during the summer.
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:54.000]  The ant does. The ant lives through the winter. The grasshopper dies.
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:59.000]  And a lot of people are buying gold right now as an investment.
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:03.000]  Look, the point is, and people only buy when it's going up. It's crazy.
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:06.000]  Well, with Ted, you can get in a time machine and go back and get a better deal on it.
[03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  Again, $256 per franc. I wouldn't buy just one and then get a free newsletter.
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:17.000]  That's a great way to stick your toe in. I would move substantively in it if I was you.
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:22.000]  But that's what I would do personally. Ted, briefly, what are some of the other coin offers you've got
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  and other gold coins you've got on hand, silver coins, some of the other smoking deals you've got?
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:31.000]  Well, the Walking Liberty Half at $975 is a great buy.
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:36.000]  We have Eagles, US Eagles. We have Krugerans. We have Maple Leafs.
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:38.000]  I mean, we have bags of junk silver.
[03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  I saw an article about runs on Krugerans the last two weeks in Deutschland.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:47.000]  You know, their output right now, the Krugeran has put out, it's at a 25-year high
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:49.000]  and they can't keep up with demand.
[03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:52.000]  The British sovereigns have been sopped up and taken right out of the marketplace.
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:55.000]  The Franks are falling short behind that right now.
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:59.000]  The Europeans, who normally don't buy gold, are buying it hands down.
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:02.000]  I mean, they can't get enough of it because they're watching their...
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:04.000]  And we've always talked about this.
[03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:09.000]  You've got maybe one percent of the population that buys gold to physically hold it.
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:12.000]  It was less than half a percent just two years ago.
[03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:14.000]  It's about to be two, three, four percent in the West.
[03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:17.000]  It's already more than 50 percent in India or China.
[03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:22.000]  As the yuppies figure out that paper is dangerous, you're not going to be able to find gold, folks.
[03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:24.000]  I mean, it's already happening.
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:26.000]  I don't know how to say it, Ted.
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:30.000]  I was telling them seven years ago that $265 should get into it.
[03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:32.000]  Are they going to listen now?
[03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:33.000]  Well, I sure hope so.
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:37.000]  I mean, if they're sitting in the stock market, bond market, if they have annuities,
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  if they're sitting with money in the bank, I mean, you name it.
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:44.000]  Just anything you can think of, even the real estate market has been incredibly volatile
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:46.000]  because of all the debt associated to it.
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:50.000]  You just simply can't get away from the fact that the United States dollar
[03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:56.000]  and foreign currencies are under attack because the central banks that create this money
[03:27:56.000 --> 03:27:59.000]  are printing money out of thin air and it's competing with what we have.
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:01.000]  It's going to drive the value down.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:02.000]  That's why people want gold.
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  I mean, people in India right now are buying gold jewelry like nobody can, you know,
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:08.000]  like no tomorrow.
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:12.000]  And I just need to say, if you're sitting in the stock market, bond market,
[03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:16.000]  whatever it is, if you have a paper asset, you better start considering gold and silver
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:20.000]  because it's going to be one of the few things that will hold value, including your home.
[03:28:20.000 --> 03:28:22.000]  Well, it's like Mark Twain said.
[03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:27.000]  He wasn't interested in a return on his money, but just to be able to keep something.
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:34.000]  And again, I mean, I'm not getting into gold and silver for an investment.
[03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:36.000]  I'm doing it as an emergency backup, but it is.
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:41.000]  Is there any investment, Ted, that's done as well as metals in the last seven years?
[03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:45.000]  Well, not even in the last seven years and go back up to all the way back to 6,000 years.
[03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:52.000]  The only time that paper investments did well was from about 1980 through about 1999,
[03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  right in that timeframe.
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:58.000]  Otherwise, gold and silver has always produced more than the paper investments do.
[03:28:58.000 --> 03:29:04.000]  And of course that 20 years of artificial boom is now was designed to sink us as we
[03:29:04.000 --> 03:29:05.000]  plunge into world government.
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:08.000]  What are your silver half dollars that I know that was one of the best deals.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:09.000]  I heard you.
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:10.000]  Oh, that's it.
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:11.000]  That's a really good buy.
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:15.000]  That's about half dollars right now at 975 a piece and you just can't beat it.
[03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:17.000]  It's a great way to get into silver.
[03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:18.000]  It's private portable.
[03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:25.000]  Plus also exempt from that 6045 Revinal ruling, which was introduced in 1983 past.
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:29.000]  Well, well, I mean, I mean, I mean, to be clear, tell them Alex Jones sent you or the
[03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:30.000]  prices will be a little higher.
[03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:31.000]  There's still great deals.
[03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:35.000]  But to get these specials, it's the radio special with Alex Jones.
[03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:38.000]  So you make sure say no, that's the deal I want.
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:43.000]  Okay, 800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:47.000]  You can ask them about some of the other specials they've got as well.
[03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:48.000]  800-686-2237.
[03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:51.000]  We'll be back with the news.
[03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:53.000]  We're on the March.
[03:29:53.000 --> 03:29:55.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.000 --> 03:30:00.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:30:00.000 --> 03:30:03.000]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:30:03.000 --> 03:30:05.000]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:08.000]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:30:08.000 --> 03:30:13.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalist through their own words and documents.
[03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:18.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:20.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:30:20.000 --> 03:30:23.000]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:30:23.000 --> 03:30:26.000]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[03:30:26.000 --> 03:30:31.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:34.000]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:30:34.000 --> 03:30:39.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:46.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:30:46.000 --> 03:30:48.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:50.000]  Invisible Empire.

[03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:32.000]  Let it all hang out cause we gotta run mate.
[03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:38.000]  I love the final piece of the song.
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:45.000]  Smokey's got his ears on and he's hot on your trail and he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:55.000]  Okay, I've got some news I want to hit but I also want to go to your phone calls George, Sam, Tim, Charlie, Mike on a host of issues
[03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:58.000]  that folks want to discuss here today in the last hour.
[03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:03.000]  But before I do that, I want to make an announcement.
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:12.000]  As you know, for two years, I have been working on a documentary about chemtrails.
[03:34:12.000 --> 03:34:18.000]  And I had been planning to have it come out sometime in the fall or winter of this year.
[03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:20.000]  And we are going to do that.
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:32.000]  And it's more than just a chemtrail film, it's a documentary dealing with all the different ways or some of the main ways that the establishment is poisoning us.
[03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:37.000]  That the establishment is toxifying our food, our water, our medicines, our air.
[03:34:37.000 --> 03:34:49.000]  And the reason I'm now making the chemtrail film is in the last two years, government's gone from denying that they're doing these aerosol spray campaigns to admitting it but putting a spin on it.
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:52.000]  And we have lots of footage of chemtrails.
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:35:02.000]  But we're going to be done with this in about two months and it takes a month or so to get it packaged, ready, you know, mastered, completed.
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:05.000]  So it should be out in, you know, October or so.
[03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:15.000]  But making the film, I do want to get some more of the activist in it, you know, with you out there shooting the chemtrails.
[03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:25.000]  And, you know, maybe while you're shooting the chemtrail, giving us some of your commentary so that we can show the activist out there that are exposing this.
[03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:36.000]  Or if you get a tour of your fluoride facility, then if you send us the footage with a letter, you know, giving us authorization to use it, however we want the film and your number, we can call you about it if you want.
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:39.000]  I'm not guaranteeing if you send it to us, we'll end up using it.
[03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:46.000]  Whoever shoots video of chemtrails or gets a tour of your water treatment plant and the sodium fluoride, you should upload whatever you do to YouTube as well.
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:50.000]  Because, you know, the main goal of this is educating people.
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:56.000]  But we do want to get more footage of chemtrails versus real con trails.
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:35:57.000]  You can send us both.
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:04.000]  And we want to capture, you know, the different diversity of not just people in the U.S. or Canada, but in England or in Europe.
[03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:06.000]  So let me give you the P.O. Box.
[03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  And we've got about a month deadline on this and we're going to be able to use this a month, maybe a month and a half.
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  Because that limited staff, we've got to get your video and watch it and then make sure you've given us authorization to use it.
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:24.000]  Basically just send a letter saying, you know, I give you full authorization in the known universe through this limited license to use this however you see fit.
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:27.000]  But I retain, you know, the right to use it however I want.
[03:36:27.000 --> 03:36:29.000]  And your name, Belly Bob, in the footage.
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:31.000]  Then we can use it.
[03:36:31.000 --> 03:36:40.000]  But more than just chemtrails, because we've got a lot of that, but I also want to be able to show it in different parts of the country and show a map and say this person shot this here, this person shot that there.
[03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:44.000]  If you don't want your name used, put that in the letter, just authorizes to use it.
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:55.000]  And again, I'm not saying I can use everything I've sent, but if you've got chemtrail footage you shot, set up a camera and talk about the footage you're sending us along with the footage.
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:37:02.000]  Don't send us your originals because we get so busy, you know, we can't guarantee I'll have the right address or send it back, send us a copy.
[03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:04.000]  Or if you don't want it, you can send us the original.
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:06.000]  But let me give you the P.O. Box.
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:11.000]  It's P.O. Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:20.000]  And this film, two years in the making, more than five years of research, we got Ben Livingston, the father of weather weapons and everything with that footage I shot five years ago.
[03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:26.000]  When it got declassified, how the government could create hurricanes, steer hurricanes, use hurricanes.
[03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:30.000]  The point is this film covers every angle, okay?
[03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:34.000]  And, I mean, the film is well more than half done.
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:37.000]  And it's kind of been sitting there on the shelf while I got more material.
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:49.000]  And I finally just said, look, I have this problem with obsessing on something and just getting more, more, more, more, more, kind of like my JFK film, five years in the making.
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:51.000]  I'm going to try to just pound it out.
[03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:57.000]  It's just that I've just got so much.
[03:37:57.000 --> 03:37:59.000]  So this is more than a chemtrail film.
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:06.000]  This is a eugenics documentary about so many issues, vaccines, you name it, and we're covering everything.
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:09.000]  This will be the definitive chemtrail film.
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:15.000]  But I do want to have, we've already got people from California and Texas and a few other states.
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:20.000]  And I, there it is on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:25.000]  They've zoomed in on the wall to where I have the PO box up there for when I forget the address.
[03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:30.000]  It's Info Wars, PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:33.000]  Please mail it to us as quickly as you can.
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:40.000]  Carry a camera around with you, put it on a tripod, get us good footage of the chemtrails, handheld, whatever, you know, and just get it to us.
[03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:43.000]  But also make some comments.
[03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:50.000]  And that may end up in the film because I want to show not just Alex Jones talking or the 20 plus people we've interviewed for this.
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:54.000]  I want to show you the people and we the people out there.
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:56.000]  And I want footage from Germany.
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:38:57.000]  I want footage from Russia.
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:38:58.000]  I want footage from Japan.
[03:38:58.000 --> 03:39:03.000]  I want footage from Brazil, from Mexico, from England, from Ireland, from Scotland.
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:05.000]  I need your help Info Warriors.
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:18.000]  So PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760 and Dave over at the Alex Jones channel will also snip it out this little this little rant and post that for people on the web.
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:22.000]  And we're going to post this video on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:25.000]  I mean, it's an amazing documentary.
[03:39:25.000 --> 03:39:28.000]  And we got incredible chemtrails.
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:35.000]  But I just, I really want to show you the activists and have a little of that flavor in there.
[03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:37.000]  And that's the final thing I need to finish this film.
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:42.000]  So I want to thank you in advance for all your support and all the people that have mailed us chemtrail footage.
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:47.000]  We have mailed a lot of great chemtrail footage when I called for this a year ago and two years ago, respectively.
[03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:50.000]  But really no one sent me footage with them talking.
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:52.000]  And maybe you're nervous.
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:58.000]  I'm like aiming at a chemtrail while you're talking, say, I'm here in Bakersfield, California.
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:01.000]  And they're spraying all the time or up on a hilltop.
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:07.000]  You know, the shots I really want are cities because I've seen this so many times, but I don't have a camera.
[03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:14.000]  I got 360, Austin, and you'll see a blue sky and then they start spraying the trails and they just the turns the whole sky into a haze.
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:18.000]  And they're spraying them at 5,000 feet.
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  And the planes go and turn around and go in crisscrosses.
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:23.000]  They're not landing.
[03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:24.000]  They're not waiting to land.
[03:40:24.000 --> 03:40:25.000]  I mean, rural areas.
[03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:32.000]  Also, also, send us your photos to Rob D, R-O-B-D.
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:39.000]  It stands for Rob Do at InfoWars.com or J-A-R-O-N.com, Jaren at InfoWars.com.
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:42.000]  Send us your photos that you took.
[03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:50.000]  Bigger res, better, and with a little note where you took it so we can put on the screen, you know, where this was shot.
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:51.000]  Photos are great as well.
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:53.000]  Photos you took five years ago.
[03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:59.000]  If you shot the video 10 years ago, I want to be able to say this is 10 years ago in Florida and Tallahassee.
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  I mean, dig through it all.
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:02.000]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:06.000]  PO Box 1, 9, 5, 4, 9, Austin, Texas, 7, 8, 7, 6, 0.
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:11.000]  You know, I hate even getting into chem trails here on air without even going over what it is.
[03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:13.000]  You know, we've got new listeners going.
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:15.000]  What in our nation is this guy talking about?
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:19.000]  Well, just Google White House Calls for Geoengineering Planet to Save Us from Global Warming.
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:24.000]  Then you find out, they go, yes, we've had a secret program and we didn't want to tell you about it.
[03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:33.000]  We've had people, like we paid, you know, so they had money for the hotel and stuff, to send we are changed to events in California.
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:40.000]  Over a year ago, where top globalists admitted, yeah, we've kept the program secret, but now we're telling you we are geoengineering.
[03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:43.000]  I mean, this is powerful stuff.
[03:41:43.000 --> 03:41:45.000]  Yeah, there's the Wall Street Journal.
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:49.000]  Team Obama will consider geoengineering to fight climate change.
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:58.000]  See, but then when you actually go to the conferences, they admit, oh, well, all the previous stuff was just a giant secret test on all of the continents of the planet.
[03:41:58.000 --> 03:42:09.000]  And we got footage of jets flying right beside another jet with no condensation trail versus a trail, or we've got jets at 5,000 feet in the summer where you cannot get ice crystals.
[03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:22.000]  And at 30,000 feet up above them where you're supposed to get them, no ice crystals or real contrails being laid down that are dissipating in seconds versus artificial ones that are up there for hours.
[03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:29.000]  I mean, it's just, it's unbelievable the scale of this program that is going on.
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:34.000]  And, you know, there's facilities out in Arizona, just Google Chemtrail Facility, Arizona.
[03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:36.000]  We don't have the money, the time, the energy.
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:43.000]  If you want to go shoot footage of that and send it to us, and we got the photos, send it all to robd.infowars.com.
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:49.000]  In fact, Matt, Matt, did we create that special email just for me?
[03:42:49.000 --> 03:42:51.000]  Do we ever do that?
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:53.000]  Because I asked them two weeks ago to create it.
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:57.000]  You know, we'll create one chemtrails.infowars.com right now.
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:43:00.000]  Will you call the IT guys in here right now?
[03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:01.000]  Thank you.
[03:43:01.000 --> 03:43:06.000]  Because if I don't do this now, it won't happen, chemtrails.infowars.com.
[03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:08.000]  Chemtrails.infowars.com.
[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:14.000]  Matt, can I have Chemtrails.infowars.com?
[03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:16.000]  I can't have Chemtrails.infowars.com.
[03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:17.000]  Can we set it up right now?
[03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:18.000]  Awesome.
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:19.000]  I know that's a short notice.
[03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:20.000]  Okay, I'm done ranting.
[03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:21.000]  I apologize.
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:22.000]  I'm out of control.
[03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:25.000]  I'll hit news in the final segment, but let's talk to George in Connecticut.
[03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:26.000]  George, you're on the air.
[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:27.000]  Welcome.
[03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:31.000]  Thanks a lot for Alex.
[03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:35.000]  It's nice to hear a little bit of rationality from the Israeli interview.
[03:43:35.000 --> 03:43:40.000]  I just wanted to quickly make a suggestion for that JFK thing because you brought it up.
[03:43:40.000 --> 03:43:46.000]  Doug Horn was on Unknown Country with Whitney Strieber.
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:47.000]  He's absolutely fantastic.
[03:43:47.000 --> 03:43:50.000]  You have to get him on as a speaker at some point.
[03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:57.000]  He basically was part of some sort of investigative group that was with the military that definitively
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:02.000]  went through all the details to show that they were all either fabricated or manipulated
[03:44:02.000 --> 03:44:03.000]  or whatever.
[03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:09.000]  Well, Los Alamos Laboratories three years ago tested the lone bullet and found it wasn't
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:13.000]  the same bullet as the fragments, and there were no fragments from the lone bullet.
[03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:14.000]  It's all fake.
[03:44:14.000 --> 03:44:19.000]  Yeah, well, that's exactly what he was getting into, but he goes into meticulous detail.
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:23.000]  Excrociating detail is what I'm saying.
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  You can't shoot his stuff down easily.
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:31.000]  Doug Horn is somebody, maybe you know Whitbley or you know how to contact him through with
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:32.000]  the...
[03:44:32.000 --> 03:44:35.000]  Yeah, well, somebody bring me a pen here.
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:38.000]  I had like five of them and I walked out of the room with them.
[03:44:38.000 --> 03:44:40.000]  Doug Horn, was he involved in Los Alamos?
[03:44:40.000 --> 03:44:44.000]  Because that was even in the Dallas Morning News three years ago about the Los Alamos
[03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:48.000]  National Laboratories that the Army did the test.
[03:44:48.000 --> 03:44:53.000]  Yeah, he was a part of the last investigative thing to go over all the material, and even
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:56.000]  with the brain stuff, he seemed to search that down.
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:45:03.000]  He came up with new details, but he had like a $70, $5 volume thing on each piece of detail
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:09.000]  so that he's probably done more definitive investigation than anybody on that.
[03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:13.000]  Paul, I'll have to get Jesse Ventura to talk to him then because I'm consulting on...
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:17.000]  Ventura is supposed to come to Austin the next two weeks, interview some locals with
[03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:22.000]  what they're doing with the Threat Fusion Centers and with my Breaking of the Mic report.
[03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:27.000]  That's one of the episodes, but I'll have to give him that Doug Horn thing on the JFK
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:28.000]  thing.
[03:45:28.000 --> 03:45:29.000]  I appreciate your call.
[03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:30.000]  Anything else, George?
[03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:31.000]  One other thing on the Build The Burgers.
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:37.000]  Why can't we do something like the South Koreans did a number of...it was about a year ago
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:38.000]  or something like that.
[03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:43.000]  They used something like Twitter where they basically would just fed up with their government,
[03:45:43.000 --> 03:45:45.000]  something bailing out one of their big companies.
[03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:49.000]  They had a couple of thousand people and before you know it, they kept Twittering all over
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:53.000]  the place until they were millions of people on the floor.
[03:45:53.000 --> 03:45:57.000]  Maybe something like that should be suggested or so how they did it because whenever one
[03:45:57.000 --> 03:46:01.400]  of these characters, whether it's a politician or Build The Burgers, if we could use what
[03:46:01.400 --> 03:46:06.000]  the Koreans did, instead of just a couple of hundred people showing up, there'd be
[03:46:06.000 --> 03:46:10.000]  tens of thousands showing up and each day growing, maybe they'd get the idea to shut
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:12.000]  this thing down before it gets out of hand.
[03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:15.000]  Well, that's a good point.
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:16.000]  I appreciate your call.
[03:46:16.000 --> 03:46:19.000]  I mean, it's up to you, the individuals, to make things like that happen.
[03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:23.000]  I know for several years they've had Twitter systems and others where the paparazzi use
[03:46:23.000 --> 03:46:28.000]  it to harass movie stars and TV personalities because everybody's on the Twitter and L.A.
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:31.000]  going, I've got Charlie Sheen getting him.
[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:35.000]  He's over here eating and that's kind of mean because Charlie doesn't deserve that.
[03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:41.000]  But for the politicians and the globalists, it certainly is an effective tool to expose
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:43.000]  them and let them know we're not happy with their criminal activity.
[03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:46.000]  You know, at least come over there and have a hundred people show up at a restaurant
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:49.000]  when they're eating and say, we don't like your new world order.
[03:46:49.000 --> 03:46:50.000]  We're not your slaves.
[03:46:50.000 --> 03:46:52.000]  Just to let them know, hey, we know who you are.
[03:46:52.000 --> 03:46:57.000]  But as Brzezinski said, the people are now aware of the fact that we have a world government
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:46:59.000]  and that's a big part of it.
[03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:01.000]  Sam in California, you're on the air.
[03:47:01.000 --> 03:47:02.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[03:47:02.000 --> 03:47:06.000]  I know I don't got much time, so I'm just going to quickly start off by saying you're
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:12.000]  a true patriot and on top of that, you are humanitarian because information is everything
[03:47:12.000 --> 03:47:14.000]  and we need to educate everybody we can.
[03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:20.000]  I just recently was fortunate enough to get a link from a friend to your Facebook page
[03:47:20.000 --> 03:47:23.000]  and ever since then, I've been listening to you every single day and I've been trying
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:26.000]  to call and I just finally got through today.
[03:47:26.000 --> 03:47:27.000]  That's a beautiful story.
[03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:29.000]  I mean, that's how we're reaching more and more people.
[03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:35.000]  I think of unlocking a mind or giving somebody, you know, a great source of a multi-spectrum
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  information because my listeners are activists and are reaching out to people.
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:43.000]  That's why we're having an effect and it's not just this show.
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:49.000]  It's a paradigm shift across the board if the people realize that personal contact or
[03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:55.000]  internet contact from person to person with the truth is unstoppable if people realize
[03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:56.000]  the power they have.
[03:47:56.000 --> 03:47:57.000]  But go ahead.
[03:47:57.000 --> 03:47:58.000]  Absolutely.
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:47:59.000]  You're absolutely right.
[03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  And I just wanted to quickly touch up on Israel and a few other things because I myself
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:05.000]  am a Persian American.
[03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:06.000]  I'm a Muslim American.
[03:48:06.000 --> 03:48:10.000]  And I don't want people lashing out at Jewish people because that's not right and that's
[03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:12.000]  not Islam at all.
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:18.000]  The thing is you need to distinguish the difference between Judaism and Zionism.
[03:48:18.000 --> 03:48:22.000]  The Zionists are the ones that control the major state of Israel.
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:28.000]  And there's actually a group that I just recently found online called Jews United Against Zionism.
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:33.000]  And these are Jewish rabbis, Orthodox Jews that do not believe in the truth of Israel.
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:34.000]  Now it's a neutral card.
[03:48:34.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  It's a neutral card, yeah.
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:37.000]  Absolutely.
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:41.000]  And this is just one thing that needs to be touched upon because people are really starting
[03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:43.000]  to move towards anti-Semitism.
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:46.000]  And that's not what is the solution because that's not right.
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:52.000]  Well, my issue, though, is that the brand of Zionism with blockades of Gaza and doing
[03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:54.000]  all those horrible things is really bad.
[03:48:54.000 --> 03:48:55.000]  I'm against it.
[03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:58.000]  But then there's, well, I think it's terms.
[03:48:58.000 --> 03:49:03.000]  When people use a term like Zionist, well, I mean, there's so many like Christians who
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:05.000]  want the end of the world to happen in Israel.
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:07.000]  They call themselves Christian Zionists.
[03:49:07.000 --> 03:49:10.000]  So I think that's where these terms confuse people.
[03:49:10.000 --> 03:49:11.000]  I agree.
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:12.000]  They do.
[03:49:12.000 --> 03:49:16.000]  And these are things that we need to distinguish the difference between because the last thing
[03:49:16.000 --> 03:49:23.000]  we need is misinformed people starting controversy that we don't need because we have bigger problems
[03:49:23.000 --> 03:49:29.000]  like the Bilderberg group and these elite who see to control our world, our way of life,
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:30.000]  our way of thought.
[03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:32.000]  And that's the true terrorism.
[03:49:32.000 --> 03:49:38.000]  That's what we need to fight is the fact that they go on the news and spread their propaganda
[03:49:38.000 --> 03:49:41.000]  to basically manifest fear in people.
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:50.000]  So when they come out with these outrageous plans to have carbon taxes and this and that,
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:53.000]  we can't stand for that.
[03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:54.000]  And you know what?
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:55.000]  Information is everything.
[03:49:55.000 --> 03:49:56.000]  You're doing the right thing.
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:49:57.000]  And I'm going to do my part.
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:49:59.000]  I'm going to take footage of Chemtrails.
[03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:04.000]  I've been telling every person that I come in contact with about you and your show.
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:06.000]  And that's just what I'm trying to do.
[03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:07.000]  I'm 26 years old.
[03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:08.000]  I'm a different demographic.
[03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:13.000]  And me and my friends, we've been buying respiration gear in biochemical suits.
[03:50:13.000 --> 03:50:18.000]  We've been buying everything we could, gold, everything, because we actually do think these
[03:50:18.000 --> 03:50:22.000]  elite are going to try something absurd, like martial law.
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:24.000]  And you know, I just can't see that happening.
[03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:29.000]  Well, I mean, it's an incremental martial law where they put you through naked body
[03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:32.000]  scanners and then admit they're recording your genitals and laughing at you.
[03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:33.000]  That's martial law.
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:39.000]  Or when the IRS takes your house, or when cities are taking houses for $360 water bills,
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:41.000]  that's martial law.
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:46.000]  When the government's saying they may take your pension funds, that's martial law.
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:50.000]  When police are beating up people for videotaping them, that's martial law.
[03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:53.000]  And so incrementally, we are going into this.
[03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:57.000]  I'm going to hit a few news articles and a few more calls on the other side from Charlie,
[03:50:57.000 --> 03:50:58.000]  John, Sean and others.

[03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:39.000]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global

[03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:12.640]  Well a couple weeks ago prominent members of Chicago society, 80 plus years old were being
[03:54:12.640 --> 03:54:17.720]  robbed at weapon point so they defended themselves with firearms and I said watch they're probably
[03:54:17.720 --> 03:54:23.880]  going to be indicted and the mob boss daily is moving to have them indicted.
[03:54:23.880 --> 03:54:29.200]  Korean war vet in Chicago in the last few days used a firearm to shoot and kill a long
[03:54:29.200 --> 03:54:37.280]  time felon who was benefited from the catcher release program and he was breaking in to
[03:54:37.280 --> 03:54:44.040]  the home and attacking the guy's wife so he shot him and Mayor Daley is basically calling
[03:54:44.040 --> 03:54:46.840]  him scum.
[03:54:46.840 --> 03:54:50.600]  Just like a reporter a few weeks ago talked about the second amendment now there's no
[03:54:50.600 --> 03:54:54.440]  right to own guns in Chicago so they have a higher crime rate and Daley went crazy and

[03:55:34.920 --> 03:55:43.960]  what happened it was all lies his approval rating and his polls went up went up.
[03:55:43.960 --> 03:55:47.680]  So that's the good news people are not buying the propaganda anymore in that article is

[03:56:08.600 --> 03:56:13.760]  Pleasure to talk to you Alex long time listener first time caller welcome every brief we're
[03:56:13.760 --> 03:56:20.560]  running out of time like yourself I always like to get my information correct I'm sorry
[03:56:20.560 --> 03:56:25.720]  I missed Victor when he was on but I have a statement from a doctor Alan Siborski is
[03:56:25.720 --> 03:56:32.080]  a former director of strategic studies Institute U.S. Army War College he states in a one line
[03:56:32.080 --> 03:56:38.360]  statement it is 100 percent certain 9-11 was a massage operation he's an impeccable
[03:56:38.360 --> 03:56:44.000]  source and I think he has access to intelligence that you and I could only dream of having
[03:56:44.000 --> 03:56:58.560]  me who is that again Dr. Alan Siborski S.A.B.R.O.S.K.Y. my only issue is I had Alan Hart on earlier
[03:56:58.560 --> 03:57:04.160]  former top BBC reporter and he said well I think the Arabs are going to attack us in
[03:57:04.160 --> 03:57:11.280]  Israel new and basically piggybacked and from my research you know NORAD was ordered to
[03:57:11.280 --> 03:57:17.020]  stand down Cheney in front of the transportation secretary in the bunker said the order still
[03:57:17.020 --> 03:57:22.420]  stands for the stand down the U.S. embassies were ordered to let the guys in they were
[03:57:22.420 --> 03:57:27.040]  trained at military bases they thought they were taking part in a drill and I know it's
[03:57:27.040 --> 03:57:32.640]  all kind of cause celeb and trendy to say Israel did it I understand that I'm not seeing
[03:57:32.640 --> 03:57:37.240]  Israel doesn't do false flags and there were a lot of neocons involved in 9-11 that are
[03:57:37.240 --> 03:57:45.620]  you know really Israeli agents but to say just Israel did it I like tar please detailed
[03:57:45.620 --> 03:57:50.840]  analysis Charlie and that explains how they have mole rogue networks in all the major
[03:57:50.840 --> 03:57:55.720]  western intelligence agencies it's kind of like the Mujahideen had Pakistani Israeli
[03:57:55.720 --> 03:58:01.560]  U.S. and British support and over and over again they I'm just saying there's multi heads
[03:58:01.560 --> 03:58:08.320]  of the Hydra people say no it's a one-headed dragon well I mean you know my research shows
[03:58:08.320 --> 03:58:12.280]  multi-headed dragon I mean what do you say to that I believe there are others that are
[03:58:12.280 --> 03:58:16.960]  complicit in this operation it just wasn't one-sided I want to touch on one other thing
[03:58:16.960 --> 03:58:21.960]  and then we'll let others get through as far as your chemtrails spraying with the chemicals
[03:58:21.960 --> 03:58:26.120]  that were all being exposed to it as a product out there that will get rid of all of these
[03:58:26.120 --> 03:58:31.440]  toxins and unfortunately we're out of time so we want to have time to get others through
