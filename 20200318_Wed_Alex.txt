[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  It was August 17th, 2018, when I had Millie Weaver on, she really wanted to come on the
[00:25.000 --> 00:31.500]  show. She said that she talked to some amazing Intel sources they had, and that a bio attack
[00:31.500 --> 00:36.000]  was going to be launched in the future. They failed to remove Trump with the Russia gate.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  She was on for 30 minutes. The full video was posted at Bandod Video. We reposted it
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.000]  yesterday, August 17th, 2018. Here's just some of what her sources said.
[00:48.000 --> 01:05.000]  There's chatter in the intelligence community that it would be something along the scale
[01:05.000 --> 01:11.000]  of a chemical attack, a biological attack. It's going to be a way to attack Trump, attack
[01:11.000 --> 01:17.000]  free speech on the Internet. People like InfoWars Alex Jones would have some bit of finger pointing
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  that the left could try to do and leftist media could try to do, and it would essentially
[01:21.000 --> 01:28.000]  just be to further roll out the next shift, the next phase in their whole social media
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  game, which is take back social media because it was never designed to be a free speech
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  platform from their perspective. This was always designed to just simply harvest information
[01:38.000 --> 01:43.000]  from the public so that they could better sort out who they're essentially going to
[01:43.000 --> 01:50.000]  control and cull. They keep saying on CNN, MSNBC, Trump's going to cause violent attacks
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  on the media. One of the things that's alarming about this besides the very real potential
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  that this kind of anger can easily lead to violence is that instead of taking steps to
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  tamp down the anger, curtail the protesters, even just admonish them, the President of
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  the United States has encouraged them. When all he does is respond back to them and calm
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  liars, and they're running around saying shut down the alternative media, people like me.
[02:11.000 --> 02:18.000]  It's risk free. He can rant as much as he wants without having to back up his claims.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  You think Alex Jones is going to change his behavior based on a timeout?
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  I don't know. We have found that it does have the potential to change impact and change behavior.
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  They pulled the video and then had Lester Holt, New York Times, thousands of publications
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  today say that I called for battle rifles to be used against the media.
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  Jones urged his Twitter followers to ready their battle rifles as he put it against the media.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  And then they just showed quotes where I talked about if Antifa attacks your house
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  if you're a congressman or a cop, they've doxxed you, you should have your rifle ready
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  at your house to defend yourself. And then they just showed battle rifle as one quote,
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  and then they say Antifa chicoms the media. And then Holt says...
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  Alex Jones on Twitter posted this week what essentially is a video calling for people
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  to get their battle rifles ready against the media, saying it's time to act,
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  it's got to be done now, move criminally against people.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  It's going to chill up my spine.
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.000]  I know a PR rollout when I'm seeing it, and now seeing it came out this morning
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.000]  and said Alex Jones is a domestic terrorist planning terror attacks with no links or no proof.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  So I'm sure now that this is one of their big October surprises in the next month or two
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  to stage something or provocative something and blame it on me.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  But the fact that they're saying I'm calling for this whenever I said it is chilling.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  Alex Jones and Antifa wars do not advocate violence against the media or anyone else.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  If there is an attack on any media outlet or any reporter, it is not.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  Countness by us is not. Advocated by us is not done by us.
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  It is a false flag with...
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  Ah, folks, and there's more. This is part of a larger report.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  It goes back to Millie predicting everything. The full video is at man.video.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  When we come back, though, it's unspeakable how crazy everything is.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  The hysteria and so many people buying into it.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  The virtue signaling.
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  The wicked flea when no man pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  We'll be right back.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  Infowars.com, newswars.com, and band.video.
[04:46.000 --> 04:52.000]  Tamara's News today and the defense of humanity in our future forever.
[04:52.000 --> 05:00.000]  Stay with us and spread those links.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  Our constitutions, our health, is our most valuable asset.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  It's what allows us to stay alive on this amazing planet that God's given us.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  And we've got to take care of our bodies. We've got to take care of ourselves.
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  And all the products at infowarstore.com have been researched deeply
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  and have been developed with some of the top experts in the country
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  to maximize what God's given us through Mother Nature
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  to help our bodies boost their defense against all the insane things
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  that have been artificially introduced into our environment.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  So please visit infowarstore.com today during all this hysteria
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  and realize it's not toilet paper or flashlights that you really need.
[05:45.000 --> 05:50.000]  Sure, it's okay to have plenty of that, but it is high quality supplements
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  and we've got the best.
[05:52.000 --> 06:20.000]  And during this crisis, I am discounting everything 40% at infowarstore.com.
[06:20.000 --> 06:23.000]  America is falling to its knees.
[06:23.000 --> 06:30.000]  America is learning to shake in fear of an invisible enemy.
[06:30.000 --> 06:36.000]  There are reportedly millions of deaths, but they're really not millions of deaths.
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.000]  There's not even 20,000 deaths worldwide.
[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  But don't worry, $2,000 for each American from the federal government.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  Government wants phone data to track the sick, just like Communist China does.
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.000]  USA closes border with Canada.
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  Yeah, how are they going to make us try to stay in our homes
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  and supposedly work from home and all of this
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  while at the same time the Northern and Southern borders are open?
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  So that's something Trump had to do before he declares
[07:13.000 --> 07:20.000]  the ban on interstate travel that we know they are moving very quickly towards doing.
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  There's a lot of hysteria, a lot of fear,
[07:23.000 --> 07:30.000]  but really no discussion of the fact that it's a man-made virus.
[07:30.000 --> 07:36.000]  And then it came out of Wuhan, China, and that the Chai comms have set the precedent on how to deal with it.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  Why we're hearing, we're going to follow the exact pattern
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  to track everybody with their phones to keep us safe.
[07:43.000 --> 07:52.000]  And one man in Kentucky got it, went to the hospital, got better in a day,
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  checked himself out, went home, and now they're guarding the house with police, with guns.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  Everyone virtue signaling.
[08:01.000 --> 08:08.000]  America falling to its knees, directed by the globalist.
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  And people celebrating it and saying,
[08:11.000 --> 08:19.000]  how dare you not say this virus is the most evil, most vicious thing the planet's ever seen.
[08:19.000 --> 08:24.000]  The very same lep is to tell us leave our borders open for bubonic plague and drug-resistant TB
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  and all these things that kill millions of people every year like TB.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  That's not a problem.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  Bring all that in. Don't test people.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  Let their kids sit right next to your kids in school.
[08:33.000 --> 08:41.000]  That's all A-OK.
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  Wow.
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  But boy, don't you leave your house and you stay on that internet
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  and you get your government announcements and your corporate announcements
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  and you beg for that vaccine that's coming.
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  Oh, and how do we know when you've had the vaccine?
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  It turns out Bill and Melinda Gates in Full Wars broke the news on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  David Knight, like source inside MIT, sent us the documentation.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  I went and looked up and found open source information confirming it
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  that they're going to have to wear a wristband that changes colors for the day
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  to be able to go out and travel and live.
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  And you're going to get a digital tattoo under the skin.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  They don't call it a microchip or a mark of the beast.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  It's just a digital mark under your skin.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  COVID-19 tracking bracelets and invisible tattoos to monitor Americans.
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  Globals like Bill Gates pushing black mirror type tech on the masses.
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  And the article's not hardcore enough.
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  I'm glad Kelly McGreen wrote the story.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  It starts out with the MIT information.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  You go to the bottom, there's all the links to Bill Gates announcing it.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  Turn in your guns. Take your force inoculation.
[09:52.000 --> 10:01.000]  Don't leave your house unless you have your digital tattoo and virtue signal
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  to everyone that you're not going out and you're not shaking hands
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  and you're just going to be a cave dweller in your house.
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.000]  And now they're saying coronavirus pandemic could continue for two years.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  German health experts warned.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  And then what was the article yesterday?
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  A dire new U.S. report out of Axios.
[10:23.000 --> 10:31.000]  18 months till the wave crest stay in your homes for 18 months.
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  Of course, the criminals aren't going to stay in their homes.
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.000]  And society is going to break down in a matter of a month.
[10:39.000 --> 10:45.000]  And they say, oh, just stay and stay in your home for two weeks.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  It's a big social experiment.
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.000]  Two weeks they're going to say, oh, by the way, you can't come out of your house, period.
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  And then your neighbors cattle on you and they call the police.
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.000]  I see my neighbor.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  In fact, it's in USA today.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  It's on infowords.com as well.
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  People are calling the police on anyone they see coughing.
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.000]  That's right.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  If you cough, they call and the police come and they grab you and you're taken away.
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  New York bar and restaurant owners could face a rest if they break New York coronavirus lockdown.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  In California, millions lockdown.
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  9-11 gets calls about neighbors coughing USA today, but it gets better.
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  Californians and Texans that it's in the local laws,
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  homeless are allowed to travel wherever they want, do whatever they want,
[11:39.000 --> 11:49.000]  and are allowed to openly spread it, but that's actually in the California new law they've passed
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  and the new code, order of health officer, county of Santa Clara,
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  and then they've got a similar state law.
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  And it says the homeless are allowed and are exempt from staying in your homes.
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.000]  Do not congregate.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  The homeless, of course, are exempt.
[12:03.000 --> 12:10.000]  And so are the illegal aliens and all the Islamic invaders who are rioting and burning and waving flags
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  and torching more cars and attacking police.
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  They're using this as party time and everyone is bowing to them.
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  Meanwhile, in Kentucky, police surround home of a man with coronavirus,
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  force him to self-isolate a Kentucky man who tested positive coronavirus,
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  took himself out of a hospital against the doctor's wishes,
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  and was then placed in a mandatory quarantine by police officers surrounding his home.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  Oh, yes.
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  But the southern border is still as porous as a sieve.
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.000]  Our reporters were down there a few days ago, following credible reports.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  Tim Reames and Rob Dew at Band-Aud Video.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  Those are very important.
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  You need to see those for yourself.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  People smuggling toilet paper across from Mexico, humans being smuggled,
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.000]  giant holes already cut in the fences, and of course, no border patrol,
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.000]  no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  But don't worry.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  You're going to shelter in place and not go outside your home
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  because the virus could kill you.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  And all the schools have been shut.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  Even though in the actuaries, you don't find any deaths of young people.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  There's a few cases of 40-year-old people that get it and are sick,
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  and it's like all over the news, he's been sick for a week.
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.000]  He's not getting better.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  We may have the first death of someone under 50!
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  Steadly!
[13:34.000 --> 13:41.000]  So we're just being primed and prepared when they release the real bioweapons.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  You know, Mike Adams, your stay when I was debating him, said,
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  Alex, you can't have it both ways.
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  You can't have it where it's a deadly bioweapon, which it is.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  And it's a giant hoax.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  Well, actually, that's a false dichotomy.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  And I need to preface every time I disagree with Mike on something.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  Oh, and we're all buddies.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  That's what America is about, is debate and discussion.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  And Mike enjoys the debate.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  What I'm saying is, it's a bioweapon manmade that they've tested before in the lab.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  You release something that you know the trajectory of.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  That's sort of what a weapon is.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  It's been battlefield tested.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  It's then released, and it's all prehyped and ready.
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  And it does have a kill rate, and they know the kill rate.
[14:30.000 --> 14:41.000]  And so they then overhyped that rate to create incredible fear on a bioweapon that is what they call a simulant.
[14:41.000 --> 14:50.000]  You know, it turns out they released one of the flu viruses eight, nine years ago, the year before, in a vaccine as a tracker.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  So they're doing all of this experimentation.
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  So I am concerned the virus is going to kill a lot of people.
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.000]  But the entire fear-mongering is the real threat to the economy, to our liberties, to our future.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  And now they're getting, at MIT, microchips ready for us.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  Oh, but they're little, and they're a digital gel.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  And it's just tiny.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  It's like, you know, smaller than a grain of rice.
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.000]  And it's invisible, only scanners pick it up, and no one will know, and then you'll be authorized.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  Then they update your digital tattoo that you've had all your shots.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  This is it.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  This is the force immoculation.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  This is the gun confiscation.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  It's all being announced.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  And so I'm not debating how deadly the virus is.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  You notice that the numbers just keep going down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  And then when we've all been locked down, oh, it's the lockdown saved everyone.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  That's why the lockdown, the virus has been floating around.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  Most estimates are for at least six months.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  Now, it does reinfect, and that's really why it's dangerous.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  I don't think the death rate is the reason we're scared of it.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  It's the fact that it is an autoimmune type deal.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  So I definitely are going to get it, so just get ready.
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems

[17:56.000 --> 18:03.000]  It was like a bad dream seven weeks ago.
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.000]  The ghost cities in China that then spread to Europe.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  And now San Francisco is a ghost city.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  And we see fights and brawls taking place over toilet paper.
[18:13.000 --> 18:25.000]  People don't need toilet paper to survive, but people do need high quality water filtration and they need high quality supplementation by products like DNA Force Plus, X2 and X3.

[19:00.000 --> 19:22.000]  It's a beautiful world outside, but inside the halls of government, inside the corridors of the megacorporations and tyrannical regimes like China.
[19:22.000 --> 19:30.000]  And the communist party that runs it, there is a raw desire for power and control over people.
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  And now we learn from an MIT tipster.
[19:35.000 --> 19:41.000]  We even got the documents and we're able to search them and then discover that it was accurate information actually in the public domain.
[19:41.000 --> 19:55.000]  The Bill and Melinda Gates are preparing an embedded digital tattoo under your skin to show that you're not infected with coronavirus so you can travel and buy and sell.
[19:55.000 --> 20:19.000]  The Mark of the Beast 666 is here.
[20:19.000 --> 20:37.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:37.000 --> 20:47.000]  Out of a preponderance of safety, I've talked to my wife and family and I've said,
[20:47.000 --> 20:57.000]  Hey, it's good to stay around the house and do things and then still go into work and then you're not going to be around other people.
[20:57.000 --> 21:13.000]  But the idea of the border and borders being wide open and all of these different populations still pouring in and then everyone self quarantining and everyone social distancing is ridiculous.
[21:13.000 --> 21:23.000]  You have all the leftist cities that led the way shutting everything down in coordination with the media and the chikoms.
[21:23.000 --> 21:37.000]  And then they're the very cities that have passed waivers for the homeless to wander around with their lowered immune systems defecating on everything and peeing on everything.
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  It's just incredible.
[21:39.000 --> 21:52.000]  So again, the level of hysteria, the level of fear and the numbers were told about all the millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions that are going to die.
[21:52.000 --> 22:03.000]  But then as soon as we start to see lockdowns, we're told, Oh, you know, now those numbers are not going to be as bad now.
[22:03.000 --> 22:10.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I intend to take your phone calls today.
[22:10.000 --> 22:24.000]  We're going to have David Knight in studio with us as well, starting in the last segment of the sour into the next hour.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  I have so much news and so much information to get to I'm going to begin it all.
[22:28.000 --> 22:34.000]  When we start the next segment, my earpiece has gone out.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  So I'm going to play a very important report that I was already going to play next segment now.
[22:39.000 --> 22:45.000]  And then I am going to come back and open the phones up throughout the transmission.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  And again, Millie Weaver is also joining us as well.
[22:48.000 --> 22:55.000]  But first let me get to this very important report.
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000]  Because it breaks down exactly what we're facing.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  Marshall Law USA 2020.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  Very important report.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  Marshall Law USA 2020.
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  It's posted a Bandai video.
[23:09.000 --> 23:13.000]  Please share it.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  He is 21st century war.
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.000]  I've criticized the president for not getting ahead of it saying it's serious because they would then demonize him.
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.000]  Early on the conservatives convinced him to not do listen to us.
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  Later he did listen to us, but now I'm concerned he's going to go too far.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  This is seismic.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  Italy has declared Marshall Law three weeks ago.
[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  France and Spain declared Marshall Law today.
[23:38.000 --> 23:46.000]  President Trump is only trying to line up with other world leaders so that it can't be said that he didn't respond properly.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  That's the trap the Democrats put him in the deep state.
[23:49.000 --> 23:55.000]  And then when he does that, like block the Chinese flights a month ago, they say he's being racist and hateful.
[23:55.000 --> 24:05.000]  As Europe sets the precedent in Italy and now in Spain and now in France today of declaring Marshall Law and banning interstate travel basically.
[24:05.000 --> 24:11.000]  That then sets the bar to where if Trump doesn't do it, then the media will say when there's death, it's his fault.
[24:11.000 --> 24:19.000]  That's how this trap of the phobia and the panic over this virus that's not been proven to be that deadly.
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.000]  I'm sure it's killing some people.
[24:20.000 --> 24:21.000]  Looks like it's designed for old folks.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  Yes, it's manmade.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  But this thing is how we're going into global government.
[24:25.000 --> 24:32.000]  We had the UN testing disease X one year ago and test marketing and saying it's going to come.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  It's going to bring in world government.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  It's going to smash these nationalists that don't want to be hooked into a global government.
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  The UN said disease X will be here within a year or two.
[24:41.000 --> 24:46.000]  Then Bill Gates at a tabletop exercise four months ago to 60 something million dead.
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.000]  And then now, of course, he's got a vaccine patented and it's all rolling out with a propaganda.
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.000]  This is an unbelievable time to be alive.
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  Well, you know, we've never had an interstate travel ban.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  So I don't really know what that would mean.
[24:59.000 --> 25:10.000]  But I am told that there's an ongoing debate in the White House as we speak with members of the legal counsel's office urging the president not to attempt to impose a travel ban.
[25:10.000 --> 25:22.000]  The word is that he's intent on doing so tonight, although I've checked with several journalists I know and nobody seems to be having nobody's been alerted yet about of a press conference.
[25:22.000 --> 25:31.000]  That's not to say that one couldn't be held abruptly and knowing the president's desire to control the airways and the extent to which the coronavirus has basically silenced him.
[25:31.000 --> 25:39.000]  It wouldn't surprise me that he would use the time period allotted to the Biden standards debate to grant the discussion and to once again own the airways.
[25:39.000 --> 25:48.000]  But we're using this hysteria clearly this global force that's been hyping this and the media hyping it and big tech in the authoritarian states hyping it.
[25:48.000 --> 25:58.000]  They're pushing for an authoritarian benchmark now, basically worldwide tyranny that we've never before seen in communist China as a model as you and others have been warning.
[25:58.000 --> 26:16.000]  What I'm told is that in the White House right now, President Trump has an intention, a desire, a plan to announce as early as tonight a 30-day ban on interstate travel that members of his legal counsel's office are attempting to persuade the president
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  that such an order is unlawful and would be a mistake.
[26:19.000 --> 26:30.000]  So remember, the very same globalist deep staters that said no borders, no walls, no Europe, no USA at all, that tell people to come from all over the world to get free stuff.
[26:30.000 --> 26:39.000]  The same ones that rammed down the Guatemalan borders and tore down their fences and attacked their military and the Mexican troops and overwhelmed our border.
[26:39.000 --> 26:52.000]  And the same ones that have invaded by the coast with George Soros and the UN funding it, with millions of military aged men bringing in the most deadly diseases and the most deadly culture of sex slavery, you name it.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  All of that was good. All of that was okay.
[26:54.000 --> 27:13.000]  But now a virus that hasn't even killed as many people worldwide as the flu kills here every year, we're told to capitulate and give up our way of life and stick our heads in the sand and make the new American symbol an ostrich.
[27:13.000 --> 27:29.000]  And that's really what I'm getting at here is that I don't like watching my fellow Americans hysterical and fear. I'm not saying it's bad to quarantine yourself if you've got a farmer or rancher, you know, a gated community or whatever.
[27:29.000 --> 27:38.000]  I'm not saying that I'm blaming people who think this is really bad. Their projections may be true.
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  Folks like Mike Adams has made a lot of great points.
[27:42.000 --> 28:06.000]  It's the synthetic nature and the choreographed nature of the global corporate media, all the globalist countries, socialist and communist countries, and Hollywood, all in a concerted effort with leftist mayors and others setting the precedent that China is the model of how we deal with this.
[28:06.000 --> 28:15.000]  And so they're just tightening the noose. More restrictions, more restrictions and oh look at death.
[28:15.000 --> 28:25.000]  And the crematorium in this Italian city can't even deal with all the dead and you learn it can burn two bodies a day.
[28:25.000 --> 28:41.000]  In a whole city, we've got five dead a day in the city. We can't burn them. I mean, the United States killed 100,000 people, most of them children in one night dropping firebombs on Dresden.
[28:41.000 --> 28:56.000]  We killed over 2 million Japanese in one day with over a thousand bombers dropping firebombs on Japan, more than Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Millions dead one day. And the Japanese were ready to fight on even after that.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  But we're just like, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[28:59.000 --> 29:12.000]  And healthy, not high with 100% pure CBD, powerful natural pain relief from veterans vitality. GCN listeners, have you ever thought about how CBD may help you? I'm sure you have heard about the many benefits of CBD.

[29:44.000 --> 30:12.000]  We've all watched with disgust and anger as companies across the United States and the world raise prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[30:12.000 --> 30:31.000]  We have kept all the products that we have in stock massively discounted 20 to 50%. The average discount is 40% right now on our best selling items.

[30:43.000 --> 30:53.000]  It is so important for everybody to do their own research and to protect themselves and their families with the knowledge that God has given us.
[30:53.000 --> 31:00.000]  Be sure and visit infowarstore.com today and take advantage of these items while we still have them in stock.
[31:00.000 --> 31:11.000]  It's all over the news. It's being announced by politicians from Germany and the United States. Thank God coronavirus is here. Thank God it's gonna kill the old people.
[31:11.000 --> 31:32.000]  Think the heavens that we're gonna depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible. Humanity is evil. All the Hollywood movies, all the propaganda, all the U.N. statements, all the Ted Turner and Prince Philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus to depopulate and control the population.
[31:32.000 --> 31:52.000]  And now it's here and they want to lock down society and are licking their lips and saying Trump isn't doing enough. What a sickening, in-your-face declaration of war against humanity by these control freaks who think it's their right to put fluoride in the water, give us toxic vaccines, openly dumb us down.
[31:52.000 --> 32:00.000]  And then when we resist, call us terrorists and conspiracy theorists when they're publicly admitting their plan to exterminate everyone. It's time to expose these scum.
[32:00.000 --> 32:15.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with the public service announcement. Info wars as of today is now suspending storable food sales. We still have storable food. We're able to package all the storable food and get it to everybody that ordered it.
[32:15.000 --> 32:25.000]  Most of you have already gotten your food. But the reason I'm making this announcement is all the other major food suppliers were sold out over a month ago as we first reported to you.
[32:25.000 --> 32:37.000]  But they lied to you and they took your money. Well, we know for a fact they're still taking everybody's money. Even though the food has all been sold out, the basic ingredients for storable food is gone.
[32:37.000 --> 32:47.000]  All the big box stores are paying way over normal prices to buy up what's left. And so anybody telling you that they have storable food is lying to you.
[32:47.000 --> 33:00.000]  The good news is everyone that ordered an info or store.com has already gotten it. Or if you ordered recently, we have the food is being packaged and you will get it. But as of now, we are suspending all new food sales and info or store.com.
[33:17.000 --> 33:31.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:31.000 --> 33:53.000]  Well, we called it from the beginning. Decades ago, I said they're going to establish a world government and use controlled bioweapon attacks to create lockdown, digital ID, microchip, forced inoculation scenarios, complete with drones flying overhead, barking orders.
[33:53.000 --> 34:05.000]  And now it's all being announced in communist China. The model laboratory of the globalist is now the laboratory example for the entire planet.
[34:05.000 --> 34:24.000]  Look at these headlines. Toll free number to join us on the martial law take down with the West on how Trump was painted into a corner that if he didn't engage in a similar monkey see monkey do behavior, they would say that every death was his fault.
[34:24.000 --> 34:43.000]  Trump has said, well, he'll use this to get full control of the government and reverse what's happening. Well, hopefully that's what happens. And I have seen the Google search engine suddenly. When you type in Alex Jones or info wars or vaccine, you get all the original top results from three years ago before they broke their search engine.
[34:43.000 --> 35:01.000]  YouTube is still rigged in the search results that hasn't been fixed yet. So that gives some credence to the fact that Trump will use this behind the scenes to brush aside the globalists and the courts that have been blocking but it's all still a very, very dangerous scenario.
[35:01.000 --> 35:13.000]  But info wars didn't start predicting this seven, eight weeks ago when they started, we laid out the exact blueprint of how they would unfold the system and how they would execute this operation.
[35:13.000 --> 35:32.000]  And you're now witnessing it and you're seeing the domesticated politically correct population that loves the virtue signal, gleefully playing along with shutting down tiny seaside resorts, you know, that have a few condos in them or a few beach houses.
[35:32.000 --> 35:46.000]  You know, tell those you can't come visit, you know, your grandma and the old folks home and you can tell a commute now. This has been the globalist model to end the carbon footprint and make us have to have a authorization by our smartphone to leave our houses.
[35:46.000 --> 35:55.000]  That's now being proposed for the United States and don't worry, the phone companies already have it all set up and they have an app for that. Just so happen, they got made.
[35:55.000 --> 36:05.000]  And Bill and Melinda Gates had their disease X saying millions would die. They had their tabletop exercise. They had all their movies and TV shows ready and it all got rolled out right on time.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  So let's go through some of these headlines.
[36:07.000 --> 36:16.000]  COVID-19 tracking bracelets and invisible tattoos to monitor Americans. Yes, a digital injected tattoo. Mark of the Beast.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  David Knight's coming up next segment on that subject.
[36:18.000 --> 36:28.000]  Coronavirus pandemic could continue for two years. German Health Minister warns dire new report forces US UK to change course on coronavirus strategy.
[36:28.000 --> 36:35.000]  Now you'll be going to be locked up for 18 months. Oh, that's going to cause a depression within a month of this crap.
[36:35.000 --> 36:45.000]  But that's okay. Now the depression isn't the bankers fault or the politicians. It's all the virus. So now they can really screw you over.
[36:45.000 --> 36:56.000]  Hope you all enjoy the fun of not being at work right now. Hope you all enjoy the wicked flea when done pursue because soon it will cause a great depression.
[36:56.000 --> 37:07.000]  And you're going to be in the food lines at the government offices and you're going to learn to worship the state and you're going to wear your bracelets and you're going to take your force inoculations and you're going to get your digital tattoos
[37:07.000 --> 37:16.000]  and they're going to take your farms and they're going to take your ranches and they're going to put communal work brigades on them because we're all about to get corporate fascism.
[37:16.000 --> 37:26.000]  Europe's announcing they're nationalizing everything. That's called fascism. Hope you all enjoy it. They're going to take your guns.
[37:26.000 --> 37:35.000]  They're going to take your children. They're going to take everything from you because you're passing the test to be jellyfish in flying colors.
[37:35.000 --> 37:45.000]  Hip hip hooray. Hip hip hooray. The world thought it would come back from the New World Order. Not so fast. They had the bio weapon attack always ready.
[37:45.000 --> 37:53.000]  The psychological warfare attack. New York Times. Donald Trump closes southern border to mitigate asylum seekers.
[37:53.000 --> 38:00.000]  They closed down the Canadian border but not before tens of thousands made it across the border.
[38:00.000 --> 38:09.000]  New Border Patrol chief refuses to cooperate with sanctuary cities is now picking up people that have committed crimes themselves.
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.000]  We're going to play this video coming up here in just a moment.
[38:14.000 --> 38:23.000]  Trump defends calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus but that's not really the headline. The story is up on info wars.com.
[38:23.000 --> 38:33.000]  The headline is he says China has blamed the U.S. military for this which they've officially done saying that America and Trump launched a bio attack.
[38:33.000 --> 38:45.000]  That's on their national news. Their health minister. Their main health minister saying that. Oh, we said the chai comms launched it seven weeks ago and we were attacked in the national news.
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  Even though we had the intel and knew that Obama and the globalist transferred it to him five years ago and now they released it.
[38:53.000 --> 39:08.000]  And it is a scary virus. I wouldn't be scared of the death rate unless you're really old on average. But it reinfects. It reinfects. It reinfects.
[39:08.000 --> 39:16.000]  Continuing. What's the country going to look like if millions of Americans start dying from the coronavirus with only a couple hundred dying?
[39:16.000 --> 39:22.000]  What is it? What is it? 15,000 worldwide? What's the global death toll right now? Can we put the big map up on screen?
[39:22.000 --> 39:27.000]  Imagine if millions do die. My God.
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  Oh, look, one person that isn't too old sick so they're a big national news story. There's all these young people sick.
[39:33.000 --> 39:41.000]  It wouldn't be a story. New Jersey coronavirus patient is getting worse despite being in good health before infection.
[39:41.000 --> 39:50.000]  But he's Asian. It's race specific. Philly police to lay arrest of car thieves, robbers and more over coronavirus risk.
[39:50.000 --> 39:59.000]  Oh, yes, the crime rates exploding. Isn't that just darling? LA releases hundreds of inmates, illegal aliens from jail to combat coronavirus.
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.000]  Yeah, people are going to die. Actress dismisses coronavirus threat, celebrates the population.
[40:05.000 --> 40:12.000]  China says the virus isn't a problem for them now. They're 100% back to work if you believe that.
[40:12.000 --> 40:20.000]  And major cities announced shelter in place. China purges major U.S. media outlets from country amid coronavirus information war.
[40:20.000 --> 40:27.000]  Pompeo calls on China to reconsider plan to rescind press credentials of U.S. correspondence.
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  Online searches for unemployment benefits soar at your virus crashes gig economy.
[40:32.000 --> 40:44.000]  Amazon suspends all shipments other than medical supplies, household staples, even though they were already collapsing and could not even get the orders out at the level people were ordering it.
[40:44.000 --> 41:01.000]  White House promises big bucks to airlines and Americans will get a check to $2,000 war on China. And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  That's just some of the news we're going to be covering.
[41:04.000 --> 41:15.000]  Total confirmed, 207,000 worldwide. Total deaths, 8,248. 82,000 recovered.
[41:15.000 --> 41:24.000]  So if you divide 8 by 82, well, you've got a 10% death rate right there, don't you?
[41:24.000 --> 41:30.000]  But that's not what it is because most people don't even know they have it. But wait till all the test kits get out.
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  Until then, the hysteria begins. And that's why Trump's been holding back.
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  Why should you know you have the virus if it didn't do anything to you?
[41:38.000 --> 41:47.000]  Because it's meant as a psych weapon to paralyze everything. So Trump has been balancing what he does very wisely.
[41:47.000 --> 41:54.000]  All right, we're going to go to break. I'm going to get David Knight in here, but we're going to come out of break with President Trump.
[41:54.000 --> 42:03.000]  Talking about the fact that it's China blaming us for launching this when it came out of Wuhan.
[42:03.000 --> 42:10.000]  And they're the ones that bought it from Obama. And we exposed this, the globalists came back down.
[42:10.000 --> 42:18.000]  But everyone groveling and capitulating and getting in a fetal position and pissing on themselves and just loving it and getting into it.
[42:18.000 --> 42:24.000]  You are signaling to the New World Order to release other versions they've got ready that will actually kill a bunch of people.
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  Because they want you sheltering in place when those drones fly over from the Umbrella Corporation.
[42:30.000 --> 42:39.000]  That's a real corporation. And spray it on you. You're going to be in your houses and they're going to just target and just lovingly fly over.
[42:39.000 --> 42:46.000]  Yeah, that's the type of scenarios we're facing. This is all a test. Can they lock you down so you'll behave yourself while they kill you?
[42:46.000 --> 42:52.000]  By the way, I didn't just say that now. I've been saying it for 20 plus years. You are now seeing everything I told you.
[42:52.000 --> 42:59.000]  The martial law, all of it come true. And thanks for your support. We're still standing at this critical time. Praise Jesus.

[45:17.000 --> 45:20.000]  It's a little bit of alcohol, maybe one or two essential oils.
[45:20.000 --> 45:28.000]  Not our lung cleanse. It's got a long list of the highest quality essential oils and ingredients in it.
[45:28.000 --> 45:39.000]  You take a few sprays in your mouth, lightly inhale, and it just does so much for me when I've got allergies or when my throat is tired.

[46:42.000 --> 46:51.000]  Others are going to be running out as well in the next month and we're not sure if we'll ever be able to get them again in the foreseeable future.
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  That's how crazy all of this is.
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  So stock up on the supplements that you and your family need and fund the InfoWar.
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.000]  Take action now.
[47:02.000 --> 47:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:11.000 --> 47:27.000]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[47:27.000 --> 47:34.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[47:34.000 --> 47:41.000]  Well, David Knight has a really popular show with the brain bugs.
[47:41.000 --> 47:48.000]  That's a term I use from Starship Troopers, you know, where you've got the kind of the upper cast of the engineers and scientists because he knows what he's talking about.
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  He researches.
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.000]  I'd say two minutes for every minute of airtime.
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  No one else does that.
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.000]  It's ridiculous.
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.000]  So he's definitely not flying by the seat of his pants.
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  I've taken a ton of information.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  I do a gestalt of it, but I do fly by the seat of my pants quite a bit.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  You know, the deepest thing I ever did was become shallow.
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  Like Trump said, that's the deepest thing you can do.
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  But David Knight has a lot of contacts out there with engineers at MIT.
[48:12.000 --> 48:13.000]  You name it.
[48:13.000 --> 48:20.000]  They sent him some big, exclusive stuff that I then searched and found open source that they indeed are developing little pieces of it confirming it.
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.000]  A digital tattoo under the skin to be able to travel a little bit on the gates.
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  All this has been set up.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  I told you last week, China is using cell phones to track everybody.
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  I said they'll announce that here in about a month.
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  Well, they announced it today.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  So this is a takeover.
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  This is a giant drill.
[48:38.000 --> 48:47.000]  It doesn't mean that the virus doesn't actually hurt people, but the hype and the unification of the propaganda.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  That's what really shows me what's going on.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  So David, you've got a lot to cover into the next hour with us.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  Lay out some of the big things you're going to break down.
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  Well, Alex, as I said today, I think if you look at the overall picture.
[48:59.000 --> 49:11.000]  What I see happening here is, you know, we see these different elements from the globalist plans, all these different, you know, universal basic income, the smart cities, agenda and so forth.
[49:11.000 --> 49:23.000]  But when we look at where this is all headed, I think that what we see now being imposed on people is really not so much a Marxist revolution as it is a Maoist revolution.
[49:23.000 --> 49:31.000]  Remember, it was Mao who told everybody at one point, you're going to get out of the cities, you're going to go out into the fields and you're going to grow food and they all starved.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  50 to 80 million people starved.
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.000]  But it was a cultural revolution and that's what we're undergoing right now.
[49:37.000 --> 49:45.000]  And by the way, you're not just saying that by analyzing it at the universities and in the government and with David Rockefeller and others, they said Mao is the model for the planet.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  That's right.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  That's right.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  There's New York Times articles in the 70s saying that.
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.000]  And we had for the last week, we've got Reuters and all these other publications are saying, look at what China did.
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  They did a great job in terms of locking everything down very quickly.
[49:58.000 --> 50:06.000]  And of course, that's what the simulations every year are telling them to do whenever there's an upright, well, with a bio warfare.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  They have these biological.
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.000]  But it's the perfect cover to shut down a population whenever you want to train everyone like dogs to run in fear at the mention of a virus.
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  That's right.
[50:14.000 --> 50:23.000]  And it was Obama who by executive order gave the CDC the permission to invoke quarantines and shutdowns and so forth that they don't have under the Constitution.
[50:23.000 --> 50:33.000]  But the other thing, Alex, that I found really very concerning is what my source sent me that picture that is in the article that Kelley McBrain did.
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  Drudge picked it up.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  COVID-19 tracking bracelets and invisible tattoos.
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  So what you do is you get tested on a daily basis.
[50:40.000 --> 50:46.000]  If you test clean, they would give you this little, you know, tape, a temporary tape thing for one day travel.
[50:46.000 --> 50:51.000]  They'll be color coded so that you can't travel more than that one day.
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  And Alex, this is a gradual boiling of the frogs that we've seen.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  We've been talking about this for a long time.
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  And now it's reached the boil.
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.000]  Look at TSA.
[51:00.000 --> 51:05.000]  They're getting you accustomed to permission in order to travel, getting you accustomed to having them touch you and so forth.
[51:05.000 --> 51:10.000]  And now this is rolling it out to the next step because it wasn't the airport security administration. It was transportation.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  And that's what they're doing.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  And that's why they're on trains and buses, all data testing.
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  And now they've got the fire departments and the police all under them in this hysteria under unified control.
[51:18.000 --> 51:19.000]  That's right.
[51:19.000 --> 51:28.000]  And in the last year, look at the number of times that we've seen mandated vaccines pushed on people even though there is massive grassroots uprising.
[51:28.000 --> 51:40.000]  We just had in Connecticut, the state legislators, the president pro tem of the Senate and the majority leader both came out and accused these people who were families showing up with their kids and saying,
[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  we don't want to have forced vaccines.
[51:41.000 --> 51:42.000]  They said, look at this.
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  Where are they getting their money?
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  Are they being funded by foreign government like Russia?
[51:46.000 --> 51:47.000]  They accuse these people.
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  They said, they show up here by now.
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  They're even saying families that have a brain damage son, in most cases.
[51:52.000 --> 52:00.000]  That's a thinner blood brain barrier in males and females. Females are tougher, folks, physically, not at lifting weights, but sustaining gunshots.
[52:00.000 --> 52:01.000]  You name it, poisons.
[52:01.000 --> 52:02.000]  Any doctor will tell you that.
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  The blood brain barrier is twice as strong.
[52:04.000 --> 52:09.000]  80 plus percent of autism's boys, they're there with their hurt little boy and they're a Russian agent now.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  Yeah.
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.000]  And you bring up the blood brain barrier.
[52:11.000 --> 52:21.000]  Of course, go back and look at the research of Alan Fry, who is the person who's probably researched a microwave effects, biological effects of microwaves more than anybody else.
[52:21.000 --> 52:30.000]  And he showed that if you expose humans and rats and other models, if you expose them to microwave radiation, it breaks down the blood brain barrier.
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  He basically just injected a dye.
[52:32.000 --> 52:39.000]  And so 5G, all of it, does scientifically lower your immunity and allow these particles and things to get through?
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  That's right.
[52:40.000 --> 52:49.000]  Viruses, bacteria, toxins, all those pass through the blood brain barrier when you irradiate the subjects with microwave radiation.
[52:49.000 --> 52:57.000]  And of course, as we've seen in some of these early tests, we know that males are more affected by 5G and other types of microwave radiation than females.
[52:57.000 --> 53:01.000]  Because again, as you point out, you know, the blood brain barrier is more quickly affected with that.
[53:01.000 --> 53:09.000]  But Alex, as we're looking at this and you look at the, again, psychological condition is a cultural revolution as much as it is a technological revolution.
[53:09.000 --> 53:16.000]  When they establish the idea that they're going to put a daily, after a daily test, they put this band on you.
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.000]  Then the next thing is, as we see from Axios and New York Times.
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  18 months.
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  Yeah, yeah, they're saying, oh, 18 months.
[53:24.000 --> 53:25.000]  You got to lock everybody down.
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  You can't just do selective quarantining of sick individuals.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  You got to lock everybody down for 18 months.
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  And because that's how long it's going to take us to get the vaccines.
[53:33.000 --> 53:39.000]  Well, they're going to let you out so that you can go back to school, go back to work so that you can travel if you've got your vaccine.
[53:39.000 --> 53:47.000]  And then bingo in December, we had this thing released, a scientific paper talking about Bill Gates's 65 million combination.
[53:47.000 --> 53:53.000]  Yeah, combination of vaccine and tattoo all in one so they can shoot you and then verify that.
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  And of course, you won't have to see it.
[53:55.000 --> 53:59.000]  That's the thing that this is an incredibly obvious rollout.
[53:59.000 --> 54:00.000]  He then finances them.
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  The show pandemic on Netflix.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  I turn on TV now.
[54:03.000 --> 54:08.000]  They already had these new shows already produced that probably a year about pandemics and into the world.
[54:08.000 --> 54:14.000]  On every channel, it's just like race war stuff that they ran trying to cause a race war.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  You see the synthetic nature.
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.000]  That's right.
[54:17.000 --> 54:22.000]  And if you look at their ID 2020, oh, wow, they're going to have the ID by 2020.
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  Aren't they?
[54:23.000 --> 54:28.000]  And they're saying it's a shame that we've got over a billion people worldwide that don't have a digital idea.
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.000]  Well, if you look at the Georgia Guidestones, they say we want to begin depopulation by 2020.
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  Yeah.
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  Oh, yeah.
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  And here it is, folks, and people are just like, oh, save me.
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  I'll go hide in my house.
[54:40.000 --> 54:47.000]  Folks, they want to train you to sit there and die in your house and not riot and not attack their facilities when they do this.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  And the police and the military, everybody else better know this.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  Yeah.
[54:51.000 --> 54:58.000]  And you've got basically by fiat within a day, they have mandated a greater depression.
[54:58.000 --> 55:03.000]  They not only punctured the financial markets, but basically just literally shutting down businesses.
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.000]  Alex yesterday was anniversary for my wife and our first date.
[55:07.000 --> 55:16.000]  And we got in just under the wire to go to a restaurant at noon because the mayor here said at 11 o'clock, we're going to shut down all the restaurants at noon.
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  And the waitress who waited on it said, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[55:19.000 --> 55:20.000]  I mean, we're the only.
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  Oh, it's worse than that.
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.000]  It's worse than that.
[55:22.000 --> 55:25.000]  It's all over the news now that landlords are saying screw you.
[55:25.000 --> 55:26.000]  You got to pay.
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.000]  Yeah.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  So this is the purposeful destruction of America's confidence.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  Trump tried to oppose it up front.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  I said, hey, you better at least do something.
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.000]  They'll blame you.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  But now it's almost like bad that we did that.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  He certainly listened.
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.000]  We're going to go to break and come back.
[55:40.000 --> 55:47.000]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 first time callers or first responders.
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  I'd love to hear from you.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  877-789-2539 877-789-2539.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  Let me make this announcement.
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  We've got our warehouse here in Austin and everything we sell is stocked and ready to ship to you.
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.000]  We're about a day behind.
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.000]  So you order today, you will be shipping to you on Friday.
[56:03.000 --> 56:09.000]  But I'm just going to tell you, with what I've been told and what I've learned from executives that are big companies,
[56:09.000 --> 56:16.000]  they're being told that if we accept the continued lockdown, they're going to go to total lockdown soon and just see what happens.
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  This is insane.
[56:18.000 --> 56:24.000]  And I hope Trump realizes he's being set up with an over-response, an under-response is bad and over-response is bad as well.
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  We've got to be balanced about this.
[56:26.000 --> 56:34.000]  So infowarstore.com, get the boost you and your family need with living defense now back in stock sold out for four months.
[56:34.000 --> 56:39.000]  And the krill oil now back in stock in the X2 and the X3 and the super silver toothpaste is sold out.
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  Super blue has the same amount of nano silver in it.
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  It has tea tree oil that's so good for so many things.
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  Look into that.
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  And we've got the ultimate turmeric formula bodies back in stock.
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.000]  We've got the one ounce of immune gargles sold out for a month.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  It's back in stock and it's 20% off.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  We're about to sell out of the 16 ounce.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  I don't know when we're going to be getting that back in.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  That is going to sell out any day now.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  But a lot of stuff is selling out.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  A lot of stuff is coming in.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  But we're talking to our supply chain.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  They're saying we don't know.
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  Just like I told you a month ago, they may suspend food sales.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  We suspended food sales yesterday.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  Everybody else has sold out their line.
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  They're taking your money.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  It's criminal.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  I don't know how you take somebody's money and don't have food to ship them.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  The food you order, most of you got it.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  The others, it's coming.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  But they're worried about the future.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  So we made the decision we're not selling food anymore, okay?
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  Because we can't guarantee new orders you're going to get it.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  Same thing with supplements.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  We have the supplements now.
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  We have the products now.
[57:33.000 --> 57:34.000]  We have them in stock ready to ship.
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  You better get your orders in because these type of products
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  in a crisis like this are the most important thing out there
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  other than the relationship with God and guns
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  and ammo and food willing to fight.
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  Get your supplements now at infowarstore.com.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  Do not wait.
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  The winds have changed.
[57:51.000 --> 57:54.000]  The waves of change are here.
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.000]  The world has become decadent.
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.000]  The population has become hypnotized.
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.000]  And the globalists are moving in for the kill.
[58:04.000 --> 58:11.000]  First, they make us stupid and dumb down and put us into a trance.
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  And once they've done that, once they've made us obsolete,
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  they begin to release the bio weapons.
[58:17.000 --> 58:22.000]  Each more deadly than last as they hurt us into the bubble.
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.000]  High-tech control grid cities until they finally release
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  the ultimate bio weapon with a 100% kill rate,
[58:30.000 --> 58:35.000]  which then mutates into a harmless bug after a few years.
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.000]  And the controllers emerge from their underground bunkers.
[58:39.000 --> 58:43.000]  And of course they have the cure to all the diseases they release as well.
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.000]  They admit it.
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.000]  They publicly talk about their plan to kill us all.
[58:46.000 --> 58:48.000]  A lot of liberals are celebrating this.
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  So remember who your enemies are.
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  Info Wars has had to suspend all new food sales
[58:54.000 --> 58:57.000]  because the supply chain has collapsed.
[58:57.000 --> 59:00.000]  This is a system-wide problem.
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  And this country is facing a new depression
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.000]  unless Trump and the American people work together
[59:06.000 --> 59:10.000]  to develop a plan to expose this globalist operation.
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.000]  That's it.
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  People are calling and saying,
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  we wish you had the supplements in stock.
[59:16.000 --> 59:17.000]  We wish that wasn't sold out.
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  They've confused that with the food.
[59:19.000 --> 59:23.000]  Everything we advertise, everything we sell,
[59:23.000 --> 59:28.000]  we have in stock and we are only one day behind in shipping.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  That means if you order on a Monday,
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  it's shipping out on a Wednesday.
[59:32.000 --> 59:33.000]  And that's just as of today.
[59:33.000 --> 59:36.000]  Most days we are up to the day shipping,
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  meaning you order that day in the morning.
[59:38.000 --> 59:41.000]  A lot of times it ships out that afternoon.
[59:41.000 --> 59:44.000]  We have everything in stock
[59:44.000 --> 59:48.000]  that is so good to boost your overall defense
[59:48.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  against what's going on.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  David Knight has some really good news
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  out of Italy dealing with the coronavirus.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  We'll be covering it at the start of the next segment.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  And we'll also take some calls
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  and we're going to get into this billable and the gay situation.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  But obviously this is going to cause a recession,
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  may cause a depression.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  The White House now admits that.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  How do you quantify this?
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  What this is?
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  I see it as a globalist attack on the nation state,
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  and it's going to close control.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  I believe it's going to backfire.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  And now you'll see a giant movement against globalism,
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  even more people moving to the country,
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  people becoming self-sufficient.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  I think that they really jumped the shark.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Well, it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  But right now a lot of people are in a lot of problems.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  And like I said, that Waitress looked at me.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  I mean, she was about ready to cry.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Start the story over.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  You're out with your wife right before they close this.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Yeah, the mayor here in Austin decided that
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  he'd shut all the restaurants.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  It gave them one hour's notice.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  So yesterday at 11 o'clock,
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  so we're going to close all the restaurants at noon.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  My wife got there before they did it.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  But by the time I got there,
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  they were turning everybody away,
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  but she was already there.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  So they let us in.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  We were about the only ones eating at that point in time.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  And the waitress said,
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  well, now I'm out of a job.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  I don't know what I'm going to do.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  I can't pay my rent.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  I don't know how I'm going to eat.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  And that's just like that.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  By fiat, they've imposed Venezuela.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  And we look at the unemployment rates,
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  and I went down the rates going from 1929
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  to 1947.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  I just read them off to you
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  what the rates were this morning when I talked about it.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  And you look at 1929,
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  before the stock market crashed,
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  they were down at 3% unemployment.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  And then it goes up pretty quickly.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  The next year, it's like 9%,
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  and then it jumps up to 15,
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  then to 20, then to 25%.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  They're artificially creating the atmosphere
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  for a Great Depression.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  That's right.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  And they're doing it instantly.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  It took like three or four years
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  for that to happen with the Great Depression.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  They're imposing this instantly
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  because we've already had a poll show
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  that 18% of the people said
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  they've already lost their job.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  I'm hearing from people who have a service business,
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  where they go into somebody's home
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  and they do some work in the home.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  People aren't calling them
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  because they're afraid for anybody to come to their house.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  And then you have all the small companies,
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  like the restaurants and bars and so forth,
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  which is a lot of small independent companies.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  They're being shut down by mandates.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Meanwhile, the House and all of the Republicans,
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  except for 40 members in the House,
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  signed this crony capitalist bill
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  that says if you've got fewer than 500 employees,
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  you're going to have to pay for sick leave
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  and all these other benefits,
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  even though they're shutting them down.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  They're keeping the big box stores open
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  and they're exempting them from any of these regulations
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  that they're putting on the small people.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  This is Alex, a power grab by big corporations.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  And if you look at the peak unemployment
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  during the Great Depression,
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  it was 25% already where it 18% to 20%.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  You've got Mnuchin out there saying,
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  well, it may get as high as 20%.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  Come on, it's going to get higher than 50%.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  If you don't stop this, you're shutting everything down.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  This is going to be much worse than the Great Depression.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Exactly. And there's argument.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Well, if we totally locked things down,
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  we might save somebody with an unproven number.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  And we'll cover that.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  When we come back, I want you to lay,
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  you've got the numbers.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Lay out the fact that Trump is being tricked
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  into implementing a Great Depression.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  The new Great Depression is here if Trump doesn't act now.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  That's the headline for the next segment.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  I want you to recap all of this
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  because you're on fire right now, David.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  And that's what I've always told you is you've got,
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  I offered to hire you a writer or two,
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  whatever you wanted, just to take the things you do
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  and then write about what you said and have your quotes.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  You finally got somebody to do that
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  and it's on drudgerport.com.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  I mean, you just break incredible stuff constantly
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  and I get pissed to have like a stark order back here.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  But then you're not letting me get you some, you know,
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  some blockers.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  So we just, you're doing a great job.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  So when we come back, let's go into these numbers
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  and then let's look at the rest of the story
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  and we'll take your phone calls and milliweavers
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  popping in with us as well.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  She's just amazing with all of her sources
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  that have just continued to totally blow me away.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  So that's all coming up.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  I'm going to tell listeners this just point blank range.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  I already mortgaged my house before this crisis hit
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  to pay the bills, keep this place going
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  with full staff in the next year.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  All this crazyness started and some money came in
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  that helped us be on a better footing.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  We're still not out of the woods,
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  but we're in a much better position.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  So when I tell you this, it's just like I told you
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  with the food, they're going to end up having to stop
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  cease taking orders.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  That happened yesterday.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  We have all the supplements now,
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  but we're talking to suppliers
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  and you see everybody going home,
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  it's shutting down.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  It's shutting down.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  You better get your supplements
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  to boost your living defense and your body
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  now at InfoWarStore.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  InfoWarStore has most of our high quality supplements
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  in stock in our warehouse,
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  ready to ship to you within days of your order.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  Don't go to the stores and battle zombies over toilet paper
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  and things that don't matter.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  Get things that you and your family need.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  I'll tell you how I'm boosting my defense.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  DNA Force Plus is incredible with PQQ, CoQ10.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Look into that for yourself.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  And we have all the high quality silver products as well
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  in stock, but for a limited time.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  And then we've got the ultimate turmeric formula,
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  bodies, look into what that does with 95% curcuminoid
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  and the list goes on and on.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  Vaso beats back in stock.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  Oh, and by the way, we haven't raised prices to retail
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  during this crisis.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  We've kept it all at 40% off until it sells out.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  Check out all these best sellers
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  and prepare yourself and your family at infoworthstore.com.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  I've been on air 26 years.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  And I've been informed since I was knee-high to a grasshopper.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  I had no idea how informed I was.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  People I was around were totally dialed in at many levels.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  And we're patriots.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  And now here we are, the globalists,
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  they're playing all pre-programmed, all packaged,
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  all synthetic because they think you've got an ADIQ.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  They think you're not noticing.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  Like the Poles before World War II,
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  they said German troops are massing on the border.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  They've got airplanes flying over, marking targets.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  They're about to attack.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  They want your conspiracy theorist, Poland,
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  and then the Germans attacked.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  This is not rocket science, folks.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  The pre-programming by every leftist
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  and globalist institution was incredible.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  And Trump's original instinct to say,
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  it's a hoax was right.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Because, yeah, it kills some people,
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  but the response is the hoax.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  That's what he said.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  But then, I guess he listened to us, which he really does,
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  we were looking at the problem at the time,
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  and I think I overcompensated.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  I'm like, Trump, you've got to get out of this.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  You've got to say it's a serious threat,
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  or they're going to say it's your fault.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  He overcompensated.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  Then he kind of pulled back, and I'm not blaming him.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  This is really complex here, but I can tell you,
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  Trump's not behind this.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  America's not behind this.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  The deep state is.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  And we know who did it.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  We have documented it.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  Here is the president, though,
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  because they don't want this discussed.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  And I've said on air, and I'm not bragging,
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  it's just a fact, folks, people know it.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  People know this is a real oracle.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  My guest, all of us, this is the people's oracle.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  This is the town square.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  This is the knowledge.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  This isn't talking points handed down.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  This is one of the few places that does that.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  So the White House tunes in.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  I know who's tuning in right now.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  I want to say hi to the White House.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  And they get clips.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  He calls them the clips.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  They bring the president clips.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  And when they want the president to make a good decision,
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  they watch you.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  I can tell you, and I know Drudge is a fan of you.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  I know the president likes what you do, David.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  It's not about kissing David's ass.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  It's about recognizing info,
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  and our listeners that supported us,
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  we've done something special here
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  because there's not any other channel
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  at a level like this
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  with this quality of production doing this.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  So the president is listening.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  And I understand what he's up against.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  And I will say this,
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  if we have to let them bring in martial law
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  because they forced to his hand,
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  then I do hope the delusional cue stuff is true.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  And that Trump, in a judicious way,
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  just uses a state of emergency
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  to remove Obama's state of emergency
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  that he put in place that we detailed,
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  that they're still using to run Google, Facebook,
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  and Twitter behind the scenes
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  that are really government organs.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  And we're starting to see some of that at Google,
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  going back to its regular search algorithm.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  That's been confirmed now.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  So we're seeing some good signs during this crisis,
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  so it's not all negative.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  But to have the president come out
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  and say, China's blaming us, that's seismic,
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  because they don't want that discussion going on
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  because it goes back to the Chinese communists
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  and their globalist controllers.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  Here's the president last night.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  China and others have criticized you
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  for using the phrase, Chinese virus.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  How do you feel about that?
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  Are you going to continue using that phrase?
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Well, China was putting out information
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  which was false that our military gave this to them.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  That was false.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  And rather than having an argument,
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  I said, I have to call it where it came from.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  It did come from China.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  So I think it's a very accurate term.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  But no, I didn't appreciate the fact
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  that China was saying that our military gave it to them.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  Our military did not give it to anybody.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  We're pretty excited using that phrase,
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  create a stigma.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  No, I don't think so.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  No, I think saying that our military gave it to them
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  creates a stigma.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  We're just supposed to sit here, David,
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  while the globalists launch their bio attacks
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  and blame Trump when it came from China
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  and not say it's China.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  I want to get into your depression numbers next segment.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  I kind of diverted us into this right now.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  But I want listeners to know,
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  this is the most epic time of your life.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  This is the whole future.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  This is 9-11 squared.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  This is our way of life done forever,
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  borders wide open,
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  but you've got to get permission to leave your house, okay?
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  And criminals are going to run wild.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  The crime rate's already exploding.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  We are in the biggest crises of our life.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Hands down, folks.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  You're in it.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  We're in it right now.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  And the left's all over the news.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  They're calling up gun shops in other states
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  going to ship me that AK-47.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  They're like, there's videos of this.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  They're like, sure, we don't have AK-47s.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  We can't ship to another state.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  You have to come to a background check.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  The less like, I heard you just buy machine guns.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  Now suddenly the left wants guns.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  You got to know how to use them first, dumbasses.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  Well, if I could say something to President Trump,
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  I would say, look at this guy that you're relying on
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  for information.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  Anthony Fauci has been there since 1985.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Fauci and Francis Collins at the NIH,
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  he's the director.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  And then underneath him is Fauci for infectious diseases.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  Look, both of them were there under Obama during Ebola.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  During Ebola, they were telling people,
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  80% of the people who get Ebola are going to die.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  Now they're saying 80% of the people who get coronavirus
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  are going to have mild symptoms.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  They never call for this kind of drastic reaction.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Remember, Alex, we were covering that and we were saying,
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  what are they doing?
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  They're bringing people in.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Look at what's happening in Dallas.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  They let this guy in.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  And he gets sick.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  They take him to a hospital.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  Two nurses got infected.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  He's in Atlanta.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  Yeah, they have a local official.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  He goes into the apartment.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  He walks around.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  Then he goes to a,
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  he doesn't have any protective equipment.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  He doesn't walk around.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  But then I'm going to interrupt you
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  when you get into his people around.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Yeah.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  Fauci, every time Trump gets up and says,
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  it's okay, comes up and contradicts him in front of him.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  That's right.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  That's right.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  He's a bureaucrat.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  He's a bureaucrat pushing,
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  and he has been there for decades.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  They never did this with any of these previous pandemics
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  that were declared by the World Health Organization.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  This is the first time they're doing this.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  And again, the real core of the globalist cult
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  is scientists.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  That's right.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  And you're a scientist.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  You know this.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  The cult is run by them.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  Well, I played a clip today.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  The California governor comes up
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  and he's got a parade of people in white coats
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  that come out on the podium
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  and then stop and stand there
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  and they're white coats before he comes out.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  It's an argument from authority.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  It's like wearing a uniform.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  It's like what Vinman did when he testified
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  and he came in wearing his lieutenant.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  I'm a lieutenant colonel.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  These people are like, I'm a doctor.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  So shut up.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  And this is exactly what is happening.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  It's an argument from authority.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  It's what they've been doing with climate hysteria
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  and now they're doing it with corona hysteria.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  We'll hit the economy and come back.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  But again, people try to create a false debate
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  between myself and others like Dr. Boyle
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  who I really respect or Mike Adams who I respect
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  where they think it's really worst case scenario
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  because it is a bio weapon.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  You got to really worry what is it really going to do.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  We don't know about gain of function, all that
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  and the fact that it reinfects.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  The issue is not that.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  It's not a debate with them.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  They're great guys.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  The synthetic hype of the hysteria
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  and the end of the world crap and all that.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  Do you notice what they're not calling for shut down?
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  They're not calling for these bio weapon programs to shut down.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  They're not calling for the gain of function programs
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  to shut down.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  It was an outrage.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  Exactly.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  All the level four labs, you know,
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  and the secret ones that go above that,
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  don't worry about those that are plum island
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  where we got Lyme's disease.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  Right down the street.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  Mike Adams got really sick from that.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  One of my good friends almost died from it.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  They admitted it's a bio weapon
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  that a damn Nazi we iron cooked up.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  That's right.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Right down the street from where we were.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  It's syphilis delivered through ticks.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  In North Carolina, right down the street from where we were,
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  UNC Chapel Hill.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  That's where they were doing research on coronavirus
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  and bats and so forth.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  And we've talked about that.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  And sold it to the diagrams.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  Exactly.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  Well, in 2017, they came out with their research.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  It has supposedly been shut down in 2015.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  There was a lot of outrage in the scientific community.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  He said, what are you doing this for?
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  Yeah, guys, pull up the scientist article.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  And yet what happened was it was another two years.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  They said, well, you know, we're going to, first it was,
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  we're going to shut this down.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  And then they came out and released their research.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  They shut it down in 2014.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  They released their research in 2015.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  And then by 2017, they said, well, we've now made it legal again.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  And in the interim, you had Francis Collins,
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  who's now the director, still the director of the NIH,
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  saying, well, I authorized, we had a dozen of these.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  And I authorized half of them to continue.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  And one of them was at UNC Chapel Hill thing.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  Even though it was, by the way,
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  it's not a big deal or I could pull it up on my phone.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  You just type in scientific debate over transfer of
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  engineered coronavirus.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  There is lab-made coronavirus triggers debate.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  The scientists, Obama authorized it.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  Fauci was there.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  They transfer of almost the same virus to the chai comms.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  And people are like, what are you doing?
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  Why are you weaponizing it?
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  Oh, we're studying it.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  I mean, wow. And see, they don't want a discussion about this.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  That's right. That's right.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  They said, well, we have to have this
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  because we use that to make more vaccines.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  It's like, yeah, problem solution.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  And at the time, this was all coming up, Alex.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  There was all these reports,
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  especially one reporter who worked for USA Today, Allison Young,
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  that is serious.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  You remember we had the anthrax live, anthrax sent through the mail,
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  but there were a lot of other issues.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  Hundreds of these labs put in universities like UNC Chapel Hill
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  in addition to the biosafety level three and four labs,
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  you had the National Primate Center in Tulane.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  They had a very deadly bacteria.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  They're weaponizing there,
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  got out of that biosafety level three labs.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  The threat is the mad scientist community
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  cooking it up, selling it to everyone,
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  and now using it to power grab over civilization.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  Let's talk about the Great Depression
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  that is certain if Trump doesn't act now.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  We have the numbers.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  You have the numbers.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  We will be in a Great Depression within three months.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  If we don't avert this now, stay with us.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  We will be in a Great Depression within three months.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  You don't know me and will never meet.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  I had a problem like you once.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  before it totally destroyed me.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  and you know you can't do it alone,
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  to replace your old habits with new habits
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  and totally change your life.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance,
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  the entire program may be covered.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  Get clean.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  Call now and learn more.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  That's 800-506-6740.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  Listen to me very, very carefully.
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  I am involved at very high levels
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  with supply chain management
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  and talk to a lot of executives.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  And they are confirming to me
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  that the supply chain is starting to break down
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  because they're running out of the raw materials
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  for food and things like high-quality supplements
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  that boost you and your family's defense.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  you need to get your orders in now

[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  Many of them are about to sell out
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  in the next few days to the next few weeks.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Others are going to be running out as well
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  in the next month and we're not sure
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  if we'll ever be able to get them again
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  in the foreseeable future.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  That's how crazy all of this is.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  So stock up on the supplements that you and your family need
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  and fund the infowar.

[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  is our most valuable asset.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  It's what allows us to stay alive
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  on this amazing planet that God's given us.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  And we've got to take care of our bodies.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  We've got to take care of ourselves.

[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  and have been developed with some of the top experts
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  in the country to maximize
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  what God's given us through Mother Nature
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  to help our bodies boost their defense
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  against all the insane things
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  that have been artificially introduced
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  into our environment.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  So please visit infowarstore.com today
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  during all this hysteria and realize
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  it's not toilet paper or flashlights
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  that you really need.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Sure, it's okay to have plenty of that,
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  but it is high quality supplements
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  and we've got the best.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  And during this crisis,
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  I am discounting everything
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  at infowarstore.com
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  I said, hey, what's the point?
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  I said, okay, I'll give you a headline.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  This will be the headline on InfoWars, this live feed.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  America takes the chicken little bait.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  Will integrate depression.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Subheadline, China and globalist win.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  Land of the cowards and the home of the fools loses.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  No, but I mean, I don't say that with pleasure.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  The average American knows this is a hoax.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  They just don't know what to do
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  because they're picking us off one by one.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  That's how it works. So, so David Knight here with me
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  hosted a night show weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  Layout that we're going to have a great depression.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  If Trump doesn't get this, it doesn't act now.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  Well, let's put this in perspective, Alex,
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  because in 1929, when the, at the end of the roaring 20s,
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  when everything was cooking,
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  the economic growth rate or unemployment.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  Why don't you start over?
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  We had some technical issues.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  You started roaring 20s.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  Yeah. In 1929, they had 3% unemployment,
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  which is pretty good.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  That's pretty much full employment.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  And then after the stock market crashed,
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  the Great Depression began in 1930.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  It went up to about 9%.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  And then until you get well into World War II,
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  unemployment rates ran between 16, 17%
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  and peaked at 25% peak of 25%.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  Now, what has happened in this last week?
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  We've had a recent poll said that 18% of the people
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  said they've already lost their job.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  Is that a surprise?
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  We've got everybody afraid to call a repairman
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  to come to their house.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  And you've got mayors everywhere shutting down bars
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  and restaurants and any small business.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  The big businesses are going to be allowed to stay open.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  They're not going to have to pay any benefits
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  if they got more than 500 employees.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  But if you've got less than 500 employees,
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  small, medium enterprises are going to shut you down
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  and they're going to burden you with extra benefit.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  And that key, the big mega corporations,
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  they're essential infrastructure.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  They could stay open.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  But if you're a little gas line repair company
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  or you're a pool repair company
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  or you're an auto repair company,
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  oh, you've got to shut down.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  You're not essential.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  They're making, and don't worry,
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  there's going to be government loans and government money.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  They're making you go on welfare.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  Yeah, a big $1,000 check.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  That's going to make a whole lot of difference, right?
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  And so when we look at what happened with the Great Depression,
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  it peaks at 25% in it, but it's kicking around
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  between 17 and 21% for most of the Great Depression.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  Then when World War II begins,
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  it started to drop a little bit.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  By 1942, it was about 9% or so
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  as we began to get into the war ourselves
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  because it was the end of December, 1941,
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  that Pearl Harbor happened.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  And then as we're ramping everything up
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  and we've got everybody working, even Rosie the Riveter,
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  it comes down to 1%.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  And then as soon as the war ended in 1945,
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  it comes back up to that 3% level again.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  But folks, what we're looking at right now
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  is already an unemployment level
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  that is at or near the peak unemployment level
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  of the Great Depression.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  And we've gone from a boom economy
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  to great depression level unemployment figures
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  just by fiat, by mandate in a single week or two.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  And who knows how far this is going to go.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  So we're not going into 20%.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  We're not taking two years to get into depression.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  We're going right into one.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  So you looked at the numbers.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  How long?
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  I think a few months.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  They're even saying now, recession, depression.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  In a few months, they can't reverse this.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  What does Trump do that we're going to cause?
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  I don't know what Trump...
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  Well, what Trump needs to do is he needs to stop panicking.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  I did a report last week.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  I said, look, they're freaking everybody out.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  He needs to be like George Bailey at the savings.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  If you remember, it's a wonderful life.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  He needs to calm people down.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  And yes, the panicking is what will destroy you.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  Exactly.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  The virtue signaling getting all into it
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  is what's going to bring us down.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  If you look at the toilet paper...
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Because you watch, in two weeks, it'll be a couple thousand dead.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  And they'll go, oh, the lockdown's what did that.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  Trying to cover up the fact that they predicted
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  all these massive deaths.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  Well, the other thing about this is engineered
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  is the statistics in terms of how deadly the disease is.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  Talk about Italy.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  Then we're going to go to a caller who's quarantined,
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  Micah, New York.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  Well, you know, when you look at what happened in China, right,
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  they just last week on Friday,
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  they said we're going to start counting mild cases.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  They were not counting mild cases in the statistics.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  And so that means that they're only taking people
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  who are dying or who's severely ill.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  So if you only sample the very...
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  It's like going to a hospice and saying,
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  90% of the world's dying.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  No, those in hospice are.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  That's right.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  Oh, you don't get the math.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  And I always say, OK, well, show me the math
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  where we have the variable of people that never showed up.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  Well, they don't have that.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  If you're not counting but a tenth of the people,
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  that means that the disease is going to look 10 times more deadly.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  And it's just that simple.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  And they started counting that on Friday.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  Now, in Brazil, they're saying,
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  well, we're not going to count people who are mild cases.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  At the same time, they're saying 82% to 85% of the cases
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  are going to be mild.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  So they're not counting that.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  They're inflating the danger of that.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  We just got information out of Italy.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  This is John Rappapour's article.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  This is a publication coming out of Italy,
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  the Italian National Institute of Health.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  And they said there have only been two deaths
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  as of last Friday associated with coronavirus.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  And they didn't have any other underlying problems,
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  health problems in addition to that.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  They said the average age of people who died,
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  there was 80.3 years.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  And they said of those two people that they didn't know
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  if they had any other underlying conditions there
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  or advanced age, they said they still hadn't finished
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  their tests on those two people.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  And the bottom line is that if we go back
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  and we look at statistics, again, going back to 2007,
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  the last year that the CDC kept statistics
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  on people dying by decade.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  They would do 65 to 75, 75 to 85, and then over 85.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  They stopped it in 2007.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  I think it's probably because the baby boomers
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  are getting into that range.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  Nevertheless, if we go back and look at that,
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  we would expect that in a month,
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  you would see 146,000 people,
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  65 and over dying.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  We've had 100 people die, most of them elderly.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  Most of these deaths, when we had 40 deaths,
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  we're now at 100, we had 40 deaths.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  22 of those were from about one home in Seattle.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  Okay, the elderly care home.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  22 of the 40 deaths were from that one place.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  Very suspicious. David, stay right there.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  We got Millie, we were coming up.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  Now look at these callers.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  Don, virus local government, curfews,
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  business borders are wide open.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  Lamar, Mike Adams and Alan Shillings
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  are both correct.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  China, number one enemy.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  Mike in New York, callers under quarantine.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  We're going to MNAC's pending test results.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  Tim, company officer, we don't have numbers.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  Pandemic is killing.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  Michelle, the virus, the election 2025G connection,
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  which is documented.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Edgar, what's really happening?
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  The next plan, martial law vaccines.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  Matt in Nebraska, hospital forcing quarantines
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  on nurses, medical staff.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  Diego, California, the virus.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  Mike Adams is right. New World Order.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  William, Oregon.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  Pandemic will cause a new depression.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  Worse than actual, absolutely virus.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  Darrell, the shutdown, the masses,
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  order out of chaos, Chad, the virus,
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  the coming martial law.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Hell, it ain't coming, brother.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  When they're telling you businesses and restaurants
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  are shut down, it's a compendium.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  It's a trend.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  It's a, not a compendium.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  It's a chart like a rick or scale.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  It's a scale.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  And I'd say on a scale of one to 10,
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  we're like a six, man.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  You know, tanks of the streets are like a seven.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  People being shot in firing squads is a 10.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  I mean, this is not good.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  No, no.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  And what we have now, I was making fun of Romney
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  for embracing AOC's universal basic income of $1,000.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  Here's the $1,000.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  Is that going to really help you?
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  And now Trump's going to do it.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Now Trump's going to do it.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  They're getting all of their agenda pushed through here.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  They've been preparing you psychologically
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  with the climate hysteria and you didn't believe it,
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  but you keep hearing this, we're all going to die.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  And here's the men, the things that we have.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  Oh, and they're also saying it's good.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  We're dying.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  The left is celebrating it.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  Hope it hurts Trump.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  Hope it hurts Christians.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  Hope it hurts America.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  And then Trump hasn't done enough.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  So then he stampede and does more.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  I got to tell you, this is sophisticated,
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  ladies and gentlemen, because I saw one level.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Hey, they're going to set Trump up and didn't do enough.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  So like Trump do something, do something.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  And then he starts overreacting, kills the economy.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  We're going to take your phone calls.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  Millie Weaver's coming up.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  We got Dr. Francis Boyle coming on as well.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  But I got into these calls.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  These calls, these callers look amazing.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  David Knight.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  Keep writing shotgun, whether this is as well as you can.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  Sure.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  infowars.com is standing for truth.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  infowars.com.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  I can help you too.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  Don't wait another day.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  Call 834 no tax or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  the United States is the empire of the world.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  and II left England broken.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  Was there ever a vote?
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  Who do we fight for?
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  The deep state began with World War I,
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  the United States of Empire,
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  It was like a bad dream seven weeks ago.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  The ghost cities in China that then spread to Europe.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  And now San Francisco is a ghost city.
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  And we see fights and brawls taking place over toilet paper.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  People don't need toilet paper to survive,
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  but people do need high quality water filtration
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  and they need high quality supplementation
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  by products like DNA Force Plus, X2 and X3,
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  bodies, ultimic, turmeric formula,
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  and of course our high quality silver gargle products
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  and super silver toothpaste that has the nano silver tea tree oil
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  and of course iodine as well.

[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  as companies across the United States and the world
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  raise prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  InfoWars has done the opposite.
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  Despite the fact that we've sold out of many of our products
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  and are waiting for others to come back in,

[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  be as healthy as you can so we can all make it through this together.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  It is so important for everybody to do their own research
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  and to protect themselves and their families
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  with the knowledge that God has given us.

[1:31:54.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  and take advantage of these items while we still have them in stock.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  It's a beautiful world outside,
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  but inside the halls of government,
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  inside the corridors of the megacorporations
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  and tyrannical regimes like China
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  and the Communist Party that runs it,
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  there is a raw desire for power and control over people.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  And now we learn from an MIT tipster.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  We even got the documents and were able to search them
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  and then discovered that it was accurate information
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  actually in the public domain.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  The Bill and Melinda Gates are preparing an embedded digital tattoo
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  under your skin to show that you're not infected with coronavirus
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  so you can travel and buy and sell.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  The Mark of the Beast 666 is here.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  Well, we told you Trump would activate FEMA
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  in an actual emergency.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  He just activated a nationwide emergency
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  for the first time in decades.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  Every region at highest level, maximum alert,
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  a new info wars.com story.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  We have loaded phone lines.
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  We have Millie Weaver, we're getting on the line.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  We have David Knight riding shotgun.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  We have Francis Boyle, who's great.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  But I move back a little bit in the next hour to get to your calls.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  This is just moving so incredibly fast.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  Trump drivers press on to stop shortages amid coronavirus.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  Yeah, it's not those driverless cars saving us.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  Trump using racist rhetoric to distract from coronavirus response failure.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  They're trying to use that against Trump.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  It is incredible.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  They're going to leave him holding the bag once this greater depression kicks in.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  And it is going to be greater than 50% because that's what they've been talking about
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  for the longest time.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  That's why they wanted universal basic income.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  That's a depression.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  Yeah.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  You've got papers in the US, but especially South Korea,
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  they're saying, look, we're going to have 60 to 70% unemployment
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  for doctors and for lawyers, not blue collar workers.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  I mean, this is going through every strata.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  But don't worry, they'll have lots of microchips
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  and a new implantable tattoo that saves you.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  Incredible.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  It's all on info wars.com, folks.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  We beat this as you spread the links.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  It's now a total war.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  News wars.com, prison planet.com, band.video.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  Share those links.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  I want to go to Millie Weaver here in a moment.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  We've got to get a few of these calls in.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  Let's go to Mike in New York.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  Caller is under quarantine pending test results.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  Wow.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  Tell us what's going on, Mike.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  I'm going to go kind of, I'm going to be a little slow and a little soft.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  I'm having some lung problems in lately conversation.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  It really brings that out.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  So I've been in quarantine since Saturday.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  And getting a test result up here is you practically have to,
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  you practically have to beg in order to get a test.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  And what I was told from my local public health is that if you don't,
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  if you don't have a fever, then they're not going to test you.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  So basically you've got to be circling the drain
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  in order to even get a test around here.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  That's absolutely true.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  That's in the guidelines.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  You've got to have 101 plus.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  You've got to have trouble breathing.
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  You have to be able to speak for a minute, coughing with four times.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  Correct.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  So I believe that I have maybe, maybe a mutation of this because I,
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  I absolutely have no fever at all.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  I have none of the face congestion.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  I don't, don't have anything coming up.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  Oh, some people don't get fevers that happen.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  Right.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  And no one's denying it's not a bizarre bio weapon.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  But I think it's a panic weapon, David.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  Mike, let me tell you something.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  I covered this this morning.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  There's an article, a couple of articles talking about the fact
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  that Australia, China, South Korea have found a malaria drug
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  that has been used in the past.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  It's very cheap now because it's no longer patented.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  And I forget exactly what the name is.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  You can search it yourself, but they found that that's very effective.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  There's also HIV drug they found to be effective,
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  but that of course is still under patent.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  So it's expensive.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  It's difficult to get.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  This malaria drug they said is very effective at this.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  That's why, you know, it's, there's, there's other things
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  that you can do other than relying on waiting for a vaccine.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  That's right.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  A lot of the hospitals aren't even talking about that.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  They want to be as bad as possible.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Mike, what else do you want to add?
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  I also want to say that I do, I do have a friend who delivers
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  for Walmart.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  He drives a tragic trailer and he's, he's currently saying,
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  he's in South Carolina and he's currently saying that he's having
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  trouble even getting his truck loaded because none of the workers
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  are going into the warehouse to even go to work.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  And Mike, I'm glad you brought this up.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  I told listeners this and I'm going to explain this again to
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  everybody.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  People are all leaving.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  They're panicking in an adjusted time economy.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  That will cause a depression like that.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  Yeah.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  And so it is a plug.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  We have a warehouse.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  We have trucks that come and get it.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  But you need to get your orders in now for supplements that
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  boost your body's response.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  It's now time to take action.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  But 99% of those who died had virus and other illnesses.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  That's even Bloomberg.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  So Rappaport was reporting that a couple days ago.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  That's right.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  But now there's Bloomberg confirming Rappaport's report.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  Yeah.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  So again, this is a massive sigh out folks.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  It doesn't mean it's not a bio of it.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  It doesn't mean it's not man made, but it just means exactly.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  The truck drivers are powering through.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  They're not cowards.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  I'm not kissing their ass.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  It's true.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  We have a lot of old people die in Italy.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  Average age, 80.3 years.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  And so we got to shut down Italy.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  Shut down.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  Rappaport had that out two days ago.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  That's right.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  And now it's in Bloomberg.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  That's right.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  So again, I'm not trying to...
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  Folks, this is a sigh out.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  Anything else, Mike?
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  See, I'm really grateful to you guys because of you and Mike Adams
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  that I was able to have my mother get prepared,
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  a couple of friends get prepared.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  And without me sounding the warning that you gave,
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  they would be totally...
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  They'd be in a bad situation.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  Thank you, Mike.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  In fact, let me explain this paradox.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  Because I'm getting a lot of emails, a lot of calls about,
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  hey, you don't like Mike Adams?
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  No, Mike, I think it's coming on Friday.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  He's invited on.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  He thinks the most extreme version.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  He's been very accurate so far that we've created a huge panic
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  and all that.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  So we've been...
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  We were here saying this is going to be a big economic hysteria event.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  And this is a man-made bio-weather.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  So we're very concerned.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  I've definitely boosted my own deal, more ammo, more food,
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  telling my wife and kids, please try to stay home as much as possible.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  But now the panic, it's kind of like when you get the Spanish flu.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  It's the autoimmune response that would kill you, not the flu.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  And so it's like our response is what's killing us, David.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  Well, and the other thing Alex is that I'm a libertarian,
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  I believe, in free markets.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  I think that an open and free economy can respond to this better
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  than a centralized command and control economy.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  They can't fix the economy because it's a federal reserve
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  that created the bubbles, the quantitative easing,
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  throwing in $500 billion in here.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  And now they're going to just lock everybody down.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  It's going to cause a depression.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  It is.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  Trump's been set up.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  It is.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  And he's going to get all the blame.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  They've been blaming him and now they're going to give him the blame
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  when he follows their advice.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  Yeah, unbelievable.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  All right, we're going to get to everybody.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  Everybody hold him.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  We're going to get to you.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  Millie Weaver bringing her in.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  She'll ride shotgun with us now.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Millie, I've got a lot of questions, a lot to talk to you about.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  I've been wanting to get you on for a few days.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  I remember you two years ago saying your intel sources said
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  a bio attack to bring down the U.S. economy, shut down the media.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  I know you've got a lot of great sources.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  I've been at the White House.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  I mean, I know you're amazing.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  What is your, in the three minutes we have to break,
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  you're just the most important thing you want to say here.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  Okay, so if you remember when I broke that story to you, Alex,
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  about how my source was talking about an impending bio weapon attack
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  being in the back channels and the chatter,
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  I also mentioned Facebook ID and how we were going to be moving to digital IDs.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  And digital ID is actually going to play a huge role
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  because when you have a crisis situation, right,
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  don't let a crisis go to waste.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  You use that situation to usher in more totalitarian
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  of governances, laws, regulations,
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  just like they did with 9-Eleven to usher in the Patriot Act.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Notice right now you have the Patriot Act,
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  the sunset clause of the 215th section that allowed
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  for a lot of defies abuses and spying on American people.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  That just sunsetted March 15th and you have this battle going on
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  throughout Congress and the Senate.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  All of these Rhino-Republicans and Democrats
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  trying to get through more legislation
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  that will allow for spying on the American people.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  And then you have people like Rand Paul and Mike Lee
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  speaking out against it, saying they're going to filibuster it.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  So there's this battle going on right now over our rights
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  to not be spied on.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  But also in the background, there is a new system,
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  the ID 2020 system or the Real ID Act
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  that comes into effect October 1st, 2020.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Okay, this is very important because if you actually
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  research into this new ID system,
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  when you go to the driver's license,
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  they're now going to take a picture.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  It's going to facial scan you and put you into a system
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  where you're essentially going to have this digital ID
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  and this is being implemented all across the world right now.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  There are many other countries implementing it at the exact time.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  There's a globalist police state update.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  So as David was saying, as you're saying,
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  all their agendas are pushed through with this.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  Is that what you're saying?
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  Yes, I mean, there's a shift happening right now
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  is what I'm telling you.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  I mean, if you look at ID for Africa,
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  they're already implementing these digital IDs in Africa.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  And one of the requirements now that they're having
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  for their citizens who don't have constitutional protections
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  is they're requiring people to have vaccination certificates,
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  which then is attached onto their digital ID.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  So it's a key document to allow them to leave
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  or enter the country and to be able to enter certain public settings.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  Exactly.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  So it's about medical, tyranny, forced inoculation
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  and gun confiscation.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  This is the takeover.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  We're witnessing right now.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  Exactly.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  That's why we're seeing everyone being ushered into quarantines.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  So the real question is,
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  are we not going to be allowed back out into the public
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  until we all get on these real IDs
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  and we all accept these vaccinations
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  that they're rushing through right now to get?
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  And then it's a natural emergency when you have a convulsion and die.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  It's okay because the drag queen's storytime
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  is taking place after you're dead with your children.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  They're right back with Millie Weaver and your phone calls
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  and David Knight stay with us. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  Listen to me very, very carefully.
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  I am involved at very high levels with supply chain management
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  and talk to a lot of executives.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  And they are confirming to me that the supply chain
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  is starting to break down
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  because they're running out of the raw materials for food
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  and things like high quality supplements
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  that boost you and your family's defense.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  you need to get your orders in now
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  at mfullwarstore.com for X2, X3,
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  Living Defense, DNA Force Plus,
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  and all the other great products.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  Many of them are about to sell out
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  in the next few days to the next few weeks.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  Others are going to be running out as well in the next month
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  and we're not sure if we'll ever be able to get them again
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  in the foreseeable future.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  That's how crazy all of this is.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  So stock up on the supplements that you and your family need
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  and fund the mfullwar.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  Take action now.
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  with the public service announcement.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  Mfullwar's as of today
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  is now suspending storeable food sales.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  We still have storeable food.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  We're able to package all the storeable food
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  and get it to everybody that ordered it.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  Most of you have already gotten your food.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  But the reason I'm making this announcement is
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  all the other major food suppliers were sold out
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  over a month ago as we first reported to you,
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  but they lied to you and they took your money.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  Well, we know for a fact they're still taking everybody's money.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  Even though the food has all been sold out,
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  the basic ingredients for storeable food is gone.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  All the big box stores are paying way over normal prices
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  to buy up what's left.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  And so anybody telling you that they have storeable food
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  is lying to you.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  The good news is everyone that ordered at mfullwarstore.com
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  has already gotten it.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  Or if you ordered recently, we have the food as being packaged
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  and you will get it.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  But as of now, we are suspending all new food sales
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  at mfullwarstore.com.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  We've all watched with disgust and anger
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  as companies across the United States and the world
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  see these prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  MFull Wars has done the opposite.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  Despite the fact that we've sold out of many of our products
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  and are waiting for others to come back in,
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  we have kept all the products that we have in stock
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  massively discounted 20% to 50%.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  The average discount is 40% right now on our best-selling items.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  So stock up on things for you and your family
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  during this crisis, bolster your body, bolster your defense,
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  be as healthy as you can so that we can all make it through this together.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  It is so important for everybody to do their own research
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  and to protect themselves and their families
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  with the knowledge that God has given us.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  Be sure and visit mfullwarstore.com today
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  and take advantage of these items while we still have them in stock.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  Our constitutions, our health, is our most valuable asset.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  It's what allows us to stay alive on this amazing planet that God's given us.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  And we've got to take care of our bodies. We've got to take care of ourselves.

[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  to help our bodies boost their defense against all the insane things
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  that have been artificially introduced into our environment.

[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  And during this crisis, I am discounting everything.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  That's 40% at mfullwarstore.com.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  I want to go to the callers. I want to get working these callers in here.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  I'm going to say this.
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  This virus is really communicable in hysteria. It's created.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  And when you see the public being tested like this
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  and you see these lockdowns expanding
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  and you know the sponsor can be a global depression,
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  the sponsor can be a global depression,
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  this is the global state wanting to kill the economy to make us submit to it and be dependent.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  And I think that's really the final equation.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  Now the answer is getting the truth out about that and pointing that out.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  I'm going to ask Millie and I'm going to ask David their take on what Trump should do in a moment.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  Let's start getting to some of these calls.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  Let's talk to Matt in Nebraska says hospitals forcing quarantines on nurses and medical staff.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  Tell us about that, Matt.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  Yeah, I heard from a mom that has a friend that worked at David City, Nebraska,
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  that are making nurses and medical staff sign a thing saying that if you drive past 60 miles,
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  you're automatically 14 day quarantine because of the outbreaks in Omaha or in Lincoln.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  And I mean now these nurses are supposed to go get food and stores and all that.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  And then another point, the Hong Kong has already put out a press release for your COVID-19 bracelet.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  So they're already ahead of the ball game.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  That's all I gotta say.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  So Hong Kong has people wearing the bracelets that David broke?
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  Yes.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  Yeah.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  Yeah.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  Oh no, it's going out.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  What's your bottom line take on this, Matt?
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  I just cannot believe the way so many people are buying into the hysteria.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  I'm a truck driver in Nebraska and all the local docs and warehouses are having the truck drivers not go check in.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  They got a call in first and it's all a panic.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  I mean, there's bars in Nebraska that in my town that used to have like 50 or 60 people.
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  They're listening to the governor's restrictions to have an only 10.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  I've never seen that bar that, especially during a weekday after everybody got off work,
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  there's only 10 people there.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  They're just following procedures and it's going to come down to what you're saying.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  Oh yeah, the globalists are going to only do more of this now because we're acting like good little slaves.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  Thank you, Matt.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  Millie, what do you think Trump should do?
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  Well, you know, I think it's interesting they brought up this, these bracelets in China though,
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  how they're already going to say, oh, you've been pre-screened.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  That's interesting because that's what they're moving towards being able to put everyone's health records up into digital form.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  That digital form can be put on your biometrics in your real ID and essentially you could just scan your ID
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  and find out whether or not you've been pre-screened and whether or not you're allowed in certain areas.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  I mean, as far as Trump goes, I think that he's trying to do his best right now to just keep the economy from crashing.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  Oh yeah, I mean, at first I was like, you need to respond more because they're setting you up with it.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  But I wasn't even thinking third, fourth dimensional there because then clearly once he did that,
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  now they've got him where he's got to do everything they want.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  Exactly.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  And the other thing is though, is he is trying to take a stand.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  He did tweet out just the other day, you know, basically saying that he was going to veto the FISA bills.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  If they try to push him through.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  So he's trying to take a stand against this encroachment on Americans' rights and privacy rights.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  And they're using this crisis, this virus to scare everyone into giving up our rights.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  That's totally clear.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  It's all across the board.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  In fact, what are the agendas they're getting, David?
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  You already listed a bunch of them.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  Oh yeah, well, you know, universal basic income, we have to replace.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  Look, when Bloomberg got into so much criticism because of what he said about farmers, what he was saying in full context was he said,
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  we've had an agricultural society, then we replace that with an industrial revolution.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  But right now, those of us who are smart like me, we're working on ways to put all these people out of work.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  And what we have to figure out is how we're going to keep them from taking guillotines to us.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  That's what that was his words, guillotines.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  So they know that pedophilia is coming out, that globalism is coming out.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  So now they just shut the economy off using their financial power and change our perspective to survival instead of removing them.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  Here's what Trump needs to do.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  He needs to get some films of Winston Churchill.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  In 1939, when their backs were against the wall, they had impossible odds.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  That's where you get that sign, 1939, keep calm, carry on.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  But there was another sign, Alex, and it said, freedom is in peril, defend it with all your might.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  These people were not concerned about their lives as much as they were about their liberty.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  Look, we're not going to do this at which unbombers.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  A night bombing you, and tens of thousands dying a night, and it went from 10% supporting the war to 99%.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  So we're not like these people.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  Like Aryan says when they got attacked, got meaner and tougher, they didn't go, oh, let me roll over and piss all over myself.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  That's right.
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  And CS Lewis, I talked about this today.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  He lived through that in the atomic age.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  He said, what do we do now?
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  He said, if you are focused on survival, you will not survive as a society, as a culture, as a nation.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  You have to understand that there are more important things than your individual survival.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  And if you will trade your liberty for freedom, you will never achieve that.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  When you're willing to die for freedom, you've got an incredibly free society because you've got a bunch of people who don't take crap.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  But when you're all a bunch of jellyfish, you go, this is a test, folks.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  Everybody wanting to avoid bio weapons, this is a released bio weapon.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  And now if you take the bait and grovel and they get power out of it, you're going to have bio weapons all the time.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  They're going to get a lot worse.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  And more importantly, it's a psycho war as well.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  It's a psychological war. It's a total scythe.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  Let's take another call here.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  It's been holding the longest here.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  That would be Chad in Washington.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  The virus, the coming martial law.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  Hell, we're already in it.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  Brother, we're already in the boiling pot.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  Yeah, absolutely we are.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  Thanks for taking my call today.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  First of all, I'm just wondering how much more bad moves Trump needs to make for you to quit being an apologist for him.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  He's working with Andrew Yang's campaign and his people for the universal income that they're proposing.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  He's always tricked by the deep state, right?
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  But he's a mega genius and he only hires the best.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  No, he's still on the swamp making it deeper.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  He will start door-to-door gun confiscation.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  Martial law, like Katrina, there will be FEMA.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  Here's the funny thing.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  You keep saying that I'm behind the curve.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  I'm the guy that popularized that martial law was coming using bio weapons attacks in the last 26 years.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  I don't think anybody denies that.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  Our credibility in stocks gone straight up.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  Our audience is 10 times whatever was despite the bans.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  We just exploded.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  Okay, and I saw the globals legitimately go after Trump, legitimately go after me when I supported him in the level number 14.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  So I'm like, oh, I'm under attack.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  I should support this guy.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  I've got big problems with some of the stuff Trump does, but I have to know some people that advise him and he's trying to balance this.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  So we're here criticizing some of the stuff he's doing, but it doesn't mean we think he's a bad guy.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  So let's just move on from I'm an idiot.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  Okay, I don't know anything.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  Instead of talking about, I don't know anything, Chad, enlighten us, sir.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  Yeah, like I said, he's going to start the door-to-door gun confiscation.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  That's happening.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  Martial law is next.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  There's going to be FEMA camps.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  It's going to be just like Katrina taking the guns in the high and dry areas.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  We're going to have the ultimate tracking system like Millie Weaver brought up.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  It's going to be the rail ID 2020.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  Trump is behind this all.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  He's signed executive orders to institute AI in all sectors across our country.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  Okay.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  You understand Millie Weaver is part of Info Wars.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  You calling in this part of the force.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  When you say Info Wars isn't saying this, you're on air saying this, sir.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  I just want to be clear that, you know, people are on the show yesterday and they're like,
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  Info Wars is saying nothing bad is happening.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  And I'm like, you're on Info Wars.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  You're Info Wars.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  We're just having a big discussion here.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  I just said what Trump should say.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  And let me tell you what, I don't think Trump's going to do that.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  I don't think Trump is going to act like Winston Churchill.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Let me tell you, we don't have a savior in Washington.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  We need to do this ourselves.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  That's part of growing up and learning to be responsible and fighting for our freedoms.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  We organize at the local level.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  Liberty is never going to be handed to us.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  We're going to have to take it.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  And that means we're going to have to start organizing on the local level.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  You get people to set up sanctuary cities.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  Not just for the Second Amendment, but for all of the amendments at the Constitution.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  I'm tempted to like say I'm going to the park and I'm hosting a gathering.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  Just to say, you want the virus not to be deadly.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  I'm not going to live in this fear.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  That's right.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  This weekend, you had the people in France, the Yellow Vests showed up in public,
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  even though they told them not to.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  They've been doing this, I don't know, 60, 70, 80 weeks.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  They've been doing this.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  Why?
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  Because they were going to shut them down.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  They were going to use.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  The globalists are on their heels everywhere.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  That's right.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  And that's why they tried to force Trump to stampede.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  He didn't have it.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  I said respond in rhetoric, not in action, so they can't blame him.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  And then now I think he's starting to go too far the other direction.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  All right, Chad, I really appreciate your call.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  Millie, we were going to break state with us.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  What is your take on what you just heard?
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  Well, basically, my sources have said that the plan was to impeach Trump, right?
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  And they fully thought that that was going to go through.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  So what we're seeing right now took a lot of back energy and time to plan out.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  They were already planning this once Trump was taken out.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  So we wouldn't riot with him being taken out.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  Bingo.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  We were going to get around us up and put us in the camps after Trump was taken out.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  OK, so this is all now coming into motion now.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  OK, but Trump is still in power and thank God for that.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  But you have to understand Trump is not orchestrating this.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  He's not some mastermind behind this.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  He's doing his best right now to keep the economy from crashing.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  And yes, there is a real virus out there, but the risk to yourself is really low.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  It's mostly going to hurt old people and the people who are immunocompromised.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  You're going to have before, Millie, I got hardcore chills when you just talked.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  Because I was meaning to say that today on the air.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  Clearly, everything they're doing is six months a year behind.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  That's why they had the Roger Stone trial, the attacks on Trump all lined up that failed.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  So they're still running operations that were already set.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  That's how they were going to keep Americans from revolting.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  Once Trump was taken out was the virus.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  That's why it was all exactly you are.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  That is that is the truth, which you just heard.
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  It's all over the news.
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  It's being announced by politicians from Germany, the United States.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  Thank God coronavirus is here.
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  Thank God it's going to kill the old people.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  Thank the heavens that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  Humanity is evil.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  All the Hollywood movies, all the propaganda, all the U.N. statements,
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  all the Ted Turner and Prince Philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  to depopulate and control the population.
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  And now it's here and they want to lock down society and are licking their lips
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  and saying Trump isn't doing enough.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  What a sickening in your face declaration of war against humanity
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  by these control freaks who think it's their right to put fluoride in the water,
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  give us toxic vaccines, openly dumb us down.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  And then when we resist, call us terrorists and conspiracy theorists
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  when they're publicly admitting their plan to exterminate everyone.
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  It's time to expose the scum.
[1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to pray.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  It's time to seek God's face.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  It's time to repent for the 64 million abortions in America
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  and the 400 million abortions in Communist China
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  and for all of the Satanism and all of the pedophilia and all of the corruption.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  Or God is going to continue to allow the globalist to judge us for him.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  That's right, God is lifting the hedge of protection away from the people
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  and allowing Satan and his armies to have their will with the people.
[1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:09.000]  The model states emergency powers act.
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  We'll talk about that in that segment.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  Millie Weaver is here with us.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  I'm going to get to all your calls. I'm hosting the fourth hour today.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Don Lamar, Tony, Tim, Michelle, Edgar, Wesley, Diego,
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  William, Daryl, I'm getting to all of you. David Knights here.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  Millie, repeat what you just said from your sources and research.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  That is dead on from my research of Trump is he's the guy we put in there.
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  He's pragmatic. He's pro-America.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  He's got a lot of the military behind him, a lot of patriots.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  There's a civil war in the government
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  and everything they're doing is six months to a year old.
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  He was supposed to be gone now.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  We wondered how they would try to tamp down the American people.
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  It's with a virus scare to make us forget they just removed the president,
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  but instead he's still there.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  This is amazing. Millie Weaver.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  Exactly. That was the plan. I mean, they planned this out in advance.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  He was supposed to be gone.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  They were then going to roll out, oh, buy a weapon and get everyone quarantined,
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  fully usher in all their ID, AI systems,
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  try to do what they could to control everyone.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  So right now what they're actually doing is they are trying to tank the economy.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  It's still rolling out as was planned, but now Trump is in power.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  And the whole idea here is let's tank the economy. Let's wreck everything.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  Let's overburden the medical system. Let's make it look bad for Trump
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  because we have not a chance in hell at winning in 2020.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  So they're trying to do, in a way, a coup against Trump at the moment.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  But remember, this is also to try to re-invoke FISA
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  because they need a state of emergency in order to justify spying on the American people further.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  So what's happened? Pay attention.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  FISA has sunsetted the 215 clause from the Patriot Act.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  They can't spy on Trump anymore.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  They can't spy on American people anymore.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  But guess what? Because we have these states of emergencies
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  and martial law type scenarios going on,
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  Trump and Space Command can survey.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  They can spy on the deep state.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  So we have a situation here where Trump is taking advantage of the crisis
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  that they created to further go up against the deep state.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  Well, let me say what adds credence to that.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  We got a call from Zach Voorhees a few days ago. I looked it up.
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  You type in Alex Jones, M4s, vaccines.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  All the original top links have gone back to when Google actually worked.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  YouTube is still broken and has fixed results across the board.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  But suddenly there's all these Google resignations of top executives.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  That adds a lot of credence to this, Millie.
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  Yeah, and I'm not going to give too much information on this right now
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  because I will be doing a report on it in the future.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  But right now there are over 150,000 sealed indictments right now.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  We've been hearing about that Q stuff forever.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  Is that Q stuff you're talking about?
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  I mean, all I'm saying is my sources know that there are 150,000
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  sealed indictments in America.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  And Trump is using this crisis situation to go after the deep state.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  Papers have turned. They can't spy on him anymore.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  The clause has sunsetted, but he can now spy on the deep state
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  because of these martial law emergencies.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  Well, in my experience, the way they built it is,
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  William Benning's posed this,
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  you don't know who gets into the NSA database, which is open for hacking,
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  so they can all use it and then leave themselves backdoors,
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  like Frodo, you know, sneaking into the Dragon's Lair to get to gold.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  I think they're just a wide-open mess.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  Oh, yeah. And look, just two weeks ago, March 5th,
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  you had the story that surfaced and it was widely reported on the Drug Report.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  A company called Babel Streets, and they have an app called Locate X,
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  and they said, oh, look, we've got a lot of law enforcement entities that have this.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  They can basically draw a geofence around an area,
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  and then if you go into that defined area,
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  they have given themselves the ability to scrape all of your travel history off of your phone.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  And so this is, now they're talking about this,
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  and we've got to do this as a preemptive thing to protect everybody.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  And that's what China did.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  It's all been tested in China.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  Now, they're exporting it here.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  Beta tested, yep, yep.
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  And shutting everything down was beta tested.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  All right, Millie Weaver, amazing job.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  David Knight, thank you so much.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  We're going to come back and take a few calls.
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  But Millie, I wanted to give you a chance.
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  A lot of people find, at Band-Ought Video, all your stuff's there too,
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  but you're also Millie and Millie still on YouTube, Twitter.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  How do folks follow your amazing work?
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  Well, you guys can go to Millennial Millie on YouTube, Millie underscore Weaver on Twitter,
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  or millennialmillie.com.
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  I'm going to be doing a video today, uploading it more on this.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  So please go ahead.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  All right.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  Well, we're glad you're not panicking.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  Again, we're saying the virus could be deadly.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  It's got some problems.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  We're just not going to run around like chickens with our heads cut off,
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  jumping around, jumping off cliffs.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  I'm sorry.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  It's just not the American way.
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  We should fight on to the end.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  We should never surrender.
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  We're right back.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  Info Wars has had to suspend all new food sales because the supply chain has collapsed.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  This is a system-wide problem, and this country is facing a new depression
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  unless Trump and the American people work together to develop a plan
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  to expose this globalist operation.
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  That said, people are calling and saying we wish you had the supplements in stock.
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  We wish that wasn't sold out.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  They've confused that with the food.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  Everything we advertise, everything we sell, we have in stock,
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  and we are only one day behind in shipping.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:37.000]  That means if you order on a Monday, it's shipping out on a Wednesday.
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  And that's just as of today.
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  Most days, we are up to the day shipping, meaning you order that day in the morning.
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  A lot of times, it ships out that afternoon.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  We have everything in stock that is so good to boost your overall defense
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  against what's going on.
[2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  All right, I want to go to a lot of calls this segment with a brief comment
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:05.000]  by myself for David Knight here.
[2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:07.000]  Again, Alex Jones, Broadcasting Worldwide.
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  Let's go to Tim in Illinois.
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  Thanks for holding Tim here on the air.
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:13.000]  Thanks, Dave.
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  I'm glad you guys brought up Bill and Melinda Gates,
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  the same ones that had the event 201 in Johns Hopkins in 2019,
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  where a coronavirus just happened to disable the United States.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  Oh, they even want us to know that Obama transfers it in 2015.
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  They have all these TV shows coming out.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  Finance and Bill and Melinda Gates, about a massive pandemic, 2020.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  They have a tabletop exercise of 65 million dead four months ago
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  when we know the virus is now already live.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  This is ridiculous.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  What do you think is going on?
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  Here's what I think is going on.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  I happen to be a company officer at the largest fire department
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  in the Midwest over 20 years.
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  I was very concerned about this weeks ago because I've got children
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  and you have to carry your kid.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  I really followed this weeks ago, and it's been a community.
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  You take Mike Adams.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  I like Mike Adams a lot, but I think he's panicking right now
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  with his own numbers because he stated,
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  people that don't realize this is going to be dead.
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  You know, sir, unfortunately your phone is breaking up
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  and I've been holding a long time.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  Try to get to a better spot.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  I'll come back to you next time.
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  Don't hang up.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  That would be Don in Texas and then Lamar.
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  Don, you're on the air.
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  I appreciate everything you are doing.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  So I'll try to make it quick, but it looks like Millie Weaver
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  is right on target and not just her.
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  It's just both you guys bouncing back off each other,
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  which has kind of gave me some more confirmation on what's
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  really going on here and it's really a setup.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  It's almost like Trump's been checked, mate,
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  but not quite yet.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  No, I agree.
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  Two weeks ago, he looked like he was dying.
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  Now he's got his confidence back, which means I've always learned
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  when Trump really looks sick and he's pissed that he's losing.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  Now he looks like he's back on his.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  I mean, I really learned to like watch how Trump looks.
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  Right.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  Well, the thing is we're being set up for a true invasion and they
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  may be two, four years out because that's the kind of thing
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  that's holding us back to Trump.
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  And just like you said, how are you like, hey,
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  I think I'm going to go set up a group outside and see what
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  they tell me.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  Well, that's what other people are thinking too.
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  What happens if I open my barber shop?
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  What happens if I go to church?
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  What happens if we gather?
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  Are they going to prosecute us?
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  Who's going to enforce that?
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  And once, I mean, the basic way to invade people,
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  because they're not going to destroy us, if they destroyed us,
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  they'd use the nuke.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  They need our land and obviously.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  They need to divide us.
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  Exactly.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  They need our people too.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  And if this is going to control us to teach us to stay inside,
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  and I have to kill everybody, but they can truly invade us.
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  And then drones, the robot army flies around barking orders.
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  The robot invasions already beta tested.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  They're showing you robots are going to come with weapons
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  and tell you what to do.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  Yeah, autonomous killing machines.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  And this is an episode one of Star Wars.
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  This is happening.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  Basically, if you look at the ethics of a bio weapon,
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  it's the same as having an autonomous killing robot or drone
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  or submarine.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  Just, you know, let it go and make the determination
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  that it's going to kill itself.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  It's a self-determining operation.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  Just eradicate humanity.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  Yeah.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  Great points.
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  What else, Don?
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  No, that's it, man.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  It's all a setup and you guys are right on target.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  So if you just keep up hot shows like this,
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  I know the president's listening.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  People are listening.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  People are going to start to see the veil come off
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  and people are going to open the businesses
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  and then there's going to be that conflict
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  and hopefully people do the right thing,
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  which is to stick to what we've always thought to,
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  which is freedom here in America.
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  Well, this is totally surreal that we're still on air.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  They try to take us out and they're doing all this
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  and it's so obvious they're doing it.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  And it's just showing us the wheat from the chaff,
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  the men from the boys,
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  and it's just going to get more insane.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  This is it.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  I mean, and the Antichrist and the world government
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  and a digital tattoo that, like you said,
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  they were off air talking to folks
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  that it's much worse than just a shot.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  It's like a whole bunch of shots making this digital tattoo
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  in your skin merging with you.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  It's not just a chip within you.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  It's your skin.
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  You have to cut out a huge lump of skin.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  It's so satanic.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  And it was 16 times more effective
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  at delivering the DNA vaccine that they were working on
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  even 12 years ago, 2008, when they were talking about it.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  And now, you know, they've got proof of concept out there
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  with Bill Gates.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  God knows what they're adding in there.
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  The Trojan horses.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  Everything they give you has a Trojan horse.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:39.000]  Thank you, Don.
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  Unbelievable.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  Let's see if the caller, Tim and Illinois' phone is better.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  Tim, go ahead and start over.
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  You're a major fire company.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  Fire departments get a lot of intel.
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  You've been paying attention to this for a while.
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  What do you think is going on?
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  Well, I was looking at the numbers.
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  And if it's supposed to double every three to six days,
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  and it was in community, I was really watching this.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  I was upset when the CDC dropped the numbers off their website
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  two and a half weeks ago.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  The only index we have right is deaths.
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  So even if we had just 1,000 people that were infected
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  when it was in community, you know, if you do the progression,
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  with a 2% kill rate and a 15 to 20% kill rate
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  without hospitalization.
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  I tried, Tim. I appreciate your call.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  It's just not working.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  Let's understand that 2% kill rate is because
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  they're not counting mild cases.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  And the 15% death rate, the worst case that we've seen
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  is for people that are over 80, even in the 70s.
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  Their pool is from people that are deathly ill and old.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  And the boomers, the left is celebrating getting rid of old people,
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  just to tell sick they are.
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  It's going to make social security solvent.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  The left is never held responsible for hoping everything fails,
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  hoping old people die. They're just a bunch of idiots.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  Hey, dumbasses, you're going to be old soon, too.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  And they love bullying babies, old people.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  They're just the scum of the earth.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  Lamar in Alabama, you're on the air with David Knight and Alex Jones.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  Go ahead.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  Hi, Alex and David. Good to talk to you guys.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  Hey, so I think Tim was kind of onto something there,
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  but what he brings up is what concerns, you know, the average person.
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  And so the average person is looking at the death rate,
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  and that's what Mike Adams is looking at.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  So, you know, I'm looking at this very methodically.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  It's something I used to do in my former life.
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  And so I try to envision, okay, what could be happening that makes Alex right
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  and Adams, Mike Adams, right?
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  And if you imagine a scenario where there was not a single point of origin
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  in Wuhan for the virus, but it's actually being seeded.
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  Of course it is.
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  Then you can imagine how all sides could be corrected at the same time.
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  And it's being seeded in leftist areas so they can take full advantage of it,
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  the clamp down and getting the emergency funds.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  Or anywhere that people decide that they don't want to obey the authorities.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  So if you were to go have your group meeting, you can expect that, you know,
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  if you have 500 people show up, you're going to suddenly have an outbreak.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  You know, and so that's how they can control the numbers.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  Just like that church they called a cult in South Korea.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  And understand if they were to come in and we saw this in Virginia.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  So we're going to take the guns.
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  And you had small town sheriffs and mayors and so forth saying, no, you're not.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  But now this is an invisible enemy.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  And all we have are people in white coats arguing from their degrees and their statistics.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  And we can't check their assumptions except we just found out that the Chinese
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  were rigging the statistics to make it look more deadly.
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  They just changed it as of last week.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  And so I said, look at that.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  We've had an explosion in the number of cases and yet they were keeping the number of cases lower.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  And so they could make it look more deadly.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  Exactly.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  Let's concede that and say, OK, you can have your assumptions.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  Then how could nobody's asking President Trump?
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  Why is China now in a post virus posture?
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  They're all going back to work.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  How can we be told that we have to accept losing a couple million people for this virus when they're going back to work?
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  It doesn't add up.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  No, it's because it's a much lower death rate.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  I'm concerned about the reinfection.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  It is manmade.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  And they could use other viruses or other strains out there.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  So I think it's important to be concerned.
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  But I'm just telling you, all the scripting, brother, all the coordination, it's staged.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  It's just phony's a $3 bill.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  The response is the real threat.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  The hysteria is the threat.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  What do you think Lamar?
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  Let's concede that they have their numbers, OK, and give them that.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  But then we have to ask what some of us were asking.
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  Well, are you saying that the doctors and nurses in Italy, for instance, are not telling the truth?
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  Well, of course they are because the virus was seated there.
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  But that doesn't mean that those numbers are true globally on a global spectrum.
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  So it's kind of like a chameleon that depends on what point in time you look at it.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  Sure, they can also have a lab-made virus that mutates into something being harmless quickly.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  So you release it, know it's going to hit your people.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  And I mean, the whole thing sticks to heaven.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  Great points, Lamar.
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  David Knight, you host your powerful David Knight transmission 8 a.m. weekday mornings.
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  And folks love tuning in to be able to subscribe to the free podcast we're listening live
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  in FullWars.com for the David Knight section on Band-Aid video.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  Really great reports to share with everybody.
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  David, thanks for coming in, buddy.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  We're shaking hands.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  That's right.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  We're living on our knees in fear.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  Because, hey, we fear God that can kill the soul, not the body, not old, beelzebub.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  More calls coming up.
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  Dr. Francis Boyle with his latest analysis and more straight ahead.

[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  It takes a long time to break down the product because it's a complex product.
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  A lot of the sprays you put in your mouth for your throat and lungs are really thin.
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  It's a little bit of alcohol if you want it to essential oils.
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  Not our lung cleanse.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  It's got a long list of the highest quality essential oils and ingredients in it.
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  You take a few sprays in your mouth, lightly inhale,

[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  Dr. Francis Boyle is not at his Illinois University job.
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  He's a law professor and he's the author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law,
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  the McKim World Treaty.
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  Now he's at home. His university is closed.
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  Look at this, Orange County outlaws all public and private gatherings of any number.
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  Look, I respect Dr. Boyle.
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  We've had a lot of different views on here.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  He first helped expose with others, the major university studies that it was a man-made virus.
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  Now the Communist Chinese is trying to blame the United States.
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  But the fact is that the left is gleeful over shutting down the economy using this
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  and getting people dependent.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  And the universal income, 2,000 from Trump, all of it.
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  It advances so many agendas, bill them on the gates.
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  Want this digital tattoo.
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  But he always wants to cover new information.
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  It's important to recap the old, but I'll let him go wherever he wants up front.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  But first, these two clips.
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  Trump just finished 30 minutes ago, his press conference.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  Nationwide total female emergency.
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  I don't think that's ever happened, actually, since FEMA got set up at 79 by Jimmy Carter.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  I looked it up and it says it hasn't.
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  So this is martial law.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  Now the degrees of it, we're at about a three or four.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  It's going into five or a six very quickly in my view.
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  We'll see if Dr. Boyle disagrees with that.
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  On that he's an expert on things like martial law,
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  knowing international and national law.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  But let's go ahead and play the president here as the president.
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  We'll be invoking the Defense Production Act.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  Just in case we need it.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  In other words, I think you all know what it is.
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  And it can do a lot of good things if we need it.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  And we will have it all completed,
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  signing it in just a little while.
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  Right after I'm finished with this conference, I'll be signing it.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  It's prepared to go.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  So we will be invoking the Defense Production Act.
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  Last week I signed an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act,
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  which as you know, we invoked previously,
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  and which activated FEMA's National Response Coordination Center.
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  FEMA now is fully engaged at the highest levels.
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  By the way, we're going to Dr. Boyle in a moment.
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  There's a whole other area to this.
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  I said Trump should declare an actual emergency a year ago
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  to end Obama's national emergency to put deep state operatives in
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  that actually set up bureaus that countered independent media
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  and ran the censorship.
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  I mean, that wasn't me just saying it.
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  It's in U.S. government documents.
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  They actually listened.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  They're now removing the heads of Google very quietly,
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  and suddenly the Google search results are back to normal.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  YouTube isn't yet.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  So folks, we are not in Kansas anymore in any way.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  And if I tell you, I think the virus is a hoax.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  No, I don't think that.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  I think the hype to hurt the economy is a hoax.
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  I do think there should be some controls.
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  And, as I said, I think there shouldn't be some controls.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  Mr. Boyle, that is a serious virus.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  So I'm going to give him the floor on what he thinks is
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  happening and unfolding, and then we'll come back and play the
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  clip where Trump says China is blaming us.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  So I have to say, it's a Chinese virus.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  He's totally right about that.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  So Dr. Boyle, we've got five, six minutes to break.
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  I see you're there at home.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  You might just boil down your thoughts down.
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  We'll get into more detail when we come back.
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  But thanks for being.
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  Yes, I listened to the President's press conference
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:08.900]  today, and my reaction is this, that he is correct. We are at war with an offensive biological
[2:24:08.900 --> 2:24:19.700]  warfare weapon, and so we have to treat it accordingly. I believe this is simply, if
[2:24:19.700 --> 2:24:27.960]  you listen to the press conference last week by Dr. Birx, she publicly admitted that until
[2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:34.040]  last week, they were operating on the basis that this was just like the flu virus. Well,
[2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:41.960]  that's preposterous, because as you know, I have publicly identified this as an offensive
[2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:50.080]  biological warfare weapon as early as January 24. Dr, we're going to walk through that again.
[2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:53.080]  I don't mean to interrupt, but just your lawyer, people don't know this. You've been involved
[2:24:53.080 --> 2:24:58.520]  in emergency COG stuff. Explain what Trump just invoked. He put us on a wartime footing
[2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:03.840]  with FEMA. I mean, this is invoked. We're in a nuclear war. Explain to people. Well,
[2:25:03.840 --> 2:25:11.300]  the Defense Emergency Act, I support the President on that, that he needs to make it
[2:25:11.300 --> 2:25:22.080]  clear to some of these businesses that they had better start copying to it to produce
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:30.400]  respirators, ventilators, masks, and tests, or else he can nationalize them and do the
[2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:36.360]  job for them. I'm not saying he should do that now, but I think he's got a club over
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:41.440]  their head saying, you know, let's get to it right now. Sure. But when you say he knows
[2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:48.320]  we're facing a foreign offensive bioweapon, elaborate on that. Well, that's what it is.
[2:25:48.320 --> 2:25:57.400]  We've discussed that from the beginning. This is that Wuhan BSL for facility. It is clear
[2:25:57.400 --> 2:26:05.320]  if you read what they were doing there, this is their equivalent of our fourth D-trip,
[2:26:05.320 --> 2:26:14.680]  our BSL for that research tests produce every type of hideous biological warfare weapon
[2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:23.360]  you could possibly imagine. And it's clear they were and still are doing this at Wuhan
[2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:29.920]  and at least. And we know full well that there's a long history of leaks at Fort Dietrich as
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:35.320]  well. So, you know, I don't think they have more experience or better technology than
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:39.760]  we do. And how big is it that he came out and said it's not the U.S. military, it's
[2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:46.880]  China? I'm sure you've seen that clip. That's pretty big of him to say that. Well, I have
[2:26:46.880 --> 2:26:56.480]  looked into this allegation that it was U.S. military forces on these games over there
[2:26:56.480 --> 2:27:05.840]  in Wuhan that started all this off. But as a lawyer and a law professor, this is circumstantial
[2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:12.440]  evidence in our previous interviews. Yeah, just as I walked by your house at 10 p.m.
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:19.520]  at 1 a.m. your murder, it doesn't mean I murdered you. That's correct. But in our previous
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:27.040]  interview, I went through direct evidence. And the direct evidence was that smoking gun
[2:27:27.040 --> 2:27:35.360]  science article I went through with you on involving the University of North Carolina
[2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:43.560]  and the Wuhan BSL4 facility, where it says right there in the document that they were
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:52.080]  taking weaponized coronavirus and then enhancing it with gain of function properties, which
[2:27:52.080 --> 2:28:00.480]  we are seeing and have been seeing. And the scientists there from Wuhan obviously then
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:07.840]  took that technology back to Wuhan and weaponized it back in Wuhan. And so I believe it was
[2:28:07.840 --> 2:28:15.920]  a leak. So yes, we bear some responsibility because that hideous Nazi biological warfare
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:24.520]  research, which I condemned at the time and other scientists did, was funded by the National
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:32.800]  Institutes of Health under Francis Collins, who's still in there. He's an Obama holdover.
[2:28:32.800 --> 2:28:37.240]  By the way, where is Francis Collins? He's distance himself from that, but it's right
[2:28:37.240 --> 2:28:42.360]  on there on the funding. Dr. Boyle, Dr. Francis Boyle, stay with us. We're going to come right
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:46.520]  back with you and ask whatever you want to cover. I got a lot of questions, but whatever
[2:28:46.520 --> 2:28:50.440]  you want front and center to talk about because it's a paradox here. I see him hyping it up
[2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:54.600]  to crash the economy. I don't like that, but you're a smart guy. I respect you. It's deadly
[2:28:54.600 --> 2:29:00.560]  virus. Attention GCN self-reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:04.800]  backup system, but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:08.920]  important message you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde, I want to tell you about a huge sale with
[2:29:08.920 --> 2:29:13.560]  historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[2:29:13.560 --> 2:29:18.160]  endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic
[2:29:18.160 --> 2:29:22.200]  flooding we're having here right on the East bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding,
[2:29:22.200 --> 2:29:26.200]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move
[2:29:26.200 --> 2:29:29.840]  it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem
[2:29:29.840 --> 2:29:34.280]  unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory. So here's what you should do right
[2:29:34.280 --> 2:29:41.280]  now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:41.280 --> 2:29:46.040]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too. In the best part, you're
[2:29:46.040 --> 2:29:52.440]  not going to pay $750 or $500, $300 or even $200. Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[2:29:52.440 --> 2:30:09.440]  That's myownpowergrid.com. It's a beautiful world outside, but inside
[2:30:09.440 --> 2:30:16.000]  the halls of government, inside the corridors of the mega corporations and tyrannical regimes
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:24.240]  like China and the Communist Party that runs it. There is a raw desire for power and control
[2:30:24.240 --> 2:30:33.000]  over people and now we learn from an MIT tipster. We even got the documents and were able to
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:36.400]  search them and then discovered that it was accurate information actually in the public
[2:30:36.400 --> 2:30:44.920]  domain. The Bill and Melinda Gates are preparing an embedded digital tattoo under your skin
[2:30:44.920 --> 2:30:51.760]  to show that you're not infected with coronavirus so you can travel and buy and sell. The Mark
[2:30:51.760 --> 2:31:00.720]  of the Beast 666 is here. We've all watched with disgust and anger as companies across
[2:31:00.720 --> 2:31:07.480]  the United States and the world raise prices during this crisis and gouge their customers.
[2:31:07.480 --> 2:31:12.720]  Info wars has done the opposite. Despite the fact that we've sold out of many of our products
[2:31:12.720 --> 2:31:16.920]  and are waiting for others to come back in, we have kept all the products that we have
[2:31:16.920 --> 2:31:25.680]  in stock massively discounted 20 to 50%. The average discount is 40% right now on our best

[2:31:56.720 --> 2:32:05.560]  change, the waves of change are here. The world has become decadent, the population
[2:32:05.560 --> 2:32:12.040]  has become hypnotized and the globalists are moving in for the kill. First they make
[2:32:12.040 --> 2:32:20.080]  us stupid and dumb down and put us into a trance and once they've done that, once they've
[2:32:20.080 --> 2:32:26.640]  made us obsolete, they begin to release the bio weapons each more deadly than last as
[2:32:26.640 --> 2:32:34.080]  they hurt us into the bubble high tech control grid cities until they finally release the
[2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:40.120]  ultimate bio weapon with a 100% kill rate which then mutates into a harmless bug after
[2:32:40.120 --> 2:32:46.760]  a few years and the controllers emerge from their underground bunkers. And of course
[2:32:46.760 --> 2:32:50.680]  they have the cure to all the diseases they release as well. They admit it, they publicly
[2:32:50.680 --> 2:32:54.680]  talk about their plan to kill us all. A lot of liberals are celebrating this so remember
[2:32:54.680 --> 2:33:21.240]  who your enemies are.
[2:33:21.240 --> 2:33:29.800]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:29.800 --> 2:33:34.560]  Well I respect Dr. Francis Boyle and many others we've had on and it is a man made weapon
[2:33:34.560 --> 2:33:39.160]  and people that get it, it's killed a lot of folks. But look at the numbers, you even
[2:33:39.160 --> 2:33:47.720]  believe the UN numbers. Total confirmed 212,616. Total deaths, 8,727. That's gone up since
[2:33:47.720 --> 2:33:54.320]  this morning about 500 deaths. Total recovered 83,000. Well who knows what these surveillance
[2:33:54.320 --> 2:34:01.160]  numbers. So getting back to Dr. Francis Boyle, we've never seen all these cities and mayors
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:07.520]  following the example of the communist Chinese or the Europeans and I mean I respect you
[2:34:07.520 --> 2:34:12.480]  when you said Trump should try to restrict things to stop the flow. A month ago when
[2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:17.280]  the left was mad that he was blocking flights from China or a few weeks ago when he was
[2:34:17.280 --> 2:34:22.920]  blocking flights from Europe or last week. But now I just watched this huge exercise
[2:34:22.920 --> 2:34:27.520]  of our liberties being flushed on the toilet. What do you think about that and how deadly
[2:34:27.520 --> 2:34:31.800]  do you as a researcher and a guy that does this for a living think this virus really
[2:34:31.800 --> 2:34:32.800]  is?
[2:34:32.800 --> 2:34:40.680]  Well Alex I hate to say it, I'm not here to scare monger anyone but I think we're moving
[2:34:40.680 --> 2:34:51.760]  in the direction of Italy at this point. What can I say? And Italy does not look very enticing
[2:34:51.760 --> 2:35:03.680]  for our future. So as I've said before I think every mayor, city director, governor has to
[2:35:03.680 --> 2:35:12.440]  sit down there with their best healthcare experts, medical experts, scientists who have
[2:35:12.440 --> 2:35:20.320]  not taken one penny of this Nazi biological warfare work from the United States federal
[2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:27.440]  government and figure out what is best for their community because I'm afraid Italy
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:35.480]  didn't do it. South Korea has. Now South Korea is a democracy. I don't think Hong Kong
[2:35:35.480 --> 2:35:42.800]  is a fair model, that's a police state, city, police city state. I don't believe Singapore
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:49.440]  is a fair model or comparison either if you read the New York Times or what. Everyone
[2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:56.840]  knows it's a police city state there in Singapore. But I do think that every state local community
[2:35:56.840 --> 2:36:02.520]  in the country could move over to what South Korea has been doing. It appears South Korea
[2:36:02.520 --> 2:36:11.440]  has brought this under control and they are democracy and they attempted to maintain democratic
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:16.000]  processes and procedures. I think that's really what we're going to have to do now because
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:21.480]  otherwise the future is Italy.
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:25.440]  How deadly from your research is the virus because we don't really get clear numbers
[2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:26.960]  on the death rate.
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:34.320]  Right, well all the figures we're seeing now, it all goes back to China and whatever figures
[2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:41.400]  they're putting out and we can't rely on it. So I would say probably at least 10%, maybe
[2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:50.760]  15%, some healthcare experts there wrote an essay and Lancet estimating 15%. So that might
[2:36:50.760 --> 2:36:59.560]  be the high figure and also depending on your vulnerability, people over 60 medical conditions.
[2:36:59.560 --> 2:37:05.440]  But that's a good 20% of the population right there and now we have the latest studies coming
[2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:13.040]  out from China. It's affecting young people as well. So, you know, it doesn't look good
[2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:19.360]  at all to me, Alex. I think we have to be very careful with these models, people coming
[2:37:19.360 --> 2:37:23.560]  out and saying, well, it might kill a million people, two million people here in America.
[2:37:23.560 --> 2:37:31.880]  A lot of these people have vested self-interest here, but I think it has to be taken far
[2:37:31.880 --> 2:37:34.000]  more seriously than it has been so far.
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:38.400]  Well, I was about to say, I mean, I sell a lot of products with sponsors and products
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:43.560]  we sell for many years that, you know, that we promote that boost immunity, that promote
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:48.840]  health and I basically pulled back, you know, during this because obviously if I was just
[2:37:48.840 --> 2:37:51.840]  trying to make money, I'd say it's the end of the world, get this product right now.
[2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:56.440]  I think people should always try to boost their overall health and, you know, take things
[2:37:56.440 --> 2:37:59.840]  that are known to be really good for you and your body. And I'm not saying people that
[2:37:59.840 --> 2:38:03.240]  are saying it's the end of the world or just doing this, they make money off of it. It's
[2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:08.640]  just that I'm just worried how we come back from this and how long it goes. I mean, I've
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:13.480]  got articles here in mainstream news where the German health minister says it may take
[2:38:13.480 --> 2:38:19.560]  two years and, you know, 18 months and all of this. Well, that's just not how civilization
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:24.280]  works. I mean, we'll have a depression and millions will starve to death.
[2:38:24.280 --> 2:38:31.240]  Well, certainly it looks to me like if action is taken now, we'll be facing a depression.
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:37.080]  Right. I think that is correct. I don't know how long it will go, but steps can and should
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:44.120]  be taken now to blunt this thing and contain it. Trump gave an estimate of July and August
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:53.000]  that that I think is at least a very conservative assessment between you and me. But I think
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:58.960]  we have to get through this first and then we can sort out where where we go from there.
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:07.360]  So I do support this. Bring out the Army Corps of Engineers. I do support governors falling
[2:39:07.360 --> 2:39:14.480]  off the National Guard when when they believe this necessary. I support for localization,
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:20.960]  not parallelization. That's correct. We have to act. That is actually correct. And that's
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:27.680]  what I've acted. I suggested here before that the American people have to get organized
[2:39:27.680 --> 2:39:35.280]  on a state and local basis and look into this and and take steps to protect themselves and
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:39.440]  their families. Well, let's pull this up. The Dow Jones industrial average right now
[2:39:39.440 --> 2:39:46.600]  is down more than 2000 points. And this is happening on a daily basis, 2059 points.
[2:39:46.600 --> 2:39:53.600]  And basically hovering right there. This is this. This is unbelievable. All of us will
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:39:57.640]  I don't own stock. Why do I care? They don't know that companies and businesses operate
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:01.880]  off of this. They'll go out of business if they don't have that decent stock value. And
[2:40:01.880 --> 2:40:05.960]  then the then the industry goes away. You know, the level of the public's ignorance
[2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:10.400]  about the economy does not make me feel like a globalist ago. Let me pray on these people.
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:14.400]  It scares the hell out of me because as you know, Dr. Boyle, a collapsing US society with
[2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:18.800]  all the drug addiction and crime and weirdness and racial division, this country will not
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:22.480]  act like we did back in the 1920s. What do you think America will behave like during
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:26.480]  a great depression? Part two, I think it'll be explosive. I think I think the globalist
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:30.160]  elements will exacerbate as much as they can.
[2:40:30.160 --> 2:40:37.320]  Well, certainly if you listen to a lot of the globalist in the mainstream news media,
[2:40:37.320 --> 2:40:43.600]  that's exactly what they're doing now. I'm not trying to name any names here, but you're
[2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:48.560]  right. And there are large numbers of people out there scaremongering and making these
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:55.040]  predictions and projections and something like that. But on the other hand, I have trust
[2:40:55.040 --> 2:41:01.560]  faith in the American people that otherwise I wouldn't be a lawyer and a law professor
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:07.480]  that that if they look at a problem, they come together. But they do it locally. They
[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:10.440]  have to do this locally. They just can't look to the
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:14.120]  Do you think the Democrats are going to be smart though and not because they're already
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:17.980]  trying to use this political hay and calling Trump racist for shutting down flies from
[2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:22.240]  China, even though they said he didn't respond enough? I mean, I think they should just stop
[2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:26.240]  trying to make Hey, out of this is too dangerous. Don't they realize what a breakdown of civilization
[2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:31.640]  will be like will be like Venezuela? This is I have children. And so it's not even secondary.
[2:41:31.640 --> 2:41:35.160]  It's not even in 10th place making money during something like this because the money will
[2:41:35.160 --> 2:41:36.160]  be worthless.
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:42.920]  Well, that's you're correct. I'm afraid the Democrats are just launching a lot of cheap
[2:41:42.920 --> 2:41:49.920]  shots there at President Trump. I've had my disagreements with President Trump. I still
[2:41:49.920 --> 2:41:59.080]  do on other issues. But I see no point in politicizing this in the run up to the 2020
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:04.280]  elections. We have to get there in the first place in one piece.
[2:42:04.280 --> 2:42:07.320]  That's another question we come back and then I'll try to give you the floor to cover any
[2:42:07.320 --> 2:42:12.360]  issues you want. Butter Boyle, but I'll take calls the fourth hour if he leaves this. They're
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:17.000]  already talking about canceling the election. They're already they're already postponing
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:22.600]  primaries and voting. I mean, this is just this is this is out of control and this is
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:28.520]  historic folks. It's game changing. It's beyond the crossroads. I don't know what you call
[2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:35.920]  this point we've reached in history, but it is fantastical in all of its different permutations
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:43.120]  and possible outcomes and destinations. And it's dizzy. I try to wrap my brain around
[2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:46.840]  it and I actually become dizzy. You heard the thing like the problem was dizzying. I
[2:42:46.840 --> 2:42:49.360]  was like, I was a kid like, what does that mean? Well, you find enough knowledge, be
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:55.360]  able to grasp stuff, then you try to grasp it and you get dizzy.
[2:42:55.360 --> 2:43:01.240]  It's all over the news. It's being announced by politicians from Germany, the United States.
[2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:07.520]  God Corona virus is here. Thank God it's going to kill the old people. Thank the heavens
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:13.280]  that we're going to depopulate the planet because humanity is horrible. Humanity is
[2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:20.480]  evil. All the Hollywood movies, all the propaganda, all the UN statements, all the Ted Turner
[2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:25.600]  and Prince Philip garbage saying that they want to use a deadly virus to depopulate to
[2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:30.320]  control the population. And now it's here and they want to lock down society and are
[2:43:30.320 --> 2:43:36.600]  licking their lips and saying Trump isn't doing enough. What a sickening, in-your-face
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:42.360]  declaration of war against humanity by these control freaks who think it's their right
[2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:47.240]  to put fluoride in the water, give us toxic vaccines, openly dumb us down. And then when
[2:43:47.240 --> 2:43:51.600]  we resist, call us terrorists and conspiracy theorists when they're publicly admitting
[2:43:51.600 --> 2:43:55.400]  their plan to exterminate everyone. It's time to expose the scum.
[2:43:55.400 --> 2:44:02.360]  Our constitutions, our health, is our most valuable asset. It's what allows us to stay
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:06.400]  alive on this amazing planet that God's given us. And we've got to take care of our bodies.

[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:40.160]  Battling tyranny worldwide news wars.com. Hillary Clinton amplifies communist Chinese
[2:47:40.160 --> 2:47:46.640]  propaganda saying the virus came from Wuhan is racist. That's all over CNN. It's everywhere.
[2:47:46.640 --> 2:47:53.080]  It's the new thing. But the Chinese government's busy officially saying they think the US military
[2:47:53.080 --> 2:47:58.840]  may have done it. Here's that clip I mentioned earlier. China and others have criticized you
[2:47:58.840 --> 2:48:04.080]  for using the phrase Chinese virus. How do you feel about that? Are you going to continue
[2:48:04.080 --> 2:48:08.120]  using that phrase? Well, China was putting out information which
[2:48:08.120 --> 2:48:14.120]  was false that our military gave this to them. That was false. And rather than having an
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:19.320]  argument, I said, I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I
[2:48:19.320 --> 2:48:22.640]  think it's a very accurate term. But no, I didn't appreciate the fact that China was
[2:48:22.640 --> 2:48:26.800]  saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody.
[2:48:26.800 --> 2:48:30.240]  We're going to start using our phrase, create a stigma.
[2:48:30.240 --> 2:48:36.960]  No, I don't think so. No, I think saying that our military gave it to them creates a stigma.
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:41.160]  Mr. President, are we... Wow, the way they just all are for the
[2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:46.240]  Chai comms and not America. Is this not obvious to everyone? And here's a MSNBC Soros-funded
[2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:50.600]  operative, well-known operative, saying the same talking point. Here it is.
[2:48:50.600 --> 2:48:56.000]  Racism and outbreak is such a common thing. We've seen it in past health outbreaks that
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:00.060]  we've seen in this country's history. The problem is it's coming directly from the
[2:49:00.060 --> 2:49:04.880]  President of the United States. And it is incredibly dangerous. It is problematic and
[2:49:04.880 --> 2:49:09.240]  it is scary. And I just really want to call that out because you do have people in the
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:15.400]  Asian American community whose lives are at risk. And for the President to call it a Chinese
[2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:21.840]  virus or a foreign virus, that is just not... It's just so dangerous and not a good thing
[2:49:21.840 --> 2:49:26.240]  to do, obviously. You say it's Trump's fault. You say it's America's fault. You don't have
[2:49:26.240 --> 2:49:30.960]  memories. And he says, no, America didn't do it. It came from China and it's our fault.
[2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:35.080]  I want you to get into other subjects you want to cover. Dr. Boyle here with us today, author
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:41.560]  of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law. But just responding to that whole situation, what's
[2:49:41.560 --> 2:49:43.360]  your view on it?
[2:49:43.360 --> 2:49:51.480]  Well, Alex, I do have one observation, which is it does appear Biden is going to be the
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:50:01.160]  Democratic presidential nominee now. His top advisor is Ron Klain, who was behind me at
[2:50:01.160 --> 2:50:07.680]  Harvard Law School and is a longtime political hatchet man and operative for the Democratic
[2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:17.720]  Party. Obama put Klain, made him his Ebola czar. Even though Klain had absolutely no
[2:50:17.720 --> 2:50:26.920]  qualifications at all in terms of public health or anything else to do this job, but to keep
[2:50:26.920 --> 2:50:35.000]  it under control for political reasons. And Klain was very successful in covering up the
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:44.080]  fact that that Ebola West Black West after Ebola pandemic started with an experimental
[2:50:44.080 --> 2:50:58.040]  Ebola vaccine coming out of the USA ID, CDC, BSL for factory by a warfare factory in Kenema,
[2:50:58.040 --> 2:51:09.800]  Sierra Leone, incredible involving for Dietrich, Harvard, MIT, Broad Institute and Tulane, among
[2:51:09.800 --> 2:51:10.800]  others.
[2:51:10.800 --> 2:51:14.920]  And that's just incredible. That's all on record that happened. We forget about that.
[2:51:14.920 --> 2:51:19.440]  Was that more like Tuskegee with the syphilis? And, you know, I mean, they probably did
[2:51:19.440 --> 2:51:24.800]  it on purpose. I mean, they didn't accidentally give somebody a vaccine with live Ebola today.
[2:51:24.800 --> 2:51:29.160]  They used vaccine with live Ebola. Yes, it was in there. And no, no, no, they were probably
[2:51:29.160 --> 2:51:32.680]  doing I mean, just speculating. You think they did that on accident. I think they were I think
[2:51:32.680 --> 2:51:36.840]  they created an outbreak. They got caught. They said it was an accident.
[2:51:36.840 --> 2:51:44.120]  Right. And they refused to own up with it. And Ron Klain, Obama, Biden's top advisor
[2:51:44.120 --> 2:51:46.480]  now was in charge of that.
[2:51:46.480 --> 2:51:50.480]  And Trump should whole hog make this. I've forgotten all that. I'm glad you raised that
[2:51:50.480 --> 2:51:57.000]  Dr. Boyle. Trump should double down. They're trying to blame him. He should go after them.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:03.960]  Why not? I think President Trump should just be focusing on dealing with the current problem.
[2:52:03.960 --> 2:52:11.960]  But I wanted to agree with you that the Democrats are using this for partisan political reasons
[2:52:11.960 --> 2:52:13.600]  against President Trump.
[2:52:13.600 --> 2:52:19.040]  No, sir, sir. Let me put it, Dr. Boyle. I put I have children. I put safety about politics.
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:23.080]  I agree with you. But if you're being attacked by a bunch of attack dogs, while you're trying
[2:52:23.080 --> 2:52:26.520]  to fix a reactor, you got to deal with the attack dogs or whatever, whatever analogy
[2:52:26.520 --> 2:52:30.760]  you want to use. He has to get the deep state to stop it at some point, because they just
[2:52:30.760 --> 2:52:34.960]  keep while he's trying to fix stuff, I think pragmatically, they're always attacking. So
[2:52:34.960 --> 2:52:39.320]  I'm saying if he can defeat them and really give them a political death blow, then he
[2:52:39.320 --> 2:52:42.800]  can try to fix stuff. Does that make sense? I'm just saying he has to be they need to
[2:52:42.800 --> 2:52:44.840]  be gone after.
[2:52:44.840 --> 2:52:55.640]  Well, that's a tough question, Alex, but it seems clear to me that Biden Clinton claim
[2:52:55.640 --> 2:53:03.840]  he's on MSNBC, CNN. They're using this as a political weapon against President Trump
[2:53:03.840 --> 2:53:05.520]  for the 2020 campaign.
[2:53:05.520 --> 2:53:08.200]  Exactly. That's insanely dangerous.
[2:53:08.200 --> 2:53:14.560]  Well, I think what we should be having is constructive criticism, which I have been
[2:53:14.560 --> 2:53:19.080]  trying to provide to you here today. I'm a political independent.
[2:53:19.080 --> 2:53:22.560]  Yeah. And the time we have left, what do you think Trump should do? And, you know, I think
[2:53:22.560 --> 2:53:27.000]  I respect Mike Adams. I think he's kind of on the extreme end. Maybe I'm wrong. But maybe
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:31.440]  I just can't handle the truth. How bad is it?
[2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:41.960]  We're moving towards Italy. And I think President Trump has to realize he is up against a Nazi
[2:53:41.960 --> 2:53:50.160]  offensive biological warfare weapon. That's what this is and where it came from. And the
[2:53:50.160 --> 2:53:56.800]  I regret to say, I don't believe we civilians are capable of taking care of this.
[2:53:56.800 --> 2:54:00.720]  Why are you sure the Chai comms released this on accident right when they lost the trade
[2:54:00.720 --> 2:54:05.200]  war? If you look at history and wars, you would release that when you got your ass kicked
[2:54:05.200 --> 2:54:07.400]  as a desperate measure.
[2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:15.680]  Again, Alex, in good faith, I believe this was was an accidental leak. Clearly they were
[2:54:15.680 --> 2:54:22.720]  weaponizing this to use it against us. I don't doubt that for one minute. But there have been
[2:54:22.720 --> 2:54:30.720]  leaks at these Chinese bio warfare labs before they they leaked before they leaked this time
[2:54:30.720 --> 2:54:36.480]  for Dietrich is leaked. All these BSL three and fours leak. And that's why President
[2:54:36.480 --> 2:54:41.840]  Trump needs to show you're right centrally. How many dozens are there here and overseas
[2:54:41.840 --> 2:54:45.080]  that they don't want to galveston down the road? They've got a lot of level threes doing
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:49.080]  level fours. I mean, this and they have the emergency model states held emergency powers
[2:54:49.080 --> 2:54:53.480]  act and let some do all this crap and briefly tell folks about the real threat. Because
[2:54:53.480 --> 2:54:57.720]  every time I turn around in history, whether it was the Russians or the US or the French
[2:54:57.720 --> 2:55:01.720]  or anybody, you'll hear about a whole town get sick. And it's because there's some bio
[2:55:01.720 --> 2:55:07.280]  release or some radiation release or a chemical weapon blows up. I mean, it's so dangerous
[2:55:07.280 --> 2:55:09.760]  to have these weapons.
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:16.480]  That's right. West Nile came from the US bio warfare facility at Plum Island. The anthrax
[2:55:16.480 --> 2:55:22.600]  line disease came from there. There's a long history of these leaks. Yes, there's there's
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:29.080]  no question at all about the Zika virus. I I might have loved that was deliberately
[2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:36.360]  manufactured that that involved weaponized mosquitoes and Bill Gates was involved in
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:43.520]  that and the Rocky Mountain Warfare facility was a problem. Sure. Well, exactly. If you
[2:55:43.520 --> 2:55:46.840]  go watch a science fiction movie and there was like some dude doing this, you wouldn't
[2:55:46.840 --> 2:55:51.440]  believe it. But in real life, Bill Mulligan's release these mosquitoes and then it causes
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:56.040]  kids to have heads the size of softballs. I mean, it's just like and they don't get
[2:55:56.040 --> 2:55:57.440]  in trouble.
[2:55:57.440 --> 2:56:06.040]  No, there's no, as I said, my law provides life imprisonment. But the so far no prosecutions
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:14.000]  are at least against our own Nazi bio warfare death scientist. Well over 13, I'll call it
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:18.920]  Nazi bio warfare. Be clear. You're explaining to people that that's where this got started.
[2:56:18.920 --> 2:56:23.080]  It's all a kind of a continuation of that program.
[2:56:23.080 --> 2:56:30.800]  That's correct. And we also after World War Two, we took over the entire Japanese bio
[2:56:30.800 --> 2:56:33.920]  warfare program that they used against China.
[2:56:33.920 --> 2:56:37.200]  That's what we love about their war criminals off, didn't we?
[2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:43.360]  Yes, we let all of these Japanese war criminals who, by the way, were alive with Hitler. Remember,
[2:56:43.360 --> 2:56:54.280]  there was the Pact of Steel, the Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo Pact, all of them in there together.
[2:56:54.280 --> 2:57:00.120]  And the Japanese were inflicting hideous biological warfare on the Chinese people during World
[2:57:00.120 --> 2:57:08.560]  War Two. And we made the medial that if they turned over everything, all their materials
[2:57:08.560 --> 2:57:14.680]  and their services to us, they would not be prosecuted and they were not. It's that simple.
[2:57:14.680 --> 2:57:15.680]  All right.
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:17.680]  So a lot goes back to that. Yes.
[2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:21.160]  Dr. Boyle, thank you for all the time. People can just type in your name, Francis. They
[2:57:21.160 --> 2:57:25.040]  will find all your great books and information. Thanks for your courage. And I appreciate
[2:57:25.040 --> 2:57:28.840]  you. I really respect you. And I am folks are listening to you. Thank you.
[2:57:28.840 --> 2:57:35.080]  Well, again, Alex, thanks for having me on. And I've received some very positive feedback
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:42.560]  from your listeners and also some constructive criticisms myself that I I take into consideration.
[2:57:42.560 --> 2:57:45.400]  All right, God bless you. And thank you so much, sir.
[2:57:45.400 --> 2:57:51.760]  There can no longer be any doubt. The globalists have orchestrated this entire crisis. But
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:58.640]  it's not a hoax. The virus is real. And the panic it's creating is on a scale never before
[2:57:58.640 --> 2:58:04.680]  seen. It is said in the Bible that the wicked flee when none pursue, but the wicked really
[2:58:04.680 --> 2:58:12.320]  run for their lives when something real is killing people silently and quietly. Ladies
[2:58:12.320 --> 2:58:18.960]  and gentlemen, it's time to pray. It's time to seek God's face. It's time to repent for
[2:58:18.960 --> 2:58:25.360]  the 64 million abortions in America and the 400 million abortions in communist China and
[2:58:25.360 --> 2:58:31.160]  for all of the Satanism and all of the pedophilia and all of the corruption. Or God is going
[2:58:31.160 --> 2:58:37.200]  to continue to allow the globalist to judge us for him. That's right. God is lifting the
[2:58:37.200 --> 2:58:43.240]  hedge of protection away from the people and allowing Satan and his armies to have their
[2:58:43.240 --> 2:58:46.320]  will with the people.
[2:58:46.320 --> 2:58:53.000]  Info wars has most of our high quality supplements in stock in our warehouse ready to ship to

[2:59:42.280 --> 3:00:05.760]  and your family at infowarfstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:05.760 --> 3:00:12.480]  Paging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[3:00:12.480 --> 3:00:19.080]  the Info War. Well, land to the cowards, home of the slaves. I just watch Americans
[3:00:19.080 --> 3:00:23.320]  grabbing their toilet paper. They don't care about their supplements to boost their immunity.
[3:00:23.320 --> 3:00:27.680]  They just care about freaking out and running for the hills. We've got video coming up.
[3:00:27.680 --> 3:00:32.320]  It's up on infowars.com and newswars.com. America first, Trump bars immigrants from
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:39.120]  an entering country, citing coronavirus and what popped up in the city of Laredo in the
[3:00:39.120 --> 3:00:46.480]  latest Texas city barring gatherings of more than 10 people. And now Orange County outlaws
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:51.200]  all public gatherings of any number. Well, next you can be with your kids. Left to like
[3:00:51.200 --> 3:01:00.840]  just commit suicide and stop the virus from spreading. I get it's an offensive bio weapon,
[3:01:00.840 --> 3:01:05.880]  but you could release it knowing what it was going to do to then hype it up. I just don't
[3:01:05.880 --> 3:01:08.480]  buy this whole thing, but that's what we're having different guests on different perspectives.
[3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:13.120]  All right, we're taking phone calls right now. Let's go ahead. Who's been holding the
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:17.800]  longest? Let's go to Daryl in Illinois and then William Diego and others. Daryl, thanks
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:21.800]  for holding. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, thank you for taking my
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:31.440]  call. Thank you. I just want to say John Rappaport with his report yesterday during the fourth
[3:01:31.440 --> 3:01:36.560]  hour and I was listening to it with my wife last night before we went to sleep and we
[3:01:36.560 --> 3:01:46.320]  were laughing so hard with that toilet paper. I mean, to be serious, his analysis of why
[3:01:46.320 --> 3:01:52.320]  they don't, you know, talk about the number of deaths every day from old people really
[3:01:52.320 --> 3:01:57.720]  kind of wakes you up in the fact that they don't even count the numbers. That's like,
[3:01:57.720 --> 3:02:07.120]  I think he said 2007. It's just quite eye opening to hear that kind of stuff. That's
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:12.920]  why I love that. I mean, obviously I love you guys, but also to defend Trump a little
[3:02:12.920 --> 3:02:19.360]  bit. I know the guys that your screen caller said this is the order out of chaos. I wish
[3:02:19.360 --> 3:02:29.200]  my call was that cool, but to quote Ron Emanuel, you know, never let a good crisis go to waste.
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:36.640]  I just hope that Trump signals to us patriots that are kind of, you know, relying on him
[3:02:36.640 --> 3:02:43.440]  in a sense, just where I disagree with David Knight a little bit, that, you know, maybe
[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:46.880]  I guess like Billy touched on it a little bit, maybe they're going to roll up people
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:52.040]  with all these indictments. But if you would just help to signal because like you said,
[3:02:52.040 --> 3:02:58.480]  this is the biggest battle in our lifetime. Maybe in American history, maybe possibly
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:06.760]  world history, because I don't know how we recover. I mean, people not working. And just,
[3:03:06.760 --> 3:03:12.520]  I mean, we, no doubt we, without the distractions of sports and everything, people, this is
[3:03:12.520 --> 3:03:19.520]  going to get everybody's attention. So I hope all you men out there, patriots are listening.
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:25.560]  This is, I mean, either we stand up now, or like you said, just, you know, there are
[3:03:25.560 --> 3:03:30.560]  fires, like in a fetal position, and wait.
[3:03:30.560 --> 3:03:36.600]  Well, that's it. I mean, it's how much people love getting hysterical about this when you've
[3:03:36.600 --> 3:03:43.080]  had, let's put it back on the board. The UN says how many dead there are. And it's not
[3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:48.280]  even a fraction of the dead we would have each year from flu. Can we punch that map
[3:03:48.280 --> 3:03:57.760]  back up whenever you guys get a chance. So they show the deaths worldwide. You add them
[3:03:57.760 --> 3:04:04.880]  all up. It doesn't even add up to what die here each year. But again, we knew this was
[3:04:04.880 --> 3:04:10.360]  all coming. The globalists admitted they would use bio weapon threats and bio crises to bring
[3:04:10.360 --> 3:04:13.440]  in their tyranny. And now it's going to be enforced by robot drones. You're going to
[3:04:13.440 --> 3:04:18.640]  have digital tattoos under your skin. It's all being announced. Everything we said, it's
[3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:22.840]  unbelievable because we believe the Bible and we study what was happening and we've
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:27.400]  been dead on. And just, hey, they're they're not the only force in the universe. We're
[3:04:27.400 --> 3:04:31.160]  still on air because of you. We're still together. And amazing things are happening.
[3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:34.520]  Darrell, thank you. All right, I'm moving quick when we come back. You've been holding
[3:04:34.520 --> 3:04:39.880]  a long time as a guest that got on after you. But your calls are 60 seconds away. I cannot
[3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:44.560]  stress to you how critical it is to spread the links and to override the sensors. Band
[3:04:44.560 --> 3:04:50.080]  dot video news wars dot com info wars dot com and send out those articles.
[3:04:50.080 --> 3:04:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with the public service announcement info wars
[3:04:59.000 --> 3:05:05.720]  as of today is now suspending storeable food sales. We still have storeable food. We're
[3:05:05.720 --> 3:05:08.840]  able to package all the storeable food and get it to everybody that ordered it. Most
[3:05:08.840 --> 3:05:13.520]  you've already gotten your food. But the reason I'm making this announcement is all the other
[3:05:13.520 --> 3:05:18.880]  major food suppliers were sold out over a month ago as we first reported to you, but
[3:05:18.880 --> 3:05:23.160]  they lied to you and they took your money. Well, we know for the fact they're still taking
[3:05:23.160 --> 3:05:29.320]  everybody's money. Even though the food has all been sold out, the basic ingredients for
[3:05:29.320 --> 3:05:35.280]  storeable food is gone. All the big box stores are paying way over normal prices to buy up
[3:05:35.280 --> 3:05:41.360]  what's left. And so anybody telling you that they have storeable food is lying to you.
[3:05:41.360 --> 3:05:45.520]  The good news is everyone that ordered an info or store dot com has already gotten it.
[3:05:45.520 --> 3:05:49.240]  Or if you ordered recently, we have the food is being packaged and you will get it. But
[3:05:49.240 --> 3:06:04.920]  as of now, we are suspending all new food sales and info or store dot com.
[3:06:04.920 --> 3:06:11.320]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[3:06:11.320 --> 3:06:19.480]  to Alex Jones. Well, regardless of how deadly the virus is worldwide deaths are like 15,000
[3:06:19.480 --> 3:06:27.000]  or something. If you believe the numbers, we've taken the chicken little bait. And now we're
[3:06:27.000 --> 3:06:32.360]  going to get implanted digital tattoos, bill gates, arm bands and forced inoculations and
[3:06:32.360 --> 3:06:38.520]  gun confiscation. But the border is going to stay wide open. But you don't ask questions
[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:42.640]  about that, ladies and gentlemen. All right, let's go back to your phone calls. Nikki in
[3:06:42.640 --> 3:06:48.120]  Michigan is a nurse reporting on fatalities told not to wear a mask. Wow, Nikki, tell
[3:06:48.120 --> 3:06:54.200]  us what's happening in Michigan. Hi, Alex. Long time listener, my husband and I have
[3:06:54.200 --> 3:07:01.660]  been fans since 20 plus years ago. I've been a nurse for 15 years. I basically work critical
[3:07:01.660 --> 3:07:06.800]  care but not the ICU part. I'm kind of in the area that's actually pretty much the most
[3:07:06.800 --> 3:07:12.280]  dangerous besides the ER because we get anything through the whole house that goes bad. And
[3:07:12.280 --> 3:07:16.160]  then we get everything out of the ICU when they're getting better. So we're kind of like
[3:07:16.160 --> 3:07:20.600]  the middle and we can take pretty much anything like we do cardiac drips, the sickest of the
[3:07:20.600 --> 3:07:26.080]  sticker on my floor. So I just took a new job back at I'm not going to say the company,
[3:07:26.080 --> 3:07:31.200]  but I went back to a company that I worked for previously. And it's a very good facility.
[3:07:31.200 --> 3:07:35.720]  Like I can tell you that the care for the patients is extremely good. And God is in
[3:07:35.720 --> 3:07:41.240]  the house. That's all I'm going to say is it is a Christian based company. So I went
[3:07:41.240 --> 3:07:47.280]  back and I just started back January 24th. And I went to a full week of orientation.
[3:07:47.280 --> 3:07:53.400]  Nobody was to wash hands. Nobody was wearing mask. I started on the floor last Friday and
[3:07:53.400 --> 3:07:58.960]  I went to one facility. I'm not going to say the name of the right now. And there were
[3:07:58.960 --> 3:08:03.080]  no masks, nothing in the house. There were like six rule out cases, but nobody had been
[3:08:03.080 --> 3:08:07.880]  positive yet. And that was Friday. Saturday, I figured because the emergency was called,
[3:08:07.880 --> 3:08:14.040]  we would at least have like mass, something like that. So that day I was at Detroit. And
[3:08:14.040 --> 3:08:20.360]  I feel like Detroit is the worst one so far that I've seen because the people that I
[3:08:20.360 --> 3:08:26.520]  know there really have no clue. They're all it's getting spread all the information that
[3:08:26.520 --> 3:08:30.940]  you say is getting spread there. And a lot of them are looking at me sideways because
[3:08:30.940 --> 3:08:35.680]  I really don't talk about these things at work. You get judged by people really badly.
[3:08:35.680 --> 3:08:41.560]  But I did share a lot of all and stuff, especially the 5G stuff because I feel like that's the
[3:08:41.560 --> 3:08:45.800]  component that's missing right now. Let me tell you, let me tell you, David Knight's
[3:08:45.800 --> 3:08:53.680]  an engineer. It's in major studies. He breaks it down that no, 5G and other systems absolutely
[3:08:53.680 --> 3:09:00.200]  resonate. Your blood brain barrier mess up your, your, your tissues and allow chemicals,
[3:09:00.200 --> 3:09:04.560]  biologicals, radiologicals to get across a lot quicker. That's why in studies, it's
[3:09:04.560 --> 3:09:10.760]  frying men's testicles. I mean, there's major studies that 5G is destroying men's testicles
[3:09:10.760 --> 3:09:17.360]  because men are like geared for action and geared, but then they're not, their blood
[3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:22.160]  brain barrier isn't, it's about half as thick as a woman's. This is hurting women as well.
[3:09:22.160 --> 3:09:28.160]  But 5G just fries men. Because, you know, anything that's built for speed, built for
[3:09:28.160 --> 3:09:34.080]  action is, is, is going to then have other problems. And, and, and so men are built to
[3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:38.480]  fight, not built to last. And like Roy Batty in Blade Runner, that's kind of allegory of
[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:43.520]  a man. You know, you've done incredible things, Roy. Yes, questionable things, but not built
[3:09:43.520 --> 3:09:48.440]  to last, but you've burned so bright. You know, the light that burns twice as bright
[3:09:48.440 --> 3:09:54.400]  only burns for a little while. And so that's absolutely, it's a war on men. It's not that
[3:09:54.400 --> 3:09:58.160]  they want women in the future either. They've just decided that for whatever reason, this
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:03.960]  evil force wants to take women over. It's, it's like a psychic galactic rape. And it's,
[3:10:03.960 --> 3:10:06.960]  whatever it is, it's very sophisticated. What do you think?
[3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:11.920]  I think you are right on the money. And I've got, I've got proof of it too. I really do.
[3:10:11.920 --> 3:10:16.800]  Um, okay. So I've gotten, we've been forced to get flu vaccines. Let's jump here real
[3:10:16.800 --> 3:10:21.600]  quick. 15 years, I don't want it. Never found a friend that I could pay to say they gave
[3:10:21.600 --> 3:10:25.840]  it to me and didn't give it to me, but believe me, that's what I want to happen. Just so
[3:10:25.840 --> 3:10:32.040]  I can work and take care of my family. And, uh, this year I, I had a surgery last year.
[3:10:32.040 --> 3:10:37.120]  So I was late getting my flu shot. I got it about the end of October. This is the first
[3:10:37.120 --> 3:10:43.000]  time I ever had a reaction to the flu vaccine. And I was so deathly sick. I had to take off
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:48.680]  nine days from work. I ended up going to urgent care. I went to the ER. I went back to urgent
[3:10:48.680 --> 3:10:49.680]  mail.
[3:10:49.680 --> 3:10:54.560]  That's because you, you, the, they, they put the, the, they have nanotech stuff now that's
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:11:00.720]  beyond a bacteria or a virus. It's, it's digital viruses. They've been caught totally jacking
[3:11:00.720 --> 3:11:07.000]  with the vaccines with what they call simulants in these big tracking programs to track viruses.
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:11.360]  So everybody doing it thinks it's just a simulant, the vaccine. So scientists can track the next
[3:11:11.360 --> 3:11:15.840]  year's flu and get a better version. That's not it. It's the simulant is the real reason
[3:11:15.840 --> 3:11:17.840]  they're giving it to you.
[3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:22.760]  And that's because they want me to be a portable bio weapon. And that's what I am up against
[3:11:22.760 --> 3:11:29.720]  right now. I feel like we are bio weapons. They are asking me to go care for people,
[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:36.120]  to care for your mother, like I will for my own, but they want me to do it without PPE,
[3:11:36.120 --> 3:11:37.120]  without washing.
[3:11:37.120 --> 3:11:41.000]  That's what you're saying is you've been giving something that made you really sick. You instinctively
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:45.480]  think it's off shedding. You've been given immunity to it, but you're off shedding and
[3:11:45.480 --> 3:11:49.560]  as a bio weapon. Whoa, that's so sophisticated. And that's exactly the kind of stuff that's
[3:11:49.560 --> 3:11:50.560]  in the literature.
[3:11:50.560 --> 3:11:54.840]  Why wouldn't, why won't they test us? Like why the army gets tested before they send
[3:11:54.840 --> 3:11:55.840]  out the national army?
[3:11:55.840 --> 3:11:56.840]  Oh, they've got all the tests. Exactly.
[3:11:56.840 --> 3:12:02.560]  They did everything. We're the frontline health workers. Why are we not getting PPE? I am
[3:12:02.560 --> 3:12:03.560]  on one of the most...
[3:12:03.560 --> 3:12:09.000]  Well, Nikki, you talk about women's intuition. The thing is women are just as smart as men
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:12.120]  are smarter, but you have three times the connections between left and right brain.
[3:12:12.120 --> 3:12:15.160]  So women kind of just go like this because you've got so much knowledge coming in, but
[3:12:15.160 --> 3:12:17.000]  that's where the intuition comes in.
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:21.400]  Gut level are other people you talk to picking up the same gut level instinct?
[3:12:21.400 --> 3:12:27.640]  The people who trust me, they're really looking into it. Listen, I shared Owen's video. I've
[3:12:27.640 --> 3:12:31.960]  shared it on Saturday to a whole group of message people and I happened to pause it
[3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:34.320]  right in the, right in the center.
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:38.640]  So I go back to show my husband when he gets home from work on our main TV where we always
[3:12:38.640 --> 3:12:45.120]  watch all of you guys. The video was changed. My kids think we're crazy. They tell us to
[3:12:45.120 --> 3:12:46.120]  wear a tent hat.
[3:12:46.120 --> 3:12:50.240]  Oh, no, no, no, no. Let me stop you. In Australia, it started two months ago. It's in the news
[3:12:50.240 --> 3:12:55.000]  and Gavin McGinnis was talking about it. People that have memberships there can't watch him
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:59.640]  until they re-change their web address and then now they can. They're going in. Australia
[3:12:59.640 --> 3:13:04.320]  admits it in the news. They're blocking web addresses and even videos in live time and
[3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:06.080]  it's AI doing it.
[3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:13.520]  Yeah. Well, guess what? It was only Doris's, only Doris's part where she was talking about
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:18.720]  5G and her father-in-law and all that. So I had my son, my son's like, I'm going to
[3:13:18.720 --> 3:13:23.560]  see Fonkyu mom and he stands up with his phone and he's going through and we hit exactly
[3:13:23.560 --> 3:13:30.120]  one minute 58 seconds on that video from 313. It's all changed. And they only remove
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:34.120]  Let me tell you what's going on, ma'am. Listen, eight months ago, they banned me on Facebook
[3:13:34.120 --> 3:13:37.320]  for the second time and said, you can't be nice to Alex Jones. You must only say mean
[3:13:37.320 --> 3:13:43.680]  things. This was announced. They said on CNN, well, the next phase is banning using text
[3:13:43.680 --> 3:13:48.920]  messages, WhatsApp's on by Facebook and they went in to see if I had an account and said,
[3:13:48.920 --> 3:13:54.200]  oh, he doesn't have one, but we found a bunch of people in Band-Aim. They're in the text
[3:13:54.200 --> 3:13:59.040]  messages. Of course they're in your devo. Of course they're in your DVR because you
[3:13:59.040 --> 3:14:05.520]  can program a computer to do it. You could never have people doing all that. And so you
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:11.360]  are just a human recognizing what's happening to you and it feels crazy because we used
[3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:16.180]  to watch TV. It's a broadcast. You pick it up. You change the channel. Now TV watches
[3:14:16.180 --> 3:14:21.400]  us for 20 years. Cell phones watch us. We don't watch them. God bless you. I appreciate
[3:14:21.400 --> 3:14:24.920]  your call, Nikki. That was a great call. I said take a lot of calls. One call in a segment.
[3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:29.240]  I'm going to go to two calls next segment. I'm going to get to Tony, Michelle, Wesley,
[3:14:29.240 --> 3:14:33.960]  Diego, Diego's next and William and Dustin, everybody and Barney, but just be ready when
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:40.880]  we come back. But yeah, she's starting to get it. You see, they could implant now and
[3:14:40.880 --> 3:14:45.640]  I'm not a scientist. I just read a sign of reports. They can have a regular flu virus
[3:14:45.640 --> 3:14:52.480]  and they can implant nano viruses in there so that when it goes and replicates, it then
[3:14:52.480 --> 3:14:57.200]  creates a bunch of different new viruses that are embedded in it. Just like they can compress.
[3:14:57.200 --> 3:15:02.240]  Remember 20 years ago, you could put like 20 songs on an iPad or an iPod when we first
[3:15:02.240 --> 3:15:07.800]  had them. Now it's going to be 50 million songs or whatever. It's the same thing. These
[3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:12.160]  aren't viruses. You hear of a vaccine, you think, oh, that's something that you shoot.
[3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:16.440]  That's, you know, the bad things, but a 10-year-old makes you where you can deal with. No, it
[3:15:16.440 --> 3:15:20.880]  just means something they're putting in you. And so they can now load into a virus in
[3:15:20.880 --> 3:15:25.880]  literature that's about 10 years old because they're always 10 years out of us. And they're
[3:15:25.880 --> 3:15:31.400]  saying, yeah, we could have every disease in the world in one virus. See? And then they
[3:15:31.400 --> 3:15:37.120]  know from lab tests how it replicates and how it mutates. So you get a cold the first
[3:15:37.120 --> 3:15:43.360]  time, then you get the flu, then you get cancer. Isn't that sweet? Just remember Bill Gates
[3:15:43.360 --> 3:15:51.400]  loves you and he's your savior. And so is Ted Turner. And so is Oprah Winfrey when they
[3:15:51.400 --> 3:15:55.840]  have those meetings about killing you. Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon. I'm talking thick

[3:17:54.320 --> 3:18:00.680]  There could no longer be any doubt. The globalists have orchestrated this entire crisis. But
[3:18:00.680 --> 3:18:07.480]  it's not a hoax. The virus is real and the panic it's creating is on a scale never before
[3:18:07.480 --> 3:18:13.600]  seen. It is said in the Bible that the wicked flee when none pursue. But the wicked really
[3:18:13.600 --> 3:18:21.240]  run for their lives when something real is killing people silently and quietly. Ladies
[3:18:21.240 --> 3:18:27.880]  and gentlemen, it's time to pray. It's time to seek God's face. It's time to repent for
[3:18:27.880 --> 3:18:34.280]  the 64 million abortions in America and the 400 million abortions in Communist China and
[3:18:34.280 --> 3:18:40.080]  for all of the Satanism and all of the pedophilia and all of the corruption. Or God is going
[3:18:40.080 --> 3:18:46.120]  to continue to allow the globalist to judge us for him. That's right. God is lifting the
[3:18:46.120 --> 3:18:52.160]  hedge of protection away from the people and allowing Satan and his armies to have their
[3:18:52.160 --> 3:18:53.920]  will with the people.
[3:18:53.920 --> 3:18:58.400]  One of the products that I'm very proud of, I don't talk enough about, because there's
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:03.440]  so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it, it takes a long time to break down
[3:19:03.440 --> 3:19:07.800]  the product because it's a complex product. A lot of the sprays you put in your mouth
[3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:13.160]  for your throat and lungs are really thin. It's a little bit of alcohol if you want it
[3:19:13.160 --> 3:19:20.920]  to essential oils. Not our lung cleanse. It's got a long list of the highest quality essential
[3:19:20.920 --> 3:19:27.440]  oils and ingredients in it. You take a few sprays in your mouth, lightly inhale, and
[3:19:27.440 --> 3:19:33.800]  it just does so much for me when I've got allergies or when my throat is tired. It's
[3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:38.240]  just very, very soothing and it's just one more thing for you and your family to have

[3:19:56.840 --> 3:20:17.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:17.440 --> 3:20:30.760]  I'm going to try to talk about myself, but I've become a symbol in the fight against
[3:20:30.760 --> 3:20:34.560]  the globalists that they try to misrepresent who I am. So I have to tell people who I am
[3:20:34.560 --> 3:20:38.960]  so they can't, at least lie to our listeners and try to turn you away from the broadcast,
[3:20:38.960 --> 3:20:46.800]  but I know you understand what's happening. Now when I'm out in the street, people run
[3:20:46.800 --> 3:20:51.240]  up, they stop their cars, they run up and apologize. I go to the grocery store trying
[3:20:51.240 --> 3:20:55.800]  to get more food and old, young, black, white, liberal, conservative, they come up with tears
[3:20:55.800 --> 3:20:59.360]  in their eyes. They say, you said it all. I thought you were crazy. You're nuts. Martial
[3:20:59.360 --> 3:21:03.160]  Law. You said it. You said it. You're the Oracle of Austin. What's happening next? And
[3:21:03.160 --> 3:21:08.680]  I'm like, I'm not an oracle. They said that we're going to do all this. And so I don't
[3:21:08.680 --> 3:21:16.920]  have some pleasurable attitude now that, oh, look, the martial law and the bio weapon and
[3:21:16.920 --> 3:21:35.640]  the shutdown, my credibility's gone way up. I have a feeling of failure. All I can do
[3:21:35.640 --> 3:21:40.440]  is tell you what I'm really thinking. And we knew all this was going to happen and
[3:21:40.440 --> 3:21:46.000]  we couldn't stop it. We got a president elected that they definitely don't like to try to
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:54.160]  turn things around. We got other folks elected and we're fighting hard, but globalism is
[3:21:54.160 --> 3:22:02.600]  so evil and so stupid. We shouldn't have to go down this road, but you know what? With
[3:22:02.600 --> 3:22:08.680]  great power comes great responsibility to quote the silly Spider-Man tagline, but it's
[3:22:08.680 --> 3:22:15.080]  true. And I'm decadent and weak and I'm on the upper end of functional people. And I'm
[3:22:15.080 --> 3:22:29.240]  in the top 10, the 1% of functional, successful people. And I'm a slob. I'm a piece of crap.
[3:22:29.240 --> 3:22:36.200]  And I go out and I look at the public and I didn't know they could stack crap that high.
[3:22:36.200 --> 3:22:44.320]  And I don't say that to be mean. I say that because they are in a trance. They're asleep.
[3:22:44.320 --> 3:22:48.600]  They've been put in a trance, a medical trance. The studies show they're at near sleep state.
[3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:54.160]  So they're not crap. They're walking around. Have you ever saw somebody sleep walking?
[3:22:54.160 --> 3:23:04.680]  They look like a zombie, but they're not awake. And so I don't take any pleasure in being
[3:23:04.680 --> 3:23:14.120]  proven wrong about this. It's like telling a cousin that's shooting up heroin. Hey, you
[3:23:14.120 --> 3:23:18.520]  do that. You can overdose. And two years later, you get a call. Hey, your cousin's overdosed
[3:23:18.520 --> 3:23:29.520]  and died. You don't go, man, I was right. I told them they were going to die and they
[3:23:29.520 --> 3:23:39.520]  did. No, that's no pleasure in that. In fact, there's only the horror of the unavoidableness.
[3:23:39.520 --> 3:23:43.640]  Society's going to collapse. There's going to be a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.
[3:23:43.640 --> 3:23:48.800]  That's where all the numbers are on. Five years from now, probably. There's been nuclear
[3:23:48.800 --> 3:24:00.320]  winter. There's going to be riots. Everything's going to burn. I mean, that's the timeline.
[3:24:00.320 --> 3:24:06.880]  We're on boys and girls. You can set your watch by it because the globalists and their
[3:24:06.880 --> 3:24:11.240]  think tanks all brag about it. They're all licking their lips. All the big globalists
[3:24:11.240 --> 3:24:15.560]  ran the last two months. They ran two months ago. I remember being on air going, we're
[3:24:15.560 --> 3:24:20.200]  getting reports from private pilots that all the big wigs are running and then their vice
[3:24:20.200 --> 3:24:23.400]  presidents and people that are worth, you know, not five billion or a billion, but worth,
[3:24:23.400 --> 3:24:29.920]  you know, 100 million, they're all running. I told you two months ago, I said, I don't
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:34.480]  know what's going on, but they're about to cause a big war, a bio weapon attack. You
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:38.880]  know, I could have a prize. They $10,000. Whoever goes back two months ago and finds
[3:24:38.880 --> 3:24:44.080]  those interviews, they're only a band off video. They were banned everywhere else. People
[3:24:44.080 --> 3:24:47.240]  like prizes. Somebody would go find the video. I mean, you remember listeners are going,
[3:24:47.240 --> 3:24:56.320]  oh, we heard those shows. I mean, we 100% said, I've talked to private pilots who are
[3:24:56.320 --> 3:25:05.040]  flying to all these weird places and they're being offered jobs in Kauai, Hawaii and Tasmania,
[3:25:05.040 --> 3:25:11.480]  Australia and New Zealand and, and Northern Canada and places where they're just telling
[3:25:11.480 --> 3:25:16.160]  pilots, Hey, we got a helicopter. We got two jets parked out here. They even got some hangers
[3:25:16.160 --> 3:25:20.640]  that look like mountain sides. They pull into, I mean, and these have come out. This has
[3:25:20.640 --> 3:25:24.680]  been the news and they're asking the pilot, Hey, we got cottages for you. Will you just
[3:25:24.680 --> 3:25:28.760]  stay here and the pilots go, what about my wife and kids? When they go to school, they
[3:25:28.760 --> 3:25:37.080]  go, well, we can't bring them, but we'll, we'll pay you just to stay here.
[3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:45.040]  You don't just think all the big wig fancy pants are running off to bunkers two months
[3:25:45.040 --> 3:25:57.920]  ago. Cause they're planning on playing a bunch of 42 or poker. No, I don't know how these
[3:25:57.920 --> 3:26:04.440]  dominoes go in the end, but I knew they were already going down. And let me tell you something,
[3:26:04.440 --> 3:26:13.120]  economic collapse, mass war, it's all on and everybody just better button up and realize
[3:26:13.120 --> 3:26:20.440]  it's not the virus you got to worry about, but you better be concerned because the virus
[3:26:20.440 --> 3:26:24.760]  is the cover for what's coming next. Now I said I'd take calls this segment. I didn't
[3:26:24.760 --> 3:26:28.280]  longer segment coming up. I'm going to take four calls, five calls next segment. I'm
[3:26:28.280 --> 3:26:32.680]  going to go to Diego and William and everybody else have been holding patient. And I'm going
[3:26:32.680 --> 3:26:38.640]  to say this or we won't be here on air. Plus these are products you need. I'm talking to
[3:26:38.640 --> 3:26:43.880]  truck drivers on air, off air. I'm talking to CEOs of major food companies. I'm talking
[3:26:43.880 --> 3:26:50.480]  to a lot of folks and they tell me things are already breaking down with people going home
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:56.160]  and everything's getting behind. And we're already being told on reorder money we have
[3:26:56.160 --> 3:27:02.400]  in for supplements into the future. I have seven company suppliers and our 60 plus products.
[3:27:02.400 --> 3:27:06.960]  And I've already had three companies say we might have to refund your money. We may never
[3:27:06.960 --> 3:27:14.920]  fulfill it. We're going to go bankrupt because of this. So we have all the supplements right
[3:27:14.920 --> 3:27:19.840]  now. We have everything we sell in stock. We stopped food sell yesterday because they
[3:27:19.840 --> 3:27:24.880]  can't project out and don't have food for new orders. They've got food for your orders.
[3:27:24.880 --> 3:27:29.080]  Most people got it. And I think about all these other big food companies I know been
[3:27:29.080 --> 3:27:34.720]  sold out for five, six weeks lying to you, telling you they got food. How about corrupt
[3:27:34.720 --> 3:27:43.360]  companies, man? That's felony activity. The supplements, the super silver, nano silver,
[3:27:43.360 --> 3:27:48.160]  super blue toothpaste is still in. We got the little one ounce that are great for disinfecting
[3:27:48.160 --> 3:27:53.560]  yourself. All the rest of those are back in the 16 ounces are about to sell out. Turmeric
[3:27:53.560 --> 3:27:58.480]  ultimate turmeric formula, the X two, the X three, we've got it all and we got it here.
[3:27:58.480 --> 3:28:05.960]  But a lot of these products could be the final run, depending on how this goes. So I'm just
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:12.920]  telling you the truth that we've got a warehouse and Texas is strong and they're still truck
[3:28:12.920 --> 3:28:17.400]  drivers getting it out, but it's the warehouses breaking down and it's the factories breaking
[3:28:17.400 --> 3:28:24.760]  down. And it's all shutting down. Now I told you four weeks ago there may come a time we
[3:28:24.760 --> 3:28:31.720]  can't sell you food anymore. Came yesterday. You better stock up on X two and X three and
[3:28:31.720 --> 3:28:37.200]  all the other great products. Vaso beats back in stock. We've got DNA force plus back in
[3:28:37.200 --> 3:28:41.120]  stock. These are all incredible things that boost your family and yours defense living
[3:28:41.120 --> 3:28:46.160]  defenses back in to flush out your guts about wanted visitors info war store.com. We're
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:50.320]  gonna stay here till the lights go out. Well, you need to get these products and they also
[3:28:50.320 --> 3:28:56.640]  fund our operation. So take action. Attention all radio listeners who still need food supplies.
[3:28:56.640 --> 3:29:00.560]  If you've thought about the implication of food related supply chain disruptions and
[3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:04.720]  are concerned about the coming quarantines, this will be the most important message you
[3:29:04.720 --> 3:29:10.040]  will ever hear. Here's why in the next few days, all Americans will face extremely hard
[3:29:10.040 --> 3:29:15.680]  choices. If we've learned anything from China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced
[3:29:15.680 --> 3:29:20.880]  lockdowns are just a few days away here in the U. S. Listen, while dehydrated food is
[3:29:20.880 --> 3:29:25.960]  becoming scarce, you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one acre
[3:29:25.960 --> 3:29:31.400]  crisis garden. The truth is growing nutrient dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually
[3:29:31.400 --> 3:29:36.360]  be the single most important thing you do. Go to survival seed bank dot com and watch

[3:29:55.240 --> 3:30:02.680]  disgust and anger as companies across the United States and the world raise prices during
[3:30:02.680 --> 3:30:08.840]  this crisis and gouge their customers. Info wars has done the opposite. Despite the fact
[3:30:08.840 --> 3:30:13.040]  that we've sold out of many of our products and are waiting for others to come back in,

[3:31:08.480 --> 3:31:16.680]  inside the corridors of the mega corporations and tyrannical regimes like China and the
[3:31:16.680 --> 3:31:24.680]  communist party that runs it. There is a raw desire for power and control over people.
[3:31:24.680 --> 3:31:31.120]  And now we learn from an MIT tipster. We even got the documents and we're able to search
[3:31:31.120 --> 3:31:35.560]  them and then discover that it was accurate information actually in the public domain.
[3:31:35.560 --> 3:31:43.400]  The Billimal Indigates are preparing an embedded digital tattoo under your skin to show that

[3:32:57.840 --> 3:33:19.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Alex Jones here back live in defense of liberty
[3:33:19.120 --> 3:33:26.040]  and resistance to tyranny. All right, one of our producers is Darius. He does a great
[3:33:26.040 --> 3:33:30.600]  job. He's a great army veteran and patriot. She's got a lot of family and friends that
[3:33:30.600 --> 3:33:36.040]  work in hospitals. And she was just, I put all these microphones in the studio so the
[3:33:36.040 --> 3:33:40.120]  crew could pop in whenever they want. They'll never do it. But she was telling me all this.
[3:33:40.120 --> 3:33:44.760]  I said, you got to tell folks what you're saying on air about what folks you know are
[3:33:44.760 --> 3:33:50.280]  saying is going on in the hospitals and we'll go to your phone calls. So Daria, go ahead
[3:33:50.280 --> 3:33:53.920]  and tell folks what you were telling us during the break.
[3:33:53.920 --> 3:33:59.560]  Yes. Hey Alex. So yeah, it's been really frustrating. I, for a fact, know people who have whole
[3:33:59.560 --> 3:34:04.160]  families working in hospitals and they are reporting that it's a completely non thing.
[3:34:04.160 --> 3:34:09.600]  There are no deaths. Nobody's dying. Even the elderly that require like even life support
[3:34:09.600 --> 3:34:15.200]  aren't dying. Like nobody, it's, it's, it's complete and total nonsense that's been ginned
[3:34:15.200 --> 3:34:20.880]  up and made up for, you know, actually nobody knows what this actually is for. But the media
[3:34:20.880 --> 3:34:27.520]  is definitely stoking the fear up to get the, the population completely paralyzed with fear
[3:34:27.520 --> 3:34:34.040]  that they do panic buying and creating all these shortages in stores that I mean, where
[3:34:34.040 --> 3:34:42.320]  are we going with this? And to think about for weeks now, I imagine, do you know anybody
[3:34:42.320 --> 3:34:47.240]  or do you know anybody who knows anybody who has died from the so-called coronavirus? I
[3:34:47.240 --> 3:34:52.520]  mean, we're getting the numbers from God knows who, from the people that we already know
[3:34:52.520 --> 3:34:57.880]  not to trust. But don't worry, Bill Gates has an injectable microchip now that'll save
[3:34:57.880 --> 3:35:05.520]  us. Exactly. So not only the tests have been come up by Bill Gates, but this, this new
[3:35:05.520 --> 3:35:09.600]  vaccine that's coming, that I feel like it's going to be mandatory now. And they're going
[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:14.200]  to say, well, definitely take this vaccine. But here's the thing. Europe already passed
[3:35:14.200 --> 3:35:19.080]  laws to do it. So yeah, just one more thing. Even if they tell you the vaccine is mandatory,
[3:35:19.080 --> 3:35:24.040]  the vaccine is not mandatory people. You are a human being, a sentient human being, you
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:29.760]  can say no to anything, you know, in order for them to accomplish what they want to do,
[3:35:29.760 --> 3:35:34.080]  they have to have your consent. So never give you consent to something that you know is
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:38.880]  wrong, even if you're told that that's what you must do. Stand by your beliefs, people.
[3:35:38.880 --> 3:35:41.640]  That's right. And they know that everybody warned Christians about microchips to buy
[3:35:41.640 --> 3:35:47.600]  and sell. So now it's called a digital tattoo. It's actually a nanotech chip sewn into your
[3:35:47.600 --> 3:35:52.920]  flesh. So you talk about Mark of the Beast, man, this is it. Because imagine John the
[3:35:52.920 --> 3:35:58.520]  All of Patmos is being shown the future by God. He sees a mark like an like a birthmark.
[3:35:58.520 --> 3:36:04.080]  It's in it's on the skin. It's a tattoo. That's what the Bible called tattoos was marking
[3:36:04.080 --> 3:36:07.320]  themselves. And in the Old Testament, they said when the society goes down, I'm not bad
[3:36:07.320 --> 3:36:11.760]  at folks that have two tattoos. He said they cut themselves and they mark themselves with
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:14.560]  symbols. And that's just what happens when this goes down.
[3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:18.720]  Hey, Alex, another thing. All those Christians and religious people out there, they should
[3:36:18.720 --> 3:36:24.680]  really think about what this, how this is mocking God, because the plagues are in revelation,
[3:36:24.680 --> 3:36:28.520]  their actual place, you're not going to miss them. Everybody's going to know that it's
[3:36:28.520 --> 3:36:32.600]  a play. You're going to see it in plain sight. You're going to have half your blocks.
[3:36:32.600 --> 3:36:35.920]  Your whole family is going to suffer from it. And this is such a joke. You can't see
[3:36:35.920 --> 3:36:39.840]  it. And everybody's freaking out. The men in this country need to stand the hell up
[3:36:39.840 --> 3:36:45.640]  to this instead of being afraid of some coughs. It's just incredible show start. See what
[3:36:45.640 --> 3:36:52.200]  I get during the breaks. Okay, I'm done. No, I want you to keep going. This is what
[3:36:52.200 --> 3:36:57.440]  we get there. She's damn right. And you know, my big deal is the panic response. Okay, maybe
[3:36:57.440 --> 3:37:01.680]  it's super deadly. We haven't seen the evidence of that. We're just all supposed to panic
[3:37:01.680 --> 3:37:06.080]  headlong and shut everything down. I mean, I'm glad that Trump is now quietly shut this
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:09.400]  other border. That's not got any attention, but he's done that. You better shut that down
[3:37:09.400 --> 3:37:13.240]  first. And the northern border, anything else started?
[3:37:13.240 --> 3:37:18.360]  No, I think it's, I think it's a good thing that I think it's a good thing in the in the
[3:37:18.360 --> 3:37:22.120]  in the way that it has woken people up. The preparedness is really good. People should
[3:37:22.120 --> 3:37:25.560]  take advantage of their kids staying home to reconnect with their kids to think about
[3:37:25.560 --> 3:37:28.960]  homeschooling. There should already be thinking about that. But if they haven't, this is a
[3:37:28.960 --> 3:37:35.320]  real good wake up call. So yeah, prepare yourself. Don't be the money and the time to get a far
[3:37:35.320 --> 3:37:41.440]  outside Austin. I'm done. It's over. I'm I'm we'll still talk about telecommuting. I am
[3:37:41.440 --> 3:37:45.320]  not going to live in the city of evil anymore. And I missed we got a two year plan crew.
[3:37:45.320 --> 3:37:48.240]  We got to start where we're moving. And don't expect the government to be there for you.
[3:37:48.240 --> 3:37:52.920]  The government does not care about you. When was the last time in history that the government
[3:37:52.920 --> 3:37:57.360]  has worried about people's lives? That just doesn't happen. And all of a sudden we are
[3:37:57.360 --> 3:38:02.000]  trusting the government to save us. I mean, people who were totally have total common
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:06.360]  sense in the past week have completely lost all common sense that they used to have for
[3:38:06.360 --> 3:38:08.760]  this. And they're going to be begging for vaccines. They're going to be begging for
[3:38:08.760 --> 3:38:14.320]  government to save them. And it's just it's it's it's very it's very sad to see. I'm going
[3:38:14.320 --> 3:38:19.040]  to call Darius. Thank you for coming on. We're having on every day. Thank you. All the Darius
[3:38:19.040 --> 3:38:25.120]  segment. Baby Putina. All right, let's go ahead and go to Diego in California. Diego,
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:30.680]  you're on the air. Go ahead. All right, Alex, they're paving the way. What do you think's
[3:38:30.680 --> 3:38:36.120]  going on, brother? Oh, and as the question yesterday, two plus two equals five. Here's
[3:38:36.120 --> 3:38:44.080]  the missing factor. May 14, 2020. It's September last year, the full man invitation to all
[3:38:44.080 --> 3:38:51.680]  the world leaders to meet in Rome on May 14, 2020, to sign a pact to re educate the message.
[3:38:51.680 --> 3:38:58.520]  Diseases I mean, as bad as Mike says, and if it is, and if it's used to target the elderly,
[3:38:58.520 --> 3:39:03.720]  because they are the holders of history and they want to take them out. Say that again,
[3:39:03.720 --> 3:39:08.360]  the older the holders of what the holders of history, they want to re educate the masses
[3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:15.480]  of the evil always wants to wipe out the old exactly. And it's on the other hand, it's
[3:39:15.480 --> 3:39:22.480]  manmade. And its purpose is to facilitate our economy and our world and our world wide
[3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:27.800]  so that humanity will be right for the transfer of power from a sovereign population to the
[3:39:27.800 --> 3:39:34.480]  new world order. If this attack is not opposed, and they will win. So on May 14, 2020, just
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:40.840]  remember the creator, the Lord of Noah, God of Abraham, God of Jews and Gentiles, God
[3:39:40.840 --> 3:39:45.800]  of David, God of Elijah, he's the Lord of the seven states, seven, and he is in control.
[3:39:45.800 --> 3:39:51.680]  It is not the end simply contractions of birth. Trump needs to come out against this meeting,
[3:39:51.680 --> 3:39:55.640]  or he is guilty by association by failure to agree, but there's no longer any doubt.
[3:39:55.640 --> 3:40:04.120]  The Bible is being manifest right now before us. It's all coming true in that. Thank you
[3:40:04.120 --> 3:40:10.400]  guys for the red pill. Have a good day. God bless you. Yeah, it's all I mean, I'm just
[3:40:10.400 --> 3:40:13.920]  totally freaked out. It's it's all real. I already knew God was real. I don't like it's
[3:40:13.920 --> 3:40:19.080]  like we're here. I mean, it's just like, wow, I just feel sorry for people that serve the
[3:40:19.080 --> 3:40:25.480]  devil man, because I know about this and I'm scared that I'm not good enough for God. Seriously,
[3:40:25.480 --> 3:40:28.960]  my best works are dirty rags, as the Bible says, because I have a sermon. I can see
[3:40:28.960 --> 3:40:33.160]  how bad I am, but I look at evil people and they are like way worse. And I'm like, man,
[3:40:33.160 --> 3:40:37.080]  you guys have no idea who you're working with. You are in big trouble. William and Oregon,
[3:40:37.080 --> 3:40:42.320]  thanks for holding her on the air worldwide. Go ahead, sir. All right. Hi. Thank you. I
[3:40:42.320 --> 3:40:47.280]  appreciate it. Um, yeah, I've got a lot to say, but I'll just stick to my point. Uh,
[3:40:47.280 --> 3:40:53.360]  the first thing what I called about was how if this turns into a depression, like in 1932,
[3:40:53.360 --> 3:41:01.440]  we had 7 million people died just due to malnutrition. Major university study. Yes. So what is, uh,
[3:41:01.440 --> 3:41:05.800]  Mike Adams, highest estimate, something like 6 million. Well, I made it out to his lowest.
[3:41:05.800 --> 3:41:11.080]  Either way, we have 3 million people now looking at his lower estimates. I think, uh, like
[3:41:11.080 --> 3:41:17.680]  2.16 or something. I mean, look, that's just malnutrition. You know, yeah, 7 million from
[3:41:17.680 --> 3:41:22.160]  starvation malnutrition in the U S or in the Great Depression. That happens now. It's
[3:41:22.160 --> 3:41:30.000]  all going to burn all the people now. It's going to burn. Right. So I'm here in Oregon
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:34.600]  right now and make minutes is like one of the biggest bars in town. I have like five
[3:41:34.600 --> 3:41:38.480]  locations all over the state. They just shut down and they just fired all their employees
[3:41:38.480 --> 3:41:42.520]  because the state, I have a small business too, but look, we don't have any employees.
[3:41:42.520 --> 3:41:46.520]  But the, uh, they just sent out a notice that if you have employees, you have to keep paying
[3:41:46.520 --> 3:41:50.840]  them, even though they go home. So nobody can do it. They're just trying to collapse
[3:41:50.840 --> 3:41:55.400]  the side right now. Oh, there's no doubt they're trying to use it to collapse society. So that's
[3:41:55.400 --> 3:41:59.200]  what I'm saying. I'm not saying the virus isn't real. I'm saying it's synthetic how
[3:41:59.200 --> 3:42:03.040]  they're trying to collapse everything. I don't know how Trump threads that needle, but I
[3:42:03.040 --> 3:42:08.600]  think overall he's done a pretty good job. Yes, sir. I agree. I mean, he's doing, I don't
[3:42:08.600 --> 3:42:15.240]  know. I think it's a hard one. Um, I, I liked the way that UK was going before they changed
[3:42:15.240 --> 3:42:18.160]  their route where they were saying there's going to make the old people and the people
[3:42:18.160 --> 3:42:23.640]  at risk go home. So it decided he can continue and our economy continues. So that's kind
[3:42:23.640 --> 3:42:28.360]  of where I'm at. Um, well, here's the key to everything. China says open for business
[3:42:28.360 --> 3:42:33.640]  problem over. So whether it's real or not, they're using it as a weapon to shut us down
[3:42:33.640 --> 3:42:38.800]  and thinking we'd all panic and piss ourselves like a bunch of cowards. And right now the
[3:42:38.800 --> 3:42:43.600]  average American I run into is not pissing their pants, but the establishment shut everything
[3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:53.440]  down to make us panic. It's a real test of boys versus men. Barney, you're up next. Info
[3:42:53.440 --> 3:42:59.480]  wars has had to suspend all new food sales because the supply chain has collapsed. This
[3:42:59.480 --> 3:43:06.400]  is a system wide problem. And this country is facing a new depression unless Trump and
[3:43:06.400 --> 3:43:12.800]  the American people work together to develop a plan to expose this globalist operation.
[3:43:12.800 --> 3:43:18.480]  That's it. People are calling and saying we wish you had the supplements in stock. We
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:23.800]  wish that wasn't sold out. They've confused that with the food. Everything we advertise
[3:43:23.800 --> 3:43:30.960]  everything we sell, we have in stock and we are only one day behind in shipping. That
[3:43:30.960 --> 3:43:35.040]  means if you order on a Monday, it's shipping out on a Wednesday. And that's just as of
[3:43:35.040 --> 3:43:41.040]  today. Most days we are up to the day shipping, meaning you order that day in the morning.
[3:43:41.040 --> 3:43:48.440]  A lot of times it ships out that afternoon. We have everything in stock that is so good
[3:43:48.440 --> 3:43:54.680]  to boost your overall defense against what's going on. We've all watched with disgust and
[3:43:54.680 --> 3:44:02.000]  anger as companies across the United States and the world raise prices during this crisis
[3:44:02.000 --> 3:44:07.600]  and gouge their customers. Info wars has done the opposite. Despite the fact that we've
[3:44:07.600 --> 3:44:12.560]  sold out of many of our products and are waiting for others to come back in, we have kept all

[3:44:56.120 --> 3:45:02.280]  by politicians from Germany and the United States. Thank God coronavirus is here. Thank
[3:45:02.280 --> 3:45:07.200]  God it's going to kill the old people. Thank the heavens that we're going to depopulate
[3:45:07.200 --> 3:45:15.040]  the planet because humanity is horrible. Humanity is evil. All the Hollywood movies,
[3:45:15.040 --> 3:45:20.840]  all the propaganda, all the U.N. statements, all the Ted Turner and Prince Philip garbage
[3:45:20.840 --> 3:45:25.720]  saying that they want to use a deadly virus to depopulate and control the population and
[3:45:25.720 --> 3:45:31.280]  now it's here and they want to lock down society and are licking their lips and saying Trump
[3:45:31.280 --> 3:45:35.760]  isn't doing enough. What a sickening in your face declaration
[3:45:35.760 --> 3:45:41.560]  of war against humanity by these control freaks who think it's their right to put fluoride
[3:45:41.560 --> 3:45:47.760]  in the water, give us toxic vaccines, openly dumb us down and when we resist call us terrorists
[3:45:47.760 --> 3:45:51.920]  and conspiracy theorists when they're publicly admitting their plan to exterminate everyone.
[3:45:51.920 --> 3:45:57.360]  It's time to expose the scum. It was like a bad dream seven weeks ago, the ghost cities
[3:45:57.360 --> 3:46:02.920]  in China that then spread to Europe and now San Francisco is a ghost city and we see
[3:46:02.920 --> 3:46:08.720]  fights and brawls taking place over toilet paper. People don't need toilet paper to survive
[3:46:08.720 --> 3:46:14.320]  but people do need high quality water filtration and they need high quality supplementation
[3:46:14.320 --> 3:46:23.000]  by products like DNA Force Plus, X2 and X3, bodies, ultimate turmeric formula and of course

[3:47:18.560 --> 3:47:29.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, Top Fox News report. In fact, back it up just minutes ago. 7,000
[3:47:29.400 --> 3:47:39.160]  infected in America. The entire economy shut down. Over 100 dead. The end of America. You
[3:47:39.160 --> 3:47:43.680]  know, I have actually studied the historical record of the Pacific War. It was very interesting
[3:47:43.680 --> 3:47:50.840]  and there were about 80 planes that went out off the four U.S. aircraft carriers and it
[3:47:50.840 --> 3:47:55.640]  was five or six of the pilots, they were all very valiant that actually sunk the aircraft
[3:47:55.640 --> 3:48:01.480]  carriers. It was a handful of the dudes that would actually go in. A lot tried and got
[3:48:01.480 --> 3:48:08.560]  killed but they found it was the same dudes kept sinking the other ships. There was one
[3:48:08.560 --> 3:48:11.640]  guy when everybody else missed. It's in the movie Midway. It's a great movie. It's very
[3:48:11.640 --> 3:48:17.080]  accurate. He sunk two carriers by himself. Half the carriers of the Japanese went down
[3:48:17.080 --> 3:48:25.600]  from one dude because he wasn't afraid. And he had bad oxygen that destroyed his lungs
[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:32.600]  and almost killed him, but he still did it. And that's who I'm looking for is the people
[3:48:32.600 --> 3:48:42.960]  that are ready to politically destroy. Because if you go into a fight, 90%, you lose. You
[3:48:42.960 --> 3:48:48.640]  go into a fight, 300%, you win. 400%. And I used to hear that one as a kid, 110% from
[3:48:48.640 --> 3:48:53.800]  coaches, I went, that's ridiculous. 100%, 100%. No, 100% is what you think you can do. Instead
[3:48:53.800 --> 3:49:02.240]  of shooting for 110, shoot for 5,000%. And I've experienced that. I have shot for that
[3:49:02.240 --> 3:49:10.600]  and you hit that moment in your life and they can't stop you. But you're always trying to
[3:49:10.600 --> 3:49:15.520]  get back to that moment once you've hit that magic place. It's like that Normals Barkley
[3:49:15.520 --> 3:49:22.800]  song about there was so much space. Once you go crazy because you're not constrained, you're
[3:49:22.800 --> 3:49:29.440]  not crazy, you're now awake. A lot of people wake up though and they go insane because
[3:49:29.440 --> 3:49:38.160]  they can't handle it. I know why people want to stay in the dark because they can't handle
[3:49:38.160 --> 3:49:47.280]  it. But I'm going to stop talking. Let's just jam in the calls, like I said I do. Barney
[3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:51.280]  in Arizona, thanks for holding her on the air. Welcome. You're very welcome. Can you
[3:49:51.280 --> 3:49:55.280]  hear me all right, Alex? I can, brother. Great phone. Thank you for calling. Oh, you're so
[3:49:55.280 --> 3:49:59.920]  welcome. I've been listening a long time. I talk fast like you do. I've done door-to-door
[3:49:59.920 --> 3:50:04.080]  sales for 13 years all around the country. It's been about 12 years in Texas. I never
[3:50:04.080 --> 3:50:09.560]  came to say hi. I'm sorry, but I don't know about the coronavirus. Oh, my man. No one's
[3:50:09.560 --> 3:50:15.160]  talking about control factors of the virus. I'm looking at it in my own mind as a control
[3:50:15.160 --> 3:50:20.920]  one, control two type of deal, maybe. Control one is the coronavirus. It's got the HIV delivery
[3:50:20.920 --> 3:50:25.320]  system. They aerosol to COVID-19. No one's thinking about what if a bio-weapon comes
[3:50:25.320 --> 3:50:29.760]  out? Control number two, baseline number one's in the bloodstream everywhere, not that legal.
[3:50:29.760 --> 3:50:33.800]  But what happens when they aerosol HIV? When you already got the receptor cells with the
[3:50:33.800 --> 3:50:37.680]  perfect geometry for the contracted lungs, and then all of a sudden you have that.
[3:50:37.680 --> 3:50:43.840]  Well, I think you should be a guest in the war room coming up. No, exactly. I look at
[3:50:43.840 --> 3:50:49.040]  the different angles of this. They've got other stuff loaded and other versions. And
[3:50:49.040 --> 3:50:54.120]  once we capitulate to this virus, then once they know we're going to behave, because loblos
[3:50:54.120 --> 3:50:57.640]  don't want to disturb stuff. They want us under control following orders before they
[3:50:57.640 --> 3:51:08.800]  release the big one. And so everyone conforming and they are conjuring the real bio attack.
[3:51:08.800 --> 3:51:13.080]  The primer is getting everybody to not believe in God and Jesus Christ, to really conform
[3:51:13.080 --> 3:51:16.320]  and really rely on the government and not look inward. And everything that comes from
[3:51:16.320 --> 3:51:20.880]  the black hole at center point has perfect order and map. That's where God is evident,
[3:51:20.880 --> 3:51:25.200]  right? So it's really trying to make sure we are staying awake and tune in to self and
[3:51:25.200 --> 3:51:28.800]  making sure that... And there's so much to say, Alex. I'm just trying to stick to the
[3:51:28.800 --> 3:51:29.800]  original point.
[3:51:29.800 --> 3:51:32.680]  No, but you're right. When you actually see through God's eyes for just a second, you
[3:51:32.680 --> 3:51:36.520]  see perfection. It's like... And then you see how it all works together. Like, this
[3:51:36.520 --> 3:51:41.120]  is incredible. How would you... It's not like you even... You still have free will, but
[3:51:41.120 --> 3:51:44.400]  you obviously go with it because it's what makes sense.
[3:51:44.400 --> 3:51:49.680]  Correct. And so, looking at the science too, I'm just a nerd trying to be... I'm doorknocking
[3:51:49.680 --> 3:51:53.680]  out no main constructs to really develop into like college or anything. So I'm all self
[3:51:53.680 --> 3:51:58.280]  learning it if you will for whatever you want to call me. However, looking through the end
[3:51:58.280 --> 3:52:03.800]  of natural science, quantum, physics, physics, it's all the answers are being held hostage
[3:52:03.800 --> 3:52:04.800]  by beautiful...
[3:52:04.800 --> 3:52:08.040]  Well, that's right. And they're holding us hostage before we break through the clouds
[3:52:08.040 --> 3:52:13.440]  and go, whoa, and see God. Because it won't just be... We feel God spiritually at a dimensional
[3:52:13.440 --> 3:52:18.280]  level. When we physically can see it and we break through the clouds, the devil and all
[3:52:18.280 --> 3:52:23.400]  his systems will be a joke. Great points. God bless you. Powerful.
[3:52:23.400 --> 3:52:29.840]  Michelle in Mississippi, you're awesome for holding them. I've gone the order received.
[3:52:29.840 --> 3:52:31.960]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:52:31.960 --> 3:52:41.080]  Yes. That's a good segue because my view on this is that Event 201 really almost stands
[3:52:41.080 --> 3:52:49.520]  for something hiding in plain view the year 2020, part one. I think the virus in and of
[3:52:49.520 --> 3:52:55.440]  itself is a biological kill switch that pretty much will be embedded into all of us because
[3:52:55.440 --> 3:53:05.520]  of its airborne transmission and that the 5G probably coincides with the way to activate
[3:53:05.520 --> 3:53:13.120]  Event 202, so to speak. 5G, I don't know if you remember the videos coming out of China
[3:53:13.120 --> 3:53:17.640]  if they were even real with people dropping dead and engulfing and...
[3:53:17.640 --> 3:53:22.760]  Well, do they admit studies that 5G resonates your body and allows viruses to pass through
[3:53:22.760 --> 3:53:23.960]  the cells?
[3:53:23.960 --> 3:53:30.480]  Exactly. And I'm wondering if the few videos we've seen of these people dying in such a
[3:53:30.480 --> 3:53:37.080]  violent way are people that were, unfortunately, guinea pigs of the Chinese where they decided,
[3:53:37.080 --> 3:53:40.000]  okay, or maybe he was near a 5G tower. I don't know.
[3:53:40.000 --> 3:53:43.960]  Oh, the Chicombs said we want nuclear war. We want to kill our people.
[3:53:43.960 --> 3:53:44.960]  Right.
[3:53:44.960 --> 3:53:49.320]  They've killed 50 million of their own girls, aborted 400 million. They love it.
[3:53:49.320 --> 3:53:55.000]  Yes. They're not afraid to experiment on their own people or to kill anybody, quite frankly.
[3:53:55.000 --> 3:54:00.800]  And then here in Mississippi, I don't know if you're aware, but Trump back in February
[3:54:00.800 --> 3:54:05.560]  of 2019, along with the chairman of the FCC allocated $20 billion to something called
[3:54:05.560 --> 3:54:15.400]  the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, and that essentially is rolling out 5G to all rural
[3:54:15.400 --> 3:54:21.520]  areas in the country or whoever needs it. And back at the start of the year before COVID-19
[3:54:21.520 --> 3:54:28.200]  was even in our vocabulary, a local radio program here in Mississippi was, you know,
[3:54:28.200 --> 3:54:32.960]  essentially touting how wonderful that would be for the state. There was a county supervisor
[3:54:32.960 --> 3:54:33.960]  on.
[3:54:33.960 --> 3:54:37.520]  You know, it was terrible. Good old boys have a habit of shooting road signs with shotguns.
[3:54:37.520 --> 3:54:42.520]  And I just hope nobody out in the country shoots up with a shotgun so they don't hurt
[3:54:42.520 --> 3:54:46.640]  neighbors, shoots up those 5G. I just hope that doesn't happen.
[3:54:46.640 --> 3:54:53.880]  Yeah, me neither. Wouldn't that be a shame? But Dr. Boyle also had good points about this
[3:54:53.880 --> 3:54:58.880]  being very political because I think election fraud is very possible with this, with the
[3:54:58.880 --> 3:55:04.080]  new shelter at home initiatives that they're rolling out, they're going to have possibly
[3:55:04.080 --> 3:55:08.960]  could hold the national election online somehow with Hillary's called for that.
[3:55:08.960 --> 3:55:12.680]  No, yeah. And then they can do total fraud that way. You're absolutely right. This is
[3:55:12.680 --> 3:55:18.360]  the big tech trying to take over. I'm out of time, Michelle. Steve, Tony, Wesley, Dustin,
[3:55:18.360 --> 3:55:21.960]  I took probably 20 something calls today, but I didn't get to you. I apologize. Owen
[3:55:21.960 --> 3:55:26.240]  shroyer is coming up right now in the war room. If John, just remind me tomorrow because
[3:55:26.240 --> 3:55:30.240]  I have my memories. Good. But I forget stuff. I'll call these callers first thing tomorrow
[3:55:30.240 --> 3:55:33.800]  and go to them first, or we can hold them over. If the war room wants to go to them,
[3:55:33.800 --> 3:55:37.160]  we can take their calls. But I apologize to you.
[3:55:37.160 --> 3:55:45.160]  Let's do Dustin the last two minutes, actually. Dustin, time to take action instead of running
[3:55:45.160 --> 3:55:51.160]  and hiding. Dustin, you close it out for us. Go ahead. I'm here. Hey, it is an absolute
[3:55:51.160 --> 3:55:54.440]  honor to talk to you, Alex. Don't honor to talk to you. We got a minute and a half, brother
[3:55:54.440 --> 3:56:01.000]  hit him. Okay. I don't understand. You know, I came in here and I was wanting to talk about
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:05.040]  something else, but a couple of the callers have have really changed what I wanted to
[3:56:05.040 --> 3:56:13.320]  say. I understand. You said it. We need to attack those 5g things. We need to attack.
[3:56:13.320 --> 3:56:18.120]  It's it's it's attack time. It's any time for us to sit here and talk anymore. I'll
[3:56:18.120 --> 3:56:22.780]  tell you, we don't kill humans, but no, no, no, no, no. Certain point, certain point these
[3:56:22.780 --> 3:56:32.200]  damn machines are in the hands of the globalist. Go ahead. Right. I just have my first born
[3:56:32.200 --> 3:56:38.320]  son. I got three girls and I have my boy and I'll be damned if I'm going to sit
[3:56:38.320 --> 3:56:44.240]  here and let all this go on and I just sit here in my basement and you know
[3:56:44.240 --> 3:56:50.040]  wonder what's going to go on. It's time to take action. Well I don't want any
[3:56:50.040 --> 3:56:54.080]  violence to happen to any of this equipment. It's better to go get your
[3:56:54.080 --> 3:57:00.360]  city council to pass the law against it. Towns are passing laws. Please Dustin
[3:57:00.360 --> 3:57:05.200]  don't go out and attack 5G and certainly don't get in trouble for doing it.
[3:57:05.200 --> 3:57:09.480]  I mean I don't want you to do it but if you're going to do it, be smart about it.
[3:57:09.480 --> 3:57:14.080]  We just sit here and we do nothing about it. Let me tell you something son and I
[3:57:14.080 --> 3:57:19.120]  say son myself. I hear you brother. I've done playing games but listen we're
[3:57:19.120 --> 3:57:22.420]  going to win this fight. The biggest thing you can do is spread the word about
[3:57:22.420 --> 3:57:25.400]  Implore Wars to get this message out. People are ready to hear the truth right
[3:57:25.400 --> 3:57:31.080]  now. Listen let's not go shoot up cell towers okay. Let's not do that. But when
[3:57:31.080 --> 3:57:34.840]  the revolution starts just like they did in Taiwan that's what they did. They
[3:57:34.840 --> 3:57:38.200]  pulled them down. You want to shut the globalists down? You tear down their
[3:57:38.200 --> 3:57:46.160]  little robot spies but don't do that. Listen to me very very carefully. I am
[3:57:46.160 --> 3:57:51.800]  involved at very high levels with supply chain management and talk to a lot of
[3:57:51.800 --> 3:57:56.560]  executives and they are confirming to me that the supply chain is starting to
[3:57:56.560 --> 3:58:01.080]  break down because they're running out of the raw materials for food and things
[3:58:01.080 --> 3:58:07.160]  like high quality supplements that boost you and your family's defense. Ladies
[3:58:07.160 --> 3:58:13.560]  and gentlemen you need to get your orders in now at mfullwarstore.com for
[3:58:13.560 --> 3:58:21.760]  X2, X3, living defense, DNA Force Plus and all the other great products. Many of
[3:58:21.760 --> 3:58:27.040]  them are about to sell out in the next few days to the next few weeks. Others
[3:58:27.040 --> 3:58:31.200]  are going to be running out as well in the next month and we're not sure if
[3:58:31.200 --> 3:58:35.920]  we'll ever be able to get them again in the foreseeable future. That's how crazy
[3:58:35.920 --> 3:58:39.360]  all of this is. So stock up on the supplements that you and your family
[3:58:39.360 --> 3:58:45.840]  need and fund the info war. Take action now. There could no longer be any doubt.
[3:58:45.840 --> 3:58:51.880]  The globalists have orchestrated this entire crisis but it's not a hoax. The
[3:58:51.880 --> 3:58:57.520]  virus is real and the panic it's creating is on a scale never before seen.
[3:58:57.520 --> 3:59:02.880]  It is said in the Bible that the wicked flee when none pursue but the wicked
[3:59:02.880 --> 3:59:08.760]  really run for their lives when something real is killing people silently
[3:59:08.760 --> 3:59:14.960]  and quietly. Ladies and gentlemen it's time to pray. It's time to seek God's
[3:59:14.960 --> 3:59:20.760]  face. It's time to repent for the 64 million abortions in America and the
[3:59:20.760 --> 3:59:25.960]  400 million abortions in Communist China and for all of the Satanism and all of
[3:59:25.960 --> 3:59:31.240]  the pedophilia and all of the corruption or God is going to continue to allow the
[3:59:31.240 --> 3:59:36.480]  globalist to judge us for him. That's right. God is lifting the hedge of
[3:59:36.480 --> 3:59:41.800]  protection away from the people and allowing Satan and his armies to have
[3:59:41.800 --> 3:59:45.040]  their will with the people.
[3:59:45.040 --> 4:00:13.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
