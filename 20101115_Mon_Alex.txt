[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:35.960]  ladies and gentlemen we are live it is Monday the 15th day of November 2010 on
[00:35.960 --> 00:42.360]  yesterday Sunday broadcast I didn't really get into the TSA but today we're
[00:42.360 --> 00:45.760]  going to be discussing it in great detail and also getting into the economy
[00:45.760 --> 00:51.720]  and the ongoing investigation of what happened on 9-11 that is all coming up
[00:51.720 --> 00:58.360]  but there have been giant developments on the mullah station frisk that are going
[00:58.360 --> 01:07.120]  on and the naked body scanners Steve Watson is writing a detailed report
[01:07.120 --> 01:13.960]  right now for prisonplanet.com and info wars.com that is the most important
[01:13.960 --> 01:21.000]  piece of the puzzle in this ongoing saga now for those that ask why do you
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.160]  cover this so much because it's now one of if not the biggest stories in the
[01:25.160 --> 01:30.560]  world it's a substantive story forced out into the mainstream by the
[01:30.560 --> 01:36.400]  alternative media and if the globalist are able to put these naked body
[01:36.400 --> 01:42.360]  scanners in all the airports and train us to submit to it and train us to submit
[01:42.360 --> 01:46.320]  to having our women and children have their crotches and breasts grabbed and
[01:46.320 --> 01:52.920]  ourselves having our crotches grabbed they can get away with anything this is
[01:52.920 --> 02:00.600]  social conditioning period and Homeland Security now admits that but just about
[02:00.600 --> 02:04.840]  30 minutes ago live on CNN will play this clip when we come back they had Mr.
[02:04.840 --> 02:14.020]  Pistol the head of the TSA on the minion of big sis Janet Napolitano and the
[02:14.020 --> 02:20.920]  reporters said well why do you trust a pilot to fly a plane but you want to
[02:20.920 --> 02:26.680]  frisk him and touch their genitals and and the head of the TSA when confronted
[02:26.680 --> 02:30.840]  with common sense see they try to just get away with this stuff and they know
[02:30.840 --> 02:34.360]  the more brazen the more they can get away with the more you'll accept in the
[02:34.360 --> 02:45.080]  future we're being brought into submission we're being dominated so Mr. Pistol
[02:45.080 --> 02:49.800]  the head of the TSA says well yes I don't want to announce this now but he's
[02:49.800 --> 02:54.080]  like a deer in the headlights hit with common sense and notice just seeing in
[02:54.080 --> 02:57.560]  two weeks ago was saying how great the naked body scans were they were saying
[02:57.560 --> 03:03.920]  how great it was to be frisk but now they have a Reuters poll 97% of over
[03:03.920 --> 03:14.000]  60,000 respondents say that they are not going to fly because of this CNN admits
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.280]  they're losing over 9 billion a year just in lost travel and I'll guarantee it's
[03:17.280 --> 03:21.560]  worse than that in the US alone foreign travel the US is down by over a third
[03:21.560 --> 03:29.680]  killing commerce killing tourism that's the plan so I want to walk through why
[03:29.680 --> 03:35.400]  this is so important but but there they are starting to capitulate okay yes the
[03:35.400 --> 03:39.000]  pilots are trusted yes they do fly the plane I don't want to make the
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.400]  announcement now but yes we're getting ready to you know have a lighter
[03:43.400 --> 03:49.800]  frisk of them because you see this is a strike a worker strike if the flight
[03:49.800 --> 03:53.440]  attendants and pilots say you know what I'm not having some minimum wage person
[03:53.440 --> 03:58.440]  on a power trip grab my genitals that's already happening all the major unions
[03:58.440 --> 04:02.720]  are saying it's over and they went into meetings Friday with Napolitano and she
[04:02.720 --> 04:07.920]  said I don't care at all is going to continue and now she put out a USA Today
[04:07.920 --> 04:15.600]  report today that is all lies and I I got in this morning and I was reading it
[04:15.600 --> 04:22.320]  I got in about 7 30 this morning here to the office and it's just all lies and it
[04:22.320 --> 04:30.160]  made my head spin because there's so many lies like she says John Hopkins
[04:30.160 --> 04:34.200]  University has certified that the scanners are safe and I went I went
[04:34.200 --> 04:38.320]  wait a minute I just read John Hopkins in the French news agency their
[04:38.320 --> 04:41.160]  radiation department radiology department saying these things are very
[04:41.160 --> 04:47.040]  dangerous and then I dug in my stack and there it was it's all lies wait till I
[04:47.040 --> 04:52.680]  go I mean it did that's the big scandal it is how much disdain they have for us

[08:12.040 --> 08:19.560]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[08:19.560 --> 08:23.120]  Alex Jones
[08:23.120 --> 08:29.200]  the social engineers that are building this new world order have been pushing
[08:29.200 --> 08:35.800]  and pushing and doing more and more outrageous things trying to sell us on
[08:35.800 --> 08:43.080]  tyranny always how they're doing it for our own good oh we don't care if the
[08:43.080 --> 08:46.840]  majority of flyers and major polls don't want to be naked body scanned or
[08:46.840 --> 08:50.400]  don't want to have their genitals squeezed we're doing this to protect
[08:50.400 --> 08:57.480]  passengers when passengers are flyers and there's a full spectrum of this I
[08:57.480 --> 08:59.880]  want to cover because I didn't really get into it yesterday and there's been
[08:59.880 --> 09:04.760]  big developments since then but the overall issue is this the American
[09:04.760 --> 09:10.000]  people are learning how to find their spine again the American people are
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.600]  learning how to get angry again the American people are learning how to say
[09:14.600 --> 09:21.320]  no and use common sense again for years they've done the scans and the pat downs
[09:21.320 --> 09:26.960]  at select airports of pilots why would you trust a pilot to fly a plane if
[09:26.960 --> 09:31.880]  they could use as a weapon or crash if you don't trust them to go through
[09:31.880 --> 09:38.200]  security without being searched this is about the federal government engage in
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.240]  a giant power grab over the 9th and 10th amendment of states rights it's about
[09:43.240 --> 09:49.400]  the seizure of the infrastructure and commerce in this country the power to
[09:49.400 --> 09:55.480]  control the roads and the airwaves the airways is the power to destroy and it
[09:55.480 --> 10:00.080]  is a huge federal power grab over the states homeland security for years has
[10:00.080 --> 10:05.040]  already had drills and real operations at checkpoints on highways bus
[10:05.040 --> 10:10.120]  terminals train stations from Houston Texas to Boston Massachusetts from
[10:10.120 --> 10:16.200]  Los Angeles California to Las Vegas Nevada they are doing it everywhere and
[10:16.200 --> 10:22.360]  announcing see oh if there's a printer bomb or you know the other type of bomb
[10:22.360 --> 10:28.120]  in a city at a shopping mall that's it TSA's got to come take it over you've
[10:28.120 --> 10:32.040]  got to go through it if there's ever a bombing on a highway sorry from now on
[10:32.040 --> 10:38.040]  to get in your car you've got to go through a security check I'm not joking
[10:38.040 --> 10:43.640]  Toyota and others for years have talked about live cameras in your car hooked to
[10:43.640 --> 10:48.440]  the police department and kill switches being designed into the cars this is all
[10:48.440 --> 10:54.160]  now being announced this is a total electronic straightjacket by the people
[10:54.160 --> 10:58.400]  that want to protect us yeah they want to protect their milk cows they want to
[10:58.400 --> 11:02.160]  make sure that we produce for them and that we don't have an underground
[11:02.160 --> 11:06.160]  economy you notice we see reports every week before again these latest
[11:06.160 --> 11:10.760]  developments on the TSA because it all ties together and this ongoing revolt we
[11:10.760 --> 11:14.480]  see articles every week oh little girls had a lemonade stand in their
[11:14.480 --> 11:18.600]  neighborhood they were fined hundreds and hundreds of dollars and threatened
[11:18.600 --> 11:25.160]  with jail because a code enforcer saw it and came after them listen prisoner you
[11:25.160 --> 11:29.200]  don't have a garage sale without paying us money listen prisoner you don't mow
[11:29.200 --> 11:37.160]  yards for cash listen prisoner you don't do anything that we say you can't oh the
[11:37.160 --> 11:44.280]  illegal aliens are offended in Texas and Arizona and New Mexico and California and
[11:44.280 --> 11:49.080]  Colorado by American flags they pull them down everywhere they see them and on
[11:49.080 --> 11:53.000]  Veterans Day a 13-year-old flies an American flag on the back of his bike
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.160]  well he's told he can't have the bike and it's right here on KCRA television
[12:00.160 --> 12:05.840]  that that the illegal aliens say they don't like the American flag I mean
[12:05.840 --> 12:12.680]  again in America the good guys are the bad guys you understand that because the
[12:12.680 --> 12:17.760]  globalists run the country they hate this country as well and we're supposed
[12:17.760 --> 12:21.560]  to be politically correct and go oh Mexico teaches in schools to hate the
[12:21.560 --> 12:26.880]  US Mexico teaches that the Southwest was stolen from them Mexico you know is
[12:26.880 --> 12:31.640]  this narco terrorist collapsed state but we better not have American flags as it
[12:31.640 --> 12:36.120]  offends the illegal aliens who are now basically half the population of
[12:36.120 --> 12:42.720]  California those new statistics just came out it's amazing and here's another
[12:42.720 --> 12:47.280]  one and I'm gonna put this up on screen if we can and show this this slime ball
[12:47.280 --> 12:55.000]  Michael Wolfson son it says Newcastle Councilman calls cops on boys cupcake
[12:55.000 --> 13:04.120]  sale I'm always seeing crazy stuff out of Newcastle this is Newcastle New York
[13:04.120 --> 13:09.680]  there's another one in Pennsylvania I see crazy stuff out of and it says New
[13:09.680 --> 13:17.760] castle Councilman calls cops on boys cupcake sale when Andrew the Marchess
[13:17.760 --> 13:23.080]  and Kevin Graff two thirteen-year-olds from Seven Bridges Middle School set up
[13:23.080 --> 13:28.680]  a shop at the Guinerary Park on a fall weekend last month they were expecting a
[13:28.680 --> 13:33.160]  tidy profit instead the two want to be entrepreneurs selling cupcakes cookies
[13:33.160 --> 13:45.040]  brownies and rice crispy treats for one dollar a piece got a good taste of hard
[13:45.040 --> 13:51.400]  bureaucracy and it goes on Newcastle Councilman Michael Wolfson came up and
[13:51.400 --> 13:56.400]  came upon the sale and called the cops on the kids for operating without a
[13:56.400 --> 14:03.360]  license and it just goes on from there and there he is see he's a he's your master
[14:03.360 --> 14:09.000]  he's your owner and everything has to go through him there's no commerce unless
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.200]  he gets his slice is cut and most of the money in our cities and counties and
[14:13.200 --> 14:18.560]  states goes to pay the national debt even if you're a state government or a
[14:18.560 --> 14:24.480]  local government they've invested in the derivatives that private debt and so
[14:24.480 --> 14:30.320]  most the money's gone and these city council people they play off public
[14:30.320 --> 14:35.760]  ignorance that's their that's their credo is that they know the public doesn't
[14:35.760 --> 14:39.800]  know that the budget is only one part of the money they tell you about that's
[14:39.800 --> 14:44.600]  that's their expenditures not their total receipts and investments which is the
[14:44.600 --> 14:51.000]  annual comprehensive financial report so they don't tell you that and so this
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.360]  guy literally sees everybody as his property and he sees children selling
[14:55.360 --> 15:00.120]  cupcakes that's not gonna be allowed now I'll guarantee you in his town they're
[15:00.120 --> 15:03.760]  illegal aliens driving without driver's license without insurance working
[15:03.760 --> 15:08.200]  without paying social security he automatically knows in land of the
[15:08.200 --> 15:13.440]  coward home of the slaves that that's okay because that's part of the plan the
[15:13.440 --> 15:16.880]  government teamed up with the third world labor to drive down the wages and
[15:16.880 --> 15:22.200]  consolidate control but he sees some young citizens selling cupcakes it's
[15:22.200 --> 15:27.520]  over and so he didn't just come up and say hey kids you need to get a license
[15:27.520 --> 15:33.760]  to do this he called the police he called his enforcers hey kid don't have
[15:33.760 --> 15:38.040]  that American flag on your bike don't have an American flag on your shirt and
[15:38.040 --> 15:44.360]  we're gonna suspend you we're gonna expel you remember up in San Francisco
[15:44.360 --> 15:48.520]  turned out most of the kids were in American flags were Hispanic and the
[15:48.520 --> 15:53.680]  school had a policy look you don't you don't wear American flags and first the
[15:53.680 --> 15:58.240]  media said well that was only on Cinco de Mayo no it's any day just like this
[15:58.240 --> 16:02.560]  new report shows in another town in California a small town you don't and
[16:02.560 --> 16:09.880]  then they admit they said well the Hispanic students didn't like the
[16:09.880 --> 16:17.960]  American flag they're offended by it that's in the KTXL update on this wait a
[16:17.960 --> 16:21.880]  minute I mean Hispanics that that's just a media term that's somebody from
[16:21.880 --> 16:25.800]  Puerto Rico somebody from Brazil somebody from Argentina Guatemala
[16:25.800 --> 16:32.320]  Nicaragua El Salvador or for that matter I guess you could say it could be
[16:32.320 --> 16:38.920]  somebody from Spain Latin so see how the media says all Hispanics won open
[16:38.920 --> 16:43.360]  borders the actual polls show over 70 plus percent don't but no they don't
[16:43.360 --> 16:53.520]  call this what it is this is highly nationalistic America hating games see
[16:53.520 --> 16:59.480]  Mexico isn't the old-fashioned tyranny that it was decades ago where there
[16:59.480 --> 17:02.960]  were hard-working folks down there and there was just some corruption over
[17:02.960 --> 17:07.920]  them Mexico has doubled its population it's a hellhole now the people are all
[17:07.920 --> 17:12.800]  fighting with each other down there the number one the sales item is bullet
[17:12.800 --> 17:19.080]  proof cars that's the big boom down there 28,000 dead in the last two years
[17:19.080 --> 17:26.520]  that's worse than you know per year in Vietnam and the illegals are up here and
[17:26.520 --> 17:32.080]  then and they see a bunch of fat weak domesticated cowardly Americans who are
[17:32.080 --> 17:36.080]  trained to lick boots up and down nobody worldwide puts up with their wife and
[17:36.080 --> 17:39.200]  children have their generals grab North Korea doesn't even do that unless you
[17:39.200 --> 17:45.440]  been arrested I've gone and looked it up see we we're so into how free we are and
[17:45.440 --> 17:49.120]  how tough we are that we're really a bunch of cowardly jellyfish and so you've
[17:49.120 --> 17:56.560]  got these hard-core people from Mexico up here who've been taught that this
[17:56.560 --> 18:02.040]  country belongs to them and they see an American flag it gets torn off somebody's
[18:02.040 --> 18:05.280]  car they see it at a post office it gets torn down and the Mexican flag gets
[18:05.280 --> 18:10.240]  run up they see kids wearing American flags Hispanic kids hey you take that
[18:10.240 --> 18:13.760]  stinking shirt off buddy this is Mexico you understand and the school comes in
[18:13.760 --> 18:18.560]  and says that's right take it off and by the way they admit Mexican flags are
[18:18.560 --> 18:24.280]  allowed oh yeah oh yeah because again the people that run this government hate
[18:24.280 --> 18:28.840]  this country they're globalist they'll work with anybody to bring this country
[18:28.840 --> 18:31.960]  down because as soon as your bill of rights and constitutions gone and it's

[18:37.920 --> 18:49.800]  talking about discrimination there's now 111 giant firms like Walmart and
[18:49.800 --> 18:55.200]  companies like McDonald's that don't have to buy insurance for anybody how is
[18:55.200 --> 18:59.200]  anybody going to compete if you've got a five and dime and you've got to buy
[18:59.200 --> 19:03.480]  expensive insurance for all your employees but Walmart doesn't I mean
[19:03.480 --> 19:09.480]  there's already hardly any five and dimes left that aren't Walmart how you
[19:09.480 --> 19:16.640]  going to compete with Walmart who has lower standards than anybody else who
[19:16.640 --> 19:21.160]  has deals with the Chinese government to produce goods at a price no one can
[19:21.160 --> 19:25.840]  compete with and now they don't have to have insurance for their employees but
[19:25.840 --> 19:31.780]  you do it if you're an individual a company of one and can't afford it hey
[19:31.780 --> 19:34.680]  don't worry the government will just come sees your bank account but if you're

[24:15.280 --> 24:23.800]  segment but getting back to levels of corruption never before seen what the
[24:23.800 --> 24:30.200]  globalists are creating is a class system where if you're a government
[24:30.200 --> 24:33.880]  bureaucrat or you're somebody with a national security clearance you're
[24:33.880 --> 24:38.320]  above the law you get to go around the line you don't have to have your wife's
[24:38.320 --> 24:47.320]  breast squeezed your children molested but for everybody else you do and it's
[24:47.320 --> 24:53.480]  the same thing with President Obama ramming through the health care written
[24:53.480 --> 24:57.920]  by the insurance companies to make 30 plus million Americans by overpriced
[24:57.920 --> 25:05.400]  insurance and allows the government to set the standards of care of what type
[25:05.400 --> 25:15.120]  of tests and surgeries you will get and admitting that it is a death panel I mean
[25:15.120 --> 25:18.680]  I've been fighting the globalists for 15 years full-time 17 years since I've
[25:18.680 --> 25:26.880]  really been away and I still get amazed by how much they lie I mean their death
[25:26.880 --> 25:31.160]  panels written right into that thing and now after they passed it they admit it
[25:31.160 --> 25:35.960]  yeah we are gonna cut what health care somebody gets and we'll be able to hire
[25:35.960 --> 25:40.880]  more teachers so see they also get us fighting over the resources but it's so
[25:40.880 --> 25:51.480]  illegal it's so discriminatory it's so unfair to have 111 major you know
[25:51.480 --> 26:00.600]  Fortune 500 companies from McDonald's to Walmart they don't have to get health
[26:00.600 --> 26:04.600]  insurance for their employees and of course all those companies would have
[26:04.600 --> 26:08.880]  done this is why Obama's given them the waivers is lay off a bunch of people and
[26:08.880 --> 26:14.320]  make their employees pay for their own health care that's how it works see if
[26:14.320 --> 26:18.840]  you're paid 15 bucks an hour the company you work for is matching your social
[26:18.840 --> 26:22.920]  security your workers comp all of it they're probably paying seven bucks on
[26:22.920 --> 26:26.960]  top of the 15 you're getting paid 25 bucks an hour you're getting paid more
[26:26.960 --> 26:31.440]  like 35 bucks an hour somebody at Wendy's getting paid nine bucks an hour
[26:31.440 --> 26:36.120]  their boss is probably kicking in more like 14 15 bucks an hour this is all the
[26:36.120 --> 26:41.320]  hidden taxes out there so the dumb down public's like yo some free health care
[26:41.320 --> 26:45.000]  thank you so much mr. president I don't have to worry about my car payment or
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.800]  my house anymore remember all those idiots two years ago when he got elected a
[26:51.800 --> 27:00.440]  year and a half ago or when he got into office remember all of that yeah where's
[27:00.440 --> 27:04.720]  your Valhalla now and then they announced oh the health care doesn't cover
[27:04.720 --> 27:10.240]  pre-existing conditions in old people and children oh I'm afraid you got to go
[27:10.240 --> 27:15.800]  out and buy your own insurance oh you don't have the money for it don't worry
[27:15.800 --> 27:21.200]  you're making 15,000 a year 16,000 a year right at you know the poverty line
[27:21.200 --> 27:25.640]  we're just gonna go ahead and grab part of your paycheck and now you're gonna
[27:25.640 --> 27:30.400]  get Medicare and Medicaid one of the British government announced two months
[27:30.400 --> 27:33.720]  ago and now they're going ahead with it all of the paychecks in England they're
[27:33.720 --> 27:37.480]  reportedly saying they're trying to phase it in next year will be deposited
[27:37.480 --> 27:43.200]  digitally with the government and then it will take out what it wants so of
[27:43.200 --> 27:47.880]  course in England and the US they're trying to ban garage sales or give people
[27:47.880 --> 27:51.960]  a million dollar fines so they don't get a permit that's associated press if you
[27:51.960 --> 28:03.200]  don't believe me I mean think about that all these big mega corporations they're
[28:03.200 --> 28:07.960]  all above the law they don't have to get anybody insurance now they can cut the
[28:07.960 --> 28:11.600]  prices of their goods and they can shut down all their competition because
[28:11.600 --> 28:17.040]  they're the insiders it's the same thing with the carbon taxes in Europe in
[28:17.040 --> 28:22.760]  Spain and other areas and now in California if you're an insider you can
[28:22.760 --> 28:26.520]  have broken sprinkler heads pouring water into the street every day you don't
[28:26.520 --> 28:32.520]  get a fine or a fee you can have all the carbon dioxide and carbon footprint you
[28:32.520 --> 28:35.880]  want nothing's gonna happen to you oh but if you're a little local company or
[28:35.880 --> 28:42.040]  a home you're gonna be squeezed the bureaucrats are coming she big
[28:42.040 --> 28:48.840]  government's written to keep the little guy from ever climbing out of poverty
[28:48.840 --> 28:53.480]  into the middle class that's one enemy of the elite but the biggest enemy is the
[28:53.480 --> 28:59.040]  middle class climbing out of the middle class into new wealth or nouveau rich as
[28:59.040 --> 29:07.040]  the French call it and then into the elite no no no that's the big no no
[29:07.040 --> 29:12.160]  that's what's really bad that's what has to be stopped but now in land of the
[29:12.160 --> 29:15.440]  free home of the brave they don't just fondle your wife and children and put
[29:15.440 --> 29:27.240]  them through radiation systems they don't just do that now in America no no
[29:27.240 --> 29:33.520]  your company that employs 25 people it's gonna have to next year get insurance
[29:33.520 --> 29:40.360]  for everyone there's a lot to lay off some folks so will you cut the other
[29:40.360 --> 29:45.760]  people's pay but then McDonald's and Walmart no problem they don't have to
[29:45.760 --> 29:51.080]  that's the ultimate discrimination economic discrimination we're on the
[29:51.080 --> 30:00.520]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is
[30:00.520 --> 30:03.880]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[30:03.880 --> 30:07.880]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[30:07.880 --> 30:12.120]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[30:12.120 --> 30:16.400]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[30:16.400 --> 30:20.760]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[30:20.760 --> 30:24.840]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[30:24.840 --> 30:29.400]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[30:29.400 --> 30:33.520]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[30:33.520 --> 30:37.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[30:37.280 --> 30:41.320]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[30:41.320 --> 30:44.040]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[30:44.040 --> 30:50.040]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[31:06.240 --> 31:10.160]  millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps the
[31:10.160 --> 31:13.520]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[31:13.520 --> 31:17.120]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news

[33:08.280 --> 33:21.440]  GCN radio network if you're doubting me because I know a lot of you do that you
[33:21.440 --> 33:25.640]  can't believe this stuff's happening either can I drudge reports got it linked
[33:25.640 --> 33:29.440]  up there for several days US Department of Health and Human Services approved
[33:29.440 --> 33:34.800]  applications for waiver of annual limits requirements on the section of the
[33:34.800 --> 33:39.920]  health care bill and it's got things like jack in the box and cracker barrel
[33:39.920 --> 33:44.080]  in there but but this is only one group of waivers there's another group of
[33:44.080 --> 33:53.320]  waivers that did get some attention what back on the 7th of October in USA
[33:53.320 --> 34:02.600]  today McDonald's 29 other firms get health care coverage waivers I mean how
[34:02.600 --> 34:08.440]  do you give elite companies waivers and then not give the general public
[34:08.440 --> 34:12.440]  waivers but jaren was pointing out that if you read the list of this latest
[34:12.440 --> 34:18.800]  111 waivers I mean how are they not gonna give my operation a waiver most
[34:18.800 --> 34:23.560]  people that work or they do not want health insurance even if they wanted it
[34:23.560 --> 34:27.680]  we'd go out and get it they've either got their own or don't think they need it
[34:27.680 --> 34:34.280]  right now but but the issue here is how do they do this how do they get away I
[34:34.280 --> 34:38.760]  mean it came out a year and a half ago when they were taken over Chrysler and
[34:38.760 --> 34:44.000]  GM and the government was giving them billions of taxpayer money that the
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.920]  Obama administration went to dealerships some of them over 80 years old worth
[34:47.920 --> 34:51.760]  millions of dollars millions and millions of dollars no healthy good
[34:51.760 --> 34:57.520]  dealerships and would take them away from Republican donors or people who
[34:57.520 --> 35:02.920]  never donated to the Democrats and then would give them to Democratic operatives
[35:02.920 --> 35:07.600]  or would let the Democratic operatives keep their dealerships I mean this is
[35:07.600 --> 35:16.600]  a group of naked thug-like gangsters and where are the criminal Republicans they
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.320]  should be calling for indictments and impeachments and immediate repeal of
[35:21.320 --> 35:26.200]  this now getting up on their hind legs and saying look at how outrageous this
[35:26.200 --> 35:30.840]  is we have the moral high ground it's just like that CNN house we're about to
[35:30.840 --> 35:37.320]  play he looks to John Pistole pistol and says the head of the TSA and says you
[35:37.320 --> 35:41.400]  let pilots fly the planes that's a lot more powerful weapon than a bomb or a
[35:41.400 --> 35:44.280]  gun well why are you naked body scanning them why are you searching and he goes
[35:44.280 --> 35:50.120]  well these are a special trusted group I well yeah we're all trusted we could all
[35:50.120 --> 35:55.120]  just start killing people and no amount of security would stop it but see that's
[35:55.120 --> 36:01.320]  that's the idea as the attacks continue at bus stops and malls the feds have
[36:01.320 --> 36:06.920]  announced they want this same culture of federal goons everywhere on every
[36:06.920 --> 36:12.200]  street corner checkpoints this is their power grab this is their takeover and
[36:12.200 --> 36:16.640]  these big defense contractors they then get the billions of dollars in profits
[36:16.640 --> 36:21.160]  from the face scanning cameras and the license plate reading cameras and the
[36:21.160 --> 36:25.880]  data mining software and the mobile naked body scanners and then in every
[36:25.880 --> 36:31.760]  case where do the cartridge bombs and the underwear bombs and the shootings at
[36:31.760 --> 36:37.640]  Fort Hood lead back to directly to the military industrial complex red-handed
[36:37.640 --> 36:42.080]  the media comes out and goes well yes the government US government did help
[36:42.080 --> 36:46.560]  get Mutalib the underwear bomber on the plane but we're not going to discuss it
[36:46.560 --> 36:51.680]  yes it's true and we're all a lock he hangs out with the CIA and Pentagon and
[36:51.680 --> 36:56.120]  he's number one in al-Qaeda but and and he's running the attacks give up your
[36:56.120 --> 37:01.480]  rights let's not talk about how he's at the Pentagon it's just all in your
[37:01.480 --> 37:09.320]  face so oh you don't give money to the Democrat crime machine we're gonna take
[37:09.320 --> 37:17.880]  your car dealership we own Chevy now we own GM now I mean we we need to just
[37:17.880 --> 37:24.040]  rise up verbally and point out you're a bunch of stinking crooks and the rest
[37:24.040 --> 37:28.400]  of the sheep are gonna follow again I'm getting the TSA right now this is so
[37:28.400 --> 37:32.440]  big you realize history is being made right now people are like some people
[37:32.440 --> 37:35.680]  most people totally understand some people send me emails or I see comments
[37:35.680 --> 37:44.920]  and they say they say why are you covering this so much well I'm gonna
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.480]  walk through it again and then get into all the latest developments okay because
[37:49.480 --> 37:54.680]  Homeland Security has stated that everything you see going on in the
[37:54.680 --> 38:02.680]  airport is going to go on at colleges K through 12 public schools highways
[38:02.680 --> 38:09.800]  malls sports stadiums movie theaters everywhere is going to have federal
[38:09.800 --> 38:15.040]  goons way outside the 10th Amendment putting their hands on you and training
[38:15.040 --> 38:20.240]  you to be a slave the airports are the beta test that is admitted and they're
[38:20.240 --> 38:25.720]  now rolling it out okay so if we don't stop them here we're never going to stop
[38:25.720 --> 38:33.560]  them this is also the first big revolt that is nonviolent that is a true strike
[38:33.560 --> 38:38.520]  where the pilots are saying they're not gonna fly this the flight attendants are
[38:38.520 --> 38:42.720]  saying they're not gonna fly the citizens are saying they're not gonna
[38:42.720 --> 38:49.120]  fly and it's hurting the big airlines and the hotels by billions of dollars a
[38:49.120 --> 38:52.880]  month and that's all these people care about so they're now going to the
[38:52.880 --> 38:58.640]  Polatano and saying hey can't you at least let the pilots fly you know we
[38:58.640 --> 39:04.400]  gotta trust them and the government today said yes we're going to in the
[39:04.400 --> 39:10.080]  near future give them some different screening and then of course they'll
[39:10.080 --> 39:13.880]  come back a year later try to put it back in place their masters of all you
[39:13.880 --> 39:17.840]  know take us a mile we push him back a half mile and they push us two miles we
[39:17.840 --> 39:22.120]  push him back a mile they always want more more more these are control freaks
[39:22.120 --> 39:26.960]  these are perverts these are sadists that's why they're in government they
[39:26.960 --> 39:33.800]  enjoy doing this they enjoy power over people they enjoy taking over society
[39:33.800 --> 39:44.200]  they like it okay now I want to play this John pistol clip the whole thing is
[39:44.200 --> 39:48.640]  going up on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com in minutes we've got a big
[39:48.640 --> 39:54.680]  article about Janet de Polatano's lies and that's coming up in a moment but
[39:54.680 --> 40:00.480]  first let's go ahead and play this major cave-in this major capitulation and you
[40:00.480 --> 40:05.080]  better believe the TSA controllers the lobbyists making billions off these
[40:05.080 --> 40:10.640]  machines you better believe they're loading up bombs right now and it's
[40:10.640 --> 40:15.640]  going to be incredibly obvious a lot of mainstream news is already suspecting the
[40:15.640 --> 40:19.560]  government Glenn Beck's talking about Oklahoma City being an inside job the
[40:19.560 --> 40:23.680]  Democrats may stage more herald of Saturday night came out and said he
[40:23.680 --> 40:27.560]  wants to look at building seven and that there may be something to this and
[40:27.560 --> 40:33.720]  that he was wrong about 9-11 truth it's over people know and you can't control
[40:33.720 --> 40:39.800]  everybody it's over criminals and for those of you that have a fetish of
[40:39.800 --> 40:44.680]  hating Muslims look it's the government bringing in the Muslims at record levels
[40:44.680 --> 40:47.880]  it's the government that says Homeland Security's for gun owners
[40:47.880 --> 40:51.760]  conservatives returning veterans libertarians even if you want to keep
[40:51.760 --> 40:57.640]  sucking your thumb of the Muslim hatred then at least understand it was a bait
[40:57.640 --> 41:02.840]  and switch okay so for your own little mind Muslims are evil okay I'm not
[41:02.840 --> 41:07.320]  saying that but just for your own little world they're the devil now the
[41:07.320 --> 41:12.760]  Homeland Security was set up for you buddy boy because you got a back 40 and
[41:12.760 --> 41:17.720]  an old farmhouse and know how to plant tomatoes they don't like you it's set up
[41:17.720 --> 41:23.040]  for you you understand that get that through your brain right now let's go
[41:23.040 --> 41:27.960]  ahead and play this clip of the head of the TSA caving in to common sense here
[41:27.960 --> 41:32.680]  it is and Sully Sullenberger has fired the latest ballie in this now saying I
[41:32.680 --> 41:36.120]  don't understand what the purpose of screening pilots is and some people at
[41:36.120 --> 41:39.720]  home might ask you know the biggest weapon that a pilot could possibly have
[41:39.720 --> 41:43.020]  if they want if he or she wanted to commit an act of terror is in their
[41:43.020 --> 41:46.600]  hands it's the aircraft so why are we even screening pilots well that's
[41:46.600 --> 41:50.240]  obviously been an issue for a while John and and trying to use an
[41:50.240 --> 41:55.400]  intelligence driven risk-based approach we had some good conversations last
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.560]  week with the pilot groups and we're continuing that this week and I believe
[41:59.560 --> 42:05.040]  we are finding a good way forward on that as we try to manage risk as to the
[42:05.040 --> 42:08.640]  security we need to apply to those groups for those very reasons does it
[42:08.640 --> 42:12.720]  make sense to you to screen a pilot for for weapons if again they've got the
[42:12.720 --> 42:16.480]  biggest weapon they could possibly have in their hands well obviously they are
[42:16.480 --> 42:21.960]  a trusted group in so many different ways and so it makes sense to do some
[42:21.960 --> 42:26.120]  type of different type of screening which we will explore and I think have a
[42:26.120 --> 42:29.120]  way forward here in the near future so things will change when it comes to
[42:29.120 --> 42:33.920]  pilots will they well I don't want to broadcast anything prematurely but I
[42:33.920 --> 42:37.680]  think there is there are options that we are looking at that will make sense
[42:37.680 --> 42:40.000]  all right that's very interesting now what about this fellow over the weekend
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.920]  in San Diego John Tyler didn't want to go through the the body scanning machine
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.960]  and then when he was subjected to a pat down he was uncomfortable with the level
[42:48.960 --> 42:52.880]  of pat down that he was going to be subject to and then he was escorted out
[42:52.880 --> 42:57.320]  of the airport and then told that he might face a $10,000 fine what's your
[42:57.320 --> 43:02.040]  take on that episode well obviously everybody has their own perspectives
[43:02.040 --> 43:06.560]  about their personal screening and again it gets back to the issue of what are
[43:06.560 --> 43:09.440]  we doing to ensure everybody else on that flight that people have been
[43:09.440 --> 43:14.560]  properly screened so if I'll do a metallic from 1225 had said well look I
[43:14.560 --> 43:19.800]  don't want you doing a pat down on the plane it pause right there may be it
[43:19.800 --> 43:24.400]  pause look at this guy he knows full well the US government got him through the
[43:24.400 --> 43:29.120]  Amsterdam Airport past the naked body scanners that his bosses made money on
[43:29.120 --> 43:35.200]  and that a sharp-dressed man was able to get him on the plane without a passport
[43:35.200 --> 43:40.880]  and then it came out it was done through the State Department they got him on the
[43:40.880 --> 43:48.320]  plane they did it they're the ones right out in the open who investigates the
[43:48.320 --> 43:56.680]  TSA who investigates the minimum wage elephant rear-ended fat bodies that
[43:56.680 --> 44:05.880]  they've got running around groping everybody I mean who's gonna stop
[44:05.880 --> 44:09.120]  somebody pulling up in an airport with a machine gun just shooting everybody
[44:09.120 --> 44:13.200]  who's gonna stop a suicide bomber running into an airport okay you're gonna
[44:13.200 --> 44:16.000]  put a security perimeter around the airport what's gonna stop them from
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.880]  walking into a 7-eleven oh we're gonna put federal guards outside of 7-eleven
[44:19.880 --> 44:24.800]  what's gonna stop somebody from putting an IED out on the highway nothing's
[44:24.800 --> 44:29.440]  going to stop them the truth is nobody's doing it but the feds and the feds
[44:29.440 --> 44:32.280]  have been training local police for at least five years that there's about to
[44:32.280 --> 44:36.680]  be IEDs detonating in every community and to harden their police departments
[44:36.680 --> 44:40.160]  against the people that's all admitted and guess who they tell the cops the bad
[44:40.160 --> 44:45.880]  guys are they tell them veterans are gonna bomb you know the feds are gonna
[44:45.880 --> 44:51.640]  bomb local cops to have those weak-minded people go and grovel to the feds
[44:51.640 --> 44:55.600]  and follow all their orders and become secret police for them in this stasi
[44:55.600 --> 45:00.560]  takeover aren't you smart enough to get it cops aren't you smart enough to
[45:00.560 --> 45:05.680]  understand it don't you understand we've got swindling offshore banks raping
[45:05.680 --> 45:12.120]  the country seven ways to Sunday can't you get that through your head don't you
[45:12.120 --> 45:14.760]  understand it
[45:14.760 --> 45:25.160]  now I want to get into big sisters lies and we're having a detailed report
[45:25.160 --> 45:29.680]  written on this that's set to go up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com the
[45:29.680 --> 45:33.200]  next few minutes and I think this is one of the most important articles we've
[45:33.200 --> 45:39.200]  done because we're on the offensive if they fail here if despite all their
[45:39.200 --> 45:43.840]  stage terror and everything they're doing if they fail here they're not
[45:43.840 --> 45:47.760]  gonna be able to federalize all our communities with the 72 threat fusion
[45:47.760 --> 45:54.400]  centers they're not gonna be able to take over all of our societies people are
[45:54.400 --> 45:58.120]  gonna say well wait a minute terrorists could attack anywhere anytime why are we
[45:58.120 --> 46:03.680]  just doing this in airports people are getting the common sense so they've got
[46:03.680 --> 46:07.640]  to force it through on us and they're scared and they're desperate and they're
[46:07.640 --> 46:14.520]  having to respond there's been a backlash against TSA for nine years tourism
[46:14.520 --> 46:20.000]  is weighed down from all over the world of the US and inside the US it's killing
[46:20.000 --> 46:24.960]  the hotels and theme parks and airlines and the feds we have another article out
[46:24.960 --> 46:28.320]  today actually don't care they want to bankrupt the airlines they want to
[46:28.320 --> 46:32.720]  quasi-nationalize them only have two or three carriers that are insiders they
[46:32.720 --> 46:37.440]  want to ban non-essential travel that's mainstream news we have an article up
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.880]  on them prisonplanet.com and info wars.com
[46:42.880 --> 46:48.600]  Homeland Security trying to shut down air travel so we know what they're doing
[46:48.600 --> 46:53.960]  we know this is part of agenda 21 but I saw this article this morning in USA
[46:53.960 --> 47:01.440]  today Napolitano responding see they're in trouble and every word in here is a
[47:01.440 --> 47:07.400]  lie and if you get this out to people and point out regardless of what you
[47:07.400 --> 47:12.400]  think of all this screening she is lying
[47:12.600 --> 47:21.560]  regardless of what you think of all this screening she is lying to you and I
[47:21.560 --> 47:26.920]  made a special video today that Rob do's in their editing to put up on the web
[47:26.920 --> 47:30.440]  dealing with her being caught red-handed lying tell him pop a tape back in the
[47:30.440 --> 47:37.480]  in the camera during the next break I want to shoot an addendum video to add
[47:37.480 --> 47:40.800]  on to the video he's putting together see I mean there's so many lies here that
[47:40.800 --> 47:44.680]  I want to go over it's it's again even if you think your wife being groped is
[47:44.680 --> 47:47.880]  great because you've got a fetish of being scared of them with turbines and
[47:47.880 --> 47:50.640]  all the rest of it but then the guys with turbines are exempt from being
[47:50.640 --> 47:55.080]  searched you need to understand she's a liar everything in this article is a
[47:55.080 --> 48:01.760]  lie napolitano this is written by her scanners are safe
[48:03.600 --> 48:10.200]  pat down's discreet and then she goes into the terrorist attacks they thwarted
[48:10.200 --> 48:14.560]  actually in every case they were behind it the Detroit operation all the rest of
[48:14.560 --> 48:18.400]  it that's on record so she tells you about the terror attacks that her bosses
[48:18.400 --> 48:25.400]  ran and how they kept you set from how they kept you safe from that and then
[48:25.400 --> 48:29.800]  she goes on with the other lies she says pat down's are discreet having a man
[48:29.800 --> 48:34.400]  grab your genitals or grab your breast is not discreet and everyone's pointed
[48:34.400 --> 48:38.440]  out they do this in the common area with hundreds of people around you and they
[48:38.440 --> 48:42.520]  make women raise their dresses they make men take their pants down that's on
[48:42.520 --> 48:48.800]  record they squeeze you there's nothing discreet about it so she says scanners
[48:48.800 --> 48:53.360]  are safe that's a lie got all these scientists in the federal government and
[48:53.360 --> 48:59.120]  the atomic energy agency saying it's not safe and she says in the opening line
[48:59.120 --> 49:03.960]  it's all lies see it's a culture of lies there are no death panels now they go
[49:03.960 --> 49:10.760]  death panels are good I did not have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky oh yes I
[49:10.760 --> 49:17.320]  did it's just a it's it's they love it they love lying it's what they do and
[49:17.320 --> 49:21.640]  they're counting on you not doing research so scanners are safe that's a lie
[49:21.640 --> 49:29.560]  pat down's are discreet that's the headline and the biggest lie here is
[49:29.560 --> 49:36.040]  that they're safe she quotes John Hopkins University applied physics
[49:36.040 --> 49:41.720]  laboratory as saying it's safe and the Food and Drug Administration who
[49:41.720 --> 49:47.520]  approved aspartame by the way and the National Institute of Standards and
[49:47.520 --> 49:51.520]  Technology the folks that told you building seven didn't fall at freefall
[49:51.520 --> 49:55.760]  speeds but it did but actually without even looking today because there's
[49:55.760 --> 49:59.400]  hundreds of agencies and groups saying it's deadly I happen to have the French
[49:59.400 --> 50:07.320]  news agency here AFP Dr. Michael Love who runs the x-ray lab at the Department
[50:07.320 --> 50:13.000]  of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry at John Hopkins that's the folks that
[50:13.000 --> 50:20.160]  would know University School of Medicine told AFP he said we know they are
[50:20.160 --> 50:28.880]  hazardous to your health he says you are risking your life when you go through
[50:28.880 --> 50:32.760]  the machines I mean and I could literally go through hundreds of these I
[50:32.760 --> 50:38.400]  mean even the University she cites they go to the physics department not the
[50:38.400 --> 50:45.560]  radiology department it's like hey I need somebody to fix my car I'm gonna go
[50:45.560 --> 50:52.120]  hire a arborist who cuts trees or I need somebody to pull my tooth I'm gonna
[50:52.120 --> 50:56.880]  go to a homeless man to do it I mean this is where to continue with her lies

[56:19.400 --> 56:24.200]  as soon as I have the headline that Steve Watson has gone with you better
[56:24.200 --> 56:28.000]  believe we're gonna make this a search term today because these search terms as
[56:28.000 --> 56:34.760]  Max Kaiser said Friday are having a huge huge effect here's one of the
[56:34.760 --> 56:42.360]  headlines TSA caves on molesting pilots that's a key story up at prison
[56:42.360 --> 56:50.600]  planet dot com that is big news and we've got Homeland Security trying to
[56:50.600 --> 56:55.440]  shut down air travel that goes through the admissions of the UN and others
[56:55.440 --> 57:03.480]  they want to put taxes on airlines and quote shut down non essential travel but
[57:03.480 --> 57:08.920]  in other developments hundreds of publications Forbes Chicago Tribune they
[57:08.920 --> 57:17.640]  have headlines like government in your pants Chicago Tribune or Forbes
[57:17.640 --> 57:26.560]  abolish the TSA and again if you really believe that Al Qaeda is real and and
[57:26.560 --> 57:29.320]  we're all luck he's hanging out at the Pentagon but that's no big deal let's
[57:29.320 --> 57:34.240]  just ignore that and buildings blow up and fall at freefall speed of course
[57:34.240 --> 57:39.480]  there's a Chinese building here in my stack burning today it's been burning

[57:44.760 --> 57:49.160]  mean if you really believe all these fairy tales why don't they just profile

[57:54.760 --> 57:56.800]  mean the government already knows everything about you they're already
[57:56.800 --> 58:01.200]  spying on everything they know they've got databases every time it's a real
[58:01.200 --> 58:05.760]  terrorist it turns out they're trained at US military bases they're protected by
[58:05.760 --> 58:09.480]  the US government their houses are paid for by the government they're given
[58:09.480 --> 58:14.080]  visas by the government they're helped to get on airplanes by the government the
[58:14.080 --> 58:19.880]  government cooks the bombs for them the government wants to be your daddy it
[58:19.880 --> 58:24.720]  wants to run everything it wants the keys to the cupboard so it can control
[58:24.720 --> 58:29.360]  you it's very elementary they get trillions of dollars tax exempt a year
[58:29.360 --> 58:34.960]  for the military-industrial complex and of course they're staging this stuff

[59:00.160 --> 59:04.080]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[59:04.080 --> 59:07.940]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[59:07.940 --> 59:12.920]  pathogens and viruses the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[59:12.920 --> 59:18.160]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[59:18.160 --> 59:22.800]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation

[59:54.480 --> 01:00:00.360]  corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:12.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:19.840]  does he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:29.840]  Alex Jones there's a big story that's not getting any attention oh it's getting
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:38.920]  attention that all over Texas they found high levels of uranium and radium and
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:43.960]  they admitted just massively increases cancer what they're not telling you in
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:51.920]  the KHOU or associated press articles is that the uranium is coming from the
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:57.400]  chemicals added at the water treatment plants their mind in limestone
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:03.920]  deposits for phosphates it's also the same place you mine for uranium we were
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.640]  just talking about this early last week and this broke on Friday about how look
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.080]  it's not just sodium fluoride they put in your water they call the stuff they
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:16.600]  put in fluoride it's all the toxic waste left over from aluminum manufacturing
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:23.280]  smelting the scrubbers for smokestacks because they can't let the toxic waste
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.320]  go into the air so they shoot a sheen of water across and it precipitates into
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:35.440]  it then they evaporate that and put it in your water but that's the minority of
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.320]  where it comes from the vast majority comes from phosphate fertilizer
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:47.280]  derivatives and they boil it off because if you put if you put uranium and other
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.760]  things and arsenic on plants it'll kill them so they've got to cut most of it
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.520]  out or it'd be too obvious and they go what do we do with it we'll go lobby
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.760]  cities and tell them it's good for their teeth and they'll pay us in the case of
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:01.800]  Austin over a million bucks a year to put uranium in the water and they go
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:06.640]  awesome oh yeah let's murder the scum we're a bunch of eugenicists just look
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.640]  at those cowardly people look at how they're obsessed with their football

[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:28.680]  dealing with the TSA and people being fondled and abused anytime you're a
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.080]  slave anytime you're a prisoner humiliating things are done to you to
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:39.760]  train you to accept it to break your will. The United States has been a great
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:45.120]  nation we haven't been perfect but we've been the greatest and the freest in
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:52.720]  history but we became decadent we became wicked and it's time to repent it's
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.120]  time to learn to recognize evil and that doesn't mean I'm on some high horse
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:03.200]  but the atheists and people basically say there are no morals I was reading the
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:10.760]  transcript of George Soros on 60 minutes in 1998 saying yeah I helped the Nazis
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.840]  yeah I went around and took their property if I wouldn't have done it
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:19.640]  somebody else would have done it so I have no guilt that's a quote and they
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.080]  almost see it as moral the globalists do that they're doing all these evil
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:32.360]  things they think it's good they enjoy it and they teach us not to care not to
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:36.720]  be involved not to believe we have any power they teach us to be passive so
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:45.560]  that they can basically have their way with us and I'm angry I don't want to
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:50.360]  be a slave I don't want to lose my free country I don't want to lose a future
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:55.000]  for my children I don't want to lose my private property rights I don't want my
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.980]  money taken away and and used for social engineering and used for wars and
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:06.160]  empire and brainwashing and I'm standing up and I'm saying no to the
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.920]  jack-booted thugs of the federal government
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:17.200]  drudge just top-linked our TSA caves on molesting pilots thank you drudge man
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:24.960]  this is history folks drudge got a record nine billion readers as of today
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:32.280]  he's already broken his previous record of seven plus billion in 2009 he's
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:41.640]  already hit nine billion readers this year and I think I got a lot with two
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:48.400]  million readers a day and two million radio listeners try 365 days divided to
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:58.840]  nine billion what's that how many people a day does he get it's amazing so the
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:03.240]  look I'll go back to a bug's life can we pull up a bug's life guys only have
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:07.360]  another video queued up but I want to pull up a bug's life and I've been
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:12.160]  talking about this a lot over the years but but more lately because the grasshopper
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:19.160]  is there and they're in this big granary and there's just giant vats giant
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:24.240]  containers of grain and they're all sitting around fat living high on the
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.000]  hog and the number two grasshoppers is hey boss why aren't we going back to
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.960]  beat up the ants and he said well that little one ant stood up to me and you
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.240]  know we got plenty of food so why go put him in his place because those little
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.520]  ants outnumber us a hundred to one and if they ever figure that out there goes
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:47.400]  our way of life because they make the ants collect them food and still the
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.720]  stupid ant doesn't the stupid grasshopper doesn't get it so he throws one
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:59.480]  grain one grain of wheat at him he says does that hurt no that didn't hurt does
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:05.200]  that does that does that and he pulls the cord it opens up a huge vat a giant
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.600]  pile covers up the grasshopper and hurts him he says now you understand don't you
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:15.800]  so they're always thinking what can we make these schmucks do now let's naked
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:21.240]  body scan them let's hit them with radiation let's touch their genitals
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:25.320]  let's put fluoride in their water hell let's put lithium they're now calling
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:32.400]  for that an anti-psychotic let's turn them into drooling zombies here's the
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:39.000]  clip was that and it's deducted yeah but we can forget about him yeah it was
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:51.720]  just one right it's just one and yeah boys they're puny hmm puny say let's
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:13:20.320]  pretend this rain is a puny little ants did that hurt you let one ant stand up to
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:28.080]  us then they all might stand up those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.360]  to one and if they ever figure that out there goes our way of life it's not
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:41.800]  about food it's about keeping those ants in line that's why we're going back
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:14:01.000]  does anybody else want to stay so there you have it and Napolitano arrogantly
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:13.120]  comes out and gets in your face gets in my face and says there's no radiation
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:20.800]  danger and even sources a university John Hopkins Medical Center that is on
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:26.520]  record their radiology department leading the way saying that this is
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:33.840]  dangerous and she sources people that are against her saying it's dangerous she
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.880]  says the pat downs are discreet what everyone knows it's done out in public
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:42.240]  and that they're not discreet she says they don't save the images and that the
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:48.160]  machines can't even save the images over a year ago we got the manuals and put
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.840]  them on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com they save them all four
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:56.920]  months ago it came out all over the country that they are saving them not
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.440]  just at airports but at federal courthouses one courthouse had over
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:07.400]  30,000 images attached to their names and now they've come out and announced
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:14.040]  that guess what we can use the scan as a biometric scan of your body of course
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:19.600]  that's what they're designed for I looked up the companies they originally
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:26.120]  tried to sell these as a 360 body scanner to be sold to DMVs instead of
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:34.080]  thumbprints the stinking thing is a body scanner for biometrics everybody's
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.440]  emailing me going it was in market watch last Thursday Alex how do you know
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.120]  this before it comes out because I know how to take the name of the machine and
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:50.840]  look it up I'm not smart that's what's frustrating about this I'm not that
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:56.840]  smart ladies and gentlemen you can figure this out I've got these people
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:04.120]  down I know exactly what they're up to this entire article by Napolitano is a
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:13.760]  giant stinking lie that's what she thinks of you she thinks you're an idiot and
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.760]  you know what if you put up with her you are if I put up with her I'm an idiot
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.560]  I'm not an idiot I'm not going along with these people anymore I recognize
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:26.080]  tyranny when I see it oh sure 15 years ago when I got started people said I
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.120]  don't see the tyranny I could see it we were pretty bad off then I'd take 15
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:37.720]  years ago any day now 15 years ago the federal government wouldn't think of
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:43.120]  giving hundreds and hundreds of waivers to big mega corporations to not have to
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.440]  get health insurance for their employees but everybody else does pure
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:53.400]  discrimination out in the open and not just discrimination unfair trade
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.280]  advantage how is your company going to compete when you got to get everybody
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:02.000]  insurance but they don't it's the same thing with NAFTA and GATT same thing
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:09.120]  with the World Trade Organization same thing with China now we have two very
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.640]  important guests coming up and we will have open phones later and I am going
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.520]  to do some shows this week where we do nothing but phone calls because I want
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:21.920]  to hear from all of you on this but we are in the middle of a revolution a
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:29.640]  peaceful revolution of non-compliance as Mahatma Gandhi talked about more
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:34.720]  importantly Jesus Christ was nonviolent but he led by example and showed up the
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:43.880]  tyrants and the power of just saying no the power of saying no to the globalist
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.440]  is unstoppable and they know you're learning that right now and you look at
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:55.000]  Napolitano you look at John Pistol the head of the TSA they're scared they knew
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.440]  five years ago when they started really roughing up and grabbing the pilots that
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:05.320]  it was asinine but no one in mainstream media would say this is ridiculous why
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:10.920]  do you trust a pilot with a plane see we have to come out and ask the common
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:17.880]  sense questions we have to come out and say no the truth is everybody's known
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:25.280]  this is a joke they have a Reuters poll where 97% of respondents say they won't
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:31.160]  fly because of this we can bring the globalist to their knees if we get
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:35.320]  active now if they get their total control grant in place it's going to be
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:41.720]  very very hard but right now we can beat these people by totally discrediting
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.600]  them by the way Jesse Ventura's show Friday night was the most powerful TV
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:51.160]  program I've ever seen with this type of information they admitted the fusion
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.040]  centers the governor's council how FEMA's in full control Ventura talked
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.960]  about how all this is documented it's hidden in plain view how the fusion
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.480]  centers are tracking political dissidents for roundup under Rex 84 and

[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:36.360]  here the money right yeah imagine dozens of fusion centers dozens of many
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:41.680]  dictators you never heard of a secret government funded by elite power brokers
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:48.080]  in the top echelon of Washington what's the real scheme here I got an idea when
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:55.680]  I got a call from Austin Texas it was Alex Jones my conspiracy insider he knew
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:02.120]  that June was in town and when he heard the term fusion center he went ballistic
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.920]  governor I need to talk to you right away that's just the tip of the iceberg
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:10.400]  these fusion centers aren't just to keep tabs on the public and spy on us
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.560]  they're really command and control centers for the concentration camps that
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:19.880]  are being expanded all over the nation concentration camps I knew this was
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:25.840]  gonna get bigger but I had to see this for myself I met Alex outside a federal
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:31.800]  prison in Texas at least it seemed to be a present this is also designated as a
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:38.160]  civil unrest center and there's 11,000 plus acres in this area controlled by
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:42.560]  Department of Defense so there's much more potential prison space than what
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:46.800]  we're seeing right here yes this is one of the major complexes in the United
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.060]  States before suppressing the major cities during unrest with a financial
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:56.000]  collapse or during a war or during a revolution in this country looks like
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.720]  they're waiting to put us all behind bars coming up Jesse exposes prison
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:08.040]  camps across America waiting for you and me they would build them all over the
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:12.400]  nation prisons that are for entire families similar to the Nazi concentration
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:21.240]  camps then police will pin when the team gets too close to the truth and
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:27.280]  later Jesse confronts the congressman behind the US concentration camps so
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:39.880]  none of these there are no such camps anywhere in America no there aren't just
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:44.400]  even tourist investigation of a police state conspiracy began with a look at
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:51.840]  government terror response bases called the fusion centers the case is now
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:27:00.320]  taken a frightening twist conspiracy expert Alex Jones has warned the
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:04.800]  governor that fusion centers are actually command centers for a network of
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:11.960]  concentration camps ready to be activated under martial law we know that
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:16.760]  they plan to use the cover story that these centers were for illegal aliens
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:20.800]  or undocumented immigrants but that they would then build them all over the
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.960]  nation prisons that are for entire families similar to the Nazi concentration
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.440]  camps or similar to when they interned American Japanese citizens in World War
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:37.320]  2 exactly that government plan to suspend the Constitution declare martial
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:42.920]  law and round up anyone deemed a national security threat it's documented
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:49.640]  it's called Rex 84 it was cooked up under the Reagan administration by Colonel
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:54.560]  Oliver and nothing but the fruits or help you God I do
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.840]  June was in Las Vegas with the constitutional expert named Stuart
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:04.920]  Rhodes from Honest Abe to Barack Obama he says presidents have been taking away
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:11.600]  our rights whenever they want executive orders over the years give the
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:16.360]  president the claimed authority to do all kinds of extraordinary things like
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:21.120]  round up Americans and in turn them without due process
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:25.760]  so we gave free some of these executive orders sure I think the first big one
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.480]  was Lincoln during the Civil War he ordered embargoes and blockades of
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:37.560]  southern ports on his own a suspended habeas corpus a lot of them don't realize
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.400]  that FDR by executive order ordered the detention of American citizens they were
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.720]  American citizens but they happened to be of Japanese descent there would be a
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.760]  corralled up over a hundred thousand were an intern for years no due process at
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:57.880]  all a lot of them date back from the Cold War signed by Kennedy duck and cover
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:03.000]  in the school bus but the more recent one which is raised a bit few eyebrows
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.440]  is the one issue January 11th 2010 which is called which establishes the
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:15.600]  Council of Governors the Council of Governors nine state governors and
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.760]  one from Puerto Rico in case of a national emergency they quarantine the
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:25.560]  country into 10 sectors and take control from the rest of the governors and
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:31.520]  state legislatures if the president wanted to send in military around up
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:36.240]  dissidents in a state his council of cronies would rubber stamp anything
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:41.440]  that's why they got picked that's the problem is that the executive branch is
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:45.760]  now claiming the ability to use its military authority to execute the laws

[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:48.520]  ladies and gentlemen terror in each sip and in each suck last week we played the
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:54.000]  clip Glenn Beck has now come out and said that the government may stage an
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.560]  Oklahoma City bombing to be blamed on the Patriot Tea Party movement in this
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:05.920]  country what Michael Savage has said the same thing we know the Gulf of Tonkin
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:16.960]  was staged we know there have been countless other staged events throughout
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:22.240]  history we know that Mutaleb the underwear bomber was brought on the
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:29.200]  plane was protected under US government orders in Amsterdam we told you that two
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:35.280]  months before it was mainstream news because we had eyewitnesses on the plane
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:42.720]  Kurt Haskell and others the attorney now I go on big conservative talk shows and
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:48.320]  I go look Fox News reports and we're all a locky the head of al Qaeda now the
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:53.000]  number one they say under bin Laden he hangs out at the Pentagon secretly and
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.880]  I bring this up to him and they just don't hear me they just move on and go
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:00.200]  the Muslim threat the Muslim threat look I'm not saying there aren't some
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:04.400]  Muslims in the Middle East that blow themselves up I'm not saying that there
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:10.560]  isn't some real terrorist out there the issue is every one of these big events
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:18.000]  used to set up a police state has staged written all over it now I saw a video
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.880]  last night we played a clip of it of Geraldo Rivera coming out and having
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.440]  Bob McElvane who lost his son on 9-11 and an engineer with architects and
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:33.920]  engineers for 9-11 truth talking about the impossibility of building 7 and the
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:38.760]  freefall collapse without even getting into the newscast where they reported
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.040]  the government blew it up though they did play the clip of Larry Silverstein
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:46.760]  saying they gave the order to pull it and watch the building collapse that's
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:51.840]  now on Fox News and Geraldo that queue it up to the last 30 seconds of Geraldo
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:55.320]  or so just the part where he goes wow I really see where you're coming from now
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:59.920]  I now I have a different view on this well this needs to be looked into there's
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:07.120]  no way a real person can look at 9-11 and not question it but regardless James
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:15.400]  Gorely is of course an attorney and he is the executive director of International
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:19.000]  Center for 9-11 Studies he has an undergraduate degree in chemical
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:26.200]  engineering as well and it's IC911studies.org the International Center
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:29.840]  for 9-11 Studies these are the people the great patriots who deserve your
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:34.960]  support lovers of the truth who did the four-year request and filed the lawsuits
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:39.400]  and went through all the rigmarole in the last few years to force the release of
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:44.080]  all these NIST videos the federal government videos of firefighters police
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.360]  and others that they had tried to classify now when they got five terabytes
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:56.200]  of video and documents released it wasn't bland stuff it was firemen and
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:59.840]  police and the deputy FBI director talking about bombs and explosions and
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:05.640]  countdowns and and the sounds of bombs and powerful stuff so I also want to
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.480]  hear as they go through these five terabytes what else they're about to
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:12.840]  release what their organization stands for and the incredible success they're
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:19.560]  having James Gorely thank you for coming on with us thanks Alex tell us about
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.040]  yourself your organization correct anything that I might have been you
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:27.520]  know partially incorrect on and break down how you got all this NIST
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:34.720]  information well I mean like you say I'm I'm an attorney and that's that takes
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:38.080]  most of my time during the day so I don't have a whole lot of spare time to
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:45.040]  to devote to 9-11 but I have been trying to contribute some original research
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:52.560]  and original work since about maybe 2006 and as I was you know submitting
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.960]  comments to on various government reports and you know submitting papers to be
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:03.800]  published in scientific journals on the subject they kept wanting to know you
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:08.160]  know what organization that I was affiliated with and since I was you know
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:12.960]  kind of acting independently and I didn't really have anything to say so in
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:19.600]  2008 I founded the International Center for 9-11 studies basically as a just a
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:25.200]  vehicle through which I could you know contribute original research to 9-11 and
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:30.200]  also collaborate you know with other scientists and you know college
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:38.920]  professors on work related to 9-11 so you know I've got you know I've been
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:43.840]  author or co-author on several papers that have been published in scientific
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:52.440]  journals through the International Center and I've I've worked with scientists
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:59.080]  you know all over the world so but the most recent action we've taken was we
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:05.480]  filed a Freedom of Information Act request in January of 2009 with the
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.240]  National Institute of Standards and Technology we're basically just
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:15.120]  requested every photograph or video that they that they used you know received
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:19.520]  cited you know in any way that there was in any way a part of their
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:27.080]  investigation into the Twin Towers and Building 7 and they you know despite you
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:33.000]  know repeated you know requests for for when we might hear back from them after
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.680]  you know four months of calling them about once a month and and seeing asking
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:42.560]  when they might respond we were forced to file a lawsuit against them and sure
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.960]  enough you know a month after we filed a lawsuit they start releasing documents
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:52.640]  and they have been ever since well talk about I mean because you really did
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:56.800]  something important talk about how you you got the idea to demand all these
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:00.880]  videos be released they didn't want to be forthcoming they'd refuse to give them
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:04.160]  to others but you were able to get them and now some of the things that we're
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:10.360]  seeing on these videos it becomes very clear why NIST did not want to release
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:16.560]  these right yeah I I think you know a year or two before I submitted my
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:23.360]  request I recall somebody else posting on on 9-11 blogger that they had requested
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:26.480]  pretty much the same thing I did and that NIST told them that it would cost
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:32.920]  you know 19 or $20,000 to produce all this stuff and and obviously you know
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:38.080]  that was an effort on their part to make it cost prohibitive so you know I thought
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:43.000]  well I'll submit it and I'll submit the same request if they try to pull that on
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.480]  me I'll just I'll challenge it and I'll just sue them because you know I'm an
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:52.480]  attorney so filing a lawsuit against it would be a lot cheaper than you know
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:59.200]  paying him 19 or $20,000 so you know but after actually whenever I submitted the
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:06.280]  request they never responded which actually under under recent amendments
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:11.240]  to the Freedom of Information Act if they fail to respond within 20 days you
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.280]  actually get kicked down into a lower fee structure it's kind of complex they
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:19.680]  have they have three different fee classes you can you can fall under so
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.560]  even if they put me in the highest fee class they failed to respond I
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:29.160]  automatically got kicked out the next lower fee class but actually since I sued
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:34.600]  them they haven't they haven't tried to charge me a dime so it's been pretty
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:39.480]  successful and like you say as I've been going through these and I've only like
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:42.720]  and you kind of mentioned there's there's four or five caravans of
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:46.560]  information here and as I've been going through them I've only gotten through
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.760]  maybe 15 to 20% of what I've received because it's just a mountain of
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:57.680]  information but you know you find all kinds of references to explosions you
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.600]  know I I wanted to make sure that the that footage that I think you know you
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:08.320]  played and others have played about with the the men walking away from
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.440]  Building 7 with the hard hats on saying keep an eye on that building that
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:15.280]  building's about to blow up I wanted to make sure that was legitimate and you
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:20.120]  know sourced from an official government body that that it documented
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.680]  that they had possession of that video as well you know you've got Brian Williams
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:30.040]  talking to the fire chiefs saying well you know we had heard that it was either
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:37.640]  going to be brought down or would come down on its own you know I mean NIST
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.560]  was was in possession of all kinds of evidence of explosions that ignored it
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:46.640]  all well we have the news reporting that they were going to blow up Building 7 I
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:50.080]  heard it on the radio that day and now it's all admitted so they did this
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:57.080]  in plain view like a magician distracting you with his assistant while he
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:01.560]  does the sleight of hand but we've now seen it I don't know if you've seen the
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:07.600]  latest video but Geraldo Rivera on Fox this is a big deal has come out and
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:13.640]  tacitly endorse 9-11 truth and the victims families over Building 7 he
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:18.400]  said he's very concerned about this and understands why people are
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:23.720]  investigating now so it's gone from total ridicule to Geraldo Rivera a long
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:28.640]  time New Yorker saying he's concerned yeah I actually I did see that this
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:33.480]  weekend and I mean that's all the things to that goes to the people who
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:37.840]  organized the building what advertising campaign because that I don't think that
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:43.840]  ever would have happened without building what and actually you know a lot
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:47.680]  of the video that I've received is basically and it's very native very
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:54.400]  high-quality format and I gave the videographer or the video editor who
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:00.960]  put together that commercial I gave him access to all of the Building 7 collapse
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:06.240]  videos that I've received that I know of anyways that I've discovered you
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:11.080]  know through my investigation and I think he might have used some of my you
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:14.480]  know the video that I've received in that commercial because obviously it's
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:19.440]  going to be broadcast on television you need very absolutely afford well we want
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:24.120]  to thank you James Gourley for what you've done with your organization
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:27.600]  that's this having a huge effect International Center for 9-11 Studies
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:33.040]  but I want to expand on that and thank our listeners because they had raised
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:37.280]  just a little bit of money I'm not thanking myself for the show I want to
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:42.200]  thank our listeners who I know gave a lot of money when we premiered the
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.360]  building what commercial here a few months ago gave you know gave the the
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:51.400]  largest donations at that point that they had gotten and allowed that TV ad to
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:56.160]  get on the air you've done it again info warriors now it's getting attention
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:02.200]  all over New York it's getting attention on CNN Fox you name it and people are
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:06.960]  having a debate about Building 7 and it all started because the judge when they
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.720]  were trying to get a city council investigation with their petition said
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:15.880]  building what when they were bringing up 7 and so the genies out of the bottle the
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:21.000]  cats out of the bag the trains left the station and 9-11 truth is only building
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:26.680]  its energy internationally and more and more people are looking at the evidence
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:30.200]  and that's got to feel good James for somebody like yourself who's seeking
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:34.400]  after justice you could have just sat there on the sidelines as a successful
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:39.160]  you know lawyer and as somebody who's also a chemical you know engineer why
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:46.880]  why did you get involved well I mean how can you not I don't I I don't know I
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:52.880]  mean that's that's basically what it comes down to I mean once I you know I
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:46:00.200]  first got into this during law school and maybe 2004 when I saw David David
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:06.120]  Ray Griffin giving a a talk at the University of Wisconsin and Madison on
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:12.000]  C-SPAN and I mean after you know I it probably took me a year year and a half
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.600]  of researching it before I could even convince myself that it was true just
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:21.080]  because it's I mean it's horrible to even think about this could be you know
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:27.120]  an inside job but the evidence is all there I mean it's undeniable so you
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:31.680]  once once you are armed with that information I mean I had to I had to
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:37.320]  start contributing in whichever ways I can and you know my science background
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:40.480]  I've got a degree in chemical engineering so I'm able to kind of
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:44.880]  contribute to some of the scientific aspects of it and also I'm an attorney
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:50.520]  so you know I'm able to do things like soonest whenever they ignore FOIA
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:57.480]  requests or try to or if they had tried to you know assess some kind of you know
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:01.080]  fee for releasing the materials I could have challenged them on that too so I'm
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.800]  just trying to you know contribute wherever I can yeah because they can
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:09.160]  just dump it on a hard drive and you know under FOIA you know more about it
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:12.600]  than I do but you know they're supposed to give the public this stuff and they
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:17.520]  do everything they they can to not release it there's also evidence in some
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:21.760]  of the videos of them editing things like in one building seven collapse
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:26.640]  footage I've seen it cuts in after the penthouse has already collapsed and
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:30.200]  that's very important because they claim that the collapse started somewhere
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:35.560]  else but that video that was already open source shows that it began with the
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:43.040]  penthouse yeah yeah they released like all the all the World Trade Center seven
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:46.560]  collapse videos they've sent me that I found so far that have that have good
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:52.640]  sound and are from close up to building seven have I don't I don't know I mean
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.880]  it's suspicious whether they may they might have cut out the collapse of the
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:01.600]  penthouse or what but the collapse of the the east penthouse is missing in
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:06.560]  in all the really good video and actually one of one of the videos that
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:10.480]  does show the collapse the east penthouse actually the soundtrack is
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:14.520]  missing until after the collapse is already over and then suddenly
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:20.320]  magically the soundtrack is back on so and and the reason that's important is
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:25.280]  one video they did release which was with a good soundtrack that shows the
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:32.000]  east penthouse collapsing it's shot from a further distance away and I think it
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:37.400]  was shot from inside a news band because there's not much sound but about a one
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:43.800]  second before the east penthouse collapse boom a really loud boom and I
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:48.920]  mean there's no way that that wasn't an explosive you know an explosion
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:54.160]  is the evidence of a crime how many times the cops the good old-fashioned
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:58.360]  cops which we had some more of them today I guess we still do in some cases when
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:02.160]  you see somebody trying to cover something up that's the evidence that
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:07.360]  you got the right guy and everywhere surrounding 9-11 is a cover-up I mean they
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:11.840]  had armed guards guarding the pieces of the rubble of seven tower one and two
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:16.160]  north and south tower they shipped it off to China they fought to not let
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:21.840]  people look at it there was molten 3000 degree steel a month and a half later I
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:26.120]  mean whatever they used to blow those up I mean this was pretty science fiction
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:33.040]  ask we know it wasn't jet fuel no it certainly wasn't and I yeah I've seen
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:39.360]  I've got several videos that have references to molten steel and rivers
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:45.560]  of steel flowing I need to I need to go ahead and you know rip it off the DVD
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:50.480]  that they sent me and put it up on my YouTube channel but I mean for example I
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:57.320]  I've got one video of a talk that Leslie Robertson who is the the structural
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:01.400]  structural engineer that helped build the twin towers he was giving a
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:06.640]  presentation at Stanford University and one of the students asks a question
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:11.520]  after it's over and he kind of gives the soft hander mark about how the cleanup
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:17.400]  crew took him down and showed him where there was a river of steel flowing
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:22.600]  underneath the debris and I mean it you can't contradict that I mean if this is
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:27.720]  a very high-level guy but we have all the firemen on video saying it was like
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:33.400]  a foundry it was just lava right and then you've got John growth at the
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:38.600]  University of Texas saying where was the molten metal I I've never seen this you
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:44.160]  know it's just unbelievable it is I want to come back and talk about how we get
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:49.400]  this video out faster to people and it might be a good idea to like put it on a
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:55.400]  website open source for folks to download in fact it costs me a lot of money to do
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:59.160]  it but if you want we put it on prison planet dot TV so everybody can just grab
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:03.160]  the raw stuff we'll be right back hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:07.080]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:10.800]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:14.480]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:17.760]  golden silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:21.880]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:27.280]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an

[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:34.080]  just out of control that doesn't mean everybody in the government's bad just
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:37.520]  like you know everybody in the police force in bad or everybody that works at
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:42.360]  a shoe store in bad but corrupt people tend to gravitate towards power

[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:54.120]  9-elevens an inside job but I shouldn't have to apologize for telling the truth
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:58.760]  we know we've been lied to six of the ten commissioners have come out on that
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:04.600]  subject and James Gordley the executive director of International Center for 9-11
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:13.520]  studies it's IC911studies.org we're gonna have Bob McElvane who lost his son
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:18.840]  that day with this groundbreaking Geraldo Rivera interview we're gonna play a clip
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:23.480]  of that where Geraldo came around you know the humanity of this engineer and
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:31.080]  the father who lost his son just laying out basic evidence Geraldo had a little
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:34.920]  humanity and people have asked why has Geraldo had me on a few times on other
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:41.320]  issues I I think he's a closet 9-eleven truth or I haven't been told that I
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:45.040]  know there's some other closet 9-eleven truthers at Fox I'm not gonna say any
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:52.480]  names I know what do you make James of Glenn Beck coming out and talking about
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:56.320]  I don't know if you've seen this that the government may stage terror attacks I
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:59.720]  mean the fact that Beck who's demonized anybody that talks about government
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:03.640]  sponsored terror the fact that he would come out now with something like that it
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:09.720]  really shows we're having an effect yeah I have trouble kind of understanding
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:13.560]  Glenn Beck I mean sometimes he seems really good on on issues and he'll have
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:18.600]  you know Tom Woods on to talk about a road to serfdom and and but then he'll
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:23.400]  go and just say the complete opposite the next day so I I don't know but I I
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:28.360]  mean I think they're I think everybody in media like you always say they all
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:33.640]  know it's an inside job but you know they fear for you know losing losing their
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:37.080]  job there you know their political elite status and all their inside
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:41.840]  connections it's probably what prevents them from really talking about it
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:47.280]  truthfully well that's another example as you hear about it's an AP KHL you
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:53.480]  broke it that almost all tap water in Texas has high levels of uranium and
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:59.040]  radium in it I mean high levels and that the state with the federal government
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:04.640]  has covered it up for several decades I have not seen that no well here's the
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:08.160]  scary thing what they don't tell you in these reports we've already covered here
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:13.240]  before in my point is I'm not just saying this now they they mine it at the
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:17.640]  phosphate mines out of the limestone that's also where you mine uranium
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:22.360]  they're not even pulling the uranium out of it they're putting the uranium in
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:26.520]  the tap water they're not just covering up that it's in there you know uranium
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:32.080]  isn't in natural tap water right I mean I hate to change subjects the point is
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:37.720]  is that how much do we sell out I mean what do we go along with I mean it's
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:42.320]  like we've become schizophrenic as a society where we're drinking uranium in
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:46.340]  the water the government staging terror attacks the troops are breathing
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:53.920]  depleted uranium I mean it's it's crazy yeah I think I mean I think 9-11 gives
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:58:00.320]  us the best chance to revolt you know to get government back in check and back
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:05.760]  to a you know a reasonable size and I mean I would also you know applaud you
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:10.000]  know God bless you and Matt Drudge for leading the charge on this TSA thing
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.680]  that's another great opportunity to fight back against government power and you
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:17.520]  guys have been an awesome job on keeping keeping the conversation going on that
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:20.160]  I'll tell you what do five more minutes with us because I want to talk about
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.880]  where the International Center for 9-11 studies is going in the future and
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:30.800]  finish up your take on the TSA revolt that's happening this is very exciting
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:37.200]  and if we have a victory here like we had on the carbon taxes last year then
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:42.080]  we realize we can have even more victories back in one minute
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:51.800]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live com today this is Alex Jones with
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:55.520]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:59.320]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:03.880]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:08.080]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:12.720]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:16.720]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:20.840]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:24.800]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:28.960]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:32.760]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:36.240]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:42.200]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:46.960]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[01:59:46.960 --> 02:00:05.720]  1-877-327-0365. Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio networks big
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:12.560]  brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:20.080]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:26.120]  Alex Jones okay we got Bob McElvane who lost his son on 9-11 join us for about
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:29.400]  30 minutes coming up then I'm gonna take a few phone calls and get into the
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:35.560]  economic news and some other important news we've got here in front of us but
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:41.600]  James Gorely chemical engineering is also a lawyer founder and executive
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:46.400]  director international Center for 9-11 studies just doing yeoman's work and needs
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:52.040]  your support you were finishing up with your comment on the TSA and your view on
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:55.920]  that and then you were telling me about some of the videos you guys have released
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:59.080]  now on the bit torrents you know the problem is when you got four and a half
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:03.080]  five terabytes even if we put that out and a thousand people downloaded five
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:06.640]  terabytes that would probably cost me ten thousand dollars I mean this stuff is
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:10.760]  expensive so they've they've gone from giving you nothing to just you know
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:16.720]  throwing the kitchen sink at you yeah that's right and I we actually have we
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:21.360]  have released one portion of the data that we've received and it's called the
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:26.280]  the cumulus the cumulus database which is what they called this searchable
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:31.120]  database of video clips that they used and they sent me basically that entire
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:36.240]  database except I think they would tell some things that they claim under one of
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:40.520]  the exemptions to FOIA but that's a whole nother story but our
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:43.880]  chief technical officer at the International Center has actually
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:49.040]  compressed that 500 gigabytes down to I think 80 or 100 gigabytes using a
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:54.120]  lawless compression algorithm and we released that over bit torrent and you
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:57.440]  know independent he tells me that thousands of people have been downloading
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.240]  it like there's been thousands of seeds on bit torrents so people it's going
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:04.800]  all over and then it gets uploaded on YouTube and then you know kind of the
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:11.360]  the the the the group mind the Liberty individualistic collective is then able
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:15.200]  to mine through it all very very exciting I I want to point out the
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:22.800]  drudge report is linked to our story about big sis you know caves in on the
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:27.400]  pilots who again who are they fly the aircraft they shouldn't have to go
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:33.640]  through security any security this is asinine but now we've got a new even
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:37.440]  more important article up at prison planet calm and I'm told it's going up
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:42.880]  on info wars calm it's big sis caught lying to the American people in her US
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:48.720]  say today peace and it's just all lies and it's so important to show how she's
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:54.080]  lying to you because then it destroys any credibility she had your comment on
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:58.400]  that James yeah I mean I've been really enjoying the coverage you've been
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:03.000]  giving it I mean it really warms my heart every time drudge links to your
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.400]  website to an article on your site because I know people are going to go
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:09.760]  there and they're going to be exposed to all kinds of other information that
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:13.520]  they need to see that they might not have been exposed to it otherwise so I
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:17.720]  mean it I think it's just great drudge is probably linked to your website what
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:22.080]  ten times in the last two weeks yeah I think it's I think it's exactly ten
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:27.840]  times he's been continually linked to us now for 11 days last night he took down
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:32.960]  in the articles we had and he put new ones up today and again drudge had
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:40.480]  nine billion page views this year alone nine billion that's not hits that's
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:45.920]  page views and they calculate that's probably more than seven billion people
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:50.040]  visiting it of course many of them over and over again but it's the number one
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:55.880]  news website in places like Japan in areas of Africa Europe I mean it just
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:01.680]  has such a huge effect and obviously it it it's buoying everything we do an
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:06.680]  info wars.com and prison planet.com and that's my goal is to try to bring
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:10.680]  sanity back to society and it just shows how far we've come again to have
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:16.280]  Geraldo Rivera coming out and saying yeah building seven looks suspicious needs
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:20.160]  to be investigated it's very exciting well James I look forward to talking to
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:23.760]  you again in the near future as you mine through all this incredible video and
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:28.200]  get more of it out to the public and we look forward to speaking to you again in

[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:12.880]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we pulling the rug from underneath
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:17.680]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:22.720]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:27.920]  American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:32.960]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:36.960]  on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:40.920]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we
[02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:44.640]  make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:50.640]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the

[02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:07.640]  the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans
[02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:11.600]  unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:15.000]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:18.920]  getting worse. Gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their
[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:22.800]  long expected journey to the moon in addition to converting your shrinking

[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:28.400]  Ladies and gentlemen we have a key story at prisonplanet.com it's big shits
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:34.800]  caught lying now that's a long thing to put in the Google search engine and I
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:38.640]  meant to do it the first hour but it didn't go up till about 15 minutes ago
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:43.560]  and it's an excellent detailed article that Steve Watson put together I know I
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:49.200]  took him a lot longer to put together there are so many lies it will make your
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:54.840]  head spin this is a big deal they staged the events of 9-11 they use it to
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:59.160]  federalize America their own internal homeland security reports say returning
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:06.640]  veterans gun owners libertarians and anti-war people anybody who's politically
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:12.840]  active you are the terrorist meanwhile the pilots they're trying to you'll
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:19.160]  grope them it's all about domination and control and they use 9-11 to launch
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:23.800]  all these illegal wars they use 9-11 to make the government more secretive with
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:27.640]  the trillions missing from the Pentagon it's over four trillion now it's
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:33.480]  bipartisan corruption and she writes a big article in USA Today written by Big
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:44.120]  Sis by Janet Napolitano and she writes this huge article and the entire thing
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:52.280]  is a tissue of lies so I want to Google search the term big sis caught lying
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:10:00.040]  big sis caught lying and you can alternately just put in big sis caught
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:09.200]  as another search but big sis caught lying big sis caught lying but BIGSIS
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:14.680]  caught lying or you could just say big sis lying there's a lot of different
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:18.200]  ways to put it in but whatever you do just pick one big sis caught lying let's
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:21.280]  just go with that as number one search term big sis caught lying four words
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:24.800]  big sis caught lying put into Google over and over again it's having a huge
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:31.960]  effect the globalist hate this this is a key way to revolt against these people
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:39.200]  big sis caught lying and then the other search term is big sis lying just take
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:43.400]  the caught out big sis lying and big sis caught lying and I know we'll make it
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:46.360]  number one it should be number one in the next two hours this is the ongoing
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:50.480]  revolt to show them the power of the American people let's show her what the
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:55.640]  alternative media can do she's in USA today telling us we search you in
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:59.560]  private areas no they don't they do it out in public the genital squeezing is
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:06.600]  not invasive there's no radiation in these the scientists say it's safe she
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:11.120]  goes on and says we've always been doing these pat downs which is a lie they are
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:15.560]  intensifying the pat downs in a way though it's true I was just in a video
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:20.040]  of a little three-year-old girl crying and screaming as a TSA worker grabs
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:26.600]  them in areas from two years ago I mean they've done these sometimes but now
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:30.960]  they want to do it to everybody so that's the change so it's just all lies
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:36.120]  she also says they're not saving the images which is an admitted lie big sis
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:40.600]  caught lying to the American people it's up at prisonplanet.com right now okay
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:45.480]  before we go to Bob McElvane who's no stranger to this show great patriot you
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:51.960]  know tells it like it is lost his son on 9-11 I want to play a brief clip of
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:56.600]  Geraldo Rivera and it's a seven-minute clip it's up on info wars.com and
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:02.720]  prisonplanet.com and it is extremely powerful and they show Larry Silverstein
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:07.440]  talking about giving the order to blow up seven which he said on television we're
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:09.640]  supposed to ignore that it's all hidden in plain view
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:15.640]  Geraldo Rivera changes his mind on architects and engineers for 9-1-1 truth and
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:20.440]  building what and at the end you know he says look I mean you know I see your
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:25.600]  perspective now this needs to be investigated here's the clip. Well I'm not done
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.360]  I'm still a parent I'm a parent who has an obligation to find out why my son was
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:37.160]  murdered as far as this show and New York City I want the investigation that
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:43.320]  will not be sufficient enough. And I'm going to be on that. Of course it's
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:47.280]  beginning but that's why I support this building what campaign. Bob McElvane we
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:52.520]  thank you Tony somebody thank you very much it is a for an intriguing topic I
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:57.080]  certainly am much more open-minded about it than I was and it is because of the
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:01.280]  involvement of the 9-11 families and all these engineers and architects clearly
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:06.160]  they know more than I do. Thanks gentlemen. Thank you. This is a Fox News 11.
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:12.560]  Okay so they've always had this lie on CNN Fox, MSNBC, CNBC that the families
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:20.040]  hate you when you talk about inside job or a new investigation. I've had the head
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:25.720]  of the biggest victims family group on the radio and it's in my film Terror
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:30.160]  Storm we have the clip and he said that half or more and that was four years ago
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:36.120]  of the 9-11 families believe total inside job and then he believes it. They
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:41.080]  had polls in New York of 83% believe they're being lied to. Angus and Reed
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:48.080]  New York Times poll 83% 2006. We've had CNN polls of 80 plus percent. We're the
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:52.200]  majority. Six of the 10 commissioners said it was a fraud in the line so this
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:56.240]  minority sets up there and says we're cooks we shouldn't look into this now
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.640]  it comes out Fox News and AP that and we're all a locking this is three weeks
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:07.640]  ago now the number three guy in Al Qaeda in 2001 now number one under bin Laden is
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:12.520]  hanging out secretly at the Pentagon with the top brass and the underwear
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:16.520]  bomber was gotten on the plane by the State Department under CIA orders this
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:20.440]  is all admitted and a lock he was in control of the Fort Hood shooter and he
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:25.600]  was protected. Yeah there's some fruit loop crazy Muslims out there like there's
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:30.040]  fruit loop crazy Christians or whatever or fruit loop crazy Jews or Germans or
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:33.240]  Italians or any other group and the point is the government's going out and
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:37.040]  finding them and then letting them do stuff to take our rights but that's not
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:42.160]  what happened on 9-11 this was a pure inside job they blew up building 7 in
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:48.200]  front of everybody and Bob McElvane what is it like for you to see Geraldo
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:51.240]  Rivera start to tell the truth and say oh because the families are involved
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:55.040]  you've always been involved the families were there at the Commission holding up
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:59.720]  signs saying lies lies lies you were there they ordered Sybil Evans the FBI
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:05.400]  translator not to talk she heard quote the CIA in command of bin Laden on 9-11
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:11.160]  she's broken her gag order as you know and it's the same story and what is it
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:14.280]  like for you now and your son that you lost till folks briefly about him so
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:17.840]  they can personalize this and understand to really start to see some
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:37.840]  headway get going here well you just can't believe how anxious I was going up there because you know this is what I did this is what I've done since 9-11 2001 and of course the media just refuses to cover it so we've got the call it was just yeah it's all for Bobby again to
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:45.040]  briefly talk about Bobby Bobby was 26 years old he had graduated from Princeton he started
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:48.560]  work in New York and hey it just started work with Merrill Lynch which was not in
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:56.400]  the towers you know I guess once they had two months before 9-11 and I am very
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:00.560]  so interested in the towers just not course just not seven but one and two
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:05.320]  because of the explosions which of course this which is National Institute of
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:09.840]  Standard Technology which investigated building seven and the 9-11 Commission
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:15.800]  which I made 90% of everyone just ignored the idea that there was explosion
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:23.400]  because you need explosions for demolition and it's taken me oh he's four
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:26.440]  or five years it took me at least four or five years to finally track down what
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:30.800]  happened to Bobby and I found out he talked to the doctors I know I know his
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:35.400]  injuries I have pictures of his injuries and he was one of the bodies found
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:40.480]  immediately one of the first ten bodies and he had died coming down he just
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:44.200]  got off the subway walked over to Merrill Lynch the way second side to go up
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:47.520]  on the 16th floor but before I think just as he walked into the lobby of the
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:53.680]  North Tower he was blown up you know and by now there's all these new NIST
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:58.840]  videos talking about how there were explosions going off and that's what
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:02.400]  Willie Rodriguez and others have said is that there were explosions going off
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:07.240]  before planes even hit like seconds before people understand that you need
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:10.760]  explosions and any demolition you're going to have explosions at that stage
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:15.800]  for the actual demolition itself so there's a strong possibility because
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:21.000]  again the nature of my son's injury injuries were chest and base severe
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:25.320]  lacerations all over the place that I think he was walking in the doors before
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:29.040]  the plane hit because suddenly the plane hit he would have run and if he had died
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:33.880]  he would have had injuries in the back so but that's beside the point so I
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:37.320]  taken his body home that week and it's taking me so long to find out exactly
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:42.120]  what did happen to him so the explosions are big key to me and of course as a
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:46.240]  parent I'm looking at this is hey these are the murders for my son and of course
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:51.200]  the press again the anger I had it's profound anger and but I need that
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:54.240]  anger because it keeps me going because you don't have that anger what is it
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:59.760]  like when you watch bush grandstanding on the pile it's brutal I guess you can
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:04.160]  imagine it's just again I can tell you if you have children your child was
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:08.640]  murdered and they refused to have an investigation yet you know who the
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:13.120]  murderers well that's it and of course a lot of medicine and then the murderers
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:18.120]  grandstand is our as our saviors as well right but it's just you just have to
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:24.240]  imagine that though and and that's right but the grandstanding so and you have to
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:27.240]  turn down your anger but this is why a lot of selling members won't speak up
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:30.680]  about it because you got to find other means to cope with life and to carry
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:34.440]  that anger around with these just mind boggling absolutely but the issue of the
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:40.800]  mainstream media having to start warming up to 9-11 truth because 7 stands on
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:45.400]  its own and if you look at the numbers and the polls 9-11 truth has gotten
[02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:50.520]  stronger not weaker and I believe this is the beginning of the system having to
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:56.800]  capitulate Bob I really hope I really you know and I I can't get optimistic
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:00.240]  because I you know you just keep doing knockdown constantly I mean I've been
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:04.160]  doing this for years and years you know I get my hopes up and you know this is
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:09.120]  going to be a beginning and I really do I mean it was a big big deal and we just
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:14.280]  got to keep after it but I just you know it's like taking baby steps I just have
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:17.600]  to say well maybe this will be the thing that throws us there for the top
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:21.120]  because I just want to especially the world to know that this is what
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:27.320]  governments do specifically in this case our government and and Colorado you know
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:33.680]  he's good he put it out there I spoke my piece I talked about night at the power
[02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:38.640]  era seven but he also let me say I said it was an inside job and it didn't come
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:42.600]  down jump all over me and call me all sorts of names so that that's progress
[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:46.280]  it really is no it's big progress well he couldn't sit there with two real
[02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:52.160]  human beings a father and an engineer and see the facts and then and then say
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:56.640]  hateful things to you I have a lot more respect for a role to riverum but I could
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:01.400]  tell him I got he was a truth or we'll be right back stay with us you know
[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:05.240]  someone who's a constitution basher then here's the ammo you need to silence

[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:19.640]  raped down for a long time Bob McElvane what's your view on the TSA and the
[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:24.360]  stuff going on I just can't see myself getting on a plane again because I
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:28.440]  mean talk about my anger and I can imagine someone searching me like that I
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:31.760]  think I'd have to punch him in the mouth I'm really worried about it because my
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:36.740]  way that's me still wants to travel and that I it's my model absolutely my
[02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:41.080]  mother and this whole course goes back to 9-11 and that's that's why this that's
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:45.000]  why 9-11 is so important everything has happened I mean the world is just
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:49.080]  upside down and this and what they do is you know when you're talking about
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:54.280]  al-Qaeda we have to realize this is this is all a myth it's it's part of the why
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:58.880]  it's become a myth and President Kennedy said it once he said it the enemy of
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:02.680]  truth is not the why it is the myth when it does become a myth and that's the
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:05.960]  bad thing of this also have to do is mention al-Qaeda but no one has to clue
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:11.000]  what al-Qaeda is and that's that's what it you know again the anger is just
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.280]  mind-blowing I don't know how I'm gonna go on a plane I just don't know what
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:18.000]  will happen because I mean I always worry about you know losing my temper like
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:23.160]  that well here you are with these with these with these goons and you know
[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:27.360]  it's an inside job and everything they're doing is made up built on a
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:31.840]  fraud and Bob I wish every time that there was a terror attack I'm like
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:35.360]  please let it be a real Muslim because that's not very scary knowing there's a
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:38.360]  few you know nuts out there I mean there's people getting mugged and killed
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:41.680]  every day in the town I live in of a million people and they don't act like
[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:45.360]  it's the end of the world when somebody gets killed that's what goes on but then
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:49.520]  if it's a Muslim blowing something up it gets a million times scarier and we've
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:53.320]  got to give all our rights up and then every time you research it it's the
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:58.320]  government behind it all right and that's we know that's how do you get the
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:02.040]  how do we get that in the schools I mean it it's understanding history you know
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:06.640]  especially since the 70s when they developed this strategy of tension you
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:09.520]  know when they were working with these people forever that's what people have
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:13.480]  to understand it's easy to find a path to do these these bidding things like
[02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:17.520]  you know you have some joker on a plane that someone let them on you know he's
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:20.960]  from what from India you know from the State Department I mean it's ridiculous
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:26.160]  but if you travel around the world you realize that we especially in the
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:30.680]  United States live in a bubble and especially if you talk to people in
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:34.440]  Russia they know it's propaganda here we still think it's repressed and that's
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:38.920]  our biggest storm problem this country I think that's starting to change well
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:45.560]  it's building what dot org and it's it's having a big effect and folks have
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:49.160]  been supporting and getting the word out and Bob I appreciate you popping in
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:53.440]  with us today but you know even if it takes five years ten years we're
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:57.760]  winning in the court of public opinion the government is losing its tool of
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:02.240]  stage terror even Glenn Beck last week said the government may stage in
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:08.000]  Oklahoma City what's your take on that well I I try hard not to listen to
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:15.800]  Glenn Beck I mean if he's right but you know I I try to avoid watching TV sure
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:21.320]  sure but what I'm saying is regardless to stay in the game to to stay relevant
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.680]  Geraldo Rivera is you know talking about inside job and saying boy that's a good
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:30.480]  point I see what you're saying and Glenn Beck's talking about Obama blowing
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:35.280]  stuff up right well I got news for you back they all blow stuff up they blow
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:42.640]  stuff up in Argentina on September 11th decades ago with Pinochet or Chile
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:48.240]  excuse me you know they do it all over the world it's been declassified grow up
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:53.080]  and realize that Hitler did it Beck and stop attacking people like us that tell
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.640]  the truth that's right that's what has you know and some people have to be
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:28:00.920]  educated that's what it's all about we've only got a few minutes left Bob but
[02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:10.720]  any other points you'd like to impart to the listening audience well you know
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:14.360]  he talked to us a few minutes before we went on the air and again I was very
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:20.480]  anxious about it and I just think he did a wonderful job so yeah we just that
[02:28:20.480 --> 02:28:25.800]  that's where the hope is that the fact that he did that and he wanted to talk
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:28.880]  about Bobby but he actually explained to me he said look we just don't have the
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:33.120]  time because there's something certain key points I want to make and and then
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:37.280]  the people you know behind his scenes everyone just treated us tremendously so
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:42.200]  that gives me hope well and another quick story we walked out of the studio and
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:47.680]  Huckabee was there and he was he used to appear like in 10 minutes later and he
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:50.880]  stood up grabbed our hands shook our hands and he said this is a scam and I
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:56.600]  just can't believe it so it it it's all about the media the fact that the media
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:00.840]  has kept this hidden you know we got actually felt it I didn't know this
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:05.320]  about building seven and it's a controlled demolition if everyone in the
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:09.080]  world seen that they think that is a controlled demolition no if and then
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.640]  but the fatty so therefore this is where we're gonna start this investing is
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:18.080]  someone had a demolition company let's talk to Juliana this has to come and
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:23.320]  then put a steamroll into the whole 9 11 scenario because the 9 11 people are
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:27.680]  going let's just this be the only thing happened as far as I tell you what Bob
[02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:31.080]  you're on to something key here stay with us a few more minutes before I get
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:36.280]  into the economy and this bombshell TSA information I want to come back and

[02:33:56.720 --> 02:34:02.440]  the people that got caught torturing in prison but Bush gets to admit he ordered
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:10.280]  it that's at GCN live dot com and we've got a new breaking story flashback
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:16.920]  TSA goon my last three-year-old that's at GCN live dot com we're gonna play the
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:25.440]  footage of the news person filming it as the little girls crying and being
[02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:32.440]  grabbed on so just amazing information also big sis caught lying to the
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:39.120]  American people I'm glad drudge linked to our TSA caves on molesting pilots but
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:42.680]  I think this big sis caught lying to the American people this is what everybody
[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:47.000]  needs to see to understand this which is a liar I want to go over that
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:52.840]  information before I hit some economic news but finishing up the very informative
[02:34:52.840 --> 02:35:00.160]  point that Bob McElvane who lost his son on 9-11 was covering in truth rising
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:04.920]  we are changing work got footage of Bo Deedle who had protested because he's a
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:09.320]  co-host sometimes with the Rol de Rivera they were having a live show outside I
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:13.160]  protested and you know Deedle was acting like a tough guy and stuff so I was
[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:18.000]  screaming at him but then he saw we are changed later and said I want to talk to
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:25.040]  you guys you know the way those buildings came down and had to be bombs and
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:28.240]  that's what other police environments said well now we have all those videos
[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:34.560]  confirming it but when you get these guys on the street as human beings I don't
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:37.640]  want to get into it but I know quite a few people at Fox I'll just leave it at
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:45.960]  that and most of them know that 9-11 is an inside job you've got cowards like
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:52.820]  Sean Hannity who enjoys selling the lies Beck has demonized 9-11 truth
[02:35:52.820 --> 02:35:57.800]  viciously and seems to enjoy it but now how is he going to do that if he's
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:02.640]  talking about Obama might blow up federal buildings I mean you know how can
[02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:06.720]  he talk about something that's a real threat because Democratic strategist are
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:11.400]  talking about it openly like we don't exist and we don't see it Bob you were
[02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:14.920]  getting into some of the things that are happening and how we could really
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:19.920]  investigate this and you know really start going and talking to the control
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:23.440]  demolition companies going and confronting Giuliani you know really
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:38.960]  going to the people that we know are covering up you know if anybody if you're talking about anything it is impossible and that's
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:44.480]  there's no if and but impossible that a building a steel building can come down
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:51.000]  in freefall so therefore the whole story is all everyone's lied so then you take
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  right so we have you know if we have an investigation and you just that's step
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:00.360]  one go to demolition people bring them into a trial and Giuliani his actions
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:05.160]  that day Jerry Howard could that could not pass the security security firm which
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:11.280]  handle security you know that day and he just keep going from there to there and
[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:15.880]  you go to both towers and then we prove it's a controlled demolition which is so
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:21.640]  easy to do you can't argue impossible when you have a science a mechanical
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:26.280]  engineer on TV saying it's impossible for steel to bend like that with that
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:30.720]  resistance but you can't argue that that's why I had to be there that's why
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:34.640]  they won't have you on TV because what are you going to say and you look at the
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:37.320]  firm's I mean you got to be there it's not to know that that's a controlled
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:42.280]  demolition the only person ever to get on with Hannity was Governor Ventura and
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:46.920]  he was in person with him right and I don't think he was intimidated by Ventura
[02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:52.320]  size he was intimidated by the gravitas of just Ventura going look I was you
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:56.760]  know in great underwater demolition they blew those buildings up you know it fell
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:03.520]  freefall and there's Hannity who's always talking about his houses and his
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:07.880]  Rolexes and how much he loves money well I hope you enjoy that money when you go
[02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:13.440]  to hell buddy because that's where traders go and you know I hope that gold
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:18.600]  is worth it when you go to Hades or 20 pieces of silver now it's never too late
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:24.800]  Hannity and Beck and others who've persecuted 9-11 truth to turn around and
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:28.640]  tell the truth even if you lose everything you've got you'll have your
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:33.880]  integrity but look you know that's why I'm have a that's why I have a feeling of
[02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:38.800]  satisfaction I mean I've had laryngitis for two weeks I'm very sick today it's
[02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:43.160]  gotten worse I can hardly talk I have to focus every second just to not start
[02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:49.360]  coughing and I don't want sympathy or a thousand phone calls with the curers I
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:56.880]  should use the issue is I'm here because this is important I mean wild horses
[02:38:56.880 --> 02:39:03.040]  couldn't drag me away from this information because I know we're having
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:07.440]  victory and I know that resistance is victory when you've got the truth even
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:11.400]  if you're outnumbered a hundred to one as the Texas Rangers said the founder of
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:15.760]  the Texas Rangers a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:20.280]  right who keeps on a coming you can't just be right you've got to just keep
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:24.000]  coming and not care what people say about you when you've got the truth
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.920]  you're gonna win Bob McElvane God bless you people need to get behind the

[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:14.720]  diaphragm gets super sore because you've been coughing so much you can't sleep at
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:21.400]  night I'm not complaining I just I dread this interrogation I'm gonna get in a
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:24.680]  couple days from a big national magazine with a big cover story they're
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:32.040]  doing because if I don't get some sleep I'm gonna be dumber in a box of rocks so
[02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:35.200]  I am operating here in the last two weeks with very little sleep because you
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:39.400]  wake up coughing like the devil well you know how it is if you've had a chest
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:42.680]  cold but it's in like a chest cold I haven't had a fever it's just like
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:48.560]  something's coating my lungs all right now I'm whining let's get into the big
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:54.200]  news there is a complete collapse of the globalist program with the T.S. Ray if
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:58.160]  they fail here they fail everywhere you better believe they're gonna find some
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:01.680]  jacked-up crazies to try to get on planes with bombs or they're just gonna
[02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:06.040]  put one in the undercarriage of a plane and blow it out of the air I would
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:10.400]  imagine this big counter-response to these bullies these thugs who are trying
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:14.800]  to train us how to submit is gonna be stage terror attacks that's why you can't
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:20.600]  just expose the groped down the rate down the the radiation from the scanners
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:26.360]  and their lies about it you've also got to attack the foundation of their fraud
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:31.120]  that there are big mommy our big brother our big daddy big sis but this
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:36.440]  article big sis caught lying American people this is so important to get out
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:44.200]  to everyone it's so important to Google search big sis caught lying big sis caught
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:48.560]  lying because she's in USA today they're having press conferences they're having
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:55.320]  to respond they're on the defensive now and when people find out members is two
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:59.120]  weeks ago the TSA said we don't touch genitals even though their own press
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:02.640]  release from a week before said it and there's all the videos of it see they're
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:08.240]  losing all credibility and oh she says we do this in a private place no they do
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:13.040]  it out in the open and she says we don't save the images big lie she says
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:18.880]  there's no radiation danger lie we've got her this article by Steve Watson is
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:22.280]  one of the best he's written the last year great researcher political
[02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:28.120]  scientist Steve Watson prison planet comm info wars comm and then jaren shows
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:32.680]  me another video from two years ago a local newscast and this is why this is
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:36.640]  gonna fail there's a lot of petty media people that when their ox gets gore
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:40.120]  they're gonna get angry and that's what's happening with Chicago Tribune and
[02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:45.040]  New York Times writers you know some man grabs their in squeezes they let make
[02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:48.120]  sure that it in the bomb it's like they're you know handling grapefruit or
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:53.400]  something let me see if this is ripe I mean they really squeeze look nobody no
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:57.320]  I'm not going through your scanner and nobody is putting their hands on my
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:01.960]  genitals and they admit that they want to phase in scanning for everyone that's
[02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:08.480]  admitted don't you understand of course I'm angry of course I want to fly like
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:14.320]  I've done a couple times to the Caribbean and go snorkeling and scuba diving for
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:21.160]  a week can't do it can't take my children to Disneyland or Disney World I
[02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:26.040]  can't fly you know to monument Valley and show them you know how beautiful that
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:34.280]  is I'm having my mobility shut down this is by design oh gives me a headache
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:41.360]  this video is a shocker it's shocker TSA has been molesting children for years
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:46.200]  and that's what this is anybody else did this in a park you go to jail here's
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:51.720]  the short newscast reaction from that video well we sure did the little girl
[02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:55.760]  you saw getting searched against her will obviously at an airport it's the
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:59.280]  three-year-old daughter of our own Steve Simon yeah that incident led Steve to
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:02.960]  ask the Transportation Security Administration some important questions
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:07.040]  and the answers can help all of us frankly Steve is here and it was
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:10.600]  probably tough on you but for Mandy it had a been frantic she was a little bit
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:14.800]  scared yeah but also a little bit cranky yeah as well she's okay three yeah
[02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:18.920]  she's three years old but first I want to make it very clear and I understand I
[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:22.800]  want to let you know that there has to be some sacrifice and some balance when
[02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:27.480]  it comes to security at the airport get pause so we have to grovel to the
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:32.640]  minimum wage people grabbing the little girls rear end and legs this is two years
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:38.440]  ago no it's a fraud they know it's a fraud to make pilots do it if you don't
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:43.000]  trust a pilot to have no security check he shouldn't be flying the stinking
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:48.440]  airplane come on every time they quote the underwear bomber the State
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:53.640]  Department was ordered to get him on the plane it was all staged okay and I know
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:59.160]  I keep repeating that it's all a fraud we're done so this guy's little girls
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:05.320]  getting grabbed listen people have these instincts for a reason my daughters
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:10.280]  when men are around they don't know a plumber or whatever they get quiet if I
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:14.360]  try to introduce them to people especially men they get quiet even though
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:18.360]  they're rambunctious and wild with people they know that's an instinct
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:22.800]  that's like a little dog when a big dog comes in the room a little puppy you'll
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:29.520]  go get underneath something that's an instinct okay so oh his daughter was a
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:35.040]  little cranky there's a person grabbing all over it's scaring her it's out in
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:40.400]  front of people this child has a normal instinct look you're not gonna brutalize
[02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:45.200]  and psychologically damage my children you understand and they want to have
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:49.560]  mobile checkpoints to do this they want to take blood they want in your life they
[02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:54.800]  suck off of us they want to buffalo us and break us and it's not gonna happen
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:59.040]  get it through yourself centered fool yourself government thug police state
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:03.360]  head your bosses are the terrorists let's finish the clip I came home from
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:10.240]  that trip recently that balance just didn't feel right let's face kids
[02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:16.520]  airports and security can be a tough mix it's a big pain of it last month at the
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:21.080]  airport in Chattanooga Tennessee my three-year-old daughter Mandy went from
[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:29.920]  this happy little girl to this during an ordeal through secure my cell phone has
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:35.040]  about 17 seconds of this here at TSA employee we've decided not to show is
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:40.000]  patting down Mandy while my wife holds her first they try to handheld metal
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:45.280]  detector Mandy was not in the mood and the TSA employee well in my opinion did
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:51.480]  not know how to communicate all of this started after Mandy's teddy bear was
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:56.640]  taken away for screening through the extra and that started the crime which
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:00.720]  meant Mandy had a tough time going through one of those metal detectors it
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:06.400]  also meant the alarm went off twice TSA officials tell me when that alarm goes
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:15.120]  off twice everyone no matter how old you are must be hand-served but didn't have
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:22.480]  to be like this is there a better way in reality what what we as an agency should
[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:29.720]  be doing or employees is looking at that child with a little bit of difference
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:34.000]  in how we handle the child James March on with the TSA would not comment
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:39.040]  specifically on the cell phone video but he says some TSA screeners should
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:43.800]  follow some advice you try to make it as best you can for that child to come
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:50.160]  through if you can come up with something to know more it's it's up on
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:54.480]  prison planet and infowars if you want to see it but the issue here is this has
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:48:00.720]  been going on for a long time now we're waking up to it and saying no that's all
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:04.560]  that's happening I'm gonna skip this final break because I've got to get into
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:08.240]  the economy and the plunging dollar and their attempts to manipulate gold and
[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:15.240]  silver also wouldn't be able to do this radio show without our sponsors and one
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:20.240]  of them is this awesome new knife and they've for self-defense and they've
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:26.320]  got a video up on their website theultimateknife.com it's the Fox
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:31.240]  Karambit and it's form-fitted and beveled to be the most comfortable knife ever
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:35.120]  held and it's about half the price of similar knives in fact I found this
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:39.920]  knife for almost double on many other sites it has the Emerson wave catch
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:43.720]  feature allows you to open it with one hand faster than a switchblade with no
[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:49.640]  springs it's got the Talon feature it's the Fox Karambit knife at theultimateknife.com
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:57.400]  and they've got $10 off this month only for the gold G10 model so that's the
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:05.880]  ultimate knife.com and there's banners up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:09.360]  but I suggest you go watch the video I've also got a training knife on there
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:13.920]  you need to get the knife you learn how to use it continuing one other great
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:18.360]  sponsor that's made the broadcast possible that's food production systems
[02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:24.920]  for backyard or small farm DVD video with bonus resources CD I've been sent a
[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:28.400]  lot of these and this is so good starting in a few weeks we're going to be
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:32.480]  carrying on the online video bookstore shopping cart at infowars.com but
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:36.000]  they're also going to continue to be a sponsor and I think you should go to
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:42.920]  www.backyardfoodproduction.com that's backyardfoodproduction.com it's a DVD
[02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:49.480]  and an information CD that is invaluable how to do it in small backyard areas or
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:55.600]  small family farms you know the experts on fruit trees butchering chickens
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:50:04.120]  vegetables eggs rabbits dogs working dogs orchards this is just invaluable
[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:08.560]  information it's so much fun and if you're a farming family or folks that
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:12.160]  are in the gardening get it and give it to folks as a gift it's backyardfood
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:17.080]  production.com becoming self-sufficient getting back to the land it's just so
[02:50:17.080 --> 02:50:24.160]  so incredibly essential in our society you know I'm gonna talk more about this
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:27.560]  tomorrow on the show we're getting to get some guests on about it but the fact
[02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:31.280]  that they're giving hundreds and hundreds of waivers in different waves to
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:34.800]  McDonald's and other big companies where they don't have to get insurance for
[02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:38.960]  their employees but everybody else does no one can compete against these people
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:42.480]  it's kind of like big companies get tax exemption but then little companies
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:45.840]  don't that's why they're consolidating power and it's just pure
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:54.280]  tyranny I want to get more into that I also have my you know crazy economy
[02:50:54.280 --> 02:51:01.720]  stack here that I want to go over some here in just a few minutes but I
[02:51:01.720 --> 02:51:21.480]  promised to get to this video excuse me folks had a cough a little bit there I
[02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:27.440]  wanted to go over this video with audio for listeners warning it is very
[02:51:27.440 --> 02:51:33.720]  graphic this is what teenagers are playing everywhere all across the
[02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:37.960]  country and the world this is one of the best-selling video games out there
[02:51:37.960 --> 02:51:41.720]  when these video games come out they make hundreds of millions of dollars
[02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:49.400]  Call of Duty black ops the latest version shows good guys using torture
[02:51:49.400 --> 02:51:54.800]  and when I was at Target yesterday buying some socks and clothes for the kids
[02:51:54.800 --> 02:52:00.040]  there were giant in caps in front of the cash registers with nothing but Call of
[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:06.360]  Duty black ops and Bush orders torture they torture people you don't get real
[02:52:06.360 --> 02:52:15.680]  intelligence it's only good for fake confessions and to scare people and what
[02:52:15.680 --> 02:52:23.280]  he'd now now Bush has come out repeatedly in the last few months he did he did
[02:52:23.280 --> 02:52:27.440]  again last week and said you better order torture not ordered it again you know I
[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:36.360]  kept you safe with that torture and when you look at this and when you
[02:52:36.360 --> 02:52:42.080]  understand what's going on and and how they're bathing us in evil and how
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:46.320]  they're conditioning us to accept corruption and how they're telling us the
[02:52:46.320 --> 02:52:50.840]  good guys torture and then people do simulated torture over and over again it
[02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:55.320]  disconnects them from reality and turns them into monsters you know the bad
[02:52:55.320 --> 02:52:59.720]  guys torture but that's why the globalist stage the terror attacks so
[02:52:59.720 --> 02:53:02.960]  they could molest our kids so they could teach us to torture so they could
[02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:07.040]  have dramas on TV where the hero tortures even people's children they are
[02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:11.360]  turning us into devils to be their imperial army for the world government
[02:53:11.360 --> 02:53:15.080]  while we lose all of our liberties and freedoms so let's go ahead and play the
[02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:20.160]  short clip of torture from Call of Duty black ops here are the Americans the
[02:53:20.160 --> 02:53:23.640]  good guys torturing and of course they're always doing it to stop something
[02:53:23.640 --> 02:53:29.040]  bad so it's it's morally good this is pure evil here it is you clearly don't
[02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:41.400]  know anything about Dragon's I have nothing to gain by talking to you think
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:51.360]  about what you have to lose what's glass in his mouth and that punches it do
[02:53:51.360 --> 02:53:55.760]  this all day we got plenty of windows or you can give us what we want and we
[02:53:55.760 --> 02:53:59.880]  guarantee your safety of course if you really touch somebody like that then
[02:53:59.880 --> 02:54:06.080]  John make it I've already I've been hunted across every corner of the
[02:54:06.080 --> 02:54:11.600]  globe but if you found me so will they they know everything you know they're
[02:54:11.600 --> 02:54:16.600]  probably on their way now why
[02:54:16.600 --> 02:54:22.840]  Dragovich doesn't like loose ends I've never even dealt with him directly
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:32.400]  only Steiner the job what was the nature of your business I was hired to help
[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:41.480]  stabilize sunny volatile compounds what kind of compound is Nova 6
[02:54:41.480 --> 02:54:55.600]  biochemical weapon okay so there's the brainwashing they tortured him they got
[02:54:55.600 --> 02:55:00.040]  the answers torture is good that's what tens of millions of youth are doing and
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:04.200]  they're taught unrealistic warfare in battle so they all go sign up to be the
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:08.320]  military so they can be shot up with vaccines you know the real bio weapon
[02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:14.200]  and breathe DU so it's just total false reality I wanted to shift gears here at
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:19.560]  the end of this hour with Ted Anderson and we saw them with the G20 Friday try
[02:55:19.560 --> 02:55:23.720]  to drive down gold and silver because it competes with their fiat currencies it
[02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:28.680]  shot way back up today then it shot way back down then it shot way back up
[02:55:28.680 --> 02:55:33.240]  there is a battle to drive down gold and silver and we've seen this every time
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:38.480]  the trend is only up and so people should take this time because I know you
[02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:43.120]  ran in and bought gold and silver when it did go down Ted to get back into the
[02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:47.400]  market before it runs back up though that's already happening so briefly
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:50.760]  Ted good to have you here what's your take before we give folks today silver
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:54.800]  and gold deals on every few weeks he issues hundreds and hundreds of waivers
[02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:59.360]  it was 111 last Friday to companies where they don't have to get insurance I
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:03.280]  wonder if Midas Resources or Genesis Communications Network are gonna get
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:07.400]  waivers from Obama to not have to buy insurance you know I don't know about
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:10.600]  that Alex because you know that they probably wouldn't do it for us they
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:14.080]  want to help us in any way but yeah you're right there's so much
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:18.240]  manipulation and stuff going on I mean the G20 meeting it was just so obvious
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:22.760]  first thing they do is they raise the reserve requirements of the futures
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:28.040]  market which drives the silver prices down a little bit because you know now
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:33.320]  you have to have about another what is it a point four percent opiate like it
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:39.560]  used to cost $5,000 for a contract to one up to 6500 anyways I mean it did it
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:43.120]  and then you've got China trying to raise the interest rates on their own
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:46.360]  market to drive the prices of gold and silver down I mean it was just this
[02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:51.680]  international push to push market prices down and gold and silver to to
[02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:55.520]  support these fiat currencies yeah the fraudsters have been trying this for
[02:56:55.520 --> 02:56:59.880]  years but now they're failing because they're playing the same old game but
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:03.360]  they're accelerating their hyperinflation which is a new part to the
[02:57:03.360 --> 02:57:06.520]  equation tell folks we only got about two minutes left about the different
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:14.880]  gold and silver offers the number is 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 Ted tell folks
[02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:18.640]  the offer Alex the best deal that I have out there right now are the three
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:22.920]  videos that you have the fall of the republic end game and the Obama
[02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:27.760]  deception there are $101 I mean you just can't beat that you get a you know that
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:30.960]  shipping included I mean I mean the silver almost cost the hundred one
[02:57:30.960 --> 02:57:35.560]  dollars then with the shipping it is above 101 then a $60 value three of my
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:40.960]  most powerful films on top of it 800 686 2237 what about the silver half
[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:44.680]  dollars what about the silver half dollars currently right now are at 1284
[02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:48.440]  although I know the prices have gone up over 15 here recently with them so
[02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:53.520]  that is a really good buy as well Frank's right now 301 British sovereigns
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:58.720]  377 there's a there's a lot of stuff they can get involved with I mean gold
[02:57:58.720 --> 02:58:06.680]  did run up today it hit 1377 90 silver went up to 2651 very strong day for gold
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:12.280]  and silver both and what are they doing the unit the Fed buys 7.9 billion
[02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:16.240]  dollars in bonds just today alone this morning Monday I mean that's fiat money
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:20.640]  just coming right into the system they can't drive gold prices down and print
[02:58:20.640 --> 02:58:24.440]  money at the same time it's not possible no they can't folks I'm out of here

[02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:58.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:02.840]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:06.880]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:59:06.880 --> 02:59:10.760]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:59:10.760 --> 02:59:15.040]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:19.200]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:23.520]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:59:23.520 --> 02:59:27.240]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:59:27.240 --> 02:59:31.440]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:59:31.440 --> 02:59:34.840]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
