[00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:09.300]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.880]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.441]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:16.623]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.623 --> 00:00:20.685]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.924]  Hadn't had him on in a few months, a regular guest.
[00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:34.206]  Kind of fell through the cracks.
[00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:37.591]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us today, coming up.
[00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.374]  Former editor of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:46.034]  Former head of policy, Department of the Treasury, best-selling author.
[00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:47.655]  He is joining us.
[00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:53.399]  Also, our regular Friday scheduled one-hour interview with Bob Chapman on the economy every Friday.
[00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.981]  Boy, more important than ever each week as he comes on with us.
[00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:57.882]  That is coming up.
[00:00:57.882 --> 00:00:59.142]  And your phone calls today.
[00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:05.146]  And then Daniel Sanjata, star of Rescue Me and many other TV shows and films.
[00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:17.598]  He was out in New York a few years ago and I got arrested for protesting Geraldo Rivera at an outside event he was doing and Daniel Sanjada was there, got a chance to interview him a few times over the years.
[00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:30.311]  I've been wanting to get him on the last few weeks and it's perfect timing he's on today because I want to get his take on Glenn Beck saying that 9-11 truthers basically worship
[00:01:31.553 --> 00:01:40.159]  Von Brun, the deranged killer of the poor security guard at the Holocaust Museum Memorial.
[00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:54.628]  Since then, I got a whole passel of MSNBC Fox News clips saying, the Department of Homeland Security report is absolutely right.
[00:01:54.628 --> 00:01:57.470]  Just amazing.
[00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.492]  They're saying that
[00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:03.239]  Yes, it is veterans, it is gun owners.
[00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:07.784]  They're basically all secretly white supremacists.
[00:02:07.784 --> 00:02:10.627]  And 9-11 truthers are white supremacists.
[00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:15.553]  And Oberman tied in Ron Paul with Von Brun and Limbaugh yesterday.
[00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:19.277]  I mean, they're really getting desperate, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:27.243]  Because the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve is going to be audited whether it passes this time or not.
[00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:29.845]  222 sponsors as of yesterday.
[00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:31.787]  I'm told it's got even more today.
[00:02:31.787 --> 00:02:33.449]  But it passed the threshold yesterday.
[00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.650]  It will go to the floor.
[00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.494]  Ron Paul will want to rally his forces and prepare to do it.
[00:02:42.073 --> 00:02:43.314]  That should be in the next week or two.
[00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:48.260]  That should be brought to the House floor in this session for debate.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.084]  And can you imagine those that are going to get up and defend?
[00:02:51.084 --> 00:02:57.491]  No, no government agency, Congress, the courts, the executive, nothing can investigate it, nothing can audit it.
[00:02:57.491 --> 00:02:58.553]  It's above the law.
[00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:20.852]  And that Greenspan clip, there are literally scores, I quit counting after 30 or 40, look like hundreds, of versions of him on Laird NewsHour saying, we're above the law, no one can investigate us, and hundreds and hundreds of different clips of Bernie Sanders, the Senator, asking Bernanke, you know, where the money is, and Bernanke says, I don't have to tell you, chump.
[00:03:20.852 --> 00:03:23.033]  We own you, basically.
[00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:38.724]  So see, all these years, all the G. Edward Griffins and the Ezra Pounds before him, the Aaron Russos, so many people that are alive and dead.
[00:03:39.738 --> 00:03:40.958]  Who deserve credit.
[00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.339]  We deserve credit here on this show.
[00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:44.299]  You deserve credit as listeners.
[00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.121]  In just pushing and pushing and pushing and saying Federal Reserve, real government.
[00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:51.062]  Federal Reserve is the true government.
[00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:52.902]  That both parties are bought and paid for by.
[00:03:52.902 --> 00:03:56.063]  And the military industrial complex comes out of its loins.
[00:03:56.063 --> 00:03:57.804]  Everything is spawned by it.
[00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:03.026]  And in itself is a regional governorship of the black nobility of Europe.
[00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:05.566]  The royalty.
[00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:06.927]  The Saxe-Coburg Gothas.
[00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:20.784]  The Black Nobility out of Italy, Rome, the Rothschilds, all an unholy alliance bringing you the New World Order.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.626]  And the establishment now knows they can't hide the world government, so they want to have scapegoats and only make the world government about one group.
[00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:29.386]  Oh, the U.S.
[00:04:29.386 --> 00:04:33.830]  runs it, or oh, the Jews run it, or oh, the Vatican runs it, or oh, no.
[00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:44.639]  All these powerful centers of power are all interwed, intermarried, and make up the global elite, and they're waging war on all of us, black, white, Hispanic, Jewish, Chinese, Eskimo,
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.120]  I knew it.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.924]  The New World Order is attacking all of free humanity and they play us off against each other in tribal politics.
[00:04:52.924 --> 00:04:54.885]  And that's the message they don't want out.
[00:04:54.885 --> 00:04:57.466]  That's why they killed Martin Luther King.
[00:04:57.466 --> 00:05:00.047]  That's why they killed Gandhi.
[00:05:00.047 --> 00:05:01.748]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.748 --> 00:05:04.730]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.491]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:07.692]  We need to be independent.
[00:05:07.692 --> 00:05:09.452]  And food and water is the key.
[00:05:09.452 --> 00:05:12.494]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:05:12.494 --> 00:05:13.995]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome
[00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:18.558]  And beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:05:18.558 --> 00:05:21.801]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:28.806]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:49.882]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.811]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:04.633]  A New World Order.
[00:06:04.633 --> 00:06:09.536]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:12.357]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:12.357 --> 00:06:15.139]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.321]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:25.665]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:34.108]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:34.108 --> 00:06:37.989]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:40.530]  Bill Ferguson makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.551]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:42.491]  They're not after money.
[00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:43.792]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:44.752]  They're after power.
[00:06:44.752 --> 00:06:45.912]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:06:45.912 --> 00:06:54.376]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:54.376 --> 00:06:57.437]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:57.437 --> 00:06:58.077]  You have been
[00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:02.872]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:07:02.872 --> 00:07:06.773]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:07:06.773 --> 00:07:10.495]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:07:10.495 --> 00:07:17.537]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:19.539]  I think so.
[00:07:43.736 --> 00:07:46.698]  And ship all orders over $50 free of charge.

[00:07:52.002 --> 00:07:52.643]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[00:07:52.643 --> 00:07:54.104]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:54.104 --> 00:07:55.745]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.598 --> 00:08:20.183]  I was digging through the stacks of news for the last three or four days and there's probably 30, 40 incredibly important stories I may have mentioned but never broke down.
[00:08:20.183 --> 00:08:23.665]  I want to try to go through some of those in this hour.
[00:08:23.665 --> 00:08:28.368]  Even if I just get the headline in and then my take on it, at least I want to kind of blitz through that.
[00:08:28.368 --> 00:08:31.770]  It's important to bring some light to all of this.
[00:08:33.617 --> 00:08:37.780]  Also, I want to let everybody know we've got Bob Chapman, the International Forecaster, joining us next hour.
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:43.684]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Head of Policy, Department of the Treasury, Wall Street Journal Editor, formerly, coming on about the economy.
[00:08:43.684 --> 00:08:55.793]  Daniel Sanjata, of Rescue Me fame and many other TV shows and movies, 9-11 truther, to respond to Glenn Beck, saying that Von Brun is worshipped and loved and admired with no evidence.
[00:08:55.793 --> 00:08:56.573]  He doesn't give a source.
[00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:57.054]  He just says,
[00:08:58.325 --> 00:09:04.047]  That maybe he might have heard, but he's not sure if, but that we worship Von Brun.
[00:09:04.047 --> 00:09:07.788]  And then now Oberman's saying Ron Paul and trying to connect him in with it.
[00:09:07.788 --> 00:09:13.930]  It's really getting shameful.
[00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.231]  But the system is panicking.
[00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:27.735]  And we're talking to Ron Paul's office right now to find out when they plan to try to bring this to the floor, what we can do in citizen lobbying to draw attention to this, to engage in our First Amendment right.
[00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:32.417]  And what dirty tricks the system may play to try to block this.
[00:09:32.417 --> 00:09:40.202]  But it's very interesting that right as all this is getting ready to come to a vote, Von Brun pops up, who was in federal custody for six years.
[00:09:40.202 --> 00:09:43.444]  Correction, I said five, it's six years.
[00:09:43.444 --> 00:09:49.929]  For running in with fake dynamite and a gun and then being disarmed at a Federal Reserve in 1981.
[00:09:49.929 --> 00:09:51.330]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.972]  This stinks to absolute high heaven.
[00:09:54.972 --> 00:09:56.313]  So we'll break that down as well.
[00:09:59.076 --> 00:10:04.002]  You know, I'll give you an update on the Infowars money bomb, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:04.002 --> 00:10:07.186]  Very, very exciting.
[00:10:07.186 --> 00:10:10.190]  Listeners had the idea and started the money bomb last year.
[00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.914]  There were many other listeners started money bombs, but
[00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:23.430]  I guess, you know, I've kind of been intimidated by the system and the media and the culture that we're not supposed to ever ask for money for support like the Founding Fathers did.
[00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:36.400]  We're supposed to just let the IRS take our money, give it to the private fellow deserved, that puts it into tax-free foundations for eugenics and propaganda and everything else, and then those foundations go out and beg for money and even supplement their attacks on us.
[00:10:37.605 --> 00:10:45.649]  What would happen if Austinites, who've had more than 30,000 acres stolen from them, the farms and ranches, they wouldn't pay them for it.
[00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:49.772]  They would say, you can't build off limits for environmental reasons.
[00:10:49.772 --> 00:10:56.535]  And five years later, when the property value had been devalued down to nothing, the city would say, okay, we're going to forcibly take your land by possession.
[00:10:56.535 --> 00:11:00.698]  We're going to have a 15,000 acre park here and a 2,000 acre park there.
[00:11:02.438 --> 00:11:12.481]  And then no sooner have they grabbed them that they then take the restrictions off and build lavish homes on them, and literally hand it over to their own contractors.
[00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:17.042]  And Kirk Watson, the mayor, started his own bank, now is a state senator, that they run the land through.
[00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:21.963]  I mean, just open, job-of-the-hut level corruption right in front of everybody.
[00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:26.145]  And he just sits there laughing, literally, with SWAT teams surrounding him saying, I rule.
[00:11:26.145 --> 00:11:30.486]  LCRAs grabbing land everywhere, surveilling everybody, surveillance systems everywhere.
[00:11:31.226 --> 00:11:38.449]  Private SWAT teams, private group, total corruption, ruling everything, buying up all the water supplies, jacking up prices.
[00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:40.591]  I mean, that's just where I live.
[00:11:40.591 --> 00:11:42.471]  But, oh no!
[00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:44.352]  We're not supposed to support Ron Paul.
[00:11:44.352 --> 00:11:46.473]  We're not supposed to support good congressmen and women.
[00:11:46.473 --> 00:11:51.176]  We're not supposed to support anti-new order candidates for mayor or county commissioner.
[00:11:51.176 --> 00:11:57.459]  We're supposed to just let the environmentalist fakes go around knocking on doors, intimidating housewives and soccer moms, mainly.
[00:11:58.499 --> 00:12:02.862]  I remember back when I was in high school as a senior here in Austin, knock, knock, knock every other day.
[00:12:02.862 --> 00:12:04.082]  She'd given them money a few times.
[00:12:04.082 --> 00:12:07.525]  My dear mother, they'd say, come on, it's for the earth.
[00:12:07.525 --> 00:12:09.005]  Give money to save our springs.
[00:12:09.005 --> 00:12:10.746]  They're going to build all over it.
[00:12:10.746 --> 00:12:12.107]  Come on, give us money.
[00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:12.948]  Give us money.
[00:12:12.948 --> 00:12:14.389]  Give us money.
[00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:15.910]  Then it all goes right back to the bankers.
[00:12:17.014 --> 00:12:19.976]  But see, we're not supposed to raise money to counter the new world order.
[00:12:19.976 --> 00:12:21.697]  We're not even supposed to sell books or videos.
[00:12:21.697 --> 00:12:25.800]  While the national media says I'm not even supposed to make films and give them away for free!
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.122]  That's profiteering!
[00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.202]  It's a mind game.
[00:12:29.202 --> 00:12:30.984]  It's an intimidation.
[00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:36.367]  So I've decided to routinely ask people for support because we can do so much more.
[00:12:36.367 --> 00:12:38.049]  And I don't care what the media says or does.
[00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:42.692]  It's a mind game and I'm breaking that paradigm as well and I suggest you break it.
[00:12:46.909 --> 00:12:51.752]  We shall all stand together, or we shall certainly all hang separate.
[00:12:51.752 --> 00:12:58.876]  A variant of Benjamin Franklin's, we shall all hang together, or certainly hang separate.
[00:12:58.876 --> 00:12:59.857]  It's very, very simple.
[00:12:59.857 --> 00:13:14.105]  But, you know, they criticized Thomas Jefferson, and they criticized John Adams and many others for going to Europe and literally going around selling flags and their signatures and having to go to hundreds of little parties with rich French
[00:13:15.805 --> 00:13:20.212]  Nouveau-Riche to raise money to buy lead.
[00:13:20.212 --> 00:13:22.496]  But that's how it's done, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:22.496 --> 00:13:25.281]  So I encourage you all to buy the books, buy the videos you have been.
[00:13:25.281 --> 00:13:26.863]  I want to thank you.
[00:13:26.863 --> 00:13:27.684]  That's been part of the 2000...
[00:13:30.247 --> 00:13:41.910]  Yeah, I'm going to try to only do this once a year, but as the economy implodes and things fall apart and we try to not just sustain what we're doing, but expand it, I may come back to you from time to time.
[00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:47.231]  Because as a rule, I will not be bludgeoned or bullied into not doing something.
[00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:48.651]  Especially when I know it's right.
[00:13:48.651 --> 00:13:51.012]  But again, I want to commend all of you out there.
[00:13:51.012 --> 00:13:51.952]  We have raised
[00:13:53.581 --> 00:14:05.908]  The accounting lady was here until one in the morning, and she's going to come in at noon, so we don't have the latest numbers, but as of the middle of the night last night, we had raised $220,000.
[00:14:05.908 --> 00:14:10.350]  A little bit more than that.
[00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.272]  And more is coming in, but we've got to tabulate that when she comes in later in the show today.
[00:14:14.272 --> 00:14:20.976]  I've got a sneaking suspicion that by the end of this transmission, we're going to hit the goal of $250,000.
[00:14:20.976 --> 00:14:21.856]  Why is that the goal?
[00:14:21.856 --> 00:14:22.917]  Well, that's what we did last year.
[00:14:24.212 --> 00:14:30.938]  In about three days after, we had the money bomb, it was like $200,000, and then trickling in was another $49,000 or so the next three or four days.
[00:14:30.938 --> 00:14:39.446]  And we'll leave the money bomb up throughout the weekend for folks that may have forgotten about it or were thinking about it, they wanted to donate.
[00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:46.273]  But you know, my wife this morning said, honey, just don't tell any old ladies on Social Security to give because, you know, we can just
[00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:54.902]  Get more advertisers, or we can go without here, if that's what it takes.
[00:14:54.902 --> 00:14:57.363]  I can buy the kids less clothes every year.
[00:14:57.363 --> 00:15:11.129]  Literally, I'm having this conversation this morning with my wife in the parking lot of the house, in the driveway, and I said, don't you understand when an old lady gives $10 that who doesn't have it, it's the value that they gave.
[00:15:11.129 --> 00:15:13.170]  That's what matters in and of itself.
[00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.711]  That's part of the equation.
[00:15:14.711 --> 00:15:15.611]  They're giving spirit.
[00:15:16.738 --> 00:15:18.098]  Their love of liberty and freedom.
[00:15:18.098 --> 00:15:20.579]  Their commitment.
[00:15:20.579 --> 00:15:25.120]  The opposite of this demonic culture of hoarding.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.501]  And then we complete the equation by doing good with it.
[00:15:28.501 --> 00:15:29.881]  By telling the truth and taking action.
[00:15:29.881 --> 00:15:31.661]  She said, I understand.
[00:15:31.661 --> 00:15:34.362]  But I would encourage people that don't have it to not give.
[00:15:34.362 --> 00:15:37.823]  I mean, as I've always said, I've returned a lot of donations before.
[00:15:37.823 --> 00:15:42.424]  When people have written a letter about how poor they are and I get some thousand dollar donation, we've sent them back.
[00:15:44.092 --> 00:15:47.255]  You know, for years and years I've never asked for donations, but we still get them.
[00:15:47.255 --> 00:15:51.199]  And it's really made so much of what we've done here possible.
[00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:53.221]  And you know, it was my spirit of giving.
[00:15:53.221 --> 00:15:56.604]  I just wanted people to know the truth about the New World Order.
[00:15:56.604 --> 00:16:05.172]  And I knew that the Founding Fathers had put out little pamphlets they encouraged everybody to copy that weren't copyright.
[00:16:05.172 --> 00:16:06.794]  They were called open letters to the public.
[00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:18.658]  And that a lot of wealthy people in middle class would, and even church groups, would get together and finance buying two or three little printing presses that still cost a lot of money back then.
[00:16:18.658 --> 00:16:31.751]  And then they would raise money and women would go out and sell produce and knit socks and sweaters and sell those to try to
[00:16:33.979 --> 00:16:43.831]  Raised money so they could buy paper for the printing presses for a decade plus, more like 15 years, with the Sons of Liberty building up to 1775-1776.
[00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:57.435]  And so I read about that, and what I talked about with Lou Rockwell yesterday, about some of the other revolutions in the last 30-40 years using cassette tapes and things like that, passing it forward.
[00:16:57.435 --> 00:17:01.619]  I said, look, here's my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:17:01.619 --> 00:17:04.242]  I said, just buy the VHS tape and make copies.
[00:17:04.242 --> 00:17:07.605]  And I even said, sell it if you want to make money to make more copies.
[00:17:07.605 --> 00:17:09.547]  I mean, I was just, get this out.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.021]  And other people who'd made a few films were like, don't make copies, don't even show it to a group, you gotta get them only from us.
[00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:21.562]  And I would talk to those filmmakers and say, don't you understand we have no future if we don't get this word out?
[00:17:21.562 --> 00:17:24.903]  Plus, you know, it's just important that it be seen.
[00:17:24.903 --> 00:17:27.704]  I just wanted to interface with fellow humans.
[00:17:27.704 --> 00:17:35.325]  I just wanted to get the word out and warn people that Oklahoma City was an inside job by the Clintonistas.
[00:17:35.325 --> 00:17:37.126]  And Eric Holder, by the way, helped cover it up.
[00:17:37.126 --> 00:17:38.966]  That's in declassified FBI documents.
[00:17:41.459 --> 00:17:47.163]  When he was Deputy Attorney General.
[00:17:47.163 --> 00:17:48.363]  And I wanted to show the U.N.
[00:17:48.363 --> 00:17:50.565]  taking over our national parks, people's farms and ranches.
[00:17:50.565 --> 00:17:53.967]  And people were denying it, and I had the bills and the documents and the executive orders.
[00:17:53.967 --> 00:17:57.389]  So I went to the parks and politely asked about the U.N.
[00:17:57.389 --> 00:17:59.910]  They would threaten to arrest me.
[00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.451]  And there was a lot more in that film.
[00:18:01.451 --> 00:18:03.553]  And I got arrested thumb scanning, refusing to thumb scan.
[00:18:05.031 --> 00:18:11.437]  And that went mega viral and was one of the first videos viral on the file sharing networks and on the internet.
[00:18:11.437 --> 00:18:12.417]  And we pioneered that.
[00:18:12.417 --> 00:18:26.129]  And because of the giving spirit, the spirit of wanting to just interface with my fellow man and woman, wanting to warn people, wanting to alert people, that's actually what built us and made us what we are today.
[00:18:26.129 --> 00:18:32.155]  So by not wanting to be number one, by not wanting to be successful financially, we were.
[00:18:34.468 --> 00:18:44.677]  And then later I learned, wow, that was really something the mainstream media just now is figuring out to give their stuff out for free and try to just be mega viral and dominate the marketplace of ideas.
[00:18:44.677 --> 00:18:49.282]  Well, we've already got the jump on them and we taught a whole generation of young people how to do that.
[00:18:50.316 --> 00:18:53.177]  Look at what we are changing, 9-11 Truth, and many others are doing.
[00:18:53.177 --> 00:18:59.699]  The guerrilla journalism, the confronting the politicians, the taking over the press conferences peacefully with just asking serious questions.
[00:18:59.699 --> 00:19:14.282]  It's got the establishment scared, and that's why they've declared war on us in the media, saying we're violent, saying we're dangerous, saying we're going to stage terror attacks, saying we're really white supremacists, saying we work for Al-Qaeda, and now, magically, the events years later are happening.
[00:19:14.282 --> 00:19:15.523]  They do the preparatory phase,
[00:19:16.443 --> 00:19:17.403]  And then they attack.
[00:19:17.403 --> 00:19:21.604]  Just like I saw them prep everybody for staging 9-11, then they staged it.
[00:19:21.604 --> 00:19:22.604]  That's how I knew they were going to do it.
[00:19:22.604 --> 00:19:24.584]  I saw the prepping.
[00:19:24.584 --> 00:19:25.805]  They're prepping.
[00:19:25.805 --> 00:19:27.145]  Well, now they're gone past prepping.
[00:19:27.145 --> 00:19:31.726]  They're launching the first salvos, the first probes to test their propaganda.
[00:19:31.726 --> 00:19:37.187]  And if they judge that this has been successful, they're going to launch massive terror attacks and blame it on us.
[00:19:37.187 --> 00:19:38.927]  So stand by for impact.
[00:19:38.927 --> 00:19:40.447]  Stand by for bombardment.
[00:19:40.447 --> 00:19:42.728]  This is hardcore Rio, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:42.728 --> 00:19:44.648]  So I want to thank everybody at the, uh,
[00:19:45.308 --> 00:19:46.969]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:19:46.969 --> 00:19:49.850]  You can link through InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:50.350]  Keep giving.
[00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.551]  Let's hit 250,000 by the end of the show today.
[00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:54.552]  It's really going to help us in this info war.
[00:19:54.552 --> 00:19:57.054]  I want to thank all of you for being part of the second 1776.
[00:19:57.054 --> 00:19:59.235]  News straight ahead.
[00:19:59.235 --> 00:20:03.216]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources.
[00:20:03.216 --> 00:20:03.737]  800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:20:03.737 --> 00:20:04.977]  And let's take in a brief mind movie.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:15.146]  We're surrounded by jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[00:20:15.146 --> 00:20:20.973]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[00:20:20.973 --> 00:20:22.975]  The stimulus package is working.
[00:20:22.975 --> 00:20:24.857]  A bailout is coming your way.
[00:20:24.857 --> 00:20:29.061]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:29.382]  Pardon me?
[00:20:30.191 --> 00:20:31.431]  Back to the real world.
[00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:35.712]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[00:20:35.712 --> 00:20:38.273]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[00:20:38.273 --> 00:20:39.953]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[00:20:39.953 --> 00:20:51.435]  Please call me, John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, to discuss investing in precious metals, gold and silver, with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.
[00:20:51.435 --> 00:20:58.417]  I'm John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and together we'll create a package that really works for you.
[00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:06.652]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:06.652 --> 00:21:13.625]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:14.241 --> 00:21:20.824]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:20.824 --> 00:21:22.785]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:25.286]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:25.286 --> 00:21:36.251]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:36.872 --> 00:21:38.534]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.534 --> 00:21:40.396]  It's about a one world government.
[00:21:40.396 --> 00:21:47.303]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:21:47.303 --> 00:21:55.572]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:55.572 --> 00:21:57.153]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.153 --> 00:21:58.335]  The people strike back.
[00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.671]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[00:22:03.671 --> 00:22:08.112]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:22:08.112 --> 00:22:10.612]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:22:10.612 --> 00:22:16.873]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:22:16.873 --> 00:22:23.235]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[00:22:24.455 --> 00:22:26.717]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[00:23:00.154 --> 00:23:02.516]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[00:23:02.516 --> 00:23:12.024]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[00:23:12.024 --> 00:23:20.031]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:25.975]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[00:23:26.596 --> 00:23:29.418]  506-5904.
[00:23:29.418 --> 00:23:34.460]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:39.343]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[00:23:39.343 --> 00:23:48.428]  American Tax Settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back, and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:52.531]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800
[00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:54.413]  Federal Agents!
[00:23:54.413 --> 00:23:54.953]  We are armed!
[00:23:54.953 --> 00:23:56.155]  Get down on the ground!
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.641]  We're good to go.
[00:24:44.002 --> 00:25:10.577]  I see a message from the government like every day I watch it and listen and call them all suckers They're warning me about Osama or whatever picture me behind this scam I said never You in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting I stay committed give up because I lose commission It's all a part of fighting devil state mind control And all about the battle for your body mind and soul And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shape you Don't forget they made us slaves gave us AIDS and raped us
[00:25:10.797 --> 00:25:12.158]  We are back live, okay.
[00:25:12.158 --> 00:25:14.620]  Look, I told you back during the whole swine flu scare,
[00:25:38.775 --> 00:25:51.065]  And I posted the internal State of Texas Health Department memorandum that I got from a school administrator I know and had the numbers to the doctors and people still called me and said, where's the document?
[00:25:51.065 --> 00:25:53.888]  I'm like, there it is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:53.888 --> 00:25:55.249]  We were at level four at the time.
[00:25:55.249 --> 00:25:58.031]  This was a few days into it, about a week into it.
[00:25:58.031 --> 00:25:59.873]  The document said we're really at level five.
[00:25:59.873 --> 00:26:02.795]  They're going to announce that in the next three days.
[00:26:02.795 --> 00:26:04.577]  And then we're going to level six in the next week.
[00:26:05.782 --> 00:26:23.568]  Then I got some other phone calls, called some other people I know, and confirmed that the UN was already telling governments through the World Health Organization that they were in control of the planet and all governments that are signatories to World Health Organization rules and pandemic treaties.
[00:26:23.568 --> 00:26:27.650]  Now it's in hundreds and hundreds of newspapers.
[00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.610]  AP, Reuters,
[00:26:30.037 --> 00:26:32.118]  News of Australia, everywhere.
[00:26:32.118 --> 00:26:43.824]  That, oh yes, we're all under level 6, the World Health Organization is running it, countries, the United States, Mexico, Australia, Europe, China, they're all following World Health Organization orders.
[00:26:43.824 --> 00:26:50.567]  So, the UN, through this test, as the SPP documents say, that are in the film, Endgame,
[00:26:51.786 --> 00:27:03.619]  They say we'll use pandemics, biological threats, terror attacks, environmental problems, greenhouse gases, and economic collapse to bring in our North American Union and globalization.
[00:27:03.619 --> 00:27:08.625]  And we'll use that to merge the European Union with the Transatlantic Treaty.
[00:27:08.625 --> 00:27:11.188]  I mean, they say they've merged the EU and the European Union.
[00:27:11.188 --> 00:27:12.409]  It's all merged!
[00:27:13.339 --> 00:27:24.188]  Just like in England, they haven't passed the treaty to sign on to Lisbon, but the BBC admits, Google headline, UK already under EU control.
[00:27:24.188 --> 00:27:27.030]  And you'll see hundreds of articles telling the people, yes.
[00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:35.016]  Remember when Jackie Smith, the now-resigned, disgraced Gestapo agent over there, who's surveilling everybody and banning free speech?
[00:27:35.016 --> 00:27:37.678]  She went up to Savage and said he was banned from coming to England.
[00:27:37.678 --> 00:27:40.801]  If you read the fine print, she said, I'm following EU rules.
[00:27:46.408 --> 00:27:52.154]  So, yes, ladies and gentlemen, they're testing the swine flu vaccines they already had ready.
[00:27:52.154 --> 00:27:55.138]  Like Horowitz talked about it, or Horowitz on this show, he was right.
[00:27:55.138 --> 00:27:57.921]  As usual, I found it hard to believe, but he was right again.
[00:27:57.921 --> 00:28:03.927]  Just like he fingered exactly who was behind the anthrax attack, so the FBI came and harassed him.
[00:28:03.927 --> 00:28:05.349]  Well, he was right again.
[00:28:09.309 --> 00:28:11.590]  He's got some interesting religious ideas, I'll tell you that.
[00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:20.134]  But separate from that, he is a Harvard graduate doctor and he certainly was right!
[00:28:20.134 --> 00:28:27.858]  And, uh... They certainly are saying, first swine flu vaccine ready for testing.
[00:28:27.858 --> 00:28:28.719]  Swiss drug giant.
[00:28:30.714 --> 00:28:38.577]  Norvadis has completed a first batch of swine flu vaccine for preclinical trials and aims to make a version available for September.
[00:28:38.577 --> 00:28:42.919]  The company said, yeah, I suppose it takes six months to make these, but they have it in two, of course.
[00:28:42.919 --> 00:28:43.939]  And it goes on.
[00:28:43.939 --> 00:28:48.201]  But AP reports, we for several days have been under level six.
[00:28:48.201 --> 00:28:56.184]  And when you read deeper into all these articles, they admit, oh, really from the start, they had already implemented level six type preparations.
[00:28:56.184 --> 00:28:59.025]  And so at an executive level, level six is in place.
[00:28:59.025 --> 00:28:59.906]  That's why we went under U.N.
[00:28:59.906 --> 00:29:00.246]  control.
[00:29:04.104 --> 00:29:13.351]  So they're just getting the towns, the cities, the states, the nation states ready to go into quarantine, forced injections, and that's being announced on CNN and Fox.
[00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:17.134]  No, we may have to have quarantines and forced injections.
[00:29:17.134 --> 00:29:24.080]  Oh, we're pretty sure this fall that we're going to have a massive outbreak and people are going to die in mass.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:31.626]  Probably another hoax, but getting you ready as they beta test for the real biological attacks they'll launch in the future being eugenicists.
[00:29:33.848 --> 00:29:37.612]  By the way, I've got this article here, fired because of Endgame, my film.
[00:29:37.612 --> 00:29:39.333]  This isn't the first time I've seen things like this.
[00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:40.755]  We'll break that down when we get back.
[00:29:40.755 --> 00:29:43.657]  Get into some chemtrail news and a lot more on the economy.
[00:29:43.657 --> 00:29:44.258]  Stay with us.
[00:29:44.258 --> 00:29:45.039]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:29:52.146 --> 00:29:54.688]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.688 --> 00:29:57.391]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:00.842 --> 00:31:06.865]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:12.747]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:12.747 --> 00:31:18.910]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.211]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.211 --> 00:31:23.673]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:23.673 --> 00:31:36.862]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:38.543]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.543 --> 00:31:40.405]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.405 --> 00:31:46.629]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:31:55.571 --> 00:31:57.154]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.154 --> 00:31:58.336]  The people strike back!
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.721]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:32:01.721 --> 00:32:03.463]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:06.145]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:32:06.145 --> 00:32:11.289]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:32:11.289 --> 00:32:14.472]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:32:14.472 --> 00:32:17.995]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[00:32:30.943 --> 00:32:32.945]  Finally, drinking water that you control.

[00:32:34.667 --> 00:32:37.130]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.110]  We're good to go.
[00:33:18.156 --> 00:33:19.200]  We're good.
[00:33:40.253 --> 00:33:45.374]  Thank you so much for joining us today on this Friday the 12th.
[00:33:45.374 --> 00:33:49.275]  12th day of June 2009.
[00:33:49.275 --> 00:33:54.336]  The year is basically officially half a lapse.
[00:33:54.336 --> 00:33:55.736]  We're halfway in.
[00:33:55.736 --> 00:33:58.116]  We're in a couple days to 2009.
[00:33:58.116 --> 00:34:01.537]  As soon as these years start, it seems like they're over.
[00:34:01.537 --> 00:34:03.897]  It's like our lives are over in the twinkling of an eye.
[00:34:03.897 --> 00:34:06.378]  What matters is our species should go on forever.
[00:34:07.868 --> 00:34:12.372]  And we should build and honor creativity and decency and beauty.
[00:34:12.372 --> 00:34:13.973]  You want to know what good is?
[00:34:13.973 --> 00:34:17.236]  It's sweet little children playing in a sandbox.
[00:34:17.236 --> 00:34:20.358]  It's happy little birds building a nest above your doorway.
[00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:25.543]  It's beautiful forest and happiness and people making sacrifices for others.
[00:34:25.543 --> 00:34:26.764]  It's truthfulness.
[00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:27.745]  It's decency.
[00:34:27.745 --> 00:34:29.666]  It's self-control.
[00:34:29.666 --> 00:34:33.389]  Want to know what evil is?
[00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:36.111]  It's smart bombs being dropped on civilian populations.
[00:34:37.788 --> 00:34:39.529]  Bondage.
[00:34:39.529 --> 00:34:41.409]  It's surveillance.
[00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:42.050]  It's control.
[00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:46.371]  Okay, let me just launch N2 News right now.
[00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:49.852]  This is important because it's a First Amendment issue, and I've seen countless things like this.
[00:34:49.852 --> 00:34:53.694]  I always mention a famous case because it was in the newspapers.
[00:34:53.694 --> 00:34:58.355]  It's hard for folks to believe this stuff until they see it in the newspaper, but Kelly Rushing, Lyon County, Kentucky.
[00:34:58.355 --> 00:34:59.796]  Lyon County, Kentucky.
[00:34:59.796 --> 00:35:00.736]  No criminal record.
[00:35:00.736 --> 00:35:02.937]  Family goes back to the founding of the county, literally.
[00:35:04.324 --> 00:35:14.554]  Owns a business in town, he gave a state police officer a video with Ron Paul at the front of it, and my film Road to Tyranny on the end of it.
[00:35:14.554 --> 00:35:26.867]  I guess on ultra slow play or whatever, but he put like five hours on there of Ron Paul speeches, and they charged him for the Ron Paul speech and for Endgame, and it was in the newspaper, not Endgame, Road to Tyranny.
[00:35:26.867 --> 00:35:27.948]  And it was in the news!
[00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:42.747]  That he was charged and police believe that a speech on the House of Representatives is illegal, and that my film is illegal, and that it was threatening to police and anti-law enforcement, as they said in the trial.
[00:35:42.747 --> 00:35:47.754]  The jury found him not guilty of two counts of terroristic threats, that the film was a threat to police.
[00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:52.009]  And I've seen countless people fired.
[00:35:52.009 --> 00:35:57.713]  You're allowed to visit at lunch, websites, Dell computers, at least you were years ago when I saw all these cases.
[00:35:57.713 --> 00:36:00.415]  But if you visit InfoWars.com, they don't block it out.
[00:36:00.415 --> 00:36:01.876]  They want to know if you're visiting.
[00:36:01.876 --> 00:36:02.877]  You're instantly fired.
[00:36:05.737 --> 00:36:14.920]  And we had people on that this happened to, and they would say, oh yes, you're not allowed to visit hate sites, gambling sites, hacking sites, and porn sites.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.882]  And my site was listed as hacking and hate.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:48.735]  And a lot of libraries and government systems block us out, a lot of military systems, not all of them though, blockinfowars.com, prisonplanet.com, a lot of them don't have jonesreport.com or truthnews.us or prisonplanet.tv or some of the other auxiliary backup sites listed, that's why we have those, one of the reasons, or whatistheendgame.com or martiallaw911.info, we're always launching more as their sentinels try to blast us in the matrix and stop us from getting the signal out.
[00:36:49.721 --> 00:36:57.303]  But you can't stop the signal, Mel, as they say in Serenity.
[00:36:57.303 --> 00:37:02.885]  But, um, fired because of in-game.
[00:37:02.885 --> 00:37:07.887]  This is Amy, I believe, Rabban, and Lisa.
[00:37:08.948 --> 00:37:09.448]  Livgren?
[00:37:09.448 --> 00:37:11.229]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:25.798]  Bill of Rights Amendment 1 of the Constitution states, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or the press, or the right of the people to peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievance.
[00:37:25.798 --> 00:37:34.463]  The First Amendment was not meant to cover only polite speech, but more so, disagreeable speech, or threatening speech, or scary speech.
[00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:40.255]  Well, I would add, lately in this country it has been hard to freely voice one's opinions.
[00:37:40.255 --> 00:37:45.797]  You have to look in dark corners where the media has shunned in order to find a voice that speaks the truth.
[00:37:45.797 --> 00:37:55.920]  It seems that the moment you say or think a word, you get added to a list, or censored immediately, or put in a free speech zone, which now is five miles away from the event.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.902]  Two weeks ago, we worked as custodians at a pharmaceutical distribution company.
[00:38:00.902 --> 00:38:04.703]  Well, yeah, probably a eugenics block-off, that's why.
[00:38:05.575 --> 00:38:11.021]  There was no dress code and we worked after hours when there were little to no people around.
[00:38:11.021 --> 00:38:17.187]  We were constantly told what a fantastic job we were doing until the day of the t-shirt incident.
[00:38:17.187 --> 00:38:25.636]  I told you I wore our Minuteman t-shirt that just says live free or die into a grocery store at like 9 30 at night in a small town a few weeks ago and I had
[00:38:27.059 --> 00:38:39.005]  The security guard, while I was sitting there looking at paper and pens, he walked up, acted like he was shopping, and then he looked at me and then walked right up like I wasn't human and looked at my shirt, because I was still facing the products.
[00:38:39.005 --> 00:38:41.846]  And then he looked at the front, looked at the back, and kind of watched me.
[00:38:41.846 --> 00:38:45.288]  This is the way America operates.
[00:38:45.288 --> 00:38:46.969]  You don't have a minute man on your shirt.
[00:38:46.969 --> 00:38:51.071]  That's like having Osama Bin Laden on your shirt.
[00:38:51.071 --> 00:38:52.631]  We wore an Endgame t-shirt to work.
[00:38:52.631 --> 00:38:53.372]  I guess they made one.
[00:38:54.514 --> 00:39:07.542]  There was absolutely nothing offensive about the t-shirt, yet we had offered a couple of fuzzy, Birkenstock-wearing women who had pictures of Obama and family plastered all over their desk.
[00:39:07.542 --> 00:39:11.044]  They had offended a couple of fuzzy, Birkenstock-wearing women.
[00:39:11.044 --> 00:39:18.508]  Yeah, they would love to throw you probably in a pit, and they thought it would shoot you in the back of the head, or they thought it would bring in their lovely world government and they'd get some free goodies.
[00:39:18.508 --> 00:39:23.491]  Oh, Obama, I don't have to pay my rent anymore, pay for my car payment, everything's fixed!
[00:39:24.343 --> 00:39:28.206]  But then it'll be, oh, the people are holding back Obama.
[00:39:28.206 --> 00:39:37.812]  We've got to get rid of the people that are in the way of our great leader, our dear leader, the great leader, the special leader, and then he'll be able to fix it.
[00:39:37.812 --> 00:39:40.194]  The front of the shirt said, End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:39:40.194 --> 00:39:44.037]  The back of the shirt had a quote from the documentary that said, We Are Not Your Slaves.
[00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:49.092]  We were fired for wearing, yeah, we're not your slaves.
[00:39:49.092 --> 00:39:50.133]  Well, you don't wear that.
[00:39:50.133 --> 00:39:51.174]  We're not your slaves.
[00:39:51.174 --> 00:39:51.835]  Woo!
[00:39:51.835 --> 00:39:52.876]  Woo!
[00:39:52.876 --> 00:39:55.379]  That'll really get a slave master mad.
[00:39:55.379 --> 00:40:00.443]  We were fired for wearing our opinion on a t-shirt.
[00:40:00.443 --> 00:40:05.228]  Before the t-shirt incident, we knew freedom of speech had already started to diminish.
[00:40:05.228 --> 00:40:08.211]  We now know for sure that it is nearly a thing of the past.
[00:40:08.211 --> 00:40:08.812]  We continued
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.641]  The fight for free speech and truth.
[00:40:11.641 --> 00:40:16.886]  We also continue to wear our in-game t-shirts to show our support for this documentary.
[00:40:16.886 --> 00:40:25.394]  We may not have lived in the days of our founding fathers, but we know that this country is not what it used to be.
[00:40:25.394 --> 00:40:29.377]  To end it all, here is a quote from Benjamin Franklin.
[00:40:29.377 --> 00:40:36.143]  Outside of Independence Hall, when the Constitutional Convention of 1787 ended, Mr. Powell of Philadelphia asked Benjamin Franklin,
[00:40:39.417 --> 00:40:40.418]  What have we got?
[00:40:40.418 --> 00:40:42.339]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:49.664]  With no hesitation whatsoever, Franklin responded, a republic, if you can keep it.
[00:40:49.664 --> 00:40:55.207]  And some will argue, well, you know, this is a company, they're allowed to fire and hire who they want, and they are.
[00:40:55.207 --> 00:41:04.413]  But see, you can wear an Obama shirt, you can wear a George W. Bush or McCain shirt, you can wear a NASCAR shirt, you can wear a Walmart shirt, you can wear probably a Playboy Bunny shirt.
[00:41:07.042 --> 00:41:13.089]  But you don't wear a shirt saying, we're not your slaves, end game.
[00:41:13.089 --> 00:41:22.719]  Those people who tattled on you went and looked that up and they went, um, like a first grader tattling, and they ran and they said, listen,
[00:41:25.347 --> 00:41:35.636]  Listen, they're wearing these shirts, and the security guards pulled up tape, looked it up, and said, and they went and told executives, and they said, we've got Alex Jones people in the building.
[00:41:35.636 --> 00:41:36.176]  Fire them!
[00:41:36.176 --> 00:41:37.998]  Security breach!
[00:41:37.998 --> 00:41:40.920]  You work for a pharmaceutical facility!
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.841]  Of course!
[00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:43.102]  Endgame exposes them!
[00:41:46.624 --> 00:42:09.992]  I commend you and I salute you, but you know, I think it's better to use the enemy's money, work in their complexes, surveil them for any criminal activity to report out to the outside, and then on the weekend, or when you go to the store, wear the Endgame shirts, and pass out cards with Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, Infowars.com on them, or the radio show, or the podcast, or whatever you'd like.
[00:42:09.992 --> 00:42:11.293]  Put a lot of stuff on a little business card.
[00:42:16.198 --> 00:42:19.940]  And then compartmentalize what you're doing.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.582]  I would say protect your jobs.
[00:42:24.582 --> 00:42:27.183]  Use the enemy's money against them.
[00:42:27.183 --> 00:42:34.386]  And then use the money you're making from that to separately fight the enemy outside that sector of the matrix.
[00:42:34.386 --> 00:42:36.567]  But you can do what you want.
[00:42:36.567 --> 00:42:37.868]  But I commend you and I salute you.
[00:42:39.915 --> 00:42:46.076]  Speaking of drug makers, you know, I mentioned this a month ago, and then last night, Jason Burma brought it back up to my attention.
[00:42:46.076 --> 00:42:49.977]  April 1st, 2009, Vioxx maker Merck & Co.
[00:42:49.977 --> 00:43:01.159]  drew up a doctor hit list, and this was in the news.co.au, big news over in Australia, but it was also in the AP over here, and it says, a hit list, U.S.
[00:43:01.159 --> 00:43:02.299]  drug maker Merck & Co.
[00:43:02.299 --> 00:43:06.520]  is accused of targeting critical researchers, file companies accused of targeting critics.
[00:43:08.632 --> 00:43:13.495]  An internal drug company made a hit list of doctors who had to be neutralized.
[00:43:13.495 --> 00:43:15.656]  That means killed.
[00:43:15.656 --> 00:43:19.879]  Just like the Pentagon, they found documents saying neutralize reporters in the U.S.
[00:43:19.879 --> 00:43:20.419]  and outside.
[00:43:20.419 --> 00:43:24.982]  People said, oh, they don't mean kill, and now they're coming out going, no, we mean we're going to kill you!
[00:43:24.982 --> 00:43:29.785]  We're going to send a hit squad by and we're going to shoot you in your front yard and let all your neighbors know.
[00:43:29.785 --> 00:43:32.687]  We're going to kill newspaper reporters in America because that's freedom.
[00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.190]  I mean, these are open criminals.
[00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:45.014]  If they're going to kill a million plus Iraqis, and they're going to use DU all over the planet, including in the U.S., that kills themselves, they certainly don't care about you.
[00:43:45.014 --> 00:43:47.475]  These are mind-controlled zombies.
[00:43:47.475 --> 00:43:51.937]  Not your average military people, but the zombies they send to kill you.
[00:43:51.937 --> 00:43:56.139]  The only reason they're not killing us, ladies and gentlemen, is they know there's too many of us.
[00:43:56.139 --> 00:43:58.440]  They don't want to highlight everything we've done, everything we've said.
[00:44:01.297 --> 00:44:04.578]  And also, because they know we're peaceful.
[00:44:04.578 --> 00:44:08.339]  We Are Change and 9-11 Truth and other liberty groups sprouting up everywhere.
[00:44:08.339 --> 00:44:11.920]  Every time Bernanke goes somewhere, they say, hey, why'd you go to Bilderberg?
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.520]  Where's the money?
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.200]  Why is it secret?
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:13.980]  Why haven't you been audited?
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.281]  And then the media picks up on it.
[00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:19.522]  Great work at We Are Change, Illinois.
[00:44:19.522 --> 00:44:21.262]  I just want to salute the folks that called in yesterday.
[00:44:21.262 --> 00:44:23.263]  I got to get them on as guests soon.
[00:44:23.263 --> 00:44:24.183]  Just amazing people.
[00:44:30.026 --> 00:44:30.987]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:44:30.987 --> 00:44:38.916]  But you see, Bernanke looked focused, looked serious, but also looked scared, but also looked aggressive.
[00:44:38.916 --> 00:44:41.819]  And when he looked at him, he looked at him like, man, you know who I am.
[00:44:41.819 --> 00:44:44.222]  You know that we murder whole third world countries.
[00:44:45.526 --> 00:44:47.727]  But you can see the thought process in his eyes.
[00:44:47.727 --> 00:44:48.628]  It's powerful video.
[00:44:48.628 --> 00:44:50.049]  They say a picture tells a thousand words.
[00:44:50.049 --> 00:44:58.253]  Well, these 15-20 seconds with that camera right in his face, he's sitting there thinking, if I have these people struck down or imprisoned, it's just going to make them martyrs.
[00:44:58.253 --> 00:45:03.056]  And then people will start getting aggressive, and they'll take the gloves off physically with me.
[00:45:03.056 --> 00:45:09.100]  And he's realizing the tide's turned, and even if they strike at us violently, that only brings it into a realm they don't want to enter.
[00:45:10.128 --> 00:45:13.670]  And now they're beginning to instinctively realize we're committed no matter what happens.
[00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:24.217]  We're throwing ourselves into the works of the enemy juggernaut and we are a juggernaut that is more powerful and filled with truth and light and love.
[00:45:24.217 --> 00:45:26.158]  And they're scared.
[00:45:26.158 --> 00:45:34.304]  The arrogance, the smiling, demonic enjoyment has left almost all their faces except for Glenn Beck.
[00:45:34.304 --> 00:45:36.065]  Gosh, man, where do they find these creatures?
[00:45:37.435 --> 00:45:41.497]  But Bernanke and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, they're not having fun now.
[00:45:41.497 --> 00:45:42.638]  They're trying to survive now.
[00:45:42.638 --> 00:45:46.940]  They're trying to keep control of what they got now.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.502]  And it's because we're committed unto death.
[00:45:50.502 --> 00:45:54.564]  That's something that's hard to deal with.
[00:45:54.564 --> 00:46:02.949]  And ladies and gentlemen, I will say this, only because I don't want it to hurt the work we've been doing that I'm going to get into more news.
[00:46:02.949 --> 00:46:05.190]  I am getting a lot of death threats.
[00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:06.471]  My family's being attacked.
[00:46:07.675 --> 00:46:10.616]  Distant family relations are being attacked.
[00:46:10.616 --> 00:46:12.497]  It's certainly a PSYOP, no doubt about that.
[00:46:12.497 --> 00:46:13.458]  It's governmental.
[00:46:13.458 --> 00:46:14.398]  We've confirmed a lot of it is.
[00:46:14.398 --> 00:46:17.759]  And then others, it's just part of the sick society and things breaking down.
[00:46:17.759 --> 00:46:19.160]  But the attacks are really intensifying.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:25.603]  And the lies that I'm a murderer now, or that I'm a government agent, or I'm this or I'm that.
[00:46:25.603 --> 00:46:27.563]  I mean, it really gets insane.
[00:46:27.563 --> 00:46:31.225]  And I expect them to launch even more egregious and insane attacks.
[00:46:33.752 --> 00:46:35.393]  And we need your prayers.
[00:46:35.393 --> 00:46:41.936]  More importantly than even your financial support with the Infowars money bomb we've got going on for the rest of the day.
[00:46:41.936 --> 00:46:47.619]  And for you to spread the word, we've got to become even bigger and more in the spotlight and more out in the open.
[00:46:47.619 --> 00:46:53.162]  You know, that's what Mr. Garrison believed and so many others believe being prominent and being out in the open is the way to go.
[00:46:53.162 --> 00:46:57.124]  So many other people out there who've only gone partially public, like when I told the D.C.
[00:46:57.124 --> 00:47:03.187]  Madam she went public all over radio and TV for six months and I got her on and I said, you better release it all or they're going to kill you.
[00:47:04.226 --> 00:47:07.348]  And she said, well, I know they're following me and they may kill me, but I don't think they will.
[00:47:07.348 --> 00:47:07.788]  Well, they did.
[00:47:07.788 --> 00:47:14.272]  And we had her landlord on and documented how she wasn't planning to kill herself, and so they were after her.
[00:47:14.272 --> 00:47:18.895]  It's not fun trying to face that type of stuff down, or Barry Jennings didn't go completely public.
[00:47:18.895 --> 00:47:22.777]  We, though, believe he's in the Witness Protection Program now.
[00:47:22.777 --> 00:47:26.640]  But, um, and many other people have been killed by these folks.
[00:47:28.114 --> 00:47:30.716]  You need to go public, go all the way public, that's what protects you.
[00:47:30.716 --> 00:47:32.697]  But I am in the eye of the storm.
[00:47:32.697 --> 00:47:34.318]  There is no doubting that and so is Ron Paul.
[00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:49.326]  Ron Paul said here a month ago, I didn't get time to ask him two days ago on the show, Ron Paul said on this show that he knows his life's in danger.
[00:47:49.326 --> 00:47:52.028]  I can't imagine the crap he goes through, the stuff I go through.
[00:47:52.028 --> 00:47:53.229]  He's smart though he doesn't talk about it.
[00:47:54.471 --> 00:48:00.454]  That much, but it is important just to let people know out there that it's going on.
[00:48:00.454 --> 00:48:05.156]  And I just put it in God's hands.
[00:48:05.156 --> 00:48:13.179]  And I know I have a great responsibility with how many people are listening and tuning in and checking out what we're saying and that our information is going mega viral supernova exponentially.
[00:48:15.188 --> 00:48:27.957]  And I just put it in God's hands because a lot of people psychologically couldn't deal with the level of stress I'm under or the things I face every day and I just want to commend my jovial crew and all the supporters and everybody that is on the same team.
[00:48:27.957 --> 00:48:34.641]  It's just great working with you and knowing you and all of you out there that have supported us from my heart to your heart, from my soul to your soul.
[00:48:34.641 --> 00:48:37.623]  Thank you all because we've done amazing things.
[00:48:37.623 --> 00:48:40.965]  We've done incredible things and we are now the number one group being targeted.
[00:48:40.965 --> 00:48:43.127]  You know, they demonized Iraq before they attack it.
[00:48:43.127 --> 00:48:44.688]  They demonized Serbia before they attack it.
[00:48:45.615 --> 00:48:47.958]  And domestically they demonize groups who are their number one threat.
[00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:51.383]  They're attacking me and Ron Paul and others.
[00:48:51.383 --> 00:48:52.805]  Because of you.
[00:48:52.805 --> 00:49:00.235]  Because you have power and you're moving and you're taking action and we're setting bushfires in the minds of men and women everywhere and teaching them they can take action.
[00:49:00.235 --> 00:49:02.058]  And the crimes of this elite are coming out.
[00:49:06.533 --> 00:49:14.300]  An international drug company made a hit list of doctors who had to be neutralized, killed, or discredited.
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:14.961]  That's what I've said.
[00:49:14.961 --> 00:49:18.304]  I better be glad they're just trying to discredit me.
[00:49:18.304 --> 00:49:20.005]  Because that generally means they're not going to kill you.
[00:49:20.005 --> 00:49:24.029]  But sometimes they super discredit you and they think they won discrediting you, then they kill you.
[00:49:29.082 --> 00:49:43.070]  I just hope all my enemies who I know are wrong about me and have lied about me or twisted things about me, who I know are self-righteous, many of them, and aren't on government payroll, I really hope if they do kill me that you don't then attack me when I'm dead and say, oh, they got rid of their agent or something.
[00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:53.236]  Because who I am is a symbol now, whether people like it or not, a figurehead for liberty and freedom, and they want to destroy that idea and destroy who I am.
[00:49:53.236 --> 00:49:54.157]  And I now stand
[00:49:56.371 --> 00:50:03.475]  In the dark, judged by the world, pilloried, lied about, drugged through the mud, when I'm a good, decent person.
[00:50:03.475 --> 00:50:07.017]  And you have to understand, folks, when they demonize me, they're demonizing you.
[00:50:07.017 --> 00:50:12.261]  I am a symbol of everybody that loves liberty and freedom.
[00:50:12.261 --> 00:50:17.324]  And people that attack me unjustly and lie about me and twist, you're destroying yourselves.
[00:50:17.324 --> 00:50:19.545]  You're not living up to your destiny to be a leader.
[00:50:19.545 --> 00:50:22.647]  You're engaging in what the enemy wants us to do, tearing each other apart.
[00:50:24.747 --> 00:50:31.092]  I've tried to grow, I've made mistakes, I've attacked people back when they do stuff wrongly and it only adds fire to it.
[00:50:31.092 --> 00:50:37.896]  But, we have to all stand together against the new ruler and stop all this crap.
[00:50:37.896 --> 00:50:40.658]  All of us have to resist the tyranny.
[00:50:40.658 --> 00:50:41.439]  Staff at U.S.
[00:50:41.439 --> 00:50:44.141]  company Merck & Co.
[00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:47.343]  emailed each other about the list of doctors, mainly researchers and academics.
[00:50:47.343 --> 00:50:49.184]  How many of them have been murdered, see?
[00:50:49.184 --> 00:50:52.587]  Think about all the microbiologists and scientists and most of them blew the whistle on these companies.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.001]  They get murdered.
[00:50:55.001 --> 00:50:56.421]  They get shot in the front yard.
[00:50:56.421 --> 00:51:00.764]  We'll be right back.

[00:52:56.209 --> 00:53:00.231]  The Bailout Group.
[00:53:00.231 --> 00:53:06.454]  We are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[00:53:06.454 --> 00:53:07.494]  Take a deep breath.
[00:53:07.494 --> 00:53:14.757]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[00:53:14.757 --> 00:53:15.758]  Have a glass of water.
[00:53:16.298 --> 00:53:21.961]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other chemicals?
[00:53:21.961 --> 00:53:23.021]  Of course you can't.
[00:53:23.021 --> 00:53:28.164]  The air that you breathe and the water you drink should help maintain good health, not take away from it.
[00:53:28.164 --> 00:53:36.728]  Airandaqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these toxins.
[00:53:36.728 --> 00:53:42.511]  Airandaqua.com carries whole house air and water purification systems, air conditioners, showerhead filters,
[00:53:42.551 --> 00:53:42.871]  I think so.
[00:54:22.571 --> 00:54:40.806]  You know, there's so much evil that when agency, French Press, AP, BBC reported back in April, months ago, a month and a half ago, almost two months ago, early April, the emails got leaked, the Australian first reported it, Merck confirmed it.
[00:54:40.806 --> 00:54:44.009]  It's Merck that brought you Vioxx and HPV.
[00:54:44.009 --> 00:54:49.614]  See, they have to shut people down because if they don't, it'll come out it's killing the people that are taking their soft kill weapons.
[00:54:51.175 --> 00:54:51.895]  Here's the email.
[00:54:51.895 --> 00:54:56.137]  We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live, a Merck employee wrote.
[00:54:56.137 --> 00:55:00.819]  And man, I think Merck needs to be brought in for questioning, but they're above government.
[00:55:00.819 --> 00:55:01.959]  They are the real government.
[00:55:01.959 --> 00:55:09.342]  The pharmaceutical companies are next to stand on the underbelly of the banking system at the next to highest level.
[00:55:09.342 --> 00:55:12.463]  And that's why hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of microbiologists and scientists
[00:55:13.368 --> 00:55:22.776]  All over the country, they'll be in the backyard cooking hamburgers, a guy in a black uniform with a black mask pops up, double taps them with precision at 50 yards, special forces training.
[00:55:22.776 --> 00:55:28.140]  Cops pull up seconds later to cover it up.
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:36.767]  Just like the people that were in the unit with Pat Tillman, who said they killed him, they all got double tapped within days.
[00:55:36.767 --> 00:55:42.371]  The people that saw Chaney trying to steal the nukes from Minot, they all got double tapped, or strangled, or killed.
[00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:44.751]  A run over?
[00:55:44.751 --> 00:55:46.713]  Just mass murder going on everywhere.
[00:55:46.713 --> 00:55:47.594]  Hardcore.
[00:55:47.594 --> 00:55:49.415]  And it doesn't even matter when it comes out, they're doing it.
[00:55:49.415 --> 00:55:51.998]  In fact, Merck might even release this themselves.
[00:55:51.998 --> 00:55:53.038]  Yeah, okay!
[00:55:53.038 --> 00:55:54.500]  We'll kill you!
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.902]  We'll shoot your little girls up with something, kill them dead in a hammer.
[00:55:56.902 --> 00:55:57.723]  We'll sure kill you!
[00:55:58.939 --> 00:56:01.581]  And the cops, they... I'll tell you what, this country's so gone.
[00:56:01.581 --> 00:56:05.223]  Most of the local hit teams are actually the killer cop squads they've got.
[00:56:05.223 --> 00:56:07.865]  It's like that Carnaby CIA guy who they got tired of.
[00:56:07.865 --> 00:56:10.067]  They just pulled him over and killed him in Houston right in front of everybody.
[00:56:10.067 --> 00:56:10.968]  Cold blood.
[00:56:10.968 --> 00:56:11.588]  On chopper.
[00:56:11.588 --> 00:56:12.288]  On news chopper.
[00:56:12.288 --> 00:56:14.030]  They murder whoever they want.
[00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.810]  They rule.
[00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:16.071]  That's the end of it.
[00:56:16.071 --> 00:56:20.855]  Your kids are going to take the shots and they're going to die of cancer and they're going to flop over and they're going to have convulsions.
[00:56:20.855 --> 00:56:22.516]  That's just the way it is.
[00:56:22.516 --> 00:56:25.378]  If you don't like it, Merck's going to send a hit team.
[00:56:25.378 --> 00:56:26.839]  You take the shots or they come.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:34.101]  But see, I heard George Norrie with incredible courage come right out against all the drug companies last night with incredible guests.
[00:56:34.101 --> 00:56:37.742]  The director of RX Generation.
[00:56:37.742 --> 00:56:39.922]  In fact, tell Dew I want him on.
[00:56:39.922 --> 00:56:41.883]  The director of RX Generation.
[00:56:41.883 --> 00:56:45.564]  But I mean, I just heard the courage of George coming out more and more against the drug companies.
[00:56:45.564 --> 00:56:50.405]  And the way he did it was so smooth and so focused and so calm.
[00:56:50.405 --> 00:56:53.786]  And again, people all over the system are waking up and saying no to the New World Order.
[00:56:53.786 --> 00:56:55.386]  You can't kill us all, Merck.
[00:56:57.895 --> 00:57:10.220]  The email which came out of the federal court in Melbourne yesterday as part of a class action suit against the drug company included the words, neutralize, neutralized, or discredit against some of the doctor's names, the Australian reported.
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:18.863]  It also alleged the company used intimidation tactics against clinical research including dropping hints that it would stop funding the institutions and claims it interfered with academic appointments.
[00:57:18.863 --> 00:57:20.403]  That's nothing.
[00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:24.205]  We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live, a Merck employee wrote.
[00:57:25.464 --> 00:57:30.326]  According to an email... See, that guy's probably Special Ops, former Special Ops.
[00:57:30.326 --> 00:57:31.747]  He's Seek and Destroy.
[00:57:31.747 --> 00:57:32.647]  Seek and!
[00:57:32.647 --> 00:57:34.008]  Seek and Destroy!
[00:57:34.008 --> 00:57:36.049]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:40.991]  We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live, like you do our daughters with the HPV shot.
[00:57:40.991 --> 00:57:52.276]  A Merck employee wrote, according to an email excerpt, read to the court by Julian Burnside QC, acting for the plaintiff.
[00:57:53.197 --> 00:58:03.584]  Merck & Co., and it's Australian subsidiary, Merck, Sharp, and Dome, are being sued for compensation for more than 1,000 Australians who claim they suffered heart attacks and strokes as a result of Vioxx.
[00:58:03.584 --> 00:58:04.865]  Well, it's on record, Vioxx did that.
[00:58:04.865 --> 00:58:05.565]  They admit it.
[00:58:05.565 --> 00:58:14.671]  The drug was launched in 99, as the height of its popularity was used by 80 million people worldwide because it did not cause stomach problems and did traditional anti-inflammatory drugs.
[00:58:14.671 --> 00:58:17.293]  And it goes on.
[00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:19.774]  Neutralize!
[00:58:19.774 --> 00:58:20.335]  Terminate!
[00:58:22.864 --> 00:58:24.645]  Bob Chapman coming up on the economy.
[00:58:24.645 --> 00:58:26.425]  Tons of news on that front.
[00:58:26.425 --> 00:58:35.968]  But if they'll send out neutralization teams to seek them out where they live and terminate people, what will the Federal Reserve do to stop an audit?
[00:58:35.968 --> 00:58:41.850]  Well, I think you saw that at the Jewish Center, didn't you?
[00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:43.251]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:59.245]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:58:59.245 --> 00:59:04.408]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[00:59:04.408 --> 00:59:06.990]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:09.453]  Actually results in disease.

[00:59:25.171 --> 00:59:26.152]  Colloidal Gold!
[00:59:26.673 --> 00:59:27.633]  We're good to go.
[00:59:53.078 --> 00:59:55.480]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.480 --> 01:00:04.786]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.786 --> 01:00:06.087]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.087 --> 01:00:07.868]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.868 --> 01:00:09.629]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.629 --> 01:00:11.210]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:12.771]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.771 --> 01:00:16.954]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.954 --> 01:00:21.017]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.527 --> 01:00:26.688]  It is the 2009 Second Annual Money Bomb.
[01:00:26.688 --> 01:00:33.109]  We're about to change the little graph there at Infowarsmoneybomb.com to $225,000.
[01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:37.449]  It's gone up about $10,000 in the last two hours.
[01:00:37.449 --> 01:00:43.490]  It'll run throughout the weekend, but in one day, over $215,000 was raised.
[01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:49.891]  I want to thank all the listeners and everybody out there, whether you gave a dollar, or whether you emailed people and told them about the Money Bomb, or whether you gave $500.
[01:00:49.891 --> 01:00:52.512]  I want to thank you, all of it,
[01:00:53.493 --> 01:01:03.422]  We'll be apportioned to pay for more cameras, more video editors, and we'll even show you the space we're renting next door to expand the TV studio.
[01:01:03.422 --> 01:01:04.844]  We ran out of room in here.
[01:01:04.844 --> 01:01:08.227]  And we're going to really hustle now to get this done as quickly as possible.
[01:01:08.227 --> 01:01:13.031]  I'm signing the lease on the warehouse space next to us today!
[01:01:13.031 --> 01:01:13.412]  Today!
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.642]  So in the next week or so, I can get in there and show you a video of the space.
[01:01:17.642 --> 01:01:26.409]  What we're going to do, I really appreciate everybody's great support, because by locking this amount of money in, you guarantee that the next year we'll have the funds we need.
[01:01:26.409 --> 01:01:33.615]  Because I don't just move ahead with something where I can get in trouble and run out of cash and go bankrupt.
[01:01:33.615 --> 01:01:39.879]  You allow us to move forward briskly and in a healthy fashion against the New World Order, tiny as we may be.
[01:01:40.933 --> 01:01:49.915]  We are a projectile speeding through the flesh of the New World Order towards its heart, burrowing our way at light speed, thanks to you.
[01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:56.016]  And when you spread the word, when you pray for us, when you take action, when you go out and speak out, we are all in this together.
[01:01:56.016 --> 01:02:00.636]  You accelerate our trajectory.
[01:02:00.636 --> 01:02:05.217]  Now, we've got Bob Chapman with us for the full hour, and I appreciate him coming on.
[01:02:05.217 --> 01:02:09.478]  We've got chemtrail news, a lot of police state news, but
[01:02:11.175 --> 01:02:15.738]  The AP announced two days ago that the Feds aren't just going to take over the banks.
[01:02:15.738 --> 01:02:21.923]  They're not just taking over Chrysler and GM and then handing it over to select globalist families.
[01:02:21.923 --> 01:02:30.209]  They are now going to tell many other types of companies and industries what you can be paid, what you can do.
[01:02:30.209 --> 01:02:35.033]  And the federal government is openly now just ordering companies and individuals
[01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:47.459]  around in a totally managed economy, but not even managed to help society, which would be bad enough, that always fails, because corruption is involved, but openly to conduit the money out of the country.
[01:02:47.459 --> 01:02:54.824]  This is, the whole homeland security grid is meant to squeeze every drop of blood out of this nation.
[01:02:54.824 --> 01:03:05.212]  What we've laughed about happening to third world countries, feeling like we were part of the empire and ha ha ha's a lot of good old boys do, even low level ones, is now going to happen to us.
[01:03:06.141 --> 01:03:13.423]  Unless we stop him, but now, with the Von Brun thing, the more I look at it, he's been in federal custody six years from his last annex.
[01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:20.946]  The way the feds like to work is they'll shoot a couple people, shoot Brun, brain damage him so he can't ever talk again, kill the guard.
[01:03:20.946 --> 01:03:24.147]  The Russians have been caught doing that, it's a favorite trick.
[01:03:24.147 --> 01:03:34.810]  Because it came right on time when the Federal Reserve was about to be audited, and I just read these internal emails out of federal courts about Vioxx saying, the owners of Vioxx saying, go out and liquidate, kill.
[01:03:36.361 --> 01:03:39.243]  Um, seek and destroy doctors and people that criticize them.
[01:03:39.243 --> 01:03:41.025]  So this is how big corporations act.
[01:03:41.025 --> 01:03:45.428]  I wanted to get Bob Chapman's take on that and then the economy, but Bob, good to have you here with us.
[01:03:45.428 --> 01:03:46.149]  Well, thank you.
[01:03:46.149 --> 01:03:47.210]  It's good to be back again.
[01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:55.937]  Uh, Bob, we got about a minute, but my point there about Von Brune, I want to come back and talk more about this, but what do you, what do you see happening there?
[01:03:55.937 --> 01:03:58.779]  Do you smell a big, fat, gigantic, stinking rat?
[01:03:58.779 --> 01:04:00.640]  Well, I think there's a good chance of it.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.342]  Um, we're not on the inside.
[01:04:03.553 --> 01:04:08.216]  We don't know for sure, but it's like everything else, we have to back into it.
[01:04:08.216 --> 01:04:12.919]  And in so doing, we have to hope that our appraisal of what went on is correct.
[01:04:12.919 --> 01:04:18.022]  So we'll just have to wait and see, but that's a good possibility.
[01:04:18.022 --> 01:04:30.550]  This business with the 1207, which is the Ron Paul bill, has become enormously powerful.
[01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:31.791]  I know you're up to date on it.
[01:04:33.695 --> 01:04:36.436]  But I want you to fill us in with your angle on it.
[01:04:36.436 --> 01:04:39.677]  I mean, do we realize the success we're having?
[01:04:39.677 --> 01:04:40.857]  We sure do.
[01:04:40.857 --> 01:04:44.398]  We have to believe in ourselves to be winners.
[01:04:44.398 --> 01:04:45.319]  Stay with us, Bob Chapman.
[01:04:45.319 --> 01:04:48.540]  Let's break that down right now and how you see the enemy coming after us.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:58.263]  We're trying to kick out the foreign alien private banking government, the corporate takeover, the criminals, the illegitimate criminals that need to be thrown in irons.
[01:05:00.285 --> 01:05:06.147]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[01:05:06.147 --> 01:05:07.448]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:05:07.448 --> 01:05:11.709]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[01:05:11.709 --> 01:05:13.570]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:19.893]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:05:21.033 --> 01:05:23.894]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:05:23.894 --> 01:05:25.635]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:05:25.635 --> 01:05:28.636]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:05:28.636 --> 01:05:30.357]  And their formula really works.
[01:05:30.357 --> 01:05:33.158]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:05:33.158 --> 01:05:34.659]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:05:34.659 --> 01:05:39.421]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:05:39.421 --> 01:05:41.842]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:05:41.842 --> 01:05:44.303]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:05:44.303 --> 01:05:46.404]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:05:46.404 --> 01:05:47.524]  Go to www.
[01:05:57.354 --> 01:06:05.604]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:06:05.604 --> 01:06:09.328]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.628 --> 01:06:10.309]  Number 2.
[01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:15.512]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.512 --> 01:06:16.173]  It's true.
[01:06:16.173 --> 01:06:20.596]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.596 --> 01:06:21.516]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.516 --> 01:06:27.140]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:27.800]  Number 4.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.702]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:06:30.702 --> 01:06:34.365]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:35.225]  Number 5.
[01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:38.848]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:06:39.068 --> 01:06:44.792]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[01:07:00.435 --> 01:07:07.477]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:07:07.477 --> 01:07:12.038]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:07:12.038 --> 01:07:17.639]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:07:17.639 --> 01:07:25.181]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:07:25.181 --> 01:07:30.062]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.

[01:07:36.404 --> 01:07:42.185]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[01:08:00.433 --> 01:08:05.836]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.836 --> 01:08:08.157]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:08.157 --> 01:08:16.242]  I want to salute all the great listeners.
[01:08:16.242 --> 01:08:21.765]  We do this pledge drive once a year.
[01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:24.227]  One day, June 11th, we're now on the
[01:08:26.323 --> 01:08:28.847]  The downside of that going down the hill.
[01:08:28.847 --> 01:08:30.930]  The donations are still coming in.
[01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:32.693]  Wrap it up over the weekend.
[01:08:32.693 --> 01:08:34.075]  The InfoWars Money Bomb.
[01:08:34.075 --> 01:08:35.217]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:08:35.217 --> 01:08:38.062]  It's now reached $225,000 of donations in the last 24 hours.
[01:08:42.153 --> 01:08:43.294]  Started at 11 a.m.
[01:08:43.294 --> 01:08:44.254]  yesterday.
[01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:49.277]  We're now 25 hours in, and last time it took three days to hit 225,000.
[01:08:49.277 --> 01:08:52.539]  I think we'll do it in a day and a half this time.
[01:08:52.539 --> 01:08:53.980]  So I want to commend all of you.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:09:04.966]  That will help us move into an even larger studio next door, expand what we're doing, and it will allow us to put a generator on the roof so we don't have the power go off, because the power goes off sometimes.
[01:09:04.966 --> 01:09:10.209]  We're in this industrial park, and then the batteries on the backup systems run out, as they did two days ago.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:18.544]  And power was out to large parts of Austin last night, but thank God not here with incredible storms that hit.
[01:09:18.544 --> 01:09:19.665]  So a lot of things going on.
[01:09:19.665 --> 01:09:25.709]  We thank you for your support with the 2009 InfoWars Money Bomb.
[01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:30.932]  And still not too late to get involved in that, and I do want to hit the goal of 250,000 by the end of the show today.
[01:09:30.932 --> 01:09:35.235]  Let's see if we can do it and go past what we did last year.
[01:09:35.235 --> 01:09:37.477]  That will certainly anger the critics, and that's also important.
[01:09:39.421 --> 01:09:40.502]  See, there I am being bad.
[01:09:40.502 --> 01:09:44.345]  I'm trying not to be as worldly and aggressive and competitive.
[01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:47.708]  Trying to do this purely focused to defeat the New World Order.
[01:09:47.708 --> 01:09:51.031]  But humans, it's said, are dog-like and horse-like.
[01:09:51.031 --> 01:09:53.293]  You ever seen how competitive horses are with each other?
[01:09:53.293 --> 01:09:58.658]  When they're out in the field racing each other?
[01:09:58.658 --> 01:09:59.458]  Here's the deal.
[01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:04.102]  Obama oust AmeriCorps' head, who investigated Friend,
[01:10:05.031 --> 01:10:08.472]  They've also fired the head of cyber security two months ago.
[01:10:08.472 --> 01:10:11.712]  It's now come out the head of cyber security is under a gag order.
[01:10:11.712 --> 01:10:20.794]  But before he was under the gag order, which I think violates his free speech, they're saying national security, he said the NSA and military are taking over the entire internet.
[01:10:20.794 --> 01:10:23.675]  And they are, so they can quote, shut it down for your safety.
[01:10:23.675 --> 01:10:26.576]  That's the headline.
[01:10:26.576 --> 01:10:28.016]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:10:29.562 --> 01:10:39.730]  And to talk about corruption, President Barack Obama says he lost confidence in the Inspector General who investigates AmeriCorps and other national service programs and has told Congress he is removing him from position.
[01:10:39.730 --> 01:10:52.059]  I guess he didn't get enough kids in red and black uniforms to march around chanting his name, as they now have in their own federal TV ads, paid for with taxpayer money to recruit private people to work for the Democratic Party.
[01:10:52.059 --> 01:10:54.201]  I mean, this is all completely illegal.
[01:10:54.201 --> 01:10:55.862]  The General Accounting Office is on record.
[01:10:55.862 --> 01:10:58.144]  When Bush was trying it and now Obama is doing it.
[01:10:59.594 --> 01:11:03.778]  Also, the United Nations has announced their new list of international terrorists and gun owners.
[01:11:03.778 --> 01:11:05.319]  Counterterrorism database goes live.
[01:11:05.319 --> 01:11:09.723]  It's a global MIAC slash Homeland Security report.
[01:11:09.723 --> 01:11:10.443]  We'll break that down.
[01:11:10.443 --> 01:11:13.105]  But let's go back to Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:11:13.105 --> 01:11:16.989]  For those that don't know who Bob is, we've got a lot of new big stations picking us up.
[01:11:16.989 --> 01:11:19.070]  In fact, I wrote it down.
[01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:23.154]  Ted came in and told me the station that picked us up yesterday, it's one of the biggest in LA.
[01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:25.456]  And then everybody was marveling here in the office because
[01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.510]  Cindy Sheehan used to live there and knows the station.
[01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:29.695]  KRLAH70!
[01:11:31.391 --> 01:11:32.992]  It's picking up the Sunday Show for starters.
[01:11:32.992 --> 01:11:36.534]  A lot of stations are kind of putting their toe in the water, picking up that Sunday Show.
[01:11:36.534 --> 01:11:39.215]  It's like, I think, ten new stations in the last month.
[01:11:39.215 --> 01:11:40.196]  So we've got a lot of new listeners.
[01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:41.817]  Let me just introduce Bob Chapman.
[01:11:41.817 --> 01:11:48.080]  Bob, before I get into the last question about Von Brun and whether it's staged or not, they're hyping it like the swine flu, basically.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.081]  You know, one death, it's the end of the world.
[01:11:50.081 --> 01:11:52.482]  One death, give up all your rights, hand in your guns.
[01:11:52.482 --> 01:11:55.524]  MSNBC says Von Brun loves Ron Paul.
[01:11:55.524 --> 01:11:57.065]  Ron Paul's basically evil now.
[01:11:58.345 --> 01:12:04.129]  I'm evil, they're attacking me, anybody who doesn't like the Federal Reserve and wants to audit it is a white supremacist.
[01:12:04.129 --> 01:12:08.711]  Before we get into that, tell folks briefly about Bob Chapman.
[01:12:08.711 --> 01:12:16.416]  Well, I was a stockbroker for 28 years, specializing in gold and silver shares on my own firm for many years.
[01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:23.240]  And I retired and I decided that I didn't like retirement, so I've been writing the International Forecaster for the past 20 years.
[01:12:24.366 --> 01:12:26.528]  And I've lived over probably half the world.
[01:12:26.528 --> 01:12:27.889]  I speak several languages.
[01:12:27.889 --> 01:12:32.453]  I worked in army counterintelligence for several years.
[01:12:32.453 --> 01:12:37.577]  And I think I've had one heck of an interesting life.
[01:12:37.577 --> 01:12:43.141]  And the adventure is not over yet, is it, my friend?
[01:12:43.141 --> 01:12:43.822]  No, it's not.
[01:12:43.822 --> 01:12:53.049]  And I've been working for the last three months, as you know, on the mainline media mostly, getting the word out on 1207.
[01:12:54.921 --> 01:13:04.244]  And I think the figure now is 222 co-sponsors for that bill.
[01:13:04.244 --> 01:13:08.565]  And so that means it gets voted on and in all probability passed.
[01:13:08.565 --> 01:13:17.107]  So I guess that the Federal Reserve will probably concentrate on trying to defeat the bill in the Senate.
[01:13:17.107 --> 01:13:24.029]  And that's why they hired the former head of the Enron lobbying contingent.
[01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:27.886]  A lady, Mrs. Robinson.
[01:13:27.886 --> 01:13:34.889]  And evidently they expect that they're going to be able to perhaps stop the bill in the Senate.
[01:13:34.889 --> 01:13:42.352]  The Senate bill has been just sitting there waiting to see what happened to the House.
[01:13:42.352 --> 01:13:45.434]  And we've done a good job in informing the people in the House.
[01:13:45.434 --> 01:13:54.138]  So S-604, which is the Federal Reserve Sunshine Act of 2009, sponsored by Bernard Sanders,
[01:13:56.685 --> 01:13:58.686]  This should be our next target.
[01:13:58.686 --> 01:14:10.993]  We should go to all the senators and tell them we want the bill passed so that we can have an investigation and an audit of what the Federal Reserve has been doing.
[01:14:10.993 --> 01:14:15.556]  And when the public finds out what they've been doing, they're not going to be very happy about it.
[01:14:15.556 --> 01:14:18.377]  Plus their obvious failures.
[01:14:18.377 --> 01:14:22.820]  I saw Larry Summers this morning on CNBC telling us
[01:14:23.677 --> 01:14:39.202]  Well, these kind of things are normal and to be expected, but we have to remember that the Federal Reserve was created to do away with all these things starting in 1913, these horrible depressions and recessions and panics that we had during the late 1880s.
[01:14:39.202 --> 01:14:40.583]  And so they haven't done that.
[01:14:40.583 --> 01:14:43.744]  They've done a terrible visual job.
[01:14:43.744 --> 01:14:46.765]  And so I want to see that we get rid of them.
[01:14:46.765 --> 01:14:52.727]  And I think that that could start us on our way back, at least economically and financially,
[01:14:53.257 --> 01:14:54.098]  From where we're at.
[01:14:54.098 --> 01:15:05.405]  But I do believe that we will desperately need legislation which will institute tariffs on goods and services.
[01:15:05.405 --> 01:15:13.770]  And that's going to be very important because we've got to stop the transnational conglomerates from sucking all the jobs out of the United States.
[01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:22.596]  We've already lost from a number of ways approximately 14 million jobs over the last eight years.
[01:15:23.459 --> 01:15:30.662]  And about six million of them can be directly attributed to free trade, globalization, offshoring, and outsourcing.
[01:15:30.662 --> 01:15:38.646]  And Bob, the facts are in, for those that go, oh this isn't free market, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists aren't free market.
[01:15:38.646 --> 01:15:41.687]  They admit it's not meant to have a good, vibrant economy.
[01:15:41.687 --> 01:15:51.872]  Everything is to consolidate power in their hands, and that's what they've set up with tax incentives to move overseas, and all these environmental rules and taxes on
[01:15:52.512 --> 01:15:59.373]  Companies that stay here so they can't stay in business and regulations on mining and timber and everything else.
[01:15:59.373 --> 01:16:01.654]  It is designed as a form of mercantilism.
[01:16:01.654 --> 01:16:17.117]  For those that don't know, under the old French system adopted by the British, a mercantilism, they would only allow their holdings or their colonial slave empires to develop raw materials and then they would take back goods to the mother country that they controlled
[01:16:17.957 --> 01:16:33.490]  To have the value-added goods, or durable goods, or manufactured items, and they stated on record, you know, in their parliaments and in their palaces, this is all part of history for those that don't know, and Bob, I'd like you to speak to this, that it was done to keep control over the slave grids.
[01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:42.337]  Well, now this mercantilism, they move the factories to slave countries where the people are too poor to ever get any of the products, to ever do business back with another nation,
[01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:44.298]  And it's meant to vertically integrate.
[01:16:44.298 --> 01:16:45.759]  This is not a free market.
[01:16:45.759 --> 01:16:55.263]  This is the private banks financing the criminal consolidation so they can bankrupt and get everybody dependent on government to then carry out the eugenics operation.
[01:16:55.263 --> 01:17:07.129]  And on top of that, most people don't realize that the profits that are being made by these transnational conglomerates are going to offshore locations like the Cayman Islands.
[01:17:07.129 --> 01:17:08.950]  And if they don't repatriate the capital
[01:17:10.938 --> 01:17:13.359]  They pay about a 2% tax.
[01:17:13.359 --> 01:17:26.745]  Now, back four years ago, there was legislation and the legislation said that these offshore corporations could bring their money back if they chose, but that was to create jobs.
[01:17:26.745 --> 01:17:38.090]  Well, they got the legislation, jobs were never created, they moved $350 billion back into the United States at not a 35% tax rate,
[01:17:39.881 --> 01:17:40.061]  I think?
[01:17:58.919 --> 01:18:08.023]  That's right, they call it getting rid of tax shelters, but really it's just like the tax-free foundations in 1906 was built as a way to defeat the robber barons.
[01:18:08.023 --> 01:18:17.848]  It really made their money private go into these foundations so that it was completely protected and couldn't be investigated.
[01:18:17.848 --> 01:18:22.450]  And they used that to further consolidate their power to the Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller Endowment.
[01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:33.497]  Uh, and others, and of course they were all eugenicists at the time, and their sons are now in control now, the elderly David Rockefeller and others, and so it's still the same mindset, still the same program.
[01:18:33.497 --> 01:18:41.142]  Uh, Bob Chapman, getting back to, uh, Mr. von Brun in this shooting and HR 1207, 225 sponsors now, going to the floor in the next week or so.
[01:18:45.743 --> 01:18:57.997]  And the COINTELPRO operation from the establishment I've noticed the last few years when this has been building is, oh, they just want to audit the Fed so they can set up a new bank of the world, destroy the Fed, and set up a new bank of the world.
[01:18:57.997 --> 01:18:58.338]  No.
[01:18:58.338 --> 01:19:00.580]  If you audit the Fed, it is a tentacle.
[01:19:01.753 --> 01:19:09.919]  Or a proboscis, a suction vehicle to the big Anglo-American slash European complex, banking complex.
[01:19:09.919 --> 01:19:14.002]  I want your take on this when we get back, Bob, your analysis with Bob Chapman.
[01:19:14.002 --> 01:19:19.467]  And so if you break open the door on the bankers, you show the crime of private central banking and the fraud.
[01:19:19.467 --> 01:19:20.928]  It then brings down the whole system.
[01:19:21.428 --> 01:19:23.549]  So it's part and parcel.
[01:19:23.549 --> 01:19:25.490]  It's like an arm of the New World Order.
[01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:30.853]  So they're saying, oh, don't investigate the arm, because then you'll put the rest of the body in control.
[01:19:30.853 --> 01:19:34.195]  Certainly, if we start beating them, they're going to try to spin it into that.
[01:19:34.195 --> 01:19:36.216]  But that's not what's happening here.
[01:19:36.216 --> 01:19:43.820]  And so despite the fact that people inside our movement with the government op tried to stop what we were doing, we're marching forward.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:50.023]  And even if this fails and they have a little fake celebration, it is going to be short-lived, because now the people
[01:19:50.803 --> 01:19:55.724]  Irrevocably, know who the enemy is, the private fellow reserve, and the few that don't know are now learning.
[01:19:55.724 --> 01:20:00.705]  We are on the edge of truly engaging the enemy toe-to-toe.

[01:21:07.328 --> 01:21:13.209]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:13.209 --> 01:21:19.351]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:19.691 --> 01:21:21.652]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:21.652 --> 01:21:24.134]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:24.134 --> 01:21:37.323]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:21:37.323 --> 01:21:39.004]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.004 --> 01:21:40.866]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:40.866 --> 01:21:47.090]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:21:47.757 --> 01:21:56.032]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:56.032 --> 01:21:57.595]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.595 --> 01:21:58.797]  The people strike back!
[01:22:00.552 --> 01:22:07.234]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.234 --> 01:22:15.336]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:15.336 --> 01:22:20.918]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[01:22:21.258 --> 01:22:23.500]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:28.604]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.604 --> 01:22:33.828]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:33.828 --> 01:22:38.171]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:38.171 --> 01:22:39.272]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:39.272 --> 01:22:43.775]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:43.775 --> 01:22:44.696]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:48.659 --> 01:22:51.640]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.420]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:53.660]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:53.921]  You worry.
[01:22:53.921 --> 01:22:55.361]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:55.541]  Hi.
[01:22:55.541 --> 01:22:57.822]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:23:06.224 --> 01:23:10.765]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:23:10.765 --> 01:23:13.246]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:23:13.246 --> 01:23:16.587]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:23:16.587 --> 01:23:18.527]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:23:18.527 --> 01:23:21.308]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:23:21.308 --> 01:23:25.029]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:23:25.029 --> 01:23:29.450]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:33.191]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:23:33.551 --> 01:23:39.879]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:23:39.879 --> 01:23:42.222]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:23:42.222 --> 01:23:44.344]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[01:23:44.344 --> 01:23:49.009]  So go to offthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:23:49.009 --> 01:23:49.911]  Start now.
[01:23:49.911 --> 01:23:51.633]  Knowledge is power.
[01:23:51.633 --> 01:23:52.634]  Better take action.
[01:23:52.634 --> 01:23:53.595]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:24:12.856 --> 01:24:38.602]  Don't want no shackles Don't want no shackles on me Don't want no shackles Don't want no shackles on me I sat down with Big Brother Don't like those RFIDs That is Jimmy Vaughn
[01:24:41.224 --> 01:24:42.466]  Okay, going back to Bob Chapman.
[01:24:42.466 --> 01:24:48.154]  Bob, specifically, the point I'm making, and I want your view on this, is it's all coming to a head.
[01:24:49.278 --> 01:24:51.459]  We're having this incredible victory.
[01:24:51.459 --> 01:24:53.119]  We have to recognize we have power.
[01:24:53.119 --> 01:24:55.199]  We have to recognize we have destiny.
[01:24:55.199 --> 01:24:59.761]  We have to believe it and image it and move forward knowing we're right and knowing we don't have a choice.
[01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:06.102]  We are under scientific bondage of a group of private offshore banks that have engaged in a corporate takeover of the U.S.
[01:25:06.102 --> 01:25:14.684]  They probably would have gotten away with it, but they're so greedy that they're looting and stealing everything, thinking Homeland Security and NORTHCOM can protect them in it.
[01:25:14.684 --> 01:25:17.485]  They plan to bring us into a greater crisis so they can have a clampdown.
[01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:20.086]  We have their own documents.
[01:25:20.086 --> 01:25:21.307]  But now we're fighting back.
[01:25:21.307 --> 01:25:22.829]  Ron Paul's risking his life.
[01:25:22.829 --> 01:25:24.470]  We've supported him.
[01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:30.655]  The people have called for months by the thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands to Washington on record.
[01:25:30.655 --> 01:25:32.276]  We now have it at 225.
[01:25:32.276 --> 01:25:33.237]  It's going to go to the floor.
[01:25:33.237 --> 01:25:34.357]  It's got a good chance of passing.
[01:25:34.357 --> 01:25:39.982]  And even if it doesn't, people are going to have to defend why this group's above the law, why they can't be investigated.
[01:25:39.982 --> 01:25:42.564]  And Congress, separately as you know, Bob, is now
[01:25:44.528 --> 01:25:48.009]  subpoenaing the Fed saying, you will tell us where the Bank of America money went.
[01:25:48.009 --> 01:25:49.910]  You will tell us where the billions went.
[01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:52.071]  You will tell us where the $300 billion went on that.
[01:25:52.071 --> 01:25:56.593]  You will tell us why you ordered the CEO to buy another bank that was healthy.
[01:25:57.438 --> 01:25:58.458]  You will tell us.
[01:25:58.458 --> 01:26:02.259]  Well, because there's stockholders, the Rockefellers and others over Bank of America.
[01:26:02.259 --> 01:26:03.200]  They're getting the profit.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.280]  It's always about the CEOs.
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:10.402]  But the CEOs, Bob, aren't they literally like the kind of like the pirates sent out by the Pirate King?
[01:26:10.402 --> 01:26:13.222]  And he gets flayed alive if he doesn't do what he's told?
[01:26:13.222 --> 01:26:18.424]  I mean, aren't these CEOs just diversions from the real power?
[01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:21.085]  We may call them the mercenaries.
[01:26:21.085 --> 01:26:22.605]  And that's exactly what they are.
[01:26:22.605 --> 01:26:24.766]  And it's like the presidents that we get for the country.
[01:26:24.766 --> 01:26:25.506]  They're simply
[01:26:26.468 --> 01:26:29.050]  Mercenaries that do what they're told to do.
[01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:55.608]  But harking back to what you spoke of just before the break, this piece of legislation, which I think will pass in the House, is probably the biggest thing that's happened to bring the American people together and to attack the real problem, the underlying problem with our economic and financial being.
[01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:57.970]  And that is the Federal Reserve.
[01:26:57.970 --> 01:27:00.252]  And you alluded to this before.
[01:27:00.252 --> 01:27:03.934]  And of course, for the British, the Bank of England.
[01:27:03.934 --> 01:27:10.018]  That is another private organization upon which the Federal Reserve was modeled.
[01:27:10.018 --> 01:27:12.079]  And we're getting the word out.
[01:27:12.079 --> 01:27:16.682]  We're making people understand who is doing it to them.
[01:27:16.682 --> 01:27:18.103]  Who is robbing them.
[01:27:18.922 --> 01:27:20.302]  Who is corrupt?
[01:27:20.302 --> 01:27:24.644]  It's the guys in the $4,000, $3,000 suits.
[01:27:24.644 --> 01:27:26.244]  That's who it is.
[01:27:26.244 --> 01:27:27.125]  And what does G.I.
[01:27:27.125 --> 01:27:27.665]  Joe say?
[01:27:27.665 --> 01:27:28.205]  What does G.I.
[01:27:28.205 --> 01:27:29.105]  Joe say?
[01:27:29.105 --> 01:27:30.646]  Knowing is half the battle.
[01:27:30.646 --> 01:27:37.388]  We are now identifying the enemy, identifying the illegitimate criminals, and once we've educated the public, we win.
[01:27:37.388 --> 01:27:47.392]  That's why they're going to have to stage events and say it's anti-Semitic to not want the Federal Reserve, and they're going to make it racial and religious and inject that into the middle of it.
[01:27:47.392 --> 01:27:48.452]  And it's not going to work.
[01:27:49.355 --> 01:27:51.236]  It just isn't going to work.
[01:27:51.236 --> 01:27:53.558]  And that was foolish of them to do that.
[01:27:53.558 --> 01:27:54.898]  But that's okay.
[01:27:54.898 --> 01:27:57.340]  If that's what they want to do, that's fine.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:01.362]  As you say, we're going toe-to-toe and head-to-head.
[01:28:01.362 --> 01:28:04.504]  The right thing at the right time.
[01:28:04.504 --> 01:28:09.948]  And, you know, Congressman McFadden would have been successful if they hadn't murdered him.
[01:28:09.948 --> 01:28:13.450]  And so this time, we're really going to take a shot at him.
[01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:15.431]  Because it's not only Ron Paul.
[01:28:15.431 --> 01:28:18.133]  There's all of these people surrounding him.
[01:28:18.133 --> 01:28:18.753]  Americans.
[01:28:19.235 --> 01:28:21.396]  Of all stripes, so to speak.
[01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:23.778]  Politically and otherwise.
[01:28:23.778 --> 01:28:29.961]  America's coming together like Anthony J. Hilder and I discussed in this program before.
[01:28:29.961 --> 01:28:33.323]  He and I have been fighting for years to make this happen.
[01:28:33.323 --> 01:28:37.646]  And it's happening brought together by economic and financial events.
[01:28:38.803 --> 01:28:43.125]  Bob, it's got to feel good to you, the sacrifices, the attacks.
[01:28:43.125 --> 01:28:47.228]  You've even been driven out of this country by these criminals.
[01:28:47.228 --> 01:28:50.890]  Your choice, you could operate and not be stopped by them because they're scared of you.
[01:28:50.890 --> 01:28:57.293]  It's got to feel good, though, to see we've come this far and to feel the momentum shifting.
[01:28:57.293 --> 01:29:00.375]  You can feel it and smell it.
[01:29:00.375 --> 01:29:04.937]  They're terrified that the world is going to find out what they're doing.
[01:29:04.937 --> 01:29:06.438]  And every morning when we start
[01:29:06.849 --> 01:29:10.890]  At 3.30 or 4 o'clock in the morning, doing the emails.
[01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:17.993]  They're in from Australia and Malaysia and Japan and we make the gamut.
[01:29:17.993 --> 01:29:23.715]  They start coming in from Latvia, Kazakhstan and so on and so forth.
[01:29:23.715 --> 01:29:29.557]  People are listening to these programs all over the world and we are drilling these people.
[01:29:30.427 --> 01:29:36.849]  That's right, and we can't be stopped because Bob, you and I, and all the rest of us that are committed, like you said, we're not turning back.
[01:29:36.849 --> 01:29:37.669]  Point of no return.
[01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:38.989]  We can't be stopped.
[01:29:38.989 --> 01:29:40.790]  If God be with us, who can stand against us?
[01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:42.090]  Bob Chapman, stay there.
[01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:46.271]  Call straight ahead 1-800-259-9231 or Bob Chapman.
[01:29:46.271 --> 01:29:51.092]  We'll talk more about what's happening in the economy when we get back.
[01:29:51.092 --> 01:29:52.473]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.473 --> 01:29:55.013]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.013 --> 01:29:57.714]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:02.222]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.222 --> 01:30:06.969]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:30:06.969 --> 01:30:09.933]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:30:09.933 --> 01:30:12.977]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:30:12.977 --> 01:30:17.704]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:30:17.904 --> 01:30:19.045]  If you simply prepare.
[01:30:19.045 --> 01:30:22.288]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation that you need.
[01:30:22.288 --> 01:30:29.274]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:32:16.527 --> 01:32:17.127]  We're good to go.
[01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:36.196]  Let's do this!
[01:33:23.499 --> 01:33:28.262]  The seasons don't fear the Reaper.
[01:33:28.262 --> 01:33:35.828]  Speaking of the Reaper, Bob Chapman, we look at how they kidnapped
[01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:45.389]  Different Congressmen and Senators.
[01:33:45.389 --> 01:33:48.330]  Children, the Lindberghs.
[01:33:48.330 --> 01:33:53.412]  We look at how they killed members of Congress who fought the Federal Reserve Act.
[01:33:53.412 --> 01:33:54.813]  They tried to kill Andrew Jackson.
[01:33:54.813 --> 01:34:04.157]  They tried to kill, or probably did kill, George Washington, just as a figurehead because he was speaking out against it.
[01:34:06.121 --> 01:34:10.602]  This is on record in the mainline history books, and Ron Paul has said he knows he's in danger.
[01:34:10.602 --> 01:34:16.884]  We should probably do a story documenting the dirty tricks of the bankers before, because this is the shadow government.
[01:34:16.884 --> 01:34:17.964]  This is the parasites.
[01:34:17.964 --> 01:34:23.166]  This is the enemy of all free humans, no matter what color or religion you are.
[01:34:23.166 --> 01:34:25.886]  And we don't need to let them make it racial, make it religious.
[01:34:25.886 --> 01:34:27.727]  That's their game.
[01:34:27.727 --> 01:34:28.707]  That's what they want.
[01:34:28.707 --> 01:34:31.728]  And don't let the white supremacist and people bully you into playing that game.
[01:34:31.728 --> 01:34:35.409]  Notice the ADL and the white supremacist are on the same team when it comes to that.
[01:34:36.323 --> 01:34:38.528]  Fight the International Federal Reserve.
[01:34:38.528 --> 01:34:40.211]  Fight the foreign offshore banks.
[01:34:42.967 --> 01:34:46.450]  Bob Chapman, I mean, you know the history of it.
[01:34:46.450 --> 01:34:52.254]  The film we carry, The Money Masters, three hours long, breaks it all down, but the general public may not.
[01:34:52.254 --> 01:34:55.237]  What do you expect to see the globalists do to try to stop this?
[01:34:55.237 --> 01:35:01.342]  I mean, more state shootings, or hyping real shootings, or more MIAC reports demonizing in the Fed groups.
[01:35:01.342 --> 01:35:05.385]  They admit they have the Army spying on us, myself included, when I protest them.
[01:35:05.385 --> 01:35:07.907]  Where do you see this going?
[01:35:07.907 --> 01:35:12.030]  Well, I think we're going to get a lot more of the same, and they'll get more aggressive.
[01:35:12.970 --> 01:35:18.854]  And we'll just have to get more aggressive and get more time on more stations throughout the world.
[01:35:18.854 --> 01:35:24.397]  And they're getting heat, not only in the United States, they're getting it all over the world.
[01:35:24.397 --> 01:35:41.848]  And that's very important because, you know, they're throwing their hands up in the air, like they did three weeks ago at the Bilderberg meeting, and they said, I think that the major problem that we got here that we've got to solve is that what we've created, which is this financial and economic collapse that we're trying to
[01:35:44.625 --> 01:35:53.387]  Bring into being in the way that we want it to so that we can get full control is spinning out of control away from us.
[01:35:53.387 --> 01:36:01.109]  And we think that maybe we should bring this thing in so we can control it.
[01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:06.250]  And they I don't know whether they're in the process of trying to do that.
[01:36:06.250 --> 01:36:09.371]  But as they would try to do that, they would have to.
[01:36:09.932 --> 01:36:30.562]  Create all of these deflections to get people's thought patterns and the things that they're doing off on something else like the North Korean shooting missiles, the situation that exists in Iraq and Afghanistan and will they go into Pakistan?
[01:36:30.562 --> 01:36:33.544]  Will Israel attack Iran?
[01:36:33.544 --> 01:36:38.586]  And these are the things that they do to keep us, our mind off the subject.
[01:36:39.298 --> 01:36:43.941]  And the subject is very important because they're getting discovered.
[01:36:43.941 --> 01:36:47.964]  And this is what Ron Paul has done with this legislation.
[01:36:47.964 --> 01:36:56.790]  And even if we were to be defeated, millions and millions of people worldwide who now can identify who the enemy is.
[01:36:56.790 --> 01:37:01.293]  And there's going to be legislation like this in all three countries of the world.
[01:37:01.293 --> 01:37:05.816]  I mean, what we're doing is changing history.
[01:37:05.816 --> 01:37:08.017]  And it's happened over and over again.
[01:37:08.755 --> 01:37:11.576]  It's the right event at the right time.
[01:37:11.576 --> 01:37:22.142]  They are vulnerable because they have put this financial and economic situation mobile.
[01:37:22.142 --> 01:37:24.783]  They are making it happen and it's worldwide.
[01:37:24.783 --> 01:37:26.424]  It's not only in America.
[01:37:26.424 --> 01:37:31.206]  And it's to bring the world to its knees so they can be forced to accept world government.
[01:37:31.206 --> 01:37:38.310]  And so they're going to continue to do what they're doing with all the spying and picking people up and the violence and
[01:37:38.806 --> 01:37:43.490]  And the acts that they plan and execute, it's not going to get better, it's going to get worse.
[01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:46.052]  And we have to be ready for it.
[01:37:46.052 --> 01:37:51.736]  Well, Bob, we know the globalists are masters at engineering crises and then using the crisis they create to get to the next stage of power.
[01:37:51.736 --> 01:38:06.247]  And for decades, you've written and explained how when they finally imploded things by design, they would then announce a new bank of the world, a new global carbon tax, that this new private group would regulate and control the planet for everyone's ease and to stop the financial crises.
[01:38:06.727 --> 01:38:10.790]  Same thing they did in 1913 after staging crises that they later bragged about.
[01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:14.212]  They said, oh, we'll fix all the future crises, just give us power.
[01:38:14.212 --> 01:38:16.333]  Just like NAFTA and GATT, we're going to save our economy.
[01:38:16.333 --> 01:38:17.394]  And then it makes it worse.
[01:38:17.394 --> 01:38:22.057]  And they say, oh, more open borders and more false free trade is the answer.
[01:38:22.057 --> 01:38:23.078]  And then it makes it worse.
[01:38:23.078 --> 01:38:24.218]  And the answer is more, more, more.
[01:38:24.218 --> 01:38:24.699]  It's kind of like
[01:38:25.259 --> 01:38:32.325]  You know, if you punch somebody in the face five times and knock their teeth out, you say, here, this will make it better, and start punching them in the face ten more times.
[01:38:32.325 --> 01:38:34.487]  Or, here, let me take a, you know, tire iron to your head.
[01:38:34.487 --> 01:38:35.207]  Here, that'll fix it.
[01:38:35.207 --> 01:38:35.988]  Oh, your head's hurting?
[01:38:35.988 --> 01:38:37.129]  Here, I'll kill you.
[01:38:37.129 --> 01:38:39.251]  That'll get rid of the pain.
[01:38:39.251 --> 01:38:40.572]  I mean, this is very, very serious.
[01:38:40.572 --> 01:38:44.555]  And then all over the nation, I become conditioned, Bob.
[01:38:44.555 --> 01:38:45.796]  I become acclimated.
[01:38:45.796 --> 01:38:49.800]  And I've got to consciously realize this is happening and discipline myself against it.
[01:38:51.365 --> 01:38:58.248]  Bob, every day, and I know every day you see these as well, every day I get emails like the one I'm about to read.
[01:38:58.248 --> 01:39:01.009]  This is a mainstream news story, but I was sent an email with this story.
[01:39:01.009 --> 01:39:04.030]  The police department put out a press release, so did the U.S.
[01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.450]  Air Force.
[01:39:04.450 --> 01:39:05.791]  This is from the U.S.
[01:39:05.791 --> 01:39:11.513]  Air Force Security Force Squadron Unit Public Affairs Captain Tamara Fisher Carter.
[01:39:12.549 --> 01:39:30.879]  But, every day, sometimes three or four times a day, Texas, Michigan, Washington State, Virginia, West Virginia, just everywhere, same thing in Canada, same thing in England, same thing in Australia, same thing in Germany, same thing in New Zealand, everywhere, it's the same thing, but I get it just in the U.S.
[01:39:30.879 --> 01:39:31.220]  every day.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.382]  Without looking for it, without even being able to read all the email.
[01:39:35.382 --> 01:39:41.545]  It's, oh, there's a local regular Army Affairs is now going to have two officers in our small department of 15 officers.
[01:39:41.545 --> 01:39:44.987]  Or if it's a bigger department, oh, there's going to be 20 guys from the Army here.
[01:39:44.987 --> 01:39:47.068]  Some in intelligence, some in special ops.
[01:39:47.068 --> 01:39:52.691]  And then they admit in the articles they're going to be out watching the local citizens just to help the police.
[01:39:52.691 --> 01:40:00.535]  And, oh, in San Antonio for Fiesta, this happened before 9-11, oh, the Air Force MPs are out helping run checkpoints.
[01:40:02.333 --> 01:40:04.715]  Oh, the Marines and Army are going to help at car wrecks.
[01:40:04.715 --> 01:40:06.296]  You're not against helping at car wrecks, are you?
[01:40:06.296 --> 01:40:11.519]  And oh, they're going to be out at DWI checkpoints with guns, searching people.
[01:40:11.519 --> 01:40:18.703]  And North Com's announced, the Army's announced, because they've got to announce to their own people in the Army Times, hey, we're going to be on the streets of America.
[01:40:18.703 --> 01:40:25.327]  And oh, they're announcing, we're going to have checkpoints, we're going to have body scanners on the streets and subways and bus terminals.
[01:40:25.327 --> 01:40:27.128]  It's all being announced.
[01:40:27.128 --> 01:40:30.050]  Federal security forces are lining everybody up.
[01:40:31.849 --> 01:40:38.593]  Backed up by squads of paramilitary police, the bill's introduced to openly make law.
[01:40:38.593 --> 01:40:48.500]  It's already set up with FEMA camps for emergency medical centers, and people will want to go to the camps as the economy implodes, exactly as we predicted, because we've seen them do this in other countries.
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:49.641]  Now they admit it.
[01:40:49.641 --> 01:40:53.603]  Plus, we could reverse-engineer what they were setting up before, but now it's confirmed.
[01:40:53.603 --> 01:40:56.945]  Here it is, local military civilian police training bills.
[01:40:56.945 --> 01:40:57.806]  This is the one today.
[01:40:59.697 --> 01:41:04.761]  Patterson Air Force Base, Colorado, security forces, airmen, kicking in doors.
[01:41:04.761 --> 01:41:05.481]  I'm reading the article.
[01:41:05.481 --> 01:41:07.002]  This is from the Air Force.
[01:41:07.002 --> 01:41:23.614]  Security force airmen kicking in doors were only part of the action during a joint training exercise where the 21st Security Forces Squadron Airmen teamed up with members of the Colorado Springs Police Department, El Paso County Sheriff's Department, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, among other agencies.
[01:41:23.614 --> 01:41:25.236]  Colorado Springs, folks, that's the real government.
[01:41:26.092 --> 01:41:27.993]  There in the mountain.
[01:41:27.993 --> 01:41:36.817]  The training was meant to bolster skills and tactics as well as improve interagency communication vital at times of crisis.
[01:41:36.817 --> 01:41:50.163]  According to Major General Dumont, 21 SFS, Individual Mobilization, Augmentee, both military and civilian organizations, practice responding to a variety of situations where they routinely face a real-world situation.
[01:41:50.163 --> 01:41:53.385]  This is the first time all types of law enforcement came together for such training.
[01:41:54.085 --> 01:41:57.846]  Said Paul Macahow, a civilian law enforcement member.
[01:41:57.846 --> 01:42:03.007]  It helps improve the working relationships we have and builds valuable skills for us all.
[01:42:03.007 --> 01:42:06.167]  The training combined classroom instruction with field training.
[01:42:06.167 --> 01:42:08.868]  Guaranteeing they're talking about veterans and gun owners at this.
[01:42:08.868 --> 01:42:19.110]  Exercises where agencies participated in various special weapons and tactics techniques, explosives entry techniques, and tactical movement explosives were incorporated to add the realistic nature of the scenarios.
[01:42:19.926 --> 01:42:28.450]  And then they always blow stuff up in the town for a day or two, say terrorists really hit, to create the psychological fear to make the whole town a giant re-education camp, then later they announce it's a drill.
[01:42:28.450 --> 01:42:34.793]  The training familiarizes us with each other's agencies and we can offer a particular situation, said Major Dumont overall.
[01:42:34.793 --> 01:42:38.195]  The training was a major success in team building and technique.
[01:42:38.195 --> 01:42:43.278]  So, everywhere, and I have the videos of them trying to take on the local citizens,
[01:42:44.378 --> 01:42:50.180]  And to do all of this, they planned on imploding things, Bob.
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:54.681]  But what are the cops going to do when their families are losing everything?
[01:42:54.681 --> 01:42:58.342]  I guess maybe serve the system even more because they're scared?
[01:42:58.342 --> 01:43:00.203]  I mean, is there nothing they won't do?
[01:43:00.203 --> 01:43:02.123]  Bob Chapman?
[01:43:02.123 --> 01:43:11.686]  Well, I think like any organization, especially in law enforcement, because of the culture, it's always been them against us.
[01:43:12.492 --> 01:43:27.264]  And it was always seen by them as being a special group of people who were generally disliked by the public, even though they were taking criminals off the streets, so to speak.
[01:43:27.264 --> 01:43:35.310]  But now we have this federalization thing, and I think most of them just want to keep their jobs and they'll do as they're told just to get the paycheck.
[01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:38.293]  And we have lots of people in lots of fields that do that.
[01:43:38.293 --> 01:43:40.014]  Doctors are up against the same thing.
[01:43:40.444 --> 01:43:44.646]  Attorneys are, and if they speak out in court, they're held in contempt.
[01:43:44.646 --> 01:43:54.191]  And so there's all these barriers that have been set up, and the next barrier among law enforcement is going to be federalization.
[01:43:54.191 --> 01:44:03.115]  And policing organizations are going to have to decide whether they're going to go along with the federal government and lose their lives and lose their families.
[01:44:03.115 --> 01:44:08.458]  And I remind them again and again and again, there's 450 million weapons in the country.
[01:44:08.885 --> 01:44:12.627]  There's 80 million people who have been trained to do combat.
[01:44:12.627 --> 01:44:16.029]  There's 40 million people who have done combat.
[01:44:16.029 --> 01:44:20.292]  Do they really want to tangle with them?
[01:44:20.292 --> 01:44:25.615]  Well, the globalists aren't giving us a choice, and I can see the multi-level
[01:44:26.877 --> 01:44:27.437]  Chess Game!
[01:44:43.906 --> 01:44:47.027]  They've done this in other nations and I've read a lot of white papers on it.
[01:44:47.027 --> 01:44:57.211]  They plan to chew up the military and the police in a war against the American people and then bring in I-4 after when everybody's just begging for the power to be on.
[01:44:57.211 --> 01:44:59.792]  And I know a lot of people can't believe this is coming and going to happen.
[01:44:59.792 --> 01:45:04.554]  They are intending to do this and most of the police listening right now, you're going to be wounded or killed.
[01:45:04.554 --> 01:45:10.197]  And I'm sorry the globalists did this and they're not going to let you take everybody's kids to the FEMA camps.
[01:45:10.197 --> 01:45:12.177]  Everybody's not going to turn their guns into you.
[01:45:12.177 --> 01:45:12.938]  If one percent
[01:45:13.838 --> 01:45:17.141]  Of 150 million gun owners fight you, that's a million people.
[01:45:17.141 --> 01:45:22.405]  And I just, but I understand, you're on a power trip and you're going to have to see before you learn.
[01:45:22.405 --> 01:45:28.129]  But at least halfway into this carnage, maybe then they'll start waking up, Bob.
[01:45:28.129 --> 01:45:32.813]  Well, this week I had two stories of them shooting little tiny dogs.
[01:45:32.813 --> 01:45:34.234]  And I just couldn't believe it.
[01:45:34.234 --> 01:45:38.918]  I have them both in tomorrow's issue of the International Forecaster via link.
[01:45:38.918 --> 01:45:42.861]  But it just, you know, the dogs growled at them and so they shot them.
[01:45:43.291 --> 01:45:48.575]  I mean, I can understand if a dog jumps on you and starts to bite you, you'd have to shoot him.
[01:45:48.575 --> 01:45:53.879]  But these are little dogs, and I don't know what goes through their minds.
[01:45:53.879 --> 01:45:58.543]  You know, maybe they just want to try their weapons out for the day.
[01:45:58.543 --> 01:46:01.546]  Well, Bob, I was about to say, we should dig out the old tapes of the shows.
[01:46:01.546 --> 01:46:02.807]  I don't have the personnel to even do that.
[01:46:02.807 --> 01:46:04.828]  They're so busy on the limited things we're doing.
[01:46:04.828 --> 01:46:06.349]  But hopefully with this money bomb, that'll change.
[01:46:07.418 --> 01:46:18.508]  I did a bunch of local access TV reports 10-12 years ago where they would go to the house for marijuana, the cops freaked out, shot a lab that was chained up in the house in a cage.
[01:46:19.346 --> 01:46:19.506]  I think?
[01:46:38.268 --> 01:46:39.849]  And God forbid your dog bark.
[01:46:39.849 --> 01:46:40.770]  It's going to die.
[01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:45.513]  So there's thousands of cases, Bob, all over the country where they kill toy chihuahuas.
[01:46:45.513 --> 01:46:47.175]  They kill two-pound dogs.
[01:46:47.175 --> 01:46:51.578]  And they open fire, and they obliterate them, and they sometimes shoot the people inside the house.
[01:46:51.578 --> 01:46:53.119]  And it's all part of mental illness.
[01:46:53.119 --> 01:46:55.360]  And I don't care what excuses the cops make for this.
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:56.741]  You didn't act like this before.
[01:46:56.741 --> 01:46:58.863]  We're the most incarcerated country in the world.
[01:46:58.863 --> 01:47:05.148]  We're a joke, and your bosses ship the stinking drugs in to begin with, you fools.
[01:47:05.148 --> 01:47:05.588]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:47:06.749 --> 01:47:08.110]  Well, that's all true.
[01:47:08.110 --> 01:47:18.514]  And it just happened to hit me that these two incidents happened while we are looking at all these other things going on.
[01:47:18.514 --> 01:47:24.477]  The federalization of police and the escalation of stupid acts.
[01:47:24.477 --> 01:47:33.281]  The escalation of the buttoning down of the American people.
[01:47:33.281 --> 01:47:35.182]  The next thing that they're going to do, I believe,
[01:47:35.652 --> 01:47:37.733]  Is try to seal the borders.
[01:47:37.733 --> 01:47:43.555]  Now that's really unusual because they've had them virtually wide open for so long.
[01:47:43.555 --> 01:47:54.060]  And the reason they're going to do that is I think they're going to, down the line here when things get real nasty, I think they're going to put on currency controls.
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:56.201]  I think there's a good chance of that.
[01:47:56.201 --> 01:48:03.284]  And I've lived in currency control countries and it's like being in a financial prison because if you wanted to take money out you couldn't.
[01:48:04.025 --> 01:48:11.704]  And they want to control everybody's money because they think, they believe, that it all belongs to them.
[01:48:12.264 --> 01:48:13.585]  Well, let me expand on that.
[01:48:13.585 --> 01:48:14.926]  It is their fiat false money.
[01:48:14.926 --> 01:48:19.069]  We are the idiots that got conned by them, so in a sick way it's true.
[01:48:19.069 --> 01:48:24.813]  But, kind of like when a killer has a woman strapped down and he's about to rape and kill, you know, it's his ballgame.
[01:48:24.813 --> 01:48:28.877]  So, in a way, she does belong to him because she got in the car with him or got kidnapped.
[01:48:28.877 --> 01:48:31.298]  It's very sick, but it possesses nine-tenths of the law.
[01:48:31.298 --> 01:48:34.361]  We are their slaves until we stand up on our hind legs and say no.
[01:48:34.361 --> 01:48:39.745]  But, you know, you're bringing up what you just said is in a lot of their own documents and statements
[01:48:40.993 --> 01:48:46.794]  About what they're planning, that what they're going to do is lock the borders down with this new hemispheric travel card.
[01:48:46.794 --> 01:48:51.936]  And then they've already said they're just going to give all the illegal aliens in Mexico the new North American Union ID card.
[01:48:51.936 --> 01:48:57.357]  That American hemispheric card everybody hears on the news, and everybody's getting, that's in Canada and Mexico too.
[01:48:57.357 --> 01:48:58.978]  Their government's just issued them.
[01:48:58.978 --> 01:49:01.278]  It's going to be accepted by our government.
[01:49:01.278 --> 01:49:04.939]  And so the illegals are going to be allowed to go in and out.
[01:49:04.939 --> 01:49:08.220]  It's going to be slave Americans who aren't.
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:11.621]  They're going to keep the illegals off the no-fly list and the no-border list.
[01:49:11.621 --> 01:49:16.302]  I mean, this is all so selectively done, Bob.
[01:49:16.302 --> 01:49:26.524]  Yeah, and they want that, you know, essentially slave labor, which is so important for them to make the profits that continue to allow them to suppress the people.
[01:49:26.524 --> 01:49:31.745]  Not just profits, though, as you know, undermining real middle-class wages that allow you to provide for your family.
[01:49:32.918 --> 01:49:38.701]  Well, they suck it down from the bottom in this case, and they pull wages down at the lower end of the scale.
[01:49:38.701 --> 01:49:53.369]  That's why these people who are making automobiles and support industries in that area went from $30 down to $10 to $15 if they're lucky per hour, if they're lucky if they can get a job.
[01:49:53.369 --> 01:49:57.671]  And the same thing, incidentally, has happened in Mexico.
[01:49:57.671 --> 01:50:01.473]  The labor unions there have been forced
[01:50:02.150 --> 01:50:11.454]  To drop Mexican wages to the level, in many instances, of Chinese wages in order to keep the business so that they can keep people working.
[01:50:11.454 --> 01:50:13.995]  The race to the bottom, the sucking sound.
[01:50:13.995 --> 01:50:15.116]  That's right.
[01:50:15.116 --> 01:50:23.840]  And you know, we were talking about mercantilization, and we tried it in 1790 to 1800, and it was a disaster.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.061]  And that's why we put tariffs in.
[01:50:26.061 --> 01:50:30.443]  And that's why we became such a successful nation, or at least in part.
[01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:32.871]  That's part of the reason.
[01:50:32.871 --> 01:50:41.578]  We realize that we couldn't compete with slave labor, and we've got to do that again, and we need that legislation as soon as we get rid of the Fed.
[01:50:41.578 --> 01:50:42.619]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[01:50:42.619 --> 01:50:43.620]  Two more segments with him.
[01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:46.942]  Your call straight ahead on the other side on the economy.
[01:50:46.942 --> 01:50:51.125]  Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com is the website.

[01:51:00.646 --> 01:51:06.868]  How would you like to cook any meal using no electricity or gas and cook your meals off the grid?
[01:51:06.868 --> 01:51:07.968]  Well, now you can!
[01:51:07.968 --> 01:51:09.488]  Thanks to the Survival Oven.
[01:51:09.488 --> 01:51:17.251]  The Survival Oven is the most amazing off-grid solar oven that can cook anything that a conventional oven can without the energy bills.

[01:51:47.817 --> 01:51:51.839]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:51:51.839 --> 01:51:57.781]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:52:14.378 --> 01:52:20.900]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.940]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:25.441]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:25.441 --> 01:52:36.404]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:37.012 --> 01:52:38.693]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:38.693 --> 01:52:40.553]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:40.553 --> 01:52:47.455]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:52:57.278 --> 01:53:00.579]  The people strike back.
[01:53:00.579 --> 01:53:05.560]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful, and natural antioxidants found in red wine.
[01:53:05.902 --> 01:53:10.383]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[01:53:10.383 --> 01:53:14.805]  Now, you don't have to drink even a single drop, thanks to NuRev.

[01:54:12.315 --> 01:54:26.747]  We've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, top economist, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, former head of policy, Department of Treasury, joining us to talk about exactly what the Federal Reserve is doing, the audits coming up, the subpoenas.
[01:54:26.747 --> 01:54:30.491]  I want to take a few phone calls in this segment and the next for Bob Chapman.
[01:54:33.232 --> 01:54:37.257]  Before we do that, I want to tell you about a great sponsor we've got.
[01:54:37.257 --> 01:54:39.780]  It's DigiNet Mobile DVR.
[01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:45.506]  They've got a whole bunch of great little pocket cams and pocket pens at incredibly low prices, super high quality.
[01:54:47.073 --> 01:54:51.876]  Again, I want to tell you about D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:54:51.876 --> 01:54:55.159]  One way to make sure you're always safe against unlawful search.
[01:54:55.159 --> 01:54:57.901]  The DigiNet mobile digital video audio recorder.
[01:54:57.901 --> 01:55:01.643]  Video and audio with absolute clarity while being directly hidden in your vehicle.
[01:55:01.643 --> 01:55:04.085]  This goes inside your vehicle and is hidden cameras.
[01:55:04.085 --> 01:55:05.366]  I'm thinking about getting this.
[01:55:05.366 --> 01:55:07.507]  And they've got a bunch of other stuff on the site.
[01:55:07.507 --> 01:55:11.930]  As an unbiased witness, it is always at your side ready to help in any case.
[01:55:12.816 --> 01:55:13.656]  I don't think so.
[01:55:34.935 --> 01:55:36.596]  So to also see people breaking in your car.

[01:55:52.322 --> 01:55:53.503]  You've got to check it out.
[01:55:53.503 --> 01:55:56.204]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot N-E-T.
[01:56:00.148 --> 01:56:04.190]  Did you also know this video recording could be used as solid evidence in court?
[01:56:04.190 --> 01:56:06.451]  And you will not believe the quality and price.
[01:56:06.451 --> 01:56:08.432]  Go to Diginet.net today.
[01:56:08.432 --> 01:56:10.433]  That's Diginet.net today.
[01:56:10.433 --> 01:56:16.256]  All right, let's go ahead and go to some phone calls here for Bob Chapman.
[01:56:16.256 --> 01:56:17.937]  Let's talk to Dwayne in Pennsylvania.
[01:56:17.937 --> 01:56:19.658]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:56:19.658 --> 01:56:20.058]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:20.058 --> 01:56:20.678]  Hi, Bob.
[01:56:20.678 --> 01:56:25.601]  I have a question for something that Bob mentioned a few months back, and that is the percentage of
[01:56:26.584 --> 01:56:28.285]  And those figures vary from different sources.
[01:56:28.285 --> 01:56:29.806]  Some of them have it at 9%, 9.5% and some of them have it at 10%.
[01:56:29.806 --> 01:56:31.287]  So we'll say it's somewhere between 9 and 12%.
[01:56:31.287 --> 01:56:32.168]  It's unbelievable.
[01:56:32.168 --> 01:56:36.971]  It's what's going to happen when we lose our machine tool industry.
[01:56:55.697 --> 01:56:58.481]  Well, I think we're on the verge of doing that now.
[01:56:58.481 --> 01:57:11.438]  And once we lose the machine tool industry, we can no longer manufacture in the future if we want to without bringing machine tool experts in from other countries to reteach
[01:57:12.062 --> 01:57:15.684]  To teach new people to operate those kind of machines.
[01:57:15.684 --> 01:57:17.785]  Yes sir, I have three quick questions.
[01:57:17.785 --> 01:57:19.446]  They're kind of a little bit off topic.
[01:57:39.932 --> 01:57:42.153]  Okay, alright, three quick questions.
[01:57:42.153 --> 01:57:44.833]  Is Microsoft part of the New World Order?
[01:57:44.833 --> 01:57:45.694]  Yes.
[01:57:45.694 --> 01:57:46.834]  Yes.
[01:57:46.834 --> 01:57:53.756]  Okay, so is supporting open source, like Linux, BSD, is that a small way of fighting the New World Order?
[01:57:53.756 --> 01:57:54.196]  Yes.
[01:57:54.196 --> 01:57:55.057]  Yes.
[01:57:55.057 --> 01:57:55.317]  Yes.
[01:57:55.317 --> 01:57:56.117]  Okay, definitely.
[01:57:56.117 --> 01:58:03.299]  Alright, now, is it better, it certainly is better for us to focus on both, but is it better to take back the federal government
[01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:06.481]  Or focus on taking our state governments back?
[01:58:06.481 --> 01:58:07.522]  Both!
[01:58:07.522 --> 01:58:11.064]  But you get more results locally, that's the real gap the enemy hasn't gotten yet.
[01:58:11.064 --> 01:58:12.405]  Bob Chapman?
[01:58:12.405 --> 01:58:13.565]  I agree.
[01:58:13.565 --> 01:58:15.867]  And this sovereign movement especially.
[01:58:15.867 --> 01:58:23.451]  And so, the area that you can work with the most easily is the local level, the state level.
[01:58:25.268 --> 01:58:26.048]  Absolutely, sir.
[01:58:26.048 --> 01:58:27.308]  God bless you, Mike.
[01:58:27.308 --> 01:58:27.769]  Law?
[01:58:27.769 --> 01:58:29.309]  I think I know Law.
[01:58:29.309 --> 01:58:31.449]  That's a big, huge 9-11 truther.
[01:58:31.449 --> 01:58:33.950]  Maybe somebody else named Law is calling from Colorado.
[01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:35.490]  But, uh, yeah.
[01:58:35.490 --> 01:58:42.412]  When they attacked me with my bullhorn, we just put Luke up on his shoulders with the bullhorn and they couldn't reach it.
[01:58:42.412 --> 01:58:45.032]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.498 --> 01:58:59.605]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:58:59.605 --> 01:59:04.769]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:59:04.769 --> 01:59:07.351]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[01:59:07.751 --> 01:59:09.812]  Actually results in disease.

[02:00:30.211 --> 02:00:32.353]  We've got the great Bob Chapman on the line with us.
[02:00:32.353 --> 02:00:34.074]  We're about to go to law in Colorado.
[02:00:34.074 --> 02:00:35.114]  It is the law, I know.
[02:00:35.114 --> 02:00:36.535]  What a great guy.
[02:00:36.535 --> 02:00:47.223]  You can see that footage in the Obama extras where they attack as we're having the bullhorn, and then law shows up with the bullhorn, and Luke Radowsky can put him up on his shoulders, and law's like, 6-6-6-7.
[02:00:47.223 --> 02:00:48.083]  It's hilarious.
[02:00:48.083 --> 02:00:50.305]  They really start throwing fits.
[02:00:50.305 --> 02:00:53.047]  But classic stuff.
[02:00:53.047 --> 02:00:59.191]  But real fast, Bob Chapman, fire out the toll-free number for folks that want to call and get the latest complimentary copy of International Forecaster.

[02:01:22.134 --> 02:01:23.596]  Let's go to Law in Colorado.
[02:01:23.596 --> 02:01:24.757]  Lawyer on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:01:24.757 --> 02:01:25.118]  Go ahead.
[02:01:25.118 --> 02:01:28.461]  Ah, hello Alex, and hello Bob.
[02:01:28.461 --> 02:01:29.743]  Great to finally get on the show.
[02:01:30.773 --> 02:01:32.314]  Really, I didn't have any questions.
[02:01:32.314 --> 02:01:37.997]  I just was wanting to tell you about, I'm not sure if you're aware, but for the first time in U.S.
[02:01:37.997 --> 02:01:45.701]  history here, KBDI Channel 12 actually got pressed for truth on the PBS station here in Denver.
[02:01:45.701 --> 02:01:50.783]  Oh yeah, we actually put links to that up in their fundraising drive.
[02:01:50.783 --> 02:01:53.905]  Yeah, that's PBS that isn't under Rockefeller's control.
[02:01:53.905 --> 02:01:59.608]  And I believe they're the same ones that showed America freedom from fascism, and Franchi was also on their pitching endgame.
[02:02:00.248 --> 02:02:05.372]  So do they air in-game or do they just give it away for donations?
[02:02:05.372 --> 02:02:09.315]  No, they were actually giving it away at a certain level of donation.
[02:02:09.315 --> 02:02:12.557]  We were all pretty amazed about that for sure.
[02:02:12.557 --> 02:02:13.918]  So that was really tremendous.
[02:02:13.918 --> 02:02:17.421]  I really wanted to relate to what you guys were talking about before about how
[02:02:18.141 --> 02:02:19.003]  We're good to go.
[02:02:33.784 --> 02:02:35.725]  And they had a tremendous response.
[02:02:35.725 --> 02:02:42.588]  I mean, they were breaking records in just their first commercial pledge break, so that was really, really telling.
[02:02:42.588 --> 02:02:49.792]  Absolutely, it is telling, and the enemy knows we're the majority, but they know that most people don't know that, so they're desperately trying to make us all look fringe.
[02:02:50.552 --> 02:02:51.132]  I agree completely.
[02:03:17.967 --> 02:03:21.850]  Well Law, I gotta get Colorado Change on in the near future.
[02:03:21.850 --> 02:03:24.332]  All of you guys are just doing such an amazing job.
[02:03:24.332 --> 02:03:26.193]  Fire out the website.
[02:03:26.193 --> 02:03:29.656]  Oh heck yeah, it'd be wearechangecolorado.org actually.
[02:03:29.656 --> 02:03:31.977]  That's where you can check us out and get in touch.
[02:03:31.977 --> 02:03:35.800]  Another point I wanted to make was we did the People's Fair again this weekend.
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:36.721]  We gave away over 1,300 free DVDs.
[02:03:38.852 --> 02:03:40.413]  And I wanted to thank you, Alex.
[02:03:40.413 --> 02:03:44.597]  It's really an honor to be on the Obama Deception DVD.
[02:03:44.597 --> 02:03:45.838]  It's really fantastic.
[02:03:45.838 --> 02:03:53.103]  The MSNBC event there is going to go down in my own personal history as one of the greatest times I've had.
[02:03:53.103 --> 02:04:01.750]  Well, you know, they were laughing when they were punching and hitting me and cut the microphone cord on the bullhorn and attacked me and then attacked our camera guy viciously.
[02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:03.712]  But I just sat there and let him laugh at me.
[02:04:04.412 --> 02:04:09.275]  You guys got there in 15 minutes with more bullhorns and we said, okay, attack us and shut us down.
[02:04:09.275 --> 02:04:11.397]  We'll come back with four bullhorns and shut those down.
[02:04:11.397 --> 02:04:13.939]  We'll come back with eight bullhorns.
[02:04:13.939 --> 02:04:19.503]  But it was so archetypal to have them attack me viciously and then you show up huge, you know, like a...
[02:04:20.443 --> 02:04:34.077]  Uh, NFL, uh, center, uh, but without the big belly, and to sit there with, uh, Luke on the shoulders, it was just so archetypal how they crushed me, and then an even bigger Phoenix rose right out of the ground.
[02:04:34.077 --> 02:04:38.221]  It was, uh, it was really spiritual, so that's on the Obama Deception extras.
[02:04:38.221 --> 02:04:44.026]  Uh, Bob Chapman, great talking to you, hopefully we'll see you here next week if things haven't totally imploded, and Law, good hearing from you.
[02:04:44.867 --> 02:04:45.528]  Thank you.
[02:04:45.528 --> 02:04:46.048]  I'll be there.
[02:04:46.048 --> 02:04:47.469]  Alright, Bob, you're the best.
[02:04:47.469 --> 02:04:48.810]  Lawyer, great as well.
[02:04:48.810 --> 02:04:50.031]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:04:50.031 --> 02:04:52.893]  I've got a lot of calls and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts straight ahead.
[02:04:52.893 --> 02:04:53.674]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:53.674 --> 02:04:56.876]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:56.876 --> 02:04:58.598]  Coming to you via PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:05:00.489 --> 02:05:06.352]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[02:05:06.352 --> 02:05:07.652]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:05:07.652 --> 02:05:11.914]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[02:05:11.914 --> 02:05:13.775]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:05:13.775 --> 02:05:20.098]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[02:05:21.218 --> 02:05:24.101]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[02:05:24.101 --> 02:05:25.842]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[02:05:25.842 --> 02:05:28.845]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[02:05:28.845 --> 02:05:30.566]  And their formula really works.
[02:05:30.566 --> 02:05:33.389]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[02:05:33.389 --> 02:05:34.870]  Try the NutriCafe.
[02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:39.634]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[02:05:39.634 --> 02:05:42.056]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[02:05:42.056 --> 02:05:44.518]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[02:05:44.518 --> 02:05:46.620]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:47.741]  Go to www.
[02:05:49.202 --> 02:05:52.284]  E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com.
[02:05:52.284 --> 02:05:56.947]  That's W-W-W dot E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com.
[02:05:56.947 --> 02:06:00.629]  Or just click on their banner on Infowars.com for special pricing.
[02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:05.592]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:06:06.613 --> 02:06:09.855]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.855 --> 02:06:10.536]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.536 --> 02:06:15.759]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.759 --> 02:06:16.400]  It's true.
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:20.823]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.823 --> 02:06:21.744]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.744 --> 02:06:27.367]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:06:27.367 --> 02:06:28.048]  Number 4.
[02:06:28.048 --> 02:06:30.930]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:06:30.930 --> 02:06:34.592]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:34.592 --> 02:06:34.833]  Number 5.
[02:06:35.453 --> 02:06:39.297]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:39.297 --> 02:06:45.022]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:06:45.022 --> 02:06:49.727]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:49.727 --> 02:06:51.508]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:51.508 --> 02:06:54.071]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:02.270]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:07.012]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:07:07.012 --> 02:07:09.974]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:07:09.974 --> 02:07:13.015]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:07:13.015 --> 02:07:17.738]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:07:17.858 --> 02:07:18.198]  We're good.
[02:07:37.754 --> 02:07:44.021]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:07:44.021 --> 02:07:47.786]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:47.786 --> 02:07:49.067]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:07:49.067 --> 02:07:49.768]  Take action today.
[02:07:49.768 --> 02:07:51.590]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:08:01.724 --> 02:08:04.486]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.486 --> 02:08:07.268]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:28.066 --> 02:08:35.633]  Ladies and gentlemen, until about 45 after or so, we have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on the line with us today.
[02:08:35.633 --> 02:08:45.322]  And Dr. Roberts, of course, was the former editor of the Wall Street Journal, former head of policy, Department of the Treasury, number two there, the father of Reaganomics.
[02:08:45.922 --> 02:08:46.663]  I don't think so.
[02:09:05.342 --> 02:09:06.203]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:09:25.134 --> 02:09:26.495]  You bet.
[02:09:26.495 --> 02:09:27.195]  Break it down.
[02:09:27.195 --> 02:09:38.063]  I mean, there's a lot going on, but what state are we in right now with the White House grabbing industries, telling banks what to do, saying nobody can audit them, they're above the law.
[02:09:38.063 --> 02:09:39.824]  Obama going back on everything he said.
[02:09:39.824 --> 02:09:43.167]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[02:09:43.167 --> 02:09:48.530]  Yes, it looks like pursuit of power has gone to their heads.
[02:09:48.530 --> 02:09:50.952]  I certainly agree.
[02:09:50.952 --> 02:09:53.654]  And I think it's hurting Obama, a lot of his
[02:09:55.039 --> 02:10:05.983]  Fans are disturbed about him and of course the Republicans will turn that to their advantage sooner or later.
[02:10:05.983 --> 02:10:11.365]  And then so we'll be thrown out of the fire back into the frying pan and back and forth.
[02:10:11.365 --> 02:10:15.086]  How does this end when both parties are owned by the same corrupt interest?
[02:10:15.086 --> 02:10:22.249]  And that whorehouse called Washington just eats, drinks and marries, not even caring if the country collapses, they'll just move to Switzerland.
[02:10:22.628 --> 02:10:28.752]  Yeah, it's really kind of like the French government, isn't it, before the French Revolution?
[02:10:28.752 --> 02:10:35.477]  I mean, that's how out of touch both parties are.
[02:10:35.477 --> 02:10:39.640]  I think what may happen, Alex, of course I don't know.
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:41.441]  Nobody can know.
[02:10:41.441 --> 02:10:48.526]  I think what may happen is that just the general overreach of the United States government, the economic
[02:10:49.664 --> 02:11:04.433]  Overreach, you know, the foreign policy, the military, they just overreach in so many places that they get so many problems that they suffer a huge defeat.
[02:11:04.433 --> 02:11:08.295]  I think defeat is what they're headed for.
[02:11:08.295 --> 02:11:15.019]  If we think about the Iraq War and all the trouble and the long, drawn-out process until we finally
[02:11:15.925 --> 02:11:21.386]  Uh, caught on and started paying off the insurgents with money.
[02:11:21.386 --> 02:11:35.510]  If you think about all that trouble, why do they want to get in ten times as much trouble in Pakistan and Afghanistan, much larger, more rugged countries, meaner people?
[02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:38.591]  It doesn't make a great deal of sense.
[02:11:38.591 --> 02:11:43.412]  You would think they would have learned, good gosh, we came close to
[02:11:44.335 --> 02:11:49.998]  Getting our butts kicked in Iraq, what do we want to take even worse risk?
[02:11:49.998 --> 02:12:02.504]  And then if you look at the financial policy and you say, well look, we let the financial gangsters make fools of us and deregulate them and turn them loose.
[02:12:02.504 --> 02:12:08.987]  They've wiped out half of the savings of the American people, people who
[02:12:11.294 --> 02:12:26.379]  Denied themselves the consumption and put away money for their old age, and now the banksters have destroyed half of it, and we let them con us into deregulating them and giving them a free hand to rip people off.
[02:12:26.379 --> 02:12:29.360]  And now, how do we respond to that?
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:32.901]  Well, we give them trillions of dollars!
[02:12:32.901 --> 02:12:40.804]  But we won't do anything for the homeowners, and we'll let the car companies go bankrupt because we want to bust the unions.
[02:12:42.167 --> 02:12:45.648]  We won't let a bank go bankrupt.
[02:12:45.648 --> 02:12:48.668]  And how do they think that plays with people?
[02:12:48.668 --> 02:12:54.530]  I mean, even the brainwashed American public sees through all that.
[02:12:54.530 --> 02:12:58.050]  And then the question is, these deficits.
[02:12:58.050 --> 02:13:04.692]  You know, like, this year the deficit is four or five times bigger than last year.
[02:13:04.692 --> 02:13:08.092]  It just cannot be financed.
[02:13:08.092 --> 02:13:10.733]  So, and next year, the same thing again.
[02:13:12.385 --> 02:13:17.226]  Uh, another two trillion in red ink.
[02:13:17.226 --> 02:13:30.168]  When you have half of your budget in red ink, that's like when you're in a major war, like World War II or something.
[02:13:30.168 --> 02:13:33.229]  And you're in that situation, how do you finance it?
[02:13:33.229 --> 02:13:40.790]  The world hasn't got that money to finance it, and so that financing problem, I think, is going to
[02:13:43.106 --> 02:14:05.250]  Threaten the dollar's role as the reserve currency, and of course, that weakens the power of the United States, because the real power of the country is not based on some kind of inherent right that we have, it's based on the fact that we have the reserve currency and can pay our bills with our own currency.
[02:14:05.250 --> 02:14:12.491]  So if we lose that, we've lost the bulk of our power, and yet they're taking great risk with
[02:14:13.211 --> 02:14:14.352]  We're good to go.
[02:14:43.161 --> 02:14:55.530]  One is another sharp decline in the stock market, in which equity holders flee from stocks for the safety of government bonds.
[02:14:55.530 --> 02:14:59.312]  That's one way they can finance the deficit.
[02:14:59.312 --> 02:15:03.475]  The only other way is to print the money.
[02:15:03.475 --> 02:15:07.758]  And if they print the money, and the world will notice it.
[02:15:07.758 --> 02:15:12.161]  In fact, the Chinese have been complaining for six months or more.
[02:15:13.132 --> 02:15:18.636]  About the possibility that we're going to print the money to finance us.
[02:15:18.636 --> 02:15:21.658]  And they keep complaining in louder and louder voices.
[02:15:21.658 --> 02:15:32.627]  And recently, in Beijing, the audience that the Treasury Secretary Geithner had, laughed at him!
[02:15:32.627 --> 02:15:42.454]  Because he was so stupid, he didn't even understand that he cannot simultaneously tell the Chinese
[02:15:43.587 --> 02:15:50.291]  That he wants a strong dollar, but he wants the Chinese currency to rise.
[02:15:50.291 --> 02:15:52.272]  And that their investments are safe.
[02:15:52.272 --> 02:15:53.873]  Their dollar investments are safe.
[02:15:53.873 --> 02:16:02.417]  Well, obviously, if the Chinese let their currency rise relative to the dollar, their dollar holdings are worth less.
[02:16:02.417 --> 02:16:05.279]  And they're not safe.
[02:16:05.279 --> 02:16:07.740]  They're getting less dollars.
[02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:10.862]  But, Dr. Roberts, I mean, Geithner, that little
[02:16:12.045 --> 02:16:12.765]  I don't know Alex, maybe.
[02:16:12.765 --> 02:16:15.026]  But it's a terrific risk to take.
[02:16:15.026 --> 02:16:15.787]  We're the superpower.
[02:16:15.787 --> 02:16:16.647]  We're the financial superpower.
[02:16:16.647 --> 02:16:16.987]  We rule the world.
[02:16:38.899 --> 02:16:39.220]  I don't think so.
[02:16:44.082 --> 02:16:46.383]  No, I agree, but I think he's so arrogant.
[02:16:46.383 --> 02:16:48.044]  I mean, I think he's so arrogant he thought he'd get away with it.
[02:16:48.044 --> 02:16:58.148]  I agree with you that it's a big risk and that the luster, the aura, the cloak of infallibility of the private Federal Reserve and these bankers and these corporate crooks is starting to fade.
[02:16:58.148 --> 02:16:59.749]  And you're right, that's a danger.
[02:16:59.749 --> 02:17:07.492]  I mean, it's good to have their power fade, but it's also in a way bad because when they fall over like a giant oak tree on us, it could crush us.
[02:17:07.492 --> 02:17:09.213]  But I guess it's better than being their slaves.
[02:17:09.213 --> 02:17:12.735]  But the question I've got for you then on this issue is, where does it go?
[02:17:13.975 --> 02:17:14.276]  I don't
[02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:33.361]  Well, so far, Alex, it's going just as I predicted.
[02:17:33.361 --> 02:17:34.262]  I said that
[02:17:57.389 --> 02:18:12.299]  When they announced they were going to buy a trillion dollars of debt, $300 billion in Treasury bonds, $700 billion in mortgage bonds, I said, well, that's monetization, and that's going to drive up the interest rates, drive down the bond prices.
[02:18:12.299 --> 02:18:15.442]  And lo and behold, exactly what happened.
[02:18:15.442 --> 02:18:22.587]  Interest rates have risen on the Treasuries, and the prices, which is the reverse of that, have gone down.
[02:18:22.587 --> 02:18:23.467]  And it's harder to get a home.
[02:18:26.570 --> 02:18:40.620]  What Geithner thought, or Bernanke, of all of them, thought, was that, hey, we can drive down interest rates by buying these bonds.
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:44.103]  But instead, they've gone up.
[02:18:44.103 --> 02:18:55.611]  And so I would imagine, as the Fed buys up more of the bonds they're issuing to finance this year's budget deficit, the interest rates are going to go
[02:18:56.914 --> 02:18:57.715]  Rise higher.
[02:18:57.715 --> 02:19:04.860]  And so, then, they're faced with, what do we do about the real estate crisis?
[02:19:04.860 --> 02:19:06.361]  Their rates are rising.
[02:19:06.361 --> 02:19:07.642]  How does that help?
[02:19:07.642 --> 02:19:08.343]  It doesn't help.
[02:19:08.343 --> 02:19:09.304]  See what I'm saying?
[02:19:09.304 --> 02:19:10.825]  It hurts.
[02:19:10.825 --> 02:19:22.114]  And so, I think they've, that's what I say, that they're creating more problems than they can manage.
[02:19:22.114 --> 02:19:23.535]  And they will be devoured
[02:19:27.181 --> 02:19:40.432]  Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts got a break again.
[02:19:40.432 --> 02:19:42.674]  Come back and continue explaining that to people.
[02:19:42.674 --> 02:19:47.538]  Yeah, I mean, they supposedly all these trillions in TARP money, but now it's harder to get a mortgage.
[02:19:47.538 --> 02:19:52.723]  They're using the money to buy up other banks and insurance companies and having the government come in and order banks
[02:19:54.451 --> 02:19:56.593]  In their activities.
[02:19:56.593 --> 02:19:59.796]  We'll talk about the whole Bank of America scandal when we get back with Dr. Paul Greg Roberts.
[02:19:59.796 --> 02:20:00.737]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:00.737 --> 02:20:03.100]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:12.189]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[02:20:12.589 --> 02:20:20.618]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[02:20:20.618 --> 02:20:26.565]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[02:20:28.007 --> 02:20:29.989]  506-5904.
[02:20:29.989 --> 02:20:35.054]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[02:20:35.054 --> 02:20:39.940]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:48.569]  American Tax Settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back, and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[02:20:49.009 --> 02:20:56.354]  If you owe 10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[02:20:56.354 --> 02:20:59.416]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[02:20:59.416 --> 02:21:01.097]  Call today.
[02:21:01.097 --> 02:21:06.901]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:06.901 --> 02:21:13.926]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:14.466 --> 02:21:20.991]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:20.991 --> 02:21:23.033]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:23.033 --> 02:21:25.535]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:25.535 --> 02:21:36.504]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.117 --> 02:21:38.778]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:38.778 --> 02:21:40.640]  It's about a one world government.
[02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:47.545]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:47.545 --> 02:21:55.811]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:55.811 --> 02:21:57.392]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:57.392 --> 02:21:58.573]  The people strike back.
[02:22:00.595 --> 02:22:02.916]  Today, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:02.916 --> 02:22:03.196]  June 12, 2009.
[02:22:03.196 --> 02:22:04.176]  Gold open this morning at $9.4710.
[02:22:04.176 --> 02:22:07.998]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7420, $2.8710 for a half ounce, and $2.4355 for a quarter ounce.
[02:22:07.998 --> 02:22:08.518]  That's $9.7420, $4.8710, and $2.4355.
[02:22:19.597 --> 02:22:33.223]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[02:22:33.223 --> 02:22:34.463]  Is this capitalism?
[02:22:34.463 --> 02:22:42.067]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:42.067 --> 02:22:43.147]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:43.147 --> 02:22:47.289]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[02:22:47.509 --> 02:22:48.750]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:53.414]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[02:22:53.414 --> 02:22:53.874]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.874 --> 02:22:56.817]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.817 --> 02:23:05.163]  Newsflash!
[02:23:05.163 --> 02:23:07.565]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[02:23:07.565 --> 02:23:11.889]  The dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[02:23:13.437 --> 02:23:17.399]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[02:23:17.399 --> 02:23:22.021]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[02:23:22.021 --> 02:23:29.024]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy food.
[02:23:29.024 --> 02:23:37.367]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced price.
[02:23:37.367 --> 02:23:41.189]  So you and your family have a long-term food solution.
[02:23:42.674 --> 02:23:46.455]  The choice between starvation and freedom is made by you.
[02:23:46.455 --> 02:23:47.636]  Right now.
[02:23:47.636 --> 02:23:50.137]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[02:23:50.137 --> 02:23:52.458]  That's survivalistseeds.com.
[02:23:52.458 --> 02:23:55.859]  Because you are almost out of time.
[02:23:55.859 --> 02:23:57.100]  survivalistseeds.com
[02:24:17.580 --> 02:24:20.142]  I want to get back into the economy in the next segment.
[02:24:20.142 --> 02:24:24.885]  Final segment with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:24:24.885 --> 02:24:27.987]  But right now I want to shift gears on one of the other big subjects he talks about.
[02:24:27.987 --> 02:24:30.108]  The police state.
[02:24:30.108 --> 02:24:31.449]  And again, he's a real conservative.
[02:24:32.657 --> 02:24:42.747]  Father of Reaganomics, but we've had police shooting people in handcuffs in the back and then trying to claim they attacked them and then hidden camera stuff gets released and they just shoot the guy for no reason.
[02:24:42.747 --> 02:24:45.710]  We have police shooting people's little dogs all over the news.
[02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:50.635]  When they come to your house now and the chihuahua barks, they kill it, saying it was a threat to the officers, literally.
[02:24:52.034 --> 02:24:54.735]  And we've got the military and the police training everywhere.
[02:24:54.735 --> 02:25:10.442]  The TSA announced in the Associated Press yesterday that in Boston and New York, everyone will be searched and everyone, I don't know how they're going to do this, but it says everyone, will be put through those body scanners, you know, that are called, you know, the naked scanners in the news that show your body.
[02:25:10.442 --> 02:25:16.785]  And that the FBI wants them to set up TSA-style security at America's biggest malls.
[02:25:18.337 --> 02:25:26.082]  And your book, The Tyranny of Good Intentions, I don't think it really is even good intentions, but it tells all these amazing stories and how the Bill of Rights is being abolished.
[02:25:26.082 --> 02:25:28.364]  The second edition's out right now, brand new.
[02:25:28.364 --> 02:25:30.365]  We got it up on screen for folks.
[02:25:30.365 --> 02:25:44.855]  And in the few minutes we got left in this little short segment, I mean, it looks like it's premeditated here as they implode the economy and they've set up NORTHCOM now and they say they're going to use army troops on us, but I don't see that working as society continues to implode.
[02:25:44.855 --> 02:25:45.556]  Can you speak to that?
[02:25:48.392 --> 02:25:58.018]  I mean, first of all, this couldn't possibly have anything to do with terrorists, because they haven't bombed any subways or any shopping centers.
[02:25:58.018 --> 02:26:16.150]  And as far as we can tell, the only terrorists that have been uncovered in the United States are people that the FBI stirred up and led and talked into doing things with promises of large sums of money.
[02:26:18.755 --> 02:26:39.852]  Since there aren't any terrorists, and the FBI has to go out and find really incompetent and somewhat unintelligent people to bribe with money to say that they want to go be a terrorist, then we're not under any attack.
[02:26:39.852 --> 02:26:45.877]  So there's no reason for any of this body scanning, other than to further
[02:26:48.573 --> 02:26:48.793]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:18.911 --> 02:27:21.433]  Have anybody a danger to the other passengers?
[02:27:21.433 --> 02:27:27.317]  Well, of course, going to malls is not that kind of argument at all.
[02:27:27.317 --> 02:27:30.400]  There's nobody up in the air.
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:40.608]  There's no vulnerabilities other than what you would find from being mugged or hit by a car or anything else when you go out.
[02:27:40.608 --> 02:27:47.653]  And so, there's no special vulnerabilities, and so it has nothing to do with anything
[02:27:48.559 --> 02:27:55.523]  Except training us to be good little citizens of a police state.
[02:27:55.523 --> 02:28:02.888]  Oh, yes, but the next thing they will do then is say we have to have implants so they'll know where we are at all times.
[02:28:02.888 --> 02:28:04.129]  They're already proposing that.
[02:28:04.129 --> 02:28:08.091]  The Mexican Attorney General made his employees take them three years ago.
[02:28:08.091 --> 02:28:17.637]  Well, I don't know what's behind all this other than just bureaucracy running amok.
[02:28:18.959 --> 02:28:31.169]  We can look for conspiracies, but the trouble I always have with all these conspiracies is it assumes that they're so much smarter than they ever show any signs of being.
[02:28:31.169 --> 02:28:32.990]  I don't think they're even that smart.
[02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:35.192]  They have the instinct of control freaks.
[02:28:35.192 --> 02:28:40.776]  Okay, that's, they just, it's a bureaucracy that always wants more power.
[02:28:40.776 --> 02:28:42.217]  Well, of course.
[02:28:42.217 --> 02:28:47.782]  So if technology presents new opportunities, then they seize it.
[02:28:48.914 --> 02:29:00.419]  And they'd use it, but... I suppose people... If the American people were clued in, which unfortunately not very many of them are, they all need to listen to your show.
[02:29:00.419 --> 02:29:08.342]  But if they were clued in, then they could just boycott the malls.
[02:29:08.342 --> 02:29:10.723]  And then the malls... And the subways and the rest of it.
[02:29:10.723 --> 02:29:11.323]  And the subways.
[02:29:11.323 --> 02:29:18.186]  You don't have to use... Subways is kind of harder, I guess, for New Yorkers, because they've got to be able to get around a city that's
[02:29:19.286 --> 02:29:22.614]  But you could certainly boycott the malls.
[02:29:24.011 --> 02:29:31.294]  And then that would contribute to the commercial real estate collapse and people would probably make the government back off.
[02:29:31.294 --> 02:29:32.994]  Well, as you know, sir, they've done studies.
[02:29:32.994 --> 02:29:38.476]  A lot of people don't fly now because they don't like having the illegal aliens that run security jab them and scream at them.
[02:29:38.476 --> 02:29:49.440]  I want to ask you about the MIAC and DHS reports we broke a few months ago, listing conservatives and people as terrorists and the whole in the Fed movement where you see that going with auditing the Fed.
[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:50.421]  Stay with us, sir.
[02:29:50.421 --> 02:29:50.981]  Final segment.
[02:29:51.181 --> 02:29:55.105]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.105 --> 02:29:57.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:00.625 --> 02:31:09.708]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[02:31:09.708 --> 02:31:14.890]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[02:31:14.890 --> 02:31:17.451]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[02:31:17.871 --> 02:31:19.912]  Actually results in disease.

[02:32:06.322 --> 02:32:07.623]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:32:07.623 --> 02:32:11.586]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[02:32:11.886 --> 02:32:13.747]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:32:13.747 --> 02:32:21.209]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.

[02:33:04.138 --> 02:33:10.223]  Well, here it's fine If you've got the time
[02:33:19.555 --> 02:33:34.280]  You know, we broke the MIAC report, the DHS report, and many others before that.
[02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:36.760]  We broke previous reports put out by the Feds.
[02:33:36.760 --> 02:33:38.561]  People wouldn't believe us.
[02:33:38.561 --> 02:33:47.884]  We broke that they had InfraGard here before it was in the mainstream news, getting 56,000 executives with shoot-to-kill orders during martial law ready to watch their employees.
[02:33:48.644 --> 02:33:49.725]  Now it's public.
[02:33:49.725 --> 02:33:56.810]  The clergy response teams, now over 40,000 of those we know of.
[02:33:56.810 --> 02:34:04.716]  Then it came on the news years after we had the secret documents saying, oh yes, the clergy's preparing their flocks to hand in their guns, go to FEMA camps.
[02:34:04.716 --> 02:34:05.697]  That's mainstream news.
[02:34:05.697 --> 02:34:07.198]  You can't make this up.
[02:34:07.198 --> 02:34:08.879]  I can't believe it myself.
[02:34:08.879 --> 02:34:10.360]  It's so crazy.
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:14.864]  And then now the DHS report comes out and says Ron Paul supporters, people that want to audit the Fed,
[02:34:16.625 --> 02:34:18.827]  We got the documents from the Army leaked to us.
[02:34:18.827 --> 02:34:32.216]  The Army admitted to the news that they were spying on Ron Paul in Houston and me in Dallas protesting the Fed last year and listed us as potential terrorists and told the military in plain clothes, Army intelligence, don't let them know you're military.
[02:34:32.216 --> 02:34:33.557]  They may kill you.
[02:34:33.557 --> 02:34:35.259]  That's posted on InfoWars.com.
[02:34:35.819 --> 02:34:40.821]  I mean, this country's just got secret police all over it, and now they want to have secret arrests.
[02:34:40.821 --> 02:34:49.126]  They've said no more Bill of Rights, basically no more Fourth Amendment, warrantless wiretappings, A-OK, the courts have ruled, the Congress has passed a law.
[02:34:49.126 --> 02:34:55.529]  And then Dr. Roberts, I mean, you've been saying for years here on the air that they're gearing up to make the American people the enemy.
[02:34:55.529 --> 02:34:59.491]  Now they say in the DHS report the number one potential threat is veterans?
[02:35:00.777 --> 02:35:03.920]  And gun owners and Ron Paul supporters.
[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:05.120]  Give me your take.
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:06.822]  Yeah, and Bob Barr supporters.
[02:35:06.822 --> 02:35:07.422]  And Bob Barr.
[02:35:07.422 --> 02:35:08.283]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:35:08.283 --> 02:35:10.064]  Your take on that?
[02:35:10.064 --> 02:35:17.250]  Well, I think, you know, it shows the brown shirt mentality that I've been writing about for several years.
[02:35:17.250 --> 02:35:30.460]  It shows how they've taken patriotism of people who are not particularly bright and turned it into a brown shirt mentality where they're prepared now to turn on anyone who could be demonized.
[02:35:31.667 --> 02:35:40.269]  And so, the government is obviously going to demonize people who are associated with the defense of civil liberties.
[02:35:40.269 --> 02:35:42.230]  And that's who's being demonized.
[02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:45.791]  I mean, there you have Bob Barr and Ron Paul.
[02:35:45.791 --> 02:35:57.194]  And so, and it'll be the ACLU, and it'll be libertarians in general, and anybody who says,
[02:35:58.775 --> 02:36:08.742]  We have these rights and it's illegal under statutory law and also unconstitutional for you and the government to violate these rights.
[02:36:08.742 --> 02:36:10.803]  That is the enemy.
[02:36:10.803 --> 02:36:27.635]  So anyone who is opposed to unbridled state arbitrary power is an enemy of America and they will soon be called terrorists or
[02:36:28.599 --> 02:36:32.000]  Or insurgents or something.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:33.821]  And so that's what's happening.
[02:36:33.821 --> 02:36:36.082]  You're right to call attention to it.
[02:36:36.082 --> 02:36:38.503]  And that's exactly what's happened.
[02:36:38.503 --> 02:36:45.626]  The Founding Fathers would all be arrested as dangerous to state power.
[02:36:45.626 --> 02:36:48.927]  So I think that's what we are faced with.
[02:36:48.927 --> 02:36:57.191]  And one check to it, of course, is an armed population, if they're prepared to use the
[02:36:58.564 --> 02:37:07.086]  But of course the kind of guns we have are not very powerful compared to what the state can wield.
[02:37:07.086 --> 02:37:27.371]  And the other check to this development that we're discussing, I call it the Brown Shirt Movement, is that the government overreaches, we talked about earlier, and finds its power shaken, suffers some big defeats and humiliations, and that this breaks the whole.
[02:37:28.806 --> 02:37:33.489]  That it's acquiring over people's minds and bodies.
[02:37:33.489 --> 02:37:45.837]  So, other than that, I don't think there's going to be any kind of a political movement or reformers in Washington that are going to be able to roll this back.
[02:37:45.837 --> 02:37:49.459]  The courts might slow them down.
[02:37:49.459 --> 02:37:57.664]  There are still enough people on the federal bench that weren't put there by the Federalist Society who
[02:37:58.430 --> 02:38:08.133]  Who still believe in a balance of powers and civil liberties, and the courts may slow this process down.
[02:38:08.133 --> 02:38:20.576]  And I hope they do, because the more it's slowed down, the more likely the power of the federal government is going to crack from its hubris and arrogance and overextension.
[02:38:20.576 --> 02:38:25.618]  I don't think the entire world is prepared to put up with the United States.
[02:38:26.772 --> 02:38:27.252]  We're good to go.
[02:38:57.495 --> 02:38:57.855]  We're good to go.
[02:39:27.458 --> 02:39:33.655]  Uh, imprison us all in some way or the other by... So how long are they going to put up with it?
[02:39:33.655 --> 02:39:34.357]  You mean the foreigners?
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:42.165]  Well, I mean, here, how long can the corruption just burgeon and spill out like a plague of locusts eating our flesh to the bone?
[02:39:42.165 --> 02:39:56.056]  I mean, how long can the arrogance and the hubris and the just open tyranny and open torture and open secret arrest and open wars and open lies, I mean, how long can evil be called good and good called evil?
[02:39:56.056 --> 02:39:57.577]  How long will the world put up with this?
[02:39:57.577 --> 02:40:00.699]  Where do you see this developing into now?
[02:40:00.699 --> 02:40:02.821]  Well, I think that if it's
[02:40:03.702 --> 02:40:09.005]  That the American people are unlikely to call a halt to it.
[02:40:09.005 --> 02:40:13.848]  If the halt is called, it'll be from foreigners.
[02:40:13.848 --> 02:40:19.351]  Our so-called NATO puppet states will cease to be puppet states.
[02:40:19.351 --> 02:40:23.514]  They won't want the association.
[02:40:23.514 --> 02:40:27.016]  The Russians and Chinese are already, you know, digging in their heels.
[02:40:29.486 --> 02:40:37.071]  At some point, the instability that we cause in the Middle East will threaten our puppets there.
[02:40:37.071 --> 02:40:43.056]  And to save themselves, they may simply switch over.
[02:40:43.056 --> 02:40:55.084]  I don't think the United States has the power required for its aggressive program of hegemony at home and abroad.
[02:40:55.084 --> 02:40:56.225]  I just don't think it
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:01.441]  It does, but I do agree with you that that's their intention.
[02:41:01.441 --> 02:41:07.383]  Their intention is to tyrannize us and the rest of the world.
[02:41:07.383 --> 02:41:19.828]  But I don't think, and I of course may be wrong, that they have the financial and moral and leadership and military power to achieve that.
[02:41:19.828 --> 02:41:26.930]  And when you think about them occupying the United States when they can occupy Baghdad,
[02:41:28.496 --> 02:41:33.180]  Dr. Roberts, you were in Washington, you were in the White House, you were at the highest levels of government.
[02:41:33.180 --> 02:41:52.815]  When I watch Glenn Beck posing as one of us, but saying, arrest Ron Paul supporters, use the army on us, that this horrible Bruner guy, or whatever his name is at the Jewish Center, that he's a Ron Paul supporter, and he has CIA guys on, saying that militia people work with Al Qaeda.
[02:41:53.997 --> 02:41:54.957]  They know they're lying.
[02:41:54.957 --> 02:41:57.039]  They know it's bull.
[02:41:57.039 --> 02:41:58.080]  And you look in their eyes.
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:41:58.981]  Beck's enjoying it.
[02:41:58.981 --> 02:42:01.984]  The CIA guy looked like he was losing his soul while he was doing it.
[02:42:01.984 --> 02:42:08.570]  But, I mean, how do they get CIA guys to really try to terrorize the U.S.?
[02:42:08.570 --> 02:42:10.953]  I guess they just work for offshore corporate interests and that's their job.
[02:42:10.953 --> 02:42:13.255]  I want you to comment on that in closing.
[02:42:13.255 --> 02:42:14.236]  And then one other point.
[02:42:14.756 --> 02:42:15.936]  Alright, I'll say two things briefly.
[02:42:15.936 --> 02:42:17.877]  One, having been in the Reagan administration,
[02:42:38.010 --> 02:42:47.796]  I don't think anybody there, certainly not Reagan, none of us, could possibly have conceived of where the United States would be a quarter of a century later.
[02:42:47.796 --> 02:42:53.439]  This type of behavior, I don't think we could even have conceived of it.
[02:42:53.439 --> 02:43:00.343]  We would have thought it was some kind of science fiction film or something.
[02:43:00.343 --> 02:43:03.725]  I never saw any of those kinds of attentions.
[02:43:03.725 --> 02:43:05.266]  It wasn't anything that
[02:43:05.726 --> 02:43:15.531]  If anybody was concerned with it, it was going on, it certainly wasn't anything that ever reached my ears or awareness.
[02:43:15.531 --> 02:43:21.175]  And I don't think it had anything whatsoever to do with Reagan or his intention to what he was trying to do.
[02:43:21.175 --> 02:43:32.761]  So there's been that big of a flip-flop and change in Washington culture, it's just... In a quarter of a century, something has happened that none of us could have even dreamed of.
[02:43:33.277 --> 02:43:37.959]  Now, the question on auditing the Fed, it must be audited.
[02:43:37.959 --> 02:43:46.902]  The Fed doesn't want to be audited because they're allowed to use their profits for their own expenses.
[02:43:46.902 --> 02:43:51.363]  And then whatever's left, they are supposed to turn into the Treasury.
[02:43:51.363 --> 02:43:56.325]  So they probably don't want anyone to learn about their expenses.
[02:43:56.325 --> 02:43:59.106]  They probably live a grand life, you know, they have that
[02:43:59.887 --> 02:44:06.489]  Uh, play something Jackson Hole, where they go every year for their conferences.
[02:44:06.489 --> 02:44:09.769]  It's just, you know, it's a grand life.
[02:44:09.769 --> 02:44:13.250]  And they probably don't want anybody to see the expenses.
[02:44:13.250 --> 02:44:25.693]  Of course, there may be other reasons they don't want to be audited, but I don't think a democracy, or any kind of government, can afford to have elements of it that aren't audited.
[02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:41.574]  Now, when the General Accounting Office has tried to audit various parts of the United States government, such as the Pentagon or any cabinet in a lot of ways, they've often said that the information is so bad we can't do an audit.
[02:44:41.574 --> 02:44:51.837]  And so what we have is a situation where the United States government puts private firms in prison for having bad accounting practices, but itself has no accounting practices that could even be audited.
[02:44:53.132 --> 02:44:53.632]  Exactly.
[02:44:53.632 --> 02:45:03.536]  Well, the Pentagon, in hearings four years ago, said they had two plus trillion missing, and I've got Rumsfeld on video saying, I don't know where it is and we're not going to ever tell you.
[02:45:03.536 --> 02:45:08.857]  And he brings up Dr. Chu, the head of financing, and he says, we're not going to tell you.
[02:45:08.857 --> 02:45:13.419]  It's just like Bernanke to Senator Sanders going, I'm not going to tell you where the money went.
[02:45:13.419 --> 02:45:14.359]  That's right.
[02:45:14.359 --> 02:45:19.781]  If they know, they're not going to tell you, and they may not know, or they may only know in part.
[02:45:19.781 --> 02:45:21.962]  And they use a lot of it to buy foreign governments.
[02:45:22.762 --> 02:45:32.585]  You know, I've said this before, when I was, my PhD dissertation chairman was the second most powerful man in the Pentagon during the Nixon years, and he invited me to his office once.
[02:45:32.585 --> 02:45:38.427]  He wanted me to do something for the government.
[02:45:38.427 --> 02:45:45.069]  And I asked him, I said, how does the United States get all these foreign countries to do what they want all the time?
[02:45:45.069 --> 02:45:46.029]  How do they get them to do it?
[02:45:46.029 --> 02:45:46.649]  He said, money.
[02:45:47.341 --> 02:45:48.883]  I said, oh, you mean foreign aid?
[02:45:48.883 --> 02:45:49.644]  We give them foreign aid?
[02:45:49.644 --> 02:45:52.187]  He said, no, no, we just buy their governments.
[02:45:52.187 --> 02:45:56.011]  We just give the leaders money.
[02:45:56.011 --> 02:45:57.492]  And he wasn't proud of it.
[02:45:57.492 --> 02:46:00.656]  He was just telling me a fact.
[02:46:00.656 --> 02:46:03.099]  That was just the facts on the ground.
[02:46:03.099 --> 02:46:04.200]  And I think that's true.
[02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:06.923]  We own the European governments.
[02:46:06.923 --> 02:46:07.584]  We give them money.
[02:46:08.001 --> 02:46:09.723]  Let me ask you this question then.
[02:46:09.723 --> 02:46:22.195]  What is going to happen that when the dollar finally dies or finally falls apart, or is no longer completely a monopolar system, for a season, a few years, they'll still be the big military.
[02:46:22.195 --> 02:46:25.418]  We'll be the ones to pay it.
[02:46:25.418 --> 02:46:26.359]  Well, I understand, but...
[02:46:28.829 --> 02:46:36.313]  So will they use the military right when it implodes, as the Rand Corporation says they may, to start World War III as a cover, or will it just implode?
[02:46:36.313 --> 02:46:36.773]  I don't know.
[02:46:36.773 --> 02:46:39.175]  I think it'll just implode, because there's no money.
[02:46:39.175 --> 02:46:43.877]  See, we're import-dependent, and we can't pay for the imports.
[02:46:43.877 --> 02:46:45.278]  We can't feed people, clothe them.
[02:46:45.278 --> 02:46:46.679]  There's no gasoline.
[02:46:46.679 --> 02:46:48.300]  You can't make deliveries.
[02:46:48.300 --> 02:46:50.001]  And they won't be able to buy off these governments.
[02:46:50.001 --> 02:46:52.082]  Well, I mean, even if we lose the World Reserve... That's the main point.
[02:46:52.082 --> 02:46:53.022]  That's the main point.
[02:46:53.022 --> 02:46:54.143]  See, this happened to the Romans.
[02:46:54.143 --> 02:46:58.185]  You know, when the silver denarius, the main monetary unit,
[02:46:58.823 --> 02:47:02.525]  It got so inflated that it was nothing but lead.
[02:47:02.525 --> 02:47:04.206]  It turned essentially into lead.
[02:47:04.206 --> 02:47:05.988]  The silver coin became lead.
[02:47:05.988 --> 02:47:07.609]  They couldn't buy off the barbarians.
[02:47:07.609 --> 02:47:12.312]  They didn't want the damn lead.
[02:47:12.312 --> 02:47:13.552]  It's the same thing again.
[02:47:13.552 --> 02:47:21.297]  So our paper is being destroyed by overprinting or whatever, overcreation.
[02:47:21.297 --> 02:47:28.302]  And when the thing goes and the Chinese keep pointing that it's going to go, it's going to go, they're worried.
[02:47:29.104 --> 02:47:31.225]  Because they're holding a trillion dollars.
[02:47:31.225 --> 02:47:34.566]  And when it goes, you can't buy people anymore.
[02:47:34.566 --> 02:47:35.786]  You can't buy them.
[02:47:35.786 --> 02:47:38.587]  When it goes, how fast will it go?
[02:47:38.587 --> 02:47:47.310]  I think if it starts, it'll be very fast because everybody, the stocks that the world holds of dollars are immense.
[02:47:47.310 --> 02:47:52.732]  You know, there's a trillion in Japan, a trillion in China, who knows how much OPEC has, probably another trillion.
[02:47:53.464 --> 02:47:54.546]  We're good to go.
[02:48:06.509 --> 02:48:11.911]  And so, they're not going to all sit there and say, oh, we can't panic because we'll drive the price down.
[02:48:11.911 --> 02:48:14.052]  Have you ever seen that happen in the stock market?
[02:48:14.052 --> 02:48:14.432]  No.
[02:48:14.432 --> 02:48:14.812]  No.
[02:48:14.812 --> 02:48:16.292]  Well, it ain't going to happen with a dollar.
[02:48:16.292 --> 02:48:24.455]  And all those idiots, those financial gurus, who say, oh, the Chinese will no do blah blah, they'll lose dollars.
[02:48:24.455 --> 02:48:25.296]  They'll value the dollars.
[02:48:25.296 --> 02:48:28.497]  Well, why don't they say that about stocks?
[02:48:28.497 --> 02:48:29.837]  Well, they don't know what they're talking about.
[02:48:29.837 --> 02:48:31.998]  They're just spinning.
[02:48:31.998 --> 02:48:35.139]  You know, everything you hear is a lie, just like you say.
[02:48:35.885 --> 02:48:51.311]  Well, in closing, it was not barbarians that laughed at Geithner when he told them everything was going to be just dandy and that they could have their money rise and that their dollar investments wouldn't fall, which is ridiculous.
[02:48:51.311 --> 02:49:00.235]  Obviously, keeping their yawn low has helped keep the dollars high so they can keep selling their goods, for those that don't understand that basic equation.
[02:49:00.235 --> 02:49:02.255]  But in our final equation here,
[02:49:04.369 --> 02:49:09.771]  This is just like with the Romans in 300, 350, 410 when Alaric sat Rome.
[02:49:09.771 --> 02:49:11.392]  You're right.
[02:49:11.392 --> 02:49:19.336]  The barbarians began laughing when they said we'll give you lead as money and then they knew real value and it looks like that's starting to happen.
[02:49:19.336 --> 02:49:22.337]  You know, like the Chinese were laughing at Geithner offering them lead.
[02:49:22.337 --> 02:49:26.339]  I think that's a good analogy, Alex.
[02:49:26.339 --> 02:49:27.879]  You summed it up.
[02:49:27.879 --> 02:49:29.220]  The Chinese don't want our lead.
[02:49:30.538 --> 02:49:39.401]  Alright, well what, a lot of smart money, people that I've seen me write in the past are saying they think things are really going to, fireworks in October, or who knows?
[02:49:39.401 --> 02:49:46.944]  Alex, just keep in mind, it wasn't that long ago that gold was $35 an ounce.
[02:49:46.944 --> 02:49:50.205]  What is it today?
[02:49:50.205 --> 02:49:50.785]  $970.
[02:49:50.785 --> 02:49:53.786]  What are people predicting in the next year?
[02:49:55.310 --> 02:49:57.472]  Two thousand, yeah.
[02:49:57.472 --> 02:50:08.400]  Now, from 1971, when it was still $35 an ounce, to today, has been the superpower time of the United States.
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:09.761]  We've been the superpower.
[02:50:09.761 --> 02:50:10.661]  We've prevailed.
[02:50:10.661 --> 02:50:12.343]  The Soviet Union's gone.
[02:50:12.343 --> 02:50:14.324]  We've had our way with the world.
[02:50:14.324 --> 02:50:22.550]  So, during the period of our greatest power, the dollar relationship from gold has changed from $35 an ounce to $1,000 an ounce.
[02:50:25.539 --> 02:50:31.807]  If you can have that kind of collapse during your prime, what can you have during your fall?
[02:50:32.952 --> 02:50:36.633]  It'll all accelerate the tyranny of good intentions.
[02:50:36.633 --> 02:50:37.974]  Second edition out.
[02:50:37.974 --> 02:50:39.775]  Just Google Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:50:39.775 --> 02:50:40.675]  Read all his great columns.
[02:50:40.675 --> 02:50:44.256]  We link to him over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:50:44.256 --> 02:50:46.317]  Dr. Roberts, always informative, having you on.
[02:50:46.317 --> 02:50:47.877]  Thank you for spending so much time with us.
[02:50:47.877 --> 02:50:48.818]  Have a great weekend.
[02:50:48.818 --> 02:50:49.798]  I enjoy being with you.
[02:50:49.798 --> 02:50:50.619]  Thank you.
[02:50:50.619 --> 02:50:51.019]  God bless you.
[02:50:51.019 --> 02:50:51.319]  Take care.
[02:50:51.319 --> 02:50:51.659]  There he goes.
[02:50:51.659 --> 02:50:57.041]  I'm going to come back, hit some more news, and Daniel Cengiada, star of Rescue Me and a lot more is coming up.
[02:50:57.041 --> 02:50:58.601]  Talk about 9-11 truth.
[02:50:58.601 --> 02:50:59.202]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:59.202 --> 02:50:59.542]  Stay with us.
[02:51:02.466 --> 02:51:03.587]  Spring is here.
[02:51:03.587 --> 02:51:04.547]  Growing season.
[02:51:04.547 --> 02:51:06.748]  The economy is not getting any better.
[02:51:06.748 --> 02:51:08.449]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:51:08.449 --> 02:51:09.430]  Think about it.
[02:51:09.430 --> 02:51:13.532]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:51:13.532 --> 02:51:17.214]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:51:17.214 --> 02:51:20.056]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[02:51:20.056 --> 02:51:31.902]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:51:32.162 --> 02:51:32.602]  Let's do it!
[02:52:00.816 --> 02:52:02.317]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:52:02.317 --> 02:52:07.701]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[02:52:07.701 --> 02:52:10.103]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[02:52:10.103 --> 02:52:19.189]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[02:52:19.189 --> 02:52:19.609]  We're good.
[02:52:49.189 --> 02:52:49.409]  We're good.
[02:53:01.042 --> 02:53:03.024]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:53:03.024 --> 02:53:09.989]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:53:09.989 --> 02:53:18.396]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:18.396 --> 02:53:24.121]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:53:24.281 --> 02:53:26.121]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:53:26.121 --> 02:53:28.302]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:53:28.302 --> 02:53:32.843]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:32.843 --> 02:53:35.064]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:53:35.064 --> 02:53:43.166]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:53:43.166 --> 02:53:43.426]  We're good.
[02:54:25.509 --> 02:54:31.674]  Some of the new bomber music I've been adding.
[02:54:31.674 --> 02:54:35.717]  Oh, Hooge likes that.
[02:54:35.717 --> 02:54:39.640]  I can do the, uh, happy dance right now for everybody.
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:47.707]  It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from going under.
[02:54:47.707 --> 02:54:52.050]  It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from going under.
[02:54:59.082 --> 02:55:05.925]  You know, I've always had a pretty good attitude, but things have gotten really stressful as we get more and more attention and, you know, fighting the New World Order.
[02:55:05.925 --> 02:55:12.047]  But I've just learned just trust in God and make sure I get my exercise every day, and that really boosts me and gets me positive.
[02:55:12.047 --> 02:55:14.728]  I'll tell you what else makes me really positive, and I'm going to cover all this news.
[02:55:14.728 --> 02:55:16.369]  Daniel Shinjata coming up and a lot more.
[02:55:18.697 --> 02:55:19.158]  I'll tell you.
[02:55:19.158 --> 02:55:21.862]  I'm going to play this Keith Oberman.
[02:55:21.862 --> 02:55:29.132]  Oberman now, and I respect him for reporting on Dick Cheney trying to stage terror attacks after New Yorker Magazine confirmed it.
[02:55:29.132 --> 02:55:30.474]  We'd already warned of that months before.
[02:55:30.474 --> 02:55:31.555]  We had intel from the Navy.
[02:55:31.555 --> 02:55:34.079]  That's why Fox Fallon, the Admiral, quit.
[02:55:34.079 --> 02:55:34.780]  Had a sent come.
[02:55:37.466 --> 02:55:45.292]  I mean, now Oberman's trying to tie Ron Paul in with the horrible attacker of the Jewish Center.
[02:55:45.292 --> 02:55:47.554]  I mean, it's just, they're desperate folks.
[02:55:47.554 --> 02:55:51.777]  The Federal Reserve needs to do this, and it creates anti-Semitism.
[02:55:51.777 --> 02:55:56.921]  Most people talking about the Federal Reserve and the bankers and Bank of America and corruption, they're not thinking Jews.
[02:55:59.386 --> 02:56:03.149]  And the media makes it about Jews and actually creates the anti-Semitism.
[02:56:03.149 --> 02:56:04.550]  That's what multiculturalism is.
[02:56:04.550 --> 02:56:11.294]  They make everything a racial issue, everything a religious issue, everything getting each other in our throats.
[02:56:11.294 --> 02:56:16.298]  Because there happens to be some Jews in banking.
[02:56:16.298 --> 02:56:17.839]  You know, there's some Chinese people in there too.
[02:56:17.839 --> 02:56:19.120]  We don't say it's a China, you know.
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:22.382]  The media is injecting this into the debate.
[02:56:24.389 --> 02:56:29.311]  So we'll talk about that a lot more coming up and a host of other issues dealing with 9-11 truth.
[02:56:29.311 --> 02:56:36.453]  But I do have to tell you folks that we have reached $240,000 and some change.
[02:56:36.453 --> 02:56:42.755]  And so if you go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or InfoWars.com and link through to it, you can see that's happening.
[02:56:42.755 --> 02:56:45.075]  And hey, I say let's run it through the weekend.
[02:56:45.075 --> 02:56:46.456]  Let's break last year's record.
[02:56:47.401 --> 02:56:49.143]  Plus, we have that big donation from Darrell Rundis.
[02:56:49.143 --> 02:56:52.826]  We want to push this way past that so it really does break last year's record.
[02:56:52.826 --> 02:56:53.987]  You can also call.
[02:56:53.987 --> 02:56:55.389]  I haven't given this number out today.
[02:56:55.389 --> 02:56:57.431]  This is our one time a year for a couple days.
[02:56:57.431 --> 02:57:04.698]  We do the InfoWars Money Bomb second annual to expand what we're doing, put out more films, buy more equipment, get more reporters.
[02:57:04.698 --> 02:57:09.583]  Thank you for all your support, buying the books and videos and PrisonPlanet.tv memberships and supporting our sponsors.
[02:57:09.583 --> 02:57:10.423]  I salute all of you.
[02:57:11.397 --> 02:57:17.141]  You can call toll-free, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[02:57:17.141 --> 02:57:21.104]  Think of all the guests and all the activists and all the groups that we bring on here.
[02:57:21.104 --> 02:57:23.045]  Think of the platform we give to people.
[02:57:23.045 --> 02:57:26.547]  Think of how we're helping network and expand everything.
[02:57:26.547 --> 02:57:29.569]  It's so exciting.
[02:57:29.569 --> 02:57:34.673]  But I do want to thank all of you that have given in the 2009 money bomb.
[02:57:34.673 --> 02:57:38.656]  It's clear we're going to make our goal of $250,000.
[02:57:38.656 --> 02:57:40.117]  But let's go above and beyond that.
[02:57:41.138 --> 02:57:46.282]  And 100% of the money bomb will be allocated directly to expanding this facility.
[02:57:46.282 --> 02:57:48.624]  Expanding, paying to put the TV show on air.
[02:57:48.624 --> 02:57:51.026]  We're going to have to pay for it on Dish Network and DirecTV.
[02:57:51.026 --> 02:57:52.467]  And boy, they're not friendly when we call them.
[02:57:52.467 --> 02:57:53.648]  They know who we are.
[02:57:53.648 --> 02:57:55.949]  But we're going to try to get through that barrier.
[02:57:55.949 --> 02:58:00.293]  Last year, we moved over here, built these studios, expanded, got the operation running.
[02:58:01.033 --> 02:58:02.833]  While we were doing all our other jobs at the same time.
[02:58:02.833 --> 02:58:04.534]  I'm really proud of my team.
[02:58:04.534 --> 02:58:06.454]  We're going to go forward to the next level now.
[02:58:06.454 --> 02:58:12.555]  Signing the lease for the building next door to us today to really kick it up a notch into another gear.
[02:58:12.555 --> 02:58:16.516]  In the face of the depression and the recession and all the problems, we are not retreating.
[02:58:16.516 --> 02:58:19.837]  We are advancing against the globalists and having great effects.
[02:58:19.837 --> 02:58:25.298]  And all of us should be savoring the fact that the private Federal Reserve is now on the defensive instead of all this arrogance
[02:58:25.778 --> 02:58:26.899]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:26.899 --> 02:58:28.199]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.831 --> 02:58:56.052]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:58:56.052 --> 02:59:00.074]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.074 --> 02:59:05.975]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.975 --> 02:59:11.037]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.037 --> 02:59:11.537]  Number three,
[02:59:11.957 --> 02:59:18.242]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:59:18.242 --> 02:59:21.144]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:59:21.144 --> 02:59:25.668]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:25.668 --> 02:59:29.271]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:59:29.511 --> 02:59:35.233]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:59:35.233 --> 02:59:39.935]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:39.935 --> 02:59:41.716]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.716 --> 02:59:44.297]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[02:59:44.297 --> 02:59:53.721]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[02:59:53.721 --> 02:59:56.102]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.102 --> 02:59:58.843]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:06.005 --> 03:00:20.174]  Well, to the next 30 minutes, Daniel Sonjata is our guest, and he's a prominent 9-11 truther.
[03:00:20.174 --> 03:00:24.537]  A very gentlemanly, intelligent, great soul.
[03:00:24.537 --> 03:00:25.657]  Old soul, as they say.
[03:00:27.333 --> 03:00:29.575]  And, uh, that's the best way of describing him.
[03:00:29.575 --> 03:00:40.185]  And he came out to the demonstration when I got arrested a few years ago, about before 9-11, protesting the cover-up of the fact that that was an inside job, uh, there at, uh, Fox Studios.
[03:00:41.810 --> 03:00:46.853]  And he is also in the new New World Order film that came out on IFC.
[03:00:46.853 --> 03:00:49.775]  He was caught on tape there with us when I was being arrested.
[03:00:49.775 --> 03:00:53.096]  And of course he's the star of Rescue Me, a lot of other movies and TV shows.
[03:00:53.096 --> 03:01:00.461]  He had a lot of courage to go public and risk his whole Hollywood slash TV career doing what he did, just like Charlie Sheen and others did.
[03:01:01.341 --> 03:01:07.967]  And then even to fight to even have the show cover the topic, and I think they did it in a pretty fair fashion.
[03:01:07.967 --> 03:01:15.573]  Obviously, it couldn't just be our side, you know, for it to be mainstream TV, but I'm just so proud of what he's done, and he's a great asset to humanity and liberty.
[03:01:15.573 --> 03:01:19.836]  On top of that, it's great to have him on now.
[03:01:19.836 --> 03:01:25.961]  We set him up like a couple days ago, before this horrible guy went in and shot this poor security guard, supposedly.
[03:01:25.961 --> 03:01:29.845]  It looks like a black op to me, at this Holocaust Memorial Museum.
[03:01:31.311 --> 03:01:35.416]  Perfect timing when we're trying to audit the Fed for that to happen.
[03:01:35.416 --> 03:01:37.138]  And now they're trying to demonize Ron Paul.
[03:01:37.138 --> 03:01:42.004]  They're trying to demonize 9-11 truthers, saying this guy was a hero to them with no proof.
[03:01:42.004 --> 03:01:43.085]  Glenn Beck just says that.
[03:01:43.085 --> 03:01:45.167]  So we'll talk about it all in the next 30 minutes.
[03:01:45.167 --> 03:01:47.590]  Daniel Sanjata, it's great to have you here with us.
[03:01:47.590 --> 03:01:48.451]  Oh, as always, Alex.
[03:01:48.451 --> 03:01:49.452]  It's great to be with you.
[03:01:49.452 --> 03:01:50.634]  Thank you so much for having me, man.
[03:01:51.107 --> 03:01:51.848]  Thanks for spending time.
[03:01:51.848 --> 03:01:56.091]  We've got a few minutes before the break and a long segment coming up, but first off, tell me about Rescue Me.
[03:01:56.091 --> 03:01:58.573]  You really couldn't come on the air when that was all building up.
[03:01:58.573 --> 03:02:01.875]  You wanted to just let those programs air.
[03:02:01.875 --> 03:02:03.876]  It got a lot of international attention.
[03:02:03.876 --> 03:02:05.598]  You made some great points in the Rescue Me.
[03:02:05.598 --> 03:02:14.004]  We're going to play a clip of that coming up, but tell me about the process of getting that on the TV show and behind the scenes, and then what happened on air.
[03:02:14.557 --> 03:02:17.619]  Well, the process was just, you know, talking about it a lot on set.
[03:02:17.619 --> 03:02:31.649]  You know, I think that eventually, although Peter, Dennis, FX, Sony, I don't think that any of them are signing on to my perspective necessarily, but I think that they saw that there was some dramatic mileage that could be gotten out of it.
[03:02:31.649 --> 03:02:39.815]  I think that they saw the no-brainer that if there was a platform on mainstream television on which to address the subject that 9-11 was
[03:02:40.743 --> 03:02:47.548]  Was the appropriate venue, or rather that Rescue Me was the appropriate venue, based on Post 9-11 New York City Firefighters.
[03:02:47.548 --> 03:02:52.891]  So, you know, in the final analysis, I was very happy with the way that they treated the subject in general.
[03:02:52.891 --> 03:02:57.114]  I mean, it came out better than I thought, you know, than I had hoped.
[03:02:57.114 --> 03:03:03.118]  I guess I had wished also that there had been a little bit more of a reaction, either positive or negative.
[03:03:03.118 --> 03:03:04.359]  It just kind of seemed like it erred.
[03:03:05.071 --> 03:03:11.800]  Not that much was said about it other than the hit piece that came out on Fox & Friends with Greg Gutfield shooting his mouth off.
[03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:16.767]  But yeah, there just wasn't as much of a reaction in general as I was kind of hoping that it would provoke.
[03:03:16.767 --> 03:03:18.629]  I was hoping it would stimulate some conversation.
[03:03:19.798 --> 03:03:20.319]  Absolutely true.
[03:03:20.319 --> 03:03:21.280]  Yes, absolutely true.
[03:03:36.618 --> 03:03:38.879]  You know, I mean, at least it aired.
[03:03:38.879 --> 03:03:46.242]  I don't think that it could only have been good in terms of, you know, I'll tell you, I'm sorry I'm jumping around, but I'll tell you what my favorite scene was.
[03:03:46.242 --> 03:03:54.106]  It was really great to be able to do those monologues where I got to, you know, list, you know, you know, let's say our side of the case.
[03:03:54.106 --> 03:04:02.790]  But my favorite 9-11 scene that they aired in Rescue Me was where Michael Lombardi's character, the probie, he and I are walking down the street and he's just telling me where his
[03:04:03.365 --> 03:04:15.192]  You know, he was saying, you know, if you're telling me that, you know, that the bad guys are here in our own government, it's just kind of like too much for me to process.
[03:04:15.192 --> 03:04:25.038]  He was basically giving a voice to the cognitive dissonance that's responsible for a lot of people just dismissing the possibility that 9-11 could have been an inside job without ever even looking at the evidence.
[03:04:25.038 --> 03:04:26.999]  And so I really appreciated that particular
[03:04:28.835 --> 03:04:29.436]  Absolutely.
[03:04:29.436 --> 03:04:34.179]  Later, we'll play one of those clips here on air with Daniel Sinjada.
[03:04:34.179 --> 03:04:41.384]  Daniel, again, I'm not saying this because I'm trying to butter Daniel up.
[03:04:41.384 --> 03:04:43.265]  He really needs to be honored.
[03:04:43.265 --> 03:04:51.130]  You know, somebody who's got a great career, really breaking out, and he does something that they try to blackball you for, that is the ultimate courage.
[03:04:51.130 --> 03:04:57.455]  They say, psychologically, it's easier to charge a machine gun nest to do something that is seen as socially unpopular.
[03:04:57.875 --> 03:04:59.976]  But it's only socially unpopular with the elite.
[03:05:18.328 --> 03:05:18.588]  We're good.

[03:07:01.664 --> 03:07:05.348]  Going into battle, you would want all the ammunition for your gun you could get.
[03:07:05.348 --> 03:07:08.891]  But presently, ammunition and reloading supplies are in shortage.
[03:07:08.891 --> 03:07:10.252]  Now think about this.
[03:07:10.252 --> 03:07:16.458]  If you have no food, all the guns and ammunition will be useless against the population control breadlines.
[03:07:16.458 --> 03:07:19.541]  In the present battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[03:07:21.698 --> 03:07:21.938]  I think?
[03:07:42.059 --> 03:07:42.379]  Big Brother!
[03:08:07.339 --> 03:08:09.101]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.101 --> 03:08:10.864]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:10.864 --> 03:08:12.446]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.446 --> 03:08:14.007]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.007 --> 03:08:18.193]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.193 --> 03:08:20.536]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[03:08:21.420 --> 03:08:23.021]  Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.021 --> 03:08:24.883]  We get too reliant on YouTube.
[03:08:24.883 --> 03:08:29.226]  That's why we have PrisonPlanet.tv and it's all streamed in higher quality there, but that's just my videos.
[03:08:29.226 --> 03:08:36.091]  We have the video of Dennis Leary, some 9-11 intruders that heard Daniel and others talking about the upcoming episodes.
[03:08:36.091 --> 03:08:37.912]  They come up and ask him politely.
[03:08:37.912 --> 03:08:39.253]  He goes, how do you know that?
[03:08:39.253 --> 03:08:39.813]  Who are you?
[03:08:39.813 --> 03:08:41.715]  Who are you with that has them thrown out?
[03:08:41.715 --> 03:08:42.475]  We can't play it.
[03:08:42.475 --> 03:08:43.996]  YouTube is down.
[03:08:43.996 --> 03:08:45.618]  Not my videos, YouTube itself.
[03:08:46.178 --> 03:08:51.281]  I'm glad that he was still part of the show even though it had the 9-11 truth stuff in it, but I'm surprised watching this response from him
[03:09:10.871 --> 03:09:18.335]  Very aggressive, nice people just asking questions at a book signing, that he was even part of something that brought up 9-11 Truth.
[03:09:18.335 --> 03:09:34.743]  Yeah, I don't know, I mean, you know, Dennis gets approached by a lot of people, and I think that he, you know, I'm sure he's well aware of the controversial nature of the subject matter, you know, so to speak, that it was going to provoke, probably anticipating that it would provoke an emotional response from both sides of the fence, and maybe he just was
[03:09:35.430 --> 03:09:36.831]  Wary of being ambushed.
[03:09:36.831 --> 03:09:45.534]  You know, he might not have known with cameras on you and somebody asking you a question if he was being confronted or if he was just asking to, you know, being tacitly asked for his opinion.
[03:09:45.534 --> 03:09:48.316]  Oh, he might have thought it was TMZ or something.
[03:09:48.316 --> 03:09:48.976]  You never know.
[03:09:48.976 --> 03:09:50.997]  You never know what went through his mind.
[03:09:50.997 --> 03:10:02.062]  I mean, again, I have to give, I can only give Dennis, you know, credit and Peter Toland credit and FX credit for, you know, for allowing the subject matter on the show and for treating it with a relative amount of fairness.
[03:10:02.992 --> 03:10:07.756]  I don't think at the end of it that Franco, my character, was left wearing a dunce cap.
[03:10:07.756 --> 03:10:25.812]  I think that they just kind of, you know, let everyone... They showed all the different emotional responses from the guys in the house to Sheila, the other character named Sheila, who expresses her, you know, dissatisfaction with my opinion, claiming that Franco is turning, you know, turning her husband's death into a hobby.
[03:10:25.812 --> 03:10:30.736]  But in general, I think they just kind of let the audience decide for themselves, and that's laudable.
[03:10:32.469 --> 03:10:33.890]  Well, it certainly is.
[03:10:33.890 --> 03:10:40.412]  For those that haven't seen the show Rescue Me, break down what was discussed in that episode.
[03:10:40.412 --> 03:10:44.774]  Well, it was a subplot that stretched over about five episodes.
[03:10:44.774 --> 03:10:54.998]  The way it started was a French journalist comes to the firehouse and she wants to interview the guys about their experiences on 9-11 and their feelings about the day.
[03:10:54.998 --> 03:11:01.001]  And so in a series of vignettes with her interviewing each of us, I'm sorry,
[03:11:01.573 --> 03:11:04.635]  With her interviewing each of us individually.
[03:11:04.635 --> 03:11:11.539]  When she gets to my character, of course, I launch into this two-minute monologue about how 9-11 was an inside job and the reasons why.
[03:11:11.539 --> 03:11:17.984]  And then over the course of subsequent episodes, you see the responses from different characters in the firehouse.
[03:11:17.984 --> 03:11:19.044]  Some of them are violent.
[03:11:19.044 --> 03:11:26.149]  I almost get into a physical confrontation with one character, Michael Lombardi's character, the probie, in the firehouse kitchen.
[03:11:26.149 --> 03:11:31.012]  And then we have kind of a reconciliation scene later on where he explains to me why he felt the way he felt
[03:11:31.773 --> 03:11:37.417]  So, you know, they just allowed a lot of different perspectives to be communicated.
[03:11:37.417 --> 03:11:41.800]  It would have been nice to have one person, one character on the show be like, yeah, I agree with Franco.
[03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:44.381]  But, again, just the fact that they allowed me.
[03:11:44.381 --> 03:11:53.827]  Yeah, I mean, let me say it's a distortion, but again, even allowing it on, though, and allowing one view is better than most, so I'm not trying to just attack here.
[03:11:53.827 --> 03:11:58.070]  But I've been to New York, and many of the firefighters know it's an inside job.
[03:11:58.070 --> 03:11:58.951]  They come up and thank us.
[03:11:59.511 --> 03:12:00.171]  Shake our hands.
[03:12:00.171 --> 03:12:03.874]  I want to ask you about that, but then there's all the videos of firefighters going.
[03:12:03.874 --> 03:12:05.194]  It was like it was a foundry.
[03:12:05.194 --> 03:12:06.755]  Lava flowing.
[03:12:06.755 --> 03:12:08.957]  You know, things were melting.
[03:12:08.957 --> 03:12:10.738]  The police saying, get back, they're going to blow up Building 7.
[03:12:10.738 --> 03:12:12.038]  So can you speak to that?
[03:12:12.038 --> 03:12:13.759]  I mean, you live in New York.
[03:12:13.759 --> 03:12:15.340]  You know these people.
[03:12:15.340 --> 03:12:16.781]  You're around firefighters.
[03:12:16.781 --> 03:12:19.223]  You're the star of a show about firefighters.
[03:12:19.223 --> 03:12:23.065]  What percentage would you say of them will tell you, oh yeah, Daniel, I agree with you?
[03:12:23.647 --> 03:12:43.456]  Well, I don't know about, I could not hazard a guess at the percentage of the total population of the FDNY because I don't know the ball, but I'll say out of the firefighters that I know, I'd say about 60% of them are leaning towards us, leaning towards our take on things, that it was an inside job, that something's fishy, that we need to have a new investigation.
[03:12:43.456 --> 03:12:52.360]  Maybe 20% of the remaining 40 are undecided, and then maybe 20% are violently opposed to the idea, but I think more from the perspective of
[03:12:53.004 --> 03:12:59.869]  You know, just not being able to fathom the depth of that kind of betrayal.
[03:12:59.869 --> 03:13:06.695]  But in general, I know lots of firefighters that feel exactly the way you feel, that feel exactly the way I feel.
[03:13:06.695 --> 03:13:08.957]  So I don't really know what to say about that.
[03:13:10.370 --> 03:13:10.950]  Well, that's one.
[03:13:10.950 --> 03:13:17.235]  Talking to Bill Doyle three years ago, he said about half or more of the families believe it's an inside job than he does.
[03:13:17.235 --> 03:13:18.776]  He lost his son, Joey.
[03:13:18.776 --> 03:13:20.417]  I've since talked to some of those groups.
[03:13:20.417 --> 03:13:22.439]  Three years later, they say, oh, it's basically 80% of us now.
[03:13:24.344 --> 03:13:27.565]  And, uh, but the media keeps this distortion going.
[03:13:27.565 --> 03:13:30.187]  The families don't like 9-11 truth.
[03:13:30.187 --> 03:13:35.109]  The families are upset with us when conservatively more than half agree with us.
[03:13:35.109 --> 03:13:35.889]  Right, right.
[03:13:35.889 --> 03:13:42.292]  I mean, you know, oh, you only have to look at it, you know, at a couple documentaries or do a couple searches on YouTube when it's working.
[03:13:42.292 --> 03:13:47.414]  And you can see the dissatisfaction of the families who are attending the 9-11 Commission hearings.
[03:13:47.414 --> 03:13:51.896]  I mean, they were, how many times were they interrupted by the victim's family members themselves?
[03:13:52.316 --> 03:13:59.341]  Screaming and yelling in anger and frustration because their questions were not only not being answered, but were being completely sidestepped.
[03:13:59.341 --> 03:14:08.868]  You know, I mean, it's clear and obvious that when somebody says you're insulting the memories of those who died and you're causing pain to the victim's family by asking for the truth.
[03:14:09.338 --> 03:14:11.060]  That's a logical fallacy.
[03:14:11.060 --> 03:14:13.662]  That is clearly wrong.
[03:14:13.662 --> 03:14:19.167]  Yeah, they're using the grief of the families and the dead as a shield against us for asking real questions.
[03:14:19.167 --> 03:14:19.428]  Yes.
[03:14:19.428 --> 03:14:21.590]  So they're abusing the dead.
[03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:22.130]  That's true.
[03:14:22.130 --> 03:14:22.531]  That's true.
[03:14:22.531 --> 03:14:29.157]  Not only are they disrespecting the dead, they are supporting those who, at this point still to this day, have gotten away with mass murder.
[03:14:29.157 --> 03:14:32.440]  So they should really think twice about using that excuse.
[03:14:34.761 --> 03:14:43.324]  And these killers are still on the loose as well and planning to stage more events, make no mistake, but the fact that we've been exposing them kind of takes that false flag tool away.
[03:14:43.324 --> 03:14:56.129]  What did you think when New Yorker magazine, Cy Hirsch, and then even Keith Olbermann came out and admitted that Dick Cheney was planning to stage terror attacks on our ships, to blame it on Iran, with U.S.
[03:14:56.129 --> 03:15:02.992]  patrol boats painted up like Iranians, and then they tried to have that staged event with fake radio chatter saying we blow you up in one minute.
[03:15:03.925 --> 03:15:05.486]  And I said that was staged at the time.
[03:15:05.486 --> 03:15:07.068]  Then it came out, it was staged.
[03:15:07.068 --> 03:15:08.970]  And then it comes out, they ordered the torture.
[03:15:08.970 --> 03:15:10.551]  I mean, these really are war criminals.
[03:15:10.551 --> 03:15:11.892]  These really are bad guys.
[03:15:11.892 --> 03:15:13.754]  I mean, this is on record.
[03:15:13.754 --> 03:15:16.096]  They've staged so much terror in the past.
[03:15:16.096 --> 03:15:20.019]  How can people not understand that it's normal to point the finger at them?
[03:15:20.019 --> 03:15:23.602]  Not just because of their history or the evidence, but because of the motive.
[03:15:23.602 --> 03:15:24.243]  Sure.
[03:15:24.243 --> 03:15:24.844]  Absolutely.
[03:15:24.844 --> 03:15:28.607]  I mean, only they stood to gain from, you know, from all of these atrocities.
[03:15:28.607 --> 03:15:30.969]  You know, it's Kibona who has benefited.
[03:15:32.091 --> 03:15:39.033]  In the case of 9-11, it certainly wasn't the 19 people who supposedly died in carrying out the attack.
[03:15:39.033 --> 03:15:43.075]  It certainly hasn't been Osama Bin Laden.
[03:15:43.075 --> 03:15:45.155]  Arguably, Halliburton has certainly benefited.
[03:15:45.155 --> 03:15:47.876]  Dick Cheney has certainly benefited.
[03:15:47.876 --> 03:15:52.558]  Other military contractors, energy corporations, the list goes on.
[03:15:52.558 --> 03:15:55.178]  If you follow the money, it's clear who has benefited.
[03:15:55.178 --> 03:15:57.339]  Given the fact that they announced their agenda before the day,
[03:16:00.856 --> 03:16:10.743]  And then that agenda has been prosecuted every day since, and they've been invoking 9-11 and its victims as justification for, you know, everything that they've done here and everything that we've been doing abroad.
[03:16:10.743 --> 03:16:12.344]  I mean, it's quite clear.
[03:16:12.344 --> 03:16:21.570]  I mean, I don't understand where we, where this bottomless well of, you know, benefit of the doubt, where this comes from and when does it finally run out?
[03:16:21.570 --> 03:16:26.393]  I mean, a government that lies about air quality and exposes people to toxic dust
[03:16:26.869 --> 03:16:30.290]  Intentionally, in order to reopen Wall Street.
[03:16:30.290 --> 03:16:41.872]  A government that, you know, legalizes torture, that manufactures legal opinions in order to justify circumventing the Constitution so that they can torture people.
[03:16:41.872 --> 03:16:44.533]  A government that illegally wiretaps and look on Olbermann.
[03:16:44.533 --> 03:16:53.415]  You had Russell Tice go on there about three months ago and tell Olbermann to his face that the NSA was collecting information, specifically collecting information on intellectuals and journalists.
[03:16:54.222 --> 03:16:57.444]  Uh, and you see, you see Olbermann's face go white there for a second.
[03:16:57.444 --> 03:16:58.485]  And Congress!
[03:16:58.485 --> 03:16:59.265]  And Congress.
[03:16:59.265 --> 03:17:00.366]  I mean, like, what more?
[03:17:00.366 --> 03:17:18.457]  I mean, with all of these damning, you know, realities, why, where is the... I don't understand when, when is the wall of cognitive dissonance finally going to break and people just accept the fact, uh, or at least entertain the very serious possibility and look at the evidence of 9-11 being an inside job and all these other things that you're talking about.
[03:17:18.457 --> 03:17:21.679]  I mean, and in this day and time, there's just so much going on, Alex.
[03:17:21.679 --> 03:17:22.679]  My head swirls.
[03:17:22.679 --> 03:17:23.660]  I sometimes cannot
[03:17:24.062 --> 03:17:28.866]  Sometimes for a couple weeks I literally just have to totally tune out because I feel like it's just too much.
[03:17:28.866 --> 03:17:31.027]  I can't, you know, continue with my day.
[03:17:31.027 --> 03:17:38.452]  I can't continue just living life normally because I'm so caught up in all these tectonic events that seem to just come one right after the other.
[03:17:38.452 --> 03:17:39.353]  It's the economy.
[03:17:39.353 --> 03:17:42.515]  It's pipe bombs being detonated in New Jersey.
[03:17:42.515 --> 03:17:48.640]  It's, you know, the massacre at the Jewish Museum or this unfortunate shooting of the security guard at the Jewish Museum.
[03:17:49.557 --> 03:17:58.052]  Glenn Beck shooting his mouth off and trying to make these links between 9-11 truth and this psycho who committed this crazy act the other day.
[03:17:58.052 --> 03:18:01.277]  I mean, it's just so much and it's endless.
[03:18:01.277 --> 03:18:01.678]  Just endless.
[03:18:02.389 --> 03:18:03.750]  And it's always right on time.
[03:18:03.750 --> 03:18:14.701]  You know, this Brun guy, Von Brun, was in federal custody for six years and has classic Southern Poverty Law Center fingerprints, not exactly ADL.
[03:18:14.701 --> 03:18:21.327]  I mean, it was Southern Poverty Law Center and he classified FBI documents running the Elohim City white supremacist compound that McVeigh came out of.
[03:18:22.248 --> 03:18:35.598]  And it's the same with all these, quote, black Muslim groups that turn out to be black Christian street kids who they pay money to just dress in camo and they give them a warehouse and then even mainstream news has to admit time and time again that it's totally made up.
[03:18:35.598 --> 03:18:36.839]  Wow.
[03:18:36.839 --> 03:18:39.201]  Or fake Klan groups in Dallas.
[03:18:39.201 --> 03:18:42.783]  I mean, led by the FBI, they're going to blow things up.
[03:18:42.783 --> 03:18:48.267]  And right on time as the Federal Reserve is about to be audited, that is so exciting and
[03:18:49.966 --> 03:18:54.690]  But we've got to know that the elite are going to come after those of us that are fighting them, but we don't have a choice.
[03:18:54.690 --> 03:19:02.236]  But I sense in my gut, Daniel Sanjada, because of your courage and millions of other people's courage, that the momentum is shifting.
[03:19:02.236 --> 03:19:09.842]  We're not winning yet, but we're beginning to gain on them, and the arrogance is draining out of these corrupt people.
[03:19:09.842 --> 03:19:10.662]  Well, it didn't.
[03:19:10.662 --> 03:19:12.784]  I mean, you know, I'm sure you've seen.
[03:19:12.784 --> 03:19:13.344]  I know you've seen.
[03:19:13.344 --> 03:19:16.567]  As a matter of fact, you responded to it already, thoroughly.
[03:19:17.584 --> 03:19:25.414]  Uh, when Glenn, in that clip with Glenn Beck and that, I guess that CIA veteran, I don't know who the other, you know who the quote-unquote expert was that he was talking to.
[03:19:25.414 --> 03:19:28.378]  Yeah, it was all a bunch of spooks and think tanks.
[03:19:28.378 --> 03:19:29.920]  It was all intelligence operatives.
[03:19:29.920 --> 03:19:31.242]  Okay, well, you know...
[03:19:32.143 --> 03:19:34.865]  It just smelled of desperation.
[03:19:34.865 --> 03:19:36.566]  I hear the music, so we'll come back to that.
[03:19:36.566 --> 03:19:37.066]  Exactly.
[03:19:37.066 --> 03:19:37.606]  No, you're right.
[03:19:37.606 --> 03:19:40.288]  I mean, they were just... And then you look at the CIA guy.
[03:19:40.288 --> 03:19:48.292]  Beck's such an egomaniac with narcissism that he was enjoying it, but the other spooks were, yeah, the American people of Al-Qaeda, yeah.
[03:19:48.292 --> 03:19:52.415]  I mean, they just looked like they could be blown over by
[03:19:53.729 --> 03:19:54.830]  You know, by a five-year-old.
[03:19:54.830 --> 03:19:56.871]  I mean, it was just unbelievable.
[03:19:56.871 --> 03:19:57.651]  I agree with you.
[03:19:57.651 --> 03:19:58.012]  Stay there.
[03:19:58.012 --> 03:19:59.913]  Daniel Sanjada is our guest.
[03:19:59.913 --> 03:20:01.234]  Final segment straight ahead.
[03:20:01.234 --> 03:20:02.494]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:20:02.494 --> 03:20:08.078]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:20:08.078 --> 03:20:13.101]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:20:13.101 --> 03:20:13.581]  It's true.
[03:20:13.581 --> 03:20:18.684]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:20:18.684 --> 03:20:23.367]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:20:23.885 --> 03:20:31.007]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[03:20:31.007 --> 03:20:32.128]  And here's the best part.
[03:20:32.128 --> 03:20:35.269]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:20:35.269 --> 03:20:38.810]  You actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:20:38.810 --> 03:20:41.991]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:20:41.991 --> 03:20:45.092]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:20:45.092 --> 03:20:45.312]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:20:45.312 --> 03:20:45.592]  Remember,
[03:20:53.939 --> 03:20:57.862]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:20:57.862 --> 03:21:01.646]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:21:01.646 --> 03:21:04.208]  In the new world orders war against humanity.
[03:21:04.838 --> 03:21:07.679]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:07.679 --> 03:21:13.561]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:13.561 --> 03:21:20.063]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.063 --> 03:21:22.024]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.024 --> 03:21:24.485]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:24.485 --> 03:21:34.228]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[03:21:34.693 --> 03:21:37.676]  That's fascist.
[03:21:37.676 --> 03:21:39.338]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.338 --> 03:21:41.199]  It's about a one world government.
[03:21:41.199 --> 03:21:48.126]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:21:56.394 --> 03:21:57.956]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:57.956 --> 03:21:59.157]  The people strike back.
[03:22:02.216 --> 03:22:04.558]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[03:22:04.558 --> 03:22:10.803]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?
[03:22:10.803 --> 03:22:14.946]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of The International Forecaster.

[03:23:04.289 --> 03:23:04.950]  We're good to go!
[03:23:27.679 --> 03:23:27.939]  We're good.
[03:23:39.358 --> 03:23:42.940]  Don't risk facing shipping bottlenecks and possible shortages.

[03:23:48.383 --> 03:23:50.344]  You can't buy Hazurid in stores.

[03:23:53.185 --> 03:23:53.385]  That's 800-675-0323.
[03:23:53.385 --> 03:23:54.566]  They don't want to see us do the
[03:24:17.333 --> 03:24:25.086]  Oh, I can't start playing that song without hearing the rest of it.
[03:24:25.086 --> 03:24:26.448]  I'm gonna come in with that next break.
[03:24:34.346 --> 03:24:40.571]  We're going to finish up with Daniel Senjata and then he says he'll come back in the next month for a full hour and take your calls.
[03:24:40.571 --> 03:24:42.072]  They've got some family stuff coming up today.
[03:24:42.072 --> 03:24:48.618]  Daniel, the time we have left, you were saying, and I jumped in and started seconding you, you were saying that it seemed like desperation.
[03:24:48.618 --> 03:24:49.138]  Exactly.
[03:24:49.138 --> 03:24:57.325]  It was like insecure and panicked and they knew they were doing something dirty, trying to say that this guy was a hero of 9-11 Truth, but with no source.
[03:24:57.665 --> 03:24:58.665]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:24:58.665 --> 03:25:01.626]  I guess that's the only other point I wanted to make is, based on what?
[03:25:01.626 --> 03:25:06.267]  Because he gives this brief caveat, he's like, that's what the evidence points to now.
[03:25:06.267 --> 03:25:07.848]  It's early, we can't confirm this.
[03:25:07.848 --> 03:25:22.292]  Just like with the FEMA camp, he can neither confirm nor deny at the end of the day, but with this particular thing, you would think if he's going to open his mouth and say something like that and link a notoriously non-violent movement like 9-11 Truth with something as despicable as what happened at that museum that day.
[03:25:23.050 --> 03:25:24.591]  Uh, I think you better have a source.
[03:25:24.591 --> 03:25:48.799]  You better have a reason for saying something like that, and I just hope that everybody listening to the show will, uh, will just assault, uh, Glenn Beck's email and telephone non-stop until he issues some type of an apology, because just like with the Geraldo Rivera thing, uh, trying to link us to the bombing in Times Square, I mean, this is just, it's so, it just smacks of such desperation, it's so pathetic, and it's just so, you could even tell in their body language that they knew that they were lying.
[03:25:49.665 --> 03:25:52.108]  Glenn is just a despicable character.
[03:25:52.108 --> 03:25:53.570]  I hate to speak badly of anyone.
[03:26:05.240 --> 03:26:10.143]  But then he says, in new senates, this guy was a hero to 9-11 Truth.
[03:26:10.143 --> 03:26:19.129]  I mean, 9-11 Truth is very diverse, obviously, but I would call it more classical, liberal, progressive, overall, than I would call it conservative.
[03:26:19.129 --> 03:26:20.830]  But I mean, you know, it's every stripe.
[03:26:20.830 --> 03:26:23.332]  But it decries racism and things like that.
[03:26:23.332 --> 03:26:24.212]  Sure.
[03:26:24.212 --> 03:26:28.615]  I mean, who from the 9-11 Truth community has been advocating or calling for violence?
[03:26:28.615 --> 03:26:29.375]  No one.
[03:26:29.375 --> 03:26:31.837]  As a matter of fact, we want to avoid it at all costs.
[03:26:32.344 --> 03:26:35.028]  It's not us who's perpetrating the violence.
[03:26:35.028 --> 03:26:40.035]  We're trying to expose those who have committed violent acts because we don't want to see that.
[03:26:40.035 --> 03:26:41.076]  We don't want bloodshed.
[03:26:41.076 --> 03:26:42.418]  We decry that.
[03:26:42.418 --> 03:26:43.660]  We'll take We Are Change.
[03:26:43.660 --> 03:26:44.942]  Take We Are Change.
[03:26:44.942 --> 03:26:46.123]  They're all about Gandhi.
[03:26:46.123 --> 03:26:47.325]  Be the change you want to see in the world.
[03:26:47.325 --> 03:26:47.946]  Nonviolent.
[03:26:48.206 --> 03:26:49.567]  Yeah, I think that's a very likely possibility.
[03:27:13.430 --> 03:27:19.492]  Most of everybody listening right now knows for a fact that something is wrong with what we've been told about 9-11.
[03:27:19.492 --> 03:27:20.853]  We need a new reinvestigation.
[03:27:20.853 --> 03:27:21.793]  That's clear.
[03:27:21.793 --> 03:27:24.474]  There's been a lot of progress that's been made on many fronts.
[03:27:24.474 --> 03:27:30.056]  Alex has made movie upon movie upon movie.
[03:27:30.056 --> 03:27:34.077]  The Corps of Corruption series has been very eye-opening and enlightening.
[03:27:34.077 --> 03:27:38.199]  The Fabled Enemies, Jason Berman's film, really great job on that.
[03:27:38.655 --> 03:27:44.759]  I mean, on so many fronts, we're making progress, and I think that we just have to continue to, you know, to storm the castle.
[03:27:44.759 --> 03:27:46.801]  We can't get complacent.
[03:27:46.801 --> 03:27:50.243]  It's palpable right now, I think, in the air.
[03:27:50.243 --> 03:27:57.688]  I think people can feel that there's something on the horizon, and I think that people might be a little bit scared, not knowing, is it going to be something positive?
[03:27:57.688 --> 03:27:59.109]  Is it going to be something negative?
[03:27:59.109 --> 03:28:00.890]  I think we can certainly make it something positive.
[03:28:00.890 --> 03:28:06.294]  I think humanity stands at the threshold of a real opportunity for a quantum transformation
[03:28:07.118 --> 03:28:12.764]  Not just, I don't mean to get all metaphysical and spiritual, but I think... No, it's a tipping point.
[03:28:12.764 --> 03:28:14.806]  We're going into evil or we're going into good.
[03:28:14.806 --> 03:28:16.528]  We've got to make a choice.
[03:28:16.528 --> 03:28:18.429]  We really do have to make a choice.
[03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:20.571]  And the battle lines are, I mean, it's clear.
[03:28:20.571 --> 03:28:21.572]  It's clear.
[03:28:21.572 --> 03:28:28.179]  As you say all the time, you're either on the side of humanity, free humanity, or you're on the side of the globalists at this point.
[03:28:28.179 --> 03:28:30.181]  And being neutral is really not an option.
[03:28:30.181 --> 03:28:31.302]  Neutrality equals
[03:28:32.089 --> 03:28:35.371]  Uh, you know, equals, I don't know what... Consent!
[03:28:35.371 --> 03:28:42.696]  Consent, yeah, you know, to consent to what we know in our guts is evil and is wrong, so we really can't afford to be on the sidelines right now.
[03:28:42.696 --> 03:28:44.397]  We have to be in the game.
[03:28:44.397 --> 03:28:49.700]  That's the reason why I tried my hand, my neophyte-handed writing, you know, just generating an article about how
[03:28:50.225 --> 03:28:51.346]  Oh, it's excellent!
[03:28:51.346 --> 03:28:52.307]  I hope you do more!
[03:28:52.307 --> 03:28:52.667]  Wow!
[03:28:52.667 --> 03:28:54.068]  Thank you, thank you, Alec.
[03:28:54.068 --> 03:29:08.019]  But, you know, just the way that the media unfairly addresses the issue of 9-11, when they even address it at all, it's either the style of Glenn Beck, or Joe Scarborough, or Bill O'Reilly, or it's total blackout.
[03:29:08.019 --> 03:29:09.300]  And that's really a shame.
[03:29:09.300 --> 03:29:17.687]  I don't know how many more articles Alan Miller has to publish about 41 intelligence experts and people from inside the intelligence community saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[03:29:18.251 --> 03:29:23.772]  Or, you know, people from the, inside other branches of the government.
[03:29:23.772 --> 03:29:27.393]  Pilots for 9-11 Truths, 700 engineers.
[03:29:27.393 --> 03:29:28.773]  It's just, it's ridiculous at this point.
[03:29:28.773 --> 03:29:32.474]  I mean, we clearly have a critical mass of experts from relevant fields of expertise.
[03:29:32.474 --> 03:29:38.515]  Now all we need is the platform where they can speak what they know and people like me can get out of the way.
[03:29:38.515 --> 03:29:40.536]  We're just, you know, that's it.
[03:29:40.536 --> 03:29:41.416]  Just let them have the floor.
[03:29:42.014 --> 03:29:44.436]  Daniel Sinjada, let me say bye to you during this break.
[03:29:44.436 --> 03:29:45.337]  We'll have you back soon.
[03:29:45.337 --> 03:29:46.358]  God bless you.
[03:29:46.358 --> 03:29:47.940]  And listen, we salute your courage.
[03:29:47.940 --> 03:29:48.921]  I salute you guys as well.
[03:29:48.921 --> 03:29:51.363]  God bless.
[03:29:51.363 --> 03:29:52.765]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.765 --> 03:29:55.287]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.287 --> 03:29:58.010]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.976 --> 03:30:10.081]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[03:30:10.081 --> 03:30:15.244]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[03:30:15.244 --> 03:30:17.826]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[03:30:18.246 --> 03:30:20.287]  Actually results in disease.

[03:31:00.784 --> 03:31:07.767]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years, Inner Health Botanicals.
[03:31:07.947 --> 03:31:12.208]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[03:31:12.208 --> 03:31:14.069]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[03:31:14.069 --> 03:31:21.511]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[03:31:21.511 --> 03:31:24.052]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[03:31:24.372 --> 03:31:26.113]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[03:31:26.113 --> 03:31:29.136]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[03:31:29.136 --> 03:31:30.837]  And their formula really works.
[03:31:30.837 --> 03:31:33.659]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[03:31:33.659 --> 03:31:39.925]  Try the Nutra Cafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[03:31:39.925 --> 03:31:42.326]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[03:31:42.326 --> 03:31:44.808]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[03:31:44.808 --> 03:31:46.910]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[03:31:46.910 --> 03:31:49.292]  Go to www.nutracafe.com.

[03:32:00.999 --> 03:32:09.865]  Know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[03:32:09.865 --> 03:32:18.050]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[03:32:18.050 --> 03:32:18.350]  In fact,
[03:32:18.390 --> 03:32:18.830]  We're good to go!
[03:32:47.319 --> 03:32:51.281]  Excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.

[03:33:14.515 --> 03:33:17.457]  It is the second day of the Money Bomb.
[03:33:17.457 --> 03:33:21.720]  Last year, the donations kept coming in after the first day for three days, so we kind of let it go for a few days.
[03:33:21.720 --> 03:33:30.046]  We do this once a year to support equipment, expanding the TV studio, hiring more people, and you've really come through.
[03:33:30.046 --> 03:33:32.148]  I can tell you that we're about $3,000, $4,000 away from our goal of $250,000.
[03:33:36.345 --> 03:33:50.052]  But throughout the weekend, if you want to give $5, $10, $100, $1,000 so we can really up our game against the New World Order, you're looking at the guy that puts out the number one viral films, the Obama deception, Endgame, Terror Storm, Truth Rising, Road to Tyranny.
[03:33:50.052 --> 03:33:55.534]  You're looking at the progenitor of the 9-11 Truth Movement, there from the start.
[03:33:55.534 --> 03:33:57.435]  And I know we can have victory.
[03:33:57.435 --> 03:34:04.038]  You're looking at what Ron Paul said, half his support in his campaign came from this radio show.
[03:34:04.038 --> 03:34:05.639]  We need to expand that platform.
[03:34:08.814 --> 03:34:12.976]  We need to come together against the New World Order.
[03:34:12.976 --> 03:34:18.978]  So please go to Infowarsmoneybomb.com right now and donate.
[03:34:18.978 --> 03:34:20.158]  You can do it through Sunday.
[03:34:20.158 --> 03:34:22.579]  We'll cut it off Monday.
[03:34:22.579 --> 03:34:27.121]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com or 888-201-2244.
[03:34:27.121 --> 03:34:30.922]  We will have people here this weekend who would like to call in and donate.
[03:34:30.922 --> 03:34:33.303]  But let's hear a little bit more from Bob Marley, then I'll get back into the news.
[03:34:36.547 --> 03:34:37.047]  I feel.
[03:34:37.047 --> 03:34:40.388]  They don't want to see us unite.
[03:35:08.673 --> 03:35:10.836]  Respond to their tyranny!
[03:35:30.703 --> 03:35:41.231]  All right, I'm in a news blitz now, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:35:41.231 --> 03:35:51.299]  But I just want to put that call out to people one more time to support this radio show.
[03:35:51.299 --> 03:35:54.541]  Where did you hear first that we were at level six a month and a half ago?
[03:35:55.649 --> 03:35:57.171]  Here, now it's mainstream news.
[03:35:57.171 --> 03:35:58.732]  We were under level six the whole time.
[03:35:58.732 --> 03:36:05.059]  UN control of the nations of the world as they prepare, saying the pandemic will break back out in the fall and winter.
[03:36:05.059 --> 03:36:06.080]  I'm not saying that's happening.
[03:36:06.080 --> 03:36:06.841]  They're saying that.
[03:36:06.841 --> 03:36:09.343]  And that they're going to give us forced inoculations.
[03:36:09.343 --> 03:36:11.465]  Just Google forced inoculations.
[03:36:11.465 --> 03:36:14.749]  It is all over the news.
[03:36:18.072 --> 03:36:20.274]  Martial law, Fox says, is a good thing.
[03:36:20.274 --> 03:36:21.975]  They're acclimating you.
[03:36:21.975 --> 03:36:26.719]  They're getting everybody used to hearing federalization, martial law, quarantine, lockdown.
[03:36:26.719 --> 03:36:32.563]  All over the world, governments are using this for tyranny, as directed by the United Nations.
[03:36:32.563 --> 03:36:43.652]  So that's why we need to be strong going into this depression, going into this collapse, so we can make sure we're not just maintaining but expanding as our voice is needed more and more as this platform with
[03:36:44.577 --> 03:37:03.736]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts today, father of Reaganomics, exposing the fake conservatism and the corruption of the Republican and Democratic parties, and the betrayals of Obama, and Bob Chapman, and then Daniel Sanjata, the star of Rescue Me and other TV programs, standing up with courage.
[03:37:03.736 --> 03:37:07.840]  It is so important, ladies and gentlemen, that we respond to tyranny in the Infowar.
[03:37:10.609 --> 03:37:14.074]  And you can support us by getting the t-shirts, the books, the videos.
[03:37:14.074 --> 03:37:15.436]  All of it's about educating others.
[03:37:15.436 --> 03:37:18.400]  When you wear a Tyranny Response Team t-shirt, people ask, what is that?
[03:37:18.400 --> 03:37:23.747]  You can explain how you're standing up for the Republic, how you're really defending America.
[03:37:23.747 --> 03:37:26.570]  Instead of being troops off in foreign lands for the bankers.
[03:37:27.711 --> 03:37:37.916]  Or when you donate for the Money Bomb, it allows us to know we've got that money for the year to make the expansions that need to be made and to maintain what we've already built.
[03:37:37.916 --> 03:37:42.058]  We've done so much in the last year, more than we did in three or four years before combined.
[03:37:42.058 --> 03:37:43.598]  We're accelerating what we're doing.
[03:37:43.598 --> 03:37:44.919]  Please call, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:44.919 --> 03:37:46.760]  Let's go above last year's $250,000, 888.
[03:37:49.241 --> 03:38:05.884]  201-2244-888-201-2244 or infowarsmoneybomb.com because I want to get to that 50,000 mark in the next 23 minutes before the show ends and reach that goal and then we'll find out Monday what happened over the weekend and how above and beyond that we went.
[03:38:05.884 --> 03:38:12.726]  We're going to hire more webmasters, more video editors, bigger TV studio, everything because of your support.
[03:38:12.726 --> 03:38:13.346]  We salute you.
[03:38:16.434 --> 03:38:23.797]  Alright, you know, I got into this ABC News, AP, also this is the News of Australia, originally broke it, was the Australian.
[03:38:23.797 --> 03:38:25.357]  Vioxx maker Merck and co.
[03:38:25.357 --> 03:38:29.519]  drew up Dr. Hit List for those to be liquidated, those to be killed.
[03:38:29.519 --> 03:38:30.419]  That's mainstream news.
[03:38:30.419 --> 03:38:37.541]  Those criticizing their drugs that are killing people like Vioxx and the human papillomavirus, the Gardasil drugs.
[03:38:37.541 --> 03:38:38.902]  And these are hardcore people.
[03:38:39.659 --> 03:38:44.044]  Got articles with the local police and military training for gun confiscation.
[03:38:44.044 --> 03:38:56.860]  We broke two days ago that the VFW is being told to prepare even Civil War cannons and things and Spanish-American war guns, rifles, daggers, so the BATF can confiscate them when they need to.
[03:38:57.641 --> 03:38:58.442]  That's happening.
[03:38:58.442 --> 03:39:03.065]  Obama ousts AmeriCorps' director who investigated Friend.
[03:39:03.065 --> 03:39:05.046]  AP reports Obama incredibly corrupt.
[03:39:05.046 --> 03:39:14.032]  President Obama says he has lost confidence in the Inspector General who investigates AmeriCorps and other national service programs and has told Congress he is removing him from the position.
[03:39:14.032 --> 03:39:17.635]  Obama's move follows an investigation by IG Gerald Walpin.
[03:39:18.991 --> 03:39:30.253]  uh... finding misuse of federal grants by a non-partisan education group led by sacramento mayor kevin johnson who is an obama supporter and former nba basketball star walton was criticized by the acting u.s.
[03:39:30.253 --> 03:39:41.596]  attorney in sacramento for the way he handled the investigation of johnson and st hope academy a non-profit group that received hundreds of thousands of dollars and federal grants from the corporation of national community service so obama's fired this person
[03:39:42.236 --> 03:39:43.057]  to cover up.
[03:39:56.314 --> 03:40:14.854]  David Gergen, Aaron, a few weeks ago did a huge report, and that's those videos they put on TV with taxpayer money of, this is my uniform, I'm city year, in red and black uniforms, marching in tattletale squads, their own private political army illegally being recruited with federal money.
[03:40:14.854 --> 03:40:18.238]  Oh, ACORN's not corrupt during the election, and then just look at it now.
[03:40:22.395 --> 03:40:27.597]  So Obama is just a big Chicago machine corrupt thug.
[03:40:27.597 --> 03:40:28.157]  Now look at this.
[03:40:28.157 --> 03:40:34.018]  I want to shift gears into another subject.
[03:40:34.018 --> 03:40:41.541]  I have interviewed Ben Livingston, the meteorologist, the father of weather weapons.
[03:40:41.541 --> 03:40:42.261]  The guy's amazing.
[03:40:42.261 --> 03:40:43.881]  World War II vet.
[03:40:43.881 --> 03:40:49.583]  Flew into... Hurricanes are in our side of the world and they only go up to about 200 miles an hour.
[03:40:50.540 --> 03:40:55.001]  They can go up 250, 300 miles an hour and they call them typhoons.
[03:40:55.001 --> 03:40:57.162]  Flew into typhoons.
[03:40:57.162 --> 03:41:01.843]  He was there leading fighter squadrons in Vietnam, manipulating.
[03:41:01.843 --> 03:41:05.864]  He would go in where there were no clouds and make it rain 10 feet on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[03:41:05.864 --> 03:41:07.144]  Just amazing.
[03:41:07.144 --> 03:41:10.825]  And I got sent documents by a listener going, this was just declassified.
[03:41:10.825 --> 03:41:11.165]  I think it was 2002.
[03:41:13.885 --> 03:41:22.091]  Well, PrisonPlanet.tv members can watch the Ben Livingston interviews, but the point is... And then it got ripped to the YouTube channel, so it's out there, but in high quality for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[03:41:22.091 --> 03:41:26.234]  The issue is that he was the father of weather weapons.
[03:41:26.234 --> 03:41:28.335]  He got Stanford Research Institute to develop it.
[03:41:28.335 --> 03:41:34.239]  He became the head of the... It was the Navy.
[03:41:34.239 --> 03:41:36.761]  After that, the Navy Weapons Laboratory.
[03:41:36.761 --> 03:41:38.542]  Just an amazing individual.
[03:41:38.542 --> 03:41:40.764]  And he flew these fighter jets into typhoons.
[03:41:40.764 --> 03:41:40.864]  He...
[03:41:43.203 --> 03:41:44.283]  You know, did all of this stuff.
[03:41:44.283 --> 03:41:47.804]  He was the first guy to fly into hurricanes and typhoons.
[03:41:47.804 --> 03:41:56.987]  And by 1967, they had certified that they could kill hurricanes, make hurricanes, weaken hurricanes, strengthen hurricanes.
[03:41:56.987 --> 03:42:06.250]  And he said, with today's technologies, back then it would take a hundred aircraft, with eight aircraft, he could go in and kill a hurricane or make a hurricane.
[03:42:06.250 --> 03:42:10.231]  And he was calling for a Department of Weather.
[03:42:11.564 --> 03:42:12.284]  to control the weather.
[03:42:32.594 --> 03:42:34.535]  These listeners giving us tips.
[03:42:34.535 --> 03:42:35.456]  I called Ben Livingston.
[03:42:35.456 --> 03:42:36.776]  I said, I'd like to have you on the radio.
[03:42:36.776 --> 03:42:37.417]  Had him on.
[03:42:37.417 --> 03:42:40.639]  Suddenly it was Fox News, CNN, but still they hadn't interviewed him.
[03:42:40.639 --> 03:42:41.859]  I said, fly here next week.
[03:42:41.859 --> 03:42:42.540]  I want to interview you.
[03:42:42.540 --> 03:42:49.424]  That's going to be in the Chemtrail film, but the issue is, is that he got here and he got into weather control.
[03:42:50.540 --> 03:42:55.841]  Now that's separate from HAARP and all these other technologies, but the issue is they can control hurricanes in 67.
[03:42:55.841 --> 03:42:59.402]  That's 40 years ago, isn't it?
[03:42:59.402 --> 03:43:01.902]  Yeah, 40 years ago.
[03:43:01.902 --> 03:43:03.922]  42, 3 years ago.
[03:43:03.922 --> 03:43:06.023]  So then they say there's no weather control.
[03:43:06.023 --> 03:43:12.124]  And then we started noticing in the mid-90s that suddenly condensation trails were forming at 2,000 or 3,000 feet in the summer.
[03:43:12.124 --> 03:43:12.964]  Impossible.
[03:43:12.964 --> 03:43:14.885]  And they were staying there for hours.
[03:43:14.885 --> 03:43:17.345]  And they'd always disappeared, even at high altitudes, in a few minutes.
[03:43:18.922 --> 03:43:32.649]  And then we started getting reports of low-altitude spraying, high-altitude spraying, helicopter spraying, declassified admissions of spraying Subtilis GloboG bacteria all over New Mexico, all over Texas, Oklahoma, killing people with it.
[03:43:32.649 --> 03:43:35.430]  That was in the Daily Oklahoman.
[03:43:35.430 --> 03:43:43.054]  All of this is going on and happening, and still you're called a kook if you talk about it.
[03:43:44.420 --> 03:43:54.223]  And then I began to interview a meteorologist and a climatologist on this show and weathermen from major TV stations going, no, no, yeah, you can see them spraying here.
[03:43:54.223 --> 03:43:56.944]  And now in Florida news, they go, look at all these lines sprayed.
[03:43:56.944 --> 03:43:59.565]  Somebody, the government's doing that, but it doesn't look like chaff.
[03:43:59.565 --> 03:44:00.786]  Chaff's in a small area.
[03:44:00.786 --> 03:44:05.967]  It was, you know, like the whole area blocking storms about to hit, I guess, to keep the drought going.
[03:44:05.967 --> 03:44:10.209]  And so everybody, all these meteorologists who learned that this isn't normal,
[03:44:11.664 --> 03:44:17.670]  They're now going, oh, that's because there's new phenomenon, new clouds, new systems being discovered.
[03:44:17.670 --> 03:44:21.933]  And it's normal to have barium salts and aluminum dioxide raining down.
[03:44:23.038 --> 03:44:28.081]  And we said, folks, it's at least a weather modification program with a bunch of other programs rolled in.
[03:44:28.081 --> 03:44:34.224]  Then listeners began to email us two years ago going, high-altitude aerosol spraying.
[03:44:34.224 --> 03:44:34.784]  Google that.
[03:44:34.784 --> 03:44:35.805]  So I googled it.
[03:44:35.805 --> 03:44:36.725]  And it was thousands.
[03:44:36.725 --> 03:44:48.112]  Department of Energy, the Japanese Department of Energy, German Department of Energy, and Power, and British, and all these countries, and NASA saying we've dimmed the Earth by 20% for its safety, and kids' textbooks.
[03:44:48.112 --> 03:44:50.073]  They always tell parents, there's no plan to chip you.
[03:44:50.073 --> 03:44:51.814]  But then the kids' textbooks say, we're going to chip you.
[03:44:51.814 --> 03:44:52.134]  It's good.
[03:44:52.714 --> 03:44:54.035]  You know, there's a world government, it's good.
[03:44:54.035 --> 03:44:57.639]  You know, in the textbooks, they tell parents, it doesn't exist, but your kid's being taught it's good.
[03:44:57.639 --> 03:45:00.662]  You know, weird psychological warfare going on.
[03:45:00.662 --> 03:45:14.958]  Textbooks saying it was happening, and then, a few months ago, his head of science department comes out, Obama, and says, oh, we're going to spray the skies with barium salts and lumen dioxide to save the Earth from global warming, when the science actually shows it's causing warming.
[03:45:15.478 --> 03:45:16.739]  Which they may need to do.
[03:45:16.739 --> 03:45:18.020]  It looks like we're going into an ice age.
[03:45:18.020 --> 03:45:19.421]  They're trying to block it.
[03:45:19.421 --> 03:45:20.181]  And they would do that.
[03:45:20.181 --> 03:45:21.282]  It would really be an ice age.
[03:45:21.282 --> 03:45:22.142]  They're trying to block it.
[03:45:22.142 --> 03:45:26.185]  And they say, we've got to have a carbon tax to control us saying it's heat.
[03:45:26.185 --> 03:45:29.167]  So they can then, as we get cold, say that they saved us from that.
[03:45:29.167 --> 03:45:30.388]  I don't know what they're doing.
[03:45:30.388 --> 03:45:33.630]  Can they use the weather weapons they admittedly have to cause all these problems?
[03:45:33.630 --> 03:45:35.131]  And then say, oh look, it's climate change.
[03:45:35.131 --> 03:45:35.731]  Do what we want.
[03:45:35.731 --> 03:45:38.833]  That's what witch doctors would do thousands of years ago.
[03:45:38.833 --> 03:45:41.495]  Every time there was a problem, they'd say the Hooju God had done it or whatever.
[03:45:43.411 --> 03:45:48.415]  It's all psychology, it's all chicanery and scams and bamboozling people.
[03:45:48.415 --> 03:45:56.360]  But we know they have weather weapons, we know the program's going on, and then suddenly they just come out and say, okay, we're doing tests.
[03:45:56.360 --> 03:46:02.885]  Thousands of agencies around the world and companies and tens of billions of dollars we know of a year.
[03:46:02.885 --> 03:46:05.407]  I mean, you can go spend the entire weekend, it's Friday.
[03:46:05.987 --> 03:46:12.289]  Go look at chemtrails admitted or passive and non-passive aerosol altitude spraying campaigns.
[03:46:12.289 --> 03:46:13.409]  Google terms like that.
[03:46:13.409 --> 03:46:21.411]  Tens of thousands of hits, universities, how they're spraying, the tests they did, how it's added to jet fuel, dispersed out of the engines.
[03:46:21.411 --> 03:46:22.492]  It's all compartmentalized.
[03:46:22.492 --> 03:46:24.092]  It goes through the jet fuel companies.
[03:46:24.092 --> 03:46:26.373]  They put it in there and some of them actually have sprayers.
[03:46:26.373 --> 03:46:31.194]  Some of the systems dispersed and aerosolized with the particulate, the nuclei out of the aircraft.
[03:46:31.514 --> 03:46:38.500]  I mean, it's just like they put sodium fluoride in the water and it's compartmentalized and the idiot pouring it in at the water plant, he thinks it's good.
[03:46:38.500 --> 03:46:39.441]  He's not bad.
[03:46:39.441 --> 03:46:41.723]  Like doctors giving people Vioxx, it's killing them.
[03:46:41.723 --> 03:46:42.664]  They think it's good.
[03:46:42.664 --> 03:46:45.546]  Meanwhile, Merck's got hit teams out taking people out.
[03:46:45.546 --> 03:46:48.109]  It's in mainstream federal courts and nobody cares.
[03:46:48.109 --> 03:46:53.153]  I mean, do you understand the magnitude of the insanity of all this?
[03:46:53.153 --> 03:46:56.056]  And so I have this AP article, and I saw this a year ago.
[03:46:57.509 --> 03:47:18.782]  This is June 11th from yesterday, but I saw universities debating, previously there were three kinds of clouds, now they're saying there's three or four other new types, and there's these weird little clouds that they say form in trails and have chemicals in them, and they fall on us, and they don't know where they come from, and are space particles coalescing in the atmosphere?
[03:47:18.782 --> 03:47:23.925]  And the scientists can't say it's man-made, so they're going, I don't know, there's new clouds now!
[03:47:26.240 --> 03:47:29.363]  Here's AP right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:47:29.363 --> 03:47:34.067]  But to discredit it, they don't focus in on all the scientists, meteorologists, climatologists saying this.
[03:47:34.067 --> 03:47:44.196]  They focus in on a woman's photo and act like there's this big debate in meteorology and climatology and those that are studying hydrology and the ocean.
[03:47:45.779 --> 03:47:46.480]  This is PSYOP.
[03:47:46.480 --> 03:47:49.682]  They make it about a woman who took a photo, so now there's a debate about it.
[03:47:49.682 --> 03:47:51.243]  Because usually they would deny this.
[03:47:51.243 --> 03:47:56.667]  I'm seeing clouds at a thousand feet that are weird chemicals and they burn your eyes and they hit the ground.
[03:47:56.667 --> 03:47:58.428]  They look like chemical sprays.
[03:47:58.428 --> 03:47:59.609]  You saw an alien.
[03:47:59.609 --> 03:48:00.530]  You take photos.
[03:48:00.530 --> 03:48:02.251]  Oh, you photoshopped that.
[03:48:02.251 --> 03:48:02.992]  You walk outside.
[03:48:02.992 --> 03:48:05.253]  They're everywhere and they're going, that's normal.
[03:48:05.253 --> 03:48:08.115]  You know, it's like body snatchers or something.
[03:48:08.115 --> 03:48:09.697]  Just go to sleep.
[03:48:09.697 --> 03:48:12.719]  That's a metaphor for turning your intellect off and everything will be alright.
[03:48:12.719 --> 03:48:13.299]  Sleep.
[03:48:13.299 --> 03:48:13.599]  Sleep.
[03:48:14.700 --> 03:48:19.083]  Iowa woman's photo sparks push for new cloud type.
[03:48:19.083 --> 03:48:19.764]  AP.
[03:48:19.764 --> 03:48:25.828]  Looking out the 11th floor window of her law office, Jane Wiggins did a double take and grabbed her camera.
[03:48:25.828 --> 03:48:30.871]  The dark, undulating clouds hovering outside weren't like anything she'd seen before.
[03:48:30.871 --> 03:48:36.315]  It looked like Armageddon, said Wiggins, a paralegal and amateur photographer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
[03:48:36.315 --> 03:48:42.619]  The shadows of the clouds, the lights and the darks, and the greenish-yellow backdrop, they seemed to change.
[03:48:42.619 --> 03:48:44.060]  Yeah, chemical clouds will do that.
[03:48:45.387 --> 03:48:51.071]  First time I ever saw it was a naturally occurring, because they knew it on purpose, over chemical plants in Houston.
[03:48:51.071 --> 03:48:56.995]  A weird little green cloud at a thousand feet, toxic cloud.
[03:48:56.995 --> 03:48:57.936]  They dispersed.
[03:48:59.093 --> 03:49:11.522]  Dissipate within 15 minutes, but with the photos Wiggins captured in June 2006 intrigue and stumped a group of dedicated weather watchers who are now pushing weather authority to create a new cloud category, something that hasn't been done since 1951.
[03:49:11.522 --> 03:49:19.188]  Breaking into the cloud family would require serving layers of skeptical interviews, reviews.
[03:49:19.188 --> 03:49:19.929]  Still Gavin
[03:49:21.489 --> 03:49:26.871]  And his England-based Cloud Appreciation Society are determined to establish a new variety.
[03:49:26.871 --> 03:49:28.672]  And he goes on, oh, the new variety?
[03:49:28.672 --> 03:49:31.473]  Just look at NASA public satellite photos.
[03:49:31.473 --> 03:49:33.493]  In fact, let's pull up the time we have left.
[03:49:33.493 --> 03:49:35.954]  We'll see if we can do it in the last segment.
[03:49:35.954 --> 03:49:39.735]  Google live NASA satellite West Coast.
[03:49:41.952 --> 03:49:46.215]  And let's go look at California and see all the lines sprayed.
[03:49:46.215 --> 03:49:51.798]  And then there's meteorology of the whole country everywhere, just lines everywhere, everywhere.
[03:49:51.798 --> 03:49:56.982]  And you'll see a weather front coming in and the planes come in and put it in front of it to block it.
[03:49:56.982 --> 03:50:02.225]  I mean, they're spraying us 24-7 and the White House admits it.
[03:50:02.225 --> 03:50:03.046]  They've gone so far.
[03:50:03.046 --> 03:50:07.509]  Now there's all these new little green clouds raining things down on us.
[03:50:07.509 --> 03:50:09.250]  And they're going, I don't exist.
[03:50:10.174 --> 03:50:11.735]  Anyways, it's just amazing.
[03:50:11.735 --> 03:50:12.575]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:50:12.575 --> 03:50:15.296]  I got some final stuff dealing with the economy.
[03:50:15.296 --> 03:50:17.717]  They're now announcing they're going to officially federalize everything.
[03:50:17.717 --> 03:50:24.319]  9-11 Truth activist sues Glenn Beck and Fox News for defamation.
[03:50:24.319 --> 03:50:32.462]  I don't know if that'll be successful, if they have standing, the courts will say, but at least it'll bring attention to him.
[03:50:32.462 --> 03:50:34.582]  So we'll tell you a little bit about that.
[03:50:34.582 --> 03:50:35.963]  Greg Hoover, I'm going to get him on.
[03:50:37.202 --> 03:50:38.263]  Lindbeck is a monster.
[03:50:38.263 --> 03:50:49.448]  I mean, it would be like saying Native Americans are saying they love what the shooter of the Jews did with no evidence.
[03:50:49.448 --> 03:50:54.271]  I mean, it is to persecute a minority group, which is becoming a majority.
[03:50:54.271 --> 03:50:56.172]  We'll break all that down on the other side.
[03:50:56.172 --> 03:50:57.572]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:50:57.572 --> 03:50:59.073]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[03:50:59.073 --> 03:51:00.154]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.417 --> 03:51:11.984]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:51:11.984 --> 03:51:13.405]  Garden in a Can!
[03:51:13.405 --> 03:51:17.547]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.

[03:51:32.006 --> 03:51:33.427]  Garden in a Can.
[03:51:33.427 --> 03:51:34.628]  It's that simple.
[03:51:34.628 --> 03:51:37.029]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[03:51:37.029 --> 03:51:41.371]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[03:51:41.371 --> 03:51:42.952]  Ready when you are.

[03:52:00.842 --> 03:52:06.668]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:06.668 --> 03:52:13.636]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:14.244 --> 03:52:20.831]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.831 --> 03:52:22.793]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.793 --> 03:52:25.316]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.316 --> 03:52:36.288]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:36.872 --> 03:52:38.533]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:38.533 --> 03:52:40.393]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:40.393 --> 03:52:47.316]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:47.316 --> 03:52:55.579]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:55.579 --> 03:52:57.139]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:57.139 --> 03:52:58.340]  The people strike back.
[03:53:00.196 --> 03:53:04.720]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:53:04.720 --> 03:53:07.282]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:53:07.282 --> 03:53:16.749]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:53:16.749 --> 03:53:17.349]  We're good to go.
[03:53:35.897 --> 03:53:36.257]  Let's go!
[03:54:15.599 --> 03:54:22.465]  We're only about $1,000 away, I'm told, from our goal of $250,000 for the June 11th money bomb.
[03:54:22.465 --> 03:54:23.366]  And that's what happened last year.
[03:54:23.366 --> 03:54:28.870]  We raised about, I don't know, $190,000, $200,000, and another $50,000 came in the next few days.
[03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:37.377]  So throughout the weekend, if you want to give online at PayPal or credit card to expand our operations, if you believe this message is important and want to aid us in this, thank you so much.
[03:54:38.058 --> 03:54:39.579]  That's what Free Will is all about.
[03:54:39.579 --> 03:54:41.539]  We thank you for your support.
[03:54:41.539 --> 03:54:47.282]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or link through at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to that page.
[03:54:47.282 --> 03:54:53.384]  And we'll let you know Monday how much above last year's amount we got.
[03:54:53.384 --> 03:54:56.305]  The next year's, I guess, goal will be what this year was.
[03:54:56.305 --> 03:54:59.647]  And just want to thank all of you for your support and just spreading the word about the show.
[03:55:00.647 --> 03:55:03.668]  It has really helped, and there'll be some people here on and off during the weekend.
[03:55:03.668 --> 03:55:09.069]  If you want to make a donation over the phone, leave your name and number, and they'll just call you back when they're in, if that's okay.
[03:55:09.069 --> 03:55:12.470]  888-201-2244, but folks are going to be here through this evening.
[03:55:12.470 --> 03:55:16.392]  888-201-2244, and then off and on during the weekend.
[03:55:16.392 --> 03:55:18.552]  My crew's so small, a lot of them need a break.
[03:55:18.552 --> 03:55:19.292]  I've been working a lot.
[03:55:19.292 --> 03:55:20.973]  888-201-2244, or InfoWorksMoneyBomb.com.
[03:55:26.916 --> 03:55:28.498]  Here's another article about drug companies.
[03:55:28.498 --> 03:55:29.599]  I have these every five minutes.
[03:55:29.599 --> 03:55:42.151]  Not only was one of the big companies wanting to go around and kill people, but Lilly sold drug for dimension knowing it didn't help file show.
[03:55:43.018 --> 03:55:43.858]  That's out of Bloomberg.
[03:55:43.858 --> 03:55:45.479]  Well, I mean, I'll tell you what's even worse than this.
[03:55:45.479 --> 03:55:48.700]  I mean, Factor VIII, Bayer, over a million doses for hemophiliacs.
[03:55:48.700 --> 03:55:51.401]  They knew it had HIV and hepatitis in every shot.
[03:55:51.401 --> 03:55:53.322]  And they knew it and shipped it out.
[03:55:53.322 --> 03:55:54.542]  People say, oh, they're cold-blooded.
[03:55:54.542 --> 03:55:55.743]  No, they're eugenicists.
[03:55:55.743 --> 03:55:58.464]  Bayer was actually run by the Nazis.
[03:55:58.464 --> 03:56:01.605]  So, you better learn, folks, this is all about eugenics.
[03:56:01.605 --> 03:56:02.345]  And these people mean...
[03:56:06.471 --> 03:56:23.977]  mean very very serious business so we certainly continue to look into that and here's another one uh... obama has introduced more than ten big bills that basically in the second as we know it and then as these bills move through congress he denies he wants your guns here's world that daily obama
[03:56:26.300 --> 03:56:28.622]  Eliminate 8 out of 10 pocket knives.
[03:56:28.622 --> 03:56:31.704]  If this were to pass, you could not cross a state line with one.
[03:56:31.704 --> 03:56:33.104]  It would be a felony.
[03:56:33.104 --> 03:56:33.485]  The U.S.
[03:56:33.485 --> 03:56:41.130]  Customs and Border Protection Agency is proposing a new definition that would be used to eliminate 8 of 10 legal pocket knives in the United States right now.
[03:56:41.130 --> 03:56:47.334]  According to activists who are gearing up to fight the plan, the federal bureaucracy is accepting comments.
[03:56:47.334 --> 03:56:52.277]  So now when you go to an airport and the thing's half an inch long, now you'll go to prison for it.
[03:56:53.749 --> 03:56:55.971]  Well, they love putting the slaves in prison.
[03:56:55.971 --> 03:56:56.911]  It's big business.
[03:56:56.911 --> 03:56:58.292]  That's what America is now.
[03:56:58.292 --> 03:57:09.680]  The federal bureaucracy is accepting comments written only that must be received by June 21st before its planned changes would become final, said Doug Ritter of KnifeRights.org.
[03:57:09.680 --> 03:57:10.641]  Let's get him on.
[03:57:10.641 --> 03:57:18.527]  So the implications of the decision would be far-reaching since many state and federal agencies depend on the agency's definitions to determine what is legal in the United States.
[03:57:18.527 --> 03:57:20.828]  So you're trying to drive back in from Mexico or Canada with your RV
[03:57:21.969 --> 03:57:25.091]  You're going to be arrested for having steak knives.
[03:57:25.091 --> 03:57:29.795]  England's trying to restrict knives now in your house and have a license to have a butcher knife.
[03:57:29.795 --> 03:57:31.336]  This is the enslavement.
[03:57:31.336 --> 03:57:33.137]  This is what's happening.
[03:57:33.137 --> 03:57:34.318]  And it's totally disgusting.
[03:57:34.318 --> 03:57:36.799]  And people keep calling me saying, where's the article?
[03:57:36.799 --> 03:57:40.001]  CBS News, PATH stations to run security screening tests.
[03:57:41.128 --> 03:57:44.470]  to use cutting-edge passive millimeter wave technology.
[03:57:44.470 --> 03:57:53.174]  Another article in the AP says everyone that rides the trains and the subways in Boston and New York and then nationwide later, this is a test, will be searched.
[03:57:53.174 --> 03:57:56.255]  The millimeter wave system scans your naked body.
[03:57:56.255 --> 03:57:57.295]  An image of it.
[03:57:57.295 --> 03:57:59.576]  There is CBS News on that.
[03:57:59.576 --> 03:58:03.218]  So not just the airports now, but the naked body scanners are going to go in everywhere.
[03:58:03.218 --> 03:58:07.700]  And the FBI has said they want to put these in shopping malls.
[03:58:07.700 --> 03:58:08.080]  Talk about 1984.
[03:58:09.941 --> 03:58:15.126]  But now, if you don't like Big Brother, you're some kind of Al-Qaeda operative or something.
[03:58:15.126 --> 03:58:26.437]  Again, from the bottom of my heart, from my very soul, I want to thank all of you for spreading the word and standing behind us and defending us from all the false attacks by the mainstream media and the establishment and the COINTELPRO operatives.
[03:58:27.679 --> 03:58:30.941]  And I want to thank all of you for supporting us with the InfoWorks Money Bomb.
[03:58:30.941 --> 03:58:33.622]  It's not too late to be part of this historical event.
[03:58:33.622 --> 03:58:35.763]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, with Jason Bermas.
[03:58:35.763 --> 03:58:37.024]  I'll be sitting in with him.
[03:58:37.024 --> 03:58:37.705]  God bless you all.
[03:58:37.705 --> 03:58:38.905]  See you back this Sunday, 2, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:38.905 --> 03:58:40.626]  live on the Syndicated Transmission.
[03:58:40.626 --> 03:58:41.927]  Take care.

[03:58:51.206 --> 03:58:56.413]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:58:56.413 --> 03:59:00.438]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.438 --> 03:59:06.026]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.346 --> 03:59:06.987]  It's true.
[03:59:06.987 --> 03:59:12.332]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:12.332 --> 03:59:18.619]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:59:18.619 --> 03:59:21.542]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:59:21.542 --> 03:59:26.046]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:26.046 --> 03:59:29.650]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:59:29.890 --> 03:59:35.614]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
