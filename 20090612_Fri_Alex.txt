[01:14.520 --> 01:17.280]  Sunjata was there got a chance to interview him a few times over the
[01:17.280 --> 01:22.320]  years I've been wanting to get him on the last few weeks and it's perfect timing
[01:22.320 --> 01:28.560]  he's on today because I want to get his take on Glenn Beck saying that 9-11
[01:28.560 --> 01:35.400]  truthers basically worship Von Brun the deranged killer of the poor security
[01:35.400 --> 01:42.640]  guard at the Holocaust Museum Memorial since then I got a whole parcel of MSNBC
[01:42.640 --> 01:48.280]  Fox News Clips saying the Department of Homeland Security report is am so
[01:48.280 --> 02:02.400]  lootily right just amazing they're saying that yes it is veterans it is gun
[02:02.400 --> 02:08.840]  owners they're basically all secretly white supremacist and 9-11 truthers

[02:37.600 --> 02:42.440]  Paul will want to rally his forces and prepare to do it and that should be in
[02:42.440 --> 02:46.080]  the next week or two that should be brought to the House floor in this
[02:46.080 --> 02:51.160]  session for debate and you imagine those that are going to get up and defend no
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.880]  no government agency Congress the courts the executive nothing can
[02:55.880 --> 03:01.440]  investigate it nothing and audited it's above the law and that Greenspan clip

[03:06.840 --> 03:11.120]  hundreds of versions of him on Laird News Hour saying we're above the law no one
[03:11.120 --> 03:14.440]  can investigate us and hundreds and hundreds of different clips of Bernie
[03:14.440 --> 03:18.200]  Sanders the senator asking Bernanke you know where the money is and Bernanke

[08:09.720 --> 08:15.280]  I was digging through the stacks of news from the last three or four days and
[08:15.280 --> 08:19.560]  it's probably 30 40 incredibly important stories I may have mentioned but never
[08:19.560 --> 08:24.000]  broke down I want to try to go through some of those in this shower even if I
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.600]  just get the headline in and then my take on it at least I want to kind of
[08:27.600 --> 08:33.920]  blitz through that it's important to bring some light to all of this also I
[08:33.920 --> 08:36.920]  want to let everybody know we've got Bob Chapman the international forecaster
[08:36.920 --> 08:40.000]  joining us next hour dr. Paul Craig Roberts former head of policy
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.120]  department of the Treasury Wall Street Journal editor formerly coming on about
[08:43.120 --> 08:47.200]  the economy Daniel Sinjata of rescue me fame and many other TV shows and movies
[08:47.200 --> 08:53.600]  9-11 truther to respond to Glenn Beck saying that von Brun is worshiped and
[08:53.600 --> 08:58.400]  loved and admired with no evidence he doesn't give a source he just says that
[08:58.400 --> 09:02.840]  it may be he might have heard but he's not sure if but that we worship von
[09:02.840 --> 09:07.560]  Brun and then now Obermann's saying Ron Paul and trying to connect him in with
[09:07.560 --> 09:16.760]  it it's really getting shameful but the system is panicking and we're talking
[09:16.760 --> 09:20.280]  to Ron Paul's office right now to find out when they plan to try to bring this
[09:20.280 --> 09:26.360]  to the floor what we can do in citizen lobbying to draw attention to this to
[09:26.360 --> 09:30.960]  engage in our First Amendment right and what dirty tricks the system may play
[09:30.960 --> 09:34.240]  to try to block this but it's very interesting that right is all this is
[09:34.240 --> 09:38.240]  get ready to come to a vote von Brun pops up who was in federal custody for
[09:38.240 --> 09:46.760]  six years correction I said five it's six years for running in with fake dynamite
[09:46.760 --> 09:50.680]  and a gun and then being disarmed at a federal reserve in 1981 I mean this is
[09:50.680 --> 09:58.120]  ridiculous this stinks to absolute high heaven so we'll break that down as well
[09:58.120 --> 10:03.200]  you know I'm giving an update on the info wars money bomb ladies and gentlemen
[10:03.200 --> 10:09.840]  very very exciting listeners had the idea and started the money bomb last
[10:09.840 --> 10:16.480]  year there were many other listeners started money bombs but I guess you know
[10:16.480 --> 10:19.360]  I've kind of been intimidated by the system in the media and the culture
[10:19.360 --> 10:22.280]  that we're not supposed to ever ask for money for support like the founding
[10:22.280 --> 10:26.080]  fathers did we're supposed to just let the IRS take our money give it to the
[10:26.080 --> 10:30.000]  private federal reserve that puts it into tax-free foundations for eugenics
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.920]  and propaganda and everything else and then those foundations go out and beg
[10:33.920 --> 10:38.200]  for money and even supplement their attacks on us what would happen if
[10:38.200 --> 10:43.680]  Austinites who've had more than 30,000 acres stolen from them the farms and
[10:43.680 --> 10:47.720]  ranches they wouldn't pay them for it they would say you can't build off
[10:47.720 --> 10:51.360]  limits for environmental reasons and five years later when the property value
[10:51.360 --> 10:55.080]  been devalued down to nothing the city would say okay we're gonna forcibly take
[10:55.080 --> 10:59.520]  your land by possession we're gonna have a 15,000 acre park here and a 2,000
[10:59.520 --> 11:05.840]  acre park there and then no sooner have they grabbed them that they then take
[11:05.840 --> 11:10.040]  the restrictions off and build lavish homes on them and literally handed over
[11:10.040 --> 11:15.080]  to their own contractors and Kirk Watson the mayor started his own bank now as a
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.400]  state senator that they run the land through I mean just open job of the
[11:19.400 --> 11:22.600]  hut level corruption right in front of everybody and he just sits there
[11:22.600 --> 11:26.720]  laughing literally with SWAT teams surrounding him saying I rule LCRA is
[11:26.720 --> 11:30.040]  grabbing land everywhere surveilling everybody surveillance systems
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.440]  everywhere it's private SWAT teams private group total corruption ruling
[11:34.440 --> 11:38.720]  everything buying up all the water supplies jacking up prices and that's
[11:38.720 --> 11:44.600]  just where I live but oh no we're not supposed to support Ron Paul we're not
[11:44.600 --> 11:47.520]  supposed to support good congressmen and women we're not supposed to support
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.640]  anti-new-old order candidates for mayor or county commissioner we're supposed to
[11:51.640 --> 11:55.360]  just let the environmentalist fakes go around knocking on doors intimidating
[11:55.360 --> 11:59.800]  housewives and soccer moms mainly I remember back when I was in high school
[11:59.800 --> 12:03.000]  as a senior here in Austin knock knock knock every other day because she'd
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.880]  given him money a few times my dear mother they'd say come on it's for the
[12:06.880 --> 12:11.080]  earth give money to save our springs they're gonna build all over it come on
[12:11.080 --> 12:15.520]  give us money give us money give us money then all goes right back to the
[12:15.520 --> 12:19.720]  bankers but see we're not supposed to raise money to counter the new world
[12:19.720 --> 12:22.480]  order we're not even supposed to sell books or videos by the national media
[12:22.480 --> 12:25.960]  says I'm not even supposed to make films and give them away for free that's
[12:25.960 --> 12:31.960]  profiteering it's a mind game it's an intimidation so I've decided to
[12:31.960 --> 12:36.840]  routinely ask people for support because we can do so much more and I don't care
[12:36.840 --> 12:41.280]  what the media says or does it's a mind game and I'm breaking that paradigm as
[12:41.280 --> 12:48.840]  well and I suggest you break it we shall all stand together or we shall
[12:48.840 --> 12:55.000]  certainly all hang separate a variant of Benjamin Franklin's we shall all hang
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.240]  together certainly hang separate it's very very simple but you know they
[13:00.240 --> 13:05.560]  criticize Thomas Jefferson and they criticized John Adams and many others
[13:05.560 --> 13:09.320]  for going to Europe and literally going around selling flags and their
[13:09.320 --> 13:15.160]  signatures and having to go to hundreds of little parties with rich French
[13:15.160 --> 13:22.080]  nouveau riche to raise money to buy lead but that's how it's done ladies and
[13:22.080 --> 13:25.440]  gentlemen so I encourage you all to buy the books by the videos you have been I
[13:25.440 --> 13:31.280]  want to thank you that's been part of the 2000 and 9 second annual money bomb
[13:31.280 --> 13:35.200]  yeah I'm gonna try to only do this once a year but as the economy implodes and
[13:35.200 --> 13:38.800]  things fall apart and we try to not just sustain what we're doing but expand it I
[13:38.800 --> 13:44.040]  may come back to you from time to time because as a rule I will not be bludgeoned
[13:44.040 --> 13:48.760]  or bullied into not doing something especially when I know it's right but
[13:48.760 --> 13:54.320]  again I want to commend all of you out there we have raised the accounting lady
[13:54.320 --> 13:57.440]  was here until one in the morning and she's gonna come in at noon so we don't
[13:57.440 --> 14:02.200]  have the latest numbers but as of the middle of the night last night we had
[14:02.200 --> 14:11.840]  raised $220,000 a little bit more than that and more is coming in but we've
[14:11.840 --> 14:15.760]  got to tabulate that when she comes in later in the show today I got a sneak
[14:15.760 --> 14:18.880]  and suspicion by the end of this transmission we're gonna hit the goal
[14:18.880 --> 14:24.440]  of $250,000 why is that the goal well that's what we did last year in about
[14:24.440 --> 14:28.200]  three days after we had the money bomb was like 200,000 and then trickling in
[14:28.200 --> 14:32.760]  was another 49,000 or so the next three or four days and we'll leave the money
[14:32.760 --> 14:37.960]  bomb up throughout the weekend the folks that man forgotten about it or we're
[14:37.960 --> 14:41.880]  thinking about it they wanted to donate but you know my wife this morning said
[14:41.880 --> 14:45.920]  honey just don't tell any old ladies on Social Security to give cuz you know we
[14:45.920 --> 14:53.040]  can just get more advertisers or we can you know we can go without here if that
[14:53.040 --> 14:57.680]  you know what it takes I can buy the kids less clothes every year if literally
[14:57.680 --> 15:00.280]  I'm having this conversation that's born of my wife in the parking lot of the
[15:00.280 --> 15:07.000]  house the driveway and I said don't you understand when an old lady gives $10
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.440]  that who doesn't have it it's the value that they gave that's what matters in
[15:12.440 --> 15:17.240]  and of itself that's part of the equation they're giving spirit their love of
[15:17.240 --> 15:21.920]  liberty and freedom their their commitment the opposite of this demonic
[15:21.920 --> 15:28.560]  culture of hoarding and then we complete the equation by doing good with it by
[15:28.560 --> 15:32.360]  telling the truth of taking action she said I understand but I would encourage
[15:32.360 --> 15:36.080]  people that don't have it to not give I mean as I've always said I've returned
[15:36.080 --> 15:39.920]  a lot of donations before when people written a letter about how poor they are
[15:39.920 --> 15:44.720]  and I get some thousand dollar donation we've sent them back you know years for
[15:44.720 --> 15:47.520]  years and years never asked for donations but we still get them and it's
[15:47.520 --> 15:51.880]  really made so much of what we've done here possible and you know it was my
[15:51.880 --> 15:55.360]  spirit of giving I just wanted people to know the truth about the New World Order
[15:55.360 --> 16:00.920]  and I knew that the founding fathers had put out little pamphlets they
[16:00.920 --> 16:05.840]  encouraged everybody to copy that weren't copyright they were called open
[16:05.840 --> 16:12.920]  letters to the public and that a lot of wealthy people in middle class would and
[16:12.920 --> 16:15.880]  even church groups will get together and finance buying two or three little
[16:15.880 --> 16:19.720]  printing presses that still cost a lot of money back then and then they would
[16:19.720 --> 16:28.320]  raise money and women would you mean you go out and sell produce and knit socks
[16:28.320 --> 16:37.560]  and sweaters and sell those to try to raise money so they could buy paper for
[16:37.560 --> 16:42.240]  the printing presses for a decade plus more like 15 years with the Sons of
[16:42.240 --> 16:49.560]  Liberty building up to 1775 1776 and so I'd read about that and what I talked
[16:49.560 --> 16:52.320]  about with Lou Rockwell yesterday about some of the other revolutions the last
[16:52.320 --> 16:57.480]  30 40 years using cassette tapes and things like that passing it forward I
[16:57.480 --> 17:02.480]  said look here's my first film America destroyed by design I said just buy the
[17:02.480 --> 17:06.600]  VHS tape and make copies and I even said sell it if you want to make money to
[17:06.600 --> 17:12.520]  make more copies I mean I was just get this out and other people who'd made a
[17:12.520 --> 17:15.560]  few films were like don't make copies don't even show it to a group you got to
[17:15.560 --> 17:18.920]  get them only from us and I and I would talk to those filmmakers and say don't
[17:18.920 --> 17:23.480]  understand we have no future if we don't get this word out plus you know it's
[17:23.480 --> 17:26.840]  just important that it be seen I just wanted to interface with fellow humans
[17:26.840 --> 17:31.400]  I just wanted to get the word out and warn people that Oklahoma City was an
[17:31.400 --> 17:37.040]  inside job by the Clinton East is an Eric Holder by the way help cover it up
[17:37.040 --> 17:47.360]  that's in declassified FBI documents when he was deputy attorney general and I
[17:47.360 --> 17:50.200]  wanted to show the UN taken over our national parks people's farms and
[17:50.200 --> 17:53.000]  ranches and people were denying it I had the bills and the documents and the
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.480]  executive orders so I went to the parks and politely asked about the UN they
[17:57.480 --> 18:01.560]  would threaten to arrest me and and there was a lot more in that film and I
[18:01.560 --> 18:06.560]  got arrested thumb scanning refusing a thumb scan and that went mega viral and
[18:06.560 --> 18:10.680]  was one of the first videos viral on the file sharing networks and on the
[18:10.680 --> 18:15.080]  internet and we pioneered that and because of the giving spirit the spirit
[18:15.080 --> 18:19.360]  of wanting to just interface with my fellow man and woman wanting to warn
[18:19.360 --> 18:25.120]  people wanting to alert people that's actually what built us and made us what
[18:25.120 --> 18:30.320]  we are today so by not wanting to be number one by not wanting to be
[18:30.320 --> 18:36.320]  successful financially we were and then later I learned well that was a really
[18:36.320 --> 18:40.120]  something the mainstream media just now is figuring out to give their stuff out
[18:40.120 --> 18:44.320]  for free and try to just be mega viral and dominate the marketplace of ideas
[18:44.320 --> 18:48.080]  well we've already got the jump on them and we taught a whole generation of
[18:48.080 --> 18:52.120]  young people how to do that look at what we are changing 911 truth and many
[18:52.120 --> 18:55.600]  others are doing the guerrilla journalism the confronting the politicians
[18:55.600 --> 18:58.600]  the taking over the press conferences peacefully we're just asking serious
[18:58.600 --> 19:02.160]  questions it's got the establishment scared and that's why they declared war
[19:02.160 --> 19:05.320]  on us in the media saying we're violent saying we're dangerous saying we're
[19:05.320 --> 19:09.240]  gonna stage terror attacks saying we're really white supremacist saying we work
[19:09.240 --> 19:14.600]  for al-qaeda and now magically the events years later are happening they do the
[19:14.600 --> 19:19.040]  preparatory phase and then they attack just like I saw them prep everybody for
[19:19.040 --> 19:22.840]  staging 911 then they staged it that's how I knew they were gonna do it I saw
[19:22.840 --> 19:27.280]  the prepping they're prepping well now they're gone past prepping they're
[19:27.280 --> 19:31.960]  launching the first salvos the first probes to test their propaganda and if
[19:31.960 --> 19:35.640]  they judge that this has been successful they're gonna launch massive terror
[19:35.640 --> 19:40.160]  attacks and blame it on us so stand by for impact stand by for bombardment

[26:02.040 --> 26:06.800]  then we're going to level six in the next week then I got some other phone
[26:06.800 --> 26:10.680]  calls called some other people I know and confirmed that the UN was already
[26:10.680 --> 26:14.320]  telling governments through the World Health Organization that they were in
[26:14.320 --> 26:18.880]  control of the planet and all governments that are signatories to
[26:18.880 --> 26:24.800]  World Health Organization rules and pandemic treaties now it's in hundreds
[26:24.800 --> 26:32.680]  and hundreds of newspapers AP Reuters news of Australia everywhere that oh yes

[26:41.000 --> 26:47.060]  following World Health Organization orders so the UN through this test as the
[26:47.060 --> 26:53.200]  SPP documents say that are in the film endgame they say we'll use pandemics
[26:53.200 --> 26:58.880]  biological threats terror attacks environmental problems greenhouse gases
[26:58.880 --> 27:02.960]  and economic collapse to bring in our North American Union and globalization

[27:07.880 --> 27:13.680]  they say they've merged the EU and the European Union it's all merged just like
[27:13.680 --> 27:18.800]  in England they haven't passed the treaty to sign on to Lisbon but the BBC
[27:18.800 --> 27:24.960]  admits Google headline in UK already under EU control and you'll see hundreds
[27:24.960 --> 27:29.200]  of articles telling the people yes remember when Jackie Smith the now
[27:29.200 --> 27:33.760]  resigned disgraced Gestapo agent over there who's surveilling everybody and
[27:33.760 --> 27:36.560]  banning free speech she went up for savage and said he was banned from
[27:36.560 --> 27:46.560]  coming to England if you read the fine print she said I'm following EU rules so
[27:46.560 --> 27:50.560]  yes ladies and gentlemen they're testing the swine flu vaccines they already had
[27:50.560 --> 27:55.200]  ready like Horowitz talked about it or Horowitz on this show he was right as
[27:55.200 --> 27:58.720]  usual I found it hard to believe but he was right again just like he fingered
[27:58.720 --> 28:04.320]  exactly who was behind the anthrax attack so the FBI came and harass him well he
[28:04.320 --> 28:07.240]  was right again
[28:08.400 --> 28:12.200]  he's got some interesting religious ideas I'll tell you that but separate from
[28:12.200 --> 28:24.520]  that he is a Harvard graduate doctor and he certainly was right and they
[28:24.520 --> 28:28.280]  certainly are saying first swine flu vaccine ready for testing Swiss drug
[28:28.280 --> 28:34.640]  giant Norvadas has completed a first batch of swine flu vaccine for pre
[28:34.640 --> 28:38.640]  clinical trials and aims to make a version available form September the
[28:38.640 --> 28:41.560]  company said yeah it's supposed to take six months to make these but they have
[28:41.560 --> 28:47.200]  it in two of course and it goes on but AP reports we for several days have been
[28:47.200 --> 28:50.720]  under level six and when you read deeper into all these articles they admit oh
[28:50.720 --> 28:55.240]  really from the start they had already implemented level six type preparations
[28:55.240 --> 28:59.720]  and so in an executive level level six is in place that's why we went under you

[29:15.040 --> 29:21.360]  injections oh we're pretty sure this fall that we're gonna have a massive
[29:21.360 --> 29:25.920]  outbreak and people are gonna die in mass probably in other hoax but getting

[33:48.440 --> 33:55.860]  The year is basically officially half-elapsed. We're halfway in. We're
[33:55.860 --> 34:01.640]  a couple days 2009 as soon as these years start seems like they're over it's
[34:01.640 --> 34:04.640]  like our lives are over in the twinkling of an eye what matters is our
[34:04.640 --> 34:11.280]  species should go on forever and we should build and honor creativity and
[34:11.280 --> 34:15.240]  decency and beauty you want to know what good is it's sweet little children
[34:15.240 --> 34:20.160]  playing in a sandbox it's happy little birds building a nest above your doorway
[34:20.160 --> 34:25.600]  it's beautiful forest and happiness and people making sacrifices for others it's
[34:25.600 --> 34:33.400]  truthfulness it's decency it's it's self-control we know what evil is it's
[34:33.400 --> 34:40.240]  smart bombs being dropped on civilian populations it's bondage it's surveillance
[34:40.240 --> 34:47.000]  it's control okay let me just launch in two news right now this is important
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.760]  because it's the first amendment issue and I've seen countless things like this
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.440]  I always mention a famous case it was in the newspapers it's hard for folks to
[34:54.440 --> 34:57.000]  believe this stuff till they see it in the newspaper but Kelly rushing lion
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.600]  counting Kentucky lion County Kentucky no criminal record family goes back to
[35:01.600 --> 35:06.080]  the founding of the county literally owns a business in town he gave a state
[35:06.080 --> 35:10.880]  police officer a video with Ron Paul at the front of it and my film wrote a
[35:10.880 --> 35:16.840]  tyranny on the end of it I guess on ultra slow player whatever he but he put
[35:16.840 --> 35:21.040]  like five hours on there of Ron Paul speeches and they charged him for the
[35:21.040 --> 35:24.520]  Ron Paul speech and for in game and it was in the newspaper I'm not in game
[35:24.520 --> 35:31.240]  I'm wrote a tyranny and it was in the news that he was charged and police
[35:31.240 --> 35:36.080]  believed that a speech on the House of Representatives is illegal and that my
[35:36.080 --> 35:40.560]  film is illegal and that it was threatening to police and anti law
[35:40.560 --> 35:44.160]  enforcement as they said in the trial the jury found him not guilty of two
[35:44.160 --> 35:50.240]  counts of terroristic threats that the film was a threat to police and I've
[35:50.240 --> 35:54.640]  seen countless people fired you're allowed to visit at lunch websites at
[35:54.640 --> 35:58.160]  Dell computers at least you were years ago when I saw these cases but if you
[35:58.160 --> 36:01.160]  visit info wars.com they don't block it out they want to know if you're
[36:01.160 --> 36:08.040]  visiting you're instantly fired and we had people on this happened to and they
[36:08.040 --> 36:12.560]  would say oh yes you're not allowed to visit hate sites gambling sites hacking
[36:12.560 --> 36:21.560]  sites and porn sites and my site was listed as hacking and hate and a lot of
[36:21.560 --> 36:25.080]  libraries and government systems block us out a lot of military systems not all
[36:25.080 --> 36:28.640]  of them though block info wars.com prison planet.com a lot of them don't have
[36:28.640 --> 36:33.120]  Jones report.com or truth news.us or prison planet.tv or some of the other
[36:33.120 --> 36:37.640]  auxiliary backup sites listed that's why we have those one of the reasons or what
[36:37.640 --> 36:44.080]  is the end game.com or martial law 9-1-1.info we're always launching more
[36:44.080 --> 36:48.200]  as their sentinels try to blast us in the matrix and stop us from getting the
[36:48.200 --> 36:59.600]  signal out but you can't stop the signal mail as they say in serenity but
[36:59.600 --> 37:09.400]  fired because of end game this is Amy I believe Raban and Lisa Livgren
[37:09.400 --> 37:13.400]  about pronouncing that right Bill of Rights amendment one of the Constitution
[37:13.400 --> 37:15.840]  States Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
[37:15.840 --> 37:18.880]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom
[37:18.880 --> 37:22.240]  of speech or the press or the right of the people to peaceably to assemble and
[37:22.240 --> 37:26.640]  to petition the government for redress of grievance. The first amendment was not
[37:26.640 --> 37:32.400]  meant to cover only polite speech but more so disagreeable speech or
[37:32.400 --> 37:37.400]  threatening speech or scary speech. I would add lately in this country it has
[37:37.400 --> 37:41.640]  been hard to freely voice one's opinions you have to look in dark corners
[37:41.640 --> 37:45.760]  where the media has shunned in order to find a voice that speaks the truth it
[37:45.760 --> 37:50.640]  seems that the moment you say or think a word you get added to a list or censored
[37:50.640 --> 37:54.400]  immediately or put in a free speech zone which now is five miles away from the
[37:54.400 --> 37:59.680]  event. Two weeks ago we worked as custodians at a pharmaceutical
[37:59.680 --> 38:05.840]  distribution company well yeah probably a eugenics black op that's why there was
[38:05.840 --> 38:10.400]  no dress code and we worked after hours when there were little to no people around
[38:10.400 --> 38:15.400]  we were constantly told what a fantastic job we were doing until the day of the
[38:15.400 --> 38:19.560]  t-shirt incident I told you I wore our Minuteman t-shirt that just says live
[38:19.560 --> 38:24.320]  free or die into a grocery store at like 9 30 at night in a small town and
[38:24.320 --> 38:29.120]  few weeks ago and I had the security guard while I was sitting there looking
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.640]  at paper and pens he walked up act like he was shopping and then he looked at
[38:33.640 --> 38:36.800]  me and then walked right up like I wasn't human and looked at my shirt because
[38:36.800 --> 38:40.480]  I was still facing the products and then he looked at the front looked at the
[38:40.480 --> 38:45.400]  back and kind of watched me in there this is the way America operates you
[38:45.400 --> 38:48.120]  don't have a Minuteman on your shirt that's like having some have been
[38:48.120 --> 38:54.600]  laden on your shirt we wore an in-game t-shirt to work as they made one there
[38:54.600 --> 38:57.720]  was absolutely nothing offensive about the t-shirt yet we had offered a couple
[38:57.720 --> 39:04.520]  of fuzzy Birkenstock wearing women who had pictures of Obama and family plaster
[39:04.520 --> 39:10.080]  all over their desk they had offended a couple of fuzzy Birkenstock wearing
[39:10.080 --> 39:13.720]  women you know they would love to throw you probably in a pit they thought it
[39:13.720 --> 39:16.000]  would and shoot you in the back of the head of they thought it would bring in
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.720]  their lovely world government they'd get some free goodies oh Obama he's I don't
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.400]  have to pay my rent anymore pay for my car payment he everything's fixed but
[39:24.400 --> 39:29.000]  then it'll be oh the people are holding back Obama if we've got to get rid of
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.520]  the people that are in the way of our great leader our dear leader the great
[39:32.520 --> 39:38.440]  leader the special leader and then he'll be able to fix it the front of the shirt
[39:38.440 --> 39:40.960]  said in game blueprint for global enslavement the back of the shirt had a
[39:40.960 --> 39:46.320]  quote in the documentary that said we are not your slaves we were fired for
[39:46.320 --> 39:50.560]  wearing yeah we're not your slaves but you don't wear that we're not your
[39:50.560 --> 39:56.280]  slaves whoa whoa that'll really get a slave master man we were fired for
[39:56.280 --> 40:02.400]  wearing our opinion on a t-shirt before the t-shirt incident we knew freedom of
[40:02.400 --> 40:07.120]  speech that already started to diminish we now know for sure that it is nearly
[40:07.120 --> 40:11.720]  a thing of the past we continued the fight for free speech and truth we
[40:11.720 --> 40:15.440]  also continue to wear our in-game t-shirts to show our support for the
[40:15.440 --> 40:21.520]  documentary we may not have lived in the days of our founding fathers but we
[40:21.520 --> 40:26.640]  know that this country is not what it used to be the to end it all here is a
[40:26.640 --> 40:31.280]  quote from Benjamin Franklin outside of Independence Hall when the
[40:31.280 --> 40:35.320]  constitutional convention of 1787 ended Mr. Powell of Philadelphia asked
[40:35.320 --> 40:42.600]  Benjamin Franklin well doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy with no
[40:42.600 --> 40:50.000]  hesitation whatsoever Franklin responded a republic if you can keep it and some
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.520]  will argue well you know this is a company they're allowed to fire an hour
[40:53.520 --> 40:57.760]  they want and they are but see you can wear an Obama shirt you can wear a
[40:57.760 --> 41:01.480]  George W. Bush or McCain shirt you can wear a NASCAR shirt you can wear a
[41:01.480 --> 41:09.240]  Walmart shirt you can wear probably a playboy bunny shirt but you don't wear a
[41:09.240 --> 41:15.560]  shirt saying we're not your slaves in game those people who tattled on you
[41:15.560 --> 41:21.000]  went and looked that up and they went on like a first-grader tattling and they
[41:21.000 --> 41:28.080]  were ran and they said listen listen they're wearing these shirts and the
[41:28.080 --> 41:31.760]  security guards pulled up tape looked it up and said and they went and told
[41:31.760 --> 41:36.080]  executives and they said we've got Alex Jones people in the building fire them
[41:36.080 --> 41:41.840]  security breach you work for a pharmaceutical facility of course in
[41:41.840 --> 41:49.800]  game exposes them I commend you and I salute you but you know I think it's
[41:49.800 --> 41:56.280]  better to use the enemy's money work in their complexes surveil them for any
[41:56.280 --> 42:00.800]  criminal activity to report out to the outside and then on the weekend or when
[42:00.800 --> 42:04.960]  you go to the store where the in game shirts and pass out cards within game
[42:04.960 --> 42:08.680]  blueprint for global enslavement info wars calm on the radio show or the
[42:08.680 --> 42:16.120]  podcast or whatever you'd like put a lot of stuff on a little business card and
[42:16.120 --> 42:24.840]  then compartmentalize what you're doing I would say protect your jobs use the
[42:24.840 --> 42:30.160]  enemy's money against them and then use the money you're making from that to
[42:30.160 --> 42:34.920]  separately fight the enemy outside that sector of the matrix but you can do what
[42:34.920 --> 42:41.400]  you want but I commend you and I salute you speaking of drug makers you know I
[42:41.400 --> 42:45.080]  mentioned this a month ago and then last night Jason Burmer's brought it back up
[42:45.080 --> 42:51.200]  to my attention April 1st 2009 Vioxx maker Merck and company drew up a doctor
[42:51.200 --> 42:57.600]  hit list and this is in the news.co.au big news over in Australia it was also in
[42:57.600 --> 43:02.720]  the AP over here and it says a hit list US drug maker Merck and Co is accused of
[43:02.720 --> 43:08.640]  targeting critical researchers file companies accused of targeting critics an
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.560]  internal drug company made a hit list of doctors who had to be neutralized that
[43:13.560 --> 43:18.200]  means killed just like the Pentagon they found documents saying neutralized
[43:18.200 --> 43:22.040]  reporters in the US and outside people said oh they don't mean kill and now
[43:22.040 --> 43:25.640]  they're coming out going no we mean we're gonna kill you we're gonna send a hit
[43:25.640 --> 43:28.840]  squad by we're gonna shoot you in your front yard and let all your neighbors
[43:28.840 --> 43:33.320]  know we're gonna kill newspaper reporters in America because that's freedom
[43:33.320 --> 43:37.080]  these are open criminals if they're gonna kill a million plus Iraqis and
[43:37.080 --> 43:41.240]  they're gonna use DU all over the planet including in the US that kills
[43:41.240 --> 43:46.120]  themselves they certainly don't care about you these are mind controlled
[43:46.120 --> 43:50.200]  zombies not your average military people but the zombies they send to kill
[43:50.200 --> 43:54.080]  you the only reason they're not killing us ladies and gentlemen they know
[43:54.080 --> 43:57.760]  there's too many of us they don't want to highlight everything we've done
[43:57.760 --> 44:05.440]  everything we said and also because they know we're peaceful we are changed in
[44:05.440 --> 44:08.680]  9-11 truth and other Liberty Group sprouting up everywhere every time
[44:08.680 --> 44:12.240]  Bernanke goes somewhere they say hey why'd you go to Bilderberg where's the
[44:12.240 --> 44:15.400]  money why is it secret why haven't you been audited and then the media picks up
[44:15.400 --> 44:20.360]  on it great work of we are changed Illinois I just want to salute the
[44:20.360 --> 44:23.920]  folks that called in your stay I got to get them on as guests and just amazing
[44:23.920 --> 44:26.200]  people
[44:29.400 --> 44:35.520]  absolutely amazing but you see Bernanke looked focused look serious but also
[44:35.520 --> 44:40.040]  looked scared but also looked aggressive and you and when he looked at him he
[44:40.040 --> 44:43.560]  looked at him like man you know who I am you know that we murder whole third
[44:43.560 --> 44:47.520]  world countries but you can see you can see the thought process in his eyes
[44:47.520 --> 44:50.840]  it's powerful video they say a picture tells a thousand words well these 15
[44:50.840 --> 44:54.600]  20 seconds with that camera right in his face he's sitting there thinking have I
[44:54.600 --> 44:57.600]  have these people struck down or in prison it's just gonna make them martyrs
[44:57.600 --> 45:01.120]  and then people will start getting aggressive and they'll take the gloves
[45:01.120 --> 45:05.080]  off physically with me and he's realizing the tides turned and even if
[45:05.080 --> 45:08.760]  they strike at us violently that only brings it into a realm they don't want
[45:08.760 --> 45:12.320]  to enter and now they're beginning to instinctively realize we're committed
[45:12.320 --> 45:15.680]  no matter what happens we're throwing ourselves into the works of the enemy
[45:15.680 --> 45:19.880]  juggernaut and we are a juggernaut that is more powerful and filled with truth
[45:19.880 --> 45:28.280]  and light and love and they're scared the arrogance the smiling demonic
[45:28.280 --> 45:32.920]  enjoyment has left almost all their faces except for Glenn Beck
[45:33.440 --> 45:39.080]  man where they find these creatures but Bernanke and the Rothschilds and the
[45:39.080 --> 45:42.760]  Rockefellers they're not having fun now they're trying to survive now they're
[45:42.760 --> 45:47.920]  trying to keep control of what they got now and it's because we're committed
[45:47.920 --> 45:55.400]  under death that's something it's hard to deal with and ladies and gentlemen I
[45:55.400 --> 45:58.360]  will say this only because I don't want it to hurt the work we've been doing
[45:58.360 --> 46:05.280]  that I'm gonna get into more news I am getting a lot of death threats my
[46:05.280 --> 46:10.720]  family's being attacked distant family relations are being attacked it's
[46:10.720 --> 46:14.120]  certainly a sigh of no doubt about that it's governmental we've confirmed a lot
[46:14.120 --> 46:17.640]  of it is than others it's just part of the sixth society and things breaking
[46:17.640 --> 46:20.360]  down but the attacks are really intensifying and the lies that I'm a
[46:20.360 --> 46:25.880]  murderer now or that I'm a government agent or I'm this or I'm that I mean it
[46:25.880 --> 46:30.800]  really gets insane and I expect to launch even more egregious and insane
[46:30.800 --> 46:36.800]  attacks and we need your prayers more importantly that even your financial
[46:36.800 --> 46:39.680]  support with the info wars money bomb we've got going on to the rest of the
[46:39.680 --> 46:45.120]  day and for you to spread the war we've got to become even bigger and more in
[46:45.120 --> 46:49.000]  the spotlight and more out in the open you know that's what mr. Garrison
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.160]  believe and so many others believe being prominent in being out in the opens
[46:52.160 --> 46:56.000]  the way to go so many other people out there who've only on partially public
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.360]  like when I told the DC madam she went public all over radio and TV for six
[47:00.360 --> 47:04.320]  months and I got her on I said you better release it all they're gonna kill you and
[47:04.320 --> 47:06.960]  she said well I know they're following me and they may kill me but I don't think
[47:06.960 --> 47:10.600]  they will well they did and we had her landlord on and documented how she
[47:10.600 --> 47:15.120]  wasn't planning to kill herself and so they were after it's not fun trying to
[47:15.120 --> 47:19.000]  face that type of stuff down or Barry Jennings didn't go completely public we
[47:19.000 --> 47:24.880]  though believe he's in the witness protection program now but and many
[47:24.880 --> 47:29.480]  other people have been killed by these folks need to go public go all the way
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.160]  public that's what protects you but I am in the eye of the storm there is no
[47:33.160 --> 47:36.320]  doubting that and so is Ron Paul Ron Paul said here a month ago I didn't get
[47:36.320 --> 47:44.920]  time to ask him two days ago on the show Ron Paul said on this show that that he
[47:44.920 --> 47:50.920]  knows his life's in danger I can't imagine the crap he goes through this
[47:50.920 --> 47:55.360]  stuff I go through he's smart though he doesn't talk about it that much but but
[47:55.360 --> 48:01.640]  it is important just to let people know out there that it's going on and I just
[48:01.640 --> 48:07.120]  put it in God's hands and I know I have a great responsibility with how many
[48:07.120 --> 48:10.040]  people are listening and tuning in and checking out what we're saying and that
[48:10.040 --> 48:15.720]  our information is going mega viral supernova exponentially and I just put it
[48:15.720 --> 48:18.880]  in God's hands because a lot of people psychologically couldn't deal with the
[48:18.880 --> 48:22.240]  level of stress I'm under or the things I face every day and I just want to
[48:22.240 --> 48:26.320]  commend my jovial crew and all the supporters everybody that is on the
[48:26.320 --> 48:30.560]  same team it's just it's just great working with you and knowing you and
[48:30.560 --> 48:33.520]  all of you out there that have supported us from my heart to your heart from my
[48:33.520 --> 48:37.880]  soul to your soul thank you all because we've done amazing things we've done
[48:37.880 --> 48:41.120]  incredible things and we are now the number one group being targeted you know
[48:41.120 --> 48:44.280]  they demonize Iraq before they attack it they demonize Serbia before they
[48:44.280 --> 48:47.680]  attack it and domestically they demonize groups who are their number one
[48:47.680 --> 48:53.040]  threat and they're attacking me and Ron Paul and others because of you because
[48:53.040 --> 48:57.040]  you have power and you're moving and you're taking action and we're setting
[48:57.040 --> 48:59.440]  bushfires the minds of men women everywhere and teaching them they can
[48:59.440 --> 49:07.520]  take action and the crimes of this elite are coming out an international drug
[49:07.520 --> 49:13.080]  company made a hit list of doctors who had to be neutralized killed or
[49:13.080 --> 49:16.480]  discredited that's what I've said you know I better be glad they're just trying
[49:16.480 --> 49:20.120]  to discredit me because that generally means they're not going to kill you but
[49:20.120 --> 49:23.280]  sometimes they super discredit you know they think they want discrediting you
[49:23.280 --> 49:31.360]  then they kill you I just hope all my enemies who I know are wrong about me

[49:34.480 --> 49:37.880]  many of them in our own government payroll I really hope if they do kill me
[49:37.880 --> 49:41.240]  that you don't then attack me when I'm dead and say oh they got rid of their
[49:41.240 --> 49:46.920]  agent or something because who I am is a symbol now whether people like it or
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.000]  not a figurehead for liberty and freedom and they want to destroy that idea and
[49:51.000 --> 49:58.520]  destroy who I am and I now stand in the dock judged by the world pilloried

[58:08.320 --> 58:11.840]  used by 80 million people worldwide because it did not cause stomach problems

[1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:39.520]  forward briskly and in a healthy fashion against the New World Order tiny as we
[1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:45.440]  may be we are a projectile speeding through the flesh of the New World Order
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:50.520]  towards its heart burrowing our way at light speed thanks to you and when you

[1:01:53.960 --> 1:02:01.000]  speak out we are all in this together you accelerate our trajectory now we've
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:05.360]  got Bob Chapman with us for the full hour and I appreciate him coming on we've
[1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:12.600]  got Kim trail news a lot of police state news but the AP announced two days ago
[1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:17.040]  that the feds aren't just going to take over the banks not just taking over
[1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:23.400]  Chrysler and GM and then handing it over to select globalist families they are
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:29.000]  now going to tell many other types of companies and industries what you can be
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  paid what you can do and the federal government is openly now just ordering
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:39.680]  companies individuals around in a totally managed economy but not even
[1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:42.800]  managed to help society which would be bad enough that always fails because
[1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:47.440]  corruption is involved but openly to conduit the money out of the country
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:51.200]  this is the whole homeland security grid is meant to squeeze every drop of blood
[1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:56.880]  out of this nation what we've laughed about happening to third world countries
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:00.440]  feeling like we were part of the empire and ha ha ha is a lot of good old boys
[1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:07.080]  do even low-level ones is now going to happen to us unless we stop them but
[1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:11.040]  now with the von brun thing the more I look at it he been in federal custody
[1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:14.920]  six years from his last anac the way the feds like to work is they'll shoot a
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:19.080]  couple people shoot brown brain damaging so he can't ever talking in kill the
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:22.920]  guard that's the Russians have been caught doing that it's a favorite trick
[1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:26.640]  and because it came right on time and the Federal Reserve is about to be
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:30.640]  audited and I just read these internal emails out of federal courts about
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:37.240]  viox saying the owners of viox and go out and liquidate kill seek and destroy
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:40.880]  doctors and people that criticize them so this is how big corporations act I
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:43.960]  wanted to get Bob Chapman's take on that and then the economy but Bob good to
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:50.560]  have you here with us well thank you it's good to be back again Bob we got
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:53.680]  about a minute but my point there about von brun I'm gonna come back and talk
[1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:56.400]  more about this but what do you what do you see happening there do you smell a
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:04:01.360]  big fat gigantic stinking rat well I think there's a good chance of it we're
[1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:06.360]  not on the inside so we don't know for sure but it's like everything else we
[1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:11.920]  have to back into it and in so doing we have to hope that our appraisal of what
[1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:16.080]  went on is correct so we'll just have to wait and see but that's a good
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:27.360]  possibility this business with the the 1207 which is the Ron Paul bill is
[1:04:27.360 --> 1:04:34.120]  has become enormously powerful is I know you're up to date on it but I want you
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:37.960]  to fill us in with your your angle on it I mean do we realize the success we're
[1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:44.800]  having we should do we have to believe in ourselves to be winners stay with us
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:47.680]  Bob Chapman let's break that down right now and how you see the enemy coming
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:52.720]  after us we're trying to kick out the foreign alien private banking government
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:57.120]  the the corporate takeover the criminals the illegitimate criminals that need to
[1:04:57.120 --> 1:05:02.800]  be thrown in irons this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a

[1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:33.720]  donations are still coming in wrap it up over the weekend the info wars money
[1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:40.560]  bomb info wars money mom.com now reach $225,000 of donations in the last 24
[1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:48.040]  hours started at 11 a.m. yesterday we're now 25 hours in and last time it took
[1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:53.080]  three days to hit 225,000 I think we'll do it in a day and a half this time so
[1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:56.200]  I want to commend all of you that will help us move into an even larger studio
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:00.880]  next door expand what we're doing and it will allow us to put a generator on the
[1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:04.120]  roof so we don't have the power go off because the power goes off sometimes
[1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:08.520]  we're in this industrial park and then the batteries on the backup systems
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:15.040]  run out as they did two days ago. The power was out to large parts of Austin
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:19.000]  last night but thank God not here with incredible storms that hit so a lot of
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:24.680]  things going on we thank you for your support with the 2009 info wars money
[1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:28.280]  bomb and still not too late to get involved in that and I do want to hit
[1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:32.560]  the goal of 250,000 by the end of the show today let's see if we can do it and
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:36.800]  go past what we did last year that will certainly anger the critics and that's
[1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:42.080]  also important now see there I am being bad I'm trying to not be as worldly and
[1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:46.240]  aggressive and competitive trying to do this purely focused to defeat the new
[1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:51.480]  world order but humans that said or dog like and horse like you ever seen how
[1:09:51.480 --> 1:09:55.520]  competitive horses are with each other when they're out in the field racing
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:10:03.640]  each other. Here's the deal Obama oust AmeriCorps head who investigated
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:08.720]  friend they've also fired the head of cybersecurity two months ago it's now
[1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:12.360]  come out the head of cybersecurity is under a gag order but before he was
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:15.240]  under the gag order which I think violates his free speech their
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:19.520]  signature security he said the NSA and military are taking over the entire
[1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:23.960]  internet and they are so they can quote shut it down for your safety that's the
[1:10:23.960 --> 1:10:30.960]  headline I mean this is really happening and talk about corruption
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:34.400]  president Barack Obama says he lost confidence in the inspector general
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:37.640]  investigates AmeriCorps and other national service programs and has told
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:41.120]  Congress he's removing him from position I guess he didn't get enough kids and
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:44.960]  red and black uniforms to march around chanting his name as they now have in
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:49.840]  their own federal TV ads paid for with taxpayer money to recruit private people
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:54.240]  to work for the Democratic Party I mean this is all completely illegal the
[1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:57.600]  general accounting offices on record when Bush was trying in and now Obama is
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:02.320]  doing it also the United Nations has announced their new list of international
[1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:05.520]  terrorists and gun owners counterterrorism database goes live it's a
[1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:10.800]  global my act slash homeland security report will break that down but let's go
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:13.600]  back to Bob Chapman the international forecaster dot com for those that don't
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:18.640]  know who Bob is we've got a lot of new big stations picking us up like I wrote
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:20.880]  it down Ted came in and told me the station that picked us up yesterday
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:24.840]  it's one of the biggest in LA and then everybody was marveling here in the
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:29.920]  office because Cindy Sheehan used to live there and knows the station k r l a h
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:34.400]  70 is picking up the Sunday show for starters a lot of stations are kind of
[1:11:34.400 --> 1:11:37.520]  putting their toe in the water picking up that Sunday show it's like I think 10
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:40.440]  new stations the last month so we got a lot of new listeners let me just
[1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:43.640]  introduce Bob Chapman Bob before I get into the last question about Von
[1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:47.680]  Baroon and whether it's staged or not they're hyping it like this swine flu
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:50.880]  basically you know one death it's the end of the world one death give up all
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:56.080]  your rights hand in your guns MSNBC says Von Baroon loves Ron Paul Ron Paul is
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:12:00.720]  basically evil now I'm evil they're attacking me anybody who doesn't like the
[1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:04.680]  Federal Reserve wants to audit it is a white supremacist before we get into
[1:12:04.680 --> 1:12:11.440]  that tell folks briefly about Bob Chapman well I was a stockbroker for 28
[1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:15.840]  years specializing in golden silver shares on my own firm for many years and
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:20.600]  I retired and I decided that I didn't like retirement so I've been writing the
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:25.560]  international forecaster for the past 20 years and I've lived over probably
[1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:29.920]  half the world I speak several languages I worked in Army color counter
[1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:37.160]  intelligence for several years and I think I've had one heck of an interesting
[1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:45.480]  life and the adventure is not over yet isn't my friend no it's not and I've
[1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:51.120]  been working for the last three months as you know on the mainline media mostly
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:13:02.520]  getting the word out on 1207 and I think the figure now is 222 cosponses for
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:08.720]  that bill and so that means it gets voted on and in all probability past so I
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:14.920]  guess that the the Federal Reserve will probably concentrate on trying to
[1:13:14.920 --> 1:13:20.280]  defeat the bill in the Senate and that's why they hired the former head of the
[1:13:20.280 --> 1:13:30.680]  Enron lobbying contingent a lady Mrs. Robinson and evidently they expect that
[1:13:30.680 --> 1:13:36.680]  they're going to be able to perhaps stop the bill in the Senate the Senate bill
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:42.640]  has been just sitting there waiting to see what happened to the House and we've
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:48.280]  done a good job in informing the people in the house so s604 which is the
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:55.720]  Federal Reserve Sunshine Act of 2009 sponsored by Bernard Sanders of Vermont
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:14:02.440]  they should be our next target we should go to all the senators and tell them we
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:08.280]  want the bill passed so that we can have an investigation and an audit of what
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:12.800]  the Federal Reserve has been doing and when the public finds out what they've
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:16.640]  been doing they're not going to be very happy about it plus their obvious
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:23.960]  failures I saw Larry Summers this morning on CNBC telling us all these
[1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:27.960]  kind of things are normal and to be expected but we have to remember that
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:31.600]  the Federal Reserve was created to do away with all these things starting in
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:37.240]  1913 these horrible depressions and recessions and panics that we had during
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:42.880]  the late 1880s and so they haven't done that they've done a terrible visual job
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:49.280]  and so I want to see that we get rid of them and I think that that could start
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:54.200]  us on our way back at least economically and financially from where we're at but
[1:14:54.200 --> 1:15:00.840]  I do believe that we will desperately need legislation which will
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:07.320]  institute tariffs on goods and services and it's going to be very important
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:12.800]  because we got to stop the transnational conglomerates from sucking all the jobs
[1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:20.160]  out of the United States we've already lost from a number of ways approximately
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:24.920]  14 million jobs over the last eight years and about six million of them can
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:30.600]  be directly attributed to free trade globalization offshoring and outsourcing
[1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:35.400]  and Bob Bob the facts are in for those that go oh this isn't free market
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:39.520]  ladies and gentlemen the globalist aren't free market they admit it's not
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:43.560]  meant to have a good vibrant economy everything is to consolidate power in
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:47.880]  their hands and that's what they've set up with tax incentives to move overseas
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:53.800]  that all these environmental rules and taxes on companies that stay here so
[1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:58.320]  they can't stay in business and and and regulations on mining and timber and
[1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:02.440]  everything else it is designed as a form of mercantilism of those that don't know
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:07.320]  under the old French system adopted by the British of mercantilism they would
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:12.200]  only allow their holdings or their colonial slave empires to develop raw
[1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:16.440]  materials and then they would take back goods to the mother country that they
[1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:22.440]  controlled to have the value added goods or durable goods or or manufactured
[1:16:22.440 --> 1:16:27.200]  items and they stated on record you know in their parliaments and in their
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:29.880]  palaces this is all part of history for those that don't know and Bob I'd like
[1:16:29.880 --> 1:16:33.600]  you to speak to this that it was done to keep control over the slave grids well
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:37.720]  now this mercantilism they move the factories to slave countries where the
[1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:41.440]  people are too poor to ever get any of the products to ever do business back
[1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:45.120]  with another nation and it's meant to vertically integrate this is not a free
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:49.600]  market this is the private banks financing the criminal consolidation so
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:52.480]  they can bankrupt again everybody dependent on government to then carry
[1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:58.360]  out the eugenics operation and on top of that most people don't realize that the
[1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:03.360]  profits that are being made by these transnational conglomerates are going to
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:08.320]  offshore locations like the Cayman Islands and if they don't repatriate
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:15.000]  the cat at the Capitol they pay about a 2% tax the back four years ago there
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:21.680]  was legislation and the legislation said that these offshore corporations could
[1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:27.800]  bring their money back if they chose but that was to create jobs well they they
[1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:33.480]  they got the legislation jobs were never created they moved three hundred and
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:39.960]  fifty billion dollars back into the United States at not a 35% tax rate but
[1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:45.200]  a five and a quarter percent tax rate and now they have seven hundred billion
[1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:49.640]  dollars offshore they want to bring that back in they haven't said anything
[1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:54.560]  about a tax rate but I'm sure they're gonna try to get the same kind of deal
[1:17:54.560 --> 1:18:00.400]  and all this is a subsidization of the rich that's right they call it getting
[1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:05.080]  rid of tax shelters but really it's just like the tax-free foundations in 1906
[1:18:05.080 --> 1:18:08.840]  was billed as a way to defeat the the robber barons it really made their money
[1:18:08.840 --> 1:18:15.920]  private go into these foundations so that it was completely you know protected
[1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:20.040]  and couldn't be investigated and they use that to further consolidate their
[1:18:20.040 --> 1:18:23.840]  power to the Carnegie Endowment the Rockefeller Endowment and others and
[1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:27.120]  of course they were all eugenicists at the time and their their sons are now in
[1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:30.640]  control now the elderly David Rockefeller and others and so it's still
[1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:37.000]  the same mindset still the same program Bob Chapman getting back to Mr. Von
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:43.360]  Brun in this shooting and HR 1207 225 sponsors now going to the floor in the
[1:18:43.360 --> 1:18:48.920]  next week or so and the COINTELPRO operation from the establishment I've
[1:18:48.920 --> 1:18:52.480]  noticed the last few years when this has been building is oh they just want to
[1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:56.840]  audit the Fed so they can set up a new bank of the world destroy the Fed and
[1:18:56.840 --> 1:19:02.040]  set up a new bank of the world no if you audit the Fed it is a tentacle or a
[1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:09.080]  proboscis a suction vehicle to the big Anglo-American slash European complex
[1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:12.000]  banking complex I want your take on this when we get back Bob your analysis
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:16.880]  with Bob Chapman and so if you break open the door of the bankers you show the
[1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:20.400]  crime of private central banking and the fraud it then brings down the whole
[1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:24.720]  system so it's it's it's it's part and parcel it's like an arm of the new world
[1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:28.920]  order so so they're saying oh don't investigate the arm because then you'll
[1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:32.120]  put the rest of the body in control certainly if we start beating them
[1:19:32.120 --> 1:19:36.000]  they're gonna try to spin it into that but that's not what's happening here and
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:39.400]  so despite the fact that people inside our movement with the government op
[1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:44.800]  tried to stop what we were doing we're marching forward and even if this fails
[1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:49.360]  and they have a little fake celebration it is going to be short-lived because now

[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:44.240]  okay going back to Bob Chavin Bob specifically the point I'm making and I
[1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:49.920]  won't hear your view on this is it's all coming to a head we're having this
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:54.200]  incredible victory we have to recognize we have power we have to recognize we
[1:24:54.200 --> 1:24:57.880]  have destiny we have to believe it and image it and move forward knowing we're
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:02.120]  right and knowing we don't have a choice we are under scientific bondage of a
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:05.080]  group of private offshore banks that have engaged in a corporate takeover of
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:09.440]  the US they probably would have gotten away with it but they're so greedy that
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:12.640]  they're looting and stealing everything thinking homeland security and North
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:16.720]  com can protect them in it they plan to bring us into a greater crisis so they
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:21.160]  can have a clamp down we have their own documents but now we're fighting back
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:25.520]  Ron Paul's risking his life we've supported him the people called for
[1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:28.480]  months by the thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of
[1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:33.440]  Washington on record we now at the 225 it's gonna go to the floor it's got a
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:37.160]  good chance of passing and even if it doesn't people are gonna have to defend
[1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:40.520]  why this groups above the law why they can't be investigated and Congress
[1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:46.480]  separately as you know Bob is now subpoenaing the Fed saying you will tell
[1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:49.600]  us where the Bank of America money went you will tell us where the billions
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:53.680]  went you will tell us with 300 billion went on that you will tell us why you
[1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:58.200]  ordered the CEO to buy another bank that what that was healthy you will tell us
[1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:01.320]  well because there's stockholders the Rockefellers and others over Bank of
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:06.240]  America they're getting the profit it's always about the CEOs but the CEOs Bob
[1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:09.280]  aren't they literally like the kind of like the Pirate sent out by the Pirate
[1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:13.920]  King and he gets flayed alive if he doesn't do what he's told I mean aren't
[1:26:13.920 --> 1:26:19.280]  these CEOs just diversions from the real power we might call them the
[1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:23.720]  mercenaries and that's exactly what they are and it's like the presidents that
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:28.080]  we get for the country they're simply mercenaries to do what they're told to
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:35.680]  do but harking back to what you spoke of just before the break this piece of
[1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:43.200]  legislation which I think will pass in the house is probably the biggest thing
[1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:50.760]  that's happened to bring the American people together and to attack the real
[1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:56.480]  problem the underlying problem with our economic and financial being and it is
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:27:01.840]  the Federal Reserve and you alluded to this before and of course for the British
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:07.680]  the Bank of England that is another private organization upon which the
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:12.880]  Federal Reserve was modeled and we're getting the word out we're making people
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:20.620]  understand who is doing it to them who is robbing them who is corrupt it's the
[1:27:20.620 --> 1:27:26.520]  guys in the four thousand three thousand dollar suits that's who it is and what
[1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:31.080]  is g.i. josei what does g.i. josei knowing is half the battle we are now
[1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:35.680]  identifying the enemy identifying the illegitimate criminals and once we've
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:39.240]  educated the public we win that's why they're gonna have the stage events and
[1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:43.640]  say it's anti-Semitic to not want the Federal Reserve and they're gonna make
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:48.080]  it racial and religious and inject that in the middle of it and it's not gonna
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:53.680]  work it's just isn't going to work and that was foolish of them to do that but
[1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:58.760]  that's okay if that's what they want to do that's fine as you say we're going
[1:27:58.760 --> 1:28:05.280]  toe-to-toe and head-to-head the right thing at the right time and you know
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:09.680]  congressman McFadden would have been successful if they hadn't murdered him and
[1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:14.520]  so this time we're really going to take a shot and because it's not only Ron
[1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:19.440]  Paul there's all of these people surrounding him Americans of all
[1:28:19.440 --> 1:28:26.200]  stripes so to speak politically and otherwise America's coming together like
[1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:30.680]  Anthony J. Hilder and I discussed in this program before he and I have been
[1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:35.680]  fighting for years to make this happen and it's happening brought together by
[1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:41.000]  economic and financial events Bob it's got to feel good to you to the
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:44.760]  sacrifices the attacks you've even been driven out of this country by these
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:49.640]  criminals you know your choice so you could operate not be stopped by them
[1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:52.760]  because they're scared of you it's got to feel good though to see we've come this
[1:28:52.760 --> 1:28:59.280]  far and to feel the momentum shifting you can you can feel it and smell it
[1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:04.400]  these they're terrified that the world is going to find out what they're doing
[1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:09.960]  and every morning when we start at 3 30 or 4 o'clock in the morning doing the
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:16.120]  emails they're in from Australia and Malaysia and Japan and and we and we
[1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:22.880]  make the gamut we they start coming in from Latvia Kazakhstan and so on and so
[1:29:22.880 --> 1:29:28.080]  forth people are listening to these programs all over the world and we are
[1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:33.120]  drilling these people that's right and we can't be stopped because Bob you and
[1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:36.080]  I and all the rest of us that are committed like you said we're not

[1:33:54.000 --> 1:34:01.720]  Andrew Jackson they tried to kill probably did kill George Washington just
[1:34:01.720 --> 1:34:07.560]  as a figurehead because he was speaking out against it this is on record in the

[1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:49.600]  where the film we carry the money masters three hours long breaks it all
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:54.200]  down but the general public may not what do you expect to see the globalist dude
[1:34:54.200 --> 1:34:58.040]  to try to stop this I mean more stage shootings or hyping real shootings or
[1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:02.320]  more my act reports demonizing in the Fed groups they admit they have the army
[1:35:02.320 --> 1:35:05.920]  spying on us myself included when I protest them where do you see this
[1:35:05.920 --> 1:35:11.400]  going well I think we're gonna get a lot more of the same and they'll get more
[1:35:11.400 --> 1:35:16.000]  aggressive and we'll just have to get more aggressive and get more time
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:21.560]  on more stations throughout the world and yet they're getting heat not only in
[1:35:21.560 --> 1:35:24.840]  the United States they're getting it all over the world and that's very
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:28.560]  important because you know they're throwing their hands up in the air like
[1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:31.960]  they did three weeks ago at the Bilderberger meeting and they said I
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:37.120]  think that the major problem that we got here that we've got to solve is that
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:41.240]  what we've created which is this financial and economic collapse that we're
[1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:48.840]  trying to bring into being in the way that we wanted to so that we can get
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:55.400]  full control is spinning out of control away from us and we think that maybe we
[1:35:55.400 --> 1:36:03.200]  should bring this thing in so we can control it and they I don't know what
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:08.200]  whether they're in the process of trying to do that but as they would try to do
[1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:13.800]  that they would have to create all of these deflections to get people's
[1:36:13.800 --> 1:36:18.560]  thought patterns and and the things that they're doing off on something else
[1:36:18.560 --> 1:36:27.040]  like the North Korean shooting missiles the situation that exists in Iraq and
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:33.160]  Afghanistan and will they go into Pakistan will Israel attack Iran and
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:38.800]  these are the the things that they do to keep us our mind off the subject and
[1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:44.320]  the subject is very important because they're getting discovered and this is
[1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:49.200]  what Ron Paul has done with this legislation and even if we were to be
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:55.280]  defeated millions and millions of people worldwide who now can identify who the
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:37:00.040]  enemy is and it's going to be legislation like this in all three
[1:37:00.040 --> 1:37:06.320]  countries of the world I mean what we're doing is changing history and it's
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:11.840]  happened over and over again it's the right event at the right time they are
[1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:21.440]  vulnerable because they have put this financial and economic situation mobile
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:26.120]  they are making it happen and it's worldwide it's not only in America and
[1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:30.440]  it's to bring the world to its knees so they can be forced to accept world
[1:37:30.440 --> 1:37:34.560]  government and so they're going to continue to do what they're doing with
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:39.640]  all the spying and picking people up and the violence and and the acts that they
[1:37:39.640 --> 1:37:43.720]  plan and execute it's not going to get better it's going to get worse and we
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:47.960]  have to be ready for it well Bob we know the globalists are masters at
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:51.360]  engineering crises and using the crisis they create to get the next stage of
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:55.680]  power and for decades you've written and explained how when they finally imploded
[1:37:55.680 --> 1:37:58.880]  things by design they would announce a new bank of the world a new global
[1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:03.120]  carbon tax that this new private group would regulate and control the planet
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:07.360]  for everyone's ease and to stop the financial crises same thing they did
[1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:11.400]  in 1913 after staging crises that they later bragged about they said oh we'll
[1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:15.400]  fix all the future crises just give us power just like naftan gap we're going
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:19.440]  to save our economy and then it makes it worse and they say oh more open borders
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:23.240]  and more false free trade is the answer and then it makes it worse and the
[1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:26.320]  answer is more more more it's kind of like you know if you punch somebody in
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:29.200]  the face five times and knock their teeth out you say here this will make it
[1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:32.960]  better and start punching them in the face ten more times or here let me take
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:35.960]  a you know tire iron your head here that'll fix it oh your head's hurting
[1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:40.520]  here I'll kill you that'll get rid of the pain I mean this is very very serious
[1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:45.880]  and then all over the nation I become conditioned Bob I become acclimated and
[1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:49.640]  I've got to consciously realize this is happening and discipline myself against
[1:38:49.640 --> 1:38:56.840]  it Bob every day and I know every day you see these as well every day I get
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:38:59.240]  emails like the one I'm about to read this is a mainstream news story but I
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:02.840]  will send an email with this story it's the police department put out a
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:06.160]  press release so did the u.s. Air Force this is from the u.s. Air Force
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:11.560]  security force squadron unit public affairs captain Tamron of Fisher Carter
[1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:18.480]  but every day sometimes three four times a day Texas Michigan Washington State
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:23.720]  Virginia West Virginia just everywhere same thing in Canada same thing in
[1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:28.000]  England same thing in Australia same thing in Germany same thing in news it's
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:32.240]  everywhere it's the same thing but I get it just in the u.s. every day without
[1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:36.240]  looking for it without even being able to read all the email it's all there's a
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:40.000]  local regular army affairs is now going to have two officers in our small
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:43.360]  department of 15 officers or it's a bigger department others gonna be 20
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:47.160]  guys from the army here some an intelligence some in special ops and
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:50.360]  then they admit in the articles they're gonna be out watching the local
[1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:55.560]  citizens just to help the police and oh in San Antonio for fiesta this happened
[1:39:55.560 --> 1:40:02.800]  before 9-11 oh the Air Force MPs are out helping run checkpoints and oh the
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:05.560]  Marines and Army you're gonna help at car wrecks you're not against helping at
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:09.000]  car wrecks are you and oh they're gonna be out at DWI checkpoints with guns
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:15.120]  searching people and North comms announced the armies announced because
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:17.680]  they got announced their own people in the Army times hey we're gonna be on the
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:21.240]  streets of America and other announcing we're gonna have checkpoints we're gonna
[1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:25.400]  have body scanners on the streets and subways and and and bus terminals it's
[1:40:25.400 --> 1:40:32.320]  all being announced federal security forces aligning everybody up backed up
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:38.160]  by squads of paramilitary police the bills introduced to the to openly make
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:42.000]  law which already set up with FEMA camps for emergency medical centers and
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:46.040]  people want to go to the camps as the economy implodes exactly as we predicted
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:49.800]  as we've seen this see them do this in other countries now they admit it plus
[1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:52.520]  we could reverse engineer what they were setting up before but now it's
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:57.200]  confirmed here it is local military civilian police training builds this is
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:03.920]  the one today Patterson Air Force Base Colorado security forces airmen kicking
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:08.280]  indoors I'm reading the article this is from the Air Force security force airmen
[1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:12.440]  kicking indoors were only part of the action during a joint training exercise
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:16.280]  were the 21st security forces squadron airmen teamed up with members of the
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:20.640]  Colorado Springs Police Department El Paso County Sheriff's Department and the
[1:41:20.640 --> 1:41:24.440]  federal Bureau of Investigation among other agencies Colorado Springs looks
[1:41:24.440 --> 1:41:29.640]  like the real government there in the mountain the training was meant to
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:35.880]  bolster skills and tactics as well as improve interagency communication vital
[1:41:35.880 --> 1:41:41.160]  at times of crisis according to Major General Dumont 21 SFS individual
[1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:45.080]  mobilization augmentee both military and civilian organizations practice
[1:41:45.080 --> 1:41:49.360]  responding to a variety of situations where they routinely face a real-world
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:52.240]  situation this is the first time all types of law enforcement came together
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:57.880]  for such training said Paul Macahow civilian law enforcement member it
[1:41:57.880 --> 1:42:02.560]  helps improve the working relationships we have and builds valuable skills for
[1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:05.920]  us all the training combined classroom instruction with field training
[1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:09.520]  guaranteeing they're talking about veterans and owners at this exercises
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:13.280]  were agencies participated various special weapons and tactics techniques
[1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:16.400]  explosives entry techniques and tactical movement explosives were
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:20.360]  incorporated to add the realistic nature of the scenarios and then they always
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:23.320]  blow stuff up in the town for a day or two say terrorists really hit to create
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:26.680]  the psychological fear to make the whole town a giant reeducation camp then
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:29.960]  later they announced it's drill the training familiarizes us with each
[1:42:29.960 --> 1:42:33.600]  other's agencies and we can offer a particular situation said Major Dumont
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:38.480]  overall the training was a major success in team building and technique so
[1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:43.280]  everywhere and I have the videos of the training to take on the local citizens
[1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:50.280]  and to do all of this they you know they planned on imploding things Bob but
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:54.320]  what are the cops gonna do when their families are are losing everything I
[1:42:54.320 --> 1:42:58.760]  guess maybe serve the system even more because they're scared I mean is there
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:06.680]  nothing they won't do Bob Chapman well I think like any organization especially
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:11.600]  in law enforcement because of the culture it's always been them against us
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:20.840]  and it was always seen by them as being a special group of people who were
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:25.400]  generally disliked by the public even though they were taking criminals off
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:30.840]  the streets so to speak but now we have this federalization thing and I think
[1:43:30.840 --> 1:43:33.760]  most of them just want to keep their jobs and they'll do as they're told just
[1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:37.640]  to get the paycheck and we have lots of people in lots of fields to do that
[1:43:37.640 --> 1:43:42.560]  doctors are up against the same thing our attorneys are and if they speak out
[1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:47.600]  in court they held in contempt and so there's all these barriers that have
[1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:52.160]  been set up in and the next barrier among law enforcement is going to be
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:57.480]  federalization and police policing organizations are gonna have to decide
[1:43:57.480 --> 1:44:01.400]  whether they're gonna go along with the federal government and lose their lives
[1:44:01.400 --> 1:44:05.680]  and lose their families and I remind them again and again and again there's
[1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:10.520]  450 million weapons in the country there's 80 million people who have been
[1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:16.280]  trained to do combat there's 40 million people who have done combat do they
[1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:22.960]  really want to changle with them well if the globalists aren't giving us a
[1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:28.600]  choice and I could see the multi-level chess game here it's like five or six
[1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:35.080]  chessboard stacked on top of each other going on it at one time or a giant
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:40.400]  chessboard with you know 30 times the pieces and it's again it's not two
[1:44:40.400 --> 1:44:44.400]  dimensional it's three-dimensional but it's clear when they've done this in
[1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:48.480]  other nations and I've read a lot of white papers on it they plan to chew up
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:53.320]  the military and the police in a war against the American people and then
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:44:57.360]  bring in I4 after when everybody's just begging for the power to be on and I
[1:44:57.360 --> 1:45:00.080]  know a lot of people can't believe this is coming and gonna happen they are
[1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:03.080]  intending to do this and most of the police listing right now you're gonna
[1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:07.760]  be wounded or killed and I'm sorry the globalists did this and just they're
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:10.800]  not gonna let you take everybody's kids to the FEMA camps everybody's not gonna
[1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:15.920]  turn their guns into you if 1% of 150 million gun owners fights you that's a
[1:45:15.920 --> 1:45:20.080]  million people and I just but I understand you're on a power trip and
[1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:24.160]  you're gonna have to see before you learn but at least halfway into this
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:29.480]  carnage maybe then they'll start waking up Bob well this week I had two
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:34.280]  stories of them shooting little tiny dogs and I just couldn't believe it I
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:39.040]  haven't both in tomorrow's issue of the international forecaster via link but
[1:45:39.040 --> 1:45:43.560]  it just you know the dogs grow out at them and so they shot them I mean I
[1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:47.600]  can understand that the dog jumps on you and starts to bite you that you have to
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:52.400]  shoot them but these are little dogs and I don't know what goes through their
[1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:57.760]  minds you know I you know maybe they just want to try their weapons out for
[1:45:57.760 --> 1:46:01.200]  the day well Bob I was about to say we should dig out the old tapes of the
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:04.200]  shows aren't the personnel to even do that they're so busy on the limited
[1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:07.880]  things we're doing but hopefully this money bomb that'll change I did a bunch
[1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:12.440]  of local access TV reports 10 12 years ago where they would go to the house for
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:18.040]  marijuana the cops freaked out shot a lab that was chained up in the house in
[1:46:18.040 --> 1:46:26.480]  a cage as it was barking shot a poodle small poodle and also shot bullets into
[1:46:26.480 --> 1:46:31.160]  baby's cribs and then through fits and beat up the family so and then you know
[1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:34.520]  there were a bunch of cases but no they're taught that everything is about by
[1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:39.120]  the book they're God anything that gets in their way is dead and God forbid your
[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:43.080]  dog bark it's going to die so there's thousands of cases Bob all over the
[1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:47.640]  country where they kill toy Chihuahuas they kill two pound dogs and they open
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:50.560]  fire and they obliterate them and they sometimes shoot the people inside the
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:54.160]  house and it's an old part of mental illness and I don't care what excuses
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:57.120]  the cops make for this you didn't act like this before we're the most
[1:46:57.120 --> 1:47:01.600]  incarcerated country in the world we're a joke and your bosses ship the stink and
[1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:08.800]  drugs end up again with your fools go ahead Bob well that's all true and I
[1:47:08.800 --> 1:47:15.720]  just it just happened to hit me that these two incidents happened while we
[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:19.880]  are looking at all these other things going on the federalization of police
[1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:30.840]  and the escalation of stupid acts the escalation of the the buttoning down of
[1:47:30.840 --> 1:47:36.120]  the American people the next thing that they're going to do I believe is try to
[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:41.040]  seal the borders now that's that's really unusual because they've had them
[1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:45.880]  virtually wide open for so long and the reason they're going to do that is I
[1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:51.120]  think they're going to down the line here when things get real nasty I think
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:55.160]  they're going to put on currency controls I think there's a good chance of
[1:47:55.160 --> 1:47:59.560]  that and I've lived in currency control countries and it's like being in a
[1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:04.680]  financial prison because if you wanted to take money out you couldn't and they
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:10.400]  want to control everybody's money because they think they believe that it
[1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:15.000]  all belongs to them well let me expand on that it is their fiat false money we
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:20.200]  are the idiots that got conned by him so in a sick way it's true but you know
[1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:22.800]  kind of like when a killer has a woman strapped down he's about to rape and
[1:48:22.800 --> 1:48:26.680]  kill you know it's his ballgame so in a way it's it she does belong to him
[1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:29.920]  because she got in the car with him or got kidnapped it's very sick but it
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:33.320]  possessions nine-tenths of the law we are their slaves until we stand up on our
[1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:38.080]  hind legs and say no but you know you're bringing up what you just said is in a
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:41.960]  lot of their own documents and statements about what they're planning
[1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:45.280]  that what they're gonna do is lock the borders down with this new hemispheric
[1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:48.520]  travel card and then they've already said they're just gonna give all the
[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:52.680]  illegal aliens in Mexico the new North American Union ID card that American
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:56.240]  hemispheric card everybody here's on the news and everybody's getting that's in
[1:48:56.240 --> 1:48:59.440]  Canada and Mexico to their government's just the issue on it's going to be
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:03.680]  accepted by our government and so the illegals are going to be allowed to go
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:09.280]  in and out it's gonna be slave Americans who aren't they're gonna keep the
[1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:12.920]  illegals off the no-fly list in the no-border list I mean this is all such
[1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:19.000]  so selectively done Bob yeah and they want that you know essentially slave
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:23.840]  labor which so important for them to make the profits that continue to allow
[1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:28.600]  them to suppress the people not just profits though as you know undermining
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:33.200]  real middle-class wages that allow you to provide for your family well they
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:37.680]  suck it down from the bottom in this case and they pull wages down at the
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:41.560]  lower end of the scale that's why these people who are making automobiles and
[1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:49.240]  and and and support industries in that area went from $30 down to 10 to $15
[1:49:49.240 --> 1:49:54.400]  if they lucky per hour if they lucky if they can get a job and the same thing
[1:49:54.400 --> 1:50:00.920]  incidentally it's happened in Mexico the the labor unions there have been
[1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:07.880]  forced to drop Mexican wages to the level in many instances of Chinese wages in
[1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:12.120]  order to keep the business so that they can keep people working the race to the
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:16.800]  bottom the sucking sound that's right and you know we were talking about a
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:23.600]  Merkel mercantilization and we tried it in 1790 to 1800 it was a disaster and
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:28.920]  that's why we put tariffs in and that's why we became such a successful nation
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:34.200]  or at least in part that's part of the reason we realized that we couldn't
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:37.560]  compete with slave labor and we've got to do that again and we need that
[1:50:37.560 --> 1:50:42.880]  legislation as soon as we get rid of the fit Bob Chapman's our guest two more

[1:56:11.640 --> 1:56:17.280]  go to some phone calls here for Bob Chapman let's talk to DeWayne and
[1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:22.120]  Pennsylvania you're on the air with Bob Chapman I have a question for something
[1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:26.920]  that Bob mentioned a few months back that is the percentage of goods that
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:29.560]  Americans produce for their own consumption I think you mentioned it was
[1:56:29.560 --> 1:56:33.400]  around 12% do you think it's the figures below that now with all the auto
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:41.240]  factory shutting down and those figures vary from different sources some of
[1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:47.680]  them have it at 9% 9.5% and some of them have it at 10% so we'll say it's
[1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:53.040]  somewhere between 9 and 12% it's unbelievable it's what's going to
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:56.680]  happen when we lose our machine tool industry well I think we're on the
[1:56:56.680 --> 1:57:02.080]  verge of doing that now and once we lose the machine tool industry we know we
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:07.280]  can no longer manufacture in the future if we want to without bringing machine
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:14.360]  tool experts in from other countries to reteach to teach new people to operate
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:18.680]  those kind of machines but we're in the post-industrial eugenics world so under
[1:57:18.680 --> 1:57:21.880]  the carbon footprint we won't be having those to make sure we go bankrupt
[1:57:21.880 --> 1:57:24.960]  they're bringing that in now while other countries don't have to oh how
[1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:28.760]  friendly thank you Dwayne Mike and Nevada you're on the air with Bob Chapman go
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:35.680]  ahead yes sir I have three quick questions they're kind of a little bit
[1:57:35.680 --> 1:57:39.080]  off-topic of you're on a really bad speakerphone so go ahead and ask them
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:44.520]  okay all right three quick questions is Microsoft part of the new world order
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:52.080]  yes and yes okay so it's supporting open source like Linux BSD is that a small
[1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:57.600]  way of fighting the new yes yes yes yes okay definitely all right now is it
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:58:01.880]  better it certainly is better for us to focus on both but is it better to take
[1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:06.640]  back the federal government or focus on taking our state government back both
[1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:10.440]  but you might but you get more results locally that's the real gap the enemy
[1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:15.560]  hasn't gotten yet Bob Chapman I agree and this sovereign movement especially and
[1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:22.000]  so the the the the area that you can work with the most easily is the
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:28.960]  local level the state level absolutely sir God bless you Mike law I think I know
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:32.720]  law that's a big huge 9-11 truth or maybe somebody else named law is calling

[2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:35.520]  have any questions I just was wanting to tell you about I'm not sure if you're
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:41.280]  aware but for the first time in the US history here a KBDI channel 12 actually
[2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:47.240]  got pressed for truth on the PBS station here in Denver oh yeah we actually we
[2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:51.040]  actually put links to that up in there in their fundraising drive yeah that's
[2:01:51.040 --> 2:01:54.960]  PBS that isn't under Rockefeller's control and I believe they're the same
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:58.720]  ones that showed America freedom to fascism and French he was also on their
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:04.360]  pitching in game so I did they air in game or did they just give it away for
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:08.960]  donations now they were actually given away at a certain level of donation but
[2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:13.120]  we were all pretty amazed about that for sure but so that was really
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:15.960]  tremendous you know I really wanted to relate to what you guys were talking
[2:02:15.960 --> 2:02:21.120]  about before about how the change is becoming palpable it's but you can sense
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:26.640]  it now we have just a big week started out with the KBDI it was really 911
[2:02:26.640 --> 2:02:30.800]  visibility friend sure and the people over there that made that happen it took
[2:02:30.800 --> 2:02:34.080]  about a year and a half to really get the thing rolling and they had a
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:38.200]  tremendous response I mean they were breaking records in just their first
[2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:43.440]  commercial pledge break so that was really really telling I'm absolutely is
[2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:46.920]  telling and the enemy knows where the majority but they know that most people
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:51.000]  don't know that's they're desperately trying to make us all look fringe but in
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:54.760]  the beginning a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared but in time when his
[2:02:54.760 --> 2:02:57.840]  cause succeeds that him and join him because then it costs nothing to be a
[2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:01.920]  patriot we use either still a great cost but it's getting easier and easier and
[2:03:01.920 --> 2:03:05.920]  as more of a stand up there are less and less targets that the new order can
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:08.800]  single out because there's too many of us because there's too many targets they
[2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:18.320]  can't shut us down so power and numbers Bob Chapman I agree completely well law
[2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:22.360]  I got to get Colorado change on in their future we got I mean just all of you guys
[2:03:22.360 --> 2:03:27.280]  are just doing such an amazing job fire out the website oh heck yeah it'd be we
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:31.560]  are change Colorado org actually that's where you can check us out and get in
[2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:35.320]  touch and another point I wanted to make was we did the people's fair again this

[2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:45.920]  really an honor to be on the Obama deception DVD it's really fantastic the
[2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:50.560]  MSNBC event there is gonna go down in my own personal history is one of the
[2:03:50.560 --> 2:03:54.240]  greatest times I've had well you know they were laughing when they were
[2:03:54.240 --> 2:03:58.680]  punching and hitting me and cut the mic the microphone cord on the bullhorn and
[2:03:58.680 --> 2:04:02.840]  attack me and then attacked our camera guy viciously but I just sat there and
[2:04:02.840 --> 2:04:06.720]  let him laugh at me and you guys got there in 15 minutes with more bullhorns
[2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:10.640]  and we said okay attack us and shut us down we'll come back with four bullhorns
[2:04:10.640 --> 2:04:14.760]  and shut those down we'll come back with eight bullhorns and I mean it was so
[2:04:14.760 --> 2:04:19.160]  archetypal to have them attack me viciously and then you show up huge you
[2:04:19.160 --> 2:04:27.280]  know like a NFL center but without the big belly and to sit there with Luke on
[2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:31.520]  the shoulders it was just so archetypal how they crushed me and then even bigger
[2:04:31.520 --> 2:04:35.920]  Phoenix rose right out of the ground it was it was really spiritual so that's

[2:06:04.680 --> 2:06:08.560]  generator this summer number one new climate legislation could easily double
[2:06:08.560 --> 2:06:12.840]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[2:06:12.840 --> 2:06:17.040]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[2:06:17.040 --> 2:06:21.000]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:24.920]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:06:24.920 --> 2:06:28.560]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[2:06:28.560 --> 2:06:31.920]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:36.120]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar power

[2:08:09.280 --> 2:08:12.280]  you
[2:08:27.560 --> 2:08:32.560]  ladies and gentlemen until about 45 after so we have dr. Paul Craig Roberts on
[2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:41.320]  the line with us today and dr. Roberts of course was the former editor of the
[2:08:41.320 --> 2:08:44.000]  Wall Street Journal former head of policy department of treasury number two
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:48.240]  there the father of Reaganomics has been listed by many publications as one of
[2:08:48.240 --> 2:08:52.800]  the top ten or top 50 economists out there and you have all these fake neocons
[2:08:52.800 --> 2:08:56.320]  that he was a big critic of he hoped Obama was gonna do what he said he did and
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:08:58.920]  I know lately he's been saying my gosh it looks like he could actually be worse
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:02.680]  if that was possible Bush only tripled government Obama's doubled it in one
[2:09:02.680 --> 2:09:09.240]  year so that'd be be a tenfold increase instead of a tripling in four years to
[2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:12.440]  eight years depending on how you cut it or slice it so he's whether to talk
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:18.520]  about that some of his columns that are syndicated why the why the Chinese
[2:09:18.520 --> 2:09:22.560]  laughed at us and where all this is going Dr. Paul Craig Roberts good to
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:28.480]  have you here my friend you bet break it down I mean there's a lot going on but
[2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:32.400]  what state are we in right now with the White House grabbing industries telling
[2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:37.640]  banks what to do saying nobody can audit them they're above the law
[2:09:37.640 --> 2:09:41.120]  Obama going back on everything he said I mean this is getting crazy
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:49.480]  I do yes looks like pursuit of power is going to the heads I certainly agree it
[2:09:49.480 --> 2:09:57.040]  and I think it's hurting Obama a lot of his fans are disturbed about him and
[2:09:57.040 --> 2:10:03.120]  and of course the Republicans will turn that to their advantage sooner or
[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:10.560]  later and then so we'll be thrown out of the fire back into the frying pan and
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:14.020]  back and forth how does this end when both parties are owned by the same
[2:10:14.020 --> 2:10:18.000]  corrupt interest and that whorehouse called Washington just each drinks and
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:22.280]  Mary not even carrying of the country collapses they'll just move to Switzerland
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:26.840]  yeah it's really kind of like the French government in it before the French
[2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:37.440]  Revolution I mean that's how how to touch both parties are I think what may
[2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:42.560]  happen Alex of course I don't know nobody can know I think what may happen is
[2:10:42.560 --> 2:10:47.720]  that the just the general overreach of the United States government the
[2:10:47.720 --> 2:10:55.040]  economic overreach you know the foreign policy the military they just overreach
[2:10:55.040 --> 2:11:03.640]  in so many places that they get so many problems that they suffer a huge defeat I
[2:11:03.640 --> 2:11:10.880]  think defeat is what they're headed for if we think about the Iraq war and all
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:17.320]  the trouble the long drawn-out process until we finally caught on and start
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:23.760]  paying off the insurgents with money if you think about all that trouble why
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:30.040]  do they want to get in 10 times as much trouble in Pakistan and Afghanistan much
[2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:38.040]  larger more rugged countries meaner people it it doesn't make a great deal
[2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:44.520]  of sense you would think they would have learned good gosh we came close to getting
[2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:50.400]  our butts kicked in Iraq what do we want to take even worse risk and then if you
[2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:58.680]  look at the financial policy and you say well look we we we let the financial
[2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:02.560]  gangsters make fools of us and deregulate them and turn them loose they
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:11.560]  wiped out half of the savings of the American people people who denied
[2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:15.920]  themselves the consumption and put away money for their old age and now the
[2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:22.160]  banksters have destroyed half of it we let them con us into deregulating them
[2:12:22.160 --> 2:12:29.000]  and giving them a free hand to rip people off and and now how do we respond
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:34.840]  to that we give them trillions of dollars but we won't do anything for the
[2:12:34.840 --> 2:12:39.920]  homeowners and we'll let the car companies go bankrupt because we want to
[2:12:39.920 --> 2:12:47.280]  bust the unions but we won't let a bank go bankrupt and how do they think that
[2:12:47.280 --> 2:12:52.720]  plays with people I mean even the brainwashed American public sees through
[2:12:52.720 --> 2:12:59.240]  all that and then the question is these deficits you know like this year the
[2:12:59.240 --> 2:13:08.200]  deficit is four or five times bigger than last year it just cannot be financed so
[2:13:08.200 --> 2:13:17.320]  and next year the same thing again it'll be another two trillion and ready when
[2:13:17.320 --> 2:13:25.920]  you have half of your budget in red ink that's like when you're in a major war
[2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:31.600]  like World War two or something and you and you you're in that situation how do
[2:13:31.600 --> 2:13:36.800]  you finance it the world hadn't got that money to finance it and so that
[2:13:36.800 --> 2:13:45.680]  financing problem I think is going to threaten the dollar's role as a reserve
[2:13:45.680 --> 2:13:54.280]  currency and of course that weakens the power of the United States because the
[2:13:54.280 --> 2:13:59.240]  the real power of the country is not based on some kind of inherent right
[2:13:59.240 --> 2:14:02.840]  that we have it's based on the fact that we have the reserve currency and can pay
[2:14:02.840 --> 2:14:08.320]  our bills now in currency so if we lose that we've lost the bulk of our power
[2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:16.680]  and yet they're taking great risk with that important power by adding you know
[2:14:16.680 --> 2:14:23.440]  four trillion dollars in two years and it's not just what they're adding to the
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:29.160]  accumulated federal debt which is large it's the fact that they got to come up
[2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:32.840]  with two trillion dollars in barred money this year another two trillion in
[2:14:32.840 --> 2:14:36.480]  barred money next year and there's not two trillion dollars anywhere in the
[2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:43.480]  world to lend us and so there's only two places that money can come from one is
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:51.240]  another sharp decline in the stock market at which equity holders flee from
[2:14:51.240 --> 2:14:57.360]  stocks for the safety of government bonds that's one way they can finance the
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:04.440]  deficit the only other way is to print the money and if they print the money
[2:15:04.440 --> 2:15:10.560]  and the world will notice it in fact the Chinese are have been complaining for
[2:15:10.560 --> 2:15:16.960]  six months or more about the possibility we're going to print the money to
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:21.720]  finance and and they keep complaining and louder and louder voices and
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:30.200]  recently and Beijing the audience that the Treasury Secretary guys there had
[2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:39.840]  laughed at him because he was so stupid he didn't even understand that he cannot
[2:15:39.840 --> 2:15:46.320]  simultaneously tell the Chinese that he wants a strong dollar but he wants the
[2:15:46.320 --> 2:15:52.800]  Chinese currency to rise and that their investments are safe their dollar
[2:15:52.800 --> 2:15:57.560]  investments are safe well obviously if the Chinese that their currency rise
[2:15:57.560 --> 2:16:03.720]  relative to the dollar that dollar holdings are worth less and they're
[2:16:03.720 --> 2:16:10.480]  not safe they're getting less dollars but Dr. Robert Summinge Geithner that
[2:16:10.480 --> 2:16:16.480]  little pinhead I mean he's not stupid he knows that was pure bull I guess he
[2:16:16.480 --> 2:16:20.960]  just thought he was talking to an uneducated American audience on economics
[2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:24.680]  instead of a Chinese you know group of college students who were mainly
[2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:33.160]  economics students know Alex maybe but it's a terrific risk to take you know
[2:16:33.160 --> 2:16:38.280]  to have it we're the superpower we're the financial superpower rule the world
[2:16:38.280 --> 2:16:44.960]  and the university law the audience laughs down the secretary no I agree but
[2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:47.840]  I think he's so arrogant I mean I think he's so arrogant he thought I get away
[2:16:47.840 --> 2:16:52.320]  with it I agree with you that's a big risk and and and that the luster the aura
[2:16:52.320 --> 2:16:55.400]  the cloak of infallibility of the private fellow reserve and these bankers
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:16:59.400]  and these corporate crooks is starting to fade and you're right that's that's a
[2:16:59.400 --> 2:17:02.560]  danger you know I mean it's good to have their power fade but it's also in a way
[2:17:02.560 --> 2:17:06.960]  bad because when they fall over like a giant oak tree on us it could crush us
[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:10.320]  but I guess it's better than being their slaves but the question I've got for you
[2:17:10.320 --> 2:17:16.160]  then on this issue is where does it go because in layman's terms they're
[2:17:16.160 --> 2:17:19.200]  already monetizing debt isn't the Federal Reserve the Treasury already
[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:23.960]  engaged in chicanery with each other when people don't buy all the bonds they
[2:17:23.960 --> 2:17:28.040]  put out on the market or how do you see this unfolding is there any way out of
[2:17:28.040 --> 2:17:35.160]  this and then be isn't this like a Mexican standoff it's kind of crazy like a
[2:17:35.160 --> 2:17:40.760]  fox or a method of the madness you know Bernanke and them know that China has
[2:17:40.760 --> 2:17:43.680]  its main investments with us so they start dumping the dollar they're going
[2:17:43.680 --> 2:17:47.320]  to destroy their own market but at a point it won't matter because it'll start
[2:17:47.320 --> 2:17:50.760]  in fighting currencies and then I mean well you're the economist explain it to
[2:17:50.760 --> 2:17:57.600]  me well so far I like this going I just as I predicted I said that when they
[2:17:57.600 --> 2:18:01.240]  announced that we're going by a trillion dollars of debt 300 billion in
[2:18:01.240 --> 2:18:07.360]  Treasury bonds 700 billion in mortgage bonds I said well that's
[2:18:07.360 --> 2:18:11.720]  monetization and that's going to drive up the interest rates drive down the bond
[2:18:11.720 --> 2:18:16.600]  prices and low and behold exactly what happened interest rates have risen on
[2:18:16.600 --> 2:18:22.120]  the Treasury and the prices which you know is the reverse of that going down
[2:18:22.120 --> 2:18:28.960]  and it's harder to get a home and and so and so what Geithner thought or
[2:18:28.960 --> 2:18:39.040]  Bernanke of all of them thought was that hey we can drive down interest rates by
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:48.480]  buying bonds but instead they've gone up and so I would imagine as the Fed buys
[2:18:48.480 --> 2:18:54.040]  up more of the bonds they're issuing to finance this year's budget deficit
[2:18:54.040 --> 2:19:01.000]  interest rates are gonna go rise higher and so then they're faced with what do
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:07.680]  we do about the real estate crisis that rates are rising how exactly help it
[2:19:07.680 --> 2:19:14.640]  doesn't help see what I'm saying yes and so I think they've that's what I say
[2:19:14.640 --> 2:19:22.760]  that they're creating more problems than they can manage and they will be
[2:19:22.760 --> 2:19:29.040]  devoured by the problems that power will be devoured and of course Americans
[2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:36.080]  will suffer due to the rising inflation and interest rates which will be
[2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:40.680]  together with unemployment dr. Paul Craig Roberts got a break again come back
[2:19:40.680 --> 2:19:43.880]  and continue explaining that to people yeah I mean they supposedly all these
[2:19:43.880 --> 2:19:47.840]  trillions in tarp money but now it's harder to get a mortgage they're using
[2:19:47.840 --> 2:19:50.240]  the money to buy up other banks and insurance companies and having the

[2:24:21.120 --> 2:24:27.160]  Rick Roberts but right now when a shift gears and one of the other big subjects
[2:24:27.160 --> 2:24:33.000]  he talks about the police state and again he's a real conservative father of
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:37.120]  economics but we've had police shooting people in handcuffs in the back and then
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:40.200]  trying to claim they attacked them and then hidden camera stuff gets released
[2:24:40.200 --> 2:24:43.880]  and they just shoot the guy for no reason we have police shooting people's
[2:24:43.880 --> 2:24:47.280]  little dogs all over the news when they come to your house down the Chihuahua
[2:24:47.280 --> 2:24:52.240]  barks they kill it saying it was a threat to the officers literally and we've
[2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:56.000]  got the military and the police training everywhere the TSA announced in the
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  Associated Press yesterday that in Boston in New York everyone will be
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:04.240]  searched and everyone I don't know how they're gonna do this but it says
[2:25:04.240 --> 2:25:07.480]  everyone will be put through those body scanners you know that are called you
[2:25:07.480 --> 2:25:11.960]  know the naked scanners in the news that show your body and that the FBI wants
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:19.440]  them to set up TSA style security at America's biggest malls and your book
[2:25:19.440 --> 2:25:22.520]  the tyranny of good intentions I don't think it really is even good intentions
[2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:25.400]  but it tells all these amazing stories and how the Bill of Rights is being
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:29.320]  abolished the second edition's out right now brand new we got it up on screen for
[2:25:29.320 --> 2:25:33.680]  folks and the few minutes we got left in this little short segment I mean they
[2:25:33.680 --> 2:25:37.480]  it looks like it's premeditated here as they implode the economy and they've
[2:25:37.480 --> 2:25:41.400]  set up Northcom now and they say they're gonna use army troops on us but I don't
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:48.160]  see that working as society continues to implode can you speak to that well yeah
[2:25:48.160 --> 2:25:53.720]  I mean first of all this couldn't possibly do terrorists because they
[2:25:53.720 --> 2:25:59.160]  haven't bombed any subways or any shopping centers and as far as we can
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:07.120]  tell the only terrorists that have been uncovered in the United States or people
[2:26:07.120 --> 2:26:15.240]  that the FBI stirred up and led and talked into doing things with promises of
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:22.800]  large sums of money so since there aren't any terrorists and and the FBI has
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:31.680]  to go out and find really incompetent and somewhat unintelligent people to
[2:26:31.680 --> 2:26:39.000]  bribe with money to say that they want to go be a terrorist then we're not under
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:46.320]  any attack so there's no reason for any of this body scanning other than to
[2:26:46.320 --> 2:26:54.480]  further make the American people accept searches without warrants because that's
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:58.400]  basically what they're doing to you they're searching you without a warrant
[2:26:58.400 --> 2:27:10.280]  now they the claim on the air yes sir travel is that oh but you see if you
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:16.040]  don't want to be searched you don't have to fly and if since flying is so
[2:27:16.040 --> 2:27:20.680]  vulnerable you're up in the air and we can't have anybody a danger to the other
[2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:27.480]  passengers well of course going to malls is not that kind of argument all there's
[2:27:27.480 --> 2:27:34.240]  nobody up in the air there's no vulnerabilities other than what you would
[2:27:34.240 --> 2:27:41.800]  find from being mugged or hit by a car or anything else when you go out and so
[2:27:41.800 --> 2:27:47.560]  there's no special vulnerabilities and so it has nothing to do with anything
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:56.400]  except training us to be good little citizens of a police state oh yes the
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:28:00.600]  the next thing they will do then is say we have to have implants so they'll know
[2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:04.760]  where we are at all times they're already proposing that the Mexican Attorney
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:13.880]  General made his employees take them three years ago well I don't know what's
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:20.600]  behind all this other than just bureaucracy running amok we can look for
[2:28:20.600 --> 2:28:26.280]  conspiracies but the trouble I always have with all these conspiracies is that
[2:28:26.280 --> 2:28:30.320]  it seems that they're so much smarter than they ever show any signs of being
[2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:34.720]  I don't think they're even that smart they have the instinct of control freaks
[2:28:34.720 --> 2:28:41.000]  okay that's they just it's a bureaucracy that always wants more power well of
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:49.080]  course so if technology presents new opportunities then they sees it and they
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:55.600]  use it but I suppose people if the American people will clue that which
[2:28:55.600 --> 2:29:00.520]  unfortunately not very many of them are they all need to listen to your show but
[2:29:00.520 --> 2:29:09.040]  if they were clued in then they could just boycott the malls and then the
[2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:13.680]  mall and the subways and the rest of ways you don't have to use some ways is
[2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:17.360]  kind of harder I guess for New Yorkers because they gotta be able to get around
[2:29:17.360 --> 2:29:25.120]  a city that that's but you could certainly boycott the malls and then that
[2:29:25.120 --> 2:29:29.040]  would contribute to the commercial real estate collapse and people would
[2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:32.560]  probably make the government back off well as you know sir they've done
[2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:35.680]  studies a lot of people don't fly now because they don't like having the
[2:29:35.680 --> 2:29:38.960]  illegal aliens that run security jab them and scream at them I want to ask you
[2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:42.960]  about the Mayak and DHS reports we broke a few months ago listing
[2:29:42.960 --> 2:29:46.960]  conservatives and people as terrorists and the whole in the Fed movement where
[2:29:46.960 --> 2:29:50.240]  you see that going with auditing the Fed stay with us sir

[2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:38.400]  broke previous reports but out of the feds people wouldn't believe us
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:42.400]  we broke that uh they had infregard here before it was in the mainstream news
[2:33:42.400 --> 2:33:46.880]  getting 56 000 executives would shoot to kill orders during martial law ready to
[2:33:46.880 --> 2:33:51.920]  watch their employees now it's public uh the clergy response teams
[2:33:51.920 --> 2:33:58.000]  uh now uh over 40 000 of those we know of then it came on the news years
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:01.440]  after we had the secret documents uh saying oh yes the clergy's
[2:34:01.440 --> 2:34:04.560]  preparing their flocks to hand in their guns go to fema camps
[2:34:04.560 --> 2:34:08.720]  that's mainstream news you can't make this up i can't believe it myself
[2:34:08.720 --> 2:34:12.880]  it's so crazy and then now the dhs report comes out and says ron paul
[2:34:12.880 --> 2:34:17.840]  supporters people that want to audit the fed uh we got the documents from the
[2:34:17.840 --> 2:34:20.800]  army leaked to us the army admitted to the news
[2:34:20.800 --> 2:34:24.640]  that they were spying on ron paul and houston and me and dalis protesting the
[2:34:24.640 --> 2:34:28.400]  fed last year and listed us as potential terrorists and told the
[2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:31.600]  military in plain clothes army intelligence don't let them know your
[2:34:31.600 --> 2:34:35.680]  military they may kill you that's posted on info wars dot com
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:39.200]  i mean this this country's just got secret police all over it
[2:34:39.200 --> 2:34:42.000]  and now they want to have secret arrest they've said no more bill of rights
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:45.840]  basically no more fourth amendment warrantless wiretapping's a okay
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:48.960]  the courts have ruled the congress has passed the law
[2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:52.480]  and then dr roberts uh i mean you've been saying for years here on the air that
[2:34:52.480 --> 2:34:55.440]  they're gearing up to make the american people the enemy
[2:34:55.440 --> 2:35:00.640]  now they say on the dhs report the number one potential threat is veterans
[2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:05.040]  and gun owners and ron paul supporters giving your take
[2:35:05.040 --> 2:35:10.000]  yeah and bob bar support and bob bar i mean this is crazy your take on that
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:14.800]  well i think you know it shows uh the brown shirt mentality that i've been
[2:35:14.800 --> 2:35:19.120]  writing about several years it shows how they've taken
[2:35:19.120 --> 2:35:22.480]  uh patriotism of people who are not particularly bright
[2:35:22.480 --> 2:35:27.680]  and turned it into a brown shirt mentality where they're prepared now
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:32.320]  to turn on anyone who can be demonized and so
[2:35:32.320 --> 2:35:36.320]  the government is obviously going to demonize people who are
[2:35:36.320 --> 2:35:40.080]  associated with the defense of civil liberties
[2:35:40.080 --> 2:35:43.760]  and that's who's being demonized i mean now you have bob bar and
[2:35:43.760 --> 2:35:50.320]  and ron paul and so and it'll be the aclu and
[2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:55.920]  and uh it'll and it'll be libertarians in general and
[2:35:55.920 --> 2:35:59.840]  anybody who says hey look we have these rights
[2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:06.000]  and it's illegal under statutory law and also unconstitutional for you and
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:10.640]  the government to violate these rights so that is the enemy now
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:18.320]  so anyone who is opposed to unbridled state
[2:36:18.320 --> 2:36:24.320]  arbitrary power is an enemy of of america and they
[2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:31.840]  will soon be called terrorist or or uh insurgents or or something
[2:36:31.840 --> 2:36:35.920]  and so that's what's happening you you're right to call attention to it
[2:36:35.920 --> 2:36:40.560]  and that's exactly what's happened the founding fathers would all be arrested
[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:47.840]  as dangerous to state power so i think that's what we
[2:36:47.840 --> 2:36:54.720]  are faced with and the one check to it of course is an armed
[2:36:54.720 --> 2:36:58.400]  population if they're prepared to use the arms
[2:36:58.400 --> 2:37:02.160]  but of course the kind of guns we have are not very
[2:37:02.160 --> 2:37:09.520]  powerful compared to what the state can wield and the other check to
[2:37:09.520 --> 2:37:14.640]  this development we're discussing i call it the brown the brown shirt movement
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:19.200]  is that the government overreaches what we talked about earlier
[2:37:19.200 --> 2:37:23.360]  and finds its power shaken suffers some big defeats
[2:37:23.360 --> 2:37:28.720]  and humiliations and that this breaks the whole
[2:37:28.720 --> 2:37:34.880]  that it's acquiring over people's minds and and bodies so
[2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:39.040]  other than that i don't think there's going to be any kind of a political
[2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:44.480]  movement or reformers in washington that are going to be able to
[2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:49.360]  to roll this back the courts might slow them down
[2:37:49.360 --> 2:37:53.600]  there are still enough people in on the federal bench
[2:37:53.600 --> 2:37:57.440]  that weren't put there by the federalist society
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:38:04.960]  who who still believe in a balance of powers and civil liberties and they
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:08.880]  the courts may slow this process down and it's hope they do
[2:38:08.880 --> 2:38:13.120]  because the more it slows down the more likely
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:16.400]  the power of the federal government is going to crack from
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:20.400]  from its hubris and arrogance and over and overextension
[2:38:20.400 --> 2:38:24.480]  i don't think the entire world is prepared to put up
[2:38:24.480 --> 2:38:28.880]  with the united states they they put up with us for a long time because
[2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:33.760]  we were saving them from from the soviet union or so they thought and then
[2:38:33.760 --> 2:38:37.040]  because of the money we give them but if the money
[2:38:37.040 --> 2:38:42.240]  goes and loses its magic because it is inflated away
[2:38:42.240 --> 2:38:46.960]  and or the economy goes so much that there's no money to give anybody over
[2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:50.080]  there to control their governments and buy them
[2:38:50.080 --> 2:38:54.400]  then they just don't cooperate with us in the same ways and
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:38:58.480]  that would produce massive problems for the united states
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:03.200]  if if china and japan and russia or europe
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:06.960]  uh... or the shortage decided that
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:11.120]  cooperating with us was not any longer
[2:39:11.120 --> 2:39:14.880]  in their interest the way it had been the past or was less than their interest
[2:39:14.880 --> 2:39:18.480]  or that uh... less corporation was more their
[2:39:18.480 --> 2:39:21.840]  interest this would produce enormous problems for the
[2:39:21.840 --> 2:39:26.240]  united states and would undermine the ability
[2:39:26.240 --> 2:39:31.680]  to uh... imprison us all in some way or the other way so how long are they going
[2:39:31.680 --> 2:39:34.960]  to put up with it
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:39.120]  well and i mean here how long can the corruption just burgeon and spill out
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:42.560]  like a plague of locusts eating our flesh of the bone i mean
[2:39:42.560 --> 2:39:45.600]  how long can the arrogance and the hubris and the
[2:39:45.600 --> 2:39:50.720]  just open tyranny and open torture and open secret arrest and open wars and
[2:39:50.720 --> 2:39:55.840]  open lies i mean how long can evil be called good and good called evil
[2:39:55.840 --> 2:39:59.200]  how long will the world put up with this where do you see this developing into
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:03.360]  now well i think that if it's
[2:40:03.360 --> 2:40:08.080]  that that the american people are unlikely to call a halt to it
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:11.920]  uh... that if the if the halt is called it'll be
[2:40:11.920 --> 2:40:17.840]  from part of our our so-called nato puppet states will
[2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:22.240]  cease to be puppet states they won't won't be association
[2:40:22.240 --> 2:40:25.520]  uh... the russians and chinese are already
[2:40:25.520 --> 2:40:30.640]  you know digging in their heels uh... at some point
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:34.080]  the instability that we call calls in the middle east
[2:40:34.080 --> 2:40:41.520]  will threaten our puppets there and to save themselves they may simply
[2:40:41.520 --> 2:40:45.120]  switch over i don't think the united states
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:51.040]  has the power required for its aggressive program of
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:57.440]  hazy enemy at home and abroad uh... i don't i just don't think it
[2:40:57.440 --> 2:41:02.160]  it does but i do agree with you that that's their intention their intention
[2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:06.240]  is to terrorize us and the rest of the world
[2:41:06.240 --> 2:41:12.480]  uh... but i don't think and i course may be wrong
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:19.200]  that they have the financial and moral and leadership and military power to
[2:41:19.200 --> 2:41:23.200]  achieve that and when you think about them
[2:41:23.200 --> 2:41:28.400]  put you know occupy united states when they can occupy back that
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:31.520]  dr roberts you were in washington you were in the white house you were at the
[2:41:31.520 --> 2:41:36.000]  highest levels of government when i watch glenn beck posing as one of us
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:39.840]  but saying arrest ron paul supporters use the army on us
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:43.200]  that this horrible brooner guy or whatever his name is at the
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:49.840]  at the jewish center uh... that that that that he's a ron paul supporter and he has cia guys on
[2:41:49.840 --> 2:41:53.440]  saying that militia people work with al qaeda
[2:41:53.440 --> 2:41:56.080]  they know they know they're lying they know it's bull
[2:41:56.080 --> 2:42:00.000]  yeah and and you look in their eyes becks enjoying it the cia guy looked
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:02.880]  like he was losing his soul while he was doing it but
[2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:08.400]  i mean how do they get cia guys to really try to terrorize the us
[2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:10.880]  i guess they just work for offshore corporate interest and that's their job
[2:42:10.880 --> 2:42:14.640]  i want you to comment on that in in closing and then one other point
[2:42:14.640 --> 2:42:17.520]  uh... the audit the fed movement it's going to the floor
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:20.000]  they're trying to pull out every trick you know they've got
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:23.200]  saying society will collapse if we ought at the fed
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:26.960]  i can you speak to that and how it ties into bank of america and gm and
[2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:30.000]  these companies being forced to be cut up and given to
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:35.520]  to to foreign interest all right i'll say two things briefly one i'd
[2:42:35.520 --> 2:42:39.840]  having been in the reggae administration i don't think anybody there
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:43.920]  certainly not reagan none of us could possibly have conceived of where the
[2:42:43.920 --> 2:42:45.520]  united states would be
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:50.880]  you know a quarter of a century later this type of behavior
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:54.000]  i don't think we could even have conceived that we would have thought
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:58.800]  it was some kind of science fiction film you know or something
[2:42:58.800 --> 2:43:04.400]  and uh... so and i never saw any of those kinds of intentions it wasn't
[2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:08.800]  anything that if anybody was concerned with it it was going on
[2:43:08.800 --> 2:43:11.520]  it certainly wasn't anything that ever reached
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:17.520]  my years or awareness and i don't think it had anything
[2:43:17.520 --> 2:43:21.040]  whatsoever to do with reggae or his intentions of what he was trying to do
[2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:23.920]  so there's been that big of a flip-flop and change in
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:28.000]  washington culture it's just in a quarter of a century something
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:33.200]  has happened that none of us could have even dreamed of
[2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:37.040]  now the question on audit the fed it must be audit
[2:43:37.040 --> 2:43:40.160]  the fed didn't want to be audited because
[2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:44.720]  that they are allowed to use their profits
[2:43:44.720 --> 2:43:48.160]  for their own expenses and then whatever's left
[2:43:48.160 --> 2:43:52.560]  they are supposed to turn into the treasury so they probably don't want
[2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:56.240]  anyone to learn about their expenses they
[2:43:56.240 --> 2:43:59.600]  they probably live a grand life you know they have that
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:03.200]  uh... place up in jackson hole where they go every year
[2:44:03.200 --> 2:44:08.160]  for their conferences and it's just you know it's
[2:44:08.160 --> 2:44:11.440]  it's a grand life and they probably don't want
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:14.720]  anybody to see their expenses there of course there may be other reasons they
[2:44:14.720 --> 2:44:19.840]  don't want to be audited but i don't think a democracy
[2:44:19.840 --> 2:44:24.160]  or any kind of government can afford to have
[2:44:24.160 --> 2:44:27.920]  elements of it that aren't audited now when the
[2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:31.520]  general accounting office has tried to audit various parts of the united states
[2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:34.800]  government such as the pentagon or any any cabinet
[2:44:34.800 --> 2:44:39.440]  lovely they've often said that the information is so bad we can't do an
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:43.920]  audit and and so what we have is a situation
[2:44:43.920 --> 2:44:47.280]  where the united states government puts private firms in prison for having bad
[2:44:47.280 --> 2:44:51.040]  accounting practices but itself has no accounting practices that could
[2:44:51.040 --> 2:44:54.880]  even be audited exactly well the pentagon
[2:44:54.880 --> 2:44:58.880]  in hearings four years ago said they had two plus trillion missing
[2:44:58.880 --> 2:45:02.240]  and i've got rumsfeld on video saying i don't know where it is and we're not
[2:45:02.240 --> 2:45:05.040]  going to ever tell you and he brings up uh... doctor
[2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:08.720]  to the head of financing and he says we're not going to tell you
[2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:12.160]  it's it's just like bernacky to senator sanders going i'm not going to tell you
[2:45:12.160 --> 2:45:15.600]  where the money went that's right they did not if they know
[2:45:15.600 --> 2:45:19.600]  they're not going to tell you they may not know that they only know it part or
[2:45:19.600 --> 2:45:22.640]  and they use a lot of it to buy foreign governments
[2:45:22.640 --> 2:45:26.320]  you know i've said this before when i was uh... at my PhD
[2:45:26.320 --> 2:45:30.160]  the station chairman you know it was the second most powerful man the pentagon
[2:45:30.160 --> 2:45:33.840]  during the next years and he invited me to office once he wanted me to
[2:45:33.840 --> 2:45:38.240]  to do something for the government and uh...
[2:45:38.240 --> 2:45:41.440]  and i asked him i said how do these united states
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:45.360]  get all these foreign countries to do what they want all the time how they get
[2:45:45.360 --> 2:45:49.040]  them to do it he said money i said oh you mean foreign aid we get
[2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:52.080]  a foreign aid he said no no we just buy their governments
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:55.440]  we just give the leaders money
[2:45:55.440 --> 2:45:59.200]  and he wasn't proud of it it was he was just telling me
[2:45:59.200 --> 2:46:05.600]  a fact that was just the facts on the ground and i think that's true we own
[2:46:05.600 --> 2:46:09.600]  the european government we give them money let me ask you this question then
[2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:14.240]  what is going to happen that when the dollar finally dies or finally falls
[2:46:14.240 --> 2:46:19.040]  apart and it is no longer completely a monopolar system
[2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:23.200]  for a season a few years they'll still be the big military
[2:46:23.200 --> 2:46:27.040]  they won't be able to pay it well i understand but we're
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:30.160]  import dependent so will they use the military right
[2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:33.120]  one in implodes as the rand corporation says they may to start
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:36.160]  world war three as a cover or will it just implode
[2:46:36.160 --> 2:46:39.120]  i don't know i think it's just implode because there's no what there's no money
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:43.040]  they can't see we import dependent and we can't pay
[2:46:43.040 --> 2:46:46.560]  for the imports we can't feed people flow them there's no gasoline
[2:46:46.560 --> 2:46:49.920]  you can't make deliveries and they won't be able to buy off these governments
[2:46:49.920 --> 2:46:51.920]  well i mean even if we lose the world that's the main point
[2:46:51.920 --> 2:46:54.720]  that's the main point see this happened to the romans you know when the
[2:46:54.720 --> 2:46:58.640]  when the silver denarius the main monetary unit
[2:46:58.640 --> 2:47:02.320]  it got so uh inflated that it was nothing but lead
[2:47:02.320 --> 2:47:05.840]  it turned sensually into lead the silver coin became lead
[2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:12.160]  they couldn't buy off the barbarians they know what the damn lead
[2:47:12.160 --> 2:47:15.920]  it's the same thing again so it's just so our paper is being
[2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:21.040]  destroyed by over printing or whatever over creation
[2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:26.480]  and when when the when the thing goes and the chinese keep pointing
[2:47:26.480 --> 2:47:29.680]  that it's gonna go it's gonna go that worried because they're holding a
[2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:33.520]  trillion dollars and when it goes you can't buy
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:38.320]  people anymore you can't buy them and when it goes how fast will it go
[2:47:38.320 --> 2:47:42.240]  i think it starts it'll be very fast because everybody
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:47.760]  is the stocks that the world holds the dollars are immense you know there's a
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:50.800]  trillion in japan a trillion in china who knows how much
[2:47:50.800 --> 2:47:55.360]  the opac has probably another trillion the europeans i mean it's everywhere
[2:47:55.360 --> 2:47:59.920]  and when it starts losing its value it's like a stock market panic everybody
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:04.880]  sells right they sell they run for it they try to get something for it in
[2:48:04.880 --> 2:48:08.720]  order to and and so they're not gonna all sit
[2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:12.400]  there and say oh we can't panic because we'll drive the price down if you ever
[2:48:12.400 --> 2:48:15.920]  seen that happen to stock market no no well it ain't gonna happen with a
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:19.840]  dollar and all those idiots those financial gurus
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:23.920]  who say all the chinese will know do blah blah they'll lose
[2:48:23.920 --> 2:48:28.400]  dollars their value the dollars well why don't they say that about stocks
[2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:31.680]  well they don't know what they're talking about they're just spinning
[2:48:31.680 --> 2:48:35.760]  you know everything you hear is a lie it's just like you say
[2:48:35.760 --> 2:48:40.960]  well in closing um it was not barbarians that left
[2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:45.920]  at geithner uh when he told them everything was going to be just dandy
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:49.200]  and that and that they could have their money rise and that their dollar
[2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:52.400]  investments wouldn't fall which is ridiculous obviously keeping their
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:56.560]  yawn low is is is help keep them uh you know the dollars high as they keep
[2:48:56.560 --> 2:49:00.160]  selling their goods for those that don't understand that basic equation
[2:49:00.160 --> 2:49:06.800]  but in our final equation here um this is just like with the romans
[2:49:06.800 --> 2:49:10.960]  in 300 350 410 when alexac roam you're right
[2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:14.800]  uh the barbarians began laughing when they said we'll give you lead as money
[2:49:14.800 --> 2:49:19.120]  and then they knew real value and it looks like that's starting to happen
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:22.880]  you know like the chinese were laughing at geithner offering them lead
[2:49:22.880 --> 2:49:26.640]  that's i think you i think that's a good analogy alex you
[2:49:26.640 --> 2:49:30.400]  summed it up uh the chinese don't want our lead
[2:49:30.400 --> 2:49:33.520]  all right well what a lot of smart money people that have seen me write the
[2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:37.520]  pastor saying they think things are really gonna fireworks in october
[2:49:37.520 --> 2:49:42.960]  or who knows alex just keep in mind it it wasn't that long ago the goal was
[2:49:42.960 --> 2:49:50.640]  thirty five dollars an ounce what is it today nine thousand seventy uh
[2:49:50.640 --> 2:49:55.120]  what what are people predicting in the next year
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:59.280]  two thousand the other right now now from

[2:50:15.760 --> 2:50:20.640]  of our greatest power the dollar relationship from gold
[2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:25.120]  has changed from thirty five dollars an ounce to a thousand dollars now

[3:00:09.280 --> 3:00:20.720]  well to the next 30 minutes daniel sundata is our guest and he's a prominent 911 cruiser
[3:00:21.680 --> 3:00:28.640]  very gentlemanly intelligent great soul old soul as they say and that's the best way of
[3:00:28.640 --> 3:00:33.440]  describing him and he came out for the demonstration when i got arrested a few years ago about before
[3:00:33.440 --> 3:00:40.160]  911 protesting to the cover-up of the fact that was an inside job there at fox studios
[3:00:41.600 --> 3:00:47.600]  and he is also in the new world order film that came out on i of c he was caught on tape
[3:00:47.600 --> 3:00:51.680]  there with us and i was being arrested and of course he's the star of rescue me a lot of other
[3:00:51.680 --> 3:00:57.520]  movies and tv shows he had a lot of courage to go public and risk his whole hollywood slash tv
[3:00:57.520 --> 3:01:03.760]  career doing what he did just like charlie sheen and others did and uh then even to fight to even
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:08.400]  have the show cover the topic and i think they did in a pretty fair fashion obviously couldn't
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:13.440]  just be our side you know for to be mainstream tv but i'm just so proud of what he's done and he's
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:20.080]  a great asset to humanity and liberty on top of that uh it's great to have him on now we set him
[3:01:20.080 --> 3:01:24.960]  up like a couple days ago before this horrible guy went in and shot this poor security guard
[3:01:24.960 --> 3:01:31.920]  supposedly it looks like a black op to me at this holocaust memorial museum perfect timing
[3:01:31.920 --> 3:01:36.320]  when we're trying to audit the fed for that to happen uh and now they're trying to demonize
[3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:41.840]  ron paul they're trying to demonize 911 truthers saying this guy was a hero to him with no proof
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:46.160]  glenn beck just says that so we'll talk about it all in the next 30 minutes daniel senjata it's
[3:01:46.160 --> 3:01:50.080]  great to have you here with us oh as always alex it's great to be with you thank you so much for
[3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:53.520]  having me man thanks for spending time we got a few minutes before the break and a long time
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:57.760]  coming up but first off tell me about rescue me you really couldn't come on the air but that was
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:02.320]  all building up you wanted to just you know let that uh those programs air you got a lot of
[3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:06.480]  international attention you made some great points in the rescue me we're gonna play a clip of that
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:12.560]  coming up but uh tell me about the process of getting that on the tv show and uh you know behind
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:16.880]  the scenes and then what happened on air well the process was just you know talking about it a lot
[3:02:16.880 --> 3:02:23.120]  on set you know i think that eventually although uh peter denis fx sony i don't think that any of
[3:02:23.120 --> 3:02:28.240]  them are signing on to the you know to to my my perspective necessarily but i think that they saw
[3:02:28.240 --> 3:02:31.840]  that there was some dramatic mileage that could have that could be gotten out of it i think that
[3:02:31.840 --> 3:02:37.680]  they saw the no-brainer that if there was a platform on mainstream television uh on which
[3:02:37.680 --> 3:02:43.040]  to address the the subject that 911 was was the appropriate rather than rescue me was the
[3:02:43.040 --> 3:02:48.640]  appropriate venue being but it's based on post 911 new york city firefighters so you know i was
[3:02:48.640 --> 3:02:52.800]  in the final analysis i was very happy with the way that they treated the subject in general i
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:57.600]  mean it was it it came out better than i than i thought you know than i had hoped i guess i had
[3:02:57.600 --> 3:03:02.960]  wished um also that there had been a little bit more of a reaction either positive or negative
[3:03:02.960 --> 3:03:07.520]  it just kind of seemed like it aired and not that much was said about it other than the uh
[3:03:07.520 --> 3:03:12.640]  the hit piece that came out on fox and friends with great gut feel shooting his mouth off but um
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:15.920]  yeah there just wasn't there there wasn't as much of a reaction in general as i was kind of hoping
[3:03:15.920 --> 3:03:20.080]  that it would provoke i was hoping it would stimulate some conversation or some controversy
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:24.960]  oh it did on the web it did on talk radio across the country the mainstream media was smart though
[3:03:24.960 --> 3:03:28.720]  they learned with charlie sheen and rosio donnell to keep their mouth shut because they try to make
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:32.960]  us look like cooks but then it comes out that we're really the majority as the polls show
[3:03:33.680 --> 3:03:39.760]  absolutely true yes absolutely true well you know i mean at least it aired i don't think that it
[3:03:39.760 --> 3:03:44.480]  could only have been good in terms of you know uh yeah i'll tell you i'm sorry i'm jumping around
[3:03:44.480 --> 3:03:48.240]  but i'll tell you what my favorite scene was it was really great to be able to do those monologues
[3:03:48.240 --> 3:03:54.960]  where i got to you know list you know the you know our let's say our side of the case but uh my
[3:03:54.960 --> 3:03:59.760]  favorite 911 scene that they aired and rescued me was where michael lombardi's character the probie
[3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:05.040]  he and i are walking down the street and he's just telling me where his nature uh emotional
[3:04:05.040 --> 3:04:09.840]  resistance to the idea kind of came from you know he was saying you know if you're telling me that
[3:04:09.840 --> 3:04:14.320]  you know that the bad guys are are here in our own government it's just kind of like too much for
[3:04:14.320 --> 3:04:18.800]  me to process he was basically giving a voice to the cognitive dissonance that's responsible
[3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:23.520]  for a lot of people just dismissing the possibility that 911 could have been an inside job without
[3:04:23.520 --> 3:04:27.280]  ever even looking at the evidence and so i i really appreciated that particular scene
[3:04:27.280 --> 3:04:32.800]  that was fun to do absolutely later uh we'll uh play one of those clips here on air with daniel
[3:04:32.800 --> 3:04:41.200]  senjata daniel again i i don't i'm not saying this because i'm trying to butter daniel up
[3:04:41.200 --> 3:04:45.840]  he really needs to be honored you know somebody who's got a great career really breaking out
[3:04:45.840 --> 3:04:51.200]  and he does something that they try to blackball you for that is the just ultimate courage they
[3:04:51.200 --> 3:04:56.320]  say psychologically it's easier to charge a machine gun nest to do something that is seen
[3:04:56.320 --> 3:05:01.760]  as socially unpopular but it's only socially unpopular with the elite hello friends this is
[3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:06.240]  alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's

[3:08:27.680 --> 3:08:33.280]  that's just my videos we have the uh video of denis leary so i don't know if it's true there's a
[3:08:33.280 --> 3:08:37.840]  her Daniel and others talking about the upcoming episodes they come up and asking politely he
[3:08:37.840 --> 3:08:42.320]  goes how do you know that who are you who are you where that has him thrown out we can't play at
[3:08:42.320 --> 3:08:47.440]  youtube is down not my videos youtube itself has been having trouble the last few days and it's
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:51.120]  completely down right now that is the videos but if they come up the next 30 minutes we'll play a
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:55.360]  clip of that and we'll play some clips of daniel sonjata on the show rescue me daniel i don't
[3:08:55.360 --> 3:09:00.320]  want to stir up stuff with you and denis leary uh you know you're a classy guy and you're going
[3:09:00.320 --> 3:09:05.120]  back for another season with him but uh i mean i'm glad that he was still part of the show even
[3:09:05.120 --> 3:09:10.080]  though it had the 9 11 truth stuff in it but i'm surprised watching this response from him
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:16.080]  him very aggressive uh to nice people just asking questions in a book signing that he was even part
[3:09:16.080 --> 3:09:20.880]  of something that brought up 9 11 truth yeah i don't know i mean you know denis gets approached
[3:09:20.880 --> 3:09:25.360]  by a lot of people and i think that he you know i'm sure he's well aware of the controversial
[3:09:25.360 --> 3:09:29.360]  nature of the subject matter you know so to speak that it was going to provoke an probably
[3:09:29.360 --> 3:09:34.080]  anticipating that it would provoke an emotional response from both sides of the fence and maybe
[3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:39.120]  he just was wary of being ambushed you know he might not have known with cameras on you and
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:42.880]  somebody's asking you a question if he was being confronted or if he was just asking to
[3:09:42.880 --> 3:09:48.160]  you know being tacitly asked for his opinion um oh he might have thought it was tmz or something
[3:09:48.160 --> 3:09:52.400]  you never know you never know what went what went through his mind i mean again i i have to give
[3:09:52.400 --> 3:09:57.680]  i can only give denis you know credit and peter tolin credit and fx credit for you know for
[3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:02.080]  allowing the subject matter on the show and for treating it with a relative amount of fairness
[3:10:02.080 --> 3:10:07.600]  um i don't think at the end of it that franco my character was was left wearing a dump cap
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:12.400]  i think that they just kind of you know let everyone they they they showed all the different
[3:10:12.400 --> 3:10:18.160]  emotional responses from the guys in the house to uh uh shila the other character named shila
[3:10:18.160 --> 3:10:23.440]  who expresses her you know dissatisfaction with my with my opinion claiming that franco is turning
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:27.600]  you know turning her husband's death into a hobby but in general i think they just kind of
[3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:33.920]  let the audience decide for themselves and that that's that's laudable well it certainly is uh for
[3:10:33.920 --> 3:10:39.200]  those that haven't seen the show rescue me uh break down what was discussed in that episode
[3:10:39.760 --> 3:10:45.520]  um well it was a it was a subplot that stretched over about five episodes the way it started
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:50.160]  was a french journalist comes to the firehouse and she wants to interview the guys about their
[3:10:50.160 --> 3:10:56.880]  experiences on uh on 9 11 and their feelings about the day and so in a series of vignettes
[3:10:56.880 --> 3:11:04.000]  with her in interviewing us each of us uh i'm sorry with her interviewing each of us individually
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:07.920]  um when she gets to my character of course i launched into this two-minute monologue about
[3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:14.320]  how 9 11 wasn't inside job and the reasons why and uh then over the course of subsequent episodes
[3:11:14.320 --> 3:11:18.080]  you see the the responses from different characters in the firehouse you know some of
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:22.560]  them are violent i almost get into a physical confrontation with one character uh michael
[3:11:22.560 --> 3:11:27.680]  lombardi's character the probie uh in the firehouse kitchen and then we have kind of a reconciliation
[3:11:27.680 --> 3:11:32.960]  scene later on where he explains to me why he felt the way he felt so you know they they just
[3:11:32.960 --> 3:11:38.000]  allowed a lot of different perspectives to be communicated uh it would have been nice to
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:43.360]  have one person one character on the show be like yeah i agree with branko but um again just the
[3:11:43.360 --> 3:11:48.160]  fact that they allowed me yeah i mean let me say it's a distortion but again even allowing it on
[3:11:48.160 --> 3:11:53.120]  though and allowing one view is is is better than most so i'm not trying to just attack here
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:58.240]  but i've been to new york and many of the firefighters know it's an inside job they come
[3:11:58.240 --> 3:12:02.480]  to thank us shake our hands like i want to ask you about that but then there's all the videos of
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:08.880]  firefighters going it was like it was a foundry lava flowing you know things were melting uh the
[3:12:08.880 --> 3:12:12.400]  police saying get back they're gonna blow up building seven so can you speak to that i mean
[3:12:12.400 --> 3:12:16.800]  you live in new york you know these people yeah you're around firefighters you know you're the
[3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:22.400]  star of a show about firefighters what percentage would you say of them will tell you oh yeah daniel
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:27.520]  i agree with you uh well i don't know about i could not hazard a guess at the percentage of
[3:12:27.520 --> 3:12:32.000]  the total population of the fdny because i don't know the ball but i'll say out of the firefighters
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:37.920]  that i know i'd say about 60 of them are leaning towards us leaning towards our you know our our
[3:12:37.920 --> 3:12:41.680]  take on things that it was an inside job that something's fishy that we need to have a read a
[3:12:41.680 --> 3:12:48.880]  new investigation uh maybe 20 percent of the remaining 40 are undecided and then maybe 20 percent
[3:12:48.880 --> 3:12:54.720]  are violently opposed to the idea but i think more from the perspective of you know uh just not
[3:12:54.720 --> 3:13:00.800]  being able to fathom the depth of that kind of betrayal so it's uh but but in general i mean i
[3:13:00.800 --> 3:13:05.600]  know lots of firefighters that that feel exactly the way you feel to feel exactly the way i feel
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:11.440]  um so i don't really know what to say about that but well that's what i'm talking to bill
[3:13:11.440 --> 3:13:16.560]  dole three years ago he said about half or more of the families believe it's an inside job and
[3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:21.280]  then he does he lost his son joey i've since talked to some of those groups three years later they say
[3:13:21.280 --> 3:13:27.760]  oh it's basically 80 percent of us now and uh but the media keeps this distortion going the
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:34.080]  families don't like 9 11 truth the families are upset with us when conservatively more than half
[3:13:34.080 --> 3:13:38.720]  agree with us right right i mean you know oh you only have to look at it you know at a couple
[3:13:38.720 --> 3:13:43.920]  documentaries or do a couple searches on youtube when it's working and you can see the dissatisfaction
[3:13:43.920 --> 3:13:48.240]  of the families who were attending the 9 11 commission hearings i mean they were how many
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:53.280]  times were they interrupted by the the victims family members themselves screaming and yelling
[3:13:53.280 --> 3:13:57.280]  in anger and frustration because their questions were not only not being answered but were being
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:14:02.880]  completely sidestep uh you know i mean it's it's clear and obvious that when somebody says you're
[3:14:02.880 --> 3:14:07.360]  insulting the memories of those who died and you're causing pain to the victims families
[3:14:07.360 --> 3:14:13.280]  by asking for the truth that's that's a logical fallacy that is clearly you know it's it's really
[3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:18.240]  wrong yeah they're using the grief of the families and the dead as a shield against us for asking
[3:14:18.240 --> 3:14:23.040]  real questions yeah so so they're abusing the dead that's true that's true not only are they
[3:14:23.040 --> 3:14:28.160]  disrespecting the dead they are supporting those who at this still to this day have gotten away
[3:14:28.160 --> 3:14:33.520]  with mass murder so they should really think twice about using that uh using that excuse to dismiss
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:37.600]  what we have to say and these killers are still on the loose as well and planning to stage more
[3:14:37.600 --> 3:14:41.840]  events make make no mistake but the fact that we've been exposing them kind of takes that
[3:14:41.840 --> 3:14:48.880]  false flag tool away what did you think when uh new yorker magazine uh cy hersh and then even
[3:14:49.760 --> 3:14:54.160]  keith oberman came out admitted that dick cheney was planning to stage terror attacks on our ships
[3:14:54.160 --> 3:14:59.760]  to blame it on iran with us patrol boats painted up like iranians and then they tried to have that
[3:14:59.760 --> 3:15:04.400]  staged event with fake radio chatter saying we blow you up in one minute and i said that was
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:08.800]  staged at the time then it came out it was staged and then it comes out they ordered the torture
[3:15:08.800 --> 3:15:13.600]  i mean these really are war criminals these really are bad guys i mean this is on record
[3:15:13.600 --> 3:15:18.560]  they've staged so much terror in the past how can people not understand that it's normal to point
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:22.800]  the finger at them not just because of their history or the evidence but because the motive
[3:15:23.520 --> 3:15:28.560]  sure absolutely i mean only they stood to gain from you know from all of these atrocities you
[3:15:28.560 --> 3:15:33.840]  know it's it's it's kibono it's who has benefited certain with in the case of 9 11 it certainly
[3:15:33.840 --> 3:15:39.040]  wasn't the 19 people who supposedly died and and and you know in carrying out the attack
[3:15:39.040 --> 3:15:44.400]  certainly has been osama bin latin uh but uh you know arguably halliburton has certainly
[3:15:44.400 --> 3:15:50.000]  benefited dick cheney has certainly benefited uh you know other military contractors energy
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:54.480]  corporations uh yeah i mean the list goes on if you follow the money it's clear who has benefited
[3:15:54.480 --> 3:15:59.840]  and given the fact that they announced their agenda before the actual uh before the day um
[3:16:00.640 --> 3:16:05.280]  and then that agenda has been prosecuted every day since and they've been invoking 9 11 and
[3:16:05.280 --> 3:16:09.600]  and its victims as justification for you know everything that they've done here and everything
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:13.840]  that we've been doing abroad i mean it's it's it's quite clear i mean i don't understand where we
[3:16:13.840 --> 3:16:20.080]  wear this bottomless uh well of you know benefit of the doubt where where the where this comes from
[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:25.440]  and when does it finally run out i mean a government that lies about air quality and exposes people to
[3:16:25.440 --> 3:16:33.680]  toxic dust intentionally uh in order to reopen wall street a government that uh you know legalized
[3:16:33.680 --> 3:16:39.040]  torture uh that manufactures legal opinions in order to justify circumventing the constitution
[3:16:39.040 --> 3:16:44.480]  so that they can torture people uh a government that illegally wiretaps and look on oberman you
[3:16:44.480 --> 3:16:48.640]  had russell teisko on there about three months ago and tell oberman to his face that that the
[3:16:48.640 --> 3:16:52.880]  nsa was collecting information specifically collecting information on intellectuals and
[3:16:52.880 --> 3:16:58.560]  journalists uh and you see you see oberman space go white there for a second and congress and
[3:16:58.560 --> 3:17:05.120]  congress i mean like what more i mean with all of these damning you know realities what where is
[3:17:05.120 --> 3:17:09.440]  the i don't understand when when is the wall of cognitive distance finally going to break
[3:17:09.440 --> 3:17:14.320]  and people just accept the fact uh or at least entertain the very serious possibility and look
[3:17:14.320 --> 3:17:18.240]  at the evidence of 9 11 being an inside job and all these other things that you're talking about
[3:17:18.240 --> 3:17:23.200]  i mean and in this day and time there's just so much going on alex my head swirls i sometimes
[3:17:23.200 --> 3:17:27.920]  cannot sometimes for a couple weeks i literally just have to totally tune out because i feel like
[3:17:27.920 --> 3:17:33.040]  it's just too much i can't you know continue with my baby i can't continue just living life normally
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:37.920]  because i'm so caught up in all these tectonic events that seem to just come one right after
[3:17:37.920 --> 3:17:44.080]  the other it's the economy it's pipe bombs being detonated in new jersey it's you know the
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:48.240]  master at the jewish museum or this this unfortunate shooting of the security guard at the jewish

[3:24:20.560 --> 3:24:25.600]  oh i can't start playing that song without hearing the rest of it i'm gonna come in with
[3:24:25.600 --> 3:24:38.480]  that next break we're gonna finish up with daniel senjata and then he says he'll come back the next
[3:24:38.480 --> 3:24:42.480]  month for a full hour take your calls they've got some family stuff coming up today daniel the time
[3:24:42.480 --> 3:24:47.360]  we have left you were saying and i jumped in and started seconding you uh you were saying that it
[3:24:47.360 --> 3:24:51.920]  seemed like desperation exactly it was like insecure and panicked and they knew they were
[3:24:51.920 --> 3:24:57.520]  doing something dirty trying to say not that this guy was a hero of 9 11 truth but with no source
[3:24:57.520 --> 3:25:01.760]  yeah exactly that i guess that's the only other point i wanted to make is based on what because
[3:25:01.760 --> 3:25:06.320]  he gives this uh this brief caveat he's like that's where that's what the evidence points to now it's
[3:25:06.320 --> 3:25:10.400]  early we can't confirm this just like with the fema camps he can he can either confirm or deny at
[3:25:10.400 --> 3:25:14.400]  the end of the day but with this particular thing you would think if he's going to open his mouth and
[3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:19.520]  say something like that and link a notoriously nonviolent movement like 9 11 truth with something
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:24.560]  as despicable as what happened at that museum that day uh i think you better have a source you
[3:25:24.560 --> 3:25:28.160]  better have a reason for saying something like that and i just hope that everybody listening to
[3:25:28.160 --> 3:25:35.600]  the show will uh will just assault uh glenbeck's email and telephone nonstop until he issues some
[3:25:35.600 --> 3:25:40.000]  type of an apology because just like with the herald or vera thing uh trying to link us to the
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:44.560]  bombing in time square i mean this is just it's so it just smacks of such desperation it's so
[3:25:44.560 --> 3:25:48.400]  pathetic and it's just so you can even tell in their body language that they knew that they were
[3:25:48.400 --> 3:25:53.920]  lying uh glenn is just he's a despicable character i hate to speak badly of anyone but that was
[3:25:53.920 --> 3:25:59.920]  well going back to the tape which we play but youtube's down he he does three provisos that
[3:25:59.920 --> 3:26:03.920]  well it's an early report and it's not really confirmed so we don't know if it's true but
[3:26:03.920 --> 3:26:11.840]  but then he says the new senate's this guy was a hero to 9 11 truth i mean 9 11 truth is very
[3:26:11.840 --> 3:26:17.520]  diverse obviously but i would call it more classical liberal progressive overall than
[3:26:17.520 --> 3:26:22.400]  i would call it conservative but i mean it you know it's every stripe but it decries racism
[3:26:22.400 --> 3:26:27.600]  and things like that sure i mean who from the 9 11 truth community has been advocating or calling
[3:26:27.600 --> 3:26:33.520]  for violence no one as a matter of fact we want to avoid it at all costs it's not us who's you
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:37.840]  know who's perpetrating the violence we're trying to expose those who have committed violent acts
[3:26:37.840 --> 3:26:42.640]  because we don't want to see that you know we don't want bloodshed we decry that so we'll take
[3:26:42.640 --> 3:26:47.200]  we are change take we are change they're all about gondy be the change you want to see in the world
[3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:50.400]  nonviolent and they keep saying they're going to be violent they're going to be violent and then
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:54.560]  it starts materializing they're manufacturing it one way or another it's not true there's the
[3:26:54.560 --> 3:26:59.600]  essay on screen daniel shinjata intellectual dishonesty in the age of universal deceit 9 11
[3:26:59.600 --> 3:27:04.160]  blogger dot com in the last three minutes you've got the floor take us out daniel shinjata i guess
[3:27:04.160 --> 3:27:10.080]  a message to keep 9 11 truth exploding or they'll stage more terror yeah i mean i i think that's
[3:27:10.080 --> 3:27:15.200]  a very likely possibility i mean you know who most of everybody listening right now knows
[3:27:15.200 --> 3:27:19.840]  for a fact that something is wrong with with what we've been told about 9 11 we needed a
[3:27:19.840 --> 3:27:24.480]  reinvestigation that's clear there's been a lot of progress that's been made on many fronts all
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:31.920]  kind you know alex has made a movie upon movie upon movie uh the core of corruption series has been
[3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:37.360]  very eye-opening and enlightening that the uh fabled enemies uh jason bermas film really great
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:42.400]  job on that i mean on so many fronts we're making progress and i think that we just have to continue
[3:27:42.400 --> 3:27:48.880]  to you know to storm the castle we uh we can't get complacent it's it's it's palpable right now i
[3:27:48.880 --> 3:27:53.280]  think in the air i think people could feel that there's that there's something on the horizon
[3:27:53.280 --> 3:27:56.800]  and i don't think that people might be a little bit i feel a bit scared not knowing is it going to
[3:27:56.800 --> 3:28:00.080]  be something positive is going to be something negative i think we could certainly make it
[3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:04.000]  something positive i think humanity stands the threshold of a real opportunity for a
[3:28:04.480 --> 3:28:09.280]  uh a quantum transformation uh not just and i don't mean to you know get all
[3:28:09.840 --> 3:28:13.920]  metaphysical and spiritual but i think it's a tipping point we're going into evil we're
[3:28:13.920 --> 3:28:18.560]  going into good it we gotta make a choice we really do have to make a choice and and and the
[3:28:18.560 --> 3:28:22.960]  battle lines are i mean the it's clear it's clear your team as you say all the time you're either on
[3:28:22.960 --> 3:28:28.400]  the side of humanity free humanity or you're on the side of of the globalist at this point and
[3:28:28.400 --> 3:28:33.920]  being neutral is really not an option neutrality equals uh you know equals couldn't i don't know
[3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:39.280]  what tassan consent yeah you know to consent to what we what we know in our guts is evil and
[3:28:39.280 --> 3:28:44.240]  is wrong so we we really can't afford to be on the sidelines right now we have to be in the game
[3:28:44.240 --> 3:28:49.120]  that's the reason why i tried my hand my neophyte hand at right you know just generating an article
[3:28:49.120 --> 3:28:54.480]  about how oh it's excellent i hope you do more wow go ahead thank you out but you know just
[3:28:54.480 --> 3:28:59.760]  that the way that the the media unfairly addresses the issue of 9-11 well when they even address it
[3:28:59.760 --> 3:29:04.960]  at all it's either the wiggle you know it's the style of glenn beck or or joe scarborough or bill
[3:29:04.960 --> 3:29:10.480]  o'reilly or it's total blackout and that's it's really a shame i don't know how many more articles
[3:29:10.480 --> 3:29:15.600]  alan miller has to publish about 41 intelligence experts and people from inside the intelligence
[3:29:15.600 --> 3:29:21.520]  community saying 9-11 wasn't inside job or you know people from the uh in the other inside other
[3:29:21.520 --> 3:29:28.240]  branches of the government um pilots for 9-11 truth 700 engineers it's just it's ridiculous
[3:29:28.240 --> 3:29:32.320]  at this point i mean we clearly have a critical mass of experts from relevant fields of expertise
[3:29:32.320 --> 3:29:37.040]  now all we need is the platform where they can speak what they know and people like me
[3:29:37.040 --> 3:29:43.040]  can't get out of the way we're just you know then just let them have the floor daniel senjata let me

[3:38:03.680 --> 3:38:10.000]  how above and beyond that we went we're gonna hire more webmasters more video editors bigger tv
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:17.680]  studio everything because of your support we salute you all right you know i got into this
[3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:24.240]  abc news ap also this is the news of australia originally broke it was the australian uh vioxx
[3:38:24.240 --> 3:38:30.000]  maker murk and co drew up dr hit list for those to be liquidated those to be killed that's mainstream
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:35.680]  news those criticizing their drugs that are killing people like vioxx and the human papillomavirus
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:42.080]  cigar to sell drugs and these are hardcore people got articles with the local police and military
[3:38:42.080 --> 3:38:48.000]  training for gun confiscation we broke two days ago that the vfw is being told to prepare
[3:38:48.800 --> 3:38:55.200]  even civil war cannons and things and spanish-american war guns rifles daggers so the batf can
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:39:01.200]  confiscate them when they need to uh that's happening obama alst americor's director
[3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:06.240]  who investigated friend ap reports obama incredibly corrupt president obama says
[3:39:06.240 --> 3:39:10.240]  he has lost confidence in the inspector general who investigates americor and other national
[3:39:10.240 --> 3:39:14.560]  service programs and has told congress he is removing him from the position obama's move
[3:39:14.560 --> 3:39:21.520]  follows an investigation by ig jerald walpin finding misuse of federal grants by a nonpartisan
[3:39:21.520 --> 3:39:26.480]  education group led by sacramento mayor kevin johnson who is an obama supporter and former
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:31.680]  nba basketball star walpin was criticized by the acting u.s attorney and sacramento for the way he
[3:39:31.680 --> 3:39:35.760]  handled the investigation of johnson and saint hope academy a nonprofit group that received hundreds
[3:39:35.760 --> 3:39:39.760]  of thousands of dollars and federal grants from the corporation of national community service
[3:39:39.760 --> 3:39:45.440]  so obama's fired this person to cover up he's already of the stimulus package four billion
[3:39:45.440 --> 3:39:53.360]  to acorn and americor and city year run by the uh carl rove of four to five administrations you can
[3:39:53.360 --> 3:40:01.120]  debate that uh david gergen erin a few weeks ago did a huge report and and and that's those videos
[3:40:01.120 --> 3:40:06.240]  they put on tv with taxpayer money of this is my uniform i'm city year and red and black uniforms
[3:40:06.240 --> 3:40:11.840]  marching and tattletale squads their own private political army illegally being recruited with
[3:40:11.840 --> 3:40:18.240]  federal money oh acorn's not corrupt during the election and then just look at it now
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:29.280]  so obama is just a big chicago machine corrupt thug now look at this i want to shift gears into
[3:40:29.280 --> 3:40:38.240]  the another subject i have interviewed ben livingston the meteorologist the father of
[3:40:38.240 --> 3:40:47.280]  weather weapons uh the guy's amazing world war two vet flew into uh hurricanes are in our side
[3:40:47.280 --> 3:40:52.480]  of the world and they only go up to about 200 miles an hour they go up 250 300 miles an hour
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:41:00.000]  and they call them typhoons flew into typhoons he was their leading fighter squadrons in vietnam
[3:41:00.560 --> 3:41:05.280]  manipulating he would go in with there were no clouds and and make it rain 10 feet on the ho Chi
[3:41:05.280 --> 3:41:10.640]  men trail just amazing and i i got sent documents by a listener going this was just declassified
[3:41:10.640 --> 3:41:16.320]  i think was 2002 well you present planet our tv members can watch the ben livingston interviews
[3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:20.080]  but the point is and they got ripped to the youtube channel so it's out there but in high
[3:41:20.080 --> 3:41:25.600]  quality for present planet our tv members the the issue is that he was the father of weather
[3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:30.800]  weapons he got stanford research institute to develop and he became the head uh of the uh
[3:41:32.720 --> 3:41:38.640]  it was the navy after that the navy weapons laboratory just an amazing individual and he
[3:41:38.640 --> 3:41:44.640]  flew these fighter jets into typhoons he uh he uh you know did all of this stuff he was the first
[3:41:44.640 --> 3:41:51.440]  got to fly into hurricanes and typhoons and by 1967 they had certified that they could kill
[3:41:51.440 --> 3:41:57.840]  hurricanes make hurricanes weaken hurricanes strengthen hurricanes and he said with today's
[3:41:57.840 --> 3:42:02.400]  technologies back then we take a hundred aircraft with eight aircraft he could go in and kill a
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:12.560]  hurricane or make a hurricane and he was calling for a department of weather to control the weather
[3:42:12.560 --> 3:42:18.080]  and he also runs a big weather control operation he's their chief meteorologist he got some heat
[3:42:18.080 --> 3:42:21.440]  coming on the show and he's still a nice guy but he won't come on after he originally came on because
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:25.840]  he got a lot of heat from the spooks we kind of snuck up on folks because because i got the documents
[3:42:25.840 --> 3:42:30.320]  from a listener that was nowhere in the news i checked the national archives found they just
[3:42:30.320 --> 3:42:35.360]  been declassified six months before these listeners giving us tips i called ben livingston
[3:42:35.360 --> 3:42:39.520]  i said i'd like to have you on the radio had him on suddenly it was fox news seeing in but still
[3:42:39.520 --> 3:42:42.800]  they hadn't interviewed him i said fly here next week i want to interview you that's going to be
[3:42:42.800 --> 3:42:50.560]  in the chemtrail film but the issue is is that he got here and he got into weather control now
[3:42:50.560 --> 3:42:54.480]  that's separate from harp and all these other technologies but the issue is they could control
[3:42:54.480 --> 3:43:02.800]  hurricanes in 67 what is it that's 40 years ago isn't it yeah 40 years ago 42 three years ago
[3:43:03.760 --> 3:43:08.560]  so then they say there's no weather control and then we started noticing in the mid 90s that
[3:43:08.560 --> 3:43:12.800]  suddenly condensation trails were forming at two or three thousand feet in the summer impossible
[3:43:12.800 --> 3:43:16.800]  and they were staying there for hours and they'd always disappeared even in high altitudes in a
[3:43:16.800 --> 3:43:22.480]  few minutes and then we started getting reports of low altitude spring high altitude spring helicopter
[3:43:22.480 --> 3:43:28.720]  spring declassified admissions of spring subtilist globa g bacteria all over new mexico all over
[3:43:28.720 --> 3:43:36.080]  texas oklahoma killing people with it uh that was in the end the daily oklahoman all of this is
[3:43:36.080 --> 3:43:45.440]  going on and happening and still your call to kuk if you talk about it and then i began to interview
[3:43:45.440 --> 3:43:52.240]  meteorologist uh and a climatologist on this show and weathermen from major tv stations going no no
[3:43:52.240 --> 3:43:56.400]  yeah you can see them spraying here and now in florida news they go look at all these lines
[3:43:56.400 --> 3:44:00.640]  sprayed somebody the government's doing that but it doesn't look like chaff chaff's in a small area
[3:44:00.640 --> 3:44:05.120]  it was like you know like the whole area blocking storms about to hit i guess to keep the drought
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:12.160]  going and so everybody all these meteorologists who learned that this isn't normal they're now going
[3:44:12.160 --> 3:44:17.840]  oh that's because there's new phenomenon new clouds new systems being discovered and it's
[3:44:17.840 --> 3:44:24.480]  normal to have barium salts and aluminum dioxide raining down and we said folks it's at least a
[3:44:24.480 --> 3:44:29.760]  weather modification program with a bunch of other programs rolled in then listeners begin to email us
[3:44:29.760 --> 3:44:36.560]  two years ago going high altitude aerosol spraying google that so i googled it and it was thousands
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:41.440]  department of energy the japanese department of energy german department of energy and power and
[3:44:41.440 --> 3:44:47.040]  british and all these countries and nasa saying we've dim the earth by 20 for its safety and
[3:44:47.040 --> 3:44:50.880]  kids textbooks they always tell parents there's no plan to ship you but then the kids textbooks
[3:44:50.880 --> 3:44:54.640]  say we're gonna chip you it's good you know there's a world government it's good you know the textbooks
[3:44:54.640 --> 3:44:58.880]  they tell parents doesn't exist but your kids being taught it's good you know the weird psychological
[3:44:58.880 --> 3:45:04.960]  warfare going on textbooks saying it was happening and then a few months ago his his head of science
[3:45:04.960 --> 3:45:09.120]  department comes out obama and says oh we're going to spray the skies with barium salts and
[3:45:09.120 --> 3:45:14.080]  aluminum dioxide to save the earth from global warming when the science actually shows it's
[3:45:14.080 --> 3:45:18.080]  causing warming which they may need to do it looks like we're going into an ice age and they're
[3:45:18.080 --> 3:45:22.160]  trying to block it and they would do that would really be an ice age they're trying to block it
[3:45:22.160 --> 3:45:26.560]  and they said we've got to have a carbon tax to control a science heat so that so they can then
[3:45:26.560 --> 3:45:30.880]  as we get cold say that they save us from that i don't know what they're doing can they use the
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:34.720]  weather weapons they admittedly have to cause all these problems and then say oh look it's climate
[3:45:34.720 --> 3:45:39.040]  change do what we want that's what witch doctors would do thousands of years ago every time there
[3:45:39.040 --> 3:45:44.720]  was a problem they'd say the who'd you god had done it or whatever it's all psychology it's all
[3:45:44.720 --> 3:45:50.160]  chicanery and scams and bamboozling people but we know they have weather weapons we know the
[3:45:50.160 --> 3:45:56.720]  program is going on and then suddenly they just come out and say okay we're doing test thousands
[3:45:56.720 --> 3:46:02.240]  of agencies around the world and and companies and and and tens of billions of dollars we know
[3:46:02.240 --> 3:46:07.520]  of the year i mean you can go spend the entire weekend it's friday go look at kim trails admitted
[3:46:07.520 --> 3:46:13.520]  or uh passive and non passive aerosol altitude spraying campaigns google terms like that tens
[3:46:13.520 --> 3:46:18.240]  of thousands of hits universities how they're spraying the tests they did how it's added to jet
[3:46:18.240 --> 3:46:23.440]  fuel dispersed out of the engines just just it's all compartmentalized it goes through the jet fuel
[3:46:23.440 --> 3:46:27.680]  companies they put it in there and some of them actually have sprayers some of the systems dispersed
[3:46:27.680 --> 3:46:32.880]  and aerosolized with a particular the nuclei out of the aircraft i mean it's it's just like they put
[3:46:32.880 --> 3:46:37.520]  sodium fluoride in the water it's compartmentalized and the idiot pouring it in at the water plant he
[3:46:37.520 --> 3:46:42.480]  thinks it's good he's not bad like doctors giving people vioxx it's killing them they think it's good
[3:46:42.480 --> 3:46:47.280]  meanwhile merc's got hit teams out taking people out that's in mainstream federal courts and nobody
[3:46:47.280 --> 3:46:54.320]  cares i mean you understand the magnitude of the insanity of all this and so i have this ap
[3:46:54.320 --> 3:47:02.000]  article and i saw this a year ago this is june 11th from yesterday but i saw universities debating
[3:47:02.800 --> 3:47:06.240]  previously there were three kinds of clouds now they're saying there's three or four other new
[3:47:06.240 --> 3:47:11.600]  types and there's these weird little clouds that they say form in trails and have chemicals in them
[3:47:11.600 --> 3:47:17.600]  and they fall on us and they don't know where they come from and our space particles coalescing in
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:22.800]  the atmosphere and the scientists can't say it's man-made so they're going i don't know there's new
[3:47:22.800 --> 3:47:30.880]  clouds now here's ap right here ladies and gentlemen but to discredit it they don't focus
[3:47:30.880 --> 3:47:35.920]  in on the scientist meteorologist climatologist saying this they focus in on a woman's photo and
[3:47:35.920 --> 3:47:43.600]  act like there's this big debate meteorology and a climatology and those that are studying hydrology
[3:47:43.600 --> 3:47:49.120]  in the ocean this is saw out they make it about a woman who took a photo so now there's a debate
[3:47:49.120 --> 3:47:53.520]  about it because usually they would deny this i'm seeing clouds at a thousand feet that are
[3:47:53.520 --> 3:47:57.280]  weird chemicals and and and they burn your eyes and they hit the ground they look like chemical
[3:47:57.280 --> 3:48:03.440]  sprays um you saw an alien you take photos oh you photoshop that you walk outside they're everywhere
[3:48:03.440 --> 3:48:08.800]  and they're going that's normal uh you know it's like body snatchers or something just go to sleep
[3:48:09.440 --> 3:48:13.520]  that's a metaphor for turning your intellect off and everything will be all right sleep sleep
[3:48:14.400 --> 3:48:21.600]  iowa woman's photo sparks push for new cloud type ap looking out the 11th floor window of her law
[3:48:21.600 --> 3:48:28.480]  office jane wiggins did a double take and grabbed her camera the dark undulating clouds hovering
[3:48:28.480 --> 3:48:32.480]  outside wearing like anything she'd seen before it looked like armageddon said wiggins
[3:48:32.480 --> 3:48:37.440]  wiggins a paralegal and amateur photographer and cedar rapids iowa the shadows of the clouds the
[3:48:37.440 --> 3:48:43.440]  lights and the darks and the greenish yellow backdrop they seem to change yeah chemical clouds
[3:48:43.440 --> 3:48:48.800]  will do that first time i ever saw it was a naturally occurring because they'd do it on purpose
[3:48:48.800 --> 3:48:55.280]  over chemical plants in houston a weird little green cloud at a thousand feet toxic cloud um
[3:48:55.280 --> 3:49:02.800]  um they dispersed disappeared within 15 minutes but with the photos wiggins captured in june 2006
[3:49:02.800 --> 3:49:07.520]  intrigue and stumped a group of dedicated weather watchers who are now pushing weather authority
[3:49:07.520 --> 3:49:12.080]  to create a new cloud category something that hasn't been done since 1951 breaking into the
[3:49:12.080 --> 3:49:19.520]  cloud family would require surviving uh serving layers of skeptical interviews reviews still
[3:49:19.520 --> 3:49:25.840]  Gavin um and his england based cloud appreciation society are determined to establish a new
[3:49:25.840 --> 3:49:31.920]  variety and it goes on up the new variety just look at nasa public satellite photos
[3:49:31.920 --> 3:49:36.720]  like let's pull up the time we have left we'll see we can do it the last segment google um
[3:49:37.600 --> 3:49:44.720]  live nasa live nasa satellite west coast and let's go look at california and see all the lines
[3:49:44.720 --> 3:49:50.320]  sprayed and and then there's meteorology of the whole country everywhere just lines everywhere
[3:49:50.320 --> 3:49:55.920]  everywhere and you'll see a weather front coming in and the planes come in and put it in front of
[3:49:55.920 --> 3:50:02.720]  it to block it i mean they're spraying us 24 7 and they the white house admits it they've gone so
[3:50:02.720 --> 3:50:08.320]  far now there's all these new little green clouds raining things down on us and they're going they

[3:55:59.840 --> 3:56:09.920]  is all about eugenics and these people mean uh mean very very serious business so we certainly
[3:56:09.920 --> 3:56:14.800]  need to continue to look into that and here's another one uh obama hasn't just introduced
[3:56:14.800 --> 3:56:18.960]  more than 10 big bills that basically in the second amendment as we know it and then as
[3:56:18.960 --> 3:56:24.560]  these bills move through congress he denies he wants your guns here's world that daily obama
[3:56:24.560 --> 3:56:30.720]  would eliminate eight out of ten pocket knives if this were to pass you could not cross a state
[3:56:30.720 --> 3:56:36.080]  line with one it would be a felony the u.s customs and border protection agencies proposing a new
[3:56:36.080 --> 3:56:40.640]  definition that would be used to eliminate eight of ten legal pocket knives in the united states
[3:56:40.640 --> 3:56:44.800]  right now according to activists who are gearing up to fight the plan the federal bureaucracy
[3:56:44.800 --> 3:56:50.320]  is accepting comments so now when you go to an airport and the things you know half an inch
[3:56:50.320 --> 3:56:56.480]  long now we'll go to prison for it well they love putting the slaves in prison it's what big
[3:56:56.480 --> 3:57:00.800]  business that's what america is now the federal bureaucracy is accepting comments written only
[3:57:00.800 --> 3:57:07.440]  that must be received by june 21st before its plan changes would become final said dug ridder
[3:57:08.000 --> 3:57:13.040]  of knife rights dot org let's get him on so the implications of the decision would be far reaching
[3:57:13.040 --> 3:57:17.200]  since many state and federal agencies depend on the agency definitions determine what is legal
[3:57:17.200 --> 3:57:22.000]  in the united states so you're trying to drive back in from xcar canada with your rv now you're
