[00:32.600 --> 00:43.560]  Tuesday the sixth day of March 2012 on this Tuesday edition we're going to be
[00:43.560 --> 00:50.360]  here for the next three hours we have David Ike love him hate him certainly an
[00:50.360 --> 00:55.720]  icon of opening up your mind and not trusting the system he will be joining
[00:55.720 --> 01:01.160]  us in the second hour today to talk about Iran the open-world government and
[01:01.160 --> 01:13.400]  2012 Bruce Fine who is the chief advisor on policy to Congressman Ron Paul
[01:13.400 --> 01:18.280]  presidential candidate will be joining us for one hour in the third hour and I
[01:18.280 --> 01:25.840]  will take calls for both men today in the balance of the time we have here
[01:25.840 --> 01:32.240]  Obama shifts location of G8 summit from hometown of Chicago to his Camp David
[01:32.240 --> 01:38.280]  retreat that tells me they're looking very strongly at having the war with
[01:38.280 --> 01:46.200]  Iran that's a high-security facility in area during that period just like they
[01:46.200 --> 01:50.400]  launched the attack on Russian held areas in Georgia during 888 all the
[01:50.400 --> 01:55.800]  world leaders were together in China for the Olympics they tend to do things
[01:55.800 --> 01:59.640]  like this only when there's about to be a war in fact can't David is the number
[01:59.640 --> 02:08.320]  one alternate government site after DC and then number two site is of course
[02:08.320 --> 02:18.800]  alternate between site are in Maryland and Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado
[02:18.800 --> 02:23.040]  there in Colorado Springs and that ties into an underground government
[02:23.040 --> 02:27.720]  complex the real long-term Northcom command center government is in
[02:27.720 --> 02:34.480]  Colorado but their alternate meeting places the underground shadow
[02:34.480 --> 02:37.720]  government system is based in Colorado more than anywhere else but it's got
[02:37.720 --> 02:42.240]  constellations in Maryland in Virginia in Texas in California in many other
[02:42.240 --> 02:46.680]  areas but I'm getting into COG technicalities the point is the fact that
[02:46.680 --> 02:52.040]  they're moving it to this high-security facility with underground railways under
[02:52.040 --> 02:55.160]  it and the rest of it oh I'm not supposed to know that that got the NSA
[02:55.160 --> 03:00.400]  going right there the fact that all of that's happening there and that they're
[03:00.400 --> 03:03.680]  gonna have all the world leaders at Camp David means get ready for something
[03:03.680 --> 03:11.080]  big and there's the headlines here Benjamin Netanyahu declares war that's
[03:11.080 --> 03:18.080]  basically what his apex speech was on Iran headline Israel reserves the right
[03:18.080 --> 03:22.120]  to strike my supreme responsibility as prime minister of Israel is to ensure
[03:22.120 --> 03:30.120]  that Israel remains the master of its fate I thought fates like bad
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.240]  connotation you mean master of its destiny
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.240]  you notice all this is happening as the world hurdles into depression as
[03:41.240 --> 03:45.160]  world governments openly announced this giant war that's being prepared is the
[03:45.160 --> 03:53.440]  political distraction is the political distraction that they need to clamp down
[03:53.440 --> 03:57.880]  domestically and it's gonna help the moolas as well they want to hold on to
[03:57.880 --> 04:01.520]  power they don't care if their country gets bombed or wrecked they that will
[04:01.520 --> 04:07.040]  actually keep them in power and hey Iran is up to the Iranian people I don't
[04:07.040 --> 04:14.520]  dislike Iran I admire their science and culture same thing with Israel people or
[04:14.520 --> 04:20.320]  people and I just want to get the parasitic elites that all behave and
[04:20.320 --> 04:25.120]  act the same out of control of our society and how is that gonna
[04:25.120 --> 04:29.520]  happen let's go start to happen when we start being involved in the political
[04:29.520 --> 04:33.680]  process and really being wise and informed and involved the people perish
[04:33.680 --> 04:40.240]  for lack of knowledge and evil people love war it is the health of the state
[04:40.240 --> 04:44.760]  is the health of tyranny war is the health of oppression and despotism it is
[04:44.760 --> 04:47.920]  the health of the strongman the king rat all right that's only tip of the
[04:47.920 --> 04:52.840]  iceberg on land security now I'm gonna be on the campuses just huge news today

[05:03.160 --> 05:07.360]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[05:07.360 --> 05:11.600]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[05:11.600 --> 05:15.520]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[05:15.520 --> 05:19.160]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[05:19.160 --> 05:23.720]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:23.720 --> 05:27.720]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.720 --> 05:31.520]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.520 --> 05:35.160]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:35.160 --> 05:39.480]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[09:41.240 --> 09:46.240]  state or the president in any way to national security and that means
[09:46.240 --> 09:51.760]  mega banks ruling America and looting and robbing us from every angle anybody
[09:51.760 --> 09:55.080]  that tries to dislodge the criminal enterprise that runs our country in any
[09:55.080 --> 10:00.360]  way is a threat to the nation because the nation isn't America anymore it's a
[10:00.360 --> 10:06.080]  it's a banker holding we're kind of like a person that a vampire keeps in a
[10:06.080 --> 10:13.520]  closet just go in occasionally and have snacks on it's like that movie coma or
[10:13.520 --> 10:18.600]  something they just uses for your body parts for the Empire they have us all
[10:18.600 --> 10:24.800]  jacked in just slowly sucking our blood at their leisure and so that's what's
[10:24.800 --> 10:29.760]  going on and now I've got all these articles where they're like well yeah
[10:29.760 --> 10:33.520]  we won't just secretly arrest you what will kill you will secretly arrest you
[10:33.520 --> 10:37.000]  in America but not kill you in America but if you're a citizen overseas
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.400]  anywhere it will kill you and we'll bob any country we want world by
[10:40.400 --> 10:44.680]  declaration of war and you heard Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer who
[10:44.680 --> 10:50.360]  ran the anti-bin Laden program and could have killed him in 2001 and 2000 and was
[10:50.360 --> 10:58.360]  ordered not to say that and we're all a lock he is a FBI asset now of course
[10:58.360 --> 11:03.720]  that's even in Fox News that got leaked the Pentagon did not deny it a few years
[11:03.720 --> 11:07.840]  ago AP Fox News picked it up and just Riley said you know and we're all
[11:07.840 --> 11:12.640]  lucky was Pentagon dinner to ask with the Secretary of the Army of course he
[11:12.640 --> 11:17.680]  was born in America so was Adam Perlman of the five leaders of al-Qaeda who they
[11:17.680 --> 11:22.360]  jockey and say who's number number one four of them were born in America and on
[11:22.360 --> 11:27.800]  record trained at Lainling and just just absolute intelligence operatives who in
[11:27.800 --> 11:32.000]  American production quality videos say we're going to attack you dirty
[11:32.000 --> 11:41.000]  Americans I mean it's so ridiculous that it makes your head spin the
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.560]  underwear bomber the Fort Hood shooter the the the Times Square bomber I mean
[11:46.560 --> 11:49.760]  look this up and you heard Colonel Schaefer say yes yesterday that's all
[11:49.760 --> 11:54.000]  true and again he's a credible well-known best-selling author government
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.360]  think tanks he's telling you this imagine what he's really thinking imagine
[11:58.360 --> 12:02.880]  what the rest of the good people in the Pentagon who are compartmentalized people
[12:02.880 --> 12:05.760]  like Fletcher Proud he was who was exposing the fact of the government to
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.560]  kill Kennedy he he was the in the type of position that Colonel Schaefer was he
[12:10.560 --> 12:17.240]  was the liaison between the Pentagon and the CIA and black ops running assassinations
[12:17.240 --> 12:22.800]  and overthrows worldwide they literally told him you're going to the North Pole
[12:22.800 --> 12:27.640]  this week and you're not to be in contact with any of your sources for the
[12:27.640 --> 12:34.160]  next two weeks and he'd never had that happening went oh and they're like yeah
[12:34.160 --> 12:39.400]  they had troops ready for riot control that day that went on alert that the
[12:39.400 --> 12:44.080]  president hadn't authorized the day before they kill him I mean he just goes
[12:44.080 --> 12:49.120]  on and on the Secret Service pulling security off of him saying you're going
[12:49.120 --> 12:53.160]  to go in the open car pulling the security off I mean he goes on and on
[12:53.160 --> 12:57.560]  they even had a Secret Service agent you can look him up in Chicago who went
[12:57.560 --> 13:01.320]  public the week before and said they're going to kill you in Chicago when you're
[13:01.320 --> 13:05.240]  motorcade and that's why they had to pull out of Chicago they were planning to
[13:05.240 --> 13:12.200]  kill him in Miami as he says in his deathbed confession E Howard Hunt who was
[13:12.200 --> 13:17.760]  the Ethan Hunt of Mission Impossible the writers of that back in the 60s the
[13:17.760 --> 13:21.840]  TV show it was based on E Howard Hunt who's been a sniper in World War two and
[13:21.840 --> 13:25.840]  he said you know kills off the chart and everything else and was the head of
[13:25.840 --> 13:29.960]  black op murder squads I mean overthrowing more than 10 countries and
[13:29.960 --> 13:34.920]  would go in and command forces killing people killing presidents killing
[13:34.920 --> 13:39.320]  prime ministers overthrowing and you know he's he's like yeah cordmire
[13:39.320 --> 13:44.600]  game and I know they went of course it was being come run out of the White
[13:44.600 --> 13:48.840]  House under LBJ and the COINTELPRO attacked and said he's saying LBJ didn't
[13:48.840 --> 13:55.160]  go higher no in the command structure the the quarterback or really the coach
[13:55.160 --> 14:04.360]  he said I was a bench warmer commanding it in that operation knew that his chain
[14:04.360 --> 14:07.760]  of command went to the president of course it goes above that that just shows
[14:07.760 --> 14:11.080]  how strong men attacks are built remember we drop huge bombshells and break
[14:11.080 --> 14:14.840]  them here there's always a tax on it to discredit it and attack it because they
[14:14.840 --> 14:20.360]  don't want the public realizing how powerful these jewels of information are
[14:20.360 --> 14:26.400]  they don't want the people knowing just how huge all of this information really
[14:26.400 --> 14:35.120]  is but I digress they are now saying that yeah we'll kill Americans and secretly
[14:35.120 --> 14:38.920]  arrest Americans anywhere in the world except the US and we'll secretly arrest
[14:38.920 --> 14:43.800]  you here if we want now I later learned in my office was contacted by G20
[14:43.800 --> 14:53.480]  security a few years ago when Rob do was up in Pittsburgh and got arrested we
[14:53.480 --> 14:57.160]  were contacted we checked the number in the phone system called him back they
[14:57.160 --> 15:03.440]  confirmed but wouldn't come on air that when we linked to the video of protesters
[15:03.440 --> 15:08.600]  and troops in uniforms jumping out with no insignia grabbing people you can just
[15:08.600 --> 15:12.000]  type in snatch and grab at G20 same thing happened in Canada same thing in
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.160]  England they grabbed people and shove them in cars and I said on air that guy
[15:17.160 --> 15:24.000]  looks like a role-player turns out G20 security called me from the number and
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.680]  wouldn't say who they were other than the first name and said that was G20
[15:28.680 --> 15:34.040]  security not US military and that was a simulation but that's all we're gonna
[15:34.040 --> 15:38.480]  tell you and now because they wanted it put out it was a simulation but why all
[15:38.480 --> 15:43.200]  over the world now at these G20 events and other events do they have black vans
[15:43.200 --> 15:47.760]  pull up or or crown vicks pull up with people in military outfits to grab you
[15:47.760 --> 15:51.920]  and throw you in a vehicle they're they're priming the pump it's a beta
[15:51.920 --> 16:00.040]  test can we start pulling up and grabbing people it's all an acclamation now we
[16:00.040 --> 16:05.200]  found out who was out there and since I've learned it wasn't just state guard
[16:05.200 --> 16:09.760]  there was also National Guard at the kite festival troops used for crowd
[16:09.760 --> 16:14.720]  control at Texas kite festival this is a giant Zilker Park hundreds of access
[16:14.720 --> 16:17.200]  points there's no way you're gonna stop terrorists from going in there a
[16:17.200 --> 16:20.000]  terrorist just drives up and shoots the troops if they were real terrorists
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.640]  that's not CIA or Mossad or other groups run British intelligence run
[16:24.640 --> 16:31.640]  remember we always forget in Basra you guys get me a water please thanks but
[16:31.640 --> 16:37.680]  have scratchy throat in Basra thank you in Basra they caught British special
[16:37.680 --> 16:46.240]  forces in 2006 dressed up with fake beards posing as Wahhabist driving
[16:46.240 --> 16:52.080]  around shooting Sunni Shiite excuse me police officers and others to get a
[16:52.080 --> 16:59.040]  sectarian war going they were caught by the Iraqi police this this all happened
[16:59.040 --> 17:05.600]  so this is what full spectrum dominance is you have to create the enemy now
[17:05.600 --> 17:10.360]  continuing I know I I harp on this a lot because it's everything we're told
[17:10.360 --> 17:12.840]  give up all our rights all of our liberties change their whole way of
[17:12.840 --> 17:26.640]  life the big news is they're moving the G8 summit from Chicago to Camp David
[17:26.640 --> 17:32.920]  because it is a black site a secret government site I mean the surface level
[17:32.920 --> 17:36.560]  structures are on record but it is a continuity of government COG number one
[17:36.560 --> 17:43.000]  designate auxiliary Congress meeting cabinet meeting facility the real
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.960]  shadow government command base is Colorado Springs slash Denver complex
[17:47.960 --> 17:51.640]  just to give you a factoid there from our deep research but that by the way
[17:51.640 --> 17:59.080]  that's all on record just details are classified that signifies that they do
[17:59.080 --> 18:03.520]  think war is gonna happen with Iran that doesn't mean it's gonna happen come
[18:03.520 --> 18:06.200]  like somebody takes the safety off puts a gun to your head they're intended to
[18:06.200 --> 18:08.800]  pull the trigger are they gonna change their mind the next five seconds
[18:08.800 --> 18:16.480]  politically maybe Netanyahu is given his American Israeli affairs speech and
[18:16.480 --> 18:20.600]  it's basically a declaration of war he says my supreme responsibility as
[18:20.600 --> 18:24.600]  prime minister of Israel is to ensure that Israel remains the master of its
[18:24.600 --> 18:31.040]  fate and then meanwhile all over the country TSA is showing up at bus
[18:31.040 --> 18:34.920]  stations highways train stations and groping and grabbing and in teaching
[18:34.920 --> 18:38.320]  everybody that there's total federalization unbonded unsworn not
[18:38.320 --> 18:41.880]  even peace officers they're not even federal out of their jurisdiction it's
[18:41.880 --> 18:46.160]  just total lawlessness just like Obama launching war without Congress
[18:46.160 --> 18:50.600]  Colonel Schaefer had to admit he said it is treason it is illegal just just on
[18:50.600 --> 18:55.680]  its face 100% it's like is it legal to grab a kid out of their front yard time
[18:55.680 --> 19:01.280]  down the road and run over him yes it's illegal is it illegal to walk up to
[19:01.280 --> 19:03.600]  somebody you don't know and shoot him in the head with a shotgun yes it's
[19:03.600 --> 19:10.160]  illegal I mean it's there's no debating that it's illegal launching wars against
[19:10.160 --> 19:13.920]  Libya launching proxy wars against Syria all of this without congressional
[19:13.920 --> 19:20.720]  approval totally illegal TSA and Homeland Security are now going to be on
[19:20.720 --> 19:26.400]  campuses nationwide advising students and professors about threats oh we're
[19:26.400 --> 19:30.520]  just here we're just spies we're we're just here to get everybody paranoid and
[19:30.520 --> 19:34.640]  create a spying grid it's all the Stasi system and TV screens going in
[19:34.640 --> 19:39.520]  Walmart saying watch your neighbor blimps flying around 30,000 drones
[19:39.520 --> 19:42.920]  I remember seven years ago when they first saw the robotic dragon flies I
[19:42.920 --> 19:45.800]  thought I was crazy with people reporting it and then later that six months
[19:45.800 --> 19:50.560]  later oh yeah those are Homeland Security robot dragon flies I mean we're
[19:50.560 --> 19:56.000]  not in Kansas anymore here it is big sis and DHS move on to campus it is a not a

[24:23.600 --> 24:29.520]  the National Defense Authorization Act empowers the US military to operate on
[24:29.520 --> 24:33.680]  American soil they can arrest American citizens and cart them off to
[24:33.680 --> 24:38.320]  detention centers anywhere in the world basically turning the entire homeland
[24:38.320 --> 24:42.560]  into a battlefield and allowing the military to arrest individuals and
[24:42.560 --> 24:47.760]  detain them indefinitely without trial now this violates every aspect of a free
[24:47.760 --> 24:52.360]  society by denying Americans their constitutionally protected right to do
[24:52.360 --> 24:57.480]  process how do you think the average American is going to respond the same
[24:57.480 --> 25:02.160]  way they responded at the Kent State Massacre when National Guard troops were
[25:02.160 --> 25:06.520]  used to fire live ammunition on students who were non-violently protesting the
[25:06.520 --> 25:09.840]  Vietnam War the American public was outraged the
[25:09.840 --> 25:14.320]  military is here to defend us not to prosecute us and arrest us and throw us
[25:14.320 --> 25:19.200]  in jail I think it's a sneak attack by Congress and people to you know counter
[25:19.200 --> 25:22.840]  the movement on Wall Street these people are saying that the passing of the bill
[25:22.840 --> 25:27.680]  basically it means to them that the Rubicon has been crossed that this means
[25:27.680 --> 25:32.560]  America will become complete and possibly irreversible totalitarian
[25:32.560 --> 25:37.000]  military state well then our only hope is some defective armed force members
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.520]  think that's our only chance as the military needs to enforce our
[25:40.520 --> 25:45.440]  Constitution and our congressmen are trampling over the rules that were
[25:45.440 --> 25:51.400]  established over 200 years ago and that's the whole problem there's too much
[25:51.400 --> 25:55.800]  corruption in the executive branch and in the congressional what would you say
[25:55.800 --> 26:02.240]  to active military who are who might be told to enforce this bill listen I'm a
[26:02.240 --> 26:08.880]  veteran United States Army 31 uniform airborne I'll tell you what very simply
[26:08.880 --> 26:13.680]  we take an oath to protect this country from threats both foreign and domestic
[26:13.680 --> 26:18.240]  it's not good it's not healthy for our democracy for the American Army to be
[26:18.240 --> 26:22.000]  involved for those people who say that oh it could never happen here could never
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.760]  happen to us those are called the famous last words many times without
[26:25.760 --> 26:29.880]  history situations have happened where governments have turned their military
[26:29.880 --> 26:34.000]  against its citizens you know what history repeats itself if that
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.200]  eventuality does happen we have to you have to remind yourself these are your
[26:38.200 --> 26:44.040]  brothers and sisters and neighbors and and people you went to school with and
[26:44.040 --> 26:48.120]  remember what you're truly fighting for is for our Constitution not for these
[26:48.120 --> 26:52.920]  puppets who are actually our servants who have run amok now Stuart Rhodes the
[26:52.920 --> 26:57.120]  founder of oathkeepers recently appeared on the Info Wars nightly news and he
[26:57.120 --> 27:01.000]  warned people that we are now at the point where all that will save liberty
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.400]  in America is another American revolution but really you should see this
[27:05.400 --> 27:09.320]  as a declaration of war against the American people that's how we should see
[27:09.320 --> 27:13.840]  it we need to stop this right now if we don't Alex I do believe that there'll be
[27:13.840 --> 27:18.000]  no recourse except another revolution otherwise we are going to be lost we
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.720]  will be put in the same position as the founding fathers were in 1775 I want to
[27:22.720 --> 27:26.360]  tell the military and police the globalists are gonna set off shore and
[27:26.360 --> 27:31.120]  watch you get chewed up in a fight with the American people it's very important
[27:31.120 --> 27:36.000]  that police and military really make a decision now which sides are going to be
[27:36.000 --> 27:42.720]  on the military you're right choose now who you shall serve either you are I'm
[27:42.720 --> 27:46.080]  talking the military out there especially either you are a son of the
[27:46.080 --> 27:51.040]  republic and you will defend the bill of rights and the Constitution or you are
[27:51.040 --> 27:55.080]  a traitor to your country and you are nothing but a but a lowly dog an
[27:55.080 --> 28:01.240]  obedient dog to the powers that be choose now who you shall serve there's a
[28:01.240 --> 28:05.120]  lot of constitutionalists out there who are in such an uproar that they're
[28:05.120 --> 28:09.600]  saying that this bill places us in almost exactly the same position that our
[28:09.600 --> 28:13.400]  forefathers were in when they were forced to take up arms in defense of
[28:13.400 --> 28:19.640]  liberty and back in 1775 oh well to those people I would say it's a
[28:19.640 --> 28:23.880]  culmination of things that have put us out in that position and I would agree
[28:23.880 --> 28:30.120]  that the architects the great and highly intelligent architects that
[28:30.120 --> 28:36.000]  constructed our infrastructure of the way we do business and the way we do
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.880]  politics and the way we we live here in America they would turn over in their
[28:41.880 --> 28:45.960]  graves and they would be they would be very ashamed of us and how far we let
[28:45.960 --> 28:51.080]  this go indefinite detention without due process leave citizens without the
[28:51.080 --> 28:55.160]  legal protection of the Constitution and it strikes at the very heart of the
[28:55.160 --> 29:00.440]  essence of us law it is positively shameful that any elected representative
[29:00.440 --> 29:05.720]  would even consider voting for such an assault on so sacred a fundamental value
[29:05.720 --> 29:12.520]  as the right to due process I'm Darren McBreen for info wars nightly news

[31:13.920 --> 31:17.920]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost

[36:29.280 --> 36:35.080]  image is so clear, the threat so obvious that I just throw a fit.
[36:35.080 --> 36:43.080]  It's really a form of laziness, but I am too close to this sometimes, but we all are,
[36:43.080 --> 36:46.080]  and we live in the present.
[36:46.080 --> 36:50.080]  The past is forever the past, the future is hurtling towards us.
[36:50.080 --> 36:55.640]  You've got to fight tyranny while the sun still shines because the sun is setting.
[36:55.640 --> 37:01.480]  A great time of darkness is upon us, but it has to get dark for people to recognize what
[37:01.480 --> 37:02.480]  good is.
[37:02.480 --> 37:08.240]  Again, we have to go into bondage, just like Israel did over and over again every time
[37:08.240 --> 37:15.320]  it turned its back on God to discover the blessings.
[37:15.320 --> 37:20.160]  And if the people will repent and change their evil ways, if we don't believe in God, this
[37:20.160 --> 37:28.560]  is corruption, this is decadence, this is silliness, this is laziness, this is madness.
[37:28.560 --> 37:36.400]  What the elites are doing with fish and fusion reactors, Hadron colliders, nuclear weapons,
[37:36.400 --> 37:41.040]  neutron bombs, anti-matter weapons they admit they've developed, but details remain classified,
[37:41.040 --> 37:45.800]  San Francisco Chronicle AP.
[37:45.800 --> 37:52.400]  We cover that in New World Order, Blueprint of Mad Men, by the way that's free on the
[37:52.400 --> 37:57.680]  web now, PrisonPlanet.tv viewers got it first last week, but it's free on the web, hope
[37:57.680 --> 38:01.160]  you appreciate it, I don't think it's pearls before swine.
[38:01.160 --> 38:06.560]  Some folks are like, man don't release this right now, only have it on PrisonPlanet.tv
[38:06.560 --> 38:09.480]  and we'll get a lot more members than you could actually pay to hire more people and
[38:09.480 --> 38:14.160]  do a bigger, better job and I'm like, I understand that school of thought, we try to have both
[38:14.160 --> 38:18.200]  worlds where the members get it first, get it in higher quality and we have our own system
[38:18.200 --> 38:24.520]  so we can't be censored, but I would rather reach hundreds of millions of people online
[38:24.520 --> 38:30.560]  with the films than just be a pure subscription system and reach a few hundred thousand.
[38:30.560 --> 38:36.600]  And it wouldn't even be a few hundred thousand if I didn't let people share their passcode
[38:36.600 --> 38:40.760]  with six people to do it, but it's a side issue if you want to be a PrisonPlanet.tv
[38:40.760 --> 38:45.200]  member and support us, it's fifteen cents a day, we have a fifteen day free trial running
[38:45.200 --> 38:48.240]  just perpetually so you can go check it out and take advantage of it, all the films are
[38:48.240 --> 38:55.440]  there, my book, Paul Watson's book, nine years of material in April will be nine years, everything.
[38:55.440 --> 39:00.120]  Expanded extras, expanded stuff, it's not on the DVDs, every TV show going back five
[39:00.120 --> 39:05.320]  years now, old TV shows, I did thirteen, fourteen years ago, I've got a program soon, we've
[39:05.320 --> 39:09.560]  got to go through all the tapes, a new program I want to launch, once a week is clips from
[39:09.560 --> 39:16.840]  old shows from fifteen, sixteen, seventeen years ago, but there is PrisonPlanet.tv,
[39:16.840 --> 39:21.040]  we do have David Ike steaming towards us, he'll be with us in T-minus forty minutes,
[39:21.040 --> 39:27.320]  forty seconds, and then of course Bruce Fine, chief advisor for the campaign on policy,
[39:27.320 --> 39:34.320]  chief policy advisor, Bruce Fine, constitutional lawyer about the cartoon level tyranny.
[39:34.320 --> 39:40.840]  Now again, they're announcing all these unconstitutional powers and trying to implement them, but fully
[39:40.840 --> 39:45.880]  implementing them is another story altogether, but I've got to tell you, they are actually
[39:45.880 --> 39:51.280]  getting a lot of it done, and it's horrifying.
[39:51.280 --> 39:57.280]  I wish I would have done more when I first woke up, I wish I knew then when I know now.
[39:57.280 --> 40:04.600]  I wish people understood how much danger they're in, and that cowering to this ensures, it'd
[40:04.600 --> 40:08.640]  be like if you were in the Carpathian Mountains three hundred years ago, and a pack of fifteen
[40:08.640 --> 40:12.720]  wolves was following you, I'll assure you that if you just grovel in fear and let it
[40:12.720 --> 40:16.920]  paralyze you and collapse, you know, down in the bushes, they're going to come and eat
[40:16.920 --> 40:17.920]  you.
[40:17.920 --> 40:24.400]  But if you try to climb a tree, try to get to high ground, try to make a fire, try to
[40:24.400 --> 40:32.880]  find a cabin, try to find other people, you're going to, you're going to make it, or at least
[40:32.880 --> 40:40.800]  not trying, but if you, I've seen this a lot, and I know you've seen it in crime videos,
[40:40.800 --> 40:45.400]  they released out of shopping mall parking lots or security camera inside stores or
[40:45.400 --> 40:51.520]  people's houses, where men and women will collapse in fear of just a person in their
[40:51.520 --> 40:57.320]  house, who hadn't even pulled a weapon out yet, and will do what they say.
[40:57.320 --> 41:01.880]  And I don't think of myself as somebody special, but I actually have been mugged repeatedly
[41:01.880 --> 41:06.560]  in Dallas, and I tell you, they ended up getting hurt real bad, and call that reckless, but
[41:06.560 --> 41:13.760]  I couldn't do anything, but automatically feigned that I was listening to them and then
[41:13.760 --> 41:20.680]  assaulting them with ferocious, high-powered, destructive, bone-crushing delivery.
[41:20.680 --> 41:26.960]  Because that's what I'm designed to do, you've got to have that in you as well.
[41:26.960 --> 41:33.240]  Believe me, I've gotten my butt stomped plenty of times, I'm not the toughest guy around
[41:33.240 --> 41:39.080]  far from it, there are people out there so fast, so mean, that it'll make your head
[41:39.080 --> 41:42.080]  spin.
[41:42.080 --> 41:44.480]  Who are these people here today?
[41:44.480 --> 41:45.480]  What are we turning into?
[41:45.480 --> 41:52.000]  I've told the story 50 times, I won't tell it again, just in brevity, but I come out
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.040]  of the bathroom, a woman's choking, she's turning blue, this has been going on for two
[41:56.040 --> 41:59.760]  minutes, everyone's saying like, parrots, call 911, call 911, they've all got their
[41:59.760 --> 42:03.960]  cell phones out, this was like 10 years ago.
[42:03.960 --> 42:09.880]  And I started saying, do the Heimlich maneuver.
[42:09.880 --> 42:15.400]  They're like, no, no, police, ambulance, no, no, it's always been like, no, no, no,
[42:15.400 --> 42:20.360]  there's these metrosexual men and these women like parrots going 911, 911, I mean, that's
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.240]  the essence of everything, just chirping 911 over and over again, so I said, no, I'm going
[42:24.240 --> 42:28.560]  to do the Heimlich and by then she's like starting to get on the table.
[42:28.560 --> 42:31.640]  So I get over there like, you're going to get in trouble, be careful, are you licensed
[42:31.640 --> 42:32.640]  for this?
[42:32.640 --> 42:35.880]  And I, you know, do the Heimlich a few times, she was a little bit overweight, I actually
[42:35.880 --> 42:41.800]  had to pick her up almost, boom, cost the, cost the bread out.
[42:41.800 --> 42:45.960]  But the point is, is that out of a restaurant, I mean, there, there had to be 25, 30 people
[42:45.960 --> 42:48.480]  in that wing of the LeMatelein restaurant.
[42:48.480 --> 42:54.320]  And I don't tell that story over again, because I'm a hero doing a Heimlich, it was nothing.
[42:54.320 --> 42:59.440]  I mean, if I'm choking, almost somebody helped me, I guess I know how to do it on a chair,
[42:59.440 --> 43:05.240]  I guess if you're by yourself, I know how to do it on babies, because I've got children.
[43:05.240 --> 43:09.680]  And I took, when I was swimming at the YMCA, back when I was a kid, I, I took the basic
[43:09.680 --> 43:14.080]  fire department one, and when I had children, the first thing I did was go, you know, refresh
[43:14.080 --> 43:17.600]  myself on the internet with the, how to do it, even thought about going out of the fire
[43:17.600 --> 43:21.480]  department and taking one of the courses to refresh, I should have, I didn't.
[43:21.480 --> 43:25.760]  Because I wanted to know how to resuscitate my children if they were in the water.
[43:25.760 --> 43:31.680]  I wanted to know how to do the, the Heimlich on a baby.
[43:31.680 --> 43:34.920]  And there's different ways, but you just put them on their stomach in your hand and then
[43:34.920 --> 43:37.320]  you know, kind of bump them that way.
[43:37.320 --> 43:40.760]  There's different ways to do it, the point is, is that that's weird.
[43:40.760 --> 43:45.520]  I've learned that, that I would want to know how to give mouth to mouth resuscitation.
[43:45.520 --> 43:49.400]  I mean, I don't know how to jump start a car, I don't know how to jump start a person.
[43:49.400 --> 43:50.600]  That's like weird nowadays.
[43:50.600 --> 43:54.680]  That's like, whoa, whoa, you know, you call 911 for that.
[43:54.680 --> 43:57.400]  Well, sorry, 911 on average takes about 11 minutes.
[43:57.400 --> 44:01.920]  Sometimes the cops do a great job and show up in 30 seconds.
[44:01.920 --> 44:03.600]  But I want to know how to do the Heimlich.
[44:03.600 --> 44:08.400]  I want to know how to do mouth to mouth resuscitation.
[44:08.400 --> 44:12.640]  I want to know how to jump start somebody's heart, hit them in the chest if I need to,
[44:12.640 --> 44:15.040]  have mouth to mouth and work.
[44:15.040 --> 44:17.120]  And my country is dying in front of me too.
[44:17.120 --> 44:20.600]  And I'm like, I don't have the power to resuscitate this Republic.
[44:20.600 --> 44:22.280]  I've, you've got to get away.
[44:22.280 --> 44:23.280]  You've got to get upset.
[44:23.280 --> 44:25.640]  You've got to realize how much danger you're in.
[44:25.640 --> 44:29.440]  It's on record, the government shipped guns into Mexico to blame the second amendment
[44:29.440 --> 44:31.600]  and killed thousands.
[44:31.600 --> 44:36.800]  It's on this side that they got corrected yesterday in some comments.
[44:36.800 --> 44:40.520]  So I've been saying three border patrol, three police officers for like two years.
[44:40.520 --> 44:45.160]  It's like 10 now, conservatively dead from those guns traced directly just on our side
[44:45.160 --> 44:46.160]  of the border.
[44:46.160 --> 44:51.040]  Over 200 US citizens estimated thousands, the Mexican government estimates 2000.
[44:51.040 --> 44:55.920]  I think that's conservative of the 40 plus thousand traced directly to guns shipped in
[44:55.920 --> 44:56.920]  by the ATF.
[44:56.920 --> 44:58.320]  They didn't just let them leave the store.
[44:58.320 --> 44:59.320]  That was the cover.
[44:59.320 --> 45:03.320]  They put out in the news the limited part when it came out in federal filings.
[45:03.320 --> 45:06.200]  So they said, we'll just give them the smallest part and make it all about that.
[45:06.200 --> 45:08.560]  It's a basic psychological warfare.
[45:08.560 --> 45:13.000]  I had Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer on yesterday who ran the bin Laden program
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.160]  trying to kill him who was blocked twice from killing him.
[45:15.160 --> 45:16.880]  And he said, I agree with you.
[45:16.880 --> 45:20.480]  They're letting terrorists attack us and funding terrorists so they can take our liberties.
[45:20.480 --> 45:26.360]  This is a guy who has had the highest security clearances you can get.
[45:26.360 --> 45:31.920]  We're at a prestigious government think tanks corresponding on all the big networks and
[45:31.920 --> 45:34.960]  a point blank says, no, you're right.
[45:34.960 --> 45:38.880]  The elites are funding it so they can take our liberties and amour all the Locky without
[45:38.880 --> 45:43.080]  me prompting him is a FBI asset.
[45:43.080 --> 45:44.800]  And that's why they had the stage killing of him.
[45:44.800 --> 45:46.200]  They didn't kill him.
[45:46.200 --> 45:47.200]  He's been sheep dipped.
[45:47.200 --> 45:48.200]  Just like that.
[45:48.200 --> 45:49.200]  He was special forces.
[45:49.200 --> 45:50.200]  Oh, they died the helicopter crash.
[45:50.200 --> 45:51.200]  Yeah, right.
[45:51.200 --> 45:52.200]  Changed their identity, everything.
[45:52.200 --> 45:53.200]  That's declassified.
[45:53.200 --> 45:59.720]  40s in fact, I'm just going to keep my mouth shut at that point.
[45:59.720 --> 46:09.000]  But the issue here is that it's a fact that four of the five leaders of Al Qaeda work for
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.840]  the U.S. government on record and were born here in the United States.
[46:13.840 --> 46:17.320]  And you're like, well, so there isn't Muslim extremists.
[46:17.320 --> 46:18.320]  Of course there is.
[46:18.320 --> 46:20.400]  Who do you think commands them?
[46:20.400 --> 46:24.080]  They'll find people that really do want to blow stuff up and hurt people, but they're
[46:24.080 --> 46:34.480]  almost always led by British, Israeli, U.S. or Saudi forces who all stand to gain.
[46:34.480 --> 46:45.400]  You got to love it, 15 of the 19 hijackers are from Saudi Arabia, but we attack Iraq.
[46:45.400 --> 46:51.080]  And now they're announcing TSA all over the country and it's in the news now.
[46:51.080 --> 46:52.920]  People are like, wow, how'd you know this?
[46:52.920 --> 46:53.920]  It's in Forbes.
[46:53.920 --> 46:55.840]  It's in Dallas Morning News.
[46:55.840 --> 46:56.840]  They're just everywhere.
[46:56.840 --> 46:57.840]  I'm getting calls every day now.
[46:57.840 --> 47:00.480]  Oh my gosh, I'm in this town of only 20,000.
[47:00.480 --> 47:03.600]  And there was TSA out there on the street corner directing the police.
[47:03.600 --> 47:07.600]  Oh my gosh, I went to a middle school basketball game, Alex.
[47:07.600 --> 47:08.800]  We're talking 200 people.
[47:08.800 --> 47:09.800]  People send me the videos.
[47:09.800 --> 47:12.720]  They're all over YouTube every day now, not every week, now it's every day.
[47:12.720 --> 47:16.920]  And they come and there's like regular army with sidearms at the basketball game in New
[47:16.920 --> 47:20.560]  Mexico or Connecticut.
[47:20.560 --> 47:25.040]  And then I see the photos on the Marine Corps site at the local base or the army site.
[47:25.040 --> 47:26.560]  It's always different.
[47:26.560 --> 47:30.200]  And it shows always like a three-year-old opening their Hello Kitty bag and the troops
[47:30.200 --> 47:33.760]  are searching it like it's cute and fun.
[47:33.760 --> 47:39.960]  And they had the Texas Guard and National Guard, the only press release we could find,
[47:39.960 --> 47:43.800]  we talked to some others, it was National Guard there as well, directing people and reportedly
[47:43.800 --> 47:46.840]  checking things and putting kids on school buses and they're like, oh, you're just being
[47:46.840 --> 47:47.840]  paranoid.
[47:47.840 --> 47:48.840]  They won't take you to FEMA camp.
[47:48.840 --> 47:49.840]  It's a drill for that.
[47:49.840 --> 47:53.320]  What's to acclimate the troops and everybody that, yeah, we drive buses, we put kids on
[47:53.320 --> 47:54.320]  them.
[47:54.320 --> 47:55.320]  You know, we take kids in.
[47:55.320 --> 47:57.040]  They're part of a community program helping the poor kids.
[47:57.040 --> 48:03.280]  All sounds reasonable until you read Army Times, until you read all these mainline publications
[48:03.280 --> 48:06.840]  where they said, we're just getting to know the public, stars and stripes and were like
[48:06.840 --> 48:07.840]  four years ago.
[48:07.840 --> 48:12.480]  We're just letting everybody know we're here to help them with our assets.
[48:12.480 --> 48:17.200]  And so Jaws of Life cuts somebody out in South Dakota.
[48:17.200 --> 48:19.600]  Helicopter flies 100 miles with the Jaws of Life.
[48:19.600 --> 48:21.480]  Army Helicopter lands, cuts you out.
[48:21.480 --> 48:25.840]  It's on the news, Army Helping, winning the hearts that were being acclimated for occupation
[48:25.840 --> 48:31.120]  and it says in the articles, they're acclimating us in a friendly way.
[48:31.120 --> 48:38.360]  And then, you know, in the same article in Army Times, but it was Brigade Homeland starts
[48:38.360 --> 48:45.320]  term and the date, they actually pulled it out of there like a week later if we made
[48:45.320 --> 48:46.320]  a big deal of it.
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.080]  But it had the colonel in there going, yeah, we're here to help Jaws of Life, Carrex, Drunk,
[48:50.080 --> 48:52.840]  Driving Checkpoints and sadly it's got to be done.
[48:52.840 --> 48:56.240]  We're preparing to pull triggers on the American people.
[48:56.240 --> 48:57.240]  Pull triggers.
[48:57.240 --> 49:00.800]  It got saved on the web before they removed that part.
[49:00.800 --> 49:06.680]  But then I was given in 98 because the FBI pulled up Mike Hansen, it's in takeover.
[49:06.680 --> 49:11.040]  He was driving up to Waco to do a roofing job.
[49:11.040 --> 49:16.040]  He had a construction company on the side, along with doing camera work for me, volunteering
[49:16.040 --> 49:18.560]  like once a week or so and he also worked part-time.
[49:18.560 --> 49:25.920]  The point is, Mike calls me, I was in my daytime show, I was in daytime and nighttime
[49:25.920 --> 49:30.200]  and then he says, yeah, there's Army out here searching rayon buses.
[49:30.200 --> 49:34.160]  And then the FBI pulls up and comes over and says, get out of here.
[49:34.160 --> 49:35.160]  Here's the press release.
[49:35.160 --> 49:36.160]  Stop trying to videotape this.
[49:36.160 --> 49:37.440]  It's national security.
[49:37.440 --> 49:42.040]  And it turned out they gave us a secret document by the grace of God.
[49:42.040 --> 49:45.600]  The FBI guys like, get out of here, of course, Mike didn't go.
[49:45.600 --> 49:46.600]  There's footage.
[49:46.600 --> 49:49.360]  You know, first the police come up and say, get out of here.
[49:49.360 --> 49:50.360]  Was it Sergeant Smart?
[49:50.360 --> 49:51.360]  I thought that was funny.
[49:51.360 --> 49:52.360]  Like out of a movie.
[49:52.360 --> 49:55.000]  The name of the police officer was a Captain Smart.
[49:55.000 --> 50:00.920]  The point is, and they try to park in dump trucks in front of them so we couldn't see
[50:00.920 --> 50:01.920]  it or not.
[50:01.920 --> 50:04.120]  It was a drill.
[50:04.120 --> 50:07.480]  And then a year later, the tears there were an urban war for a drill and the troops come
[50:07.480 --> 50:08.480]  up.
[50:08.480 --> 50:09.480]  They've got Marines, Army, you name it.
[50:09.480 --> 50:11.160]  And they come over and they go, turn your cameras off.
[50:11.160 --> 50:12.160]  This is in Belton, Texas.
[50:12.160 --> 50:13.160]  You're not supposed to videotape.
[50:13.160 --> 50:14.160]  And I said, I'll videotape.
[50:14.160 --> 50:18.920]  And he goes, you, it's you, because you've seen the film, I guess, you're not supposed
[50:18.920 --> 50:19.920]  to videotape me.
[50:19.920 --> 50:21.240]  I'm EOD and all this stuff.
[50:21.240 --> 50:26.520]  Anyways, the document that gave us on the side of the highway said classified, restricted.
[50:26.520 --> 50:29.480]  We're here, you know, with your police departments everywhere.
[50:29.480 --> 50:34.040]  We're here to counter respond, you know, 365 days a year, you know, seven days a week.
[50:34.040 --> 50:39.640]  Any time we're here for whatever you need, warrant service, bomb disposal, folks, they've
[50:39.640 --> 50:43.280]  got troops raiding houses everywhere.
[50:43.280 --> 50:46.880]  And the chief of police was in here a few months ago and he's like, the world would
[50:46.880 --> 50:49.960]  literally have to be ending to have troops in Austin, Alex.
[50:49.960 --> 50:50.960]  Really?
[50:50.960 --> 50:51.960]  Are they Savannah?
[50:51.960 --> 50:52.960]  Okay, then.
[50:52.960 --> 50:59.440]  Why are there National Guard and state troops, state guard out there at the Kite Festival
[50:59.440 --> 51:00.440]  Pal?
[51:00.440 --> 51:06.040]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[51:06.040 --> 51:08.040]  good sized meal that I was still starving.
[51:08.040 --> 51:13.080]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[51:13.080 --> 51:17.200]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[51:17.200 --> 51:22.720]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[51:22.720 --> 51:25.880]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[51:25.880 --> 51:32.120]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[51:32.120 --> 51:36.240]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.
[51:36.240 --> 51:40.040]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[54:06.280 --> 54:10.640]  Folks, wait till you see this Dave Mustaine interview.
[54:10.640 --> 54:13.640]  I was going to release it like Friday on the nightly news, but I'm going to take our time
[54:13.640 --> 54:14.880]  and release it next week.
[54:14.880 --> 54:18.440]  Because he said he talked about a lot of stuff in this interview, he's never said.
[54:18.440 --> 54:24.560]  And it was his idea, you know, so it's going to be powerful.
[54:24.560 --> 54:30.080]  Okay, continuing here, let me just read you the headlines that are here in front of me
[54:30.080 --> 54:31.280]  in this short segment.
[54:31.280 --> 54:36.400]  Troops used for crowd control at Texas Kite Festival, footage shows guard troops loading
[54:36.400 --> 54:40.200]  children on the school buses and there's a whole admitted program to take kids during
[54:40.200 --> 54:43.640]  emergencies using the Army and we've got links to all the mainstream articles about
[54:43.640 --> 54:44.640]  that.
[54:44.640 --> 54:46.640]  Just all to acclimate everybody including the military.
[54:46.640 --> 54:51.200]  And we get the internal documents, it's about war against us, but all the troops have been
[54:51.200 --> 54:53.520]  here before.
[54:53.520 --> 55:00.520]  Big sis and DHS move on to campuses, surveillance operation on campuses, homeland security,
[55:00.520 --> 55:07.280]  recruiting students to spy on each other, go read that in FullWars.com, some say reelection
[55:07.280 --> 55:13.320]  fears of driving gun sales in Fort Worth and elsewhere, here's a NBC report nationwide
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.440]  even topping the record sales of last year.
[55:16.440 --> 55:20.560]  And people say we know the government's criminal, we don't trust it.
[55:20.560 --> 55:25.520]  So hey, good luck military, if you follow these orders, just know this, when they blow
[55:25.520 --> 55:29.760]  up your bases or whatever and say that Ron Paul supporters did it, you better believe
[55:29.760 --> 55:32.880]  that the criminal banks that run the country did it, they're trying to get us to have a
[55:32.880 --> 55:34.280]  civil war.
[55:34.280 --> 55:39.040]  So get your cameras rolling quick when the feds attack the military or federal bases.
[55:39.040 --> 55:42.240]  It's not going to be the American people.
[55:42.240 --> 55:47.320]  You're an American too and you're about to lose your whole future.
[55:47.320 --> 55:50.560]  We've got them checkmated though, even if they go ahead with all this, we have damaged
[55:50.560 --> 55:54.640]  them so bad exposing their whole program that people already think we're psychic because
[55:54.640 --> 55:56.720]  everything we've talked about is coming true.
[55:56.720 --> 56:00.960]  Even if they go to the next phase and everything comes true, like we said, I mean, don't you
[56:00.960 --> 56:01.960]  get it?
[56:01.960 --> 56:05.720]  We loaded time bombs into this thing that aren't explosive, they're info weapon, they're
[56:05.720 --> 56:09.840]  not physical, we're devastating you and you know it.
[56:09.840 --> 56:15.720]  And the more you do what we said you're going to do, the more you are going to be exposed.
[56:15.720 --> 56:17.160]  But they're committed.
[56:17.160 --> 56:21.640]  And so the dais cash, the collision course, Netanyahu to Obama, Israel serves the right
[56:21.640 --> 56:22.640]  to strike.
[56:22.640 --> 56:26.600]  There's on the stage of supreme responsibilities, prime minister to Israel to ensure that Israel
[56:26.600 --> 56:28.440]  remains the master of its fate.
[56:28.440 --> 56:31.360]  I always call him the president, he's the prime minister.
[56:31.360 --> 56:38.200]  And BB's declaration of war in Iran is another good article breaking it all down.
[56:38.200 --> 56:42.280]  Very serious information on that front and again, what really signifies they're going
[56:42.280 --> 56:48.200]  towards war here is that they're moving the G8 from Chicago to Camp David, which is a
[56:48.200 --> 56:49.400]  continuity government site.
[56:49.400 --> 56:53.800]  They do not want this out in the open and that shows me they like to launch wars while
[56:53.800 --> 56:55.760]  these conferences are going on.
[56:55.760 --> 56:57.440]  And so that could be it.
[56:57.440 --> 57:03.040]  The White House abruptly announced yesterday that it had scuttled plans to hold the upcoming
[57:03.040 --> 57:07.880]  G8 economic summit in Chicago and would instead host the world leaders of the presidential
[57:07.880 --> 57:09.960]  retreat in Camp David in Maryland.
[57:09.960 --> 57:13.800]  It was an unusually late location change for a large and highly scripted international
[57:13.800 --> 57:17.280]  summit and came a little explanation from the White House, Chicago Mayor Roman Manuel,
[57:17.280 --> 57:20.280]  the former White House chief of staff, who personally lobbied President Obama to have
[57:20.280 --> 57:24.840]  the summit in Chicago was in formally hours before the announcement.
[57:24.840 --> 57:33.520]  It's May 18th and 19th, man, I'm telling you, this is hardcore and later I'm going to go
[57:33.520 --> 57:36.800]  over this with the David Ike when he joins his 15 potentially massive threats, the U.S.
[57:36.800 --> 57:41.840]  economy over the next 12 months, the big ones, the Iran situation, the collapse of Spain,
[57:41.840 --> 57:45.280]  the disorderly Greek default state and local governments are imploding.
[57:45.280 --> 57:47.200]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[57:47.200 --> 57:51.800]  Another big article at ABC News, green firms get fed cash, give execs bonuses, fail.
[57:51.800 --> 57:57.840]  Yeah, all by design, just pure criminal looting, Eurozone economy shrinks to fourth quarter
[57:57.840 --> 57:59.160]  as recession fears mount.
[57:59.160 --> 58:03.320]  It's a depression by design.
[58:03.320 --> 58:08.760]  That's just some of what we're going to be going over coming up.
[58:08.760 --> 58:16.600]  Also FBI is looking at probes of news core all over the world, not just here, telling
[58:16.600 --> 58:23.680]  you, the FBI run by arch criminals, Obama engaged in treason with high level army officers
[58:23.680 --> 58:26.920]  on saying, I'm sorry, it is treason and it is illegal.
[58:26.920 --> 58:28.880]  They're guaranteed risking his name, life, everything.
[58:28.880 --> 58:30.560]  I mean, that's what it is.
[58:30.560 --> 58:32.520]  You're seeing absolute lawlessness.
[58:32.520 --> 58:37.480]  And now they're talking about arresting Rupert Murdoch to shut down the media.
[58:37.480 --> 58:39.840]  And I mean, oh, it's it's bad news.
[58:39.840 --> 58:51.760]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.760 --> 58:55.920]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[58:55.920 --> 58:58.960]  with your self produced colloidal silver solutions.
[58:58.960 --> 59:02.480]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been
[59:02.480 --> 59:07.160]  designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[59:07.160 --> 59:11.920]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator.
[59:11.920 --> 59:16.520]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[59:16.520 --> 59:21.160]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[59:21.160 --> 59:24.680]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[59:24.680 --> 59:31.440]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive
[59:31.440 --> 59:32.440]  system.
[59:32.440 --> 59:39.920]  Be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com
[59:39.920 --> 59:42.960]  to learn more about how the silver lung system works.
[59:42.960 --> 1:00:12.800]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:38.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:38.280 --> 1:00:44.000]  All right, for the next hour we are joined by the one, the only David Icke, a champion
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:50.960]  goalie, sports and news reporter, formerly the head of the Green Party in the UK, who
[1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:56.680]  had a massive awakening experience 20 years ago now or more.
[1:00:56.680 --> 1:01:00.440]  And a lot of what he's talked about unfortunately has come true.
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:04.560]  You know, David was asking us in an email, well, what are some of the points Alex wants
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:07.600]  to raise and you know, I never even really do that with David Icke because he's always
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:11.320]  got the points he thinks are most important and I always tend to agree with him.
[1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:16.120]  I want to get into just the hurtling crisis, the openness of world government now, with
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:20.840]  the banksters running it, the NDAA, the open announcement of secret police wars without
[1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:27.040]  approval, just total lawlessness out in the open and there is what he predicted and others
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:30.840]  did as well, a giant accelerating awakening happening.
[1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:34.040]  So we are living in an incredible time to say the least.
[1:01:34.040 --> 1:01:38.120]  We are at the crossroads of human destiny.
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:41.080]  DavidIcke.com is his website.
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:42.320]  Also I'll be plugging this throughout.
[1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:48.320]  He is coming to the United States, speaking at two events in Hawaii this month in Honolulu,
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:51.720]  all day on March 24th and Maui all day on March 31st.
[1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:57.120]  He has a new book out called Remember Who You Are and he joins us now.
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:00.280]  We're going to break in about three minutes, David, but give us a prelude.
[1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:04.040]  What are some of the biggest things on your radar screen right now?
[1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:10.160]  Well, first of all, it would be nice to, well, I'm in Hawaii if I can find Obama's birth
[1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:11.160]  certificate.
[1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:16.200]  I shall be looking as best I can, but I'm not confident.
[1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:22.600]  Funny enough, I think one of the most relevant things that gets missed a lot of the time
[1:02:22.600 --> 1:02:28.920]  is that you currently have the President of the United States visiting you.
[1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:31.040]  He's just arrived in America, he's there now.
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:39.800]  He's called Benjamin Netanyahu and this whole area of how what I call Rothschild Zionists,
[1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:46.160]  which is not Jewish people over in total, it's this, what I would strongly suggest,
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:53.000]  Alex, is a secret society at its core created and controlled to this day by the Rothschilds
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:03:00.840]  that has taken over American government through organizations, not least APAC, and by putting
[1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:06.840]  their people in the key positions to control finance, to control the State Department,
[1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:12.280]  to control all these areas that are pushing and pushing and pushing for this agenda that
[1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:13.720]  you've just been talking about.
[1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:18.760]  I mean, someone like Joseph Lieberman, for instance, Rothschild Zionist again and again
[1:03:18.760 --> 1:03:25.000]  comes up to articulate and try to promote things that are in the agenda, not least, of course,
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.680]  in his case, censorship of the Internet.
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:34.760]  This is an area that we really need to stop hiding from and pushing, footing around, because
[1:03:34.760 --> 1:03:41.280]  this is not about it's Jewish people, no, no, it's a secret society, which is not entirely
[1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:42.720]  Jewish people either.
[1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:47.800]  One of the few things that Joe Biden has ever said that I agree with is when he said you
[1:03:47.800 --> 1:03:51.200]  don't have to be Jewish to be a Zionist, no, you don't.
[1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:57.080]  People like John McCain, a Zionist in my definition of that, and they pushed that agenda.
[1:03:57.080 --> 1:04:02.280]  Why do you think Israel wants war or some of the interests of them want war so bad?
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:09.920]  Well, because what we have, and we've got to break shortly, but what we have is a global
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:15.680]  structure, Alex, which is akin to a transnational corporation.
[1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:19.800]  If you look at something like McDonald's, it will have a headquarters somewhere in
[1:04:19.800 --> 1:04:25.520]  the world, in America in this case, and in each country around the world, McDonald's
[1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:31.160]  will have subsidiaries like other transnational corporations, and those subsidiaries are there
[1:04:31.160 --> 1:04:39.200]  to carry out and introduce the policies and the direction and the agenda of the headquarters.
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:42.840]  And take over the next country, those countries that are controlled are then going to the
[1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:46.840]  exploitation phase to be a launch base to attack the next nation.
[1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:49.640]  They're basically like aircraft carriers on land.
[1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:50.840]  Well, we'll stay there.
[1:04:50.840 --> 1:04:53.880]  Let's come back and explore this, because I said grab bag, and no idea what you bring
[1:04:53.880 --> 1:04:54.880]  up.
[1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:58.400]  This first, we'll get into that, and then we'll get into all the rest of the things
[1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:00.200]  that are happening.
[1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:06.640]  Folks, Iran and the Middle East nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:11.320]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now,

[1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:18.920]  all you'll get because of huge panic demand.

[1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:02.320]  I had tried everything.
[1:06:02.320 --> 1:06:04.640]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:07.840]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:12.320]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[1:06:12.320 --> 1:06:18.080]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[1:06:18.080 --> 1:06:19.080]  and be satisfied.
[1:06:19.080 --> 1:06:23.600]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at infowarstein.com, but I want to point out
[1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:31.160]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:35.920]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound, when I started taking
[1:06:35.920 --> 1:06:41.200]  the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:42.200]  months.
[1:06:42.200 --> 1:06:43.200]  Now, that's results.
[1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:48.720]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarstein.com and to order just three of
[1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:49.720]  their products.

[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:37.880]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:46.640]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:51.200]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can

[1:07:56.280 --> 1:08:02.560]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it, others don't.
[1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:09.080]  Today's Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:15.200]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:19.840]  We are eight minutes in to this second hour of worldwide broadcast.
[1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:25.840]  It is March 6th, 2012, the where the ides of March.
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:29.320]  We've seen the untimely death of Andrew Breitbart.
[1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:35.080]  We're seeing Obama announce he will kill US citizens overseas, but only secretly arrest
[1:08:35.080 --> 1:08:38.720]  them here, launching wars without congressional approval.
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:42.920]  Benjamin Netanyahu just came to the United States and basically I watched part of the
[1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:43.920]  speech online.
[1:08:43.920 --> 1:08:49.000]  I didn't watch it live, but I watched part of it online this morning and it basically
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  sounded like a declaration of war, like it's a foregone conclusion.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:56.760]  And I had Colonel Schaefer on yesterday, he said it's starting to lean towards that.
[1:08:56.760 --> 1:09:01.080]  Will it be an October surprise or after the election because the gas prices will go up?
[1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:05.680]  Then that'll be used as a political diversion for the open announcement of world government
[1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:06.680]  run by megabanks.
[1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:10.640]  Now, David, I'd just join us the last little segment of you tuned in.
[1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:17.480]  I said out of all the things I ran, the economy, world government, the drones, the microchipping,
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:20.280]  what's most on your radar is I don't do a pre-interview with David.
[1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:21.280]  He's busy.
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:22.280]  I'm busy.
[1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:23.280]  I just want to hear what he has to say.
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:29.200]  The fact that Israel and some of the things that are going on, they're being very close
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:31.480]  to the core of this and tying it into the Rothschilds.
[1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:33.280]  So, go ahead, David.
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:41.600]  Well, what I was saying, Alex, is that this global network, this global cabal of families
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:46.320]  and secret societies operates like a transnational corporation.
[1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:49.640]  Transnational corporation, I was saying, has a headquarters somewhere in the world and
[1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:54.160]  then the subsidiaries in each country carry out the agenda and the policies dictated
[1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:55.160]  from the center.
[1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:59.520]  So, for instance, if you go into a McDonald's in Moscow or Johannesburg or Sydney or New
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:01.840]  York, you're going into basically the same McDonald's.
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:09.040]  Well, what this cabal has created is a secret society and family bloodline aversion of that,
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:13.200]  where the headquarters at operational level certainly is in Europe.
[1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:18.920]  It's in places like the city of London, in Paris, in Rome, and Brussels, places like
[1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:19.920]  that.
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:25.320]  In America, yes, to an extent, but nothing like as much as you'd think, considering how
[1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:31.200]  powerful and upfront America has been in the public arena.
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:39.400]  And so, when you look at names like the United States, Israel even, Britain, these are just
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:46.200]  names for subsidiaries of the global network and they're working to a central dictated
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:47.200]  plan.
[1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:49.200]  That's why there's global standardization.
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:50.200]  Exactly.
[1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:52.120]  It's the same system across the board.
[1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:55.400]  So look what's happening here.
[1:10:55.400 --> 1:11:03.920]  The Rothschilds created modern Israel and as many Jewish historians have written at length
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:07.520]  about, there is no historical justification for it.
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:09.440]  The Rothschilds know that.
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:16.240]  So what they did was create Israel for a specific reason, nothing to do with Jewish people.
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:18.920]  They hung them out to dry in Germany.
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:22.840]  They're planning to hang them out to dry again in this planned third world war.
[1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:28.280]  They couldn't give a damn about Jewish people in general and it's about time Jewish people
[1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:33.600]  in general started to realize this because they've been had by these people.
[1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:39.160]  They have no more concern for them as they have for the rest of the population.
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:49.760]  So Israel's there to create upheaval, divide and rule and agitation in that crucial part
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:53.400]  of the world as part of a much greater global plan.
[1:11:53.400 --> 1:11:59.520]  So you have Israel doing that and Israel is an arm of the Rothschilds just as the United
[1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:06.600]  States and Britain are arms of the Rothschilds and this is why America gives so much fantastic
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:14.680]  amounts of billions of dollars every year to Israel this sliver of land in the Middle
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:21.200]  East which has a population of little more if even that of 8 million people.
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:26.680]  And the reason they do that is because one arm of the Rothschilds, the American government
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:32.640]  is handing that money from American taxpayers and borrowing to another arm of the Rothschilds,
[1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:39.280]  the Israeli government, it doesn't go to the Israeli people in September of 2011, something
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:48.160]  like 400,000 Jewish people Israelis were on the streets in Israel protesting against
[1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:53.800]  their treatment and their economic plight just as the same was happening around in other
[1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:59.640]  parts of the world, 400,000 people in a country of less than 8 million.
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:04.960]  So it's not going to Jewish people, it's going to the Kabbal that control Israel.
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:10.560]  Then you take it to the next stage, when you've got the agitation and the manipulation, then
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:14.720]  in comes the American military overwhelmingly, they're now calling it NATO because they're
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:22.800]  moving towards the world army step by step in this way, but overwhelmingly NATO is America.
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:34.120]  Now why is it that at a time when so many Americans are in such terrible economic plights, when
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:39.040]  you are having enormous numbers of people losing their jobs, losing their homes, losing
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:44.440]  their livelihoods, that if you add all the hidden costs in, the American government is
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:50.720]  still spending borrowing and using taxpayers' money to the tune of something like a trillion
[1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:55.000]  dollars a year on military spending, yeah, probably more.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:59.600]  It's almost two trillion because it's 1.1 on budget, another 800 billion that's supplemental,
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:01.480]  but let me just stop you and back to you.
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:05.160]  Hold on a second, that makes my point even stronger.
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:09.240]  Where I'm going with this is that is not the American military.
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:10.240]  I agree.
[1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:18.680]  That is the Kabbal's military called America and this is why it doesn't serve the interests
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:23.680]  of Americans, certainly not with these cuckoo land amounts of money being spent on slaughtering
[1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:24.680]  people abroad.
[1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:28.480]  Sure, America is a subsidiary, but listen, I've got to throw this at you because you're
[1:14:28.480 --> 1:14:29.480]  absolutely right.
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:30.480]  You've talked about this forever.
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:35.720]  The Rothschilds, as you know, 1215 when Napoleon said he'd won to buy up the stock market when
[1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:41.640]  it crashed and then it went back up, that's all on record, but they sued the mail and
[1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:42.640]  then lost.
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:47.880]  The mail said, the big paper said, you are a secret meal, mastermind, puppet master,
[1:14:47.880 --> 1:14:51.640]  regularly running all these oligarchs and banks, and I'd seen that from research and
[1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:53.480]  then he sued them and then it came out.
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:58.360]  The judge said that they'd lied to him, Nathan Rothschild had, and then indeed he was this
[1:14:58.360 --> 1:14:59.360]  puppet master.
[1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:02.160]  So I wanted to throw that at you to get your take on it.
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:10.200]  Well, the House of Rothschild are one of the major expressions of this bloodline network
[1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:18.760]  and what they've done brilliantly in the last 100 nod years from the turn of the 20th century
[1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:26.600]  is to increase their power and increase their economic power and political manipulative
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:32.640]  power while appearing to have faded into the background.
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:38.480]  What they do is they put people forward like Goldman Sachs and Lloyd Blankfein and people
[1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:43.680]  like this to do their work in the public arena.
[1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:47.560]  By the way, I've got to back you up, I've seen in your big establishment publications
[1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:53.000]  that are more for elites, it says the word Rothschild means discretion and secrecy and
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:54.920]  that's even admitted.
[1:15:54.920 --> 1:15:59.000]  So why do you think he sued the mail for a newspaper for reporting something that's
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  well-known?
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:06.320]  Well, only he knows that, but he made a big mistake, that's for sure, and maybe the tide
[1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:07.320]  is starting to turn.
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:14.200]  I think it is, I think there are signs that it is because the Rothschilds now are increasingly
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:17.320]  finding it more and more difficult to hide behind anonymity.
[1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:21.680]  That was why I ask the question now is what does that signify that the court ruled against
[1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:22.680]  them?
[1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:30.560]  Well, I think Alex, I am seeing more and more signs, not kind of great revelations
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:36.200]  that change society yet, but I am seeing signs that the tide is beginning to turn.
[1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:40.960]  But as I was saying, Netanyahu, therefore, just like the American military is serving
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:47.120]  the Rothschilds agenda, so Netanyahu is serving the Rothschilds agenda, so Obama is serving
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:51.600]  the Rothschild agenda, so David Cameron is serving the Rothschild agenda, and the Rothschild
[1:16:51.600 --> 1:17:00.480]  agenda is for a series of domino takeovers and wars in the Middle East leading to a third
[1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:04.840]  world war between NATO and the so-called West and Russia and China.
[1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:10.320]  So all these people are not operating, I mean, listeners of the show will know this, but
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:15.080]  they are not operating at random and making up as they go along.
[1:17:15.080 --> 1:17:17.640]  This is part of a plan in the Rothschilds' or orchestrated.
[1:17:17.640 --> 1:17:20.360]  Wesley Clark said that years ago, he said he was in there and they said, we are going
[1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:22.640]  to attack these countries in this order and it is now happening.
[1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:24.320]  It is all a program.
[1:17:24.320 --> 1:17:30.800]  Yes, this is what people need to appreciate to start to see the world in the way that
[1:17:30.800 --> 1:17:36.760]  it is as opposed to the movie that we are sold through the mainstream media and through
[1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:37.760]  politics.
[1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:45.360]  That is, the borders that we see as divisions between countries, divisions between units
[1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:50.120]  of nation, are only applicable on the surface.
[1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:56.440]  Behind the scenes, the same cabal is manipulating into all these different countries, so at
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:18:02.880]  the peak of their pyramids, that cabal in each country that runs the politics, the banking,
[1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:04.960]  etc., is answering to the same master.
[1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:05.960]  Sure, compartmentalization.
[1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:08.040]  We are about to go to break, but I want to ask you this.
[1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:09.400]  How is it going for them?
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:13.040]  From everything I have seen, it is not going well, but they have still got the momentum
[1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:14.720]  to try to carry it out.
[1:18:14.720 --> 1:18:20.760]  Well, I have been feeling for a while, Alex, a sense of panic.
[1:18:20.760 --> 1:18:28.200]  When you panic, you make mistakes, and when you panic, you tend to be unable to keep under
[1:18:28.200 --> 1:18:32.880]  wraps what you are doing, and I am seeing this happening more and more and more.
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:39.120]  On one level, they are pushing on and on and on, but they are pushing on, I have been saying
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:46.200]  this for years, and all this Orwellian extremism that is coming in, it is because it is a defense
[1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:51.480]  mechanism overwhelmingly to the awakening of the people, which they knew was coming
[1:18:51.480 --> 1:18:56.040]  and they now know is really gathering more and more momentum.
[1:18:56.040 --> 1:19:00.040]  It is no accident, Alex, or coincidence, I mean, goodness me, what are the chances of
[1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:05.360]  it, that at the very time demonstrably, more and more people, for more walks of life, people
[1:19:05.360 --> 1:19:09.480]  who would have laughed at this not long ago, are opening their minds to a new vision of
[1:19:09.480 --> 1:19:17.160]  the world at the very same time that this Orwellian extremism is getting more and more extreme.
[1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:21.560]  It is because it is a defense mechanism, they are terrified of humanity waking up, because
[1:19:21.560 --> 1:19:26.200]  the only way they have been able to enslave humanity up to this point is humanity being
[1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:30.800]  asleep to what is going on, that is changing, and that is why they are worried, and that
[1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:34.200]  is why they are panicking, and that is why they are trying to push this agenda on faster
[1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:38.840]  and faster and faster, because they know there is a point when a humanity will have awoken
[1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:42.920]  enough, awakened enough for the game to be over.
[1:19:42.920 --> 1:19:48.040]  I would stay there, I talked to a very prominent person in entertainment a few days ago, and
[1:19:48.040 --> 1:19:53.040]  he openly told me, he said, I was talking to one of these top elitists, and I should
[1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:56.000]  have asked him if I could talk about it on record without saying the name, and the elitist
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:01.120]  said to him, we are only letting you live, we just admitted the illuminati to him.
[1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:07.080]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis, everyone can feel it.
[1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:12.680]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those
[1:20:12.680 --> 1:20:15.760]  who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:22.880]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising, but take heart for every action there is an equal and
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:24.280]  oppositely action.
[1:20:24.280 --> 1:20:28.720]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they are losing the info
[1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:29.720]  war.
[1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:33.480]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:36.520]  The globalists are scared, they have overreached.
[1:20:36.520 --> 1:20:39.920]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:55.440]  globalist propaganda platform.
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:57.680]  We are going to use their system against them.
[1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:02.520]  The info war now goes into high gear.
[1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:07.560]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:12.720]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the door sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.

[1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:31.720]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:35.120]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, and investment advisors won't talk about
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:36.120]  gold IRAs?
[1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:40.520]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:42.160]  of gold for your retirement.
[1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:45.680]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:21:45.680 --> 1:21:50.640]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:56.560]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:56.560 --> 1:22:03.880]  Hear your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:07.340]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[1:22:07.340 --> 1:22:08.640]  like no one is home.
[1:22:08.640 --> 1:22:10.840]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[1:22:10.840 --> 1:22:14.400]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with fake TV.
[1:22:14.400 --> 1:22:18.800]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television,
[1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:21.880]  so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:26.360]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:31.080]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous
[1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:32.360]  police departments.
[1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:34.160]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:42.080]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:46.800]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one for
[1:22:46.800 --> 1:22:49.840]  safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:58.560]  Call 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com, faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:23.320]  Your body needs to keep inflammation down is glutathione.
[1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:27.960]  The number one food to support a dramatic increase in glutathione production is undamaged
[1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:29.920]  whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:34.920]  Virtually all whey proteins are damaged by heat, filtration, and chemicals, except one.
[1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:38.200]  One World Way is the most life-giving whey protein on the market.
[1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:41.720]  It is changing the lives of its users in very positive ways.
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:46.640]  One World Way may act as one of the most important health foods to support your and your child's
[1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:48.480]  optimal brain function.
[1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:56.720]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit 1worldway.com.
[1:23:56.720 --> 1:23:59.240]  That's 1worldwey.com.
[1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:11.080]  All right, I want to segue into the open world government being announced.
[1:24:11.080 --> 1:24:16.040]  The militarization of police, everything that David and others have talked about unfolding.
[1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:20.880]  So, where does he see things going now that our credibility just rises and rises and rises?
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:25.960]  But on the issue of Israel, I want to be nuanced about this because this is my real feelings
[1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:27.640]  and research on it.
[1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:36.000]  I, of course, learn stuff all the time.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:45.880]  I have researched this over the years, and of course, I was naive early on.
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:51.200]  Because I'm somebody who never gets into any racial stuff, tribal stuff, mafia stuff,
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:52.200]  any of this.
[1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:56.880]  I just am about liberty and freedom, and all humans are good and bad.
[1:24:56.880 --> 1:25:01.280]  But on the Israel subject, really studying it, and the mainline history books that have
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:06.640]  been written, that the Rothschilds actually helped at many levels keep Jews in Germany,
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:11.080]  wouldn't let them immigrate anywhere but Israel before Israel was set up again.
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:16.240]  You have the Ringworm children, over 110,000 Jewish children, microwaves, fried, a lot of
[1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:20.400]  them killed by the Israeli government, along with the U.S. government.
[1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:23.800]  So this eugenics agenda is targeting everybody.
[1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:27.040]  I mean, Jewish people don't get a memo, hey, don't take vaccines, it's going to give you
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:28.040]  crones.
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:34.520]  They don't get a memo, hey, don't drink the fluoride, you know, 99%, like you said.
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:43.480]  It's hiding within Jewish religion, some of it hiding within patriotism for Israel.
[1:25:43.480 --> 1:25:46.760]  And the average Jew I talk to is totally unaware of this.
[1:25:46.760 --> 1:25:53.320]  But again, and I don't see it as even the heart of this program being about Israel or
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:59.080]  about Jewish religion or any of that, but it is one of the central spokes to it.
[1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:05.640]  And the final equation, David, this is a system that wants to destroy everybody, and I think
[1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:09.480]  you were getting at that, but you cannot deny that the Rothschilds are right at the center
[1:26:09.480 --> 1:26:10.480]  of it and then use.
[1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:14.120]  I mean, I know you 15 years ago never talked about Israel or Jewish stuff, and you would
[1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:17.560]  be attacked and say, you're really being anti-Semitic with code words.
[1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:18.560]  I get attacked.
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:20.200]  So I get attacked by the Nazis.
[1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:27.120]  I get attacked by the ADL, you know, Israeli operative groups, because the system wants
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:29.160]  us to fight with each other.
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:30.560]  Do you see where I'm going with this, David?
[1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:32.440]  It's all part of the divide and rule.
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:37.480]  This is the thing that we need to do as a human race.
[1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:43.080]  Those that were on the streets of Israel, 400,000 and more, those who have been on the streets
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:52.760]  of New York, of Britain, of Greece, Australia, all over the world, we need to realize that
[1:26:52.760 --> 1:26:59.880]  the force that we are protesting against, whether it's the Israeli government, the Australian
[1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:03.120]  government, whatever, is the same force.
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:09.600]  They're just different masks on the same global face, and the Israelis and the government
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:17.400]  and hierarchy and the Rothschilds, et cetera, have just as much absolute contempt for the
[1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:22.400]  mass of Jewish people as they have for everyone else, and this is an interesting thing that
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:31.520]  a lot of people don't realize, is that the first Zionist Congress was held in Barl, Switzerland
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:34.960]  in the latter years of the 19th century.
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:39.440]  But that's not where it was supposed to have been held to start with.
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:45.160]  The first Zionist Congress was scheduled to be held in Munich, Germany, and they had
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:52.040]  to move it to Switzerland because of opposition from Jewish people in Germany who didn't want
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:57.800]  anything to do, thank you very much, with being transported to Israel according to
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:02.200]  this Zionist agenda, in other words, Rothschild Zionist agenda.
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:09.920]  And then of course, and I would strongly suggest this is not a coincidence, the German Jews
[1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:17.240]  were treated grotesquely in the decades that followed through the rise of the Nazi party
[1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:22.160]  and all that stuff, and of course the Nazis were funded by the Rockefellers, by the Bush
[1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:23.160]  family through the...
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:24.160]  On record.
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:25.160]  On record.
[1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:26.160]  On international hearings.
[1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:27.160]  Exactly.
[1:28:27.160 --> 1:28:34.520]  The Rockefellers funded a whole floor of a German university for a guy called Ernst Rudin
[1:28:34.520 --> 1:28:37.840]  who was Hitler's race purity expert.
[1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:39.560]  The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:40.560]  Yes, exactly.
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:44.120]  And it's like I've just said, Alex, there are no borders with these people, and if we
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:47.800]  see borders and divisions like that, we're going to lose the plot.
[1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:54.720]  And so as a result of the appalling way that Jews were treated in Germany, suddenly they
[1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:59.040]  were moving out of Germany to Israel and they were moving to the United States.
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:04.200]  In other words, the Rothschilds got what they wanted as a result of the Nazis and what
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:05.280]  they did.
[1:29:05.280 --> 1:29:07.040]  This is not a coincidence.
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:15.240]  Now when you look at Israel and their grotesque treatment of the Palestinians, it is a mirror
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:20.440]  of the way the Nazis operated in Germany in so many ways.
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:28.560]  Now, that is not a paradox because the same force that was behind the Nazis that treated
[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:34.280]  the Jews in that way in Germany is the same force behind the Israeli regime that's treating
[1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:36.000]  the Palestinians as they are today.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  All right, stay there.
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.280]  David, you can get a drink of water because I can hear you need to cough.
[1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:40.280]  We're going to come right back.
[1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:41.280]  Long second coming up.
[1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:42.280]  We'll get into a bunch of other issues.
[1:29:42.280 --> 1:29:44.800]  I asked David what he was going to talk about, and this is it.
[1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:45.960]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:50.360]  Very interesting information.
[1:29:50.360 --> 1:29:51.640]  We're on the march.
[1:29:51.640 --> 1:29:54.360]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:58.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:58.360 --> 1:30:02.720]  Hi, folks.
[1:30:02.720 --> 1:30:03.720]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:30:03.720 --> 1:30:08.560]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized
[1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:09.560]  risk.
[1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:10.720]  Saving means to make money.
[1:30:10.720 --> 1:30:15.320]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned
[1:30:15.320 --> 1:30:20.440]  real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.

[1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:27.840]  or antibacterials.
[1:30:27.840 --> 1:30:33.480]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[1:30:33.480 --> 1:30:35.800]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[1:30:35.800 --> 1:30:39.120]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[1:30:39.120 --> 1:30:41.160]  to do something you've never done before.

[1:31:00.760 --> 1:31:05.800]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[1:31:05.800 --> 1:31:10.480]  good-sized meal that I was still starving, and my research led me to a well-known fact
[1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:14.680]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:20.080]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:25.120]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[1:31:25.120 --> 1:31:26.120]  be healthy.
[1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:32.120]  Calben searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there, and discovered Young Jevity.

[1:32:54.400 --> 1:33:21.400]  That's it for this week's video, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one.
[1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:36.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, bottom line governments get power out of wars and they get to take
[1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:39.240]  the liberties of the general public.
[1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:46.160]  And whether it's communist Chinese or thug enforcers here in the United States, Israel
[1:33:46.160 --> 1:33:54.000]  or anywhere, they have the same wicked gleam in their eye of authoritarian domination,
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  blood thirst.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:58.680]  And it's up to good people to stand up against evil people.
[1:33:58.680 --> 1:34:01.240]  And David was talking about divide and conquer.
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:03.760]  That's what the system seeks to do is to divide us.
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:10.440]  My only mission, my goal is to have humanity survive and thrive and to have a future and
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:13.520]  I want everyone, race, color, creed, religion to do that.
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:18.720]  But the globalists are masters at playing us off against each other and masters through
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:23.440]  multiculturalism to actually turn everyone against each other in the name of that and
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:27.800]  to try to force populations in together to play them off against each other.
[1:34:27.800 --> 1:34:28.800]  That's what's happening.
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:32.680]  And now the West has overthrown Iran over and over again.
[1:34:32.680 --> 1:34:34.720]  It's steaming towards war again.
[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:37.520]  David, is there going to be an Iran war?
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:39.800]  What do you see happening in the future?
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:40.920]  Where is this going?
[1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:43.640]  US prices, open announcements of world government.
[1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:45.440]  I mean, I thought we were crazies.
[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:52.400]  But oh, we're a megabanks, we'll run Europe and the U.S. and issue the global SDR.
[1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:54.200]  It's all happening.
[1:34:54.200 --> 1:34:59.240]  Carbon taxes, Jenna 21, shutting down rural areas, arresting Amish everywhere, arresting
[1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:01.480]  people selling tomatoes on the side of the road.
[1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:06.920]  I mean, police running around with crazed eyes, military checkpoints now everywhere, TSA on
[1:35:06.920 --> 1:35:07.920]  highways.
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:09.520]  I mean, it is really starting to move.
[1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:11.440]  David Ike, what's happening?
[1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:13.840]  Well, it is.
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:19.880]  And you know, I've been saying for a long, long time that this is not just happening
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:25.840]  in the realms of the reality that we experience is coming from somewhere much deeper.
[1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:28.960]  And you cannot orchestrate.
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:33.960]  You've just articulated a long list of things, Alex, and they are a long list of things within
[1:35:33.960 --> 1:35:40.720]  an enormous vast list of things that are happening and they dovetail with each other.
[1:35:40.720 --> 1:35:47.840]  This is being orchestrated, not by people sitting around the tables deciding the next
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:54.000]  move, but from very, very deep beyond this reality, I would suggest, and it's playing
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  out here.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:01.360]  A simple thing, how I've noticed this, and I'm sure other people have too, who've
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:02.680]  researched this.
[1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:05.800]  When something happens, there's never one reason for it.
[1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:08.520]  There might be a prime reason, but there's never just one reason.
[1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:14.120]  And what you've got now is the, and I've talked about it in this new book, funnily enough,
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:20.960]  which of course was written and finished some months ago, that on one side, they want this
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:27.360]  war with Iran and they are creating mayhem and devastation in the Middle East.
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:32.440]  But on the other hand, of course, that's bound to have a massive impact and we've seen nothing
[1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:37.960]  yet, I would suggest, on oil prices, which then devastates the world economy.
[1:36:37.960 --> 1:36:41.240]  So it's like everything connects to everything else.
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:46.080]  It's nothing's working in isolation, and as I've been saying for years, the time's going
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:47.080]  to come.
[1:36:47.080 --> 1:36:54.800]  We're here when they are going to throw absolutely everything at us, so that we, in a panic,
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:59.240]  in despair, just say, do something, and whatever it is.
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:04.120]  They're lining up a whole bunch of agendas that build towards that interlocking nexus
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:11.160]  at the top, and they only do things if it adds another lego or another domino or another
[1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:13.320]  stack in the pyramid to their whole agenda.
[1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:18.880]  You can see it like fractal nanotech, and I agree, that's what all the religions say,
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:22.960]  that's what common sense says, we're in the middle of space, and that's what you're saying,
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:25.200]  people get blown away by, but what are Christians saying?
[1:37:25.200 --> 1:37:31.520]  There is an alien or dark force, that's what my gut says, this is beyond human intelligence.
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:33.360]  This is a master evil.
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:39.600]  Well, what's interesting when you research this is whether it's religions or whether
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:46.400]  it's ancient cultures or whatever, if you just take a step back from the different
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:53.560]  names and the different ways of describing it, there is an unbelievable common theme.
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:59.880]  The Sumerian tablets found in what is now Iraq talk about a non-human force they call
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:03.960]  that has become known as the Anunnaki, those who from heaven to earth came.
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:10.480]  In the Islamic religion, they have the phenomenon of the jinn that are entities that operate
[1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:17.840]  outside of human sight, manipulate humanity without being seen, and manipulate human perception
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:20.280]  of reality through the human mind.
[1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:24.600]  You then have the... Yeah, they play tricks on you, you ask for a ton of gold, you better
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:27.640]  ask for it 10 feet in front of you, they're going to drop it on your head.
[1:38:27.640 --> 1:38:35.800]  And then you have the demon theme within the Christian religion, and what have you.
[1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:41.880]  And then you have the Gnostics, which is a word I understand means knowledge.
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:46.360]  These were the Cathars who were slaughtered, these were the people that ran the Great Library
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:53.600]  of Alexandria who were slaughtered, and so were their writings destroyed.
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:39:00.600]  But in 1945 in Egypt, a great mass of them were found, which gave the Gnostic view of
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:06.720]  what's happening in the world, and one fifth, something like one fifth of the texts are
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:13.600]  about entities they call Archons, which are manipulating human society and manipulating
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:18.200]  it through the human mind, exactly what the Islamic religion says.
[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:23.120]  And then you go to South Africa, and the Zulu culture, where they talk about the Chittahuri.
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:29.080]  Well look at Jewish mysticism and all of that, and King Solomon and the Genies and all that.
[1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:38.000]  Yeah, Alex, it's all in front of us if only we would stop dividing and compartmentalizing
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:43.280]  these things by the different names and the different name given to the belief system.
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:47.880]  Okay, so I mean this is pretty far out because I normally cover just political stuff we can
[1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:52.360]  prove, but obviously we can cover this for any audience because the elite at Bohemian
[1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:54.720]  Grove, Skull and Bones, they are obsessed with it.
[1:39:54.720 --> 1:39:59.400]  I've talked to people on record and off record, rich widows of very famous people where their
[1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:05.600]  husbands were worshiping the owl idols, the goat idols, they really believe in this.
[1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:10.200]  I've been to Bohemian Grove, they are getting off on it, so even if you don't believe in
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:13.920]  this, atheists and people out there, the elite are obsessed with this.
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:19.280]  None of them are non-religious, and they believe they're getting power from these entities.
[1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:23.120]  So from your research, what do the entities want?
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:28.480]  This is the point, Alex, that you were talking about earlier in terms of Jewish people and
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:31.560]  the Zionist elite and all the rest of it.
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:39.200]  The elites that control the governments around the world are not following Judaism or Christianity.
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:44.120]  They're following what we call Satanism.
[1:40:44.120 --> 1:40:51.400]  And Satanism, if you really study it, is the worship of these entities under endless names
[1:40:51.400 --> 1:40:55.080]  that were perceived to be the gods.
[1:40:55.080 --> 1:40:59.440]  This is why the Mayans worshiped a serpent god called Kukul Khan.
[1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:03.560]  This is why in Central America, other cultures worshiped the feathered serpent god called
[1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:04.560]  Kwexikotl.
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:07.560]  All over, you see this recurring theme.
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:13.240]  They are Satanists, and what's happening at Satanic rituals while they're doing the sacrifice
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:18.600]  is the entities operating outside the very narrow frequency band of human sight called
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:20.920]  visible light by scientists.
[1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:26.480]  They're feeding off the energy of terror that's coming off the victim.
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:34.440]  And so a war, a war, pepper bombing Tripoli or Baghdad or a world war.
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:35.440]  It's a feeding frenzy.
[1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:37.320]  Oh, it's a feeding frenzy.
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:38.640]  It's unbelievable.
[1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:39.640]  What is it?
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:41.040]  It's bloodlust.
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:46.240]  You see, you mentioned earlier, Alex, that these people have a bloodlust.
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:52.000]  Well, it's not even, as we know, it's not even theoretical or symbolic bloodlust.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  It's a real one.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  They drink the stuff.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  That's the old term, bloodthirsty.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:57.720]  Yes, exactly that.
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:41:58.720]  So we have a bloodthirsty...
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:04.440]  So you're talking about interdimensional vampires, basically, which we see them bombarding us
[1:42:04.440 --> 1:42:06.360]  with vampiric iconography.
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:07.360]  What is that?
[1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:08.880]  No pun intended.
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:10.600]  This comes...
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:12.720]  This is where vampires come from.
[1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:17.920]  You know, in Zulu law and in other native cultures...
[1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:19.480]  The ancient Greeks believed in it.
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:21.320]  They had vampire hunting deals.
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:28.480]  Yes, they say that cannibalism was introduced to human society by these entities because
[1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:34.720]  they are cannibals and they eat human flesh and drink human blood as do their hybrid representatives
[1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:37.960]  that we call the elite bloodlines or the aristocracy and the royal families and those
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:41.120]  that control the banks and all the governments and all the rest of it.
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:51.680]  So this whole human sacrifice, cannibalistic phenomenon came with these entities and therefore
[1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:58.200]  for a long time, when humans were, shall we say, less evolved than they are now, at least
[1:42:58.200 --> 1:43:03.800]  large numbers of them are now, they could openly do their sacrifices to the gods.
[1:43:03.800 --> 1:43:09.920]  And by the way, when they talked about the sacrificing young virgins to the gods, that
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:11.560]  was code for children.
[1:43:11.560 --> 1:43:16.000]  That's why so many children go missing and end up being sacrificed to the gods.
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:20.960]  But there came a point where humanity had grown up to the point where it was no longer
[1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:23.120]  acceptable to do this stuff openly.
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:25.560]  So now they do it as wars, but what about Ezekiel?
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:29.120]  The whole Bible says, give not your children to the fires of Moloch.
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:32.280]  I mean, it says children being sacrificed right there.
[1:43:32.280 --> 1:43:38.680]  Well, yeah, I mean, what I'm saying is that people have no problem, Alex, that there was
[1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:42.240]  human sacrifice and child sacrifice in the ancient world, right?
[1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:43.240]  No problem.
[1:43:43.240 --> 1:43:45.200]  What I'm saying is it never ended.
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:49.120]  It just went underground because humanity reached the point where it wouldn't have it
[1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:50.120]  anymore.
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:54.960]  And it's happening on an unbelievable scale, I cannot tell you.
[1:43:54.960 --> 1:44:00.440]  The number of children that go missing in the world every year, never to be seen again,
[1:44:00.440 --> 1:44:06.640]  is utterly shocking beyond belief.
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:12.880]  Because these entities want the energy of children before puberty, because at puberty
[1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:16.400]  we see puberty as a hormonal chemical change.
[1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:22.440]  But what it is to these entities is the human energy field of the children changes and it
[1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:28.200]  plays through as hormonal change at the chemical level, but it starts and is fundamentally driven
[1:44:28.200 --> 1:44:30.040]  by an energetic change.
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:33.960]  They want the child's energy before that change takes place, and that's why they're
[1:44:33.960 --> 1:44:38.640]  obsessed with children, and that's why there's so many missing children.
[1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:44.760]  What's going on in the world, even to most conspiracy researchers who brilliantly and
[1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:53.720]  good luck to them are doing the banking, the wars, the manipulated terrorist attacks,
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:55.840]  even to many of them, they won't go here.
[1:44:55.840 --> 1:44:56.840]  But this is what's happening.
[1:44:56.840 --> 1:45:03.000]  Let me add a caveat to that, David, I'm sure you know about this, but it turns out Dincor,
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:06.560]  who's been in congressional hearings running giant child kidnapping rings, I mean even
[1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:11.480]  the UN said in a two year period in southern Europe 1.2 million women and children went
[1:45:11.480 --> 1:45:12.480]  missing.
[1:45:12.480 --> 1:45:19.160]  I mean, this is like factory level Armageddon Holocaust extermination level disappearing
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:22.800]  into all these labyrinths to feed this, the snuff films, all of it.
[1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:26.760]  But then I learned, people said you didn't know, it was actually what Catherine Austin
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:33.000]  Fitz about five years ago pointed out, and I went and searched and did, and it was true
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:38.800]  that Dincor runs the private CPS, on average they've got more than half the contracts in
[1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:43.680]  the country at the health departments, and they're Dincor people, and that it even came
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:49.120]  out on CNN a few years after that, that in Florida alone there was like 3,500 missing
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:52.560]  kids they'd taken, they were finding them dead in other countries and stuff, but it
[1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:54.120]  got shut down.
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:46:00.240]  They are actually operating the CPS in many cases is actually a foreign kidnapping ring
[1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:01.240]  operation.
[1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:05.000]  I mean, it's so off the charts evil right there.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:06.640]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:11.040]  Alex, that's just an interesting point because in this new book, remember who you are in
[1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:16.840]  the last one, humorous get off your knees, I addressed this very subject in considerable
[1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:23.760]  detail because I've had a lot of experience of it in this country and in America, when
[1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:29.600]  I say experience, I mean, I've interacted and been with people who've had their children
[1:46:29.600 --> 1:46:38.600]  taken away and stuff like that, and as a result of that, I realized just how this child protection
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:44.280]  services scam is not there to protect children, it's the last thing they want to do.
[1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:48.480]  There are some genuine people that they've got list of certain kids are looking for.
[1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:52.520]  If you've got a black haired blue eyed girl, that's their favorite or green eyed, then
[1:46:52.520 --> 1:46:53.960]  it goes into blonde blue eyed.
[1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:55.560]  I mean, they are hunting.
[1:46:55.560 --> 1:47:05.040]  See this is what I've gone into in detail in these books because they are seeking to
[1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:12.640]  have an endless flow of children for what they want and what they do with them and what
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:16.720]  better way than to control child protection services.
[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:20.120]  Now what's happened in Britain, and I know it's happened in America, so I've researched
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:28.440]  all that, is that the number of children being taken not just from families per se, but from
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:34.000]  blatantly loving families and caring families is going off the rick to scale.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:39.680]  Tony Blair, who's big time involved in all this and absolutely agrees with it, when he
[1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:46.120]  was Prime Minister of Britain, introduced, believe it or not, incentives, financial incentives
[1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:52.440]  to councils to meet targets for taking children away from their natural care.
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:53.440]  No, it's global standardization.
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:57.080]  Bill Clinton started that, where they have to increase the quota each year or get none
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:47:58.080]  of the federal money.
[1:47:58.080 --> 1:48:03.600]  I mean, these are, and of course he's admitted a cultist, his wife's a witch, and when you
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:06.880]  see Tony Blair folks, it is a literal vampire.
[1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:11.320]  Just that, you know, the teeth don't do all that, it's a demonic goblin.
[1:48:11.320 --> 1:48:18.360]  Now just let's look at this, you are giving financial incentives to these organizations
[1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:19.360]  to meet.
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:24.080]  You pay so they can steal your kids and gang rape them before they cut their heads off
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:26.560]  and do all the things to them.
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:33.960]  Any sane society that cared about the children and cared about justice would never have any
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:40.320]  incentive to take children away from their parents because every single case would have
[1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:42.880]  to be judged on the merits of the case.
[1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:46.600]  Well, the CPS worldwide is five times more likely, it's the same in England, to abuse
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:49.280]  children than any other group.
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:54.680]  It's admitted that they are a black hole of child abuse and devilry.
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:58.240]  Yes they are, and it happens in every country.
[1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:02.040]  Now we come back to this global web, I talked about earlier.
[1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:07.520]  This global web not only controls the banking system and the transnational corporations
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:13.960]  and the governments and the media ownership and the mainstream level, it also controls
[1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:20.160]  via these corporations and in Britain via the British government network, these child
[1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:22.680]  protection services.
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:30.600]  It controls the police that's supposed to investigate the abuse of children and allegations
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:38.240]  by children about abuse by famous people, but they don't because that's controlled
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:39.240]  too.
[1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:44.280]  They control the courts which take the children away against all the evidence.
[1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:46.200]  This is what's happening.
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:53.040]  This network, this global corporation of bloodlines and civil society controls all these different
[1:49:53.040 --> 1:49:59.640]  elements of society so we're not looking at individual isolated dots like the courts
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:01.840]  and the CPS and all the rest of it.
[1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:03.840]  We're looking at a network of all kinds.
[1:50:03.840 --> 1:50:08.440]  I've been to these CPS courts watching it and I've seen it across the nation on YouTube,
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:09.680]  the court hearings.
[1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:15.320]  It's 90% of the time a weird jackboot, butch-haired woman screaming at families and literally
[1:50:15.320 --> 1:50:16.520]  licking their lips.
[1:50:16.520 --> 1:50:19.760]  I mean you're looking, if you saw the one on the street you'd say that is some kind
[1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:25.560]  of pervert demon and they are giant pervert demons openly like an octopus just grabbing
[1:50:25.560 --> 1:50:26.560]  kids.
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:32.280]  It's like the witch from the Little Mermaid.
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:36.320]  These judges that take the kids, 90% of them are more, every time I see them, they look
[1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:38.840]  like the witch from the Little Mermaid.
[1:50:38.840 --> 1:50:43.600]  We've had people in this country after they've won in a court to take children away from
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:44.880]  loving families.
[1:50:44.880 --> 1:50:47.760]  We've had them high-fiving in the court.
[1:50:47.760 --> 1:50:49.160]  This is what we're dealing with.
[1:50:49.160 --> 1:50:50.160]  No empathy.
[1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:51.160]  No, no.
[1:50:51.160 --> 1:50:54.000]  The vampires know, man, it's going to be gang raping tonight.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:57.760]  They're going to have that kid crying, squealing, and they're going to be lucky if they live.
[1:50:57.760 --> 1:51:00.760]  The devils are going to have some fun, we'll be right back.
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:07.440]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights
[1:51:07.440 --> 1:51:08.440]  back on?
[1:51:08.440 --> 1:51:12.160]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because there's
[1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:16.240]  never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[1:51:16.240 --> 1:51:17.240]  Here's why.
[1:51:17.240 --> 1:51:21.760]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions From Science, one
[1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:23.360]  of our oldest sponsors.

[1:51:28.160 --> 1:51:33.520]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity
[1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:34.520]  from the sun.
[1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:38.760]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own, whether it's
[1:51:38.760 --> 1:51:41.160]  ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts.
[1:51:41.160 --> 1:51:44.400]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:48.560]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:49.960]  Solutions From Science.

[1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:05.760]  2012 is finally here, and while the government racks up another $1 trillion in debt, the
[1:53:05.760 --> 1:53:08.640]  IRS is hard at work collecting.
[1:53:08.640 --> 1:53:13.160]  In fact, they're even sending agents to some people's homes in place of business.
[1:53:13.160 --> 1:53:18.040]  If you owe back taxes, have years of unfiled tax returns or are receiving threatening letters
[1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:26.200]  or phone calls, call the tax division of the law offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978.
[1:53:26.200 --> 1:53:31.920]  Our tax division is spearheaded by a former IRS agent with over 31 years experience.
[1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:36.680]  He knows the ins and outs of the IRS and how to get them off your back once and for all.
[1:53:36.680 --> 1:53:43.920]  The phone call is free and so is the consultation, so call now 800-652-6978.
[1:53:43.920 --> 1:53:47.800]  That's 800-652-6978.
[1:53:47.800 --> 1:53:50.280]  Don't wait for agents to knock on your door.
[1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:58.760]  Call 800-652-6978 or visit us on the web at www.CraigZLaw.com.
[1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:00.760]  You'll be glad you did.
[1:54:00.760 --> 1:54:09.040]  All right, David will be with us five minutes in the next hour, then Bruce Fine, Ron Paul's
[1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:13.480]  chief advisor, policy advisor will be joining us to talk about what's happening in our world
[1:54:13.480 --> 1:54:14.480]  for a full hour.
[1:54:14.480 --> 1:54:15.480]  By the way, is he joining us via Skype?
[1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:18.280]  Because I know he was on the nightly news while back on Skype.
[1:54:18.280 --> 1:54:23.520]  Wow, that's going to be great for a video Skype, not just for radio listeners, but for
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:25.040]  people watching at PrismPana.TV.
[1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:27.160]  It's great to have David via audio Skype.
[1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:28.760]  He's like, he's in the room with us.
[1:54:28.760 --> 1:54:32.560]  I wanted to tell you, David's going to be speaking at two events in Hawaii this month
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:38.920]  in Honolulu on an all day on March 24th and Maui all day on March 31st.
[1:54:38.920 --> 1:54:43.600]  He has a new book out called Remember Who You Are, DavidIke.com, and I should add, again,
[1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:48.120]  I remember 15, 16 years ago seeing David Ike Steffen thinking, man, this is crazy.
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:53.640]  But over the years, the way he politely just took some mean comments I'd said about him,
[1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:56.920]  like a gentleman, and then the fact that listening to him and talking to him, I just have a good
[1:54:56.920 --> 1:54:57.920]  feeling.
[1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:02.080]  I learned to golf my instincts, and I just get a good feeling when I listen to him, when
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:03.080]  I talk to him.
[1:55:03.080 --> 1:55:05.800]  And I don't 100% golf my discernment, but I just do.
[1:55:05.800 --> 1:55:09.480]  And I hope everything he's saying isn't true, because it's so crazy.
[1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:13.120]  But regardless, a lot of it's been turned out to be true.
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:17.640]  And we just need to realize we're in a spiritual world.
[1:55:17.640 --> 1:55:20.760]  There's a lot going on we don't see, and the elites are obsessed with it, and they're
[1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:21.840]  in control.
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:23.200]  So why are they obsessed with it?
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:27.200]  If that wasn't going to tell us, oh, be atheist, nothing's going on, that's because they want
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:30.040]  you basically blind to what's going on.
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:34.280]  Also, if you want to support us, well, I'm supporting us.
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:38.400]  We've got 100 business cards with infowars.com on them that are got you are the resistance
[1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:39.400]  on them.
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:42.560]  And it says some rulebook and two bumper stickers for one penny.
[1:55:42.560 --> 1:55:46.680]  All you pay is the 495 for shipping, and that really is at cost.
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:49.560]  And we're getting like 500 orders for these a day, which is going to be really successful,
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:51.440]  but I don't know if the guys can handle it.
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:55.480]  So I made us continue this special and boost the price just to get less orders, because
[1:55:55.480 --> 1:55:57.320]  then I'll lose money about to hire extra people.
[1:55:57.320 --> 1:56:00.000]  I'm happy to do it at cost, but I can't lose money.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:04.480]  We've got a bunch of great deals on books and videos and films exposing Oklahoma City
[1:56:04.480 --> 1:56:06.440]  as an inside job.
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:10.680]  It's all available at infowars.com.
[1:56:10.680 --> 1:56:14.480]  So I hope that you will go there and support us if you believe in the message we're putting
[1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:16.800]  out and want to support free speech in this country.
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:20.120]  Going back to David, only three or four minutes left in this segment, five minutes to the
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:21.120]  next.
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:27.040]  And it's very painful to me to know that they are obsessed with hurting children.
[1:56:27.040 --> 1:56:28.040]  They are doing it.
[1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:36.720]  I've seen it, what you described, the high-fiving, all the abuse that comes out that they enforce
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:41.640]  on themselves, but humanity has backed them off before and at least made it go underground.
[1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:44.920]  They're trying to sell us on torture, secret arrest now.
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:50.920]  They're trying to turn our political and spiritual atmosphere into what they are.
[1:56:50.920 --> 1:56:53.640]  How does all this end in your mind?
[1:56:53.640 --> 1:57:01.120]  Well, I was talking 22 years ago from the very start of my conscious awareness of any
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:05.960]  of this stuff about the fact that there was a vibrational change coming.
[1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:11.880]  I dubbed them the truth vibrations because I understood that they would have the effect
[1:57:11.880 --> 1:57:16.200]  of bringing to the surface all that had been hidden from humanity.
[1:57:16.200 --> 1:57:20.920]  Now, God, 22 years ago, there was no sign of that.
[1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:21.920]  But look at it now.
[1:57:21.920 --> 1:57:27.520]  I mean, the very fact that what we're doing now is talking about this stuff.
[1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:31.840]  What we know now about what's happening in the world and what's going on in the background
[1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:37.080]  and how it's controlled is off the Richter scale compared with what we knew 22 years
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:40.520]  ago, even 10 years ago, much of it, and what have you.
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:46.040]  And the other thing that I was told would happen is that this vibrational change, this
[1:57:46.040 --> 1:57:53.960]  quickening of the vibrational fabric of this reality would have the effect of acting like
[1:57:53.960 --> 1:57:55.960]  a spiritual alarm clock.
[1:57:55.960 --> 1:58:02.640]  And people would start to wake up from their slumber, their coma, their amnesic state,
[1:58:02.640 --> 1:58:06.520]  and they would start to, this is the title of the book, this is where it comes from,
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:12.240]  they would start to remember who they really were, not the body, but consciousness, infinite
[1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:17.480]  consciousness with infinite potential, having an experience through the vehicle of the body.
[1:58:17.480 --> 1:58:27.160]  And clearly, when I look back 22 years, I look back 10 years, even five years, the numbers
[1:58:27.160 --> 1:58:34.280]  of people now who are awakening to another view of themselves and the world is absolutely
[1:58:34.280 --> 1:58:35.280]  phenomenal.
[1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:41.800]  60 seconds, stay there, finish up on this back in 60 with David Ike.
[1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:51.120]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.120 --> 1:58:55.760]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:58:55.760 --> 1:59:00.080]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:59:00.080 --> 1:59:04.400]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:59:04.400 --> 1:59:05.720]  allows you to have.
[1:59:05.720 --> 1:59:11.440]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:59:11.440 --> 1:59:15.760]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:59:15.760 --> 1:59:19.760]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:59:19.760 --> 1:59:23.240]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:59:23.240 --> 1:59:26.960]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:31.840]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:59:31.840 --> 1:59:35.520]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:59:35.520 --> 1:59:36.920]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[1:59:36.920 --> 1:59:41.160]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:59:41.160 --> 1:59:42.800]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[2:00:05.880 --> 2:00:12.880]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers, well, so does
[2:00:12.880 --> 2:00:13.880]  he.
[2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:18.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:18.120 --> 2:00:24.080]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:32.680]  Now into hour number three, Ron Paul's chief campaign policy advisor, Bruce Fein, who's
[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:38.160]  going to be joining us, David Eich was getting into his new book, Remember Who You Are.
[2:00:38.160 --> 2:00:39.160]  For me, that's what I...
[2:00:39.160 --> 2:00:42.800]  It's like, wake up, you're in the universe, you're on a planet, you can feel how ancient
[2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:47.560]  everything is, you know you're part of something much bigger, you're not 38 years old.
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:52.960]  I mean, it's just inherent that our spirits are real, I know it, I don't think it.
[2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:57.200]  It's real, the elite know it, and they want to try to warp us, David Eich.
[2:00:57.200 --> 2:01:04.920]  Yes, they do, the whole idea, the whole foundation of the conspiracy to enslave humanity is to
[2:01:04.920 --> 2:01:09.720]  enslave us in merely, purely, five-sense reality.
[2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:13.120]  So everything is what the five senses perceive it to be.
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:19.160]  When that's just the vehicle, the way we interact with this reality, the real self is consciousness,
[2:01:19.160 --> 2:01:23.840]  infinite consciousness, like a droplet in an infinite ocean, and of course, when you
[2:01:23.840 --> 2:01:28.080]  put a droplet in an ocean, where's the droplet end and the ocean start?
[2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:33.680]  We are the great infinite field of consciousness.
[2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:38.080]  We're just a different point of attention within it, my point of attention is called David
[2:01:38.080 --> 2:01:44.080]  Eich, yours is called Alex Jones, but we're all one consciousness, and of course, when
[2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:50.240]  people start to understand that, and they realize we're all one, experiencing itself
[2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:57.720]  in different ways, then the ability to divide and rule us starts to fade, because the perception
[2:01:57.720 --> 2:02:03.080]  of apartness, the perception of something being apart from us, therefore, there can
[2:02:03.080 --> 2:02:08.120]  be a division between us, starts to fade, so they have to keep us, not only for that
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:13.120]  reason, but for others, like keeping us in ignorance, they have to keep us focused in
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:14.800]  five-sense reality.
[2:02:14.800 --> 2:02:20.800]  And it's a bit like symbolic of consciousness, me sitting at a computer with the keyboard
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:27.160]  and the mouse, and I am interacting with the internet, the collective reality, through
[2:02:27.160 --> 2:02:34.240]  a computer, and that's fine as long as I'm dictating to the computer where it goes and
[2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:37.920]  what it thinks about where it goes and all its perceptions.
[2:02:37.920 --> 2:02:44.560]  If you get to a point where the person at the keyboard and the mouse is disconnected
[2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:49.600]  from the computer or an influence of it, the computer is now deciding where it goes, and
[2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:55.760]  of course, a computer is programmable, it's programmed by its very nature, it's very limited
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:03:01.200]  in its ability to perceive and to process information, and that's what they've done,
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:06.600]  because the body is what I call body-mind, it's like a biological computer, it's the
[2:03:06.600 --> 2:03:12.120]  vehicle which allows us to lock into this narrow band of frequencies that we call the
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:17.360]  world and experience them and interact with them, that's fine, but when the body-computer
[2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:23.640]  mind becomes the governor and not the servant of consciousness, then you're in a situation
[2:03:23.640 --> 2:03:31.080]  where the few can control the many, just like it would be if the computer started deciding
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:33.600]  where it was going to go on the internet and what it thought of it.
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:38.280]  The perception of the computer with all its great limitations and ignorance compared with
[2:03:38.280 --> 2:03:44.640]  human consciousness would be much easier to control on mass than awake people who are
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:50.200]  conscious and can see between the lines and can see things that a computer program can't
[2:03:50.200 --> 2:03:51.200]  see.
[2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:54.680]  David, we're out of time, we're out of time, but you've graciously agreed to come back
[2:03:54.680 --> 2:03:59.600]  on the nightly news, we'll then air on the radio the next day, on or around the 20th,
[2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:04.240]  so we will expand and get into the book itself in that second interview, and I can't wait
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:05.640]  to read it.
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:08.440]  Thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[2:04:08.440 --> 2:04:09.440]  Pleasure, Alex.
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:10.440]  Thanks very much, mate.
[2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:12.440]  All right, and the fellows are going to talk to you just for a moment about that next
[2:04:12.440 --> 2:04:13.440]  booking on the show.
[2:04:13.440 --> 2:04:14.440]  God bless you, David.
[2:04:14.440 --> 2:04:15.440]  Thank you for coming on.
[2:04:15.440 --> 2:04:16.440]  Wow.
[2:04:16.440 --> 2:04:21.560]  Certainly gets you thinking, and he's a gentleman who I believe is pure of heart and really
[2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:24.760]  done a lot to get people thinking, and that's something that we're all very, very thankful
[2:04:24.760 --> 2:04:25.760]  for.
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:26.760]  DavidIke.com is his website.
[2:04:26.760 --> 2:04:27.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:04:27.760 --> 2:04:32.040]  The websites are infowars.com and prismplanet.tv.
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:35.600]  Don't forget we're running 15-day free trials right now at prismplanet.tv.
[2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:39.160]  Free for the nightly news that is listener supported, and then much of that ends up getting
[2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:44.080]  aired here for millions every day on the syndicated radio broadcast that we are now into the
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:45.240]  third hour on.
[2:04:45.240 --> 2:04:52.440]  Bruce Fine, who is Ron Paul campaign senior policy advisor, will be joining us on the campaign,
[2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:55.400]  the latest police state developments, all these wars coming up.
[2:04:55.400 --> 2:04:57.160]  It's all coming up after the quick break.
[2:04:57.160 --> 2:04:58.720]  Stay with us.
[2:04:58.720 --> 2:04:59.720]  More thing in Fall War.
[2:04:59.720 --> 2:05:00.720]  Straight ahead.
[2:05:00.720 --> 2:05:01.720]  Hi, folks.
[2:05:01.720 --> 2:05:02.720]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:05:02.720 --> 2:05:07.040]  And I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:05:07.040 --> 2:05:11.880]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[2:05:11.880 --> 2:05:15.880]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[2:05:15.880 --> 2:05:20.520]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[2:05:20.520 --> 2:05:25.760]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:32.640]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[2:05:32.640 --> 2:05:36.080]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[2:05:36.080 --> 2:05:41.680]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:05:41.680 --> 2:05:46.960]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[2:05:46.960 --> 2:05:53.200]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[2:05:53.200 --> 2:05:54.520]  Lungs Generator.
[2:05:54.520 --> 2:06:01.360]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[2:06:01.360 --> 2:06:05.400]  I had tried everything, I had cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting
[2:06:05.400 --> 2:06:08.040]  weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[2:06:08.040 --> 2:06:12.440]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[2:06:12.440 --> 2:06:18.240]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[2:06:18.240 --> 2:06:19.240]  and be satisfied.
[2:06:19.240 --> 2:06:23.720]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com, but I want to point out
[2:06:23.720 --> 2:06:31.320]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[2:06:31.320 --> 2:06:35.040]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound.
[2:06:35.040 --> 2:06:39.240]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[2:06:39.240 --> 2:06:41.680]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[2:06:41.680 --> 2:06:43.120]  Now that's results.
[2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:48.880]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfowarsTeam.com and to order just three of
[2:06:48.880 --> 2:06:49.880]  their products.
[2:06:49.880 --> 2:06:55.960]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite almost immediately.
[2:06:55.960 --> 2:06:59.760]  Start your journey to health and wellness today, InfowarsTeam.com.
[2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:02.240]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[2:07:02.240 --> 2:07:06.200]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[2:07:06.200 --> 2:07:07.840]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:11.880]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[2:07:11.880 --> 2:07:12.880]  or gold?
[2:07:12.880 --> 2:07:16.240]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[2:07:16.240 --> 2:07:18.440]  possible that could even happen again.
[2:07:18.440 --> 2:07:22.880]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[2:07:22.880 --> 2:07:23.880]  seeds.
[2:07:23.880 --> 2:07:28.640]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[2:07:28.640 --> 2:07:30.760]  dense food for you and your family.
[2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:31.880]  And here's the best part.
[2:07:31.880 --> 2:07:36.080]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[2:07:36.080 --> 2:07:38.560]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[2:07:38.560 --> 2:07:41.800]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[2:07:41.800 --> 2:07:48.640]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[2:07:48.640 --> 2:07:53.120]  That's 877-327-0365.
[2:07:53.120 --> 2:07:57.640]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[2:07:57.640 --> 2:08:01.320]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:04.480]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[2:08:04.480 --> 2:08:12.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:12.640 --> 2:08:22.920]  Okay, we are now eight minutes into the final hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[2:08:22.920 --> 2:08:29.080]  Of course, I'll also be back this evening, 7 o'clock, with the Infowars Nightly News.
[2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:33.400]  Coming up the next few days, I'm going to be able to air the big hour and a half interview
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:37.800]  I did, taped with Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, politics, Metallica, everything.
[2:08:37.800 --> 2:08:41.440]  He talked about stuff he's never talked about before, and he hadn't done an interview in
[2:08:41.440 --> 2:08:46.360]  a while in a few weeks because they took it out of context that he was endorsing Santorum.
[2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:51.320]  He put a press release out saying, that's not what I did, and wanted it retracted, and
[2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:52.760]  they never really did that.
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:54.440]  So he also talked about that in the interview.
[2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:55.960]  He says he likes Ron Paul.
[2:08:55.960 --> 2:09:01.880]  He just doesn't fully get the foreign policy, and some of the media did things like imply
[2:09:01.880 --> 2:09:07.120]  that, well, Ron Paul says we're like the Taliban, so people really get concerned about the military
[2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:08.120]  situation.
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:11.280]  I want to raise that first with Bruce Fein, who we're very thankful for joining us in
[2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:17.480]  his busy schedule, Senior Policy Advisor Ron Paul, 2012 campaign, of course, to go over
[2:09:17.480 --> 2:09:21.760]  his bio, would take a while, but it's important to.
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:26.120]  Bruce Fein specializes in Constitutional International Law, he's a frequent witness
[2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:28.960]  before Congress and is a regular guest on national television radio.
[2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:34.120]  He is chairman of the American Freedom Agenda, founder of Bruce Fein and Associates, Inc.,
[2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:38.520]  and the Lynchfield Group, author of Constitutional Peril, the Life and Death Struggle of our
[2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:42.480]  Constitution, and Democracy, a weekly columnist for the Washington Times.
[2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:46.720]  Mr. Fein graduated with honors from Harvard Law School in 1972, clerked for the prestigious
[2:09:46.720 --> 2:09:51.800]  federal court, served as special assistant to the Assistant Attorney General for the
[2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:55.720]  Office of Legal Counsel and the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, was involved
[2:09:55.720 --> 2:09:59.600]  in some big antitrust cases, Assistant Director of the Office of Legal Policy, Associate Deputy
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:03.360]  Attorney General, General Counsel of the Federal Communications Commission, counsel of the
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:09.080]  Joint Congressional Committee on Covered Arm Sales to Iran, visiting fellow for Constitutional
[2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:12.920]  Studies for the Heritage Foundation, adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute
[2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:17.840]  and guest lecturer at the Brookings Institute to name just a few, but he's Ron Paul's chief
[2:10:17.840 --> 2:10:19.880]  policy advisor that tells you a lot.
[2:10:19.880 --> 2:10:25.120]  The campaign is going great, he won some states clearly, Iowa and Maine, and there was fraud
[2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:29.280]  there, and now they're trying the same old tricks, but he's winning by injecting real
[2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:31.200]  issues.
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:34.920]  But continuing with the foreign policy, I see the former Heather Mossad saying don't
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:39.440]  attack Iran, I see most of the generals, the last two Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman
[2:10:39.440 --> 2:10:44.240]  say don't do it, but then when Ron Paul goes with even what the CIA is saying about this
[2:10:44.240 --> 2:10:47.160]  isn't a good idea, he's the bad guy.
[2:10:47.160 --> 2:10:54.360]  So how is the minority view, the majority view with Romney and Santorum and Gennrich,
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:59.480]  and then how is Ron Paul bad Bruce, because he's actually a scholar and informed, perhaps
[2:10:59.480 --> 2:11:02.280]  you can tell us why you think that's the case.
[2:11:02.280 --> 2:11:07.880]  Well, it's my book American Empire Before the Fall, it's recently published by Campaign
[2:11:07.880 --> 2:11:12.840]  for Liberty, which describes what I styled the psychology of empire.
[2:11:12.840 --> 2:11:17.160]  Even if it's a minority view and the majority of Americans are not out on the streets marching
[2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:23.120]  to say invade Iran, we can't tolerate a nuclear capable Iran even though we can, a nuclear
[2:11:23.120 --> 2:11:28.400]  capable Pakistan, a nuclear armed India or North Korea.
[2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:35.280]  But it is the psychology of empire that sort of pervaded our elite, if you will, and Ron
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:40.120]  Paul you correctly identify as someone who's expressing the majority viewpoint.
[2:11:40.120 --> 2:11:45.560]  And I want to underscore this total media misrepresentation of Ron Paul's stance on
[2:11:45.560 --> 2:11:47.000]  foreign policy.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:53.240]  When it comes to being a hawk on defending Americans on American soil, Ron Paul is the
[2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:54.720]  biggest hawk of all.
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:11:59.320]  He doesn't believe, however, that we should be squandering our defense resources on defending
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:01.920]  other countries or other peoples.
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:05.040]  That's for humanitarians or there are other countries to do.
[2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:10.280]  And we're spending trillions of dollars in wasting lives and limb of Americans for other
[2:12:10.280 --> 2:12:15.200]  peoples' liberty, even assuming that our motives are altruistic.
[2:12:15.200 --> 2:12:17.520]  And take, for example, the situation in Iran.
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:21.120]  Remember, probably Alex, you and I lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:23.400]  We know nuclear deterrence works.
[2:12:23.400 --> 2:12:28.000]  We know it doesn't matter how power hungry you are, no country has ever craved nuclear
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  incineration.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.320]  And we could totally and we should threaten any country who would attack us with nuclear
[2:12:33.320 --> 2:12:38.200]  weapons or non-nuclear weapons with incineration if they're going to be the aggressor.
[2:12:38.200 --> 2:12:41.120]  And that kind of threat and deterrent works.
[2:12:41.120 --> 2:12:44.160]  It's worked every single year throughout the Cold War.
[2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:49.240]  There's no indication that somehow, for the first time in 4,000 years, Iranian rulers
[2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:50.240]  covered.
[2:12:50.240 --> 2:12:52.740]  They covet destruction.
[2:12:52.740 --> 2:12:56.280]  If they wanted that, they could jump into the Tigris and Euphrates tomorrow and drown
[2:12:56.280 --> 2:12:59.680]  themselves to visit their alleged 77 virgins in heaven.
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:05.800]  Well, haven't the Iranians shown the opposite, extremely wily, extremely cunning?
[2:13:05.800 --> 2:13:07.080]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:13.320]  They display all the earmarks of real politic, including negotiating an end to the Iran-Iraq
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:14.320]  war.
[2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:15.960]  They didn't choose armageddon.
[2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:22.680]  When we shot down the USS Vincennes, we shot down an airliner over the Persian Gulf, killed
[2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:23.680]  almost 300.
[2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:27.040]  And then there was a negotiations for reparations.
[2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:31.480]  The Iranians didn't say, aha, now we're going to launch a nuclear attack on the United States,
[2:13:31.480 --> 2:13:37.040]  even if it could be done, given the problem of delivery vehicles going that far.
[2:13:37.040 --> 2:13:39.640]  And then it said, well, but they might attack Israel.
[2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:41.800]  Yeah, that's Israel's problem, not ours.
[2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:43.760]  And we should authorize it.
[2:13:43.760 --> 2:13:46.760]  Israel's got to do every country as a right of self-preservation.
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:52.160]  Ron Paul has said Israel has 400 nuclear weapons, high-tech system.
[2:13:52.160 --> 2:13:55.760]  I mean, Iran would commit suicide if they did that.
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:00.560]  Absolutely, and they've never tried to do anything like that before.
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:02.880]  The Iranians are not in Jerusalem.
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:07.200]  The Iranians are not in Tel Aviv.
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:08.720]  The Iranians are not stupid.
[2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:13.120]  And historically as well, Alex, Iran has not been hostile to Israel.
[2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:18.640]  If you think about its birth, 1948, the only country in the Middle East that did not declare
[2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:21.920]  war on Israel was Iran.
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:28.880]  So there isn't any kind of megalomaniac and messianic fanaticism about destroying Israel.
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:33.160]  And there's no reason why Israel's deterrent wouldn't work just like ours.
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:37.880]  They clearly have a more formidable nuclear arsenal that you've identified.
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:43.480]  And why would Iran and its leaders who covet the exercise of power do something that would
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:45.400]  invite destruction?
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:50.160]  Even the North Koreans, they're probably even crazier than the Iranians with regard
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:55.640]  to their fanatical control on their population, have not launched nuclear weapons against
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:56.640]  any other country.
[2:14:56.640 --> 2:14:58.880]  And they say, deterrence works.
[2:14:58.880 --> 2:15:03.480]  And moreover, if deterrence is cast aside, Alex, there's no stopping point.
[2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:07.360]  Then we could go into any country in the world and say, we're bombing you because we don't
[2:15:07.360 --> 2:15:10.040]  think that you ought to have a nuclear capability at some time.
[2:15:10.040 --> 2:15:13.800]  Well, there you go, Professor, constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein.
[2:15:13.800 --> 2:15:15.800]  That's exactly what they say in the NDAA.
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:19.160]  Break that down, because first Obama says he's not going to sign it.
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:21.000]  Then we learn he demanded it.
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:22.400]  Then he does sign it.
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:25.400]  And now he comes out and says, don't worry, I won't use it.
[2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:30.280]  But suddenly the Attorney General says, but I will kill citizens overseas and, well, maybe
[2:15:30.280 --> 2:15:31.640]  we'll secret arrest people.
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:35.960]  So it's the classic tactic of advancing when there's pressure retreating.
[2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:40.720]  And then as soon as the dust settles, advancing and then launching the war in Libya without
[2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:41.720]  congressional approval.
[2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:43.720]  I mean, it is really scary.
[2:15:43.720 --> 2:15:44.960]  It is.
[2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:46.960]  And think where we've gone from Libya.
[2:15:46.960 --> 2:15:53.000]  The discussion right now on attacking Iran, it's all assumed, contrary to the Constitution,
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:54.640]  that the president alone will decide.
[2:15:54.640 --> 2:15:56.440]  You know, he's talking to APEC.
[2:15:56.440 --> 2:16:01.320]  He'd make these speeches saying, well, I will decide it's not going to be a containment,
[2:16:01.320 --> 2:16:03.080]  it's going to be something else.
[2:16:03.080 --> 2:16:04.080]  Really?
[2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:06.520]  The Constitution says Congress makes that decision.
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:09.680]  And so he usurps the power of Congress without blinking an eye.
[2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:13.240]  And what's equally stunning, Alex, is Congress there accepts it.
[2:16:13.240 --> 2:16:18.440]  And there's no articles of impeachment saying, no, the most important power we exercise is
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:22.320]  the decision to whether to go to war or not, whether we're going to have our men and women
[2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:26.240]  risk that last full measure of devotion for somebody else's liberty.
[2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:30.160]  And the president usurps the power and Congress doesn't even honor a peep.
[2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:31.160]  It's truly stunning.
[2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:37.360]  You know, I lived and worked through the Nixon impeachment hearings in 1973 and 74.
[2:16:37.360 --> 2:16:42.960]  And what he did is almost a tea party compared to the sacrilege of the Constitution that
[2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:48.000]  this goes on daily right now in the White House.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:57.400]  So how do we break the hoax, Bruce, that Ron Paul is a strange bird when it comes to defense
[2:16:57.400 --> 2:17:03.160]  of this country when, as you just stated, I mean, look, most of the Israeli experts,
[2:17:03.160 --> 2:17:04.160]  that's not a secret.
[2:17:04.160 --> 2:17:08.040]  In the Israeli press, they admit most of their military saying, don't attack Iran because
[2:17:08.040 --> 2:17:10.480]  it'll make Israel look like the bad guy.
[2:17:10.480 --> 2:17:12.560]  Israel will be attacked on all sides.
[2:17:12.560 --> 2:17:13.560]  All prices will explode.
[2:17:13.560 --> 2:17:19.160]  You've already got 400,000 Israelis out a few months ago protesting their economy.
[2:17:19.160 --> 2:17:24.720]  I mean, why do you think Netanyahu and others are creeping towards it?
[2:17:24.720 --> 2:17:30.640]  Well, the Israel in some sense, Alex, is a microcosm of our own empire psychology.
[2:17:30.640 --> 2:17:35.240]  And it's something that's not flattering about human nature, but there are mentalities that
[2:17:35.240 --> 2:17:36.240]  get a thrill.
[2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:39.520]  They get sort of gratified out of being the bully on the playground.
[2:17:39.520 --> 2:17:44.280]  And even when you have the highest levels of massage saying Iran is not an existential
[2:17:44.280 --> 2:17:49.600]  threat to Israel, Israel sort of feels, well, this is our manhood, if you will, we're not
[2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:54.080]  going to permit the Holocaust again until everybody gets their adrenaline pumping.
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:59.480]  And it's a very juvenile and infantile attitude to have when the people's lives are at stake
[2:17:59.480 --> 2:18:01.160]  in huge numbers.
[2:18:01.160 --> 2:18:03.720]  And that's, I think, what we're witnessing in Israel.
[2:18:03.720 --> 2:18:09.320]  It's like every time you get an entity with unchecked power, it then becomes arrogant
[2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:17.400]  and then kind of adolescent thrill, over-asserting its power and being a bully there.
[2:18:17.400 --> 2:18:21.280]  But it sounds simplistic, but in fact, that's what's going on.
[2:18:21.280 --> 2:18:26.760]  I mean, nobody in your audience, Alex, has ever woken up and worried that Iran was going
[2:18:26.760 --> 2:18:29.280]  to have a nuclear weapon come down on their city.
[2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:35.120]  I mean, in fact, no one in their daily life makes any decision based on a fear that Iran
[2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:38.000]  will use nuclear weapons against the United States.
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:41.840]  And yet here we are as a country suggesting, my gosh, it's just around the corner and we
[2:18:41.840 --> 2:18:47.320]  got a bomb and another $100 billion and risk all the wrath of the Middle East in order
[2:18:47.320 --> 2:18:50.040]  to prevent a nuclear capability from arising in Iran.
[2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:55.120]  But that's what like 95% literally, because I read the papers constantly, almost all the
[2:18:55.120 --> 2:18:58.400]  experts say almost no threat from Iran.
[2:18:58.400 --> 2:19:02.080]  But if you attack them, then Israel really is going to be in trouble.
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:07.280]  Yeah, of course they will, because it's natural to seek retaliation when you're brutalized
[2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:08.440]  by an aggressor.
[2:19:08.440 --> 2:19:10.120]  We do the same thing.
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:16.320]  And that's what to me seems so astonishing is this idea that human nature is different
[2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:18.160]  in Iran than in the United States.
[2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:23.000]  And they'll just accept our attack and then surrender and say, OK, you tell us how you
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:26.400]  want us to reconstruct our government, we'll abandon nuclear weapons.
[2:19:26.400 --> 2:19:30.120]  I mean, that's truly living in fantasy land, utter fantasy land.
[2:19:30.120 --> 2:19:34.600]  The same thing we're doing in Afghanistan and we're trying to do in Vietnam as well.
[2:19:34.600 --> 2:19:39.960]  And this is where I think we've totally lost our way in the world as a republic.
[2:19:39.960 --> 2:19:44.760]  We got to remember we are totally entitled to defend ourselves and to incinerate anybody
[2:19:44.760 --> 2:19:45.760]  who attacks.
[2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:51.600]  But hey, United States, blessings of liberty are about blessings of liberty for Americans.
[2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:56.120]  And we like our example to influence events abroad, but we fight only to protect them.
[2:19:56.120 --> 2:19:57.120]  Stay there.
[2:19:57.120 --> 2:19:59.880]  We're going to come right back and get into the campaign itself and how you're advising
[2:19:59.880 --> 2:20:00.880]  Ron Paul.
[2:20:00.880 --> 2:20:01.880]  Stay with us.
[2:20:01.880 --> 2:20:02.880]  We'll be back.
[2:20:02.880 --> 2:20:07.360]  In June, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal
[2:20:07.360 --> 2:20:08.760]  that I was still starving.
[2:20:08.760 --> 2:20:13.560]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[2:20:13.560 --> 2:20:17.680]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[2:20:17.680 --> 2:20:23.200]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[2:20:23.200 --> 2:20:26.360]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[2:20:26.360 --> 2:20:32.600]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity,
[2:20:32.600 --> 2:20:36.720]  the young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.
[2:20:36.720 --> 2:20:40.520]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[2:20:40.520 --> 2:20:46.840]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[2:20:46.840 --> 2:20:48.280]  Check it out for yourself.
[2:20:48.280 --> 2:20:49.280]  It's incredible.

[2:20:55.120 --> 2:21:01.920]  multivitamin mineral complex dietary supplement that's infowarsteam.com.
[2:21:01.920 --> 2:21:02.920]  Gold isn't for you.
[2:21:02.920 --> 2:21:06.920]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious
[2:21:06.920 --> 2:21:08.240]  metal investing firms.
[2:21:08.240 --> 2:21:09.240]  I get it.
[2:21:09.240 --> 2:21:12.880]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that
[2:21:12.880 --> 2:21:17.320]  the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security
[2:21:17.320 --> 2:21:18.680]  would be there for you.
[2:21:18.680 --> 2:21:19.920]  That's not what's happening.
[2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:24.480]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[2:21:24.480 --> 2:21:26.320]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:28.360]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[2:21:28.360 --> 2:21:31.840]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[2:21:31.840 --> 2:21:36.160]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.

[2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:24.160]  his latest book, in fact we'll put it on the screen right now, American Empire Before
[2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:28.440]  the Fall, and I want to talk to Bruce before he leaves us about what he sees that fall
[2:24:28.440 --> 2:24:29.440]  looking like.
[2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:35.840]  Now if you've got questions for the chief policy advisor for Ron Paul, so we can get
[2:24:35.840 --> 2:24:40.440]  to four or five calls at least, please just have a quick question or comment, we'll go
[2:24:40.440 --> 2:24:44.040]  to your calls here in about 10, 15 minutes because we do have him for most of the hour.
[2:24:44.040 --> 2:24:49.440]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231.
[2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:56.680]  Okay Bruce, you're there, you're helping the campaign, advising, which really shows how
[2:24:56.680 --> 2:25:02.600]  much Ron Paul respects you, where do you see the campaign going right now?
[2:25:02.600 --> 2:25:08.120]  Well I think the effort is to assemble as large a delegate count as we can, keep the
[2:25:08.120 --> 2:25:14.000]  message pure and straight, you'll notice that he was the only one who didn't use euphemisms
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:19.600]  to describe the, I think the rather harsh language Russ Limba used to sort of debase
[2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:24.040]  political debate, and Ron is out there for the message.
[2:25:24.040 --> 2:25:30.440]  He's not out there as a megalomaniac, egomaniac just trying to build a brand that he can then
[2:25:30.440 --> 2:25:36.760]  capitalize on making speeches, and so I think he's working at the caucus level and with
[2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:42.160]  the contributions making clear that he's in this all the way through August, so it may
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:49.880]  well be that at that time he would have the delegate number that could be used as bargaining
[2:25:49.880 --> 2:25:54.000]  to push the other nominees over the top with a majority.
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:59.400]  I think Alex, there's a substantial likelihood that none of the four remaining contenders
[2:25:59.400 --> 2:26:06.960]  will arrive in Tampa in August with a majority of delegates because the majority of states
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:13.280]  are not winner-take-all states but proportional representation, so there's a substantial splintering
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:18.080]  of the delegates in all of these primaries, and that's why even today, you know Romney
[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:23.040]  at the head of the pack has got less than 200 delegates, and that's towards a total
[2:26:23.040 --> 2:26:32.240]  of 1,000, I think 1,144 needed for a majority, so he's less than 10% of the way there, and
[2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:41.760]  Ron, I think, is very, very scrupulous, indy-fatigable in campaigning in some of the smaller states
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:44.720]  where the caucus there will be important and delegate-
[2:26:44.720 --> 2:26:50.000]  In fact, he's set right now, they don't steal it again, all the polls show, to win Idaho.
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:55.560]  Undoubtedly, he won Maine, and they've admitted all the counties where he was winning big,
[2:26:55.560 --> 2:26:56.560]  but he didn't count them.
[2:26:56.560 --> 2:26:59.960]  There was clearly a lot of chicanery going on in Iowa, and people say, well then why
[2:26:59.960 --> 2:27:01.360]  get behind him if it's fraud?
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:05.700]  Well, we show there's fraud by him running, and we have Ron Paul there injecting real
[2:27:05.700 --> 2:27:09.200]  ideas, but if they cheated him on the time of the debates, if they've done all these
[2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:13.760]  other dirty tricks, I mean, I, what's your view, I mean, I know it's kind of looking
[2:27:13.760 --> 2:27:18.960]  backwards and it can be seen as being, you know, a spoiled sport, but I mean, when the
[2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:21.480]  referees are cheating, you've got to call it.
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:26.680]  Well, absolutely you've got to call it, but I think even the cheating has only, has not
[2:27:26.680 --> 2:27:31.400]  really diminished substantially Ron's ability to get his message through Alex, and I think
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:36.480]  that shows that when you put him head to head with Obama, and then are polling the entire
[2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:42.680]  electorate, not just the Republican electorate, you find Ron scoring better than Santor.
[2:27:42.680 --> 2:27:47.480]  Well, better than Romney in a lot of them, and many of the polls I've seen Ron Paul,
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:53.680]  but you look at Gallup, you name it, Rasmussen, he, I mean, I know you know this Bruce, but
[2:27:53.680 --> 2:27:57.880]  he, he, he beats Obama with, with better numbers than Romney.
[2:27:57.880 --> 2:28:03.320]  Yeah, absolutely, because he appeals to independence, and I think that's what's very rewarding about
[2:28:03.320 --> 2:28:09.240]  the campaign, that he is changing, you know, the political orthodoxies of the culture more
[2:28:09.240 --> 2:28:15.080]  towards liberty and away from empire and ever, ever increasing the, the size and intrusiveness
[2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:21.480]  of government, and it appeals across the board and, and the, and the fact that you have Republicans
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:26.760]  who are at least one slice of the electorate, you know, galvanizing around other candidates
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:32.920]  who I call them Tweedledum, Tweedledees to Obama, suggests that that's not representative
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:38.200]  of the country as a whole, and, and Ron cares more about the future of the country than any
[2:28:38.200 --> 2:28:40.780]  particular party, if you will.
[2:28:40.780 --> 2:28:44.560]  And I think that's what makes him a great American, you know, because real high-level
[2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:49.880]  politics is trying to make everybody, every American a winner, it's not a football game,
[2:28:49.880 --> 2:28:54.760]  you know, a winner, a loser, zero sum, you've got one group of citizens getting gratified
[2:28:54.760 --> 2:28:56.640]  off of depressing another group.
[2:28:56.640 --> 2:29:01.800]  Hey, we're all hanged together, we're all Americans first, so let's make everybody gain,
[2:29:01.800 --> 2:29:06.960]  and that's how we can make us a great civilization and honor the ideals of the founding fathers.
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:10.000]  You're right, another hoax, we're gonna go to break the long segment, come back and get
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:15.160]  into your book, and more on Ron Paul and what you see happening, but another big issue
[2:29:15.160 --> 2:29:21.680]  is he gets the majority, in some case over 70% of the Republican candidates that are
[2:29:21.680 --> 2:29:25.440]  getting donations from the military, he gets the majority of those, but there's this hoax
[2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:29.680]  that, oh, Ron Paul didn't like the military, he's one of the only people up there that
[2:29:29.680 --> 2:29:34.480]  isn't a chicken hawk and actually has served, and, well, I mean, my audience knows that,
[2:29:34.480 --> 2:29:37.640]  you know that, but I'm gonna get your take on that briefly, but I just wanna ask you
[2:29:37.640 --> 2:29:42.840]  that question on the other side, and then I wanna get into more of the attacks on the
[2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:46.960]  Bill of Rights of Constitution, and where you see this empire going, what the collapse
[2:29:46.960 --> 2:29:50.840]  will look like straight ahead with Bruce Fine, we'll be back.
[2:29:50.840 --> 2:29:58.440]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:22.200]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[2:32:00.840 --> 2:32:05.920]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[2:32:05.920 --> 2:32:08.200]  good sized meal that I was still starving.
[2:32:08.200 --> 2:32:13.040]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[2:32:13.040 --> 2:32:17.200]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[2:32:17.200 --> 2:32:22.760]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[2:32:22.760 --> 2:32:25.960]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[2:32:25.960 --> 2:32:32.240]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:36.600]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once
[2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:40.240]  you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[2:33:14.280 --> 2:33:18.040]  My friends, if you want to understand how the crony capital is to an anti-free market
[2:33:18.040 --> 2:33:24.720]  and how they're using government to shut down their competition and what Agenda 21 is,
[2:33:24.720 --> 2:33:29.360]  what the whole new order system is, get my films, The Obama Deception, and of course
[2:33:29.360 --> 2:33:35.440]  Fall of the Republic, we also carry a behind the green mask, Agenda 21, excellent book
[2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:39.840]  on the subject that's key for county and city and state leaders.
[2:33:39.840 --> 2:33:43.560]  It's all available at infowarseteam.com.
[2:33:43.560 --> 2:33:47.200]  Don't ever think just because you're informed to know about all this, that your friends,
[2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:53.280]  your family, your neighbors don't, and I know I'm stating the obvious here, but it's so
[2:33:53.280 --> 2:33:59.880]  important to speak out individually right now for this country and for a great champion
[2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:03.440]  of liberty like Ron Paul, because resistance is victory.
[2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:06.960]  Ron Paul didn't get a lot of traction four years ago, but he helped grow a big nationwide
[2:34:06.960 --> 2:34:07.960]  movement.
[2:34:07.960 --> 2:34:12.160]  He's probably gotten 10 times the traction this time around, and the ideas, no matter
[2:34:12.160 --> 2:34:19.040]  where this campaign goes, will continue to move forward and grow exponentially.
[2:34:19.040 --> 2:34:24.360]  And so look at the whole liberty movement around the focal point, Ron Paul, as almost
[2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:30.520]  like the flashpoint where it starts, one of the key matrix lines that will help shatter
[2:34:30.520 --> 2:34:33.920]  this status-centralized system.
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:42.760]  Now Bruce, I wanted to talk about your book and how the empire is clearly flailing around
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:45.960]  trying to expand just so it doesn't collapse, I guess, fling forward.
[2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:54.480]  But when I see a federal court, circuit court, what is it, the seventh ruling, yeah, police
[2:34:54.480 --> 2:34:58.360]  can just pull you over or come in your house without a warrant and download the contents
[2:34:58.360 --> 2:34:59.360]  of your cell phone.
[2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:02.560]  And now police in Michigan and other states pull you over for speeding, take your phone,
[2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:03.560]  download it.
[2:35:03.560 --> 2:35:10.600]  Photos, numbers, everything, surfing habits, drones in the sky, predator drones being used
[2:35:10.600 --> 2:35:18.200]  against cattle wrestlers, checkpoints, state police gunboats on the rivers, TSA now popping
[2:35:18.200 --> 2:35:25.600]  up in Dallas, groping people at the train stations and on the highways, I mean, America
[2:35:25.600 --> 2:35:32.440]  has been so free for so long and there's obviously been problems, but now I don't know if we're
[2:35:32.440 --> 2:35:37.800]  just ready to deal with something this overt, it's so over the top and people are starting
[2:35:37.800 --> 2:35:42.600]  to wake up, but I wonder, is it fast enough and you've been in Washington, you advise
[2:35:42.600 --> 2:35:44.600]  Congress, you're around these people.
[2:35:44.600 --> 2:35:48.720]  I mean, it's just so absurdist and cartoon level is what I'm trying to get at.
[2:35:48.720 --> 2:35:55.120]  I don't have words to describe how classically tyrannical and crony, you were mentioning
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:36:01.120]  elite groups giving their buddies money and no bid contracts and energy firm deals.
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:03.160]  I mean, it's just so obvious.
[2:36:03.160 --> 2:36:04.640]  How far will this go?
[2:36:04.640 --> 2:36:10.880]  Well, the problem we have is the empire mentality at least instinctively covets what I call
[2:36:10.880 --> 2:36:17.200]  a risk-free existence and so every conceivable encroachment on liberty is accepted if you
[2:36:17.200 --> 2:36:22.200]  think it might address a problem that might arise as frequently as a meteor and asteroid
[2:36:22.200 --> 2:36:27.160]  hitting the United States, which is virtually never and it's not just those incidents that
[2:36:27.160 --> 2:36:32.080]  you've described more overtly, but the United States government now claims right without
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:37.640]  a warrant to seize all of our internet or electronic signatures, all of our footprints
[2:36:37.640 --> 2:36:38.640]  there.
[2:36:38.640 --> 2:36:42.960]  You know, the Google, the Yahoo, every place they say that if you expose any information
[2:36:42.960 --> 2:36:48.120]  about yourself to a third party, which is impossible to prevent when you're on the internet,
[2:36:48.120 --> 2:36:53.320]  the government can come grab it and build a dossier against you and now the FBI for
[2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:57.280]  the first time in history Alex does what they style assessments.
[2:36:57.280 --> 2:37:02.120]  Ordinarily, they only begin to investigate some and if there's some articulable suspicion
[2:37:02.120 --> 2:37:03.800]  of complicity and crime.
[2:37:03.800 --> 2:37:08.280]  Now assessments begin if an agent believes that maybe sometimes in the future you may
[2:37:08.280 --> 2:37:13.680]  turn and do something bad even though there's no evidence that you have any, you create
[2:37:13.680 --> 2:37:17.200]  any danger to society or to-
[2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:18.200]  Pre-crime.
[2:37:18.200 --> 2:37:19.200]  Terrorists, yeah.
[2:37:19.200 --> 2:37:23.880]  And so they do assessments and you're supposed to love it because it clears you of the suspicion
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:28.320]  that you're a traitor or you're a terrorist so that now we have the government acting
[2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:32.880]  on the assumption that we're all guilty until they prove us innocent, which turns the whole
[2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:37.040]  idea of our republic and our unalienable rights on its head.
[2:37:37.040 --> 2:37:38.040]  We're free.
[2:37:38.040 --> 2:37:41.960]  Liberty is the rule until the government shows that we've done something wrong.
[2:37:41.960 --> 2:37:45.160]  And that's just one example of where we are.
[2:37:45.160 --> 2:37:49.600]  And to show how absurd this has become, if we look at this last statute that you referred
[2:37:49.600 --> 2:37:54.960]  to, the National Defense Authorization Actor, NDAA, here was a situation, Alex, where not
[2:37:54.960 --> 2:38:00.280]  a single person in the entire United States was clamoring to endow the president with
[2:38:00.280 --> 2:38:06.080]  more power to send the military to our doorsteps and take off off to Guantanamo Bay based upon
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:11.360]  secret facts and secret evidence that suggest that we're somehow aiding terrorism.
[2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:17.160]  Nobody was clamoring for it and yet Congress, unilaterally, with the assistance of the president,
[2:38:17.160 --> 2:38:22.640]  showed its power that King George III never possessed when we overthrew him in 1776.
[2:38:22.640 --> 2:38:27.160]  And again, it's this instinct of craving when you're a superpower to try to think you can
[2:38:27.160 --> 2:38:31.960]  make life risk-free, but you can't unless you're willing to destroy all of liberty.
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:36.600]  I mean, nobody can guarantee to 100% certainty that they're a saint and they'll never do
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:37.600]  anything bad.
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:42.600]  And if you're trying to create life that's risk-free, you'll lock up everybody and everything.
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:46.640]  And to somebody now who's involved in the safety endeavor, it's a little bit like two
[2:38:46.640 --> 2:38:50.160]  as a, to a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
[2:38:50.160 --> 2:38:54.800]  To somebody at the TSA or involved in the security, everybody looks like a traitor.
[2:38:54.800 --> 2:38:56.800]  And that's not what a republic is about.
[2:38:56.800 --> 2:38:57.800]  Well, that's what it is.
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:39:04.280]  As you said, it's making us all guilty until proven innocent instead of innocent until
[2:39:04.280 --> 2:39:05.960]  proven guilty.
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:11.400]  They had the kite flying event here in Austin over the weekend.
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:13.600]  It's the biggest in the country, kite festival.
[2:39:13.600 --> 2:39:21.240]  They had the National Guard out there searching people and just randomly now, I can't even
[2:39:21.240 --> 2:39:25.200]  go to the park now without seeing soldiers and it's just asinine.
[2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:28.080]  It's all about a total culture of paranoia.
[2:39:28.080 --> 2:39:30.000]  You're, you're exactly right, Alex.
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:37.120]  And what's the track record of these situations, zero, zero detentions, zero identification
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:38.120]  of terrorists.
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:41.760]  You know, look at how many times does the TSA search, groped and everything else, us
[2:39:41.760 --> 2:39:46.360]  taking pictures, how many terrorists have those machines and searches uncovered?
[2:39:46.360 --> 2:39:47.360]  Zero.
[2:39:47.360 --> 2:39:48.360]  Absolutely zero.
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:51.680]  You go on Amtrak here and watching and there is no searches whatsoever.
[2:39:51.680 --> 2:39:55.200]  There have been no incidents before or since 9-11.
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:58.440]  And it's not that it's conceivable that something bad could happen.
[2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:01.680]  You could get a Timothy McVeigh, but we have homicides too.
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:05.080]  You know, we had 14, 15, 16,000 homicides a year.
[2:40:05.080 --> 2:40:08.120]  We don't revel in it, but that's a price that we take if we're not.
[2:40:08.120 --> 2:40:10.800]  Well, what about this as a constitutional lawyer?
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:12.000]  What about this as a constitutional lawyer?
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:16.840]  Because I get emails saying, okay, you're saying they haven't stopped one terror attack.
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:18.440]  That's because they are there.
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:19.440]  There haven't been terror attacks.
[2:40:19.440 --> 2:40:25.560]  Well, by that idea, then you've got to put TSA in every cornfield because there might
[2:40:25.560 --> 2:40:27.280]  hypothetically be an attack there.
[2:40:27.280 --> 2:40:30.800]  I mean, this is nothing but a pretext to totally power grab.
[2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:31.800]  Exactly right.
[2:40:31.800 --> 2:40:36.400]  And they say, well, have these really been the indispensable barriers to another terrorist
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:37.400]  attack?
[2:40:37.400 --> 2:40:40.000]  If they were, how come there haven't been any terrorist attack on Amtrak?
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:44.080]  And well, there's no searches whatsoever when you go on the train.
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:48.720]  And moreover, if you just, and this is where I think the politicians and President Obama
[2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:51.520]  is especially, you know, subject to criticism.
[2:40:51.520 --> 2:40:54.800]  If they would just stop the darn thing for a month and then they'd see there are no
[2:40:54.800 --> 2:40:59.160]  terrorist acts, then you'd show that this is the chicken little saying the sky is falling
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:00.160]  down.
[2:41:00.160 --> 2:41:03.600]  Well, then really wasn't all those checks, you know, that was deterring it because it
[2:41:03.600 --> 2:41:06.240]  wasn't any threat there in the first instance.
[2:41:06.240 --> 2:41:07.560]  Americans love their government.
[2:41:07.560 --> 2:41:08.560]  They're patriotic.
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:09.560]  They're loyal.
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:13.280]  They don't want to blow up people just like Americans generally don't commit homicide.
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:18.440]  It doesn't mean that there can't be an exception, but the price of liberty is to take some risk
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:20.680]  and it's going to result in some tragedy.
[2:41:20.680 --> 2:41:26.000]  But the greater tragedy is to reduce all Americans to vassals and lords of some big brother government
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:28.080]  and destroy the whole purpose of government.
[2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:33.920]  Well, I was about to say, I mean, as you know, common sense history, but the founders, George
[2:41:33.920 --> 2:41:40.240]  Washington said governments like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
[2:41:40.240 --> 2:41:41.960]  demo side governments.
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:44.560]  There's big university reports on this.
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:50.840]  They debate the numbers, but it's between 262 million and 311 million people murdered
[2:41:50.840 --> 2:41:52.760]  non military combatants.
[2:41:52.760 --> 2:41:58.920]  But we're talking 200 plus million conservatively people killed the 20th century by government.
[2:41:58.920 --> 2:42:03.120]  Well, that's common sense to somebody who knows the Americana system.
[2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:07.040]  But for those that love the status system, I mean, if you want to have prior constraint
[2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:11.200]  because somebody might do something, one group we got to watch.
[2:42:11.200 --> 2:42:15.520]  And that is always the number one suspect, as our founders said, is government.
[2:42:15.520 --> 2:42:17.360]  Yeah, that's absolutely right, Alex.
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:22.280]  You hit the nail on the head when you try to examine what is the greatest source of
[2:42:22.280 --> 2:42:24.920]  evil in the history of the world?
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:29.280]  Government is greater than individuals by a factor of a million to one.
[2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:34.920]  You know, you can have people who commit it as homicide, even attempt to engage in organized
[2:42:34.920 --> 2:42:42.280]  criminal activity, but with regard to the massive, unbelievable size of the massacres
[2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:47.840]  and the atrocities, government is capable and does historically inflict vastly greater
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:52.120]  mayhem than any individual or group of individuals can ever do.
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:55.120]  And that explains the numbers that you've identified.
[2:42:55.120 --> 2:43:00.320]  And that explains why in choosing between a danger from an individual and danger from
[2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:05.400]  government, it's the danger of government that's got to be captured first rather than
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:10.320]  placed ahead, I mean, viewed as less suspect than an individual.
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:15.920]  And I also want to address this idea, well, the laws don't work because, listen, we prosecuted
[2:43:15.920 --> 2:43:20.240]  terrorists before 9-11, we still ended up with that day of abominations.
[2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:22.560]  But the same thing can be said about laws against murder.
[2:43:22.560 --> 2:43:27.280]  I mean, we get 14-15,000 murders each year, we prosecute people for murder, we sentence
[2:43:27.280 --> 2:43:29.920]  some of them to death, but it doesn't end all murders.
[2:43:29.920 --> 2:43:33.520]  We still end up with the same number annually.
[2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:38.920]  But we recognize, we don't revel in that tragedy, but recognize if the only way that you can
[2:43:38.920 --> 2:43:43.280]  stop all murders is to send the police or the military into everybody's house and detain
[2:43:43.280 --> 2:43:48.000]  everybody on the idea that maybe in the next 20 years they could have an evil thought,
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:51.240]  that's the end of the United States, that's the end of freedom, that's the end of why
[2:43:51.240 --> 2:43:52.240]  we're a country.
[2:43:52.240 --> 2:43:56.520]  Bruce, I want to raise the collapse of the empire and what the time frame is, you see
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:44:00.760]  in a general sense, because your new books on that subject, man, then take a few calls.
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:05.720]  But from my historical research, and those that don't know history are doomed to repeat
[2:44:05.720 --> 2:44:09.360]  it, I've been reading history books since I'm about 10 years old just because I found
[2:44:09.360 --> 2:44:10.560]  them entertaining.
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:16.240]  That's actually what got me into talk radio, politics, everything, because I found that
[2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:22.320]  the best reading was actually history, because truth is stranger than fiction.
[2:44:22.320 --> 2:44:26.720]  Why read a science fiction book, or a Louis Lamor Western, when I could read real stuff
[2:44:26.720 --> 2:44:31.200]  that happened and every page was jam-packed, and then of course I recognized the same patterns
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:35.360]  in modern times and didn't see people threatened by it, so that's why I got involved.
[2:44:35.360 --> 2:44:37.400]  Same reason Ron Paul did, same reason you did.
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:42.840]  I mean, history really is a lens to the future and the present, not just the past, but isn't
[2:44:42.840 --> 2:44:48.400]  it that empires always cause their own demise by the attempt to dominate and take over?
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:54.840]  There have been about 72 prior empires, and you're exactly right Alex, it's self-ruination.
[2:44:54.840 --> 2:45:01.440]  They collapse because of arrogance and contempt and efforts to control and reach beyond their
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:03.280]  capabilities.
[2:45:03.280 --> 2:45:09.560]  And if you look at the United States, I say maybe we've got 40, 50 years more, it could
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:15.400]  be shorter than that time before we simply collapse because we cannot support economically
[2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:22.240]  the empire, and we cannot protect ourselves when every day we're creating enemies by interfering
[2:45:22.240 --> 2:45:30.360]  with every other nation's political dispensation with the use of force.
[2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:35.880]  And it doesn't matter what individuals think are our altruistic motives, yet we end up burning
[2:45:35.880 --> 2:45:43.080]  Koran's, we end up killing innocent citizens, that's just a few crucian feasts.
[2:45:43.080 --> 2:45:46.120]  You saw the Marines urinating on the bodies and I heard talk show host defending and I'm
[2:45:46.120 --> 2:45:49.640]  like, don't you know how many troops this is going to get killed now?
[2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:50.640]  Yeah, right.
[2:45:50.640 --> 2:45:54.840]  And the idea that the other people don't get angry, you know, when we're killing them
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:45:59.080]  and we're destroying their country, I mean, we would react the same way.
[2:45:59.080 --> 2:46:03.560]  And we're so arrogant, we somehow think that these people whose countries we're occupying
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:06.600]  will be grateful and they'll throw flowers at us and we get angry.
[2:46:06.600 --> 2:46:07.600]  How can we not grateful?
[2:46:07.600 --> 2:46:11.760]  I mean, we lecture Hamad Karzai in Afghanistan, you should be loving us.
[2:46:11.760 --> 2:46:14.080]  You know, why are you telling us don't do nighttime raids?
[2:46:14.080 --> 2:46:17.920]  Why are you telling us not to use predator drones that kill women and children?
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:19.880]  You should love us because we've saved you from all.
[2:46:19.880 --> 2:46:23.320]  It's like the SWAT teams, it's like the SWAT teams with the drug war.
[2:46:23.320 --> 2:46:25.760]  You should love us busting down your doors in the middle of the night.
[2:46:25.760 --> 2:46:27.000]  You should love the checkpoints.
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:31.240]  You should love the black uniforms and it's like, no, no one likes this.
[2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:33.920]  No one sees it as a threat instinctively.
[2:46:33.920 --> 2:46:37.240]  Final point and then I want to get to some calls here, Bruce, and I want to hog all the
[2:46:37.240 --> 2:46:40.360]  time with you today and I want you to be able to get some questions.
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:46.160]  But I think the elite also forgets the point that it's not just about having weapons.
[2:46:46.160 --> 2:46:51.680]  Who has the moral superiority is who tends to win over time and we're losing the moral
[2:46:51.680 --> 2:46:56.760]  superiority and it's not just in our politics, just in the culture.
[2:46:56.760 --> 2:47:01.120]  When the leaders start engaging in this activity, other people start imitating it and then
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:03.680]  corruption runs rampant and the society collapses.
[2:47:03.680 --> 2:47:08.440]  So I agree, no way we're going more than 30, 40 years, but with the acceleration of technology
[2:47:08.440 --> 2:47:14.320]  and all the things that are happening, Bruce, I don't see us lasting another 15 years.
[2:47:14.320 --> 2:47:17.720]  I mean, I see it coming down the line quicker.
[2:47:17.720 --> 2:47:23.200]  It may well be in a historically empires have collapsed very, very quickly.
[2:47:23.200 --> 2:47:27.920]  It's not a long drawn out installment plan kind of descent and you're absolutely right
[2:47:27.920 --> 2:47:31.200]  with regard to the weapons technology doesn't mean victory.
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:33.360]  If that were true, we would have won in Vietnam.
[2:47:33.360 --> 2:47:39.000]  In fact, Robert McNamara, the first secretary of defense under John F. Kennedy visited Vietnam
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:43.720]  as his first travel abroad and he returns and says, by every quantitative measure, Alex,
[2:47:43.720 --> 2:47:45.800]  we have won the war already.
[2:47:45.800 --> 2:47:51.720]  And then we remember the skids and the helicopters out of Saigon and that is exactly correct.
[2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:55.920]  If it was just technology, we would have lost the Revolutionary War.
[2:47:55.920 --> 2:48:00.480]  The British had far more sophisticated weapons had far more frigates, etc.
[2:48:00.480 --> 2:48:03.520]  And it's the ultimately the moral fiber of the people that would prevail.
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:08.040]  The Soviets had far greater technology in Afghanistan and yet they lost because they
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:10.000]  were in there for a crop motives as well.
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:17.200]  Well, you know, the universal rule, the person that's assaulting someone preemptively from
[2:48:17.200 --> 2:48:19.800]  a position of corruption will end up losing.
[2:48:19.800 --> 2:48:21.280]  Look at Hitler and Russia.
[2:48:21.280 --> 2:48:22.280]  Look at Napoleon.
[2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:27.080]  And it just keeps happening and I think the elite have lost their minds that are imperiling
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:28.080]  us all.
[2:48:28.080 --> 2:48:32.200]  Let's jam in a phone call for constitutional scholar and bestselling author Bruce Fonnell,
[2:48:32.200 --> 2:48:35.000]  so the chief policy advisor to Ron Paul.
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:40.760]  Let's talk to Rob in California first, listening on 1340 a.m. KOMY.
[2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:42.520]  Go ahead, Rob there in Santa Cruz.
[2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:43.520]  Commend you.
[2:48:43.520 --> 2:48:45.800]  I want to commend you, Alex, for having Bruce on, Bruce.
[2:48:45.800 --> 2:48:46.800]  Thank you for being on.
[2:48:46.800 --> 2:48:50.040]  I'll be as brief and concise as possible.
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:59.080]  Now, the listener base of this show and other shows, Coast to Coast Radio Liberty, if we're
[2:48:59.080 --> 2:49:05.160]  going to be able to have Ron Paul actually on these shows and an increasing amount because
[2:49:05.160 --> 2:49:10.240]  it doesn't seem like radio, one of the vast avenues of platform for freedom of liberty
[2:49:10.240 --> 2:49:13.040]  is really being utilized by the Ron Paul campaign.
[2:49:13.040 --> 2:49:14.920]  I don't want, well, you do have Bruce here.
[2:49:14.920 --> 2:49:18.560]  He does him on policy and I know they've got smart people very capable in the campaign,
[2:49:18.560 --> 2:49:24.280]  but I will say the last big audiences, I mean, Coast to Coast, 16 million listeners a night,
[2:49:24.280 --> 2:49:29.000]  believe me, I've been on CNN Fox, no response, Coast to Coast, giant response, servers crashing,
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:33.600]  Drudge Report, it's all the alternative media and I know that's late at night, but yeah,
[2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:37.200]  Bruce, what about trying to get Ron Paul on some of the bigger radio shows more because
[2:49:37.200 --> 2:49:41.840]  they do have bigger audiences, not glitzy like Rachel Maddow with a half million or
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:44.640]  Fox with two million, but I mean, these are bigger shows.
[2:49:44.640 --> 2:49:50.560]  Well, the difficulty that a candidate confronts Alex is what you might call the opportunity
[2:49:50.560 --> 2:49:51.560]  cost.
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:57.960]  Ron's got to choose between influencing the future by making sure he arrives at Tampa
[2:49:57.960 --> 2:50:02.440]  with the greatest delegate number and that's face-to-face, you know, activity, campaigning
[2:50:02.440 --> 2:50:08.800]  out there and going on a radio or television show that isn't out there, face-to-face encouraging.
[2:50:08.800 --> 2:50:14.920]  So what you're saying is he's shifted more to real politics, retail politics on the ground.
[2:50:14.920 --> 2:50:20.240]  With regard to, in looking towards August, absolutely, because that's what's really going
[2:50:20.240 --> 2:50:25.320]  to give his voice a megaphone there, the greater number of delegates that he has.
[2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:26.320]  Sure.
[2:50:26.320 --> 2:50:29.320]  He's not starry-eyed and thinking that no matter what he preaches, if he shows up with
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:33.160]  a handful of delegates instead of, say, four or five, or...
[2:50:33.160 --> 2:50:37.400]  Ron Paul knows a lot more about politics than I do and I agree with you, I'm not gonna second
[2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:40.400]  guess him on that, so I think he knows what he's doing.
[2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:41.400]  All right.
[2:50:41.400 --> 2:50:42.400]  Well, Bruce, stay there.
[2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:45.200]  We're gonna come back with one more quick segment jamming, a few more calls, maybe do
[2:50:45.200 --> 2:50:48.680]  five minutes of overdrive, but I know Bruce has got to go, but I should have gone to calls
[2:50:48.680 --> 2:50:49.680]  earlier.
[2:50:49.680 --> 2:50:51.680]  We'll be right back and we'll also tell you about his book.
[2:50:51.680 --> 2:50:55.520]  In fact, we'll put it up on screen right now for viewers, but radio listeners can go to
[2:50:55.520 --> 2:51:10.920]  infowars.com, we have a link to it, it's American Empire, before the fall, Bruce Fein, stay

[2:51:47.920 --> 2:52:06.760]  We all know the importance of having storable foods, but what about when the food runs out,
[2:52:06.760 --> 2:52:08.560]  what then?
[2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:11.960]  For real food independence, you need a supply of non-hybrid seeds.

[2:55:15.520 --> 2:55:20.520]  Well, I think that's just the rumor that's the child of all political campaigns.
[2:55:20.520 --> 2:55:25.520]  Ron has staked out his positions that have not varied for decades.
[2:55:25.520 --> 2:55:29.520]  He's not going to compromise those because he understands his ideas that are more important
[2:55:29.520 --> 2:55:30.520]  than the individual.
[2:55:30.520 --> 2:55:37.360]  And these claim to sort of back channel sort of a truce between Ron Paul's ideas and Mitt
[2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:41.360]  Romney's is just another one of those hoaxes.
[2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:48.160]  And you can't imagine more opposites when you read Mitt Romney's created core for invading
[2:55:48.160 --> 2:55:51.280]  Iran today in the Washington Post op-ed.
[2:55:51.280 --> 2:55:56.120]  Any more people who are opposite with regard to our foreign policy and where we ought to
[2:55:56.120 --> 2:56:01.320]  be spending our defense dollars to protect Americans in America rather than being the
[2:56:01.320 --> 2:56:02.520]  policeman of the world.
[2:56:02.520 --> 2:56:08.560]  So I think all your audience can be reassured and comforted that Ron Paul's not renouncing
[2:56:08.560 --> 2:56:11.680]  any of his fundamental points no matter what.
[2:56:11.680 --> 2:56:14.800]  And we talked to Lou Rockwell, I've talked to some folks behind the scenes in the Paul
[2:56:14.800 --> 2:56:16.920]  campaign, they laughed at it.
[2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:18.120]  But they just keep running it.
[2:56:18.120 --> 2:56:19.560]  Oh, Ron Paul's sold out.
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:24.240]  It's all an attempt to stall his support, another stinking trick.
[2:56:24.240 --> 2:56:26.560]  Let's go to Jeremy in Kansas here on the air with Bruce Fine.
[2:56:26.560 --> 2:56:27.560]  Go ahead.
[2:56:27.560 --> 2:56:28.560]  Hey, Jeremy Alex.
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:29.560]  Yes, sir.
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:30.560]  Go ahead.
[2:56:30.560 --> 2:56:31.560]  All right.
[2:56:31.560 --> 2:56:36.320]  Hey, I'm running for Congress here in Second District of Kansas.
[2:56:36.320 --> 2:56:39.320]  And I'd like to thank God you for Ron Paul and you.
[2:56:39.320 --> 2:56:41.320]  Oh, I don't know where to start.
[2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:42.320]  That's all right.
[2:56:42.320 --> 2:56:43.320]  We don't have a lot of time though.
[2:56:43.320 --> 2:56:44.320]  Do you have a question for Bruce Fine?
[2:56:44.320 --> 2:56:45.320]  Yeah.
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:47.320]  What's the best advice you could give me?
[2:56:47.320 --> 2:56:52.480]  The best advice I have for you is to say, as you're a member of Congress, unlike the
[2:56:52.480 --> 2:56:57.720]  current contingent there, you're going to assert and take account of your responsibilities.
[2:56:57.720 --> 2:56:59.320]  You will decide on one piece.
[2:56:59.320 --> 2:57:00.320]  You won't surrender it.
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:03.120]  You're going to insist on oversight of the executive branch.
[2:57:03.120 --> 2:57:08.000]  You won't just do trust me and let the president decide things.
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:12.440]  You're not going to authorize the president to shower subsidies, money, tarps, everything
[2:57:12.440 --> 2:57:17.040]  else on private enterprise to help his friends and destroy his enemies.
[2:57:17.040 --> 2:57:20.880]  And you're going to insist that the Federal Reserve Board be accountable like any other
[2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:21.880]  institution.
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:24.920]  Congress should have its oversight as any other institution.
[2:57:24.920 --> 2:57:25.920]  Yes, sir.
[2:57:25.920 --> 2:57:30.080]  It's as outlandish that it can create a trillion dollars out of thin air with no congressional
[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:31.560]  authorization involvement whatsoever.
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:32.560]  You're right.
[2:57:32.560 --> 2:57:36.160]  If you say, as you're a member of Congress, you're going to actually make decisions rather
[2:57:36.160 --> 2:57:40.400]  than the current invertebrate branch that now considers every darn thing to the president.
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:41.400]  Let's go to another call.
[2:57:41.400 --> 2:57:42.400]  Great points.
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:43.400]  Powerful points.
[2:57:43.400 --> 2:57:44.400]  Diane and Louisiana, quickly.
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:45.400]  Go ahead.
[2:57:45.400 --> 2:57:46.400]  Question for Bruce Fine.
[2:57:46.400 --> 2:57:47.400]  Yes, Mr. Fine.
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:53.280]  I know you work closely with Ron Paul, and I understand he is a very soft-spoken individual,
[2:57:53.280 --> 2:57:56.720]  but I like to see him when he gets ready to come out on that panel.
[2:57:56.720 --> 2:58:02.720]  I don't want to say that he's for liberty, but he just needs to pepper it up a little
[2:58:02.720 --> 2:58:08.160]  bit and let him know he's against the NDAA and the shutting down of the Internet and
[2:58:08.160 --> 2:58:10.480]  the Federal Reserve and TSA.
[2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:16.680]  And I wanted to say that the last time Joe Flinke was on there, I agree with everything
[2:58:16.680 --> 2:58:20.560]  he said about Ron Paul's, and need to step it up a little bit.
[2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:23.720]  Well, Ron Paul is working himself to death out there, and he is a gentleman.
[2:58:23.720 --> 2:58:26.800]  But when he gets attacked, he'll come back with fire, but Bruce, we're about to go to
[2:58:26.800 --> 2:58:28.120]  break, but 20 seconds on that.
[2:58:28.120 --> 2:58:33.600]  Yeah, what about getting Ron Paul to be a little more vicious, or is he just too gentlemanly?
[2:58:33.600 --> 2:58:37.120]  Well, he's not somebody who's inclined to ad hominem attacks.
[2:58:37.120 --> 2:58:40.080]  Maybe you'd like him to be on 20 cylinders when he's on 15.
[2:58:40.080 --> 2:58:41.080]  Stay there.
[2:58:41.080 --> 2:58:42.080]  Stay there.
[2:58:42.080 --> 2:58:43.080]  We'll be right back.
[2:58:43.080 --> 2:58:44.080]  Stay there.
[2:58:44.080 --> 2:58:45.080]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:45.080 --> 2:58:51.580]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:51.580 --> 2:58:53.600]  This is Alex Jones with Five Good Reasons.
[2:58:53.600 --> 2:58:56.280]  You should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:58:56.280 --> 2:59:00.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:59:00.600 --> 2:59:04.920]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:59:04.920 --> 2:59:06.240]  allows you to have.
[2:59:06.240 --> 2:59:07.240]  It's true.
[2:59:07.240 --> 2:59:11.920]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:59:11.920 --> 2:59:16.280]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:59:16.280 --> 2:59:20.280]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:59:20.280 --> 2:59:23.760]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:59:23.760 --> 2:59:27.480]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:59:27.480 --> 2:59:32.200]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:59:32.200 --> 2:59:36.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:37.400]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:59:37.400 --> 2:59:41.640]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[2:59:52.240 --> 3:00:21.240]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[3:00:21.240 --> 3:00:41.380]  Thank you.
[3:00:51.240 --> 3:00:56.520]  I mean, I would like to see him attack him a little bit more.
[3:00:56.520 --> 3:01:03.220]  I think that maybe we'd like to see him more in a Churchillian mode, if you will.
[3:01:03.220 --> 3:01:04.760]  But it wouldn't be Ron Paul.
[3:01:04.760 --> 3:01:09.120]  And I think it's the authenticity that attracts so many.
[3:01:09.120 --> 3:01:13.520]  And okay, you know, some people just have more natural charisma than others.
[3:01:13.520 --> 3:01:21.400]  They are to be a play actor rather than genuine, I think that's going to end up subtracting
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:23.600]  more enthusiasm than the effort.
[3:01:23.600 --> 3:01:24.600]  No, I agree with you.
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:28.640]  It is the fact that, I mean, I've met him privately, some people that know him really
[3:01:28.640 --> 3:01:32.880]  well, they say, the Ron Paul you see is Ron Paul.
[3:01:32.880 --> 3:01:37.520]  And that's why the system always attacks the authenticity.
[3:01:37.520 --> 3:01:39.480]  They hate the genuineness of it.
[3:01:39.480 --> 3:01:40.480]  Yeah, that's right.
[3:01:40.480 --> 3:01:46.080]  And I think you see perhaps Romney is the most artificial candidate whatsoever, you
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:51.640]  know, and he tends to paint himself as just an ordinary guy, you know, owning and mingling
[3:01:51.640 --> 3:01:58.000]  with Nascar owners and making just a little 370,000 a year and pointing out his wife,
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:00.960]  you know, drives Cadillacs and the trees are the right size.
[3:02:00.960 --> 3:02:05.560]  And I think that hurts Romney because everybody sees he's really out this, not because he
[3:02:05.560 --> 3:02:08.640]  has any genuine interest in the exercise there.
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:12.840]  He's trying to maneuver and paint himself in a new image in order to win votes.
[3:02:12.840 --> 3:02:17.440]  Yeah, it's not bad that he's rich, it's bad that he tries to act like he's just a blue
[3:02:17.440 --> 3:02:18.440]  collar guy.
[3:02:18.440 --> 3:02:22.640]  Yeah, which is such a joke, you know, and everybody can see right through it.
[3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:27.000]  And I think that's one of the reasons why he's gotten so little traction and why, in
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:30.700]  my view, he's not going to arrive in Tampa with a majority of the delegates.
[3:02:30.700 --> 3:02:34.040]  People will still be highly suspect of his authenticity.
[3:02:34.040 --> 3:02:36.240]  And that's devastating when it comes to politics.
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:40.520]  Oftentimes, you can get a vote from somebody who may disagree with you, but be totally
[3:02:40.520 --> 3:02:45.000]  supportive of your courage and your candor, but he's not getting any of those people because
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:46.280]  he flips and he flops.
[3:02:46.280 --> 3:02:49.720]  He is a complete weather vane, whichever way the wind blows.
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:52.080]  Mark in New Hampshire, quick question for Bruce Fine.
[3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:53.080]  Go ahead.
[3:02:53.080 --> 3:03:01.280]  I would like to know if Ron Paul does make it, right?
[3:03:01.280 --> 3:03:07.160]  And I say our military breaks off and goes against Israel, is he going to support it?
[3:03:07.160 --> 3:03:09.840]  Our military, our military wouldn't go against Israel.
[3:03:09.840 --> 3:03:10.840]  What do you mean?
[3:03:10.840 --> 3:03:19.200]  According to the U.S. War College, Dr. Alan Sobrowski, he said that they have proof that
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:27.000]  Israel did 9-11 and he says if they find out our military, he said they would break off,
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:29.400]  he says, and they would wipe Israel right off the map.
[3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:33.120]  I'll have to look that up, but if there was a war college report, even though there are
[3:03:33.120 --> 3:03:36.400]  thousands of different people that write reports for them, if that was actually there, I would
[3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:37.400]  have heard about this.
[3:03:37.400 --> 3:03:38.400]  Is that new?
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:41.800]  No, but I'm wondering why you don't have them on, Alex.
[3:03:41.800 --> 3:03:43.800]  I don't even know who you're talking about, sir.
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:47.480]  I'm not omnipresent, but...
[3:03:47.480 --> 3:03:49.160]  But Alex, I think I'd respond.
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:53.920]  I think Ron Paul has made it quite clear that Israel, like the United States, has a right
[3:03:53.920 --> 3:03:58.760]  to self-preservation, and he's not going to lecture them on how they think they need exercise
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:01.840]  that, and that's their business.
[3:04:01.840 --> 3:04:05.920]  Just like the United States has our understanding of what our security interests are, and we
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:10.520]  don't want any country to try to lecture us about that, and that's why we understand deterrence
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:14.640]  is what works, and we would incinerate Iran if they attacked us.
[3:04:14.640 --> 3:04:19.880]  We want the opposite of this global entanglement garbage that George Washington talked about.
[3:04:19.880 --> 3:04:23.760]  Why can't we be like Switzerland and neutral and then be wealthy?
[3:04:23.760 --> 3:04:25.600]  People that are neutral are smart.
[3:04:25.600 --> 3:04:31.880]  Yeah, exactly, because they know, in the other countries, they exploit our empire mentality
[3:04:31.880 --> 3:04:35.840]  by letting us pick up the bill and the cost of their defense.
[3:04:35.840 --> 3:04:40.800]  I mean, look at Japan, South Korea, wealthiest can be, and we got tens of thousands of troops
[3:04:40.800 --> 3:04:43.560]  there defending them against their would-be enemies.
[3:04:43.560 --> 3:04:44.560]  I mean, it's crazy.
[3:04:44.560 --> 3:04:48.680]  They got to defend themselves, and the fact is, Alex, we have the luxury that we should
[3:04:48.680 --> 3:04:53.080]  not overlook of being the most powerful country in the world, and there's nobody who's an
[3:04:53.080 --> 3:04:55.080]  existential threat to the United States.
[3:04:55.080 --> 3:04:59.520]  We should recognize that, and we're inventing goblins out there.
[3:04:59.520 --> 3:05:00.520]  Exactly.
[3:05:00.520 --> 3:05:01.520]  Great job, Bruce.
[3:05:01.520 --> 3:05:29.040]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video, peace out.
