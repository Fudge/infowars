[00:50.000 --> 00:54.240]  then all that money goes to build the New World Order not one red cent of it
[00:54.240 --> 01:00.760]  goes to roads or quote the military or federal services and the hundreds of
[01:00.760 --> 01:07.840]  other taxes fines and fees do so we're not gonna spend a lot of time on tax

[10:04.120 --> 10:07.960]  Austin I said no he said well you should see it and I forgot and didn't look it
[10:07.960 --> 10:12.280]  up then he came into the studio last night came up here and brought me the
[10:12.280 --> 10:18.160]  statesman and it's a big color image on the front section of the statesman it
[10:18.160 --> 10:26.800]  says everything must go and it is an image of the Constitution being ripped
[10:26.800 --> 10:33.640]  in pieces and it says how to fight terrorism and it goes on to say that
[10:33.640 --> 10:38.320]  basically we should get rid of the Constitution by the way the Vidcam is
[10:38.320 --> 10:42.520]  going to go live in the second hour today we're going to have the Vidcam live

[10:51.080 --> 10:57.720]  newspaper and the image tells a thousand words a picture tells a thousand
[10:57.720 --> 11:02.880]  words but it's a thousand words in the article to that tell you in words and it
[11:02.880 --> 11:10.800]  says the Constitution is bad and that we basically need to get rid of it is
[11:10.800 --> 11:18.000]  that's Bob it who says this he's the Bilderberg CFR member he has written a
[11:18.000 --> 11:27.600]  new book terror and consent and we're going to be going over that article also
[11:27.600 --> 11:32.480]  Amy Goodman supports investigation into WTC collapse so she's now going public
[11:32.480 --> 11:38.920]  more lucrodowski questioned her we are change.org it's up on info wars.com too
[11:38.920 --> 11:46.520]  also there is a posting up on info wars.com of a YouTube video that says
[11:46.520 --> 11:54.760]  Alex Jones I'm not being mean you're just retarded sir and I was being serious
[11:54.760 --> 11:59.640]  when I said that I made the point of where you breastfed and the guy started
[11:59.640 --> 12:05.600]  stuttering and got mad and hung up and that's because if you're not breastfed
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.200]  I'm not bashing mothers that can't produce milk or children that can't
[12:09.200 --> 12:13.160]  absorb it for some reason I'm just saying that those are the fats that are
[12:13.160 --> 12:16.480]  used in the development of the brain and there's a bunch of different studies on
[12:16.480 --> 12:20.280]  it you can just look up breastfeeding and brain development Google that and
[12:20.280 --> 12:23.360]  those studies will come up everywhere for you that that's what you're designed
[12:23.360 --> 12:26.240]  to drink and your brain is forming at that time and you need those complex
[12:26.240 --> 12:32.600]  fats that are tailor-designed you know by the female body for the baby wow yet
[12:32.600 --> 12:36.000]  grew inside that woman inside her uterus of the new life and then it
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.520]  suckles from her I'm extreme it's kind of like ads you see that says grass fed
[12:41.520 --> 12:47.680]  beef cows that have actually eaten grass how strange oh babies that have
[12:47.680 --> 12:53.160]  actually had their mother's milk I'm so extreme so I took that example to say
[12:53.160 --> 12:56.280]  sir you've been drinking fluoride your whole life you probably weren't breastfed
[12:56.280 --> 13:07.040]  and you know that's why because he was so stupid he was stammering around I was
[13:07.040 --> 13:10.440]  talking about how thousands tens of thousands of Nazis were brought into the
[13:10.440 --> 13:22.520]  US and how they advised the fledgling CIA OSS they advised in the development of
[13:22.520 --> 13:27.960]  the atomic agencies the energy Department of Energy just Department of
[13:27.960 --> 13:33.680]  Defense but that was already the case I mean so much of our culture our
[13:33.680 --> 13:38.360]  educational system that's what's called kindergarten is a Prussian mind control
[13:38.360 --> 13:42.560]  brainwashing system I mean that's in the Prussian textbooks and we've had
[13:42.560 --> 13:46.400]  number two Department of Education on we sell a book Liberty coming down that
[13:46.400 --> 13:50.200]  has the secret documents and declassified documents from Department of
[13:50.200 --> 13:55.480]  Education I'm not even bashing Germans here I'm half German my mother's German
[13:55.480 --> 14:03.040]  on both sides of her family actually all Alsatian for some reason but that's
[14:03.040 --> 14:08.400]  southern German I'm just trying to understand you know what makes the
[14:08.400 --> 14:15.880]  world tick and it's a Britannic slash Germanic slash Judaic amalgamation and
[14:15.880 --> 14:20.160]  those are the three dominant cultures that form what we are today and what
[14:20.160 --> 14:23.160]  the New World Order is
[14:25.480 --> 14:36.000]  Britain Germany and the Jews that is the dominant cultures that formed what we
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.720]  know of as Western culture today and then of course there's also a root in
[14:40.720 --> 14:46.960]  the Greeks and their eugenics what you could call you know the the really the
[14:46.960 --> 14:54.160]  dominant link but but but in the more modern last thousand years dark ages
[14:54.160 --> 14:58.080]  emerging into the Renaissance the last 400 it's it's it's those three major
[14:58.080 --> 15:01.720]  influences but I'm getting off into political science and sociology and
[15:01.720 --> 15:10.040]  history it's that this person just says I'm lying and I say what's your proof and
[15:10.040 --> 15:17.800]  he just says you're you're just lying and so I say well sir you're retarded now
[15:17.800 --> 15:21.640]  there are many comments along these lines but I'm just gonna read this one
[15:21.640 --> 15:29.320]  comment number 77 on info wars.com in the section Alex Jones I'm not being
[15:29.320 --> 15:36.120]  mean you're just retarded sir and I take no sardonic pleasure telling the man
[15:36.120 --> 15:42.840]  that he's mentally brain damaged that he's physically unable to think it's
[15:42.840 --> 15:47.040]  not just that they're willfully ignorant they're they're they're like they have
[15:47.040 --> 15:53.240]  the minds of about four-year-olds and I'm serious a lot of adults have the minds
[15:53.240 --> 15:57.480]  of four-year-olds and when you talk to them they talk like four-year-olds a
[15:57.480 --> 16:00.800]  smart four-year-old
[16:00.800 --> 16:06.080]  now this is what think a marine for your freedom says now now just listen to
[16:06.080 --> 16:12.360]  that propaganda term 70 plus percent of the military once out of Iraq for two
[16:12.360 --> 16:17.840]  plus years 80 plus percent of the American people so with that headline
[16:17.840 --> 16:22.920]  with his handle name it implies that you've got your freedom because of the
[16:22.920 --> 16:28.680]  Marines and that we've got to thank him you know we wouldn't even exist if it
[16:28.680 --> 16:33.840]  wasn't for him and it is true I do think the Marines for Texas and for kicking
[16:33.840 --> 16:40.200]  Mexico's butt when they attack Texas in the US the halls of Montezuma to the
[16:40.200 --> 16:44.160]  shores of Tripoli and I do think the Marines for a few other things but a
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.360]  Spendley Butler said after about 1900 it was only going in and blowing up third
[16:48.360 --> 16:54.240]  world countries and taking them over the bankers and I do thank you for world
[16:54.240 --> 16:59.220]  war two but for your sacrifice but at the same time our own government created
[16:59.220 --> 17:05.400]  Hitler and the Japanese as unsavory as their imperial system was were
[17:05.400 --> 17:11.120]  manipulated into it so I'm just into the reality so out of the gates you have
[17:11.120 --> 17:18.080]  your term your handle think a marine for your freedom and then he goes on to
[17:18.080 --> 17:22.520]  claim that I'm this master propagandist commenting on what I said in the eight
[17:22.520 --> 17:29.080]  minute clip to the man that is braindead this is a good example of why AJ is so
[17:29.080 --> 17:35.040]  effective at what he does he takes facts and then makes huge leaps he is a
[17:35.040 --> 17:39.960]  master at doublespeak for example when he says that Florida CPS is run by a
[17:39.960 --> 17:45.080]  bunch of pedophiles his only qualification is that that generally
[17:45.080 --> 17:50.600]  people who take your kids are pedophiles is this a true statement yes but
[17:50.600 --> 17:55.800]  is there any evidence of the people that run Florida CPS or pedophiles no okay
[17:55.800 --> 18:02.400]  we're gonna use you as a case point example and by we're the Liberty
[18:02.400 --> 18:07.520]  consciousness that's there is we have tens of thousands of people that post on
[18:07.520 --> 18:11.600]  YouTube they're gonna go and they're gonna take your text they're gonna take
[18:11.600 --> 18:14.720]  my audio and they're gonna put mainstream articles up over it I don't
[18:14.720 --> 18:17.440]  even have to do it because I don't have time I'm counting on you listeners to do
[18:17.440 --> 18:25.600]  this I know you will no sir five years ago the top three heads number one two
[18:25.600 --> 18:33.120]  and three was in the Miami papers it was in it was all over the news and those
[18:33.120 --> 18:36.240]  will be pulled and just like we do with Mayor Ed Koch we will put it over your
[18:36.240 --> 18:41.160]  statements from sent com you will be defeated in Florida where you're sitting
[18:41.160 --> 18:45.400]  right now or you're a copycat who regurgitates and mockingbirds what your
[18:45.400 --> 18:48.880]  bosses and sent com do by the way it's admitted for three years that sent com
[18:48.880 --> 18:53.520]  does blog and does quote counter propaganda on the web inside the US so

[38:14.100 --> 38:17.420]  it the next break because I know people won't check into this I want you to see
[38:17.420 --> 38:22.740]  this I mean this is sick when we start the next hour I'll have this image up
[38:22.740 --> 38:27.300]  there for them we'll get into NASA secrets and a lot more but he goes on
[38:27.300 --> 38:37.100]  this thing a marine for your freedom he says he takes true statements and twist
[38:37.100 --> 38:41.660]  them to form an anti-government conclusion hey Bubba patriotism isn't
[38:41.660 --> 38:44.420]  worshiping the government have you read the founding fathers or Teddy Roosevelt
[38:44.420 --> 38:48.020]  it's following the Bill of Rights of Constitution when a government gets
[38:48.020 --> 38:51.740]  sideways against that they're the enemy you read the Declaration of
[38:51.740 --> 38:55.620]  Independence or is that an al-qaeda document to I got FEMA on video teaching
[38:55.620 --> 39:00.380]  the founding fathers are bad it's in my film Road Attorney the Nazis I'm sorry
[39:00.380 --> 39:06.500]  not bad terrorists the founding fathers are terrorists the Nazis brought over is
[39:06.500 --> 39:10.140]  a misleading statement these were not decision-makers in the war of the party
[39:10.140 --> 39:16.980]  these were guys that valuable knowledge and information that went a long way with
[39:16.980 --> 39:21.580]  the party whatever that means for survival and did you notice that Alex
[39:21.580 --> 39:25.620]  never qualified what that means yes I did I've mentioned what they were brought
[39:25.620 --> 39:31.180]  over for so they were Nazis show me something that states how we became
[39:31.180 --> 39:37.260]  Nazis because of their influence it is all a smokescreen to use a group with
[39:37.260 --> 39:41.820]  such negative connotation to it and make people afraid of Naziism returning
[39:41.820 --> 39:46.180]  this time in America yet there is no evidence of it only theory he never
[39:46.180 --> 39:51.340]  qualified how we are being sprayed only that we are hell he could have just
[39:51.340 --> 39:57.180]  thrown out crop dusting the people really need to wake up to the sky he is
[39:57.180 --> 40:01.300]  as good as there is when it comes to mind games his site motto is right
[40:01.300 --> 40:06.300]  there's a war on for your mind he means it and he is one of the combatants that
[40:06.300 --> 40:10.140]  wants to control it see I'm an enemy combatant this is definitely a shent
[40:10.140 --> 40:17.760]  calm joker or someone parroting their info now let's stop right there it's
[40:17.760 --> 40:20.820]  illegal for sent com to be doing what they're doing and they admit they're
[40:20.820 --> 40:24.700]  engaging in domestic propaganda and fake news buying and all the rest of it
[40:24.700 --> 40:28.420]  headline 1.6 billion fake news purchased I mean the government's doing a
[40:28.420 --> 40:31.420]  Department of Education is doing it they're all engaged in government
[40:31.420 --> 40:43.460]  propaganda placement and I for one have had enough of it on that very show I
[40:43.460 --> 40:49.420]  talked about how the Goddard Space Center named after Goddard the Nazi
[40:49.420 --> 40:57.180]  Werner von Braun the head of NASA was the head of Nazi weapons development for
[40:57.180 --> 41:04.180]  the entire Reich he was one of the senior members directly under Albert
[41:04.180 --> 41:12.860]  Speer who ran the Nazi economy they brought Joseph Mingola over and
[41:12.860 --> 41:18.380]  protected him that's mainstream information he helped form the modern
[41:18.380 --> 41:24.820]  CIA they brought tens of thousands of them over my grandfather lived in
[41:24.820 --> 41:28.540]  Midland Texas when the bushes were there he said he'd go into the restaurants
[41:28.540 --> 41:34.420]  of the bars he was a Lee sound and there were Nazis all over the place the fact
[41:34.420 --> 41:39.860]  that Klaus Barbie was protected and worked for the CIA is admitted you know
[41:39.860 --> 41:48.860]  who Klaus Barbie is look it up more than a thousand Nazi scientists were in NASA
[41:48.860 --> 41:53.140]  alone and obviously they were brought over here I mean that's even in the
[41:53.140 --> 41:58.260]  right stuff which is written you know it's a true story we're brought over
[41:58.260 --> 42:03.420]  here because they did have a knowledge that's what I said in that very radio
[42:03.420 --> 42:11.860]  show but I added the key point here I said we are not the Nazis in that very
[42:11.860 --> 42:18.700]  show this guy says I didn't say it Sunday show I said we're not the Nazis
[42:18.700 --> 42:25.380]  they are us the Nazis got everything they did from the Rockefeller Brothers
[42:25.380 --> 42:31.740]  Foundation from the Eugenics Society from the Eugenics Records Office which is
[42:31.740 --> 42:37.380]  where the human genome project is based at Cold Springs Harbor today the same
[42:37.380 --> 42:40.100]  guy running it since the 40s had to step down last year for saying blacks
[42:40.100 --> 42:44.460]  basically weren't human dr. Watson then you got the Watson family owning IBM
[42:44.460 --> 42:48.820]  getting the highest black eagle award from Adolf Hitler the highest civilian
[42:48.820 --> 42:54.980]  award IBM machines being used the Gates is giving 70 plus billion with Warren
[42:54.980 --> 43:00.860]  Buffett to carry out Eugenics his daddy runs Planned Parenthood Gates's daddy and
[43:00.860 --> 43:07.620]  I said the Germans and the Kaiser Wilhelm Society were funded by the US and
[43:07.620 --> 43:11.700]  Hitler quotes it in Mein Kampf and in other writings in other books he's
[43:11.700 --> 43:18.180]  quoted in and in his speeches and that the modern science that we follow in the
[43:18.180 --> 43:23.140]  bioethics and the Dr. Peter singers and the Dr. Eric Pionkas that called for
[43:23.140 --> 43:27.260]  world reductions of force 90% and one child I told you you'd hear on the news
[43:27.260 --> 43:31.460]  soon only have one kid kids are bad we need to have taxes on kids that's how
[43:31.460 --> 43:36.340]  it started in China US treaty George Herbert Walker Bush 1975 went signed
[43:36.340 --> 43:40.940]  memorandum 200 with the Chinese for IMF and World Bank money to carry out
[43:40.940 --> 43:49.620]  Eugenics all documented I made a film about an end game I just gave you
[43:49.620 --> 43:57.140]  memorandum 200 public declassified 1993 signed 1973 implemented in India
[43:57.140 --> 44:04.740]  China Peru many other nations in 1975 one child policy so you're right
[44:04.740 --> 44:12.100]  brother I'm not saying we're the Nazis I'm saying they got it from us Adolf
[44:12.100 --> 44:18.980]  Elois Hitler learned it all from the Eugenicist out of England and the
[44:18.980 --> 44:26.900]  United States period end of story into discussion I'm upset I'm mad about my
[44:26.900 --> 44:31.180]  life being ruined I want to take time off I don't want to have to work all the
[44:31.180 --> 44:35.020]  time but I can't stop because I got to fight these people and then people like
[44:35.020 --> 44:40.660]  you who think they're well-meaning and think they're patriotic call me a liar
[44:40.660 --> 44:45.540]  now I'm calling you and other people out you say I'm making it up that Florida
[44:45.540 --> 44:50.740]  CPS is run by pedophiles every few months that's in the news they always
[44:50.740 --> 45:00.260]  replace them with pedophiles my always in the last five years your IP we scanned
[45:00.260 --> 45:03.060]  it looks like it's coming out of Florida it may not the point is you're
[45:03.060 --> 45:08.940]  probably there at Centcom and you're disgusting I'm right about everything I
[45:08.940 --> 45:14.540]  said and I'm sorry you can't deal with reality little boy I'm sorry you can't
[45:14.540 --> 45:19.660]  deal with the facts little boy I'm sorry that you're afraid and you can't deal
[45:19.660 --> 45:23.380]  with reality and it's people like you that are in denial we're destroying our
[45:23.380 --> 45:31.820]  beloved country you talk about thanking you for our freedom why about you start
[45:31.820 --> 45:37.580]  defending our freedom no one can deny we're losing our bill of rights in
[45:37.580 --> 45:44.220]  Constitution no one can deny this country's fallen apart all right I'm
[45:44.220 --> 45:51.620]  gonna shut up about it I just I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on the economy
[45:51.620 --> 45:57.340]  though it's very important that look the fundamentals are there are factory
[45:57.340 --> 46:02.700]  shutdowns of what was left everywhere there are scores of businesses
[46:02.700 --> 46:08.380]  declaring bankruptcy large retailers going bankrupt everywhere fuel prices
[46:08.380 --> 46:10.780]  people say I don't care I'm a truck driver I don't care they're all going
[46:10.780 --> 46:15.820]  broke I know truck drivers I know a bunch of them and they are having to sell
[46:15.820 --> 46:18.700]  their trucks they're going on welfare a lot of them are vets they're going on
[46:18.700 --> 46:21.980]  disability their lives are over it's all over and the Mexican trucking
[46:21.980 --> 46:25.260]  companies they got people working for a third of what they do are taking over
[46:25.260 --> 46:31.740]  right here in Austin right now and by the way it's hurting the Raza because the
[46:31.740 --> 46:34.780]  Mexican truck drivers happen to be Americans they're losing their jobs too
[46:34.780 --> 46:43.020]  this is only the beginning and there's all this denial about it and the Federal
[46:43.020 --> 46:46.420]  Reserve that's engineered all this even the Financial Times of London admits it
[46:46.420 --> 46:52.420]  as it spreads globally now they're going to be given total immunity total power
[46:52.420 --> 46:57.140]  and they'll the private Fed will run the three federal agencies and will now
[46:57.140 --> 47:02.780]  have total control over us they engineered the depression after they get
[47:02.780 --> 47:06.380]  in power they get more power then they get even more power then they engineer
[47:06.380 --> 47:09.740]  another crisis they get more power that's what they do they always stage a
[47:09.740 --> 47:13.500]  terror attack get more control and stage an even bigger one their ruthless
[47:13.500 --> 47:21.500]  they're cunning that's why they're in control us foreclosures jump 57% in one
[47:21.500 --> 47:27.620]  month homeowners walk away Bloomberg us foreclosure failings you have 57% in
[47:27.620 --> 47:32.540]  bank repossesses more than doubled in March with a year earlier and adjustable
[47:32.540 --> 47:37.660]  mortgage is increased as more owners gave up their homes to lenders more than
[47:37.660 --> 47:45.740]  234,000 properties were in the stage of foreclosure or one in every 538 US
[47:45.740 --> 47:53.180]  households and it goes on that's each month that compounds oil rises to record
[47:53.180 --> 48:01.420]  $113 a barrel in the futures it's even higher New York
[48:01.420 --> 48:20.380]  mercantile has it 112 48 futures rose to 1.62 or 1.5 just amazing and
[48:20.380 --> 48:27.660]  meanwhile they're doing nothing to reverse this it's the dollar dropping
[48:27.660 --> 48:34.140]  that's making oil go up in price they need to raise interest rates to 15%
[48:34.140 --> 48:41.460]  right now throw the brakes on it's an emergency they need to sure that dollar
[48:41.460 --> 48:46.420]  up all they're doing is buying time instead this will just destroy the stock
[48:46.420 --> 48:50.140]  market when it finally hits and the yuppies are like no no no slash slash
[48:50.140 --> 49:00.060]  they've already cut it down to 2% there's nothing else they can do the IMF
[49:00.060 --> 49:04.380]  dumped tens of billions of dollars more yesterday on the market and still
[49:04.380 --> 49:08.660]  gold rose and now we bring in Ted Anderson he'll be with us into the next
[49:08.660 --> 49:16.060]  segment Ted gold bottomed out at 845 it's now rocketed and stayed the last few
[49:16.060 --> 49:21.700]  weeks at around 930 clearly now it's marching back upwards this is a big
[49:21.700 --> 49:28.980]  buying opportunity and every fundamental shows with oil at 113 and all the rest of
[49:28.980 --> 49:33.740]  this happening that gold is only going to go up if any market reality is in
[49:33.740 --> 49:40.380]  play here despite them hammering gold by dumping it on the market in the futures
[49:40.380 --> 49:45.220]  and in engaging in shorts and every other trick it is still exploding in
[49:45.220 --> 49:50.340]  price 10 it is it's going up like crazy Alex you know the thing about it is that
[49:50.340 --> 49:54.620]  you know it does fluctuate up and down we are looking at around 930 gold just
[49:54.620 --> 49:59.140]  like you said but we've come up off of that 600 level and just a few years ago
[49:59.140 --> 50:03.340]  up to offer that 300 level there was a big push for the central banks to keep
[50:03.340 --> 50:10.020]  gold below $400 amounts for a close to 30 years since 1980 and they did
[50:10.020 --> 50:13.060]  everything they could to keep it together like that until the country
[50:13.060 --> 50:17.860]  finally started to melt down so hard that the that the that the market said
[50:17.860 --> 50:21.620]  no we're going to buy the gold and it doesn't matter how much gold you dump
[50:21.620 --> 50:24.620]  into the marketplace we're still going to buy it and the person is going to go
[50:24.620 --> 50:29.780]  up the central banks are losing control over this thing and really like you said
[50:29.780 --> 50:32.700]  the only thing they can do is drive the value of the currency right through the
[50:32.700 --> 50:36.460]  floor I hear the music coming but yeah we'll talk about this on the other side
[50:36.460 --> 50:40.220]  because there's a lot of things that we're going on right now all right Ted
[50:40.220 --> 50:44.620]  stay there than our big NASA guest he worked in Air Force weapons development

[54:39.540 --> 54:41.540]  Alright, going back to Ted Anderson.
[54:41.540 --> 54:47.540]  Yeah, they're doing everything they can to suppress gold and other commodities
[54:47.540 --> 54:50.540]  because it does show the true inflation, but they can't.
[54:50.540 --> 54:54.540]  Oil's at $113 a barrel, pushing even higher.
[54:54.540 --> 54:57.540]  Gold's at $930 plus an ounce.
[54:57.540 --> 54:59.540]  Silver right up there at $19 an ounce.
[54:59.540 --> 55:07.540]  Everything is increasing and now they're having to admit serious, very serious inflation is upon us, Ted.
[55:07.540 --> 55:13.540]  Oh, there's no question about it, Alex. Every time we turn around there's an economic problem here in the United States.
[55:13.540 --> 55:19.540]  The people want to have the government bail it out by the printing of money.
[55:19.540 --> 55:26.540]  This economic stimulus package to bailing out the bankers that made these subprime loans,
[55:26.540 --> 55:32.540]  and that going into the prime loans, and then the whole thing, this whole house of cards is coming down right now.
[55:32.540 --> 55:37.540]  There's inflation coming because we've just basically, we've printed so much money
[55:37.540 --> 55:42.540]  that the value of the money is just going through the toilet and the value of commodities are going to go up.
[55:42.540 --> 55:47.540]  The market is demanding that that happens because there's too much money out there.
[55:47.540 --> 55:51.540]  You can't solve our economic problems by printing.
[55:51.540 --> 55:55.540]  And when you see that going on then you've got to duck.
[55:55.540 --> 55:59.540]  You've got to get away from the U.S. dollar, you also have to get away from paper assets.
[55:59.540 --> 56:03.540]  A company, a stock market, all that stuff is going to be incredible.
[56:03.540 --> 56:08.540]  Things are going to be hurting over there because of the fact that, yes, indeed, we'll have real high interest rates.
[56:08.540 --> 56:11.540]  The stock market's going to be in one heck of a bind.
[56:11.540 --> 56:16.540]  We have record foreclosures, the credit cards, everything is coming down.
[56:16.540 --> 56:21.540]  The whole, it all adds up at this time, Alex, and the Federal Reserve system can't,
[56:21.540 --> 56:27.540]  the central banks can't sell enough gold in order to suppress it so the prices continue to rise.
[56:27.540 --> 56:29.540]  And that's what we have right now.
[56:29.540 --> 56:36.540]  Gold will go on from 600 to 900 and even reaching into the 1,000 here just recently, obviously, indicates that.
[56:36.540 --> 56:43.540]  At this particular time, Alex, we do have some things that have locked in on prices at all.
[56:43.540 --> 56:48.540]  And comparatively speaking, a couple of years from now, you're going to look back and you're going to go,
[56:48.540 --> 56:51.540]  man, I wish I would have put everything ahead into this stuff.
[56:51.540 --> 56:59.540]  Silver right now is just in such a short supply that it's really difficult to maintain a good supply of things to sell.
[56:59.540 --> 57:06.540]  I was able to get into some silver dollars here recently just because of the fact that the market did back off a little bit
[57:06.540 --> 57:11.540]  and allowed for a little bit of inventory to loosen up and become available on the market here.
[57:11.540 --> 57:14.540]  So I do have silver dollars rolls right now at 578.
[57:14.540 --> 57:18.540]  I've got those British sovereigns right now at 257.
[57:18.540 --> 57:21.540]  I've got the French Frank at 205.
[57:21.540 --> 57:26.540]  All of those things right now are in really good buying shape right now.
[57:26.540 --> 57:32.540]  As far as getting into something in the marketplace, getting into small pieces of gold that you can use anywhere in the world,
[57:32.540 --> 57:38.540]  not just here in the United States, and it translates to buying food, clothing, shelter, all the things that you need.
[57:38.540 --> 57:42.540]  And the worst of economic times is the thing to be getting into at this point.
[57:42.540 --> 57:44.540]  And that's why I've been recommending this stuff.
[57:44.540 --> 57:48.540]  Absolutely, Ted. Tell them about the offer again and give them the toll-free number to call.
[57:48.540 --> 57:52.540]  Yeah, sure. The British sovereign right now is at 257.
[57:52.540 --> 57:55.540]  The French Frank right now is at 205.
[57:55.540 --> 57:59.540]  And the silver dollar rolls, that's rolls of 20 right now are at 578.
[57:59.540 --> 58:05.540]  You can give us a call at 1-800-686-2237.
[58:05.540 --> 58:10.540]  Again, I'll say it, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[58:10.540 --> 58:12.540]  Now is the time to be getting in.
[58:12.540 --> 58:19.540]  And to be clear, Ted, you locked in gold weeks and weeks ago when it was lower, so you're adding in that discount.
[58:19.540 --> 58:27.540]  Yep, sure are. This is a great time to be getting in, and you're also buying at a price that, you know, is close to like a 900 to 920 range.
[58:27.540 --> 58:43.540]  Absolutely, 1-800-686-2237. Gold is going up.
[58:43.540 --> 58:58.540]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[58:58.540 --> 59:13.540]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:13.540 --> 59:18.540]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:18.540 --> 59:22.540]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:22.540 --> 59:29.540]  I think America is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their app.

[59:53.540 --> 1:00:17.540]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:17.540 --> 1:00:31.540]  Hello, my friends. We are live coming up in the third hour today. We're going to have Andres von B端low join us. He was the defense minister, also the head of German technology, head of that office.
[1:00:31.540 --> 1:00:41.540]  He was also the head in parliament of their intelligence agency, their international spy agency. And for about five years, he has been writing and saying the 9-11 is an inside job.
[1:00:41.540 --> 1:00:49.540]  We were the first to interview him on U.S. radio five years ago. He'll be joining us again for a full hour from Germany in 60 minutes.
[1:00:49.540 --> 1:00:58.540]  Don't forget, we now also have a live fourth hour of the show from 2 to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[1:00:58.540 --> 1:01:04.540]  Now, Raymond, you want to go ahead today and use your full name? That would be all right.
[1:01:04.540 --> 1:01:11.540]  Okay, we'll go ahead and do that. I mean, I don't want to get anything too secret, but you can give us your quote opinion on things. Raymond, of course, is in the Air Force.
[1:01:11.540 --> 1:01:17.540]  He worked in Mission Control, the Apollo program. He worked with the cameras. I've known Raymond for about, I don't know, since 1999.
[1:01:17.540 --> 1:01:23.540]  So I guess about, I guess that's about nine years. A good friend of mine. He's even worked in this office before.
[1:01:23.540 --> 1:01:34.540]  You know, whenever I needed a little extra help on shipping and things because he's been retired, he is also an electrical engineer or some of the larger computer companies and engineering companies out there.
[1:01:34.540 --> 1:01:43.540]  And Raymond is our guest. He was dropping by the office last week, giving me some information. And I thought, why not just have Raymond in studio with us?
[1:01:43.540 --> 1:01:48.540]  And he's got a lot of material here that he's going to be talking about today.
[1:01:48.540 --> 1:01:53.540]  But first off, Raymond, I want to thank you for coming in studio with us.
[1:01:53.540 --> 1:01:56.540]  Well, you're quite welcome.
[1:01:56.540 --> 1:02:04.540]  Raymond, this is a short segment. As you know, as a listener to the show, start off a little bit about yourself, where you grew up, what you did, how you got involved in the Air Force and weapons development.
[1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:12.540]  Then you got into NASA, break that down, and then we'll come in and get into the meat and potatoes and show some of none of the classified documents in international.
[1:02:12.540 --> 1:02:19.540]  Well, is that like your national security letters or anything like that? But you know, news articles with you in it at NASA and photos and stuff like that.
[1:02:19.540 --> 1:02:23.540]  And what you think really went on with the Apollo program?
[1:02:23.540 --> 1:02:30.540]  Well, I was assigned to a military program called the MO program.
[1:02:30.540 --> 1:02:50.540]  And for my training, I was sent to mission control at the, at what was then the man spacecraft center since changed the name changed to Johnson spacecraft center to work in the Apollo program and to train as a controller for the military program.
[1:02:50.540 --> 1:03:05.540]  Well, I know hardly hit the dirt down in Houston. When the MO program was canceled, they were saying there will be no military program. It will all be a civilian controlled civilian program.
[1:03:05.540 --> 1:03:12.540]  I didn't believe that for one micro second, but they say 80% of the space program secret military, right?
[1:03:12.540 --> 1:03:30.540]  Well, I have, I have no, I've never worked on the other side of it, but I have had enough hiccups I've seen to believe that, that what has become the shuttle program is simply a diversion from the real program.
[1:03:30.540 --> 1:03:35.540]  That's what the former head of Star Wars, Dr. Bob Bowman said here on the show.
[1:03:35.540 --> 1:03:47.540]  Okay, Noah Tesla, Nikita. Well, but I mean, before we get into all that stuff, okay, I want to talk about you first, then I want to get into the stuff that you did do at NASA and what you think about the MO program.
[1:03:47.540 --> 1:03:56.540]  Okay, I want to keep us focused, Raymond. We can have you back on some of the other subjects or get into that once we've covered. But first, tell folks what the MO program was.
[1:03:56.540 --> 1:04:15.540]  Well, we were to, they were going to build a space station called the manned orbiting laboratory. Now this is very early. This is before the all the high technology and integrated circuits and the really miniaturized high powered computers.
[1:04:15.540 --> 1:04:30.540]  In fact, the instrument ring on the Saturn V, which had the computing power of something like a good size handheld computer, all transistor, transistor logic weighed 1400 pounds.
[1:04:30.540 --> 1:04:38.540]  And the same thing could be done with one integrated circuit chip today that weighs practically nothing.
[1:04:38.540 --> 1:04:48.540]  All right, Raymond, stay there. We'll be right back after this quick break. Everybody stay with us. This is the GCN radio network and the VidCams, the DocumentCams are live in studio.
[1:05:08.540 --> 1:05:25.540]  Nothing else compares to our product.

[1:08:13.540 --> 1:08:25.540]  Alright Raymond, in the 52 minutes we've got left, let's just try to move through this in some type of order so that we can cover as much as possible, and I really appreciate you coming in.
[1:08:25.540 --> 1:08:37.540]  Finish up with your credentials, what you did at NASA. You got them to the part of, you were in the military side of the program and then it gets canceled. Tell us the rest of your history at NASA, then we'll start breaking it down.
[1:08:37.540 --> 1:08:50.540]  Okay, all branches of the service had officers stationed at NASA, were assigned to this first special activity squadron, and we operated just like the civilians did.
[1:08:50.540 --> 1:09:01.540]  We had jobs working right beside them doing the same things, and there were people from the Army, people from the Navy, and people from the Air Force as myself.
[1:09:01.540 --> 1:09:05.540]  Now why had they sent you to NASA? What had you done previously in the Air Force?
[1:09:05.540 --> 1:09:10.540]  I started in pilot training.
[1:09:10.540 --> 1:09:13.540]  But then you said you'd worked on missile systems and guidance and things like that?
[1:09:13.540 --> 1:09:15.540]  Okay, that all came later.
[1:09:15.540 --> 1:09:17.540]  Okay, well I'm going to stop, go through your history, go ahead.
[1:09:17.540 --> 1:09:24.540]  Alright, as far as my history, working at the manned spacecraft and in the Johnson Spacecraft Center, same thing.
[1:09:24.540 --> 1:09:41.540]  I first worked on the Apollo program up through the Apollo 13 disaster, and we couldn't fly for some extended period of time, so the Air Force reassigned me.
[1:09:41.540 --> 1:09:51.540]  I wound up working in an intelligence branch, and then beyond that I went out of the Air Force and I worked for Lockheed in various phases,
[1:09:51.540 --> 1:10:01.540]  including, well, the first, I worked for the Radio Corporation of America onboard camera system, meaning the camera systems that were flown on the shuttle.
[1:10:01.540 --> 1:10:06.540]  They were very special. They were made to withstand the extreme temperature and the vacuum of space.
[1:10:06.540 --> 1:10:10.540]  Now let's go back now. Let's go back to your Apollo 13 mission.
[1:10:10.540 --> 1:10:15.540]  You've got photos, and I've even seen video of you there at Mission Control.
[1:10:15.540 --> 1:10:17.540]  You were on the second and first different modules.
[1:10:17.540 --> 1:10:26.540]  They've got three different systems, like the main one running the mission and then backups. Describe what you did on the Apollo missions for listeners out there.
[1:10:26.540 --> 1:10:40.540]  Well, I was in the guidance and control session and as a guidance officer, I helped formulate the maneuvers and plan what was to be done.
[1:10:40.540 --> 1:10:55.540]  During the mission, I had to update the spacecraft and the linear module computers with the next coordinates that were to be for the next burn and the next maneuver.
[1:10:55.540 --> 1:11:01.540]  There was a long list of numbers that had to be put in and checked very carefully to make sure that it was all correct.
[1:11:01.540 --> 1:11:10.540]  Then it was sent to one of three tracking stations around the world and uploaded to the spacecraft and into the spacecraft computers.
[1:11:10.540 --> 1:11:26.540]  And then when it came time to execute the burn and they put it on timers, it counted down and the amount of propulsion and whatever direction we were directed or the numbers indicated was what the velocity that was added to the spacecraft.
[1:11:26.540 --> 1:11:33.540]  And I helped do that and keep up with the paperwork.
[1:11:33.540 --> 1:11:43.540]  Now, let's stop before we run out of time. You've got a lot of things here from NASA news articles. Here's a NASA newspaper with you in it. Or do you want to get to that later?
[1:11:43.540 --> 1:12:00.540]  I have a bunch of paper that is quite interesting, but mainly stuff like this. I brought to show you that I was there since you never saw me. This is one picture I'm sitting in here and it tells you over here under number 17.
[1:12:00.540 --> 1:12:13.540]  Yeah, I know I've seen this before, Raymond. You forget you showed me this in your national security letters and diplomas and all that before. See, here you are right here. Try to show that on the document cam.
[1:12:13.540 --> 1:12:22.540]  This document cam's turned the wrong way. Let me just put it this way, Raymond. I can move it. Keep talking. It's okay.
[1:12:22.540 --> 1:12:38.540]  Anyway, what I was trying to tell you that as far as the program or the photographs being a hoax, I have no knowledge of faked photographs.
[1:12:38.540 --> 1:12:55.540]  However, I was later working on a program after I was out of the Air Force and after I'd already worked for RCA. I was working for Lockheed and I was assigned to a program that dealt with photography and I was a very good photographer.
[1:12:55.540 --> 1:13:00.540]  I had a photographer myself. I extended knowledge and background.
[1:13:00.540 --> 1:13:11.540]  And you later worked on the shuttle cameras too, so that's what you did. Yes, actually I worked on it for this case, but this case up, I was working on film photography at a section in NASA.
[1:13:11.540 --> 1:13:40.540]  Okay, and one of my primary jobs, believe it or not, was to go attend all of the meetings having to do with the space station and to be an Alex Jones on that, to stand up and raise heck and tell them that they could not have any film photography unless they put a lead lined film safe as part of the
[1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:46.540]  project against the structure of the space station.
[1:13:46.540 --> 1:13:57.540]  And that made everybody mad because I'd have to interrupt to do it and they didn't want to hear it, especially after they heard it the first, second, the third time or something like that.
[1:13:57.540 --> 1:14:08.540]  There's a bigger picture of you, but that's out of the newspaper and then the NASA newspaper and then here is, which one are you here in this photo?
[1:14:08.540 --> 1:14:13.540]  Right here.
[1:14:13.540 --> 1:14:32.540]  There we go. Right there. Anyway, the problem with the film on the shuttle is that if you had a lot of solar activity, it would cause the film to be degraded.
[1:14:32.540 --> 1:14:45.540]  Both before and after exposure didn't make any difference because the cosmic rays and the radiation from the sun would go through everything and make streaks in the film fog it out.
[1:14:45.540 --> 1:14:51.540]  And so film photography on the shuttle has been a problem.
[1:14:51.540 --> 1:14:58.540]  And that's not even getting out towards the Van Allen. That's just the radiation that's not being absorbed by the water in the atmosphere.
[1:14:58.540 --> 1:15:02.540]  I mean, that's just the sun's radiation.
[1:15:02.540 --> 1:15:06.540]  No, I know. That's what I'm saying. The atmosphere is what walks out that radiation.
[1:15:06.540 --> 1:15:09.540]  So just the sun radiation you're saying is messing up the film.
[1:15:09.540 --> 1:15:11.540]  Imagine what the Van Allen would do.
[1:15:11.540 --> 1:15:22.540]  Well, it's not only the Van Allen. The Van Allen captures our turns away from the earth a great deal of the damaging radiation and particles coming from the sun.
[1:15:22.540 --> 1:15:23.540]  That's what I meant.
[1:15:23.540 --> 1:15:34.540]  But the Van Allen belt is about 400 nautical miles in altitude. Approximately it's a range of like 100 miles or something like that thick.
[1:15:34.540 --> 1:15:40.540]  Well, my point was the shuttle's not up in the Van Allen, but it's still getting cosmic rays that are frying film.
[1:15:40.540 --> 1:15:42.540]  Yeah, it's there. You still get some proof.
[1:15:42.540 --> 1:15:43.540]  So we have proof.
[1:15:43.540 --> 1:15:44.540]  You're getting cosmic rays sitting right here.
[1:15:44.540 --> 1:15:51.540]  Exactly, but the on average 10 feet of water, if you condense it all, on average gives you some shield.
[1:15:51.540 --> 1:15:53.540]  Yes, you get most anyway.
[1:15:53.540 --> 1:15:57.540]  But Raymond, the reason I raise this point, of course, you're the engineer, so correct me if I'm wrong, an electrical engineer,
[1:15:57.540 --> 1:16:12.540]  that the shuttle is below the Van Allen, but still just the solar and rays predominantly and also a galactic rays that are coming in are still putting specs and lines all over the film.
[1:16:12.540 --> 1:16:21.540]  And so that's scientific proof that we wouldn't be getting clear photos from the moon because it's going to go all the way out from space to the moon and back.
[1:16:21.540 --> 1:16:29.540]  And as a scientific test and proof of that hypothesis, you're saying, and we do know, and it's even been in the press, that shuttle film is fried.
[1:16:29.540 --> 1:16:30.540]  Go ahead.
[1:16:30.540 --> 1:16:38.540]  Okay, now it depends on some the sun activity as to where the solar flares as to how much you get.
[1:16:38.540 --> 1:16:52.540]  You may not get almost nothing if the sun is very quiet or if the sun is having a very high activity, then you may very well wind up with the film that is very badly degraded.
[1:16:52.540 --> 1:17:05.540]  Now, I do have some pictures here, for instance, that would be very difficult to fake at the same time that we're taking on the Apollo missions like this right here.
[1:17:05.540 --> 1:17:12.540]  This would be very difficult, could be fake, but I'm sure was not.
[1:17:12.540 --> 1:17:13.540]  Keep going, Raymond.
[1:17:13.540 --> 1:17:25.540]  Okay, so I don't know why that you shouldn't say, well, we don't have all of the pictures we'd like to have because probably the film was spoiled by the radiation.
[1:17:25.540 --> 1:17:26.540]  Now, let's be clear.
[1:17:26.540 --> 1:17:28.540]  We have a frontline mission control fellow.
[1:17:28.540 --> 1:17:32.540]  Here's Raymond in the document cam right there on your screen.
[1:17:32.540 --> 1:17:37.540]  He was there, he believes that that he was running a mission.
[1:17:37.540 --> 1:17:39.540]  Everybody there believe they're running a mission.
[1:17:39.540 --> 1:17:41.540]  He was assigned for the military over there.
[1:17:41.540 --> 1:17:49.540]  But he is saying that he ran the film cameras on other missions and, of course, RCA video cameras where they could get the footage.
[1:17:49.540 --> 1:17:53.540]  And he's saying that that it's, are you saying it's a lie?
[1:17:53.540 --> 1:17:55.540]  What are you saying, Raymond?
[1:17:55.540 --> 1:18:13.540]  I'm saying that I don't know that personally that anything was fake, but at the same time on a later job, I had a legitimate job that there were real problems with getting filmed that was not radiation damaged.
[1:18:13.540 --> 1:18:17.540]  So you can't have it both ways and I'll let you decide for yourself.
[1:18:17.540 --> 1:18:23.540]  Well, talk more about that program that you were on with the specifics and what would happen with the film.
[1:18:23.540 --> 1:18:25.540]  Okay, I did not develop develop the film.
[1:18:25.540 --> 1:18:29.540]  I know that there were problems and we were told that we had to have a lead safe.
[1:18:29.540 --> 1:18:40.540]  Now, they had a lead safe on Skylab, which was at the end of the after Apollo 13, it was launched on Skylab.
[1:18:40.540 --> 1:18:52.540]  I mean, on a Saturn five and then later manned with another mission where supplies were taken up and they did have a heavy lead safe on that for the film.
[1:18:52.540 --> 1:19:00.540]  And they kept the film in that, except while it was being out and put in a camera being used, they kept it in safe.
[1:19:00.540 --> 1:19:06.540]  And they were supposed to do the same thing on the space station.
[1:19:06.540 --> 1:19:21.540]  Now the space station, well, getting back into this at the same time I was working on this Kodak and the naval department was working on digital cameras.
[1:19:21.540 --> 1:19:30.540]  And it is involved into what you find in the stores now that you can go into the photographic shops and target in Walmart.
[1:19:30.540 --> 1:19:40.540]  Stay there. We're going to come right back and later when you're working with RCA, you get an internal company newsletter about anti-grab and then they try to shut it all down and cover it up.
[1:19:40.540 --> 1:19:45.540]  We'll be right back with Raymond T. Ladies and gentlemen, we haven't even scratched the surface yet.
[1:19:45.540 --> 1:19:51.540]  You're going to want to stay with us for this. Engineer on the Apollo program and a lot more. We'll be right back.
[1:19:51.540 --> 1:19:55.540]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:19:55.540 --> 1:20:00.540]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:20:00.540 --> 1:20:06.540]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group. Could their objective be world domination?
[1:20:06.540 --> 1:20:19.540]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:19.540 --> 1:20:29.540]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:20:29.540 --> 1:20:36.540]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their app.

[1:23:50.540 --> 1:24:12.540]  Former German Defense Minister, former German Technology Minister, Head Technology Minister, former Head of German Intelligence, Andres Fambulo joining us in the next hour to expose the black cop that was carried out on 9-11.
[1:24:12.540 --> 1:24:25.540]  Going back to my friend Raymond Teague, electrical engineer. Raymond, why are you now, before, years ago, actually come on the show and you didn't want to do it, why now are you willing to come on the show?
[1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:42.540]  Well, I'm frankly tired of all the lies and hypocrisy and the damage being done to this country by operations like 9-11, and what I see going on as far as our trying to control the world to take over all the areas that have oil.
[1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:55.540]  For no reason when we could be producing our own oil, I have relatives in the oil field and know that we could be producing all the oil we want that is needed.
[1:24:55.540 --> 1:24:58.540]  Well, Alaska's admittedly got more than Saudi Arabia.
[1:24:58.540 --> 1:25:12.540]  If they would just turn it loose and allow someone to do it, and that's not the case. But anyway, there are other things about it. We're jumping around too much. Let's go back to the digital cameras.
[1:25:12.540 --> 1:25:41.540]  Okay, the camera business. While I was working with the film cameras for this department, I was also helping or I observed anyway, the work being done on the digital cameras, which now you can go in and buy the finest machines for a couple hundred dollars will buy you a really good digital camera with many automatic features.
[1:25:41.540 --> 1:25:53.540]  And you can spend almost any amount of money you want on one. But anyway, you can get some very fine results and they operate in near darkness.
[1:25:53.540 --> 1:26:12.540]  After I worked was out of the Air Force, and I went to work for the Radio Corporation of America when it still existed. It doesn't anymore. And they were the ones that built the cameras that were used on board the shuttle spacecraft.
[1:26:12.540 --> 1:26:25.540]  The cameras had to are very special. They had to withstand extreme vibration, high heat and cold. They had to be there. They were remotely operated.
[1:26:25.540 --> 1:26:32.540]  And they were in all specs very special and they cost a million dollars apiece.
[1:26:32.540 --> 1:26:48.540]  And there's lots of stories I could tell about that. Anyway, that was the most fun job I ever had. I had because that camera system was used in every operation done with the shuttle operation.
[1:26:48.540 --> 1:26:53.540]  Don't be nervous Raymond. It's okay. It's a lot easier when we're sitting around eating dinner. Tell me all this.
[1:26:53.540 --> 1:27:11.540]  So with a half a dozen people that were involved in this, what was amounted to a satellite RCA office where we maintained and did all the astronaut training, helped with all the experiments.
[1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:23.540]  I got involved in everything that was going on with the shuttle through the until 1983.
[1:27:23.540 --> 1:27:44.540]  Anyway, the digital camera cameras are an enormous convenience in that if you have something wrong or you want something to take a picture of damage or a problem on board the shuttle, you can take it with a digital camera or on the space station.
[1:27:44.540 --> 1:27:56.540]  And send the radio or telemetry the picture down and it can be examined on the ground immediately. There's no delay.
[1:27:56.540 --> 1:28:05.540]  And this is an enormous problem. This is an enormous advantage when trying to solve any problems where you need help of engineers on the ground.
[1:28:05.540 --> 1:28:09.540]  And there is no radiation damage.
[1:28:09.540 --> 1:28:21.540]  So going back, you didn't have those during Apollo though. That's right. These did not. And they're claiming that their film cameras, these pristine big glossies, hundreds and hundreds of them totaling the missions, thousands from the moon with no damage on them.
[1:28:21.540 --> 1:28:29.540]  As an engineer who worked with these cameras, who worked on the program, who worked on Apollo on all of it, is this a lot of bull?
[1:28:29.540 --> 1:28:34.540]  I don't see how it is possible to have escaped any damage to the photographs.
[1:28:34.540 --> 1:28:47.540]  Now, you've probably told me what the Scuttlebud is, though you weren't on those secret programs, that they do have, and we know they have secret programs, that they have the space planes, all of it, and that this was all basically a PR front.
[1:28:47.540 --> 1:28:49.540]  But, I mean, can you talk about that?
[1:28:49.540 --> 1:28:53.540]  Well, let's see. One of the things that happened of many.
[1:28:53.540 --> 1:29:09.540]  I have the RCA put out a monthly newsletter. A company newsletter, like most companies do, that has a large number of employees scattered at multiple installations. You get a newsletter from the company that tells you basically what's going on in the company and so forth.
[1:29:09.540 --> 1:29:19.540]  I got one that told about an engineer about an experiment they did where they flew an object around that this object canceled gravity.
[1:29:19.540 --> 1:29:26.540]  Stay there, okay? And then we're going to get into the secret space program as much as you can get into it, little bits and pieces you picked up.
[1:29:26.540 --> 1:29:36.540]  But this is already huge news, ladies and gentlemen. Engineer, frontline, NASA, Apollo program, working in the optics, working in the photos, saying it's impossible.
[1:29:36.540 --> 1:29:41.540]  We'll be right back. In fact, we're going to continue talking for President Planet TV members during the break.
[1:29:41.540 --> 1:29:51.540]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:51.540 --> 1:29:59.540]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out. For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[1:29:59.540 --> 1:30:03.540]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[1:30:03.540 --> 1:30:12.540]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore. This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70, 80% of the disease that we see.
[1:30:12.540 --> 1:30:22.540]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[1:30:22.540 --> 1:30:29.540]  It's a well-thought-out formula. I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[1:30:29.540 --> 1:30:35.540]  I find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems. It'll work on other problems as well.

[1:33:02.540 --> 1:33:17.540]  Continuing back to you get this internal but it's still not secret RCA for employees spread out at installations all over the country in the world. You get this newsletter. Tell the story in more detail.
[1:33:17.540 --> 1:33:34.540]  Well, anyway, I get this letter where they're able to fly this object around in an experiment. So I thought, well, this is great. And why are we wasting our time with rocket propulsion? We should be working on this. So I call up the and they were specific and they said it was canceling gravity.
[1:33:34.540 --> 1:33:49.540]  Yes. Okay. Anyway, and they totally denied it was true. They even denied the article was there, even though I had it right in my hands. So it got down to the point where there was no new used to arguing with them. There was nothing I could do about it.
[1:33:49.540 --> 1:34:00.540]  I couldn't get my hands around their throat and ring or necks like I would have liked. Do you still have that? No, I don't. I don't know where it is. I have it somewhere. I know how it is. Yeah, I can't find half my stuff.
[1:34:00.540 --> 1:34:17.540]  But anyway, they denied it. And, like I said, North East law had run the same type of experiments earlier. And even though the shuttle is an impressive device, and I sat on all the contractor meetings.
[1:34:17.540 --> 1:34:23.540]  Well, Werner von Braun drew that in the early 30s. I mean, von Braun had this shuttle concept for Hitler.
[1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:41.540]  Okay, anyway, they had all these contracts, contractors like Lockheed Grumman, you name every Boeing, every one of the major airframe builders made a proposal that had the shuttle.
[1:34:41.540 --> 1:34:56.540]  Our shuttle type crash flying on something that looked like a 747. And these only had regular jet engines. They had ramjets and so forth. The idea was to get the shuttle as high and fast as possible.
[1:34:56.540 --> 1:35:04.540]  Have it take off on its own internal fuel tank and propulsion system and have a recoverable system. Spaceplane.
[1:35:04.540 --> 1:35:13.540]  It would be a spaceplane that would be launched off the back of a 747 type.
[1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:16.540]  Now you've got a whole bag of documents photos.
[1:35:16.540 --> 1:35:29.540]  Yeah, I was looking at a photo for the shuttle on the back of a 747. But anyway, that is quite doable. But the 747 is not fast enough and ours intended well.
[1:35:29.540 --> 1:35:39.540]  In first place, the shuttle is launched with an enormous and very expensive fuel tank that holds liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.
[1:35:39.540 --> 1:35:40.540]  That's the center, right?
[1:35:40.540 --> 1:35:51.540]  That is the huge fuel tank that the shuttle looks like a bug on the side of and it has a huge, two huge solid rocket motors on either side to lift it on launch.
[1:35:51.540 --> 1:36:01.540]  It would burn for two and a half minutes. Okay, that was never intended to be the case.
[1:36:01.540 --> 1:36:16.540]  And it violated most of NASA's safety policies as far as the danger of having working with and having a solid rocket segments because they used a perchlorate rubber or sulfur type fuel.
[1:36:16.540 --> 1:36:25.540]  I don't know what the exact composition was. It had a lot of aluminum and perchlorate in it, potassium chlorate.
[1:36:25.540 --> 1:36:41.540]  If you dropped a wrench or something on a segment that was sitting around the launch facility, and I was down there on some trips or on business on the cameras, you would actually cause it to ignite.
[1:36:41.540 --> 1:36:45.540]  It was percursive sensitive if you hit it hard enough.
[1:36:45.540 --> 1:36:52.540]  Well, Raymond, listen, we've only got about 25 minutes and I'm going to have you back in, but you've got this big bag of photos, things.
[1:36:52.540 --> 1:36:56.540]  Show folks the mug, and then let's get into some of the other things that are going on.
[1:36:56.540 --> 1:36:58.540]  Show people your NASA mug.
[1:36:58.540 --> 1:37:00.540]  Well, that's just a personal item.
[1:37:00.540 --> 1:37:02.540]  I don't know, but you brought this stuff in. It's interesting.
[1:37:02.540 --> 1:37:03.540]  Okay.
[1:37:03.540 --> 1:37:05.540]  Hold it up for the camera. Show folks.
[1:37:05.540 --> 1:37:15.540]  This is one of the items that the people that worked in the mission control center, God, I think we paid like $25 for something like that.
[1:37:15.540 --> 1:37:20.540]  Somebody made a kind of, but it does have my name on it and what it was about.
[1:37:20.540 --> 1:37:25.540]  So that is a personal souvenir.
[1:37:25.540 --> 1:37:29.540]  Well, I appreciate you bringing all these mementos in, everybody.
[1:37:29.540 --> 1:37:35.540]  I brought a trailer load of them, but...
[1:37:35.540 --> 1:37:44.540]  Anyway, the contractors all came in with...
[1:37:44.540 --> 1:37:47.540]  Yeah, go through all the suspicious stuff. I mean, I know you're going to have to tell us how...
[1:37:47.540 --> 1:37:58.540]  They were going to do it right, and we were going to have a totally reusable shuttle, but the price in 1970 dollars was going to be in the billions of dollars
[1:37:58.540 --> 1:38:01.540]  to get it all done.
[1:38:01.540 --> 1:38:10.540]  Now, the thing that you all have missed that nobody paid any attention to that really just fried me and everyone else was...
[1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:18.540]  Robert McNamara canceled the production of the Saturn V booster.
[1:38:18.540 --> 1:38:21.540]  And when he did that, he killed the space program.
[1:38:21.540 --> 1:38:31.540]  It would be more than 10 years, they knew at least before we had anything that would fly into space like the shuttle development and testing that had to be done.
[1:38:31.540 --> 1:38:33.540]  The Saturn was an amazing lifter.
[1:38:33.540 --> 1:38:38.540]  That's right, and only that, but it was relatively inexpensive.
[1:38:38.540 --> 1:38:49.540]  It burned kerosene and liquid oxygen at least for the first two stages, and then the S4B, the top third stage propulsion stage of it, was liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.
[1:38:49.540 --> 1:38:58.540]  But at any rate, he not only had the production stopped, he had the tooling destroyed and the drawings destroyed.
[1:38:58.540 --> 1:39:01.540]  This, to me, amounted to high treason.
[1:39:01.540 --> 1:39:02.540]  Sabotage.
[1:39:02.540 --> 1:39:07.540]  Yes, and I'm sure he didn't do that on his own.
[1:39:07.540 --> 1:39:16.540]  They, for some reason, changed their mind about flying heavy objects into space, and we still can't duplicate with the shuttle what the Saturn V would do.
[1:39:16.540 --> 1:39:17.540]  Now they're talking about...
[1:39:17.540 --> 1:39:20.540]  Why did they destroy the Nazi drawings that Werner Rohn-Bron did?
[1:39:20.540 --> 1:39:23.540]  Do you know he came up with the Saturn V?
[1:39:23.540 --> 1:39:25.540]  This is one of the big mysteries.
[1:39:25.540 --> 1:39:31.540]  They apparently did not want to publicly fly in space like we had been.
[1:39:31.540 --> 1:39:33.540]  They wanted to end the lunar program.
[1:39:33.540 --> 1:39:40.540]  The last three of the Saturn Vs, they put one on display horizontally at Johnson Space Center.
[1:39:40.540 --> 1:39:46.540]  They put one in Huntsville, Alabama, Redstone Arsenal, and one at the Kennedy installation.
[1:39:46.540 --> 1:39:48.540]  So that was the last three of them.
[1:39:48.540 --> 1:39:51.540]  So this is more evidence of how they've really got another secret program.
[1:39:51.540 --> 1:39:54.540]  And now they admit they have space planes, they just won't let us see them.
[1:39:54.540 --> 1:40:08.540]  I personally believe, without any evidence, that that was really the start of whatever we have for a secret program because by that time they developed the necessary biological equipment.
[1:40:08.540 --> 1:40:19.540]  You have to keep yourself alive in space if you're going to send men in there and they have to be on Apollo, we used pure oxygen at 5 psi,
[1:40:19.540 --> 1:40:29.540]  which gave the equivalent or a little more than the equivalent of breathing 21% oxygen at 15 psi or 14.7, the atmospheric pressure.
[1:40:29.540 --> 1:40:48.540]  And many of the problems that we encountered were solved and also computers came along, the integrated circuits and things that were made miniaturization possible and life possible to sustain a human in space,
[1:40:48.540 --> 1:40:51.540]  which is one of the most difficult things to do.
[1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:58.540]  It is far cheaper to build like JPL does, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, robots that go out.
[1:40:58.540 --> 1:41:03.540]  That way you don't have to carry any food, you don't have to carry any air, water, anything to sustain a human.
[1:41:03.540 --> 1:41:17.540]  That's what Dr. Bob Bowman said, is that there's robot craft and that for at least, what do you say, about 27 years that there is already military stealth space plane aircraft.
[1:41:17.540 --> 1:41:25.540]  And again, they drop solid DU weapons in the gravity wells to be going about 25, 28,000 miles an hour.
[1:41:25.540 --> 1:41:30.540]  And that, now understand, it's not nuclear, there's not a reaction happening.
[1:41:30.540 --> 1:41:36.540]  It's just that the solid core, it's a meteor gun.
[1:41:36.540 --> 1:41:37.540]  It's really what it is.
[1:41:37.540 --> 1:41:40.540]  That's what he says the weapon platforms they've got are.
[1:41:40.540 --> 1:41:41.540]  That's super high classified.
[1:41:41.540 --> 1:41:45.540]  You know, he ran that program up before they made it public under Reagan.
[1:41:45.540 --> 1:41:47.540]  Okay, I have never worked on it.
[1:41:47.540 --> 1:41:49.540]  I do know these cannon shells.
[1:41:49.540 --> 1:41:55.540]  I've been on tests that that are made out of DU, you could buy the projectiles at gun shows.
[1:41:55.540 --> 1:42:00.540]  In fact, I've handled them, which I shouldn't have learned later.
[1:42:00.540 --> 1:42:12.540]  We're about three quarters of an inch or an inch in diameter and they were about like 14 inches long, but they weighed about 50, 60 pounds and just like a small arrow, but they move.
[1:42:12.540 --> 1:42:22.540]  They have a sabbath or a plastic case around it and they can be launched at 5 or 6,000 feet per second.
[1:42:22.540 --> 1:42:25.540]  Yeah, that Abrams has that the Vulcan gun in the 810.
[1:42:25.540 --> 1:42:28.540]  And they will literally go through both sides of a turret of a tank.
[1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:31.540]  Well, what Bowman said is it's an assassination weapon.
[1:42:31.540 --> 1:42:39.540]  You can have somebody, you know, who is 600 feet in a bunker and you drop one of these solid DU weapons in the gravity well.
[1:42:39.540 --> 1:42:42.540]  It gets accelerations you can never get in the atmosphere.
[1:42:42.540 --> 1:42:45.540]  And he was talking about 28,000 miles an hour.
[1:42:45.540 --> 1:42:50.540]  Can you imagine what that solid DU bomb does at 28,000 miles an hour?
[1:42:50.540 --> 1:43:03.540]  Well, this very, very dense material apparently holds together enough to go through almost anything that is less dense than itself and it causes enormous destruction.
[1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:05.540]  Well, it's meant as a global decapitation.
[1:43:05.540 --> 1:43:10.540]  They can find out whoever they want to kill where they're at, they got the attack craft all circling the planet at any one time.
[1:43:10.540 --> 1:43:14.540]  Supposedly there's quite a few of these babies and that's when he was there 20 plus years ago.
[1:43:14.540 --> 1:43:16.540]  Can you imagine what they've got now, Raymond?
[1:43:16.540 --> 1:43:20.540]  And that brings me to the next thing where we get more into speculative stuff or what you can or can't say on air.
[1:43:20.540 --> 1:43:23.540]  I know you're very nervous doing this and I appreciate it, Raymond.
[1:43:23.540 --> 1:43:31.540]  Going back here, now if you're working on the Apollo program, they bring back these photos that have to be fake in your words.
[1:43:31.540 --> 1:43:35.540]  What do you think was really going on with the space program then?
[1:43:35.540 --> 1:43:42.540]  Because that's what others have set off record is that this was just a cover for a real space program and that they could have just been in orbit.
[1:43:42.540 --> 1:43:47.540]  And then you guys were fed fake info from another mission control or how could that happen, Raymond?
[1:43:47.540 --> 1:43:49.540]  What do you think really happened?
[1:43:49.540 --> 1:43:52.540]  No, I think what we did, what we thought we were doing, we were doing.
[1:43:52.540 --> 1:44:03.540]  I'm just saying that there was probably, I got kept getting indications to me that the money was really being spent on something else.
[1:44:03.540 --> 1:44:18.540]  And that the basic research and ability to maintain humans in an artificial environment existed, but I have no positive proof and did not work on any of it.
[1:44:18.540 --> 1:44:25.540]  But let me show you, well, an example, the space station, I worked on several phases of that.
[1:44:25.540 --> 1:44:28.540]  There's almost out of time, just cover all the key points.
[1:44:28.540 --> 1:44:35.540]  Okay, the science fiction writers had space stations that were wheels and these wheels on the outside would be spinning.
[1:44:35.540 --> 1:44:42.540]  You'd have a hub that was stationary in the center that you would dock to have your solar cells on and you would have artificial gravity on the outside.
[1:44:42.540 --> 1:44:50.540]  So you didn't have to worry about the blood chemistry changes and the effects of being weightless for long periods of time on the crew.
[1:44:50.540 --> 1:44:51.540]  More German technology.
[1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:55.540]  That was not, that has not been done to date to my knowledge.
[1:44:55.540 --> 1:44:58.540]  It hasn't publicly been done.
[1:44:58.540 --> 1:45:10.540]  As far as these weapons Alex is talking about, I don't know about them, but what makes me very angry is we have, what is the date I need to put my glasses on on that?
[1:45:10.540 --> 1:45:12.540]  This is March 4th, 2008.
[1:45:12.540 --> 1:45:14.540]  The Austin American statesman.
[1:45:14.540 --> 1:45:21.540]  And down here they say, US Navy hits Somali home in attack on terrorism suspect.
[1:45:21.540 --> 1:45:24.540]  Well, it just tells where they launched two missiles.
[1:45:24.540 --> 1:45:26.540]  At a suspect.
[1:45:26.540 --> 1:45:37.540]  At a suspect, at the cost, these missiles cost at least a million dollars a piece and probably several million to wipe out some shack and kill.
[1:45:37.540 --> 1:45:48.540]  Not only maybe the suspect if he was there, but also everyone else around within quite a few yards and Congress has not declared war on Somali.
[1:45:48.540 --> 1:45:53.540]  They haven't declared war and they go ahead and this is not the only case.
[1:45:53.540 --> 1:45:55.540]  They keep hitting things.
[1:45:55.540 --> 1:46:01.540]  If they want to blow something away, it is very disturbing to me that we could just go randomly.
[1:46:01.540 --> 1:46:13.540]  Like if I didn't like somebody in Austin, I go burn their house down or go shoot it up or something without any real authority to do that.
[1:46:13.540 --> 1:46:15.540]  And we've gotten to be.
[1:46:15.540 --> 1:46:17.540]  Oh, it's totally lawless.
[1:46:17.540 --> 1:46:25.540]  I mean, there were like 15 news articles last week where they said, okay, the FBI admits they're reading all the emails and everything and no warrants and it's non-terror related.
[1:46:25.540 --> 1:46:31.540]  And there's no fourth amendment and states are announcing, yeah, we're not going to have warrants anymore.
[1:46:31.540 --> 1:46:35.540]  I mean, it's just, and now they're coming to doors asking if they can have your guns or what you got.
[1:46:35.540 --> 1:46:38.540]  I mean, this is just twilight zone, Raymond.
[1:46:38.540 --> 1:46:45.540]  Well, this is, I've said there was the destruction, the destruction of our people and our country.
[1:46:45.540 --> 1:46:55.540]  And as you see this statesman article where the Bilderberg CFR member, Bob, it says everything must go is the headline. We, the people, it's a constitution ripped in half with a burned edge.
[1:46:55.540 --> 1:46:58.540]  How to fight terrorism. And then they say in here, yeah, get rid of freedom.
[1:46:58.540 --> 1:47:01.540]  We got to get, it says get rid of the Constitution, get rid of national sovereignty.
[1:47:01.540 --> 1:47:04.540]  That's the way to help America.
[1:47:04.540 --> 1:47:06.540]  Also, the drug must go.
[1:47:06.540 --> 1:47:07.540]  Everything must go.
[1:47:07.540 --> 1:47:09.540]  And then they show the.
[1:47:09.540 --> 1:47:19.540]  We could, the government has denatured alcohol to keep people from using liquor that has not been taxed and controlled by them for many years.
[1:47:19.540 --> 1:47:22.540]  And I'd like Alex probably doesn't want me to bring it up.
[1:47:22.540 --> 1:47:33.540]  So I'll wait, but there, there's a program we could have all of the drugs denatured to where people would not use them without authorization or where we had some sort of a program.
[1:47:33.540 --> 1:47:49.540]  And it would be very easy to do and it would probably be easy to do conducted by the people who didn't like our military and our drug lords are our gangsters in their country running their agricultural program.
[1:47:49.540 --> 1:47:51.540]  No, I don't even know.
[1:47:51.540 --> 1:47:52.540]  I'm ignorant.
[1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:57.540]  I don't know how you go and block cocoa unless you create a bio weapon that goes after cocoa plants.
[1:47:57.540 --> 1:48:02.540]  Well, I'll talk to you all fair about it, but it'd be very easy to do.
[1:48:02.540 --> 1:48:12.540]  You would not have to, you would not have to employ demolition incorporated and half the CIA and the Mossad and truckloads of thermite and explosives to do something.
[1:48:12.540 --> 1:48:19.540]  It could literally be done in a cave in Afghanistan or out in the Amazon jungle quite easily.
[1:48:19.540 --> 1:48:21.540]  Well, tell me whatever this is later.
[1:48:21.540 --> 1:48:23.540]  But, but here we have the statesman.
[1:48:23.540 --> 1:48:24.540]  Everything must go.
[1:48:24.540 --> 1:48:28.540]  And then they show the bill of rights being cut in half and it says it's how you fight terrorism.
[1:48:28.540 --> 1:48:29.540]  You get rid of freedom.
[1:48:29.540 --> 1:48:39.540]  See, the Constitution is in the way of your freedom in this image is that wicked, you know, you know, that wicked Constitution is in the way of fighting terrorism.
[1:48:39.540 --> 1:48:44.540]  But by hacking the Constitution in half, now they can fight terrorism.
[1:48:44.540 --> 1:48:46.540]  And the headline is everything must go.
[1:48:46.540 --> 1:48:47.540]  Got to get rid of that.
[1:48:47.540 --> 1:48:48.540]  We the people.
[1:48:48.540 --> 1:48:51.540]  I mean, they're so out in the open and they say they're patriots.
[1:48:51.540 --> 1:49:00.540]  Okay, let me tell you about some more about the space program you that has that you don't know about her.
[1:49:00.540 --> 1:49:06.540]  I worked at a Ford plant in Lorraine, Ohio while I was going through college that worked my way through there.
[1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:11.540]  Anyway, coming back from a date at two o'clock in the morning on clear, crisp.
[1:49:11.540 --> 1:49:17.540]  I think it was July or early August night and what was probably 1964.
[1:49:17.540 --> 1:49:21.540]  This is before the military, before and after.
[1:49:21.540 --> 1:49:22.540]  Yeah, right.
[1:49:22.540 --> 1:49:23.540]  Before all of this.
[1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:25.540]  Before I graduated from school.
[1:49:25.540 --> 1:49:27.540]  I am.
[1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:42.540]  We lived kind of out in a rural area, but it was only about 250 yards from my parents' house to the Ohio Turnpike, which was a paid interstate 35 is what it amount toro.
[1:49:42.540 --> 1:49:48.540]  And I looked over about 100 yards away from me and there was an object about six feet in diameter.
[1:49:48.540 --> 1:49:50.540]  It was only about three top high.
[1:49:50.540 --> 1:50:02.540]  And it was roaming around and they kind of followed a zigzag course, but generally it went over the trees over observing the Ohio Turnpike.
[1:50:02.540 --> 1:50:04.540]  And I watched it as long as I could.
[1:50:04.540 --> 1:50:05.540]  I watched it out of sight.
[1:50:05.540 --> 1:50:08.540]  Well, now they on TV have drones that look just like that.
[1:50:08.540 --> 1:50:13.540]  Let me, anyhow, I thought about reporting it, but I didn't.
[1:50:13.540 --> 1:50:27.540]  And I thought about shooting it down, but I didn't do that either because I'd had to wake the whole household up, grab my only center fire rifle or three or three British infield at the time and grab ammunition, get somebody to drive me up to fire on it.
[1:50:27.540 --> 1:50:29.540]  And that would have been, it would have been too late.
[1:50:29.540 --> 1:50:31.540]  I couldn't arrange that fast enough.
[1:50:31.540 --> 1:50:33.540]  One and two.
[1:50:33.540 --> 1:50:45.540]  Anyway, the next day it was reported as having been all over northern Ohio, including going through the turnstiles at the tow on the tow road boost.
[1:50:45.540 --> 1:50:47.540]  And then comes along there.
[1:50:47.540 --> 1:50:48.540]  Stay there.
[1:50:48.540 --> 1:50:51.540]  They were, they were testing some type of surveillance platform right back.
[1:50:51.540 --> 1:50:53.540]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[1:50:53.540 --> 1:50:57.540]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:50:57.540 --> 1:50:59.540]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:50:59.540 --> 1:51:03.540]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:51:03.540 --> 1:51:08.540]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order master plan.
[1:51:08.540 --> 1:51:13.540]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:51:13.540 --> 1:51:18.540]  In the info war, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[1:51:52.540 --> 1:51:58.540]  In fact, rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[1:51:58.540 --> 1:52:03.540]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[1:52:03.540 --> 1:52:06.540]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design.
[1:52:06.540 --> 1:52:10.540]  But because of the polluted world in which we live is unable to remove all toxins.

[1:52:52.540 --> 1:52:55.540]  Alright Dad, let me get this straight.
[1:52:55.540 --> 1:52:57.540]  Uncivil liberties takes place in the future, right?
[1:52:57.540 --> 1:52:58.540]  Like Star Wars?
[1:52:58.540 --> 1:53:00.540]  Yeah, that's right. Slightly in the future.
[1:53:00.540 --> 1:53:01.540]  Wait a second.
[1:53:01.540 --> 1:53:04.540]  I thought Star Wars took place a long, long time ago.
[1:53:04.540 --> 1:53:08.540]  Alright, Einstein, but it is kind of like Star Wars anyway.
[1:53:08.540 --> 1:53:15.540]  Just like Star Wars, there's an evil empire and some people have started an armed rebellion to fight the evil empire.
[1:53:15.540 --> 1:53:18.540]  Okay, so don't tell me. The government's the bad guys again?
[1:53:18.540 --> 1:53:19.540]  Yep, that's right.
[1:53:19.540 --> 1:53:22.540]  Oh, so your character's like Luke Skywalker.
[1:53:22.540 --> 1:53:23.540]  Not exactly.
[1:53:23.540 --> 1:53:25.540]  I know! You're Chewbacca!
[1:53:25.540 --> 1:53:26.540]  Not really.
[1:53:26.540 --> 1:53:34.540]  But my character does help the rebellion to stop the government's evil tracking system, which is happening now in the real world, just like in Uncivil Liberties.
[1:53:34.540 --> 1:53:37.540]  Wait a second. They can't track us. It's a free country.
[1:53:37.540 --> 1:53:38.540]  Exactly.
[1:54:08.540 --> 1:54:10.540]  And I really appreciate you coming in and spending time.
[1:54:10.540 --> 1:54:27.540]  Huge revelation that from somebody who worked not just in NASA on Mission Control with the Apollo program, but somebody who worked with the film, with the color film, then with the digital cameras in shuttle experiments where the radiation was frying it, much less the Van Allen radiation belt.
[1:54:27.540 --> 1:54:32.540]  And that's what people have always pointed out, but you still believe they went to the moon. You just say it's a major mystery.
[1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:46.540]  And so, again, not conspiracy theories here. We just cover the facts. But getting back to this then being reported in Ohio, this little six foot around disk flying around, now the government admits they have those and have had them for decades.
[1:54:46.540 --> 1:54:53.540]  Anyway, this object changed brightness from very, very bright red to a very, very dull orange.
[1:54:53.540 --> 1:55:06.540]  And I have run experiments myself where you take a lamp, filament, bias it just barely on, and then you can put an audio wave on it and be able to pick it up with a detector and understand the audio and audio frequencies.
[1:55:06.540 --> 1:55:25.540]  However, what I was saying, this gadget was reported all over, but when we got the motion picture came out, close encounters of the third kind, they showed almost a perfect representation of this gadget flying around that I saw.
[1:55:25.540 --> 1:55:29.540]  Now, we've talked privately, you believe that's government programs, correct?
[1:55:29.540 --> 1:55:39.540]  I don't know what to think about it. It's obviously a robot from somebody. I don't know whether it's from here or originates with another culture.
[1:55:39.540 --> 1:55:50.540]  I believe that from the Philadelphia experiment, there are other timeframes parallel, you might say universes are times that can be transferred.
[1:55:50.540 --> 1:55:55.540]  And Einstein's equations and others show that those dimensions exist.
[1:55:55.540 --> 1:56:03.540]  You're right. I have seen other UFOs and identified flying objects. I've never seen any of the reported really huge ones.
[1:56:03.540 --> 1:56:05.540]  Like we've been seeing up in Dallas.
[1:56:05.540 --> 1:56:16.540]  Like it's been seen up in Dallas, yes, and didn't, but at any rate, somebody is flying something out there that is not publicly known.
[1:56:16.540 --> 1:56:19.540]  Yeah, no kidding. Who knows what's really going on?
[1:56:19.540 --> 1:56:25.540]  Very interesting with your work on the Apollo program. And next time we get you back, maybe we can get a little bit more into some of the other areas.
[1:56:25.540 --> 1:56:30.540]  I know you've been nervous today, but you've covered quite a bit. And Raymond T, good friend of mine. Thank you for coming in.
[1:56:30.540 --> 1:56:32.540]  Quite welcome.
[1:56:32.540 --> 1:56:35.540]  Raymond, again, let's set you up in the next month or so to come back in for an hour.
[1:56:35.540 --> 1:56:36.540]  Okay.
[1:56:36.540 --> 1:56:38.540]  And then maybe two hours, maybe take phone calls.
[1:56:38.540 --> 1:56:43.540]  I need to talk to you about what I was talking about, the nature of that.
[1:56:43.540 --> 1:56:48.540]  Well, you know what, call me tonight because I got Andre Sambulo coming up right after this break.
[1:56:48.540 --> 1:56:50.540]  So, well, we'll talk soon, Raymond.
[1:56:50.540 --> 1:56:51.540]  Thank you, my friend.
[1:56:51.540 --> 1:56:55.540]  You bet. Yeah, and your stuff's all over the place in here. Let's make sure we don't lose any of this.
[1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:58.540]  Raymond, thank you for coming in.

[1:57:02.540 --> 1:57:11.540]  We're going to get Andre Sambulo on from Germany coming in hot on the next segment after we end this hour.

[1:58:51.540 --> 1:58:56.540]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Put their objective being world domination.
[1:58:56.540 --> 1:59:10.540]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:10.540 --> 1:59:15.540]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[1:59:19.540 --> 1:59:22.540]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[1:59:22.540 --> 1:59:27.540]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their after easy.

[2:00:09.540 --> 2:00:15.540]  Andres von B端low is our guest for the next hour. We're very honored to have this esteemed guest with us.
[2:00:15.540 --> 2:00:28.540]  He is a German writer, lawyer, former SPD politician. He has been working on books about intelligence agencies, including in the name of the state CIA, BND and the criminal machinations of secret services.
[2:00:28.540 --> 2:00:37.540]  He has also written a book that's been the bestseller in Germany, the CIA in September 11th. He possesses a doctorate injurious prudence.
[2:00:37.540 --> 2:00:52.540]  He served as the secretary, a state secretary in the German Federal Ministry of Defense, 1976 and 1980, and minister for research and technology, 1980 to 82, both during Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's administration.
[2:00:52.540 --> 2:01:01.540]  And was regarded as a rising star of German politics at the time. He served for 25 years as an SPD member of the German parliament until 94.
[2:01:01.540 --> 2:01:11.540]  In the late 80s and early 90s, he served as a parliamentary committee on intelligence services. This committee supervised German intelligence agencies and has access to classified information.
[2:01:11.540 --> 2:01:25.540]  Hence, he knows all about government sponsored terror. In the early 80s, von B端low also served as SPD ranking member in the investigative committee, a task that led him to inquire into white collar crime and connection with Eastern intelligence services,
[2:01:25.540 --> 2:01:37.540]  and later also into the label's criminal activities of Western intelligence services. It goes on and on, and it is great to have him back on with us. Mr. von B端low, thank you for coming on.
[2:01:37.540 --> 2:01:45.540]  Hello. Good evening. It's good to have you here. We're about to break in. Good evening. In your time, it's before.
[2:01:45.540 --> 2:01:50.540]  It is afternoon, but it is evening. What is it about? Nine o'clock your time? Eight o'clock.
[2:01:50.540 --> 2:01:57.540]  Okay. Well, we're honored to have you with us. We're about to break in about three minutes, but just give us a preview, Mr. von B端low.
[2:01:57.540 --> 2:02:03.540]  What are you going to be covering today? What do you think is most important as the 9-11 black cop attacks unravel?
[2:02:03.540 --> 2:02:10.540]  The tax unravel? I didn't understand the last sentence.
[2:02:10.540 --> 2:02:15.540]  The 9-11 fable is unraveling. What do you think is most important now?
[2:02:15.540 --> 2:02:25.540]  Well, most important now is to gain the majority with people doubting the official version.
[2:02:25.540 --> 2:02:35.540]  It's a conspiracy theory handled by the government, but it's totally false, and we have to look through and know what has happened.
[2:02:35.540 --> 2:02:43.540]  I now firmly believe that the government was involved in this 9-11 business.
[2:02:43.540 --> 2:02:56.540]  You were one of the first people with your credentials, a major government cabinet official, and the multiple positions you've held in German cabinet to expose 9-11.
[2:02:56.540 --> 2:03:02.540]  Now we've seen the former Italian president. We've seen number three in the Blair government. We've seen Jesse Ventura.
[2:03:02.540 --> 2:03:09.540]  We've seen movie stars, best actress. It is a tidal wave of awakening. Do you agree?
[2:03:09.540 --> 2:03:23.540]  Yes, I think and a lot of experts in all these fields which were involved at 9-11, whether the FAA or the military, the Air Force, and so on and so on.
[2:03:23.540 --> 2:03:33.540]  Everybody gave testimony, very knowledgeable about what happened and that the official story couldn't stand.
[2:03:33.540 --> 2:03:43.540]  Absolutely. Well, today I'd like to go through why you originally, from your training in intelligence and in technology and in defense and in government,
[2:03:43.540 --> 2:03:52.540]  and investigating intelligence agency crimes to talk about 9-11 and why you believe they did it, why they were involved, who you now identify,
[2:03:52.540 --> 2:03:59.540]  who Andres Fambulo believes were involved in the attacks since you haven't been on with us for almost five years,
[2:03:59.540 --> 2:04:07.540]  and then where you think an investigation should go, where it should arise from, and then generally about the books you've written,
[2:04:07.540 --> 2:04:14.540]  not just about 9-11, but about government-sponsored terror and intelligence agency corruption itself.
[2:04:14.540 --> 2:04:22.540]  And before we go to break, are there any particular web addresses, websites you'd like to give out?
[2:04:22.540 --> 2:04:36.540]  No, I don't have a special website. We have a Germany website, but not specially on 9-11, but covering the whole affair, including what's now going on in Tibet.
[2:04:36.540 --> 2:04:56.540]  Well, stay there. I want to hear about this on the other side, and we'll give out that web address for our guest and post it on infoawards.com. We'll be right back.

[2:07:48.540 --> 2:07:59.540]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:59.540 --> 2:08:07.540]  Joining us from Germany at 8 o'clock in the evening, Andres von B端low.
[2:08:07.540 --> 2:08:16.540]  For those stations that just joined us, former federal minister of defense, former head of research and technology.
[2:08:16.540 --> 2:08:23.540]  He also in parliament headed up the committee that oversaw the intelligence agencies. He has written several bestselling books.
[2:08:23.540 --> 2:08:33.540]  One of them is the CIA in September 11th. Die CIA under, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, and you can get that all over Europe.
[2:08:33.540 --> 2:08:39.540]  It's in many different languages, unfortunately, not translated into English. Sir, you've got the floor.
[2:08:39.540 --> 2:08:46.540]  Why did you first question the official story? What have you learned since then now saying you officially believe it's an inside job?
[2:08:46.540 --> 2:08:51.540]  And then how do we stop them from committing more attacks and bring them to justice?
[2:08:51.540 --> 2:09:03.540]  Well, I first, I wrote a book about using terror as a pretext to wage war.
[2:09:03.540 --> 2:09:13.540]  And we had this clash of civilization written by Mr. Professor Huntington out of Harvard.
[2:09:13.540 --> 2:09:23.540]  And he said all the people of the western world need after the Soviet Union has gone a new enemy.
[2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:32.540]  And I think this was one of the first signals long before the 9-11 situation.
[2:09:32.540 --> 2:09:43.540]  And then happened World Trade Center 1, I think in 1993 or something like that.
[2:09:43.540 --> 2:09:52.540]  And there we now know that the FBI was totally informed what was going on.
[2:09:52.540 --> 2:10:05.540]  That there would be a terror attack that were there Muslims living in New Jersey and guided by a guy who worked together with the FBI.
[2:10:05.540 --> 2:10:18.540]  And the FBI and this guy, they agreed that there will be an attack on World Trade Center at the first World Trade Center in 1993.
[2:10:18.540 --> 2:10:22.540]  And that the bomb would be built by these Muslims.
[2:10:22.540 --> 2:10:34.540]  But at the latest moment, the bomb should have been, how do you call it, made unworkable.
[2:10:34.540 --> 2:10:35.540]  Deactivated.
[2:10:35.540 --> 2:10:37.540]  Deactivated.
[2:10:37.540 --> 2:10:40.540]  And the FBI in the last minute didn't do that.
[2:10:40.540 --> 2:10:42.540]  They knew perfectly what would go on.
[2:10:42.540 --> 2:10:49.540]  And there you had six people dead and I think about the thousand wounded.
[2:10:49.540 --> 2:10:52.540]  This was the first attack on the World Trade Center.
[2:10:52.540 --> 2:11:04.540]  Then you had this Oklahoma situation where it's totally impossible that this agricultural bomb would be able to destroy this federal building.
[2:11:04.540 --> 2:11:14.540]  Everybody who is an expert knows this and an American general who worked on this explosive field for, I think, 10 years.
[2:11:14.540 --> 2:11:18.540]  Former head of Air Force Weapons Development, an actual engineer.
[2:11:18.540 --> 2:11:19.540]  That's right, yeah.
[2:11:19.540 --> 2:11:22.540]  And he said it's totally impossible.
[2:11:22.540 --> 2:11:27.540]  This kind of agricultural bomb cannot bring about this devastation.
[2:11:27.540 --> 2:11:30.540]  But he was thrown out of the court.
[2:11:30.540 --> 2:11:33.540]  He was thrown out of the investigation.
[2:11:33.540 --> 2:11:43.540]  So I was already, I thought there is a way to bring about the clash with the whole Muslim world.
[2:11:43.540 --> 2:11:50.540]  You already had, were analyzing the situation, working in intelligence and other areas.
[2:11:50.540 --> 2:11:52.540]  And so you already saw it coming.
[2:11:52.540 --> 2:11:58.540]  Yeah, so I was aware that probably something is wrong about this.
[2:11:58.540 --> 2:12:11.540]  I didn't knew what was wrong, but I said, well, wait, we are looking on the behavior of the government, clearing the situation before, during and after 9-11.
[2:12:11.540 --> 2:12:18.540]  And this was so strange with these 19 Muslims, which they found out within hours.
[2:12:18.540 --> 2:12:34.540]  And they couldn't have known them, then later on we knew that a lot of them came into your country by visas given by them from secret services.
[2:12:34.540 --> 2:12:36.540]  That's probably the CIA.
[2:12:36.540 --> 2:12:37.540]  Yeah, that's a big point.
[2:12:37.540 --> 2:12:38.540]  The heads of the two men.
[2:12:38.540 --> 2:12:48.540]  Yeah, they were protected to coming in. Part of them joined the American military and the military was not able to clear the situation.
[2:12:48.540 --> 2:12:59.540]  Then you have this fantastic NORAD system and on the eastern part of the United States, which didn't work.
[2:12:59.540 --> 2:13:10.540]  But before you had, I think, 67 interceptions by aircrafts, military aircrafts going up and clearing the situation.
[2:13:10.540 --> 2:13:12.540]  That was just in the year before, yes.
[2:13:12.540 --> 2:13:13.540]  Yeah, sure.
[2:13:13.540 --> 2:13:16.540]  In the year before, it worked perfectly.
[2:13:16.540 --> 2:13:21.540]  But on the morning of 9-11, it didn't work.
[2:13:21.540 --> 2:13:34.540]  There were, I think, four or five exercises going on, air exercises, which totally interrupted the normal procedures.
[2:13:34.540 --> 2:13:40.540]  But the government didn't anything to clear the situation after it happened.
[2:13:40.540 --> 2:13:51.540]  I think it was the most horrible failures of the American government and the Bush government is not willing to find out what really went wrong on this day.
[2:13:51.540 --> 2:14:01.540]  And then you have these fighter airplanes going up and they are with very low velocity.
[2:14:01.540 --> 2:14:04.540]  They didn't find the enemy.
[2:14:04.540 --> 2:14:10.540]  And so four times at this day, nothing worked.
[2:14:10.540 --> 2:14:15.540]  The FDA didn't work, didn't work really, and the NORAD didn't work. They didn't work together.
[2:14:15.540 --> 2:14:22.540]  Bush, I think, changed the way how to deal with this kind of situation.
[2:14:22.540 --> 2:14:25.540]  That's right. Dick Cheney, two and a half months before.
[2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:33.540]  Suddenly Dick Cheney was in charge and not the normal run of affairs.
[2:14:33.540 --> 2:14:36.540]  So a lot of very strange things happened.
[2:14:36.540 --> 2:14:38.540]  That's a key point, Andres Fambulo. Let's stop right there.
[2:14:38.540 --> 2:14:41.540]  Two and a half months before, he signs an order.
[2:14:41.540 --> 2:14:50.540]  Since 57 when NORAD was set up, the default by the generals and even their officers under them is they have the authorization.
[2:14:50.540 --> 2:14:57.540]  If the craft doesn't follow orders or is endangering civilian areas, they shoot it down.
[2:14:57.540 --> 2:15:01.540]  Cheney took the power away from the generals.
[2:15:01.540 --> 2:15:10.540]  Two and a half months before, and Bush masked 44,000 US troops, 18,000 British troops around Afghanistan
[2:15:10.540 --> 2:15:15.540]  and put the carriers there and signed the launch order to attack Afghanistan the day before 9-11.
[2:15:15.540 --> 2:15:17.540]  How suspicious is that?
[2:15:17.540 --> 2:15:20.540]  Sure. And the same is true of Iraq.
[2:15:20.540 --> 2:15:24.540]  It was long before I decided to attack Iraq.
[2:15:24.540 --> 2:15:34.540]  And 9-11, they began telling this stupid story that Saddam Hussein was involved with al-Qaeda.
[2:15:34.540 --> 2:15:38.540]  He was an enemy of al-Qaeda, an enemy, and al-Qaeda.
[2:15:38.540 --> 2:15:44.540]  If al-Qaeda is existing, probably it's a construct of the...
[2:15:44.540 --> 2:15:47.540]  Well, now they say Iran is al-Qaeda when they're Shiite.
[2:15:47.540 --> 2:15:54.540]  Surely, they try to find the stupidity of the population to believe them.
[2:15:54.540 --> 2:15:58.540]  Well, we are pretty dumb, but please continue with the points that made you question,
[2:15:58.540 --> 2:16:01.540]  and you now say you do know they were involved.
[2:16:01.540 --> 2:16:05.540]  And then I want to talk about why you think they did it and how you think they really did it.
[2:16:05.540 --> 2:16:07.540]  We know the official stories a lot, but...
[2:16:07.540 --> 2:16:13.540]  Stupidly, they have written it down in this new American century,
[2:16:13.540 --> 2:16:19.540]  where Bachini was involved, where the Jet Bush was involved,
[2:16:19.540 --> 2:16:25.540]  where Pearl was involved, and all these guys running the government.
[2:16:25.540 --> 2:16:34.540]  And they said, we have to tell the American population that there is no peace dividend.
[2:16:34.540 --> 2:16:39.540]  We can't cut down our military outlays.
[2:16:39.540 --> 2:16:43.540]  We have to bring them up very strongly up.
[2:16:43.540 --> 2:16:49.540]  We have to wage a kind of...
[2:16:49.540 --> 2:16:50.540]  Not a war, but...
[2:16:50.540 --> 2:16:51.540]  Pre-emptive.
[2:16:51.540 --> 2:16:53.540]  We have to...
[2:16:53.540 --> 2:16:54.540]  We have to be...
[2:16:54.540 --> 2:17:04.540]  We have to prepare to certify that the United States is running the World Affairs for the next century.
[2:17:04.540 --> 2:17:13.540]  And therefore, we have to fight, and we have to pay for the military industrial complex.
[2:17:13.540 --> 2:17:20.540]  And there they said, well, it will be difficult to tell this to the American people,
[2:17:20.540 --> 2:17:23.540]  because they would like to have the peace dividend.
[2:17:23.540 --> 2:17:27.540]  But if something is happening, like Pearl Harbor,
[2:17:27.540 --> 2:17:35.540]  where the population were thrown into a totally different direction than they thought before,
[2:17:35.540 --> 2:17:41.540]  would be wise, and were able and willing to fight World War II,
[2:17:41.540 --> 2:17:48.540]  if this kind of thing will happen, the whole scenery will change.
[2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:51.540]  And now we have neocons.
[2:17:51.540 --> 2:17:53.540]  I don't know if you saw this last year,
[2:17:53.540 --> 2:17:58.540]  writing syndicated columns saying 9-11 was wonderful, we need another one.
[2:17:58.540 --> 2:18:03.540]  And then Gary Hart wrote a letter to Iran last year saying,
[2:18:03.540 --> 2:18:07.540]  the U.S. government stages attacks, you better back off.
[2:18:07.540 --> 2:18:08.540]  Did you see that?
[2:18:08.540 --> 2:18:12.540]  No, but I see the scenery.
[2:18:12.540 --> 2:18:14.540]  Why are they so arrogant, though?
[2:18:14.540 --> 2:18:15.540]  You've worked at the highest levels of government.
[2:18:15.540 --> 2:18:18.540]  I mean, I've never seen such arrogant out in the open people.
[2:18:18.540 --> 2:18:20.540]  They basically admit they've done it.
[2:18:20.540 --> 2:18:24.540]  Yeah, I don't know.
[2:18:24.540 --> 2:18:28.540]  Because Iraq has oil, Iran has oil,
[2:18:28.540 --> 2:18:35.540]  then the dismemberization of the former Soviet Union of Russia,
[2:18:35.540 --> 2:18:40.540]  it's all going on with the same background,
[2:18:40.540 --> 2:18:47.540]  helping and bringing about disputes and more kind of situations.
[2:18:47.540 --> 2:18:52.540]  And I think if you look at the,
[2:18:52.540 --> 2:18:56.540]  not on the democratic side of the American government system,
[2:18:56.540 --> 2:18:58.540]  if you look at the empire system,
[2:18:58.540 --> 2:19:02.540]  then you have always these fake elements.
[2:19:02.540 --> 2:19:13.540]  You have this in the first American-Spanish war with the destruction of the main.
[2:19:13.540 --> 2:19:20.540]  You have the same thing in the first war with the Lusitania.
[2:19:20.540 --> 2:19:23.540]  This was a job which was handled mostly by Iran.
[2:19:23.540 --> 2:19:24.540]  Stay there.
[2:19:24.540 --> 2:19:28.540]  I want to talk about the history of staged events with Andres von M端low,
[2:19:28.540 --> 2:19:30.540]  former Defense Secretary of Germany,
[2:19:30.540 --> 2:19:33.540]  former Technology Minister of Germany,
[2:19:33.540 --> 2:19:36.540]  and he was also on the oversight of the intelligence agencies.
[2:19:36.540 --> 2:19:39.540]  He's Andres von M端low,
[2:19:39.540 --> 2:19:42.540]  and he's written the book, The CIA in 9-11.
[2:19:42.540 --> 2:19:44.540]  Come back and break it down for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:19:44.540 --> 2:19:48.540]  We're honored to have him.
[2:19:48.540 --> 2:19:52.540]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:19:52.540 --> 2:19:57.540]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:19:57.540 --> 2:20:00.540]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[2:20:00.540 --> 2:20:03.540]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:20:03.540 --> 2:20:06.540]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:20:06.540 --> 2:20:09.540]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:20:09.540 --> 2:20:16.540]  a great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:20:16.540 --> 2:20:18.540]  For the first time in history,
[2:20:18.540 --> 2:20:21.540]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:20:21.540 --> 2:20:25.540]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:20:25.540 --> 2:20:28.540]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:20:28.540 --> 2:20:30.540]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[2:20:30.540 --> 2:20:32.540]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[2:20:32.540 --> 2:20:33.540]  That's their after-easy.

[2:22:51.540 --> 2:22:53.540]  even banned TV on your computer?
[2:22:53.540 --> 2:22:57.540]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup
[2:22:57.540 --> 2:23:02.540]  that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch
[2:23:02.540 --> 2:23:05.540]  without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[2:23:05.540 --> 2:23:09.540]  Here's the story, new video feed technology lets anyone with a high speed internet connection
[2:23:09.540 --> 2:23:14.540]  gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[2:23:14.540 --> 2:23:18.540]  And here's the best part, it's 100% legal, and it works at home, the office,
[2:23:18.540 --> 2:23:23.540]  or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.

[2:23:37.540 --> 2:23:40.540]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[2:23:40.540 --> 2:24:03.540]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[2:24:13.540 --> 2:24:15.540]  That just came out last year.
[2:24:15.540 --> 2:24:21.540]  Chicago Tribune, please continue, sir.
[2:24:21.540 --> 2:24:26.540]  Yes, please continue with, you were giving examples of government sponsored terror.
[2:24:26.540 --> 2:24:41.540]  No, I would add that one of the very strange things on 9-11 after the aircraft hit the towers,
[2:24:41.540 --> 2:24:47.540]  was the insert version of these dancing or laughing Palestinians.
[2:24:47.540 --> 2:24:57.540]  It was so fantastically just in time that I was very doubtful whether this has a real background.
[2:24:57.540 --> 2:25:08.540]  And later on it was very interesting that the former Vice-Bergermeister of Jerusalem told the public
[2:25:08.540 --> 2:25:18.540]  that the Israeli Defense Ministry sent a camera team over on the Palestinian side
[2:25:18.540 --> 2:25:26.540]  and they gave candies to the public and the public was laughing and this was put on TV.
[2:25:26.540 --> 2:25:33.540]  And immediately with 9-11 it was mixed with these horrible pictures.
[2:25:33.540 --> 2:25:40.540]  So even in the PR situation it was prepared and it was very strange.
[2:25:40.540 --> 2:25:53.540]  And then I think as you all know the free-form velocity of the falling of not only the both towers,
[2:25:53.540 --> 2:25:59.540]  also the World Trade Center number 7, which was not hit by a plane, is extremely strange.
[2:25:59.540 --> 2:26:02.540]  It could not happen as the government is telling us.
[2:26:02.540 --> 2:26:10.540]  So I think history teaches us that wars are always started with lies.
[2:26:10.540 --> 2:26:17.540]  By the government starting this war they want always to blame the other side
[2:26:17.540 --> 2:26:22.540]  in order to get a rectification of what they are doing.
[2:26:22.540 --> 2:26:32.540]  So we have always to be extremely skeptical if something has happened, like perhaps in the Persian Gulf
[2:26:32.540 --> 2:26:39.540]  might something happen or for example the American destroyer Vincent.
[2:26:39.540 --> 2:26:47.540]  They shoot down an airbus over the Persian Gulf I think 20 years ago.
[2:26:47.540 --> 2:26:53.540]  They should have known that there is a normal civil aviation going on.
[2:26:53.540 --> 2:27:07.540]  They said they couldn't distinguish a small air fighter with military aims from a huge body aircraft
[2:27:07.540 --> 2:27:13.540]  and they shoot it down and this was one of the reasons probably Lockerbie happened
[2:27:13.540 --> 2:27:24.540]  because Iran stroked back and so you have always this trying to bring a situation
[2:27:24.540 --> 2:27:30.540]  where the population are getting upset and willing to go to war
[2:27:30.540 --> 2:27:33.540]  and to give a free hand to their government.
[2:27:33.540 --> 2:27:43.540]  Mr. Von Bielow in the short segment we have gotten a long one coming up, can you talk about the psychology?
[2:27:43.540 --> 2:27:46.540]  We know military psychology of where a general will put a thousand troops in a gorge or a valley
[2:27:46.540 --> 2:27:54.540]  to bring in an enemy, a larger force to reveal themselves sacrificing the pawn symbolized by the thousand troops
[2:27:54.540 --> 2:27:57.540]  to then bring in his troops to win the battle.
[2:27:57.540 --> 2:28:04.540]  And it's that mindset of in justifies the means, justifies the ends, that Machiavellian system
[2:28:04.540 --> 2:28:10.540]  where we do have these people running our government that would think nothing of killing 3,000 citizens
[2:28:10.540 --> 2:28:14.540]  for this larger hegemonic empire.
[2:28:14.540 --> 2:28:19.540]  Well, I laughed when I was with the Ministry of Defense.
[2:28:19.540 --> 2:28:22.540]  I laughed about psychological warfare.
[2:28:22.540 --> 2:28:30.540]  It was doing some things on the inner German border, raising balloons with material
[2:28:30.540 --> 2:28:36.540]  which the wind was blowing over or other things like that.
[2:28:36.540 --> 2:28:47.540]  But psychological warfare is extremely important and it's a kind of military affair.
[2:28:47.540 --> 2:28:55.540]  If you are planning a war or if you have a battle before you as a military commander, you know
[2:28:55.540 --> 2:29:00.540]  you probably will lose a third or half of your men.
[2:29:00.540 --> 2:29:10.540]  But you will win or you hope to win and to win not only the battle but the whole war.
[2:29:10.540 --> 2:29:14.540]  That's my point, is the 3,000 dead were seen as collateral damage.
[2:29:14.540 --> 2:29:23.540]  What came out from the American government, unfortunately, was within, I think, 48 hours.
[2:29:23.540 --> 2:29:31.540]  That was the first giving this word, that there is a generation long war.
[2:29:31.540 --> 2:29:37.540]  Stay there, stay there. We'll be right back with Andres Formula.
[2:29:37.540 --> 2:29:41.540]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.

[2:30:47.540 --> 2:30:52.540]  You can trace every disease, every illness and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[2:30:52.540 --> 2:30:56.540]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[2:30:56.540 --> 2:31:01.540]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained and utilized than of heated,
[2:31:01.540 --> 2:31:06.540]  the champion juicer is the best way to get your nutrients or body craves.
[2:31:06.540 --> 2:31:10.540]  The champion juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[2:31:10.540 --> 2:31:14.540]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins and trace minerals.
[2:31:14.540 --> 2:31:20.540]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness,
[2:31:20.540 --> 2:31:24.540]  but also is shown to reverse once-thought incurable life-threatening diseases.
[2:31:24.540 --> 2:31:30.540]  Juicing with the champion juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[2:31:30.540 --> 2:31:33.540]  Put the champion juicer to work for you and your family.
[2:31:33.540 --> 2:31:38.540]  Be creative with your juicer and add a grain mill attachment to make your own healthy, fresh flower.
[2:31:38.540 --> 2:31:42.540]  The champion juicer also makes great nut butters and frozen sorbets.
[2:31:42.540 --> 2:31:45.540]  The world's finest juicer is champion juicer.

[2:31:47.540 --> 2:31:51.540]  Someday, cancer, diabetes and poor health may disrupt your life.
[2:31:51.540 --> 2:31:54.540]  Are you going to be the one and four who gets cancer in their lifetime?
[2:31:54.540 --> 2:31:58.540]  Well, now you can set aside your worries and offset that chance with Alcavita.

[2:32:04.540 --> 2:32:11.540]  Fast food and unhealthy habits contribute to excess acid and undesirable effects that lay foundations of disease and poor health.
[2:32:11.540 --> 2:32:14.540]  Do you remember the old saying, an apple a day keeps the doctor away.
[2:32:14.540 --> 2:32:16.540]  Those words of wisdom are true.
[2:32:16.540 --> 2:32:18.540]  Your body heals itself when eating well.
[2:32:18.540 --> 2:32:23.540]  Rather than fighting the effects of chemicals like corn syrup, sugar, preservatives and other unpronounceable ingredients,
[2:32:23.540 --> 2:32:30.540]  your body is the best pharmacy in the world and with Alcavita, it can help your body naturally neutralize excess body acid
[2:32:30.540 --> 2:32:33.540]  and help hydrate your body promoting the energized healthier you.

[2:33:03.540 --> 2:33:10.540]  I'm very thankful that Andres Homulo is sharing this much time with us today.
[2:33:10.540 --> 2:33:15.540]  I want to be clear with listeners who haven't studied military history.
[2:33:15.540 --> 2:33:21.540]  It is part of the military history, just like World War I,
[2:33:21.540 --> 2:33:28.540]  at some battles where they'd lose 10,000 people a day to just feed troops into a meat grinder.
[2:33:28.540 --> 2:33:36.540]  And that mindset then translates into, oh well, it's better for our people to run the empire and for America's future
[2:33:36.540 --> 2:33:40.540]  if we go ahead and kill 3,000 and blame it on these enemies.
[2:33:40.540 --> 2:33:43.540]  That's how Hitler started World War I.
[2:33:43.540 --> 2:33:48.540]  I mean, World War II with Poland was attacking their own radio station at Gliwitz.
[2:33:48.540 --> 2:33:54.540]  Governments do this over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[2:33:54.540 --> 2:33:59.540]  They're very cold-blooded, but to be clear, the people running our country could care less about US sovereignty.
[2:33:59.540 --> 2:34:02.540]  They're actually using us as their front.
[2:34:02.540 --> 2:34:08.540]  Mr. Vomulo, do you agree that we have this multinational Anglo-American establishment
[2:34:08.540 --> 2:34:14.540]  slash Israel that are in control of our military industrial complex,
[2:34:14.540 --> 2:34:20.540]  the intelligence agencies, firmly ensconced, and that they're using the US as good name
[2:34:20.540 --> 2:34:28.540]  and basically using the US as an engine or as a mindless drone to carry out their activities?
[2:34:28.540 --> 2:34:35.540]  I think you have enough Americans joining this whole game.
[2:34:35.540 --> 2:34:38.540]  It's not necessary to blame it on Israel.
[2:34:38.540 --> 2:34:42.540]  Israel is perhaps interested to change things in the Near East.
[2:34:42.540 --> 2:34:46.540]  And there's a conversion of thinking.
[2:34:46.540 --> 2:34:54.540]  But a lot of American elite, a huge amount of American elite are behind this policy.
[2:34:54.540 --> 2:35:02.540]  And if you really look at both parties in the Congress, it's a bipartisan policy.
[2:35:02.540 --> 2:35:12.540]  So I doubt whether there is real, if it comes down to a final combat,
[2:35:12.540 --> 2:35:20.540]  that the elite of both parties are behind this kind of world leader,
[2:35:20.540 --> 2:35:26.540]  not only world leadership, but if it would be wise, I wouldn't have any problem
[2:35:26.540 --> 2:35:31.540]  with Americans or the American state governing the world.
[2:35:31.540 --> 2:35:36.540]  But this kind of policy where you could easily buy your oil
[2:35:36.540 --> 2:35:41.540]  and it's not necessary to occupy all these countries which have oil
[2:35:41.540 --> 2:35:49.540]  and throw them in huge civil wars which are with horrible effects.
[2:35:49.540 --> 2:35:51.540]  Let me be clear about my belief.
[2:35:51.540 --> 2:35:54.540]  I said Anglo-American establishment first and then Israel,
[2:35:54.540 --> 2:35:57.540]  certainly as a cheerleader involved in it and lobbying for it.
[2:35:57.540 --> 2:35:59.540]  I'm not singling Israel out there.
[2:35:59.540 --> 2:36:01.540]  I'm saying that, I mean, who is it?
[2:36:01.540 --> 2:36:03.540]  It's England. It's the US.
[2:36:03.540 --> 2:36:09.540]  It's mainly Israel, isn't it, that is supporting the wars that grew out of 9-11?
[2:36:09.540 --> 2:36:11.540]  Well, they are joining.
[2:36:11.540 --> 2:36:19.540]  But I think that the main center of thinking about this
[2:36:19.540 --> 2:36:27.540]  has been around the neocons, with their papers on the new American century
[2:36:27.540 --> 2:36:30.540]  and the outlets for defense.
[2:36:30.540 --> 2:36:33.540]  There you have written down what would happen,
[2:36:33.540 --> 2:36:39.540]  even the showing out of Saddam Hussein and all these kind of things.
[2:36:39.540 --> 2:36:48.540]  The partition of Iraq is one of the points which they try to follow.
[2:36:48.540 --> 2:36:53.540]  I think now Iraq, there is a day-to-day war going on,
[2:36:53.540 --> 2:36:56.540]  or civil war with American troops.
[2:36:56.540 --> 2:37:06.540]  But the real thing is that I think five huge bases are already built within Iraq
[2:37:06.540 --> 2:37:14.540]  away from all these settlements where the American military can stay for decades.
[2:37:14.540 --> 2:37:20.540]  As Dick Cheney and now of course Bush and of course McCain say they want to stay 100 years,
[2:37:20.540 --> 2:37:23.540]  and you're right, both parties are for the war.
[2:37:23.540 --> 2:37:26.540]  It doesn't matter if 80 plus percent of Americans are against it.
[2:37:26.540 --> 2:37:28.540]  They are going to continue that.
[2:37:28.540 --> 2:37:30.540]  So that's my next question for you.
[2:37:30.540 --> 2:37:33.540]  You have unusual knowledge as being the head of technology,
[2:37:33.540 --> 2:37:38.540]  the head of defense, over intelligence, having all these different hats you've worn,
[2:37:38.540 --> 2:37:40.540]  exposing corruption.
[2:37:40.540 --> 2:37:45.540]  I would like you to give us your assessment, Mr. Van Bule,
[2:37:45.540 --> 2:37:47.540]  on where you think they're going.
[2:37:47.540 --> 2:37:49.540]  Is their program stalling?
[2:37:49.540 --> 2:37:51.540]  Are they in trouble?
[2:37:51.540 --> 2:37:55.540]  Do you think that this crime complex, this global oligarchy,
[2:37:55.540 --> 2:37:58.540]  this corporatism that controls our government,
[2:37:58.540 --> 2:38:00.540]  do you think they're going to stage more attacks?
[2:38:00.540 --> 2:38:02.540]  Do you think they're going to fail in Iraq?
[2:38:02.540 --> 2:38:04.540]  I mean, where do you see things going?
[2:38:04.540 --> 2:38:10.540]  I think they try to fulfill the program,
[2:38:10.540 --> 2:38:16.540]  but they are running against huge troubles because the money is running out.
[2:38:16.540 --> 2:38:23.540]  America lives at the moment from a day-to-day necessity to get,
[2:38:23.540 --> 2:38:28.540]  I think, 80 percent of all savings around the globe.
[2:38:28.540 --> 2:38:32.540]  From Japan, from China, from Germany, from everywhere.
[2:38:32.540 --> 2:38:35.540]  And at the moment, the dollar is falling,
[2:38:35.540 --> 2:38:40.540]  and people are very reluctant to continue with this.
[2:38:40.540 --> 2:38:43.540]  And if you don't have this kind of money,
[2:38:43.540 --> 2:38:48.540]  you can only go further with this world with huge amount of inflation,
[2:38:48.540 --> 2:38:52.540]  which, again, is weakening the dollar.
[2:38:52.540 --> 2:38:58.540]  So I think... I don't know what these kinds...
[2:38:58.540 --> 2:39:02.540]  They are running against the wall, probably,
[2:39:02.540 --> 2:39:04.540]  and everything is falling apart.
[2:39:04.540 --> 2:39:06.540]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[2:39:06.540 --> 2:39:08.540]  I hate to keep using...
[2:39:08.540 --> 2:39:11.540]  Probably, Genie and these kind of people are thinking,
[2:39:11.540 --> 2:39:17.540]  well, if we succeed in getting more and more and more oil land
[2:39:17.540 --> 2:39:22.540]  under our sovereignty, perhaps we find a way out.
[2:39:22.540 --> 2:39:28.540]  But I'm very doubtful whether this addition is going out.
[2:39:28.540 --> 2:39:31.540]  Well, I agree with your assessment, Mr. Vambulo,
[2:39:31.540 --> 2:39:34.540]  that they have a lot of hubris.
[2:39:34.540 --> 2:39:38.540]  They're stalling, like Napoleon in Russia or Hitler in Russia.
[2:39:38.540 --> 2:39:40.540]  The analogies just continue.
[2:39:40.540 --> 2:39:43.540]  Or you can see the United States, kind of like the Soviet Union,
[2:39:43.540 --> 2:39:49.540]  whose aggression is starting to stall, as it did in the 1980s.
[2:39:49.540 --> 2:39:52.540]  And, you know, it's fomenting of revolutions.
[2:39:52.540 --> 2:39:57.540]  Where do you see the United States in a year, two years, five years, ten years?
[2:39:57.540 --> 2:40:03.540]  A, B, could the neocons snatch the victory from the jaws of defeat
[2:40:03.540 --> 2:40:07.540]  by staging a thermonuclear, quote, al-Qaeda attack
[2:40:07.540 --> 2:40:11.540]  or releasing a bioweapon as a way to fully...
[2:40:11.540 --> 2:40:16.540]  Because all we see them doing is mobilizing fascism,
[2:40:16.540 --> 2:40:19.540]  building concentration camps, that's mainstream news,
[2:40:19.540 --> 2:40:22.540]  building FEMA camps in the U.S., San Francisco Chronicle,
[2:40:22.540 --> 2:40:27.540]  Houston Chronicle, militarizing police, CIA, over every major city.
[2:40:27.540 --> 2:40:32.540]  They now admit fusion FEMA command bunkers have been built in every city.
[2:40:32.540 --> 2:40:35.540]  One in ten college graduates now homeland security.
[2:40:35.540 --> 2:40:39.540]  Basically, a rising of black uniform.
[2:40:39.540 --> 2:40:41.540]  I'm not using this analogy because you're German,
[2:40:41.540 --> 2:40:43.540]  but they act like you're Stapo, everywhere.
[2:40:43.540 --> 2:40:45.540]  I mean, they're really taking over.
[2:40:45.540 --> 2:40:47.540]  Face-scanning cameras, warrantless checkpoints.
[2:40:47.540 --> 2:40:49.540]  They're hiring mercenaries.
[2:40:49.540 --> 2:40:53.540]  I mean, I see them trying to turn us into an armed camp.
[2:40:53.540 --> 2:40:56.540]  Instead of giving up, I think they may just stage some huge event
[2:40:56.540 --> 2:40:58.540]  and then attack the world.
[2:40:58.540 --> 2:41:01.540]  Well, it might happen. I don't know. I don't know.
[2:41:01.540 --> 2:41:07.540]  I'm desperate as you, because I would like to have my own ideal
[2:41:07.540 --> 2:41:14.540]  of an open, kindly American America,
[2:41:14.540 --> 2:41:16.540]  which is competing with the whole world,
[2:41:16.540 --> 2:41:21.540]  leading the world with its wise background.
[2:41:21.540 --> 2:41:25.540]  But at the moment, I don't see these kind of people.
[2:41:25.540 --> 2:41:28.540]  Yeah, they are at the moment not running the country.
[2:41:28.540 --> 2:41:33.540]  And you have, I think, ten times as much people already in prisons
[2:41:33.540 --> 2:41:37.540]  as we Europeans or any European state has.
[2:41:37.540 --> 2:41:43.540]  And I think Holly Burton and others are building a kind of concentration camps
[2:41:43.540 --> 2:41:47.540]  for the situation, if the situation is coming.
[2:41:47.540 --> 2:41:53.540]  And this, you know, this was one of the main points in Germany
[2:41:53.540 --> 2:41:56.540]  within a night.
[2:41:56.540 --> 2:42:01.540]  About 30,000 people went immediately into prison.
[2:42:01.540 --> 2:42:06.540]  And these were the people which were judged by the Nazi people
[2:42:06.540 --> 2:42:10.540]  able to lead the opposition against Hitler in the last moment,
[2:42:10.540 --> 2:42:13.540]  to organize strikes and so on and so on.
[2:42:13.540 --> 2:42:20.540]  And if this is happening, then a takeover is absolutely possible.
[2:42:20.540 --> 2:42:25.540]  I don't know. I hope you are not following this way.
[2:42:25.540 --> 2:42:29.540]  Sir, sir, they arrest you almost everywhere.
[2:42:29.540 --> 2:42:33.540]  They hold a sign up. They come and beat you and taser you.
[2:42:33.540 --> 2:42:35.540]  They wear black masks.
[2:42:35.540 --> 2:42:37.540]  There's helicopters over our houses every night.
[2:42:37.540 --> 2:42:39.540]  They're brainwashing the children.
[2:42:39.540 --> 2:42:41.540]  I mean, you ought to see it here.
[2:42:41.540 --> 2:42:43.540]  It is really scary.
[2:42:43.540 --> 2:42:45.540]  And as you said, both parties are involved.
[2:42:45.540 --> 2:42:47.540]  They're building prisons everywhere.
[2:42:47.540 --> 2:42:49.540]  They're now saying, I should be arrested.
[2:42:49.540 --> 2:42:53.540]  They're now saying on national TV that anyone who criticizes the war
[2:42:53.540 --> 2:42:55.540]  should be put in prison.
[2:42:55.540 --> 2:42:59.540]  They are gal-lighting or preparing the ground.
[2:42:59.540 --> 2:43:01.540]  Is that the right word?
[2:43:01.540 --> 2:43:03.540]  They are out there getting everyone ready.
[2:43:03.540 --> 2:43:05.540]  Now, I don't think they're as popular as Hitler.
[2:43:05.540 --> 2:43:07.540]  I don't think they're going to get away with it.
[2:43:07.540 --> 2:43:11.540]  And I think if they do try to have a big roundup or purge,
[2:43:11.540 --> 2:43:13.540]  or a crystal knot or whatever,
[2:43:13.540 --> 2:43:15.540]  I think they're going to get their asses blown off.
[2:43:15.540 --> 2:43:18.540]  But at the same time, I just think they're so arrogant,
[2:43:18.540 --> 2:43:20.540]  I think they're going to do it bombulo.
[2:43:20.540 --> 2:43:23.540]  I think that they flew planes into buildings.
[2:43:23.540 --> 2:43:27.540]  These are some reckless people.
[2:43:27.540 --> 2:43:31.540]  Well, I can finally give a judgment on this.
[2:43:31.540 --> 2:43:35.540]  I follow your discussions and your opinions
[2:43:35.540 --> 2:43:37.540]  and your anxiousness.
[2:43:37.540 --> 2:43:40.540]  And I participate in it.
[2:43:40.540 --> 2:43:47.540]  But I finally can judge the situation as you can.
[2:43:47.540 --> 2:43:52.540]  But in Germany, this kind of technique
[2:43:52.540 --> 2:43:55.540]  went along with a huge, huge, huge,
[2:43:55.540 --> 2:43:59.540]  totally desperation of the German population.
[2:43:59.540 --> 2:44:02.540]  They didn't know where to go and what to do.
[2:44:02.540 --> 2:44:04.540]  Yeah, the economy, same thing here.
[2:44:04.540 --> 2:44:07.540]  The economy, it was an inflation
[2:44:07.540 --> 2:44:10.540]  because of the French occupation of the rule.
[2:44:10.540 --> 2:44:17.540]  This was in 23, where all the people
[2:44:17.540 --> 2:44:20.540]  with a lot of savings lost all their savings
[2:44:20.540 --> 2:44:23.540]  and then came the big depression.
[2:44:23.540 --> 2:44:25.540]  And then they didn't know where to go
[2:44:25.540 --> 2:44:29.540]  and finally they went into the arms of the Nazis.
[2:44:29.540 --> 2:44:35.540]  Not even 50%, it was 44% in the last election.
[2:44:35.540 --> 2:44:36.540]  But it was enough.
[2:44:36.540 --> 2:44:39.540]  And then the police came and the police
[2:44:39.540 --> 2:44:43.540]  was organized in a way that the SR took over
[2:44:43.540 --> 2:44:45.540]  the police post and so on and so on.
[2:44:45.540 --> 2:44:48.540]  So this is a technique which is very, very dangerous.
[2:44:48.540 --> 2:44:50.540]  Well, they're now federalizing.
[2:44:50.540 --> 2:44:54.540]  I can't say that it's the same situation.
[2:44:54.540 --> 2:44:57.540]  It would be totally wrong as a German to do this.
[2:44:57.540 --> 2:44:59.540]  But you have to fight.
[2:44:59.540 --> 2:45:01.540]  But you do see the danger.
[2:45:01.540 --> 2:45:03.540]  I see the danger, yeah.
[2:45:03.540 --> 2:45:04.540]  Well, I agree.
[2:45:04.540 --> 2:45:07.540]  I'm not looking for a fight, but there's a lot of people
[2:45:07.540 --> 2:45:09.540]  and we're not going to put up with it.
[2:45:09.540 --> 2:45:11.540]  But we're going to let them, like at Lexington and Concord,
[2:45:11.540 --> 2:45:13.540]  when this country started, we're going to let them
[2:45:13.540 --> 2:45:16.540]  start at first, Mr. Vambula.
[2:45:16.540 --> 2:45:19.540]  I didn't understand this last sentence.
[2:45:19.540 --> 2:45:21.540]  Well, the Revolutionary War started here
[2:45:21.540 --> 2:45:23.540]  when they came for the guns.
[2:45:23.540 --> 2:45:25.540]  And when they started the fight.
[2:45:25.540 --> 2:45:28.540]  So I'm saying we're going to let them start the fight.
[2:45:28.540 --> 2:45:29.540]  Yeah.
[2:45:29.540 --> 2:45:31.540]  But then we're going to finish it.
[2:45:31.540 --> 2:45:32.540]  Okay.
[2:45:32.540 --> 2:45:34.540]  Yeah, I hope so.
[2:45:34.540 --> 2:45:36.540]  Well, we're not looking for a fight,
[2:45:36.540 --> 2:45:38.540]  but if they start it, believe me,
[2:45:38.540 --> 2:45:40.540]  the people are ready and they're...
[2:45:40.540 --> 2:45:42.540]  But these people are very strong.
[2:45:42.540 --> 2:45:46.540]  They have the whole infrastructure of the finances
[2:45:46.540 --> 2:45:52.540]  and, you know, if not some very, very capable people
[2:45:52.540 --> 2:45:57.540]  in industry and other big organizations
[2:45:57.540 --> 2:46:00.540]  are taking over on the lead and say,
[2:46:00.540 --> 2:46:03.540]  well, we don't want to be in this environment.
[2:46:03.540 --> 2:46:04.540]  I don't see it.
[2:46:04.540 --> 2:46:06.540]  I'm not very hopeful.
[2:46:06.540 --> 2:46:08.540]  Well, there is a lot of people speaking out
[2:46:08.540 --> 2:46:10.540]  in the power structure, but I agree with you.
[2:46:10.540 --> 2:46:12.540]  Mr. Van Bielow, there's so many other facets
[2:46:12.540 --> 2:46:14.540]  I want to get into.
[2:46:14.540 --> 2:46:19.540]  Investigations, bringing those that did this to justice.
[2:46:19.540 --> 2:46:21.540]  Do you think that will ever happen?
[2:46:21.540 --> 2:46:23.540]  Well, you know, we now hear about a United Nations body
[2:46:23.540 --> 2:46:25.540]  calling for an investigation of 9-11.
[2:46:25.540 --> 2:46:27.540]  I mean, certainly we can be positive
[2:46:27.540 --> 2:46:30.540]  in saying that a lot of people do now understand
[2:46:30.540 --> 2:46:33.540]  the false flag, self-inflicted wound,
[2:46:33.540 --> 2:46:35.540]  tactics used by governments.
[2:46:35.540 --> 2:46:37.540]  I mean, is that a positive in and of itself?
[2:46:37.540 --> 2:46:39.540]  Sure, it is positive in itself.
[2:46:39.540 --> 2:46:43.540]  But finally, I think you should appeal
[2:46:43.540 --> 2:46:46.540]  on every citizen of the United States
[2:46:46.540 --> 2:46:52.540]  to look independently in the whole affair
[2:46:52.540 --> 2:46:55.540]  and see what is wrong and how, for example,
[2:46:55.540 --> 2:46:59.540]  the so-called independent commission was handled
[2:46:59.540 --> 2:47:01.540]  and so on and so forth.
[2:47:01.540 --> 2:47:08.540]  You know, if you have a situation like during 9-11,
[2:47:08.540 --> 2:47:12.540]  it is a total failure of the state structure.
[2:47:12.540 --> 2:47:15.540]  Bush could have easily said,
[2:47:15.540 --> 2:47:18.540]  well, I inherited the structure from Clinton.
[2:47:18.540 --> 2:47:21.540]  I'm a Republican. He is a Democrat.
[2:47:21.540 --> 2:47:26.540]  Now we are clearing the whole situation.
[2:47:26.540 --> 2:47:28.540]  We tell you what went wrong.
[2:47:28.540 --> 2:47:31.540]  Instead of this, they are hiding behind secrecy
[2:47:31.540 --> 2:47:37.540]  and hiding away the tapes and so on and so on.
[2:47:37.540 --> 2:47:41.540]  For example, the Federal Aviation Agency agencies,
[2:47:41.540 --> 2:47:47.540]  these people, I think, during the break in the midday,
[2:47:47.540 --> 2:47:49.540]  they sat down and said,
[2:47:49.540 --> 2:47:52.540]  well, this horrible thing, what went wrong?
[2:47:52.540 --> 2:47:54.540]  What was wrong on this day?
[2:47:54.540 --> 2:47:58.540]  And they put it on tape and immediately,
[2:47:58.540 --> 2:48:01.540]  the superior came, took the tape away
[2:48:01.540 --> 2:48:04.540]  and destroyed it in a way which you can't repair.
[2:48:04.540 --> 2:48:08.540]  So why is the government behaving like that?
[2:48:08.540 --> 2:48:12.540]  It's so extremely strange.
[2:48:12.540 --> 2:48:15.540]  We're talking to former Minister of Defense of Technology,
[2:48:15.540 --> 2:48:17.540]  you name it, Andres Van Muleau.
[2:48:17.540 --> 2:48:19.540]  There's so many things I want to ask you,
[2:48:19.540 --> 2:48:21.540]  but I also want to give you time to talk about
[2:48:21.540 --> 2:48:23.540]  whatever you think is most important.
[2:48:23.540 --> 2:48:25.540]  But we know the official stories a lot.
[2:48:25.540 --> 2:48:27.540]  We know they're covering up.
[2:48:27.540 --> 2:48:28.540]  We know they had a motive.
[2:48:28.540 --> 2:48:30.540]  We know that they were involved.
[2:48:30.540 --> 2:48:34.540]  Specifically, looking at the picture now,
[2:48:34.540 --> 2:48:38.540]  almost seven years later, what do you think,
[2:48:38.540 --> 2:48:40.540]  they really did on 9-11.
[2:48:40.540 --> 2:48:42.540]  What do you think really happened there
[2:48:42.540 --> 2:48:44.540]  and who do you think was involved?
[2:48:44.540 --> 2:48:46.540]  What agencies, what governments?
[2:48:46.540 --> 2:48:47.540]  I don't know.
[2:48:47.540 --> 2:48:48.540]  I don't know.
[2:48:48.540 --> 2:48:52.540]  And I think one makes huge mistakes
[2:48:52.540 --> 2:48:56.540]  if you are blaming this and this and this agency.
[2:48:56.540 --> 2:49:00.540]  I think it was a very small group of people
[2:49:00.540 --> 2:49:05.540]  which knew the structure, they knew what to do.
[2:49:05.540 --> 2:49:09.540]  I think that the exercises, these five exercises,
[2:49:09.540 --> 2:49:12.540]  disturbed the whole picture.
[2:49:12.540 --> 2:49:17.540]  And I think the exercises were not cut down.
[2:49:17.540 --> 2:49:21.540]  Normally, if this kind of things are happening,
[2:49:21.540 --> 2:49:25.540]  you are cancelling all the exercises.
[2:49:25.540 --> 2:49:27.540]  Now it's the real world.
[2:49:27.540 --> 2:49:29.540]  We have to tackle this problem
[2:49:29.540 --> 2:49:32.540]  and show what we have learned and what we can do.
[2:49:32.540 --> 2:49:34.540]  But these exercises went on.
[2:49:34.540 --> 2:49:40.540]  And so, for example, the people on the Federal Aviation Agency said,
[2:49:40.540 --> 2:49:42.540]  well, is this real or is this exercise?
[2:49:42.540 --> 2:49:44.540]  They didn't know what happened.
[2:49:44.540 --> 2:49:48.540]  So this is extremely strange.
[2:49:48.540 --> 2:49:55.540]  And the behavior of the state after 9-11,
[2:49:55.540 --> 2:49:59.540]  no normal state would behave like the Bush administration.
[2:49:59.540 --> 2:50:02.540]  Do you think it's hurt them that we have exposed
[2:50:02.540 --> 2:50:04.540]  that it was an inside job at that myth?
[2:50:04.540 --> 2:50:05.540]  Sure.
[2:50:05.540 --> 2:50:07.540]  Sure, they are fighting.
[2:50:07.540 --> 2:50:14.540]  But if you have the TV and all these mainstream people
[2:50:14.540 --> 2:50:17.540]  going along with the government out of reasons
[2:50:17.540 --> 2:50:22.540]  I don't know, then they can say,
[2:50:22.540 --> 2:50:26.540]  well, we don't need to have more than 50% believing us.
[2:50:26.540 --> 2:50:31.540]  And the rest of these intellectuals can go to hell.
[2:50:31.540 --> 2:50:38.540]  So probably they hope to handle the public opinion
[2:50:38.540 --> 2:50:41.540]  as they did the last year.
[2:50:41.540 --> 2:50:42.540]  But they're not.
[2:50:42.540 --> 2:50:43.540]  Stay there.
[2:50:43.540 --> 2:50:45.540]  Final segment with Andres Van Bielow on the other side,
[2:50:45.540 --> 2:50:48.540]  his book is a CIA September 11th.
[2:50:48.540 --> 2:50:52.540]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:50:52.540 --> 2:50:54.540]  In the near future,
[2:50:54.540 --> 2:50:57.540]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:50:57.540 --> 2:51:00.540]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:51:00.540 --> 2:51:03.540]  What their objective being world domination?
[2:51:03.540 --> 2:51:06.540]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:51:06.540 --> 2:51:09.540]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:51:09.540 --> 2:51:14.540]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:51:14.540 --> 2:51:18.540]  For the first time in history,
[2:51:18.540 --> 2:51:22.540]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:51:22.540 --> 2:51:24.540]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire
[2:51:24.540 --> 2:51:26.540]  new world order agenda.
[2:51:26.540 --> 2:51:28.540]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:51:28.540 --> 2:51:30.540]  Most people have no idea.
[2:51:30.540 --> 2:51:31.540]  They're not after money.
[2:51:31.540 --> 2:51:32.540]  They have all the money they need.
[2:51:32.540 --> 2:51:33.540]  They're after power.
[2:51:33.540 --> 2:51:34.540]  That's their aptitude.

[2:51:58.540 --> 2:52:01.540]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government,
[2:52:01.540 --> 2:52:04.540]  making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers,
[2:52:04.540 --> 2:52:05.540]  but legal to import.
[2:52:05.540 --> 2:52:09.540]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[2:52:09.540 --> 2:52:13.540]  Protein powder, seeds and oil are available through hempusa.org.

[2:52:29.540 --> 2:52:31.540]  Could this be the government's best kept secret?

[2:52:51.540 --> 2:52:54.540]  and its curse on world health is staggering.

[2:52:58.540 --> 2:53:01.540]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design,
[2:53:01.540 --> 2:53:06.540]  but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.

[2:53:47.540 --> 2:54:06.540]  Okay, Andres Van Mulo is going to be with us into the second part of this interview into the fourth hour.
[2:54:06.540 --> 2:54:09.540]  He agreed to come under the fourth hour and then misunderstood.
[2:54:09.540 --> 2:54:12.540]  He thought he was going to break, so he hung up. We're getting him back on.
[2:54:12.540 --> 2:54:17.540]  This is the fourth hour.
[2:54:17.540 --> 2:54:22.540]  And we're going to be taking your calls for Andres Van Mulo in the fourth hour.

[2:55:13.540 --> 2:55:15.540]  He's all with us now.
[2:55:15.540 --> 2:55:20.540]  And you'll be able to continue listening on your radio out there on the Internet or M or FM's.
[2:55:20.540 --> 2:55:25.540]  But you'll also be able to watch video of me and Studio with news articles and documents
[2:55:25.540 --> 2:55:28.540]  if you're a prison planet.tv member in the fourth hour.
[2:55:28.540 --> 2:55:34.540]  But if you're listening on the Internet, you'll want to switch streams and go over to infowars.com.
[2:55:34.540 --> 2:55:40.540]  Starting next Monday, the fourth hour will be on the Genesis Network as well, not just our network.
[2:55:40.540 --> 2:55:43.540]  Okay, we're about to break for a few minutes.
[2:55:43.540 --> 2:55:46.540]  Andres Van Mulo, Mr. Mulo, so you have time to take a little break.
[2:55:46.540 --> 2:55:50.540]  And you'll be back with us to take calls because you wanted to talk about the economy
[2:55:50.540 --> 2:55:53.540]  and also where you think the dollar's going and some other key issues.
[2:55:53.540 --> 2:55:59.540]  But before we end this hour, you've also written about criminal cultures in intelligence agencies.
[2:55:59.540 --> 2:56:02.540]  Maybe we'll have some time to get into that, sir.
[2:56:02.540 --> 2:56:05.540]  Sure.
[2:56:05.540 --> 2:56:11.540]  When did you first start discovering how much criminality was in government intelligence agencies?
[2:56:11.540 --> 2:56:21.540]  Well, there is not criminality at general days, no criminality within the intelligence agencies.
[2:56:21.540 --> 2:56:31.540]  But organized criminality is a wonderful weapon for secret services.
[2:56:31.540 --> 2:56:39.540]  Organized criminality is always opposed or normally opposed against the state government.
[2:56:39.540 --> 2:56:42.540]  So they have an enemy of your enemy.
[2:56:42.540 --> 2:56:52.540]  And these organized crime people, they know exactly where the weak points of your enemy are.
[2:56:52.540 --> 2:56:59.540]  You can break in, you can make deals with them, you can use them for drug transports,
[2:56:59.540 --> 2:57:09.540]  you can privilege them in order to bring drug money or drugs in areas where you, again,
[2:57:09.540 --> 2:57:18.540]  can use it as payment for things which criminality does for you.
[2:57:18.540 --> 2:57:24.540]  So if you think about it, it's a wonderful weapon and it's always used.
[2:57:24.540 --> 2:57:32.540]  And for example, if you are trying to bring within Turkey the Kurds against the central government,
[2:57:32.540 --> 2:57:45.540]  normally in the minority and majority in the multi-ethnic areas come along quite well with each other sometimes over centuries.
[2:57:45.540 --> 2:57:47.540]  Mr. Vamilo, stay with us.
[2:57:47.540 --> 2:57:48.540]  We're going to break.
[2:57:48.540 --> 2:57:52.540]  You've got a three-minute break and then we'll be right back with you as we start the fourth hour.
[2:57:52.540 --> 2:57:55.540]  Sir, thank you so much.
[2:57:55.540 --> 2:57:57.540]  Okay, we'll be back with Mr. Vamilo.
[2:57:57.540 --> 2:58:00.540]  We really appreciate him spending this much time with us.
[2:58:00.540 --> 2:58:06.540]  The fourth hour, the new fourth hour starts in about 70 seconds.
[2:58:06.540 --> 2:58:11.540]  We'll have a video intro of everybody watching on the web at prisonplanet.tv.
