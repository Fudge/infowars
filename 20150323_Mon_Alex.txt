[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:37.480]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:37.480 --> 00:42.440]  ladies and gentlemen Ted Cruz has announced he's running for president
[00:42.440 --> 00:46.800]  and I gotta tell you I like what he's running on repealing Obamacare and
[00:46.800 --> 00:53.680]  abolishing the internal revenue service which is in the single digits when it
[00:53.680 --> 00:59.560]  comes to its approval rating here in the United States very very exciting I
[00:59.560 --> 01:04.200]  know that Ted Cruz obviously isn't perfect his wife worked at Goldman
[01:04.200 --> 01:09.600]  Fax but so did know me Prince as a managing director and then she's gone
[01:09.600 --> 01:12.760]  public and spoken out against it and I know that she was a member of the
[01:12.760 --> 01:16.120]  council on foreign relations well they're about 10,000 members of that and
[01:16.120 --> 01:20.640]  that's the globalist trying to organize all the smartest people in the country
[01:20.640 --> 01:26.040]  so they can control them so if we ever discount someone because they've been
[01:26.040 --> 01:30.880]  part of the power structure we have a very low probability of ever changing the
[01:30.880 --> 01:38.720]  culture Ted Cruz has a pretty good voting record when I say pretty good
[01:38.720 --> 01:43.120]  he's hawkish on some issues but other than that he is what I'd call a
[01:43.120 --> 01:49.520]  constitutionalist slash libertarian style I would like to see he and Rand Paul
[01:49.520 --> 01:52.920]  team up that's not happening they're already starting to snipe at each other
[01:52.920 --> 01:57.200]  Rand Paul is going to announce on April 6th and I know Rand Paul a lot better
[01:57.200 --> 02:02.160]  than Ted Cruz and I I don't put all my eggs in one basket I know the
[02:02.160 --> 02:06.800]  presidential election becomes a diversion to a certain extent but there
[02:06.800 --> 02:12.360]  are a lot of people in the system who do not want to destroy the country and I
[02:12.360 --> 02:16.480]  believe Ted Cruz and Rand Paul are part of that so I want to open the phones up
[02:16.480 --> 02:21.080]  early in the hour what do you think of Ted Cruz's announcement we're going to
[02:21.080 --> 02:24.920]  play it we're going to get into it he calls for a new generation of
[02:24.920 --> 02:28.680]  conservatives kicks off campaign at world's largest Christian University
[02:28.680 --> 02:34.640]  releases his first ad in Spanish which is an excellent idea because you just have
[02:34.640 --> 02:38.720]  the socialists and globalists out there with the giant immigrant population
[02:38.720 --> 02:43.400]  that's mainly Latin American letting them literally brainwash them and so the
[02:43.400 --> 02:48.760]  answer is convert folks over to libertarian based ideas plus much of
[02:48.760 --> 02:54.560]  Latin America is hungry for freedom much of Latin America does not want to live
[02:54.560 --> 03:00.240]  under tyranny and of course Ted Cruz's father was a big opponent of Castro and
[03:00.240 --> 03:05.080]  so they have a lot of lessons there of not wanting to be underneath that type
[03:05.080 --> 03:09.360]  of tyranny but I don't think Ted Cruz is a man on a white horse who will save us
[03:09.360 --> 03:14.440]  I don't think Rand Paul is either I think both men are good people I know
[03:14.440 --> 03:20.800]  Rand Paul for 20 years I was one of the first people to ever interview Rand Paul
[03:20.800 --> 03:24.520]  back when we'd already got his dad on and they had a big success having
[03:24.520 --> 03:27.560]  him on the show he's running for Congress in 96 and they said in the
[03:27.560 --> 03:32.760]  campaign said hey have Rand on he's just now starting to do interviews and so
[03:32.760 --> 03:38.880]  that said it's beyond it's beyond Republican or Democrat at this point if
[03:38.880 --> 03:43.160]  there were Democrats out there that weren't totally anti-gun totally anti-
[03:43.160 --> 03:50.400]  family totally anti-sovereignty then I would be for them as well Ted Cruz was
[03:50.400 --> 03:58.200]  against arming al-Qaeda in Syria so was Rand Paul I mean when you compare them
[03:58.200 --> 04:04.520]  to Hillary Clinton or a John Boehner or a Michelle Obama or Michael Moore it's
[04:04.520 --> 04:13.240]  night and day tell me if you disagree with that 800 259 92 31 first-time
[04:13.240 --> 04:16.680]  callers in the first hour then we'll have open phones everybody in the second

[04:22.320 --> 04:29.240]  to continue the discussion from yesterday about the army training documents
[04:29.240 --> 04:33.640]  special operations command a joint forces drill in eight states listening
[04:33.640 --> 04:39.200]  Texas and Utah as hostile some say oh Fort Braggs had drills outside the base
[04:39.200 --> 04:44.280]  for decades yeah that's not this this is practicing working with local police
[04:44.280 --> 04:48.760]  under North com it's an admitted mission to take over the country so you're
[04:48.760 --> 04:52.400]  shy off to condition this doesn't work and it's not working on the troops either
[04:52.400 --> 04:58.560]  we can talk about that the missing nukes 800 2599 231 those three subjects

[08:27.160 --> 08:33.080]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. till 2 p.m. central standard time we're here
[08:33.080 --> 08:40.560]  live it's Monday the 23rd day of March 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones we're
[08:40.560 --> 08:45.520]  gonna open the phones up in this first hour on the Ted Cruz announcement
[08:45.520 --> 08:54.720]  running for president in 2016 I want to be clear I don't completely trust Ted
[08:54.720 --> 08:59.200]  Cruz I don't completely trust anybody in DC because of the blackmail the threats
[08:59.200 --> 09:03.280]  the harassment but he has a very good voting record he stood up against
[09:03.280 --> 09:07.600]  arming al-Qaeda to attack Syria when no other so-called conservative leaders
[09:07.600 --> 09:13.080]  would do it but Rand Paul he wants to abolish the IRS and his pledge to do so
[09:13.080 --> 09:19.280]  and he wants to repeal Obamacare we are not getting that out of anybody else but
[09:19.280 --> 09:24.000]  Rand Paul clearly the true libertarian slash constitutionalist conservatives
[09:24.000 --> 09:31.880]  that uphold basic American values are senator Ted Cruz and senator Rand Paul
[09:31.880 --> 09:40.040]  that's it in the field not Huckabee not any of them because some people think oh
[09:40.040 --> 09:45.360]  well you know Huckabee he's the answer good guys out there like Chuck Norris
[09:45.360 --> 09:53.040]  and others now again Ted Cruz is slick Ted Cruz is smart Ted Cruz is from the
[09:53.040 --> 09:57.600]  establishment but there's large elements of the establishment that want to be
[09:57.600 --> 10:01.760]  free market that want to be wealthy that want to be successful that want
[10:01.760 --> 10:05.960]  America to not go the cloward and piven bankruptcy route into social
[10:05.960 --> 10:11.800]  engineering and socialism so there's the choice there is the Michael Moore
[10:11.800 --> 10:20.560]  Nancy Pelosi cloward and piven Hillary Clinton school lunch program Gulag on one
[10:20.560 --> 10:27.040]  end and then there is the Rand Paul Ted Cruz spectrum on the other and I'm
[10:27.040 --> 10:31.280]  going to hate to see these two guys that are so close to each other on policies
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.760]  and whose bases are basically the same people destroy each other and there's
[10:36.760 --> 10:45.360]  already some of that starting do I think Ted Cruz or Rand Paul save America no
[10:45.360 --> 10:49.600]  but if we get this bad attitude that we're always going to lose that we can
[10:49.600 --> 10:52.960]  never reform the country that we can never have victories people will not be
[10:52.960 --> 10:56.640]  energized they will have a fatalist attitude we'll lose everything even if
[10:56.640 --> 11:00.600]  Ted Cruz runs or Rand Paul runs which they're both are obviously Ted Cruz is
[11:00.600 --> 11:04.640]  now announced officially Rand Paul's been already campaigning for years good
[11:04.640 --> 11:10.960]  year and a half they will energize a Liberty movement and ideas at the state
[11:10.960 --> 11:16.120]  county and city level like Ron Paul did Ted Cruz Rand Paul and others now stand
[11:16.120 --> 11:20.440]  on the shoulders of not Ron Paul who was just a focal point but of the
[11:20.440 --> 11:24.640]  supporters of Ron Paul and the tens of millions of dollars that were given and
[11:24.640 --> 11:30.160]  the thousands of speeches and the TV ads and all of that created a focal point
[11:30.160 --> 11:40.440]  for opposition to the globalist paradigm to form and so many people on Liberty
[11:40.440 --> 11:43.880]  movement are just sitting there getting guns and you know prepping getting
[11:43.880 --> 11:48.160]  ready for a collapse and just to take care of themselves and you've got to do
[11:48.160 --> 11:57.040]  that maybe 30% of the time in my view while at the same time 70% of the time
[11:57.040 --> 12:02.080]  being offensive in the info war to blame the globalist for our problems so that
[12:02.080 --> 12:05.880]  Liberty and free market and capitalism doesn't get blamed that's their plan
[12:05.880 --> 12:11.280]  they exacerbate or create the crisis and then offer their solution more
[12:11.280 --> 12:18.920]  kleptocratic progressive social engineering more wealth redistribution
[12:18.920 --> 12:27.280]  more collectivism so there's a battle intellectually over collectivism
[12:27.280 --> 12:34.280]  totalitarianism control freakism and basic Americana Renaissance Liberty that
[12:34.280 --> 12:38.880]  should unify conservative and liberal alike in the modern spectrum because it's
[12:38.880 --> 12:45.120]  called freedom and it should be restored it shouldn't be under attack
[12:46.400 --> 12:52.680]  there is a battle and we are inches away from removing Boehner we are inches
[12:52.680 --> 12:58.200]  away from having a tea party libertarian constitutionalist takeover of the
[12:58.200 --> 13:02.600]  Republicans I've been talking about this for a decade but if you go back to the
[13:02.600 --> 13:09.000]  last few years in leaps democratic party speeches to billionaire donors when
[13:09.000 --> 13:21.280]  you start ferreting in and you start digging in deeper to all of this and you
[13:21.280 --> 13:24.880]  start looking into the Republican leadership as well they're all
[13:24.880 --> 13:29.880]  combining funds they're all combining propaganda they're all combining forces
[13:29.880 --> 13:37.560]  to try to stop a libertarian constitutional-styled movement
[13:40.600 --> 13:50.760]  taking over Congress and the states why do you think the Pentagon seized by the
[13:50.760 --> 13:57.240]  globalist the the the new world order directed Pentagon is openly turning into
[13:57.240 --> 14:03.400]  a federal occupation global occupation force and training to confiscate guns
[14:03.400 --> 14:10.640]  and training to take over the infrastructure and now admitting it in
[14:10.640 --> 14:15.440]  the Army times stars and stripes and everywhere else because they are
[14:15.440 --> 14:20.520]  preparing to go operational if they need to if the states get together in a
[14:20.520 --> 14:23.960]  coalition recognize the federal government's been hijacked and is out of
[14:23.960 --> 14:28.800]  control and try to reconstitute the Republic they're going to try to move in
[14:28.800 --> 14:37.560]  and block us they are trying to sign the Trans Pacific partnership in secret
[14:37.560 --> 14:45.200]  right now it's in CNBC the Guardian you name it and all 33 sections are secret
[14:45.200 --> 14:50.400]  except for one leaked by WikiLeaks and that gives total Chinese style
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.320]  censorship communist Chinese style censorship to the unelected corporate
[14:55.320 --> 14:59.400]  board and guess who's involved the communist government of China so there
[14:59.400 --> 15:06.720]  is a major global meltdown power grab going on right now and America is now
[15:06.720 --> 15:13.360]  reaching the event horizon the point of no return we're either going to slow
[15:13.360 --> 15:19.240]  this down and start turning it around or we're going to go down fast you're
[15:19.240 --> 15:22.720]  going to see more globalist power grabbing in the next few years and
[15:22.720 --> 15:25.120]  you've seen your whole life you know I've been saying that the last few years
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.560]  and suddenly you're seeing it internet power grabs energy power grabs
[15:28.560 --> 15:34.720]  sovereignty being imploded signing global treaties in secret orders they're
[15:34.720 --> 15:38.240]  now announcing that they won't release any documents from the White House on
[15:38.240 --> 15:42.960]  any subject totally illegal they're just gonna violate the open records act
[15:42.960 --> 15:49.120]  FEMA to deny funds to warming deniers think about what an Orwellian term that
[15:49.120 --> 15:54.040]  is states who oppose whose governors refuse to acknowledge climate change
[15:54.040 --> 15:59.640]  will not get prepared and assayed you either accept global government global
[15:59.640 --> 16:07.400]  carbon taxes that's Philly comm or you will not get your state money that was
[16:07.400 --> 16:13.720]  taken sit back to you this is just the announcement today two weeks ago Obama
[16:13.720 --> 16:17.240]  came out and he said it again last week he's preparing executive action on tax
[16:17.240 --> 16:21.800]  increases he pledged not to raise taxes on anybody making less than a quarter
[16:21.800 --> 16:25.920]  million he raised it on people that are blue collar at the poverty line and
[16:25.920 --> 16:30.800]  they've raised a bunch of other taxes and now he's talking about executive
[16:30.800 --> 16:35.520]  action presidents don't have taxing authority that comes out of Congress I
[16:35.520 --> 16:41.920]  know you know that but notice executive ammo bands they're not backing down on
[16:41.920 --> 16:51.960]  that there's an article on info wars.com on that subject so we've now reached the
[16:51.960 --> 16:57.440]  tipping point on every front I'm gonna ask the callers what do we do do we
[16:57.440 --> 17:02.800]  support Ted Cruz Rand Paul or we purists and say oh they're obviously not
[17:02.800 --> 17:09.320]  100% perfect they're not Jesus Christ we're not gonna support them and do you
[17:09.320 --> 17:13.640]  agree with me that we're at this key juncture this crossroads this this event
[17:13.640 --> 17:18.800]  horizon and what's the next big shoe to drop they're power grabbing every day
[17:18.800 --> 17:23.120]  now more is happening in a week that used to happen in a year I mean it's
[17:23.120 --> 17:27.560]  hyperdrive right now I cringe every morning when I get up at 6 a.m. to see
[17:27.560 --> 17:33.200]  what new nightmare has occurred while I was sleeping I just got stacks of
[17:33.200 --> 17:40.720]  tyranny here in front of me eight hundred two five nine nine two three
[17:40.720 --> 17:48.680]  one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one let's take one phone call
[17:48.680 --> 17:52.800]  before we go to break John in Idaho what do you think about Ted Cruz in his
[17:52.800 --> 17:57.600]  announcement running for president plans to repeal Obamacare abolish the IRS
[17:57.600 --> 18:04.120]  how you doing I'm all right brother go ahead first let me say I was 19 when I
[18:04.120 --> 18:10.440]  started listening to you I'm 26 now and I do feel like we are at the event
[18:10.440 --> 18:16.120]  horizon like he says but that being said I feel like Ted Cruz it doesn't really
[18:16.120 --> 18:22.840]  matter the Congress is a fiat system and answers a grassroots awakening it has
[18:22.840 --> 18:29.320]  start with the people first not by someone who is in office I agree with
[18:29.320 --> 18:33.440]  you that the powers with the people but someone like a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz a
[18:33.440 --> 18:40.600]  Ted Cruz they can give a 27 hours you know almost record filibuster and what
[18:40.600 --> 18:45.680]  he stands for getting rid of the IRS abolishing the fellow reserve repealing
[18:45.680 --> 18:51.000]  Obamacare I mean he's being demonized by the power structure because they're
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.520]  scared of him same thing with Rand Paul I just think that just because he
[18:56.520 --> 19:02.280]  represents at least on the surface our ideas we need to support him and Rand
[19:02.280 --> 19:10.920]  Paul I like Rand Paul better I think Ted Cruz is probably slicker probably a
[19:10.920 --> 19:17.720]  little bit smarter and Rand Paul super smart and he's got a Spanish surname
[19:17.720 --> 19:22.480]  which is great I mean I'd I'd love to have a you know Latin America go

[24:44.040 --> 24:48.200]  doing Democrats have not given up on ammo ban New York Democrat plans to lean
[24:48.200 --> 24:53.240]  on new ATF boss that's in full wars comm big bang theory could be debunked by

[25:02.400 --> 25:06.480]  implode it but yeah whatever NATO chiefs as Russia still sending arms to
[25:06.480 --> 25:12.200]  Ukraine UPI like they caught Russia in something NATO sending in armored
[25:12.200 --> 25:17.120]  brigades Putin admits he's got troops in Ukraine now but they keep acting like
[25:17.120 --> 25:20.640]  Russia's hiding it and I'm not defending Russia it's just these are tricks they
[25:20.640 --> 25:27.680]  played to manipulate the public like I saw John McCain on CNN Sunday calling you
[25:27.680 --> 25:31.680]  know Thomas Obama of throwing temper tantrums as if he's against Obama in
[25:31.680 --> 25:36.880]  policy it's all a ruse and saying I ran and ISIS must be taken down in the
[25:36.880 --> 25:42.440]  region well implying I ran was behind ISIS playing on the idiot viewers of
[25:42.440 --> 25:51.000]  CNN Chinese economy dangles on a cliff key article organic dairy farming
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.200]  struggles to keep up with demand very positive article of the Star Tribune
[25:54.200 --> 25:58.400]  showing how the organic movement is just taking over and is so lucrative and so
[25:58.400 --> 26:02.160]  that means other people will get into it it will take over the industry this is
[26:02.160 --> 26:07.160]  how easy it is to defeat the globalist is having a revolution of ideas folks they
[26:07.160 --> 26:10.800]  always brand revolution is violent so that you'll only think violence is the
[26:10.800 --> 26:14.640]  way to go because again a peaceful revolution just takes over and you never
[26:14.640 --> 26:20.200]  know what happened ruins found in remote Argentinian jungle maybe secret
[26:20.200 --> 26:23.320]  Nazi hideout the Guardian really interesting article we're gonna cover
[26:23.320 --> 26:32.200]  that right out of Indiana Jones and the Raiders the Lost Ark that's just some
[26:32.200 --> 26:37.120]  of what's coming up today but let's go to your calls James in Utah you're on the
[26:37.120 --> 26:39.400]  air what do you think about the presidential race we're talking Ted
[26:39.400 --> 26:45.360]  Cruz go ahead I got my opinion on Ted and Rand but first I just want to say
[26:45.360 --> 26:50.120]  here here in Utah I think one of the reasons why it's the hot zones because
[26:50.120 --> 26:54.360]  everybody knows their neighbor you know I know the next 40 people down the
[26:54.360 --> 26:58.560]  street and you know there are a lot of preppers here a lot of more people like
[26:58.560 --> 27:03.720]  to have food storage and weapons and you know yesterday you said that you think
[27:03.720 --> 27:07.080]  the Mormons have infiltrated everything I just want to get your opinion on that
[27:07.080 --> 27:13.520]  but I think Ted Cruz I mean we needed back somebody so it's not Bush going up
[27:13.520 --> 27:20.000]  against Hillary but I think Ray might be at the better choice but it's still
[27:20.000 --> 27:26.040]  gonna be the same you know business as usual even if we do get them in well
[27:26.040 --> 27:28.560]  sure they're not gonna be able to get everything done because they have both
[27:28.560 --> 27:31.600]  said they would act as constitutionalist as Ron Paul said he would have he got
[27:31.600 --> 27:36.360]  elected so he can't just dictatorially do whatever they want but with a bully
[27:36.360 --> 27:40.640]  pulpit truly going after Obamacare that's 70 something percent unpopular and
[27:40.640 --> 27:44.680]  unconstitutional and going after the IRS that's totally unconstitutional and
[27:44.680 --> 27:50.600]  unpopular we could really reform things and have a boom I mean if any country
[27:50.600 --> 27:53.760]  could reverse the globalist it's America that's why they're focusing their
[27:53.760 --> 27:59.960]  takeover here I appreciate your call when I said Mormons have infiltrated
[27:59.960 --> 28:04.440]  everything I said the Liberty movement's infiltrated everything and I'm not
[28:04.440 --> 28:09.240]  weighing in on people that love Mormons or hate Mormons or whatever I'll just
[28:09.240 --> 28:13.240]  have a lot of Mormons that are listeners and the Mormons I know seem
[28:13.240 --> 28:16.800]  to be pretty well informed about the New World Order takeover plan and so I was
[28:16.800 --> 28:20.560]  saying the globalists have a big problem that the military is super awake to
[28:20.560 --> 28:26.320]  what's happening the Mormons have made a public point of putting their people in
[28:26.320 --> 28:33.840]  the military the FBI you name it and so it's a real problem for the power
[28:33.840 --> 28:38.760]  structure I know you can say well but look at Harry Reid and look at you know
[28:38.760 --> 28:42.160]  these other top Mormons that are so evil well you could just say those are
[28:42.160 --> 28:46.440]  globalist infiltrators of the Mormons regardless I've said the Mormons if they
[28:46.440 --> 28:49.640]  wanted to really you know do something should excommunicate people like Harry
[28:49.640 --> 28:55.480]  Reid I mean an abortion loving anti-gun piece of trash I mean Harry Reid is a
[28:55.480 --> 29:01.440]  devil and that was the point I was making on that front but we were getting
[29:01.440 --> 29:05.720]  into feds preparing to invade Texas Liz State is hostile and then the media is
[29:05.720 --> 29:10.240]  like well I mean we always do drills yes drills to take over the states and we
[29:10.240 --> 29:16.080]  were saying why do they target Texas and Utah in the West and then San Diego and
[29:16.080 --> 29:20.000]  Orange County it's basically saying anything libertarian or conservative is
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.520]  the enemy and so that's where I was going with that how the US military would
[29:25.520 --> 29:29.480]  crush a tea party rebellion ties into all of this so the government the
[29:29.480 --> 29:34.280]  illegitimate government is gearing up but they've got a problem people that
[29:34.280 --> 29:38.560]  love liberty I don't care if they're a Baptist an atheist a Mormon black white
[29:38.560 --> 29:44.600]  Hispanic there's a huge uprising in Brazil that's libertarian I mean people
[29:44.600 --> 29:49.120]  are sick of it they know big government serves the special interest we're on the

[35:13.200 --> 35:17.960]  training to take on gun owners veterans conservatives pro-lifers
[35:17.960 --> 35:21.960]  christians the ford hood documents that we got last year that were on fox news
[35:21.960 --> 35:26.880]  after we got them the army leaked them to us saying you'll be court marshaled

[35:31.040 --> 35:36.200]  as the enemy because we're real americans that know what's going on and so we put
[35:36.200 --> 35:43.960]  out the report from army dot mill and now today they have stars and stripes
[35:43.960 --> 35:51.960]  countering us and they say we can't verify these reports put out on the
[35:51.960 --> 36:00.680]  internet because a firewall won't let the army get to the document and you
[36:00.680 --> 36:05.040]  know that's what they did it was on the army's website and they basically hit
[36:05.040 --> 36:12.000]  it and so now they're saying we can't verify the scribe website the document
[36:12.000 --> 36:19.400]  site oh yeah but we are doing this drill as they say no it's real they did this
[36:19.400 --> 36:22.680]  with the mic reports and all the rest of them at first they'd say we can't
[36:22.680 --> 36:25.280]  verify for about a week so they could say we were making it up and then later
[36:25.280 --> 36:30.520]  okay yeah it's real uh-huh same tactic with the FCC not releasing their
[36:30.520 --> 36:34.920]  regulations for two weeks stars and stripes army special operations command
[36:34.920 --> 36:40.600]  pushes back against the alarmist claims about upcoming exercises and they go on
[36:40.600 --> 36:44.880]  and say we're endangering lives but they won't even name us because they don't
[36:44.880 --> 36:49.760]  want folks going and actually reading what we're saying let me tell stars and
[36:49.760 --> 36:56.520]  stripes something your own publication has probably had 20 articles in the last
[36:56.520 --> 37:02.880]  ten years admitting that brigade homeland and the plan to then over the
[37:02.880 --> 37:07.960]  next decade that started the decade ago to transition 400 plus thousand trips
[37:07.960 --> 37:12.360]  from active duty to brigade homeland to have brigades in every sector of the
[37:12.360 --> 37:16.280]  country and emerge with the threat fusion centers of the police everybody
[37:16.280 --> 37:19.680]  knows the military's training with the police secretly everybody knows who
[37:19.680 --> 37:25.200]  they're trained to take on they'll do public drills out at Camp Mavery where
[37:25.200 --> 37:30.120]  they'll have a guy in a mula beard you know in a mula outfit being chased by
[37:30.120 --> 37:35.440]  helicopters for a bunch of tourists to watch my cousin was on that duty a few
[37:35.440 --> 37:40.400]  years ago and my dad went out and watched it it was just ridiculous that's for
[37:40.400 --> 37:45.400]  public consumption we all know what really goes on on the basis and we know
[37:45.400 --> 37:50.120]  who you're training to go after basically a cross between grandpa in a John
[37:50.120 --> 37:55.640]  Deere hat and John Wayne and we know about it because of the military and we
[37:55.640 --> 38:02.240]  have literally thousands of documents and then we have my film police state to
[38:02.240 --> 38:06.920]  the takeover that has the actual document given to us by an FBI agent in
[38:06.920 --> 38:17.720]  Belton Texas and officers was named officers smart comes over and says you
[38:17.720 --> 38:21.880]  can't videotape this and then the FBI pulls up and gives to my hands of my
[38:21.880 --> 38:27.640]  camera guy on video says here you can have this now I told you get out of
[38:27.640 --> 38:35.360]  here and then he got in the car and it said restricted and I still don't know
[38:35.360 --> 38:38.680]  the FBI gave us that on purpose or by accident because the guy got in his car
[38:38.680 --> 38:53.120]  and drove off and by the way it'd been previously secret it had previously been
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.880]  secret I said I'd go to your calls it's just so frustrating to sit there and
[38:57.880 --> 39:02.400]  watch stars and stripes play stupid and go we don't know the documents real the
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.000]  army can't get it oh yeah we can't but the army does say that they are having
[39:07.000 --> 39:14.400]  this operation and then they'll spin it we're against the army and of course
[39:14.400 --> 39:23.120]  it's so predictable we want lives to be lost the document refers to hostile
[39:23.120 --> 39:35.520]  insurgent pocket I'm so sick of all this I'm sick of them lying to us but
[39:35.520 --> 39:41.480]  remember what was in the Washington Post last year in 2014 CIA domestic
[39:41.480 --> 39:46.960]  propaganda legalized let's put that on screen for new viewers who are doubting
[39:46.960 --> 39:54.120]  us that means lying to you supposedly legalized propaganda now legal in US
[39:54.120 --> 40:03.200]  they've been doing it forever but now they're doing it on a massive scale I'm
[40:03.200 --> 40:10.880]  on a search engine it we go to the old NSA interface it was in foreign affairs
[40:10.880 --> 40:16.240]  that's a publication of the Washington Post
[40:17.440 --> 40:28.480]  propaganda legalized in us see that brings it up the NDAA legalizes the use
[40:28.480 --> 40:35.120]  of propaganda inside the US that's Business Insider the Defense
[40:35.120 --> 40:38.640]  Authorization Act the newest version of the National Defense Authorization Act
[40:38.640 --> 40:42.400]  includes an amendment that would legalize the use of propaganda on the
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.360]  American public reports Michael Hastings of Buzzfeed oh you know what
[40:46.360 --> 40:49.800]  happened to Michael Hastings his car blew up he said oh my security's coming to
[40:49.800 --> 40:54.640]  get me I'm running for my life boom the amendment proposed by Mac Thornberry and
[40:54.640 --> 41:01.360]  then it goes through it and by the way it was adopted here's foreign policy the
[41:01.360 --> 41:04.840]  Washington Post this is the one I wanted the one I'm pulling up right now
[41:04.840 --> 41:15.000]  US repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news to Americans you
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.880]  guys do a great job finding stuff just for me you have trouble with that one so
[41:17.880 --> 41:21.120]  you might be searching news instead of web of something's about a year old when
[41:21.120 --> 41:24.560]  you're looking at foreign policy we're looking for Washington Post yeah
[41:24.560 --> 41:28.360]  no foreign policy is a division of the Washington Post she also knows you can
[41:28.360 --> 41:32.000]  also search Washington Post and find it but it's fine you guys are better than I
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.640]  am at searching this stuff anyways there it is for you I guess they'll have
[41:35.640 --> 41:41.160]  stars and stripes come out and tell me I'm lying about that too oh no where is
[41:41.160 --> 41:54.400]  it in here we're endangering their law their lives with our lives mm-hmm that's
[41:54.400 --> 41:57.480]  right we're as bad as Al Qaeda folks as you know because we don't want to turn
[41:57.480 --> 42:01.720]  our guns in okay I'm gonna shut up go to your calls Chris in South Carolina go
[42:01.720 --> 42:07.120]  ahead you're on the air yes sir I was calling about the mix and new stuff
[42:07.120 --> 42:13.880]  bad idea of what they possibly could do with these nukes for a while and my
[42:13.880 --> 42:17.840]  opinion is they got a lot of stuff going on and just like they got the race thing
[42:17.840 --> 42:23.560]  going on they got us going and saying that you know the Tea Party is gonna you
[42:23.560 --> 42:28.000]  know go with ISIS and so on and so forth truthfully in my opinion I believe
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.360]  they know that America won't believe that and so they're using that and in
[42:33.360 --> 42:39.680]  pretext to actually to keep us you know more or less kind of confused that's
[42:39.680 --> 42:46.200]  right there was an army war college training drill about four years ago
[42:46.200 --> 42:52.960]  predicting and in a simulation that the Tea Party on the east coast I think in
[42:52.960 --> 42:57.240]  that drill it was Georgia had linked up with ISIS and Al Qaeda they didn't say
[42:57.240 --> 43:01.120]  ISIS and it's just totally ridiculous to claim that the Tea Party would ever
[43:01.120 --> 43:04.960]  work with radical Islamists and that's that's just total bull but they don't
[43:04.960 --> 43:09.200]  care they want to sell narratives that are upside down to demonize their enemy
[43:09.200 --> 43:14.320]  show go ahead but what I really believe but they're doing because you see how
[43:14.320 --> 43:16.560]  they pull that thing out with Russia where they were talking about they're
[43:16.560 --> 43:21.920]  gonna send Russia's home in body bags now a few months back Russia invaded the
[43:21.920 --> 43:26.800]  airspace when I'm mistaken our air that you know they brought stuff over in our
[43:26.800 --> 43:33.240]  airspace I'm gonna say it was the Gulf of Mexico no they've been coming in to
[43:33.240 --> 43:39.520]  East Coast airspace Alaskan airspace and Gulf of Mexico airspace I believe what
[43:39.520 --> 43:44.200]  they're going to do is keep Russia they want to take down Russia and this is
[43:44.200 --> 43:48.440]  almost like a killed two birds with one stone thing sure so what why do you
[43:48.440 --> 43:52.680]  think the nukes are missing I believe the nukes are missing because they're going
[43:52.680 --> 43:57.040]  to be around at same time was the time that all this stuff was going on and
[43:57.040 --> 44:01.080]  they started causing these things in Crimea I believe that are using that
[44:01.080 --> 44:04.280]  and they're gonna actually say that the new the nukes are gonna hit us and
[44:04.280 --> 44:09.200]  Russia did it but that way it brings everybody in unison including the Tea
[44:09.200 --> 44:12.720]  Party and everything else because we need to fight back against what they want
[44:12.720 --> 44:17.080]  to disappear the nukes so that they can have plausible liability and maybe
[44:17.080 --> 44:22.080]  refit them with different isotopes so that they can fingerprint into the
[44:22.080 --> 44:25.280]  Russians you know I used to think they'd have to do that but they've done the
[44:25.280 --> 44:28.000]  public down so much it wouldn't even matter if experts came out and said the
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.640]  isotopes show that it's a NATO weapon because reality doesn't matter anymore
[44:32.640 --> 44:38.400]  you got a good point Chris that could be it let's go ahead and I'm sorry go ahead
[44:38.400 --> 44:42.600]  I don't want to say hey to you she's been begging me do you do you would you mind
[44:42.600 --> 44:47.440]  saying hello sure what's her name her name is Alyssa hold on one second
[44:47.440 --> 44:56.840]  hey Alyssa how you doing well it's a pleasure to talk to you hope you guys
[44:56.840 --> 45:02.800]  are doing well there in South Carolina where you concern when Lindsey Graham
[45:02.800 --> 45:11.080]  told CBS News that nukes could go off any minutes in Charleston okay I think
[45:11.080 --> 45:16.000]  that's his daughter okay take care gonna talk to you Chris if you just tuned in
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.360]  we're talking about missing nukes over the weekend Bloomberg Daily Beast and a
[45:19.360 --> 45:22.880]  whole bunch of other publications came out because Centorum was asked about it
[45:22.880 --> 45:29.560]  on the campaign trail at a town hall there's actually video of it and they
[45:29.560 --> 45:33.760]  then spun it basically to make a joke out of it they'd always had a news black
[45:33.760 --> 45:39.440]  out on the missing Dias Air Force base warheads that we exposed back on
[45:39.440 --> 45:45.960]  September 3rd of last year no of 2013 almost two years ago Dylan in Texas
[45:45.960 --> 45:48.960]  thanks for holding you're on the air
[45:51.960 --> 45:57.640]  Gary yep sure can okay appreciate how's it going Alex good brother yeah I think
[45:57.640 --> 46:03.040]  I don't I don't know if Ted Cruz matters that much I mean from a talking
[46:03.040 --> 46:08.080]  standpoint he sounds pretty good I mean so does every other president when
[46:08.080 --> 46:11.920]  they're running but I mean I think honestly if this guy was actually ready
[46:11.920 --> 46:15.840]  to do anything he would be having his all-star team or you know a group of
[46:15.840 --> 46:20.480]  like-minded people with them in the quote-unquote war room essentially we if
[46:20.480 --> 46:26.320]  you if you will and be trying to take this down or fix it right now you know
[46:26.320 --> 46:32.400]  instead of going everywhere and doing speeches well there is an approach to
[46:32.400 --> 46:36.040]  basically come out and say we're in an emergency the borders are being imploded
[46:36.040 --> 46:40.200]  we're being put under the Trans-Pacific Partnership without a congressional
[46:40.200 --> 46:45.320]  vote we're in a red-level crisis we need to do something now that's actually a
[46:45.320 --> 46:49.720]  pretty smart tactic it's even politically to get attention to yourself
[46:49.720 --> 46:55.480]  actually leading the problem is there's such a political class in DC it tends
[46:55.480 --> 47:00.240]  to swallow you up all I'm saying is is that at least his rhetoric and his
[47:00.240 --> 47:05.600]  voting record are pretty good talking about repealing Obamacare and
[47:05.600 --> 47:13.400]  abolishing the IRS is very exciting oh absolutely another thing with the the
[47:13.400 --> 47:18.800]  martial law will they have a style for the martial law is is I mean what are
[47:18.800 --> 47:23.360]  we gonna do about this I mean I've tried to talk to so many people about this
[47:23.360 --> 47:28.120]  you know and there's so many people not understanding what's actually happening
[47:28.120 --> 47:32.320]  because they're not you know informed of what's actually happening globally and
[47:32.320 --> 47:37.200]  economically so everybody's walking around just you know basically like
[47:37.200 --> 47:41.080]  zombies so what do we what do we do what what's the next step that we do how do
[47:41.080 --> 47:46.960]  we take this even further without you know causing any type of of animosity
[47:46.960 --> 47:50.560]  between anybody well here's here's what's going on I appreciate your call
[47:50.560 --> 47:56.200]  Dylan we're gonna go to Barry and others here in just a moment it comes down to
[47:56.200 --> 48:00.200]  this television is what did this television is what gave the system the
[48:00.200 --> 48:06.320]  venue to brainwash the unified propaganda and to turn us into lazy jellyfish
[48:06.320 --> 48:12.920]  intellectually who just watch we are now a nation a world of spectators and so the
[48:12.920 --> 48:16.200]  average person may not like what's happening but they can't imagine
[48:16.200 --> 48:22.080]  themselves in the role of changing it that's why voting with your dollars or
[48:22.080 --> 48:31.680]  your euros is so important because soon you won't be able to get unorganic milk
[48:31.680 --> 48:36.680]  soon you won't be able to find GMO at the current growth rate of purchasing of
[48:36.680 --> 48:44.720]  non GMO this is just a microcosm example when you look at it the big scheme of
[48:44.720 --> 48:49.440]  things of how culturally we can change things and we are a nation of consumers
[48:49.440 --> 48:56.040]  now but it's the one place we act is when we buy we're a nation of jellyfish
[48:56.040 --> 49:01.960]  that's why they want Amazon and stuff to know what you're gonna order before you
[49:01.960 --> 49:06.600]  order it and pre-order and don't shop don't come in because they just don't
[49:06.600 --> 49:11.360]  want you thinking because if you ever think it's chain reaction it sounds
[49:11.360 --> 49:17.000]  simple but Monsanto is on its knees McDonald's is on its knees Coca-Cola is
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.720]  on its knees these are not Americana companies these are predatory companies
[49:21.720 --> 49:27.600]  Coca-Cola's angelic compared to Monsanto or McDonald's the point is they fund
[49:27.600 --> 49:34.380]  the globalist operations as well and so if you can take down the big lead
[49:34.380 --> 49:38.960]  elephants the others are gonna run and if people ever catch on to the fact that
[49:38.960 --> 49:42.960]  hey you got more than just your voting power you're voting with your dollar
[49:42.960 --> 49:46.640]  power you've got other things you can do culturally it's over for the globalist
[49:46.640 --> 49:52.280]  we're gonna go to break and come back and go to Barry and Peter and Sparrow
[49:52.280 --> 49:55.920]  and Joey and many others first-time callers what do you think about Ted
[49:55.920 --> 49:59.120]  Cruz what do you think about the military openly training to take on the
[49:59.120 --> 50:04.240]  American people and this weak response from Stars and Stripes implying nothing's
[50:04.240 --> 50:11.960]  happening it's all conditioning it's all a Psyop they admit that toll-free

[54:18.320 --> 54:25.380]  month the establishment Democrats don't even want Hillary Clinton the
[54:25.380 --> 54:28.600]  establishment Republicans don't even want Jeb Bush because they know he can't
[54:28.600 --> 54:34.480]  sell lies now the question is is Ted Cruz the 21st century version of a Jeb
[54:34.480 --> 54:39.580]  Bush I don't know but regardless the fact that he puts out rhetoric the
[54:39.580 --> 54:44.320]  opposite of Hillary Clinton is needed we're in an intellectual battle we need
[54:44.320 --> 54:48.280]  to talk about abolishing the IRS or the Federal Reserve we need to push for that

[57:11.840 --> 57:17.400]  take on the presidential race and Ted Cruz officially launching today I watch
[57:17.400 --> 57:22.560]  that Ted Cruz deal on television I thought he had a lot of good rhetoric I
[57:22.560 --> 57:31.480]  would side more with Rand Paul although I think elections in America are rigged
[57:31.480 --> 57:36.920]  I think our government has already been taken over even if Rand Paul was a great
[57:36.920 --> 57:41.640]  guy was somebody that would come in and bring change I think that the globalists
[57:41.640 --> 57:49.240]  would take him out sort of the same way they took JFK out so it's kind of a
[57:49.240 --> 57:55.080]  lose-lose in that sort of a situation and one of I love you I've been listening
[57:55.080 --> 58:01.760]  to you for years and I'm a 27 year old veteran I was honorably discharged a
[58:01.760 --> 58:07.240]  year ago in February and now I'm actually a Nordene pastor and I use a lot of
[58:07.240 --> 58:12.360]  this stuff I get from your show in my sermons at church so like I talk about

[58:24.400 --> 58:32.080]  confused is I mean I see I see prophecy in this I don't know about you and I do

[59:41.120 --> 59:47.760]  your family visit info wars life comm or call 1-888-253-3139 that's info wars
[59:47.760 --> 1:00:07.160]  life comm you're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream
[1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:14.520]  media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:23.480]  on the GCN radio network at now and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones 20
[1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:28.440]  years ago I would read articles out of MIT publications or an occasional BBC
[1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:34.800]  article about transhumanist UN plans to establish a planetary government and
[1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:43.320]  merges with machines now I see them every day the decision has been made
[1:00:43.320 --> 1:00:47.760]  that's the problem we're following a global plan we're going under world
[1:00:47.760 --> 1:00:54.600]  government now via secret treaties that's in CNBC today they go on CNBC and
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:01:00.000]  say we're under world government run by private banks we're all slaves they say
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:16.320]  that all the time so in many ways my broadcasts become obsolete and I kind of
[1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:28.320]  pause there not on purpose it's just having that realization because we've
[1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:33.720]  gone from just trying to warn people it was coming and now it's here and and then
[1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:39.000]  stars and stripes puts out an article basically lying implying we're lying
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:44.480]  about the public military drills for gun confiscation everything else and of
[1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:47.820]  course they're gonna have some drills of saving hostages and some drills of
[1:01:47.820 --> 1:01:51.000]  taking over government buildings but it's all mixed together different
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:58.640]  training but in the end of the day it's all about the takeover and so the pastor
[1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:04.920]  calls in who's a veteran and says I'm confused you know it's prophecy why why
[1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:09.240]  are we talking about getting Ted Cruz elected Iran Paul or Rand Paul when it's
[1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:14.840]  all foregone conclusion I think it's the way prophecy has been presented by the
[1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:19.640]  Schofield Bible and everything the last 200 years or so that prophecies coming
[1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:22.480]  there's nothing you can do then it's the end of the world and Jesus comes back
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:29.080]  and that's just the way it is well no we change the future destiny with what we
[1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:35.520]  do and I'll use the analogy well some analogy the parable the history of Jonah
[1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:40.040]  going to Nineveh and they were penned they got a hundred year reprieve was
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:45.840]  destroyed a hundred years later and so regardless justice be done by the
[1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:50.840]  heavens fall I'm going to expose this be system
[1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:59.280]  whether we change it or not it's our job during this great time to warn people
[1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:05.580]  but we can't even get the big churches now to tell people don't take the
[1:03:05.580 --> 1:03:09.320]  microchip don't take the Google glasses don't take the I mean big mega
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:13.960]  churches here in town the kids go there and play Xbox connect at face scans you
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:17.920]  voice prints you look through walls records everything you're saying they
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:29.560]  just don't understand and they're accepting and so it's a process so we
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:33.160]  are obsolete when it comes to just exposing the world government because
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:37.480]  before they would play games and say it wasn't being built now they're rolling
[1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:43.000]  it out so they're going yeah we built it but so what kook well so what it's
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:49.720]  unelected so what it's tyrannical so what it's anti-human so what at the end of
[1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:59.320]  the day it's a world without people that's being built by these engineers so
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:02.620]  go ahead Barry you got one minute to respond back you say you're confused go
[1:04:02.620 --> 1:04:10.720]  ahead yeah I mean I think yeah I think you see what I'm saying I do think it's
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:14.560]  gonna play out as the Bible said I don't believe that that gives a person to be
[1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:19.120]  sort of apathetic about it but I think a lot of the points that you bring up are
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:23.320]  just you're kind of like John the Baptist the voice in the wilderness you
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:28.280]  know crying this stuff out you're actually exposing it which as a pastor I
[1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:32.960]  think the good thing when you say that we should vote with our dollar I agree
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:37.200]  with that but there's actually a 10-year plan to replace the dollar as the
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:42.000]  world I know and the US today announced they're gonna join with the new global
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:46.240]  China investment bank and so that's the beginning of the global currency right
[1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:52.760]  there absolutely I agree with you sir God bless you I just look I'm gonna tell
[1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:57.040]  people fluorides kill it I mean at least we could not brain damage all the kids
[1:04:57.040 --> 1:05:01.560]  all I could do is fight these people when cells become toxic they die early and

[1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:26.720]  and that's why it's important that Ted Cruz's announced he's running for
[1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:32.440]  president because on the policies he puts out I agree with about 95% of it
[1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:40.040]  abolish the IRS get rid of the fellow reserve in Obamacare we can do that
[1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:49.320]  these are unconstitutional illegal unpopular screw jobs our forebears

[1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:05.040]  on a cliff talking about voting with your dollars organic dairy farming
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:08.840]  struggles to keep up with demand and then the article out of Star Tribune
[1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:13.440]  breaks down the exponential increase in the desire for non GMO milk very
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:18.840]  exciting again that shows that we can culturally change things but this story
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:27.600]  is huge out of Philly comm FEMA to deny funds to warming deniers your state gets
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:31.280]  taxed you get taxed in the state the money gets sent to the feds they send it
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:36.200]  back with strings attached and now they're saying if your state doesn't go
[1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:40.040]  along with global warming garbage and global warming support for taxes and
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:43.520]  shutting off your power plants and brainwashing kids that polar bears can't
[1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:47.840]  swim and all these lies that the federal emergency management agency will deny
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:55.120]  you emergency aid and funds that is illegal that is criminal that is like
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:59.200]  seeing somebody it's like cops saying if you don't give me a raise I'm not gonna
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:04.200]  pull over when I see a car wreck I mean this is just amazing and it sets a
[1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:09.080]  precedent for all the rest of the power grabbing the federal emergency
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:12.760]  management agency is making it tougher for governors to deny man-made climate
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:16.680]  change starting next year the agency will approve disaster preparedness funds
[1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:21.480]  only for states whose governors approve of hazard mitigation plans address
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:26.280]  climate change which means smaller toilets smaller cars regulations taxes
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:33.960]  support taxes on carbon dioxide and water vapor I mean this is a huge deal so
[1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:37.280]  they're gonna keep your money and by the way FEMA taxes everybody with the
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:42.240]  insurance so you pay part of your money into paying it's siphoned off into FEMA
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:47.240]  the just a criminal organization all right I want to play Ted Cruz's new
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:51.960]  presidential run ad that just premiered today gave a 30-minute speech that we
[1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:58.640]  have linked on info wars.com announcing what he what he plans to do but right
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:01.360]  now let's go ahead and play this ad then we're gonna go to a few of your calls
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:06.160]  the Dr. Edward group who we have via the video a connection let's go ahead and
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:11.240]  go to this ad. My story is like that of so many other American families I'm the
[1:13:11.240 --> 1:13:15.240]  son of an immigrant father who fled oppression in Cuba and came to this
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:19.800]  country with just a hundred dollars to his name my mom was a pioneer in
[1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:23.920]  computer science smashing glass ceilings at a time when women were
[1:13:23.920 --> 1:13:29.320]  discouraged from following their dreams and now as a husband to Heidi and a
[1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:33.960]  father to our two little girls Caroline and Catherine I try to share the same
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:40.680]  messages of hope freedom and faith in God that I was raised that's why I've
[1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:46.240]  worked so hard to lead the fights to defend these cherished values like the
[1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:51.040]  historic battle to defund Obamacare standing up to the leadership from both
[1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:56.600]  parties to fight a debt ceiling increase and putting everything on the line to
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:14:02.000]  stop President Obama's illegal and unconstitutional amnesty we've sent a
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:06.880]  clear message that America will stand with our allies and against our enemies
[1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:11.360]  and taken on an IRS that was threatening and intimidating its
[1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:16.080]  citizens and the divide that exists in our country isn't between political
[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:23.480]  parties it's between Washington and the rest of us it's a time for truth a time
[1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:27.640]  to rise to the challenge just as Americans have always done and give
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:33.560]  bold voice and action to reclaiming the unlimited potential of each and every
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:39.960]  one of us your fight is my fight I believe in America and her people I
[1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:46.040]  believe in the conservative principles upon which this country was built and I
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:51.360]  believe we can stand up and restore our promise honor the Constitution and
[1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:56.760]  reestablish our leadership in the world it's going to take a new generation of
[1:14:56.760 --> 1:15:02.040]  courageous conservatives to help make America great again and I'm ready to
[1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:07.920]  stand with you to lead the fight I'm Ted Cruz if you want more of the same
[1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:14.520]  there'll be plenty to choose from but if you want real conservative change and a
[1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:18.560]  proven record I hope I can earn your support
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:27.720]  Ted Cruz for president Ted Cruz is strong Ted Cruz is strong folks and
[1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:32.320]  compare that to Obama I mean that's all I can say I mean if he watered that down
[1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:37.720]  by half when he got in it'd be better now one side of me says good get a
[1:15:37.720 --> 1:15:41.360]  Hillary in there we might actually save this country if it just got so much
[1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:45.960]  worse but look at the power grabbing under Obama Ted Cruz has a good voting
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:50.120]  record and said he says he'll try to repeal all this crap again I'm not
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:53.760]  gullible getting suckered one more time like the who song meet the new boss same
[1:15:53.760 --> 1:16:00.240]  as the old boss won't get fooled again but we have fallen so far it's just
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:03.960]  refreshing to hear that stuff Democrats without a press release saying it was
[1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:09.360]  like nails on a chalkboard they were you know just just absolutely sent a chill
[1:16:09.360 --> 1:16:13.920]  up their spine was one headline imagine images of George Washington freedom
[1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:19.080]  farms factories happy families diverse groups of people freedom not being a
[1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:26.560]  bunch of negative America hating free market hating garbage that's torture to
[1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:30.720]  them these are sick freaks that want to teach five-year-olds how to masturbate
[1:16:30.720 --> 1:16:36.720]  in public schools these are sick freaks that want to I'm just sick of them I
[1:16:36.720 --> 1:16:41.200]  mean they are a group of deranged crazy people with a bunch of globalists
[1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:46.360]  hell bent on this technocratic takeover plan and yes New World Order you've
[1:16:46.360 --> 1:16:50.000]  taken the planet over but you've really screwed it up in the process there are a
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:53.480]  lot of people in the power structure that now do not want to go with this big
[1:16:53.480 --> 1:16:57.720]  globalist hundred-year plan we could turn this around with God's help but the
[1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:02.240]  Christians all think that's the end of the world and so you're sitting it out
[1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:06.200]  even if it was the end of the world it's the big animating contest we're going
[1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:09.760]  to break we got Dr. Group on the line with huge suppressed information for the
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:13.200]  balance of the hour and five minutes in the next hour the global healing center
[1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:17.240]  but first let's jam in a few of these calls Peter in West Virginia your take
[1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:24.880]  on Ted Cruz Rand Paul go ahead can you hear me yes I can't well first of all I
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:32.520]  love you Alex you have awakened me I found you about a year ago I am in West
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:39.720]  Virginia recently moved here from DC actually lived in Southeast DC I could
[1:17:39.720 --> 1:17:44.120]  go on my rooftop deck and see the tip of the Washington monument and the Capitol
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:49.440]  dome and started watching your show on my laptop and I thought oh my god I'm
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:55.880]  living ground zero I'm in the district of criminals and a couple times a week I
[1:17:55.880 --> 1:18:01.440]  used to drive down GW Parkway and see the sign going to the CA headquarters at
[1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:10.920]  Langley what I call criminals in action and you know it's sad what's going on
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:16.120]  it's really sad what's going on in our country and I'm frustrated I feel your
[1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:22.920]  frustration I hear you brother and look I don't think Ted Cruz or Rand Paul's a
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:29.040]  panacea but just saying the things they're saying and the left is shocked
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:33.960]  by it shows you how crazy the establishment left is that they think
[1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:38.400]  that Ted Cruz had is sickening I mean what could you say was wrong with that
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:44.400]  ad well first of all I don't know if I could vote for Ted Cruz because I think
[1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:48.280]  he has what I call women's eyes he has girly eyes there's something wrong with
[1:18:48.280 --> 1:18:55.000]  this guy's eyes Rand Paul Rand Paul I like Rand Paul because he's the son of
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:01.640]  Ron Paul who I have followed warned about through you and so you know I don't
[1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:06.040]  know it's frustrating you know I disagree with you I don't think Ted Cruz has
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:12.440]  angel eyes he just has very confident relaxed eyes no I didn't say angel eyes
[1:19:12.440 --> 1:19:16.800]  I said girly eyes no I know but I call guys that have girl eyes angel eyes in
[1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:21.520]  fact I got a friend who has girl's eyes I call him angel eyes okay he doesn't like
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:27.880]  it yeah my point my point is that I go into the voting booth I don't know who
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:34.600]  to vote for I don't know you know they say they have faith in God does God have
[1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:38.720]  faith in them I mean come on I don't know I hear you brother I don't think
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:44.480]  Ted Cruz will save America but I think that getting behind those ideas needs to
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:48.400]  be done and we need to push him everywhere we are and I just like what
[1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:52.680]  comes out of his mouth we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen more calls but

[1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:06.880]  premier gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it you wouldn't buy
[1:23:06.880 --> 1:23:10.880]  gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that the Fed will
[1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:14.640]  stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security
[1:23:14.640 --> 1:23:18.480]  would be there for you. That's not what's happening you might even pass on
[1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:22.840]  gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't
[1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:27.360]  lose value or that your retirement would be secure. If all looks rosy to you then
[1:23:27.360 --> 1:23:30.920]  now is not the time to buy gold. For the realists there have never been more
[1:23:30.920 --> 1:23:35.920]  sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001 the US dollar index has

[1:24:12.200 --> 1:24:18.000]  Coming up in the third hour we'll continue with your phone calls. Stephen Crowder is
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:24.120]  just joining us for 15 minutes then. Louder with Crowder. He's been an actor, talk
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:26.880]  show host. He does some really interesting videos. He's the guy that
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:33.160]  got thrown on a planet fitness dressed like a woman pointing out that the so
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:36.960]  called tolerant planet fitness is like a mind control facility. It's like they're
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:40.560]  trying to turn Starbucks into and Hillary of course wants us to be forced
[1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:45.600]  into these reeducation camps as well. Fun camps she calls them. We'll just
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:51.000]  continue with calls and a ton of news after that. There's also some breaking
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:54.600]  news right now in infowars.com but I'm not going to go to that right now. I
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:25:00.000]  want to go to Dr. Edward Group and yes I do this every few weeks. I'm going to
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:05.200]  infomercial now but it's not really infomercial. 90% of it is information.
[1:25:05.200 --> 1:25:09.960]  Well it's all information but some of it is me pinching products. We sell fund
[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:17.240]  unlike NPR, unlike MSNBC, they get stimulus money. I try to come out with
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:25.400]  the highest quality products available from the most registered, successful,
[1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:29.400]  trusted laboratories in the country. We have three suppliers. One of them is
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:34.800]  Group and his facility and then two other of the leading names but we'll come up
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:41.880]  with our own formulas as well. Some of our stuff is just re-labeled and then we
[1:25:41.880 --> 1:25:46.240]  lower the price from what leading competitors sell from these well-known
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:52.520]  providers. But Dr. Group has developed Winner, Son, UltraVitamin D but even if
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:59.640]  you're not going to buy this from us, that isn't even really what matters. The
[1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:03.600]  point is Cass Sunstein came out six years ago, the White House regulations are
[1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:08.280]  and said we want laws banning saying that you need sunlight or vitamin D. Just
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:13.080]  bizarre. You'll die without vitamin D and it's one of those super nutrients that
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:17.720]  so many people out there are deficient in and most folks don't even get enough
[1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:25.040]  sun during the summer so hence Winner, Son. Son in the winter and before we get
[1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:28.000]  into vitamin D and how important it is and some other breaking health news
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:33.560]  today with Dr. Group, I just want to get the plugging done upfront and I
[1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:37.280]  really want to thank all of you for being supporters of InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:41.920]  Your purchase is the product, find the operation and our entire media system so
[1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:49.120]  thank you first but continuing this really is revolutionary concentrated
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:55.280]  organic vitamin D3. So we're also going to be warning you about vitamin D2 that is
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:26:59.120]  what most people are getting out there. If you understand I could get vitamin D2
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:05.600]  for a dollar for the product and maybe 30-40 cents for the bottle instead we're
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:11.960]  talking $10 or more into a bottle of this vitamin D3. This is truly
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:17.960]  nutraceutical you know pharmaceutical type grade. It's the real deal. That's
[1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:22.160]  why our vitamin B12 secret 12 is so powerful. That's why the X2 nation
[1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:25.440]  iodine is so powerful. You've heard the rave reviews from the oxy powder, the
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:29.400]  supermail vitality, superfemale. It's concentrated, it's organic, it's cold
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:34.080]  pressed. Now to tell us about before we get into vitamin D3 why it's so
[1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:39.200]  important, why is this so special from the organic lichens? It took you years to
[1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:42.840]  finally get an organic source to be able to produce enough of this so we have a
[1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:48.000]  limited run. That's one problem with the products is to get these these these
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.680]  materials sometimes is hard but we're trying. Winner's son Dr. Group tell us
[1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:58.440]  about it. Well that's it. Really the way that I look at things are I don't want
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:03.240]  people on tons of different vitamins and in my research more or less goes into
[1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:08.640]  what is deficient. What are the things that practically every single
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:12.480]  person on the planet is deficient in and that's what led me to iodine and that's
[1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:16.480]  what led me to this to the secret B because pretty much everybody is
[1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:19.880]  deficient in iodine and B and for the last year there's been a lot of
[1:28:19.880 --> 1:28:24.680]  information coming out on vitamin D so I wanted to do the research and this has
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:28.680]  been going on for about two or three years. Finally we were able to find a
[1:28:28.680 --> 1:28:33.640]  source, a lichen source of D3 and actually produce it and that's the launch
[1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:37.480]  today of the Winner's Son but what I wanted to do was actually go into a
[1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:40.760]  little bit of a background and let people know some of this information that
[1:28:40.760 --> 1:28:46.360]  I discovered because first you find a deficiency and then what I do is why is
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:50.320]  there a deficiency? Why are so many people deficient in this vitamin and then
[1:28:50.320 --> 1:28:55.520]  the third thing is how can we correct this deficiency? Now I remember reading aren't
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:28:58.960]  lichen some of the oldest creatures on the planet it's like a plant-like
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:03.960]  creature that grows on rocks. Well lichens grow on trees like they go on
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:09.120]  rocks I mean vitamin D actually is the oldest hormone it's really not even a
[1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:13.480]  vitamin it's a hormone and it was originally found to be produced by
[1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:20.320]  phytoplankton and then that even back in 1849 you they were using cod liver oil
[1:29:20.320 --> 1:29:26.000]  to treat tuberculosis and that was really attributed to D and then the
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:31.120]  research continued around 1915 they were doing studies on Navy officers and
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:35.920]  they found that the Navy officers that were working indoors were eight times
[1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:40.600]  more likely to develop forms of cancer. Let's talk about this straight ahead I
[1:29:40.600 --> 1:29:44.080]  want you to give us the whole history recap it why are people so deficient and
[1:29:44.080 --> 1:29:49.040]  why does the government well Obama not want us to get it seriously. We're on
[1:29:49.040 --> 1:29:57.120]  the March the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:18.200]  you are listening to an infowars.com front line report it's Alex Jones
[1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:28.160]  I'm about trying to get stuff done and the truth is Ted Cruz and Rand Paul were
[1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:33.520]  the figureheads of the Second Amendment movement that barely defeated the gun
[1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:40.120]  ban of two years ago barely and it's been Ted Cruz and Rand Paul that have been
[1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:44.200]  helping shoot down different legislation to try to restrict supplements in this
[1:33:44.200 --> 1:33:48.560]  country and they've been trying to stop the borders being wide open they've been
[1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:55.640]  trying to stop the aiding and abetting of al Qaeda so when people and I've heard
[1:33:55.640 --> 1:33:58.600]  the listeners they don't have a lot of faith in Ted Cruz or Rand Paul especially
[1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:05.480]  Ted Cruz sit back and don't at least get excited about people talking about
[1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:12.640]  freedom there's something wrong and I'm not criticizing anybody I get it but the
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:16.480]  longer I do this the more I realize how much power we've really got when we start
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:20.560]  taking action take Dr. Group when do I promote something when it's a win win
[1:34:20.560 --> 1:34:26.080]  I won't promote something if I don't truly research it and then use it and
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:31.440]  then believe in it high quality water filters so you don't drink glyphosates
[1:34:31.440 --> 1:34:35.920]  and fluoride hundreds of other chemicals that are in the water supplies sell it at
[1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:43.360]  a low price high quality I sleep good at night or vitamin D3 the government the
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:47.000]  UN and others are obsessed with saying don't get sunlight and and don't take
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:52.840]  vitamin D and suppressing studies about it why well same reason they put fluoride
[1:34:52.840 --> 1:34:57.080]  in the water because you'll be more awake more conscious more happy if you
[1:34:57.080 --> 1:35:01.920]  have vitamin D3 am I shelling vitamin D3 absolutely do I take vitamin D3
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:09.600]  absolutely see it's a win win win win win and I'm not gonna keep belaboring
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:13.720]  buying winter Sun from inforwarslife.com you know we're getting into the spring in
[1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:17.360]  some areas now but in my experience most people don't get enough sun in the
[1:35:17.360 --> 1:35:23.200]  spring and summer and then in the fall and winter it is essential so winter Sun
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:27.040]  it's definitely got the best packaging anything we put out so far and it's
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:31.960]  amazing it goes very well with the vitamin B12 secret 12 inforwarslife.com
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:42.400]  inforwarsstore.com or 888-253-3139 I'm not gonna belabor that anymore Dr. Group
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:46.680]  Recap start back over with the history because you got cut off by the break go
[1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:53.200]  through what's happening with vitamin D3 differs between vitamin D2 and and why
[1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:57.480]  you think they're suppressing this and why Cass Sunstein is so obsessed with
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:00.760]  trying to keep us from the public there has definitely been a suppression
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:06.680]  there's no doubt about it well the government really recognized be the
[1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:12.000]  importance of sunlight actually in 1931 and they recommended sunlight for
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.800]  health and even in 1934 Schlitz beer actually fortified their beer with
[1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:24.000]  vitamin D and then the FDA banned them from doing that in 1937 around 1940 is
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:28.440]  when there was so much research coming out that vitamin D and sunlight was
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:33.960]  sunlight was actually good for you and that lasted until 1950 and right around
[1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:38.560]  1950 that's when the dermatologist and the doctors for that matter started
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:44.120]  coming out and saying that they did not recommend Sun and that sunlight was
[1:36:44.120 --> 1:36:48.880]  actually damaging and it's interesting that right around that time was when
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:55.040]  copper tone came out with the first synthetic sunscreen which was heavily
[1:36:55.040 --> 1:36:59.640]  marketed and that was in the 1950s so there was a big campaign and then and
[1:36:59.640 --> 1:37:05.920]  throughout the 1950s against the Sun and against you getting the natural D
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:11.040]  because they realized from the 1930s to the 1950s how important vitamin D
[1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:15.200]  production was and they also knew that you couldn't really get enough vitamin D
[1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:18.920]  through the foods that you were eating and that you really needed to be out in
[1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:23.160]  the Sun because what happens is when you're out in the Sun the Sun hits your
[1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:27.560]  skin and you have a like a cholesterol type molecule in your skin and that
[1:37:27.560 --> 1:37:32.160]  produces vitamin D and then that actually has to go and be processed into the
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:37.720]  liver to create what's called 25 hydroxy which is D3 and then it goes and gets
[1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:42.000]  processed in the kidneys which is the activated the kidneys activate the D3
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:46.760]  and then it goes back into the intestines which then it goes back into
[1:37:46.760 --> 1:37:54.360]  your bloodstream but moving forward with what's happened in society when you
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:38:00.960]  actually are in the Sun it takes you actually your D3 that you produce in the
[1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:05.720]  Sun is last two to three times longer than it's good than if it's consumed in
[1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:11.680]  your body and as a matter of fact now they know that 2,000 genes in your system
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:17.280]  have been identified that are regulated by vitamin D and again you know I'm not
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:21.120]  the one to prescribe a lot and I thought that everybody was iodine deficient but
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:25.800]  I know now for a fact that I'm still continuing there's 50,000 abstracts on
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:31.760]  vitamin D continuing to do research on this subject and not only are you
[1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:36.400]  going to be vitamin D deficient in the summers and the winters anymore but I'm
[1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:40.400]  telling you that the whole world is pretty much vitamin D deficient and
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:44.400]  this global warming thing if global warming was really happening then there
[1:38:44.400 --> 1:38:48.200]  would be more sunlight and then there would be probably less cases of vitamin
[1:38:48.200 --> 1:38:54.360]  D deficiency but here's what happened in the introduction of fossil fuels and
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:39:02.720]  chemicals and from the 1950s 1960s see we activate vitamin D with the UVB rays
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:11.000]  and the UVB rays are really only going to be out from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. those are
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:14.840]  the only times during the day now I used to say well you need to get your
[1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:19.800]  sunlight early in the morning and late in the afternoon but what I've what I'm
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:23.520]  finding out is early in the morning and late in the afternoon and when the
[1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:29.480]  sunlight rays are bent at such a strong angle that's usually the UVA rays and
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:35.360]  not the UVB rays so now we know that the best time to get vitamin D production
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:40.120]  is going to be between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. but what's happened is and this is why
[1:39:40.120 --> 1:39:45.880]  it's not just in the winter is the introduction of air pollution with the
[1:39:45.880 --> 1:39:49.880]  fossil fuels the chemicals everything that's being released into the air and
[1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:56.320]  the smog that it's creating which are actually blocking or reflecting the UVB
[1:39:56.320 --> 1:40:03.680]  rays and that also ties in to the geoengineering and also ties into the
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:09.120]  excessive amount of chemtrail use so what's happening is they're blocking
[1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:13.960]  yes there's an attack on vitamin D because you're not going to get enough in
[1:40:13.960 --> 1:40:18.880]  the foods that you eat everybody needs to be on it but they're also creating and
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:28.120]  blocking the UVB rays to create vitamin D deficiency and let me go further you
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:33.520]  can actually search NASA earth is now darker from condensation trails whether
[1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:36.940]  you call them chemtrails or condensation trails they admit the earth was
[1:40:36.940 --> 1:40:41.600]  20 something a decade ago now they say the earth is 30% darker there's the
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:48.280]  guardian or the 20% darker say experts and again that's a client science
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:56.760]  Jim Henson at Goddard Institute at NASA but that was back in 2003 the latest
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:02.680]  numbers and the guys can pull those up and going from memory is 31% darker it's
[1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:07.560]  accelerating so we're talking about terra farming bizarre sounding stuff here
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:14.440]  this is really going on why would the White House science are come out and
[1:41:14.440 --> 1:41:19.760]  push for restricting and then why would the White House regulations are come out
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:26.280]  and say ban people saying sunlight's good for you I mean is that just setting
[1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:30.920]  the bar so high that they're the boss and that they can control reality like
[1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:35.760]  Carl Rove said I mean why are they so obsessed with blocking sunlight or
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:40.760]  vitamin D3 well again it's a hormone I'm going to explain a lot of the things
[1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:44.680]  that happen in the body here in a second first of all every single tissue and
[1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:50.160]  cell in your body has a vitamin D receptor just like iodine and they know
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:54.320]  now there was actually a study done in Boston that showed you can make zero
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:42:00.200]  vitamin D from November to February and now if you draw a line from Atlanta
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:06.120]  Georgia right across the southern United States anything above that line you're
[1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:11.800]  not going to be able to make any vitamin D also there's increased spraying usually
[1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:16.120]  in the southern states and there was even a study done on lifeguards in
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:21.040]  Florida that were in the sun all day every day and their vitamin D levels
[1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:27.960]  were right at about a hundred nanograms per milliliter the normal D levels in
[1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:32.360]  your blood I think should be around 50 nanograms per milliliter the normal
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:37.960]  medical range is anywhere from 30 to 100 nanograms per milliliter so what you're
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:43.000]  seeing is even in and in recently they've tested people that were out in the
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.840]  sun in Nepal and India that are in the sun all day long and they're still
[1:42:46.840 --> 1:42:52.960]  showing deficient vitamin D levels what happened to is the push for
[1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:58.200]  everybody to wear sunscreen not only are the sunscreens toxic and have cancer
[1:42:58.200 --> 1:43:03.400]  causing compounds in them but if you apply sunscreen for two or three I mean
[1:43:03.400 --> 1:43:07.120]  you could apply it one day and it's still going to be on your skin even if you
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:12.640]  take a shower and it reduces your vitamin D production for two to three days by
[1:43:12.640 --> 1:43:18.760]  up to 98% so it's unbelievable I mean this is the vitamin D3 conspiracy then
[1:43:18.760 --> 1:43:23.400]  we've got the problem of most vitamin D that's out there that's supplemented in
[1:43:23.400 --> 1:43:29.000]  foods and things is vitamin D2 explain to people the differences well vitamin
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:34.600]  D2 most of it is synthetic actually and it's ergo calciferol and that's what
[1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:39.040]  you're going to find in the majority of supplements D2 is found naturally in
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:44.840]  mushrooms and D3 which is the vegan form you're going to find in lichen which is
[1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:50.880]  what we use to do the extraction so we can create a the winter sun which is
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:55.880]  which is just the best way in the world to get your vitamin D levels because it's
[1:43:55.880 --> 1:44:01.040]  in a D3 form it's easily absorbable it's easily broken down and by the liver and
[1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:04.960]  the kidneys it's an event it's the vegetable glycerin base and it comes
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:09.000]  from lichen so it's a it's a vegan source so you don't have to worry about
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:13.760]  cod liver oil the fish oils which are contaminated with mercury plus it's a
[1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:18.400]  stress on the environment and everything else let's get into because I have a
[1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:22.280]  ricola article here vitamin D deficiency linked to depression pain inflammatory
[1:44:22.280 --> 1:44:28.800]  bowel disease and breast cancer well right now you even have 50 million
[1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:32.240]  teens that are deficient in vitamin D and here's some of the things that
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:37.200]  vitamin D is linked to increases the risk of chronic disease and cancer it
[1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:42.000]  weakens the body's immune system as associated with infertility you know we
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:45.600]  talk a lot about the sterility and infertility things out there and vitamin
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:52.960]  D is one of the things that causes poor birth outcomes low birth weight and one
[1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:56.680]  of the strange things about that is actually pull the study up on C
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:45:04.800]  sections and women that were deficient in vitamin D there was a 400% increase in
[1:45:04.800 --> 1:45:11.160]  C sections instead of natural births but it also increases the risk of death from
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:15.120]  issues like cancer like you said it gives you the feeling of loss of energy
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:22.000]  in the afternoon really vitamin D affects the muscles the joints and the bones
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:28.160]  osteoarthritis is linked to D deficiency rheumatoid arthritis there was a guy
[1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:34.080]  actually that took mega doses of he had all kinds of injuries torn ligaments
[1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:39.560]  bone spurs all over his bodies he was a more martial arts a martial arts and
[1:45:39.560 --> 1:45:46.600]  athletic superstar and he actually wrote a book a mega dosing vitamin D I
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:52.600]  can't remember his name was Jeff bowls or something like that and he took 50 20
[1:45:52.600 --> 1:45:59.040]  thousand to 50 thousand I use a vitamin D a day and what happened was his
[1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:04.120]  experience is the body actually recognized everywhere that it had been
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:08.400]  injured he had spinal injuries joint injuries everywhere and about the third
[1:46:08.400 --> 1:46:13.800]  week he was on high levels of vitamin D the body actually re-injured or breaks
[1:46:13.800 --> 1:46:17.880]  down those injuries because the injuries if they're not if you don't have
[1:46:17.880 --> 1:46:23.320]  enough vitamin D and nutrients and calcium heal the wrong way so he
[1:46:23.320 --> 1:46:28.040]  actually experienced the pain all over again for like two or three days of
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:32.960]  every place he had injured himself and then what happened over a period of like
[1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:39.000]  three months all of those injuries completely went away and it and fix
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:44.880]  themselves and that was only with vitamin D yes it's Jeff T bowls basically
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:49.840]  you're saying it's the ultimate building block in the body and that's what
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:52.360]  medical doctors have told me they've told me if you don't have enough vitamin D
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:56.120]  three it doesn't matter how much exercise or eating the right stuff because
[1:46:56.120 --> 1:47:01.880]  your body can't even absorb it your cells can't get it in right in a lot of the
[1:47:01.880 --> 1:47:05.960]  cases out there with fiber myalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome it's usually
[1:47:05.960 --> 1:47:10.040]  nothing more than a vitamin D deficiency I mean you can link vitamin D to
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:15.080]  depression mental illness diabetes there's so many different let me ask
[1:47:15.080 --> 1:47:18.160]  you this you're saying all this and anybody watching us on TV right now
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:22.040]  can see that we're putting mainstream news articles up constantly radio
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:25.120]  listeners going to info wars dot com four slash show if you want to see the feed
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:28.720]  you know that added level of documentation this is well known you
[1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:33.160]  mentioned slits from the 30s we pulled it up found found mainstream news about
[1:47:33.160 --> 1:47:37.000]  schlitz with vitamin D and how the FDA made them take it out why would the FDA
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:43.160]  want beer makers to not add the key vitamins I just don't get it there's
[1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:47.840]  only one reason really it's because if you're vitamin D deficient you're
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:51.840]  taught if let's say you have enough vitamin D then you're talking about a
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:57.160]  massive blow to the pharmaceutical companies because heart disease stroke
[1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:02.160]  cancer well I've got to give it to schlitz I mean you know they called it
[1:48:02.160 --> 1:48:07.000]  sunshine beer yeah vitamin D3 and that's smart that's right that's right and
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:11.800]  they actually they're advertising campaigns were get your get your vitamin
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:15.400]  D all year round from you don't just need it in the winter and there was
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:20.160]  other that's just one example there were multiple examples of people that were
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:27.000]  fortifying things in foods and drinks that were then ordered to stop and it
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:31.200]  had to do with the fact that it was a threat to the pharmaceutical companies
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:36.280]  and the fact that they knew that the body's immune system and the body's
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:41.600]  self-healing mechanism would be activated with vitamin D just like
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:45.920]  iodine and they knew that if they created a society that was vitamin D
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:50.120]  deficient there would be a whole list of diseases because every cell in the body
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:56.280]  depends on it what I'm finding out now is that whatever the receptors for every
[1:48:56.280 --> 1:49:01.560]  single cell in the body are that every single cell has like iodine receptors and
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:06.920]  D receptors those are the things that the globalists are attacking and
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:12.040]  preventing you from receiving because if your cells become damaged your body
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:16.920]  becomes damaged and then you you become easily controllable and a hundred
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:22.720]  percent that's why they had the fluoride all of it it's just amazing and yeah one
[1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:26.260]  one big huge thing that I found out how many people do you know that have
[1:49:26.260 --> 1:49:31.200]  skin problems psoriasis everything well there was a doctor from Boston
[1:49:31.200 --> 1:49:35.880]  University he's he was he's been stuck one of the biggest doctors that studied
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:41.600]  of vitamin D he's written a couple books on as Dr. Hollick and he was talking
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:46.920]  to all the dermatologists and they were saying well we they sent him all of their
[1:49:46.920 --> 1:49:51.000]  hardest cases where they tried corticosteroids they tried all the
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:56.240]  different topicals nothing worked he said I want to just try to apply topicals
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:02.840]  D3 and see what happens the hardest cases that were take we're trying every
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:07.560]  single thing was tried for three years he did a placebo cream and then he did a
[1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:13.000]  D3 clinic cream and 92% of the people with psoriasis or skin conditions
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  cleared up unbelievable the application of D3 on their skin when her son and you

[1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:23.800]  that was really what we were trying to get at right now I'm taking 20,000 I use
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:28.120]  a day because I have I'm actually going through and testing it on myself because
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:32.640]  I have injuries from athletics and everything so I'm seeing how it works
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:39.600]  another thing is with children children really need to be on vitamin D their
[1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:43.400]  bones are growing their joints are growing and I think that the minimum
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:48.000]  children should be on our about is about a thousand I use a day so not only is it
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:51.360]  necessary for adults but especially necessary that's what I do I give my
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:55.280]  children a half a drop or full not a full yeah that's a thousand I use and
[1:56:55.280 --> 1:56:59.080]  there's a marker on there as well well really what I did was I just looked at
[1:56:59.080 --> 1:57:02.080]  all the different sources out there and the majority of sources like you said
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:06.200]  earlier is synthetic I mean most of the things that you get in the stores are
[1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:10.400]  going to be cod liver oil based or they're going to be synthetic forms and
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:15.360]  what I wanted to do is was go to the plants look at natural sources and we
[1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:22.000]  found a source that was from lichen and was able to it's another company that
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:26.720]  actually specialized and spent 20 years you know exposing lichen to UV and and
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:30.880]  gathering them and they concentrated and they give it to us and then we wanted
[1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:36.200]  to make it in a good tasting formula that's so cool though this this ancient
[1:57:36.200 --> 1:57:44.920]  plant grabs the sun and then translates it into a vitamin it's magic it is right
[1:57:44.920 --> 1:57:49.160]  I mean you can see like in a just growing on trees that almost looks mossy like
[1:57:49.160 --> 1:57:55.080]  you know almost like a sea urchin kind of that grows on trees and and plants and
[1:57:55.080 --> 1:58:01.360]  rocks and stuff like that and so what we did is it took us a while to get to be
[1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:07.160]  able to stabilize it and would use it our cold processing techniques into a
[1:58:07.160 --> 1:58:13.080]  formula that we could test and it would significantly test out at 2000 I use and
[1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:16.320]  we do it in a vegetable glycerin base which is easy for people to take but
[1:58:16.320 --> 1:58:20.400]  being a former special ops guy about them on those missions where you were
[1:58:20.400 --> 1:58:24.480]  trained to live off the land if you had to I guess you get a book on this you
[1:58:24.480 --> 1:58:29.520]  could actually harvest wild lichen and eat it then I guess I you know I don't
[1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:32.440]  know if you could do that there's probably some other poisonous compounds
[1:58:32.440 --> 1:58:36.760]  in lichen definitely you can use mushrooms
[1:58:36.760 --> 1:58:40.040]  we're back in one minute tell us about natural sources of it folks have to buy
[1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:48.480]  it from us just you need to get it we'll be right back stay with us

[2:00:27.160 --> 2:00:30.760]  videos exposing the cult's political correctness Stephen Crowder joins us
[2:00:30.760 --> 2:00:35.160]  about 15 after next hour but I'm gonna go to break and then come back and go to
[2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:42.240]  Joey and Tom and Sparrow and John and Dino we're gonna get to all of you before
[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:50.480]  the guest joins us but going back to Dr. Edward group the reason I asked you
[2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:53.920]  that question is I know you know we talked about special forces training and
[2:00:53.920 --> 2:00:57.480]  the classic stuff where they dump you off in the woods or the desert different
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:01.880]  missions you're on and training to live off the land and I just see lichens all
[2:01:01.880 --> 2:01:04.840]  over the place and I know growing up my dad always would say those have the
[2:01:04.840 --> 2:01:09.640]  highest level of vitamin D3 in them and he said he had a book when he was
[2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:14.240]  younger that told about lichens he had another book about mushrooms but you know
[2:01:14.240 --> 2:01:17.680]  he still his dad when him and his brother would bring him back would say I
[2:01:17.680 --> 2:01:21.960]  don't know that might be poisonous but they would have debates about it so
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:26.120]  living off the land is dangerous but it's something people should learn so I
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:30.680]  kind of segue it off into that you were getting into natural forms of vitamin
[2:01:30.680 --> 2:01:36.200]  D3 that aren't very expensive what are some of the best things well I mean
[2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:41.760]  ultimately you're really not going to get no matter what dietary or what food
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:45.680]  that you that you can eat you're not going to get sufficient of vitamin D
[2:01:45.680 --> 2:01:54.120]  levels you find D in in foods cooked egg yolks real fatty fish like salmon but
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:58.840]  they actually did studies on farm rate since most people eat farm raised salmon
[2:01:58.840 --> 2:02:03.320]  and they compared it to naturally wild caught salmon the farm raised salmon had
[2:02:03.320 --> 2:02:08.440]  zero vitamin D in it as opposed to the naturally caught salmon which had roughly
[2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:16.640]  around 400 I use of vitamin D per four ounces so even if you look at the highest
[2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:23.120]  sources mushrooms contain vitamin D really the fatty fish you get you're not
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:27.080]  going to find anything really but I love mushrooms but I guess I cook them
[2:02:27.080 --> 2:02:31.840]  though yeah you cook them in reality like I said you're not going you need a
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:38.080]  minimum of two thousand I use daily in order to get the vitamin D that your
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:43.480]  body needs to be healthy so you're you're just not going to do that and the
[2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:48.520]  best way to get vitamin D is to be in the sunlight and that's that's what I
[2:02:48.520 --> 2:02:54.680]  tell everybody to do unfortunately you have so many winter months even you know
[2:02:54.680 --> 2:03:00.040]  like most people like you said are working inside during the week how much
[2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:02.680]  optimally how much sunlight do you really need because I've seen different
[2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:07.160]  studies they argue that people that get no sun I've seen studies get more skin
[2:03:07.160 --> 2:03:11.280]  cancer and other cancers than the other people but then obviously it does age
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:15.400]  your skin but then you always say that if I got the proper nutrients I would tan
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:19.440]  better and not burn you're you're absolutely correct now people see me and
[2:03:19.440 --> 2:03:23.760]  they go are you Hispanic or something during the summer I mean your skin is
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:29.120]  like dark brown and I love it looks good I'm like no I get my nutrients before I
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:32.840]  would just burn now that I'm getting all these nutrients I'm actually tanning
[2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:38.320]  right well I think about 20 minutes you definitely don't want to be out to where
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:43.040]  your skin starts burning but 20 minutes of sunlight between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.
[2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:51.760]  20 minutes of good sunlight can produce 20,000 I use a vitamin so it's not good
[2:03:51.760 --> 2:03:55.080]  that I literally get high off the Sun I'd like to lay in the sun for three hours
[2:03:55.080 --> 2:04:01.040]  well I mean if you're gonna be on the Sun for three hours you probably you
[2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:06.200]  might be in that especially between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in Austin where you know
[2:04:06.200 --> 2:04:09.800]  it's a hundred degrees in the summertime you might be getting a little bit too
[2:04:09.800 --> 2:04:12.960]  much I love the roast is there's something wrong with me like that
[2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:18.560]  Sunseeds does well I don't know I've never done a blood evaluation on you have
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:23.360]  you had your vitamin D levels checked I had a whole physical done about six
[2:04:23.360 --> 2:04:27.600]  months ago they said it was all good my blood pressure was low low for my age
[2:04:27.600 --> 2:04:32.000]  wasn't real low it was just a little low the thing is you're exactly right we've
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:35.920]  become sedentary lifestyle everybody's working indoors under fluorescent
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:40.520]  lighting and there nobody's going out and getting enough Sun I mean everybody
[2:04:40.520 --> 2:04:44.560]  works during those hours between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. who do you know that has time
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:48.000]  off that can just go sunbathe every day for 20 minutes no I wasn't getting
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:52.080]  enough nutrients I would get sunspots when I got too much Sun now the sunspots
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:55.320]  have almost completely on away it's just amazing when her son in fours life

[2:09:06.800 --> 2:09:10.240]  through the process of becoming press secretary one of the things one of the
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:14.160]  first things they told me was you're not even to acknowledge the drone program
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:19.480]  you're not even to discuss that it exists it's run by chaos it's run by
[2:09:19.480 --> 2:09:24.560]  specter special executive for counterintelligence terrorism revenge
[2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:29.480]  extortion they run little kids they run the snuff films they run the drugs they

[2:13:16.440 --> 2:13:22.560]  Ted Cruz thing I feel like both of them are good options and there's no need
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:26.160]  read for everyone to think that everything's over even if you are into
[2:13:26.160 --> 2:13:32.160]  Christianity I I feel like even if we don't get a chance to get are you guys
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:35.640]  don't get a chance to get to that vote and if you do it's a vote for your soul
[2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:41.200]  brief basically exactly you've got to do the right thing or at least try and then
[2:13:41.200 --> 2:13:44.240]  whatever happens happens let the chips fall where they may but think about it
[2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:48.600]  all this market the beast stuff's happening the globalist are anti-human
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:52.760]  they believe they're God they believe they're gonna transcend humanity it's
[2:13:52.760 --> 2:13:58.120]  everything the Bible warned of happening what are the atheists and people say
[2:13:58.120 --> 2:14:02.920]  about all this I just don't know how they square that we still have the choice
[2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:07.680]  though we still have the choice this is why people are being awakened this is
[2:14:07.680 --> 2:14:13.000]  why all of this is happening everything is like the blood moons the fact that
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:18.760]  Obama just turned on Israel in the Bible about how the whoever tries to divide
[2:14:18.760 --> 2:14:24.880]  Israel will be God's wrath all of this stuff I got a couple points about how
[2:14:24.880 --> 2:14:28.600]  to reach the Florida mind I've been listening to you for about a month now
[2:14:28.600 --> 2:14:34.280]  and basically the first thing you got to do is you got to play into people's
[2:14:34.280 --> 2:14:40.920]  envy their their greed their sin you got to let them can let them teach you
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:44.960]  about something an angle that you want to like say for example I use a real
[2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:51.360]  estate I asked them both the values of real estate but how is I how basically
[2:14:51.360 --> 2:14:55.760]  how how come I can't get it out right now and I'll tell you this one this is
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:14:59.720]  the best one I got I'm sure you're already aware if you type luminati.com in
[2:14:59.720 --> 2:15:04.280]  the address bar it brings you to the NSA.gov but what people don't know is
[2:15:04.280 --> 2:15:08.880]  if you try and put in an instant message or on Facebook immediately it it says
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:14.360]  this is a national security and if you did this by accident let us know right
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:18.080]  there that gets their attention very good wow we'll have to try that if that's
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:21.920]  true that's gonna be pretty wild guys type it in and see where it goes right

[2:15:45.360 --> 2:15:49.000]  presidential candidates you want to know who's gonna be the president you know
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:52.400]  look at the bloodlines trace the bloodlines back they all go back to
[2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:55.960]  royalty they're all related the Bushes the Clinton you can deal with that is
[2:15:55.960 --> 2:16:00.600]  actually true and so who's got the royal bloodline that I mean both the
[2:16:00.600 --> 2:16:06.880]  Clintons and the Bushes so have you traced Ted Cruz's bloodline no I heard
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:11.680]  someone recently talking about possibility possibility of a Rand Paul's
[2:16:11.680 --> 2:16:15.960]  mother there might be something on her side of the family going on there if we
[2:16:15.960 --> 2:16:22.720]  need to look into it so you know Ted Cruz and Rand Paul I go up together head
[2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:26.040]  to head face off against each other that's just gonna split the votes you
[2:16:26.040 --> 2:16:31.800]  know and divide the the party anyways but I want to quickly touch on this Jade
[2:16:31.800 --> 2:16:37.120]  Helm this big developments going on there I came to this came to light to me on
[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:44.360]  a YouTube video on the W77 page there's FEMA is putting up domes all over Texas
[2:16:44.360 --> 2:16:47.560]  FEMA they're calling them people are calling them death domes they're freaking
[2:16:47.560 --> 2:16:51.400]  out now we've we've actually sent reporters out and shown the new
[2:16:51.400 --> 2:16:55.200]  emergency domes that they say aren't even for the illegal immigrants they're
[2:16:55.200 --> 2:16:59.920]  saying that it's so for during any type of disaster that guy search a FEMA domes
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:05.400]  Texas and we can show people some of the video and articles about that
[2:17:05.920 --> 2:17:12.440]  go ahead all right well that's just some big stuff we need to be looking into
[2:17:12.440 --> 2:17:17.400]  this Jade Helm 15 big time the timing of it they've been prepping and then we
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:21.800]  need to do some research on these bloodlines see what's going on behind
[2:17:21.800 --> 2:17:27.400]  the scenes with these people absolutely well we know the military is training to
[2:17:27.400 --> 2:17:31.320]  take on the American people we know because the military has warned us they
[2:17:31.320 --> 2:17:37.640]  don't like it but there's the article FEMA building pricey domes for your
[2:17:37.640 --> 2:17:43.240]  safety close quote welcome to FEMA dome and so absolutely a Don Salazar wrote
[2:17:43.240 --> 2:17:47.920]  about that back in August of last year and again the Army's come out and
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:52.400]  stars and stripes and said yeah we call Texas hostile but you know they're being
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:56.760]  alarmist it's no big deal the commenters and Paul Watson's article keep saying
[2:17:56.760 --> 2:18:01.400]  yeah and Paul Revere was an alarmist thank you Sparrow let's talk to Dino in
[2:18:01.400 --> 2:18:08.400]  Michigan Dino go ahead how you doing Alex good brother great also about this
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:14.640]  Jane Helm exercise yes sir I'm reading a report that Florida and Mississippi has
[2:18:14.640 --> 2:18:20.480]  just been added on to it too their states will include surgical stripes and
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:26.560]  extractions according to a news conference not sure if you heard that
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:30.320]  yet or not no but we've got Joe Biggs and others tracking it all and staying on
[2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:34.840]  top of it it's a big story because yeah they do military exercises to condition
[2:18:34.840 --> 2:18:38.720]  the public and to condition the military to accept trips on the streets in
[2:18:38.720 --> 2:18:43.280]  America that's all admitted now and I've been talking about this for 20 years
[2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:50.200]  watching it build and they always deny deny deny no this is going on also with
[2:18:50.200 --> 2:18:55.680]  crews all these things what the people are saying they don't want Obama care
[2:18:55.680 --> 2:19:01.320]  they don't want any of this crap that the end of yours putting out to us and I
[2:19:01.320 --> 2:19:07.080]  think that's why people like what he's saying I'm not so sure with Ron Rand
[2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:14.240]  Paul he seems kind of iffy you know I mean like he'll give in a little bit more
[2:19:14.240 --> 2:19:23.560]  than what crews would well absolutely and and and we should keep Ted Cruz on a
[2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:28.320]  very short leash and any of these politicians but he's saying what needs
[2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:33.920]  to be said so we've got a back that and then if you ever got in back actually
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:37.120]  trying to implement that and if he doesn't start impeachment hearings I
[2:19:37.120 --> 2:19:42.040]  mean I think these people should all pledge to resign if they don't carry
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:46.360]  out an attempt to pass everything they said they would I mean Obama though did
[2:19:46.360 --> 2:19:53.680]  a 180 from his claims but we haven't seen that from Rand Paul and Ted Cruz
[2:19:53.680 --> 2:19:57.400]  we've got a special guest joining us the more calls stay with us Stephen

[2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:29.960]  goes out and just shows the totalitarian absurdness of the people that call
[2:24:29.960 --> 2:24:34.560]  themselves leftist I don't even call them liberals Thomas Jefferson was a
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:40.880]  liberal more freedom more private property keep more of your money self
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:44.920]  defense these people are the opposite they want to live in like some type of

[2:24:48.640 --> 2:24:55.040]  in stores their race with us reeducation camp garbage Hillary came out last week
[2:24:55.040 --> 2:24:59.040]  of course and said we need to go to fun camps to be forced to discuss this
[2:24:59.040 --> 2:25:03.720]  black lives matter bust into restaurants everywhere and getting people's faces
[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:08.760]  it's clearly to stir up division in the nation because that's all Obama and the
[2:25:08.760 --> 2:25:13.400]  globalist have to offer black unemployment doubled under Obama's let's
[2:25:13.400 --> 2:25:17.800]  get everybody fighting with each other while the establishment loots us again
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:21.640]  now Steven Crowder joins us louder with Crowder.com excellent YouTube site
[2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:26.840]  excellent radio show I wanted to get him on to discuss some of his latest antics
[2:25:26.840 --> 2:25:31.680]  to show the absurdity of what's happening with planet fitness and I wasn't
[2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:36.200]  aware of planet fitness I'll be honest and how bizarre they were I didn't know
[2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:42.720]  that if anything's a reeducation camp in the making it's planet fitness so I
[2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:46.520]  want to get his expert take on this because it turns out I spent like an
[2:25:46.520 --> 2:25:49.680]  hour or two last week on his YouTube site watching all these different videos
[2:25:49.680 --> 2:25:54.680]  with his run-ins with them and others so Steven thanks for joining us thank you
[2:25:54.680 --> 2:25:57.800]  so much for having me Alex and listen I know that we don't agree on everything
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:02.000]  but I appreciate you extending a friendly invitation and I'm glad to you
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:06.040]  know to lock arms and the things in which we do agree absolutely now let's get
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:11.800]  into it here your take I mean I call it an attempt to turn the country into
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:17.160]  a reeducation camp what do you call trying to turn retail stores gyms you
[2:26:17.160 --> 2:26:24.720]  name it in the ninny and control freak in pecking dens well I don't know if I'd
[2:26:24.720 --> 2:26:28.560]  go to use that many objectives but listen planet fitness it's funny one of my
[2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:32.200]  first videos ever ever was about planet fitness and had nothing to do with the
[2:26:32.200 --> 2:26:37.000]  transgender sort of reeducation that's going on right now it was about the fact
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:40.840]  that it was you know was billed as a judgment-free gym right and everything
[2:26:40.840 --> 2:26:44.120]  that's done are the guys of oh it's judgment-free it turns out there they're
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:47.360]  usually judging a group of people more harshly than anyone else in a planet
[2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:51.000]  fitness that's athletes so if you actually look at planet fitness and what
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:56.160]  their rules are no deadlifting there's no squat rack it's designed to actually
[2:26:56.160 --> 2:27:00.640]  judge and exclude people who are serious about training in order to include
[2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:04.480]  people who literally they give you pizza in tootsie rolls at the gym and tell you
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:07.920]  that you're beautiful and you're perfect just the way you are listen I believe
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:11.160]  that all of God's creatures are beautiful and all are loved you know in the
[2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:14.680]  eyes of the creator but let's be honest some of us need to lose some weight some
[2:27:14.680 --> 2:27:17.440]  of us need to improve ourselves and we don't need a pat in the back to tell us
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:21.480]  to be to wallow in our swat our slothfulness and that's what planet
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:24.440]  fitness does and then of course they took it one step further recently where
[2:27:24.440 --> 2:27:28.440]  I mean you need to know Alex they're incredibly discriminatory right they
[2:27:28.440 --> 2:27:32.560]  say judgment-free they kicked out a lady who complained so this is a story for
[2:27:32.560 --> 2:27:34.560]  people who don't know I'm sure you've covered it on the show but I'll give a
[2:27:34.560 --> 2:27:39.520]  quick recap a man who wants to be a woman when in a planet fitness use the
[2:27:39.520 --> 2:27:42.520]  women's locker rooms and if you see the picture it looks very much like you
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:45.600]  would expect a man in a dress kind of like when bugs bunny would put on the
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:49.680]  dress and you know the other bunnies would thank you with attractive it
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:53.640]  looked like that it was pretty silly one woman complained felt uncomfortable they
[2:27:53.640 --> 2:27:57.640]  revoked her membership they kicked her out they've also kicked out people for
[2:27:57.640 --> 2:28:01.600]  wearing pro-life t-shirts they've kicked out people for looking too strong so
[2:28:01.600 --> 2:28:06.120]  this video that I did was really just not so much exclusively about the
[2:28:06.120 --> 2:28:11.280]  transgender issue but pointing out the fact that whenever you claim to be
[2:28:11.280 --> 2:28:16.880]  inclusive at some point everybody is excluding some group of people so let's
[2:28:16.880 --> 2:28:23.920]  just be honest about it well my issue is is that if a guy can't pass as a woman
[2:28:23.920 --> 2:28:27.400]  he thinks he's a woman he better not go in the women's bathroom and this is what
[2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:32.520]  looks like a 350-pound guy in a dress I mean he looks like the guys in drag from
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:37.120]  police academy of course I mean if I had a beard and walked to the women's
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:42.240]  restroom I go I'm a woman but I'm not obviously a woman it's just it's just
[2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:46.080]  ridiculous well yeah and they always trot out science you know that's the big
[2:28:46.080 --> 2:28:48.680]  if you look on the again lot of with better.com people can go read the
[2:28:48.680 --> 2:28:51.840]  comments liberals are going well or leftists I think you're right in your
[2:28:51.840 --> 2:28:55.520]  terminology are saying well you know you're just denying the science what
[2:28:55.520 --> 2:28:59.200]  science am I denying that if you're you're born a man or a woman that you're a
[2:28:59.200 --> 2:29:02.840]  man or woman and of course liberals and leftists always trot out the extreme
[2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:06.920]  examples right to make their case people who are intersex or people who
[2:29:06.920 --> 2:29:11.400]  actually do have some sort of I guess genetic abnormality I don't know if I
[2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:15.480]  can use the word abnormal because now of course no transgender people make up
[2:29:15.480 --> 2:29:19.760]  point three percent of population America but we have to refer to everyone
[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:23.880]  who's not that as cisgender that's the new term they want you to use I'm going
[2:29:23.880 --> 2:29:29.000]  well gosh there there are more people in this country who are not arachnophobic
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:32.440]  there are more people who are not sure exactly only come back in the next long
[2:29:32.440 --> 2:29:36.680]  segment tell me why you think they're pushing this so hard now now you did
[2:29:36.680 --> 2:29:39.880]  actually look a little bit more like a woman I mean not too much but you don't
[2:29:39.880 --> 2:29:44.200]  you're I mean at least you're not 350 pounds still you you could tell you were
[2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:48.240]  a man but I mean come on we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen stay with us

[2:33:16.680 --> 2:33:24.400]  Stephen Crowder is our guest well-known comedian actor radio host author
[2:33:24.400 --> 2:33:28.480]  Lotto with Crowder.com he had mentioned as a proviso when he first came on with
[2:33:28.480 --> 2:33:31.680]  this and maybe before he leaves we'll discuss it about hey we don't agree on
[2:33:31.680 --> 2:33:35.920]  everything but I'm glad to come on about this so I guess some of the neocons
[2:33:35.920 --> 2:33:39.520]  are kind of rhinos out there I'll probably henpeck him because it's all
[2:33:39.520 --> 2:33:42.760]  this social engineering that he would dare come on the conspiracy theorist show
[2:33:42.760 --> 2:33:48.320]  let me guess Stephen you've probably criticized before I don't know I'm just
[2:33:48.320 --> 2:33:52.840]  guessing for say 9-11 truth or something but that's only because the media mis
[2:33:52.840 --> 2:33:57.400]  represents what I'm saying there are radical Islamists that's going on I was
[2:33:57.400 --> 2:34:00.680]  interviewing the embassy heads and special forces commanders and everybody
[2:34:00.680 --> 2:34:05.200]  else that Al Qaeda was being protected look at how we funded ISIS and Al Qaeda
[2:34:05.200 --> 2:34:09.640]  I mean this I've really been vindicated on all those fronts now I'm going with a
[2:34:09.640 --> 2:34:14.360]  hunch here but let me guess I bet you've been critical of me or something in the
[2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:18.960]  past I'm I don't care if you have been I love it go ahead well well yeah listen
[2:34:18.960 --> 2:34:22.080]  of course they have but you're also by the way syndicated on my my wonderful
[2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:26.320]  home station in Detroit Wham yeah but I've been critical lots of people you
[2:34:26.320 --> 2:34:29.040]  know when I worked at Fox News I was getting in hot water all the time for
[2:34:29.040 --> 2:34:32.080]  criticizing people there what I would love to see is you know let's get you
[2:34:32.080 --> 2:34:35.880]  and Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and Michelle Malkin in a room and let's just
[2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:40.200]  all hog it out because the barrel of the gun that we are looking down right now
[2:34:40.200 --> 2:34:46.040]  Alex is so huge that I'm just done with the infighting but I agree I agree no
[2:34:46.040 --> 2:34:49.760]  exactly I mean Glenn Beck does a lot of great work you do great work Michelle
[2:34:49.760 --> 2:34:54.360]  Malkin does a lot of great work everybody we just need folks that are
[2:34:54.360 --> 2:34:58.000]  saying Ted Cruz isn't perfect well compare him to Hillary Clinton yes he is
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:01.920]  perfect well compare anybody to Hillary Clinton they're gonna look like a
[2:35:01.920 --> 2:35:06.360]  beacon of light and hope and listen and I've gotten flack for saying I don't
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:09.920]  know that Ted Cruz is necessarily the guy I love Ted Cruz you know obviously
[2:35:09.920 --> 2:35:14.920]  the issue is what I love for him to be president sure do I think he can win you
[2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:17.880]  know I'm not sure and some people will go nuts and say that I'm a rhino if I
[2:35:17.880 --> 2:35:20.920]  say that you know it's it's it's one of those things where you can't please
[2:35:20.920 --> 2:35:24.960]  everybody we certainly disagree in a lot I do think that like you said if
[2:35:24.960 --> 2:35:29.400]  someone goes into your arguments on some of the issues I think you're more
[2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:32.200]  reason than the media necessarily portrays you to be it doesn't mean that
[2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:36.480]  I can't have a disagreement but I love it absolutely I think it's awesome that's
[2:35:36.480 --> 2:35:39.520]  what it's all about it's political correctness that tries to act like it's
[2:35:39.520 --> 2:35:44.000]  bad if people debate or disagree that's what makes good radio to begin with no
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:47.160]  I think you're right and I think we've both been accused of being part of a
[2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:53.080]  Zionist gulag on YouTube so there's a kid exactly or working for the Vatican
[2:35:53.080 --> 2:35:56.600]  or space aliens again Stephen Crowder lotter with Crowder.com
[2:35:56.600 --> 2:36:01.040]  excellent videos great radio show Stephen expanding on this though and we've
[2:36:01.040 --> 2:36:06.360]  got all these athletes now competing in powerlifting in in Olympic races and
[2:36:06.360 --> 2:36:11.400]  now the the liberal groups are saying or the socialist groups are saying you've
[2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:16.200]  got to let men compete as women I mean this is an overthrow reality South
[2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:21.000]  Africa's runner makes Olympic debut three after you know three years after
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:24.720]  gender storm. Right well you know it's funny you mentioned that because I
[2:36:24.720 --> 2:36:28.880]  actually wrote a column while I was at Fox News years ago about Fallon Fox and
[2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:31.800]  I know you're you're good friends with Joe Rogan and Eddie Bravo and and Joe
[2:36:31.800 --> 2:36:35.640]  Rogan listen leans to the left obviously socially fiscally tends to be more
[2:36:35.640 --> 2:36:38.400]  conservative he's another free thinker with whom I agree on a lot and
[2:36:38.400 --> 2:36:42.120]  disagree on a lot he even took a stand in the Fallon Fox issue and said like man
[2:36:42.120 --> 2:36:47.080]  that that's an advantage Fallon Fox for those who don't know is a mixed martial
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:52.120]  arts fighter was a man I believe father-to-child his entire life and then
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:55.920]  in his late 20s or 30s decided you want to be a woman and now beats the crap out
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:37:00.880]  of women in a cage for for a living and you know the analogy I use with this and
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:03.600]  people got really mad right because they tried out science and say well there's
[2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:08.640]  no real there's no real lot my Tyson says a woman and go into fighting women
[2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:13.040]  I mean yeah well listen we had shale sonnet on my show last week and he said
[2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:16.680]  listen I have I've fought in UFC I've fought for the title three times he said
[2:37:16.680 --> 2:37:21.840]  I can if I were not on a public radio show I could give you names of men I
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:25.160]  don't know if this is true this is what shale sonnet told me who would cut off
[2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:30.480]  their genitals to win the strap to win a championship now that's what he's saying
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:34.440]  we don't necessarily understand the psyche between behind these athletes and
[2:37:34.440 --> 2:37:39.520]  the extremes they'll go to but the point I made on Fallon Fox is this Christian
[2:37:39.520 --> 2:37:43.120]  Santos cyborg is her nickname she's one of the top female fighters in the
[2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:46.880]  world at one point she was suspended and I believe stripped of her title but she
[2:37:46.880 --> 2:37:50.520]  was certainly suspended because they found out that she had used steroids
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:54.280]  okay at one point in her career I don't even believe it was in that current
[2:37:54.280 --> 2:37:58.960]  fight but they found out she had used steroids and she was suspended Fallon
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:04.080]  Fox has used steroids her whole life they're called balls so if we're going to
[2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:10.580]  act as though it's not an advantage I'm sorry oh geez there you go you want
[2:38:10.580 --> 2:38:15.440]  what Alex said if people send him your hate tweets not not me but listen you
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:19.360]  know a woman on steroids okay for example let's take a natural woman okay
[2:38:19.360 --> 2:38:23.300]  and then a woman on steroids on performance enhancing drug that woman
[2:38:23.300 --> 2:38:28.080]  doesn't enjoy the advantage over a natural woman that I enjoy to give you
[2:38:28.080 --> 2:38:31.600]  another example let's take Arnold or Ronnie Coleman or any of these walking
[2:38:31.600 --> 2:38:35.640]  human pin cushions right these bodybuilders who are any steroid they
[2:38:35.640 --> 2:38:41.240]  can possibly use they put in their body they don't enjoy the hormonal advantage
[2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:48.160]  over me as a steroid it out freak as a man that I enjoy over a normal woman
[2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:53.280]  right on the bone structure it's bone structure it's it's it's the the muscles
[2:38:53.280 --> 2:38:57.920]  the tendons a male brain is more aggressive male brains make quicker
[2:38:57.920 --> 2:39:02.360]  decisions in a fight it's just well known that you can even remove your
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:06.880]  testicles you're still a man genetically and then a lot of these
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:11.480]  transvestites aren't even removing their testicles and they're now allowed to be
[2:39:11.480 --> 2:39:16.240]  in the UFC beating up women or they're allowed to run in the Olympics this is
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:20.360]  all you you're gonna have no one in the Olympics soon but men that have had their
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:24.360]  genitals cut off I don't know if I would go that extreme by the way Fallon Fox
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:27.160]  wasn't fighting in the UFC was fighting in other organizations whatever
[2:39:27.160 --> 2:39:30.880]  fighting and what in those right I understand your point well it is
[2:39:30.880 --> 2:39:33.760]  interesting if people said if that's the science and it's settled right that's
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:37.000]  what anyone says on the left if they disagree well the science is settled
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:39.760]  whether it's climate change or now whether it's the transgenderism thing
[2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:42.480]  which by the way I need people to understand this has not come out of a
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:45.600]  place of hate I mean I've worked as an actor since I was 12 you know I didn't
[2:39:45.600 --> 2:39:50.000]  go to school for many many days I mean because I was out on set so I worked in
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:53.480]  an industry that was pretty liberal you can bet that I've had transgender people
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:57.280]  working on my face or my my whole life I've been around it it's nothing new
[2:39:57.280 --> 2:40:01.240]  you're not attacking anybody but the issue is it's a tiny percentage of the
[2:40:01.240 --> 2:40:07.280]  population we're bombarded with it and then it's not fair that a guy can say
[2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:12.000]  he's a girl in boxing or UFC or any other MMA I mean it's just that's what
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:17.040]  I'm saying why are they so special what's behind the agenda pushing it well I
[2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:20.480]  don't know if it's necessarily behind an agenda I don't think then this is where
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:23.920]  I would say that you and I sometimes disagree right I don't tend to believe
[2:40:23.920 --> 2:40:28.280]  that people get together and set agendas a lot of the time sometimes they do right
[2:40:28.280 --> 2:40:31.800]  there are some people who are proactively evil I would say you know people like the
[2:40:31.800 --> 2:40:34.600]  Akma dinner jobs of the world or Nancy Pelosi depending on how you look at it
[2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:38.640]  but I wouldn't say that necessarily in this case I think what's happened is the
[2:40:38.640 --> 2:40:43.400]  bar has just been moved so frequently that people just accept it I mean the
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:47.600]  transgender thing is really relatively new and by the way we're having a lesbian
[2:40:47.600 --> 2:40:53.280]  guest on my show here this this week or next week I believe and a lot of
[2:40:53.280 --> 2:40:57.080]  lesbians a lot of feminists by the way are offended by the transgender push you
[2:40:57.080 --> 2:41:00.120]  have some liberal feminists to believe that it's a product of patriarchy that
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:03.480]  it's unfair to women for a man to decide that he wants to be a woman and act as
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:07.640]  though he understands the plight of women and the rights that they don't
[2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:10.240]  have I'm not saying I agree with them and then you have lesbians who say that
[2:41:10.240 --> 2:41:14.640]  they feel bullied and that you know they're being marginalized so it's not
[2:41:14.640 --> 2:41:18.960]  like it's settled even on the left but you're told that hey if you believe for
[2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:22.080]  example I watched you know not that long ago maybe about a year and a half ago
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:26.160]  Tyra Banks had a little boy coming out who was seven years old and saying you
[2:41:26.160 --> 2:41:29.920]  know referred to as penises as both defect she's going your birth defect your
[2:41:29.920 --> 2:41:33.080]  penis they're gonna chop it off for the kid because he wants to be a girl at
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:38.320]  what point do we say hey hold on a second it might be healthier with a seven
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:41.280]  year old who by the way three minutes ago was wiping his boogers on the couch
[2:41:41.280 --> 2:41:44.880]  and we're now allowing him to make sexual decisions for the rest of his life
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:49.880]  it might be healthier to maybe see if this if this kid is confused it might be
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:54.240]  healthier to not be look death education 2020 to special on this like
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:41:59.960]  1997 but they introduced it at Columbine first federally and then other
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:03.760]  schools and within a couple years there was a doubling and a tripling of
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:08.000]  suicide that's the same thing you start teaching five and six year olds about
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  transvestites and trannies and she males and and and and hemaphradites the kids
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  end up getting confused and they have the supermodels on TV saying you know
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:23.840]  like you just mentioned we'll get rid of your birth defect it sounds like it's an
[2:42:23.840 --> 2:42:30.200]  attack on the standard genders of the mammal species male and female I think
[2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:34.160]  that's what it is well yeah and that's where you know the left loves to accuse
[2:42:34.160 --> 2:42:38.440]  people of concerns of being simple right yet they grossly oversimplify for
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:42.640]  example the issue of same-sex marriage and I'm not even talking legally if you
[2:42:42.640 --> 2:42:44.840]  want the government to recognize it or not as a matter of fact I'm pretty
[2:42:44.840 --> 2:42:48.920]  libertarian on the issue the problem I have it and by the way it's more
[2:42:48.920 --> 2:42:51.600]  complicated than that even legally where my home country in Canada you have
[2:42:51.600 --> 2:42:54.960]  pastors who are now put in jail for hate speech simply saying they won't marry
[2:42:54.960 --> 2:42:58.080]  members of the same sex so it's more complicated than just love versus hate
[2:42:58.080 --> 2:43:01.280]  that's what I like to teach people about and I like to open up that
[2:43:01.280 --> 2:43:04.920]  discussion your political correctness is a tyranny it's being used to control
[2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:08.240]  language and bully people I mean and I want you to be able to continue but since
[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:11.280]  you mentioned it I thought you were joking we have the video I'll play it
[2:43:11.280 --> 2:43:16.160]  for TV viewers radio listeners just Google a eating pizza while working at
[2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:21.320]  Planet Fitness and we've got footage of this with the guy I mean a guy who's
[2:43:21.320 --> 2:43:27.400]  like he weighs 400 pounds and he's actually working out his back in a
[2:43:27.400 --> 2:43:33.600]  back machine while eating pizza that is from Planet Fitness but don't worry the
[2:43:33.600 --> 2:43:38.560]  purple plate matches the decor right yeah exactly by the way that is it is
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:42.080]  horrible branding if I'm just going to speak from a design perspective yellow
[2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:45.640]  every time I go I mean I can't imagine an epileptic training at Planet Fitness
[2:43:45.640 --> 2:43:49.640]  and be like watching an anime cartoon yeah well listen the idea it could even
[2:43:49.640 --> 2:43:52.720]  go back to like I said you know same sex marriage we're not talking about the
[2:43:52.720 --> 2:43:57.240]  legal issue but what you are saying with that okay and this is something that's
[2:43:57.240 --> 2:43:59.440]  very important here and I hope people understand where I'm coming from it
[2:43:59.440 --> 2:44:02.440]  doesn't come from a position of hate you're saying that men and women are
[2:44:02.440 --> 2:44:06.800]  fundamentally interchangeable you're saying that two daddies don't two
[2:44:06.800 --> 2:44:10.640]  daddies can offer everything that a daddy and a mommy can't you are saying
[2:44:10.640 --> 2:44:14.600]  that two women offer everything that a man can't and I don't agree with that
[2:44:14.600 --> 2:44:17.880]  premise I don't accept that premise but here's the problem when you start down
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:22.200]  that road well you've made men and women fundamentally interchangeable you now
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:25.040]  can't say okay we're at a fork we have to stop here when you get to the
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:29.000]  transgender issue you have to be accepting of any and all preferences
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:33.360]  regarding what people want now in in Europe and in Australia they're trying
[2:44:33.360 --> 2:44:37.320]  to legalize pedophilia saying that oh that's the next front we're on from we're
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:41.200]  on from the age of consent in Quebec is 14 years old now again we want to be
[2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:44.160]  accepting of people right we want to be accepting of everything apparently well
[2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:49.440]  you tell me that a relationship between a 55 year old man and a 15 year old boy
[2:44:49.440 --> 2:44:54.560]  is just as sexually healthy as a 25 year old man and look we're supposed to be
[2:44:54.560 --> 2:45:01.600]  tolerant that's true Thomas Jefferson you know liberalism not just anything and
[2:45:01.600 --> 2:45:05.560]  everything goes because we know a year-old baby shouldn't be having sex
[2:45:05.560 --> 2:45:09.720]  with a 50 year old biologically it's not designed to do that it is perverse
[2:45:09.720 --> 2:45:14.480]  what we're saying is there are limits we have to make decisions in this universe
[2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:18.600]  and we're being told by the so-called leftist no there are no limits except
[2:45:18.600 --> 2:45:22.760]  we'll arrest you if you read out of the Bible in Canada the you know these
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:28.160]  passages so really I I think it's coming to a crisis point though it's gotten so
[2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:32.560]  obvious so ridiculous the Starbucks program blew up in their face everything
[2:45:32.560 --> 2:45:36.400]  Michelle Obama pushes is blowing up in their face I think we're starting to
[2:45:36.400 --> 2:45:39.800]  hit bottom here what do you say I think there are four winning issues for
[2:45:39.800 --> 2:45:43.120]  conservatives and I know now Alex do you consider yourself a conservative or
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:46.920]  libertarian what I'm a libertarian constitutionalist pro pro human that
[2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:51.880]  once our civilization to survive but I'm into self-defense I'm pro-life so I'm
[2:45:51.880 --> 2:45:55.320]  lined up with conservatives almost issues right well and you know that my
[2:45:55.320 --> 2:45:58.200]  problem with the word libertarian is you know you've got you've got you you've
[2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:02.040]  got Glenn Beck then you've got Bill Maher and you know all of them claim to be
[2:46:02.040 --> 2:46:04.960]  libertarian so the word the waters have been muddied so I just say
[2:46:04.960 --> 2:46:09.160]  conservative but most people would consider me more libertarian I came
[2:46:09.160 --> 2:46:12.040]  there's a quite oh yeah what's there are four winning issues I think you're
[2:46:12.040 --> 2:46:15.000]  right here with conservatives okay there are four issues were leftists have
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:19.200]  really overreached and you're seeing some rebound effect guns even with my
[2:46:19.200 --> 2:46:22.480]  generation and I think call it the video game generation they want to fire off
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:26.760]  cool guns so losing issue for liberals feminism feminism is overreached
[2:46:26.760 --> 2:46:29.720]  because you now have a generation of young girls who don't believe that being
[2:46:29.720 --> 2:46:34.520]  treated like women is anti-feminist and then free speech there's been a real
[2:46:34.520 --> 2:46:37.640]  overreach from the left on free speech where I think you're even getting some
[2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:41.080]  rebound on college campuses where kids are rebelling against the political
[2:46:41.080 --> 2:46:44.560]  correctness and I can't remember what the fourth one is I'd have to get the
[2:46:44.560 --> 2:46:48.080]  Islamic terrorism yeah Islamic terrorism by the way when I see these videos on
[2:46:48.080 --> 2:46:53.000]  YouTube you can go back in 2008 2009 almost all of the comments where this is
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:56.240]  Islamophobic this is hate speech and I've noticed a turn even on YouTube a
[2:46:56.240 --> 2:46:59.920]  super liberal platform of people going yeah okay this this is something we have
[2:46:59.920 --> 2:47:03.240]  to get a handle on it's not the same as other religions out there why do the
[2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:08.440]  Muslims and I'm not anti-muslim but I'm anti-radical Muslim why like they've
[2:47:08.440 --> 2:47:12.520]  even had to that David Cross movie came out where at the end the guy goes I got
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:17.920]  all this from Alex Jones Alex Jones I hate blacks Jews and Muslims what is
[2:47:17.920 --> 2:47:21.680]  this thing where the left claims that if you're against radical Islamist it's
[2:47:21.680 --> 2:47:25.720]  like a form of racism when the radical Islamist are sexually mutilating women
[2:47:25.720 --> 2:47:30.200]  enslaving people killing everybody and you never hear any feminist criticize
[2:47:30.200 --> 2:47:35.680]  them why are radical Islamists such darlings to the left well it's a good
[2:47:35.680 --> 2:47:38.320]  point and I don't think you one can expect feminists to be consistent on
[2:47:38.320 --> 2:47:42.280]  anything I mean we're feminists they talk about supposed rape culture when
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:45.640]  men are dragging their tallywackers into well at women's locker rooms to
[2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:49.240]  plant a fitness where the feminist anti-rape culture is there with Islam
[2:47:49.240 --> 2:47:54.200]  you're right that the silence is is deafening I'm not anti-muslim I've
[2:47:54.200 --> 2:47:57.960]  talked about this okay not give you an example I am a Christian I'm very honest
[2:47:57.960 --> 2:48:01.080]  about it even as a libertarian but I personally am a Christian not all
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:06.240]  Christians are perfect okay but I believe Jesus was and I think anybody who's not
[2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:09.880]  even a Christian could look to whether they think it's a fable or not of Jesus
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:13.160]  and say okay it's a pretty good example not all Muslims are terrorists sure
[2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:18.720]  Muhammad was Muhammad the prime example was someone who did kill who did be head
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:22.200]  who did beat his wife who did call for the deaths of Christians and Jews so my
[2:48:22.200 --> 2:48:26.600]  problem isn't necessarily with all Muslims but if you look at ISIS and you
[2:48:26.600 --> 2:48:29.440]  look at the Muslims who maybe aren't going as extreme as them you have to say
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:33.320]  okay who is closer to emulating Muhammad my problem is not with Muslims my
[2:48:33.320 --> 2:48:36.960]  problem was with Muhammad and that of course is hate speech and politically
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:41.040]  incorrect to say but I've read the Quran and I've studied Muhammad and the guy
[2:48:41.040 --> 2:48:45.000]  was a terrorist so let's have an honest conversation about that well he
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:48.360]  certainly did conquer the areas around him by the sword but then the people
[2:48:48.360 --> 2:48:52.520]  would argue that's what happened in this country my issue is is that they're
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:56.240]  using radical Islam to basically take our basic rights to protect us but they're
[2:48:56.240 --> 2:48:59.480]  not protecting us and then radical Islam is getting bigger and more out of
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:04.320]  control than ever and it's just a nightmare situation shifting gears back
[2:49:04.320 --> 2:49:10.040]  into when you got in drag to go into Planet Fitness to illustrate how
[2:49:10.040 --> 2:49:14.560]  absurd it is what do you think's driving Planet Fitness to create such a
[2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:19.520]  bizarre environment and how does that tie in to what Starbucks is doing I mean
[2:49:19.520 --> 2:49:24.200]  it was so surreal to send our cameras into Austin Starbucks's last week where
[2:49:24.200 --> 2:49:27.960]  they were handing out newspaper checklist of you know how you're racist and
[2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:32.120]  all this stuff yeah I mean anybody with a brain knows that's gonna create racial
[2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:36.240]  division it's not gonna create unity yeah well I went into Starbucks the very
[2:49:36.240 --> 2:49:40.440]  next day and they said how do you take your coffee I said I take it Ving Reigns
[2:49:40.440 --> 2:49:44.240]  just to see how they react listen I mean it's one of those things I I won't
[2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:48.240]  relent I won't even give it credence the politically correct thing the racing
[2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:51.680]  listen here's the crazy thing to Alex I'm substantially younger than you are I
[2:49:51.680 --> 2:49:55.840]  said not as an affront just to talk about the generational gap here and I was
[2:49:55.840 --> 2:50:00.920]  raised in Canada okay so I was raised in not only a post-racial America but
[2:50:00.920 --> 2:50:06.200]  Canada I will tell you this there has never been more racial tension in my
[2:50:06.200 --> 2:50:09.520]  lifetime now I wasn't alive obviously for the Civil Rights Act I wasn't alive
[2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:13.040]  for the Detroit riots like my father who was raised in the bad part of
[2:50:13.040 --> 2:50:17.040]  Detroit that Eminem tries to claim he's from as the phony that he is I didn't
[2:50:17.040 --> 2:50:21.280]  experience that so I was raised in a post-racial America but today it is
[2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:26.440]  worse than ever today I have kids with whom I went to high school who we were
[2:50:26.440 --> 2:50:29.960]  friends with now saying that there's an established form of racism and the system
[2:50:29.960 --> 2:50:33.240]  is stacked against them and that's a new thing for these people who have known my
[2:50:33.240 --> 2:50:37.360]  entire life yeah that's a new identity is that they've been abused and that
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:40.740]  something's happened to them and they're talking to some you know Eastern
[2:50:40.740 --> 2:50:43.880]  European I've seen this on the street who has no history of enslaving black
[2:50:43.880 --> 2:50:47.760]  people and it's just it's just crazy final segment straight ahead with Steven
[2:50:47.760 --> 2:50:51.560]  Crowder we're gonna get his take on where he thinks all this is going but
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:55.480]  you know Planet Fitness folks has alarms in it if you make any noise and then

[2:54:58.520 --> 2:55:02.680]  minutes you've got the floor to give your other points about where you see
[2:55:02.680 --> 2:55:07.240]  this society going what you think about the election and where you think it's
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:12.960]  going with this obsession you think our national domestic products you know not
[2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:17.120]  even propaganda or military hardware now but just nitting about what politically
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:21.240]  correct group or in you in the last segment talking about people you know who
[2:55:21.240 --> 2:55:27.120]  now their whole identity is being in a persecuted group yeah and I have to be
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:30.280]  careful obviously the way I word that because these are good people they're
[2:55:30.280 --> 2:55:33.360]  certain I just think these are people who've been misled you know it's funny
[2:55:33.360 --> 2:55:36.720]  I've been writing this book for a while and I only have two books in my lifetime
[2:55:36.720 --> 2:55:40.640]  but I want to read I want to write sorry and I remember when I pitched it to one
[2:55:40.640 --> 2:55:44.080]  publisher they they took it and they said well we need it to be more dubious
[2:55:44.080 --> 2:55:47.280]  day theory it's too it's too funny it's too positive it offers too many
[2:55:47.280 --> 2:55:52.720]  solutions so give an idea the one chapter in there there are two kinds of
[2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:57.560]  leftist in this country there are the manipulators the propellers right the
[2:55:57.560 --> 2:56:01.320]  the James Cameron's the Hillary Clinton's the Barack Obama's okay people who I
[2:56:01.320 --> 2:56:06.120]  think know better on a lot of issues but proactively try and manipulate certain
[2:56:06.120 --> 2:56:08.880]  people in the public now that's a very small percentage of leftists I think of
[2:56:08.880 --> 2:56:14.000]  the majority of people who vote Democrat who go what we would call liberal our
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:17.360]  people who don't know any better who take the default political position as
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:22.320]  given to them by culture by these leftist propellers the entertainment
[2:56:22.320 --> 2:56:26.600]  industry the media right so so I think it's important to distinguish between
[2:56:26.600 --> 2:56:29.800]  those two because if you're dealing with someone who's proactively lying and
[2:56:29.800 --> 2:56:32.600]  manipulating I think you need to make an example of them but I think a lot of
[2:56:32.600 --> 2:56:35.560]  these people who are going along with what they've been taught their entire
[2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:38.960]  lives through public schools university and what they hear in the media in
[2:56:38.960 --> 2:56:43.280]  Hollywood those are people who whose minds can be changed and I think that's
[2:56:43.280 --> 2:56:45.720]  kind of what you're seeing with Planet Fitness listen I don't think the
[2:56:45.720 --> 2:56:50.120]  franchise owner in Midland Michigan is out there trying to break down the
[2:56:50.120 --> 2:56:54.680]  barriers of sexual norms I don't think so but I think he's been given a piece of
[2:56:54.680 --> 2:56:58.680]  paper saying this is our policy from someone who does want to try and subvert
[2:56:58.680 --> 2:57:01.880]  culture and he has to go along with it because he doesn't know any better so
[2:57:01.880 --> 2:57:05.720]  while I do believe in standing up for what we believe in and I do believe in
[2:57:05.720 --> 2:57:08.920]  being bold I also think it's important understand that there's some people out
[2:57:08.920 --> 2:57:13.120]  there whose minds can be changed and in they're not necessarily being proactive
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:16.000]  with the manipulation and it's important to make that that
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:19.920]  distinguishment sure there are a lot of liberals out there really mean well and
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:23.960]  they don't realize that they're sure working for a bizarre cult of control
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:27.280]  freaks that want to totally enslave this country I mean look at the power
[2:57:27.280 --> 2:57:32.080]  grabbing going on right now by Obama and the Republican leadership's doing
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:37.320]  nothing the internet the borders that just just everything I mean what do you
[2:57:37.320 --> 2:57:42.120]  think the next shoot a drop is in the power grab gosh man you know I don't
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:45.200]  know the way I see it is if people who are paid to make political predictions
[2:57:45.200 --> 2:57:49.840]  all over the news get it wrong about 90% of the time you know me in my little
[2:57:49.840 --> 2:57:56.120]  home studio here with a bag of potato chips haven't got but so I stay away

[3:00:12.760 --> 3:00:17.360]  we've got a debate men at the Olympics that say they're women winning the races
[3:00:17.360 --> 3:00:24.840]  it's because they've had their you know what removed or that a 350 pound guy
[3:00:24.840 --> 3:00:30.320]  walks into women's bathroom with his junk flying around and then the woman

[3:00:33.880 --> 3:00:39.320]  just this is the conditioning we're under if they can get away with stupid
[3:00:39.320 --> 3:00:43.320]  silly stuff I'm not obsessed with this stuff I'm sick of it they can get away
[3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:49.720]  with anything folks I mean imagine how many crazy freaks there are that just
[3:00:49.720 --> 3:00:53.040]  want to go stalk women and now they can put a wig on and go in the women's
[3:00:53.040 --> 3:00:57.360]  bathroom we can do a stunt where I show up at like a women's softball game maybe
[3:00:57.360 --> 3:01:02.280]  of like teenagers dressed as a woman and then I just demand to be on the high
[3:01:02.280 --> 3:01:06.640]  school team they're like well you're not in the school don't you judge me and then

[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:19.560]  course they probably beat me so it wouldn't be a good analogy I don't know
[3:01:19.560 --> 3:01:25.200]  I'll show up in like a woman's weightlifting event and I'll say I want
[3:01:25.200 --> 3:01:27.920]  to be in the lowest weight class because it's discriminatory you know if it's

[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:52.320]  what do you think about the presidential race my friend you know I think
[3:01:52.320 --> 3:01:58.520]  people ought to just sit down and ask themselves one simple question you look
[3:01:58.520 --> 3:02:04.720]  at the candidates and you and you say which one of these candidates have
[3:02:04.720 --> 3:02:12.400]  actually honored their oath of office we have got cemeteries across this entire
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:20.080]  country of fatherless and motherless families because they did and now we
[3:02:20.080 --> 3:02:23.760]  have a Congress and we have a government that's trying to eliminate
[3:02:23.760 --> 3:02:29.840]  everything that every war has been about up to this point our basic freedom and
[3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:35.160]  nobody is standing up for it you got all these people who have lost people in the
[3:02:35.160 --> 3:02:39.640]  military they ought to be raising hell with this government right now I agree
[3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:44.160]  with you I mean what which Republican candidate do you like or none of them I
[3:02:44.160 --> 3:02:49.720]  like Rand Paul myself yeah I like Rand Paul I really do he just doesn't have a
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:56.120]  slick a team but and I know Rand Paul I know he's a good man and so I guess
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:03:00.080]  that's who I need to support him Ted Cruz though is very strong I really like

[3:03:20.680 --> 3:03:24.720]  hikes along the Appalachian Trail so I refer to some resources that are
[3:03:24.720 --> 3:03:29.160]  available to the public like Georgia force watch quarterly newsletter turns
[3:03:29.160 --> 3:03:35.280]  out the US Army Rangers have been conducting military exercises in what
[3:03:35.280 --> 3:03:39.920]  they call Cooper Creek area which is right along or close to the Tennessee
[3:03:39.920 --> 3:03:47.040]  state line along the Appalachian Trail and I find this to be highly unusual for
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:51.840]  military activity I was 11 Bravo myself Army infantry and you usually don't
[3:03:51.840 --> 3:03:56.760]  conduct military activities in a public area and when you've got Deuce and a

[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:41.880]  training has dual use overseas but they're doing it openly in civilian
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:47.840]  areas to condition the military and the public to accept military occupation in
[3:04:47.840 --> 3:04:52.080]  the US under the brigade homeland plan and the John Warren defense

[3:08:22.960 --> 3:08:28.840]  report tomorrow here on air because stars and stripes has come out here's
[3:08:28.840 --> 3:08:33.280]  part of the story Army Special Operations Command pushes back against
[3:08:33.280 --> 3:08:38.440]  alarmist claims about upcoming exercise Washington U.S. Army Special Operations
[3:08:38.440 --> 3:08:42.200]  Command is pushing back against alarmist claims that an upcoming U.S.
[3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:47.240]  military exercise is preparation for imposing martial law or subduing right
[3:08:47.240 --> 3:08:52.200]  leaning groups and individuals he goes on to say conspiracy theories about the
[3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:58.160]  exercise known as Jade Helm appeared online this week some commentators
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:03.840]  railed against the event referred to an online slideshow allegedly created by
[3:09:03.840 --> 3:09:08.720]  USA South Command which outlined a special operations exercise they then
[3:09:08.720 --> 3:09:13.400]  go on to say but we couldn't get through the firewall to see it so we can't tell
[3:09:13.400 --> 3:09:18.000]  you what's real or not no it's real they then respond and say well we are doing
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:23.040]  this but you know it's endangering lives for you to criticize us they always
[3:09:23.040 --> 3:09:30.000]  act like the propagandists military.com has it as well it's all over the news
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:35.720]  that we're against the troops or we hate the military no no we hate the
[3:09:35.720 --> 3:09:40.160]  military being used by the globalist I mean I guess gun confiscation didn't
[3:09:40.160 --> 3:09:45.000]  happen in Katrina either I mean I've been to so many military training sessions
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:48.120]  with the Marines and the Army where they're trying to take American guns
[3:09:48.120 --> 3:09:52.520]  it's been in the news they're training to take on veterans and gun owners it's
[3:09:52.520 --> 3:09:55.280]  in the news they're teaching police departments that they will engage
[3:09:55.280 --> 3:09:59.240]  veterans who will attack them with IEDs they tell every department in the
[3:09:59.240 --> 3:10:05.080]  country you will be engaged by veterans in a civil war they've been teaching us
[3:10:05.080 --> 3:10:09.640]  for six seven years out of the clear blue sky with none of that happening now
[3:10:09.640 --> 3:10:15.520]  what does that tell me they're going to stage stuff and blame it on us we in the
[3:10:15.520 --> 3:10:19.320]  Liberty Movement are trying to get ahead of this to have a debate about it so the
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:23.760]  Psyop doesn't work to get the public and the military to accept it because get
[3:10:23.760 --> 3:10:30.840]  this straight they say in this new military exercise Jade Helm 15 that it
[3:10:30.840 --> 3:10:35.920]  is to get the locals to understand the mission and to create relationships they
[3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:40.680]  say that and then they called Joe Biggs who was Staff Sergeant the Army one of
[3:10:40.680 --> 3:10:45.280]  his friends was in there called him and texted him and said shut up it's our
[3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:51.160]  Psyop stay out of it okay so that's what's going on now I'm gonna shut up
[3:10:51.160 --> 3:10:55.400]  and go to 11 Bravo again tell folks when and where you were in the military and
[3:10:55.400 --> 3:11:01.560]  from your experience how this mission is different go ahead hi Alex yes I was
[3:11:01.560 --> 3:11:06.760]  in the military back in 81 through 84 long time ago however back then we had
[3:11:06.760 --> 3:11:12.520]  Ronald Reagan who had our sixth so thank God for him but anyway as I mentioned I
[3:11:12.520 --> 3:11:16.900]  was planning a hike along the Appalachian Trail doing some research on the
[3:11:16.900 --> 3:11:21.080]  Appalachians and where to start exactly and I came across the Georgia force watch
[3:11:21.080 --> 3:11:27.200]  quarterly which is a public publication and surprising to see that they had an
[3:11:27.200 --> 3:11:32.040]  article and again this is public information about expanding military
[3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:36.880]  training activities by the US Army Rangers and Cooper Creek which I found to
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:41.200]  be highly unusual being a former soldier myself you usually don't perform
[3:11:41.200 --> 3:11:45.520]  military exercises around the public there's so many reasons obviously one of
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:51.680]  safety but it was confirmed initially back in June of last year when a Georgia
[3:11:51.680 --> 3:11:57.280]  force watch district leader came across two Army Rangers on foot along with a
[3:11:57.280 --> 3:12:02.560]  pickup truck unmarked pickup truck and it was close to the Brian Creek tributary
[3:12:02.560 --> 3:12:07.840]  which is runs into Cooper Creek and so he asked him what they were doing at that
[3:12:07.840 --> 3:12:13.120]  time and they said all they were doing was looking for scouting basically
[3:12:13.120 --> 3:12:17.720]  landing sites for a helicopter because as they said the Colonel wants to step
[3:12:17.720 --> 3:12:21.880]  out what that means it's cryptic I have no idea and then there was another
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:29.280]  confirmation that was made in November of last year and again the regional
[3:12:29.280 --> 3:12:36.600]  force watch leader was on a hike and he ran across the Army Rangers and this
[3:12:36.600 --> 3:12:41.440]  time they had six doos and a half Army trucks and they were walking with weapons
[3:12:41.440 --> 3:12:45.680]  and by the way we found the news articles you're you're talking about you
[3:12:45.680 --> 3:12:50.520]  find them mm-hmm now now so it's public information then they ran across them
[3:12:50.520 --> 3:12:54.720]  again December question the Army Rangers again they said you know we're gonna be
[3:12:54.720 --> 3:12:58.960]  running exercises here on a regular basis and you're gonna see a lot more of us
[3:12:58.960 --> 3:13:04.720]  my question is and I think you're hitting it head on and right on is what
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:10.560]  are they doing there on the Appalachian Trail in a public area when there's two
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:19.160]  Army Ranger bases close by it's all to condition the public ran corporations on
[3:13:19.160 --> 3:13:24.560]  record with the National Stabilization Force and they've admitted that TSA will
[3:13:24.560 --> 3:13:28.240]  be their little on-the-ground toddlers and then when they need it they're gonna
[3:13:28.240 --> 3:13:32.280]  call in Army units that are in every city when the FBI gave us documents on
[3:13:32.280 --> 3:13:42.040]  video in 1999 on the day after Thanksgiving there was a military Army
[3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:45.960]  checkpoint my camera guy saw I pulled over the FBI pulls up goes here's your
[3:13:45.960 --> 3:13:49.680]  document get out of here we know it's good for you we don't know why they gave
[3:13:49.680 --> 3:13:54.680]  it to us and and it was all about secret operations the military is here to
[3:13:54.680 --> 3:14:00.760]  provide every county with everything from Arab Arab evac down to warrants
[3:14:00.760 --> 3:14:04.640]  service and I already knew from people I'd talked to about classified programs
[3:14:04.640 --> 3:14:10.000]  going on then with the military helping SWAT teams and stuff so it's a huge
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:16.480]  covert operation and the issue is it's seismically building it's exponentially
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:25.120]  getting bigger and now it's rolling out nationwide towards a larger event and
[3:14:25.120 --> 3:14:28.040]  that's clearly what's happening I mean it may not be this year five years from
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:32.120]  now but we see the power grabbing by Washington people always say oh when's
[3:14:32.120 --> 3:14:36.760]  the big martial law takeover well it only has to happen if the state stand up
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:41.080]  and say they're not going along with a gun confiscation order or a carbon tax
[3:14:41.080 --> 3:14:45.160]  order and they know Texas in Utah and other legislatures just so happen to be
[3:14:45.160 --> 3:14:49.240]  the ones that have been bucking all this and so now they're listed as hostile on
[3:14:49.240 --> 3:14:56.240]  a map that is a Psyop to again slowly condition the troops from enlisted
[3:14:56.240 --> 3:15:02.320]  right up to the commissioned officers that this is the new game in town and
[3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:07.320]  so that's all this is I'm not saying as the as the Army Times says or Stars and
[3:15:07.320 --> 3:15:11.600]  Stripes says or as military.com says that they're coming to Texas this summer
[3:15:11.600 --> 3:15:16.480]  to take over notice how they never say who I am or link to our report they
[3:15:16.480 --> 3:15:22.560]  misstate what we're saying we're saying this is part of a longtime strategic
[3:15:22.560 --> 3:15:30.000]  program to prepare us under the rural affairs committee that Obama set up
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:34.800]  last year that that that so calm is over if you if you look up Obama's
[3:15:34.800 --> 3:15:41.400]  executive order it says Southcom and then Northcom are over the FEMA
[3:15:41.400 --> 3:15:46.800]  jurisdiction in the 10 regions rural regions of the 10 FEMA regions and it
[3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:52.760]  says to stabilize local communities during any emergency see they're getting
[3:15:52.760 --> 3:15:58.000]  ready for this and they've got to have it going covertly for a long time before
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:02.920]  they finally pull the trigger anything else 11 Bravo yes exactly I'll get it
[3:16:02.920 --> 3:16:06.120]  right on the head not only that my training what they taught us to do was
[3:16:06.120 --> 3:16:10.960]  cut off what all major entry and exit points in and out of cities metropolitan
[3:16:10.960 --> 3:16:16.720]  areas what's the Appalachian Trail as well it's a trail that runs from Georgia
[3:16:16.720 --> 3:16:21.120]  I think right at the end of it Alabama Alabama Georgia line all the way up to
[3:16:21.120 --> 3:16:26.920]  Maine absolutely in an exit route yep absolutely you choke that at these key
[3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:30.800]  points you just said it exactly they're preparing to lock this country down God
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:34.320]  bless you they're preparing this permanently so they're building a base
[3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:39.480]  there stick units there that is incredible guys put the Appalachian Trail on
[3:16:39.480 --> 3:16:43.480]  screen for folks thank you thank you so much sir great point he just said the
[3:16:43.480 --> 3:16:47.480]  key there at the end that is the absolute key and it is sick to watch this
[3:16:47.480 --> 3:16:51.120]  cut our borders wide open but they're putting troops in the Appalachian Trail
[3:16:51.120 --> 3:16:55.640]  they don't want you to be able to move that's why for 10 years they've been
[3:16:55.640 --> 3:16:59.160]  putting the highway dividers up on record to stop people cutting across the
[3:16:59.160 --> 3:17:05.280]  highway they've got them all the way from Austin down to Mexico on I-35 they
[3:17:05.280 --> 3:17:09.880]  are they are tightening everything up folks Jim in Georgia you're on the year
[3:17:09.880 --> 3:17:15.640]  go ahead bless you been a while since I've been able to get in see that as a
[3:17:15.640 --> 3:17:19.440]  good thing I want to give you a little background just real quick give you just
[3:17:19.440 --> 3:17:24.120]  before the battle number I'm sorry just for the battle mothers the animal faces
[3:17:24.120 --> 3:17:29.080]  Argentina and a silver note I love you all I could talk for hours I lost 50
[3:17:29.080 --> 3:17:32.840]  pounds that I needed to lose I'm in I'm in my fighting right now and that's due
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:36.960]  to a lot of what I've learned on your program and using your product I thank
[3:17:36.960 --> 3:17:41.720]  very much thank you you've got a real handle on the true definition of the
[3:17:41.720 --> 3:17:47.880]  word liberal and I love that it is time to really dig into what our father's
[3:17:47.880 --> 3:17:53.520]  definition of the word Israel is let us not be confused any longer use the
[3:17:53.520 --> 3:18:00.280]  strong spokesman on the Hebrew as or the son was Hebrew my point is best taken
[3:18:00.280 --> 3:18:04.560]  to heart all those who believe in our father in heaven will learn his true
[3:18:04.560 --> 3:18:09.800]  name and the name of his phone I just wanted to put that out as an emergency
[3:18:09.800 --> 3:18:14.560]  broadcast everybody needs to understand what Israel is by our father's
[3:18:14.560 --> 3:18:19.440]  definition not by this new definition just like liberal was taken over so was
[3:18:19.440 --> 3:18:24.680]  that definition what do you have what say you sir well there's a lot of
[3:18:24.680 --> 3:18:27.440]  definitions of Israel but but I mean specifically I think I know where you're
[3:18:27.440 --> 3:18:31.960]  going with this give us your interpretation well I know that there's
[3:18:31.960 --> 3:18:38.000]  two there is the land that is his it doesn't matter who is occupying it
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:47.320]  there's also his people those are the two that I truly know now who are his
[3:18:47.320 --> 3:18:53.840]  people we you know we all the people who are Gentiles also are involved in this
[3:18:53.840 --> 3:18:59.840]  we are talking about he his son came here and he spread it across the whole
[3:18:59.840 --> 3:19:06.320]  world okay it was started there and it's gotten to here me and you there are so
[3:19:06.320 --> 3:19:12.080]  many people that get this like Lauren in Ohio she gets exactly what's going on
[3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:17.920]  even probably better than I do but this is very serious we need to know his
[3:19:17.920 --> 3:19:21.440]  definition I just wanted to throw it out there and it's not really about my
[3:19:21.440 --> 3:19:25.440]  definition it's about big man defined what the definition that he said it is
[3:19:25.440 --> 3:19:29.080]  now I hear you I got a jump we're gonna go to break no I'm gonna skip this break
[3:19:29.080 --> 3:19:34.040]  I'm gonna go right to the bottom of the hour to talk to Alex and Rich and Greg
[3:19:34.040 --> 3:19:37.320]  and Casey but I got to just give a few minutes each caller so I can get
[3:19:37.320 --> 3:19:43.440]  everybody in here this is really important to try to force a national
[3:19:43.440 --> 3:19:47.040]  debate about militarization of police federalization which really means
[3:19:47.040 --> 3:19:50.880]  globalization because the feds are captured by the definition by the
[3:19:50.880 --> 3:19:58.120]  globalist so federalization means globalization means checkmate and we
[3:19:58.120 --> 3:20:03.640]  to force a debate about the fact that our military our military is incredibly
[3:20:03.640 --> 3:20:12.360]  awake because they're being trained to take on the American people so you need
[3:20:12.360 --> 3:20:18.520]  to understand this is coming from them it's not our opinion and so we need to
[3:20:18.520 --> 3:20:23.440]  support them instead of just sitting here and letting the globalists use them
[3:20:23.440 --> 3:20:27.920]  forever they want we are having a battle right now over control of the armed
[3:20:27.920 --> 3:20:32.320]  forces of the Republic the Republic as we know it is being folded in to global
[3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:37.800]  treaties right now and is ending and I just got chills the country is really
[3:20:37.800 --> 3:20:44.040]  dying right now and then I get ashamed that I'm even like it's been the last
[3:20:44.040 --> 3:20:47.440]  hour laughing at you know the whole socialist movement they're not funny
[3:20:47.440 --> 3:20:51.880]  they know exactly what they're doing we laugh at these people but it they're
[3:20:51.880 --> 3:20:56.520]  taking over they're conquering us because they manipulate definitions they
[3:20:56.520 --> 3:21:04.560]  play games let's go to Alex in Nevada says you're a federal employee comments
[3:21:04.560 --> 3:21:10.600]  on military training go ahead Alex hey Alex how's it going good I've been
[3:21:10.600 --> 3:21:14.120]  listening to you for oh well first of all I'd say thank you for everything that
[3:21:14.120 --> 3:21:19.720]  you do my brother turning on to you back in 2005 when I was in the Navy and you
[3:21:19.720 --> 3:21:25.240]  have just opened up my eyes and I've never lessen more wake ever yeah but
[3:21:25.240 --> 3:21:28.400]  anyways I just like to say what a little brother was saying that I'm not sure
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:33.640]  if this is legal or not but um let's see now when he was in that he he was he was
[3:21:33.640 --> 3:21:39.560]  hiking along some a trail in the public lands and he saw the military operating
[3:21:39.560 --> 3:21:45.840]  there well I'm a DOD employee and the military base that I work on it is a
[3:21:45.840 --> 3:21:50.080]  training base and they operate in forest lands every single day the
[3:21:50.080 --> 3:21:55.800]  instructors go out every day the students go out every day let's you know we
[3:21:55.800 --> 3:22:02.440]  have a we have a like a small a small team of Rangers Marines Air Force these
[3:22:02.440 --> 3:22:07.160]  back ops guys come out on public lands and like a some of the guys that I work
[3:22:07.160 --> 3:22:10.760]  with they we've got their hiking with their families and they would go out and
[3:22:10.760 --> 3:22:16.480]  all of a sudden they'd see like some some military guys just camouflage just
[3:22:16.480 --> 3:22:22.880]  hiding on the wood now there's I know for a fact that there's no urban training
[3:22:22.880 --> 3:22:27.720]  environments there's pretty much just just in the woods and in the mountains
[3:22:27.720 --> 3:22:33.720]  that train for Afghanistan but there's a lot of joint training going on and
[3:22:33.720 --> 3:22:37.240]  there's a lot of legitimate training going on and a lot of times the troops
[3:22:37.240 --> 3:22:42.240]  are on a mission that sounds legitimate but it's all a psi-op cover to condition
[3:22:42.240 --> 3:22:46.360]  the public for military operations domestically and the complete revocation
[3:22:46.360 --> 3:22:49.360]  of posse common taught us which is basically already happened good to hear
[3:22:49.360 --> 3:22:54.840]  from you Alex rich in New York you're on the air yeah Alex how you doing good
[3:22:54.840 --> 3:22:58.960]  brother listen up for about 15 years maybe longer walk up a lot of people
[3:22:58.960 --> 3:23:03.240]  because you thank you very much I was just wondering about getting together
[3:23:03.240 --> 3:23:06.800]  and not that kind of Wall Street sit-in stuff that there was before but
[3:23:06.800 --> 3:23:10.200]  something legitimate especially when you're talking about what's gonna go on
[3:23:10.200 --> 3:23:14.240]  in Texas and you know as a show of support against those type of things to
[3:23:14.240 --> 3:23:17.680]  show them that oh we're aware of what's going on absolutely if people can
[3:23:17.680 --> 3:23:22.640]  organize ongoing demonstrations marches summits meetings about the
[3:23:22.640 --> 3:23:28.120]  transformation of America from a republic to a globalist enclave a
[3:23:28.120 --> 3:23:35.080]  globalist fiefdom it needs to happen yeah I totally agree the other thing
[3:23:35.080 --> 3:23:39.480]  Alex is a little bit of spiritual thing um when you talk about this being
[3:23:39.480 --> 3:23:43.360]  Luciferian there's an article you might really want to read it's very
[3:23:43.360 --> 3:23:47.240]  interesting it's by a christian mystic guy called Rudolph Steiner and it's
[3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:51.200]  called the advent of Arriman and I think you find it very very interesting
[3:23:51.200 --> 3:23:55.400]  especially the way it relates to the technocracy so if you ever get a chance
[3:23:55.400 --> 3:23:59.600]  check that out and you'll find it very illuminating thank you so much sir God
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:03.440]  bless you I'll try to look into that in fact right when the show ends let's go
[3:24:03.440 --> 3:24:10.520]  ahead and go to Casey Casey in Oregon you're on the air Alex I consider myself
[3:24:10.520 --> 3:24:15.280]  a general in the info war and I have a mission for all the info warriors get on
[3:24:15.280 --> 3:24:18.480]  YouTube get in the comments and start controlling the narrative because right
[3:24:18.480 --> 3:24:23.320]  now we're not we need to get in the vaccine videos get on the comments there
[3:24:23.320 --> 3:24:27.360]  and every time they slander your name we need to back you up because they've now
[3:24:27.360 --> 3:24:32.800]  turned their TV programming they've put you into it and use your name in a
[3:24:32.800 --> 3:24:36.480]  certain way we need to turn that around well they are up in their attacks but I
[3:24:36.480 --> 3:24:42.040]  wouldn't take that as if they're as if that's a sign of strength I mean the
[3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:46.320]  globalist hate having to name me but you're right they're intensifying their
[3:24:46.320 --> 3:24:50.680]  attacks I mean Bloomberg Daily Beast yesterday bunch of publications today I
[3:24:50.680 --> 3:24:56.800]  mean they are coming out against info wars because they know the military and
[3:24:56.800 --> 3:25:01.120]  police are listening and they listen to the show because they know what's
[3:25:01.120 --> 3:25:05.400]  incredible they know they're compartmentalized I'm compartmentalized but
[3:25:05.400 --> 3:25:09.680]  you combine the two groups we're not compartmentalized and we know what we're
[3:25:09.680 --> 3:25:13.800]  talking about and so there's a real discussion outside of mainstream media
[3:25:13.800 --> 3:25:18.720]  and you know Johnny Six Pack watching TV all day there's a real debate in the
[3:25:18.720 --> 3:25:22.480]  system going on right now and that's why the globalist hate us and it's not
[3:25:22.480 --> 3:25:26.840]  working I mean the police and military are smart enough to know that when they
[3:25:26.840 --> 3:25:30.760]  see mainstream media or MSNBC saying horrible things about me that that
[3:25:30.760 --> 3:25:34.640]  means I must be saying something they need to listen to and all I'm here I
[3:25:34.640 --> 3:25:38.200]  don't have all the answers I'm just here pointing out that our government's
[3:25:38.200 --> 3:25:42.640]  becoming lawless that we're being controlled by foreign interest and that
[3:25:42.640 --> 3:25:49.480]  they're trying to prepare a tyrannical takeover as some type of some type of
[3:25:49.480 --> 3:25:53.840]  rearguard action for the globalist and they're trying to cook up a race war
[3:25:53.840 --> 3:25:57.680]  civil war and that we don't want to be part of it I mean that message
[3:25:57.680 --> 3:26:03.880]  resonates because it's true and common sense go ahead I know a lot of info
[3:26:03.880 --> 3:26:07.200]  warriors feel like they want to do something but they do feel like they
[3:26:07.200 --> 3:26:10.800]  don't know what to do the YouTube comments is an excellent place for all of
[3:26:10.800 --> 3:26:14.600]  us to get together absolutely everyone should be vocal every day everyone
[3:26:14.600 --> 3:26:19.880]  should be aggressive online offline we're an info war fire it will don't wait
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:23.840]  for orders from headquarters right to the sound of the guns now is the time for
[3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:28.400]  maximum effort the globalists are making their move anything else Casey I
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:32.160]  actually was calling about the blacklist the real blacklist NBC
[3:26:32.160 --> 3:26:36.360]  Dateline put this out on national TV the other day and you I encourage
[3:26:36.360 --> 3:26:39.280]  everybody to go watch it pop up the views on this thing so they know this is
[3:26:39.280 --> 3:26:43.160]  the kind of media they need to be putting out stuff like this you're
[3:26:43.160 --> 3:26:46.920]  everybody will be shocked when they see how deep the mainstream media went on
[3:26:46.920 --> 3:26:51.240]  the story what is the real blacklist I don't know about it it's called the real
[3:26:51.240 --> 3:26:55.520]  blacklist it's a daytime episode they aired last week but it it goes into
[3:26:55.520 --> 3:26:59.000]  certain parts of government corruption but you just wouldn't expect mainstream
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:02.440]  media to touch well sometimes they have producers that do something good and then
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:06.160]  it just kind of leaks out there but thank you like that CBS reporter that
[3:27:06.160 --> 3:27:10.320]  exposed fast and furious and everything you know and she came out and said yeah
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:13.520]  they're covering up Ebola people like oh yeah where's the Ebola well I mean
[3:27:13.520 --> 3:27:17.000]  where's the open borders nobody knew that the border patrol was shipping the
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:21.880]  illegals in till they told us and the border patrol told us we've told like 20
[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:28.360]  media outlets this mr. Jones you're the only one that sent reporters down the
[3:27:28.360 --> 3:27:36.600]  border patrol called Fox News and first they didn't want to report it we did so
[3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:41.800]  again if they can hide open borders folks they can hide anything the real
[3:27:41.800 --> 3:27:47.320]  blacklist I guess is on YouTube so we got 3,000 views let's do one more call
[3:27:47.320 --> 3:27:52.480]  and I'm out of time sorry to Rick I want to go to Rick too and real fast Greg and

[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:21.520]  to say is you know we gotta vote with our dollars and make sure that we can you
[3:28:21.520 --> 3:28:25.840]  know use what we do have in our pocket to try to get some change but I want to

[3:28:37.720 --> 3:28:41.600]  bunch of people and Lindsey Graham said we may be nuked any minute and I mean I
[3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:45.360]  don't know that's the thing I don't know that's why keep talking about it and
[3:28:45.360 --> 3:28:48.320]  then I don't know why they're demonizing me in the media all the
[3:28:48.320 --> 3:28:53.200]  sudden after a news blackout up so I don't know I'm worried or where they're
[3:28:53.200 --> 3:28:58.000]  at but I also want to say that I am a racist but I'm for the human race so
